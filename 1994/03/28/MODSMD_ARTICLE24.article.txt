# Thompson, Loveless lead women to another victory
## 
### Reagan Demas Staff writer 
INDIANAPOLIS - It did not
take long for it to become
painfully evident J,o schools
across the country that the
NCAA women's swimming
championships were being held
in Cardinal-infested waters.
The Cardinal is celebrating its
third national championship in
as many years after winning the
title last week by 91 points.
"All year long I felt we were
talented," head coach Richard
Quick said. "But we weren't
quite as established or solid as we
have been in past years."
The team solidified in the cold
air of Indiana, however, stifling
all doubts as to the existence of a
Cardinal dynasty in women's
swimming.
This year's meet was a closer
affair than the blow-outs of years
past. Two years ago Stanford
beat second-place Texas by only
84.5 points, but last year the
Cardinal mutilated the field,
defeating its nearest competitor
(Florida) by 228.5 points. This
year Stanford won the meet,
beating out the Longhorns and
Florida in what was supposed to
be one of the closer meet finish
es.
This year's Cardinal squad
was not as invincible as last
year's mammoth team. "Obvi
ously by our lineup, we had some
holes," Quick said. "We weren't
as strong in the breaststroke,
and we lost a great diver (Eileen
Richetelli) at the beginning of
the year."
Stanford entered the meet
with two primary competitors in
the Longhorns and the Gators.
Texas was strong in the diving
events, while Florida held the top
seeds in most relay events.
The Cardinal led off the meet
with a crucial confidence-build
ing victory in the 200-yard
freestyle relay. Florida finished
third in the finals of the relay, a
precursor to their disappointing
showing in many relay events
throughout the rest of the meet.
Stanford trailed for several
events during the first day of
competition. Following the 500
free swim, Stanford was third

place with 47 points, while Flori
da led the field with 68. But
those scores were soon to change.
"Typically the first day is the
weakest for us and we get
stronger as the meet goes along,"
junior Jenny Thompson said. "I
[feltJ confident that we were win
ning and that [we'd be better off
the next two days.]"
The Cardinal jumped back
into the lead with a strong show
ing in the final three events of
the first day. Stanford took the
second and third place finishes in
the 200 individual medley, as
senior Lea Loveless and junior
Mary Ellen Blanchard finished
just behind Southern California
freshman Kristine Quance to
gain the Cardinal valuable
points.
The 50 freestyle event saw the
first NCAA record of the meet.
Thompson was inched out at the
wall by Colorado State junior
Amy Van Dyken, whose time of
21.77 set a new NCAA and pool
record.
"I just wanted to go as fast as
I had coming into the meet," Van
Dyken said. "I had to look at the
time a million times and make
sure it was really my lane."
Thompson's finish of 22.26
was just short of Van Dyken's
record-setting time, but Van
Dyken was aware of Thompson's
presence in the pool. "I was real
ly concerned [about Jenny].
When I came off the wall I did
look at her. She's a tough com
petitor and can come from
behind and do anything. I was
kind of worried."
Interestingly enough, Thomp
son's final leg of 50 yards in the
200 free relay was timed at
21.71, .06 second faster than Van
Dyken's record-setting swim in
the 50 free.
"The 50 [freestyle final)
wasn't really a surprise because I
knew [Van Dyken 1 is that talent
ed," Thompson said. "I'm really
happy that she beat me with an
American record. I'd rather she
do that than beat me by
l/100th."
Stanford led Texas by 19
points after the 50 free. Sopho
more Jessica Tong placed fourth
in that event along with fresh
man Kerry O'Hanlon's 16th

place finish, and the Cardinal
regained the lead going into the
final event of the first day.
Florida's predicted victory in
the 400 yard medley relay left
the standings close after the first
day of competition. Stanford fin
ished third, .17 second behind
second place Auburn. At the end
of the first day, the Cardinal held
a slim seven-point lead over
Texas.
The meet began to turn Stan
ford's way the second day. Texas
suffered a fatal blow in the 200
medley relay preliminaries. The
fourth leg jumped off the block
before the third leg touched, dis
qualifying the Longhorns from
competing in the finals of that
relay.
"We got more of an edge. . . .
Texas had a relay disqualified
and that really hurt them,"
Quick said. "They'd have [had]
as much as 40 more points on
their total and a little less for
us."
The 200 medley relay was yet
another landmark in the meet.
Stanford was inched out by
Auburn, who became the first
team other than Stanford, Texas
or Florida to win a relay in the
history of the NCAA champi
onship meet.
"It's exciting that different
teams are standing up," Loveless
said of the Auburn victory. "It's
good for swimming and makes
for an exciting NCAA [tourna
ment]."
The Cardinal extended its lead
from that point on, capitalizing
on Thompson's victory and new
pool record in the 100 butterfly.
Junior Becky Crowe's sixth-place
finish also helped catapult the
Cardinal ahead of second-place
Florida by 57 points.
"Typical of the spirit of our
team was Becky Crowe's second
place finish in the 200 fly and

finalist in the 100 fly," Quick
said.
"My biggest goal was for the
team to win, and we accom
plished that," Thompson said. "I
had my best time by a mile in the
100 fly, and my two other times
were right on what they had been
during the Olympic years."
The Cardinal placed two final
ists in the 200 freestyle, main
taining its lead over Florida. The
Gators crept within 36 points
after Stanford was shut out in
the 100 breaststroke, but the
Cardinal's fabulous showing in
the 100 backstroke launched
Stanford atop to stay.
Loveless topped the field in
the 100 backstroke, setting a
pool record en route to capturing
the championship. O'Hanlon and
Tong also finished in the top
eight, while senior Mary
Edwards and sophomore Mau
reen McLaren placed in the con
solation finals.
"I seemed to be struggling a
bit," Loveless said. "Taper is
always a gamble, and I missed
my first turn by a long shot."
But that missed turn did not
stop Loveless from beating out
the field. "We had two great wins
[on the second day] with Jenny
Thompson winning the 100 but
terfly in just an incredible perfor
mance and Lea Loveless, who
missed her first turn, getting the
job done in the 100 back.

"After the preliminaries of the
100 back, I knew we had a real
good chance [of winning the
meet]," Quick said.
The Cardinal took a 49-point
lead into the final event of the
second day. In the 800 freestyle
relay, another landmark was
reached. USC won the relay,
becoming the second team in the
12-year history of the NCAA
championships besides Texas,
Stanford or Florida to win a
relay. The Cardinal finished a
disappointing fourth, forced to
swim the relay without Thomp
son.
"One of our goals at the begin
ning of the year was to set an
NCAA record in the 800 free
relay," Quick said. "It turned out
we couldn't swim Jenny because
we needed her in another relay,
but we might have been able to
go faster had Jenny been on it."
Regardless, Stanford main
tained a 75-point lead over Flori
da and a 79-point lead over Texas
going into the final day of compe
tition.
Freshman Sarah Anderson
finished fourth in the 1,650
freestyle to start the final day."I
ought to have been faster,"
Anderson said. "Tapers are
extremely tricky to maneuver."
Stanford also increased its
lead in the 200 backstroke event,
placing two in the top eight and
two more in the consolation

finals. Loveless finished second
behind Texas senior Whitney
Hedgepeth's pool-record time in
that event, while O'Hanlon fin
ished sixth.
"I can tell you right now, [Lea]
gives more to a team than any
body I've ever had on my teams
in all my years of coaching,"
Quick said. "She's an outstand
ing leader."
The overall times in the meet
were slower than many predicted
would occur in what is consid
ered one of the fastest pools in
the country. "For some reason
this meet was a bit sluggish in
most events," Quick said.
"Coaches have to be careful and
not make the dual-meet season
so grueling. It makes it harder to
go faster here, trying to get a lot
of swimmers to this meet during
the regular season."
That sluggishness did not stop
Thompson from winning yet
another event and setting yet
another pool record. She beat out
Van Dyken again in the 100
freestyle, extending the Cardinal
lead to 102 points.
"I felt really good before the
race, loose and confident,"
Thompson said. "I was trying not
to look around during the race,
but I did see Van Dyken out fast
and I tried to just look to the wall
and hit it first. And it worked."
