## Cardinal's Final Four hopes doused by Purdue After three tourney victories, women fall in Western finals 
### Andy Eiser Senior staff writer 
For the Cardinal women's basketball
team, an otherwise memorable season
ended with a game it would rather forget.
The top-seeded Purdue Boilermak
ers, using a dominant inside presence
and converting all 16 of their free
throws in the final two minutes, deflat
ed 7,500 Stanford partisans to register
an 82-65 victory in the NCAA Western
Regional final at Maples Pavilion Satur
day night.
The loss snapped Stanford's 14-game
winning streak and left the Cardinal
(25-6) one step shy of the runway to
Richmond, Va., where the Boilermakers
(29-4) will participate in the Women's
Final Four with North Carolina, Alaba
ma and Louisiana Tech this weekend.
"I guess it is very hard to win on the
visitor's bench," said Stanford head
coach Tara VanDerveer, referring to
the fact that as the higher seed, the Car
dinal wore its road jerseys and used the
opposite end of a floor on which it had
won 108 of its previous 111 games.
Using Stanford's customary position
as a bully pulpit, Purdue, the Big Ten
Conference regular season co-champions,
established the tone of the contest early
and took advantage of the Cardinal's 29.7
percent (11-of-37) field goal shooting to
jump to a 32-25 half-time lead.
"In the beginning, we missed some
good shots, some makeable shots. I
think we looked rushed," VanDerveer
said.
Despite committing two turnovers
and missing several easy attempts in
the opening minutes, however, Stan
ford scratched out a 10-9 advantage on
a 12-foot jumper by senior guard
Christy Hedgpeth with 14:54 remaining
in the half. But Boilermakers junior
guard Cindy Lamping answered with a
layup 23 seconds later and Purdue
would never again trail.
"I knew that as long as we held the
lead, we could affect how loud the crowd
was," said Boilermakers head coach Lin
Dunn.
Indeed, after a Hedgpeth layup
closed the gap to 13-12 at the 11:55
mark, Purdue showed no signs of intim
idation by a raucous sellout crowd or
the national television cameras on
hand. Behind four points apiece by
reserves Jannon Roland and Shannon
Lindsey, the Boilermakers embarked on
a 15-5 run and seized their first double
digit lead at 28-17 with 5:34 left in the
period.
The Cardinal scored eight of the
half's final 12 points as the teams
exchanged several misses, but Purdue's
slow-down style and frontcourt depth

had clearly taken its toll.
"It was hard to match bodies with
them, because they played the inside
game so well and made key inside bas
kets," VanDerveer said.
Stanford's matchup problems were
exacerbated when junior forward
Rachel Hemmer was whistled for her
second foul with 6:13 remaining and
junior center Anita Kaplan left with
three fouls at the 1:49 mark. Sopho
more Bobbie Kelsey and freshmen Kate
Starbird and Tara Harrington, called on
by VanDerveer to fill the inside void,
could only manage four points on two
of-10 shooting in 19 minutes before the
intermission.

Meanwhile, Roland, a freshman, and
Lindsey, a junior, scored 10 points in 20
minutes while spelling Boilermakers
freshman forward and Regional Most
Outstanding Player Leslie Johnson,
who committed her second foul just
seven minutes into the action.
"Basically, we had four post players
versus their two, and foul trouble was
the key," Dunn said.
Hemmer, who had grabbed six
rebounds to go along with a team-high
17 points, opened second-half scoring
with a layup that brought the Cardinal
within five. Purdue then scored the
next four points before Stanford used
two Hemmer free throws, a three-point
er by junior guard Kate Paye and layups
by All-Regional performers Hedgpeth
and Kaplan to pull even at 36-36 with
14:30 left in the game.
But 20 seconds later, Boilermakers
sophomore forward Tonya Kirk, anoth
er member of the All-Regional team,
registered perhaps the backbreaking
blow to the Cardinal when she drilled
home three of her 11 points.
Stanford saw one last tantalizing
look at turning the tide when, at 45-44
with under 10 minutes to play, Kelsey
and Starbird were whistled for contro
versial traveling violations on consecu

tive Cardinal possessions.
But the night belonged to Purdue, as
junior guard Jennifer Jacoby helped
seal the victory by nailing six of her
game-high 20 points from the free
throw stripe in the closing seconds.
The only Stanford highlight came
with a touch of wistful irony, as Hedg
peth concluded her Cardinal career to a
thunderous ovation after fouling out
with 1:45 left.
"I'm disappointed, because I believed
we could do it," a tearful Hedgpeth said.
While the Cardinal found only disap
pointment Saturday night, it gained
satisfaction in earning successful
revenge on the Colorado Buffaloes in a
regional semifinal Thursday night. In
the evening's opener, a 23-point, seven
rebound performance by Johnson gave
the Boilermakers an 82-56 win over the
surprising 13th-seeded Texas A&M
Aggies. Stanford then took to Maples
court before yet another sellout crowd
with the Buffaloes' 80-67 Western
Regional ambush last year in Missoula,
Mont., squarely on its mind.
On the strength of Kaplan's game
high 29 points and seven rebounds and
Hedgpeth's 17 points and five assists,
the Cardinal scored the final 12 points
of the contest en route to a 78-62 deci
sion. Senior forward Jamillah Lang led
Colorado with 16 points and nine
rebounds and was later voted to the All-
Regional team.
The Cardinal advanced to the West
ern Regional on the strength of two
Maples Pavilion victories the previous
week.
In first-round action on March 16,
Stanford downed the Wisconsin-Green
Bay Phoenix, a 15th-seeded tourna
ment newcomer, 81-56 before 3,428.
Hedgpeth led all scorers with 27 points
on 11-of-15 shooting that included a
perfect four-for-four from three-point
range, while Kaplan added 23 points on
10-of-14 shooting from inside the paint.
Forward Lisa Marshall led the Phoenix
with 17 points.
On March 19, the Cardinal survived
a bit of a scare in its second-round
matchup with the seventh-seeded Mon
tana Grizzlies. Leading by as many as
10 late in the second half, Stanford saw
the margin evaporate and the game tied
at 60-60 with 3:15 remaining. But Hem
mer layed in two of her 16 points and,
after a Grizzlies turnover, nailed both
ends of a one-and-one from the foul line
to seal a 66-62 Stanford win before
5,187. Hedgpeth once again led all scor
ers with 19 points.
The Cardinal concluded its Pacific 10
Conference season the week before that
