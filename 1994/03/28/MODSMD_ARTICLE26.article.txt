The Stanford Cardinal base
ball team continued to play road
warrior last week, winning three
of its four games away from
Sunken Diamond after dropping
two of three on its home field.
Playing to its standing in the
latest Baseball America poll, the
lOth-ranked Cardinal (18-12, 7-
5 in the Pacific 10 Conference
Southern Division) started
spring break by losing two of
three home contests to No. 4
USC before posting a single vic
tory at unranked UNLV and
taking two of three from unher
alded Arizona in Tucson, Ariz.
The Cardinal got off to a run
ning start in its March 19 open
er with USC (21-6, 8-4 following
the series), besting the Trojans
4-3 and getting a quality start
from sophomore southpaw Dan
Reed. In six innings, Reed (4-2 at
the time) allowed only six hits
and one earned run, while walk
ing two and striking out two. He
lowered his ERA to 2.10, the
best among Stanford starters.
Sophomore catcher A.J.
Hinch included a double and two
runs batted in while sparking
the Cardinal offense with a 3-
for-4 performance. Junior sec
ond baseman Jed Hansen added
an RBI triple in going 3-for-5 to
touch USC starter Tony Nieto
(3-4) with the loss.
The explosive Trojans were
quick to bounce back the follow
ing day, however, as they
smashed out 12 hits in a 9-0
rout. Freshman lefthander
Randy Flores pitched the first
complete game of his career for
USC, limiting the Cardinal to
four hits while striking out two.
"[Flores] did a great job," said
Stanford manager Mark Mar
quess. "He threw a lot of strikes
and got ahead. He was ahead of

us for almost all of the game."
Trojan second baseman
Lionel Hastings, who led the
USC charge with three hits and
four RBI, also approved of Flo
res' shutout.
"I would have to say that
Randy did a great job today
pulling them down," Hastings
said. "Stanford has a great ball
club â€” they've got a great hit
ting team, and they do all the lit
tle things."
The Trojans' defense was
equally stifling, erasing several
potential Cardinal threats by
turning five double plays.
"[The Stanford hitters] had
some good swings," Flores said.
"On the mistake pitches I threw,
we had some great defensive
plays."
Defense keyed a 5-3 Trojans
victoiy in the rubber game Mon
day, as two double plays helped
freshman Scott Henderson (2-0)
go 7-1/3 innings before handing
the reins to junior Grant Vermil
lion, who picked up his third save.
Junior third baseman Aaron
Boone provided the key hit of the
day for USC, lining a fiflh-inning
single that drove in two and
erased a 2-1 Cardinal advantage.
After stopping in Nevada long
enough to score a 7-6 win over
the UNLV Runnin' Rebels
Wednesday, Stanford invaded
the Arizona desert for a three
game set at Sancet Field.
In Friday's opener, Reed
improved to 5-2 as the Cardinal
posted all of its runs in the first
five innings of a 7-5 win. Reed
scattered 10 hits over 6-1/3
innings, while junior Matt
Marenghi pitched the final 2-2/3
to pick up his second save.
The Wildcats clawed back on
Saturday, pushing across two
runs with two outs and the bases
loaded in the bottom of the ninth
inning to pull out an 8-7 victory.
