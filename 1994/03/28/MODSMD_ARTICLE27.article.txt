# Men's season ends in NIT first round
## 
### Brian Border Staff writer 
It wasn't supposed to end like
this.
The Stanford men's basketball
team's season came to an abrupt
halt in the first round of the post
season National Invitational Tour
nament March 17, as the Cardinal
(17-11) fell prey to the Gonzaga
Bulldogs 80-76 before 2,289 at
Maples Pavilion.
"It wasn't the way we wanted to
end up, but give Gonzaga credit,"
said Stanford coach Mike Mont
gomery. "Their experience paid off
for them."
The Cardinal's surprisingly suc
cessful 1993-94 campaign, one of
the best turnaround stories in col
lege hoops, deserved a better finish
— either a berth in the NCAA
postseason tournament or at least
a high finish in the consolation
National Invitational Tournament.
As the end of the regular season
neared, neither goal seemed out of
reach.
Last year the Cardinal posted a
meager 7-23 record and was picked
by many to finish about the same
this year.
Instead, the team made the
biggest jump ever in the Pacific 10
Conference standings over two sea
sons — from last place in 1993 to a
fourth-place tie this year.
Yet a crucial road loss to the
Washington State Cougars on
March 10 cost Stanford a trip to
NCAAs, while the Gonzaga defeat
crushed the Cardinal's hopes for its
second NIT championship in four
years.
The outcome of the Gonzaga
game was especially disheartening
for the Cardinal, especially consid
ering that the Stanford squad nar
rowly missed an improbable come
back late in the game.
Trailing 50-31 two and a half
minutes into the second half, the
Cardinal clawed back to tie the
score at 63 on an Andy Poppink
jump shot with 6:30 remaining.
"We had them on the ropes,"
said Gonzaga center Jeff Brown.
"Being at their home, we knew they
were going to make a run at us."
Indeed, forward Brent Williams

and guard Dion Cross took over the
game as Stanford outscored the
Bulldogs 32-13, completely erasing
Gonzaga's overwhelming lead.
Williams scored 11 of his 24
total points during that scoring
run, and Cross chipped in nine of
his 25 points, tying his career-high
point total.
While Cross converted several
long-range shots, Williams scored six
straight points and stole two Gonza
ga passes within a one-minute span
to close the deficit to three.
Following a David Harbour free
throw, Poppink converted his turn
around jumper, tying the contest
and giving the Cardinal tremen
dous boost of confidence.
"I thought we had them," said
Poppink, a junior. "I thought for
sure we were going to get them."
However, the Bulldogs refused
to be rattled by Stanford's scoring
run or by the suddenly rowdy home
crowd.
On Gonzaga's very next posses
sion, guard Matt Kinloch nailed a
26-foot three-pointer to take some
steam out of the Cardinal rally.
"He shouldn't have had that
shot," Montgomery said. "It was
huge. We should have learned our
lesson at that point."
Though Stanford had to play
catch-up for the rest of the game, it
put itself into a position to send the
game into overtime when Poppink
stole the ball with 20 seconds left.
Needing just a two-point basket
to tie the game, the ball was passed
inside to Poppink, who attempted
another turnaround move. Howev
er, the 6-foot-7 forward was called
for a questionable offensive foul as
defender John Rillie fell to the floor.
"The move I made was the one I
had been making all second half,"
Poppink said. "When the whistle
blew, I thought I was going to the
line to shoot free throws for over
time."
After a dismal first-half effort,
the Cardinal should have been
happy to have made the game so
close down the finish. The poor
shooting Stanford squad connected
on just one of its nine three-point
shots and converted only six of its
12 free throw attempts.
"We started off slow," Mont

gomery said. "We couldn't get in
sync."
Similar to the Gonzaga game,
the Cardinal also failed to come
through down the stretch against
Washington State.
Stanford trailed by just four

points in the game's closing min
utes, but it received a serious blow
when technical fouls were called on
both Cardinal forward Darren Ail
away and on Montgomery for
