ble of Ohio.
At 150 pounds, sophomore

"I liked the way we compet-

Ed here," said Stanford coach
Chris Horpel. "Jay and Tod
both did better at nationals
that their [Pacific 10 Confer

fourth) would make people
think. In fact, I think both of
them now know what they
have to do to be Ail-Ameri
cans next year."
