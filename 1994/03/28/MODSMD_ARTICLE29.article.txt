# Men's tennis remains undefeated netting 3 more wins
## 
### Mike Langford Senior staff writer 
Last week was anything but a break for the
Stanford men's tennis team.
While the swimming teams were winning
championships and the rest of the campus was
watching their March Madness pools come apart

at the seams, the Cardinal netters were facing
three competitive matches after not playing any
tennis during finals week. And what were the
results?
Stanford remains undefeated and ranked No. 1
in the nation.
Last weekend, the Cardinal (15-0) bedeviled Ari
zona State by a score of 5-1, and followed with a

wild 4-3 win over Arizona. Earlier in the week,
Stanford blanked Brigham Young by a score of 7-0.
"It was a good week for the guys," said Stan
ford head coach Dick Gould. "They competed well
and did a real good job in conditions that weren't
so good."
The rain hit Arizona over the weekend, and
Stanford was lucky it got through the matches at
all. Friday against Arizona State, the teams decid
ed to play the singles matches first in light of the
threatening skies. Stanford responded by winning
all but one of the matches.
Senior Ail-American Michael Flanagan, ranked

10th in the nation in the
latest Rolex Collegiate
Rankings, faced the third
ranked player in the coun
try, the Sun Devil's Sargis
Sargsian. Flanagan down
ed the Armenian 7-6, 6-4.
Sophomore Jeff Salzen
stein followed suit by
downing Eric Brunner 6-
2, 6-3 at second singles.
Senior Robert Devens,

playing at No. 3 singles, beat Arizona State's
Peter Jeschke in three sets, 4-6, 6-2, 6-4.
Senior Chris Cocotos soundly defeated Sergio
Elias at No. 5, 6-2, 6-0, and sophomore Jim
Thomas continued his dominance at No. 6 with a
6-4, 7-6 win over Mike Mackey. The only loss of
the day came at No. 4 singles where senior Vimal
Patel lost to Sun Devil Paul Reber, 7-5, 6-1.
No sooner did the teams finish singles play
than it started pouring. All doubles matches were
canceled, as the overall match was already
clinched.
"We were fortunate to win the match in sin
gles," Gould said. "We were lucky that we got that
one in at all. We just barely finished (before the
rain came)."
On Saturday, Stanford was able to sneak in an
entire match between rain delays and possible
cancellations. The Cardinal got the win 4-3 in a
match that was perhaps not as close as the score
may indicate.
Doubles was played first this time, and Stan
ford dominated. Flanagan-Cocotos downed Jason
Appel and Sten Sumberg 8-6 at No. 1 doubles.
Patel-Salzenstein annihilated their opponents at
No. 2 by a score of 8-0, and the team of Devens
and frosh phenom Grant Elliott won 8-5.

It was a good week for the
guys. They competed well and
did a real good job in condi
tions that weren't so good.'

At the same time as the doubles, Thomas and
Arizona's Chris Jenkins played their match, hop
ing to get the match finished before the rain
returned. Thomas came away with a quick 6-4, 6-
2 win.
With the doubles point and one singles point,
Stanford needed to win only two more matches to
clinch the win. And that's exactly what it got.
Salzenstein beat Appel at second singles, 6-4, 6-3,
and Devens downed Sumberg at No. 3, 6-3, 6-3.
But the rest of the day would go the Wildcats'
way. Flanagan lost to No. 16-ranked Jan Ander
son at No. 1 singles, 6-4, 6-3, and Arizona's Matt

Foote topped Cocotos at
fifth singles, 7-5, 6-4.
Patel lost a close match to
Brandon Hearn at No. 4
singles by a score of 3-6, 6-
4, 6-4.
"We got our points early
and were able to get the
win," said Gould, who
r added that the conditions
_ over the weekend made the
matches extra challenging.

"At that altitude, the ball really comes off the
racket," Gould said. "Both matches were on cold,
windy days, and we hadn't played in a while. I
really thought that the guys handled themselves
very well considering."
Last Wednesday, Stanford faced Brigham
Young and trounced on the Cougars from begin
ning to end. In doubles, Flanagan-Cocotos beat
Herman Vande Casteele and Boris Bosnjakovic 8-
5 at No. 1. Patel-Salzenstein came out on top in a
squeaker at No. 2 doubles, topping Micah Rideout
and Brian Hardin by a score of 9-7. At No. 3 dou
bles, Devens-Elliott downed Colin McMullin and
Lance Squire, 8-4.
Singles was more of the same. All six singles
won, with only Devens and Patel needing three
sets to defeat their opponents.
"It was a solid match for us," Gould said. "We
were ready and we were well prepared."
Stanford will need to be well prepared for this
weekend, when it will see two of its toughest dual
matches thus far. National title contenders USC
and UCLA will come to the Farm to try to knock
the Cardinal from its undefeated top ranking.
"Here we are, 15-0, but now we face two great
teams this weekend," Gould said. "It will be a
good taste of the real world."

At the same time as the doubles, Thomas and
Arizona's Chris Jenkins played their match, hop
ing to get the match finished before the rain
returned. Thomas came away with a quick 6-4, 6-
2 win.
With the doubles point and one singles point,
Stanford needed to win only two more matches to
clinch the win. And that's exactly what it got.
Salzenstein beat Appel at second singles, 6-4, 6-3,
and Devens downed Sumberg at No. 3, 6-3, 6-3.
But the rest of the day would go the Wildcats'
way. Flanagan lost to No. 16-ranked Jan Ander
son at No. 1 singles, 6-4, 6-3, and Arizona's Matt

Foote topped Cocotos at
fifth singles, 7-5, 6-4.
Patel lost a close match to
Brandon Hearn at No. 4
singles by a score of 3-6, 6-
4, 6-4.
"We got our points early
and were able to get the
win," said Gould, who
r added that the conditions
_ over the weekend made the
matches extra challenging.

"At that altitude, the ball really comes off the
racket," Gould said. "Both matches were on cold,
windy days, and we hadn't played in a while. I
really thought that the guys handled themselves
very well considering."
Last Wednesday, Stanford faced Brigham
Young and trounced on the Cougars from begin
ning to end. In doubles, Flanagan-Cocotos beat
Herman Vande Casteele and Boris Bosnjakovic 8-
5 at No. 1. Patel-Salzenstein came out on top in a
squeaker at No. 2 doubles, topping Micah Rideout
and Brian Hardin by a score of 9-7. At No. 3 dou
bles, Devens-Elliott downed Colin McMullin and
Lance Squire, 8-4.
Singles was more of the same. All six singles
won, with only Devens and Patel needing three
sets to defeat their opponents.
"It was a solid match for us," Gould said. "We
were ready and we were well prepared."
Stanford will need to be well prepared for this
weekend, when it will see two of its toughest dual
matches thus far. National title contenders USC
and UCLA will come to the Farm to try to knock
the Cardinal from its undefeated top ranking.
"Here we are, 15-0, but now we face two great
teams this weekend," Gould said. "It will be a
good taste of the real world."

Sophomore Ricky Becker takes a swing in the men's 7-0 thrashing of BYU on March 23.
Last week was anything but a break for the
Stanford men's tennis team.
While the swimming teams were winning
championships and the rest of the campus was
watching their March Madness pools come apart

at the seams, the Cardinal netters were facing
three competitive matches after not playing any
tennis during finals week. And what were the
results?
Stanford remains undefeated and ranked No. 1
in the nation.
Last weekend, the Cardinal (15-0) bedeviled Ari
zona State by a score of 5-1, and followed with a

wild 4-3 win over Arizona. Earlier in the week,
Stanford blanked Brigham Young by a score of 7-0.
"It was a good week for the guys," said Stan
ford head coach Dick Gould. "They competed well
and did a real good job in conditions that weren't
so good."
The rain hit Arizona over the weekend, and
Stanford was lucky it got through the matches at
all. Friday against Arizona State, the teams decid
ed to play the singles matches first in light of the
threatening skies. Stanford responded by winning
all but one of the matches.
Senior Ail-American Michael Flanagan, ranked

10th in the nation in the
latest Rolex Collegiate
Rankings, faced the third
ranked player in the coun
try, the Sun Devil's Sargis
Sargsian. Flanagan down
ed the Armenian 7-6, 6-4.
Sophomore Jeff Salzen
stein followed suit by
downing Eric Brunner 6-
2, 6-3 at second singles.
Senior Robert Devens,

playing at No. 3 singles, beat Arizona State's
Peter Jeschke in three sets, 4-6, 6-2, 6-4.
Senior Chris Cocotos soundly defeated Sergio
Elias at No. 5, 6-2, 6-0, and sophomore Jim
Thomas continued his dominance at No. 6 with a
6-4, 7-6 win over Mike Mackey. The only loss of
the day came at No. 4 singles where senior Vimal
Patel lost to Sun Devil Paul Reber, 7-5, 6-1.
No sooner did the teams finish singles play
than it started pouring. All doubles matches were
canceled, as the overall match was already
clinched.
"We were fortunate to win the match in sin
gles," Gould said. "We were lucky that we got that
one in at all. We just barely finished (before the
rain came)."
On Saturday, Stanford was able to sneak in an
entire match between rain delays and possible
cancellations. The Cardinal got the win 4-3 in a
match that was perhaps not as close as the score
may indicate.
Doubles was played first this time, and Stan
ford dominated. Flanagan-Cocotos downed Jason
Appel and Sten Sumberg 8-6 at No. 1 doubles.
Patel-Salzenstein annihilated their opponents at
No. 2 by a score of 8-0, and the team of Devens
and frosh phenom Grant Elliott won 8-5.

It was a good week for the
guys. They competed well and
did a real good job in condi
tions that weren't so good.'
