# Nowhere to go
## Harassment of gays frequent, rarely reported 
### Beth Berselli Staff writer 
As a freshman, senior Rachel
Maddow was assisting a drunk fe
male acquaintance at a fraternity
party when a fraternity member
called her "a dyke," shoved her
and then tried to punch her.
"I was terrified. It was a really
scary situation," Maddow said. "It
was a mildly confrontational situ
ation to begin with, but because he
knew I was gay he used that as an
excuse to escalate it into a violent
situation."
She added that the incident
prompted her to take several self
defense classes.
"I had no idea what to do about
it. I didn't know then and I don't
know now," said Maddow, a se
nior.
Members of the gay and lesbian
community say that although
such incidents of harassment are
widespread, few victims file for
mal complaints.
Although "harassment hap
pens on a regular basis," senior

Natasha Iskander, a staff member
at the Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual
Community Center, says the Uni
versity fails to inform students on
how to file a complaint. Even
those students who know whereto
go for help may fear retaliation or
the loss of confidentiality, Iskan
der added.
"There is not enough informa
tion disseminated," she said.
But Judicial Affairs Officer
Sally Cole disagreed. "I think that
if they don't know where to go,
they haven't asked somebody like
an adviser or a resident staff mem
ber," Cole said. "I believe that the
information about where to go is
there." She added that informa
tion is presented in dorm pro
gramming and during residence
staff orientation.
Iskander said the failure to ade
quately inform students is an ex
ample of how the University ne
glects the needs of gay and lesbian
students.
"It is the University's responsi
bility to take care of the safety of
its students. ... If students are
being physically harassed then the
University clearly isn't fulfilling
that responsibility and measures
need to be taken," Iskander said.
She pointed to an understaffed
LGBCC as one reason why more
students don't report incidents of
harassment. "The center is staffed
with student volunteers who don't
have the experience to know
where to tell students to go for
help," Iskander said.
No specific person is in charge
of helping gay and lesbian stu
dents deal with harassment inci
dents, she added. "It's under no
one's job description to take care of
the issue. There's no equivalent of
a sexual assault coordinator or
assistant dean to deal with the
issue."
Troy Gilbert, a part-time advis
er to the LGBCC, agreed. "Clearly,
institutionally, there is no person
identifiable to the gay and lesbian
community as a dean for their
problems, issues and concerns," he
said.
'Greater education'
Creating a full-time staff posi
tion at the LGBCC would be one
way the University could meet its
responsibility to gay and lesbian
students, Iskander said.
Claiming that resident assis
tants and resident fellows don't
get enough training on "queer
issues," Iskander advocated addi
tional education for them as well
as professional training for

LGBCC staff.
She also suggested "greater
education for the community at
large," which can be accomplished
through financial support for the
center's speakers bureau.
"These basic needs that aren't
being met contribute to a climate
where these kind of incidents can
happen," Iskander said. "The Uni
versity needs to show a commit
ment to students who are queer."
When students are harassed,
Cole said they may want to turn to
their residence dean. The resi
dence deans are "hooked into a
network of other deans" and can
help students determine "who are
the best people to try to respond to
the problem," Cole said.
She added that the residence
deans "have clear authority to
impose sanctions. . . . They can
withdraw residential privileges,
impose financial penalties or com
munity service."
But Iskander said many stu
dents are hesitant to talk to their
resident dean because "there's no
guarantee that the [deans]
aren't going to be homophobic. . . .
Many students aren't willing to
take that risk."
Iskander added that resident
deans "need to be queer-positive
and understanding of complex
issues of confidentiality."
Fear of being 'outed'
Many gay men and lesbians
who have experienced harassment
don't file complaints because of
"fear of retaliation" and "lack of
confidentiality," Maddow said.
Iskander agreed that the issue
of confidentiality is particularly
important to gay and lesbian stu
dents. "There's a feeling that you

can't report it because you'll be
'outed' by it.... It's a risk that
many students aren't willing to
take," she said.
Gay and lesbian students may
be more worried about possible
retaliation than other students,
Cole said.
Although the University
"promises strict confidentiality," if
an incident merits investigation,
the level of confidentiality can be
jeopardized when a large number
of people are questioned about the
incident, Cole said.
"There is more of a potential
threat in these kind of harassment
cases if an investigation of the
complaint involves a lot of people
whose interactions with the victim
may change as a result of what
they know about the problem,"
Cole said.
Fear of being "revictimized by
the system" also prevents stu
dents from reporting incidents of
harassment, Iskander said.
Maddow agreed. "A lot of people
think that the complaint itself will
be another harrowing experience,"
she said. "If you want to get accu
rate reporting of hate crimes, you
have to go out of your way to make
sure that the system is accessible
to people. The system has to seem
safe to the people who are going to
go to it for protection."
"People will start reporting
things only if they feel it will make
a difference," Iskander said. "Peo
ple are not going to report inci
dents if they feel they're going to
run up against a hostile environ
ment and no reaction."
Judicial responses
Cole said the reluctance to
report harassment is not particu

lar to the gay and lesbian commu
nity. "It's a widely shared reaction
not to report harassment inci
dents," she said.
Formal complaints dealing with
the harassment of gay and lesbian
students have been filed in the
past, Cole said, but not very many
and none recently.
"There are university policies
and procedures that can be turned
to if they are needed," Cole said.

"More often there is an attempt to
solve the problem locally, especial
ly for non-academic misconduct
problems."
The University's Fundamental
Standard prohibits all kinds of
harassment, including harass
ment based on sexual orientation,
Cole said.
Laraine Zappert, the Universi
ty's sexual harassment coordinat
ing adviser, said the University's

harassment policy covers every
one. "It doesn't matter if someone
is gay or lesbian. Sexual harass
ment is sexual harassment," Zap
pert said.
Victims can "come speak to one
of the sexual harassment advisers
for advice and options," Zappert
said. "Anyone can come in confi
dentiality to speak with someone
and explore what they're options
are."
