# Alum's snowshoe makes tracks
## 
### Karen E. Heywood Staff writer 
Ironically, the birth of a front
running new snowshoe company
happened at sunny Stanford.
The brainchild of Perry Kle
bahn, who received a master's
degree in mechanical engineer
ing from Stanford in 1991, Atlas
Snow-Shoe Company came into
existence because "I had to come
up with a project [for Stanford's
Product Design Program] in two
days," Klebahn said. "My friend
had bought a pair of snowshoes
— I tried them out, and was basi
cally unimpressed."
Klebahn was eager to design a
more lightweight versatile shoe,
he said, with emphasis "not so
much on [selling] the product,
but introducing [snowshoeing]
as a new and acceptable activity
to the public."
What started as a degree
requirement soon catapulted
into a competitive and rapidly
growing business with the help

of Klebahn's high school friend
and Atlas co-founder, Jim
Klingbeil. The pair invested
$20,000, built a prototype, and
began production while Kle
bahn was still working on his
Stanford degree.
The resulting aluminum and
nylon shoe weighs between three
and four pounds — a sharp con
trast to its old-style ash wood
and rawhide counterpart, which
can often weigh as much as 10
pounds. The new shoe is rapidly
becoming mainstream in the
"snowbound world," Klebahn
said, from the U.S. to Canada,
Europe and even Japan.
With the latest technological
advances made by Atlas and
other snowshoe companies, said
Klebahn, the sport itself is start
ing to take off. Many people are
opting to snowshoe rather than
to ski for its versatility, ease and
cost effectiveness. Rentals are
already available at such promi
nent resorts as Aspen, Vail, and
Mammoth and a pair of the fully

assembled shoes sells for around
$200.
Klehbahn's company is inno
vative not only in its products
but also in its promotions. Atlas
has recently collaborated with
Ben and Jerry's Ice Cream to
offer "full moon snowshoe and
ice cream walks" at major
resorts, he said, adding that the
tactic has met with great success.
However, Atlas snowshoes are
as utilitarian as they are enter
taining, Klebahn said. As of late,
Atlas has been awarded the first
Government Service Adminis
tration Number in 20 years,
allowing them to sell their prod
uct to such federal institutions
as the National Park Service and
the Forestry Service, and the
company is currently vying for a
contract to outfit the United
States Marine Corps.
Atlas has been able to remain
a surprisingly intimate organiza
tion, in spite of the fact that
orders have increased from 400
pairs in 1991 to 10,000 in the
last year alone.
The company still works out
of its original factory headquar
ters, south of Market Street in
San Francisco, and employs just
six full-time staff members, Kle
bahn said.
When demand is especially
great, Atlas supplements their
employee pool with homeless
veterans through San Francis
co's Compensated Work Therapy
Program. This system is mutual
ly beneficial, Klebahn said, since
Atlas can hire the extra workers
without having to pay work
man's compensation. Simultane
ously, the veterans and their
families are given the chance to
work for "a reasonable wage
without the overhead," he said.
"[The programl gives us the
flexibility to bring people in on a
seasonal basis," said Klebahn.
Yet as their product increases
in demand — with a new line of
children's snowshoes, one
secured patent and another
about to be issued — Atlas soon
may have no choice but to per
manently expand and ultimately
relocate. "The city is perfect;
everything is in San Francisco . .
. but if we keep growing, I don't
know if we can stay here past
this season," Klebahn said.
