# Stanford, FEMA arbitration ends
## University will receive $38.5 million to repair 1989 earthquake damages 
### Rajiv Chandrasekaran Senior staff writer 
The Federal Emergency Man
agement Agency has agreed to pay
Stanford $38.5 million for repairs
related to the 1989 Loma Prieta
earthquake, which damaged 242
campus buildings and plunged
Stanford officials into a bureau
cratic morass in search of govern
mental assistance.
The agreement, reached earli
er this month, paves the way for
the restoration of six historic aca
demic buildings closed since the
earthquake, including the Stan
ford Art Museum, the west wing
of Green Library and portions of
the Inner Quad.
"This is the linchpin that en
ables us to now move forward,"
said Chief Financial Officer Peter
Van Etten. "It's a very good thing
for the University."
The 15-second temblor forced
Stanford to close 20 buildings.
University officials estimate that
it will cost between $150 million
and $200 million to repair all
damaged buildings and strength
en existing structures.
Of the $38.5 million FEMA

payment, $20
million is ear
marked for five
currently closed
academic build
ings: Building
260 (Language
Corner), Build
ing 320 (Geology
Corner), the Ter
man Lab Annex,

Building 300 and the museum.
The money will also be used to
retroactively fund repairs on
Buildings 30, 310 and 370, which
have already been reopened.
The agency will contribute
$18.5 million to the repair of the
sixth building, Green Library's
west wing. The settlement for li
brary repairs was completed in
December, but exact figures had
not been released until now.
Van Etten said he expects the
six buildings to reopen in the next
two to three years.
FEMA officials also have
agreed to contribute an estimated
$1 million toward the restoration
of Hanna House, a University
owned housed designed by Frank


Van Etten
Lloyd Wright traditionally used
by the provost, Van Etten said.
The state's Office of Emergen
cy Services will also contribute
$5 million for campus repairs
under its disaster assistance pro
gram.
Soon after the quake, the
agency provided approximately
$12 million to the University for
initial cleanup efforts, repairs to
the heavily damaged Graduate
School of Business, the purchase
of trailers and other small pro
jects. But an appeal for additional
funding reached a bureaucratic
stalemate. By law, FEMA must
fund 75 percent of the cost of
repairing earthquake-damaged
structures.
FEMA officials agreed only to
pay for the costs of restoring a
building to its pre-quake condi
tion, which, in the case of Stan
ford's un-reinforced masonry
buildings, would have entailed
putting epoxy in building cracks
instead of more expensive
retrofitting procedures.

However, Santa Clara County
building inspectors balked at the
idea and mandated that the dam
aged buildings be fully
retrofitted. As a result, the Uni
versity demanded that FEMA
pick up the tab for the seismic
upgrades.
"It was our position that
FEMA had to fund 75 percent of
the costs of making the building
operational," Van Etten said. "In
Stanford's case, that meant pass
ing the building codes."
After years of legal negotia
tions and a formal appeal to the
agency's Washington office, the
money arrived. Van Etten said
the agreement came about large
ly because of the appointment of
a new FEMA director, James
Witt, who "made all the differ
ence."
"Witt made the decision that it
was time for FEMA to resolve
Loma Prieta and get on with deal
ing with newer disasters," Van
Etten said. "At the same time, we
weren't going to go away."
In addition to federal and state
assistance, he said the University
earthquake repairs will be funded
by dipping into reserves,
fundraising and borrowing.

Much of the initial support for
the repair efforts came from
fundraising, which has generated
more than $25 million for earth
quake recovery to date. Most of
that money has gone to reopen
Memorial Church and toward
construction in the museum.
Despite the settlement, the
University is currently trying to
raise an additional $20 million for
earthquake repairs and $30 mil
lion for other restoration and
retrofitting projects, said David
Glen, the University's director of
principal gifts.
Such projects include a $12
million seismic bracing in Build
ing 160 — which houses the
Political Science Department —
and a $7 million effort to fix the
free-standing arcades in the
Quad.
But Van Etten said the first
priority is to reopen some of the
University's historic structures
that have been surrounded by
fences and construction tape for
the past four years.
"I think one of the arguments
that won IFEMAI over was that
we kept saying that a generation
of Stanford students have not
seen their library," he said.
