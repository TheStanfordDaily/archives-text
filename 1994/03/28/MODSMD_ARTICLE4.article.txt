## University will receive $38.5 million to repair 1989 earthquake damages 
### Rajiv Chandrasekaran Senior staff writer 
The Federal Emergency Man
agement Agency has agreed to pay
Stanford $38.5 million for repairs
related to the 1989 Loma Prieta
earthquake, which damaged 242
campus buildings and plunged
Stanford officials into a bureau
cratic morass in search of govern
mental assistance.
The agreement, reached earli
er this month, paves the way for
the restoration of six historic aca
demic buildings closed since the
earthquake, including the Stan
ford Art Museum, the west wing
of Green Library and portions of
the Inner Quad.
"This is the linchpin that en
ables us to now move forward,"
said Chief Financial Officer Peter
Van Etten. "It's a very good thing
for the University."
The 15-second temblor forced
Stanford to close 20 buildings.
University officials estimate that
it will cost between $150 million
and $200 million to repair all
damaged buildings and strength
en existing structures.
Of the $38.5 million FEMA

payment, $20
million is ear
marked for five
currently closed
academic build
ings: Building
260 (Language
Corner), Build
ing 320 (Geology
Corner), the Ter
man Lab Annex,

Building 300 and the museum.
The money will also be used to
retroactively fund repairs on
Buildings 30, 310 and 370, which
have already been reopened.
The agency will contribute
$18.5 million to the repair of the
sixth building, Green Library's
west wing. The settlement for li
brary repairs was completed in
December, but exact figures had
not been released until now.
Van Etten said he expects the
six buildings to reopen in the next
two to three years.
FEMA officials also have
agreed to contribute an estimated
$1 million toward the restoration
of Hanna House, a University
owned housed designed by Frank


Van Etten
