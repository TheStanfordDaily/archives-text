In a major boost to its hopes for
reopening, the Stanford Art. Mu
seum, closed since the Loma Pri
eta earthquake, has received a
$10 million contribution for reno
vation and expansion from two
patrons of the University's art
collection.
Iris and B. Gerald Cantor, who
previously gave Stanford 185
works by French sculptor Au
guste Rodin, will pay for more
than one-third of the museum's
$29 million expansion and reno
vation project.
The project will include reno
vation of the main museum build
ing, which was severely damaged
in the earthquake, the addition of
a new 36,000 square-foot wing
and the enhancement of the
Rodin Sculpture Garden. The mu
seum and the sculpture garden
will be renamed the Iris and B.
Gerald Cantor Center for the Vi
sual Arts, and is scheduled for

completion in 1997.
The Federal Emergency Man
agement Agency also recently an
nounced that it will contribute $6
million toward the project, and
more than $11 million has been
raised from private donors over
the past four years, said museum
director Tom Seligman.
"But without their gift, we
might not have been able to go
ahead with the project," he said.
University President Gerhard
Casper, who announced the gift
March 15, said in a statement that
it will "bring back to life this im
portant University and communi
ty resource . . . and provide an en
riched environment for learning."
The new wing, which will be
dedicated principally to 20th cen
tury art, will showcase works
from the University's Anderson
Print Collection and other exhibi
tions. It will also include two in
ternal sculpture gardens, im
proved space for museum cura
