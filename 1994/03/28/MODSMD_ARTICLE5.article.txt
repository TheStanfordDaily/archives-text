# Art Museum gets $10 million boost

In a major boost to its hopes for
reopening, the Stanford Art. Mu
seum, closed since the Loma Pri
eta earthquake, has received a
$10 million contribution for reno
vation and expansion from two
patrons of the University's art
collection.
Iris and B. Gerald Cantor, who
previously gave Stanford 185
works by French sculptor Au
guste Rodin, will pay for more
than one-third of the museum's
$29 million expansion and reno
vation project.
The project will include reno
vation of the main museum build
ing, which was severely damaged
in the earthquake, the addition of
a new 36,000 square-foot wing
and the enhancement of the
Rodin Sculpture Garden. The mu
seum and the sculpture garden
will be renamed the Iris and B.
Gerald Cantor Center for the Vi
sual Arts, and is scheduled for

completion in 1997.
The Federal Emergency Man
agement Agency also recently an
nounced that it will contribute $6
million toward the project, and
more than $11 million has been
raised from private donors over
the past four years, said museum
director Tom Seligman.
"But without their gift, we
might not have been able to go
ahead with the project," he said.
University President Gerhard
Casper, who announced the gift
March 15, said in a statement that
it will "bring back to life this im
portant University and communi
ty resource . . . and provide an en
riched environment for learning."
The new wing, which will be
dedicated principally to 20th cen
tury art, will showcase works
from the University's Anderson
Print Collection and other exhibi
tions. It will also include two in
ternal sculpture gardens, im
proved space for museum cura
tors to store and care for art hold
ings, and amenities for visitors,
including a cafe, a bookstore and
lecture rooms.
"The damage wrought to the
old museum building has given us
a chance to rethink the space
needed to sustain a much more
vigorous program while modern
izing all of our facilities," Selig
man said in a statement. "In
short, it has enabled us for the
first time to conceive of an art
center, one that will meld both
historic and innovative physical
elements into a greatly enriched
program for the visual arts at
Stanford."
The existing building will be
seismically retrofitted and will be
brought up to current fire and dis
ability-access standards. In addi
tion, the museum will get a state
of-the-art climate control system,
he said.

"We're going to have to do
things like take asbestos out of
here," he said. "We don't meet
any of the (county's building)
codes right now.
"But, in the end, it won't look
different to people. Our idea and
hope is to keep it visually as peo
ple have seen it before. All the
modifications will be performed
as discreetly and behind-the
scenes as possible," he continued.
The Cantors, who have sup
ported art programs at Stanford
for 25 years, have previously
given the University manuscripts,
drawings, photographs and mem
orabilia from Rodin's lifetime.
They have also established a
Rodin research fund in the Art
Department.
As a result, Stanford has
become a major world resource on
Rodin, boasting the largest collec
tion of Rodin sculptures outside of
the Musee Rodin in Paris.
Seligman said the Cantors'
gifts to Stanford have come about
because of "a love for art and a
special love for Rodin."

Art History Prof. Albert Elsen,
a noted scholar on Rodin, and the
Cantors have had a long friend
ship, Seligman said. "[Elsen]
encouraged them to support
Rodin work here. And he recently
persuaded them that supporting
the museum would be another
good use of their generosity,"
Seligman said.
Seligman said he hopes to use
the museum's new resources to
become more closely integrated
with the University's academic
mission. Although art history
students and faculty have long
used the museum's resources, he
hopes to see those involved in
fields such as history, languages,
classics and anthropology avail of
the museum.
The museum was founded in
1891 by Leland and Jane Stan
ford as a second monument to
their deceased son, Leland Jr. Its
collection includes more than
20,000 pieces and it is especially
strong in Asian art, European
and American paintings and
Native American art.
