After a quarter spent surveying student
opinion through a variety of formats, the
Commission on Undergraduate Education is
"on schedule" as it heads toward its June tar

Sheehan said.
In addition to holding myriad town meet

subcommittee on majors, said that group is

subcommittees in its information-gathering
process.

number of majors to discover good and bad
features, Heller said. The features that tend

to make a good major include good teaching, a
logical progression from introductory to ad

ish either of them but I think we'll want to
clarify and simplify."
Exactly what sort of proposals to make will
be discussed in greater detail at this quarter's
commission meetings. Sheehan said the
