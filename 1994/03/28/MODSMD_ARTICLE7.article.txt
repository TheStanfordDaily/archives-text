### Julie Makinen Senior staff writer 
Former campus activist and actress Sheri
fa Omade Edoga died March 12 after compli
cations from heart surgery in San Francisco.
She was 23.
A modern thought and literature major
who graduated in 1992, Edoga acted in nu
merous campus plays, including "Macbeth,"
"Vinegar Tom" and"The Death of the Last
Black Man in the Whole Entire World." While

at Stanford, she also pro
duced and directed a one
woman show, "Sexual
Rhythms, Orgasmic Resolu
tions."
She gained notoriety on
campus for her prominent
role in the anti-war move
ment during the Persian
Gulf war. As one of the in-


Edoga
formal leaders of Stanford Stu
dents for Peace, she helped orga
nize rallies, teach-ins and a work
shop on civil disobedience.
After graduating, Edoga pur
sued her dream of acting. Last
February, she performed play
wright Nena St. Louis' one
woman show, "Indigo Lady," at
San Francisco's Lorraine Hans
berry Theatre.
"She was so incredible," said
St. Louis. "It was the first time I
had ever let someone else per
form my work — I usually do my
own — and I couldn't believe how
happy I was to see her up there
on stage.
"We didn't expect to get some
one so young and so beautiful
who immediately grasped the
spirit of ['Indigo Lady']."
After "Indigo Lady," Edoga
went on to work at the Children's
Theater Workshop in Pleasan
ton. In January, she was cast as

"Fannie" in Oakland Ensemble
Theatre's upcoming production
of "Flying West."
At Stanford, Edoga wrote her
senior thesis on sexuality and
African-American women in the
plays of Ntozake Shange and
Aishah Rahman. In 1991, she
was awarded the Young Scholar
award from the Black Theatre
Network.
In addition to her life on stage
at Stanford, Edoga was involved
in the Pro-Choice Alliance and
she wrote for Aurora, a campus
feminist journal.
While her heart condition
made her reliant on an electric
wheelchair for traveling long dis
tances, her disability did not
dampen her enthusiasm for
activism.
"Although she was suffering
at various times, this didn't stop
her from pursuing what she
wanted to do," said Assoc. Drama
Prof. Harry Elam, Edoga's senior
thesis adviser. "In addition to
being a talented actress with a
great voice and power . . . and
being intelligent . . . she had a

real strong will and spirit to sur
vive. "
"What I remember most from
her time at Stanford was how
many things she was committed
to doing," said her former room
mate and girlfriend Monica
Worline, Class of '91. "She had a
lot of pride in the black commu
nity at Stanford, as well as the
lesbian, gay and bisexual com
munity and the disabled com
munity. She was a link between
all these communities."
In a 1991 interview with The
Daily, Edoga said, "It's always
important to articulate your posi
tion within society. My activism
is very personal. It's very much a
reflection of my interests. Part of
activism, fighting for disability
rights or fighting for minority
rights, is a way in which I look
out for myself.
"It's very important for me
not to grow out of activism or out
of the beliefs that are central to
me. . .1 want to try to hold on to
that. It has a lot to do with me."
Edoga is remembered by many
at Stanford as a fighter who acted

on her convictions.
"As a disabled, black, bisexual,
feminist woman, she was so sure
of herself," said senior Rachel
Maddow. "She got a lot of shit
from people for being all those
things, and yet she was so deter
mined."
"What really impressed me
was that she was so 'fierce,' " said
Macfdow. "She was so self-confi
dent, so determined . . . she was
totally courageous.
"She taught me a lot about
what it means to respect your
self."
Edoga is survived by her par
ents, a younger brother and a
younger sister, all of New Jersey,
and an aunt, of San Francisco.
Formal funeral services were
held by Edoga's family in New
Jersey two weeks ago, and a
memorial service was held on
campus March 20.
A memorial fund is being
established in Edoga's name.
Those who wish to contribute
may send donations, clearly
marked, to the Drama Depart
ment, care of Ron Davies.

activism, fighting for disability
rights or fighting for minority
rights, is a way in which I look
out for myself.
"It's very important for me
not to grow out of activism or out
of the beliefs that are central to
me. . .1 want to try to hold on to
that. It has a lot to do with me."
Edoga is remembered by many
at Stanford as a fighter who acted

on her convictions.
"As a disabled, black, bisexual,
feminist woman, she was so sure
of herself," said senior Rachel
Maddow. "She got a lot of shit
from people for being all those
things, and yet she was so deter
mined."
"What really impressed me
was that she was so 'fierce,' " said
Macfdow. "She was so self-confi
dent, so determined . . . she was
totally courageous.
"She taught me a lot about
what it means to respect your
self."
Edoga is survived by her par
ents, a younger brother and a
younger sister, all of New Jersey,
and an aunt, of San Francisco.
Formal funeral services were
held by Edoga's family in New
Jersey two weeks ago, and a
memorial service was held on
campus March 20.
A memorial fund is being
established in Edoga's name.
Those who wish to contribute
may send donations, clearly
marked, to the Drama Depart
ment, care of Ron Davies.
