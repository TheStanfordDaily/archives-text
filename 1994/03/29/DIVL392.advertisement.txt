People said that Commissioner Gordon had heart. He was a tough cop, and proud of it.
Easing right, exercise, vacations—those things were for guys no* so tough.
Tobacco waj part of it. A smoke would jump-start the day, help
him get through c long night, mellow out the bod hours.
Then one day oil the pain n the wodd collected in his chest and squeezed.
Jim Gordon's heart wasn't wa king right anymore. That made
it hard to be tough. Ar.a ev »n herder to be proud.
