## 
### Vivien Wang Staff writer 
The occasion was breakfast at Tiffany's, and the
only person absent was author Truman Capote
himself. But the spirit of his literary excellence was
very much alive Thursday morning in the jewel
salon of Tiffany & Co. in New York, where the de
tails of the Truman Capote Literary Trust were re
vealed.
Stanford and the University of lowa were chosen
to receive annual awards from the trust. At Stan
ford, two Truman Capote Fellowships — one for fic
tion, the other for poetry — will be awarded each
year to graduate students in the creative writing
program.
The fellowships, totaling $32,000 for two years
for each student, will begin next year.
"It was always Truman's intention that all his
posthumous royalties be collected for the continuing
benefit of writers," Alan Schwartz, Capote's literary
executor, said in a statement. "In accordance with
Mr. Capote's wishes, the trust will fund annual
awards for excellence in literary criticism and schol
arships in creative writing."
John L'Heureux, the director of Stanford's Cre
ative Writing Program, said at the breakfast cere
mony that the money from the fellowships will en
able two more writers to join the program.
"The Capote Fellowships provide an opportunity
to develop a talent, to begin a career, to achieve a
sense of excellence that will last a lifetime,"
L'Heureux said.
Prospective applicants will be required to submit
an additional manuscript along with the regular ap
plication to the Creative Writing Program.
L'Heureux said the money has been available
since Christmas, but announcement of the trust was
delayed until last Thursday to coincide with the
40th anniversary of the publication of "Breakfast at
Tiffany's."
As part of the trust, a $100,000 cash prize will be
allotted to Stanford every four years. Stanford will
then present The Truman Capote Award for Liter
ary Criticism to a critic for lifetime achievement in
literary criticism. The first award will be given in the
fall of 1995.
L'Heureux was the sole representative of Stan
ford at the breakfast ceremony, which was jointly
hosted by Random House and Tiffany & Co. "Stan
ford fits the bill nicely" as one of the two best writ
ing programs in the country, L'Heureux said, and
for this reason Stanford and the University of lowa
were selected as the trust's first recipients.
Among the 150 to 200 guests present to honor
Capote were John Updike,
George Plimpton, Norman Mail
er and Katharine Graham, as
well as "a guest list of the rich
and famous of New York,"
L'Heureux said.
Despite the literary talent
and dazzling jewelry which sur
rounded him, L'Heureux
claimed that "the nicest person I
met was Mary Tyler Moore; she
was very warm."
