## Violence erupts in S. Africa Zulu nationalists protest upcoming all-race election, 31 dead 
### 
JOHANNESBURG, South
Africa (AP) — Black factional
fighting spread to the heart of
South Africa's main city for the
first time yesterday when a
march by Zulu nationalists set
off gunbattles, stabbings and
beatings that killed at least 31
people.
Gunfire echoed off skyscrap
ers and shattered windows
around a park near city hall
where thousands of Zulus carry
ing spears rallied to protest the
all-race election next month.
Several blocks away, guards
from the rival African National
Congress fired on more Zulus
outside the ANC offices.
Leaders of the ANC and the
Zulu-dominated Inkatha Free
dom Party accused each other of
starting the violence.
People sprawled in the dirt
and under cars, cowered behind
pillars and trampled each other
trying to escape the shooting.
Blood stained streets and side
walks in at least three areas.

Hospitals reported more than
200 wounded
Law and Order Minister Her
nus Kriel declared central
Johannesburg and ten sur
rounding districts "unrest
areas," giving police wide powers
to control political gatherings
and quell unrest.
Late yesterday, leaders of the
main political parties were try
ing to arrange a summit between
President F.W. de Klerk, ANC
leader Nelson Mandela, Zulu
King Goodwill Zwelithini and
Inkatha leader Mangosuthu
Buthelezi. They were expected to
meet later this week to confront
the worsening crisis over Zulu
demands for autonomy after the
April 26-28 election.
The ANC is expected to win
the vote easily, which the Zulus
say will lead to the demise of the
Zulu culture under ANC domi
nation. The ANC rejects Zulu
demands for a separate home
land, saying the country's racial
and ethnic groups must learn to

live together after generations of
segregation under apartheid.
Political violence has soared,
particularly in Natal Province,
which includes the Zulu home
land of KwaZulu.
ANC leaders are demanding
that troops of the white-minori
ty government take over KwaZu
lu to ensure the election can pro
ceed. Soldiers recently seized
control in two other black home
lands.
Yesterday's march was
intended as a show of force by
Zulu nationalists, whose ethnic
group is the largest in South
Africa, and many stores did not
open for fear of violence.
Reports of clashes linked to
the march and to a Zulu strike
call began filtering in at dawn
from nearby black townships
where factional fighting has
gone unchecked for years. Zulus
trying to stop people from going
to work fired along the streets of
the Soweto and Kagiso town
ships, police said.
