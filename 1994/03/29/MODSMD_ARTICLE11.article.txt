# Tornadoes hit the Southeast, 44 killed
## Carolinas remain under tornado watch, rain continues across region

SPRING GARDEN, Ala. (AP) - To
some, the heat and humidity were an
ominous sign of what was ahead.
But it wasn't enough of a warning to
spare at least 44 people who were killed
when dozens of tornadoes roared east
from Alabama through Georgia, Ten
nessee and the Carolinas on Sunday.
Hundreds of others were injured.
Twenty of the dead were at a church in
Goshen, 80 miles northeast of Birming
ham. Families that arrived for Palm Sun
day services left planning Holy Week
funerals.
Portions of the Carolinas remained
under a tornado watch yesterday
evening, and rain continued to fall across
the region.
"The conditions were totally juicy for
any kind of a storm," forecaster Tony
Fulkerson of The Weather Channel said.
"A lot of people got up in the morning

and said it felt so warm and muggy that
something had to be brewing."
Late Sunday morning, warm air from
the Gulf of Mexico clashed with cold air
from Tennessee, producing about 30 tor
nadoes, Fulkerson said.
Palm Sunday services were under way
at Union Grove Methodist Church in
northeast Alabama when a tornado
ripped into it. But several dozen church
members scrambled to the basement and
the 141-year-old building held â€” even as
windows were blown out. No lives were
lost.
Brian Jennings, the choir director, said
he had gotten up to turn the power off
after the lights went out during the ser
vice.
"When I sat down it just got louder,"
he said. "We didn't see anything, you
could just feel it."
Yesterday, the church steeple lay in

pieces on the grass amid tree limbs and
debris. Plastic covered a couple of broken
stained glass windows. Tombstones that
had stood in the cemetery behind the
church for more than 100 years were
snapped in two.
About 10 miles away, at the Goshen
community near Piedmont, 140 people
were gathered for an Easter pageant at
Goshen United Methodist Church when a
tornado slammed into the building, hurl
ing bricks and collapsing the roof.

The storms moved to the northeast
later Sunday, devastating parts of moun
tainous north Georgia.
Rain continued to fall on north Georgia
yesterday as repair crews replaced torn
roofs and used chain saws to cut through
tree-clogged roads.
