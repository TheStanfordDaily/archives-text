Italians vote
ROME (AP) â€” With the parties that
have led Italy since World War II
brought down by scandal, voters were
turning to a media magnate and his con
servative alliance to fill the void, exit
polls and projections showed yesterday.
Silvio Berlusconi, whose populist
themes and volunteer-based campaign
organization raised comparisons with
Texas billionaire Ross Perot, entered
the political arena two months ago to
keep the former Communists out of
ne top
puity, iieriusconi would be a iikeiy
choice to be named premier. Italy's pres
ident generally picks a member of the
largest party in Parliament as premier,
and the premier forms a government
that must be approved by both houses.

Exit polls gave his alliance 47 percent
in the Chamber of Deputies to 31 per
cent for the leftist coalition dominated
by former Communists. The conserva
tives were leading by a narrower margin
in the Senate, according to projections by
the Abacus firm for RAI state television.
