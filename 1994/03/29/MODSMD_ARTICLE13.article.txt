## Editorials Graduate credibility 
### 
FOR SEVERAL YEARS, grad
uate students have com
plained that the ASSU is
unresponsive to their needs, that
the organization is undergraduate
centric and that special fees unfair
ly "tax" graduates for what they
deem "undergraduate" activities.
But while clamoring for change
is well and good, actions speak
louder than words. And graduate
students certainly have the option
— there are 20 ASSU Senate posi
tions for graduates. This year,
however, only 10 graduate stu
dents filed nominating petitions,
leaving 10 positions open for write
in candidates — and ensuring that
any graduate student who gets a
vote will become a senator.
Such a display of apathy only
ensures that graduate student con
cerns will, for the most part, con
tinue to go unheeded by the ASSU.
If graduate students want real
change — whether it be a revamp
ing of the fee-refund system or

complete secession from the ASSU
— they must nominate and elect
strong, enthusiastic and willing
representatives to the senate.
When random write-in candi
dates become senators by gather
ing three or four votes, graduate
students lose credibility in the eyes
of the entire student body. Such a
group of senators rarely puts
together a cohesive legislative
plan. Half the time, these senators
don't even show up to meetings.
Working from within the sys
tem, graduate students can sub
stantively revise — and improve —
the way the ASSU works. A strong
graduate senate is extremely
important, considering graduate
students don't have the extra leg
islative muscle of representation
on the Council of Presidents.
Graduate students must first
help themselves by nominating
willing and able leaders. As the
saying goes, if you want something
done right, do it yourself.
