# In need of a facelift

### 
EVERY YEAR on Founder's
Day, Stanford's president
and the senior class presi
dents march to the Mausoleum to
lay flowers at its entrance in honor
of Stanford's original benefactors.
And every year, the Mausoleum
looks more and more like an aban
doned vacant lot.
Once a place for midnight
romantic strolls, the Mausoleum
and arboretum surrounding the
tomb — originally a beautiful cac
tus garden planted by Jane Stan
ford — have lost their luster after
years of mistreatment. Now, the
most romantic event on the
grounds is Halloween, when cos
tumed partiers dance atop Leland
Stanford's grave.
The groundskeeping budget for
the Mausoleum never recovered
from harsh cuts in the 19705, a
reality that is reflected in the mea
ger plot of green grass just outside
of the tomb and the area's general

state of disrepair.
The $15,000 annual budget is
simply not enough to keep the
Mausoleum looking respectable.
While budgets are tight these days,
there are some creative ways of
giving the Stanfords the respect
they deserve.
First, doubling or even tripling
the amount spent on the Mau
soleum would be a drop in the
bucket in Stanford's budget.
Second, some local gardening
clubs might be willing to take on
an interesting pet project for a lit
tle recognition. It couldn't hurt to
look into this possibility.
And alumni who remember bet
ter days will probably dig into
their pockets for the sake of
restoring the Mausoleum.
Stanford needs to do more to
honor its founders — the annual
Founder's Day ceremony is not
enough. We must pay our respects
with our minds and our wallets.
