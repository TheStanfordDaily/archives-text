## Loafing: me, myself and I 
### 
RECIPE FOR AN ideal spring
break: Bake for ten days at 85
degrees, turning over until both
sides are golden brown. Marinate often in
a mixture of salt water, balmy breezes
and fruity tropical drinks with little
umbrellas in them.
That's what a lot of people aspire to, at
least. I admit it, I've been there, too. I
was in Jamaica with the best of them
freshman year. I grooved to calypso
bands, snaked through the Red Stripe
beer limbo contests, and fell asleep at
night to the melodious sounds of — the
gentle surf rolling in? Reality check: the
only hotel my friends and I could afford
was a couple blocks away from the beach,
so instead of the waves lulling us to sleep,
we got to hear the guys next door puking
all night. Neat. But aside from that, it
was an awesome time.
Sophomore year, I made the varsity
crew team. And I was pretty stoked on it
until I realized that the major difference
between rowing novice and rowing varsi
ty, aside from the prestige factor, was the
spring break sacrificed rowing double
sessions in Virginia. Enough said. Last
year, I went to visit my boyfriend, and
returned a single woman. Again, enough
said.
So I was really pushing the Maui thing
this year, trying to pull together my good
friends from two high schools and two
colleges for one last hurrah, before we all
took off for London, France, Hong Kong
and various grad schools. I managed to

delude myself into thinking this would
happen in one form or another until
February, when 1 finally faced the fact
that they had all bailed on my grand
plans for their own adventures.
Bitterness.
During exams, I was dreading spend
ing break on — or at the most, around —
campus. I was frantic at not having made
exciting plans to jet off to Tahiti. I was
stressing over the prospect of spending
ten days with just me, myself and I. But
the very things I had dreaded turned out
to be those which made for a fruitful peri
od of self-actualization. You see, spring
break of senior year was the week that I
discovered the joy of loafing.
Before last week, loafing was not an
activity I had ever much thought about,
much less participated in for any signifi
cant — that is, a more than an couple of
hours on a long weekend — period of
time. Nor, I would imagine, have many of
us here at Stanford.
We spent our high school days ensur
ing that we would get here by either geek
ing or doing everything else under the
sun or both. And now that we are here,
we again spend too much of our time
geeking or doing everything else under
the sun or both in order to make our
selves attractive candidates for whatever
we decide the next step has to be.
Ten weeks under the wire, with one
foot out the door, I learned a skill that
had eluded me for 22 years. In a matter of
hours, I discovered, registered, and rev

eled in the concept of loafing. It was easy
— frighteningly easy.
Take it from me, it doesn't take much
transition time to get used to waking up
every day knowing that there is absolute
ly nothing you have to do. To spend a
week doing exactly what you want to do,
when you want to do it. A week of living
entirely in the moment, rather than
mulling over the past or working your
way towards the future.
People will ask what I did over break,
and I could easily describe the movies I
watched, making a new music mix, run*
ning the Dish, driving down to Monterey,
sitting in the sun all day with a friend and
a bottle of red wine. But to do so would be
to miss the point entirely. Much more rel
evant is what I didn't do — the number
of times I started something and changed
my mind, the way I felt knowing that it
was all up to me.
The beauty of it is, unlike Caribbean
cruises and summer romances, this
experience won't end with the usual
hard return to reality. It is spring. I am
taking eight units. The possibilities are
endless.

Four of Liz's eight units are in fact a class
to help her deal with the fact that Stan
ford is not really reality.
