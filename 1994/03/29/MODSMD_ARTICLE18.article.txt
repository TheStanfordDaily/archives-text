## Symposium explored more than just race in classroom 
### 
ON A POINT of correction: In the
very distorted account of one of
the day's proceedings of our
March 3-5 symposium, "The Two Reser
vations: Western Thought, the Color
Line, and the Crisis of the Negro Intel
lectual Revisited," The Daily misreport
ed Demetrius Eudell's presentation,
"Race, a Crisis of Discourse," by writing
the following:
"Eudell said he disagreed with the
political thrust of [Cornell West's book
["Race Matters"]. He also contested
West's view of affirmative action. West
believes affirmative action is better than
nothing, Eudell said, and that racial ten
sion will return with a vengeance if it is
abolished.
"'Where did [racial tension 1 go, any
way,' asked Eudell. He questioned why
affirmative action is necessary 'when we
don't need it in music, because no one
can compete with Aretha Franklin, and
sports."'
Against this version, I cite the audio
taped version of Eudell's presentation.
"'Given the history of this country,'
West said, 'it's a virtual certainty that
without affirmative action racial and
sexual discrimination will return with a
vengeance.' Yet, where did it go? West

assumes that affirmative action is
designed to reduce what he terms racial
and sexual discrimination. Yet affirma
tive action policies verify the racial hier
archy because it stigmatizes preferential
policies for blacks and other non-white
groups, while naturalizing those for
whites and for the transracial middle
classes. Moreover why is it that black
intellectuals and the middle classes need
affirmative action? We do not have to
have any affirmative action for black
music because no one can compete with
Aretha Franklin. Or in sports, with
respect to Charles Barkley and Michael
Jordan. We (black intellectuals] have to
have affirmative action because we have
not taken over the American intellectual
discourse in the way in which musicians
and athletes have done for their respec
tive areas."
In addition, and as can be seen, the
point that Eudell makes, which was also
the point of the ironic thrust of Patricia
Fox's presentation (also reported out of
context), is quite different from the tan
gential, touch-feely, inter-ethnic-middle
class and campus-parochial issues raised
by a questioner from the floor, tangen
tial issues which The Daily foregrounded
in its report, thereby trivializing the con

cerns raised by the symposium partici
pants.
As both Eudell and Fox, as well as all
the other participants, made clear, the
symposium was not about, as The Daily
reported, "[rlacial inequality" and"the
problem of black intellectuals." Rather it
was about, as Harold Cruse's 1967 book
argued, the failure of black intellectuals
to take our present intellectual discourse
beyond the limits of its present culture
ethnic and Euro-American perspectives.
Since these are perspectives that, as
Cruse also argues, can in no way be
expected to contain the aspirations of
the still subordinated black, red, and
increasingly Latino population groups
(or "races").
Because these are the three popula
tion groups (or "races") whose non-mid
dle class members now find themselves
increasingly expelled beyond what Cruse
called "the fringe of absorption," it is
these groups specifically (and not as the
liberal questioner would have it, "all the
other races"), who are increasingly
excluded, only to be confined on the one
hand, in urban ghetto reservations and
their prison extensions, and, on the
other, in their 19th century prototype,
the American Indian reservations.

In consequence, rather than the issue
being merely that of the "Color Line" in
the classroom (as your headline has it),
the thrust of the symposium was to
explore the exact nature of the relations
that exist, not only between our present
scholarly paradigms and the apartheid
system, social and conceptual, of the
"Color Line," but also between their
"regime of truth"and the crisis of the
institutionally-made jobless, and, there
fore, crime-ridden inner cities; to explore
also the relations between the explanato
ry model of laissez-faire causality provid
ed by our present paradigms, and the
ongoing hysteria of the anti-crime,
"three-strikes you're out" solution, that
is now being put forward to deal with
what is clearly (as President Clinton's
recent conference on the world's own
increasing joblessness shows) a profound
global systemic crisis. A crisis, as was
proposed during the symposium, of
Western thought and, therefore, of our
present economically absolute and tech
no-industrial order of knowledge, or
episteme.

being merely that of the "Color Line" in
the classroom (as your headline has it),
the thrust of the symposium was to
explore the exact nature of the relations
that exist, not only between our present
scholarly paradigms and the apartheid
system, social and conceptual, of the
"Color Line," but also between their
"regime of truth"and the crisis of the
institutionally-made jobless, and, there
fore, crime-ridden inner cities; to explore
also the relations between the explanato
ry model of laissez-faire causality provid
ed by our present paradigms, and the
ongoing hysteria of the anti-crime,
"three-strikes you're out" solution, that
is now being put forward to deal with
what is clearly (as President Clinton's
recent conference on the world's own
increasing joblessness shows) a profound
global systemic crisis. A crisis, as was
proposed during the symposium, of
Western thought and, therefore, of our
present economically absolute and tech
no-industrial order of knowledge, or
episteme.
