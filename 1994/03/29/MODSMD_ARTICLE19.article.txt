Schindler used people as slave labor and

STEVEN SPIELBERG'S latest film,
"Schindler's List," opened last year
to rave reviews and rapturous audi
ence responses. So it came as no surprise
a week ago Monday that his hagiographic
tale of Oskar Schindler took home several
Oscars of its own. It won a total of seven
Academy Awards, including Best Picture
and Best Director — awards that the 47-
year-old director of such films as "The
Color Purple," "Indiana Jones and the
Temple of Doom" and "E.T." had never
won before.
But an explanation for Spielberg's ele
vation from mere entertainer to documen
tarian, historian and social critic — cour
tesy of reviewers, columnists and his
peers — can't be found in the numerous
accolades the film has received. Nor can it
be found in the mindless, fatuous praise
that most reviewers and columnists have
showered upon it.
Few American journalists have
approached "Schindler's List" with the
same critical eye that was turned to
"J.F.K." In 1991, the film was attacked on
the grounds that the liberties writer-direc
tor Oliver Stone took with the facts, com
bined with the documentary style of some

of the footage, would lead gullible viewers
to believe untruths.
As history, the newsreel-like
"Schindler's List" is as problematic as
"J.F.K." Just as Oliver Stone wanted
viewers to believe that Lee Harvey Oswald
did not act alone to kill President
Kennedy, Spielberg wants us to believe
that Schindler evolved from a not-as-good
as-could-be man into a saint. But the facts
don't bear him out.
Since the film doesn't give much of a
sense of events outside Schindler's prison
factory, untutored viewers will never
know that Schindler began his quest to
save lives in the summer of 1944 — after
D-Day, at a point in time when any sane
person on the German side knew the war
was a lost cause. If Schindler was as prag
matic as the record shows, it isn't much of
a stretch to infer that he was trying to
save his own neck at least as much as he
was trying to save "his Jews."
In the film, however, Schindler simply
bellows "They are mine," then schemes to
buy their lives with his blood money.
Spielberg cleverly substitutes egocentric
heroism for egocentric self-preservation —
a sleight-of-hand worthy of Harry Houdi
ni.
When a trainload of Jewish women is
mistakenly sent Auschwitz, we see
Schindler bribe the camp commandant
with diamonds for their release. It's
almost accurate — but Spielberg leaves
out the middlewoman. What actually hap
pened is that Schindler gave one of his
own Jewish secretaries a diamond to
induce her to sleep with the commandant
to win the women's release.
The most egregious factual lapses come

towards the end. First, Spielberg's
Schindler delivers a final address to his
workers before trying to escape the Nazis.
That speech never occurred. As Schindler
prepares to leave the work camp, he
breaks down and cries over not having
saved more people. That emotional out
burst never happened; in fact, Schindler
disappeared into the night without saying
as much as good-bye.
Finally, Spielberg shows Schindler
leaving with nothing more than the
clothes on his back and a fancy car. That
too is inaccurate. The car Schindler left
with was actually packed with precious
jewels. Admittedly, those jewels were sub
sequently stolen from him by looters. Yet
for Spielberg to suggest that Schindler
spent every penny of his ill-gotten gains to
save his Jews is a Peter Pan-like leap of
faith — and simply clapping his hands
won't make it true. All of this from some
one who claimed he felt like a "cinematic
historian" while making the film.
Spielberg's willful disregard for the
facts — in a transparent attempt to sanc
tify his subject — met harsh criticism
from prominent Israeli journalists. In the
daily Jerusalem Post, critic Adina Hoff
man said Spielberg treats the Auschwitz
gas chamber "as if this were the newest
sound stage on his cinematic playground,
no different from the back lot at Univer
sal."
Holocaust expert Tom Segev charged
that "Schindler's List" masquerades as a
documentary because Spielberg filmed it
in black and white. Segev dubbed the film
"Holocaust Park" (referring to Spielberg's
blockbuster "Jurassic Park"), called the
Auschwitz sequence "pornography" and

said, "Spielberg needs the Holocaust, but
the Holocaust does not need Spielberg."
Even 73-year-old Josef Bau, one of the
Schindler]uden whose marriage at the
Plaszow work camp in Poland is
portrayed in the film, lauded Spielberg's
direction, "but shook his head over the
film's historical accuracy," according to
the London Times. Back in the United
States, however, these reactions were
largely ignored — except for Time maga
zine, where Richard Corliss described
them as "antithetical, politically heretical
opinions."
Why would Spielberg show a children's
playground with swings? There never was
one in the camp. Why does he have to show
so many children in the Plaszov camp as
late as May 1944? There were only .03 per
cent of the children left, and they tried to be
invisible, as did the old people?
—Miriam Nick, a survivor of the Cracow
ghetto, the Plaszov camp and six other
concentration camps
Almost every distortion or alteration
that Spielberg makes to the historical
record is designed to completely rehabili
tate Oskar Schindler, to make a saint out
of an amoral man who did one good thing
in his life by rescuing those he exploited,
out of extremely questionable motives.
Spielberg movies need clear-cut heroes,
and "Schindler's List" is no exception.
But he didn't have to exert his creative
faculties to fmd a true hero amidst the
horror of the Holocaust. Chiune Sugihara,
the Japanese consul in Lithuania in 1940,
saved as many as 6,000 Jews by writing
them exit visas to Japan against the

express refusal of the Japanese govern
ment. As far as we know, there is no evi
dence that Sugihara exploited those peo
ple, then got religion and saved them to
save himself. Despite his country's
alliance with Germany, he immediately
put himself on the line to help entire fami
lies of Jews to safety.
No sellout, no movie deal.
We shouldn't be surprised then, that
Nazi collaborator Paul Touvier, the first
Frenchman to be brought to justice for
crimes against humanity, claims himself
innocent. Why? The 78-year-old former
intelligence chief of the French militia in
occupied Lyon, accused of killing seven of
100 Jews in June 1944, says that he
selected the execution victims under
duress and managed to spare 93 other
Jewish prisoners from execution. It's been
dubbed the "Schindler defense."
And why not? If as the Talmud-quoting
ads for "Schindler's List" suggest that
"He who saves one life, saves the world
entire," and Schindler's active participa
tion in the Nazi death machine can be
excused by saving 1,100 Jews, then surely,
if Touvier speaks the truth, he too can be
forgiven.
For if the truth can be so casually
twisted, in order for a man as base as
Schindler to be consecrated in an epic Hol
lywood motion picture — which pundits
and government officials urge schoolchil
dren to see as part of their history classes
— clearly "Touvier's List" is not that far
behind.

Schindler used people as slave labor and
made money off of them. I'm not minimiz

Schindler to be consecrated in an epic Hol

Schindler used people as slave labor and
made money off of them. I'm not minimiz

STEVEN SPIELBERG'S latest film,
"Schindler's List," opened last year
to rave reviews and rapturous audi
ence responses. So it came as no surprise
a week ago Monday that his hagiographic
tale of Oskar Schindler took home several
Oscars of its own. It won a total of seven
Academy Awards, including Best Picture
and Best Director — awards that the 47-
year-old director of such films as "The
Color Purple," "Indiana Jones and the
Temple of Doom" and "E.T." had never
won before.
But an explanation for Spielberg's ele
vation from mere entertainer to documen
tarian, historian and social critic — cour
tesy of reviewers, columnists and his
peers — can't be found in the numerous
accolades the film has received. Nor can it
be found in the mindless, fatuous praise
that most reviewers and columnists have
showered upon it.
Few American journalists have
approached "Schindler's List" with the
same critical eye that was turned to
"J.F.K." In 1991, the film was attacked on
the grounds that the liberties writer-direc
tor Oliver Stone took with the facts, com
bined with the documentary style of some

of the footage, would lead gullible viewers
to believe untruths.
As history, the newsreel-like
"Schindler's List" is as problematic as
"J.F.K." Just as Oliver Stone wanted
viewers to believe that Lee Harvey Oswald
did not act alone to kill President
Kennedy, Spielberg wants us to believe
that Schindler evolved from a not-as-good
as-could-be man into a saint. But the facts
don't bear him out.
Since the film doesn't give much of a
sense of events outside Schindler's prison
factory, untutored viewers will never
know that Schindler began his quest to
save lives in the summer of 1944 — after
D-Day, at a point in time when any sane
person on the German side knew the war
was a lost cause. If Schindler was as prag
matic as the record shows, it isn't much of
a stretch to infer that he was trying to
save his own neck at least as much as he
was trying to save "his Jews."
In the film, however, Schindler simply
bellows "They are mine," then schemes to
buy their lives with his blood money.
Spielberg cleverly substitutes egocentric
heroism for egocentric self-preservation —
a sleight-of-hand worthy of Harry Houdi
ni.
When a trainload of Jewish women is
mistakenly sent Auschwitz, we see
Schindler bribe the camp commandant
with diamonds for their release. It's
almost accurate — but Spielberg leaves
out the middlewoman. What actually hap
pened is that Schindler gave one of his
own Jewish secretaries a diamond to
induce her to sleep with the commandant
to win the women's release.
The most egregious factual lapses come

towards the end. First, Spielberg's
Schindler delivers a final address to his
workers before trying to escape the Nazis.
That speech never occurred. As Schindler
prepares to leave the work camp, he
breaks down and cries over not having
saved more people. That emotional out
burst never happened; in fact, Schindler
disappeared into the night without saying
as much as good-bye.
Finally, Spielberg shows Schindler
leaving with nothing more than the
clothes on his back and a fancy car. That
too is inaccurate. The car Schindler left
with was actually packed with precious
jewels. Admittedly, those jewels were sub
sequently stolen from him by looters. Yet
for Spielberg to suggest that Schindler
spent every penny of his ill-gotten gains to
save his Jews is a Peter Pan-like leap of
faith — and simply clapping his hands
won't make it true. All of this from some
one who claimed he felt like a "cinematic
historian" while making the film.
Spielberg's willful disregard for the
facts — in a transparent attempt to sanc
tify his subject — met harsh criticism
from prominent Israeli journalists. In the
daily Jerusalem Post, critic Adina Hoff
man said Spielberg treats the Auschwitz
gas chamber "as if this were the newest
sound stage on his cinematic playground,
no different from the back lot at Univer
sal."
Holocaust expert Tom Segev charged
that "Schindler's List" masquerades as a
documentary because Spielberg filmed it
in black and white. Segev dubbed the film
"Holocaust Park" (referring to Spielberg's
blockbuster "Jurassic Park"), called the
Auschwitz sequence "pornography" and

said, "Spielberg needs the Holocaust, but
the Holocaust does not need Spielberg."
Even 73-year-old Josef Bau, one of the
Schindler]uden whose marriage at the
Plaszow work camp in Poland is
portrayed in the film, lauded Spielberg's
direction, "but shook his head over the
film's historical accuracy," according to
the London Times. Back in the United
States, however, these reactions were
largely ignored — except for Time maga
zine, where Richard Corliss described
them as "antithetical, politically heretical
opinions."
Why would Spielberg show a children's
playground with swings? There never was
one in the camp. Why does he have to show
so many children in the Plaszov camp as
late as May 1944? There were only .03 per
cent of the children left, and they tried to be
invisible, as did the old people?
—Miriam Nick, a survivor of the Cracow
ghetto, the Plaszov camp and six other
concentration camps
Almost every distortion or alteration
that Spielberg makes to the historical
record is designed to completely rehabili
tate Oskar Schindler, to make a saint out
of an amoral man who did one good thing
in his life by rescuing those he exploited,
out of extremely questionable motives.
Spielberg movies need clear-cut heroes,
and "Schindler's List" is no exception.
But he didn't have to exert his creative
faculties to fmd a true hero amidst the
horror of the Holocaust. Chiune Sugihara,
the Japanese consul in Lithuania in 1940,
saved as many as 6,000 Jews by writing
them exit visas to Japan against the

express refusal of the Japanese govern
ment. As far as we know, there is no evi
dence that Sugihara exploited those peo
ple, then got religion and saved them to
save himself. Despite his country's
alliance with Germany, he immediately
put himself on the line to help entire fami
lies of Jews to safety.
No sellout, no movie deal.
We shouldn't be surprised then, that
Nazi collaborator Paul Touvier, the first
Frenchman to be brought to justice for
crimes against humanity, claims himself
innocent. Why? The 78-year-old former
intelligence chief of the French militia in
occupied Lyon, accused of killing seven of
100 Jews in June 1944, says that he
selected the execution victims under
duress and managed to spare 93 other
Jewish prisoners from execution. It's been
dubbed the "Schindler defense."
And why not? If as the Talmud-quoting
ads for "Schindler's List" suggest that
"He who saves one life, saves the world
entire," and Schindler's active participa
tion in the Nazi death machine can be
excused by saving 1,100 Jews, then surely,
if Touvier speaks the truth, he too can be
forgiven.
For if the truth can be so casually
twisted, in order for a man as base as

lywood motion picture — which pundits
and government officials urge schoolchil
