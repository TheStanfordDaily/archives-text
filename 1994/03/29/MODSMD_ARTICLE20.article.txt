## Muscle and mayhem in the paint Anita Kaplan and Rachel Hemmer give Cardinal bruising inside game 
### Joe Bialowitz Staff writer 
Those unfamiliar with this season's
Stanford women's basketball team
might, on initial exposure to the goings
on of the team, have become confused
by the apparently odd lingo of the aver
age Cardinal fan.
Indeed, many conversations inside
Maples Pavilion this season were often
sprinkled with what sounded like refer
ences to a mysterious Stanford player
called "Rachelandanita."
Yet just as many of us justifiably sus
pect that "Kilroy" is really Michael Jor
dan, it was readily apparent to most
that "Rachelandanita" was really a
clause used to describe Stanford's two
most dominating post-up players:
Rachel Hemmer and Anita Kaplan.
Those who did not know of this, how
ever, could not be blamed for their igno
rance. After all, it was Hemmer and
Kaplan who composed almost the entire
Cardinal attack under the basket.
Together they combined to average 30
points and 14 rebounds per game dur
ing the regular season.
The successful exploits of Hemmer
and Kaplan figured prominently in the
surprising 25-6 final record of the
young Stanford team.
As Stanford head coach Tara Van-
Derveer put it, "We depend a lot on
them; it's not a big secret."
VanDerveer isn't the only head coach
to realize the importance of "Rachelan
danita" to the Cardinal squad.
"Physically, Kaplan and Hemmer are
that same caliber of player as Dana
Johnson of Tennessee," said University
of Montana head coach Robin Selvig.
His Grizzlies were victimized by John
son's dominating play in their first
game of the season, and were subdued
by Hemmer's 16 points and clutch play
down the stretch during a 66-62 second
round Cardinal victory that was Mon
tana's last game of the season.
But the real reason so many people
think of Anita when they think of
Rachel and vice-versa is the way the two
juniors play when they're simultane
ously on the court.

"I would compare the way Anita and
I play together to how Val [Whitingl
and I played together," Hemmer said.
"Or at the risk of sounding arrogant,
maybe I'd go as far back as Ralph Samp
son and in the sense that
Anita is a great low block scorer and she
works hard."
Hemmer's passing skills allowed
Kaplan ample opportunity to convert
from short-range.
"I do as best I can to get Anita the
ball and she does a great job of finishing
when I do get her the ball," Hemmer
said.

'Teams can't stop me or
Anita one on one on the
low block.'

Their style of play is most notably
marked by a "high-low" type game in
which Hemmer receives the ball in the
high post and then looks to pass it over
the defense and into the hands of
Kaplan in the low post. This strategy
has proven effective for several reasons.
"Teams can't stop me or Anita one
on one on the low block," Hemmer said.
"If we're playing a two post offense and
we're both on the low block, teams are
able to double us a lot easier. When I go
high, they can't double as well."
And the man to man coverage leaves
Kaplan open for a pass and Hemmer
ready for an assist.
"When Rachel gets the ball in the
high post, she can either shoot or lob
pass it into me," Kaplan t;aid. "She's a
great lobber."
According to forward Kate Starbird,
"Anita is a great target, she has good
hands, you get her the ball, she turns
around, and she makes the shot most of
the time."
But "Rachelandanita" is also a term
that can be heard while the two players
are on defense.
"We complement each other really
well on ofTense and defense," Kaplan

said.
For example, Hemmer was able to
help Kaplan limit USC's Naismith
Award candidate Lisa Leslie to a sea
son-low eight points on Feb. 24, a game
in which Kaplan also scored a career
high 34 points.
"When Anita had Lisa Leslie she
ended up having to really match up on
her," Hemmer said. "So I helped her a
lot by doubling down on Leslie."
That night, Hemmer became the
17th player in Stanford scoring history
to reach 1,000 points for her career.
That same week Kaplan was named
Sports Illustrated Player of the Week
after she scored 20 more points against
UCLA.
What made Kaplan's consistent suc
cess so remarkable was that she played
through pain for the entire season. A
herniated disc combined with a congen
ital condition called spinal stenosis
meant that not only was her back often
in pain, but she was also vulnerable to
spontaneous muscle cramps caused by,
among other things, cold drafts.
Kaplan's teammates appreciated her
persistence despite this difficulty.
"Anita plays with a lot of heart
because she is in pain and she still gives
everything to the team," said freshman
Tara Harrington. "I know she's hurting
and I should be able to play through any
pain if I ever have any."
Hemmer's emotion also makes her a
role model for the younger players.
"Rachel gets us excited as a team.
She's the model of emotion that we're
supposed to show," Starbird said.
So when the Cardinal women's bas
ketball team lost to Purdue in last Sat
urday night's NCAA Western Regional
final, it was glaringly apparent that the
loss could have been avoided had Stan
ford's two scoring and rebounding lead
ers not been sitting on the bench for so
long, the victims of foul trouble.
With Hemmer and Kaplan out, Bob
bie Kelsey, Starbird, Harrington —
none of whom are taller than 6 feet 2 —
simply could not fill the huge void left in
the paint.

Cardinal forward Rachel Hemmer goes in for a layup against Oregon as teammate Anita
Kaplan looks on. The two juniors combined to give Stanford a powerful inside punch.
"Tara IHarringtonJ did a real
ly good job for us, but was not as
big as any of the other players
like Purdue's Leslie Johnson,"
Kaplan said.
Stanford's lack of post position
depth behind Kaplan and Hem
mer was in part caused by an
early season injury to freshman
forward Vanessa Nygaard. Knee
surgery to repair a torn ACL
forced VanDerveer to red-shirt
Nygaard and thus lose her valu

able services.
Fortunately for the Cardinal,
help is on the way. When Hem
mer and Kaplan return next year,
they will be joined by a support
ing cast that will include not only
Nygaard, but also six incoming
recruits who are all 6 feet and
above.
"I'm not saying I'm looking
forward, but we need the people
that we have coming in," Van-
Derveer said. "They'll help us on
the inside."
The new additions could be
just the help "Rachelandanita"
need to take Stanford to a nation
al championship.
