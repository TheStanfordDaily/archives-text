## Fuerbringer's 40 kills can't stop Mastodons 
### Kathryn Yang Staff writer 
After dropping a disappoint
ing three-game contest to the
top-ranked UCLA Bruins two
weeks ago, the Stanford volley
ball squad took its act on the
road last week in hopes of better
fortune.
Despite punishing Ohio State

15-8, 15-9, 15-
10 Wednesday, a
sweep was not in
the cards, as the
Cardinal (12-7)
succumbed to
host Indiana at
the Indiana-
Purdue Fort
Wayne Tourna
ment.
After polish
ing off Ball
State, 15-6, 11-
15, 17-15, 15-9
in the first
round of the
tournament,
Stanford ran
into a 14-16, 15-
9, 11-15, 4-15

roadblock
against IPFW (13-5).
"We sided-out pretty well and
put together a good game, but
IPFW just outplayed us," said
head coach Ruben Nieves. "It's
tough playing on the road, and
we would have liked to win three,
but one loss is not going to rattle
us."
Especially if that one loss
came despite a tremendous 40-
kill attack from Cardinal oppo
site hitter Matt Fuerbringer.
The sophomore also improved
upon his team-high hitting per
centage, swinging a cool .460
against IPFW.
At the net freshman middle
blocker Brian Moore made every
bit of his 6-foot-8 frame stand
out on defense with six total kills
in a little more than two games'
worth of playing time.
Nevertheless, those numbers
crumbled under the pressure of
IPFW's attack. Starting from the
service line, the Mastodons sur
prised Stanford with 12 aces,
including four perfect float
serves from Craig Collins.
"Even though they beat us,
they're not a better team than
us," said senior setter Canyon
Ceman. "We have the talent to
beat anyone in the nation, but
we just have to get better."
That talent shined through

'I think overall we
played really well. We
were poised under
pressure, and we
learned to play
together as a team.
That was one of our
major goals during
the road trip.'

against the Buckeyes earlier, as
the Fuerbringer-Moore duo
paced Stanford to the three
game sweep.
Fuerbringer left the Ohio
State blockers dazed at the net
with 18 kills and a sparkling .682
average, while Moore stepped up
with 12 blocks to lead all defend
ers.
Behind the handy victory the

box scores
reported, Stan
ford did strug
gle a bit in the
second game.
Freshman
swing hitter
Aaron Garcia,
however, came
off the bench to
steady the Car
dinal and secure
the victory.
" We
dominated Ohio
State with our
'tall' lineup
(where every
one on the court
is 6-feet-5 and
above)," Ceman

said. "We had a
little passing slump in game two,
but we pulled out of it without
any problems."
It was pretty much the same
story against Ball State (20-6).
The only difficulty Stanford
encountered against the Cardi
nals was during the second
game, when Ball State rattled off
eight consecutive points to sal
vage one of the four games.
"I think overall we played
really well," said sophomore
swing hitter Mike Lambert. "We
were poised under pressure, and
we learned to play together as a
team. That was one of our major
goals during the road trip."
That poise and confidence will
be put to the test on Wednesday
as first-place USC storms into
Burnham Pavilion. Tied with the
Trojans in the loss column, the
match will be crucial in deciding
the final Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation standings.
Earlier this season, USC handed
Stanford a 15-10, 13-15, 15-10,
15-12 heartbreak in Southern
California, but the Cardinal is
counting on the home field
advantage to sweep past the Tro
jans this time.
"We're a good road team, but
we're even better at home,"
Nieves said. "Playing at Burn
ham gives us that extra edge."
