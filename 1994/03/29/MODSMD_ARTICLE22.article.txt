# Wrestling finishes strong at NCAAs
## Jackson and Surmon narrowly miss All-American honors at UNC 
### Allyson Mizoguchi Staff writer 
Far away from home and school, Cardinal
wrestlers Jay Jackson and Tod Surmon were
veiy close to winning All-American honors at
the NCAA Championships held at Chapel Hill
just before spring break.
Although the two athletes barely qualified
for the tournament, having won wild cards at

the Pacific 10 Conference Championships last
month, both turned in extremely strong per
formances. Head coach Chris Horpel hopes
their achievements will show the road to
NCAAs is just as tough as Nationals them
selves.
"[Surmon and Jacksonl were very competi
tive and could've easily been All-Americans,
which is really a year earlier than I'd
assumed," Horpel said, referring to the inex-

perience the team has battled all year.
The tournament featured 330 of the best
wrestlers representing 84 of the country's
Division I wrestling programs. Each bracket
held a berth of talent, numbering approxi
mately 32 athletes.
Coming away with a ninth-place finish at
the tournament, junior co-captain Jackson
went 2-2 and finished only one
place shy from being named Ail-
American.
The 134-pounder began by
drawing defending national cham
pion T.J. Jaworsky of North Car
olina, who he lost to 6-0. Because
Jaworsky advanced to the quarter
finals, Jackson was able to wrestle
in the consolation bracket.
In consolation, Jackson contin
ued to compete against opponents
with impressive distinctions. Jack
son picked up a 1-0 win after
wrestling Mike Yancosky of Cor
nell, who is third in the Eastern
Intercollegiate Wrestling Associa
tion. Following the victory, he
drew Jason Nase of Rider, ranked
first in the East Coast Wrestling
Association and won 6-2.
Jackson lost his final match to
Eric Kimble of Ohio 8-3. Kimble

finished seventh, while Jaworsky
won the weight division.
Although Jackson fell short of
the top eight places, Horpel
believes that he will be given Hon
orable Mention All-American hon
ors, a title that will later lie deter
mined.
Surmon, a 150-pound sopho
more, finished his season 13th in
the nation after going 1-2 at the
tournament. Following a loss to
Terry Watts of Fresno State, Sur
mon upset Willy Short of Minneso
ta, ranked second in the Big 10
Conference, 6-2.
Surmon's last match of the sea
son was a 7-4 loss to Chad Bailey of
Bloomsbury, who was seeded tenth
at the tournament and ranked first
in the Eastern Wrestling League.
Bailey later finished seventh. Sur
mon finished only two victories
away from All-American honors.
Although the regular season
has ended, the wrestlers continue
to train for several upcoming tour
naments in the spring. Three

major national competitions — the
National Open, the University
Nationals and the Espoir Nation
als — are held in April. Champions
of these tourneys travel to such
esteemed competitions as the Pan-
Americas.
As with all ofT-season tourna
ments, the wrestlers will compete
in freestyle rather than the famil
iar college style. This requires a
slight change in the practice regi
men, but Horpel noted that the
same basic skills apply to both
styles.
Horpel looks to next year with
the same high expectations,
although he anticipates more
upperclass leadership and experi
ence. Hopefully the added years of
wrestling knowledge will help to
reduce the number of injuries the
Cardinal faced this season.
"It was a tough season with
injuries and inexperience, but it
finished on a very positive note,"
Horpel said. "I feel good about
that."
