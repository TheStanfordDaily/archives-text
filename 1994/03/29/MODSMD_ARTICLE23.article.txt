# Synchro swims to third in Championships
## 
### Kyle Graham Staff writer 
While the Stanford men's and
women's swimming teams added
to their already impressive strings
of national titles over spring break,
the Cardinal synchronized swim
ming team had an even longer
streak of excellence snapped —
though just barely.
The synchro squad's third

place finish in the National Cham
pionships, held Saturday in Can
ton, Ohio, ended a series of seven
consecutive second-place finishes
at the national tournament.
That's the bad news. But the good
news is that coaches and players
alike viewed the Championships as
a positive end to a successful sea
son.
"I think that the season went
really well. ... It was different for

different routines, but mostly the
season was a refining process for
our routines, and they were per
formed well (at the National
Championships)," said senior
Kristna Evans.
The team's solid showing was
buttressed by the naming of two
Stanford swimmers, sophomores
Bridget Finn and Julie Davies, as
All-Americans based on their per
formances at the Championships.

As a whole, the Cardinal team
finished behind one of the two
Ohio State squads to compete as
well as a "team" of three U.S.
National Team members, which
constituted a California squad.
Cardinal coaches discounted
the Cal team's showing, however,
claiming that the shorthanded
squad was constituted of "ringers"
who dominated the events in
which they competed. "It's sort of
a sham to say that they swam for
Cal," said assistant coach Andy
Maisel. "They don't go to Cal
practices [or anything]. They do
attend Cal, though, so they com
peted."
The three Golden Bears — Jill
Savery, Margot Thien and Tina
Kasid — drowned their oppo
nents in the trio, duet and solo
events, offsetting their absence
from the team competition. The
tandem of Savery and Thien
trounced two pairings from Ohio
State to take the doubles title;
Savery also took the solo crown.
Overall, Savery garnered the
meet's "High-Point" Award,
given to the swimmer who accu
mulates the largest total of points
in the Championships.
Stanford earned its points by
placing all 10 of its routines in the
Championship finals, outdistanc
ing participants from most of the
20 other schools competing.
The Cardinal's eight-member

squad snared a second-place show
ing in the team event, sandwiched
between the Ohio State "A" team,
which took first place, and the
Buckeyes' "B" team's third-place
finish. Maisel viewed the team's
showing as the successful culmi
nation of a season's efforts.
"We hadn't beaten either of
the two Ohio State teams in four
years, so we viewed our success
there as a solid achievement," he
said.
"I think that the thing that the
team was happiest about was the
placement of the team routine.
That, and beating the Ohio State
"B" team, [were] the main focus
of all of our practices," added
freshman Maia Young.
Stanford's trios of Finn, senior
Georgia Bauman and sophomore
Jen Graves and that of junior
Debbie Downes, Evans and fresh
man Amy Markezich finished
fifth and sixth, respectively; in
the duets category, the teaming of
Davies and Finn finished sixth,
Bauman and Downes eighth.
With its third-place finish, the
Stanford team qualified for the
U.S. Senior National and the
National Team trials, both to be
held next month in Santa Clara.
