# Synchro swims to third in Championships
## 
### Kyle Graham Staff writer 
While the Stanford men's and
women's swimming teams added
to their already impressive strings
of national titles over spring break,
the Cardinal synchronized swim
ming team had an even longer
streak of excellence snapped â€”
though just barely.
The synchro squad's third

place finish in the National Cham
pionships, held Saturday in Can
ton, Ohio, ended a series of seven
consecutive second-place finishes
at the national tournament.
That's the bad news. But the good
news is that coaches and players
alike viewed the Championships as
a positive end to a successful sea
son.
"I think that the season went
really well. ... It was different for

different routines, but mostly the
season was a refining process for
our routines, and they were per
formed well (at the National
Championships)," said senior
Kristna Evans.
The team's solid showing was
buttressed by the naming of two
Stanford swimmers, sophomores
Bridget Finn and Julie Davies, as
All-Americans based on their per
formances at the Championships.

As a whole, the Cardinal team
finished behind one of the two
Ohio State squads to compete as
well as a "team" of three U.S.
National Team members, which
constituted a California squad.
Cardinal coaches discounted
the Cal team's showing, however,
claiming that the shorthanded
squad was constituted of "ringers"
