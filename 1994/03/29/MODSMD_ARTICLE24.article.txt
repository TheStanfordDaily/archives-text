# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
Winning a national championship is a goal
of every collegiate athlete. Winning two would
seem like a dream come true, something only
a handful of people have attained. So what
would winning three national championships
feel like?
Ask Brian Retterer and Jenny Thompson,
members of Stanford's men's and women's

swimming teams. The two led their respective
squads to third straight national titles. For
their efforts, Retterer and Thompson have
dutifully earned the recognition of Athletes of
the Week.
Retterer, a junior, tallied 60 of the Cardi
nal's 157 points on the first day of competi
tion. He started off with a blazing 18.67 split
time in the 200 freestyle relay en route to set
ting a new American record of 1:16.93. Retter
er then won the 50 free in 19.49 as well as the
100 backstroke and was a key member in the
200 medley relay and the 400 medley relay,
both of which took first place.
What makes Retterer's achievements so
remarkable is that he was forced to redshirt
last season due to an injured shoulder. While
he remained a member of that year's champi
onship team, he was unable to compete due to
the iryury.

Thompson, also a junior, put together
almost as an impressive weekend as Retterer.
Gathering 57 points over the three-day com
petition, Thompson was the second-highest
overall scorer, behind USC's Christine
Quance.
The Olympian started her championship
run with a second-place finish in the 50
freestyle, as she was narrowly edged by Col
orado State's Amy Van Dyken, who set an
NCAA and pool record. Undaunted by her
defeat at the hands of Van Dyken, Thomp

son s split time in the 200 freestyle relay was
.06 second faster than Van Dyken's record-set
ting time.
1 hompson then rattled off two individual
first-place finishes, garnering the top spot in
the 100 butterfly and 100 freestyle. Thompson
was also a member of the first-place 200 med
ley relay and the 400 freestyle relay
