# A
						meet that 'ran smoothly'
## Track strides out in Stanford Festival 
### Jorge Chen 
Tenths of seconds and fractions of inches
were all that this weekend's winners needed
to edge out their competitors in the Stanford
Festival, held at Stanford Stadium last Friday
and Saturday.
In a weekend marked by numerous Cardi
nal victories, one of Stanford's highlights
came from Dave Popejoy, the 1992 Pacific 10
Conference champion in the hammer, with a
first place and season best toss of 225 feet
and 1 inch. Along with Popejoy, senior Deb
Templeton won the hammer on the women's
side with a meet record toss of 173' 7".
Another Cardinal first came from the
women's distance medley relay. All-American
Louise Watson led the team to an 11 minute,
49.09 second first place. Junior co-captain
Christy Boyd ran for a second-place finish in
the 400 meter hurdles with a time of 1:02.40.
Freshman Brian Manning surprised him
self as well as his competitors as he lept for a
49' 11 1/4" in the triple jump, good for a sec
ond-place showing.
"This was a great meet, the weather and
the competition were perfect," he said. "It
gave me a good opportunity to see where I
stand in the Pac-10. I was really pleased with

my performance with a huge improvement in
the triple jump from a 48' 9"."
Other impressive outings included senior
co-captain Jen McCormick's launching of the
javelin for a third-place finish with 157* 11".
The Stanford women's 400 meter relay also
captured third place with a time of 47.72.
As the meet was open to both collegiate and
professional athletes, former Cardinal ath
letes also turned in notable performances this
weekend. Chryste Gaines, the 1992 NCAA
champion in the 100 meter outdoor and 55
meter indoor races, sprinted for a time of
11.78 seconds in the 100 meters to capture
first place.
Gaines' former teammate Jackie Edwards
(1992 NCAA long jump champ and currently a
member of the National U.S. Olympic team)
earned a victory in the long jump with a leap
of 20' 1 1/2" and second in the triple jump
with a mark of 41' 2 1/3".
Ceci St. Geme, another Stanford alumni,
finished first with a comfortable lead in a time
of 16:11.27 in the women's 5,000 meters and
second in the 1,500 meters with 4:18.50.
Geme earned the 1983 NCAA crown in the
3,000 meters as a freshman at Stanford.
While the Cardinal athletes faced numer
ous challenges on the track, the logistics

involved in organizing such a large scale meet
proved an additional test, according to assis
tant coach and meet director Betsy Riccardi.
"Our Stanford team is very unique because
they are so altruistic," she said. "Many ath
letes gave their best on and off the field by
working hard on their performance and run
ning the meet. Most worked out in the rain for
two and a half hours on Thursday and set up
afterwards and still competed the next day
without any resistance. The meet would have
not been possible without them."
Pleased with the team's overall perfor
mance, Riccardi made a point of mentioning
junior triple jumper Florence Adu as a partic
ular asset to the squad.
"We have such a range of inspirational ath
letes in our team and one of them has to be
Florence Adu," Riccardi said. "She is the clas
sical developmental athlete. All of us look up
to her â€” Adu has been the most improved ath
lete I have ever seen in my life."
Of the meet in general, Riccardi expressed
equal satisfaction.
"From the singing of the national anthem by
Chryste Gaines, which I must add definitely
rivaled Whitney Houston, to the concluding
men's mile relay, the meet ran smoothly," she
said.
