# No. 3 tennis tops fifth-ranked Golden Bears
## Shasby returns to singles action 
### Rob Ross Senior staff writer 
Rebounding after its first loss
of the season, the No. 3-ranked
Stanford women's tennis team
relied on strong doubles play to
defeat No. 5 California in the first
Stanford women's home dual
match ever to start under the
lights.
The match, played last
Wednesday night at the Stanford
Tennis Stadium, saw these two
rivals battle to a 3-3 tie after the
six singles matches. But the Car
dinal (16-1) won two of the three
doubles match-ups to clinch 5-3
and was ahead in the third when
the meet was stopped at 11:30, six
and one half hours after it began.
The marathon began with the
bottom six singles players, and
Stanford took an early 2-1 advan
tage. In her singles debut this sea
son, sophomore Kim Shasby
defeated Cal's Nicole Elliot 6-4, 6-
2 at the No. 4 slot.
Shasby has been hampered all
season by a foot injury and had
been practicing only intermittent
ly until recently. After having
played most of the season at No. 3
singles last year, expectations
were that she would step into the
No. 2 slot before the injury. In
fact, she was ranked sixth in the
preseason polls, the second high
est rated Cardinal behind Lax mi
Poruri. A regaining of pre-injury
form would allow Stanford coach
Frank Brennan to bump five of his
six singles players down a slot,
thereby greatly strengthening his
already imposing lineup.
At No. 6 singles freshman San
dra De Silva was again
indomitable. She crushed Valerie
Poulos 6-0, 6-3 to give Stanford a
2-0 lead and raise her individual
record to 17-0.
No. 5 singles, though, was a dis
aster for the Cardinal. Sophomore
Beth Berris, who usually plays No.
4 but was bumped down because
of Shasby's return, faced the
Bears' Kiersten Alley and was
mugged 6-1, 6-0 in her worst
defeat of the season.
"Beth didn't play well at all,"
Brennan said, "she just never got
started."
Kristine Kurth, the Cardinal's

No. 2 singles player and a senior
All-American, met with similar
luck. She was mowed down by
Cal's Pam Nelson 6-0, 6-1. Nelson
is currently ranked 19th in the
nation.
The last two singles matches,
Nos. 1 and 3, both went three sets,
and each had different results.
Poruri, ranked second in the coun
try, faced the Bears' Vera Vitels
and snatched up the first and third
sets 6-2 and 6-0, but dropped the
middle set 4-6 at No. 1 singles.
"I lost the second set by a cou
ple points that didn't go my way,"
Poruri said. "I then came out real
ly strong in the third."
Cardinal freshman Katie
Schlukebir also split her first two
sets at No. 3 singles, but then lost
the third and the match to Jen
nifer Poulos. Both of the first two
sets went to a tie-breaker, but
Poulos was the stronger of the two
in the third, winning 6-3.
In doubles play, Stanford
shined. The No. 3 team of Shas
by/Emily Burt took the court and,
according to Brennan, "was invin
cible right from the beginning."
The duo wore down the Bears'
Poulos sisters and won convinc
ingly 6-1, 6-2.
The clinching match was at No.
2 doubles. The pair of
Kurth/Berris brought their sub
par play from singles into doubles
for the first set, losing 6-2 to the
Elliot/Vitels team. But these two
regrouped and won the second set
6-2, which was the first set either
had won all night. The third set
was hard fought, but Stanford pre
vailed 6-4 to clinch the dual match.
The Cardinal's No. 1 doubles
team of Poruri/Schlukebir won
their first set 6-3 and was winning
the second 2-0 when the match
was called. This undefeated pair is
ranked eighth in the country while
their opponents, Nelson and Alley,
are ranked third.
In the new national team rank
ings, the Cardinal dropped from
second to third after its loss to
Florida three weeks ago. The
Gators hold down the No. 2 spot
while the top-ranked team in the
country is Georgia, which will host
the NCAA National Champi
onships in May.

started."
Kristine Kurth, the Cardinal's

No. 2 singles player and a senior
All-American, met with similar
luck. She was mowed down by
Cal's Pam Nelson 6-0, 6-1. Nelson
is currently ranked 19th in the
nation.
The last two singles matches,
Nos. 1 and 3, both went three sets,
and each had different results.
Poruri, ranked second in the coun
try, faced the Bears' Vera Vitels
and snatched up the first and third
sets 6-2 and 6-0, but dropped the
middle set 4-6 at No. 1 singles.
"I lost the second set by a cou
ple points that didn't go my way,"
Poruri said. "I then came out real
ly strong in the third."
Cardinal freshman Katie
Schlukebir also split her first two
sets at No. 3 singles, but then lost
the third and the match to Jen
nifer Poulos. Both of the first two
sets went to a tie-breaker, but
Poulos was the stronger of the two
in the third, winning 6-3.
In doubles play, Stanford
shined. The No. 3 team of Shas
by/Emily Burt took the court and,
according to Brennan, "was invin
cible right from the beginning."
The duo wore down the Bears'
Poulos sisters and won convinc
ingly 6-1, 6-2.
The clinching match was at No.
2 doubles. The pair of
Kurth/Berris brought their sub
par play from singles into doubles
for the first set, losing 6-2 to the
Elliot/Vitels team. But these two
regrouped and won the second set
6-2, which was the first set either
had won all night. The third set
was hard fought, but Stanford pre
vailed 6-4 to clinch the dual match.
The Cardinal's No. 1 doubles
team of Poruri/Schlukebir won
their first set 6-3 and was winning
the second 2-0 when the match
was called. This undefeated pair is
ranked eighth in the country while
their opponents, Nelson and Alley,
are ranked third.
In the new national team rank
ings, the Cardinal dropped from
second to third after its loss to
Florida three weeks ago. The
Gators hold down the No. 2 spot
while the top-ranked team in the
country is Georgia, which will host
the NCAA National Champi
onships in May.
