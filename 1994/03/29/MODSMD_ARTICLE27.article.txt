# Gymnastics takes fourth in Pac-10
## Women look toward regionals 
### Vanessa Arrington Staff writer 
While many Stanford stu
dents worked up a sweat by frol
icking in the sun or relaxing by
a fire over spring break, practice
and two meets made the Cardi
nal women gymnasts perspire.
The Stanford team recovered
from a three-point loss to
Brigham Young University on
March 19 and pulled together to
receive their highest score of
the season at Pacific 10 Confer
ence Championships in Seattle
on March 26.
At the BYU meet, the Cougars
dominated, capturing the top
three places on both vault and
floor. Yet the Cardinal team
stuck all of its vaults and received
its highest score of the season on
this event. Junior Jen 6 Elzie took
third place on the bars with a
9.725 and sophomore Hillary
Anderson snatched first place on
the beam with a 9.800. The beam
was the one event that Stanford
won. In the all-around, Elzie tied
BYU's Elisabeth Crandell for
third place.
In Seattle, Stanford placed
fourth overall out of the seven
top-notch Pac-10 schools with a
191.550. Oregon State took first
with a 194.825, followed by
UCLA and Arizona State. Stan
ford beat out the teams from
Washington, Arizona and Cali
fornia, a rival the Cardinal lost to
twice during the regular season.
"We had a really strong meet
and showed that we are a fin
ishing team," said Stanford
head coach Breck Greenwood.
"We had a couple of key people
struggle, but others came
through and we hit it off."
The Cardinal gymnasts gave
one of their better perfor
mances on the vault at the Pac
-10 meet, earning their second
highest score of the season.
UCLA won the event and took
the top two places, with Arizona
State also having some strong

showings. Elzie and Meegan
Lannin, also a junior, tied for
22nd place with a 9.650 for the
Cardinal, and freshman Katie
Jennings earned 25th place and
her highest score of the season,
a 9.600.
Stanford excelled on the
uneven bars, breaking its own
school record in addition to
placing third overall. Though
Oregon State's Chari Knight
and Heather Bennett took first
and third place, respectively,
and second place went to Ari
zona's Becky Bowers, Anderson
was on their heels to capture
fourth place in a four-way tie.
Her score of 9.850 was her high
est this season, as were Elzie's
9.800 and senior Laurie West's
9.625. Stanford's Lannin fell on
her dismount, but the rest of
the gymnasts compensated for
the lost points with solid perfor
mances.
"We had a really good team
effort on the bars," Greenwood
said. "In the past, when one of
our best gymnast falls, it nega
tively affects the team. But we
had a lot of depth this meet."
The Cardinal team seized
fourth place overall on the bal
ance beam, and individually,
fifth place went to Anderson
with a 9.750, a score shared by
four other gymnasts. Junior
Tina Snowden tied with two
other gymnasts for 11th place
with a score of 9.700, her high
est of the season. Not far behind
were Jennings and freshman
Ariel Passanisi, in 19th and
23rd places, respectively. Tak
ing the top three places on this
event, as well as on the floor,
were Oregon State, UCLA and
Arizona State.
Stanford performed solidly
on the floor, with Snowden
placing fourth alongside three
other gymnasts sharing a score
of 9.775, and Elzie and Ander
son taking the respective places
of 10th and 16th. Jennings fell on
her double pike, but junior Jenny
Ward compensated by sticking her
double back for the first time in
competition. Though late in the
season, four gymnasts added diffi
culty to their floor routines in this
meet.
"We were very relaxed and
focused at this meet," Ward said.
"It was my most exciting meet of
the season.
"The team is ready to peak at
regionals. If we do what we are
capable of, are confident, and go
into this next meet with the same
calmness from Pac-lOs, I think we
have a great chance of going to

Nationals."
The Cardinal's performance at
NCAA regionals in Boise, Idaho,
on April 9 will determine whether
it attends nationals in Salt Lake
City. According to Greenwood, the
team is physically ready and just
needs to stay mentally prepared.
"So much of this sport is psy
chological," Greenwood said. "It's
more than just who can run the
fastest â€” it is balance, finesse and
aggression."
Ward agrees that the team
needs to be prepared mentally, as
well as working on its landings and
not giving way to small deduc
tions.
"The teams that are stronger
than us aren't necessarily more
skilled," Ward said. "Mainly, they
are more conscious of not making
small errors."
