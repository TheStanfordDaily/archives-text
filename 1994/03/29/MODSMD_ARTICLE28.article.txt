# Gymnasts capture 3 wins
## NCAA champs prepare for MPSF competition 
### Sam Wu Staff writer 
While most students got out of
shape during spring break, Stan
ford's two-time defending national
champion men's gymnastics got
back into competition form after a
brief rest during finals week.
The third-ranked Cardinal
began with a 278.95 to 263.45 vic
tory over UC-Santa Barbara on the
road a week ago, and continued to
regain its championship capabili
ties last Friday at San Jose, posting
a 281.025 score to down San Jose
State and California.
Because the two recent dual
meets provided Stanford with min
imal competition, the Cardinal
used its encounters as opportuni
ties to test and perfect routines in
preparation for the Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation Champi
onships this Friday and Saturday
in Albuquerque, N.M.
Therefore, Stanford did not
field its strongest line-ups in its

recent competitions. According to
head coach Sadao Hamada, that
was the primary reason his team's
scores against the Gauchos, Spar
tans, and Golden Bears were lower
than in the past. Before the finals,
the Cardinal posted 285-point tal
lies to oust teams such as two-time
NCAA runner-up Nebraska.
"The two meets were very low
key," Hamada said. "They were
just for us to get back into routine
shape. I was very afraid of injuries,
so we were extremely cautious."
In regard to injuries, some Stan
ford gymnasts tested their health
in the two meets and received
promising results.
Senior tri-captain Mark Booth,
who ruptured his Achilles tendon
late last season, competed for the
first time this year in floor exercis
es against the Gauchos and scored
a 9.55. Meanwhile, freshman floor
and vault specialist lan Bachrach,
who bruised his heel against UCIA
and Michigan a month ago, also
made a resurgence on floor exercis

e.s, earning u 9.75 against Santa
Barbara and a 9.725 against the
Spartans and t he Golden Bears.
"Mark is ready to compete on
floor," 1 lamada said. "He's a senior
and he has a chance to win the all
arounds at the Mountain Pacific
Championships. Lan is just fine —
he is definitely also ready to com
pete."
Junior tri-captain Josh Stein
provided more good news for the
Cardinal. Against the Gauchos, he
competed for the first time this
year on high bar and garnered a
9.70. Stanford can now bolster its
high bar lineup with no less than
one of its tri-captains.
"Right now, we can go about
285-286," Hamada said. "We just
have to train a little differently. We
have to be more concentrated and
more focused. We can't grind out
our routines anymore — it has to
be pure quality. If we do that, we
will be ready to score 288 by this
weekend for the Mountain Pacific
Championships."
