The Stanford women's golf
team placed third in the Uni
versity of Hawaii's ninth
annual Rainbow Wahine Golf
Invitational at the Kaneohe
Klipper Golf Course in Oahu
last Thursday. Heavy rains
caused the cancellation of the
second and third rounds of
the tournament. As a result,
the final standings were based
on Tuesday's first round,
which was played in 40-mph
winds.
The Cardinal finished with
317 strokes, three shots

behind winner USC and one
short of second place San Jose
State. Freshman Mhairi
McKay, the ninth-ranked
player in the nation, paced the
Stanford squad with a score of
76, good for third place among
individuals and three strokes
behind the tournament's win
ner, Spartan Janice Moodie.
The team's next competi
tive outing is at Arizona
State's Sun Devil Invitational
in Tempe, Ariz. April 8-10.
"Hopefully, we'll be able to
regain the momentum we lost
when we go to Arizona," said
head coach Tim Baldwin.
