# Upperclass invasion
## Juniors experience life in all-frosh dorms 
### Jamie Taylor Staff writer 
CIV books, new roommates
and an excited energy for Stan
ford life — these are the sights
and sounds that most students
remember from their days as new
students in an all-freshman dor
mitory.
For juniors Marisa Echanic
and Ann Chen, however, the un
expected experience of living in
an all-frosh dormitory has come
a little later than usual.
Echanic began the year living
in housing that required specific
clean-up and cooking schedules.
"I'm pre-med and I have a job, so
I don't really have time to stick to
that kind of schedule," says
Echanic. She petitioned Residen

tial Education for reassignment
and received a room in Larkin, an
all-frosh dormitory in Stern.
Chen, on the other hand, sim
ply drew a high enough number
in the 1993 housing draw to be
unguaranteed. She was eventu
ally placed in Donner.
According to the Office of Res
idential Education, it is unusual
for upperclassmen to be placed in
all-freshman residences, al
though it does not have statistics
on how often the event occurs.
Both Echanic and Chen look
with a positive light on their un
usual living experiences, and be
lieve that an all-frosh dorm of
fers a uniquely energetic and en
thusiastic atmosphere. "There's
none of the apathy you some
times see with upperclass stu
dents," said Echanic. "Everyone
is willing to try new things and
participate in everything."
"It's fun to see people go
through Stanford for the first
time," said Chen. But she added
that the frosh highlight her
upperclass status. "It definitely
makes you feel older," she said.
Both juniors agreed that
being an upperclassman — but
not a member of the residence
staff — in an all-freshman set
ting does have some drawbacks.
Chen said that because she was
in the Stanford in Washington

program spring quarter last year
she was not used to working in a
setting of freshmen students.
"It's hard to go into a dorm with
out anyone older and experi
enced to look to for guidance,"
said Chen.
Chen also said she finds it dif
ficult to relate to some of the
common problems of freshman
year. "I'm thinking about my
honors thesis and research pro
ject and the frosh are all con
cerned with things like CIV,"
said Chen.
Echanic agrees that all-frosh
dorms do have some negative
aspects. "It's super loud. People
are always up until 2 or 3 a.m.,
even during Dead Week," said
Echanic. She also sees differ
ences between all-freshman
dorms and the four-class dorms

in which she has lived in the
past. "It sometimes takes [fresh
men! longer to see they're mak
ing mistakes, since they don't
have any upperclass guidance,"
says Echanic.
Both juniors said the fresh
men in Larkin and Donner find
the situation unusual, but help
ful. Echanic and Chen are known
as "The Junior" in each of their
dorms, and Echanic said she is
seen "as a source to come to with
problems."
Each also found that, at first,
the relationship with her fresh
man roommate was a little awk
ward. "They didn't tell her that I
was coming, so she thought she
was going to have a single. She
was surprised when I moved in
and was even more surprised to
find out I wasn't a frosh," said

Chen. But the awkwardness
wore off with time, and the two
now get along well.
Echanic said Larkin frosh
believed she was an RA. "The
freshmen thought they werp
being too rowdy, and that I was
an extra RA being shipped in for
discipline reinforcement," she
said. However, Echanic has now
"gotten to know most of the
frosh" and is involved with the
dorm as social chair.
Although they consider their
living situations to be unusual,
neither Chen nor Echanic have
any misgivings. "It's unique.
Very few people ever go through
this," said Chen.
Echanic agrees. "I'm not sorry
I lived in a four-class dorm my
freshman year, and I'm not sorry
I'm here now," she said.
