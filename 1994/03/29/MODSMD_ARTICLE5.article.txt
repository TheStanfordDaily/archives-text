# Budget process nears completion
## More town meetings scheduled 
### Andy Dworkin Senior staff writer 
With budget blueprints in
from all administrative units,
Provost Condoleezza Rice says a
final 1994-95 University budget
should be ready by mid-May and
will include about one-third of
the total $18 million to $20 mil
lion in cuts the University is now
struggling to make.
But, before the budget is final
ized, Rice said, more "town hall"
meetings on cuts to various areas
will be held.
The plans — most of which
have been finalized — were sub
mitted as part of an effort to
trim 15-30 percent from most
administrative areas over the
next three years. Rice has said
the cuts are part of an effort to
have Stanford's expenditures
dictated by the University's rev
enue after years of concern over

deficits and
deficit spending.
This year's op
erating budget
stands at about
$370 million, not
including the
School of Medi
cine, the Gradu- 112
ate School of
Business or the
Hoover Institution

The various plans submitted by
administrative areas to reduce
their budgets generally fall into
three categories, Rice said. Some
of the plans achieve most of their
savings through reorganizing the
structure of the areas.
One area that falls into this
category is Student Affairs, as
most of the savings in that area
will be realized through restruc
turing and consolidating pro


Rice
grams, according to Vice Provost
for Student Affairs Mary
Edmonds.
A second category of adminis
trative units, including Faculty
and Staff Services, will achieve
their cuts largely through "old
fashioned belt tightening," Rice
said.
The remaining areas, such as
the University Legal Office, will
achieve most of their cuts
through re-engineering — chang
ing the way they operate or the

services they provide, and per
haps contracting work to outside
firms.
Rice said it is too early to know
exactly what areas might con
tract work out, but did say that
"we have to take a good, hard
look at Facilities, for instance."
But some areas have already
discussed farming out some or all
of their work. The University
Legal Office has taken bids from
outside legal firms for some or all
of Stanford's legal work. And a
group is currently looking at
ways Tresidder Union might
economize, including possibly
farming out the management.
After the 1994-95 budget is

completed, it will be presented to
the University Cabinet and Fac
ulty Senate. The budget will be
presented to the Board of
Trustees for approval at the
board's June 9-10 meeting, Rice
said.
Edmonds said she and the
Council of Presidents will host a
meeting about the cuts to Stu
dent Affairs at 7 p.m. in Terman
Auditorium April 7. At that meet
ing, Edmonds said, she will
review the ways in which Stu
dent Affairs will make its cuts,
answer student questions and
try to get student input on what
changes should be made to
Tresidder.
