# Budget process nears completion
## More town meetings scheduled 
### Andy Dworkin Senior staff writer 
With budget blueprints in
from all administrative units,
Provost Condoleezza Rice says a
final 1994-95 University budget
should be ready by mid-May and
will include about one-third of
the total $18 million to $20 mil
lion in cuts the University is now
struggling to make.
But, before the budget is final
ized, Rice said, more "town hall"
meetings on cuts to various areas
will be held.
The plans — most of which
have been finalized — were sub
mitted as part of an effort to
trim 15-30 percent from most
administrative areas over the
next three years. Rice has said
the cuts are part of an effort to
have Stanford's expenditures
dictated by the University's rev
enue after years of concern over

deficits and
deficit spending.
This year's op
erating budget
stands at about
$370 million, not
including the
School of Medi
cine, the Gradu- 112
ate School of
Business or the
Hoover Institution

The various plans submitted by
administrative areas to reduce
their budgets generally fall into
three categories, Rice said. Some
of the plans achieve most of their
savings through reorganizing the
structure of the areas.
One area that falls into this
category is Student Affairs, as
most of the savings in that area
will be realized through restruc
turing and consolidating pro
