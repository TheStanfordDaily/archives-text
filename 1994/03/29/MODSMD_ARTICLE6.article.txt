## ASSU's grant process complicated by possible buyout of CD Xchange 
### Jim Luh Staff writer 
As the ASSU considers a used
compact disc exchange among
proposals for $ 10,000 in entrepre
neurial grants, the selection
process has been complicated by
the question of how far it will go in
negotiating the takeover of an ex
isting business.
There are currently eight final
ists for the grants, according to
Council of Presidents member
Jason Snyder. Among the projects
under consideration are a record
label, a silk-screening service and

a video-dating service.
But the CD exchange is the
only proposal that involves the
ASSU's acquisition of a currently
operating business. The CD
Xchange has been running in
front of the Stanford Bookstore
since mid-January.
The students who started the
business are seeking to pass their
business on to an organization
that will continue to operate it in
the future, according to senior
Ryan Floyd, a co-owner of the ex
change.
Floyd said he and his partners
want to sell their current inven
tory of CDs and give up the busi
ness's profits while continuing
to manage the business for a
salary.
In addition to negotiating a
possible grant from the ASSU,
Floyd said, he and his partners
are also considering offers from
two other potential buyers.
While Floyd declined to discuss
any specific dollar amounts, he
said "there definitely are con
crete offers on the table."
But the fact that the CD
exchange already exists has
introduced new considerations
into the ASSU's decision on the
grants. "I think the ASSU is
having a very difficult time
working with a business propos
al for a business already in oper
ation," Floyd said.
The ASSU passed a bill in
November that would give up to
$10,000 to a student or group of
students to start up their own
business as part of the Entre
preneurial Grants Program.
Snyder emphasized that the
ASSU is still "considering all
options," and no final decisions
have been made as to whether
the ASSU will fund the CD
exchange, one or more of the
other projects, or no project at
all.
Another factor complicating
the selection process is a second
proposal for a CD exchange
among the finalists — junior
Jason Garoutte submitted a sep
arate proposal for a CD exchange
before Floyd's group started up
their business.
Snyder said one possible
option would be merging the two
proposals into one business.
Both Garoutte and Seth Spald
ing, a co-owner of the existing
CD exchange, said they would be
willing to discuss that possibili
ty.
Floyd said his group's primary
concerns in selling the business

are not purely financial and that
he and his partners had started
the business mainly to learn.
"We're looking more toward
the company enduring" and pro
viding similar educational oppor
tunities to future student man
agers, Floyd said.

Floyd said the group will con
sider each bidder's commitment
to keeping the business running
and also whether their offers
allow the company to continue
its practice of donating a portion
of its profits to Ravenswood Ele
mentary School.
