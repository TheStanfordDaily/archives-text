# Stanford funds world's biggest telescope

### Justin Dawe Staff writer 
Stanford, in cooperation with four other
universities from the United States and Eu
rope, is helping to fund the construction of the
world's largest telescope.
"This telescope is very versatile. ... It can
do almost anything we want," said Applied
Physics Prof. Vahe Petrosian.
The William P. Hobby-Robert E. Eberly
telescope is slated to be completed in 1996 and
will cost $ 13.5 million, a piddling amount com
pared to the $100 million cost of the only com
parably-sized facility yet built.
Stanford's stake in the project is about 10
percent — representing an initial investment

of just under $1.5 million. In return, the Uni
versity will receive use of the telescope '25
nights each year.
Asst. Physics Prof. Roger Romani said the
addition will "go a long ways to increasing the
scope of the astronomy program" here at Stan
ford.
The telescope, which will be built near
Austin, Texas, will not use traditional technol
ogy for mapping the heavens, but will instead
employ recently developed spectroscopic tech
niques. Spectroscopy — the analysis of the elec
tro-magnetic emissions of objects — opens new
avenues of exploration of the galaxy and uni
verse.
"Spectroscopy tells you what stars are made
of, and is a great tool for describing the me

chanics of some of the most distant objects in
the universe," Romani said.
Although the observatory will be a general
purpose facility, the astronomy and physics
departments "are particularly interested in
studying cosmology and gravitational lenses,"
said Romani. Gravitational lenses are regions
of such high mass density that even light
waves are bent by their intense gravitational
force.
These lenses have become the centers of
study as scientists around the world struggle
to identify neutron stars, black holes and the
now infamous "dark matter" that scientists
believe makes up the majority of the uni-
verse's mass.
The only observatory that
Stanford now has definite access
to is the 16-inch telescope locat
ed on the Farm, which is used for
undergraduate study.
The new telescope will have
an aperture of 10.2 meters and

will be the focus of worldwide
attention. Its cost of construc
tion is held low by the innova
tive use of a stationary primary
lens. The designers of the obser
vatory chose to limit their view
to the most productive 70 per
cent of the sky in order to save
money.
The other schools involved are
the University of Texas at Austin,
Pennsylvania State University
and two German universities.
