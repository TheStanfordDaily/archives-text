# New economics building set for April 15 opening
## 
### Jose J. Gutierrez Staff writer 
Economics aficionados on cam
pus are eagerly awaiting the April
15 opening of the nearly complet
ed, unnamed building next to
Memorial Auditorium that will
give the department some breath
ing room.
Prof. Gavin Wright — former
chair of the Economics Depart
ment and current director of the
Center for Economic Policy Re
search — said that Encina Hall,
the department's current loca
tion, did not provide it with near
ly enough space to operate effi
ciently.
"We have our graduate stu
dents in a separate building, other
programs in separate buildings;
we can't provide space for emeriti
or visiting professors," Gavin
said.
At the moment, "the east wing
of Encina is unoccupied, but ex

panding it, according to the prop
er safety codes" would cost more
than constructing a new building,
he added.
Although the building's con
struction has taken approximate
ly a year and a half, Gavin said it
was scheduled to have been fin
ished last December at a cost of
$11 million.
However, he said there was a
major "glitch" concerning the
structure of the third floor— the
architects had allocated 45 square
feet per workspace, but excluded
hallway space. They were forced
to recalculate and expand the
third floor, adding $700,000 to
the bill.
Despite this setback, Gavin
said finishing construction in a
year and a half was "pretty good."
April 15 has been set as the
date for opening the building to
the public, but it will remain un
named until the May 4 dedication
ceremony. Gavin said the build

ing will be named after the chief
donor, a "person well known to
the department, but maybe not to
the students" who chose to re
main anonymous until the build
ing is christened.
Gavin said the donor con
tributed $5 million and that other

departmental groups, including
the Center for Economic Policy
Research and faculty, raised the
remainder after the Board of
Trustees told them they needed to
come up with the money alone.

The new economics building next to Memorial Auditorium is nearing
completion in anticipation of an April 15 opening date.
Prof. David Starret, the cur

said the building will contain
classroom space as well as space
allotted for student, professor
and program offices. Classes will
be held in the building beginning
fall quarter, Starret said.
