Working at a smaller newspaper unproved not only my zvriting but
it taught me about how various parts of a real newspaper—from n
advertising to photos—come together to produce a final product.
Intern for the Clovis Independent:

7 was treated as a 'real' reporter from the start...my interest in
journalism was boosted by all that 1 saw.
