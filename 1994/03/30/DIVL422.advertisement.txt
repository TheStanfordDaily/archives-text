Consider a Linguistics
| Course this Spring! I
g Linguistics tries to understand the miracle of
c language. Why can a child of four, who can't even add
g six and eight, still perform extraordinarily complex
{j operations in speech that the most sophisticated
c computers can't? Why is it that all human languages
[j have certain structural properties in common? What
c role does language play in differentiating people by
g social class, ethnicity, and sex? What are the systematic c
jj differences between dialects and other varieties of a
I language?
c n
n n
c Here are some reasons why students find linguistics
jj exciting:
j • Students in introductory courses can be trained to
do original research
b • The data for linguistic investigation is all around
you in daily life: in cafeterias and restaurants, on
TV, in party conversations, etc.
8 • Linguistics courses are intellectually stimulating
and FUN
