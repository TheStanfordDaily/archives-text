# Tresidder evaluation underway
## 
### Burt Herman Editorial staff 
In order to address the im
pending cuts to University subsi
dies to Tresidder Union, Vice
Provost for Student Affairs Mary
Edmonds has named members to
the Tresidder Task Force to ex
amine the building's ailing finan
cial situation and ultimately de
cide its future management and
operations.
Currently, the University cov
ers any deficits in the Tresidder
budget with money from its gen
eral fund. Provost Condoleezza
Rice has previously said that
Tresidder is "losing a million-plus
(dollars) a year." Rice authorized
the formation of a task force to
study Tresidder in February.
In a memorandum sent to
members of the committee earlier
this month, Edmonds charged the
task force with the duty of assess
ing Tresidder's financial goals as
well as how they can be met.
After determining these goals,
the committee will talk over the
possibility of different manage
ment structures, including the
possibility of handing Tresidder
management over to an outside
agency, Edmonds wrote.
The committee held its initial
meeting on March 11 and met
again last night. Members dis
cussed the goals given to them by
Edmonds, as well as how to obtain
information for their final report,
according to Margaret Ann Fidler,
committee member and acting
staff liaison from the vice
provost's office. The committee's
goal will be "looking at the overall
financial health of Tresidder,"
Fidler said.
The task force will be consider
ing a wide range of topics, from
food service to restructuring
meeting room allocation, accord
ing to Greg Waldorf, task force
member and ASSU senate chair.
"Everything is on the table for dis
cussion," Waldorf said.

"Whatever the recommenda
tions of this task force are, they will
be adopted," Waldorf said, adding
that the committee's recommenda
tions will have "a lot of effect."
Waldorf has been working on
constructing a financial model of
Tresidder to determine what is
causing the financial losses the
building has posted in the past. He
said he is fairly optimistic the com
mittee's report will succeed in help
ing to make Tresidder profitable.
"We will be able to give students
more services and improve operat
ing efficiency," Waldorf said.

"The task force hopes to issue
its report to Edmonds' office by the
end of the quarter," Fidler said.
"The committee will maintain
close contact with the administra
tion involved in the final decision
affecting Tresidder," she added.
Members of the 12-person com
mittee include representatives
from the faculty and administra
tion, as well as three undergradu
ate and two graduate students.
The task force is co-chaired by
Law Prof. William Lazier and
Council of Presidents member
Ron Brown.
