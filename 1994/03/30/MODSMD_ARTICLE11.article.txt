# White House explains First Lady's investments

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Hillary
Rodham Clinton invested an initial
$1,000 in the cattle futures market,
parlaying that small stake into nearly
$100,000 in 1978 and 1979, the White
House said yesterday. The White House
sought to prove she used only her own
money in the investment.
"She also opened a second account
with $5,000, but wound up with about
$1,000 in losses and closed the account
soon after the Clintons' daughter
Chelsea was born in 1980," the White
House said.
The new material was put out by the
White House in an effort to demon
strate that Mrs. Clinton spent her own
money in commodities trading.
"Mrs. Clinton put up her own
money, invested it in her own accounts,
•*" r ■! V id'f

and assumed the full risk of loss," said
Mrs. Clinton's press secretary, Lisa
Caputo, and White House staff secre
tary John Podesta in a joint statement.
The White House released copies of
"statements of profits and loss" Mrs.
Clinton received that shows her main
account ballooning over the two years.
The documents suggested that, from
her initial investment of $1,000 in
October 1978, she made a $5,300 profit
on her first trade within a few days. She
reinvested the principal and proceeds in
several transactions which resulted in a
net gain of $26,521 for the year.
In 1979, still reinvesting her gains,
she made trading profits of $109,600
and suffered losses of $36,600. Her net
gain for that year was $72,996.
She closed the account with Ray E.

Friedman and Co., a Chicago commodi
ty trader with an office in Springdale,
Ark., in July 1979 — after making more
than $99,000 on the original $1,000,
according to White House documents.
Tax returns for 1977-79 and other
documents released by the White House
hist Friday showed the nearly $100,000
in gains in the two years.
But the tax returns did not list what
Mrs. Clinton had paid for the commodi
ties, the date acquired or the date sold.
That raised questions over how
much of her own money Mrs. Clinton
put into the scheme. The White House
issued the new material after
Newsweek magazine suggested Mrs.
Clinton did not invest her own money.
Newsweek has since backed off its
report.
