## Mexican candidate named Zedillo favored as country's next president 
### 
MEXICO CITY (AP) - Mexi
co's ruling party named Yale
trained economist Ernesto Zedillo
as its new presidential candidate
yesterday, making him the over
whelming favorite to be the coun
try's next leader.
The former public education
secretary was chosen to replace
Luis Donaldo Colosio, who was
assassinated while campaigning
in Tijuana last week. Zedillo was
Colosio's campaign manager for
the Aug. 21 election.
Zedillo, 42, has never held an
elected office.
Analysts described him as a
technocrat and good negotiator
who has yet to prove his political
skills.
He stands squarely in the tra
dition of President Carlos Salinas
de Gortari and his predecessor,
Miguel de la Madrid, both free
market financial experts with Ivy
League degrees.
Zedillo's campaign began amid
disorganization almost unheard
of for the Institutional Revolu
tionary Party, known as PRI,
which has run Mexico for 65
years. No other party in the world
still in power has ruled so long.

PRI leaders summoned hun
dreds of party activists to their
headquarters to cheer Zedillo's
nomination, shuffled them
between two auditoriums and an
open plaza and finally failed to let
Zedillo appear before the loyal
crowd despite shoving and angry
shouts of "Come Out! Come Out!"
Instead, Zedillo appeared on
television, where party leaders
made the announcement to an
audience of party elite and pho
tographers.
"I assume (the nomination)
with the absolute conviction that
the best man to take the PRI to
victory and the country to fulfill
its aspirations was at all times
Donaldo Colosio," he said in an
acceptance speech largely dedicat
ed to the slain candidate.
Two men are held in Colosio's
killing and investigators say they
are trying to determine if more
may have been involved.
Zedillo's main rival for the nom
ination, PRI chairman Fernando
Ortiz Arana, left the race hours
earlier. Ortiz Arana made the
announcement of Zedillo's choice.
Ortiz Arana, 49, was backed by
some old-line party activists who

wanted one of their own at Mexi
co's helm after a decade of rule by
technocrats.
The party's executive commit
tee described Zedillo as its "pre
candidate," indicating he still
must be approved by a party
congress before the choice
becomes final.
Zedillo resigned as education
secretary in December to manage
Colosio's campaign. Before that, he
served as secretary of planning and
budget, a springboard to the presi
dency for his two predecessors.
"He is going to have to prove
his political capacity and it is not
clear that he can do that," said
Sergio Saramiento, an indepen
dent political analyst.
"He is extremely intelligent.
He probably had the brightest
mind in the Cabinet and he has
ideas. He is very close to Salinas
but he has ideas of his own."
Zedillo was born in Mexico City
and moved to mexicali where he
attended public schools. He then
studied in Bradford, England, and
the University of Colorado before
arriving at Yale in 1974. Zedillo
earned a doctorate in economics
at Yale in 1978.
