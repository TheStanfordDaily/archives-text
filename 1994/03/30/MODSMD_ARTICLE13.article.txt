Japan's proposal rejected
WASHINGTON (AP) - U.S. Trade
Representative Mickey Kantor rejected
Japan's market-opening proposal yes
terday as a "half-finished work" that
did not meet President Clinton's con
cerns.
Since the United States was hopeful
Japan could meet its demands, Kantor
said, "We have reviewed these measures
and they do not meet the concerns the
president raised on Feb. 11 during his
meeting with Prime Minister (Morihiro)
Hosokawa."
Emerging from a meeting with Clin
ton's chief economic and foreign policy
advisers, Kantor said, "Our door is opened

and we are prepared to work with our ally
with this."
Immigration policy changes
WASHINGTON (AP) - A streamlining
of the review of aliens' claims for asylums
was proposed by the government yesterday
to cope with a backlog of 370,000 cases and
reduce abuse of the system.
A representative of an attorneys' group
said she feared even an increased number
of immigration judges under the proposal
wouldn't be able to reduce the backlog.
The asylum plan is one of several
changes in immigration policy recommend
ed by the Clinton administration as related
issues have become increasingly sensitive
on Capitol Hill and in statehouses.
