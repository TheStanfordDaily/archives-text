## Editorials Losing the memory

BY THEIR NATURE, univer
sities are constantly chang
ing places. Thousands of new
students arrive and depart each
year. Professors and administra
tors are promoted, or accept jobs at
other colleges, in government or in
the private sector.
In the last several years, the
turnover in Stanford's administra
tive ranks has been unusually
high. Some of the changes have
been a natural consequence of a
new president; some have been
casualties of administrative reor
ganization efforts; others resulted
from personal situations.
The departees include John
Schwartz, former vice president and
general counsel; Bob Freelen, for
mer vice president for public affairs;
Sharon Parker, former director of
the Office of Multicultural Develop
ment; and Alice Supton, former
director of Residential Education.
The job of Marlene Wine, secre
tary to the Board of Trustees, was

recently eliminated, and the Legal
Office is considering cutting several
positions.
Many newcomers have arrived,
including Vice Provost for Institu
tional Planning Geoffrey Cox;
General Counsel Michael Roster;
and Registrar Roger Printup. Vice
Provost for Student Affairs Mary
Edmonds came in 1992 and some
of University President Gerhard
Casper's closest advisers — includ
ing Provost Condoleezza Rice —
are still "youngsters" on the Farm.
Turnover can be healthy — with
new blood comes new ideas, fresh
perspectives and enthusiasm.
But "out with the old and in
with the new" should not become
Stanford's mantra. Under tight
budgets, it is natural to consolidate
positions and eliminate staff. But
at the same time, institutional
memory must be preserved, con
sulted and utilized
Those who forget the past are
doomed to repeat it.
