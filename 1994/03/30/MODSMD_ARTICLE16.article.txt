AFTER THE Grateful Dead's
last concert at Frost
Amphitheater a few years
ago, Stanford has not lived up to
its potential as a musical mecca.
Since then, the Stanford Concert
Network has managed to bring a
big name musical group to campus
only about once a year.
However, other college campus
es attract big name musical talent
on a regular basis — schools such
as the University of North Caroli
na, for example, host at least five
big shows a year.
Fortunately, things are changing
on the Farm. The Stanford Concert
Network is sponsoring two big
name musical acts — Cowboy
Junkies and Shawn Colvin — in the
next two weeks. And Network
Director Jason Colton has said that
another big name will play at Rinc
a-Delt May 15.
As news of these shows spread
across campus, many students

wonder "Why hasn't this hap
pened before?"
According to Colton, the Con
cert Network has been hindered by
the availability of facilities on cam
pus. Though his organization is in
contact with a variety of bands
throughout the year, he said access
to facilities is so scarce that band
and facility availability rarely
overlap. Colton added that the net
work has absolute last priority for
facilities after athletics, drama and
other campus events.
Stanford administrators need
to realize that concerts represent
exciting, worthwhile entertain
ment for students. The popularity
of the two shows, which sold out
very quickly, attests to this. In the
future, the Concert Network —
which should be commended for
the good work it has done this year
bringing big names to campus —
ought to receive more priority in
facilities access.
