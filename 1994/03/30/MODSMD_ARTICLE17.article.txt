## Dutch treat: drugs and sex 
### 
Architects and social his
torians have described Amster
dam as a progressive, internation
al utopia. The neat semi-circular grid of
canal-lined roads is traversed by one of
the most modern tram systems in the
world; rows of gingerbread-house tradi
tional buildings are comfortably inter
spersed with modern architecture.
But to college students and twenty
somethings in Europe and the States,
Amsterdam's liberal traditions have
earned it the reputation of a bastion of
decadence, where everything is legal, a
place where drug addicts and prostitutes
run rampant.
Most likely, a large number of the
thrill-seekers arrive in Amsterdam only
to find that, while the rumors are based
on some truth, the real Amsterdam is
not quite as shocking or vice-filled as
they expect.
Even on weekend nights, the city
seems still and pristine, and the main
thoroughfares are eerily quiet.
Ironically, the red-light district seems
to be even more of a tourist attraction
than Leidseplein (the area around the
American Hotel and the Hard Rock
Cafe) — the crowds of male and female
tourists gawking at the houses of prosti
tution and live-sex theaters rival those
at the Van Gogh Museum during the
day, and yes, even those at the Hard
Rock Cafe.
When the corruption of the sex
industry is sterilized by mass commer

cialization, lingerie-clad prostitutes and
their customers make business transac
tions from opposite sides of windows,
which both shield the women from
harassment and violence, but also put
them on display in a grotesque form of
advertising.
The institutionalization of the busi
ness is simultaneously surprising
because it takes away much of the shock
value of prostitution and disturbing
because it does just that — "I'm just an
ordinary working girl, but I don't have a
desk in my office," says the tape-record
ed message of a prostitute-mannequin
in the district's Erotic Arts Museum.
Amsterdam's other sin of choice,
drugs, exist in the strange space
between openly accepted and under
ground.
Contrary to popular belief, hash, pot
or any other forms of marijuana are not
legal in Dutch law books, but are "toler
ated" so that coffee houses and street
dealers can sell without getting caught.
Even though people smoke joints in
the streets, marijuana sales are under
ground enough that "coffee" houses (as
opposed to cafes, which really do only
sell coffee) at least make weak attempts
to appear legitimate.
In most establishments, a "menu" of
cannabis-related products is available
only in a partially hidden area or from
the bartender, who may stash it away in
his or her pocket. One particularly inno
vative coffee house has a menu hidden

into the wall, which lights up if a button
is pressed.
Disproving American marijuana
legalization opponents who claim that
taking pot out of the underground will
lead to complete drug-addicted anarchy,
people in Amsterdam seem to have just
taken it all in stride, and frown upon
irresponsible use — which, ironically, is
most often exhibited by tourists.
In fact, it seems that all of the city's
washed up stoners are actually the übiq
uitous young neo-hippie American
escapees who work for youth hostels or
coffee houses.
Amsterdam seems to prove the theo
ry that illicitness often makes things
seem much more enticing than they
really are — take away the thrill of the
forbidden and it all seems, well, a little
boring and ordinary.
Granted, the city has its problems,
drug-related and otherwise, but for the
most part, it puts up a surprisingly pris
tine, placid — almost Utopian — facade.

Angie, like another slightly more
famous American, claims she absolute
ly, positively did not inhale. She hopes
all of you are enjoying your studies
while she travels in Europe for the next
two weeks.
