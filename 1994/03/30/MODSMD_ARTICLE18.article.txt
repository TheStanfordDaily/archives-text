## Stanford should not encourage balkanization of campus 
### 
IF WE HAVE been shocked by the
"ethnic cleansing" in the former
Yugoslavia, we should be shocked
as well by tendencies in that direction
on our own campus. On every hand,
we see evidences of a will to divide our
selves against ourselves — to separate
off into separate cultural "nation
alisms," to hole up in private enclaves
(ethnic, religious, social, sexual) and to
politicize the curriculum in favor of
minority interests. Recent issues of
The Daily, for example, have carried
appeals for Asian-American and Gay
and-Lesbian Studies Programs (Feb.
10 and 14) — the latest candidates for
a curricular smorgasbord already
heavy with such minority-oriented
programs as African and Afro-Ameri
can Studies, Feminist Studies and
Jewish Studies.
There may be reason for some of
these, but where is this specialization
going to end? Why not Moslem Studies,
WASP Studies, Animal Rights Studies?
The list could be endless, for minorities
abound, and it makes little sense to
admit only those with good lobbies.
How often can we hack at the loaf and
have any loaf left? How atomized can
we become and still remain one univer
sity — which is to say, one nation, one
culture?
This same separatism is evident in
the arrangements of undergraduate
life. In the name of "multiculturalism"
and "diversity," Stanford has allowed
— and promoted — a kind of balka
nization of undergraduate life. Ethnic
minorities now cluster in "centers" —
Black, Asian-American, Native Ameri
can, Chicano — and are invited to live
together in so-called "theme houses." I
say "so-called," because in my opinion
a real theme house should be devoted
to a serious intellectual pursuit, such
as a foreign language or a subject like
international relations, and not be a
mere ethnic social club.

It is easy to understand why minori
ty students would prefer to associate
with their own kind rather than with
the white majority that has, historical
ly, enslaved them, stolen their land,
incarcerated them, and, in other ways,
screwed them over.
I sympathize with these feelings and
I make no apology for the dark side of
American history; but I nevertheless
insist that our future lies in putting
that history, and its discontents,
behind us — and that minorities, for
all their sufferings, must help lead the
way.
Together, we can succeed in doing
that only if we practice living together
— not as citizens of hostile camps com
municating by the tenuous and fragile
lines of political correctness, but as
members of the same body politic —
mixing, talking, playing, arguing,
maybe even hating, but doing so open
ly, on a day-to-day basis, in full
employment of the First Amendment.
We must get to know one another, to
live with our differences — and maybe
even to get to like them. And the basic
reason — for the university as for the
nation — is that we must all hang
together or we all will, in the long run,
hang separately.
But if there is some excuse for the
"theme houses," there is, in my opin
ion, none at all for the
fraternity/sorority system. That sys
tem in its long history has institution
alized prejudice of every kind —
racial, religious, social — and to a
great extent symbolizes why such
entities as theme houses have ever
been felt necessary. If, in its latter-day
liberalization, the fraternity/sorority
system no longer absolutely denies
admission to Catholics, Jews, blacks,
Asians, and other traditional "unde
sirables," it still keeps out wimps and
turkeys and wusses and fat kids with
acne — all those who, in their wholly

subjective opinion, are not fit for their
company. Discrimination is still the
name of their game, and it is disgrace
ful that this — or any — American
university allows such a self-selected
group of undergraduates the right to
exercise this kind of power over their
fellows.
As Woodrow Wilson said, in combat
ing the clubs at Princeton, "Any orga
nization that has the idea of exclusive
ness at its foundation is antagonistic to
the best training for citizenship in a
democratic country."
Rush is simply immoral and must
go. No student should be allowed to
say to another: You are fit to live with
us but you are not. That decision was
made by the Admissions Office, by
those competent to make it — using,
to the best of their ability, intellectu
ally objective and even-handed deter
minants — and should not be delegat
ed to any group of students, especially
to those judging on purely social and
subjective grounds. The University
should say to the entering student: If
you are good enough to get into Stan
ford, you are good enough to have a
fair crack at all the living arrange
ments on campus, as determined by
an objective draw. The University
should permit no abrogation of that
just standard.
Someone is bound to raise the
objection: But people always want to
choose their own friends, to mix with
those they feel comfortable with! It's
only natural for like to seek out like!
That's true, of course — it is
inevitable that different races and
religions and classes will seek associa
tion with their kind. But it is not the
University's business to provide hous
ing for these differences — or to
endorse, subsidize, or approve them.
That is a business for the students
themselves, who are free to organize
their own off-campus clubs. The uni

versity, in its official capacity, should
do nothing to impede and nothing to
encourage these social/ethnic/religious
"nationalisms." To permit such clubs
to become part of the university struc
ture is, in my opinion, to alienate the
university from its true purpose —
which should be as a role-model for
the nation.
Integration should be the operating
word among us, not separation, but
the University has weakly — for
understandable reasons — caved in to
the demands of special interests for
their own turf. This is a process that
should be reversed. The University
should say to the incoming student:
this is a diverse, multi-ethnic, multi
cultural university; if you come here,
you should expect to rub shoulders
with other students of many races,
creeds, and colors. You will live
together and eat together, and Stan
ford does not support any devices —
such as rush — that permit some stu
dents to escape from this melting pot
and set up their own elitist social or
ethnic club. If you come to Stanford,
this is the kind of community you
should prepare to join.

do nothing to impede and nothing to
encourage these social/ethnic/religious
"nationalisms." To permit such clubs
to become part of the university struc
ture is, in my opinion, to alienate the
university from its true purpose —
which should be as a role-model for
the nation.
Integration should be the operating
word among us, not separation, but
the University has weakly — for
understandable reasons — caved in to
the demands of special interests for
their own turf. This is a process that
should be reversed. The University
should say to the incoming student:
this is a diverse, multi-ethnic, multi
cultural university; if you come here,
you should expect to rub shoulders
with other students of many races,
creeds, and colors. You will live
together and eat together, and Stan
ford does not support any devices —
such as rush — that permit some stu
dents to escape from this melting pot
and set up their own elitist social or
ethnic club. If you come to Stanford,
this is the kind of community you
should prepare to join.

IF WE HAVE been shocked by the
"ethnic cleansing" in the former
Yugoslavia, we should be shocked
as well by tendencies in that direction
on our own campus. On every hand,
we see evidences of a will to divide our
selves against ourselves — to separate
off into separate cultural "nation
alisms," to hole up in private enclaves
(ethnic, religious, social, sexual) and to
politicize the curriculum in favor of
minority interests. Recent issues of
The Daily, for example, have carried
appeals for Asian-American and Gay
and-Lesbian Studies Programs (Feb.
10 and 14) — the latest candidates for
a curricular smorgasbord already
heavy with such minority-oriented
programs as African and Afro-Ameri
can Studies, Feminist Studies and
Jewish Studies.
There may be reason for some of
these, but where is this specialization
going to end? Why not Moslem Studies,
WASP Studies, Animal Rights Studies?
The list could be endless, for minorities
abound, and it makes little sense to
admit only those with good lobbies.
How often can we hack at the loaf and
have any loaf left? How atomized can
we become and still remain one univer
sity — which is to say, one nation, one
culture?
This same separatism is evident in
the arrangements of undergraduate
life. In the name of "multiculturalism"
and "diversity," Stanford has allowed
— and promoted — a kind of balka
nization of undergraduate life. Ethnic
minorities now cluster in "centers" —
Black, Asian-American, Native Ameri
can, Chicano — and are invited to live
together in so-called "theme houses." I
say "so-called," because in my opinion
a real theme house should be devoted
to a serious intellectual pursuit, such
as a foreign language or a subject like
international relations, and not be a
mere ethnic social club.

It is easy to understand why minori
ty students would prefer to associate
with their own kind rather than with
the white majority that has, historical
ly, enslaved them, stolen their land,
incarcerated them, and, in other ways,
screwed them over.
I sympathize with these feelings and
I make no apology for the dark side of
American history; but I nevertheless
insist that our future lies in putting
that history, and its discontents,
behind us — and that minorities, for
all their sufferings, must help lead the
way.
Together, we can succeed in doing
that only if we practice living together
— not as citizens of hostile camps com
municating by the tenuous and fragile
lines of political correctness, but as
members of the same body politic —
mixing, talking, playing, arguing,
maybe even hating, but doing so open
ly, on a day-to-day basis, in full
employment of the First Amendment.
We must get to know one another, to
live with our differences — and maybe
even to get to like them. And the basic
reason — for the university as for the
nation — is that we must all hang
together or we all will, in the long run,
hang separately.
But if there is some excuse for the
"theme houses," there is, in my opin
ion, none at all for the
fraternity/sorority system. That sys
tem in its long history has institution
alized prejudice of every kind —
racial, religious, social — and to a
great extent symbolizes why such
entities as theme houses have ever
been felt necessary. If, in its latter-day
liberalization, the fraternity/sorority
system no longer absolutely denies
admission to Catholics, Jews, blacks,
Asians, and other traditional "unde
sirables," it still keeps out wimps and
turkeys and wusses and fat kids with
acne — all those who, in their wholly

subjective opinion, are not fit for their
company. Discrimination is still the
name of their game, and it is disgrace
ful that this — or any — American
university allows such a self-selected
group of undergraduates the right to
exercise this kind of power over their
fellows.
As Woodrow Wilson said, in combat
ing the clubs at Princeton, "Any orga
nization that has the idea of exclusive
ness at its foundation is antagonistic to
the best training for citizenship in a
democratic country."
Rush is simply immoral and must
go. No student should be allowed to
say to another: You are fit to live with
us but you are not. That decision was
made by the Admissions Office, by
those competent to make it — using,
to the best of their ability, intellectu
ally objective and even-handed deter
minants — and should not be delegat
ed to any group of students, especially
to those judging on purely social and
subjective grounds. The University
should say to the entering student: If
you are good enough to get into Stan
ford, you are good enough to have a
fair crack at all the living arrange
ments on campus, as determined by
an objective draw. The University
should permit no abrogation of that
just standard.
Someone is bound to raise the
objection: But people always want to
choose their own friends, to mix with
those they feel comfortable with! It's
only natural for like to seek out like!
That's true, of course — it is
inevitable that different races and
religions and classes will seek associa
tion with their kind. But it is not the
University's business to provide hous
ing for these differences — or to
endorse, subsidize, or approve them.
That is a business for the students
themselves, who are free to organize
their own off-campus clubs. The uni

versity, in its official capacity, should
do nothing to impede and nothing to
encourage these social/ethnic/religious
"nationalisms." To permit such clubs
