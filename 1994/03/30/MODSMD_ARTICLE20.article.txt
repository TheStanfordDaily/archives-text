## Andy Dworkin Two paper seizures hampered flow of ideas, hurt community 
### 
IDEAS MAY be the most valuable
commodity. Long after currencies
have changed and products have
rusted away, a good idea can still serve
to enlighten and inspire.
The commerce of ideas, then, is of
immense value — particularly at a uni
versity, where students and faculty
spend their time creating, debating,
trading and evaluating ideas. To disrupt
the commerce of ideas is to commit a
wrong against the community, not just
against the original thinker but against
every person who might have benefited
from the opportunity to hear a new idea.
Unfortunately, two such disruptions
occurred during Dead Week last quarter
In what has become a greatly over
publicized event, some Stanford Daily
employees picked up about 1,000 copies
of a parody of The Daily that had been
published by the Chaparral and brought
them back to The Daily's office. Staffers
eventually redistributed the papers but
many of them were held for eight hours

or more before they were returned to
circulation.
Earlier that day, someone took many
Dailies from circulation boxes and dumped
them in recycling bins. Fortunately, Daily
employees recovered and redistributed
these papers. Some at The Daily believed
Chaparral editors dumped the papers
while distributing their parodies; the
humor magazine's editors deny this.
Why The Daily's papers were put in
recycling bins in unknown. Perhaps they
were placed there to make room for Cha
parrals, perhaps someone disagreed with
something that had been written in the
newspaper, perhaps it was just mean
spiritedness. No matter the reason, it
was wrong, and harmed everyone who
might have read those newspapers.
Why Daily editors decided to seize the
Chaparrals is known. Some of the paro
dies had been placed in Stanford Daily
distribution boxes, even on top of "legiti
mate" Dailies. This was an improper use
of the circulation boxes, which are Daily

property, and interfered with the circu
lation of the newspaper — and Cha
parral editors have agreed that they
improperly used the circulation boxes.
But even with these real concerns, the
seizure of the Chaparrals was wrong.
Why were the parodies picked up and
taken back to The Daily's office? I believe
the motive was to keep people from read
ing them — in any case this was certain
ly, if temporarily, the effect. In taking
the Chaparrals so no one else could read
them, Daily employees hindered the Cha
parral's attempt to spread new ideas and
harmed not just the Chaparral but the
Stanford community as a whole.
Even if the Daily staffers had proof,
instead of just suspicion, that the Cha
parral's editors had dumped the Dailies
in recycling bins, the seizure of the paro
dies would be just as wrong as the
seizure of the Dailies. That two wrongs
don't make a right is a truism.
I and others at The Daily found our
colleagues' action especially troubling,

however, because a newspaper relies on
the free commerce of ideas to educate,
inform and stimulate debate. People who
work for a newspaper, then, should be
especially committed to ensuring the
free flow of ideas, not the ones acting to
hinder that How.
Yes, The Daily had legitimate com
plaints, but might they not have been
served as well by simply removing the
parodies from the distribution boxes and
immediately setting them down next to
the boxes? This would have solved The
Daily's problem without preventing any
one from reading the parodies.
Instead, The Daily and the Chaparral
wasted time exchanging bouts of accusa
tions and defensiveness, actions and
reactions, and a very simple idea got
lost: that the most valuable thing might
not be protecting your property but pro
tecting the free flow of ideas, ideas that
might live on long after the property has
ceased to exist.
A recent newspaper editorial

addressed the subject well:
"Stanford University is a place of
ideas. ... It is not a place where oppo
nents to a person or group's view or
views avoid dealing with a topic by
silencing. . . . There is an integral differ
ence between disagreeing with someone
and effectively silencing them."
Those lines come from an editorial
published by The Daily last October that
condemned the seizure of about 3,000
copies of The Stanford Review by
unknown persons. While the circum
stances in this case differ greatly from
The Daily's seizure of the Chaparral,
and may differ from the seizure of the
Dailies, the message of the editorial is
still valid.
No matter what the justification,
silencing an idea should be an act that
newspaper employees and university
students should fight against, not one
they commit.
