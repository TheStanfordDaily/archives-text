## Scientists debate merits of ocean temperature research Stanford researcher assesses danger to marine mammals 
### Michael Slemmer Editorial staff 
While Stanford students were vacationing during
spring break, two environmental concerns clashed
over a project which would take place, in part, off the
coast of California.
The proposed project would measure the Pacific
Ocean's temperature over the next 10 years by placing
loudspeakers on the ocean floor off the coast of Mon
terey and Kauai — one of the Hawaiian islands.
In this way, it might provide valuable information
about global warming.
However, because of the extreme intensity of the
noise which the planned loudspeakers would emit,
some scientists have suggested that more than
500,000 marine mammals might be adversely affected
by the sound.
Though librarian emeritus and researcher at Stan
ford's Hopkins Marine Station Alan Baldridge
described the California location as "significantly
deeper than marine mammals can be expected to be
found," many environmentalists say the position
would put the hearing of such species as the sperm
whale in danger.
The loud noise could, for example, render the
sperm whale's sonar — the system which it must use
when it dives deeply enough in the ocean that no light
is available for sight — ineffective.
In addition, because the proposed sound level is
many times louder than sounds already known to
aggravate marine mammals, scientists have suggested
problems ranging from the noise merely annoying the
animals to disrupted migratory patterns and deafness.
According to Baldridge, scientists at the Scripps
Institution of Oceanography, who sponsored the pro
ject along with funding from the Department of
Defense, did not adequately publicize the proposal and
its implications for marine wildlife.
Despite the fact that the California site is located
within the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary,
Baldridge said the local oversight body did not stop the
proposal. Instead it was forwarded to the federal gov
ernment, where it has now undergone a public hear
ing following the publicization of possible problems by
scientist Lindy Weilgart of Nova Scotia.
Baldridge said there will also be a public hearing
held in April in a site which has not yet been
announced.
Problems assessing the exact nature of the danger
to marine mammals have centered around a "lack of
people in the bioacoustics field," Baldridge said.
"Probably a lot of people in other areas are open
minded about [the experimentl," he added, explaining

that questions remain as to whether marine wildlife
would actually be harmed by the proposed project.
These questions are compounded by the fact that
advocates of the experiment continue to argue that it
may aid in obtaining knowledge about global warming
by providing information about the ocean's tempera
ture — a problem which has pitted t wo environmental
concerns against each other.
And because the issue is currently under consider
ation at the federal level, members of congress from
across the nation have issued statements about the
feasibility of the research.
"Whether the impact will be discernible is the ques
tion the public must address," Baldridge said, pointing
out that the Scripps scientists who proposed the pro
ject in the first place have assessed some of the likely
damages to marine mammals if the experiment con
tinues.
In an attempt to allow further investigation of the
project's ramifications, the government has suspend
ed the starting date for the proposed tests, which
Baldridge says were scheduled to begin at the begin

ning of April.
"There has been some discussion of the issues
involved in this case," he said. "I think more question
ing will be required before the issue will be laid to
rest."
Currently, a great deal of communication about the
experiment is going on across Internet, an interna
tional computer network, in addition to the public
hearings being held. Baldridge said he believes all of
the facts will eventually be uncovered.
With varying estimates of the number of mammals
likely to be affected by the project, he said that the
solution is not immediately evident.
Though Baldridge said the Hopkins station has no
plans to work specifically on the issue of whether the
project should go forward, he pointed to its impor
tance for the future of the marine preserve surround
ing Monterey.
"With the tremendous level of the sound, it's not
surprising that this has become a big issue," he said.
"I'm just glad that people are beginning to realize the
significant difficulties involved in this project."
