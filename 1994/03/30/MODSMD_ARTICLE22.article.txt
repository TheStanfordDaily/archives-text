# Project would employ noise at high volumes

The planned experiment to broadcast sound
waves across the Pacific Ocean in order to monitor
water temperatures relies on loudspeakers capable
of emitting sound at 195 decibels.
In order to accomplish this feat, scientists have
proposed utilizing speakers at two locations — off
the coast of California and the island of Kauai, in
Hawaii.
Because sound levels are measured using a loga
rithmic scale — much like the familiar Richter scale
used for measuring earthquakes — this proposed
sound level is 10 million times louder than 120-deci
bel noises, which can cause damage to the human
ear when transmitted through the air.
In addition, Lindy Weilgart, the Nova Scotia sci
entist who first brought the planned experiment to
public attention, said 120-decibel sounds have also
been known to disturb whales when transmitted
through the water.
Because of their intensity and because sound
generally travels better in water than through the
air, the sounds which would be emitted by loud
speakers under the proposal would be so loud as to
be audible as far away as New Zealand.
According to Alan Baldridge, librarian emeritus
at Stanford's Hopkins Marine Station, which is
located close to the California site, the two posi
tions were probably chosen because they already
contain naval hydrophonic arrays — meaning that
it should be easier to set up the experiments in
those locations.
The low-pitched sound, used to measure varia
tions in the oceanic temperature, would last approx
imately 20 minutes and would be rebroadcast every
four hours for the next 10 years.
Baldridge said the speed of the sound would be
used in order to measure the water temperature.
This type of measurement is possible because sound
waves travel faster as a medium becomes more
dense, and at temperatures above 4 degrees Celsius,
water becomes less dense as it warms.
Under the proposal's specifics, the set of loud
speakers located near Monterey would be placed at a
depth of 2,800 feet, 25 miles away from the shore
line. Their location places them in the midst of a
national marine sanctuary — one of the reasons for
intense opposition to the plan which has surfaced in
recent weeks.
The project, which would be funded mostly by the
Department of Defense, is planned to cost in excess
of $30 million.
