## Objects cool down faster in a colder environment 
### Chris Patil Staff writer 
Do things get colder faster when
their surroundings are colder'? For
example, if I put a soda or beer can in
the freezer, will it chill faster than if 1 had
put it in the fridge? Also, why do metal con
tainers get colder in the fridge than plastic
ones ?
— Mr. Heat Miser
A: Thanks for your question, Heat. I'll
hazard a guess that you're the right
brained type and begin my answer
with some intuitive reasons why I must
answer your first question in the affirma
tive.
If the rate of cooling (i.e., the rate of heat
energy flow from a warm body to a colder
one) were independent of the temperature
difference between an object and its sur
roundings, the following would all be true:
• Because your body is as competent as,
say, mine at compensating for a given rate of
heat loss to the environment, it would be as
safe for you to swim buck naked in the
North Sea as it would be to do so in de
Guerre pool.
• The physics demonstration in which a
professor plunges a rubber ball into liquid
nitrogen and then smashes it against a wall
would be impractical, because the ball would
take a really long time to freeze.
• A beer would chill just as fast in the
refrigerator as it would it the freezer.
None of these examples sounds realistic,
of course, because the rate of heat flow from
one object to another is dependent on the
temperature difference between the two
objects in question.
The engineers among the readership will
be titillated to know that this dependence is
expressed simply by a petite equation
known to the sages as Fourier's Law. (Yes,
the Fourier, the same Frog responsible for
those lovely transformers that so many EEs
will learn to love and hate over the next few
years.) Fourier's Law states, concisely
enough,that
Q=(kAAT)/L
where Q, the rate of heat transfer between

two bodies, is related to K, the conductance
(of the beer can, for example), A is the area
of the can, L is the thickness of the can walls
and AT is the temperature difference
between the bodies.
The beer can question posed by this
week's generous contributor is easily
framed in terms of Fourier's Law. Suppose
you have two identical cans of Bergermeis
ter — both initially at room temperature —
and you put one in the fridge and the other
in the freezer. Since K, A, and L are the
same for both cans, and AT is larger
between the kitchen and the freezer than
between the kitchen and the fridge, the beer
you put next to the popsicles will chill more
rapidly. Voila! better living through science.
This approach is not without its hazards,
however. If you forget and leave the beer in
the freezer, it will eventually freeze, rupture
the can and give you a chance to find out
first-hand why Barley n' Hops Ripple will
never be the Flavor of the Month.
Fortuitously, Fourier's Law also has
something to say about why chilled metal
cans feel cooler to the touch than plastic
containers of the same temperature.
Despite Mr. Miser's somewhat mislead
ing query, metal containers do not "get cold
er in the fridge" than plastic ones. A fairly
straightforward argument invoking the Sec
ond Law of Thermodynamics tells us that,
given enough time, everything in a refriger
ation compartment will equilibrate to the
same temperature.
Here, the difference between our two
hypothetical cans is not AT but K, the con
ductance of the container walls. Because
plastic has a significantly lower heat con
ductance than metal, the rate of heat flow
from your hand to a plastic container will be
slower. Ergo, it doesn't feel as cold.
