# Monkeys learn through repetition
## Tests relate behavioral changes to sensitivity of neurons in the brain 
### Julie Sauer Staff writer 
Stanford researchers' experi
ments on the visual systems of rhe
sus monkeys have revealed a link
between animal behavioral changes
and increased sensitivity of related
neurons.
William Newsome, a professor of
neurobiology at the School of
Medicine, led the research which
related the so-called plasticity of
neurons to plasticity of behavior —
a field which is currently the sub
ject of much biological research.
He described plasticity as a
change in signaling properties of
neurons, making them more recep
tive to certain stimuli.
As an example, he explained that
neuronal plasticity can be related to
learning. When a stroke damages
the brain, it is presumably this neu
ronal plasticity that allows the vic
tim to relearn tasks as neurons
form new connections, eliminate
old ones or strengthen existing con
nections.
In Newsome's experiment, which
was completed in collaboration with
postdoctoral fellows Ehud Zohary,
Simona Celebrini, and Kenneth
Britten, the monkeys were given a
series of visual tests in which the
animals watched a video screen dis
playing random dots in motion.
In each trial, a proportion of the
dots moved in the same direction,
while the surrounding dots moved
randomly, creating background
noise. The monkeys would then
indicate the direction of the coher
ent dots through their eye move
ment which would, presumably, fol
low the motion.
The full experiment consisted of
blocks of 200 trials. As the monkeys
performed each trial, the research
ers measured the electrical activity
of particular neurons using elec
trodes in the monkeys' brains.
The specific neurons studied
included those in the middle tempo

ral visual region — neurons which
make up an important source of
neural signals that provide the ani
mals with visual ability.
Successive trials of the experi
ment revealed that the accuracy of
the monkeys' eye movement re
sponse and the neuronal plasticity
in the visual region of the brain
both increased by 15 percent — an
increase which could be observed
after each block of trials was com
pleted.
Newsome emphasized the signif
icance of the similarity in the per
cent changes in neuronal and per
ceptional (eye movement) respons
es. This correlation provides evi
dence of a link between the plastici
ty of neurons responsible for behav
ior and changes in the animals'
behavior.
He likened the -nonkeys' im
provement in successive trials to a
pianist's improvement as he or she
practices a difficult composition.
In other words, the experiment
specifically did not involve training
the monkeys to respond in a prede
termined manner to the tests, but
instead their brains became accus
tomed to following the sequences of
dots through repetition.
In addition, as the monkeys' per
ception accuracy increased, their

neurons became more sensitive,
meaning that they would be better
able to assimilate new information
— a fact which accounts for the
increased rate of learning which
took place throughout the tests.
While neuronal and behavioral
plasticity changed in similar pro
portions, they also changed at the
same rate. This correspondence of
change rate supports the idea that
the improvement in the animals'
perceptive ability may be a result of
heightened sensitivity in their neu
rons.
The experimental results indi
cated a relation between the magni
tude and rate of improvement in
neuronal and behavioral plasticity
that may shed light on the learning
process, Newsome said.
However, because the increased
neuronal sensitivity observed dur
ing the research was found only to
be temporary, he stressed that the
correlations found may not be those
also involved in long-term retention
of similar skills.
Despite this apparent setback,
Newsome said he is hopeful that his
current research will lead to a bet
ter understanding of the factors
involved in animals retaining infor
mation over longer intervals of
time.
