## Williams quietly puts criticism to rest The 						senior ends his Cardinal career as 15th on all-time Stanford scoring list 
### Brian Egan Senior staff writer 
It was a typical Brent Williams game.
Williams, the Cardinal men's basketball
team's 6-foot-6 small forward, began Stan
ford's season-ending 80-76 National Invita
tion Tournament loss to Gonzaga with a
ferocious slam dunk. He scored six consec
utive points in helping the Cardinal storm
back from an 18-point deficit to tie the
Bulldogs late in the second half. He fin
ished with 24 points.
But when the dust settled, it was Dion
Cross who led Stanford scorers with 25
points and Andy Poppink who hit the
game-tying shot. Williams' contribution
was silently solid.
"Brent's a quiet kind of guy," Cardinal
coach Mike Montgomery said. "He's not a
demonstrative kind of person. With this
team, he led more by example."
Indeed. Williams, a three-year starter
for the Cardinal, recorded career highs in
both points and rebounds per game (14.3
and 7.0, respectively) in leading Stanford to
a 17-11 record and postseason play follow
ing last season's disappointing 7-23 mark.
"To achieve the turnaround that we
managed, we needed that type of produc
tion from him," Montgomery said. "I'm not
at all surprised with the results."
For Williams, who finished his Cardinal
career ranked No. 15 on the school's all
time scoring charts, this season was as
much a personal turnaround as it was a
team turnaround.
"I've had to give a lot of myself this
year," Williams said. "I'm not completely
happy with my numbers, but I think I did a
good job this year."
"He meant a lot to this program, espe
cially this year," forward Darren Allaway
said. "This season, he showed a lot of his
doubters around campus and in the basket
ball community that he can play."
Williams has had his doubters. After
playing a reserve role as a red-shirt fresh
man on Stanford's 1990-91 NIT champi
onship team, Williams blossomed as a
sophomore. Starting at small forward
opposite All-American Adam Keefe,
Williams finished second in scoring to
Keefe in leading the Cardinal to an NCAA
berth, averaging almost 18 points over his
last six games of the season.
That year, Williams acquired a reputa
tion for his tenacious defense, holding
three All-Americans (Tracy Murray of
UCLA, Harold Miner of USC and Latrell
Sprewell of Alabama) under their season
scoring averages.
With Keefe gone the way of the draft
after the 1991-92 season, Williams was
expected to become the "go-to" guy that
Keefe had been on the offensive end of the
court.
At times during the 1992-93 season,
however, Williams seemed like the only
guy on the offensive side of the court.

Injuries to Andy Poppink and David Har
bour and some disappointing production
from the Cardinal backcourt meant more
minutes, more shots and more misses for
Williams.
"We'd have the ball, and the shot clock
would be winding down, and the ball would
always seem to be in Brent's hands," Mont
gomery said. "He'd have to take a lot of dif
ficult shots, because nobody else could real
ly shoot the ball."
"I wasn't very consistent last year,"
Williams said. "I received a lot of defensive
pressure from most teams we faced, and it
was tough."
It was tough in more ways than one —
Williams faced pressure not only from
defenses that keyed on him, but from Stan
ford fans who increasingly looked to him to
fill the Keefe's shoes.
Bothered by bone spurs in his left ankle
and tendonitis in his left knee, Williams'
team-leading scoring average of over 13
points per game paled in the face of his 41
percent field goal shooting and a free
throw shooting mark of less than 50 per
cent.
As Stanford struggled, losing 12 games
in a row at one point, the pressures on and
criticisms of Williams increased.
"When you get to this level, there's
going to be a lot of people who try to bring
you down," Williams said. "There's a lot of
non-believers out there."
This year, a resurgent Stanford squad
effectively silenced those non-believers.
The Cardinal surprised virtually everybody
by finishing in fourth place in the Pacific 10
Conference, the highest finish ever record
ed by a team that had placed last the previ
ous year.
With the rise to stardom of Dion Cross
and Brevin Knight and the return of Pop
pink, the spotlight on the club shifted away
from Williams to a more team-oriented
angle.
"He had to carry a big weight for us last
year," center Jim Morgan said. "This year,
he didn't feel like he had to score every time
down the court, and some of the media
attention shied away from him. I think he
enjoyed it."
Despite his less pronounced role in the
Stanford offense, the fortunes of the Cardi
nal seemed to rest on the shoulders of
Williams. When the senior shot under 25
percent from the field during a late-season
five-game stretch, Stanford dropped four of
those five contests.
With Williams averaging 18 points over
his last four regular-season games, the Car
dinal won three, falling a game short of an
NCAA appearance.
"He just played the ball he normally
plays," Cross said. "He played within him
self instead of listening to the outside pres
sures."
For Williams, playing within himself

Brent Williams goes up for a tomahawk slam against Gonzaga in the
opening round of the National Invitation Tournament.
involved becoming a more vocal
leader on the court this season.
Voted captain by his teammates
before the year, the normally
soft-spoken Williams took a more
active leadership role this sea
son.

"I have a lot of friends, but I
only really talk to my close
friends," Williams said. "I'm
pretty much a private person by
nature, and I had to give a lot of
myself this year."
The changes that Williams
made, however, could potentially
reap him some major benefits. In
the process of wading through
his future basketball opportuni
ties, National Basketball Associ

ation play is still a real possibili
ty for the forward, according to
Cardinal opponents this year.
"Brent was an NBA player out
there tonight," said California
coach Todd Bozeman after
Williams hit for 20 points and 13
rebounds in the Cardinal's 88-79
upset of the Golden Bears in Jan
uary. "He looked the part to me."
Williams remains typically
quiet about his chances and his

future.
"I've had some good games,
and I've had some bad ones. I've
been happy here. Stanford has
taught me a lot about people,
taught me a lot about myself,
and taught me a lot about com
petitiveness," Williams said.
"I wanted to be sure that play
ing basketball still made me
happy. There's no doubt in my
mind that it's true now."
