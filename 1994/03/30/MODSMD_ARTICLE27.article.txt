# Golfers brave rain and wind
## Stanford wins two tourneys 
### Andrew Blachman Staff writer 
Rain or shine, the Cardinal men's golf team
delivers.
Less than a week after capturing the rain
shortened Pacific Coast Championships in
Santa Barbara, the No. 3-ranked Stanford
linksters yesterday added their fourth team
title of the season. The Cardinal built an early
lead under sunny skies at the Nike/Southwest
ern Invitational and held on to outpace the
field at the North Ranch Country Club in
Westlake Village, Calif.
"It was a spectacular trip all the way
around," head coach Wally Goodwin said.
"Even though we were hampered by some
awful weather in Santa Barbara, the guys real
ly geared up for the Southwestern tournament
and won it for the first time in Stanford histo
ry.
Stanford, which won the 12-team tourna
ment by 14 strokes, claimed four of the top
eight finishers. Junior Casey Martin led all
Stanford golfers but fell one stroke shy of Ari
zona State's Todd Demsey for the individual
title. Steve Burdick, Brad Lanning and Notah
Begay 111 all finished within six strokes of the
lead.
Martin's two-under-par score of 211 after
three rounds helped Stanford record the only
team score under par for the tournament. The
Cardinal team total of 849 was three under par
and came on a 6,797 yard, par 71 course. Stan
ford's first round team total of 279 was also the
tournament's best.
"Our goal going down there was to win both
tournaments and we did that," Martin said.
Last Thursday, Stanford captured the
Pacific Coast Intercollegiate Championships as
well. Rain and wind, which forced a cancella
tion of play in the third round in Santa Bar
bara, Calif., dampened the Cardinal's victory
in the 21 team field.
Stanford outpaced the competition behind
strong performances from Lanning and junior
William Yanigisawa, who finished third and
sixth, respectively. The solid team showing
allowed Stanford to overcome an unusually
mediocre tournament from Begay, the Cardi
nal's top player.
In claiming the team title in the foul weath
er, the Cardinal overcame an obstacle which
hurt them in the fall. Wind and rain proved dif
ficult for the linksters in the past, and led to a
disappointing fourth place finish at the North
western University Quintessence in Evanston,
111. last October. This time, not even Mother
Nature could stop the surging Stanford team.
Since the start of spring competition, the
Stanford golf team has been tearing up the
greens. In February, the team traveled to
Hawaii and claimed two second-place finishes
among the toughest competition in the nation.
With the two latest additions to the trophy case
this past week, Stanford seems poised to make
a run for the national championship.
