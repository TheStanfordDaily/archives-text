# End the Madness!
## It's down to the Final Four, baby 
### 
Then there were four. Not
the Fab Four of Michigan
(who were eliminated one
game shy of the quartet), but the
Final Four.
The odyssey that is the NCAA
Tournament, which began two
short weeks ago

with 64 teams in
the fray, has
seen 60 of those
participants
come and go.
What remains
this weekend in
Charlotte, N.C.,
will end the col
lege basketball
seasons of the

remaining schools: Arizona,
Arkansas, Duke and Florida.
Of the squads still in the mix,
only Duke is accustomed to the
hoopla that accompanies the
Final Four of March Madness.
The Blue Devils are tournament
tough and tournament tested —
and look for their third tourna
ment title in four years. Many
observers did not expect the
Dookies to advance this far —
their coach Mike Krzyzewski
included.
Coach "K" has called his team
"a good team with a lot of heart."
That heart showed against Pur
due in the Southeast Regional
final, as the Devils' stifling
defense shut down the Boiler
makers' Ail-American, Glenn (Big
Dog) Robinson. Only two nights
earlier, Robinson scorched
Kansas for 44 points. Against
Duke, Big Dog's bite was a paltry
13. And while Grant Hill and
Antonio Lang administered the
choke collar, Coach K — who will
be making his seventh trip to the
Final Four in nine years — laid
the foundation. Duke's Road to
the Final Four is only two hours
from home, with a partisan crowd
in tow.

Remarkably, the team from
the West Region this season is
actually a school from the West
Coast — and from the Pacific 10
Conference to boot. While the rest
of its league brethren folded like
cheap lawn chairs in the opening
round, Arizona

rode the play ot
its backcourt of
Damon
Stoudam ire
and Khalid
Reeves to Char
lotte. Lute
Olsen's Wild
cats, who suf
fered first
round fadeouts

each of the last two seasons,
return to the Final Four for the
first time since 1988. After knock
ing off Loyola of Maryland, Ari
zona impressively defeated Vir
ginia, Louisville and Missouri to
get there. Unfortunately for the
'Cats, their opponent in the
national semifinal will be the
team ranked number one for
most of the season, Arkansas.
The Razorbacks, the Midwest
Region's No. 1 seed, were the one
team of this bunch that was
expected to get this far. Between
the outside shooting of Scotty
Thurman and the inside play of
Corliss Williamson, the Hogs
were not even tested until the
regional final with Michigan. It
will be interesting to see whether
Arkansas or Arizona makes more
three-point shots — although the
Hogs' frontline advantage should
propel them to the title game.
Almost forgotten in this mix is
Florida, the No. 3 seed from the
East that will tangle with Duke.
The Gators also have a talented
backcourt, but they continually
benefited more than anything
else from the play of the team
