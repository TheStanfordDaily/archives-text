# Injuries, new format force teams to look forward to next year
## Fencers struggle at NCAA Championships 
### Roger Han Staff writer 
Instead of spending their spring break in the
sun, five Stanford fencers spent it thrusting
and parrying in the cold climate of the NCAA
Championships. Unfortunately, the outcome
was just as chilly as the weather, but a hotter
season next year may loom on the horizon.
Hampered by the loss of one of its top
fencers, the women's fencing team finished a
disappointing 11th out of the 12 teams compet
ing at the championships, held March 18-21 at
Brandeis University in Waltham, Mass. On the
men's side, junior Douglas Vanderbilt placed
23rd out of 28 in the individual epee competi
tion. Overall, in the combined men's and
women's scores, Stanford finished 17th.
Notre Dame finished first overall and also
won the men's foil title, while Penn State won
the women's title, Princeton won the men's
epee title, and Yale won the men's saber title.
The women's team was hurt when sopho
more Stephanie Wien suffered a serious knee
injury before the NCAA Western Regionals
held March 7-8, but the Cardinal women were
still able to dominate the competition with

senior Michelle Butler filling in for Wien. Stan
ford captured the top three places overall with
sophomore Morgan Hoch finishing first, junior
Anna Cummins placing second and sophomore
Chloe Sladden coming in third.
"We had a great season on the West Coast,"
Hoch said. "We were undefeated in regional
competition and swept the tournament."
But faced with much stiffer competition
from the East Coast schools at NCAAs, the
women were only able to muster a win against
Yale. They lost to St. John's and the eventual
second-place team, University of Pennsylvania,
in the first round. Then in the second round,
they suffered a tough defeat to Princeton
before handily beating Yale. The score against
Princeton was 8-8, but Stanford lost the tie
breaker because they scored fewer touches.
Hoch was undefeated in the matches against
Princeton and Yale.
"Michelle did a really good job in filling in
the fourth spot," Hoch said. "But it hurt us
psychologically to know that |Wien| wasn't
going to be there because she's had such great
results all year."
"If we'd all been on," said Sladden. "We
could have (placed in] the top eight. But I felt

good just being there among the top 32 fencers.
It was another level than the West Coast."
In the individual competition, Hoch placed
19th, Cummins 27th and Sladden 31st. Cum
mins and Sladden were both eliminated in the
first round while Hoch was knocked out in the
second round.
The Cardinal women's finish at NCAAs
didn't reflect the successful season they had.
Besides their domination of the West Coast
they also did well on an East Coast trip earlier
in the year, beating Fairleigh Dickinson Uni
versity, which finished fourth at NCAAs.
Next year the women will fence in a different
format with the addition of the epee class to the
current foil class. Hoch, and probably Wien,
will switch from foil to epee, their natural
weapon. Stanford will have an advantage over
other schools, Hoch said, since the Cardinal's
epeeists are experienced while most other epee
teams will be composed of foilists.
Another change is that instead of entire
teams qualifying for the NCAA Champi
onships, fencers will qualify individually, with a
maximum of two fencers per weapon from each
school allowed to compete. Team
scores will then be based on the
individual results. The change
could lessen the importance of
depth, since a school with just
one good fencer in each weapon
can place high.
For the men's team, Vander

bilt was the sole Stanford repre
sentative at NCAAs. He qualified
for the individual competition by
finishing second at Western
Regionals and gaining a wildcard
spot. Epee teammate Errol
Hunter finished third but didn't
qualify for Nationals. The epee
team as a whole finished second
behind Air Force.
Vanderbilt was knocked out of
the tournament after the second
round although he did fence a

good match against the eventual
winner of the epee division, Har
ald Winkmann of Princeton, nar
rowly losing by a margin of 5-4.
The trip to NCAAs was a cul
mination of a great year for Van
derbilt, who first began fencing in
a P.E. class his freshman year.
"This year was a growing expe
rience for the team," he said.
"Errol transferred from foil to
epee and we had some new guys
in saber. For me, I got experience

last year and this year I kind of
came out of a shell."
The Cardinal men hope to do
extremely well next year with the
return of foilists Geoff Donaker
and Sean McClain, who have
been training for a year in Ger
many. With a strengthened foil
team and experienced epee and
saber teams, the men have a good
chance of placing in the top five
at NCAAs, according to Vander
bilt.
