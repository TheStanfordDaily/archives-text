# Experts gauge Whitewater's depth
## Stanford scholars say it's too early to predict affair's outcome 
### Beth Berselli Staff writer 
While the Whitewater affair contin
ues to grab national headlines, Stanford
political experts maintain that its real
significance will remain unclear until all
of the pertinent information is revealed.
"A lot depends on what the special
counsel brings out," said Political Sci
ence Prof. Richard Brody. "It looks to me
at least at this moment as if there's going
to be very little [electoral! fallout, but
that could change with the emergence of

a 'smoking gun,' assuming that there's
something there."
"It depends completely on what infor
mation comes out," said Hoover Insti
tute Senior Fellow Martin Anderson,
who served under former President
Ronald Reagan.
Whitewater refers to a failed land in
vestment deal in Arkansas during the
late 1970s in which President Clinton
and his wife claim they lost about
$50,000. The current controversy in
volves allegations that Whitewater was
linked to Madison Savings and Loan — a

failed thrift operated by the Clintons'
business partner — and that White
House officials may have improperly
used their positions to influence the fed
eral investigation into Madison.
Political Science Prof. David Brady
said the information will come out be
cause "there's a paper trail and that will
give us a pretty good idea of what went
on."
Because of the lack of known informa
tion, Stanford political experts were hes-
itant to make any predictions
about the outcome of the affair.
The only prediction Anderson
made was that Whitewater will
dominate the news at least through
August because the investigation
will not be completed until then.
"Whitewater is not going to go
away until there's some credible
source that says there's nothing
there. [Special Counsel Robert]
Fiske is the most likely source,"
Brody said.
Brady said the minimum that
the Clintons will have to do is pay
back taxes.
In addition to these predictions,

experts explained why Whitewater
became such a big issue. "I think
the reason why it's become such a
big issue is so much politically is at
stake. . . . The presidency is at
stake," Anderson said.
"The real question that lies
behind all of these other questions
about (presidential adviser George)
Stephanopoulos and the suicide of
deputy White House Counsel Vin
cent Foster and Mrs. Clinton's
investment in the commodities
market is: What did the president
know? When did he know it?" he
added.
Brody said Whitewater has
become such a big issue for two
reasons. "The Democrats made
such a big deal of previous scandals
that the Republicans are getting
back at them on this one ... and

any attempts at covering it up just
make it look like there's more
there than the president claims."
The experts agreed that White
water has hurt the Clinton admin
istration.
Anderson said Whitewater has
already hurt the president. "It is
debilitating. ... When you're deal
ing with a scandal, you don't do
anything else. It puts other things
on the back burner."
"Clinton is slowly being
stripped of his key support staff.
They have either left or are preoc
cupied with dealing with Whitewa
ter," he added.
"The affair has caused the Clin
tons to lose their pure image and
credibility," Brody said. "The bot
tom line is that it didn't help this
presidency. How much it will hurt

them depends on what's there."
Although the affair has harmed
the Clintons, most experts agreed
that the media coverage of White
water has been fair.
"Overall the media has done a
good job of covering the affair,"
Anderson said.
Brody agreed, but said the
media coverage has been a "feed
ing-frenzy in some respects."
Bob Minzesheimer, White
House editor for USA Today who is
currently at Stanford as part of the
Knight Fellowship program, said
the media has paid so much atten
tion to Whitewater because "it has
all the elements of a 'good story.' "
"It's a mystery and we all like a
mystery," Anderson agreed.
"If you give the press too much
information they get bored; if you

give them nothing they get suspi
cious. Clinton is trying to walk the
middle ground," said
Minzesheimer. "A lot of reporters
remember that the media down
played Watergate for a long time.
That was a mistake and reporters
today don't want to make it again."
The similarities between White
water and Watergate have received
much attention in the media, but
the experts differed on the accura
cy of such a comparison.
Anderson said Whitewater is
similar to Watergate and the Iran-
Contra scandal because "it
involves charges made against the
president or people close to him,
and whenever it involves the presi
dent it becomes a serious affair."
He added Whitewater is "accelerat
ing at the same pace" as the two

scandals.
"I've cringed at some of the
comparisons to Watergate because
it's not on that scale yet,"
Minzesheimer said.
Brody said Nixon and Reagan
suffered severe drops in their
approval ratings after revelations
of improprieties. Nixon went from
a 67 percent approval rating in
January 1973 to a 24 percent
approval rating in August 1974,
and Reagan went from 63 percent
to 47 percent from October to
December 1986.
"There hasn't been that kind of
impact for Whitewater," Brody
said. "If Clinton's approval rating
has dropped at all, it hasn't
dropped more than four or five
points. Of course this can change if
something comes out."

"Overall the media has done a
good job of covering the affair,"
Anderson said.
Brody agreed, but said the
media coverage has been a "feed
ing-frenzy in some respects."
Bob Minzesheimer, White
House editor for USA Today who is
currently at Stanford as part of the
Knight Fellowship program, said
the media has paid so much atten
tion to Whitewater because "it has
all the elements of a 'good story.' "
"It's a mystery and we all like a
mystery," Anderson agreed.
"If you give the press too much
information they get bored; if you

give them nothing they get suspi
cious. Clinton is trying to walk the
middle ground," said
Minzesheimer. "A lot of reporters
remember that the media down
played Watergate for a long time.
That was a mistake and reporters
today don't want to make it again."
The similarities between White
water and Watergate have received
much attention in the media, but
the experts differed on the accura
cy of such a comparison.
Anderson said Whitewater is
similar to Watergate and the Iran-
Contra scandal because "it
involves charges made against the
president or people close to him,
and whenever it involves the presi
dent it becomes a serious affair."
He added Whitewater is "accelerat
ing at the same pace" as the two

scandals.
"I've cringed at some of the
comparisons to Watergate because
it's not on that scale yet,"
Minzesheimer said.
Brody said Nixon and Reagan
suffered severe drops in their
approval ratings after revelations
of improprieties. Nixon went from
a 67 percent approval rating in
January 1973 to a 24 percent
approval rating in August 1974,
and Reagan went from 63 percent
to 47 percent from October to
December 1986.
"There hasn't been that kind of
impact for Whitewater," Brody
said. "If Clinton's approval rating
has dropped at all, it hasn't
dropped more than four or five
points. Of course this can change if
something comes out."
While the Whitewater affair contin
ues to grab national headlines, Stanford
political experts maintain that its real
significance will remain unclear until all
of the pertinent information is revealed.
"A lot depends on what the special
counsel brings out," said Political Sci
ence Prof. Richard Brody. "It looks to me
at least at this moment as if there's going
to be very little [electoral! fallout, but
that could change with the emergence of

a 'smoking gun,' assuming that there's
something there."
"It depends completely on what infor
mation comes out," said Hoover Insti
tute Senior Fellow Martin Anderson,
who served under former President
Ronald Reagan.
Whitewater refers to a failed land in
vestment deal in Arkansas during the
late 1970s in which President Clinton
and his wife claim they lost about
$50,000. The current controversy in
volves allegations that Whitewater was
linked to Madison Savings and Loan — a

failed thrift operated by the Clintons'
business partner — and that White
House officials may have improperly
used their positions to influence the fed
eral investigation into Madison.
Political Science Prof. David Brady
said the information will come out be
cause "there's a paper trail and that will
give us a pretty good idea of what went
on."
Because of the lack of known informa
tion, Stanford political experts were hes-
itant to make any predictions
about the outcome of the affair.
The only prediction Anderson
made was that Whitewater will
dominate the news at least through
August because the investigation
will not be completed until then.
"Whitewater is not going to go
away until there's some credible
source that says there's nothing
there. [Special Counsel Robert]
Fiske is the most likely source,"
Brody said.
Brady said the minimum that
the Clintons will have to do is pay
back taxes.
In addition to these predictions,

experts explained why Whitewater
became such a big issue. "I think
the reason why it's become such a
big issue is so much politically is at
stake. . . . The presidency is at
stake," Anderson said.
"The real question that lies
behind all of these other questions
about (presidential adviser George)
Stephanopoulos and the suicide of
deputy White House Counsel Vin
cent Foster and Mrs. Clinton's
investment in the commodities
market is: What did the president
know? When did he know it?" he
added.
Brody said Whitewater has
become such a big issue for two
reasons. "The Democrats made
such a big deal of previous scandals
that the Republicans are getting
back at them on this one ... and

any attempts at covering it up just
make it look like there's more
there than the president claims."
The experts agreed that White
water has hurt the Clinton admin
istration.
Anderson said Whitewater has
already hurt the president. "It is
debilitating. ... When you're deal
ing with a scandal, you don't do
anything else. It puts other things
on the back burner."
"Clinton is slowly being
stripped of his key support staff.
They have either left or are preoc
cupied with dealing with Whitewa
ter," he added.
"The affair has caused the Clin
tons to lose their pure image and
credibility," Brody said. "The bot
tom line is that it didn't help this
presidency. How much it will hurt

them depends on what's there."
Although the affair has harmed
the Clintons, most experts agreed
that the media coverage of White
water has been fair.
"Overall the media has done a
good job of covering the affair,"
Anderson said.
Brody agreed, but said the
media coverage has been a "feed
ing-frenzy in some respects."
