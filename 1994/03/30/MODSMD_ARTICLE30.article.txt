# Softball tops Broncos for first win of the season
## 
### Randy Reback Staff writer 
This season, the Stanford soft
ball team has emphasized making
improvements one day at a time.
While winning has not been
the highest priority, the young
Cardinal players were anxious to
see their efforts rewarded with a
victory. On March 20, they cap
tured that elusive first win of the
season with a 4-1 triumph over
the Santa Clara Broncos.
With this victory, the Cardinal
(1-20) avenged several narrow
losses to the Broncos from earlier
this season.
Freshman Angela Webb
pitched all seven innings for the
Cardinal. Webb struck out eight

batters while walking just one.
"We had a great defensive
game," said Webb. "That was
really what enabled us to win."
One key defensive play was
made by junior Eva Bunker, the
Cardinal left fielder. Bunker
made a difficult over-the-shoul
der catch which prevented sever
al Broncos from scoring.
The hot-hitting Summer Lee
sparked Stanford's offensive with
two hits, two runs scored, and
one run batted in. Lee, a fresh
man, leads the Cardinal hitters
with a .390 batting average.
In the second Cardinal game of
the day, Stanford dropped a 7-0
contest to Bowling Green. Falcon
pitcher Lisa Mountjoy held the
Cardinal to only three hits. With

freshman pitcher Katie Beattie
out of action with a sprained
thumb, the Cardinal pitching
duties were given to Webb and
Lee. The two freshmen hurlers
combined to allow only two
earned runs in a losing effort.
On March 22, the Cardinal lost
two close games to the
Willamette Bearcats. In the open
er, Stanford knocked out only
four hits and was shutout 2-0.
The Cardinal failed to take
advantage of another fine perfor
mance on the mound by Angela
Webb. Webb allowed just four
hits in seven innings and did not
allow an earned run.
The Cardinal offense was more
potent in the nightcap against the
Bearcats, but Stanford suffered a

6-5 loss in extra innings. 'Stan
ford s lead-off hitter, junior
Caryn Okinaga, scored twice
while getting on base in four out
of five plate appearances.
Cardinal errors in the field
again played a large part in the
loss. Wehb and Lee combined to
allow just nine hits, but
Willamette scored four unearned
runs.
"We've been hitting well late
ly, but making too many errors,"
Stanford head coach Sandy
I'earce said. "I've been working
with the players a lot on defense
in practices."
The Cardinal will have that
chance to prepare this week
before traveling to Loyola this
weekend for two double-headers.
