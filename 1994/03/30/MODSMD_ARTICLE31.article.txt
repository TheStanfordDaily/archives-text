# Sailing fares well against top competition

The Stanford sailing team made waves over
spring break when it visited the East Coast and
faced some of its toughest competition to date in
two regattas.
On March 19 and 20, the men watched as
the women raced to second place in the St.
Mary's Invitational in Maryland. In the all
women's event, Stanford faced 17 other
schools, including most of the top-ranked boats
in the nation. Despite their lack of experience
against eastern teams this year, the No. 4-
ranked Stanford women exceeded all their
goals by leading most of the regatta and losing
by a mere two points to Tufts University, the
No. 2-ranked team in the nation.
Sophomore Gretchen Uznis guided Stan
ford's A Division team to victory with help from
a rotating crew of sophomore Sibyl Diver and
freshman Alice Manard. Manard, normally a
skipper, was crew for the first time in her career
as Stanford shifted crews to adjust to the condi-

tions, which ranged from moderate to very cold
and windy.
In the B Division, Stanford fell to fourth as
hodt St. Mary's ran away with the title. Sopho
more Cinnamon Hampikian skippered as junior
Polly Brown and sophomore Michelle Derben
wick served as crew.
Coach Steve Bourdow said while the squad
was a little disappointed with coming up just
short in the end, he was pleased with the team's
success.
"The goal was (to finish inj the top five, and
we upped that to top three after the first day,"
he said.
Diver enjoyed the experience of competing
against the best. "I'm really proud of our team,
especially both of our skippers going in and not
getting intimidated by the competition. It was
really fun."
Both the men and women then spent most of
the next week practicing at St. Mary's and
spending time with their counterparts from
Tufts, who met them again at the Old Dominion
Team Race Intersectional on March 26 and 27.

Only eight teams were at the regatta, but
seven of them were in the top eight in the nation,
including the top six. As the number five team in
the country, Stanford's goal was to make it to
the final round of four teams. They accom
plished that, though by a narrow margin, and
finished in fourth place, behind Tufts (the top
co-ed team in the nation), St. Mary's and Navy.
Stanford's three teams were comprised of
skippers Scott Sellers, senior Jeremy Mclntyre,
and junior Charles Meade, and crew Britt John
son, a senior; and freshmen Don Chennavasin,
Letitia Yang and Alice Manard. As in the St.
Mary's regatta, the crews were adjusted from
race to race to combat the conditions.
Though Stanford struggled in the final
round, senior captain Sellers said the race was a
jump into a higher echelon for Stanford.
"We were pleased," Sellers said. "We showed
that we're definitely one of the top teams in the
country. In years past, we were always one of
the best of the second-tier teams. Now, we're
definitely one of the teams that can go out and
win nationals."
