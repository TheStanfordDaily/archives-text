# The
						second season
## Crew off to fast start 
### Travis Park 
As winter quarter was ending
for most Stanford students, the
season was just beginning for the
men's and women's crew teams
with easy wins over visiting UC-
Santa Barbara March 19.
The men's team, finishing
with a time of 5:56, handily beat
the Santa Barbara squad, which
clocked with a time of 6:09.
"We used Santa Barbara as a
punching bag to warm up for
[the regatta in] San Diego," said
team captain William Porteous.
"Right now, we're using these
pre-season races to test various
combos because our lineups are
not firm."
Because the regatta was held
right after finals, the team did
not have much time to train
before the race, according to
head coach Wieslaw Kujda.
However, the team proved to be
a powerhouse.
"This race was in anticipation
of how we're going to do later on
and winning by such a big mar
gin is an indication that we're
going to be very fast. I'm very
proud of this team," said Kujda.

The women's team, jumping
out to an early lead in the first
half of the race, finished with a
time of 6:47, beating Santa Bar
bara by a substantial margin of
14 seconds.
"We won decisively," said
first-year head coach Jocelyn
McCandless. "I'm pleased with
our performance."
"We had a pretty good, solid
race," noted co-captain Astrid
Palmieri. "Santa Barbara
wasn't big competition for us
but we did well for a first race."
Both teams trained hard over
spring break in preparation for
Saturday's regatta against UC-
Davis and Santa Clara.
"We trained 100 percent over
the break. Now the training is
more relaxed with more racing
oriented preparation," said
Kujda.
Both the men's and women's
teams have more depth, more
parity, and are overall better
than last year's teams.
The men finished the last sea
