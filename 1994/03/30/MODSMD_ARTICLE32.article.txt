# The 						second season
## Crew off to fast start 
### Travis Park 
As winter quarter was ending
for most Stanford students, the
season was just beginning for the
men's and women's crew teams
with easy wins over visiting UC-
Santa Barbara March 19.
The men's team, finishing
with a time of 5:56, handily beat
the Santa Barbara squad, which
clocked with a time of 6:09.
"We used Santa Barbara as a
punching bag to warm up for
[the regatta in] San Diego," said
team captain William Porteous.
"Right now, we're using these
pre-season races to test various
combos because our lineups are
not firm."
Because the regatta was held
right after finals, the team did
not have much time to train
before the race, according to
head coach Wieslaw Kujda.
However, the team proved to be
a powerhouse.
"This race was in anticipation
of how we're going to do later on
and winning by such a big mar
gin is an indication that we're
going to be very fast. I'm very
proud of this team," said Kujda.

The women's team, jumping
out to an early lead in the first
half of the race, finished with a
time of 6:47, beating Santa Bar
bara by a substantial margin of
14 seconds.
"We won decisively," said
first-year head coach Jocelyn
McCandless. "I'm pleased with
our performance."
"We had a pretty good, solid
race," noted co-captain Astrid
Palmieri. "Santa Barbara
wasn't big competition for us
but we did well for a first race."
Both teams trained hard over
spring break in preparation for
Saturday's regatta against UC-
Davis and Santa Clara.
"We trained 100 percent over
the break. Now the training is
more relaxed with more racing
oriented preparation," said
Kujda.
Both the men's and women's
teams have more depth, more
parity, and are overall better
than last year's teams.
The men finished the last sea
son ranked seventh in the coun
try. With six of eight returning
members from last year's varsity
squad, the team expects to do
much better this year.
"This is the best team I've had
since coaching here. We have more
depth than in past years. We've
been improving every year and we
expect to get to the top three in
nationals," said Kujda. "We have
more experience and we're having
fun. That's probably the most
important thing."
One reason for the improve
ment of this year's team, according
to Kujda, is the seniors this year
have been under his guidance
throughout their college crew
careers. Therefore, this team has

been Kujda's creation from the
beginning.
"We have no stars on this team.
Everybody plays a different role.
What makes us so successful is the
level of parity on this team," said
Porteous.
The women, under the guidance
of McCandless, are using a new
rowing technique that should
improve the team's performance.
The team placed fourth last year in
the Pacific 10 Conference and is
expecting to improve on that rank.
"What we need now is experi
ence. But we have a great attitude
which is a big plus," McCandless
said. "Our goal now is to place in
the top two in the Pac-10 and then
to move on to nationals. We'll defi
nitely do better than last year's
fourth place ranking in the Pac
-10."
