# Volleyball sets sights on USC, first place
## 
### Kathryn Yang Staff writer 
The Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation volleyball title will be
decided tonight as No. 5 Stan
ford rolls out the red carpet for
first-place USC at Burnham
Pavilion.
Although the Trojans have a
five-game lead over the Cardinal
in the win column, the teams
have the same number of losses.
The Cardinal (11-7 overall, 8-3 in
the MPSF) must stave off a force
ful Trojan attack (13-3, 12-3) in
order to mount a successful title
defense this season.
However, if the past is any
indication of what's in store for
the future, the Stanford squad
does have a little catching up to
do before the night is out.
Earlier this year, both teams
initiated their preseasons in the
championship round of the UC-
Santa Barbara Tournament
three months ago, with USC
scrapping out a tough 9-15, 15-6,
8-15, 15-8, 9-15 victory. Then, to
add insult to injury, the Trojans
eked out another nailbiter, 15-13,
13-15, 15-10, 15-12 in Southern
California.
Nevertheless, Stanford is hop
ing that the third time is a
charm. Playing in its own back
yard, the Cardinal will have to
neutralize the nation's best hit
ting team in order to claim a
piece of the MPSF title.
"They're the same team that
beat us earlier — with the same
offense and the same six play
ers," said head coach Ruben
Nieves. "There isn't any secret
behind USC's success. They run
a straight-forward offense by set
ting their two best hitters over
and over again."
Indeed, 6-foot-4 opposite hit-

ter Chris Underwood and his
partner in crime, 6-7 swing hitter
Jason Mulholland, have scored
almost at will this year. With 324
and 309 kills respectively, the
two spikers rank fifth and sixth
nationally in kill average,
accounting for USC's top .395
hitting percentage.
For the Cardinal, it all comes
down to execution on defense.
When Stanford battled the Tro
jans in Southern California earli
er, the Cardinal limited Under
wood to a paltry .161 hitting per
centage on 18 kills. Tallying an
enormous 81 digs that night,
Stanford contained the Trojan
attack and allowed USC only 86
kills on the night for a sub-par
.319 average.
While the defense tries to hold
USC in check, Stanford's big hit
ters will shoulder the task of
putting the Cardinal on top dur
ing tight games.
Led by sophomore Matt Fuer
bringer at the opposite position,
Stanford boasts the sixth highest
hitting percentage in the nation.
The 6-7 rookie leads the nation in
average kills per game with 7.21.
Fuerbringer's 462 total kills also
put him atop the Cardinal charts,
followed by sophomore swing hit
ter Mike Lambert with 409 kills.
While not amassing the sheer
numbers of Fuerbringer or Lam
bert, freshman middle blocker
Michael Hoefer's .457 hitting
percentage ranks him among the
nation's elite.
"We probably have more tal
ent than any team in the nation,"
said the 1993 National Player of
the Year Canyon Ceman, who
will man the setting duties
tonight. "But if we don't put it all
together real soon we're going to
see our season ending rather
quickly."
