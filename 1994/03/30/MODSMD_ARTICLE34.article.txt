Stanford football's spring practice took a step backward last
Friday when senior Aaron Mills, the Cardinal's punter last
season, underwent surgery for a torn anterior cruciate liga
ment in his right knee.
Mills, Stanford's only punter, suffered the injury in a scrim
mage with the Pinewood School eighth grade girls' basketball
team, for which he is an assistant coach. Mills said the surgery
was successful, but he probably won't be able to punt again until
August, when he will begin his final season as a Cardinal.
Last season for the Cardinal, Mills averaged 42.2 yards per
punt, fifth best in school history. He was also used for kickoffs and
as the backup placekicker for sophomore Eric Abrams.
As of the beginning of spring drills, there appears to be no
immediate replacement for Mills. Freshman quarterback Scott
Frost punted occasionally in practice last year and could be
used if needed. One of Stanford's recruits for next season,
Kevin Miller, is a punter, but he will not be joining the team
until August.
