## Cal and Stanford students urge "Personal Excellence" 
### Nina Wasow 
In an effort to help the community and improve
its image, a Reserve Officer's Training Corps battal
ion comprised of Stanford and UC-Berkeley students
tutors disadvantaged children in inner city Oakland.
Called the "Personal Excellence" program, it was
started two years ago.
As the Public Affairs officer, midshipman and
Stanford junior Brian Burgin currently coordinates
the program. "Units and ships and departments
from all over the country do tutoring and communi
ty service as part of Personal Excellence," he said.
Burgin and the other volunteers work at Man
zanita Elementary School — which operates year
round — for two and a half hours every Saturday
morning. "It's a school in an impoverished area that
was receptive to having tutors," said Burgin.
Burgin said the tutors work with children on a
wide variety of subjects. "We help with general
schoolwork, basic math and reading in grades
[kindergarten through sixth grade]. The program
tries to focus on underprivileged areas — the streets
aren't a good place for kids to be on Saturdays," he
said. "We get a good cross section of the student
body, but teachers will point out students with prob
lems to us."
Because Stanford has no ROTC program on cam
pus, students are part of a battalion centered at
Berkeley.
Stanford freshman Anthony D'Alessandro — who
helps tutor a group of second-graders — began par
ticipating in the tutoring program this quarter. "We
have definitely made a difference. I've helped kids
learn how to add and subtract. They're in need of
people who care about them," he said. "They want to
learn, and they can learn, but they just don't in a reg
ular classroom situation — I don't know why."

Most participants said they find the program
rewarding for both themselves and the children.
Berkeley senior Scott Corbett got involved this year.
"I just wanted to give it a shot, arid see how little kids
work. It's on Saturday mornings and I'd just be
sleeping anyway. I was looking for things to do to
help the community," he said.
He added, "This has made a difference for the kids
and for all of us. The kids are great; they're volun
teering to be there, too, so we don't have problems
with them. We have a good time."
Others see a benefit not only to the children but
also to the ROTC program. "It was my own way of
contributing to the community. Also, I did it for the
PR," said Berkeley student Matt Evans. "I wanted to
put the ROTC in a better light, and give the navy a
good image— we're not killers. The ROTC isn't real
popular here at Cal. This improves self image within
the battalion."
Corbett said he also enjoys answering the stu
dents' questions about the armed forces. "We talk to
them about the arm}' and navy: when they ask ques
tions, we inform them of what we do. It's not just a
virus to avoid," he said.
Evans said it was a more challenging job than he
had expected. "It can be frustrating. You think
you're a big tough college student, you can handle a
bunch of kids — but they know how to manipulate,
and you don't always know how to handle it. They're
very intimidating," he said.
Evans said it was sometimes difficult to judge
whether the children had learned. "You don't neces
sarily know if you've made a difference to a kinder
gartner," he said.
Despite the challenges, tutors say they enjoy the
program so much that the six weeks per quarter that
they spend working with the children is not enough.
"I wish the program were longer," said Corbett.
