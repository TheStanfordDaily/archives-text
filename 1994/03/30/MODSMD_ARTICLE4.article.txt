### Tish Williams Senior staff writer 
After a year-long bout with can
cer, Asst. Spanish and Portuguese
Prof. Francisco Caetano Lopes Jr.
died at the Stanford Hospital on
March 4. He was 39.
Lopes began teaching at Stan
ford in the fall of 1990 and main
tained his vibrant classroom pres
ence through fall quarter of 1993.
He was on sabbatical at the time of
his death.
A native Brazilian, Lopes
taught classes for both the Depart
ment of Spanish and Portuguese
and the Program in Feminist

Studies.
His innovative
courses, such as
"Postmodern
Brazilian Short
Story" and
"Transatlantic
Feminisms: A Di
alogue Between
'Center' and 'Pe
riphery' or How

Tasty Were My French Sisters" —
which used French theories to illu
minate the post-colonial contexts
of the works of Luso-Brazilian and
Chicana writers and filmmakers


Lopes
— were marked by Lopes' charac
teristic charismatic teaching style
and energy.
"The enthusiastic student
response to his teaching and men
toring was a source of pride both to
him and to the department," said
Michael Predmore, chair of the
Department of Spanish and Por
tuguese.
Remembered by students and
colleagues for his gregarious
nature, Lopes was the lone profes
sor of Luso-Brazilian literature
classes at Stanford. He penned
eight scholarly articles at Stanford
— 20 in the span of his career —
and was a recipient of a Latin-
American Studies grant for sum
mer research in Brazil.
He will be, however, most fond
ly remembered for his teaching
style. "His classes were definitely a
two-way street," said senior
Josephine Ramos. "He learned as
much from us as we did from him,
he cared about what we had to say.
He always engaged us in his work
and his research."
He also lent his energies to the
Bechtel International Center as
well as negotiations with Portugal's
minister of education for the even
tual creation of a lecturer position
on campus in the area of Por
tuguese language and literature.
"He will always be missed," said
Maria-Paz Haro, director of the
Spanish and Portuguese Language
Program. "He was very valuable to
our department, a sweet and friend
ly man who always had a smile. He
was a very human person."

Lopes opened his career in high
er education with two bachelor's
degrees — one in English from the
Institute Cultural Brasil-Estados
Unidos and another in Portuguese
and Luso-Brazilian literatures
from the Universidade Federal do
Rio de Janeiro.
He continued his studies in
Luso-Brazilian literatures, earning
a master's degree from the Univer
sidade Federal Fluminense, a doc
toral degree in 1989 from the Pon
tiflcia Universidade Catolica do Rio
de Janeiro, and a doctorate in
Luso-Brazilian and Latin Ameri
can literatures from the University
of Pittsburgh in 1988.
In front of the classroom, Lopes'
tenure in academia began with a
teaching fellowship from 1974 to
1976 at the Universidade Federal do
Rio de Janeiro. Later he taught for
one year as an associate professor at
the Colegio Brigadeiro Newton
Braga and as a visiting professor at
the Universidade Classica de Lisboa.
He spent two years as an assis
tant professor at the University of
Washington and two more as a
teaching fellow at the University of
Pittsburgh before finally settling
down at Stanford for the remain
der of his teaching career.
"It had been a long time since
we had a professor of Brazilian lit
erature," said Karin Van den Dool,
a senior lecturer in the Depart
ment of Spanish and Portuguese.
"He was a very bright guy, a young
man who planned to make his
career here at Stanford. It's too bad
he had such a short time with us.
He will definitely be missed."
Lopes is survived by his wife,
Maria Luia Lopes. Following his
wishes, no memorial services were
held.
