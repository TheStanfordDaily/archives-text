# Congress may limit indirect-cost growth
## Administrators fear extension of one-year clause 
### Romesh Ratnesar Editorial staff 
Congress is considering a measure in
President Clinton's budget guidelines that
would enact a one-year "pause" on increases
in indirect-cost recovery, raising concerns
among Stanford officials that the govern
ment is setting a dangerous precedent for
more far-reaching caps on federal reim
bursement for research.
Under Clinton's budget blueprint, expen
ditures for indirect costs would not rise by
the $160 million figure originally projected
for fiscal year 1995. Instead, universities
would receive the same monetary sum for in
direct costs they will be given in 1994.
The savings are factored into the House
version of the budget resolution, which is
scheduled to be voted on after the House's
Easter recess, according to Larry Horton,
the University's associate vice president for
public affairs. However, the pause is not cur
rently incorporated into the Senate version,
Horton said. The differences between the
two resolutions will be settled in conference
after both chambers approve their versions
of the budget.
Chief Financial Officer Peter Van Etten
said the pause is "of concern," but said "it is
not certain if this will have a significant im
pact on Stanford this year."
"We had projected that it was unlikely
that the amount we are paid [for indirect
costs] would increase at all," he said.
The University's expectation that the
amount of indirect-cost reimbursement

would not rise next year was based on
changes to the Office of Management and
Budget Circular A-21 enacted last June,
which placed fiscal caps on indirect-cost rates
for administrative and student services.
However, Van Etten warned that if Con
gress approves the halt in funding increases,
lawmakers may be tempted to extend the
pause beyond its proposed one-year life.
"What is of greater concern is that if [Con
gress] can cap overall indirect costs for one
year, who's to say they won't do it for many
years?" he said.
Dean of Research Charles Kruger said
that if the pause in time becomes a freeze,
"we and other universities ... would lose
against inflation every year in our ability to
recover real costs." But he cautioned that
"there are no proposals for anything but a
pause."
A freeze on reimbursement for research
costs could have the effect of curtailing the
volume of research activity, which grew at a
rate of 4.5 percent last year, Kruger said.
The University currently receives about
$280 million from the government in direct
and indirect funding for research. Indirect
costs constitute approximately 25 percent of
that amount.
Indirect costs are overhead expenses that
can not be directly charged to a particular
project, such as libraries or lighting. In the
past, Stanford has haggled with the govern
ment over the rate of reimbursement, mean
ing the number of cents per dollar of spon-
sored direct research that the Uni
versity receives for overhead
expenses.
But Van Etten said the Univer
sity's indirect-cost rate, which
stands at 61 percent, is not at issue
under the current proposal. "To
the extent that direct costs rise, we
get more money," he said. "The
rate itself does not change." But
the proposed pause means that
Stanford and other universities
would receive the same amount of
indirect-cost reimbursement,
regardless of any increases in the
level of research costs.
Van Etten said the University
has protested the measure
through the Association of Ameri
can Universities. "The AAU has
taken a very strong position oppos
ing this," he said.
In a March 8 letter to the White
House, AAU president Jack Pings
wrote that the pause is "bad sci
ence policy, bad public policy, and
flawed budgeting."
"There is no magic here, and

the administration proposal is
simply one to do less research,"
Pings wrote, adding that "the
near-term program impact" of the
pause would be the loss of as many
as 3,500 jobs and cutbacks on hir
ing of new staff and faculty.
Despite such admonitions, Van
Etten seemed somewhat pessimistic
about the chances of swaying
Congress. "We have made a number
of efforts to convince Congress this
is not good public policy." he said.
"And as far as we can tell, these
efforts have not been successful."
But Horton said the prospects
for the measure's ultimate
approval are still "murky."
"Things are quite in flux," he
said. However, Horton allowed
that "the fact that the pause
appears in the president's budget
means there is a high likelihood it
will be affected."
Horton said the movement to
include the pause in the budget
gained a large boost after the
House Science and Technology
Committee earlier this month
approved a re-authorization of the
National Science Foundation
(NSF), which included adoption of
the funding cap.

The Senate's proposed budget
resolution does not include provi
sions for a pause, but the NSF
measure, which itself might inde
pendently lead to the pause
becoming law, still awaits review
by the Senate's Labor and Human
Resources Committee and Com
merce Committee.
"You can have mischief at any
one of these levels," Horton said.
Thus, while the Senate budget res
olution contains rather favorable
wording in reference to indirect
costs, that may be obviated by
either passage of the NSF measure
in its House form or joint confer
ence negotiations on the budget.
Stanford officials agreed that
the pause proposal should not be
attributed bad blood between the
government and higher education.
"This is less concerned with uni
versities and indirect costs than it is
with the federal government being
under pressure to decrease expens
es," Van Etten said.
"It's something that the admin
istration very reluctantly adopted
at the last minute in an attempt to
squeeze more money for the feder
al budget," Horton said. "But it's
still quite serious."
