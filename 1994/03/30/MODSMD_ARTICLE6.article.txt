# Congress may limit indirect-cost growth
## Administrators fear extension of one-year clause 
### Romesh Ratnesar Editorial staff 
Congress is considering a measure in
President Clinton's budget guidelines that
would enact a one-year "pause" on increases
in indirect-cost recovery, raising concerns
among Stanford officials that the govern
ment is setting a dangerous precedent for
more far-reaching caps on federal reim
bursement for research.
Under Clinton's budget blueprint, expen
ditures for indirect costs would not rise by
the $160 million figure originally projected
for fiscal year 1995. Instead, universities
would receive the same monetary sum for in
direct costs they will be given in 1994.
The savings are factored into the House
version of the budget resolution, which is
scheduled to be voted on after the House's
Easter recess, according to Larry Horton,
the University's associate vice president for
public affairs. However, the pause is not cur
rently incorporated into the Senate version,
Horton said. The differences between the
two resolutions will be settled in conference
after both chambers approve their versions
of the budget.
Chief Financial Officer Peter Van Etten
said the pause is "of concern," but said "it is
not certain if this will have a significant im
pact on Stanford this year."
"We had projected that it was unlikely
that the amount we are paid [for indirect
costs] would increase at all," he said.
The University's expectation that the
amount of indirect-cost reimbursement

would not rise next year was based on
changes to the Office of Management and
Budget Circular A-21 enacted last June,
which placed fiscal caps on indirect-cost rates
for administrative and student services.
However, Van Etten warned that if Con
gress approves the halt in funding increases,
lawmakers may be tempted to extend the
pause beyond its proposed one-year life.
"What is of greater concern is that if [Con
gress] can cap overall indirect costs for one
year, who's to say they won't do it for many
years?" he said.
Dean of Research Charles Kruger said
that if the pause in time becomes a freeze,
"we and other universities ... would lose
against inflation every year in our ability to
recover real costs." But he cautioned that
"there are no proposals for anything but a
pause."
A freeze on reimbursement for research
costs could have the effect of curtailing the
volume of research activity, which grew at a
rate of 4.5 percent last year, Kruger said.
The University currently receives about
$280 million from the government in direct
and indirect funding for research. Indirect
costs constitute approximately 25 percent of
that amount.
Indirect costs are overhead expenses that
can not be directly charged to a particular
project, such as libraries or lighting. In the
past, Stanford has haggled with the govern
ment over the rate of reimbursement, mean
ing the number of cents per dollar of spon-
