# ASSU scolds Teamsters for campaign violations
## 
### Jim Luh Staff writer 
The Teamsters slate for the Council of
Presidents is facing a one-third cut in its
campaign spending limit and mandatory
prior review of its campaign activities for a
violation of election rules that occurred in
the Chaparral's recent parody of The
Daily.
The ersatz Daily included an editorial
endorsing Teamsters, which is sponsored
by the Chaparral. The editorial lauded
Teamsters while deriding the opposition
slate, Students' Voice.
The ASSU Bylaws bar COP slates from
campaigning until eight days before the
polls open. As defined by the bylaws, cam
paigning includes "the dissemination of
printed material (excluding editorial mat
ter in student publications) . . . for or

against any candidate, slate, special fee re
quest, general fee issue, or ballot mea
sure."
Hearings Officer Jaasi Munanka said
Teamsters might have been protected by
the exception for "editorial matter," but
he noted the slate's close affiliation with
the Chaparral â€” two members of the
slate, Doug Miro and Tony Sirna, serve as
the Chaparral's editors-in-chief. Munan
ka also cited a rule forbidding "any at
tempt by a candidate, slate or sponsor to
subvert or unethically influence the elec
tion" when he ruled the Chaparral in vio
lation.
As a penalty, Munanka reduced Team
sters' campaign spending limit from $300
to $200. In addition, Munanka must ap
prove in advance any of the slate's future
campaign actions.
"Outside of being thrown out,
this was the heaviest penalty"
possible, Munanka said. "I felt
this was a violation of the spirit
of the election process."
But because of some mitigat
ing circumstances, Munanka
said, "I couldn't really see throw
ing them out or disqualifying
them completely."
In a prior discussion of the
Campaign Practices Code,
Munanka said, he told the Cha
parral that publication of its
annual elections issue was not a
violation of the code. He said the
Chaparral may have construed
his statement to mean that any
pre-election publications would
be acceptable.
Munanka said he also consid
ered the Chaparral's argument
that it had distributed the edito
rial as a small part of the entire
publication and had not engaged
in a more direct campaign activi
ty such as passing out flyers.
Miro said he did not expect the
penalties to have a negative effect
on Teamsters' campaign. He said
the amount Teamsters spends on
its campaign is not as important
as "what we have to say."
Having Munanka review cam
paign activities may even be a
blessing, Miro said, as it will help
clarify what he said were confus
ing campaign rules.
"We misconstrued the rule,"
Miro said. "It's a very vague rule
that I think needs to be redraft
ed."
