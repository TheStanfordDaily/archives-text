# ASSU scolds Teamsters for campaign violations
## 
### Jim Luh Staff writer 
The Teamsters slate for the Council of
Presidents is facing a one-third cut in its
campaign spending limit and mandatory
prior review of its campaign activities for a
violation of election rules that occurred in
the Chaparral's recent parody of The
Daily.
The ersatz Daily included an editorial
endorsing Teamsters, which is sponsored
by the Chaparral. The editorial lauded
Teamsters while deriding the opposition
slate, Students' Voice.
The ASSU Bylaws bar COP slates from
campaigning until eight days before the
polls open. As defined by the bylaws, cam
paigning includes "the dissemination of
printed material (excluding editorial mat
ter in student publications) . . . for or

against any candidate, slate, special fee re
quest, general fee issue, or ballot mea
sure."
Hearings Officer Jaasi Munanka said
Teamsters might have been protected by
the exception for "editorial matter," but
he noted the slate's close affiliation with
the Chaparral â€” two members of the
slate, Doug Miro and Tony Sirna, serve as
the Chaparral's editors-in-chief. Munan
ka also cited a rule forbidding "any at
tempt by a candidate, slate or sponsor to
subvert or unethically influence the elec
tion" when he ruled the Chaparral in vio
lation.
As a penalty, Munanka reduced Team
sters' campaign spending limit from $300
to $200. In addition, Munanka must ap
prove in advance any of the slate's future
