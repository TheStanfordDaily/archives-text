# Team to begin sculpting garden of poles at Roble
## Logs in place; New Guinea artists start in May

When Stanford graduate Jim Mason
showed New Guinea artist Teddy Balangu a
picture of the Rodin Sculpture Garden, the
artist had an interesting reaction.
"This is nothing. We can do better than
this," Balangu said.
Soon he will get his chance.
A team of 10 sculptors from Papua New
Guinea will start work in May on a sculp
ture garden on campus that will be the first
of its kind in America.
Logs of wood specially selected for carv
ing have been imported from Papua New
Guinea and currently sit in the wooded area
in front of Roble Hall. The artists and two
landscape architects will be working on
campus to turn the wood into a garden of
about 15 carved wooden poles, said Mason,
director of the project.
The project started four years ago,
Mason said, when several artists from the
Sepik River region of Papua New Guinea
approached him while he was there doing
research for his master's degree. The
artists wanted to work on an art project in
the West where they could "be in control of

the representation and interpretation of
their art works and culture," he said.
"This project is an experiment in self
representation, an opportunity for these
artists to determine the works presented
and shape the display context in which they
are presented," Mason said.
So Mason set to work raising about
$170,000, getting approval from Stanford
and coordinating the project. He also select
ed the 10 carvers — men of all ages who
come from the Kwoma and Itamul societies
in New Guinea and who have never worked
in North America — to come here and make
the carvings.
Now, after the four years of planning,
the sculpting is ready to begin.
The logs that sit in front of Roble will
soon be turned into about 15 sculptures,
long poles carved by hand with axes, adzes,
knives and chisels, then set upright and an
chored into the ground. Each sculpture will
take from two weeks to twc months to com
plete, Mason said, and the whole installa
tion should be finished within about four
months. Once finished, he said, the sculp
tures should stand for at least 50 years.

New Guinea carvings similar to this one will
soon be sculpted and erected in front of
Roble Hall.
