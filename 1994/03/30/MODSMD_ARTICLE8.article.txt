# Team to begin sculpting garden of poles at Roble
## Logs in place; New Guinea artists start in May 
### Andy Dworkin Senior staff writer 
When Stanford graduate Jim Mason
showed New Guinea artist Teddy Balangu a
picture of the Rodin Sculpture Garden, the
artist had an interesting reaction.
"This is nothing. We can do better than
this," Balangu said.
Soon he will get his chance.
A team of 10 sculptors from Papua New
Guinea will start work in May on a sculp
ture garden on campus that will be the first
of its kind in America.
Logs of wood specially selected for carv
ing have been imported from Papua New
Guinea and currently sit in the wooded area
in front of Roble Hall. The artists and two
landscape architects will be working on
campus to turn the wood into a garden of
about 15 carved wooden poles, said Mason,
director of the project.
The project started four years ago,
Mason said, when several artists from the
Sepik River region of Papua New Guinea
approached him while he was there doing
research for his master's degree. The
artists wanted to work on an art project in
the West where they could "be in control of

the representation and interpretation of
their art works and culture," he said.
"This project is an experiment in self
representation, an opportunity for these
artists to determine the works presented
and shape the display context in which they
are presented," Mason said.
So Mason set to work raising about
$170,000, getting approval from Stanford
and coordinating the project. He also select
ed the 10 carvers — men of all ages who
come from the Kwoma and Itamul societies
in New Guinea and who have never worked
in North America — to come here and make
the carvings.
Now, after the four years of planning,
the sculpting is ready to begin.
The logs that sit in front of Roble will
soon be turned into about 15 sculptures,
long poles carved by hand with axes, adzes,
knives and chisels, then set upright and an
chored into the ground. Each sculpture will
take from two weeks to twc months to com
plete, Mason said, and the whole installa
tion should be finished within about four
months. Once finished, he said, the sculp
tures should stand for at least 50 years.

New Guinea carvings similar to this one will
soon be sculpted and erected in front of
Roble Hall.
The finished sculptures can
include a variety of subjects,
including themes from mythology
or the ideas or interests of the
artists. But, Mason said, there is
no specific format that the artists
are copying.
The artists and landscape
architects will work together once
they arrive at Stanford, and decide
on site what the sculpture garden
will look like, Mason said. The
project is intentionally open
ended, so the artists can "produce
works that respond to the physical
environment here as well as their
experiences here," he said.
The format is, in part, a
response to the way New Guinea
art is often presented in the West:
as primitive arts or simple repro

ductions of one original work.
"These arts are typically pre
sented as anonymous cultural
artifacts — mechanical reproduc
tions of timeless and unchanging
forms," Mason said. "Western
exhibitions have seldom commu
nicated the intentionality and cre
ativity of the individual artists or
the dynamic nature of these artis
tic traditions."
Thomas Seligman, director of
the Stanford Art Museum who
has helped with the project, said
the garden would be part of an
effort to diversify the outdoor art
at Stanford. In addition to the
New Guinea garden, for example,
Seligman said he is "working very
actively" to try and bring a carver
to create a Northwest Coast totem
pole, possibly in about one year.
In addition to bringing a new
art form to campus, the making of
the New Guinea sculpture garden
will be unique in the very high

degree of interaction planned
between the artists, Stanford stu
dents and other area residents.
The site of the garden, where all
the carving will be done, will be open
to the public from about 2 p.m. to 6
p.m. Monday through Friday. Guid
ed tours will be given, and transla
tors will be at the site to allow visi
tors to talk with the artists.
The artists — who will live
together in a house off-campus
while at Stanford — also will tell
myths related to their work with
the translators' help, and drum
ming, dancing and bamboo flute
performances will be given on site.
Weekly lectures will also be offered
on art and culture in Papua New
Guinea and in the West.
The program also will work
with local elementary and middle
schools, providing in-classroom
presentations on New Guinea art
and culture, field trips to the gar
den site at Stanford and classes in
