# Mediator for Webb dispute obtained
## 
### Beth Berselli Staff writer 
After a five-month delay, rep
resentatives from the United
Stanford Workers union and
Webb Ranch have finally set a
date to meet with an independent
arbitrator to settle a housing dis
pute.
On April 21, both parties will
argue their cases to arbitrator
Thomas Angelo, who will then
take 30 to 60 days to decide who
should control the occupancy of
trailers on the Stanford-owned
ranch.
Both parties were pleased that
a decision will soon be reached.
"We just want to get everything
straightened out," said Webb
Ranch manager Tom Hubbard.
"We're very pleased that we're
able to stop the logjam and reach
a decision," union Deputy
Trustee Jon Showalter said.
In 1991, the University offered
eight housing trailers, originally
from Manzanita Park, to anyone
willing to pay the moving costs.
The Webbs, who have leased the
237-acre vegetable and berry
farm from Stanford since 1922,
paid the costs and the trailers
now reside at the ranch.
The dispute arose when the
union claimed that the Webbs

were illegally denying housing to
workers by allowing non-workers
occupancy of the trailers. The
Webbs claim that they should be
responsible for deciding who gets
to live in the trailers, while the
union contends that it should be
the workers' decision.
"What we'd like to have hap
pen is to have the arbitrator
award the trailers to the union
workers so that they can decide
who lives there," Showalter said.
"The decision who gets to live in
these trailers should be a demo
cratic one, not one made by the
boss."
The arbitration process was
halted due to difficulties in

obtaining an arbitrator. Union
representatives maintained that
the Webbs used a clause in the
contract to block arbitration.
The clause states that the arbi
trator must be able to meet with
the concerned parties within
seven days of selection. An arbi
trator was chosen in mid-Novem
ber, but because of scheduling
conflicts, he was unable to hear
the grievances within the
required time period.
But the Webb's lawyer, Terry
O'Connor, said the family had no
interest in delaying arbitration
and that scheduling conflicts are
common during the arbitration
process.
