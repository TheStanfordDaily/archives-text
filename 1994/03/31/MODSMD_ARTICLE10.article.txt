# China will agree to pressure North Korea
## Weak U.N. resolution expected to pass, South Korean diplomat says 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - China will
permit the U.N. Security Council to
approve a resolution urging North
Korea to open its suspect nuclear sites
to international inspectors, South
Korea's foreign minister said yesterday.
But the minister, Han Seung-joo,
said the resolution would impose "mini
mum requirements," and the State
Department spokesman said it may be a
month before another, tougher, resolu
tion is presented to the council.
The International Atomic Energy
Agency in the meantime will evaluate
data collected during inspections in
March to determine whether North
Korea has an active program to develop
nuclear weapons, department
spokesman Michael McCurry said.
Such a finding would have "grave

consequences," he said.
Han, talking to reporters after a 50-
minute meeting with Secretary of State
Warren Christopher, said "the Chinese
are on board in the sense of discussing
the form and contents of a Security
Council resolution."
Though this means "there will be
minimum requirements" in the resolu
tion, "I think it is unlikely the Chinese
will veto the kind of resolution we are
working on right now," Han said.
China has urged a go-slow approach
toward North Korea, with whom it has
close ties. Christopher, mindful of
China's power to kill any resolution, has
decided to stagger the resolutions in a
way that would give North Korea more
time to accept international inspectors
before risking U.N. economic sanctions.

"I think we're very much in a unified
position with respect to the United
Nations Security Council," Christopher
said.
"We are going to be urging a resolu
tion there. One thing I would stress is
that we're consulting very closely with
all the parties, including the Chinese,
about the best way to encourage the
North Koreans to take the steps that
the international community wants
them to take."
Han lined up his government with
the United States in trying to pry open
suspect North Korean nuclear sites.
But he said there were "some di(Ter
ences in emphasis" with China.
Reporting to Christopher on talks in
Japan and China, he said "the Chinese
have been emphasizing the importance

of dialogue." The goal, he said, should
be adoption of an "effective and realis
tic" resolution by the Security Council.
Lake said U.N. Ambassador
Madeleine Albright was meeting with
Chinese, British, French and Russian
diplomats in New York "to work
through a resolution that can take care
of some of the Chinese concerns and
still come up with a very firm interna
tional position."
Lake said that could lead to "broad
talks" with North Korea about its
future and the nuclear issue.
"Korea is a very serious issue but it is
very important that we not overreact to
North Korean rhetoric," the White
House official said. North Korea has
threatened to turn South Korea into a
"sea of fire."
