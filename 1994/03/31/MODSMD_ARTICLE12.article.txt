## Editorials Making some points 
### 
UNDER THE CURRENT
food service policy, students
on the points system have
considerably more choice than stu
dents on the traditional meal plan.
Students on points — unlike
their counterparts on weekly meal
plans — enjoy higher-quality food,
more variety and open access to
canned drinks, frozen yogurt, and
other such amenities. They also
have the freedom to eat with friends
in any residential dining facility on
campus. While students on points
can eat at dining halls that have con
ventional meal plans, students on
these weekly meal plans cannot use
their meal voucher to eat at dining
halls that use points systems.
Students on weekly meal plans
should not be forced to eat what is
generally considered to be lower
quality food, while others can "shop
around" when making their dining
choices.
Adopting the points system in
every residential dining facility on

campus is one alternative that
would be fairer and give more choic
es to students.
Such a change would not, as the
University might contend, weaken
dorm community by causing fewer
residents to dine in their own dining
halls. Most students choose to dine
where it is most convenient, assum
ing the food is tolerable.
A campus-wide points system
would encourage the less reputable
dining facilities to rise to the level
of their "competitors." It would
allow students who are now on the
inflexible meal plan system the lux
ury of purchasing yogurt, deli sand
wiches and grilled hamburgers
whenever they dislike the selection
of entrees.
By providing students with more
choices in their own dining halls, a
comprehensive points system would
keep them at home and be more fair
to everyone. Real community begins
with a full stomach and a pleased
palate.
