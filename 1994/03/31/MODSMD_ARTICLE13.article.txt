# Fulfill the mission

SPRING QUARTER on the
Farm. With the bright sun and
temperate weather, the Stan
ford campus seems to slow down a
notch. As the Commission on
Undergraduate Education enters
the last phase of its examination of
the Stanford undergraduate experi
ence, however, its members should
make sure they don't relax with the
rest of the campus.
When the commission releases a
draft report of its findings in June,
it should remember the primary
reason for its existence — to pro
pose substantial reforms to improve
the Stanford educational experi
ence. In his first "State of the Uni
versity" address on April 29 last
year, University President Gerhard
Casper announced the group's sim
ple goal: to "clarify the purpose of
[Stanford's] undergraduate pro
grams and see to it that the content
of our programs clearly supports
that purpose."
Now is not the time to back off

from bold change and innovation.
Though a great university, Stanford
is certainly not perfect. The system
of distribution requirements and
academic calendar, for example,
needs serious reconsideration.
The last comprehensive reexami
nation — the three-year Study of
Education at Stanford, ending in
1968 — resulted in sweeping rec
ommendations which cut the num
ber of distribution requirements
and abolished the Western Civiliza
tion requirement. Since then, occa
sional tinkering with the curricu
lum has changed things — the cre
ation of Cultures, Ideas and Values
in 1988, for example — but these
reforms have lacked the encom
passing vision that CUE can set
forth.
The commission cannot afford to
slack off at such a crucial time for
the University. Its work is too
important, and perhaps necessary,
for the continuation of quality edu
cation at Stanford.
