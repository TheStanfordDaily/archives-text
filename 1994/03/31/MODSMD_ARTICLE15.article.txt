## An educational apocalypse 
### 
IT'S OVER. Se fin. Kaput. This is the
end, the end of the world as we know
it. If you're Jewish it's the coming of
the Messiah, the REAL Messiah. For
Christians, Christ is right around the
corner — no joke. And, for Muslims,
that pilgrimage to Mecca is about to
really pay off.
What? You don't believe me? Well,
let's take a look at the world in the past,
oh, 10 months or so. We've had terrible
floods in the Midwest, killing people and
causing millions in damage. Then fires
ripped through Los Angeles and left the
landscape a smoldering mess.
And what about the recent earth
quake that uncovered an unknown fault
line? Of course, that shouldn't over
shadow the cold spell on the East Coast
that shut down the federal government
and every non-essential private busi
ness — a freeze that killed as many peo
ple as the 6.6 quake. And California
only recently emerged from a major
drought that mimicked the crop-killing
scorcher of the Midwest a few years ago.
Throw in some of last year's hurri
canes and the recent tornado in Alaba
ma for good measure, and there you
have it. When people are dying in
church, it's got to be bad. For God's
sake, Telly Savalas and Frank Zappa
both recently died. No doubt about it,
the apocalypse is here.
Face it. Not even your Chem E class

es can save you now. But maybe these
threats are what we need to shake us up
a little bit and remind us of what's
important.
We're talking about cosmic powers
here. The divine. We've got flood, fire,
an Arctic spell, drought, earthquake
. . . what more could you ask for? If we
were living a few hundred years ago
Stanford would be a mess. People
would frantically run around scream
ing, "The world is over and I haven't
even graduated yet!" Wait a minute . . .
Stanford didn't exist a few hundred
years ago. Wait another minute . . .
Stanford is a mess.
That's right. Even our little haven
next door to one of the murder capitals
of the world is facing a schism similar to
that of the government.
Our sax-playing national president
may just be an under the table wheeler
dealer and our seemingly good-natured
Big Game Gaieties-performing Stanford
president had the gall to call N'Gai
Croal's budget-cut critiquing column
"shit" in front of a group of students at
Donner.
Is nothing sacred? Have we all
turned into Tourette's victims? The
budget is the first big issue with enough
power to rally the student body togeth
er since the Los Angeles riots, and now
we're fighting the administration.
Worse yet, administrators are fighting

us. People are calling for resignations,
there's mud slinging galore, and no one
knows what happened to the COP.
Let's not walk away from the budget
cuts with hoarse voices and angry mem
ories. Instead, we should understand
that this is an experience to prepare for
and learn from, regardless of the
results.
Perhaps the challenges Stanford
faces will teach all of us what we value,
what we need and what really matters:
a sense of community and togetherness.
I'm not talking about everybody tak
ing off their clothes and holding hands
in the Quad. But I am talking about
participation in town meetings. We
need a student group coalition to help
us adjust to changes resulting from
budget cuts. Beyond group efforts, indi
viduals should think about what makes
this a place for all of us rather than each
of us.
If this really is the apocalypse, we
have to ask ourselves about what mat
ters — working things out rather than
working each other over.
