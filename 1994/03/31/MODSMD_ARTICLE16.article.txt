## ASSU financial manager sheds light on Light's letter 
### 
IN REGARD TO several points fur
thered by George Evans Light's let
ter to the editor printed on Monday,
I offer this response.
Light complains about "exorbitant
banking fees." The ASSU's operations
are self-sufficient and not reliant on a
general student banking fee. The ASSU
fee that appears on everyone's tuition
bill is not a banking fee. This money is
reallocated to special fee student
groups on campus such as the Legal
Counseling Office and the Stanford
Concert Network. Each spring quarter,

an election is held in which each stu
dent can vote on whether or not to
fund these groups.
The ASSU fee has gotten where it is
only because a majority of the students
voted it that way last spring. In the
upcoming election this spring, I
encourage all students to vote so that
the groups which get funded by all the
students accurately reflect the needs of
all the students.
Light claims that the ASSU is into
deficit budgeting. I will happily show
anyone who is interested in our current

and past budgets, as well as audited
statements, which prove that this is sim
ply a lie. Each year a balanced budget is
developed, and each year the ASSU as a
whole maintains its financial strength.
Finally, regarding the Campus Cur
rents publication, everyone is entitled
to hold an opinion. Campus Currents
serves as a source of information
regarding just about everything involv
ing the ASSU, from service project
information to the latest Senate activi
ty. If you feel that this information is
not useful, then by all means, don't

read it â€” it's your right.
This year the ASSU continually has
been under fire from students who
simply do not have enough information
to support their claims. Anyone who
takes the time to investigate the actual
activities of the ASSU will be assured
that it is an organization which has a
lot of students who are trying to make
a difference, and clearly not a source of
"rank corruption."
