Yesterday's editorial "Losing the
Memory" did not specify that its refer
ence to "youngsters" on the Farm, which
included a mention of Provost Con
doleezza Rice, meant new members of the
University's top administrative ranks,
and not new members of the University.
Rice has been on the Stanford faculty for
13 years.
