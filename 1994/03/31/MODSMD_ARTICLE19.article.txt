## Lambert riding wave of success Surfer turned spiker has proven one of Stanford's most versatile players 
### Kathryn Yang Staff writer 
While the crusty Northern California
shores remain frosted in wintry shades of gray,
every bone in Mike Lambert's 6-foot-6 frame is
aching for the paradise he calls home.
Conquering the Pacific Ocean waves near
his Kaneohe, Hawaii home is decidedly a better
alternative than cozying up in Green Library
this spring.
However, throw in a tremendous starting role
on the Stanford volleyball squad and a possible
trip to the Final Four this season, and Lambert
will undoubtedly settle for his old, beat-up skate
board — the surfboard wax can wait.
Prioritizing volleyball wasn't always the
case though, as Lambert lived the glorious life
of a beach bum before becoming serious about
volleyball during the last few years of high
school. And even then, most of his spiking
skills were forged under the Hawaiian sun and
not indoors on the hardwood.
"My life really revolved around surfing,
because I was always thinking about it and skip
ping classes to go surf," Lambert said. "But
while I was out on the beach, I would also play
beach and club volleyball for fun."
For a pastime which played second fiddle to
his passion for the waves, Lambert didn't do a
shabby job at all. In fact, the sophomore gar
nered First Team Ail-American honors in vol
leyball his junior and senior years in addition
to winning a gold medal at the 1991 Junior
Olympics.
Considered to be the prize of his recruiting
class, Lambert then passed up offers from top
ranked UCLA (where his older sister Mia start
ed for the Bruins in the back court) in favor of
a brighter future on the Farm.
"Everyone in volleyball looks at this guy and
says that he should be a First Team All-Ameri
can and that he should be on the national team,"
said head coach Ruben Nieves. "It's nice to have
that kind of potential, but it's also a burden."
In answer to that challenge, Lambert has
become one of the most complete all-around
volleyball players in the game today. Entering

Stanford as a middle blocker/opposite hitter,
Lambert has since switched to the swing hit
ting position, where he has honed his skills as
an excellent serve receiver.
Playing behind Ail-American opposite hitter
Dave Goss last season, the rookie posted a solid
.314 hitting percentage with 156 kills against 64
errors in 17 matches. More importantly, howev
er, Lambert developed into a tremendous passer
and has assumed the swing hitting duties this
season with the graduation of both Bob Hillman
and Ryan Moos last year.
"Swing hitting in my opinion requires the
most mental toughness on the court, because
every time the other team serves you are a tar
get," Nieves said. "If you miss-pass the ball you
risk giving up a point, and Mike realizes what
this position is all about."
Indeed, opponents tend to shy away from
Lambert, preferring to try their luck against
another first-time passer, senior captain Joe
Burghardt.
"Other teams perceive Mike as a strong pass
er, so he hasn't been tested as much this year,"
Nieves continued. "His serve-receive skills have
improved tremendously from last year."
For some swing hitters, passing is already a
full-time job. However, Lambert refuses to rest
on his laurels. In addition to his pivotal passing
role, Lambert has also pounded out 409 kills for
a respectable .315 hitting percentage. His 6.02
kills per game average ranks him as the 10th
most effective attacker in the nation.
"Mike is such a good player, and we rely on
him so much that sometimes it must be over
whelming," Nieves said.
Regardless of this pressure, the sophomore
sees himself "as one of the leaders on the team"
and admits that, "I think I bring enough skills
onto the court where I don't lag in any particu
lar area."
You name it and he does it. In addition to
passing and hitting, Lambert has also been
touted as the team's best natural blocker —
despite playing on the outside.
"Usually we put Mike on our opponent's best
hitter at the net," Nieves said. "We don't count
on his blocking as much as his passing and hit

ting, but when he contributes to the block, it
gives the team a tremendous boost.
"Overall, he's probably the team's most com
plete player, and I believe that he is the most tal
ented volleyball player that has ever entered
Stanford's program. Mike can do whatever he
wants in this sport as long as he sets his mind to
it and dedicates himself to volleyball."
Staying on track won't be too tough, consid
ering Lambert's aspirations of a pro beach vol
leyball career. "If I'm good enough I would love
to play with someone like Canyon [Cemanl on
the beach alter I graduate from Stanford."
Ceman, last year's National Player of the
Year, replied, "I tell him every day, 'Mike, come
find me after you graduate.' I think we'll make
a great team because Mike's got a complete vol
leyball game."
According to the Hawaiian, beach volleyball
was what sharpened his game and allowed him
to dominate in all aspects of the trade. And
besides, where there's sand, there must be surf.
