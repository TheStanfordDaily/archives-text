The dam broke last night and a tremen
dous flood of inspired play propelled the No.
5 Stanford volleyball squad past No. 3 USC
in a all-important "David vs. Goliath"-esque
battle.
Coming into the game with a 0-2 record
against the first-place Trojans (13-4 overall,
12-4 in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion), Stanford (12-7, 9-3) pulled off its
biggest upset of the season with a 15-13,14-
16,15-8,15-12 victory.
Dominating all aspects of the match, the
Cardinal finished with an astounding .400
hitting percentage and 104 kills on
offense, in addition to 35 digs and
24 total blocks. However, the differ
ence in the ball game came with
Stanford's best passing and serving
effort of the season.
"We knew we had the potential
to beat them, and we really went to
work tonight," said senior setter
Canyon Ceman. "We kept them off
balance with our serving and forced
them to hit against a two-man
block most of the time."
Stanford struggled with numer
ous hitting and passing errors early
on. Slipping to 7-1 at one point in
the first game, the Cardinal relied
on Ceman's serving and defense to

dig itself out of the hole.
"We made some communication
errors in the first game, but we
went afler USC from start to fin
ish," said head coach Ruben Nieves.
"Canyon was a big part of that, not
only with his sets, but also with his
blocking and serving. I think he had
his best match of the season."
Afler knotting the score at 11-
11, Stanford jumped ahead for good
and closed the door on USC.
In game three, Stanford surged
out ahead 8-1, however, USC man
aged a seven-point comeback to
eventually take the lead at 14-15.
Receiving on game point, Cardi
nal captain Joe Burghardt floated a
pass over the net, and USC's Jason
Mulholland pounced on the error
for one of his 37 kills â€” breaking
Stanford's heart at 14-16.
"It was the most discouraging

point of the game, because that
evened the score at one game apiece
and put us back to square one,"
Nieves said. "We felt like we were in
control and that really disappointed
the guys."
Nevertheless, Nieves praised his
team for being able to rebound from
that disheartening loss in game
three. Cruising to a 13-3 advantage,
the Cardinal held on this time to
punish USC 15-8. From there Stan
ford dominated the match and final
ly sent the Trojans home with a 15-
12 final in game four.
Overall, the Cardinal contained
USC to a sub-par .335 performance
at the net, while Stanford spikers
Mike Lambert, Matt Fuerbringer
and Ceman shined. Lambert came
through with 35 kills (.458 hitting
percentage), Fuerbringer tallied 32
and Ceman orchestrated 94 sets.
