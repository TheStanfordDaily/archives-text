# Spotlight on women
## Ad campaign featuring Foudy a long overdue first step 
### 
Tomboy. Alright, call me a tomboy" reads a new Reebok ad
accompanied by a shot of Julie Foudy, ex-Stanford soccer
star, in mid-flight. Flashy multi-page spreads pitching the
latest, most high-tech shoes are not at all unusual. However, this
one is different — four women grace its pages.
Foudy is one of four amazing athletes featured in the newest
Planet Reebok campaign along with Nancy Kerrigan, Gin Miller,

the creator of the Step Reebok Program, and
rock climber Nancy Feagin. While readers of
newspaper and magazine sports sections are
constantly bombarded by images of male foot
ball, basketball and baseball mega-stars, only
rarely is a female face glimpsed in these high
priced glossy spreads.
In fact, women athletes as spokespeople for
major sports advertisers tend to be the excep
tion in magazines such as Sports Illustrated. It
follows that women's events receive similarly

pathetic coverage in the mainstream media.
This extreme lack of exposure hurts the female athletes them
selves who are already faced with fewer professional opportuni
ties than their male counterparts. But this inadequacy is per
haps most detrimental to the younger generation of girls. These
potential collegiate and professional players — whether they be
little league softball sluggers, aspiring skaters or the stars of
their junior high volleyball teams — lack the same strong role
models boys grow up with.
Sure, girls can still memorize batting averages, swap baseball
cards and follow favorite players with the same devotion as boys.

With so few stories or ads focusing on women, however, girls
miss out on the same feelings of identtfJ<ii|iOn ,411$

The Planet Reebok ads and similar Nike campaigns high
lighting women runners and aerobicizers are signals that this
trend may be changing. As advertisers have begun to realize the
incredible money-making potential in the women's athletic shoe

and work-out wear markets, the number of
female spokespeople has increased over the
past few years, yet still remains drastically low
in comparison.
While these female-centered cam
paigns are definitely encouraging, many of the
women in the photos sweating away at bench
aerobics or relating their personal thoughts
are nameless models who happen to have well
proportioned, muscular bodies. They may be
tanned and toned but girls will benefit most by

seeing real athletes in action — women who are competing pro
fessionally, scoring goals, breaking records.
Such women do exist. Foudy, now a member of the U.S.
National team, is one of many female athletes who has devoted
an incredible amount of time and energy to her sport and whose
achievements deserve both coverage and praise. Her photo,
while an encouraging indication of heightened advertising inter
est in women's sports, could also be a starting point for more in
depth profiles and features of Foudy, her teammates, and play-

ers on other national teams.
While collegiate athletes cannot
accept money from advertisers,
female student athletes are poten
tial models, but are many times rel

egated to the back of the sports sec
tion. Newspaper coverage of the
NCAA basketball still emphasizes
the men's bracket over the
women's as the "women's NCAA
tournament" is often designated
from the NCAA tournament.
Foudy, professional female play
ers and collegiate athletes are all
the kind of real-life role models

that girls and amateur female ath
letes of all ages can look up to. Only
when given more media attention,
however, will their intensity and
accomplishments be adequately
related, their statistics memorized
and, eventually, their cards traded.

Sarah would like to thank Sarah
Rafanelli for her insights.
