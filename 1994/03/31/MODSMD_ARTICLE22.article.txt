# Baseball takes on Cal
## Cardinal seeks redemption in weekend series 
### Swaminatha Gurudevan Staff writer 
No matter what the spoil, it's always
good to crush Cal.
The Stanford baseball team will try to
make good on this saying today as it
opens a three-game series with California
at Sunken Diamond.
The Cardinal enters the series with an
18-12 record overall, while the Golden
Bears' season mark stands at 16-18. One
could call this "The Big Series," since it
should have a significant impact on the
balance of power in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence Southern Division. Stanford, Cal
and Arizona State are each tied for second
place in the Six-Pac with a 7-5 record, one
and a half games behind front-running
use.
Stanford is coming off an embarrass
ing loss to University of San Francisco
Tuesday at Benedetti Diamond in San
Francisco. Freshman righthander J.D.
Brammer was chased after only two
thirds of an inning after giving up four
runs on five hits, and the five Stanford

pitchers who followed could do little to
stop the bleeding in an 18-5 rout.
Despite a 27-4 explosion over Arizona
by Stanford in last weekend's rubber
game in Tucson, Ariz., Cardinal coach
Mark Marquess believes the team still
needs to improve its offense.
"I don't think offensively we've been
consistent at all," Marquess said.
"Despite the 27 runs [Sunday], that was
one game. We came back [Tuesday] and
we could only score five."
Senior designated hitter Nate Olm
stead leads all Cardinal batters with a
.381 average and has been the team's
hottest hitter all year long. Olmstead has
hit in till but three of 28 games this sea
son, and has had 10 multi-hit games.
Cardinal catcher A.J. Hinch has been
on a tear recently, hitting .480 (12-for-25)
in his last seven games, while junior sec
ond baseman Jed Hansen has been equal
ly hot, batting .429 (15-for-35) in his last
eight games.
"We need to play the way we can play
and not worry about what the
other teams are going to be doing
against us," Hansen said. "We just
need to do what we can do and let

things fall into place."
Sophomore Dan Reed will likely
start for the Cardinal today. In
nine starts, the lefthander has
compiled a 5-2 record with an ERA
of 2.65, best among starters, and
leads the team with 44 strikeouts.
Rounding out the Cardinal
pitching for this weekend will be

freshman righthander Jason Mid
dlebrook (4-0, 2.84 ERA) and
sophomore righthander Todd Bar
tels (3-1,4.32 ERA).
"Cal has got a little bit of speed
and a little bit of power," Marquess
said. "There's not one area where
you would say, 'That's the
strength of their team.' "
