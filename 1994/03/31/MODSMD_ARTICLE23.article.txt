# Men's tennis up for L.A. challenges
## 
### Mike Langford Senior staff writer 
The undefeated and top-ranked Stanford men's
tennis team will face the two most difficult challenges
of its season this weekend when UCLA and USC visit
the Cardinal (15-0) for two crucial Pacific 10 Confer
ence dual matches.
"These will definitely be the two toughest matches
of the year thus far," said Stanford head tennis coach
Dick Gould. "Both teams are contenders for the
national title."
In fact, USC did win the national title last year,
behind a deep and talented lineup, much of which
returned this year. The No. 7-ranked Trojans boast a
record of 13-1, with its only loss coming to No. 3 Ken
tucky in Louisville at the National Team Indoors
Tournament.
Stanford will counter these opponents with a
healthy lineup coming off two strong conference wins
at Arizona and Arizona State. Stanford seniors
Michael Flanagan, Bobby Devens, Vimal Patel and
Chris Cocotos will assuredly look to continue their
solid and consistent play in their last home matches
against these two historic rivals.
The top of USC's lineup is perhaps the strongest in

the nation. At first singles, junior Wayne Black is the
No. 2-ranked collegiate singles player in the country,
and owns a 16-3 match record. At second singles,
senior Jon Leach, nationally ranked 13th, has a 20-7
match record. Together, Black and Leach form the
tenth-ranked doubles team in the nation.
At No. 3 singles, senior Brett Hansen, a transfer
from UC-Irvine, has already played two years on the
pro circuit (as an amateur). Adam Peterson and
Lukas Hovorka, at fourth and fifth singles, respec
tively, provide talented depth, and together form a
highly-ranked doubles team. Chad Rosser plays at
sixth singles, and pairs with Hansen for the Trojan's
third doubles team.
"lUSCI has been blowing teams out," Gould said.
"Black and Ix i ach have been playing great tennis.
They have outstanding doubles teams. They are very
capable of winning the national championship again."
From the way UCI.A has been progressing, the Bru
ins will challenge for the title as well. Last year UCLA
won the National Indoor title and finished the year
with a 24-3 dual match record. This year, the Bruins
sport a 12-3 overall dual match record, and only one
loss in conference, that coming at the hands of USC.

record this weekend against the Los Angeles teams.
