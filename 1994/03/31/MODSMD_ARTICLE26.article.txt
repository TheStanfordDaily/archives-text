# No. 3 netters head south

### Rob Ross Senior staff writer 
The rivalry isn't what it used to be.
In years past, when the Stanford women's tennis
team took its road trip to play USC and UCLA, one
could expect close scores and heart-wrenching match
es. This season, though, both Los Angeles squads have
met with early disappointments and, if the rankings
hold, should be merely more fodder for a loaded Stan
ford team (16-1) during this weekend's road trip.
Yet in fierce rivalries such as these, rankings and
past performances can be disregarded.
"No matter what, we always seem to play well
against them and they seem to play well against us,"
said Stanford head coach Frank Brennan. "You can
just throw the rankings out the window."
Given its No. 3 national standing, the Cardinal
rarely wants to throw out the rankings. But as No. 20
USC's (6-6) defeat of No. 12-ranked UCLA (11-4) last
Friday displayed, surprising upsets are anything but
surprising in the powerful Pacific 10 Conference
Southern Division this season.
The Bruins are first on the Cardinal's agenda, slat
ed for a 1:30 p.m. start tomorrow in Westwood. This
year's UCLA team lacks the depth of its past top-five
squads, but it makes up for this with one of the most
powerful one-two punches in the nation.
At No. 1 singles, sophomore Jane Chi presents a
challenge for Stanford's top player, senior Laxmi

Poruri. Chi, the seventh-ranked player in the nation,
rushes the net at every opportunity and runs down
most everything on the court. Yet she recently lost a
close match to Arizona State's Kori Davidson, who
Poruri vanquished easily three weeks ago at home.
Sophomore Keri Phebus presents more of a chal
lenge for Stanford and, in particular, the Cardinal's
No. 2 player Kristine Kurth. Phebus refrains from net
play, preferring to stay on the baseline and hammer
away. Ranked 23rd in the nation, she will give Kurth
(now ranked 54th) a strong battle.
"Kristine will definitely have her hands full," Bren
nan said of his Ail-American senior who recently suf
fered her worst defeat of the season at the hands of
California's Pam Nelson.
After those two, though, the Bruins have no one
else ranked in the nation's top 100, which should
translate into wins for the Cardinal's bottom four sin
gles players, all of whom are ranked in the top 70.
The Trojans, Stanford's Saturday opponent, don't
have the knockout punch their cross-town rivals pos
sess. Yet their depth carried them past the Bruins and
may help this borderline squad slip into the NCAA
Championship brackets in May. None of USC's singles
players are ranked in the top 20, yet the team's Nos. 3
and 4, Maggie Simkova and Melissa Hernando, are
both rated among the nation's best fifty.
So while neither Los Angeles school is at its best this
season, both present different obstacles for the Cardinal
to face and overcome in order to arrive home victorious.
