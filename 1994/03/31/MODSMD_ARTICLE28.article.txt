# Secretly admiring the '80s Lindsey Marcus
## 
### 
I never knew sitting down to watch a
movie could be such a frustrating,
drawn-out experience.
But a few weeks ago, I was coaxed, ca
joled, coerced, threatened and ultimately
physically forced to park myself on a couch
with some buddies and watch "Secret Ad
mirer." In case you missed this 1985 box of
fice spectacular, "Secret Admirer" is a, um,
comedy about quenching teenage lust by
finding that true love in the boy who's clos
er than he seems (three cheers for tired plot
lines!).
But for all its corniness, lack of substance
and disgraceful acting, "Secret Admirer"
took me back. Back to those strange yet for
mative years: the '80s. Back to that blissful
decade of memorizing John Hughes flicks,
wanting to adorn my body with only Guess?
and Esprit products and trying to incorpo
rate the word "like" into my vocabulary to
the point where it seemed to be every other
sound I uttered. And I remembered why I
love this genre of film.
Many of us would like to discount those

days of past glory, when we thought it
looked cool to cram as many black rubber
bracelets on our arms as possible like the
heroine of the time, Madonna (how much
did you want to be a material girl?). Howev
er, these years are valuable — after all, what
other time best symbolizes our unfettered
dreams and idealistic speculation of what
post-adolescent life would hold?
And while we may look back and groan
at those movies we looked forward to rent
ing over and over again in junior high, they
deserve some credit for sparking our imagi
nations. They were movies about us, about
ordinary kids who had experiences that
were a little out of the ordinary.
There were so many possibilities: show
ing an extra terrestrial the ways of the world
and getting to ride an airborne bike ("E.T.");
stealing the dance floor at prom ("Foot

loose"); outsmarting teachers, parents and
the government with a superior knowledge
of computers ("Wargames"); crawling
through the sewer system in search of a pi
rate's treasure ("The Goonies"); and, per
haps best of all, seeing our parents' roman
tic courtship ("Back to the Future").
Girls, don't you dare tell me you didn't
increase your carrot intake after seeing "Six
teen Candles."
Movies of the last decade also taught
practical lessons of how the world works.
We were instructed how to fake sick to stay
home from school ("Ferris Bueller's Day
Off"); how to make detention a positive ex
perience ("The Breakfast Club"); how to
make your own hideous prom dress ("Pret
ty in Pink"); how to get a good view of the
opposite sex using locker rooms
("Porky s"); and how winning the girl often

requires being the high school football stud
("Lucas"). What better rite of passage for us
up-and-coming taxpayers?
The newest movie about our generation,
"Reality Bites," paints a somewhat depress
ing picture of the real world after being re
leased from the cushy college atmosphere.
Jobs, love, money and direction become the
focus of existence.
Critics have noted that "Reality Bites"
wisely and accurately portrays the plight of
recent college grads and has been rightly
called the "Big Chill" of the MTV genera
tion. But I still prefer cheerier visions of
what the future holds. Maybe the Stanford
experience is still too new for me to want to
look beyond it. Maybe the bite of immaturi
ty I felt during my residence in an all-fresh
man dorm hasn't healed yet. Maybe I'm a
born optimist (I hope that's not it).
Whatever the reason, I love to hang out
and laugh at (and with) a "cheesy" '80s flick.
I think I'll take some wise advice and write a
letter to that boy I've been secretly admir
ing. Hopefully he'll find me out. ■
