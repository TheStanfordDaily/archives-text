### ARNOLD PAN 
hen I first mention to
vocalist/guitarist
Dean Wareham a show at
the Edge some year and a half ago which in
troduced me to his band, he doesn't seem to
remember it. After all, who's going to recall
opening for the Screaming Trees that far back
in some small nightclub in Palo Alto after
you've gone to bigger and better things, like
touring with the Velvet Underground in Eu
rope?
Yet with a little help, Wareham pinpoints
that night two autumns ago.
"That was the second to last night [of the
tour with the Screaming Trees). We all played
'Sweet Jane' and our drummer Stanley
(Demeski) sang it," Wareham reminds me.
"He has never lived that down."
Whether it's his snapshot-sharp memory
for small details or his willingness to chat or
his ability to simplify seemingly complex
subjects like the music business or his JFK
meets-Mr. Cajun drawl, there's something
friendly about Wareham that makes one feel
at ease with him.
BEMflTIHINIi MEIODIES
More importantly, Wareham engenders
this accessible simplicity in Luna's comfort
able music. Compared to the sonic pyrotech
nics of its debut "Lunapark," Luna's latest,
"Bewitched," draws its listener in with sim
pler, relatively unembellished guitar chords
and image-heavy, storytelling vocals. While
it's a result that any Luna fan notices, it's
something Wareham can't explain. As you
might expect, he plays the songwriting
process by ear.
"It is a bit quieter," he agrees. "Part of it is
just accident. You don't plan exactly how a

record sounds. We didn't
anyway. You could, I
guess — you could say,
'We're not going to play
guitar on this record.' It
just kind of accidentally
came out quieter.
"We like it more
though. The guitars are up
a bit louder, even though
they're quiet. The vocals are
down a little and the drums
are down a little. It's a step
backwards, but we like it.

"Things change from the
idea vou have in vour head

about the song to the way it finishes up. You
have to go with that; well, you don't have to
— you can be a perfectionist, a dick about it.
I'm really not that way."
The "new" Luna sound is exemplified in
the album's delightful leadoff track "Cali
fornia," a song that takes such a "step back
wards." The crisp and plump guitar chords,
which start the song off, run throughout the
piece, providing a unifying setting for the
rest of the song to take place. The understat
ed bass boom of Justin Harwood and pre
cise, march-like drumming of Demeski add
to the song's infectious bouncing quality
and summery feel. These spellbinding ele
ments prove to be as important a composi
tional part as the compelling guitar work of
both Wareham and second guitarist Sean
Eden.
However, no Luna mix is complete with
out the attention-grabbing vocals, which
usually tell a warped story using rich im
agery. The lyrics of "California" typify stan
dard Luna vocals, relating the tale of soured

love through gems of wit: "And
though she followed me to California all the
way /1 only want to watch the tele." And
when Wareham croons in the chorus, "Why
has my sympathy now turned to malice?" he
succinctly sums up how the relationship has
taken a turn for the worse. Still, as evocative
as they are, Wareham claims there's nothing
more to Luna lyrics than what's on the sur
face.
"Rock and roll lyrics are allowed to be
kind of dumb. But they shouldn't be embar
rassing. That's what I think.
"I have no message — no message for the
kids. Or if I do, it's not in the songs, anyway.
The only message is it's fun to play the guitar."
■MUSIC MlflMS BUSINESS
While Luna seems to work on the simple
ethic of "music for music's sake," Wareham
still realizes that, in order to continue mak
ing a living as a professional musician, it's
necessary to play the music business game.
His views on the practical end of his art pro
vide another example of just how easy it is to

relate to him: Wareham looks at
things realistically and takes it all
in stride rather than self-con
sciously complaining about being
exploited by his monolithic
record company, Elektra, or arro
gantly celebrating his major label
status.
"It's a lot more pressure
[being on Elektra]. There are lot
more people saying, 'What did we
do wrong last time? What should
we do to improve?' A lot more talk.
"But [Elektra] is capable of
getting the records into the
stores," Wareham explains with a
slight chuckle. "And certainly,
they're more capable of getting
more radio play. If you're on an
indie, you can get play on college
radio, but you can t get played on
the big commercial alternative
stations."
Another way I.una has
brought its music to the ears of the
listening public is through a
breakneck tour schedule. At the
prodding of Elektra, the foursome
has opened for a diverse group of
alternative favorites, from the
Screaming Trees to the Sundays to
the legendary Velvet Under
ground. Although

the performances have helped to bring Luna
attention and a chance to hone their sound,
Wareham looks to the day when his band
headlines, rather than opens, at venues like
the Warfield.
"With our first record, our thinking was
that it was better to go out and open for
someone and wait for the band to build
slightly before doing our own tour. The
record company is always thinking in terms
of potential fans. They want you to go out
and play for potential fans. The bigger the
better," Wareham relates.
"We are doing our own tour after this one
[opening for the Cocteau Twins]. We're look
ing forward to that. Opening for people is
easier, but it's not as emotionally rewarding
as doing your own show."
'IT'S niRICKI'
With two acclaimed LP's and experience
from massive touring, Luna has certainly
held up its part of the bargain. And while
the band hasn't attained the widespread ac
ceptance such efforts deserve, Wareham
isn't jaded. His down-to-earth attitude
shines through as he puts both the pitfalls
and blessings of life on the road into per
spective.
"Touring is hard work, you know. We
enjoy playing live, but 1 don't necessarily
enjoy sitting in a van for 17 hours, driving
from Salt Lake City to Seattle.
"But it's alright. Beats putting on a tie and
going on the subway to a temp job or some
thing," Wareham says with a yawn.
Whether "Bewitched" goes gold or fails to
meet Elektra's expectations or builds on the
foundation Luna's laid, Wareham enjoys a
sense of security from doing his job well.
Whatever happens, he and Luna will contin
ue to make music, cutting albums full of in
teresting and beautiful songs.
"Yeah, there's a pressure for it to do well.
But even if it didn't, they'd probably let us
make another one. It's a big corporation in
terested in shifting huge amounts of units, so
there's a pressure for it to do well. We try and
ignore that pressure as much as possible.
"There's nothing I can do about it except
make a record."

Ifa night of thoughtful and melodic music is what
you crave, catch the ever-touring Luna with the
Cocteau Twins at the WarfieUi on either Friday,

April 1 orSaturilay, April 2.
