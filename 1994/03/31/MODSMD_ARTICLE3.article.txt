# No alcohol at the World Cup?
## Stanford responds to letter requesting sales be banned during the tournament 
### Scott Van Winkle Staff writer 
Soccer fans who descend on Stanford to
watch World Cup matches this summer will
probably be able to drink to their hearts' con
tent, despite suggestions that alcohol sales
should be banned during the event.
World Cup USA President Alan Rothenberg
sent letters last month to governments in each
of the nine cities which will host World Cup
games urging them to consider banning alcohol
sales before matches, as some cities did when
Italy hosted the World Cup in 1990.
But Palo Alto and Stanford officials have re
sponded coolly to the request, arguing that a
local alcohol ban would be ineffective and prob
ably illegal.
"I don't think it's going to make any differ
ence at all," said Stanford public safety officer
Marvin Herrington of a hypothetical alcohol
ban in Palo Alto. Most soccer fans could drink
at other places on the Peninsula, he said.
"The real alcohol question is whether you're
going to sell it at the stadium," he added, point
ing out that Stanford Stadium would remain
alcohol-free during the World Cup matches in
June and July.
Misbehavior has been much less of a prob

lem since fans were banned from bringing alco
hol into the stadium five years ago, he said.
Whether that trend will continue when in
ternational soccer fans, who have acquired a
reputation for rowdiness, come to campus re
mains to be seen.

alcoholic beverages at World
Cup matches — I favor a
responsible alcohol policy.'

"l'm from England, but I'm rather glad that
my country won't be here, just because it
makes more problems for me," said Andy Lam
bert, who manages the Rose and Crown Eng
lish Eood and Ale House in Palo Alto. The Eng
lish national team failed to qualify for the
World Cup's final rounds.
Even without the English, Lambert ac
knowledged that "with the number of people
here, there will be problems" and said he had

hired additional security for the two weeks of
Stanford World Cup matches.
Nevertheless, Lambert said he welcomed
the additional business and called an alcohol
ban "ridiculous," arguing that the decision
should be left to individual bar and restaurant
owners.
Herrington also said he plans to have plenty
of security, more than 600 personnel, on hand
during the event. "1 think we're going to have a
good series of games, but I'm prepared for any
thing to happen," he said.
He also said he is not worried by supposed
international hooligans, arguing that 60 to 70
percent of fans would be from the United
States, where soccer is "a family sport."
Local officials such as Herrington and Palo
Alto mayor Liz Kniss have also questioned the
legality of suspending liquor licenses granted
by the state.
Such questions have prompted Rothenberg
to backpedal slightly. "I don't advocate a ban
on alcoholic beverages at World Cup matches
— I favor a responsible alcohol policy," he said
at a news conference in New York last week.
In any case, the conditions which have
prompted violence and deaths at soccer match-
es in other countries are not like
ly to be replicated here, Herring
ton said. The audience in some
instances consisted of "90-plus
percent males between 19 and 60
years old who have been drink
ing," he said. "That's a prescrip
tion for trouble."
