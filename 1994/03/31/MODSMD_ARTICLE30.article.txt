# The 						Flecktone Experience
## are you experienced 
### Joey Rosenblum 
Redefining the term
power trio, B£la Fleck
and the Flecktones are
on the cutting edge of
experimental music.

Blending
with Celtic folk music
with bebop with cool jazz

and new age and fusion,
the Flecktones break tradi
tion and convention at
every measure. One night
you might hear them jam
their music to far off and
spacey places and on anoth
er you might witness the I

super-slick coolness of one
of tightest jazz trios around.
Everything about them is
non-traditional: what at

first glance might seem like
three men with guitars turns
out to be a sophisticated unit
complete with drummer,
bassist and lead banjo player.

Generally, unless you're deal
ing in bluegrass music, the term
"lead banjo" doesn't really stir

up images of burning instru
ments or monster riffing or
scantily clad women
... A

throwing themselves at
the feet of sweaty,
leather-engulfed males.
However, as lead banjo

for the Flecktones, B£la
Fleck puts many a hot-riff
ing guitar player to shame

with his sweet combination of
modal jazz, blues and bluegrass licks
that can turn up anywhere at anytime.

The Beverly HiUbillie/ in outer /pace

Bluegrass seems almost as unlikely as the banjo to break
a band into the jazz scene; yet the Flecktones have been top
ping the jazz charts since their self-titled debut album in
1990. Says B£la about his combination of influences: "When
I started playing I got into Charlie Parker and Chick Corea
around the same time I was getting into Flatt and Scruggs
and Bill Monroe, the bluegrass pioneers."
At age 15 B£la dropped the guitar and Kumbaya and
picked up the banjo. About getting into bluegrass, Bela says,
"I really liked the banjo but 1 didn't like bluegrass. When I
first started, I remember thinking the singing sounded kind
of like cats being slaughtered, but as I got into the music 1
started to really like the singing too."
But B£la says bluegrass is an acquired taste. "1 can only
compare it to drinking coffee: when you first try it when
you're a kid you think 'this is bitter, I'll never want to drink
this stuff,' but then the more of it you drink you really start

digging the taste — but then some people never like coffee."
Similarly, the Flecktones' style of funky boogie may not
groove with mainstream top-40 tastes — but being main
stream top 40 isn't hip and Bela sure as hip is.
Don't get the wrong impression: the Flecktones aren't
just made up of Bala's banjo boogie. Maintaining the beat
and keeping things mixed up is Roy "Futureman" Wooten,
the world's most proficient and only synthaxe drumitar
player. Shaped like a guitar, his synthaxe is actually a few
thousand synth-patch triggers dispersed over the neck and
body of his instrument. Each patch beats a drum, or triggers
thunder or otherwise adds percussively to the Flecktone ex
perience. Plus, his funky outfits fit his name, adding to the
overall outlandishness of the Flecktone experience.
While slightly more tame on the fashion-crime scene
than his brother Futureman, the rhythm section gets

funked up with Victor Wooten, perhaps the best bass play
er in the world. For his work on the 1993 release of the lat
est Flecktone album, "Three Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,"
he was nominated for Bass Player of the Year by Bass

Player magazine. His fluid technique and
ability to play 128 th notes on a bass

add depth and dimension to
the music unlike any of
his contemporaries.

Bock (o (ho Future

After losing
original Flecktone
key-master Howard
Levy, the band has had

WM to expand and experi
ment to fill the space,
bringing in a banjo-trig
gered synth as well as foot
triggerable sample loops
for Futureman. Still B£la
prefers his 1938 Gibson
special to his 1994 electron
ic, whiz-bang-gizmo-deal
banjo. "We're going two

different ways simultane
ously, we're getting more
progressive with the elec
tronics and then we're
also getting more tradi
tional. Nowadays we

usually end the
* show with an
acoustic set where Vic-

tor goes over to cello and
Futureman picks up acoustic

percussion."
The next Flecktone project is in

j fact an acoustic one. B£la is currently
recording an album featuring a huge variety
of musical guests. Branford Marsalis and

Bruce Hornsby, who appeared on "Three Flew Over the
Cuckoo's Nest," will show up, as well as one of Bala's idols,
Chick Corea. "Playing with Chick was a shock — it was so
cool." Almost as cool as playing with the Grateful Dead at
Oakland Coliseum?
B£la says "being at home" musically is not always the best
philosophy for progress.
"I'm very at home playing bluegrass and acoustic jazz,
but I don't always like being at home. I like being in spaces
where I'm forced to cope with the situation and react to
things I'm not as comfortable with — that brings out more
learning and opportunity for growth, by stretching your
self into places where you're not necessarily as comfort
able."
B£la Fleck and the Flecktones will surely be stretching
ears and space and the very bounds of music itself as they
round up their San Francisco circuit and boogie through
Braun Music Center, Saturday at 7:30 p.m. in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium. ■

banjo. "We're going two

The next Flecktone project is in

j fact an acoustic one. B£la is currently
recording an album featuring a huge variety
of musical guests. Branford Marsalis and

Bruce Hornsby, who appeared on "Three Flew Over the
Cuckoo's Nest," will show up, as well as one of Bala's idols,
Chick Corea. "Playing with Chick was a shock — it was so
cool." Almost as cool as playing with the Grateful Dead at
Oakland Coliseum?
B£la says "being at home" musically is not always the best
philosophy for progress.
"I'm very at home playing bluegrass and acoustic jazz,
but I don't always like being at home. I like being in spaces
where I'm forced to cope with the situation and react to
things I'm not as comfortable with — that brings out more
learning and opportunity for growth, by stretching your
self into places where you're not necessarily as comfort
able."
B£la Fleck and the Flecktones will surely be stretching

Redefining the term
power trio, B£la Fleck
and the Flecktones are
on the cutting edge of
experimental music.

Blending
with Celtic folk music
with bebop with cool jazz

and new age and fusion,
the Flecktones break tradi
tion and convention at
every measure. One night
you might hear them jam
their music to far off and
spacey places and on anoth
er you might witness the I

super-slick coolness of one
of tightest jazz trios around.
Everything about them is
non-traditional: what at

first glance might seem like
three men with guitars turns
out to be a sophisticated unit
complete with drummer,
bassist and lead banjo player.

Generally, unless you're deal
ing in bluegrass music, the term
"lead banjo" doesn't really stir

up images of burning instru
ments or monster riffing or
scantily clad women
... A

throwing themselves at
the feet of sweaty,
leather-engulfed males.
However, as lead banjo

for the Flecktones, B£la
Fleck puts many a hot-riff
ing guitar player to shame

with his sweet combination of
modal jazz, blues and bluegrass licks
that can turn up anywhere at anytime.

The Beverly HiUbillie/ in outer /pace

Bluegrass seems almost as unlikely as the banjo to break
a band into the jazz scene; yet the Flecktones have been top
ping the jazz charts since their self-titled debut album in
1990. Says B£la about his combination of influences: "When
I started playing I got into Charlie Parker and Chick Corea
around the same time I was getting into Flatt and Scruggs
and Bill Monroe, the bluegrass pioneers."
At age 15 B£la dropped the guitar and Kumbaya and
picked up the banjo. About getting into bluegrass, Bela says,
"I really liked the banjo but 1 didn't like bluegrass. When I
first started, I remember thinking the singing sounded kind
of like cats being slaughtered, but as I got into the music 1
started to really like the singing too."
But B£la says bluegrass is an acquired taste. "1 can only
compare it to drinking coffee: when you first try it when
you're a kid you think 'this is bitter, I'll never want to drink
this stuff,' but then the more of it you drink you really start

digging the taste — but then some people never like coffee."
Similarly, the Flecktones' style of funky boogie may not
groove with mainstream top-40 tastes — but being main
stream top 40 isn't hip and Bela sure as hip is.
Don't get the wrong impression: the Flecktones aren't
just made up of Bala's banjo boogie. Maintaining the beat
and keeping things mixed up is Roy "Futureman" Wooten,
the world's most proficient and only synthaxe drumitar
player. Shaped like a guitar, his synthaxe is actually a few
thousand synth-patch triggers dispersed over the neck and
body of his instrument. Each patch beats a drum, or triggers
thunder or otherwise adds percussively to the Flecktone ex
perience. Plus, his funky outfits fit his name, adding to the
overall outlandishness of the Flecktone experience.
While slightly more tame on the fashion-crime scene
than his brother Futureman, the rhythm section gets

funked up with Victor Wooten, perhaps the best bass play
er in the world. For his work on the 1993 release of the lat
est Flecktone album, "Three Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,"
he was nominated for Bass Player of the Year by Bass

Player magazine. His fluid technique and
ability to play 128 th notes on a bass

add depth and dimension to
the music unlike any of
his contemporaries.
