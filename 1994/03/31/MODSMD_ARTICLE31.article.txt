It's the voice, you see.
A voice that sends me careening back to
those half-forgotten, pre-grunge days of
Ralph Mouth and Potsy Webber and Joanie
and"The Fonz." A high nasal voice with a
"heh-heh-heh-HEH" chortle that sprouts
images of a carefully scrubbed, rosy-cheeked
ail-American, clad in overalls, with fishing
pole slung over shoulder and a mop of car
rot-colored hair. It's a voice that says, "Come
on, the water's fine!" or intones, "The Boy
Scout is honest, loyal, brave kind ..." etc.
The skin has thickened a bit, and startling
wrinkles erupt around the eyes with every
smile, but Ron Howard still seems the eager
beaver, "aw-shucks" 20-year-old, despite a
directing career that has spanned more than
a decade and bulldozed millions of dollars
into studio coffers.
Nevertheless, when the photographer
asks the dreaded "Happy Days" question —
dares to ask, "So what happened to Richie
Cunningham?" — my guts crawl. I expect a
glare, a change in position, at least a momen
tary pause. But Howard simply removes his
baseball cap (emblazoned with "The
Paper"), leans forward and with a toothy grin
says, "This is what happened to Richie Cun
ningham."
And there, between two stubborn clumps
of carrot-red hair that cling to the temples
like shrubbery, lies an expanse of naked pate.
Richie Cunningham — bald and 40.
Yet he lives.
A frenetic drama this time out
"Splash," "Parenthood," "Willow" and
"Backdraft" established Howard as a director
to be trusted with the astronomical Holly
wood budgets that characterized the films of
the '80s. And his latest project, "The Paper,"
which opened locally last Friday, is no excep
tion. Armed with a cast boasting the likes of
Glenn Close, Michael Keaton, Robert Duvall,
Marisa Tomei and Jason Robards, it's a film

that extracts the tension and frenetic pace of
a New York tabloid newspaper, while leaving,
in typical Howard-esque fashion, any bitter
or unpleasant flavors out.
Keaton plays an overworked managing
editor at a Manhattan tabloid who must deal
with the demands of a very pregnant wife, a
copy deadline, an offer to work at the rival
New York Sentinel for a higher salary, and a
major ethical dilemma that might, depend
ing on his editorial snuff, doom two inno
cents for a crime they didn't commit. And of
course, the other players have their own
problems — prostate cancer, journalistic
ethics, fractured family relations and venge
ful city bureaucrats.
The movie's frantic pace cuts from poten
tial disaster to crisis to near catastrophe to
stratospheric levels of stress and anxiety
among the journalistic profession with little
time to rest, and it represents a change in
style, if not tone, for Howard.
"It's definitely got more of an edge," he
says, comparing "The Paper" to his previous
films, whose subjects have included Irish im
migrants, swashbuckling knights and fire
men. "And more sophisticated, in my opin
ion, in terms of storytelling style than any
thing else I've done. I'm always trying to push
things and to me it depends on how I relate to
the material and what I think the demands of
the material are. "
In addition to hiring technical consultants
such as actual newspaper reporters, Howard
did his own research for the film by spending
time at the Daily News and the New York
Post, writing down the lingo and behavioral
nuances of a newspaper office.
"I was collecting some details and always
thinking about ways of developing the char
acters a little further," he says. "To drink in
the overall flavor of the stuff I was seeing, we
would do a series of running bits, like little
non sequiturs, so every time one of our char
acters had to cross from point a to point b, we
would stick in two or three phrases or visual

details, just to continue immersing the audi
ence in the movie."
Fooling with the camera crew
Virtually born into the Hollywood studio
system — starting off with a role at age 4 in
1958 with a youthful Jason Robards in a
movie about the Hungarian revolution —
Howard got to know some of the people be
hind the camera at an early age.
"As a kid on the set I liked hanging around
with the camera crew," he says. "They showed
me the camera and the lenses and I liked all
that. At the same time, the actors were a riot.
I loved being around them and being a part of
that whole process of figuring out how to tell
the story, how to do the scenes."
Soon, however, Howard realized the
power of the director's seat. "It didn't take me
long to realize that the director was the per
son who got to hang out and play with every
body," he says. "By the time I was 8 or 9, when
people asked me what I wanted to do when I
grew up, I would say I wanted to be an actor,
producer, writer, director, cameraman and
baseball player."
Howard's father was a stage director,
which also spurred his interest. "I remember
watching my dad direct plays," he says."He
never did film, but a lot of local theater in Los
Angeles. So I think I was impressed by that."
As a teen "desperate to do film," Howard
began making home movies with his Super 8
camera, later graduating to 16 mm film and
producing films over a weekend. Finally, dur
ing his tenure at "Happy Days" as the fresh
faced Richie Cunningham, Howard tried to
produce a feature film over several weekends.
"I never completed that film because a
year later I got a chance to direct 'Grand Theft
Auto' for Roger Gorman," he says, referring
to the king of such B-grade horror flicks as
"The Blob." "Finally, I had somebody else to
rent the equipment. I didn't make much
money, but I didn't have to buy the film, and

after that opportunities started coming in."
That first effort convinced Howard that he
had discovered his calling. "It was very in
tense," he says. "Our last day of filming, we
did like 88 set-ups. Normally, on paper we
were averaging 20 set-ups, which is still pret
ty quick. But when it was over, I remember
thinking that I'd talked all my life — 1 was 23
at the time, but what life I'd had anyway —
I'd dreamed of doing this job, and it in fact
exceeded my expectations. I just enjoyed it so
much, from that point on I was really a direc
tor."
Comfortable with big studio flicks
Howard's penchant for expensive, high
key hit-makers might make film literati hold
their noses, but he doesn't mind. "I think
people know I like to work in that style, so I
get a lot of those scripts," he says."And I real
ly like it, but I don't seek it out."
Making blockbusters is not his primary
goal, says Howard. "If I just wanted to make
as much money as I possibly could, there
would have already been a 'Parenthood 2'
and a 'Backdraft 2,' " he asserts. "And they
would have been very lucrative. And instead
of doing 'The Paper' — which is tough to
market — I probably would have done a
good PG-family comedy."
An ardent fan of Frank Capra and John
Ford and other icons of classic American cin
ema, Howard is sensitive to the presence of
other styles, like those of Altman, Scorsese
and Coppola. "The late '60s and early '70s
were a great period," he says, discussing his
self-imposed education. "I studied 'The
Graduate.' That's a movie I must have seen 25
or 30 times. Much different sensibility and
cinematic style than anything Capra or Ford
was doing."
But Howard admits to being a populist.
"To me that's what a film really offers: a
chance to really disappear inside a story for a
couple hours," he says. "I'm a good fan, a

good moviegoer. I'm an easy audience. If it's
effective enough to pull me into the screen,
then I'm there."
Nevertheless, Howard also knows that
family comedies and special effects escapades
are rarely showered with the honors of indus
try. Spielberg's protracted quest for an Acad
emy Award and the recognition it provides
no doubt haunts him.
"I think that's very possible," he says,
speaking of the parallels between his and
Spielberg's career. "Yet I've also decided that I
can really outsmart myself if I try to intellec
tually deal with that. Instead, the best way, I
think, is to just work through and be pure
about the choices I make."
Howard doesn't expect abrupt changes in
his outlook. "I'm always trying to ride this
line," he says. "I'm trying to find movies that
feel fresh, that are artistically interesting to
me and that I think will be a fresh movie ex
perience for the audience and still be accessi
ble — and work for a mainstream audience,
because I am a mainstream director and I'm
working with budgets that demand that a
large audience go and see the picture."
But a distant future might witness a differ
ent sensibility. Howard cites Altman, who, to
pursue his own creative interests, has pur
posely "turned his back on Hollywood," yet
continually draws star talent even with mi
nuscule budgets.
"I could imagine myself taking that turn at
some point," says Howard. "But it wouldn't
really be a turn, it would be an evolution.
Right now I'm enjoying this phase of my ca
reer."
And the studios have been good to him. "I
guess because I'm conscientious, reliable and
I haven't lost them any money yet, I continue
to find the experience positive and I get to
pursue the movies I'm interested in."
As for his critics, who loudly lashed him
for "Far and Away," which starred Tom
Cruise and Nicole Kidman, Howard shrugs
them off, and feels it's to be expected as his

career stretches on. "The last film received
more criticism probably than all the other
movies put together," he says."And I was
blindsided by that, because it was a real audi
ence picture. It was the first time the critical
community responded differently from the
audience response.
"I think it's inevitable that as you establish
yourself, the critical community is going to
probably challenge the movie a bit more," he
says."I see it with other directors, so it
doesn't really surprise me too much." And
then with a laugh he says, "Maybe at some
point I'll be sort of venerable."
For his next project, Howard intends to
adapt a book by Jim Lovell about the Apollo
13 mission, with Tom Hanks committed to
the lead.
"It's going to be quite different from any
thing else I've ever directed," he says."I don't
know where that's going to lead me cinemat
ically. Certainly someplace different from
where I went with 'Far and Away' or 'Parent
hood' or 'The Paper.'"
And Howard enjoys the challenge of un
certainty. "I hope that I keep improving, that
I continue experimenting and broadening
the range of the kinds of movies that I can
take on and do," he says. "At some point in my
career I may settle in and say, 'Gee, what I re
ally am best at is this."'
But until he settles on a personal style,
Howard hopes that his critics will be able to
someday look back on a versatile career that
spanned different styles and genres — fanta
sy, action, drama and comedy — and be im
pressed.
"We'll see what the next decade looks like,"
he says with breezy optimism and a toothy
grin. Though he'll never rid himself of his
Richie Cunningham persona, Howard's en
thusiasm for popular cinema, as mercilessly
sweet as it sometimes can be, seems canny
enough to sustain his career for years to
come. ■
