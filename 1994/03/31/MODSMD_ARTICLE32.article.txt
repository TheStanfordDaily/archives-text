# Start the presses!
## The 						Paper' delivers entertaining, fast-paced realism 
### 
Ron Howard almost did the impossible. He
nearly made a movie about a newspaper with
out resorting to the cheesiest line of all time.
"Stop the presses!"
That faux pas aside, "The Paper" is, as they
say in newspapers, page one material. Fast
paced, star-studded and chock full o' quality
one-liners, "The Paper" just about lives up to
the tabloid-like hype that preceded its release.
Michael Keaton puts in a frenetic and be
lievable performance of a day in the life of
Henry Hackett, the Coke-swilling city editor of
the scrappy tabloid the New York Sun.
On the day we meet up with Henry, he's
dealing with the aftermath ofbeing scooped on
a huge, racially charged murder story. His very
pregnant wife Marty (Marisa Tomei), is on
leave from the paper, but isn't dealing well with
being out of the newsroom and keeps calling
him. To top it off, he's landed an interview with
the haughty New York Sentinel (a thinly veiled
New York Times), but doesn't know whether
he should go for the big bucks or stick with the
job he loves at The Sun.
True-to-life newsroom politics begin sim
mering early in the film, as chain-smoking edi
tor Bernie White (Robert Duvall) has to keep
Henry from coming to blows with penny
pinching managing editor Alicia White (Glenn
Close).
Meanwhile, gritty columnist Dan McDou
gal (Randy Quaid) is camped out on Henry's
office couch. He's packing heat in his waist
band now that his exposes on the city parking
commissioner's selective enforcement of park
ing regulations have riled up most of New York
City's drivers.
Most of the film is consumed with the fol
low-up to the murder the night before. Henry's
convinced that the two black kids implicated in
the killing are innocent and is busting his butt
trying to prove it; Alicia couldn't care less if the

kids are convicted in "the wood" (the tabloid's
banner headline) — she's more concerned
with the how much money the paper is losing
every minute they are late on deadline. As in
real life, the pace of the film naturally and
steadily crescendos as deadline approaches.
While that storyline is enough to keep the
movie racing along, numerous little true-to
life sideplots — like the annoying reporter who
keeps badgering Henry for permission to buy
an orthopedic chair — lend authenticity to
The Sun's newsroom and really give viewers an
idea of the crazy world of daily journalism.
Bobo Lewis is delightful as Henry's deadpan
secretary, and Spalding Gray is the perfect
anal-retentive, high brow editor at the rival
Sentinel.
Duvall, Keaton, Tomei, Close and Quaid
have great chemistry as the main characters. If
any of them is a weak link, it's Quaid, who
comes off as a little too wacko to be believable
near the end of the movie, lason Alexander
(who's had a lot of experience with the pathet
ic "George" character of "Seinfeld" fame) turns
up as the parking commissioner at the very end
of the movie, and he almost inspires pity.
The people behind "The Paper" obviously
conducted a careful study of newsrooms and
journalists before embarking on the project.
David Koepp collaborated on the original
screenplay with his brother Stephen, a senior
editor at Time magazine, and Howard spent
days talking with people at the New York Post
and the Daily News.
The work shows in the details of the set —
from the mounds of paper on reporters' desks
to the inky, thunderous press room with pot
bellied pressmen to the mishmash of dinosaur
computers and Macintoshes — The Sun could
be almost any newspaper in the country.
While those who have never worked at a
newspaper may find "The Paper" melodramat

ic or overacted, anyone who has spent time in a
newsroom knows that the theatrics at The Sun
are true to life. And though the pace of a real
world newspaper is not always as frenzied as the
day at The Sun, it certainly is on some days.
Don't be fooled; "The Paper" can hardly be
called the epitome of newspaper flicks. But its

humor is a welcome addition to the cadre of
"serious" journalism films like "All the Presi
dent's Men" and "Citizen Kane."
True to life, not all the loose ends are tied up
at the conclusion of "The Paper." But that's
what tomorrow's edition is for.
