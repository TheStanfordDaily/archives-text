Angie
In the opening scene of Martha Coolidge's
"Angie," two young Italian girls encourage
their breasts to develop by urgently whisper
ing "grow ... grow." From that point the
focus shifts to the grown-up Angie and the
heartwarming story of her self-discovery
through trials such as an unexpected preg
nancy, a fleeting affair, the search for her real
mother and the birth of her child.
Yes, the story line does scream "chic flick!"
But what could have been a phenomenally

annoying tear jerker
is actually a pretty
good movie thanks
to an excellent per
formance by Geena
Davis as Angie.
Davis is superb as
the blunt, beautiful,
foul-mouthed
Angie Scacciapen
sieri. She pulls off
the prototypical
New York Italian
gum-chomper with
precision. Not only
is she funny at her

most obnoxious moments, but realistic dur
ing emotional scenes. Teaming with Davis is
her best friend Tina (Aida Turturro) and her
long time plumber boyfriend Vinnie who
gets her pregnant (James Gandolfini).
Watching the three of them interact is a little
painful as their characters are almost too
stereotypical.
Thus, the scenes between Angie and Noel,
an Irish artsy lawyer played by Stephen Rea,
provide a refreshing break as the two interact
more genuinely. While pregnant with Vin
nie's child, the two begin an affair after meet
ing at an art museum. Angie "charms" Noel
when she is accosted by the museum guards
for chomping on Saltines in an attempt to
ward off a bout of morning sickness.
Other classic scenes include Vinnie's piti
ful attempt to create his own commercial,
Angie's step mother's Cheese Whiz Pizzas and
the birth of Angie's child. Davis is hilarious
with her bouts of inappropriate expletives
while in labor. But fellow females, beware —
this scene will do nothing to pacify any anxi
eties you might have about giving birth.
And for all you males out there, you may
very well be turned off by "Angie"— unless, of
course, you're feeling like a "sensitive guy." Ei
ther way, Davis' portrayal is enough to carry
the movie regardless of the story content.

Sirens
It's hard to resist the lure of "Sirens," a sur
real, witty, erotic and totally original riff on
the life of controversial Australian painter
Norman Lindsay.
Fresh off the boat from England, Rev. An
thony Campion (Hugh Grant) is an "out
sider" in Australia, and a "progressive" one at
that. His first assignment is to persuade Lind
say (Sam Neill) to withdraw his blasphemous,
quasi-pornographic painting, "The Crucified
Venus," from an important exhibition.
Armed to the teeth with liberal good inten
tions, Campion and his porcelain-skinned
wife, Estella (Tara Fitzgerald), journey to
Lindsay's estate in the Blue Mountains, an
Edenic commune crawling with snakes, chil
dren and perpetually nude models.
And it's not the minister these temptresses
are after — it's his wife. While Campion de
bates the "damaging" nature of Lindsay's
painted nudes, their fleshly counterparts pre
side over Estella's sexual awakening.
Like Lindsay's masterpieces, "Sirens" is
painted with broad strokes and visceral col
ors. Writer/director John Duigan combines
the best elements of his "Flirting" and "Wide
Sargasso Sea" to produce a lush meditation —
an "art" film in every sense of the word.

Grant and Fitzgerald are a perfect pair of
prim do-gooders, reluctantly transformed by
the film's pervasive sensuality. One of the
many joys of "Sirens" is watching Grant
squirm.
As head model Sheela, Amazonian model
turned-actress File MacPherson is like a preco
cious child or raccoon — cute but maddening.
Neill is practically invisible, with only a mis
chievous glint of the evil genius in his eye.
Throughout the film, the Campions are as
saulted by newspapers whose lurid headlines
scream of shipwrecks and shark attacks. "This
whole country is dangerous," Estella says,
with a delicious mixture of horror and fasci
nation. By the end of "Sirens," we suspect that
she wouldn't have it any other way.
