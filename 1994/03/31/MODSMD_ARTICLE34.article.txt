# A 						hit centuries in the making
## 'Chant' brings monastic music to the masses 
### 
Prepare your soul — and your ears —
for the music worlds newest all-male a cap
pella sensations: the Benedictine Monks of
Santo Domingo de Silos.
You won't find "Brown Eyed Girl" or
Duran Duran medleys on this Spanish
choir's recent U.S. debut — released, appro
priately, by Angel Records. The album, aus
terely titled "Chant," is a collection of 19 Gre
gorian chants, including such medieval stan
dards as "Spiritus Domine," "Veni sancte
spiritus" and "Kyrie XI."
Gregorian chant, or plainsong, is the
monophonic, liturgical music used to ac
company the text of the Roman Catholic
Mass. Named after Pope Gregory I (590-
604), under whose reign the music was first
collected, Gregorian melody is said to be
born of the fear of God. Hushed and chro
matically uncomplicated, it is the sound of
celibacy and contemplation.
Anyone who's ventured into Tower's clas
sical music bunker lately knows that "Chant"
isn't the only Gregorian chant album on the
market, and it's far from the best. Recorded
in the monks' own 1 lth-century monastery,
which they seldom leave, "Chant" sounds
like it was recorded in ... an 11th-century
monastery. With a rusty Walkman.
But "Chant" may well be the bcsl-market
ed recording of its kind in history, complete
with Magritte-inspired cover art (are the
monks floating up or down?) and the catchy
slogan, "Prepare for the Millennium." Sweat
shirts (hooded, of course) and a music video
are in the works. Directed primarily at the
MTV generation, "Chant" brings new mean
ing to the term "alternative."
"Chant" will no doubt remind some lis
teners of Enigma's top-10 single, "Sadeness,

Part I," which com
bines Gregorian
chant with pulsating
synthesizers. The re
sult was an ambient
fantasia that made
the heart throb and
the mind tingle.
Indeed, "Chant"
achieves the same
echoing, otherworldly
effect as Enigma, Enya
or the soundtrack to
"The Mission," but
without the funky
backbeat. You can't
dance to it, and, unless
you've been keeping
up with your high
school I .atin, you can't
sing along, either.
So why is it that a
two-CD version of
"Chant" is currently
Spain's top pop
album, a bestseller
throughout Europe
and number one on
stateside classical
charts? According to a
press release, it's be
cause Gregorian

chant "rises from the distance of history and
still bathes the weary, distracted, worldly soul
in its blessing."
In other words, these 1,300-year-old ec
clesiastical tunes transcend time, space, lan
guage barriers, demographies and religious
denominations to send shivers through
angst-ridden psyches. Whether you file

"Chant" under New Age or Middle Ages, its
appeal is eternal.
If the album seems a bit rough in spots, at
least it's not a slick, impersonal studio mix.
And, while its trance-like rhythms may put
you to sleep, "Chant" practically guarantees
lucid dreams.
Though their album is in the upper

spheres of Billboard heaven, the 36 brothers
of Santo Domingo de Silos have their feet
firmly planted on the ground — so far
they've shunned interviewers, and 90 percent
of the profits from "Chant" go to charity.
That's just one more reason to take a dip in
the cleansing cadences of "Chant."

Although "Chant" doesn't feature the finest Gregorian chants around, it does get the word out with its impec
cable marketing. Just one example: these musical monks have their record at the top of the pop charts in their
homeland Spain.
