"Panic On"
Madder Rose
On the first listen, it's tempting to dismiss
Madder Rose as another band taking advan
tage of today's "women in rock" movement.
While that may be the slant Atlantic
Records sought to exploit when it added the
New York quartet to its ever-growing alter
native lineup, such a simple characterization
docs a great injustice to the pretty music on
Madder Rose's latest release "Panic On."
From the most obvious facts (three of the
band's four members are male, including its
main songwriter) to the most subtle aspects

of the bands sound,
Madder Rose evades
an easy pigeonholing
while carving out
acomfortable niche.
What gets Madder
Rose mentioned in
the same breath as
"girly pop" great Ju
liana Hatfield is vo
calist/guitarist Mary
Lorson's wonderful
voice. Sure, her vocals
evoke images of 1 lat-

field's in all its melodious splendor; however,
Lorson's raw-edged cooing may be smoother
than her cutesy-voiced predecessor.
The eclectic electric guitar work, with its
combination straightforward rock-and-roll
guitar hooks with a pinch of blues-tinged
twang and an occasional spacey guitar effect,
sets the band apart from many a guitar rock
band. It serves as the perfect backdrop for
Lorson's evocative voice, both mellow and
fierce. The mix of Lorson's hypnotic voice
with the mid-tempo instrumental accompa
niment creates music that's perfect to listen
to when you're doing nothing but staring.
Take the title track as a prime example.
For the best reasons, everything seems a beat
slow. Lorson calmly calls over the soothing
din of guitar whipped up by lead guitarist
and main songwriter Billy Cot£. After brief
snatches of intense guitar work, bassist Matt
Verta-Ray slows the song down, drawing out
a crisp bass thump to a lazy groove. The song
gets slower, passing up noisy asides to fade
away peacefully.
While some of the songs begin to sound
the same and resemble one another more
than a little in composition, one's willing to
forgive such flaws. After all, with such a well
conceived formula as Madder Rose's, it's
tough not to use it.

"The John Peel/Sub-
Pop Peel Sessions"
various artists
"The John Peel/Sub-Fop Feel Sessions"
compilation documents the success of the
world's best known independent label.
The album celebrates the Sub-Pop expe
rience by showcasing the grunge, which first
thrust the record company to the forefront
of the music world. In addition, it presents
some innovative new acts which now make
up the label's sound. With 12 tracks record
ed from John Peel's legendary BBC Radio
One program by six bands, there's some
thing to please even the most fickle college
rock fan.
The first half shows off the grunge rock
born and bred in Sub-Pop's Seattle backyard
to mixed results. Old standby Mudhoney
gets the show started with a bang, bringing a
knowing smirk and a crunch of guitar for all
to hear. After these college music chart-top
pers, the collection loses some steam with
the questionable selections of boringly
heavy Tad and boringly repetitive Seaweed.
From these ashes rises Pond, a smart, like
ably strange trio. The band puts a twist on

the old grunge formula, putting together
catchy guitar hooks with oddball pop lyrics.
The track "Cinders" proves to be the center
piece of the album; its slightly out-of-tune
guitar work and the whiny, indistinguishible
vocals about the joys of sleeping emanates an
aura of slacker cool.
With super-melodic Velocity Girl follow
ing Pond, the break with grunge is com
plete. The haunting "Here Comes" gives
opera-trained vocalist Sarah Shannon an
opportunity to show off her jewel of a voice.
The classic pop song "Crazy Town" rings in
your head for a while, with its tuneful gui
tars and an oh-so-catchy chorus. The com
pilation gives a nice taste of this charming
five-piece.
Codeine caps off the album perfectly with
its bittersweet pop ballad "Broken-Hearted
Wine." It's easily the most affecting song of
the dozen, grabbing your attention with its
sorrow-dripping lyrics and unadorned
acoustic guitar accompaniment.
Minus those few grunge stinkers, "The
John Peel/Sub-Pop Peel Sessions" serves up a
smorgasbord of some of college rock's choic
est cuts. Moreover, the tasty samples of
Pond, Velocity Girl and Codeine prove that
Sub-Pop offers a lot more than flannel and
teen angst.
