## And grubbing at La Costeña 
### Joey Rosenblum 
The 11 a.m. class is out, you're
dying for something tasty and for
some reason the Lucie Stern dining
experience just doesn't sound like
the normal treat it is. You want food
— no, you want grub, and Jack in
the Crack's latest sourdough some
thing on a sesame bun isn't making
your taste buds water like it used to.
Don't despair, there is a cure.
Deep in the heart of Mountain
View, there's an undercover burrito
bar disguised as a mini-mart.
You've probably passed by that little
Mexican market on the corner at
Old Middlefield and Rengstorff and
not thought twice. It seems so inno
cent. But venture within, make your
way past the aisles of Doritos and
Twinkies and you'll be treated to a
meal and a deal that'll have you run

ning back again and again.
It's all in one: La Costena Merca
do y Taqueria serves up burritos,
makes you coffee, rents you videos
and sells you groceries all at reason
able prices. But the real secret is of
course the burrito bar itself.
There's a variety of Mexican fast
food favorites: burritos, tacos, que
sadillas, etc. But you could always
hit the 24-hour Taco Bell if you just
wanted standard fare: what's excep
tional here is the potential for cus
tomization — it's a 30-foot bar of
burrito fixings for your point-and
choose pleasure.
The basic burrito is compiled of
a huge steamed flour tortilla with a
choice of three kinds of rice, four
kinds of beans and six or seven
styles of meats. Add cheese and wow

— all of the four basic food groups!
Two of the bean varieties are lard
free and the vegetarian mode burri
to is an equally attractive alternative
(and a buck cheaper, too).
The meats are split into chicken
(polio) in a variety of sauces, beef
(came) in a variety of sauces, tongue
(lengua — stay away from this one,
I've seen cow tongue in the raw),
and pork. I really dig the polio mole,
which is chicken in an unsweetened
chocolate spice sauce. Also the came
ranchero, beef in a red sauce with
bell peppers and onions, is extreme
ly tasty and makes a great burrito
building block-
Past the meat layer you pay a
quarter for each extra: any of three
kinds of grated cheese, onions, pep
pers, pickled somethings and the

extremely tasty fresh
guacamole. The
process is finished
with two free scoops
of any of nine or so
fresh salsas. Taste
buds watering yet?
So here's the best
part: every day there's
a rotating burrito
lunch special: $2.99
for a gargantuan bur
rito and a soda. You
can't go wrong! It's al
most as cheap as the

Bell and many thousands of times
healthier and fresher, and you can
rest easier knowing that you're not
supporting monopolistic marke
teers. You take home what you can't
finish and eat it for that afternoon

The moral is: five bucks gets you
a customized La Costena special
burrito and a drink. It's a better, big
ger burrito, and it's way more cool
than McDonalds, so bon appetit! ■
