8 Seconds
Sure, a rodeo movie starring Luke
Perry won't be garnering any Oscar
nominations. But for what it is, "8
Seconds" is a charming flick with
broad-based appeal. Throw in
some excellent live-action rodeo se
quences and a few corny yet heart
ening cowboy aphorisms and
you've got a movie that may be
worth the ticket price. PG-13
Ace Ventura, Pet Detective
As the star of a movie featuring a
predictable plot and bad acting,
comic Jim Carrey carries the burden
of turning "Ace Ventura" from anoth
er piece of trash into something
worth the price of a matinee ticket.
Although his wacky pet detective
character wears thin at points, Car
rey succeeds in achieving very,
very, very modest goals. PG-13
Blue Chips
You don't need to be a big-time bas
ketball fan to enjoy "Blue Chips."
Nick Nolte does a good job playing
the prototypic crazed basketball
coach caught between ethics and
winning. The athletes chosen to play
parts do a good job playing them-

selves. Of note is Shaquille O'Neal's
acting debut; the multi-media mon
ster plays a sarcastic and clueless
character well. PG-13
Fiorile
This Italian import has almost all
those qualities which make foreign
films fun going for it: famous direc
tors, beautiful cinematography, cute
actors and the exploitation of a pretty
foreign language. All that's missing
is a deep story: the plot chronicling
an age-old family curse remains un
developed throughout. So unless
you're a big foreign movie buff or just
an extremely chic individual, wait for
it to hit the video stores. PG-13
Greedy
About the only people who'd get a
kick out of this "comedy" would be the
tasteless few who enjoyed the ob
scure early '80s sitcom "Filthy Rich."
Everything about the movie is bad: the
acting, the directing, the writing, even
the makeup. After all, how good can
any movie be when it features Michael
J. Fox as a pro bowler? PG-13
Guarding Tess
Somehow, this boring, boring movie

reached the top of the box office
charts a couple weeks back. But re
member, the movie-going public
who flocked to see this flick about
an obnoxious former first lady
(Shirley MacLaine) and her dissatis
fied bodyguard (Nicholas Cage) is
probably the same group that put
"Ace Ventura" at number one for
multiple weeks. Don't follow like the
other sheep: take a nap in your
room instead of the theater and save
some cash. PG-13
Reality Bites
So what if "Reality Bites" is another
movie about twenty-somethings
struggling in the post-college world?
Although no shining rays of wisdom
are revealed in the movie, "Reality
Bites" is a fun movie with a refresh
ing sense of humor. It's immediate
enough for us college students to
forgive its minor flaws. PG-13
Savage Nights
An autobiographic film about love
and AIDS, "Savage Nights" packs
emotional punch few movies on the
topic can. To add to the realism, writer
Cyril Collard not only directs the ac
tion, but also stars in this highly-ac-

claimed French import. Yet despite
the riveting performances, the lack of
a cohesive plot makes the two-hour
work difficult to follow. Unrated
Schindler's List
The dark, haunting images of
Steven Spielberg's "Schindler's
List" overcome the film's characters,
leaving moments more important
than people. The story of German
entepreneur Oskar Schindler and
the more than 1,100 Jews he saves
leads to an examination of the many
faces of evil in the Nazi regime. With
indelible pictures of death and
degradation burned in black-and
white film, "Schindler's List" cap
tures the truth of the more than six
million murders carried out just a
half century ago. R
What's Eating Gilbert Grape?
"Gilbert Grape" isn't another trite,
"coming-of-age" flick. It's a fresh
portrayal of how reclusive Gilbert
(Johnny Depp) emerges from the
burdens of family life to find love.
The performances are good Leonar
do DiCaprio, who plays Gilbert's
mentally retarded brother, received
an Oscar nomination. PG-13
