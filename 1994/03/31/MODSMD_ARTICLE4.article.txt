Neurosurgery Prof Frances Con
ley criticized some ot her male col
leagues at the Stanford £ chool of Med
icine for their lack ol respect for
women and minorities ii a speech at
Memorial Church yesterday.
"Many male doctors are graduates
of an educational system that has not
taught them that women and minori
ties have talent and capability to share
in their professional world," she said.
Conley was the first speaker in a se
ries of four speeches which will be held
this quarter titled "Soul to Soul." The
Black Graduate Student Association
scheduled the series in cooperation
with several other graduate student
organizations
Educational institutions must pro
vide an environment in which all indi
viduals have the opportunity to maxi
mize their potential, Conley said,
adding that the Medical School must
improve in this area.
"I truly do not want the environ
ment at the Medical School to be a sex
ist, racist environment," she said. "I
think we need to choose our leadership
extremely carefully."
As for her male counterparts, Con
ley said they do not take women and
minorities seriously. "They have also
not been taught that exclusion of
women and minorities deprives the

medical world and its pursuers of a
richness that comes from shared expe
riences," she said.
Conley argued that some male doc
tors who have not had to deal with any
form of bigotry or prejudice do not un
derstand the challenges women and
minorities face. "Many of my male col
leagues in neurosurgery have had
their specialness emphasized for so
long that for them it is becoming a
title," she said.
Conley first gained attention in
1991 when she resigned her post after
accusing the man who had been
named chair of her department, Dr.
Gerald Silverberg, of sexism. Conley
returned to the Medical School after
Silverberg was removed as chair, and
she has since been vocal on gender is
sues.
She cited several examples of
racism and sexism, including her expe
rience with people who call asking for
"Dr. Conley" and refusing to believe
she is a doctor when she answers.
This form of stereotyping doctors
as males and nurses as females is per
petuated by the fact that hospitals
label their dressing rooms as "doc
tor's dressing room" and "nurse's
dressing room." As a female doctor,
Conley said, "Where do I change my
clothes?"
Conley explained that stereotyping
of males, females and minorities be

gins at an early age. "Girls win acco
lades for being pretty, quiet, coopera
tive and nice," she said. "Caucasian
hoys win approval for intelligence,
feistiness and athletic ability."
Male Latinos and blacks "are not
expected to be smart," Conley said.
"Mostly, as they get bigger, stronger
and smarter, they are feared."

Conley said educational institu
tions need to pay more attention to di
versity, especially in the medical
fields. She explained that individuals
often feel more comfortable getting
medical attention from a doctor of
their gender, race or sexual orienta
tion. "If I were gay I would want to go
to a gay doctor," she said.
