# Debate to begin on conflict policy
## New draft may guide faculty on outside research, patent rights 
### Sarah Katz Colleen Krueger Staff writers 
Capping more than two years
of meetings and drafts, the Facul
ty Senate will debate a conflict of
interest policy today which would
set guidelines for external faculty
research, consulting and invest
ments.
If accepted by the University,
the Faculty Policy on Conflict of
Commitment and Interest will —
among other things — require
faculty members to maintain a
significant presence on campus,
disclose their outside work and fi
nancial interests, and give owner
ship of all inventions created with
University resources to the Uni
versity.
"To protect faculty from accu
sations coming from the outside
. . . individuals have to feel
they've sacrificed a little for the

good of the whole," said Biology

Prof. Craig
Heller, chair of
the senate Com
mittee on Re
search, which de
signed the policy.
But the policy
is expected to
cause consider
able contention
at today's meet-

ing.
"Everybody always assumes
the worst about new policies,"
Heller said. "It's inevitable that we
should be expected to justify it."
After spending the next two
meetings discussing the final
draft, the senate will vote on
whether it should recommend
that the University adopt the pol
icy.
The document covers both con

flicts of interest — which occur
when a faculty member's work at
the University could be influ
enced by outside financial connec
tions — and conflicts of commit
ment, situations in which faculty
involvement in an external activi
ty has an adverse effect on their
Stanford responsibilities.
Although the University has
addressed some of these issues in
the past, it has never had a com
prehensive policy. The draft lays
out 11 provisions that faculty
members must follow in deter
mining whether their actions are
aboveboard.
A changing world
While the University has had
some form of policy to deal with
conflict of interest problems since
1966, it has never had a specific
document to address conflict of
commitment situations.
"The policy comes to grips with
issues that weren't issues in the
19605," said Chemistry Prof.
Steven Boxer, a member of the
committee. "Historically, faculty
did a great deal of consulting but
major participation in companies
is a relatively recent phe
nomenon. This is a change in the
business world, not in the Univer
sity."
Specifically, the policy states
that "faculty must maintain a sig
nificant presence on campus"
each quarter.
In addition, a full-time faculty
member "must not have signifi
cant outside managerial responsi
bilities nor act as a principal
investigator on sponsored pro
jects that could be conducted at
Stanford" but are carried out
elsewhere.
These requirements are mostly
designed to catch problems with
outside business connections and
research, Heller said.
"The University has had a pol
icy for a long time that faculty
members can't teach elsewhere,
but there are no rules with
respect to research," he said.
"There are valid reasons for out
side work, but if you can do it

here, you should."
The policy also states that "fac
ulty must disclose to the Univer
sity whether they [or family
members] have consulting
arrangements, significant finan
cial interests, or employment in
an outside entity" before Stan
ford will approve arrangements
with such entities.
Heller said that at least two
schools within the University
already have similar terms. But
until now, there has not been a
University-wide requirement for
disclosure.

In these borderline
calls, I would come
down on the side of
being covered by the
new policy.'
— Elliot Levinthal

"It's not an onerous process,"
he said. "The purpose of disclo
sure is that if there are situations
which to a reasonable person
would look fishy, we need to get
that out on the table."
The third major change
involves the ownership of intellec
tual property. Faculty who work
on research at the University
often receive funding from grants
and gift funds to complement the
resources they get from Stanford.
The current policy allows fac
ulty members working under
such funds to retain ownership of
their discoveries unless their
sponsoring grant or contract
specifies otherwise. Stanford is
one of the few universities with
such a policy.
In reality, however, most facul
ty researchers work with a mix
ture of funds, and the current pol
icy means that inventors are
faced with the often impossible
task of distinguishing which
funds they were working with at
the time the discovery was made.
Committee members believe
the current policy leads inevitably
to adversarial situations which
pit the University against the
inventor's sponsors. To ease this

conflict, the new policy gives to
Stanford ownership of all techno
logical discoveries made with
"more than incidental use" of
University resources.
Following a tradition of aca
demic freedom, the policy will not
apply to scholarly or artistic
works such as books, articles, art
or music. These creations often
arise out of the course of Univer
sity activity and represent the
beliefs of the inventor.
However, the issue of comput
er software poses a problem, since
it can be used both as a digital
version of a scholarly work and as
a technological tool.
In keeping with a policy pro
mulgated last year by the Com
mittee on Academic Computing
and Information Systems, the
Committee on Research ultimate
ly decided that the dividing line
between scholarly works and
technological tools should be the
same for software as it is for other
types of intellectual property.
An 'unfair distinction'?
While Heller and other com
mittee members hold that the pol
icy's primary goal is to protect the
faculty from external accusations
of unethical conduct, many facul
ty members are worried about the
document's language and content.
First on many objectors' minds
is the issue of intellectual proper
ty rights.
"It's very unclear what prob
lem the University is trying to
solve by taking ownership," said
Electrical Engineering Prof. Tony
Siegman.
Siegman also raised the issue
of inventions "deliberately placed
in the public domain so no one
can make money from them." For
example, Computer Science Prof.
Donald Knuth voluntarily gave
up any personal rights to his pop
ular typesetting program, Tech,
so that the public would have
access to it.
Furthermore, Siegman said he
believes upholding the traditional
protection of books, art and music
as the sole property of their cre
ators creates an "unfair distinc
tion" between these innovations
and their more technical counter
parts.
"This [distinction] seems to

say scientific and technological
accomplishments are not as aca
demic as books," Siegman said,
adding that many textbooks have
generated a great deal of money
for their writers.
The University's siphoning of
funds which formerly would have
gone directly to the innovator has
also caught the faculty's atten
tion. Even supporters of the
clause's general principle admit
that it may mean slashed revenue
for some faculty members.
"There certainly have been
cases where faculty members
have legitimately held
patents. . .that have turned out to
be of significant value," said
Elliott Levinthal, professor emer
itus of Mechanical Engineering.
"Since the new policy will give
the creator a one-third share,
then I suppose it decreases poten
tial dividends by a factor of
three," he said.
According to Heller, however,
the rationale behind the Universi
ty's claim to intellectual property
rights is clear and basic. He point
ed to the almost impossible task
with which innovators are faced
in a "mixed funding" situation.
"The committee felt that the
only way out of this box was to
have a clearly laid-out policy stat
ing that ownership automatically
goes to the University," Heller
said, stressing that "this is not a
money grab."
Financial returns from inven
tions are not a big source of
income to the University, Heller
said. Ninety percent of Stanford's
royalties come from seven
patents, leaving thousands of
patents with incomes that add up
to less than $10,000.
"This is the wrong place to
look for easy cash," he added.
Another potentially volatile
topic is the document's attempt to
categorize software and exempt
certain types from the Universi
ty's claims.
"Drawing lines between com
mercial and non-commercial soft
ware just can't be done," said
Siegman. "They just haven't
thought the problem through."
While he said he believes a rea
sonable person should be able to
distinguish between the two
types, Levinthal pointed out the

difficulties in classifying educa
tional and/or interactive software,
as software designed to teach is a
lucrative business.
"In these borderline calls, I
would come down on the side of
being covered by the new policy,"
Levinthal said. "You shouldn't be
able to get around the rules by
tacking on standard text."
Dissatisfaction with the docu
ment's "vagueness" also under
lies many more specific worries.
"The [Feb. 2 draft], as it is writ
ten suffers from a chronic lack of
clarity," said Industrial Engineer
ing Prof. Warren Hausman.
"It's unclear which sections of
the policy are inviolate and which
can be waived," Hausman said,
adding that the policy is much too
vague on the cost-benefit analysis
of outside faculty work.
The document is "intentional
ly vague" to ensure room for indi
vidual implementation in schools
and departments, Heller said.

'It's unclear which
sections of the policy
are inviolate and
which can be waived.'

Beyond these widely shared
objections, dozens of smaller wor
ries are likely to surface at the
senate meeting.
Even among those who fear
the policy's impact, many are sup
porting the University's move to
address issues of ethics and dis
closure.
A strong supporter of the con
flict policy's push for openness,
Levinthal said he is "strongly
biased in that direction."
Faculty members are far too
concerned with confidentiality
issues, he said. "We get a lot of
benefits working at Stanford, but
they are traded off for some con
straints," he said.
Both Heller and Levinthal
stressed that conflict-of-interest
situations are unavoidable, and
their emergence does not neces
sarily signal impropriety.

"Conflict of interests are
inevitable situations," said
Heller. "They don't equal bad
people. The best we can do is to
disclose the information to some
one else."
A 'timely topic'
"The real issue is that we are
trying to put our house in order
with respect to conflicts of inter
est," said Heller. "People say
there is an anti-intellectual, anti
university feeling in the country
right now. ... If we are an insti
tution of public trust, we have to
be sure we warrant that trust."
In 1992, faculty at a retreat
sponsored by the Dean of
Research recommended that
Stanford lay out its guidelines
on conflict of interest. In the fall
of the same year, University
President Gerhard Casper asked
the Committee on Research to
examine Stanford's current poli
cies.
At the same time, both the
National Science Foundation and
the National Institute of Health
were in the process of formulat
ing their own conflict of interest
policies.
"It seemed like a timely topic
because several federal agencies
are considering conflict of inter
est rules that would apply to
Stanford faculty and students,"
said Boxer. "The University did
not have a modern version."
In the face of federal changes,
another incentive for Stanford's
revision came from the American
Association of Universities, which
"felt that universities should
have their own policies, not be
dictated to from the outside," said
Heller.
Boxer said the committee
began by examining existing poli
cies. The committee also exam
ined drafts of the NIH and NSF
regulations, as well as policies
from other institutions and the
recommendations of the AAU.
The policy went to the Senate
last May for discussion, and the
committee has held open meet
ings during the last year to get
comments on the drafts.
"I don't think there has been
any feedback that we haven't con
sidered to improve the policy,"
said Heller.
Capping more than two years
of meetings and drafts, the Facul
ty Senate will debate a conflict of
interest policy today which would
set guidelines for external faculty
research, consulting and invest
ments.
If accepted by the University,
the Faculty Policy on Conflict of

among other things — require

nancial interests, and give owner

The University's siphoning of
funds which formerly would have
gone directly to the innovator has
also caught the faculty's atten
tion. Even supporters of the
clause's general principle admit
that it may mean slashed revenue
for some faculty members.
"There certainly have been
cases where faculty members
have legitimately held
patents. . .that have turned out to
be of significant value," said
Elliott Levinthal, professor emer
itus of Mechanical Engineering.
"Since the new policy will give
the creator a one-third share,
then I suppose it decreases poten
tial dividends by a factor of
three," he said.
According to Heller, however,
the rationale behind the Universi
ty's claim to intellectual property
rights is clear and basic. He point
ed to the almost impossible task
with which innovators are faced
in a "mixed funding" situation.
"The committee felt that the
only way out of this box was to
have a clearly laid-out policy stat
ing that ownership automatically
goes to the University," Heller
said, stressing that "this is not a
money grab."
Financial returns from inven
tions are not a big source of
income to the University, Heller
said. Ninety percent of Stanford's
royalties come from seven
patents, leaving thousands of
patents with incomes that add up
to less than $10,000.
"This is the wrong place to
look for easy cash," he added.
Another potentially volatile
topic is the document's attempt to
categorize software and exempt
certain types from the Universi
ty's claims.
"Drawing lines between com
mercial and non-commercial soft
ware just can't be done," said
Siegman. "They just haven't
thought the problem through."
While he said he believes a rea
sonable person should be able to
distinguish between the two
types, Levinthal pointed out the

difficulties in classifying educa
tional and/or interactive software,
as software designed to teach is a
lucrative business.
"In these borderline calls, I
would come down on the side of
being covered by the new policy,"
Levinthal said. "You shouldn't be
able to get around the rules by
tacking on standard text."
Dissatisfaction with the docu
ment's "vagueness" also under
lies many more specific worries.
"The [Feb. 2 draft], as it is writ
ten suffers from a chronic lack of
clarity," said Industrial Engineer
ing Prof. Warren Hausman.
"It's unclear which sections of
the policy are inviolate and which
can be waived," Hausman said,
adding that the policy is much too
vague on the cost-benefit analysis
of outside faculty work.
The document is "intentional
ly vague" to ensure room for indi
vidual implementation in schools
and departments, Heller said.

'It's unclear which

Beyond these widely shared
objections, dozens of smaller wor
ries are likely to surface at the
senate meeting.
Even among those who fear
the policy's impact, many are sup
porting the University's move to
address issues of ethics and dis
closure.
A strong supporter of the con
flict policy's push for openness,
Levinthal said he is "strongly
biased in that direction."
Faculty members are far too
concerned with confidentiality
issues, he said. "We get a lot of
benefits working at Stanford, but
they are traded off for some con
straints," he said.
Both Heller and Levinthal
stressed that conflict-of-interest
situations are unavoidable, and
their emergence does not neces
sarily signal impropriety.

"Conflict of interests are
inevitable situations," said
Heller. "They don't equal bad
people. The best we can do is to
disclose the information to some
one else."
A 'timely topic'
"The real issue is that we are
trying to put our house in order
with respect to conflicts of inter
est," said Heller. "People say
there is an anti-intellectual, anti
university feeling in the country
right now. ... If we are an insti
tution of public trust, we have to
be sure we warrant that trust."
In 1992, faculty at a retreat
sponsored by the Dean of
Research recommended that
Stanford lay out its guidelines
on conflict of interest. In the fall
of the same year, University
President Gerhard Casper asked
the Committee on Research to
examine Stanford's current poli
cies.
At the same time, both the
National Science Foundation and
the National Institute of Health
were in the process of formulat
ing their own conflict of interest
policies.
"It seemed like a timely topic
because several federal agencies
are considering conflict of inter
est rules that would apply to
Stanford faculty and students,"
said Boxer. "The University did
not have a modern version."
In the face of federal changes,
another incentive for Stanford's
revision came from the American
Association of Universities, which
"felt that universities should
have their own policies, not be
dictated to from the outside," said
Heller.
Boxer said the committee
began by examining existing poli
cies. The committee also exam
ined drafts of the NIH and NSF
regulations, as well as policies
from other institutions and the
recommendations of the AAU.
The policy went to the Senate
last May for discussion, and the
committee has held open meet
ings during the last year to get
comments on the drafts.
"I don't think there has been
any feedback that we haven't con
sidered to improve the policy,"
said Heller.
Capping more than two years
of meetings and drafts, the Facul
ty Senate will debate a conflict of
interest policy today which would
set guidelines for external faculty
research, consulting and invest
ments.
If accepted by the University,
the Faculty Policy on Conflict of
Commitment and Interest will —
among other things — require
faculty members to maintain a
significant presence on campus,
disclose their outside work and fi
nancial interests, and give owner
ship of all inventions created with
University resources to the Uni
versity.
"To protect faculty from accu
sations coming from the outside
. . . individuals have to feel
they've sacrificed a little for the

good of the whole," said Biology

Prof. Craig
Heller, chair of
the senate Com
mittee on Re
search, which de
signed the policy.
But the policy
is expected to
cause consider
able contention
at today's meet-

ing.
"Everybody always assumes
the worst about new policies,"
Heller said. "It's inevitable that we
should be expected to justify it."
After spending the next two
meetings discussing the final
draft, the senate will vote on
whether it should recommend
that the University adopt the pol
icy.
The document covers both con


Heller
flicts of interest — which occur
when a faculty member's work at
the University could be influ
enced by outside financial connec
tions — and conflicts of commit
ment, situations in which faculty
involvement in an external activi
ty has an adverse effect on their
Stanford responsibilities.
Although the University has
addressed some of these issues in
the past, it has never had a com
prehensive policy. The draft lays
out 11 provisions that faculty
members must follow in deter
mining whether their actions are
aboveboard.
A changing world
While the University has had
some form of policy to deal with
conflict of interest problems since
1966, it has never had a specific
document to address conflict of
commitment situations.
"The policy comes to grips with
issues that weren't issues in the
19605," said Chemistry Prof.
Steven Boxer, a member of the
committee. "Historically, faculty
did a great deal of consulting but
major participation in companies
is a relatively recent phe
nomenon. This is a change in the
business world, not in the Univer
sity."
Specifically, the policy states
that "faculty must maintain a sig
nificant presence on campus"
each quarter.
In addition, a full-time faculty
member "must not have signifi
cant outside managerial responsi
bilities nor act as a principal
investigator on sponsored pro
jects that could be conducted at
Stanford" but are carried out
elsewhere.
These requirements are mostly
designed to catch problems with
outside business connections and
research, Heller said.
"The University has had a pol
icy for a long time that faculty
members can't teach elsewhere,
but there are no rules with
respect to research," he said.
"There are valid reasons for out
side work, but if you can do it

here, you should."
The policy also states that "fac
ulty must disclose to the Univer
sity whether they [or family
members] have consulting
arrangements, significant finan
cial interests, or employment in
an outside entity" before Stan
ford will approve arrangements
with such entities.
Heller said that at least two
schools within the University
already have similar terms. But
until now, there has not been a
University-wide requirement for
disclosure.

In these borderline
calls, I would come
down on the side of
being covered by the
new policy.'
— Elliot Levinthal

"It's not an onerous process,"
he said. "The purpose of disclo
sure is that if there are situations
which to a reasonable person
would look fishy, we need to get
that out on the table."
The third major change
involves the ownership of intellec
tual property. Faculty who work
on research at the University
often receive funding from grants
and gift funds to complement the
resources they get from Stanford.
The current policy allows fac
ulty members working under
such funds to retain ownership of
their discoveries unless their
sponsoring grant or contract
specifies otherwise. Stanford is
one of the few universities with
such a policy.
In reality, however, most facul
ty researchers work with a mix
ture of funds, and the current pol
icy means that inventors are
faced with the often impossible
task of distinguishing which
funds they were working with at
the time the discovery was made.
Committee members believe
the current policy leads inevitably
to adversarial situations which
pit the University against the
inventor's sponsors. To ease this

conflict, the new policy gives to
Stanford ownership of all techno
logical discoveries made with
"more than incidental use" of
University resources.
Following a tradition of aca
demic freedom, the policy will not
apply to scholarly or artistic
works such as books, articles, art
or music. These creations often
arise out of the course of Univer
sity activity and represent the
beliefs of the inventor.
However, the issue of comput
er software poses a problem, since
it can be used both as a digital
version of a scholarly work and as
a technological tool.
In keeping with a policy pro
mulgated last year by the Com
mittee on Academic Computing
and Information Systems, the
Committee on Research ultimate
ly decided that the dividing line
between scholarly works and
technological tools should be the
same for software as it is for other
types of intellectual property.
An 'unfair distinction'?
While Heller and other com
mittee members hold that the pol
icy's primary goal is to protect the
faculty from external accusations
of unethical conduct, many facul
ty members are worried about the
document's language and content.
First on many objectors' minds
is the issue of intellectual proper
ty rights.
"It's very unclear what prob
lem the University is trying to
solve by taking ownership," said
Electrical Engineering Prof. Tony
Siegman.
Siegman also raised the issue
of inventions "deliberately placed
in the public domain so no one
can make money from them." For
example, Computer Science Prof.
Donald Knuth voluntarily gave
up any personal rights to his pop
ular typesetting program, Tech,
so that the public would have
access to it.
Furthermore, Siegman said he
believes upholding the traditional
protection of books, art and music
as the sole property of their cre
ators creates an "unfair distinc
tion" between these innovations
and their more technical counter
parts.
"This [distinction] seems to

say scientific and technological
accomplishments are not as aca
demic as books," Siegman said,
adding that many textbooks have
generated a great deal of money
for their writers.
The University's siphoning of
funds which formerly would have
gone directly to the innovator has
also caught the faculty's atten
tion. Even supporters of the
clause's general principle admit
that it may mean slashed revenue
for some faculty members.
"There certainly have been
cases where faculty members
have legitimately held
patents. . .that have turned out to
be of significant value," said
Elliott Levinthal, professor emer
itus of Mechanical Engineering.
"Since the new policy will give
the creator a one-third share,
then I suppose it decreases poten
tial dividends by a factor of
three," he said.
According to Heller, however,
the rationale behind the Universi
ty's claim to intellectual property
rights is clear and basic. He point
ed to the almost impossible task
with which innovators are faced
in a "mixed funding" situation.
"The committee felt that the
only way out of this box was to

ing that ownership automatically
goes to the University," Heller
said, stressing that "this is not a
money grab."
Financial returns from inven
tions are not a big source of
income to the University, Heller
said. Ninety percent of Stanford's
royalties come from seven
patents, leaving thousands of
patents with incomes that add up
to less than $10,000.
"This is the wrong place to
look for easy cash," he added.
Another potentially volatile
topic is the document's attempt to
categorize software and exempt
certain types from the Universi
ty's claims.
"Drawing lines between com
mercial and non-commercial soft
ware just can't be done," said
Siegman. "They just haven't
thought the problem through."
While he said he believes a rea
sonable person should be able to
distinguish between the two
types, Levinthal pointed out the

difficulties in classifying educa
tional and/or interactive software,
as software designed to teach is a
lucrative business.
"In these borderline calls, I

flicts of interest — which occur
when a faculty member's work at
the University could be influ
enced by outside financial connec
tions — and conflicts of commit
ment, situations in which faculty
involvement in an external activi
ty has an adverse effect on their
Stanford responsibilities.
Although the University has
addressed some of these issues in
the past, it has never had a com
prehensive policy. The draft lays
out 11 provisions that faculty
members must follow in deter
mining whether their actions are
aboveboard.
A changing world
While the University has had
some form of policy to deal with
conflict of interest problems since
1966, it has never had a specific
document to address conflict of
commitment situations.
"The policy comes to grips with
issues that weren't issues in the
19605," said Chemistry Prof.
Steven Boxer, a member of the
committee. "Historically, faculty
did a great deal of consulting but
major participation in companies
is a relatively recent phe
nomenon. This is a change in the
business world, not in the Univer
sity."
Specifically, the policy states
that "faculty must maintain a sig
nificant presence on campus"
each quarter.
In addition, a full-time faculty
member "must not have signifi
cant outside managerial responsi
bilities nor act as a principal
investigator on sponsored pro
jects that could be conducted at
Stanford" but are carried out
elsewhere.
These requirements are mostly
designed to catch problems with
outside business connections and
research, Heller said.
"The University has had a pol
icy for a long time that faculty
members can't teach elsewhere,
but there are no rules with
respect to research," he said.
"There are valid reasons for out
side work, but if you can do it

here, you should."
The policy also states that "fac
ulty must disclose to the Univer
sity whether they [or family
members] have consulting
arrangements, significant finan
cial interests, or employment in
an outside entity" before Stan
ford will approve arrangements
with such entities.
Heller said that at least two
schools within the University
already have similar terms. But
until now, there has not been a
University-wide requirement for
disclosure.

In these borderline
calls, I would come
down on the side of
being covered by the
new policy.'
— Elliot Levinthal

"It's not an onerous process,"
he said. "The purpose of disclo
sure is that if there are situations
which to a reasonable person
would look fishy, we need to get
that out on the table."
The third major change
involves the ownership of intellec
tual property. Faculty who work
on research at the University
often receive funding from grants
and gift funds to complement the
resources they get from Stanford.
The current policy allows fac
ulty members working under
such funds to retain ownership of
their discoveries unless their
sponsoring grant or contract
specifies otherwise. Stanford is
one of the few universities with
such a policy.
In reality, however, most facul
ty researchers work with a mix
ture of funds, and the current pol
icy means that inventors are
faced with the often impossible
task of distinguishing which
funds they were working with at
the time the discovery was made.
Committee members believe
the current policy leads inevitably
to adversarial situations which
pit the University against the
inventor's sponsors. To ease this

conflict, the new policy gives to
Stanford ownership of all techno
logical discoveries made with
"more than incidental use" of
University resources.
Following a tradition of aca
demic freedom, the policy will not
apply to scholarly or artistic
works such as books, articles, art
or music. These creations often
arise out of the course of Univer
sity activity and represent the
beliefs of the inventor.
However, the issue of comput
er software poses a problem, since
it can be used both as a digital
version of a scholarly work and as
a technological tool.
In keeping with a policy pro
mulgated last year by the Com
mittee on Academic Computing
and Information Systems, the
Committee on Research ultimate
ly decided that the dividing line
between scholarly works and
technological tools should be the
same for software as it is for other
types of intellectual property.
An 'unfair distinction'?
While Heller and other com
mittee members hold that the pol
icy's primary goal is to protect the
faculty from external accusations
of unethical conduct, many facul
ty members are worried about the
document's language and content.
First on many objectors' minds
is the issue of intellectual proper
ty rights.
"It's very unclear what prob
lem the University is trying to
solve by taking ownership," said
Electrical Engineering Prof. Tony
Siegman.
Siegman also raised the issue
of inventions "deliberately placed
in the public domain so no one
can make money from them." For
example, Computer Science Prof.
Donald Knuth voluntarily gave
up any personal rights to his pop
ular typesetting program, Tech,
so that the public would have
access to it.
Furthermore, Siegman said he
believes upholding the traditional
protection of books, art and music
as the sole property of their cre
ators creates an "unfair distinc
tion" between these innovations
and their more technical counter
parts.
"This [distinction] seems to

say scientific and technological
accomplishments are not as aca
demic as books," Siegman said,
adding that many textbooks have
generated a great deal of money
for their writers.
The University's siphoning of
funds which formerly would have
gone directly to the innovator has
also caught the faculty's atten
tion. Even supporters of the
clause's general principle admit
that it may mean slashed revenue
for some faculty members.
"There certainly have been
cases where faculty members
have legitimately held
patents. . .that have turned out to
be of significant value," said
Elliott Levinthal, professor emer
itus of Mechanical Engineering.
"Since the new policy will give
the creator a one-third share,
then I suppose it decreases poten
tial dividends by a factor of
three," he said.
According to Heller, however,
the rationale behind the Universi
ty's claim to intellectual property
rights is clear and basic. He point
ed to the almost impossible task
with which innovators are faced
in a "mixed funding" situation.
"The committee felt that the
only way out of this box was to
have a clearly laid-out policy stat
ing that ownership automatically
goes to the University," Heller
said, stressing that "this is not a
money grab."
Financial returns from inven
tions are not a big source of
income to the University, Heller
said. Ninety percent of Stanford's
royalties come from seven
patents, leaving thousands of
patents with incomes that add up
to less than $10,000.
"This is the wrong place to
look for easy cash," he added.
Another potentially volatile
topic is the document's attempt to
categorize software and exempt
certain types from the Universi
ty's claims.
"Drawing lines between com
mercial and non-commercial soft
ware just can't be done," said
Siegman. "They just haven't
thought the problem through."
While he said he believes a rea
sonable person should be able to
distinguish between the two
types, Levinthal pointed out the

difficulties in classifying educa
tional and/or interactive software,
as software designed to teach is a
lucrative business.
"In these borderline calls, I
would come down on the side of
being covered by the new policy,"
Levinthal said. "You shouldn't be
able to get around the rules by
tacking on standard text."
Dissatisfaction with the docu
ment's "vagueness" also under
lies many more specific worries.
"The [Feb. 2 draft], as it is writ
ten suffers from a chronic lack of
clarity," said Industrial Engineer
ing Prof. Warren Hausman.
"It's unclear which sections of
the policy are inviolate and which
can be waived," Hausman said,
adding that the policy is much too
vague on the cost-benefit analysis
of outside faculty work.
The document is "intentional
ly vague" to ensure room for indi
vidual implementation in schools
and departments, Heller said.

'It's unclear which
sections of the policy
are inviolate and
which can be waived.'

Beyond these widely shared
objections, dozens of smaller wor
ries are likely to surface at the
senate meeting.
Even among those who fear
the policy's impact, many are sup
porting the University's move to
address issues of ethics and dis
closure.
A strong supporter of the con
flict policy's push for openness,
Levinthal said he is "strongly
biased in that direction."
Faculty members are far too
concerned with confidentiality
issues, he said. "We get a lot of
benefits working at Stanford, but
they are traded off for some con
straints," he said.
Both Heller and Levinthal
stressed that conflict-of-interest
situations are unavoidable, and
their emergence does not neces
sarily signal impropriety.

"Conflict of interests are
inevitable situations," said
Heller. "They don't equal bad
people. The best we can do is to
disclose the information to some
one else."
A 'timely topic'
"The real issue is that we are
trying to put our house in order
with respect to conflicts of inter
est," said Heller. "People say
there is an anti-intellectual, anti
university feeling in the country
right now. ... If we are an insti
tution of public trust, we have to
be sure we warrant that trust."
In 1992, faculty at a retreat
sponsored by the Dean of
Research recommended that
Stanford lay out its guidelines
on conflict of interest. In the fall
of the same year, University
President Gerhard Casper asked
the Committee on Research to
examine Stanford's current poli
cies.
At the same time, both the
National Science Foundation and
the National Institute of Health
were in the process of formulat
ing their own conflict of interest
policies.
"It seemed like a timely topic
because several federal agencies
are considering conflict of inter
est rules that would apply to
Stanford faculty and students,"
said Boxer. "The University did
not have a modern version."
In the face of federal changes,
another incentive for Stanford's
revision came from the American
Association of Universities, which
"felt that universities should
have their own policies, not be
dictated to from the outside," said
Heller.
Boxer said the committee
began by examining existing poli
cies. The committee also exam
ined drafts of the NIH and NSF
regulations, as well as policies
from other institutions and the
recommendations of the AAU.
The policy went to the Senate
last May for discussion, and the
committee has held open meet
ings during the last year to get
comments on the drafts.
"I don't think there has been
any feedback that we haven't con
sidered to improve the policy,"
said Heller.
Capping more than two years
of meetings and drafts, the Facul
ty Senate will debate a conflict of
interest policy today which would
set guidelines for external faculty
research, consulting and invest
ments.
If accepted by the University,
the Faculty Policy on Conflict of
Commitment and Interest will —
among other things — require
faculty members to maintain a
significant presence on campus,
disclose their outside work and fi
nancial interests, and give owner
ship of all inventions created with
University resources to the Uni
versity.
"To protect faculty from accu
sations coming from the outside
. . . individuals have to feel
they've sacrificed a little for the

good of the whole," said Biology

Prof. Craig
Heller, chair of
the senate Com
mittee on Re
search, which de
signed the policy.
But the policy
is expected to
cause consider
able contention
at today's meet-

ing.
"Everybody always assumes
the worst about new policies,"
Heller said. "It's inevitable that we
should be expected to justify it."
After spending the next two
meetings discussing the final
draft, the senate will vote on
whether it should recommend
that the University adopt the pol
icy.
The document covers both con

flicts of interest — which occur
when a faculty member's work at
the University could be influ
enced by outside financial connec
tions — and conflicts of commit
ment, situations in which faculty
involvement in an external activi
