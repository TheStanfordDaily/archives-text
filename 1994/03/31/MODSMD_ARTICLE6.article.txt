# Future for Bridge remains uncertain
## Meeting leaves new site 'up in the air' 
### Sandy Lee Staff writer 
While the Bridge will remain in
its building next year, a meeting
between student counseling stafT
and University administrators
last night reached no conclusion
on the service's long-term future.
A recent University study
deemed the building that houses
the Bridge unsafe and said it will
require $250,000 to $300,000 in
repairs to meet fire code stan
dards. Repairs for the short term
will cost about $15,000.
Although last night's meeting
put to rest concern over the
Bridge's operation for next year,
Bridge staff and administrators
who attended said it hardly pro
duced a solid resolution.
"We came into the meeting
with the hopes that Ithe Universi
ty! would give us more — that

we'd be more concretely set," said
Chris Li, co-staffing coordinator
at the Bridge. "But we left the
meeting with the reality that
we're just at the beginning. It's
going to be a long process from
here, with a lot of discussion with
the University."
But Bridge counselors said they
are relieved that the counseling
center's operation for the next year
is no longer in jeopardy, giving
them time to organize a task force
to look into options for the future.
"While we'd like to stay in the
space we have now, we're trying
to keep our options open," Li said.
Those options include obtain
ing other office space on campus
with the Office of Student Activi
ties or working with Residential
Education to find a spot in stu
dent housing. However, Li said,
both possibilities are still "up in
the air."
Acting co-director of Res Ed
Ann Porteus agreed that it is still
premature to be talking about a
Res Ed solution. "There are a lot
of options that the Bridge is con

sidering, and we're just one of
them," she said.
While the Bridge seeks a per
manent site, the Office of Student
Activities will start on immediate
remedies to allow the Bridge to
continue operating.
"We're still getting cost esti
mates," said Program Coordina
tor Troy Gilbert. "We're working
on the short-term plan — making
the Bridge habitable for next year.

Beyond that we're not sure."
The building will be inspected
by Gilbert and a fire marshal next
week, who will determine what
repairs it will need to meet fire
code standards.
Li said administrators have not
said where money for repairs
might come from. "[The Bridge]
certainly can contribute, but we
don't know how much they want
us to contribute," he said.

After last night's meeting,
counselors expressed doubts
about the feasibility of remaining
in the same building beyond the
next couple of years.
Tina Syer, the Bridge's co
staffing coordinator, said that
although retaining the current
space would be the ideal solution
she felt the large costs quoted by
Gilbert indicated that the house is
likely too expensive to salvage.

"It's frustrating because stay
ing in the house doesn't seem like
an option anymore in the long
run," she said.
The lack of a firm promise
from administrators has caused
some anxiety for counselors, Li
said. "In an ideal world, they'd
give us a commitment to the space
and the program. They gave us a
validation of the program, but the
problem is with finding space."

Syer added that administrators
"kept saying that there are many
priorities. We expressed a wish to
be among the top priorities, and
they said they couldn't promise us
that, which is frustrating but
understandable."
But live-in counselor Andy
Katz said he is optimistic that the
problems will be resolved. The
meeting was "very cooperative
and positive," he said.
