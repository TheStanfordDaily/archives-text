# Speakers debate health care plan
## Agree reforms are necessary, but disagree over the means 
### Emily Bazar Staff writer 
Two speakers agreed on the necessity of
changing the national health care system during
a discussion of the Clinton proposal yesterday,
but differed over the means of achieving such re
form.
Law Prof. Hank Greely and Hoover Institution
Senior Fellow Rita Ricardo-Campbell concluded,
during a debate sponsored by the Stanford Feder
alist Society, that because 14 percent of the annu
al gross domestic product is spent on health care
and approximately 39 million Americans go with
out health insurance, health care reform is cru
cial.
According to Ricardo-Campbell, "the majority of
those presently uninsured are young people who
are no longer eligible under their parents' policy."
But Ricardo-Campbell opposes Clinton's plan
for universal coverage, which would insure these
young people. Because the proposal requires the
same premium for everyone within a health al
liance, regardless of age, sex or previous medical
condition, Ricardo-Campbell anticipates economic
inequity.
"Young people don't have a high demand for
health care. If everyone pays the same rate, income
is transferred from young to old, and from lower to
higher income ranges," she said.
In part, because older and richer people will gain
at the expense of younger, poorer citizens, Ricardo-
Campbell opposes Clinton's plan and advocates a
market-based solution that does
not mandate employers to provide
health care for their employees.
In addition, Ricardo-Campbell
suggested that these economic

inequities would further stratify
health care because, under man
aged health organizations,
patients would not be able to
choose their physicians.
With organizations controlling
referrals to specialists, Ricardo-
Campbell said that only the very
wealthy who can afford private
plans will be able to choose a

physician. She said others who
cannot afford a private plan will
be "pushed or enticed" by Clinton
into an HMO.
Greely, although not complete
ly comfortable with Clinton's pro
posal, said he supports a plan
requiring universal health cover
age because it will cover younger,
poorer people who traditionally

forego insurance.
According to Greely, universal
coverage "would cut down on
incentives to play games. If every
one is covered, hospitals have
incentive to take care of everyone."
Although Greely supports uni
versal coverage, which
"genuinely helps people who may
get hurt badly when they are

caught in a non-covered period,"
he does not completely support
Clinton's plan.
Like Ricardo-Campbell, Greely
wants health policy to harness
market forces to make the health
system more efficient. However,
Greely believes market forces will
operate through HMOs to keep
the costs down.
