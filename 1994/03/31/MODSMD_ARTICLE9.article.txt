Stocks decline again
NLW YORK (AP) â€” The stock market ended
sharply lower in volatile trading yesterday, once
again taking its cue from bonds and extending its
losses for a fifth consecutive day.
The Dow Jones industrial average tumbled
72.27 points to 3,626.75, the lowest level since
Nov. 4. The best-known barometer of the stock
market's health has lost 8.8 percent since its high
of 3,978.36 reached on Jan. 31, and more than 242
points in this most recent decline, which began on
March 24.
"It's a very nervous market," said David Shul
man, chief market strategist at Salomon Brothers.
There was no one event to account for the mar
ket's slide, analysts said.
Rather, rising interest rates, the Whitewater
iiffair and political instability abroad have made
investors jittery, despite the steadily improving
economy and indications that inflation is not yet
an issue.
