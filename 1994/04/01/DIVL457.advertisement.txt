The coastal storms that blew through
New England took a substantial chunk
out of our disaster budget. And that was
just one of more than 55,000 disasters
in the most devastating year we've ever
had to face.
Helping disaster victims is our mission.
But unless we raise millions
immediately, our ability to provide
victims with the disaster relief they will
need is in jeopardy. Please help.
