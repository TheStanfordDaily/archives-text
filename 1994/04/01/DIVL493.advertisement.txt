Product Description
SaIesBUILDER is a software product that provides customers with an unprecedented
advantage in the customer-driven marketplace of the '90s. Within its first year of delivery,
SaIesBUILDER became widely recognized as the standard for sales configuration in the
build-to-order manufacturing industry. SaIesBUILDER supports a salesperson in gathering
customer requirements, using this information to automatically generate accurate
configurations, price quotes, and graphical representations of configured products. The
result is the simultaneous delivery of total quality to the potential customer and ensured
integrity at the front end of the order process. A maintenance interface exists enabling a
wide variety of people in a company to keep product and pricing information up-to-date.
SaIesBUILDER's open architecture facilitates integration with other business systems, and
its unique design capitalizes on advanced technologies, including object-oriented
programming, portable graphical user interfaces, and client/server architecture, to deliver
systems in any computing environment. SaIesBUILDER interfaces to SQL relational
databases and is portable across MS Windows, UNIX, and Macintosh operating systems.
Consulting positions open to technical majors and all those with interest and
skill in information technology.
