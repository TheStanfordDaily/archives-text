# Summer storage details finalized
## For a fee, students' goods will be stored at three campus locations 
### Jim Luh Staff writer 
After almost a year of collaboration
with the ASSU, the University is making
final preparations for the return of sum
mer storage.
Summer storage will be offered in
Wilbur Hall, Lagunita Court and Lambda
Nu, and for the first time, will cost stu
dents a fee. The service was eliminated
t*o years ago due to budget constraints
and fire codes.
According to Assoc. Director of Hous
ing and Dining Services Rodger Whitney,
students will be able to store their belong
ings for the summer starting May 23.

The University will provide four types
of storage. Storage in a medium-size box
provided by the University will cost $5
while a large box will cost $10. Computer
storage in up to three boxes supplied by
the student will cost $15. Storage for bicy
cles or odd-sized items such as surfboards
or skis will cost $20.
Each storage location's office will sell
the boxes and storage tags corresponding
to storage in that residence. Students will
have their choice of storagesitea until that
location is filled.
Once they have purchased their tags
and boxes, students will bring their be
longings to the storage areas during desig
nated storage hours, which are planned to

be between 2 p.m. and 7 p.m. on weekdays.
The new plan differs from the Univer
sity's previous summer storage plan,
which allocated space on a first-come,
first-served basis and allowed students to
store as much as space allowed at no
charge.
Whitney said the University had to
charge for storage due to a directive from
Vice Provost for Student Affairs Mary Ed
monds that any storage plan offered by
the University had to pay for itself.
The University paid for the program's
start-up costs up front, including adminis
tration, supplies, security and capital im-
provements on the storage areas
that had to be made to comply with
fire and safety codes.
"We really have a mandate that
we have to recover the costs of the
program," Whitney said.
The new fee-based system might
also be more equitable, Whitney
said, because storage will be paid for
by the people who use it; in the past,
it was effectively paid for by all stu
dents in their house rent.
Whitney said he anticipates the
system will be able to accommodate
student demand and that he hopes
the system will pay for itself within
a few years.
"It's not an inexpensive proposi
tion, but we feel like there's going to
be sufficient demand," he said.
Whitney credited the Council of
Presidents and Senate Chair Greg
Waldorf for their assistance in
gauging student needs and propos
ing workable solutions for storage.
"[Waldorf] has worked very well
with us," Whitney said. "That's been
a very nice working relationship."
Waldorf said he was pleased with
the cooperation he encountered
from Whitney and Assoc. Manager
for Housing Operations Lynn Glick.
"I thought that the process will
hopefully set a model for how stu
dent government can work with the
administration in the future," Wal
dorf said.
