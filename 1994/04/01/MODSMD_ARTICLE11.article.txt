After almost a year of collaboration
with the ASSU, the University is making
final preparations for the return of sum
mer storage.
Summer storage will be offered in
Wilbur Hall, Lagunita Court and Lambda
Nu, and for the first time, will cost stu
dents a fee. The service was eliminated
t*o years ago due to budget constraints
and fire codes.
According to Assoc. Director of Hous
ing and Dining Services Rodger Whitney,
students will be able to store their belong
ings for the summer starting May 23.

The University will provide four types
of storage. Storage in a medium-size box
provided by the University will cost $5
while a large box will cost $10. Computer
storage in up to three boxes supplied by
the student will cost $15. Storage for bicy
cles or odd-sized items such as surfboards
or skis will cost $20.
Each storage location's office will sell
the boxes and storage tags corresponding
to storage in that residence. Students will
have their choice of storagesitea until that
location is filled.
Once they have purchased their tags
and boxes, students will bring their be
longings to the storage areas during desig
nated storage hours, which are planned to

be between 2 p.m. and 7 p.m. on weekdays.
The new plan differs from the Univer
sity's previous summer storage plan,
which allocated space on a first-come,
first-served basis and allowed students to
store as much as space allowed at no
charge.
Whitney said the University had to
charge for storage due to a directive from
Vice Provost for Student Affairs Mary Ed
monds that any storage plan offered by
the University had to pay for itself.
The University paid for the program's
start-up costs up front, including adminis
tration, supplies, security and capital im-
