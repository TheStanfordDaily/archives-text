A new undergraduate major in comparative liter
ature was approved by the Faculty Senate yesterday.
The new major will contain two separate tracks,
each composed of two core courses plus 12 other
courses.
The Literary Studies track will require students to
be fluent in at least two foreign languages and will
focus on literary theory. The Interdisciplinary track

either the Interdisciplinary or Literary Studies track.

Comparative Literature 199, "Senior Seminar on
Literary Theory."

humanities with their concentrations noted. The
concentration in comparative literature has been of

On Aug. 31, however, the Humanities Honors
Program in comparative literature will be terminat
ed. The Comparative Literature Department will be
able to nominate students for bachelor's in compara

Any student currently working on a humanities
bachelor's with the comparative literature concen

desired, said Political Science Prof. David Brady,
chair of the Committee on Undergraduate Studies.
Several faculty members praised the new major.
English Prof. Ron Rebholz called the tracks "two ex
tremely well-defined, rigorous majors."
George Dekker, associate dean of graduate policy,

school students . . . who perhaps otherwise wouldn't
