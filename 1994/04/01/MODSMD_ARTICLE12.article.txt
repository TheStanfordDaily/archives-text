# Major change
## Comparative lit major created 
### Andy Dworkin Senior staff writer 
A new undergraduate major in comparative liter
ature was approved by the Faculty Senate yesterday.
The new major will contain two separate tracks,
each composed of two core courses plus 12 other
courses.
The Literary Studies track will require students to
be fluent in at least two foreign languages and will
focus on literary theory. The Interdisciplinary track
will require students to be fluent in at least one for
eign language and will focus on the intersections be
tween literature and another art or another academ
ic discipline.
Undergraduates will be able to do honors work in
either the Interdisciplinary or Literary Studies track.
The two core courses are Comparative Literature
101, an introduction to comparative literature, and
Comparative Literature 199, "Senior Seminar on
Literary Theory."
Currently, undergraduates can take comparative
literature as a concentration through Humanities
Special Programs, the same way that modern
thought and literature is offered. Under this system,
undergraduates are members of the Humanities
Honors Program and receive bachelor's degrees in
humanities with their concentrations noted. The
concentration in comparative literature has been of
fered since the 1970-71 academic year.
On Aug. 31, however, the Humanities Honors
Program in comparative literature will be terminat
ed. The Comparative Literature Department will be
able to nominate students for bachelor's in compara
tive literature starting Sept. 1.
Any student currently working on a humanities
bachelor's with the comparative literature concen
tration will be allowed to graduate with that degree if
desired, said Political Science Prof. David Brady,
chair of the Committee on Undergraduate Studies.
Several faculty members praised the new major.
English Prof. Ron Rebholz called the tracks "two ex
tremely well-defined, rigorous majors."
George Dekker, associate dean of graduate policy,
said he thinks the new mtyor "is actually going to
make the humanities more attractive to top high
school students . . . who perhaps otherwise wouldn't
Zapata.
"Both in and out of the Chi
cano community, we have been
stunned by the kind of affection
coming our way," she said. "To
have 150 students saying 'we will
miss you' is the greatest gift we
could have got."
Rice also praised Burciaga'a
contributions to Stanford and
said that "she's done a terrific
job."
Burciaga met with
Chicano/Latino students on
Wednesday night in a closed com
munity meeting to discuss her
layoff. Chicano/Latino student
leaders say they are planning to
respond to the layoff, but have
not decided what approach they
will take.
"We're not going to face this
lying down," said graduate stu
dent Ben Olguin. "Last quarter it
was the ethnic centers and now
they're sucker punching us by fir
ing Cecilia because she's been a
vocal advocate of our community."
Olguin pointed to the elimina
tion of the special assistant to the
president for Chicano affairs in
1991 as the first in a series of
recent blows to the Chicano/Lati
no community. Recently, the
University decision to distance
itself from labor disputes at Webb
Ranch, a migrant farm on Stan
ford land, has incensed some Chi
cano/Latino students and faculty.
"This is the last straw," he
said.
have applied here."
English Prof. John Bender esti
mated that a small number of stu
dents, about four or five, might
choose the Literary Studies track
each year, and a similar number
might elect to write honors theses
in the major. Once the program
gets established, Bender said he
hopes 20 to 25 people a year might
choose the Interdisciplinary track.
Currently between two and
seven people each year graduate
from the comparative literature
concentration in the humanities
program. Since it was created in
1987, the Comparative Literature
Department has wanted to offer an
undergraduate degree, but decided
to wait until the department was
well established.
Comparative literature is not
the first program to have moved
from a concentration in the
humanities honors program to a

full-fledged undergraduate major.
Majors such as religious studies
and American studies started out
as honors concentrations as well.

Also yesterday, the senate reau

Programs for four years, allowing

for bachelor's degrees in humani
ties for that span of time. The mod
ern thought and literature concen
tration will still be offered through
the humanities honors program.
