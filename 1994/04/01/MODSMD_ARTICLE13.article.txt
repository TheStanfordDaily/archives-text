# Budget cuts force Burciaga from job
## Popular RF, 20-year administrator to leave University at end of August 
### Rajiv Chandrasekaran Senior staff writer 
As Stanford's budget-cutting process
moves forward, another high-level admin
istrator has been given a pink slip.
This time it's Cecilia Burciaga, an asso
ciate dean of student affairs and a veteran
University employee, who was told last
week that her job will be eliminated by the
end of the summer.
Burciaga handles student affairs devel
opment activities and budget planners be
lieve her tasks can be consolidated more ef
ficiently under the Office of Development,
Provost Condoleezza Rice said.
But several students and staff members
are crying foul because Burciaga, Stan
ford's highest-ranking Chicana employee
and a resident fellow in Casa Zapata, has

not been offered another
job within the University.
"Cecilia has been here
for 20 years. You just
don't lay off someone like
that without creating an
other position," said se
nior Gabi Cervantes, a co
chair of MEChA, a Chi
cano/Latino student
«Ti. in ii

group. 'It seems like they just wanted to
get rid of her as soon as possible."
Burciaga has held several jobs in the
upper administration, first serving as an
assistant to the president for Chicano af
fairs and later becoming an assistant
provost for faculty affairs. She has also
been an associate dean of graduate studies


. Burciaga
and was the University affirma
tive action officer for a year.
In addition, she has been a vis
ible leader of the campus Chi
cano/Latino community and, at
times, a critic of University poli
cies.
With such varied experience,
some question why she was not
given another job. "It just seems
like the new administration can
not account for diverse opinions.
They don't want criticism. It real
ly seems like a definite political
move," Cervantes said.
But Rice said the move was
strictly budgetary. With $18 mil
lion to $20 million to trim from
Stanford's operating budget, con
solidating as many duties as pos
sible makes sense, Rice said.
"When you have to cut over $1
million of the budget (in Student
Affairs) it's very difficult," said
Vice Provost and Dean for Stu
dent Affairs Mary Edmonds. "We
have to look at who is in what
position and how we can reduce."
When dealing with senior-level
administrators the situation is
more difficult, Rice said, because
there are fewer commensurate
positions to offer a person who
has been laid off.
"I would have liked to see
some way to work this situation

out," she said, "but this Universi
ty is not in a period of any expan
sion at the top."
In fact, Burciaga said she pro
posed that her position be elimi
nated during budget-cutting dis
cussions several months ago.

cut over $1 million of
the budget (in Stu

position and how we
can reduce.'

"But since I hadn't heard any
thing, I didn't think the issue was
going to be discussed," she said.
"If such a move was going to be
considered, I had asked them to
discuss it with me."
Nevertheless, Burciaga said
she isn't bitter. She said she is
ready to move on and is currently
looking at positions at other col
leges and universities. This will
be the last year she and her hus
band, Tony, will be RFs in Casa
