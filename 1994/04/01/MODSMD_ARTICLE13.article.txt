As Stanford's budget-cutting process
moves forward, another high-level admin
istrator has been given a pink slip.
This time it's Cecilia Burciaga, an asso
ciate dean of student affairs and a veteran
University employee, who was told last
week that her job will be eliminated by the
end of the summer.
Burciaga handles student affairs devel
opment activities and budget planners be
lieve her tasks can be consolidated more ef
ficiently under the Office of Development,
Provost Condoleezza Rice said.
But several students and staff members
are crying foul because Burciaga, Stan
ford's highest-ranking Chicana employee
and a resident fellow in Casa Zapata, has

not been offered another
job within the University.
"Cecilia has been here
for 20 years. You just
don't lay off someone like
that without creating an
other position," said se
nior Gabi Cervantes, a co
chair of MEChA, a Chi
cano/Latino student
Â«Ti. in ii

group. 'It seems like they just wanted to
get rid of her as soon as possible."
Burciaga has held several jobs in the
upper administration, first serving as an
assistant to the president for Chicano af
fairs and later becoming an assistant
provost for faculty affairs. She has also
been an associate dean of graduate studies
