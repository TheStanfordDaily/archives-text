# Fac Sen absorbed by conflict-policy debate
## Software development is major sticking point 
### Colleen Krueger Staff writer 
In a debate characterized by hypotheti
cal dilemmas and scholarly musings, the
Faculty Senate yesterday addressed a pro
posed conflict of interest policy designed to
establish guidelines for faculty research, in
vestments and consulting.
The Faculty Policy on Conflict of Com
mitment and Interest could mean new reg
ulations governing faculty presence on
campus, invention patents and outside con
sulting, research and investment — if the
document becomes University policy.
Representing over two years of work by
the senate Committee on Research, the pol
icy contains several points which have pro
voked controversy across discipline lines.
In an attempt to avoid scatter-shot de

bate, Committee on Research Chair Craig
Heller and Senate Chair Pat Jones initiated
a point-by-point discussion of the policy's
11 provisions. Yesterday's meeting only
tackled five, and the discussion will resume
at the senate's April 14 meeting, after
which a vote will be taken on whether the
senate should recommend the University
adopt the document.
Comparing his committee to "a group of
Talmudic scholars," Heller, a professor of
biological sciences, said he believes "every
possible position has been vigorously,
sometimes heatedly discussed" in their
meetings.
The senate debated provisions asking
faculty members to maintain a significant
presence on campus, disclose any question-
able relationships with outside
companies or institutions, and
give the intellectual property
rights of many inventions to the
University.

This final
point — intellec
tual property
rights — proved
once again to be
the document's
most widely con
tested passage.
The clause
states that, in
cases where

inventions are developed with
more than an incidental use of
University resources, the owner
ship of that invention's patent is
automatically granted to Stan
ford.
Currently, Stanford is one of
only three schools in the country
without such a stipulation.
"The committee tried very
hard to create a conflict of inter
est policy without touching on
intellectual property rights,"
Heller said, "but it turns out
that these rights are at the very
core of the conflict of interest
debate.
A policy without mention of
intellectual property is merely
window dressing."
The current Stanford system
invites conflicts of interest,
Heller said. In common "mixed
funding" situations, an innova
tor is faced with the nearly

impossible task of deciding which
of multiple grants and gift mon
eys was being used at the
moment of invention — often
leading to an adversarial rela :
tionship with the University, he
said.
Nonetheless, the issue contin
ues to be needled by the compli
cated issue of software classifica
tion.
Electrical Engineering Prof.
Tony Siegman introduced a let
ter signed by 17 computer sci
ence faculty members opposing
the policy's treatment of comput
er software and urging "that a
fairer and more consistent treat
ment of creative products at
Stanford be adopted."
In keeping with academic tra
dition, a distinction is made
between technology and more
"scholarly" works — like books,
works of art and musical compo
sitions.
While "inventions" can be
patented by the University, it
cannot hold the rights to creative
endeavors.
Classifying software into one of
these two categories creates a
problem.
"The policy seems to me to be
terribly Gutenberg-centric," said
Vice Provost and Dean of Library
and Information Resources
Robert Street. "Saying that elec
tronic books are one thing and a
device is another just doesn't cut
it."
Calling the policy "retro,"
Mechanical Engineering Prof.
James Adams agreed it would
"seem to provide incentive for a
calculus professor to write a book

instead of designing interactive
software."
The University is not, howev
er, looking to acquire "course
ware that people want to handle

on tneir own,
said Katharine
Ku, director of
the Office of
Technology
Licensing.
Some faculty
members even
questioned the
academic tradi
tion that removes

protected educational expression
from the University's reach.
But Heller said that including
both patents and copyrights in
the policy would be entering dan
gerous waters. Issues of academ
ic freedom and liability prevent
such a move.
"We would be the only Univer
sity doing so," Heller said. "We'd
really be Neanderthals to the
rest of the world."
Moving beyond the issue of
intellectual property rights, Sieg
man suggested that the Universi
ty follow its own precedent and
"grandfather" the current facul
ty under existing policies.
"I wouldn't take that for
granted," said Provost Con
doleezza Rice. "I don't think
that's workable, especially in this
case."
Four other policy provisions
— governing faculty presence on
campus, limits on significant
outside positions, the dissemina
tion of scholarly information,
and use of University resources
— were also discussed.
