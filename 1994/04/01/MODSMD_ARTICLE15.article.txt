# 2,900 students offered a spot in Class of 1998
## Admits' stats closely resemble Class of '97

Stanford mailed 2,900 letters of ac
ceptance yesterday to the potential
class of 1998, and Dean of Undergrad
uate Admissions James Montoya is al
ready giving them a glowing recom
mendation.
"The stunning academic creden
tials and extracurricular achieve
ments of the admitted class reflect the
overall strength and quality of this
year's applicant pool," Montoya said
in a statement yesterday.
Nearly half the applicants with
straight "A" grades were rejected, and
more than half the accepted applicants
carried 4.0 averages.
"We'll be getting calls tomorrow,"

said Assoc. Dean of Admissions John
Bunnell. "When students who have
4.0 sand over 1,400 on the SAT get re
jected, people say, 'What more can I
do?'
"But you have to remember there
are many other fine schools and many
of these students have several fine op
tions," Bunnell said. "That's the only
way I can do this business."
The undergraduate admissions
committee accepted 60 more students
this year than it did last year, but the
applicant pool of 14,610 was an in
crease of more than 1,000 over last
year. Consequently, the acceptance
rate actually decreased by about 1 per
cent.
