# 2,900 students offered a spot in Class of 1998
## Admits' stats closely resemble Class of '97 
### Julie Tsai Staff writer 
Stanford mailed 2,900 letters of ac
ceptance yesterday to the potential
class of 1998, and Dean of Undergrad
uate Admissions James Montoya is al
ready giving them a glowing recom
mendation.
"The stunning academic creden
tials and extracurricular achieve
ments of the admitted class reflect the
overall strength and quality of this
year's applicant pool," Montoya said
in a statement yesterday.
Nearly half the applicants with
straight "A" grades were rejected, and
more than half the accepted applicants
carried 4.0 averages.
"We'll be getting calls tomorrow,"

said Assoc. Dean of Admissions John
Bunnell. "When students who have
4.0 sand over 1,400 on the SAT get re
jected, people say, 'What more can I
do?'
"But you have to remember there
are many other fine schools and many
of these students have several fine op
tions," Bunnell said. "That's the only
way I can do this business."
The undergraduate admissions
committee accepted 60 more students
this year than it did last year, but the
applicant pool of 14,610 was an in
crease of more than 1,000 over last
year. Consequently, the acceptance
rate actually decreased by about 1 per
cent.

Offers were mailed to students
in all 50 states and 48 foreign
countries. As usual, California
had the highest representation in
the admitted class — 37.7 per
cent — while Texas, New York,
Massachusetts, Illinois and
Washington followed. Women
make up 49.5 percent of the
admittees, a slight decrease over
last year. Minorities comprise
44.9 of the accepted students,
and international students rep
resent 5 percent of the admitted
class.
"What you can't see in these

statistics is the energy, the accom
plishment, and the joie de vivre of
these students," he added.
According to Bunnell, the
applicant pool increase was not
expected until 1995, since the
total number of graduating high
school seniors is this year is rela
tively low. However, he also noted
the applicant increase could be
due to the fact that students are
frequently applying to 10 to 12
schools as opposed to six to eight
schools as was common five years
ago, which gives them "more
schools to turn down."
While the applicant pool
increased, the percentage of
admitted African-American,
Native American and
Chicano/Latino students dropped

compared to last year. Most
noticeably, last year, 9.3 percent
of those admitted were African
American, this year, only 7.5 per
cent are. The decrease, Bunnell
said, is indicative of an overall
decrease in African-American
applicants.
"It's a concern, naturally —
it's the group everyone is target
ing," he said. "We worked very
hard to get well-qualified minori
ty students to apply, but we don't
have quotas. We do our best and
see how it shakes out.
"We've made our decisions,"
Bunnell continued. "Our atten
tion now is to the yield, which will
be directed at all 2,900, but we
also want to make sure our affir
mative action concerns are met."

Another cause for the drop in
minority students might be the
growing popularity of traditional
black colleges, he said.
"The competition is very keen,
and well-qualified minority stu
dents who applied other years
may not have applied this year,"
Bunnell added.
Bunnell said he was impressed
by the efficiency of the admissions
office, especially considering the
applicant increase and the limita
tions imposed by an environment
of budget cuts.
"It takes an extraordinary
effort. [For each applicants there
are 10 more documents to file," he
said.
The admissions staff had to do
some prioritizing of its own in the

face of increased demands and
limited resources. Areas affected
by the budget include publica
tions and less traveling time to
schools for the deans, he said.

"We had to change the way we
do things in terms of how we look
to the future," Bunnell said. "We
try to (concentrate! on the main
students. . . . Students are still
getting their day in court; there's
just fewer pairs of eyes looking at
each file."
Bunnell himself is a parent of a
Stanford applicant, waiting on
"pins and needles."
"This is the first time in 20
years that I haven't seen all the
admits on the list," he said with a
laugh. "It wouldn't be fair for me
to judge my child."
