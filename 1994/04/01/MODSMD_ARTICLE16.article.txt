# Off the court, men's hoops helps youths 'read to succeed'
## 
### Jo Marshall 
The Stanford men's basketball team may not have
reached the NCAA Final Four this season, but in the
eyes of students at five Santa Clara County schools,
they are still champions.
In an effort to address the growing problem of illit
eracy in the Bay Area, the team and Amdahl Corpora
tion — a Sunnyvale mainframe computer company
and one of the team's sponsors — have worked togeth
er to create a pilot motivational program called "Read
to Succeed."
"The program is designed to promote and reward
reading in Santa Clara County schools in order to in
crease literacy in the community," said Mark Albert
son, a Stanford graduate and manager of corporate re
lations at Amdahl.

Since the program began in January, players from
the team have been visiting the students in the schools
and talking to them about the value of a good educa
tion and the importance of reading.
"One of the responsibilities we have at Stanford is
to ti7 to put something back into the community and
we thought we could do this by helping these kids,"
said Mike Montgomery, the team's coach.
Following the discussion with the children, the bas
ketball players teach them some basketball drills in
order to recognize the students' efforts in the program.
Sophomore basketball player Darren Allaway said
when he visited a class of students at Ronald McNair
elementary school in East Palo Alto, the children's ini
tial reaction was to his height.
"They were really excited at us being there and were
very attentive to what we were saying about how read

ing would help them get into a university," Allaway
said. "They asked us how tall we were, how we learned
to read and what our goals were when we were their
age," he added.
Senior team member Jason Weaver said he believes
the program works because "kids get fed up of being
told what to do by crony old teachers and it's different
for them to see an athlete with some kid still left in
him."
Weaver works with students at John Muir Elemen
tary School in Cupertino. "I tried to be humorous and
told them how you have to read in real life. . . everyday
things like reading the cereal box," he said.
Joanne Palia, a teacher at John Muir, said she is
very enthusiastic about the program. "The program is
great because it concentrates on
the fact that in order to succeed in
life you need to read," she said.
Five schools from different
socioeconomic environments and
demographic locations were cho
sen for the pilot program, which
will run through the end of the
school year in June.
Participating teachers at each
of these schools were given com
plete responsibility for assigning
the reading lists and setting the
levels of achievement for their
students, Albertson said.
"Some kids read 20 books a
month at Jordan Middle School
in Palo Alto but at Ronald
McNair school in East Palo Alto,
if a kid reads one book a year it's
a big improvement, so it was
important that each school tai

lored it's own program," said
Earl Koberlein, administrative
assistant for the men's basketball
team.
Students reaching the first
level of achievement set by their
teachers were invited with their
parents and teachers to the Stan
ford/Arizona State basketball
game on Feb. 12 to celebrate their
accomplishment. Each student
was presented with a certificate of
achievement in a ceremony at
half-time.
"It was very important to
involve the parents as well as the
kids at the awards because if the
parents don't care the kids won't
care," Koberlein said.
Palia is very grateful to the bas
ketball players who visit her stu
dents because they "motivate the
class 100 percent. .. . Since the
players left the kids are either
reading or playing basketball at
lunch time," Palia said.
The players have received

many letters and pictures from
the children which are prominent
ly displayed in the team's locker
room, Koberlein said. Many of the
letters remark on the player's
height — "You're the tallest peo
ple I've ever seen," — and others
simply ask questions — "When
you were my age did you read
every day?"
With the end of the basketball
season, Albertson said the players
will not tutor again until next
year. But other sponsors of the
reading program will be organiz
ing events to encourage the chil
dren to keep reading, he said. For
example, the San Francisco
Giants have invited the children
to one of their games this sum
mer.
Koberlein said he hopes to keep
a flow of letters back and forth
between the players and the chil
dren in order to show the team's
continued interest in their reading
progress.

letters remark on the player's
height — "You're the tallest peo
ple I've ever seen," — and others
simply ask questions — "When
you were my age did you read
every day?"
With the end of the basketball
season, Albertson said the players
will not tutor again until next
year. But other sponsors of the
reading program will be organiz
ing events to encourage the chil
dren to keep reading, he said. For
example, the San Francisco
Giants have invited the children
to one of their games this sum
mer.
Koberlein said he hopes to keep
a flow of letters back and forth
between the players and the chil
dren in order to show the team's
continued interest in their reading
progress.
