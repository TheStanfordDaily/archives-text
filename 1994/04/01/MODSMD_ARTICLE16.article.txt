The Stanford men's basketball team may not have
reached the NCAA Final Four this season, but in the
eyes of students at five Santa Clara County schools,
they are still champions.
In an effort to address the growing problem of illit
eracy in the Bay Area, the team and Amdahl Corpora
tion — a Sunnyvale mainframe computer company
and one of the team's sponsors — have worked togeth
er to create a pilot motivational program called "Read
to Succeed."
"The program is designed to promote and reward
reading in Santa Clara County schools in order to in
crease literacy in the community," said Mark Albert

order to recognize the students' efforts in the program.
Sophomore basketball player Darren Allaway said

elementary school in East Palo Alto, the children's ini

very attentive to what we were saying about how read

ing would help them get into a university," Allaway
said. "They asked us how tall we were, how we learned
to read and what our goals were when we were their
age," he added.
Senior team member Jason Weaver said he believes
the program works because "kids get fed up of being
told what to do by crony old teachers and it's different
for them to see an athlete with some kid still left in
him."
Weaver works with students at John Muir Elemen
tary School in Cupertino. "I tried to be humorous and
told them how you have to read in real life. . . everyday
things like reading the cereal box," he said.
Joanne Palia, a teacher at John Muir, said she is
very enthusiastic about the program. "The program is
