### Burt Herman Editorial staff 
The U.S. Department of Education will give the
Stanford East Asia National Resource Center a
$377,819 grant to fund graduate student fellow
ships and campus educational activities, Congress
woman Anna Eshoo's office announced Wednes
day.
The center provides funds for advanced language
instruction, and acts as a clearinghouse on campus
for all departments that deal with East Asia, accord
ing to Susan Matisoff, the center's director.
The center, which applied for the grant last fall,
asks for this kind of major funding from the depart
ment every three years and has received a similar
grant since the 1970'5, Matisoff said.
"We have been fortunate in that we have gotten
these grants regularly," she said.
The grant funding is conditional on the fact that
approximately half must be used for foreign lan
guage and area study fellowships. The Center is allo
cating $182,162 for the funding of eight graduate

students during the academic year, with an addi
tional two in the summer, Matisoff said.
Of the remaining funds, $35,000 will be used by
the Alliance for Education in Global and Interna
tional Studies to hold a national conference in Wash
ington, D.C. for other groups that study other geo
graphical areas.
The total amount of the grant earmarked for on
campus programming is $13,650 lower than last
year, Matisoff said.
Other area studies departments at Stanford,
including Latin-American Studies and Russian and
Eastern European Studies, have also applied for a
similar grant from the federal agency but have not
yet been notified if they have been awarded money,
Matisoff said.
Matisoff does not believe that this additional
funding will affect budget-cutting decisions by the
Provost's Office, because of the fact that the center
has received similau grants in the past.
"We are basically continuing [programs] that
have happened in the past, but if we didn't have the
funding it wouldn't happen," Matisoff said.
