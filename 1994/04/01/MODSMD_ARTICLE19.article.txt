Economy grows
WASHINGTON (AP) - The econo
my's huge surge at the end of 1993 is not
likely to be duplicated this year,
economists said in viewing the govern
ment's latest figures on growth yester
day.
But analysts do not expect predictions
of moderate growth to steady the fear
and trembling in the stock market.
Wall Street shares, which have
declined about 9 percent in the past two
months, seesawed wildly yesterday
before finally making a small gain.
The Commerce Department reported
that the economy grew at a 7 percent
annual rate in the final three months of
1993, down slightly from the govern
ment's 7.5 percent estimate a month
ago.
Private economists and the Clinton
administration expect the Gross Domes
tic Product, the sum of all goods and ser
vices produced in the United States, to
rise at about a 3 percent to 4 percent rate
for the first half of this year.
"The economy went out of 1993 with a

whoosh, with all cylinders firing," said
Robert Dederick, chief economist for the
Northern Trust Co. in Chicago. "But in
the stock market, strength in the econo
my is now viewed as a negative."
Emergency state declared
PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) -
President F.W. de Klerk declared a state
of emergency and ordered the army into
the Zulu stronghold of Natal yesterday,
directly challenging the fiery Zulu leader
who opposes the upcoming all-race elec
tions.
De Klerk's move was aimed at stem
ming the violence in the province and
ensuring Natal residents could vote. But
it could result in a bloody showdown with
Zulu nationalist leader Mangosuthu
Buthelezi and his warriors.
Buthelezi, who also heads the Zulu
dominated Inkatha Freedom Party,
called the troop deployment an "inva
sion" of KwaZulu, the Zulus' self-gov
erned homeland within Natal. He said
the sight of South African soldiers would
only stoke his followers' wrath.
