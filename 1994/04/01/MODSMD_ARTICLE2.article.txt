# An inside job?
## Four in Police Dept. allegedly linked to bike theft ring 
### Bart Herman Editorial staff 
The Santa Clara County Sher
iff's office is investigating charges
that members of the Stanford Po
lice Department are operating a
bike theft ring that may be respon
sible for more than one-quarter of
bike thefts on campus in the past
year.
According to Sgt. Rick Arrata of
the sheriff s office, the four police
officers under investigation are
suspected of collusion in an elabo
rate scheme in which they used po
lice vehicles and uniforms to carry
out as many as 50 bikes, which
were then resold to a handful of
local bike shops.
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer denied knowledge of
any wrongdoing by his officers,
but added that "it's not as if

they're paid like
tenured faculty,
so I wouldn't be
surprised if it's
true."
Arrata said the
sheriff's office
has been tracking
the theft ring for
over a month, hir
ing some Stan-

ford students to come and go from
their residences at early hours of
the morning. The office confront
ed the four officers for the first
time last week, when students at
Arroyo, Stern, Bob and the Suites
helped investigators produce com
posite sketches that matched the
suspected officers.
The investigation is expected to
last until at least the end of this
month, Arrata said. However, he
added that it is unlikely stolen

bikes traced to the ring can be re
turned to students because the li
cense tags were removed.
According to Arrata, the best
way for students to deal with the
rash of thefts is to "lock your bikes
up snug at night.
"We believe that most of these
thefts were bicycles that were left
unlocked by students," he said,
though he admitted the sheriffs
office has no evidence to back up
the claim.
"I think it Bounds good," Arrata
said. "If we tell students the bikes
were unlocked, they are more like
ly to lock theirs in the future â€”
and that's the point, isn't it?"
Officials from the county chap
ter of the Better Business Bureau
are also looking into the possibili
ty that local used bike shops know-
