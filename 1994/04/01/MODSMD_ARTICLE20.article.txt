# Clinton approves education act
## Bill authorizes $647 million this year for education reforms 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Half a
decade after states began trying to
improve their public schools, they final
ly have some financial support from the
federal government.
President Clinton signed the Goals
2000 Educate America Act into law yes
terday and by July 1, the first $105 mil
lion will begin flowing to states that
apply for it.
"This is the beginning. It is the foun
dation. Today we can say America is
serious about education," Clinton said
just before signing the bill on the out
door basketball court of a San Diego ele
mentary school.
, The law requires participating states
to develop — but not implement — edu
cation reform plans that set voluntary
standards on curriculum, student per
formance and on the resources, materi
als and teacher preparation necessary
to ensure that all children have an
opportunity to learn.
The bill authorizes $647 million this
year for education reforms that move
toward that goal, including $400 million

in grants to states and local school agen
cies.
The Education Department promises
a "quick and simple application" pro
cess. "It's really inconceivable that any
state that applies won't get funds," said
Mike Cohen, a senior adviser to Educa
tion Secretary Richard Riley.
Among the things to be examined:
how the states plan on getting the
money to local school districts and indi
vidual schools.
States will have two years to com
plete their reform plans. "If we're con
vinced it's aimed at challenging stan
dards for all students, if the plan is real
ly comprehensive and it's a promising
one, we'll continue to provide funding,"
he said. They also will be allowed to
apply for waivers from federal regula
tions.
Cohen said virtually every state
already has begun to search for ways to
invigorate a public education system
judged by many to be failing. American
students consistently score behind their
European and Japanese counterparts in

math and science.
"Certainly you didn't want states sit
ting down and waiting for the bill to
pass," he said.
The impetus for the states was the
1989 education summit, where then-
President Bush and the nation's gover
nors adopted six national education
goals that would create benchmarks for
what children should be able to do in
English, math, science and other sub
jects. A national council will be created
to review the standards and make sure
they are rigorous.
Education has been traditionally left
to the states, and until the summit
there had been no formal attempt to
establish federal academic guidelines.
Thus, a fourth-grade curriculum might
vary dramatically from state to state,
even city to city within a state.
During debate on Capitol Hill, sever
al Republicans argued that Goals 2000
was in essence creating a national cur
riculum. But Democrats and moderate
Republicans stressed the standards
were all voluntary.
