## Editorials Finally, arbitration 
### 
AFTER A five-month delay,
an arbitrator has been cho
sen to hear both sides of the
housing dispute between the Unit
ed Stanford Workers and Webb
Ranch.
In 1991, the University offered
eight housing trailers, originally
from Manzanita Park, to anyone
who was willing to pay the moving
costs. The Webbs, who have leased
the 237-acre ranch from Stanford
since 1922, said they would pay;
the trailers now reside at the
ranch. The current dispute arose
when the USW claimed the Webbs
were illegally denying housing to
workers by allowing non-worker
occupancy of the trailers. The
USW now wants control over who
is able to live in the trailers.
Both sides in the dispute should
be commended for getting down to
business and attempting to resolve
this matter. Although even obtain
ing an arbitrator proved to be diffi

cult, past differences need to be
swept aside. The dispute has lin
gered on far too long, and too many
hours have been wasted with no
results.
The two parties involved should
go into the meeting with the atti
tude that this is the first step
toward an amicable relationship
between the Webbs and the USW. A
successful arbitration will show
both sides that there is a way to
improve what for so long has been a
hostile and distrustful relationship.
With University President Ger
hard Casper's recent statements
that Stanford must remove itself
from Webb Ranch affairs, the arbi
tration becomes all the more
important. The only people who
can improve the relations between
workers and management are the
Webbs and the USW.
Although the rest of us are just
bystanders, the Stanford commu
nity should be watching closely.
