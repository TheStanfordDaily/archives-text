# Getting more Axess
## 
### 
AT THE END of last quarter,
the Stanford Housing Cen
ter distributed a flier to stu
dents with "important informa
tion" on how Axess — the Univer
sity's computerized registration
system — was expanding.
For example, the Draw will be
on-line this spring, and students
will be able to choose their meal
plan for the upcoming year
through their Axess accounts. Stu
dents can already view informa
tion about their guaranteed hous
ing status and previous housing
assignments and meal plans.
Although these changes are
helpful, they fall short of the
potential Axess has for making
student life a whole lot easier.
For the foreseeable future, for
example, students will still have to
trek down to the Dining Service
office on Pampas Lane if they want
to change their meal plans mid
year. Adding that function to Axess

would seem logical after putting
housing and initial meal-plan
selections on-line — and shouldn't
be much more complicated.
Stanford should also look into
other on-line services that could save
money and make tasks easier. Stu
dents can already look up long dis
tance rates charged by Communica
tion Services over Folio — why not
set up a system that would let stu
dents view their phone bill on-line?
The ASSU has put the fee
refund system on-line, and voting
in this month's elections will be
done through personal e-mail
accounts. It is also worth noting
that the Stanford Federal Credit
Union is testing a system that —
when implemented — will give
members access to information
about their accounts via Folio.
Stanford administrators should
follow the lead of these organiza
tions by creatively taking advan
tage of Axess' huge potential.
