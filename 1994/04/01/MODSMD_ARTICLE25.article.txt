## Harumi Befu Asian American studies merits closer look 
### 
IN SPITE OF the fact that Asian-
American students have been press
ing the administration for an Asian
American Studies program since the
early 19705, and in spite of the fact that
24 percent of the undergraduate student
body is Asian-American, Stanford Uni
versity has not seen it fit to provide such
a program. After much pressure, the
School of Humanities and Sciences has
provided two faculty billets in this field,
which are currently held by Profs. Gor
don Chang and David Palumbo-Liu.
It is hardly a secret that Chang was
not given tenure last year, and that
Palumbo-Liu, dissatisfied with lack of
appropriate support, is actively seeking
jobs elsewhere. Two faculty persons do
not make a program to begin with, and
now we are faced with the prospect of los
ing at least one of the two.
H&S has made funds available to
bring in visiting professors to teach
courses in Asian American studies. While
visitors are useful additions, they are no
help in creating a coherent program with
continuity. H&S has also offered buy-out
time for faculty to teach courses in Asian
American studies. One of the two faculty
given this offer declined to take it up due
to other commitments. The other one is
willing, but this will add only one more
course, hardly enough to help make up a
program.
A comprehensive program in Asian
American studies needs to address Asian-
American contributions not only in histo

ry and literature, the areas of expertise of
the two faculty members, but in Ameri
can social and economic life as well. It
needs to address social and psychological
issues of prejudice, discrimination, pover
ty, immigration, gender, community
organization, inter-ethnic accommoda
tion and conflict, among others, keeping
in mind that "Asian American" is a catch
all category comprising numerous ethnic
groups, such as Chinese-, Japanese-,
Korean-, Philippine-, Vietnamese- and
Indian-Americans.
Asian-Americans' contributions to
American life, notably on the West Coast,
have been vast, and yet little appreciated.
We should not forget that Leland Stan
ford made much of his fortune through
railroad and that this fortune was made
possible with massive Chinese labor. (Yet
Stanford did tiot have much sympathy
for Chinese Americans.) When we read
about gold rush, we forget that without
the support of Chinese workers, gold
mining would have been difficult.
Japanese Americans were so successful
as truck farmers before World War II
that they became an object of jealousy
and prejudice, and whites saw it fit dur
ing the war to ship all and every single
one of them, citizens and aliens, out of
the West Coast without due process and
without proof of crime.
Postwar saw Philippine professionals
coming to America in large numbers, fol
lowed by Indochinese and Koreans, all of
whom have been making major contribu

tions to American, and in particular Cali
fornia life. So much so that the white
majority has bestowed upon Asian-Amer
icans the dubious distinction of "the
model minority," with the uncharitable
implication that blacks and Chicanos are
less than models to follow. Few Stanford
administrators, faculty, staff, and stu
dents know that there was a time when
Asian American students at Stanford
were not allowed in white dorms and had
to live in segregated housing.
The Stanford community is appalling
ly ignorant of the history and current sit
uation of Asian-Americans. An Asian
American Studies program will provide
an opportunity to educate this communi
ty. Indeed, Asian-Americans are an
"underrepresented group in its |H&S's)
teaching and research programs. ... By
introducing into the curriculum the con
cerns and perspectives of faculty and stu
dents from underrepresented groups, the
institution is at the same time providing
all students with opportunities to learn
about the plurality of perspectives that
make up American society," to quote
from H&S affirmative action plans (Dean
John Shoven's memo of Oct. 27, 1993).
These words probably give the best ratio
nale for developing an Asian American
Studies program at Stanford. Dean
Shoven, in fact, added, "I want to reaf
firm our unequivocal commitment to this
goal."
