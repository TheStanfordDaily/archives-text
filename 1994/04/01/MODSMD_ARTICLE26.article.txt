## ATO residents complain about facilities, bureaucracy 
### 
The residents of ato
have a small problem with its
showers. The short and skinny of
it is that not all of them work. In a
house of 57 (approximately half men and
half women) there are four showers for
each sex. Two of the men's showers
upstairs don't have hot water or can't be
used because water from one of them is
leaking into the women's shower below,
forming a two-foot hole in the ceiling of
the women's shower room.
Facilities has responded promptly to
our requests for help, but due to our
aging plumbing, our showers remain

cold and/or unusable. Therefore, the rea
sonable next step would seem to be to
contact that one specific University offi
cial in charge of our particular bathing
problem. It turns out, however, that
when it comes to "pertinent" University
officials, there's a gaggle of them.
It would seem like a good idea to
inform the Row's residence dean, but
then again, the director of housing and
dining services seems like the man to
talk to. But what about the manager of
housing and food service maintenance?
Wait a minute, the director of the
housing center sounds like he could

help. On the other hand, the person in
charge of housing major renovations
could do us right.
Whoa, three's a crowd! The under
graduate housing supervisor, the man
ager of student housing and the under
graduate housing manager? Who's who?
Our heads are spinning so fast perhaps
we should call the health and safety
coordinator to calm us down as well as
plug the hole in our ceiling.
Our point is merely that even though
we've received excellent responses from
the facilities staff, we're still left with
half the shower spaces available. While

this isn't the end of the world, it's also
not fair that we're paying a collective
rent of $60,135 to live in a house which
doesn't have and hasn't had full shower
ing services for the entire year.
We're confident that one of these nine
officials can help us out. Meanwhile, the
line of managers, supervisors and direc
tors looking at our case is as long as the
one in the bathroom. We eagerly await
their responses.
