# Bikers should be more aware of access ramps
## 
### 
While it's no secret that individuals
with disabilities have many obstacles to
overcome, few people imagine bicycles
to be among them. Yet, on any given
day at Meyer Library, it's common to
see a row of bikes blocking access to

wheelchair ramps. One assumes that
the bicyclists are unaware of the incon
venience they create, but it's hard to
see how any reasonably observant stu
dent can fail to notice a wheelchair
ramp when parking his or her bike
directly in front of it.
Despite coordinated campaigns to
issue "violation of freedom" citations
after moving offending bikes from
wheelchair pathways, students continue

to park their Schwinns without concern
for wheelchair users. Even extreme
measures such as tossing offending
bicycles into nearby bushes and trees
have failed to produce the desired
effect. Barring a radical shift in aware
ness, stronger steps appear to be neces
sary.
Beginning this quarter, members of
the Disability Resource Center staff will
explore new enforcement options,

including parking fines and zoning
markers. Of course, the easiest solution
for everyone would be: please, watch
what you're doing — don't park your
bike near wheelchair ramps. Wheelchair
users making trips to the library should
be lugging books, not bikes.
