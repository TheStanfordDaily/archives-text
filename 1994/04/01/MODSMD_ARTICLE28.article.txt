## Maternal words of wisdom from the Twilight Zone 
### 
This could not be happening. I
looked up from the crossword puz
zle I had been struggling with and
met the gaze of my mother across the
dinner table.
"I'm serious," she said. "I think it's
time you had sex."
I deflected her glance, looking around
the room instead to see just exactly
where and when Rod Serling was going
to make his appearance and give a plug
for Prozac.
Other people's mothers encourage
them to eat more cauliflower for regular
bowel movements. To wear Italian shoes
at all times to fend off ringworm epi
demics. To tastefully squat over public
toilets. To avoid the flagrant use of
expletives.
"Think about it. A year from now
you'll have a job and your own apart
ment and what are you going to say to a
guy you're dating? 4 1 don't do that' . . . ?
You'll sound like a jackass."
I stare at 29-Across, trying to remem
ber the German I took sophomore year,
attempting to melt into the pink-flow
ered pastel wallpaper of the dining
room. I recross my legs as I sit on the
same wobbly chair I have sat in since
the days when I took pride in being
small enough to crawl under the table to
get to my seat. I take a sip of Diet Coke

on a morning like thousands of morn
ings I had spent with my mom before.
"Jesus Christ, you're my mom," I
gasp, flipping my hair to cover my face.
"You were supposed to put the keys to
my chastity belt down the garbage dis
posal when I reached bitchdoin back in
high school."
I pray to the gods of telemarketing
for amnesty, begging for an Avon lady, a
Jehovah's witness, a stranger with an
explosive parasite needing the use of our
facilities — anything to change the
channel on this most distasteful of
mother-daughter morning shows.
"Your friends in high school were
such prudes. It was all I could do to
keep you from thinking members of the
male species were a one-way ticket to
hell," she reminds me, giggling to her
self.
I fast-forward through memories of
fogged-up windows in an aquamarine
Mustang which kept my 16-year-old
Romeo and I from seeing the view of
Orange County's finest strip malls
which he'd so carefully picked out.
I rifle through my options in a fren
zied panic, looking for a Menendez
defense.
Option A — the Our Lady of Delayed
Puberty angle: Ma, I didn't even get
breasts until college. I didn't know

what the male genitalia entailed until
some time after that. But now that I'm
informed, the very next time I see a
penis-bearer walking my way, I
promise to be a good daughter, hit him
over the head and drag him back to my
cave.
Option B — the reverse lateral: Oh
mother, I'm so sure. I figured you
wouldn't want the gory details about
late-night adventures in the Poli Sci
building. If there are any burning ques
tions you have, or any pointers you'd
like, don't hesitate to use me as a
resource.
Option C — the resume packer
approach: I can give you references,
names, dates and locations, if you insist.
Instead I wisely opt for Option D —
the bait and switch.
"How the heck am I supposed to
defend myself here? You're my mom.
You're not supposed to know these
things," I joke, calling upon emphatic
hand gestures and a Southern Califor
nia accent. Then I go for the fake: "It's
not that important. Who knows? If I did
do that sort of thing, not that I would
tell my mother about it anyway, I might
not be any good at it."
"Oh no," she grinned. "You've been
good at everything athletic you've ever
done. It's a lot of fun."

I see flaming white spots as I clamp
my eyelids shut to evict the image which
has sauntered through my fragile mind.
I wait for June Cleaver to climb out of
the oven in the kitchen with two oven
mitts covering up her lightening-quick
fists as she boxes my mom's ears while
chanting "Sinner."
Back off June, I can handle this one.
"My attention span doesn't allow for
relationships of over three months," I
protest. "Based on that fact alone, isn't
there a constitutional amendment that
obliges you, as my mother, to hope that
I haven't had sex? The whole white
wedding, vestal virgin thing, oh mater
nal figure on high?"
June takes the mitts off and climbs
back into the oven, figuring I can take
care of this one on my own. .
As a strapping young buck crosses
the patio to read the meter out back, my
mother and I divert our gazes from the
showdown at hand.
"You need a fling," she sighs, sipping
her coffee and redirecting her attack.
"Time to screw around and get it over
with."
I roar in agony as tiny Diet Coke bub
bles burn my nasal cavity, having been
caught mid-gulp.
"Maybe I should just go jump the
meter-guy. Damn, isn't there some

social service agency that monitors the
mothers of the world?" I laugh, moving
into the kitchen to salvage the wreckage
of my nose.
"My last time home before going out
to face the cold, cruel post-Stanford
world and this is the advice I get? No
clean-underwear-for-paramedics warn
ings. No get-a-job-you-bum threats. No
china-patterns-before-you-miss-your
prime lecture. Just 'it's time to have
sex'? "
"If it goes smoothly it can be an
unimportant aspect of a relationship,"
she says in a take-me-seriously-now
tone. "If it doesn't, it quickly becomes
the most crucial, agonizing aspect."
The mother goddess of Pacific Bell
skillfully distracts my mom, directing a
long-awaited call her way.
"Oh well," she shrugs, walking to
pick up the phone. "You've heard me
out."
I refocus my efforts on 31-Down,
puzzled by what my mother actually
thinks of me and unsure of what I will
do after our odd little talks are just a
blur in the past.
Look homeward, Angel.

pick up the phone. "You've heard me
out."
I refocus my efforts on 31-Down,
puzzled by what my mother actually
thinks of me and unsure of what I will
do after our odd little talks are just a
blur in the past.
Look homeward, Angel.

This could not be happening. I
looked up from the crossword puz
zle I had been struggling with and
met the gaze of my mother across the
dinner table.
"I'm serious," she said. "I think it's
time you had sex."
I deflected her glance, looking around
the room instead to see just exactly
where and when Rod Serling was going
to make his appearance and give a plug
for Prozac.
Other people's mothers encourage
them to eat more cauliflower for regular
bowel movements. To wear Italian shoes
at all times to fend off ringworm epi
demics. To tastefully squat over public
toilets. To avoid the flagrant use of
expletives.
"Think about it. A year from now
you'll have a job and your own apart
ment and what are you going to say to a
guy you're dating? 4 1 don't do that' . . . ?
You'll sound like a jackass."
I stare at 29-Across, trying to remem
ber the German I took sophomore year,
attempting to melt into the pink-flow
ered pastel wallpaper of the dining
room. I recross my legs as I sit on the
same wobbly chair I have sat in since
the days when I took pride in being
small enough to crawl under the table to
get to my seat. I take a sip of Diet Coke

on a morning like thousands of morn
ings I had spent with my mom before.
"Jesus Christ, you're my mom," I
gasp, flipping my hair to cover my face.
"You were supposed to put the keys to
my chastity belt down the garbage dis
posal when I reached bitchdoin back in
high school."
I pray to the gods of telemarketing
for amnesty, begging for an Avon lady, a
Jehovah's witness, a stranger with an
explosive parasite needing the use of our
facilities — anything to change the
channel on this most distasteful of
mother-daughter morning shows.
"Your friends in high school were
such prudes. It was all I could do to
keep you from thinking members of the
male species were a one-way ticket to
hell," she reminds me, giggling to her
self.
I fast-forward through memories of
fogged-up windows in an aquamarine
Mustang which kept my 16-year-old
Romeo and I from seeing the view of
Orange County's finest strip malls
which he'd so carefully picked out.
I rifle through my options in a fren
zied panic, looking for a Menendez
defense.
Option A — the Our Lady of Delayed
Puberty angle: Ma, I didn't even get
breasts until college. I didn't know

what the male genitalia entailed until
some time after that. But now that I'm
informed, the very next time I see a
penis-bearer walking my way, I
promise to be a good daughter, hit him
over the head and drag him back to my
cave.
Option B — the reverse lateral: Oh
mother, I'm so sure. I figured you
wouldn't want the gory details about
late-night adventures in the Poli Sci
building. If there are any burning ques
tions you have, or any pointers you'd
like, don't hesitate to use me as a
resource.
Option C — the resume packer
approach: I can give you references,
names, dates and locations, if you insist.
Instead I wisely opt for Option D —
the bait and switch.
"How the heck am I supposed to
defend myself here? You're my mom.
You're not supposed to know these
things," I joke, calling upon emphatic
hand gestures and a Southern Califor
nia accent. Then I go for the fake: "It's
not that important. Who knows? If I did
do that sort of thing, not that I would
tell my mother about it anyway, I might
not be any good at it."
"Oh no," she grinned. "You've been
good at everything athletic you've ever
done. It's a lot of fun."

I see flaming white spots as I clamp
my eyelids shut to evict the image which
has sauntered through my fragile mind.
I wait for June Cleaver to climb out of
the oven in the kitchen with two oven
mitts covering up her lightening-quick
fists as she boxes my mom's ears while
chanting "Sinner."
Back off June, I can handle this one.
"My attention span doesn't allow for
relationships of over three months," I
protest. "Based on that fact alone, isn't
there a constitutional amendment that
obliges you, as my mother, to hope that
I haven't had sex? The whole white
wedding, vestal virgin thing, oh mater
nal figure on high?"
June takes the mitts off and climbs
back into the oven, figuring I can take
care of this one on my own. .
As a strapping young buck crosses
the patio to read the meter out back, my
mother and I divert our gazes from the
showdown at hand.
"You need a fling," she sighs, sipping
her coffee and redirecting her attack.
"Time to screw around and get it over
with."
I roar in agony as tiny Diet Coke bub
bles burn my nasal cavity, having been
caught mid-gulp.
"Maybe I should just go jump the
meter-guy. Damn, isn't there some

social service agency that monitors the
mothers of the world?" I laugh, moving
into the kitchen to salvage the wreckage
of my nose.
"My last time home before going out
to face the cold, cruel post-Stanford
world and this is the advice I get? No
clean-underwear-for-paramedics warn
ings. No get-a-job-you-bum threats. No
china-patterns-before-you-miss-your
prime lecture. Just 'it's time to have
sex'? "
"If it goes smoothly it can be an
unimportant aspect of a relationship,"
she says in a take-me-seriously-now
tone. "If it doesn't, it quickly becomes
the most crucial, agonizing aspect."
The mother goddess of Pacific Bell
skillfully distracts my mom, directing a
long-awaited call her way.
"Oh well," she shrugs, walking to
pick up the phone. "You've heard me
out."
I refocus my efforts on 31-Down,
puzzled by what my mother actually
thinks of me and unsure of what I will
