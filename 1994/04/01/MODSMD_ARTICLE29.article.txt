## Hot Cardinal batters outsmack Bears 9-1 Bartels throws his first full game for Stanford 
### Andy Eiser Senior staff writer 
As two old sparring partners continue
their rivalry, drawing first blood takes on
ever-greater importance.
Such was the case yesterday, as the
Cardinal baseball team drew a 9-1 victory
from the California Golden Bears before
1,062 Sunken Diamond faithful fans in a
Pacific 10 Conference Southern Division
game that marked the clubs' 371st all
time meeting and the first this season.
In narrowing Cal's series edge to 194-
177, the Cardinal (19-13, 8-5 in the Six-
Pac) used a complete game on the mound
from sophomore Todd Bartels and a com
plete game on offense and defense from
junior first baseman Dusty Allen to retain
a share of second place in conference play.
Showing no signs of a strained lower
back that resulted from a cracked verte
brate and which kept him out of recent
action, Bartels went the distance for the
first time at Stanford in raising his record
to 4-2. While dropping his earned run
average by seven-tenths to a respectable
3.61, however, the right-hander showed
some rustiness before taking command of
the game down the stretch.
Bartels surrendered inning-opening
hits in each of the first three frames and,
in the third, spotted the Golden Bears
(17-21, 7-6) a 1-0 lead when junior center
fielder Eddie Comeaux singled and even
tually scored on a wild pitch.
"Early on, I didn't know what to do,
but I saw guys warming up behind me in
our bullpen and that got me fired up,"
Bartels said.

So fired up, in fact, that Bartels man
aged to retire 18 of the last 19 men he
faced, using a dazzling array of pitches
and yielding only a harmless single to Cal
freshman second baseman Dan Cey in the
last six innings.
"In the fourth inning, my two-seam
fastball came back and I felt I had com
mand of the hitters," Bartels said. "My
sliders were also effective in forcing them
to hit a lot of ground balls."
In all, 10 of the Golden Bears' final 18
outs came on grounders, many of which
featured errant Cardinal throws saved by
Allen with spectacular putouts.
"The job of a first baseman is to save
errors, and my teammates were having
off-days throwing, so I helped pick them
up," Allen said. "Fortunately, the ball was
going into my glove."
But no glove, unless it belonged to
someone on adjacent Maloney Field, could
have caught Allen's towering leadoff
home run in the fourth, which traveled
over the scoreboard in left and evened
matters at 1-1.
"I got a fastball over the plate and just
extended my arms and drove through it,"
Allen said of his fourth roundtripper of
the season. "There is no better feeling in
all of sports than hitting the ball 'on the
screws,' as they say."
With Stanford bats still slumbering to
the tune of just two hits to that point,
Allen's shot sparked the Cardinal's
knockout rally.

touched losing starter Rob
Stone (2-3) with a single to cen
ter and scored what would be
the game-winning run two outs
later on a sacrifice by sopho

Allen continued to impress
even Cey's father Ron, a former
major-leaguer who was in atten
dance, when his infield single
drove home junior second base
man Jed Hansen and tacked on
an insurance run for Stanford
in the fifth.
His impact having already
been felt, Allen played no part in
Cardinal three-run rallies in the
sixth and eighth, when Stanford
lit up Cal relievers Alex

Franklin and Matt Collar,
respectively.
But Bartels easily carried the
day, possibly lending some sta
bility to the revolving door at
the third spot in the Cardinal
rotation.
"He had that bad back and
then he was sick, and it was
good to have him back in
there," said head coach Mark
Marquess.
The 372 nd incarnation of
baseball's Big Game gets under
way this afternoon at 2:30 at
Evans Diamond in Berkeley,
with sophomore Dan Reed (5-2)
expected to go for Stanford and
freshman Keith Evans on the
hill for the Golden Bears. The
game may be heard live on
KZSU (90.1 FM), with Steven
Brown and Angelo Puglisi man
ning the mikes.
