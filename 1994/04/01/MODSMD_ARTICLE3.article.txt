# Salamander population exploding
## Conservation efforts have helped amphibians 'breed like rabbits' 
### Skip Schwortz Senior staff writer 
Due to the efforts of conservation biol
ogists, the endangered tiger salamanders
on campus are reproducing "like crazy."
The population of salamanders in the
Lagunita lakebed has more than tripled in
the last three months, said junior Ted Lee,
who has worked extensively with the crea
tures.
"It's really a miracle," Lee said. "We
can't exactly figure it out — all of a sud
den they just started breeding like rab
bits."
The tiger salamanders, which were
thought to be extinct frofn Northern Cali
fornia, were found to be living in the
foothills behind Stanford and the Laguni

ta lakebed. The discovery of the amphib
ians has delayed the construction of a
dorm on the Knoll and forced the cancella
tion of Big Game bonfire last year.
Biologists at the Center for Conserva
tion Biology, who have been charting the
rise and fall of the salamander population,
say that the amphibians may owe much of
their successful comeback to Lee's efforts
last winter.
"If he hadn't helped those 47 lizards
across the street that rainy night last Jan
uary, I don't know where we'd be," said
Mike Rigney of the Coyote Creek Riparian
Center, adding that the salamanders were
"lucky little critters."
Members of Stanford's Axe Committee
are discussing plans for a celebratory bon
fire to herald the return of the salaman

der. A replacement for the Big Game Bon
fire canceled earlier this year, the event
would again be held in Lagunita,
probably later this month.
"It doesn't matter that we lost the foot
ball game last November and no longer
have the Axe," said senior Steve Zika, the
head of Axe Committee. "We should wel
come the salamander back to campus with
open arms, and the committee feels that a
bonfire would be particularly symbolic."
The resurgence of the salamanders was
particularly surprising considering the
low amount of rainfall so far this year,
Rigney said. He said this makes him even
more optimistic about the salamander's
future.
"Who knows how many there'll be
