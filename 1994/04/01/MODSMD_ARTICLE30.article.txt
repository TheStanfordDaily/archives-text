# Men head off to face Hawaii

After Wednesday's four-game victory over No. 3
USC, Cardinal volleyball squad
knows that it alone can decide its fate in the final
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation standings.
Even if the Trojans manage to sweep their last
four matches, Stanford will continue to lead USC by
one game in the wins column. In order to preserve
that slim margin, the Cardinal will have to match the
Trojans win-for-win during the closing weeks of the
1994 campaign.
After spending an entire season in the Trojan's
shadow, Stanford is now more than ready to claim its
share of the title â€” starting with a tough two-match
road trip to Hawaii this weekend.
"Coming back from Hawaii with two wins would
be tremendous," said head coach Ruben Nieves.
"Most teams that go down there suffer from a vaca
tion mentality that draws them away from the game
and towards the sun, sand and surf."
That temptation, more than anything else, will
likely be the Cardinal's greatest nemesis this week
end. The unranked Rainbows (11-10 overall, 7-7 in
the MPSF) might not stack up to Stanford (12-7, 9-3)
in either talent or success this season, so in order to
win, Cardinal team members stress "just going out
and playing our game."
"We know we have the talent to beat this team,"
