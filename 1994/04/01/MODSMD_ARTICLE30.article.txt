# Men head off to face Hawaii
## 
### Kathryn Yang Staff writer 
After Wednesday's four-game victory over No. 3
USC, Cardinal volleyball squad
knows that it alone can decide its fate in the final
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation standings.
Even if the Trojans manage to sweep their last
four matches, Stanford will continue to lead USC by
one game in the wins column. In order to preserve
that slim margin, the Cardinal will have to match the
Trojans win-for-win during the closing weeks of the
1994 campaign.
After spending an entire season in the Trojan's
shadow, Stanford is now more than ready to claim its
share of the title — starting with a tough two-match
road trip to Hawaii this weekend.
"Coming back from Hawaii with two wins would
be tremendous," said head coach Ruben Nieves.
"Most teams that go down there suffer from a vaca
tion mentality that draws them away from the game
and towards the sun, sand and surf."
That temptation, more than anything else, will
likely be the Cardinal's greatest nemesis this week
end. The unranked Rainbows (11-10 overall, 7-7 in
the MPSF) might not stack up to Stanford (12-7, 9-3)
in either talent or success this season, so in order to
win, Cardinal team members stress "just going out
and playing our game."
"We know we have the talent to beat this team,"
said senior setter Canyon Ceman.
"It's just a matter of concentrating
on the task at hand and really going
to work on them."
Ceman, coming off'an exceptional
performance against the Trojans,
leads a group of spikers who have hit
.356 on the season — compared to
Hawaii's .305 hitting percentage.
Stanford is lead on offense by red
shirt freshman Matt Fuerbringer,
who has exploited his opposite hit
ting position for 769 kills on the
year. That, combined with a .395 hit
ting percentage, equates to a nation
al-high 7.21 kills per game.
Not far behind him is sophomore
outside hitter Mike Lambert, who
led all Cardinal attackers two nights
ago by swinging a cool .387 with 35
kills against the Trojans. On the sea
son, Lambert has compiled 739 kills
for a 6.0 kills per game average.
On the defensive end, freshman
Michael Hoefer has also shown
signs of brilliance this year with 84
total blocks — good for a ninth
place showing nationwide. Stan
ford has also improved upon its dig
ging as of late with 35 saves against
USC this week.
Nevertheless, one of the factors
that might hold the Cardinal back is
Hawaii's Klum Gym, which is almost
as much of a terror to play in as Stan
ford's own Burnham Pavilion.
"Like Burnham, Hawaii's gym is
small, it draws well and it gets
extremely noisy with all their fans,"
Nieves said. "In addition, it's hot
over there, so we really have to con
centrate to pull out two wins there."
If Wednesday's victory was any
indication of Stanford's concentra
tion skills, the Cardinal should
return home two victories closer to a
second consecutive MPSF crown.
