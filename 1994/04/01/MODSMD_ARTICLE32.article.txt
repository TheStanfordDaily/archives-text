# Tracksters to test their speed in SLO meet
## 
### Jorge Chen Staff writer 
"Slow" is a very misleading title for this weekend's
track and field meet, as the competition is bound to be
anything but that.
The Cardinal men's and women's teams travel to
Cal Poly San Luis Obispo tomorrow (the school's ini
tials serving as the origin of the misnomer) to face off
against seven teams, including Cal State-Los Angeles,
Fresno State and powerful Brigham Young.
"This will be one of those good old meets to com

pete for points," said Stanford head coach Vin Lanan
na. "However, the points will not come easy with
BYU."
After hosting the two-day Stanford Festival last
weekend, tomorrow's meet marks the Cardinal's
launch into the heart of its competition schedule.
"It is early in the season and this- in a great oppor
tunity for many of our athletes to experiment in
events they wouldn't normally compete in," Lananna
said. "It will be a flexible meet which is a good transi
tion for many who have just completed a highly emo
tional Stanford Invitational."

Standout performances for the Cardinal hist week
end included strong showings in the throwing events
as well as the women's relays and sprints. As Stanford
took first place in both the men's and women's ham
mer due to the efforts of junior Dave Popejoy and
senior Deb Templeton, Lananna expects the squad to
again boost Stanford. <
"We will do well on Saturday with the strong sup
port from our men's throwing squad and the women's
team," he said.
The women will be without one
of their fastest runners, senior
Louise Watson, as she will take the
time day of! to rest and prepare for
upcoming races.

In her absence, Stanford will
rely on junior co-captain Christy
Boyd, who placed second in the
400-meter hurdles last weekend
as a high scorer, as well as team
leader.
Even though the Cardinal's full
squad won't be on hand, Stanford
assistant coach Betsy Riccardi
shares Lananna's confidence in the

weekend outlook for the Stanford
women.
"The women's team is ready to
go and they will be filling the whole
field this weekend," she said. "We
have to and will be able to score a lot
of points."
In anticipation of the beginning
of their outdoor season, the athletes
have been increasing their workout

intensity. Freshman sprinter Jim
mie Johnson said the high level of
competition in this meet requires a
lot of preparation.
"Fresno State has many great
freshman sprinters and BYU has a
great team overall," he said.
"Everybody has been working very
hard for this meet â€” every week is
a contest."
