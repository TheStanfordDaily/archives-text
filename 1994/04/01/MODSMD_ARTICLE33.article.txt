# Struggling softball looks for spark at LMU
## 
### Randy Reback Staff writer 
If the Stanford softball team is look
ing for a squad of similar ability to
compete against, it need not look fur
ther than its next scheduled opponent.
The Cardinal will travel to Los Angeles
today to take on Loyola Marymount in
a four-game series.
The most obvious similarity
between the Cardinal and the Lions is
both teams' low winning percentages.
While the Cardinal (1-20) only recent

ly recorded its first victory, Loyola (4-
20) has also struggled this season. In
addition, each team gained a precious
victory by defeating the Santa Clara
Broncos.
Another trait shared by the two
squads is the leadership of new head
coaches this season. For the Cardinal,
coach Sandy Pearce has been given the
job of trying to improve a team which
managed only a single win last year
while playing in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence. Coach Steve Combs has likewise
taken over the helm for the Lions after

the team lost two-thirds of its games
last year.
Stanford and Loyola are also both
young clubs which have relatively few
experienced players. The Cardinal
does not have any senior players, and
only sophomore Toni Morengo and
juniors Caryn Okinaga and Karla
Starr returned from last year.
The Loyola roster includes a couple
of talented upperclassmen. Combs said
he regards senior co-captain Teresa
Conway as the club's best hitter, while
junior Judy Petit provides exceptional

defense in left field and may be the
club's best all-around player. With few
exceptions, however, fully developed
talent is scarce in the Loyola lineup.
Stanford and Loyola have each
learned one of sports' most important
lessons this season â€” it takes good
defense to win games. The Lions com
mitted a whopping 60 errors in their
first 20 games.
"Our pitching has been good
enough, but we're committing way too
many errors," Combs said. "Our
errors will often cause opponents
to have one big inning against us
that takes us out of the ball
game."
He may as well have been
describing the play of the Cardi
nal, which on average has allowed
more than two unearned runs to
score per game.
With the two teams alike in so
many ways, the doubleheaders
today and Saturday should result
in four close decisions.

The Cardinal has recently
come out on the short end of a
couple close games, with narrow
losses to Willamette in its last two
contests.
Fortunately for Stanford,
freshman pitcher Katie Beattie
has fully recovered from her
sprained thumb and will be back
in action.
"We're looking forward to
going to Loyola for a tough four
games," Pearce said.
Although the Cardinal play
ers may meet their match, their
toughest task may be to avoid
their own defensive errors
which all too often lead to their
defeat.
