# Struggling softball looks for spark at LMU

If the Stanford softball team is look
ing for a squad of similar ability to
compete against, it need not look fur
ther than its next scheduled opponent.
The Cardinal will travel to Los Angeles
today to take on Loyola Marymount in
a four-game series.
The most obvious similarity
between the Cardinal and the Lions is
both teams' low winning percentages.
While the Cardinal (1-20) only recent

ly recorded its first victory, Loyola (4-
20) has also struggled this season. In
addition, each team gained a precious
victory by defeating the Santa Clara
Broncos.
Another trait shared by the two
squads is the leadership of new head
coaches this season. For the Cardinal,
coach Sandy Pearce has been given the
job of trying to improve a team which
managed only a single win last year
while playing in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence. Coach Steve Combs has likewise
taken over the helm for the Lions after

the team lost two-thirds of its games
last year.
Stanford and Loyola are also both
young clubs which have relatively few
experienced players. The Cardinal
does not have any senior players, and
only sophomore Toni Morengo and
juniors Caryn Okinaga and Karla
Starr returned from last year.
The Loyola roster includes a couple
of talented upperclassmen. Combs said
he regards senior co-captain Teresa
Conway as the club's best hitter, while
junior Judy Petit provides exceptional

defense in left field and may be the
club's best all-around player. With few
exceptions, however, fully developed
talent is scarce in the Loyola lineup.
Stanford and Loyola have each
learned one of sports' most important
lessons this season â€” it takes good
defense to win games. The Lions com
mitted a whopping 60 errors in their
first 20 games.

enough, but we're committing way too
