# Gymnasts in hunt for MPSF title
## With threepeat visions, defending champs head south 
### Sam Wu Staff writer 
Three more strides and No. 3 will threepeat.
Stanford's two-time defending national champion
men's gymnastics team will take the first step
towards a third consecutive NCAA title today in the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Championships
in Albuquerque, N.M.
The Cardinal has set its sights beyond the regular

season meets all year long in
anticipation of its three post
season competitions — the
MPSF event, the NCAA West
ern Regional Championships,
and the NCAA National Cham
pionships. One might think,
therefore, the Cardinal is no
longer looking further down
the road.
One would be wrong, how
ever. In fact, Stanford once
again views its MPSF title bout
against UCLA, California,
Brigham Young, San Jose
State, UC-Santa Barbara, New
Mexico and Arizona State as a
minor obstacle along its march
to NCAAs.

"The [MPSFJ Championship is just another step
ping stone," said head coach Sadao Hamada. "We
don't have any close rivals. We're just worried about
hitting our routines for the NCAA championships
later."
Confident that the it will prevail this weekend,
the Cardinal will not make any significant changes
in routines or competitive style. It will rely on the
skills and strategies that have brought success for
the team all year long and attempt to post a score of
288 or better.
With the NCAA championships in mind, it will be

'Even without Jing-Wei,
we have a lot of experi
ence, that's the strength
of our team. We also have
great freshmen — I'm
confident in their abilities.
We should be able to
crush the other teams.'

important for Stanford to attain such heights today
so it is ready to duplicate the performance to capture
another national crown.
According to Hamada, accomplishing such an
objective will only require consistency in execution.
In the past, Stanford has garnered tallies as high as
285 points to down national powers such as then-
No. 6 Nebraska.
According to Hamada, the Cardinal could have
defeated its opponents more handily if only it did not

miss as many routines as it has
in previous outings.
"Our routines are basi
cally where they're going to
be for NCAAs," said junior
tri-captain Josh Stein. "It's
just a matter of being consis
tent."
To obtain some of that
ever-so-vital consistency,
Hamada has asked some of his
veteran talent to compete in
more events than usual. Senior
tri-captain Mark Booth will
compete in floor exercises for
only the second time this sea
son, and Stein will make his
second appearance of the year

on high bar.
"I like to use more experienced and consistent
gymnasts in important meets," Hamada said. "Mark
has a good chance of winning the all-around, and
Josh is excellent all-around, too. We can't use missed
routines anymore as excuses to get 285-286 instpnH
of 287-288."
Although junior standout Jing-Wei Liang will not
compete this weekend because of back pains, Stan
ford still feels that it will go unchallenged in the con
ference championships.
