# Too much is not enough: The long and short of enlarging your penis
## 
### Andy Dworkin 
Just a short drive from the Transamerica Pyramid,
in the shadow of Coit Tower, on the 19th floor of the
sky-scraping Citicorp Center, lies what may be the last
hope for the little man.
There, in an unassuming office, lies the place where
little dreams are made big and big dreams are made
huge: the Mens Institute Cosmetic Surgery.
Maybe you've read the ads in the San Francisco
Chronicle or another paper: "Men Only," "Dreams jQQ
Come True," "Most Patients will double in size,"
"Penile Enlargement... Penile Lengthening "
Mens Institute Cosmetic Surgery is the front group
for Dr. Melvyn Rosenstein, that physician of phalluses,
that medic of members, the dick doc — the man who
has doubled the size of more penises than anyone since
Bo Derek quit making movies.
Men of small stature and great courage can head
down to the institute themselves, because "Dr. Rosen
stein offers a FREE 20 MIN. CONSULTATION." So,
in true Woodward and Bernstein spirit, I scheduled a
consultation.
On my big day, I dressed small. I wort? Dockers, a
sweater my grandma gave me — even loafers. Every
thing about me screamed "small penis." I even wore a
Stanford cap.
I sat waiting excitedly for Dr. Melvyn Rosenstein to
come enlarge me, but he never showed. Instead, Todd

Brown — a balding man reminiscent of a used-car
salesman — came to consult with me.
To get down to the long and short of it, Todd said
the good doctor is a "board-certified urologist" who had
been letting out wee-wees for 15 years. He started on
men who had been in industrial accidents, men who
had been Bobbitted and men with "micropenia" — a
condition he described as "when a 25-year-old has the
penis of a 7-year-old" (where does he keep it, in ajar?).
Fortunately, about five years ago Dr. Rosenstein
decided that if he could make a long schlong for guys
who really needed it, he could do it for anybody.
"I'm small and I want to be average. I'm average
and I want to be big," Todd said. "I'm big and I want to
be huge."
God bless that man; I bet he didn't even think of the
extra money he'd make operating on perfectly normal
men.
The "totally natural" surgery is actually two differ
ent procedures — one for length, one for width. Both
surgeries take less than an hour under total anesthe
sia. You're walking again in an hour and a half, back to
work in a day, and back to "work" in three to four
weeks.
The surgery is performed in Los Angeles by Dr.
Melvyn Rosenstein himself; Todd Brown is only the
doctor's local penis pimp — selling off the front end,
you might say. The cost? $3,500 for one, $5,900 for
both, financing available.

I shifted in my chair, trying
to look as small-penised as possi
ble. The excitement was building.
He described the procedures.
The widening procedure
(the pump and dump) involves
shaving, then sucking some fat
from the area just above the base
of the penis. The doctor then
reverses the switch on the Dust
buster and shoots the fat under
the skin of your willie, plumping it
like some demonic Ballpark frank.
Dr. Melvyn Rosenstein can
increase my girth by 40 to 50 per
cent, Todd informed me, but he
won't make the body of the missile
any wider than the warhead: "We
don't change the head size, only the
shaft," Todd confided. Good to see
they have some ethical guidelines.
Todd could see my curiosity
was up, so he decided to push
ahead and tell how Dr. Melvyn
Rosenstein could make my penis
longer. Using scientific words like
"soft," Todd described how many
inches the priapic Albert
Schweitzer could add to my sin
pin.
Remember, this is an
increase in flaccid length.
Minimum increase: 1-1/4
inches. Average increase: 2-1/2

inches. A "lucky 20 percent" of
men: 3 inches or more. The most
penis ever added by Dr. Melvyn
Rosenstein: 3-3/4 inches. Flaccid
length.
"The guy's hung like a horse
now," Todd said.
But, you're wondering, how
does this translate into erect
length? Me too, so I asked.
Whatever the individual
patient's ratio of flaccid to erect
length is pre-op, that same ratio
holds post-op.
For our less experienced read
ers, the ratio might be around
2:1. Adding 3-3/4 inches while
"soft," then, could be like adding
7-1/2 inches to the tumescent
totem, or so I figure it.
Damn.
I figured Dr. Melvyn Rosen
stein was pulling my leg. Turns
out, that's exactly how the
surgery's done.
Using a pen capped with a lit
tle pink eraser that had been
shaped to resemble the head of a
penis, Todd demonstrated the

operation to me. Basically, he said, every man has a
penis within, a continuation of his "external penis."
OK so far, I thought, very spiritual sounding, very
Joseph Campbell on Bill Moyers.
What Dr. Melvyn Rosenstein does is cut the tendon
that currently holds the penis in place, pulls the "penis
within" out like some genital Punxsutawney Phil and
reattaches the membrane at the end.
No pain, no suction devices, no implants, no messy
creams, no magic Egyptian pyramid power. Just a sim
ple snip and six more weeks of winter.
And then, just when I thought the consultation
couldn't get any better, Todd said those seven magic
words: "Are your ready to see the pictures?"
What followed, as Todd opened up his little gray
binder, was a cavalcade of crotch shots 1 had hoped to
avoid by skipping Katchadourian's class. Like some
twisted Thigh Master ad, there was a series of five or six
"before and after" snapshots of shaved penises with lit
tle rulers by them — Melvy's Kids.
As 1 stared, Todd showed me the "before" pictures,
using terms like "small all his life" and "all the girls
laughed at him."
Then he displayed the after pictures, with com
ments like, "now all the old women are chasing him
around the nursing home." Really. I swear.
There was the snapshot of the man who had the
widening procedure only, where the "after" photo
looked like some tick engorged with blood, its small
head dwarfed by its swollen body. There was the dis
turbing "after" photo in which the man's penis quite
obviously had an S-curve. Todd swore that would go
away soon. These members looked larger, yes, but none
were that impressive.

Then he showed the last photo.
"This one speaks for itself," Todd said.
There, in the little binder, lay what appeared to be a
still from the National Geographic Speaal, "The Rut
ting of the Bull Moose." This man had been enlarged to
about six inches. Flaccid. Todd moved in to take a slice
of my business.
So, when can we get you signed up for?
I pictured myself, playing center for the basketball
team, singing bass for the Mendicants, editing for The
Daily. Sure I'd have to buy longer gloves and bigger
shoes. I'd have to wear a jock strap just to walk around
campus. No more Umbros. BFD.
I thought of the fine company the "new me" would
join. Men like John Dillinger and John Holmes — just
think where they are today. I couldn't wait for the day
that I scandalized my first Supreme Court nominee.
Sure, $5,900 was a quarter's tuition, but you forget
what you learn in your classes eventually. A big penis is
a joy forever.
But, on second thought, I figured that having a real
ly big deal might not be such a big deal after all. Ques
tions popped up in my mind. Why did these guys feel
the need to perform elective surgery on perfectly nor
mal men? Doesn't this just make average guys self-con
scious about their penis size, with psychologically dam
aging effects? Where can I buy a codpiece?
So, making noises about how expensive the operation
was, I told Todd I'd think about it and call him back and
walked out of the Mens Institute Cosmetic Surgery. I
certainty didn't need the big-to-huge treatment, and I
suspected most men who get it don't need it either. In
the end, I figured, if it ain't broke, don't fix it
After all, it takes a big man to have a small penis.
Not that I'd know.
