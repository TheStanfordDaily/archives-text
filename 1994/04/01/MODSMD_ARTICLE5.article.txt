## Applications for monetary compensation due Tuesday 
### Sarah Katz Romesh Ratnesar Editorial staff 
The Bookstore has settled with
the state Attorney General's of
fice, ending more than two years
of government investigation into
questionable compensation prac
tices, deputy Attorney General
John Schwartz announced yester
day.
As part of the settlement,
Bookstore officials said they have
agreed to refund each student
$47.80 for past overpricing. In
order to receive the payment, stu
dents must fill out an application
at the customer service window by
5 p.m. next Tuesday.
"The Bookstore still maintains
that the improprieties in this case
have been blown out of propor
tion," said Law Prof. Robert Weis
berg, the Bookstore's spokesper
son. "But all parties are happy

with the settlement."
In addition to the refund, the
Bookstore will be required to pay a
fine of $110,000 to the state and
will lower its prices until they are
commensurate with the average
cost among college bookstores na
tionwide, Schwartz said. The
store has already sold its vacation
home in Twaine Harte, Calif.
Weisberg said that the decision
to offer refunds is "testament to
the Bookstore's commitment to
fairness in its service to students."
The amount of the refund was
calculated using the average per
centage of profits from textbook
sales at bookstores around the
country.
"The Bookstore was turning
unheard-of profits," Schwartz
said. "While they were buying lux
ury sedans and vacation homes,
students were being taken to the
cleaners."
Students who fill out applica

tions will receive refund checks in
the mail by the end of April, Weis
bergsaid.
State investigators began their
scrutiny of the Bookstore in Feb
ruary 1992, shortly after The
Daily reported that the store was
furnishing employees with perks
unheard of in a college bookstore,
including automobiles and a vaca
tion home in the Sierras.
