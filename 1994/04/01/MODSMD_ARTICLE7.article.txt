# Small amount of plutonium missing at SLAC facilities
## Officials assure safety, but urge use of radiation badges 
### Mathew Gregory Editorial staff 
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center officials said
yesterday that scientists at the facility have "tem
porarily lost" a small amount of plutonium.
Two-tenths of a gram of the element, which is
highly radioactive, was transported to SLAC last
week from Los Alamos National Laboratory in New
Mexico. Before the move, SLAC officials had stressed
that adequate safety precautions — which included
a triple-walled safety container — would be used in
transporting the material.
Once the plutonium reached SLAC, however, ad
ministrators and scientists aren't sure exactly what
happened to the sample, according to Michael Rior
dan, assistant to SLAC director Burton Richter.
"It's simply not [in the container] anymore," said
Riordan. "The real mystery is that the container has
no signs of being tampered with."
Riordan stressed that the sample's small size — it
weighs less than a single paper clip — makes the
threat to the surrounding area minimal. However,

SLAC did enter a heightened level of alert after the
discovery yesterday, requiring all employees to don
radiation badges. In addition, several staff members
were seen checking the grounds for abnormal radia
tion levels with Geiger counters.
"Exposure to the sample may result in a few lost
hairs, but nothing too severe," said radiation special
ist Frank Lee of Fermi National Laboratory in
Batavia, 111.
In a statement, Richter downplayed the signifi
cance of the event. "In spite of this minor mishap, the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center still maintains
the highest level of safety possible," he said.
"We remain confident that the missing material
will be found and promptly returned," he added.
Scientists planned to use SLAC's Positron-Elec
tron Asymmetric Ring to bombard the sample with
intense X-Rays to see how radioactive materials bond
in solution. The eventual goal of the experiments is to
improve methods of storage of leftover nuclear waste
from power plants and weapons.
