# Playboy, Part II: 'Boys of the Pac 10'
## 
### Sara Katz Elise Wolfgrum Editorial staff 
Officials from Playboy announced
yesterday that Playgirl magazine will be
publishing a "Boys of the Pac 10" issue
this summer and will be coming to Stan
ford later this month to interview po
tential models.
"Our 'Girls of the Pac 10' issue last
year was so successful that we couldn't
pass up the opportunity to do this
issue," Playboy spokesman Bill Paige
said.
Paige said Playgirl officials will visit
Stanford during the week of April 18
and will hold open interviews "much in

the same format as the Playboy inter
views."
Men selected to appear in the maga
zine will receive between $100 and $500
depending on how much clothing they
shed for the photos.
Paige said Playgirl is prepared for,
but does not expect, protests like those
that occurred last May at Playboy's in
terview site.
For the most part, feedback from
women on campus has been positive. "I
believe in equal opportunities," said
junior Molly McMillen, adding that "if
all the guys on campus had the oppor
tunity to stare at their female class
mates in the nude, then I want the
same chance."

Some men were enthusiastic about
the idea. "Everyone always stares at
women, but I think it's time that men
got some of the attention too. Besides, I
could use the money," said sophomore
Angel Fierro.
Paige said that if this issue is suc
cessful, Stanford men who participate
in the photo shoot could have the oppor
tunity to advance in the world of model
ing.
"It's truly a wonderful chance. Most
people have forgotten that Fabio began
his career with us — this could shoot
some lucky student right into a new line
of work," he said.
