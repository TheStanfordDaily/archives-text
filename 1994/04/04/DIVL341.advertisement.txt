I Trading in the books for the back roads of Europe this summer? I
Ttavel the roadways in style in a brand-new 1994 Peugeot, direct from
the factory! For just $429, students 18 years and older can rent a Peugeot
106 four-door hatchback for two weeks. Split between four people, that's
just $ 107 per person! And when compared to the typical cost of a rail pass,
it's the most economical way to go where you want, when you
want—in Belgium, France, Germany, Holland, Italy, Luxembourg,
Portugal, Spain or the United Kingdom.
