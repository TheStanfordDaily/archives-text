# The 						last Draw
## Lottery now computerized 
### Linda Friedlieb Editorial staff 
Doing away with the tradition of standing in long
lines at Tresidder to pick a number out of a box, this
year's undergraduate housing lottery will be com
pletely computerized for the first time in its history.
The on-line system translates into cost savings for
the Housing Center, eliminating the need for dozens
of paid student volunteers to staff the Draw. But it
also means that students will not learn their group's
draw number until they receive their housing assign
ment May 25.
Students can enter the Draw starting April 25 on
any computer linked to the University network. They
can apply for summer and graduate housing assign
ments beginning April 16.
Once students submit their preferences, Housing
Center Director Bill Georges said,
a new computer program will ran
domly assign numbers to the
draw groups. Students will be
assigned to residences by the
same computer program used in
previous years.
Groups who wish to draw
together will need to select a
group name, according to
Georges, which they can enter in
the computer with their housing
application. The group name will
link the applications of individu
als within the group, including
those of overseas students.
With computerization also
comes the possibility of computer
errors. For example, the Axess
Housing Application Instructions
warn that it is imperative to type
carefully because "if you acciden
tally type an incorrect group

name and create a new group, you
will receive a different number"
in the Draw.
Although the computerization
will ultimately simplify the Draw
process, some students expressed
disappointment at the loss of tra
dition.
Junior Veronica Galindo said
the change is especially nerve
wracking because she will not
know her draw number through
out the housing process.
"I think that's awful because
you're kept in suspense for a
month," she said. "If you're guar
anteed, it makes a big difference if
you draw 100 or 2,000-some
thing."
The on-line Draw was sup
posed to be in place last year, but
was delayed because of limited
networking capabilities.
In addition to students on cam
pus, all students at Stanford,
Stanford-in-Washington and at
Hopkins Marine Station will be
able to submit housing applica

tions through Axess. Students
overseas will most likely have to
fill out paper cards, although
Georges said those campuses
should also shift to computerized
applications soon.
While undergraduates on the
Farm will still receive housing
application booklets, housing pri
orities will be entered directly
into the computer system by the
monitors at each residence,
Georges said.
Though the last day to submit
housing applications is May 11,
Georges caut ; oned students to
apply early to avoid lines in com
puter clusters and the possibility
of missing the deadline altogeth
er.
Housing assignments will be
available on May 25 at local resi
dence offices and at the Stanford
Housing Center, and they will be
available over Axess the next day.
Assignments should also be
accepted or refused through
Axess, Georges said.
