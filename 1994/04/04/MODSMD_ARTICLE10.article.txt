# No rain
## Lake to remain empty this year because of low rainfall 
### Shirley Park 
After a season of swimming, boating and wind
surfing, Lake Lagunita will once again be dry this
year, due to the fifth-least rainfall in the Santa Clara
Valley since 1962.
"We haven't had adequate recovery (from the
drought) to support filling the lake this year,"
explained Kathleen Cruise, manager of the Univer
sity's Utilities Division.
Normally rainfall totals are about 16 inches. Last
year, there were 18.5 inches, and this year there has
been only 9.5 inches of rain, Cruise commented.
Felt Lake, one of Lake Lagunita's sources, is only
two-thirds full, and other campus areas use water
from Felt Lake as well.
So personnel in the University Water and Utili
ties Department decided last month that the current
low level of Lake Felt could not support filling Lake
Lagunita as well as supplying water for campus irri
gation.
Irrigation water is needed for the golf course, ath

letic fields and other grassy areas. Felt Lake is the
source for this water from the spring until the fall,
when the rainy season begins again.
The only alternative this year would have been to
draw reserve water from campus wells to fill Lake
Lagunita. But filling the lake in this manner would
have been costly both in ecological and monetary
senses.
Cruise said the ecological factor influenced the
decision more.
"The cost wasn't the basis of the decision. We
looked more from an environmental standpoint. It
wouldn't have been smart to fill the lake when water
resources are so stretched," she stated.
It would have cost $55,000 to fill the lake, as well
as $15,000 per month to maintain the water level for
the three months until Commencement. The lake is
drained after Commencement.
Approximately 80 million gallons of water are
needed to fill the lake initially, and 20 millions gal
lons more are required each month to keep the lake
full.
