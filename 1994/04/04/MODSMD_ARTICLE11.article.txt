## Mandela wants fighting to end 
### 
PIETERSBURG, South Africa (AP) — Assailants
posing as policemen killed a family of ANC support
ers in Natal and Nelson Mandela warned yesterday
that it would take time for the state of emergency to
end the Zulu-ANC violence that threatens this
month's all-race elections.
Mandela, head of the African National Congress,
said he hoped a summit this week with President
F.W. de Klerk and Zulu leaders would dissipate ten
sion so the emergency measures could be lifted, and
Natal — which includes the volatile KwaZulu black
homeland — could participate in the first April 26-
28 voting.
A spokesman for de Klerk said the summit would
take place Friday. No other details were announced.
The attackers in Port Shepstone identified them
selves as policemen to enter a hut on Saturday night,
then hacked and stabbed nine people to death,
including a 5-month-old infant and two older chil
dren. The family was identified as ANC supporters,
police Lt. Col. Marzedt de Beer said.
The nine deaths in Port Shepstone, on Natal's
south coast, and at least nine other killings Saturday
and early yesterday brought the death toll in Natal
to 37 since de Klerk declared the state of emergency
Thursday, police said.
De Klerk, in conjunction with the multiracial
Transitional Executive Council helping run the
country until the vote, declared the state of emer
gency because of the escalating political violence.
In another incident yesterday, bullets fired from
an ANC-controlled area killed one woman and
injured another as they prayed Easter Sunday at a
cross set up in the streets of Bhambayi, near Dur
ban, de Beer said.
The attacks were part of the daily violence that
has wracked Natal, where the ANC and the Zulu
nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party have fought
since 1990.
