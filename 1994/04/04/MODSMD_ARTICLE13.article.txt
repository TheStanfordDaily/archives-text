Easter service disrupted
WASHINGTON (AP) — An AIDS protester shouting
from the balcony disrupted Easter Sunday church services
attended by President Bill Clinton, his wife and daughter
yesterday.
Two Secret Service agents sitting in a pew directly behind
the Clintons jumped to their feet and shielded the couple
after a man yelled, "Save your prayers for Bill Clinton!"

The disruption occurred about midway through the ser
vice at the Foundry United Methodist Church, breaking the
silence immediately following a reading from the New Tes
tament.
Clinton later said he was not bothered by the disruption.
The same protester interrupted a Clinton speech in Decem
ber, prompting the president to say then, "I'd rather that
man be in here screaming at me than having given up alto
gether."
