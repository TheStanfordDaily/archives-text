# Perry takes firm stance
## U.S. willing to risk provoking war with N. Korea 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The United
States is willing to risk provoking war to
stop North Korea's program to develop
nuclear weapons but "we're not on the
brink of crisis," Defense Secretary William
Perry said yesterday.
"We do not want and will not provoke a
war over this or any other issue in Korea,"
Perry said yesterday on NBC's "Meet the
Press." "But we will take a very firm stand
and strong actions. It's conceivable where
those actions might provoke the North
Koreans into unleashing a war, and that is a
risk that we're taking."
Perry said the CIA believes that North
Korea already has as many as two nuclear
bombs and is continuing to develop atomic
weapons.
"I know they're lying when they say
they're not developing a nuclear program,"
Perry said.
The United States and the United
Nations have been pressing North Korea to
allow international inspectors to examine
its nuclear sites. North Korea has given no
public indication that it is willing to do so.
In the meantime, the United States and
South Korea have postponed deciding on
whether to resume joint military exercises,
although Perry said both sides were dis

cussing a schedule yesterday.
The United States' primary concern is to
stop any further nuclear development in
North Korea, but not necessarily to try to
take away any nuclear weapons they now
have, Perry said.
"At such time as we succeed at that, then
we can be concerned about rolling back the
program they have," he said.
Until then, the United States will contin
ue to employ "imaginative and aggressive
diplomatic actions," according to Perry.
"We don't have to have results this week
or next week. The problems we're con
cerned about will take a year or two to
unfold, so we can be firm, but we can be
patient, too," he said.
However, Perry said if the situation
doesn't change in six months, the United
States would move "out of the diplomatic
mode and into the mode of putting pres
sures" on North Korea, including economic
sanctions.
Asked whether he would rule out a pre
emptive military strike against North Korea
under any circumstances, Perry said, "I
would not rule anything out or anything in."
But he was careful to say that he thinks
war is unlikely.
"This is not an imminent crisis," he said.
