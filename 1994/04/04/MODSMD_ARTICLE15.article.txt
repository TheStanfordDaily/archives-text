## Top Clinton aide says economy growing steadily

WASHINGTON (AP) - President Bill
Clinton's top economic aide urged
investors facing stock market turmoil to
keep their nerve steady and stay focused on
the fact that the economy is growing solid
ly with only moderate inflation.
"If I were a normal investor, one thing I
would absolutely not try to do is out-trade
or outguess the market. . . . Nobody knows
what the market's going to do day-to-day,"
Robert E. Rubin, director of the National
Economic Council, said yesterday.
Traders on Wall Street were bracing for
another topsy-turvy session today when
the stock market reopens after a three-day
Easter weekend. Shaken by fears of resur
gent inflation, the Dow Jones industrial
average has recorded two back-to-back
weeks of big declines and was down about 8

percent from its peak on Jan. 31.
A government economic report released
when the stock market was closed in
observance of Good Friday was expected to
cause more jitters when trading resumed
today.
"I think there's no doubt that the mar
ket's going to at least open on the down
side," said Chemical Bank economist Irwin
Kellner, who appeared on ABC-TV's "This
Week With David Brinkley."
Rubin, who also appeared on ABC,
acknowledged the market's recent behav
ior has been unpleasant and painful but
urged investors to ride it out.
"The key is to keep your balance and
keep your nerve steady and keep your eyes
on what you think is going to happen over
the long term," Rubin said.
