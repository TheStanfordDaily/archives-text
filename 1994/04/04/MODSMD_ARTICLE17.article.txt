SOME SOFT murmurs of stu
dent activism have lately
been heard on campus.
New student groups such as
Students Against Genocide
(SAGE) and vocal demonstrations
such as the one staged Friday to
protest the cutting of a high-level
administrator show that student
consciousness at Stanford is not
entirely brain-dead.
But the recent death of a former
student activist reminds us that
there is a lot more work to be done.
Sherifa Omade Edoga, a 1992
Stanford graduate, died March 12
of complications from heart
surgery. She was 23, not much
older than the seniors now getting
ready to fly the Cardinal coop.
It is always sad when we lose
someone so young and so recently
a part of the community. But
Edoga had distinguished herself
here as a campus activist, both

politically and socially. She is most
remembered for her part in the
anti-war movement during the
1991 Persian Gulf War. As one of
the leaders of Stanford Students
for Peace, Edoga inspired others to
speak out at rallies.
She was heavily involved in
many other aspects of Stanford,
including acting in a number of
plays and supporting minority
rights for the black, disabled and
gay communities.
Edoga used her time at Stanford
well and had a tangible impact on
many people. Perhaps she, more
than anyone of us, knew how valu
able her time here was.
Edoga provides an excellent
example of the necessity of campus
activism. At a time when more stu
dents are worried about succeed
ing in the "real world," it is easy to
lose sight of the importance of
fighting for one's beliefs.
