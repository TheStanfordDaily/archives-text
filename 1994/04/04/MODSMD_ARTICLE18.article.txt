# The
						price of storage

### 
SUMMER STORAGE is appar
ently coming back to campus
— but students might not be
very happy with the cost.
After a one-summer hiatus, stu
dents will be able to keep their
belongings over the summer at
three campus locations — Wilbur
Hall, Lagunita Court and the
Row's Lambda Nu — but will have
to pay for the privilege.
Costs could be steep: storage of a
"medium-size" box, for example,
will cost $5 while a "large" box will
cost $10. Computer storage will
cost $15, while odd-sized items —
like bicycles or skis — will cost $20
each. These boxes add up.
Some students maintain that
Stanford's service can cost more
than comparable — though less
convenient — off-campus storage
space shared by many students.
While it is certainly a relief that
on-campus storage is finally back,
the previous desperation and deter
mination to bring back summer

storage should not cloud students'
and housing administrators' judg
ment of fair and reasonable costs
for a formerly free service.
Housing officials should ensure
that storage doesn't become a prof
it-driven service simply because stu
dents would rather pay for on-cam
pus storage, than not have it at all.
According to Assoc. Director of
Housing and Dining Services
Rodger Whitney, the University is
now charging for storage to comply
with a directive that says any ser
vice will have to pay for itself.
The University has already
started to prepare for storage by
spending money on start-up costs
like administration and supplies.
As it moves ahead with summer
storage, though, it should be cau
tious to keep costs at a minimal
level each year — enough to oper
ate the service and nothing more —
so that the price does not drive stu
dents away from a service they
tried so hard to bring back.
