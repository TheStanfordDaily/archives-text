# Elders to speak at Med School
## Surgeon General to give commencement address 
### Nereyda Salinas 
U.S. Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders, widely
known for her controversial views on teenage preg
nancy and drug legalization, will deliver the com
mencement speech at the School of Medicine's convo
cation ceremony June 12.
But whether Elders will choose a controversial
topic for her speech is a mystery, according to Medical
School Dean David Korn.
"We never tell the speaker what to talk about. We
usually just get an address that is wonderfully spon
taneous," Korn said.
Fifth-year medical student Deirdre Pearl, howev
er, expressed hope that Elders would discuss some of
the provocative ideas for which she is known.
"Racism, sexism and homophobia are crucial
health issues," said Pearl, who is on the commence
ment committee. "We need to be talking about these
issues in medicine. . . . They are important to me and
also to many of the people in my
graduating class."
Elders became surgeon general
after an intense confirmation
debate in which conservatives said
they disapproved of her views on
topics such as anti-abortion
activists.
"They love little babies as long
as they're in someone else's
uterus, rather than caring about
children after they're born,"
Elders has said of the activists.
Korn said he finds Elders' can
dor "rather refreshing."
"She is a very prominent physi
cian, and happens to be a promi
nent woman physician, and hap

pens to be a prominent black
woman physician, so she's very
visible," Korn said. "She's also a
spokesperson for things that need
to be said by people in high places,
and that means she's controver
sial, just as [former Surgeon Gen
eral C. Everett! Koop was contro
versial."
Several students said they were
excited about Elders' speech.
Graduate student Allison Miyamo
to, for example, said she sees
Elders as someone "willing to be
the lightening rod and spur con
versation and debate on a number
of topics that need discussion."
The process of selecting Elders
began last August when the Medi
cal School's Office of the Registrar
sent nomination forms to all stu
dents and faculty asking who they
would like for a commencement

speaker.
The most popular names were
then ranked by the students,
according to Medical School Regis
trar Donna Daley, and the com
mencement committee agreed on
the top candidates. The committee
recommends a speaker to the
dean, who makes the final deci
sion.
Along with Elders, the top
names this year were first lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton, Secre
tary of Health and Human Ser
vices Donna Shalala and Director
of the National Institutes of
Health Harold Varmus.
"We're really lucky that [Elders
is] coming," said graduate student
Liz Kerr, who is on the selection
committee. "She's probably get
ting invited by a lot of other medi
cal schools."
