## The 						real first day of spring 
### 
TODAY IS the greatest day of the
year. Allow me to be a little more
specific. I don't mean April 4 in
particular is the greatest. I don't mean
the day after Easter and Passover is the
greatest. And I sure as heck don't want to
blow any "Free to be, you and me" drivel
in your face. But generally speaking, the
first Monday in April is the greatest day
in America.
First, you must realize that I am a
sports freak. You name the sport, I'll
watch it. You pick the game, I'll play it.
You buy the jock strap, I'll wear it — it's
that simple.
What is so special about today then?
It's opening day of baseball season.
Games will be played throughout the day
as baseball begins celebrating its 125 th
anniversary. Then tonight, the NCAA
basketball national champion is crowned.
If you're like me, the only part of your
body that is sore after a day like today is
your right thumb.
I suppose there are other great days.
Birthdays are rather cool. The day you
graduate is always nice. Of course, the
day (or night) on which you lose the v
word deserves moderate to heavy celebra
tion. But those are days of personal tri
umph, and while they're great individual
ly, they don't mean squat to the rest of
us.
Holidays can be considered great days
as well. Christmas is always special. Who
couldn't love a day that commemorates
the birth of our supposed savior by show

ering each other with gifts and "Beavis
and Butthead" television specials? Every
body loves New Year's because we can act
out our secret desire of kissing a total
stranger in a place like Times Square as if
we were the Quad or something. And
Groundhog Day just doesn't get the cred
it it deserves. What other day is replete
with rodent weather forecasts? I'm will
ing to bet that only the United States has
weather-telling fauna.
All of that whimsical holiday business
aside, I need to explain why things as
mundane as college basketball and major
league baseball make today so special.
College basketball is a truly Ameri
can winter sport mainly because it does
not involve snow. Fans cheer the ath
letes wildly. They make Norwegian
cross-country skiing fans look like
sleepwalkers. The emotional ties to
teams are so high; they are bonds that
last a lifetime. I guarantee that all you
undergrads will root for Stanford forev
er. If you are a graduate student from a
school other than Stanford, though, I'll
bet you root for your undergrad alma
mater more than you do the Cardinal.
That's cool. The same goes for your
favorite baseball team too, no matter
how badly they do.
But today is really important because
while one sport ends, the other begins.
It's seasonal in a way. Spring doesn't
begin on March 21, it begins today. Light
bulbs and hard floors make way for sun
shine and green grass. Fans lead a mass

exodus from basketball's arenas and
pavilions to places called The 'Stick, Fen
way Park and Camden Yards. Have you
ever had a Dodger Dog? I highly recom
mend them. Problem is, they can only be
had from the first Monday in April until
the first Sunday in October — depending
on how the Dodgers do, of course.
What's most important here are the
games. Both sports provide their own
special moments. In college basketball,
for every one of coach Bob Knight's tem
per tantrums there are coach Mike
Krzyzewski's personifications of sports
manship. He epitomizes college basket
ball.
Nearly 50 years after Jackie Robin
son's first game in Brooklyn, the most
important color in baseball is green —
and it's not the grass. Money has defi
nitely spoiled the game. But as James
Earl Jones' character says in "Field of
Dreams," "America has rolled by like an
army of steamrollers; and the one con
stant has been baseball." This day is also
an American constant.
Enjoy the games. Enjoy today. Spring
has officially begun.
