## Ethnic communities are not creating 'hostile camps' 
### 
FIRST, WE MUST say that we are
a bit puzzled by the comparison of
the ethnic communities at Stan
ford to the ongoing ethnic cleansing in
Yugoslavia ("Stanford should not
encourage balkanization on campus,"
Daily, March 30). If that were our goal
here, we would certainly seek employ
ment elsewhere. The major difference
between what one sees on campus and
the balkanization that leads to the eth
nic cleansing in Yugoslavia is the desire
of the Serbs, Moslems and Croats to
eliminate one another. That is clearly
not the case here at Stanford.
While we appreciate and respect
Prof. Wilfred Stone's desire to warn the
Stanford community of the potential
dangers of social stratification, we
believe he is overstating the case in
detrimental terms. Not only is social
interaction here a far cry from the
extremes of "ethnic cleansing," it does
not even resemble the results of a Jim
Crow South, imposed reservations,
exclusions laws and other historical
actions that isolated people in this
country.
Stone's objections about self-segrega
tion would have been more useful and
valid if he had been around for Ameri
can higher education's first 200 years,
when schools were almost all exclusive
ly white and male and America was
actually committing physical and cul
tural genocide toward selected groups.
That having been said, we have to
admit that Stone's image of a better
Stanford is a very attractive one, one
we are all working to make a reality.
We support his vision, and we are sure
we are not alone in the ethnic commu
nities in feeling that way. The question
is: how do we get there? Stone must
agree that neither minorities nor non
minorities have put our pasts behind us
yet, and we do not currently live togeth
er with the kind of harmony we should.
But the path he suggests seems to
assume that those who have suffered

"the dark side of American history" be
expected to forget history and to
assume that contemporary life is equal
and fair. We submit that would require
a leap of faith impossible for even the
most idealistic of us.
Let's imagine that there is another
path toward the unity that we both
desire so much, and it comes from
understanding and accepting our differ
ences. Perhaps we wouldn't be faced
with the horror of ethnic cleansing if
we all understood each other and
accepted each other more than we do.
Ethnic cleansing comes from our desire
to make everything the same, not from
our differences, and our differences
need not lead to hatred so long as there
is a desire to respect each other and not
impose our values and ideas on one
another. In fact, we have a suspicion
that true freedom exists only where dif
ferences are protected and accepted.
America, we believe, was designed to be
such a place.
We defend the differences on our
campus, even the differences we find in
the fraternities and sororities. We find
the assumption that they are unable
and unwilling to look beyond the shal
lowest of values a sad commentary on
our ability to achieve the very dream
Stone, and many of us, hold so dear.
If we cannot win our fraternity and
sorority colleagues (who are much more
like us than we probably realize) over to
a vision of tolerance and understand
ing, it is unlikely we could do it in the
face of real differences, anyway. The
beauty and the challenge of the Ameri
can system is that change depends on
our ability to persuade others to join
us, rather than relying on brute force
to create superficial agreement.
Ethnic minorities who congregate in
theme houses and Greeks who try to
qualify their membership have hardly
withdrawn from the community. All
groups find value and meaning in hav

ing moments of separation to affirm
core identities. If communities cannot
strengthen their cultural identities,
they would not have any unique bene
fits to share with others they encounter
here. Affirming and retaining these
core identities enable us all to be
enriched by cultural differences.
Stanford's social life can be more
accurately described as people living in
a large house. During the day we rub
shoulders in the "commons areas." The
classrooms are our study rooms; the
athletic fields are the backyard; the
research labs are our work room; the
dining halls are the dining room; the
performance halls are our living room;
and the bathrooms are shared by all
the residents. Retiring to the residence
halls that make up our bedrooms in
this house is hardly self-segregating or
balkanizing, especially when we have
roommates from different back
grounds.
We believe pluralism, culture of cul
tures and yes, even multiculturalism
should be the operative terms. Fur
thermore, we believe the University is
strong, firm and wise for providing
social structures that support cultural
identities. While it is valuable to sup
port all identity groups, it is crucial to
provide support for groups whose
social identities have been historically
suppressed so we can undo the dam
age.
Fortunately, University President
Gerhard Casper possesses the foresight
to support the social structures that
enable Stanford to balance the affirma
tion of identity with the building of
commonalty. His consistent articulation
of the differences between congregation
and segregation, the right to associate,
and Stanford's multitude of options in
curriculum and student life give us
hope rather than alarm.
We would argue that interactive plu
ralism is what multiculturalism and the

ethnic communities are about. We are
trying to encourage others to join us in
understanding and tolerating differ
ences. We are not creating "hostile
camps" as Stone suggests, and to prove
it we would like to invite him to dinner
sometime at Okada House, the Asian
American theme dorm.
Okada is a community of students,
many of whom are not Asian, and we
are trying to build an understanding of
multicultural issues by providing a
place where Asians can be themselves.
Students of a variety of races and eco
nomic classes do, indeed, "rub shoul
ders" here, and find they like one
another very much. And we doubt that
they think very seriously about wiping
each other out â€” except maybe on the
basketball court.
