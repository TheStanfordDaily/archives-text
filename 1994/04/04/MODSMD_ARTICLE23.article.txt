## Baseball sweeps 'Big Series' outscoring Golden Bears 24-6 Allen's longball, Middlebrook's pitching finish off Cal 
### Andy Eiser Senior staff writer 
The "California Killer" strikes again.
Dusty Allen, junior first baseman for
the Cardinal baseball team, continued
to terrorize California pitching Satur
day, crushing a first-inning homer and
driving in four runs as Stanford con
cluded a three-game sweep of the Gold
en Bears with an 8-1 victory at Sunken
Diamond.
In earning its first Pacific 10 Confer
ence Southern Division sweep of the
season, the Cardinal (21-13, 10-5 in the
Six-Pac) completed the first half of its
conference season locked in a second
place tie with Arizona State and 1-1/2
games back of USC, which Stanford vis
its in Los Angeles next weekend. Mean
while, Cal (17-23, 7-8), which had
entered the series even with the Cardi

nal, slipped to 4-1/2 games off the Tro
jans' pace.
"The key to the Six-Pac is to avoid
getting swept and to sweep somebody,"
Allen said.
After a silent 0-for-5 performance in
Friday's 7-4 Stanford victory at Evans
Diamond in Berkeley, Allen personally
unlocked Saturday's finale in his first
at-bat by pinning three unearned runs
on losing Golden Bears starter Matt
Toomey (2-1). Toomey retired the first
two Cardinal batters, but sophomore
catcher A.J. Hinch grounded a single to
left field. Senior designated hitter Nate
Olmstead followed with a potential
inning-ending ground ball that Cal
junior third baseman Justin Stark mis
handled for an error.
Stark's miscue opened the door for
Allen, who unloaded a 355-foot shot
over the scoreboard in left for his sec

ond homer of the series and sixth on the
season.
"It was a big pitch, a fastball up and
in the zone," Allen said.
Allen's blast grew bigger as Cardinal
freshman starter Jason Middlebrook
provided the "high-fives," improving
his record to 5-0 by scattering five hits
over five scoreless innings. Appropriate
ly, Middlebrook left with a five-run lead,
as Olmstead drove home single runs in
the third and fifth.
Olmstead then added a third RBI and
Allen his fourth as Stanford padded its
lead to 7-0 in the seventh inning.

limore led off the frame with a double
down the left-field line, and after junior
second baseman Jed Hansen sacrificed

three-game series, the senior pushed his batting average up to a lofty .392 for the year.
pitch, Olmstead stroked a single
up the middle for his second hit of
the afternoon.
Allen then spoiled a potential
Cal double play by beating the
relay to first, providing the back
half of what has become a danger
ous Cardinal one-two punch.
"Hitting is contagious, and
with Dusty doing so well behind
me, the pitchers are more defen
sive and I get more aggressive,"
Olmstead said.
Allen agreed, citing Olmstead's
torrid .392 average as evidence of
the tandem's effectiveness.
"Nate has a great bat, and that
works in my favor because he sees
better pitches," Allen said.
Freshman Tom Reimers nailed
down his fifth save, taming the
Golden Bears over the last four
innings and yielding just an
eighth-inning single to Cal fresh
man second baseman Dan Cey,
who came around to score and
avert the shutout.
Stanford tacked on the final
run of the game in the bottom of

the eighth on a solo homer to right
by Cale Carter, the third of the
year for the sophomore center
fielder.
Friday's game saw both teams
cross the Bay Bridge, but the out
come remained the same. The
Cardinal struck early and often,
scoring three runs in each of the
first two innings, and sealed the
road win with another great pitch
ing performance.
Olmstead keyed the first
inning rally with a two-run double
and scored Stanford's third run on
a Keith Evans wild pitch. Hansen
lit the fireworks in the second,
knocking a two-run homer off the
Recreational Sports Facility
behind the left-field fence.
Sophomore starter Dan Reed
gave up three runs on 13 hits in 7-
1/3 innings to improve to 5-2 for
the Cardinal.
Stanford faces its archrival
again in two weeks, but can take
new confidence into the remainder
of its schedule as a result of a
weekend of domination.
"It's the dream of every Stan
ford athlete to beat Cal," Olm
stead said. "This was a big week
end and it put us right where we
want to be."
