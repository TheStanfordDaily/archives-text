## Baseball sweeps 'Big Series' outscoring Golden Bears 24-6 Allen's longball, Middlebrook's pitching finish off Cal 
### Andy Eiser Senior staff writer 
The "California Killer" strikes again.
Dusty Allen, junior first baseman for
the Cardinal baseball team, continued
to terrorize California pitching Satur
day, crushing a first-inning homer and
driving in four runs as Stanford con
cluded a three-game sweep of the Gold
en Bears with an 8-1 victory at Sunken
Diamond.
In earning its first Pacific 10 Confer
ence Southern Division sweep of the
season, the Cardinal (21-13, 10-5 in the
Six-Pac) completed the first half of its
conference season locked in a second
place tie with Arizona State and 1-1/2
games back of USC, which Stanford vis
its in Los Angeles next weekend. Mean
while, Cal (17-23, 7-8), which had
entered the series even with the Cardi

nal, slipped to 4-1/2 games off the Tro
jans' pace.
"The key to the Six-Pac is to avoid
getting swept and to sweep somebody,"
Allen said.
After a silent 0-for-5 performance in
Friday's 7-4 Stanford victory at Evans
Diamond in Berkeley, Allen personally
unlocked Saturday's finale in his first
at-bat by pinning three unearned runs
on losing Golden Bears starter Matt
Toomey (2-1). Toomey retired the first
two Cardinal batters, but sophomore
catcher A.J. Hinch grounded a single to
left field. Senior designated hitter Nate
Olmstead followed with a potential
inning-ending ground ball that Cal
junior third baseman Justin Stark mis
handled for an error.
Stark's miscue opened the door for
Allen, who unloaded a 355-foot shot
over the scoreboard in left for his sec

ond homer of the series and sixth on the
season.
"It was a big pitch, a fastball up and
in the zone," Allen said.
Allen's blast grew bigger as Cardinal
freshman starter Jason Middlebrook
provided the "high-fives," improving
his record to 5-0 by scattering five hits
over five scoreless innings. Appropriate
ly, Middlebrook left with a five-run lead,
as Olmstead drove home single runs in
the third and fifth.
Olmstead then added a third RBI and
Allen his fourth as Stanford padded its
lead to 7-0 in the seventh inning.
Sophomore third baseman Brian Dal
limore led off the frame with a double
down the left-field line, and after junior
second baseman Jed Hansen sacrificed
and Hinch was hit by a Bobby Kahlon

three-game series, the senior pushed his batting average up to a lofty .392 for the year.
