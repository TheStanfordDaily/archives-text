Rickey Henderson and Lou
Brock would be proud.
In sweeping the three-game
"Big Series" with Cal, the Stanford
baseball team dominated the battle
of the basepaths, running all over
Golden Bear catchers Cody
McCormick and Reed Aljian while
successfully stealing 12 of 15 bases.
Going into the series, both the
Cardinal and Golden Bears had
been fairly successful stealing
bases during the season, with Stan
ford successful on 54 of 68
attempts (a .794 percentage) and

Cal swiping 64 of 87 bases.
"We needed to put a lot of pres
sure on Cal, and we made them
make the defensive plays," said
Cardinal catcher A.J. Hinch.
"We've got a lot of guys that can
run on the team. We've got good
team speed — no blazers, but a lot
of guys with above average speed
and if we get put into a position
where we can steal some bases then
we'll be successful."

eight errors in the three-game
series, compared to only one for
Stanford. In addition, Cal pitchers
failed to hold the Cardinal baserun
ners, feeding Stanford's aggressive
running game.
"[Stanford's] team speed is very
good," said Cal coach Bob Milano.
"When pitchers don't hold runners
real well, it makes your team speed
better."
All weekend, Stanford seemed
to make up for a lack of hits with
aggressive baserunning and execu
tion of the fundamentals, getting
four sacrifice bunts and three sac
rifice flies in the series.
"Our hitting has been up and
down, but the one thing we're try
ing to stay constant in is execut

ing," said centerfielder Cale
Carter. "Sometimes, you're going
to be able to crush the ball and beat
people by a lot of runs. Other
times, you have to manufacture
runs. With our speed, we try to
make the defense play a little in,
and get a few more base hits."
Sophomore third baseman
Brian Dallimore, the Cardinal lead
off hitter, said he believes aggres
siveness on the basepaths can
make run-scoring very simple for
Stanford.
"Any time you can take an extra
base by stealing it, that takes a lot
of pressure off us having to get hits
all the time, because you have a
couple of facets of your offensive
game." Dallimore said. "You can
either show up and get a lot of hits
that day or show up and get a cou
ple of hits, and play station-to-sta
tion baseball by stealing bases or
bunting guys over. It helps a lot."
