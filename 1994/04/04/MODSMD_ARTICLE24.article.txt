In sweeping the three-game
"Big Series" with Cal, the Stanford
baseball team dominated the battle
of the basepaths, running all over
Golden Bear catchers Cody
McCormick and Reed Aljian while
successfully stealing 12 of 15 bases.
Going into the series, both the
Cardinal and Golden Bears had
been fairly successful stealing
bases during the season, with Stan
ford successful on 54 of 68
attempts (a .794 percentage) and

Cal swiping 64 of 87 bases.

Cardinal catcher A.J. Hinch.
"We've got a lot of guys that can
run on the team. We've got good
team speed — no blazers, but a lot
of guys with above average speed
and if we get put into a position
where we can steal some bases then
we'll be successful."

the key defensive plays necessary to
cut down the aggressive Cardinal,
