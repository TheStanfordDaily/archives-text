After pulling off a tremendous upset against the
third-ranked USC Trojans last week, the Stanford
volleyball squad slipped back to square one on Friday
with a heartbreaking loss to Hawaii in a 14-16, 15-3,
15-12, 15-7 no-contest.
Despite that unexpected defeat at the hands of the
Rainbows, the Cardinal managed to salvage some
thing from the road-trip with a slim 9-15, 15-8, 17-
15, 5-15, 15-9 victory in a rematch with Hawaii on
Saturday.
Nevertheless, it will be the first match, and not
the second, which determines Stanford's fate in the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation standings. Cur
rently, the Cardinal is back in second place by merit
of two losses in the division, compared to USC's sin
gle blemish.
"It was a tough series because we had to rebound
from the emotional high after beating USC," said
head coach Ruben Nieves. "Also, it was the first time
our young team has been to Hawaii, and competing
in their homecourt was really hard."
Playing in a noisy and crowded Klum Gym,
Hawaii took full advantage of its homecourt advan
tage by running Stanford ragged in the first game.
Both teams had exceptional attacks on offense, with
the Rainbows swinging for a cool .522 and Stanford
following with a .492 hitting percentage. However,
when the dust settled, the Cardinal barely scraped by
with a 16-14 margin.
After that emotional first game, Stanford
appeared to suffer a let-down as it dragged its feet
through a 15-3 drudging before coming back and giv
ing the Rainbows a valiant, but losing, 15-12 fight in
the third game. Then Hawaii closed the door on its
fifth-ranked opponents with a 15-7 fourth game.
The Rainbows' opposite hitter Nikolas Berger cat
alyzed Hawaii's upset with 27 kills against only five
errors for a season-high .595 hitting percentage. Not
far behind him was Sven Hesse, who came off the
bench and put in his two cents with five aces and 16
kills for a .478 average.
The Cardinal attackers fared less well, with the
squad's leading hitter, sophomore Matt Fuerbringer,
racking in 29 kills for a .327 hitting percentage.
Sophomore outside hitter Mike Lambert did not fare
much better with 29 kills and a sub-par .254 showing.
Those numbers improved tremendously during
the second contest, however, with Fuerbringer tally
ing a career-high 51 kills for an astronomical .519
average. That, however, was not enough, as the Car
dinal struggled early and often during the see-saw
match.
It finally took the play of freshmen Stewart Chong
and Aaron Garcia to provide the spark in the Cardi
nal attack. Chong and Garcia replaced Stanford's two
veteran seniors, Canyon Ceman and Joe Burghardt,
at the setting and passing positions respectively.
"We put in Stewart and Aaron, and they really sta
bilized our attack," Nieves said. "But after a little
breather, Canyon and Joe went back in and won the
fifth game for us."
"Overall, we destroyed ourselves by losing on the
first day, but we came back with a great team victory
on the second day," said junior Brian Garrett. "It was
probably our best team match of the entire year."
