# Gymnasts fall to UCLA, finish second at MPSF

Stanford forgot that stepping stones may some
times be slippery.
Indeed, the two-time defending national champi
on Cardinal men's gymnastics team entered last
weekend's Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
Championships in Albuquerque, N.M., eyeing the
conference crown as a mere step toward its ultimate
end — a threepeat at the NCAA Championships in
Lincoln, Neb., in two weeks.
However, the Cardinal discovered that UCLA pro
vided very precarious footing, as the Bruins edged
Stanford 284.25 to 283.25. Host New Mexico and
California finished three and four points behind the
Cardinal, respectively, with 280.35 and 279.6 point
tallies. Other squads such as Brigham Young, San
Jose State and UC-Santa Barbara trailed the fourth
place Golden Bears by at least 11 points.
While the shortcoming will not prevent the Cardi

nal from competing at the NCAA Western Regional
Championships next week in Colorado Springs,
Colo., it came as a shock since Stanford had ousted
UCLA twice in the regular season.
"We just blew it," said head coach Sadao Hamada.
"We were well prepared but had a really bad day. My
top three guys had their worst meets of the season on
the same day."
In terms of individual exercises, Stanford won
floor and parallel bars, captured second place on high
bar and vault and finished third on the pommel horse
and rings. However, the Bruins captured first place
in three of six events — the still rings, vault and high
bar. And where UCLA did not finish first, it came in
second (in floor and pommel horse) and, at worst,
third (on parallel bars).
Echoing his coach's sentiments, senior tri-captain
Chris Sey believed that the Cardinal would have cap
tured more events if not for a lack concentration on
the part of its veteran talent.
"The older guys didn't come through because we

had a lot on our minds," Sey said. "It was our last
[MPSFI meet and Sadao had set us up — me, (junior
tri-captain) Josh Stein and (senior tri-captain) Mark
Booth — to win all-arounds since we had already beat
UCLA twice. We started thinking about all-arounds
and doing the best for our team, and the NCAAs were
ingrained in our minds."
On the other hand, Hamada, Sey and Stein agreed
that the Cardinal's less experienced gymnasts per
formed well.
"The young guys came through," Sey said. "With
Evan Wells for example, it was his first time in post
season competition, and he did very well for us. He
had a great ring routine."
In fact, Wells, a junior, led Stanford on the ring
event, earning a 9.75. His contribution allowed the
Cardinal to post a 47.25 out of 50 on rings, the
squad's season-best score on the apparatus. Wells
also added a 9.60 on floor to help his team secure top
honors in that exercise.
Stanford's three freshman
standouts also provided highlights
of their own. Jamie Ellis contribut
ed a 9.65 and 9.60 on parallel bars
and high bar respectively, Keith
Wiley posted scores of 9.75 and 9.65
on high bar and floor, respectively,
and lan Bachrach earned a 9.60 on
floor.
"Speaking about myself, I was
too relaxed and not intense about
my routines," Stein said. "I never
stopped to get intense. For the
freshmen, it was the biggest meet
they'd been to, and that turned out
to have a good effect."
According to Hamada, the
absence of junior all-around per
former Jing-Wei Liang due to back
pains was another factor which may
have brought about lower team
scoring. As he assessed it, not having
Liang in the Cardinal lineup made a
critical psychological difference.
"Missing Jing-Wei puts different
people in different lineups," Sey
said. "That's puts pressure on those
gymnasts. Before, they knew that
Jing-Wei was the clutch player, but
now, they were the clutch players."
Despite all that happened, how
ever, Stanford is confident that it
will show its true character at the
NCAA Western Regionals.
"All we have to do is step up our
intensity," Stein said. "We just have
to treat every routine like its the
NCAA finals."
