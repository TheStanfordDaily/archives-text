So it won't be that easy after all.
The Stanford men's tennis team split a pair of dual
matches last weekend with the visiting southern Cali
fornia schools, beating UCLA 5-2 on Friday and losing
to USC 4-3 on Saturday.
Stanford (16-1, ranked No. 1 nationally before the
weekend matches), is now tied with the Trojans (15-1,
No. 7) for the Pacific 10 Conference lead with half its
conference matches to go.
Against the No. 8 Bruins (12-3), Stanford looked
masterful early. At first doubles, senior All-Americans
Chris Cocotos and Michael Flanagan beat the No. 11-
ranked tandem of Sebastien Leßlanc and Eric Lin by a
score of 8-5. Not to be outdone, senior All-American
Vimal Patel and sophomore Jeff Salzenstein downed
UCLA's second doubles team, Robert Janecek and Eric
Taino, 8-4.
But perhaps the most impressive win in doubles
came on court three, where the Cardinal duo of senior
Bobby Devens and freshman Grant Elliott smashed
Bruins Heath Montgomery and Rae Cho by a com
manding score of 8-1. The three matches gave Stanford
the doubles point.
"I was pleased with the doubles play," said head
coach Dick Gould. "To win all three matches is a great
achievement."
Stanford didn't let up from there. Moving into sin
gles, the Cardinal scored four quick wins. At second
singles, Salzenstein topped Leßlanc, the powerfully
lanky and highly regarded Canadian Davis Cup player,
in a second set tiebreaker, 6-4, 7-6. Following suit,
Patel came back to beat Bruin freshman Loren Peters
in three sets, 3-6, 6-3, 6-2.
Cocotos broke Montgomery to win the second set
and the match at fifth singles, 7-5, 7-6. And at sixth sin-
