# Men's tennis struggles against top-ranked teams
## After beating UCLA 5-2, netters lose to Trojans 
### Mike Langford Senior staff writer 
So it won't be that easy after all.
The Stanford men's tennis team split a pair of dual
matches last weekend with the visiting southern Cali
fornia schools, beating UCLA 5-2 on Friday and losing
to USC 4-3 on Saturday.
Stanford (16-1, ranked No. 1 nationally before the
weekend matches), is now tied with the Trojans (15-1,
No. 7) for the Pacific 10 Conference lead with half its
conference matches to go.
Against the No. 8 Bruins (12-3), Stanford looked
masterful early. At first doubles, senior All-Americans
Chris Cocotos and Michael Flanagan beat the No. 11-
ranked tandem of Sebastien Leßlanc and Eric Lin by a
score of 8-5. Not to be outdone, senior All-American
Vimal Patel and sophomore Jeff Salzenstein downed
UCLA's second doubles team, Robert Janecek and Eric
Taino, 8-4.
But perhaps the most impressive win in doubles
came on court three, where the Cardinal duo of senior
Bobby Devens and freshman Grant Elliott smashed
Bruins Heath Montgomery and Rae Cho by a com
manding score of 8-1. The three matches gave Stanford
the doubles point.
"I was pleased with the doubles play," said head
coach Dick Gould. "To win all three matches is a great
achievement."
Stanford didn't let up from there. Moving into sin
gles, the Cardinal scored four quick wins. At second
singles, Salzenstein topped Leßlanc, the powerfully
lanky and highly regarded Canadian Davis Cup player,
in a second set tiebreaker, 6-4, 7-6. Following suit,
Patel came back to beat Bruin freshman Loren Peters
in three sets, 3-6, 6-3, 6-2.
Cocotos broke Montgomery to win the second set
and the match at fifth singles, 7-5, 7-6. And at sixth sin-

gles, Cardinal sophomore Jim
Thomas finished strong against
UCLA's Lin, 3-6, 6-3, 6-2.
Conversely, Flanagan started
out on fire against Janecek at first
singles, taking the first set 6-0. But
Janecek seemed to regroup, took
advantage of some Flanagan mis
takes, and began to perform like the
fourth-ranked player that he is,
winning the last two sets and the
match by a score of 0-6, 6-2, 6-4. At
third singles, Devens also lost in a
close three-setter to the freshman
Taino, 7-6, 5-7, 4-6.
"We beat a good team in UCLA,"
Gould said. "They are young and
will improve as they go along. We'll
have to play even better if we are to
beat them down there (in Los Ange

les, later this season)."
USC turned out to be a much
more formidable foe. The Trojans
sent a message loud and clear that
they were not to be taken lightly
when they won all three doubles
matches to start the day. Both
Cocotos-Flanagan and Patel-
Salzenstein lost in tie-breakers, 9-8,
although both Cardinal teams were
up a service break in their matches.
At third doubles, Devens-Elliott
looked like complete opposites to
their dominating selves of the day
before, dropping their match 8-4.
With the doubles point in hand,
USC needed only to split in singles
to win the match. And that's exactly
what happened, although assuredly
not in the way that they expected.
With arguably the best one-two
punch in the country, the Trojans
lost the top two singles matches.
Flanagan never let up against his
opponent, No. 2-ranked Wayne

Black, beating him 7-6, 6-4. Salzen
stein similarly finished off a week
end of absolutely tremendous play,
beating No. 11-ranked Jon Leach 6-
3, 3-6, 6-4.
However, Stanford's depth,
which many consider its strongest
aspect, did not come through against
the powerful Trojans. Brett Hansen
dominated Devens at third singles,
6-3, 6-2, and Adam Peterson
devoured Cocotos at fifth singles by
the same score. After a seesaw bat
tle, Patel also fell, losing to Lukas
Hovorka at fourth singles, 6-4, 1-6,
6-2. Consistent performer Thomas
beat Chad Rosser at sixth singles 4-
6, 6-3, 6-2, after the match was
already decided.
"USC is playing championship
tennis," Gould said. "We look for
ward to seeing them again down
there."
Stanford will visit both teams in
Los Angeles in two weeks.

UCLA's Lin, 3-6, 6-3, 6-2.
Conversely, Flanagan started
out on fire against Janecek at first
singles, taking the first set 6-0. But
Janecek seemed to regroup, took
advantage of some Flanagan mis
takes, and began to perform like the
fourth-ranked player that he is,
winning the last two sets and the
match by a score of 0-6, 6-2, 6-4. At
third singles, Devens also lost in a
close three-setter to the freshman
Taino, 7-6, 5-7, 4-6.
"We beat a good team in UCLA,"
Gould said. "They are young and
will improve as they go along. We'll
have to play even better if we are to
beat them down there (in Los Ange

les, later this season)."
USC turned out to be a much
more formidable foe. The Trojans
sent a message loud and clear that
they were not to be taken lightly
when they won all three doubles
matches to start the day. Both
Cocotos-Flanagan and Patel-
Salzenstein lost in tie-breakers, 9-8,
although both Cardinal teams were
up a service break in their matches.
At third doubles, Devens-Elliott
looked like complete opposites to
their dominating selves of the day
before, dropping their match 8-4.
With the doubles point in hand,
USC needed only to split in singles
to win the match. And that's exactly
what happened, although assuredly
not in the way that they expected.
With arguably the best one-two
punch in the country, the Trojans
lost the top two singles matches.
Flanagan never let up against his
opponent, No. 2-ranked Wayne

Black, beating him 7-6, 6-4. Salzen
stein similarly finished off a week
end of absolutely tremendous play,
beating No. 11-ranked Jon Leach 6-
3, 3-6, 6-4.
However, Stanford's depth,
which many consider its strongest
aspect, did not come through against
the powerful Trojans. Brett Hansen
dominated Devens at third singles,
6-3, 6-2, and Adam Peterson
devoured Cocotos at fifth singles by
the same score. After a seesaw bat
tle, Patel also fell, losing to Lukas
Hovorka at fourth singles, 6-4, 1-6,
6-2. Consistent performer Thomas
beat Chad Rosser at sixth singles 4-
6, 6-3, 6-2, after the match was
already decided.
"USC is playing championship
tennis," Gould said. "We look for
ward to seeing them again down
there."
Stanford will visit both teams in
Los Angeles in two weeks.
