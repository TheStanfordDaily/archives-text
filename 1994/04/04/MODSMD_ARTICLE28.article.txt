# Tennis nets best and worst of season
## Freshman De Silva runs her singles record to 19-0 in dual matches 
### Rob Ross Senior staff writer 
Reports of the demise of women's
tennis team have been greatly exaggerated.
The Stanford squad found that out last Fri
day in Westwood, where the 12th-ranked Bru
ins (13-4) surprised the No. 3 Cardinal (17-2) 5-
4. Stanford recouped the next day and walloped
No. 20 USC (8-9) 6-0.
"Recouped" may be too moderate a term.
Two weeks ago USC upset UCLA. Strangely
enough, last weekend in singles, Stanford lost
eight sets to the Bruins, while against the Tro
jans, the same lineup dropped only one.
"We followed our worst match of the year
with our best match of the year," said Stanford
coach Frank Brennan, trying to explain his
squad's Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde performance.
His number one singles player, Laxmi
Poruri, noted that UCLA fielded a weaker line
up in its surprising loss to USC and after her
weekend's experience concluded without reser
vation that "UCLA is much better than USC.
"But," she continued, "there is no reason we
should have lost that match."
If her teammates had had the same results as
Poruri did on the court, they would not have been

defeated. Poruri, the second-ranked player in the
nation, faltered slightly in the beginning of her
match against the Bruins' Keri Phebus, falling
behind 5-1. But, by not panicking and playing
smarter, she fought off a couple set points and
swept the next 12 games, winning 7-5, 6-0.
In doubles the senior captain teamed with
freshman Katie Schlukebir to knock ofT the
13th-ranked UCLA duo of Phebus/Susie Star
rett 1-6, 6-2, 7-6.
At singles, the highly touted freshman did
not fare as well. In the No. 3 singles position
UCLA's Diana Spadea notched up a 6-3, 3-6, 6-
1 victory over the higher-ranked Schlukebir.
"Katie played her worst match of the sea
son," Brennan said.
Results from her teammates were equally
discouraging. UCLA is not known for its depth,
but still won at both No. 4 and No. 5 singles.
Starrett emerged victorious from a three-setter
over Cardinal sophomore Kim Shasby in the
No. 4 slot and Bruin Jenny Hilt, relying on a
powerful first serve, squeezed by a tight and
inconsistent Beth Berris 6-4, 6-3 at No. 5.
The only bright spots in singles for Stanford
besides Poruri's play were senior Kristine
Kurth and freshman Sandra De Silva. Kurth
lost to UCLA's Jane Chi 6-3, 3-6, 7-6 but had

several match points against the eighth-ranked
player and pleased Brennan with a "good fight."
De Silva won at No. 6 singles, adding to her
now 19-0 dual-match record. The freshman has
been so impressive this season that Brennan
now considers her "a lock" at that lineup
anchoring slot.
The Cardinal was more successful in dou
bles, but the rise in play level came too late.
Matching the No. 1 team's success, the No. 3
Stanford team of Shasby and freshman Emily
Burt stomped Spadea-Anicia Mendez 6-2, 6-2.
But the No. 2 team continued to struggle, losing
6-4, 6-4 to Hilt-Chi.
Brennan and many team members attribut
ed Friday's loss to a combination of complacen
cy and tightness.
"We were not very intense," Brennan said.
"Perhaps we took them too lightly."
Poruri agreed. "We were tight due to under
rating them. We expected it to be easy and it
wasn't, so we tightened up."
Against USC it was easy. The Cardinal came
out on fire and won all six of the first sets. Five
victorious second sets were soon to follow, with
Shasby's three-set 6-3, 6-1, 7-6 victory the only
close match. Doubles play was canceled after
Stanford clinched the victory in singles.
