# Protesters debate Casper in Quad
## 
### Linda Friedlieb Editorial staff 
In a spontaneous and emotion
ally charged encounter, about 30
students confronted University
President Gerhard Casper in the
Quad Friday and accused him of
lacking a commitment to minority
issues.
For more than an hour, stu
dents debated a defensive Casper
over issues ranging from support
for minority graduate students to
the layofT of high-ranking Chicana
administrator, Cecilia Burciaga.
The protesters charged Casper
with ignoring student voices.
But Casper suggested that stu
dents were blaming him for trends
not unique to Stanford and prob
lems that existed long before he
took office.
The conflict began when a
number of students, many of
whom were Latinos, brought their
protest to the Quad from Branner
Hall, where they had gathered in a
combination welcome and protest
for visiting prospective minority
graduate students. In the Quad,
they circled the academic build

ings clapping and repeating slo
gans to attract attention.
According to doctoral student
Francisca James Hernandez, the
group "just happened to run across
President Casper." But Casper said
in an interview later that he was
walking down the arcade when he
saw the students demonstrating and
"turned around and engaged them."
Many members of the group car
ried a yellow flier detailing what
they see as historical proof of the
administration's lack of responsive
ness on minority issues. Students
read parts of the flier aloud to
Casper and other students who
joined a growing crowd.
The flier covered such diverse
topics as the United Stanford Work
ers union, potential budget cuts to
campus ethnic centers and the small
number of minority faculty mem
bers.
In several instances, Casper
denied the charge that his adminis
tration makes decisions without stu
dent input.
"In a university, not everyone
has their way," he said. "You are
being listened to. You are certainly
being listened to by me. Some deci
sions are not to your liking. Not all
decisions can be to your liking."
"Are we going to get our way

sometimes?" one student yelled in
response to Casper's statements.
Junior Jake Dorman echoed this
sentiment. "The largest question is
whether students have a voice in
decisions From day one in this
(budget) process, students haven't
been explicitly involved."
"But they have," Casper quickly
responded. He later told the crowd,
"There's a real difference between
having input — you underestimate
the amount of input you have —
and being happy with the decision."
At times, the debate degenerated
into name-calling. Casper almost
walked away after a student likened
Provost Condoleezza Rice to
Supreme Court Justice Clarence
Thomas.
Rice "is one of your most able and
wonderful teachers," Casper
responded, picking up his briefcase
and moving to leave. He changed his
mind when audience members
asked him to stay and listen to the
contents of the fliers.
Much of the morning's debate
focused on the layoff of Cecilia Bur
ciaga, an associate dean in the Office
of Student Affairs who also has
served since 1985 as resident fellow
at Casa Zapata.
"It is incredibly insulting and dis
respectful the way [Burciaga] was
treated," Hernandez said. "She is a
symbol of our community. She gave
20 years of her personal and profes
sional life to this University. She was
the highest-ranking Chicana admin

istrator. If you don't have any respect
for her, what does that mean for us,
the Chicano/Latino community?"
Casper attributed the layoff to
budget issues, pointing out that
Burciaga herself had at one point
suggested her position could be ait.
"Any university that wants to
keep a person will find another posi
tion," Hernandez replied, adding
that she is disappointed the admin
istration did not take the Burciagas
up when they offered to serve as
Casa Zapata RFs for another year.
When students demanded that
the new resident fellow be a faculty
member, Casper's response elicited
the only laughter of the morning.
"I want Casa Zapata to survive,"
he said. "We will do our damnedest
to make it survive. I'm obviously not
going to appoint myself as resident
fellow of Casa Zapata. I hope we will
find a faculty member."
In an interview, Burciaga said
she was not aware of plans for the
demonstration. "My husband and I
feel very touched because we
received so much love during the
past week," she said.
She confirmed that she and her
husband, Tony Burciaga, had
offered to stay on as resident fellows
for another year but were turned
down.
"It was real clear that that door
was shut to us, which was painful,"
she added. "They say it's purely
budget, but that doesn't seem right
to other people and all I know is that

I'm in pain."
The discussion in the Quad also
focused on financial support for
minority graduate students. Casper
ardently defended his record on
graduate issues, noting that he had
appointed George Dekker as associ
ate dean of graduate policy after the
last administration abolished the
Office of Graduate Studies.
But students contended that
funding levels, especially in the
School of Humanities and Sciences,
have dropped for minority graduate
students.
"Even if there were more money,
that would not solve the problem,"
Casper responded. "We need more
of you minority undergraduate stu
dents to go to graduate 5ch001....

The single most important thing for
increasing the number of minority
faculty in our university is that
those of you who have any desire for
scholarship go to graduate school."
Hernandez counteracted Cas
per's statements by citing the 1989
University Committee on Minority
Issues report which documented
that minority students have more
debt than other graduate students.
Junior Aida CroaJ added, "It's
about giving us financial sup
port If you don't give us finan
cial support, all the entreating in the
world doesn't make a difference."
In an interview later that after
noon, Casper said the encounter
was a "productive meeting."
"I told them the truth as I see it,"

he said, adding that he felt the stu
dents had a one-sided view of the
facts. For example, Casper said, "I
think what happened is that the
UCMI report got sidetracked by the
indirect-cost controversy. Ever since
I got here, I've worked to bring it
back to life."
Some students who watched the
events in the Quad said that they
were astonished by the confronta
tional tone. "I was just surprised by
the hostility," said sophomore Jim
Cassidy. "I think Casper's in a tight
situation because it all comes down
to finances. But I'm impressed with
the activism."

she added. "They say it's purely
budget, but that doesn't seem right
to other people and all I know is that

I'm in pain."
The discussion in the Quad also
focused on financial support for
minority graduate students. Casper
ardently defended his record on
graduate issues, noting that he had
appointed George Dekker as associ
ate dean of graduate policy after the
last administration abolished the
Office of Graduate Studies.
But students contended that
funding levels, especially in the
School of Humanities and Sciences,
have dropped for minority graduate
students.
"Even if there were more money,
that would not solve the problem,"
Casper responded. "We need more
of you minority undergraduate stu
dents to go to graduate 5ch001....

The single most important thing for
increasing the number of minority
faculty in our university is that
those of you who have any desire for
scholarship go to graduate school."
Hernandez counteracted Cas
per's statements by citing the 1989
University Committee on Minority
Issues report which documented
that minority students have more
debt than other graduate students.
Junior Aida CroaJ added, "It's
about giving us financial sup
port If you don't give us finan
cial support, all the entreating in the
world doesn't make a difference."
In an interview later that after
noon, Casper said the encounter
was a "productive meeting."
"I told them the truth as I see it,"

he said, adding that he felt the stu
dents had a one-sided view of the
facts. For example, Casper said, "I
think what happened is that the
UCMI report got sidetracked by the
indirect-cost controversy. Ever since
I got here, I've worked to bring it
back to life."
Some students who watched the
events in the Quad said that they
were astonished by the confronta
tional tone. "I was just surprised by
the hostility," said sophomore Jim
Cassidy. "I think Casper's in a tight
situation because it all comes down
to finances. But I'm impressed with
the activism."

In a spontaneous and emotion
ally charged encounter, about 30
students confronted University
President Gerhard Casper in the
Quad Friday and accused him of
lacking a commitment to minority
issues.
For more than an hour, stu
dents debated a defensive Casper
over issues ranging from support
for minority graduate students to
the layofT of high-ranking Chicana
administrator, Cecilia Burciaga.
The protesters charged Casper
with ignoring student voices.
But Casper suggested that stu
dents were blaming him for trends
not unique to Stanford and prob
lems that existed long before he
took office.
The conflict began when a
number of students, many of
whom were Latinos, brought their
protest to the Quad from Branner
Hall, where they had gathered in a
combination welcome and protest
for visiting prospective minority
graduate students. In the Quad,
they circled the academic build

ings clapping and repeating slo
gans to attract attention.
According to doctoral student
Francisca James Hernandez, the
group "just happened to run across
President Casper." But Casper said
in an interview later that he was
walking down the arcade when he
saw the students demonstrating and
"turned around and engaged them."
Many members of the group car
ried a yellow flier detailing what
they see as historical proof of the
administration's lack of responsive
ness on minority issues. Students
read parts of the flier aloud to
Casper and other students who
joined a growing crowd.
The flier covered such diverse
topics as the United Stanford Work
ers union, potential budget cuts to
campus ethnic centers and the small
number of minority faculty mem
bers.
In several instances, Casper
denied the charge that his adminis
tration makes decisions without stu
dent input.
"In a university, not everyone
has their way," he said. "You are
being listened to. You are certainly
being listened to by me. Some deci
sions are not to your liking. Not all
decisions can be to your liking."
"Are we going to get our way

sometimes?" one student yelled in
response to Casper's statements.
Junior Jake Dorman echoed this
sentiment. "The largest question is
whether students have a voice in
decisions From day one in this
(budget) process, students haven't
been explicitly involved."
"But they have," Casper quickly
responded. He later told the crowd,
"There's a real difference between
having input — you underestimate
the amount of input you have —
and being happy with the decision."
At times, the debate degenerated
into name-calling. Casper almost
walked away after a student likened
Provost Condoleezza Rice to
Supreme Court Justice Clarence
Thomas.
Rice "is one of your most able and
wonderful teachers," Casper
responded, picking up his briefcase
and moving to leave. He changed his
mind when audience members
asked him to stay and listen to the
contents of the fliers.
Much of the morning's debate
focused on the layoff of Cecilia Bur
ciaga, an associate dean in the Office
of Student Affairs who also has
served since 1985 as resident fellow
at Casa Zapata.
"It is incredibly insulting and dis
respectful the way [Burciaga] was
treated," Hernandez said. "She is a
symbol of our community. She gave
20 years of her personal and profes
sional life to this University. She was
the highest-ranking Chicana admin

istrator. If you don't have any respect
for her, what does that mean for us,
the Chicano/Latino community?"
Casper attributed the layoff to
budget issues, pointing out that
Burciaga herself had at one point
suggested her position could be ait.
"Any university that wants to
keep a person will find another posi
tion," Hernandez replied, adding
that she is disappointed the admin
istration did not take the Burciagas
up when they offered to serve as
Casa Zapata RFs for another year.
When students demanded that
the new resident fellow be a faculty
member, Casper's response elicited
the only laughter of the morning.
"I want Casa Zapata to survive,"
he said. "We will do our damnedest
to make it survive. I'm obviously not
going to appoint myself as resident
fellow of Casa Zapata. I hope we will
find a faculty member."
In an interview, Burciaga said
she was not aware of plans for the
demonstration. "My husband and I
feel very touched because we
received so much love during the
past week," she said.
She confirmed that she and her
husband, Tony Burciaga, had
offered to stay on as resident fellows
for another year but were turned
down.
"It was real clear that that door
was shut to us, which was painful,"
she added. "They say it's purely
budget, but that doesn't seem right
to other people and all I know is that

I'm in pain."
