# Students demonstrate against low graduate student diversity

### Beth Berselli Staff writer 
About 40 students chanted and passed
out fliers during a demonstration Friday
morning to protest the lack of diversity
among graduate students and the recent
layoff of Stanford's highest-ranking Chi
cana administrator.
The mannerly demonstration took
place in front of Branner Hall, outside a
breakfast meeting for prospective gradu
ate students who were visiting campus
during the University's Graduate Minor
ity Admit Weekend.
Demonstration participants wanted to
"bring attention to the outrageously low
number of minority graduate students"

and protest the elimination of Cecilia
Burciaga's position, said organizer Fran
cisca James Hernandez, a doctoral stu
dent.
Burciaga, an associate dean of Student
Affairs who has been a staff member for
20 years, was told last week that her job
will be cut by the end of the summer due
to budget reductions.
"The elimination of Burciaga's posi
tion is the latest in a series of attacks by
the Casper administration against ethnic
minority communities at Stanford," said
organizer Karen Ho, a master's student.
The demonstrators, who were from a
variety of ethnic groups, periodically

chanted, "Students yes! Layoffs
no!" and carried signs reading,
"We need to nail those hypocrites
b/cuz we care about U," "We have
a right to a non-racist, non-sexist
education," "We need you more
than ever" and "Recruit U and
drop U? We won't let them."
Ho said the protest was "a call
to minority graduate students.
The main message is that you are
very desperately needed here."
"We're calling it a candid wel
come," Ho added. "You have to be
honest and show all your dirty
laundry."
There are fewer minority grad
uate students now than in 1973,
Hernandez said. In 1973, minori
ties composed 9.5 percent of all
graduate students, she said, but
that dropped to 9 percent in 1993.
George Dekker, associate dean
of graduate policy, called the
demonstration "well-inten

tioned" and said the administra
tion shares many of the students'
concerns. "I know we're on the
same side in this matter, even if
we chose to fight the battle in a
different way," he said.
"The protesters were provid
ing a service to the prospective
students in some ways by alerting
them to the fact that Stanford is
not perfect. It has problems just
like any other community,"
Dekker added.
Students who attended the
breakfast reacted differently to
the demonstration. "At first I
thought it was a protest, but then
I just thought it was a welcome,"
said Dustin Hall.
Once he found out what the
demonstration was about, Hall
said he was concerned. "The
administrators at breakfast
talked about how committed they
are to diversity and how there's a
representation of minority facul
ty, but then they go and lay off
someone who's been here 20
years. Something's not right."
But several prospective stu

dents said that the demonstration
will not affect their decision to
attend the University. "I've defi
nitely decided to come to Stan
ford, but this protest has made
me wonder about the environ
ment I'll run into here," one
prospective student said.
The lack of diversity among
graduate students has been a con
cern for many years. The 1989
University Committee on Minori
ty Issues report found that Stan
ford enrolled 30 percent fewer
graduate minority students in
that year than it did in 1973. The
report called on the University to
commit to doubling minority
enrollment and graduation rates.
Late last year Provost Con
doleezza Rice formed the Provost's
Committee on the Recruitment,
Retention and Graduation of Tar
geted Minority Graduate Students
which will review the University's
performance over the last 10 years
and recommend improvements.
According to Dekker, the commit
tee plans to have a report on the
provost's desk by mid-April.
