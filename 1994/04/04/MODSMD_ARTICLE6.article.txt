# University to hold youth science camp
## Program will educate high school students about environmental issues 
### Marc Lee 
For eight weeks this summer, 22 low-income,
minority high school students will study envi
ronmental issues with the experts through a
new program sponsored by the Law School and
the Program in Human Biology.
The Stanford Youth Environmental Science
Program will focus on both science and policy and
hopes to give students the knowledge, resources
and motivation to be community leaders.
"We're trying to show how to tailor any pro
fession to impact on the environment," said
1989 Stanford graduate Michael McCullough,
co-director of the program. "We're hoping that
we can help these students go into positions in
society where they'll actually be able to influ
ence something in the future."
The gifted high-school sophomores and ju
niors will spend two to three weeks studying

basic and environmental sciences at home, in
order to ensure an adequate background be
fore arriving at Stanford for five and a half
weeks.
Once on campus, the curriculum includes
laboratory and field work, as well as instruc
tion by guest lecturers from a spectrum of dis
ciplines. Experts already on the roster include
David Epel from Hopkins Marine Station,
Law Prof. Barton Thompson and William
Durham, chair of the Program in Human Bi
ology.
"The response from all the faculty I've spo
ken with has been overwhelming," said the pro
gram's academic advisor, Ellen Porzig, an act
ing associate professor in Human Biology.
Students will complete an environmental
project with the advice of policy experts and pro
gram counselors, with possible themes includ
ing local and global population issues, water use

and pollution and agriculture and food sources.
The program will affect more than the 22 stu
dents involved because participants will take
their projects back to their communities, said
program co-director Ana Rowena Mallari, a se
nior majoring in human biology.
"A lot of times, people don't really feel that
environmental issues are even important to mi
norities," Mallari said. "But in many important
conversations I've had with people that are from
low-income backgrounds, they definitely care."
The environmental program was inspired by
the success of the Stanford Medical Youth Science
Program, which McCullough co-founded in 1988
before leaving for Oxford as a Rhodes scholar.
Stanford senior German Hernandez, associ
ate director of the environmental program, said
he was inspired to get involved by the success of
his own academic career, which he
largely attributes to the mentor
ing of program counselors during
his high-school participation in
the medical program.
"They became role models and
opened my eyes to all of the
resources that were open," Her
nandez said. "They said, 'Yes, you
can apply to a place like Stanford
and of course you can go to a
school like this.' They played a

really important part in the whole
experience."
As part of the program, Stan
ford admissions officers will share
their knowledge of the college
application process with the stu
dents.
Though the students' stay on
campus will only last eight weeks,
McCullough said the program
will extend beyond that time
because counselors and staff will
likely maintain contact with par
ticipants for more than six years.
The staff will use a database to
assess the long-term impact of
the project.
