# GSB ranked top business school in nation
## Success attributed to academic emphasis 
### September Trevino 
Stanford's Graduate School of
Business edged out MIT and Har
vard to win top honors in the lat
est issue of U.S. News and World
Report, which spotlights the best
graduate school programs in the
country.
The Business School was
ranked first, while Stanford's
graduate engineering program,
Law School and School of Medi
cine were ranked second, third
and ninth respectively.
"The academics and quality of
research coming out of the Busi
ness School is rigorous and intelli
gent," said Marie Mookini, direc
tor of admissions for the school, in
explaining the high rating. "It has

captured the attention of employ
ers as well as academics."
The Business School last re
ceived the magazine's number one
rating in 1992, and has claimed
the top spot during five of the
magazine's seven reports. Despite
the school's overwhelming suc
cess in U.S. News reports, Busi
nessweek ranked Stanford sev
enth in its latest poll.
The Business School's assis
tant director of admissions,
Sharon Hoffman, attributes the
discrepancy to a difference in
ranking criteria, suggesting U.S.
News focuses on academics while
Businessweek places a greater
emphasis on corporate recruiting.
