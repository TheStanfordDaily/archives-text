# GSB ranked top business school in nation
## Success attributed to academic emphasis 
### September Trevino 
Stanford's Graduate School of
Business edged out MIT and Har
vard to win top honors in the lat
est issue of U.S. News and World
Report, which spotlights the best
graduate school programs in the
country.
The Business School was
ranked first, while Stanford's
graduate engineering program,
Law School and School of Medi
cine were ranked second, third
and ninth respectively.
"The academics and quality of
research coming out of the Busi
ness School is rigorous and intelli
gent," said Marie Mookini, direc
tor of admissions for the school, in
explaining the high rating. "It has

captured the attention of employ
ers as well as academics."
The Business School last re
ceived the magazine's number one
rating in 1992, and has claimed
the top spot during five of the
magazine's seven reports. Despite
the school's overwhelming suc
cess in U.S. News reports, Busi
nessweek ranked Stanford sev
enth in its latest poll.
The Business School's assis
tant director of admissions,
Sharon Hoffman, attributes the
discrepancy to a difference in
ranking criteria, suggesting U.S.
News focuses on academics while
Businessweek places a greater
emphasis on corporate recruiting.

Hoffman asserted that while
past and present rankings may
reaffirm the department's
actions, they do not impact
departmental procedure.
"We're delighted. It's a nice
vote of confidence . . . but it does
not change what we do," she
said.
Both Mookini and Hoffman,

however, recognize the influence
of college rankings. "We can't be
naive to the impact of rankings
upon prospective applicants and
employers," Mookini said. "How
ever, it is dangerous to put too
much stock in them."
She emphasized that the
Business School is "not a trendy
program and we do not just
focus on best current practices."
Rather, she said, the school
prides itself on continuous
improvement as opposed to occa
sional revamping.

Mookini suggested that the
school's emphasis on cooperative
education through teamwork put
the school at the forefront.
"We believe the whole is
greater than the sum of its parts
in shared learning," she said.
Mookini also said the Business
School's demanding selection pro
cess sets it apart from other
schools. "We're the most selective
school and we get the best stu
dents. They're bright, talented
and aggressive in a positive
sense," Mookini said.
