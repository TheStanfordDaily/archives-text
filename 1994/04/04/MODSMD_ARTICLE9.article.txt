# Let the Rush begin
## Frats kick off annual activities 
### Vivien Wang Staff writer 
War games, paint ball, casino
nights and theme parties — but
no alcohol — will fill the two
weeks of Fraternity Rush offi
cially beginning tonight.
This year's Fraternity Rush
was preceded by the newly cre
ated Fraternity Forum, held in
White Plaza last Thursday and
Friday. A disc jockey provided
entertainment while fraternities
offered information, free copies
of the Interfraternity Council
Rush book and a chance to regis
ter for Rush.
Junior Andy Crispino, the
IFC Rush chairman, said the
purpose of the forum was to
"show the presence of frats on
campus."
Apart from the forum,
Crispino said Rush activities
this year will be similar to those
in previous years. Each fraterni
ty will sponsor four events dur
ing the two-week period.

Crispino said that interested
men "can still register at any
Rush party" if they missed their
chance at the forum. He also
stressed that Rush will be dry
this year, as it has been since
1991.
Fraternal affairs adviser
Heather Dunn, program coordi
nator for the Office of Student
Activities, added that Rush
events this year will be "very
creative and non-alcoholic."
Although the number of men
expected to rush is not known,
Dunn said more than 400 men
participated in Fraternity Rush
last year.
Sorority Rush, which kicks
off with an orientation meeting
tonight but officially begins
tomorrow, will be fairly similar
to Rush in previous years, but
there will be a few, small differ
ences.
Senior Katie Alberts, the
Intersorority Council Rush
chair, said that this year sorori
ties will hold "lengthened par

ties, to give time for rushees to
get to know sororities better."
In addition, this year marks
the first time Kappa Delta Phi,
the Asian-American sorority,
will be holding informal Rush at
the same time as regular Rush.
Sororities will hold "open
house" meetings in tents on
Wilbur Field Tuesday through
Friday and invitations to more
parties will be passed out Satur
day and Sunday. Rushees will
attend their two preferred
sororities' parties on Monday
night and sororities will pass
out bids next Tuesday after
noon.
Sorority adviser Nanci Howe,
director of student activities,
said that the only other changes
this year will be operational
shifts affected by.fire regula
tions.
"They're things that no one
would notice," she said, adding
that the change was prompted
by closer cooperation with the
county fire marshal this year.
