The Palo Alfro LSAT Program
The Program's courses to prepare students for the June 13 LSAT and June 18 GMAT
start respectively on April 9 and 10 and meet thereafter on most Tuesday (LSAT) and
Wednesday (GMAT) evenings. All curricular preparation, instruction, and feedback are
offered by a former Stanford faculty member who is a Stanford J.D. and a practicing
attorney who has prepared members of the Stanford community since 1978 for these
exams. The median scores for the Program's students in recent years are 164 (LSAT)
and 680 (GMAT). Each class will have room for only 8 to 10 students. The fee is $575.
And remember, THE JUNE LSAT IS USUALLY THE EASIEST OF EACH
YEAR'S EXAMS.
