Noted intellectual Noam
Chomsky will bring his radical
criticism of U.S. foreign policy to
campus when he delivers the an
nual Robert Wesson Lecture to
morrow afternoon.
Sponsored by the Stanford
Ethics in Society Program, the
3:15 p.m. speech in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium will be titled "Democ
racy and the Free Market in the
New World Order."
In addition, a film featuring
Chomsky's political views and cri
tique of mass media will be shown
today at Kimball Hall at 7 p.m.
and again April 20 at Cubberly
Auditorium.
Political Science Prof. Susan
Okin, chair of the Ethics in Soci
ety Program, expressed excite
ment about the speech and specu
lated that Chomsky will "chal
lenge a lot of people's views" in his
discussion of American foreign
policy.
Chomsky currently serves as a
professor of linguistics at MIT. A
fellow of the American Academy
of Arts and Sciences and member
of the National Academy of Sci
ence, he has received 10 honorary
degrees from universities around
the world and is the author of nu
merous books and articles.
Carole Brouillet, a member of
the Peninsula Peace and Justice
Center, said his speech should
"awakon students to question the
media, discover the alternative
media and discover their own
power as individuals to change
society for the better."
Chomsky's visit is a "catalyst
for people to read his books, help
stop some of the worst atrocities
and change some of the

events. . . . The mass media
encourages apathy, it doesn't
point a finger at whose really to
blame," Brouillet said.
Tonight's film, a Canadian
documentary called "Manufac
turing Consent," features the
political life and times of the con
troversial author, describing
how Chomsky became a liberal
spokesperson. It also demon
strates how the media — which
play a pivotal role in the decision
making-process of government
— is a propaganda tool to mobi
lize public support for the gov
ernment, Brouillet said.

In the film, Chomsky specifically
analyzes the media's role in the
Gulf War and media coverage of
East Timor and Cambodia in the
late '70s. For example, Chomsky
suggests that the media overlooked
U.S. approval of the killing of
200,000 indigenous citizens of East
Timor by Indonesia, while in Cam
bodia attacks on communists
received an excess of news coverage.
Brouillet said Chomsky is well
known internationally but almost
unknown in the United States
because "his analysis of govern
ment policy is extremely damning
to the U.S."
