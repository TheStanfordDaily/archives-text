The Daily's March 9 article
titled "Culture, costumes â€” arid
a bit of controversy" incorrectly
stated that the Indian group
Sanskriti raised about $2,500
from the Bhangra by the Bay
event, which they sponsored.
This figure, however, represents
the gross revenue. The event's
net profit was $292, according to
Sanskriti co-chair Rani Desh
pande.
