Stocks plummet again
NEW YORK (AP) — Stocks plummet
ed again yesterday in violent spasms of
selling that sent the Dow Jones industri
al average down more than 40 points to a
six-month low, renewing a decline that
gripped the market last week.
Still, there were no signs of a much
more cathartic drop in stocks as some
investment professionals had feared dur
ing the three-day Easter weekend.
Although the market bounced around in
heavy trading, buyers emerged to exploit
price drops.
In addition, anecdotal evidence
showed millions of small investors — the
underpinnings of the market's vitality
over the past few years — haven't been
goaded into selling. That was regarded as
a healthy sign.

"We do not sense any great panic,
especially on the stock side," said Ray
mond Worseck, chief economist at A.G.
Edwards & Sons, a St. Louis-based net
work of brokerages that cater to individ
ual investors. "We don't detect any great
groundswell of anxiety."
PLO, Israel agree on troops
CAIRO, Egypt (AP) - The PLO and
Israel agreed yesterday to station
approximately 9,000 Palestinian police in
the Gaza Strip and West Bank town of
Jericho, the PLO's chief delegate said.
But negotiators bogged down over
other details of the deployment that will
mark the first step toward Palestinian
self-rule in the occupied lands, and the
problems looked set to delay the arrival
of the police force.
