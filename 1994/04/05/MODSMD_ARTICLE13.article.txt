# Mexican assassins number seven
## Special prosecutor says suspects include Colosio's head of security 
### 
MEXICO CITY (AP) - At least
seven people were involved in the
assassination of the man who was like
ly to have become Mexico's next presi
dent, a special prosecutor said yester
day.
The suspects include the head of
local security for presidential candi
date Luis Donaldo Colosio at the
March 23 rally where he was slain, as
well as three men hired to guard him.
The prosecutor, former supreme court
justice Miguel Montes Garcia, said
still others may be involved.
Montes did not discuss a possible
motive, nor directly address the issue
of a broader conspiracy that many
Mexicans believe existed.
But the announcement dramatical
ly widens the number of suspects in
Mexico's most serious political assas

sination since 1928. Colosio, as the
candidate of the long-incumbent
Institutional Revolutionary Party, or
PHI, was seen as a shoo-in for the
Aug. 21 election.
Initially, the government insisted
that Mario Aburto Martinez, the con
fessed gunman, acted alone. Officials
later said several people might have
been involved, while discounting a
wider conspiracy.
Montes said yesterday that Aburto,
23, is still the man accused of firing
the shots that killed Colosio.
But he said four members of the
security detail hired for the day were
in custody, and two others are being
sought.
Aburto told police he went to the
rally alone, but also said he belonged
to an unspecified political group that

has thousands of members.
Aburto said he had intended only
to wound Colosio in order to win
news coverage for his views on a
rebellion by southern Indians and
other socials ills, according to the
transcript.
Aburto's attorney also said he sug
gested he had made contacts with
unspecified armed groups in Mexico.
Police have also speculated that radi
cal groups in southern California,
where Aburto lived for several years,
might be involved.
Opinion polls have repeatedly indi
cated that Mexicans believe there was
a conspiracy to kill Colosio. Many say
they suspect members of the coun
try's political establishment. Widely
varying theories of who did it, and
why, have run rampant.
