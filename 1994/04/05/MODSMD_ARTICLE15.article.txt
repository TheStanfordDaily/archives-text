THE ASSU SPRING elections
are almost upon us. As elec
tion day nears, students
should remember that their votes
are the most powerful way to send
a vocal message to the community.
In the past year, students — espe
cially graduates — have clearly
demonstrated that they want change
in the way student government
works. The dramatic increase in spe
cial fee refunds testifies to this.
By one measure — the increase
in senate candidates over last year
— students are showing more
interest in student government.
But this renewed interest in stu
dent government participation will
only come to fruition next year if
the rest of the student body edu
cates themselves first — on the
candidates and the issues they will
vote on during this election.
Picking up and reading an elec
tion handbook is a good start.
These will be available soon from
the ASSU office or at the post
office. The handbook gives details

about all candidates for the senate,
Council of Presidents and other
offices; campus groups' special fee
requests; and — perhaps most
importantly — amendments for
student government reform that
will appear on the ballot.
Before students log on to cast
their electronic ballots next week,
they should make sure they have
read the texts — printed in the
handbook — of these proposals.
If passed, one of the amendments
would effectively divide the ASSU
into two bodies by requiring special
fee requests to be approved by a
majority of both undergraduates
and graduates. Another amend
ment would divide the campus into
districts and move elections to fall
qu&rter.
These proposals are significant
and can have far-reaching effects.
Students should be sure to read the
handbook and understand the
issues so that they can make
informed decisions when they vote
on them next week.
