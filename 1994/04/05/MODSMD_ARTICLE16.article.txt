# Less colorful Draw
## 
### 
BIG GAME. Flicks. Full Moon
on the Quad. Stanford may
not be as deeply-rooted in
tradition as some of its East Coast
counterparts, but it definitely
enjoys keeping up those rituals it
does have.
One of those Stanford customs is
the undergraduate housing lottery.
For years the process has intrigued
and amused students, who "pre
pare" for the Draw with costumes,
songs and other ceremonies in
hopes of having better luck when
they choose that magical number.
But no longer.
This year, the process will be dif
ferent â€” the Draw will be com
pletely computerized. The change is
practical in terms of cutting costs of
administration and time, since the
Housing Center will no longer need
to pay student volunteers to work
at the Draw. While the costs of run
ning the Draw seemed relatively
minor, efficiency is preferable in

this time of budget cuts.
However, the new computerized
process has some problems. Stu
dents will not know their draw
numbers until they receive their
housing assignments May 25, two
to four weeks after they log in to
apply for housing. Putting students
in suspense for this length of time
seems unnecessarily cruel.
In addition, the new system will
keep students from partaking in
any of the antics associated with
the Draw. Although draw groups
can select a name for themselves,
most imaginative aspects of the
process will be eliminated as the
Draw moves into anti-climatic com
puter clusters. The University
should remember that Stanford
students enjoy the traditions of the
Draw, and as much creativity as
possible should be preserved.
After all, what's wrong with a
seance to ensure you don't draw
2,999?
