## Childhood gender bender 
### 
DO YOU REMEMBER the first
time you knew what gender was,
much less what it meant to be
male or female? I don't. But I do remem
ber the absence of gender. My family
will never let me forget that time when
my uncle asked me whether I had a
boyfriend and I answered "Yes. Her
name is Julie." I was in pre-school then,
long before the days when even diapers
became gender-specific.
I wonder if any three-year-old in the
clutches of American commercialism
could possibly be as blissfully ignorant
as I was at that age. Doubtful. How
many toys can you think of whose mar
keting strategies don't target children
of a specific gender? My exhaustive list,
after pillaging the toy section of Target
for three frenzied hours, consists of
dinosaurs and Play-Do. So there's
always prehistory and fluorescent
bread dough. Yippee.
I look back to my childhood and am
thankful for having parents enlight
ened enough to make my brother and I
both take ballet as well as Judo. They
didn't freak out when I ripped all the
heads off my dolls and my brother res
cued them, saying "Don't — you're
hurting them." They were even sensi
ble enough to let me climb trees and
buy me an Erector set. My brother had
dolls of both genders and different
races, and might have been the only

boy in his school who knew how to
knit.
Of course, it wasn't all that black
and white — but that's the point. I col
lected stickers and my brother Pat (an
unfortunate name for him to have
when I talk about this stuff, I know)
built umpteen skateboard ramps. I
have a yellow belt in Judo, but he can
still do a better split than I can. It was
all the same to my parents, who
weren't afraid to praise a range of
interests on both sides of the gender
divide.
I'm not trying to praise my parents
as the enlightened role models for all to
aspire to. God knows I developed a wide
range of neuroses that rival my
strengths. On the other hand, my
brother is nowhere near as impressed
with my parents' unorthodox parenting
as I am — in fact, he is probably ready
to shoot me for dredging up his sordid
past.
It's a challenge to treat personality
traits as gender-neutral. I have a special
respect for women engineers and male
peer counselors because they have
developed abilities that cross the bound
aries of gender norms. Breaking out of
the "acceptable" range of characteris
tics represents true individualism and
empowerment.
Does all this mean I do not enjoy
being a woman, being feminine? No.

But I am wary of saying that there
should be categorical differences
between genders, and tired of justify
ing myself when I demonstrate
attributes that slip the knot of soci
ety's acceptance. Thinking in terms of
a continuum unmarked by gender lines
will help us see ourselves as strong
individuals rather than anonymous
soldiers in the Battle of the Sexes. We
are all theoretically born with the same
capacities for development in any mul
titude of directions — why does this so
often get reduced to the familiar
dichotomy?
An experience I had last summer
made me realize why I prefer to let
myself experience the ambiguities. I was
at the pool and saw a mother playing
with her diapered baby.
"Look at that adorable baby boy!" I
said to my friend.
Ten minutes later, after a dip in the
pool, I saw the most beautiful baby girl
in a pink bathing suit.
It was the same baby.

Liz is looking forward to playing with
her old Erector set after she graduates in
June. If she can't find a job, she is plan
ning to be a Judo instructor.
