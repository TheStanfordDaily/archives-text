## Sorority member criticizes letter on campus division 
### 
I WAS GREATLY offended by the
ridiculous generalizations Prof. Wil
fred Stone (Daily, March 30) made
about the Stanford University Greek
community. It is obvious from the point
of view of this three-year sorority mem
ber that Prof. Stone was simply hurling
stereotypical slander at many individuals
who neither fit nor warrant his animosi
ty. His claims of elitism perpetrated dur
ing Rush make it apparent that he has
no idea what actually goes on during this
week.
Prof. Stone, I wonder what allows you
to claim to be an authority on the Greek
system? Since, you neither discussed
specifics of Rush nor your own personal
experience during Rush, it is clear that
you have never been a part of the Stan
ford University Rush process. I don't
believe I need to remind Prof. Stone that
it is best to only address issues in which
you have factual or personal information.
I found Stone's remarks to be not only
exaggerated, but also absurd.
Sororities and fraternities provide
many wonderful services for their mem
bers and for the community. Philan
thropy and academic pursuit have been a
mainstay of the Greek system since its
inception. My own sorority supports the
active community involvement of its
members; we each individually volunteer
time at an alternative home for teens, a
food bank and have raised money for Big
Brothers/Big Sisters and the YWCA Rape
Crisis Center. These causes mean a lot to
us as Stanford students and as young

women.
The Greek system provides a nurtur
ing atmosphere for the development of
leadership skills. It encourages women to
pursue positions of power and responsi
bility and allows them to gain insight
into important group dynamic skills.
These traits are extremely helpful in the
"real" world in every field of professional
or business life, where, traditionally,
women are seldom encouraged to assert
themselves or to seek out positions of
leadership. On a more personal level, I
can say that my leadership roles within
the Greek community have given me
great personal fulfillment and self-confi
dence.
The Stanford Greek system also pro
vides a great educational service to its
members. As a facilitator of workshops
for young fraternity and sorority pledges,
I am helping the Intersorority Council
and Interfraternity Council provide
resources for many of the problems fac
ing college students today. In the past I
have attended meetings about date rape,
alcohol, eating disorders and career
counseling. These forums permit men
and women with many different ideas
and backgrounds to exchange ideas and
opinions. This community involvement is
exactly the integration Stone is calling
for, which he assumes the Greek system
excludes.
I would like to challenge Prof. Stone's
notions of Rush. First of all, Rush is an
extremely fun and exciting time for the
Greek community. It is a chance for

members to spend a lot of time together
and to showcase their pride in their
Greek organization.
Second, I have very fond memories of
my time as a rushee. I found many
women, who I still regard as friends
today, with a variety of interests and
experiences to be part of all the sororities
I visited. Rush allows students new to
the Farm the chance to meet and make
friendships with older peers. This is a
highly underrated aspect of Rush that
members of fraternities and sororities
embrace each year.
Third, I object to Stone's characteriza
tions of the Greek system as excluding
"wimps and turkeys and wusses and fat
kids with acne." Never in my experience
in a Greek organization have I encoun
tered such harsh evaluations of other
students. It is not up to the members of
a Greek organization to "self-select"
their members. Rush is a voluntary and
mutual process between Greek organiza
tions and rushees. Individuals choose
organizations they are happy and com
fortable with and, of course, accepting a
bid to a fraternity or sorority is solely up
to the rushee.
Prof. Stone's archaic suggestion that
Greek organizations are "social/ethnic/
religious nationalisms" is completely
unfounded. He finds it so easy to group
all an organization's members in one big
heap, yet one of the great attributes of
the Greek system is its support of indi
vidual strength and identity.
Sororities and fraternities are made

up of Stanford men and women from dif
ferent economic and social classes, vary
ing regions of the country and of the
world and who constitute every race, reli
gion and ethnic group. You can not
blame today's Stanford fraternal system
for the sins of past societies. Stone's dia
tribe about the elite injustices of the
Greek system are not reflected in any of
Stanford's Greek organizations.
Finally, I would like to include my
own personal experiences as a sorority
member. Yes, my sisters are my friends.
If this is a crime or an injustice, I am
guilty! My sorority sisters are unique,
fun, kind and hilarious women that I
plan to be friends with for the next 50
years. I believe that our common bond of
sisterhood has allowed us to find similar
ities and revel in the differences among
ourselves and others. I have chosen to be
a part of the Greek system because it has
enhanced my Stanford experience.
I cannot compare Stanford's Greek
life with that of other universities
because I refuse to generalize about peo
ple and organizations I do not know. I
only wish Prof. Stone could heed my
advice. I encourage all freshmen and
sophomores to explore Rush and develop
their own opinions about Stanford's
Greek life. I only hope all underclassmen
gain the contentment and satisfaction I
have, because the Greek system does not
divide â€” it unites in the common bond of
universal friendship.
