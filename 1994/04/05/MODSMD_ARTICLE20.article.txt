# Letter on balkanization grossly simplifies issue
## 
### 
In a letter to the editor on April 4,
Derek Miyahara and Tommy Lee
Woon write "... the balkanization
that leads to the ethnic cleansing in
Yugoslavia is the desire of the Serbs,

Moslems and Croats to eliminate one
another."
This is a gross simplification of the
issue in former Yugoslavia and does
nothing but propagate misunderstand
ings.
People of many ethnicities in the
democratic nation of Bosnia are fight
ing to protect their country and their
homes, while Serbia is singling out

Muslims as a target for their genoci
dal expansionism.
Just as the first holocaust wasn't
the desire of the Jews and Germans
to eliminate each other, this holo
caust is not "the desire of Serbs,
Moslems, and Croats to eliminate
each other."
