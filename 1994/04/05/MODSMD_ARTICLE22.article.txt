# N'Gai Croal: fly in the buttermilk
## Drive-by firing: goodfellas in Bldg. 10 take aim 
### 
One thing you can be certain. I will
always be straightforward.
— Provost Condoleezza Rice, at last quar
ter's forum on the proposed ethnic center
budget cuts
THERE ARE a couple ways to cut
the position of a high-ranking, vet
eran employee. You could show
them the utmost respect, by meeting
with them as quickly possible to let them
know, offer them another position within
your organization and let them continue
the other activities they performed apart
from the position that you are cutting.
You could also callously disrespect
that person. You could take your own
sweet time to inform them, have your
boss call them up for a meeting while you
avoid them, then inform them minutes
before your boss is scheduled to meet
them. At that time, you can strike a cow
ardly pose and remain silent while your
boss informs this person that there is
nothing for them in this organization.
You can finish off by crossing your fin
gers, offering them a decent golden

parachute, and hoping that your 30
pieces of silver can buy their silence.
Given the events of the past academic
year, it should come as no surprise that
Vice Provost for Student Affairs Mary
Edmonds chose Option Two as the
weapon of choice with which to terminate
Cecilia Burciaga, an associate dean of stu
dent affairs, a resident fellow in Casa
Zapata and Stanford's highest-ranking
Chicana employee. As reported in The
Daily, Burciaga's 20 years of service to
the University include assistant to the
president for Chicano affairs, assistant
provost for faculty affairs, associate dean
of graduate studies and the University
affirmative action officer.
According to sources, Burciaga had
been scheduled to meet with Rice at
10:30 a.m. on the Tuesday during spring
break. Unexpectedly for Burciaga,
Edmonds called her in for a 10 a.m. meet
ing that same day. Edmonds, who was
obviously aware of Burciaga's 10:30
meeting, stalled by talking about other
things until 10:25, at which time she told
Burciaga that her position was being ter

minated, effective at the end of August.
At her 10:30 meeting, Rice confirmed
this, adding that there were no other
positions for Burciaga at the University
and that she could not stay on as Casa
Zapata's RF.
This announcement came as a com
plete surprise to Burciaga, whose posi
tion had remained secure through all of
the blueprints for the restructuring of
Student Affairs. She had previously
offered her position as one that could be
cut, but with the express understanding
that Edmonds would not make any such
decision without negotiating with her
first. Edmonds never took her up on this
offer.
Obviously, an administration that
recently protested The Daily's accusation
of institutional amnesia, winning a "For
the Record" correction in the process,
sees nothing wrong with giving a long
time member of the Stanford community
just five months to hit the road — and
like Jack, "don't you come back no more,
no more, no more, no more."
Burciaga's firing was the equivalent of

a Mafia execution-style slaying — the
only thing missing from the scene of the
crime was a dead fish wrapped in news
paper. Burciaga had at times been a vocal
critic of University policies, unlike so
called advocates for students Michael
Jackson and Mary Edmonds.
The crude, unprofessional way in
which Edmonds carried out Provost Con
doleezza Rice's and President Gerhard
Casper's contract hit was deliberate — a
message to all of their critics that says
"Let the headline read, 'Don't fuck with
us.' "
When confronted in the Quad by stu
dent protesters last Friday, Casper said
Burciaga wanted to go to graduate
school, as though he were doing her a
favor. How many people do you know
that do someone a favor by firing them?
Burciaga even offered to stay on for
another year as the Casa Zapata resident
fellow. But that, alas, was a favor that
the Germanic Godfather would not
grant.
As usual, Casper claims he listens to
student, staff and faculty. If that is the

case, his administration's hearing aid
must be turned all the way down. When a
senior administrator offers her position
to the budget ax-wielders, only asking to
be consulted, how can he consider his
covert hatchet-job — conducted under
the cover of spring break — as "listening"
to what Burciaga has to say?
And obviously, an administration who
would make their first firing from the
Legal Office Robin Kennedy — the wife
of former University president Donald
Kennedy — can't be too concerned about
appearances. Rather, these goodfellas are
concerned with sending out a strong mes
sage to any vocal dissenters, particularly
those in staff positions.
Don't cross us, they say. We got to
Burciaga . . . and we can get to you too.

N'Gai finally understands what that
dead canary in his P.O. box was all
about. His column appears here Tues
days.
