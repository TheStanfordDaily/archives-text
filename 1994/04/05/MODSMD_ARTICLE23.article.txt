## Senior helps build on winning tradition Hedgpeth ends successful four-year career with honors and optimism 
### Andy Eiser Senior staff writer 
One minute, 45 seconds
showed on the clock when the
whistle blew. An official shouted
"Red!" and signaled the numbers
"2" and "5" to the Maples Pavil
ion scorer's table.
Several fouls and desperate
three-point field goal attempts
later, the clock would run out and
Purdue's 82-65 victory over the
Cardinal women's basketball
team in the NCAA Western
Regional final would officially go
down in the books. But it would
not matter then; this moment is
what mattered.
"Foul is on Christy Hedgpeth,
her fifth personal," the public
address announcer bellowed.
A few groans of disapproval
echoed through the gym, as frus
tration overcame the Stanford
faithful who had all but punched
their tickets to the Final Four in
Richmond, Va. But then the emo
tional roller coaster took a bitter
sweet turn as the senior guard
made her way to the Cardinal
bench, and the groans rapidly
gave way to applause and then to
a thunderous standing ovation.
The game, the season, the
career — all of it was drawing to a
close for Hedgpeth, always to be
counted on as No. 25. The stand
ing ovation was appropriate, but
it was not supposed to end this
way.
The ending could have been
more like the 1990-91 season,
Hedgpeth's freshman year out of
Thomasville, N.C., when the Car
dinal reached the Final Four
despite key injuries to center
Trisha Stevens and forward Julie
Zeilstra.
Playing mostly in a reserve
role behind senior Ail-American
Sonja Henning and sophomore
Molly Goodenbour, Hedgpeth
scored an average of 7.8 points
per game but took in even more
points from her mentors. In fact,
she credits Henning most for

helping develop her game.
"Sonja took it upon herself to
have a great senior year, and she
was patient with me. I've never
forgotten that," Hedgpeth said.
While that Cardinal team suf
fered a semifinal loss to Ten
nessee, Hedgpeth had tasted the
big time and wanted more. But
she realized even at that stage
how difficult returning to cham
pionship play would be.
"Anyone who plays at Stanford
steps into the tradition. It was a
learning experience, and I felt the
pressure because every team we
played had a goal of beating Stan
ford," Hedgpeth said.
The ending should have been
more like the 1991-92 season,
Hedgpeth's sophomore year,
when the Cardinal snuck up on
the NCAA field, upset No. 1 Vir
ginia in the semifinals and
grabbed its second national cham
pionship in three years.
Like the Stanford squad of two
years ago, this year's edition
entered the season out of the top
five in the national polls, a rare
occurrence since head coach Tara
VanDerveer revamped the pro
gram in 1985. But both teams
had the right mix of unanimity —
in not having a single star to
become the focus of media and
opponent attention — and real
star-quality athletes that made
for a unique kind of bonding.
"Our team's chemistry this
year felt so much like that year, it
was almost eerie," Hedgpeth said.
"We were always laughing and
not bickering and there was no
jealousy. It was a great atmo
sphere, a great environment."
Individually, Hedgpeth's
senior statistics also bear signifi
cant resemblance to her sopho
more numbers — career-bests in
scoring (13.8 ppg) and field goal
shooting percentage (.507) now
against 13.3 and .492 then, a 3.2
rebounding average now against
a 3.6 then and 73 total assists in

both seasons.
The comparison is enhanced
further when looking at the Car
dinal's late-season surges in both
years, and at Hedgpeth's contri
butions to those runs. Both times
Stanford won 14 of its final 15
games, the only difference being
when the loss came during the
streak.
In '91-'92, Hedgpeth improved
on her numbers throughout the
streak, eventually scoring 21
points in a regional final win over
USC and 17 in the national title
contest against Western Ken
tucky. This season she averaged
over 15 points a game in Pacific
10 Conference play, earning her

self First Team All Pac-10 hon
ors, and 21 apiece in the Cardi
nal's three tournament victories.
"I didn't feel things went my
way early this year, but I meshed
together with the team and felt
more confident playing with them
by the end," Hedgpeth said.
Of course, as with Stanford's
previous success, none of the Car
dinal's rise to a second-place Pac
-10 finish and near-miss on Hedg
peth's third Final Four in four
years would have been possible
without VanDerveer.
"I feel fortunate to have played
for her. She taught me a lot and is
always pushing women to play
basketball to their potential,"
Hedgpeth said.
In fact, despite this year's dis
appointing finish, Hedgpeth said
she feels her team played to its
potential this season and wants to

be in town for what she feels will
be even greater accomplishments
next year.
"If next year's freshmen have
the right attitude, I think our
team will go far," Hedgpeth said.
Meanwhile, the two-time Pac
-10 All-Academic First Team
member will cherish the memo
ries of her playing career and look
to put the psychology degree she
will earn in June to use.
So maybe the ending wasn't so
bad after all. The leading charac
ter walks away safely and with no
regrets, and the show goes on.
But red jersey No. 25 will never
again be worn by Hedgpeth, and
she summarized the effect of her
departure on the Stanford pro
gram she leaves behind.
"The team will never be the
same again," Hedgpeth said.
No, it certainly will not.

to put the psychology degree she
will earn in June to use.
So maybe the ending wasn't so
bad after all. The leading charac
ter walks away safely and with no
regrets, and the show goes on.
But red jersey No. 25 will never
again be worn by Hedgpeth, and
she summarized the effect of her
departure on the Stanford pro
gram she leaves behind.
"The team will never be the
same again," Hedgpeth said.
No, it certainly will not.
One minute, 45 seconds
showed on the clock when the
whistle blew. An official shouted
"Red!" and signaled the numbers
"2" and "5" to the Maples Pavil
ion scorer's table.
Several fouls and desperate
three-point field goal attempts
later, the clock would run out and
Purdue's 82-65 victory over the
Cardinal women's basketball
team in the NCAA Western
Regional final would officially go
down in the books. But it would
not matter then; this moment is
what mattered.
"Foul is on Christy Hedgpeth,
her fifth personal," the public
address announcer bellowed.
A few groans of disapproval
echoed through the gym, as frus
tration overcame the Stanford
faithful who had all but punched
their tickets to the Final Four in
Richmond, Va. But then the emo
tional roller coaster took a bitter
sweet turn as the senior guard
made her way to the Cardinal
bench, and the groans rapidly
gave way to applause and then to
a thunderous standing ovation.
The game, the season, the
career — all of it was drawing to a
close for Hedgpeth, always to be
counted on as No. 25. The stand
ing ovation was appropriate, but
it was not supposed to end this
way.
The ending could have been
more like the 1990-91 season,
Hedgpeth's freshman year out of
Thomasville, N.C., when the Car
dinal reached the Final Four
despite key injuries to center
Trisha Stevens and forward Julie
Zeilstra.
Playing mostly in a reserve
role behind senior Ail-American
Sonja Henning and sophomore
Molly Goodenbour, Hedgpeth
scored an average of 7.8 points
per game but took in even more
points from her mentors. In fact,
she credits Henning most for

helping develop her game.
"Sonja took it upon herself to
have a great senior year, and she
was patient with me. I've never
forgotten that," Hedgpeth said.
While that Cardinal team suf
fered a semifinal loss to Ten
nessee, Hedgpeth had tasted the
big time and wanted more. But
she realized even at that stage
how difficult returning to cham
pionship play would be.
"Anyone who plays at Stanford
steps into the tradition. It was a
learning experience, and I felt the
pressure because every team we
played had a goal of beating Stan
ford," Hedgpeth said.
The ending should have been
more like the 1991-92 season,
Hedgpeth's sophomore year,
when the Cardinal snuck up on
the NCAA field, upset No. 1 Vir
ginia in the semifinals and
grabbed its second national cham
pionship in three years.
Like the Stanford squad of two
years ago, this year's edition
entered the season out of the top
five in the national polls, a rare
occurrence since head coach Tara
VanDerveer revamped the pro
gram in 1985. But both teams
had the right mix of unanimity —
in not having a single star to
become the focus of media and
opponent attention — and real
star-quality athletes that made
for a unique kind of bonding.
"Our team's chemistry this
year felt so much like that year, it
was almost eerie," Hedgpeth said.
"We were always laughing and
not bickering and there was no
jealousy. It was a great atmo
sphere, a great environment."
Individually, Hedgpeth's
senior statistics also bear signifi
cant resemblance to her sopho
more numbers — career-bests in
scoring (13.8 ppg) and field goal
shooting percentage (.507) now
against 13.3 and .492 then, a 3.2

both seasons.
The comparison is enhanced
further when looking at the Car
dinal's late-season surges in both
years, and at Hedgpeth's contri
butions to those runs. Both times
Stanford won 14 of its final 15
games, the only difference being
when the loss came during the
streak.
In '91-'92, Hedgpeth improved
on her numbers throughout the
streak, eventually scoring 21
points in a regional final win over
USC and 17 in the national title
contest against Western Ken
tucky. This season she averaged
over 15 points a game in Pacific
10 Conference play, earning her

self First Team All Pac-10 hon
ors, and 21 apiece in the Cardi
nal's three tournament victories.
"I didn't feel things went my
way early this year, but I meshed
together with the team and felt
more confident playing with them
by the end," Hedgpeth said.
Of course, as with Stanford's
previous success, none of the Car
dinal's rise to a second-place Pac
-10 finish and near-miss on Hedg
peth's third Final Four in four
years would have been possible
without VanDerveer.
"I feel fortunate to have played
for her. She taught me a lot and is
always pushing women to play
basketball to their potential,"
Hedgpeth said.
In fact, despite this year's dis
appointing finish, Hedgpeth said
she feels her team played to its
potential this season and wants to

be in town for what she feels will
be even greater accomplishments
next year.
"If next year's freshmen have
the right attitude, I think our
team will go far," Hedgpeth said.
Meanwhile, the two-time Pac
-10 All-Academic First Team
member will cherish the memo
ries of her playing career and look
to put the psychology degree she
will earn in June to use.
