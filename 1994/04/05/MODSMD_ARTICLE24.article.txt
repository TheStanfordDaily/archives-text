# Cardinal hitters swing at San Jose State
## Cardinal looks to extend streak, eyes USC 
### Andy Eiser Senior staff writer 
Imagine that you are Cardinal head
baseball coach Mark Marquess. Or maybe
not.
As his llth-ranked team prepares to
host the San Jose State Spartans today at
Sunken Diamond, Marquess faces the
unenviable task of keeping a good thing
going. On the heels of a three-game series
sweep of archrival California last weekend,
Stanford (21-13) finds No. 3 USC waiting
this weekend in Los Angeles and so must
maintain its momentum.
"They [San Jose State) have handed us
some tough losses through the years, but
we have to keep our hot streak," said Mar
quess' designated hitter, senior Nate Olm
stead.
The Spartans (18-15) hope to throw a
cold blanket over the Cardinal's winning

ways, and will rely heavily on versatile first
baseman Tim Gavello. Not only does
Gavello lead all San Jose State starters in
the major offensive categories (.376 aver
age, six homeruns, 30 runs batted in), but
he also possesses speed (eight stolen bases
in 10 attempts) and defensive skills (.989
fielding percentage) that make him a virtu
al one-man attack.
Olmstead answers the bell for Stanford,
however, in what could be a battle of offen
sive heavyweights. With a two-for-four
showing in the Cal series finale Saturday,
Olmstead improved his stellar average to
.392, 16 points better than Gavello. While
Olmstead's three homers only cut his coun
terpart's total in half, the Cardinal star
edged past Gavello with three RBI Satur
day to boost his season to Lai to 32.
