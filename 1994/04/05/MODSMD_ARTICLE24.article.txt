# Cardinal hitters swing at San Jose State
## Cardinal looks to extend streak, eyes USC 
### Andy Eiser Senior staff writer 
Imagine that you are Cardinal head
baseball coach Mark Marquess. Or maybe
not.
As his llth-ranked team prepares to
host the San Jose State Spartans today at
Sunken Diamond, Marquess faces the
unenviable task of keeping a good thing
going. On the heels of a three-game series
sweep of archrival California last weekend,
Stanford (21-13) finds No. 3 USC waiting
this weekend in Los Angeles and so must
maintain its momentum.
"They [San Jose State) have handed us
some tough losses through the years, but
we have to keep our hot streak," said Mar
quess' designated hitter, senior Nate Olm
stead.
The Spartans (18-15) hope to throw a
cold blanket over the Cardinal's winning

ways, and will rely heavily on versatile first
baseman Tim Gavello. Not only does
Gavello lead all San Jose State starters in
the major offensive categories (.376 aver
age, six homeruns, 30 runs batted in), but
he also possesses speed (eight stolen bases
in 10 attempts) and defensive skills (.989
fielding percentage) that make him a virtu
al one-man attack.
Olmstead answers the bell for Stanford,
however, in what could be a battle of offen
sive heavyweights. With a two-for-four
showing in the Cal series finale Saturday,
Olmstead improved his stellar average to
.392, 16 points better than Gavello. While
Olmstead's three homers only cut his coun
terpart's total in half, the Cardinal star
edged past Gavello with three RBI Satur
day to boost his season to Lai to 32.

club, Marquess points to the
Spartans' baserunning aggres
siveness, as translated into a
heady .736 (53-of-72) stolen
base percentage.
But Stanford swiped 12 bases
in 15 tries last weekend and has
inched its own success rate up
to .795 (66-of-83) on the year,
second only to Marquess' 1984
team in school history.
While offense, speed and
defense (where the Cardinal
committed just one error

against Cal) should not worry
Marquess, a legitimate concern
lies in the pitching department,
where "three or four" young
pitchers will take the mound.
Solid performances last week
end of Stanford's top three
starters — sophomores Todd
Bartels and Dan Reed and
freshman Jason Middlebrook —
earned each a start in Los
Angeles, so all are unable to go
today.
Among others, then, expect
freshman Mike Robbins — who
filled in nicely during Bartels
recent back troubles — to make
an appearance today.
Should the pitching go awry,

however, and the Cardinal
keeps up the timely hitting and
clutch pitching that marked its
play against Cal, it still should
have little problem running its
modest winning streak to four
games.
But if it doesn't?
"San Jose State is a quality
team, and if we don't play well,
they'll beat us," Marquess said.
And with just one non-con
ference loss, Stanford could
deflate the very hopes it created
after an amazing weekend in
league play.
Unthinkable? No, that is just
the way baseball works — but
no one wants to imagine that.
