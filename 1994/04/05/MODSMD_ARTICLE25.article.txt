# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
Spring quarter. A time of tanning and out
ings to the beach. A time when sweaters are
stashed and roller blades are pulled out of the
closet. A time of sunning in the oval and
splashing in deGuerre.
Spring is also a hot time for Stanford ath
letics, as many teams launch into post-season
action while others approach the peak of their

regular season play. While the Cardinal
emerged from last weekend suffering several
unexpected losses, this spring might also be a
time when Stanford repeats its five-title tradi
tion.
Propelling the Cardinal towards this goal
were junior Dusty Allen and freshman Sandra
De Silva, who each contributed in their typi
cally consistent forms this weekend to baseball
and women's tennis victories. In recognition
of their valuable efforts, they have been
named The Daily's Athletes of the Week.
Consistent is truly the right word to
describe De Silva, as the San Marino, Calif.,
native has proven one of the most reliable sin
gles players on the squad.
This weekend she took to the court in her
usual No. 6 singles slot against both UCLA
and USC. While the Bruins managed to outhit
Stanford, De Silva came through for the Car
dinal to improve her overall record to 19
straight wins without a single defeat.

Just as De Silva has maintained her same
high level of play throughout the season,
Allen, the starting Cardinal first baseman, has
established himself as a stronghold on the field
as well as at the plate.
In the "Big Series" over the weekend, the
Oklahoma City native socked in two homers,
and his first in Thursday's game proved just
the inspiration Stanford needed to pull out of
a 1-1 deadlock. He extended this hitting tor

rent over the next two days, capping the series
ofT with another homerun and four runs Sat
urday.
Not only did he lead the Cardinal's offen
sive onslaught, but Allen's glove-work at first
also provided the defensive spark that kept the
Stanford ball rolling and the Golden Bears on
the run.
