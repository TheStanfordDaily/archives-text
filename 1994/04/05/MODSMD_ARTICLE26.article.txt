# Tracksters sprint for SLO wins
## 
### Jorge Chen Staff writer 
This weekend's meet made it seem that
instead of competing against other Pacific 10
Conference squads, the men's and women's
track teams ought to compete against each
other for points.
The track squad swept the competition in
the Cal Poly-SLO meet, as the Stanford men
scored 160 points with BYU coming in second
with 128-1/2. On the women's side, the Cardi
nal destroyed its opponents with 173 points.
The closest scorer was Cal State-Los Angeles,
which finished with 91 points.
The weight squad helped the men's team to
a victory by providing an early cushion of 90
points. Junior co-captain Dave Popejoy set the
stage for the rest of his teammates by opening
the hammer with a comfortable first-place
toss of 223'3".
"I believe that we didn't take the team to a
victory this weekend but we set the stage for
it. The team as a whole came together and
produced," he said.
Other impressive performances came from
freshman Pete Swanson, with a first-place
shot put throw of 57' 3/4" followed by senior
Matt Karsevar with 55' 9-1/4". Freshman Jeff
Buckey won the discus with a toss of 177' 3"
followed by Karsevar with a mark of 169' 6".
The weight team owes much of its success
this year to the Stanford football team, as
many of the throwers became track team
members at the recommendation of head foot
ball coach Bill Walsh.
"Without the help of Bill Walsh and the
Stanford football team by sending Pete Swan
son, Jeff Buckey, Toby Norwood, and Justin
Strand, none of this would have been possi
ble," said assistant coach Robert Weir, who is
in charge of the throwers.
After the weight team was done for the day,
the runners and jumpers were also building
up points. Some of the meet highlights came
from two freshman runners.
Brian Zmijewski, one of Stanford's top
cross country recruits won the 3,000-meter
