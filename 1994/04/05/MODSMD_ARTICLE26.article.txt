# Tracksters sprint for SLO wins
## 
### Jorge Chen Staff writer 
This weekend's meet made it seem that
instead of competing against other Pacific 10
Conference squads, the men's and women's
track teams ought to compete against each
other for points.
The track squad swept the competition in
the Cal Poly-SLO meet, as the Stanford men
scored 160 points with BYU coming in second
with 128-1/2. On the women's side, the Cardi
nal destroyed its opponents with 173 points.
The closest scorer was Cal State-Los Angeles,
which finished with 91 points.
The weight squad helped the men's team to
a victory by providing an early cushion of 90
points. Junior co-captain Dave Popejoy set the
stage for the rest of his teammates by opening
the hammer with a comfortable first-place
toss of 223'3".
"I believe that we didn't take the team to a
victory this weekend but we set the stage for
it. The team as a whole came together and
produced," he said.
Other impressive performances came from
freshman Pete Swanson, with a first-place
shot put throw of 57' 3/4" followed by senior
Matt Karsevar with 55' 9-1/4". Freshman Jeff
Buckey won the discus with a toss of 177' 3"
followed by Karsevar with a mark of 169' 6".
The weight team owes much of its success
this year to the Stanford football team, as
many of the throwers became track team
members at the recommendation of head foot
ball coach Bill Walsh.
"Without the help of Bill Walsh and the
Stanford football team by sending Pete Swan
son, Jeff Buckey, Toby Norwood, and Justin
Strand, none of this would have been possi
ble," said assistant coach Robert Weir, who is
in charge of the throwers.
After the weight team was done for the day,
the runners and jumpers were also building
up points. Some of the meet highlights came
from two freshman runners.
Brian Zmijewski, one of Stanford's top
cross country recruits won the 3,000-meter
Ml* *!•« '•»' ---m it)
steeple with a time of nine min
utes, 44.07 seconds.
Joining Zmijewski with a first
place showing was sprinter Jim
mie Johnson, who won the 200
meter in 21.33 seconds. This
mark qualifies Johnson for the
Pac-10 Championships, to be held
at Washington State University
later this season.
"This meet was a desirable
break between two big meets, the
Stanford Invite last weekend and
the Fresno Invite coming up,"
Johnson said.
"However, there were a lot of
good competitors and former
state champs in this meet as well.
But our team had many exem
plary performances Saturday
which was evident in the scores,"
he added.
Pole vaulter Jamie Marek
vaulted for 16' 10-3/4", good for
another first place showing. From
the perspective of an experienced
track team member, he expressed
excitement about this squad's
prospects.
"As a fifth-year senior, I have
never seen a Stanford team this
good at a such early stage of the
season," he said.
The women's team also provid
ed exciting results in this week
end's competition. Senior co-cap
tain Jen McCormick let the
javelin fly for a 162' 4" landing,
which easily placed her in first for
the event.
"Our women's team was really
hyped up before the meet," she
said. "I was mentally more com
petitive and prepared in this meet
than at the Stanford Invite."
Also earning a first place with a
hop of 39* 10-1/2" was junior
triple jumper Florence Adu.
"Our team displayed our
strengths and potentials for the
upcoming outdoor season. Even
though these are just previews or
developmental meets, we will be
able to do well on the big ones
coming up," she said. "I am
pleased with my performance
because I keep on improving on
my marks each week, I don't want

to stop here."
Other big performances came
from the 4 x 100 meter relay team,
which broke the tape first with a
time of 48.45 seconds. Also, sopho
more Dena Dey won the 1,500
meter in 4:36.78 while freshman
Monal Chokshi won the 800 meter
with a 2:14.21 showing.

"This was a good win for us
with many excellent individual
performances," said head coach
Vin Lannana. "However, it is
still early in the season but I was
very pleased with the victory
over BYU, who usually has a
strong track program every
year."
