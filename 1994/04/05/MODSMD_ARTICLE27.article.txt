# Offense shows signs of improvement
## Loyola series ends in split for softball 
### Randy Reback Staff writer 
Winning momentum changed
hands often during the Stanford
softball team's four-game series
against Loyola Marymount this
past weekend. After the dust
settled, each team had added
two wins and two losses to their
records.
On Friday, Stanford (3-22)
dropped the opening game of
the series 3-1, but the Cardinal
drew first blood, as sophomore
catcher Lynn Anderson drove in
classmate Amanda Renteria.
In her first appearance in the
lineup after playing with the
Cardinal basketball team this
season, Renteria went on to
knock out three hits in four at
bats.
"Amanda was really impres
sive out there," said Stanford
head coach Sandy Pearce.
"She's a valuable addition to
the team."
Despite collecting 10 hits in
the game, the Cardinal would
not score again, as freshman
starter Angela Webb suffered
the loss after allowing three
runs.
The Cardinal offense was
more potent in Friday's night
cap. Stanford took a 5-4 lead
into the seventh inning. Loyola
(6-22) fought back to tie it up,
but the game was sent into
extra innings after freshman
centerfielder Megan Mackh
gunned down a runner at the
plate.
Because of darkness, the
eighth inning was postponed
until Saturday morning. With
one out, Anderson whacked a
ground-rule double for the Car
dinal.
The next batter, junior
Caryn Okinaga, grounded the
ball back to the pitcher, who
tried to throw out Anderson at
third. The ball got away from
the third baseman, however,
and Anderson scored the go
ahead run.
"Our offense really picked
up," said Anderson, the team's
captain. "This was really the
first time this year that the

whole team got in the game and
contributed."
Webb took the mound in the
bottom of the inning and
promptly retired all three bat
ters she faced to preserve a 6-5
win for freshman pitcher Katie
Beattie.

'Our offense really
picked up. This was
really the first time
this year that the
whole team got in
the game and con
tributed.'

Webb returned to the mound
to start the next game but again
received poor offensive support,
as Loyola shut-out the Cardinal
4-0. The Cardinal also struggled
in the field, committing three
errors which led to two
unearned runs.
Freshman Summer Lee was
Stanford's starting pitcher for
the final game of the series. Lee,
who leads the team in hitting,
has joined the Cardinal rotation
this year, even though she was
not even a pitcher in high
school.
"I have been getting more
consistent with ipitching]," Lee
said. "But I can't wait until next
year when we'll have more
pitchers and I won't have to do
it."
Lee held Loyola scoreless
through the first four innings,
but in the fifth Loyola rallied to
take a 5-1 lead. The Cardinal
countered with six runs in the
sixth inning. Katie Beattie, who
had relieved Lee in the fifth,
and Angela Webb combined to
hold Loyola scoreless the rest of
the contest as Stanford earned a
7-5 victory.
"That 10-hit, six-run inning
was a good ending to a really
long series," Pearce said.
