# Lyons' pride
## Students receive accolades for community service 
### Piers Henwood 
In recognition of their outstanding community
involvement, 19 students recently received the
James W. Lyons Award for Service.
Presented last month by Dean of Students
Michael Jackson, the prestigious award is named in
honor of Jackson's predecessor, who retired in 1990
after a 17-year tenure at Stanford.
Recipients of the Lyons Award must demonstrate
a sincere desire to help both the community and oth
ers, according to Jackson, and in doing so, act as a
source of inspiration for their fellow students.
"We look for people who have given of themselves,
and want to share with others the gifts they have,"
he said.
Undergraduates Ben Bing-Yen Hsieh, Michael
David Schaal, Gregory John Martellotto and Mari
anne Kim were each recognized for their involve
ment with Spoon, the Stanford Project on Nutrition.
Hsieh, a co-director of Spoon, is currently respon
sible for the general coordination of the organiza
tion, ensuring that unused dorm food is distributed
to nearby food kitchens in Palo Alto, East Palo Alto
and Menlo Park.
Since Spoon's creation in 1987, it has expanded to
include nearly every residence on campus, and now
boasts an annual collection that totals over 3,000
pounds of food. From Hsieh's perspective, it is
Spoon's core of more than 80 volunteers that makes
this impressive output possible.

"As an organization, Spoon owes all its success to
the food salvaging volunteers, who do everything
from storing food in clear plastic bags to driving the
food to local distribution points," Hsieh said.
Wendy Hara, Rochelle Higa, Kord Honda, Eiko
Itoh, Alisa Kamigaki, Ronald Nakao and David
Tanaka were honored for their collaborative efforts
in organizing the Stanford Nikkei Reunion. This
three-day event focused on Executive Order 9066,
which resulted in the internment of Japanese-Amer
ican Stanford students during World War 11.
These seven students, all members of the Stan
ford University Nikkei (SUN), formed the commit
tee that conceptualized and planned the reunion.
They invited Japanese-American alumni to discuss
their Stanford experiences during the war, and in
doing so, attempted to heal some of the wounds
caused by racism.
Hara, a past chair of SUN, described the reunion
as "an excellent opportunity to learn from alumni,"
emphasizing that most participants seemed to come
away with individual perspectives.
"It was difficult to identify one theme that united
the whole event," she said. "There were many
important issues dealt with, and I think most people
were primarily concerned with the personal aspect of
it."
Also honored for their outstanding contributions
and leadership were Victor Madrigal, Jorge Solis,
Roopal Mehta, Oanh Maroney, Louise Grotenhuis,
Dennis Kinsey, Pipo Bui and Greg Scown.
