# Event to mourn the 'death' of humanities
## 
### Frank Guinan Staff writer 
Hoping to call attention to the "sad state" of
humanities at Stanford and other American
universities, French Prof Emeritus Robert
Cohn has organized "A Humanities and Arts
Memorial" for tomorrow afternoon.
The purpose of the 3:30 p.m. event in
Tresidder Union is to discuss the decline of hu
manistic studies and to "memorialize the great
books as well as great teachers who have been
lost" as a result, Cohn said.

Speakers will include Senior Resident
Hoover Fellow Robert Conquest, a poet and
world-renown Soviet historian. Ricardo
Quinones, director of the Institute for Human
istic Study at Claremont-McKenna College,
will also speak.
"The general atmosphere toward the study
of humanities has turned sour," Cohn said, cit
ing the slashing of the Music and Drama De
partments' budgets two years ago.
Cohn also cited the combination of the
Spanish and Portuguese Department with that
of French and Italian. All four languages have

been "crammed into one department" much to
the dismay of the faculty, he said.
Enrollment in humanities classes has also
severely declined in a short span of time, ac
cording to Cohn.
Dr. Leo Weinstein, a retired professor who
taught at Stanford for more than 40 years,
aided Cohn in setting up the event. He said that
the decline of the humanities, at least at Stan
ford, began in 1969 with the Study of Educa
tion at Stanford.
