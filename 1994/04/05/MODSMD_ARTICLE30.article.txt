# Haas Center program to aid students with honors' theses
## 
### Julie Makinen Senior staff writer 
Undergraduates interested in pursuing honors
theses with a public-service bent will now get that
chance, thanks to a new program developed by the
Haas Center for Public Service and the School of
Humanities and Sciences.
Five to 10 students will be selected this month
for the Public Service Scholars program. The
Haas Center will help the selected students locate
community-based research needs appropriate to
their academic interests, and an orientation pro
gram on basic skills and issues relevant to com
munity-based research will be held this quarter.
In addition to their departmental thesis advis
er, participants will be assisted by the Haas Cen
ter staff and Jeremy Cohen, associate professor of
communications and resident fellow at Lantana,
the public service focus house.
"The Public Service Scholars program is Stan
ford's recognition of the importance of creating
ways to make student research relevant to the
'real world' problems that face us," says Cohen.
In early September, the participants will
return to campus for Stanford's Honors College,

a three-week program sponsored by the School of
Humanities and Science and Undergraduate
Research Opportunities. The Honors College pro
vides students with room and board and enables
them to get a jump-start on their thesis work
before the academic year begins. In addition to
the regular activities of the college, the public ser
vice students will take an additional seminar
offered by Cohen.
While all honors research enriches the student,
Cohen calls public service research "value-added
scholarship."
"Students benefit from the experience of tack
ling 'real-world' research issues and policy prob
lems," says Cohen. "There is added value in that,
unlike many assignments, honors theses focused
on issues of community research needs and public
policy issues benefit the larger community as
well."
During the school year, the students will par
ticipate in a pilot program on computer-assisted
research through Libraries and Information
Resources, and Cohen plans to develop colloquia
and seminars where the public service scholars
can share their research with Stanford at large
and the surrounding Communities.
