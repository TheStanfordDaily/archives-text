# Making her mark
## New Law Review president pursues goals 
### Karen E. Heywood Staff writer 
In her aspirations to
do "a little bit of every
thing," current Stanford
Law Review President
Phoebe Yang is well on
her way.
The Stanford Law Re
view is one of the most
prestigious law journals
in the country, originally
instituted in 1948. Cur-

rent Secretary of State Warren Christo
pher served as its first president.
Yang, a third-year law student who
graduated from the University of Virginia
in 1991, has the distinction of being the
first Asian-American woman to hold the
prestigious post at Stanford.

"Asian-American women are relatively
new to the field of law," said Yang. "Lots of
doors are opening now; it's a positive thing
for us and our peers and for the profession
in general — it's important to the legal pro
fession that people who practice have expo
sure to a wide variety of people."
Yang is fast making her mark. As well as
preparing for her Law Review appoint
ment, to which she was elected this spring,
Yang spent a whirlwind summer last year
divided between internships at first lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton's Rose Law Firm
and the office of Counsel to the President
at the White House.
A native of Pine Bluff, Ark., Yang said
she was eager to work at the Rose firm be
cause "it is the oldest law firm west of the
Mississippi." Although she had no interac-


Yang
tions with the first lady, "I
thought it might be more open to
women," Yang said.
Yang said she did not hear
much of the Whitewater scandal
currently surrounding the firm. "I
was there for such a short amount
of time. . . But I did meet a lot of
great people there," she said.
Yang spent the remainder of
her summer in the Washington,
D.C. Office of the Counsel to the
President, tackling constitution
al law problems and doing "a lot
of legal research and writing,"
she said — good preparation for
her term as Law Review presi
dent.

"[The Law Review] has been a
wonderful opportunity to delve
into legal scholarship, to critically
and intrusively analyze articles
and decisions. It's much more
hands on and in-depth than in the
classroom," she said.
Yang's job includes overseeing
the administrative, editorial and
financial aspects of the Law
Review and its staff of over 25, as
well as having the final say over
the multifaceted and nationally
renowned finished product.
"It's definitely a team effort.
While the president may be the
most visible member of the review,
it involves a lot of people," she
said. "Sometimes you feel like,
'Gosh, I'm in boot camp,' but it is
very exciting, and veiy challeng
ing. It's a great chance to work
with your peers very closely and

under intense pressure."
Yang said she came to Stanford
because "it was smaller, and I felt
it would give me more contact with
faculty ... the spirit of Stanford is
very special; it is known for being
open and kind of nurturing," she
said.
Upon leaving Stanford, Yang
said she hopes to find an environ
ment in which to "feel intellectual
ly challenged, to work with people
— to do something positive for
people around me," she said, per
haps working in the private sector
or politics.
But Yang said her desire to do a
little bit of everything might catch
up with her in the end. "I can't
help thinking that when I get to
retirement I might not mind being
a high school physics teacher," she
said.
