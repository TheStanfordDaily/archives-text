# Panelists consider increases in Pacific Rim trading power

### Emily Bazar Staff writer 
Speaking to a capacity crowd at Annen
berg Auditorium last night, a former ambas
sador and a Hoover Fellow discussed Ameri
ca's uncertain future in the Pacific Rim and
concurred on the growing importance of re
lations with Asian countries.
In a talk mediated by L.W. "Bill" Lane,
former U.S. Ambassador to Australia and
Ambassador-at-large in Japan, the panelists
agreed on the importance of the Pacific Him
to both American finances and politics.
Michael Boskin, senior fellow at the
Hoover Institution, and Michael Armacost,

former U.S. Ambassador to Japan and the
Philippines, agreed that Asian countries
have recently experienced phenomenal eco
nomic growth rates.
According to Boskin, when purchasing
power parity is taken into account, Asian
countries (excluding Japan) constitute 19
percent of the world's economy. When
paired with Japan, these Asian countries
create a formidable economic and political
power force that United States policymak
ers must consider.
Boskin recognized that "because of the
nature of defense and foreign policy in a
world that has become more dan
gerous, we have adopted a view of
bashing" Pacific Rim countries.
However, Boskin rejected this
traditionally negative approach to
Asia. He maintained that percep
tions of Asian countries in the
United States have to change, if
any positive alliance with the
Pacific Rim is to evolve.
"There is an appalling illiteracy
in American public discourse con
cerning what actually goes on in
[Asian] economies. We need to
base our decisions on what actual
ly occurs," Boskin said.
Boskin foresees that if percep
tions concerning the Pacific Rim

change, there will be great oppor
tunities for America exceeding
modest trade expansion.
Armacost supported Boskin by
maintaining that Asia currently
"looms more important than
Europe."
He said he attributes the
importance of Asian countries to
several factors, including the end
of the Cold War, brisk economic
growth, the ascent of market
economies and democratic institu
tions, and its growing regional
consciousness.
Armacost suggested that the
importance of the Pacific Rim is
not only economic. He pointed out
that Asia, especially Korea, has
the fastest growing arms market
in the world and must be moni
tored because "Asia is not free of
potential conflict."

"Security will not take care of
itself. As the balance of force in
Asia has changed, we need to play
the role of balancer," Armacost
said.
He also stressed the role that
the United States can play in Chi
nese economic and human rights
issues. He encouraged a policy
without sanctions because he said
that "open markets give rise to
open politics and can promote civil
rights."
Armacost praised the President
Clinton's administration for
courting Asian leaders in an
attempt to establish comprehen
sive relations with Pacific Rim
countries.
The talk was sponsored by the
Hoover Institution, the Stanford
Alumni Association, and Ambas
sador and Mrs. Lane.
