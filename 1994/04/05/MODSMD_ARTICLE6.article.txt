# CUE to consider breadth changes
## Proposal would replace current system of requirements with three broad areas 
### Scott Van Winkle Staff writer 
A proposal to radically overhaul
the University's distribution re
quirements was handed out to
members of the Commission on
Undergraduate Education at yes
terday's meeting, the first of the
quarter.
The proposal, authored by the
commission's subcommittee on
breadth requirements, would re
place the nine current require
ments with three broader require
ments. However, the proposal did
not suggest drastic changes to the
current Cultures, Ideas and Values

program.
Under the
proposed plan,
students would
have to take
seven classes for
a grade, rather
than the nine
classes currently
required with op
tional grading.

In place of the current distribu
tion requirements in the humani
ties and social sciences, the propos
al would mandate that students
would have to take any two classes
