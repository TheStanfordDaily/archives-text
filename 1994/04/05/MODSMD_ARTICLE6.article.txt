# CUE to consider breadth changes
## Proposal would replace current system of requirements with three broad areas 
### Scott Van Winkle Staff writer 
A proposal to radically overhaul
the University's distribution re
quirements was handed out to
members of the Commission on
Undergraduate Education at yes
terday's meeting, the first of the
quarter.
The proposal, authored by the
commission's subcommittee on
breadth requirements, would re
place the nine current require
ments with three broader require
ments. However, the proposal did
not suggest drastic changes to the
current Cultures, Ideas and Values

program.
Under the
proposed plan,
students would
have to take
seven classes for
a grade, rather
than the nine
classes currently
required with op
tional grading.

In place of the current distribu
tion requirements in the humani
ties and social sciences, the propos
al would mandate that students
would have to take any two classes


Sheehan
in each field.
The subcommittee also proposed
that students be required to take
a three-quarter sequence fulfill
ing the requirements of a major in
one of the natural sciences or a
new three-quarter class which
would "introduce science to non
scientists," as subcommittee
chair and History Prof. James
Sheehan put it. This mandate
would effectively replace the cur
rent natural science, mathemat
ics and applied science require
ments.
The subcommittee report
lamented the inability of science
departments to accommodate
non-science majors. "The non-sci
entist's choice, therefore, is
between courses that are scientif
ically irrelevant or inaccessible
and those that are perhaps rele
vant and accessible but not scien
tific."
The actual structure of the
class is yet to be determined, but
the subcommittee intended the
course to replace "superficial"
requirement-filling classes which
"don't have a lot of scientific con
tent," according to sophomore
Laura Goodrich, a member of the
subcommittee.
The introductory class would
cover each of the natural sciences,
introducing students to the scien
tific method through experimen
tation and incorporating some
elements of computer science and
engineering disciplines, she
added.
The subcommittee recom
mended that CIV tracks begin
and end with the same reading
and that each track devote "sub
stantial attention" to a range of
broad cultural issues. In addition,
the group hoped that the CFV
tracks could be modified to

include elements of the current
world cultures and American cul
tures requirements.
"Every one agrees that the
current program has become
much too diverse — in
approach, in grading policy, in
work load and in quality," the
report states.

ies requirement was not incorpo
rated into the proposal because
subcommittee members could not
agree on what to recommend with
regard to the requirement.
The proposal was not expected
to meet with much opposition
when the commission takes up
the proposal next week, according
to Mathematics Prof. Brad
Osgood, a member of the commis
sion.
"I would expect that some
thing like [the subcommittee's
proposal] will be in the commis
sion's final report," he said.
Sheehan, who also chairs the
commission, was less sure, saying
it was "certainly possible" that
the proposal could be scrapped
altogether.
"We try to do what makes
sense to us, and we try to realize
the limitations" on what the com
mission can do, he said.
While student representatives
on the subcommittee —

Goodrich, senior Greg Gilchrist,
and junior Luz Herrera, the lone
undergraduate member of the
commission — agreed with most
of what was in the final report,
they will write a separate propos
al outlining where they differ
with the subcommittee's propos
al.
"A lot of things came out of the
subcommittee meeting that
didn't get into the final report,"
said Gilchrist.
He said the students will prob
ably propose a two-quarter sci
ence requirement rather than
three, while Goodrich added that
they might oppose forcing
requirement-fulfilling classes be
taken for a letter grade.
The Student Advisory Group
on Undergraduate Education —
established by the ASSU to com
plement the commission's work
— will consider incorporating
the student representatives' pro
posals in its report to the com
mission, Gilchrist said. The
report is expected to be written
this week.
The rationale for the changes
in breadth requirements was the
lack of continuity and accessibili
ty among current classes.
Osgood said the proposed
requirements "get away from
dividing the world into nine parts
. . . without any particular coher
ence."
In addition to the distribution
of the proposal, yesterday's meet
ing focused on the recommerfda
tions from the commission's sub
committee on majors.
The report consisted of a set of
criteria for an effective major,
including "coherence, some sort
of progression, and a capstone or
synthesizing experience," accord
ing to Sheehan.
The commission also agreed
that "all undergraduate programs
ought to be reviewed on a regular
basis," as interdisciplinary pro
grams currently are, he said.

Under the
proposed plan,
students would
have to take
seven classes for
a grade, rather
than the nine
classes currently
required with op

In place of the current distribu

ties and social sciences, the propos
al would mandate that students
would have to take any two classes

in each field.
The subcommittee also proposed
that students be required to take
a three-quarter sequence fulfill
ing the requirements of a major in
one of the natural sciences or a
new three-quarter class which
would "introduce science to non
scientists," as subcommittee
chair and History Prof. James
Sheehan put it. This mandate
would effectively replace the cur
rent natural science, mathemat
ics and applied science require
ments.
The subcommittee report
lamented the inability of science
departments to accommodate
non-science majors. "The non-sci
entist's choice, therefore, is
between courses that are scientif
ically irrelevant or inaccessible
and those that are perhaps rele
vant and accessible but not scien
tific."
The actual structure of the
class is yet to be determined, but
the subcommittee intended the
course to replace "superficial"
requirement-filling classes which
"don't have a lot of scientific con
tent," according to sophomore
Laura Goodrich, a member of the
subcommittee.
The introductory class would
cover each of the natural sciences,
introducing students to the scien
tific method through experimen
tation and incorporating some
elements of computer science and
engineering disciplines, she
added.
The subcommittee recom
mended that CIV tracks begin
and end with the same reading
and that each track devote "sub
stantial attention" to a range of
broad cultural issues. In addition,
the group hoped that the CFV
tracks could be modified to

include elements of the current
world cultures and American cul
tures requirements.
"Every one agrees that the
current program has become
much too diverse — in
approach, in grading policy, in
work load and in quality," the
report states.

ies requirement was not incorpo
rated into the proposal because
subcommittee members could not
agree on what to recommend with
regard to the requirement.
The proposal was not expected
to meet with much opposition
when the commission takes up
the proposal next week, according
to Mathematics Prof. Brad
Osgood, a member of the commis
sion.
"I would expect that some
thing like [the subcommittee's
proposal] will be in the commis
sion's final report," he said.
Sheehan, who also chairs the
commission, was less sure, saying
it was "certainly possible" that
the proposal could be scrapped
altogether.
"We try to do what makes
sense to us, and we try to realize
the limitations" on what the com
mission can do, he said.
While student representatives
on the subcommittee —

Goodrich, senior Greg Gilchrist,
and junior Luz Herrera, the lone
undergraduate member of the
commission — agreed with most
of what was in the final report,
they will write a separate propos
al outlining where they differ
with the subcommittee's propos
al.
"A lot of things came out of the
subcommittee meeting that
didn't get into the final report,"
said Gilchrist.
He said the students will prob
ably propose a two-quarter sci
ence requirement rather than
three, while Goodrich added that
they might oppose forcing
requirement-fulfilling classes be
taken for a letter grade.
The Student Advisory Group
on Undergraduate Education —
established by the ASSU to com
plement the commission's work
— will consider incorporating
the student representatives' pro
posals in its report to the com
mission, Gilchrist said. The
report is expected to be written
this week.
The rationale for the changes
in breadth requirements was the
lack of continuity and accessibili
ty among current classes.
Osgood said the proposed
requirements "get away from
dividing the world into nine parts
. . . without any particular coher
ence."
In addition to the distribution
of the proposal, yesterday's meet
ing focused on the recommerfda
tions from the commission's sub
committee on majors.
The report consisted of a set of
criteria for an effective major,
including "coherence, some sort
of progression, and a capstone or
synthesizing experience," accord
ing to Sheehan.
The commission also agreed
that "all undergraduate programs
ought to be reviewed on a regular
basis," as interdisciplinary pro
grams currently are, he said.
