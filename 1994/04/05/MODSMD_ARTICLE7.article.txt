# Graduate mothers face unique trials
## 
### Beth Berselli Staff writer 
A graduate woman recalls hear
ing her department chair say,
"Once you have a child, you lose
your brain." Another woman re
members a professor warning new
students not to get pregnant dur
ing graduate school.
Despite such attitudes, some
graduate women do raise families
while attending Stanford. These
women say they are concerned
about the absence of a University
maternity leave policy, the lack of
female professors as role models
and issues related to housing and
child care.
German studies doctoral stu
dent Antonia Fore, for example, is
worried that the time she has
taken off because of her pregnan
cies could hurt her evaluation by
professors. "A graduate student's
record which shows more than one
leave of absence is not viewed fa
vorably," she said.
Stanford has "no clearly de
fined maternity leave policy that

would allow mothers to attend
school half time," Fore said,
adding that mothers attending
school part time are not eligible for
stipends and scholarships.
Women comprise 31 percent of
all graduate students and 22 per
cent of them are married, but the
Registrar's Office does not compile
statistics on how many are moth
ers.
To address student concerns,
Assoc. Dean of Graduate Policy
George Dekker is forming a com
mittee that will make recommen
dations about a leave policy for
graduate students.
"It will be a leave policy not
related to academic issues, but
rather to personal issues," he said,
adding that it will include materni
ty leave.
Dekker said he hopes the recom
mendations will be completed by
either late this quarter or early
next fall. "It's something that's
long overdue," Dekker said. "A lot
of departments have their own
quite reasonable policies. It's the
absence of a university-wide policy
that I worry about."
"Most departments and schools
make a real effort to accommodate
people who for whatever reason
have to take a leave," Dekker
added.
Dependence on outside funding

sources may also prevent students
from attending school part time,
Dekker said. "We can't control out
side funding sources," he said.
Few role models
Many graduate women have
also said the absence of female role
models can be difficult.
"There are no female professors
in my department," Fore said. "It
would definitely be easier if we had
a female professor with a family,
someone who wasn't only career
oriented. I was tiying to explain
some of my difficulties to a male
professor and he just didn't under
stand. He pointed to the depart
ment's secretary and said, 'Look,
she can raise children and work at
the same time, so can you.' "
The recently published report of
the Provost's Committee on the
Recruitment and Retention of
Women Faculty at Stanford found
that women faculty at Stanford are
still more likely to be unemployed,
remain untenured, have lower
salaries and hold lower rank or
work in part-time arrangements,
Fore said.
"I think it's always a problem if
you don't have role models, but
sometimes it's an overblown con

cern. One has to deal with what one
has," said Linguistics Prof. Eliza
beth Traugott, former dean of grad
uate studies. "It's a valid concern,
but it's not a concern that should
stop one in one's tracks or otherwise
no changes will ever be made."
The Stanford Women's Needs
Assessment Report, published last

year, found that
many graduate
women feel they
receive little or no
understanding
about issues of
family and per
sonal life.
"Even after
two years with
my male advisor I

can't talk with him. In the male
world, you can't express feelings or
bad days. It's a sign of weakness
es," one graduate woman said in
the report.
A professor warned a class of
incoming graduate students
against getting pregnant in gradu
ate school, another woman said in
the report. "He wasn't saying,
'Don't become a father.' "
But Traugott said such com
ments are not necessarily ill-inten
tioned. "It is a good cautionary com

ment to make. Having children
does take up a lot of time. Some
times this advice can be construed
as discouragement," she said.
Housing concerns
In addition to concerns about
pregnancy and raising children
while in school, women graduate
students also worry about the cost
and condition of housing for gradu
ate student families.
The Escondido Village family
council was created in February
1993 to address such concerns.
"A mistake that the University
has made in the past is separating
the academic side from the person
al and family side of students,"
said Mary Lea McAnally, a doctor
al student in the School of Busi
ness who lives in Escondido Village
with her husband and their three
children.
McAnally, one of the council's
founders, said Dekker and Vice
Provost for Student Affairs Mary
Edmonds have "done a great job"
in trying to meet the needs of grad
uate parents recently.
Other housing concerns include
antiquated playground equipment,
the presence of asbestos in apart
ments and the lack of adequate

sidewalks.
McAnally said many of the prob
lems are starting to be solved.
"We've made great strides in the
past year," she said.
Plans for updating Escondido
playgrounds are underway, said
Director of Graduate Residences
Chris Griffith. "We anticipate ren
ovating 10 neighborhood play
areas. I'm hopeful we will complete
it by the beginning of fall quarter,"
Griffith said. The Office of Student
Housing is funding these improve
ments, which will cost about
$100,000.
The renovation of Escondido
housing is also progressing, said
Rodger Whitney, associate director
of student housing and dining ser
vices. The renovation is part of a
10-year capital improvement plan,
which involves spending $110 mil
lion over the next ten years to ren
ovate the older residences on cam
pus. More than $30 million will be
spent on the Escondido renovation
which is targeted to be complete by
2000 or 2001, Whitney said.
Inadequate child care?
The high cost of child care is also
a concern of many graduate moth
ers. Graduate student Elizabeth

Wahl said she pays about $1,300
per month for her two children to
attend the Children's Center of the
Stanford Community.
"The only people who can afford
daycare are people like me who
have a spouse with an outside
income source," said Wahl, who is a
doctoral student in Comparative
Literature.
The University provides free
rent and maintenance for the child
care centers on campus, said Kath
leen Sullivan, director of the Child
and Family Services Office.
"The University doesn't charge
the centers rent and it also pro
vides building and ground mainte
nance for the centers," Sullivan
said, adding that if a center did
have to pay rent, it would amount
to $112,000 per year.
But Wahl said these services are
inadequate and the University
should provide more money for the
centers to cut down on the high
cost of care.
"The University needs to provide
some sort of underwriting or grant
for the child care centers on cam
pus," she said. "Eventually, the Uni
versity is going to have to face up to
the fact that students, staff and fac
ulty really need this service."

long overdue," Dekker said. "A lot
of departments have their own
quite reasonable policies. It's the
absence of a university-wide policy
that I worry about."
"Most departments and schools
make a real effort to accommodate
people who for whatever reason
have to take a leave," Dekker
added.
Dependence on outside funding

sources may also prevent students
from attending school part time,
Dekker said. "We can't control out
side funding sources," he said.
Few role models
Many graduate women have
also said the absence of female role
models can be difficult.
"There are no female professors
in my department," Fore said. "It
would definitely be easier if we had
a female professor with a family,
someone who wasn't only career
oriented. I was tiying to explain
some of my difficulties to a male
professor and he just didn't under
stand. He pointed to the depart
ment's secretary and said, 'Look,
she can raise children and work at
the same time, so can you.' "
The recently published report of
the Provost's Committee on the
Recruitment and Retention of
Women Faculty at Stanford found
that women faculty at Stanford are
still more likely to be unemployed,
remain untenured, have lower
salaries and hold lower rank or
work in part-time arrangements,
Fore said.
"I think it's always a problem if
you don't have role models, but
sometimes it's an overblown con

cern. One has to deal with what one
has," said Linguistics Prof. Eliza
beth Traugott, former dean of grad
uate studies. "It's a valid concern,
but it's not a concern that should
stop one in one's tracks or otherwise
no changes will ever be made."
The Stanford Women's Needs
Assessment Report, published last

year, found that
many graduate
women feel they
receive little or no
understanding
about issues of
family and per
sonal life.
"Even after
two years with
my male advisor I

can't talk with him. In the male
world, you can't express feelings or
bad days. It's a sign of weakness
es," one graduate woman said in
the report.
A professor warned a class of
incoming graduate students
against getting pregnant in gradu
ate school, another woman said in
the report. "He wasn't saying,
'Don't become a father.' "
But Traugott said such com
ments are not necessarily ill-inten
tioned. "It is a good cautionary com

ment to make. Having children
does take up a lot of time. Some
times this advice can be construed
as discouragement," she said.
Housing concerns
In addition to concerns about
pregnancy and raising children
while in school, women graduate
students also worry about the cost
and condition of housing for gradu
ate student families.
The Escondido Village family
council was created in February
1993 to address such concerns.
"A mistake that the University
has made in the past is separating
the academic side from the person
al and family side of students,"
said Mary Lea McAnally, a doctor
al student in the School of Busi
ness who lives in Escondido Village
with her husband and their three
children.
McAnally, one of the council's
founders, said Dekker and Vice
Provost for Student Affairs Mary
Edmonds have "done a great job"
in trying to meet the needs of grad
uate parents recently.
Other housing concerns include
antiquated playground equipment,
the presence of asbestos in apart
ments and the lack of adequate

sidewalks.
McAnally said many of the prob
lems are starting to be solved.
"We've made great strides in the
past year," she said.
Plans for updating Escondido
playgrounds are underway, said
Director of Graduate Residences
Chris Griffith. "We anticipate ren
ovating 10 neighborhood play
areas. I'm hopeful we will complete
it by the beginning of fall quarter,"
Griffith said. The Office of Student
Housing is funding these improve
ments, which will cost about
$100,000.
The renovation of Escondido
housing is also progressing, said
Rodger Whitney, associate director
of student housing and dining ser
vices. The renovation is part of a
10-year capital improvement plan,
which involves spending $110 mil
lion over the next ten years to ren
ovate the older residences on cam
pus. More than $30 million will be
spent on the Escondido renovation
which is targeted to be complete by
2000 or 2001, Whitney said.
Inadequate child care?
The high cost of child care is also
a concern of many graduate moth
ers. Graduate student Elizabeth

Wahl said she pays about $1,300
per month for her two children to
attend the Children's Center of the
Stanford Community.
"The only people who can afford
daycare are people like me who
have a spouse with an outside
income source," said Wahl, who is a
doctoral student in Comparative
Literature.
The University provides free
rent and maintenance for the child
care centers on campus, said Kath
leen Sullivan, director of the Child
and Family Services Office.
"The University doesn't charge
the centers rent and it also pro
vides building and ground mainte
nance for the centers," Sullivan
said, adding that if a center did
have to pay rent, it would amount
to $112,000 per year.
But Wahl said these services are
inadequate and the University
should provide more money for the
centers to cut down on the high
cost of care.
"The University needs to provide
some sort of underwriting or grant
for the child care centers on cam
pus," she said. "Eventually, the Uni
versity is going to have to face up to
the fact that students, staff and fac
ulty really need this service."


Dekker
A graduate woman recalls hear
ing her department chair say,
"Once you have a child, you lose
your brain." Another woman re
members a professor warning new
students not to get pregnant dur
ing graduate school.
Despite such attitudes, some
graduate women do raise families
while attending Stanford. These
women say they are concerned
about the absence of a University
maternity leave policy, the lack of
female professors as role models
and issues related to housing and
child care.
German studies doctoral stu
dent Antonia Fore, for example, is
worried that the time she has
taken off because of her pregnan
cies could hurt her evaluation by
professors. "A graduate student's
record which shows more than one
leave of absence is not viewed fa
vorably," she said.
Stanford has "no clearly de
fined maternity leave policy that

would allow mothers to attend
school half time," Fore said,
adding that mothers attending
school part time are not eligible for
stipends and scholarships.
Women comprise 31 percent of
all graduate students and 22 per
cent of them are married, but the
Registrar's Office does not compile
statistics on how many are moth
ers.
To address student concerns,
Assoc. Dean of Graduate Policy
George Dekker is forming a com
mittee that will make recommen
dations about a leave policy for
graduate students.
"It will be a leave policy not
related to academic issues, but
rather to personal issues," he said,
adding that it will include materni
ty leave.
Dekker said he hopes the recom
mendations will be completed by
either late this quarter or early
next fall. "It's something that's
long overdue," Dekker said. "A lot
of departments have their own
quite reasonable policies. It's the
absence of a university-wide policy
