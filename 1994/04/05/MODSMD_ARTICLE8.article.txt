As a mother of three and a
doctoral student in German
Studies, Antonia Fore deals
with these unlikely combina*
tions on a daily basis. Fore's days
are hectic, without a moment to
spare.
On a typical day, she will get
up about 6:30 a.m. The next few
hours are a constant bustle of
activity at the Fore house in Palo
Alto. Fore wakes up her children
— her two sons, Matthias and
Mischa, are six and four and her
daughter Katharina is six months
old — then feeds them breakfast
and packs their lunches.
8:15 a.m. finds Fore dropping
off Matthias at his elementary
school, and Mischa and Kathari
na at daycare. The two children
attend the Stanford Arboretum
Children's Center, near the Stan
ford Hospital.
Fore then heads to Green
Library, where she holes up in a
carrel and works on her disserta
tion, which she hopes to complete
by June 1995. It deals with the
dynamics of women's friendship
in German literature since the
19605.
After grabbing a quick lunch,

Fore picks up Matthias about
2:15 p.m. and drives him to his
afternoon lessons. He attends
classes offered by the Palo Alto
Recreation Department, includ
ing "Bugology" and "Explore
Your Way with Clay."
After class Fore stops at the
grocery store or runs other
errands, then picks up Mischa
and Katharina from child care.
The family arrives home by
5:30 p.m. and Fore prepares din
ner while the kids watch a movie
or play outside. Baths, homework
and bedtime stories follow din
ner.
"The responsibility of raising
the children is very much on me
and that is difficult," Fore said,
adding that her husband's
demanding law career prevents
him from helping around the
house very much. "I don't get
much sleep," she said.
After the kids are in bed, Fore
completes various chores around
the house and does additional
work on her dissertation. "On a
good day I have about seven
hours free for my dissertation,
but that doesn't always work
out," she said, adding that gradu
ate students without children

may have much more time avail
able for study.
Many of her fellow graduate
students have no idea what it
means to be a mother and a grad
uate student, Fore said. "It would
also be easier if I wasn't the only
graduate student mother in my
department."
Fore, originally from Ger
many, attended college in Berlin
and then came to Stanford in
1985 for graduate school. She
was married in 1987.
"The first time I was pregnant
everyone was excited and thought
it was great," she said. "By the
second time, some people started
to wonder if I was serious about
graduate school."
To help cope with the com
bined responsibilities of moth
erhood and graduate school,
Fore formed the Graduate Stu
dent Mother Support Group
two years ago. About seven
graduate mothers meet weekly
to discuss "how you balance the
various roles of graduate stu
dent, mother, wife and house
wife," Fore said. The group
meets at Cowell Student Health
Center with two professional
facilitators.
