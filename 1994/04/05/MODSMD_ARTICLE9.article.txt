# Broken strut cripples Dish
## Snapped cable topples 13,000-pound tripod 
### Jose J. Gutierrez Staff writer 
Instead of gathering radio waves for
scientific examination, the Dish is gath
ering dust as it lies nose first in the
ground after a cable in the support mech
anism snapped last month.
SRI International workers examining
the Dish's antennae March 18 were at
tempting to lower the 13,000 pound tri
pod mechanism — the part with the an
tenna that extends out in front — when
the cable holding the mechanism broke.
All three of the Dish's legs also buck
led, said SRI Program Manager Mike
Cousins. In addition, the upper leg punc
tured the Dish's surface, breaking some
struts.
Cousins said repairs will probably
begin in a month, and could take as long
as three months to complete. Until then,
admirers of the Dish must wait to see the
monument back on its feet.
"Chances are pretty good that we will
get the Dish fixed," Cousins said. "But
we've also gotten cost estimates to re
move the Dish. But no one's very happy
about that idea."
The cable that snapped is 24 years old,
Cousins said, and its "strands began to
fray."
Although the cable was examined pe
riodically, it was never replaced because
the deteriorating area was "not accessi-

ble, and it was not obvious there
was a problem there," Cousins
said, adding that he has since
learned that the correct proce
dure is to replace the cable peri
odically.
"Everyone who ever raised the
tripod wondered what it would be
like if it were to fall," Cousins
added. "They found out the hard
way, but fortunately no one was
injured."

Currently the Dish is not read
ily movable because part of the
tripod is dragging on the ground.
Cousins said it will require two
cranes to lift the tripod, and that
SRI and Starlab are working on
the "most expeditious way" to fix
the Dish. Presently, SRI is still in
the process of obtaining cost esti
mates, and Cousins would not
name figures.
Cousins said they are current
ly "We are trying to build up its
clientele," he said. "It's kind of
complicated to figure out who
pays. We believe our insurance
will cover part, but there's a very

large deductible, and there's also
a question of it being partly gov
ernment property."
The fall has delayed one signif
icant experiment and other work
at Starlab, according to Cousins.
In fact, he said, the accident took
place when staff members were
preparing the Dish for use in cali
brating satellites.
"At first, it's like a stroke," he
said of the accident. "Like when a
member of your family tells you
he has cancer. The Dish has been
an important symbol and influ
ence in the lives of many people,
especially at Starlab."
