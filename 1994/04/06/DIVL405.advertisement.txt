Storm drains in parking lots flow into local creeks and
then to the San Francisco Bay without treatment. Water
runoff from parking lots carries pollutants to storm
drains. Leaving used batteries in parking lots, washing
cars in parking lots, or disposing used motor oil down a
storm drain can significantly threaten the Bay's
ecosystem.

• Check for leaks under your car. Regular service
helps prevent fluid leaks and reduce air emissions.
• Change fluids carefully to avoid spills to the ground.
Place a drip pan under your car. If a spill occurs, wipe
it up or use absorbent.
• Do not leave empty oil containers in parking lots or
near storm drains.
• Recycle antifreeze by taking it to a gas station or
collection center. Also, recycle car batteries and
used motor oil at the Palo Alto Hazardous Waste
Collection Center (329-2495)
