# Waiting for the Bell
## Construction of new Taco Bell in Tresidder delayed again 
### Kevin Wack Staff writer 
Students anxiously awaiting the opening of
Taco Bell in Tresidder Union will have to wait
even longer as the franchise will probably not
open until students have headed home for the
summer.
Construction of the Taco Bell — originally
slated to open in January, then postponed until
late March — may not begin for another six to
eight weeks, according to Tresidder Associate
Director Jeanette Smith-Laws.

Tresidder Director Bobbi Braden said con
struction is contingent on the University ob
taining a building permit from Santa Clara
County. Braden said she expects that process,
which normally takes four to six months, to be
expedited quickly by the county.
"We're hoping that we'll be able to get a
building permit quite a bit sooner than nor
mal," she said. "All of that has now been short
ened, but we don't know by how much."
But Smith-Laws, who is handling planning
for construction of the restaurant, later esti
mated that the permit process could take a

month to six weeks. Tresidder officials can not
even request the permit until it consolidates
Taco Bell's blueprint for the restaurant with
the University's drawing of the layout of the
proposed site, to be situated near the recreation
center.
Smith-Laws speculated that the Taco Bell
will be completed about six weeks after con
struction begins.
Ideally, according to Braden, the restaurant
could open sometime in late May, giving stu-
dents at least a taste of Taco Bell
before summer vacation. But the
only thing that Tresidder admin
istrators would guarantee is that
construction will begin before the

end of spring quarter.
"It will be started before school
is out," Smith-Laws said. "How far
along we are by then depends on
when we get the permit. We can
only speculate."
After a meeting with Taco Bell
designers yesterday, Tresidder
officials have two sets of architec
tural drawings. Smith-Laws esti

mated it will take two weeks to
consolidate the two sets, after
which Tresidder officials will
request the building permit. In the
meantime, crews will begin knock
ing out walls to speed up the con
struction process.
Original delays in the plan were
the result of personnel changes at
Tresidder. Former Associate Direc

tor Paul Szczesiul handled the
Taco Bell account until his Jan. 21
departure.
After Szczesiul left, Braden took
over the project and discovered
that the architectural drawings for
the project were incomplete.
Tresidder's drawings, finally com
pleted about three weeks ago, had
delayed the application for a per

mit.
Braden denied a published
report that hang-ups in determin
ing the ownership and operation of
the franchise were causes for the
delay in opening the franchise.
Although details have been worked
out only recently, they have had no
effect on the project's timetable,
according to Braden. Bon Appetit's

ownership of the Taco Bell fran
chise was determined last summer,
she said.
Once the restaurant is complet
ed, it will offer at least 14 items
from the regular Taco Bell menu,
according to Bon Appetit general
manager Mary Clark. It is sched
uled to stay open for business until
2 a.m.
