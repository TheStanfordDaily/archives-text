Exiled leaders return
JERICHO, Occupied West Bank (AP)
— The first exiled leaders of the Pales
tinian uprising allowed to return home
got a tumultuous hero's welcome yester
day in the occupied territories.
The returning exiles will help build an
autonomy government in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip and try to dispel percep
tions among Palestinians that the his
toric Israel-PLO peace accord has failed
to bring change.
"People are seeing some changes with
their own eyes now. This has had more
impact on the people than months of
negotiations," said Saeb Erekat, a senior
PLO figure in the occupied territories.
At the crossing from Egypt to the Gaza
Strip at Rafah, hundreds of youths wav
ing the black, red, white and green Pales
tinian flag carried 23 returnees on their
shoulders to waiting cars. Gunmen from
the PLO's Fatah Hawks fired into the air.
Palestinian officials said 26 other
exiles crossed into the West Bank over
the Allenby Bridge from Jordan.
PLO chairman Yasser Arafat Jordan,
to hold talks with King Hussein, described

Israel's decision to let the deportees return
as "another positive signal."
Serb violence continues
SAItAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP)
— Hundreds of civilians fled burning vil
lages yesterday ahead of Bosnian Serb
troops who breached defense lines around
the Muslim enclave of Gorazde. U.S. offi
cials said there were no plans to come to
the aid of the besieged area.
Serb forces were two miles from the city
center and attacks were continuing, U.N.
sources in Belgrade and Sarajevo said.
Kris Janowski, a spokesman for the
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in
Sarajevo, estimated that 1,500 to 2,000
refugees had fled into Gorazde from a
dozen surrounding villages south and
southeast of the city.
Officials in the Muslim-dominated
Bosnian government called the situation
critical for the besieged eastern area, which
was declared a U.N. "safe zone" last May
but has been unprotected by U.N. troops .
U.N. aid workers said 52 civilians had
been killed and 249 wounded in a week of
heavy fighting.
