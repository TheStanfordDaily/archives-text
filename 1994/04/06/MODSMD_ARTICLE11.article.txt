# Justice Blackmun to retire in June
## Clinton to get second Supreme Court appointment opportunity 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Supreme
Court Justice Harry A. Blackmun,
author of the landmark Roe vs. Wade
decision that legalized abortion nation
wide 21 years ago, is retiring, govern
ment officials said.
The officials, speaking on condition
of anonymity, said last night that Black
mun, 85, will announce his plans today
to retire after the court's 1993-94 term
ends in late June.
The departure of Blackmun, the
court's staunchest liberal, gives Presi
dent Clinton his second opportunity to
make a high court appointment. Clinton
named Ruth Bader Ginsburg to the
court last year.
Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt and
outgoing Senate Majority Leader
George Mitchell are prominently men
tioned as possible Blackmun successors.
Other possible nominees included
federal appellate Judges Richard Arnold
of Arkansas and Stephen Breyer of Mas
sachusetts, a finalist before Ginsburg
was picked; Justice Department official
Walter Dellinger; and federal trial
Judge Jose Cabranes of Connecticut.

There seemed to be some White
House interest in a Supreme Court
appointment for New York Gov. Mario
Cuomo last year, but Cuomo said he
wasn't interested.
Speculation about Blackmun leaving
the court had been rampant for
months. But friends of the justice sug
gested only last week that, in good
health and high spirits, he was consid
ering extending his judicial career for
another year.
Blackmun's high court tenure was
marked by his role in the 1973 abortion
decision and subsequent abortion rul
ings. His authorship of Roe vs. Wade
made him one of the most vilified
Supreme Court members in history,
though he remains a hero to proponents
of legalized abortion. He also said
recently he no longer would vote to
uphold the death penalty.
President Clinton, as he left Char
lotte, N.C., last night, said he had not
talked to Blackmun. "As I understand
it, he has an announcement to make
tomorrow so I think we should let him
make it,"the president said.

Last time, Clinton took three months
before choosing Ginsburg as a successor
to the retired Byron R. White.
Abortion opponents said their satis
faction over Blackmun's pending depar
ture was tempered by the knowledge
that Clinton would nominate someone
with similar views.
"I have no doubt that the person
Clinton appoints will be as rabidly pro
abortion as he is," said Garnett Biviano,
president of the Pennsylvania Pro-Life
Federation.
Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio,
called Blackmun "the conscience of the
court. Although he is a soft-spoken man
of few words, many of his decisions have
had enormous impact."
Metzenbaum, a liberal who himself is
retiring at {hp end of the year, called
Blackmun's opinion in Roe vs. Wade "a
legacy to all women."
Blackmun, the court's senior mem
ber, has served for 24 years since he was
appointed in 1970 by President Richard
M. Nixon. Though a lifelong Republi
can, Blackmun built a reputation as one
of the court's most liberal members.
