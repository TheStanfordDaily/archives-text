Administrators must be
consistent in showcasing
commitment to diversity

Minority students should
not feel compelled to demon
strate against a university
administration that pledges strong
commitment to minority issues.
Yet last Friday, they did.
Outside the University's Gradu
ate Minority Admit Weekend, about
40 students held ominous signs and
distributed fliers, voicing their dis
satisfaction with the administra
tion's attention to minority issues.
Their general discontent was
spurred on by the recently
announced layoff of Cecilia Burcia
ga, the University's highest-ranking
Chicana administrator and a Stan
ford employee of 20 years.
But a layoff in a time of budget
cuts should not alarm students so
much. And Burciaga even suggested
that her position as associate dean of
Students Affairs could be eliminated.
However, the validity of the stu
dents' demonstration comes from
making a distinction between posi
tion and person. The position of an
associate dean could have very well
been dispensable. And other resident
fellows can be found. What will be
more difficult to replace is the per
son, her years of experience and the
commitment she showed to the Chi
cano community at Stanford.
For the student protesters,
though, this person represented
something greater than the sum of
her positions — a mentor, role model
and a link between them and the
University.
And even though the Burciagas

offered to stay on for another year as
Casa Zapata's RFs, the University
turned them down and did not offer
her any other role in the University.
The loss, then, is felt not as a nec
essary administrative cut, but as a
suspect move by a University that
seems to speak louder than it acts on
minority issues.
The University has recently dis
covered a glaring need to improve
minority graduate student recruit
ment and retention. Last year,
Provost Condoleezza Rice formed a
committee to explore and address
the University's poor record on this
issue after finding Stanford was
falling short of its goals. University
administrators consistently main
tain that they strongly support the
campus ethnic centers.
These moves alone, however, are
not demonstrative of "commitment"
to diversity and minority issues.
Burciaga's layoff projects a hostility
toward minority issues, that,
whether perceived or real, will be
detrimental to any University plans
to increase minority recruitment or
promote diversity.
If Stanford pledges firm commit
ment to minority issues and increas
ing minority graduate enrollment, it
needs to demonstrate it in more than
committees and reports that urge
diversity — because while commit
tees and reports are beneficial, it is
the people in this institution who ulti
mately create the climate of campus.
As an institution that professes to
encourage and seek diversity in
excellence, Stanford needs to con
vince the campus community in a
more consistent and forthright man
ner, with both words and actions,
that it is sincere in its commitment.
Leaving room for doubt will only
undermine its efforts to pursue its
own goals and will quickly inspire
hostility in those it claims to support.
