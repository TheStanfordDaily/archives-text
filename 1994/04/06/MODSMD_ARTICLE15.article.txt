## Romance in the classroom 
### 
FALL QUARTER I dreaded going to
one of my small seminar classes.
Not because it was boring or diffi
cult, not even because of that one person
sitting in the corner whose hand always
shot up when the professor asked, after a
two-hour lecture, "Any questions?"
No, what struck fear into my heart
was the enamored couple who always sat
conspicuously close to each other, hold
ing hands, cuddling and exchanging kiss
es.
And the more I tried to avoid them,
the more likely I would end up right
across the table from them, just close
enough to feel the spray of spittle as they
lip-mashed. If I was lucky, I could
maneuver behind them, and just have to
see their lost-in-space grins in profile as
they turned to gaze into each' other's,
eyes.
And every week, as I tried to hold my
lunch down as the pair nuzzled each
other's necks, I realized I was fighting a
losing battle. My only hope was that,
before the end of the quarter, they would
have a hideously ugly breakup, and I
could then relish the sight of the former
lovebirds sitting as far across the room
from each other as possible. Maybe one
of them would even drop the class and
end up on academic probation. Call me a
cynic. Call me cold-hearted. Just don't
call me romantic.
I passed the time in class glaring at
their unseparated backs (together, they

occupied a chair and-a half) having glori
ous visions of the Big Fight. She would
go to Flicks with some sexy internation
al student. He would tell her he never
loved her anyway. They would exchange
nasty e-mails.
As we entered into midterm week, my
visions for this terrible split became
more grandiose, and the couple was tak
ing up less and less chair space. Visions
of "Fatal Attraction" were floating
through my mind as the snuggle bunnies
shared a textbook, both hands clasping
the same highlighter.
That was it. If I had to watch one
more sweet nothing whispered into a
smitten ear, I was going to drop the
class.
All right, so maybe I am harboring
just a wee bit of bitterness, but it's only
because I'm living proof Stanford dat
ing is a myth. Some may cry "sour
grapes," but I prefer to call myself a
realist. In fact, when I was taking the
aforementioned class, I was, in a rare
instance, actually kind-of-sort-of dating
someone (a non-Stanfordite — the myth
still holds true for me, anyway). No, the
real reason for my lack of tolerance for
blatantly-in-love couples is that I just
seem to be missing a romantic-ness
gene.
I never cried during "Beauty and the
Beast," even though my ex-boyfriend
bawled great big tears and shamelessly
allowed his nose to run like a faucet. In

fact, I couldn't resist yelling out, "Eeew.
He's ugly," when the Beast turned into a
prince. "Killjoy!" somebody in the the
ater yelled back.
Maybe my cynicism can be traced back
five-plus years, to the first real gift I ever
received from my first real boyfriend — a
goldfish with some deadly ailment that
killed our entire fish tank. I got dumped
a month later. It wasn't the best intro
duction to romantic love.
In fact, I didn't drop the class, even
though I had to tolerate watching many
more class-time snuggle sessions. Even
tually, I had to come to terms with the
fact that the love that these two people
shared was far more powerful than my
petty ill-wishes.
So, since that couple is probably read
ing this in a shared Daily and a shared
chair in yet another class they scheduled
together, I want to apologize for my
skepticism about their mutual affection
and the big "L" in general. Maybe some
day, I'll figure out their secret and wal
lowing in cynicism will be a thing of the
past.
It'd better be a damn good goldfish.

Angle is looking forward to resuming her
non-dating career when she returns to
Stanford from Oxford in the fall.
