## Termination of Burciaga is loss to entire community 
### 
EVER SINCE the news of Cecilia
Burciaga's dismissal came out
last week, I have talked to peo
ple whose reactions range from anger
to sadness. But, invariably they
express some version of the following
judgment: "You just don't treat people
that way." It's a simple and intuitive
judgment, but it assumes that certain,
equally simple values like respect and
fairness, are in place and will be
acknowledged by those in positions of
sufficient power to do the "treating"
of others.
Are we justified in our assumption
that such values are in place? To
answer this question we need to know
what happened, why it happened and
what it means. Definitive answers to
these questions can come only from
Vice Provost for Student Affairs Mary
Edmonds, Provost Condoleezza Rice
and President Gerhard Casper.
We are told that there are bud
getary reasons for Cecilia's dismissal.
But, this is really not an explanation
at all. According to which budgetary
calculus has this action been taken? Is
the University too poor to retain
Cecilia, just not enough money to go
around? Or is it too rich, so stuffed
with resources of the mind and spirit

that it can afford to let some of it go?
Until we are told which calculus the
University is using, we cannot under
stand its action. But, while we wait
for this explanation, we can report to
the administration how their action
appears to us, namely who and what
they seem to have dismissed, and how
they did it.
First of all, and most unarguably,
Cecilia Burciaga, the individual, has
been dismissed.
Burciaga has been many things in
her 20 years at Stanford: associate
provost, associate dean, resident fel
low. She is now the highest ranking
Chicana administrator at Stanford;
she has always been a truth teller and
a public voice of conscience. She is
that rare person who never forgets
that whenever people get together (for
a class, a conference, a dinner, or —
yes — even a budget meeting) their
deepest purpose is to reaffirm their
common belonging, and the mutual
respect this enjoins. Burciaga has a
way of calling us back from our busy
ness, and reminding us why we are
really here. She is, in other words, a
teacher.
This should not be dismissed.
Second, Casa Zapata, the Chicano

theme house where Cecilia and her
husband, painter and writer Tony Bur
ciaga, have been RFs for nine years, is
being dismissed. Anybody who has
been to Zapata knows that something
powerful and transforming is going on
here. The walls are covered with
murals, and the once inert corridors
and dining halls have become sites of
memory, imagination and vision.
Cecilia and Tony don't let their res
idents forget that their real business
at Stanford is not learning how to
make a good living but how to make a
good life, one of commitment and
responsibility. And, they insist, you
can start living that life right now.
Why wait?
Start with the people who work in
the kitchen. They are here with you.
That's your serious purpose: to figure
out how to be together with respect and
dignity. Casa Zapata is more than one
dormitory; it is a model community. It
is an example for all of us, a measure, a
template, a guide. A learning place.
This should not be dismissed.
Finally, what does it mean for the
University to dismiss so precipitously
both Cecilia and the Zapata she and
Tony have made? Has the budget-boat
suffered such a sudden, unexpected

leak that bodies have to be pitched to
keep the whole craft from going
under? You just don't treat people like
that — unless the boat is sinking. You
don't tell somebody who has been an
inspiring mentor, administrator and
community leader for 20 years that
she has to clear out in three months.
And Tony, who is not paid by Stan
ford, but for more than 10 years has
been our most literal "artist in resi
dence," and who has taught hundreds
of undergraduates to paint, Tony too
can pack up his paints and take off.
You just don't treat people like
that. And you don't dismiss what they
have accomplished and everything
they stand for. Not unless you want
to announce to the entire community
that there are certain values, certain
principles, certain actions you think
the University can live without. Stan
ford dismisses too much when it dis
misses Cecilia and Tony. It sends
away two of our best voices, two of
our most imaginative minds, two of
our most generous spirits. Are we so
rich or so poor that we can afford
that?

keep the whole craft from going
under? You just don't treat people like
that — unless the boat is sinking. You
don't tell somebody who has been an
inspiring mentor, administrator and
community leader for 20 years that
she has to clear out in three months.
And Tony, who is not paid by Stan
ford, but for more than 10 years has
been our most literal "artist in resi
dence," and who has taught hundreds
of undergraduates to paint, Tony too
can pack up his paints and take off.
You just don't treat people like
that. And you don't dismiss what they
have accomplished and everything
they stand for. Not unless you want
to announce to the entire community
that there are certain values, certain
principles, certain actions you think
the University can live without. Stan
ford dismisses too much when it dis
misses Cecilia and Tony. It sends
away two of our best voices, two of
our most imaginative minds, two of
our most generous spirits. Are we so
rich or so poor that we can afford
that?
