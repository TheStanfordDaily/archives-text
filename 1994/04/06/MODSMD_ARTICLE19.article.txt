## New telescope promises better picture of the universe Scientists utilize new techniques in building structure 
### Michael Slemmer Editorial staff 
Stanford physicists will now be able to
view the heavens with a great deal more
clarity using a telescope now under con
struction in Texas.
The device's reflecting mirror will be
the largest anywhere in the world —
despite the fact that, at about $10 mil
lion, it has cost approximately ten times
less to build than the smaller Mount
Palomar observatory.
This cheaper price tag is the direct
result of computer technology employed
in the construction and operation of the
device, according to Physics Prof. Roger
Romani, who is one of the department
members associated with the project.
Along with Stanford — which acted as
a minor partner in the project — funding
was provided by Penn State and the Uni
versity of Texas, among other colleges.
"In general, the cost of the telescope
grows with the mass of the mirror,"
Romani said. In order to bypass these
costs, the device was designed using tech
nology pioneered in building the Keck

telescope in Hawaii.
Rather than grinding one large mirror
to make the 10-meter diameter reflective
surface necessary for the project,
Romani said the physicists used 91
smaller hexagonal mirrors, arranged so
that they fit together to make one large
area.
However, such a design presents prob
lems — most notably the fact that the
individual mirrors might be difficult to
align perfectly to bring the distant
starlight to a focus.
In order to circumvent this difficulty,
Romani said the physicists built a tall,
narrow tower next to the building that
houses the telescope itself.
The reflecting mirror, comprised of
the hexagonal pieces, is shaped as a por
tion of a sphere. The top of the tower
would be the center of the sphere. By
placing a laser at the top of the tower,
scientists can align the mirrors by bounc
ing light off each of them to ensure they
are angled in the right direction. Com
puters can be employed to align each
mirror with small

motors under the
telescope.
"Through soft
ware engineer-

ing, we can compensate for the small
variations introduced by the multiple
mirrors," Romani said, adding that,
through this technology, even larger
telescopes might be built in the future
and still remain economical.
The second major engineering prob
lem confronted in the device's construc
tion was devising a support structure
that could handle the weight of so many
mirrors.
According to Romani, two tactics were
employed in solving this difficulty —
lightening the load on the structure and
decreasing the telescope's range of move
ment.
The scientists installed a "tracker" on
a frame above the reflecting mirrors,
containing two correcting lenses like
those used in the Hubble telescope and a
number of devices to measure the incom
ing light.
But unlike a traditional telescope, the
large spectroscopes which would usually
be mounted on the tracker are stored in
the basement beneath the building.
Romani said fiber optic technology
allows the scientists to port the light
from the top of the telescope to the
devices in the basement, lightening the
load on the support structure significant
ly.

In addition, the scientists limit-

Ed the amount of sky that

the telescope will actu-

ally be able to see,

putting it on a

rotating plat-

ter while

inclined

at ji

per -

manent 35 degree angle.
This setup, according to Romani,
would decrease the number of moving
parts, making the structure more stable,
without losing a great deatl of functional
ity. ,JT
"You would stillbe able to view essen
tially any celestial object," he said. The
only problem would be that scientists
will need to figure out when the body
they want to observe comes into the tele
scope's "window."
This problem has also been largely
averted using advanced technology.
Romani said the telescope's computer can
be programmed to take photos and mea
surements of the sky at the proper time.
In the future, students may even be able
to program the telescope to perform
observations without leaving campus.
The tracker mechanism is also mobile
— allowing the observer to follow objects
as they move across the sky throughout
the night, further minimizing the prob
lems created by the telescope's limited
mobility.
These innovations, Romani said,
allowed scientists to build a lighter tele
scope which has reduced costs dramati
cally.
The large size of the reflecting mirror
on the new telescope will make it suitable
for a variety of projects, ranging from
detection of planets orbiting around
other stars to measuring the size of the
universe.
According to Romani, the Stanford
physicists involved in the consortium
that funded the telescope plan mostly to
employ it in high-energy astrophysics —
a field which includes the study of such
objects as black holes, neutron stars and
quasars.
Though Stanford can already obtain
some observations of these objects using
a gamma-ray satellite currently in orbit,
Romani said the optical telescope should
prove a valuable addition to current
research.
One such experiment would use the
new telescope to view regions thought to

contain black holes with "companion"
stars orbiting around them.
In this case, though the physicists can
already detect X-ray emissions thought
to be the sign of a black hole's presence,
they will now be able to measure its
approximate mass by measuring the cir
cumference of the star's orbit.
Romani said this experiment requires
using an optical telescope to observe the
Doppler shift of the star's spectrum — a
phenomenon which allows scientists to
measure the star's velocity.
Another Stanford experiment, which
Physics Prof. Vahe Petrosian is current
ly pursuing, would make key observa
tions of quasars which have been "gravi
tationally lensed" by galaxies interven
ing between them and the Earth.
This phenomenon actually produces
two images of the quasar because the
light waves emanating from the distant
objects are actually bent by the galaxies'
tremendous mass.
Using the belief held by most physi
cists that quasars are some of the most
distant objects in the universe, Petrosian
is attempting to measure just how far
away they are in order to actually mea
sure the size of the universe.
In doing this, Romani said the Texas
telescope would allow physicists to moni
tor subtle differences between the two
quasar images visible from Earth. Com
bining this information with the angle
between the two paths can, through
trigonometry, generate an estimate of
the distance involved.
To perform the experiment, scientists
"need detailed information," Romani
said. "We've been a bit crippled without
such a telescope in trying to pursue these
projects."
Though the new telescope will not
clear up all of the mysteries of the uni
verse, he said it marks an important step
in increasing physicists' understanding
of these distant objects.
"For the price, we believe it's a
remarkable achievement," Romani said.

The telescope reflects light off of 91
hexagonal mirrors, arranged to make a
single reflective surface. The tower to the
left of the telescope contains a laser which
can be used to perfectly align the mirrors.
The entire mirror assembly, set at a
permanent 35-degree angle, rides on a
circular track to observe different regions
of the sky. A "tracker" device, located
above the mirror assembly, contains
devices to focus and record the reflected

Romani said fiber optic technology
allows the scientists to port the light
from the top of the telescope to the
devices in the basement, lightening the
load on the support structure significant
ly.

In addition, the scientists limit-

Ed the amount of sky that

the telescope will actu-

ally be able to see,

putting it on a

rotating plat-

manent 35 degree angle.
This setup, according to Romani,
would decrease the number of moving
parts, making the structure more stable,
without losing a great deatl of functional
ity. ,JT
"You would stillbe able to view essen
tially any celestial object," he said. The
only problem would be that scientists
will need to figure out when the body
they want to observe comes into the tele
scope's "window."
This problem has also been largely
averted using advanced technology.
Romani said the telescope's computer can
be programmed to take photos and mea
surements of the sky at the proper time.
In the future, students may even be able
to program the telescope to perform
observations without leaving campus.
The tracker mechanism is also mobile
— allowing the observer to follow objects
as they move across the sky throughout
the night, further minimizing the prob
lems created by the telescope's limited
mobility.
These innovations, Romani said,
allowed scientists to build a lighter tele
scope which has reduced costs dramati
cally.
The large size of the reflecting mirror
on the new telescope will make it suitable
for a variety of projects, ranging from
detection of planets orbiting around
other stars to measuring the size of the
universe.
According to Romani, the Stanford
physicists involved in the consortium
that funded the telescope plan mostly to
employ it in high-energy astrophysics —
a field which includes the study of such
objects as black holes, neutron stars and
quasars.
Though Stanford can already obtain
some observations of these objects using
a gamma-ray satellite currently in orbit,
Romani said the optical telescope should
prove a valuable addition to current
research.
One such experiment would use the
new telescope to view regions thought to

contain black holes with "companion"
stars orbiting around them.
In this case, though the physicists can
already detect X-ray emissions thought
to be the sign of a black hole's presence,
they will now be able to measure its
approximate mass by measuring the cir
cumference of the star's orbit.
Romani said this experiment requires
using an optical telescope to observe the
Doppler shift of the star's spectrum — a
phenomenon which allows scientists to
measure the star's velocity.
Another Stanford experiment, which
Physics Prof. Vahe Petrosian is current
ly pursuing, would make key observa
tions of quasars which have been "gravi
tationally lensed" by galaxies interven
ing between them and the Earth.
This phenomenon actually produces
two images of the quasar because the
light waves emanating from the distant
objects are actually bent by the galaxies'
tremendous mass.
Using the belief held by most physi
cists that quasars are some of the most
distant objects in the universe, Petrosian
is attempting to measure just how far
away they are in order to actually mea
sure the size of the universe.
In doing this, Romani said the Texas
telescope would allow physicists to moni
tor subtle differences between the two
quasar images visible from Earth. Com
bining this information with the angle
between the two paths can, through
trigonometry, generate an estimate of
the distance involved.
To perform the experiment, scientists
"need detailed information," Romani
said. "We've been a bit crippled without
such a telescope in trying to pursue these
projects."
Though the new telescope will not
clear up all of the mysteries of the uni
verse, he said it marks an important step
in increasing physicists' understanding
of these distant objects.
"For the price, we believe it's a
remarkable achievement," Romani said.
"We already have many experiments


Spectroscopic
Survey Telescope

The telescope reflects light off of 91
hexagonal mirrors, arranged to make a
single reflective surface. The tower to the
left of the telescope contains a laser which
can be used to perfectly align the mirrors.
The entire mirror assembly, set at a
permanent 35-degree angle, rides on a
circular track to observe different regions
of the sky. A "tracker" device, located
above the mirror assembly, contains
devices to focus and record the reflected
images. The tracker can also be moved to
follow celestial objects.

Stanford physicists will now be able to
view the heavens with a great deal more
clarity using a telescope now under con
struction in Texas.
The device's reflecting mirror will be
the largest anywhere in the world —
despite the fact that, at about $10 mil
lion, it has cost approximately ten times
less to build than the smaller Mount
Palomar observatory.
This cheaper price tag is the direct
result of computer technology employed
in the construction and operation of the
device, according to Physics Prof. Roger
Romani, who is one of the department
members associated with the project.
Along with Stanford — which acted as
a minor partner in the project — funding
was provided by Penn State and the Uni
versity of Texas, among other colleges.
"In general, the cost of the telescope
grows with the mass of the mirror,"
Romani said. In order to bypass these
costs, the device was designed using tech
nology pioneered in building the Keck

telescope in Hawaii.
Rather than grinding one large mirror
to make the 10-meter diameter reflective
surface necessary for the project,
Romani said the physicists used 91
smaller hexagonal mirrors, arranged so
that they fit together to make one large
area.
However, such a design presents prob
lems — most notably the fact that the
individual mirrors might be difficult to
align perfectly to bring the distant
starlight to a focus.
In order to circumvent this difficulty,
Romani said the physicists built a tall,
narrow tower next to the building that
houses the telescope itself.
The reflecting mirror, comprised of
the hexagonal pieces, is shaped as a por
tion of a sphere. The top of the tower
would be the center of the sphere. By
placing a laser at the top of the tower,
scientists can align the mirrors by bounc
ing light off each of them to ensure they
are angled in the right direction. Com
puters can be employed to align each
mirror with small

motors under the
telescope.
"Through soft
ware engineer-

ing, we can compensate for the small
variations introduced by the multiple
mirrors," Romani said, adding that,
through this technology, even larger
telescopes might be built in the future
and still remain economical.
The second major engineering prob
lem confronted in the device's construc
tion was devising a support structure
that could handle the weight of so many
mirrors.
According to Romani, two tactics were
employed in solving this difficulty —
lightening the load on the structure and
decreasing the telescope's range of move
ment.
The scientists installed a "tracker" on
a frame above the reflecting mirrors,
containing two correcting lenses like
those used in the Hubble telescope and a
number of devices to measure the incom
ing light.
But unlike a traditional telescope, the
large spectroscopes which would usually
be mounted on the tracker are stored in
the basement beneath the building.
