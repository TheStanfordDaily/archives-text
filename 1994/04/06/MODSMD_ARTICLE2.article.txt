# Illegal lodger awaits release
## 
### Andy Dworkin Senior staff writer 
Abdelghani Attou, the Algerian
national who spent 12 days living
in Stanford dorms under false pre
tenses without paying his bill,
may be out of jail this afternoon
and out of the country this week
end.
Attou is scheduled to be sen
tenced at 1:30 this afternoon in
Santa Clara County Municipal
Court in Palo Alto for two charges
of defrauding an innkeeper, a mis
demeanor.
Attou was slated for sentencing
yesterday but Municipal Court
Judge Gilbert Brown postponed
the proceeding to give the Alger
ian embassy a chance to pay the
$624 Attou owes Stanford. If the
money is paid, Attou will likely be
released — straight into the arms
of the Border Patrol, who will de
port him to Algeria.
Stanford police arrested the
unwanted house guest on Feb. 25,
after he lived in a Branner Hall
guest room from Jan. 27 to Feb. 7
under the alias Paul Zimmerman.
Zimmerman supposedly was a
scholar visiting as a guest of the
Political Science Department.
After an administrator at
Branner checked with the depart
ment, uncovered the lodger's lie
and threatened to confiscate
"Zimmerman's" belongings,
Attou fled without paying his bill
— to Governor's Corner. There he
presented a different alias, said he
needed a room for his parents to
sleep in, and stayed in the room
without paying for two days
before leaving.
In court yesterday, Attou's
lawyer Riccardo Ippolito said that
Attou has already served enough
time in jail for his crime and "has
definitely learned his lesson."
Attou has already spent about 30
days in jail, according to his
lawyer.
"He is ready to go back home
to Algeria. Immigration is ready
to send him back home," Ippolito
said.
When Brown pointed out that

Attou owes Stanford $624 for his
stay, Ippolito said the Algerian
embassy would likely pay that
sum. Brown, however, said he did
not want to release Attou for
deportation until Stanford was
paid, so the Algerian will spend
another night in jail while Ippoli
to tries to get money from the
embassy.
Ippolito said after the hearing
that the embassy had offered to
pay $500 to bail Attou out of jail,
so he believes they will pay a $624
fine. He said the embassy also
offered an airline ticket to send
Attou back to Algeria.
If the fine is paid and Santa
Clara County releases Attou
today, the Border Patrol will take
him into custody and begin

deportation proceedings, accord
ing to an agent with the Liver
more Sector Border Patrol. The
proceedings could take a week or
less if Attou cooperates, but could
take months if he fights the
deportation.
Ippolito said Attou was ready
to return to Algeria, and predicted
the deportation might take about
two days. He added that he does
not think Attou will receive any
sort of punishment from the Alge
rian government upon return.
The Algerian embassy could
not be reached for comment yes
terday.
The stay in Stanford's dorms
is not the only bit of chicanery
Attou has been accused of lately.
When questioned about the stays,

he initially told Stanford police
that he was "Frederick Emerson"
from Switzerland.
After his arrest, he told a
female friend that he was a medi
cal/doctoral student at Stanford
and the son of Switzerland's
ambassador to the United
Nations. The woman loaned him
$5,535, which he used to bail
himself out of jail.
Attou was then arrested
March 7 at San Francisco Inter
national Airport for allegedly
picking the pocket of a Stanford
student. Ippolito said no charges
have been filed against Attou
relating to that incident.
"He's a con artist . . . not a
very good one," the Border Patrol
agent said yesterday.
