# Geology project maps Himalayas
## Stanford scientists employ sound waves to 'see' rock layers, understand processes involved in forming mountain range 
### Bryan Johnson 
Every year, dozens of climbers
risk their lives to find out what the
tops of the Himalayas look like. But
scientists have long been more
interested in their roots, and
thanks to a new study they may
soon have some answers.
The International Deep Profil
ing of Tibet and the Himalaya pro
ject (INDEPTH) is an ongoing
effort to probe the depths of the
Himalaya-Tibet Plateau, where
India has been colliding with Asia
for more than 50 million years.
The project involves scientists
from the Chinese Ministry of Geol
ogy and Mineral Resources and a
group of geologists from several
U.S. universities including Syra
cuse, Cornell, Columbia and Stan
ford.
The data gathered by the Stan
ford portion of the project will help
scientists determine rock types and
physical conditions deep within the
Tibet Plateau, according to Simon
Klemperer, associate professor of
geophysics.
INDEPTH uses a method known
as "seismic profiling," in which
sound waves are bounced off rock
layers as deep as 150 kilometers in
the earth.
The waves are generated using
explosive charges equal to 110
pounds of dynamite, and then the
reflections are analyzed to produce
an image of the buried rock layers.
In the preliminary survey, a six
kilometer-long wire with several
thousand vibration sensors, or
"geophones," was moved along at
200-meter intervals over 100 kilo

meters to record the reflected ener
gy and generate an image.
The primary funding for the pro
ject is being provided by a $3.6 mil
lion grant from the Continental
Dynamics Program of the National
Science Foundation.
The grant will be matched by
funding from the Chinese Ministry
of Geology and Mineral Resources
and the Chinese National Natural
Science Foundation.
China's Ministry of Geology
and Mineral Resources is provid
ing a petroleum industry-type
seismic reflection crew, with a
complement of about 200 men and
50 trucks. This crew, which
includes about 20 truck-mounted
drilling rigs, is being used to
acquire the raw data.
Started in 1992, INDEPTH orig
inally was designed to test if seis
mic profiling could be feasible in
Himalayan terrain, where extreme
elevation and thin oxygen make
physical labor difficult.
It is the latest stage in a 10-year
effort to undertake deep seismic
profiling in Tibet. Another 10 years
will be required to complete the
effort, according to Douglas Nel
son, the principal investigator on
the project and an associate profes
sor of geology at Syracuse Universi
ty as well as adjunct professor of
geology at Cornell University.
The second stage of the project,
planned to begin May 15, will
extend the initial survey north by
200 kilometers.
Running for five months, it will
use larger explosive charges and a
12-kilometer array of geophones.
In addition, this stage will use

other techniques in addition to
seismic profiling to learn more
about the physical properties of the
rock within the crust.
Stanford geophysicists will col
lect a "wide angle" profile using a
second set of remotely placed
instruments to measure the veloci
ties of seismic signals from each
test explosion.
The Chinese-American seismic
profiling team will continue efforts
to produce a reflection image of the
fault along which India under
thrusts Tibet.
William Kidd, professor and
chairman of the Department of
Earth Sciences at the State Univer
sity of New York at Albany, will
head an effort to map the surface
geology along the route of the seis
mic surveys.
According to Nelson, the
INDEPTH pilot study has provided
evidence to support the theory that
India is actually sliding underneath
the southernmost part of Asia.
Another theory had made the argu
ment that the Himalaya-Tibet
plateau and the surrounding
mountainous regions could have
been formed by the force of the col
lision compressing Asia and forcing
it upward.
The INDEPTH project is "truly
a global collaboration," according
to Larry Brown, professor of geo
physics at Cornell University.
In addition to Chinese and
American scientists, German scien
tists are scheduled to join the work
this summer, and other scientists
from Canada, Britain, Switzerland
and Japan have also expressed
interest in future activities.
