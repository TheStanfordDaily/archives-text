# The 						Science Bug
## Ants' funeral processions aid in fending off disease 
### Chris Patil Staff writer 
Before I begin this week's answer, allow me
to pontificate for a moment.
This weekend, I saw several of the flowered
medians around campus laid waste by people
who cared more about their own short-term
gratification than for the long-term aesthetic
satisfaction of others. On Friday the blossoms
were there — and beautiful — and by Saturday
night they were gone.
Ironically, the people I saw plundering the
local bounty looked like the sort who would
gladly sacrifice their morning granola a couple
of days each week to save Mother Earth a few
gray hairs. But when they had to make a choice
between living up to their convictions and milk
ing trippy garlands like they saw at the Dead
show, they were willing and able to rape the
land with a vigor that would have made the
Founding Fathers proud.
Where's the science in this? It's simple: Just
like the trees in the faraway rainforests (you
know, man, like on your Greenpeace T-shirt?),
the local flora need to be harvested sustainably.
Next year there will be fewer flowers in those
areas, and if they're cut back as mercilessly as
they were this year, eventually they'll disap
pear.
So sack up and try to think beyond the
minute — because if we apply the same ethic to
our other natural resources that certain people

did to the simplest aesthetic resources of our
community, someday the minutes will run out.

Why do ants carry their dead around ?
— Radioman
A: Being an insect myself — you know, sub
human, with a hard exoskeleton — I was
fascinated by this question. I'm sure that you
too will be ecstatic to learn that ants tote their
fellows' carcasses around for several reasons.
Well, 'reasons' is probably the wrong term.
Individual ants are essentially brainless crea
tures which rely on a collective social group for
their security and survival (not unlike the
denizens of those large canvas anthills recently
erected in Wilbur Field). Ants don't have rea
sons so much as well-tuned instincts, and these
instincts are around because they help the ant
communities to survive.
Worker ants care for their community in
countless ways. They tend the larvae and
pupae, feed the queen, groom one another and
in some cases even practice a form of fungal
agriculture. They are ultimately responsible
for the liveability of their surroundings, so
when a fellow member of the nest dies indoors,
they must remove the corpse and its concomi-

tant threat of infection.
The bulk gf corpse-carrying
that humans observe, then, is sim
ple maintenance: The ants don't
want their pals' bodies stinking up
the nest, spreading disease and
attracting scavengers, so they cart
them away from the living area.
Sometimes the disposal site is in
an abandoned chamber near the
surface, but more commonly it is a
well-defined 'refuse heap' some
distance away from the nest.
The occasional worker ant ...
ah . . . retires early. Severely
brain-damaged ants, which can
attack fellow workers or feed on
the colony's larvae, are a threat to
the community's survival. These
"mis-ant-thropes" (heh) are gen
erally recognized by worker or
warrior-caste ants, summarily
executed and dragged out of town
to lie alongside the more honored
dead.
The more widely ranging out

door species of ants practice
'deportation,' whirh can be mis
taken for the funeral processions
discussed above. When a colony
moves from one location to anoth
er, or when weary workers are too
far from the nest at nightfall to
return safely, hirger workers may
carry smaller ones to the appropri
ate destination.
The 'deported' ants assume a
quiescent posture, with their bod
ies curled and their legs drawn up
in the stereotypical kills-bugs
dead™ posture. Although the car
ried ants may appear to be
deceased, they are in fact traveling
in style.
