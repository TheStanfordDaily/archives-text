## Racquetball makes run at national prominence Saved from the brink of disaster, the club sport now boasts some of the top players in country 
### Matt Johnson 
If you're looking for a game that fuses
the physical rigors of basketball with the
intellectual intensity of chess, try racquet
ball. The captain of the Stanford racquet
ball team, junior Ryan Kaltman, calls it
"high-speed chess with sweat."
"It's a sport of angles," said Kaltman.
"You have to get inside the vectors, which
Stanford's team does very well."
Last year, Stanford had no racquetball
team. This year, the Cardinal's fledgling
team has a chance to become one of the
top 10 in the nation, thanks in large part
to Kaltman's enthusiasm. Kaltman, who
was introduced to the sport a few years
ago by a friend, was reading through a rac
quetball journal last year and noticed that
two of the top-ranked collegiate players
nationwide, sophomores James Mulcock
and Elkova Icenogle, attended Stanford.
"I then looked in the campus directory
and found their names," said Kaltman. "I
thought, 'We've got a championship rac
quetball team waiting to happen, and it's
just going to take someone to make things
click.' "
Things did indeed click. The team Kalt
man created quickly drubbed some of the
best collegiate teams in the Western
region, which includes California, Nevada
and Hawaii, at three tournaments earlier
this year. The team placed third at the
UC-Davis Shootout in November, first at
the Berkeley Invitational in February and
third at the Western Regional Conference
at Sacramento, earning the team a trip to
the National Intercollegiate Champi
onships, which begin today in Phoenix,
Ariz.

Stanford's second-ranked player men's,
law student Mark Eisenhut, was not able
to attend the regional conference, and
Kaltman speculated that with him at
regionals the team might have taken first.
But at the championships this week Stan
ford will have a full, powerful team and
expects to perform well.
Mulcock, Stanford's top-ranked men's
player, is among the 10 best players in his
division nationwide, according to coach
Clyde Barker. Barker calls Mulcock a
"quiet lion," and points to his explosive
energy despite his small frame. He has
smashed balls at an alarming 180 miles
per hour, which is close to the fastest a ball
has ever been clocked.
"James has a good court sense and a
good court manner about himself," said
Barker.
Like Mulcock, Stanford's top women's
player Icenogle has grown up around the
courts. She began playing with her moth
er and brother at an early age and has con
tinued to excel at the sport. For three
years in a row in high school, Icenogle was
ranked number one in the nation in
women's junior division racquetball.
Last year, while she did not compete at
a collegiate level, Icenogle played in open
division tournaments in the Bay Area.
Based on her performance at those compe
titions, she is considered among the top
eight players regionally. Her national col
legiate status will be determined at the
championships this week.
"You would think that there would be a
drop-off in ability after James and Elkova,
but our next player is deadly also," said
Kaltman.
That "next player," Eisenhut, is the

second-ranked men's player on the team,
and became a finalist at the 1989 Califor
nia State Games in men's Division A tour
naments. The team's third-ranked player,
junior Paul Previde, has played consis
tently well also. Previde plays on a doubles
team with Kaltman, who is the fourth

ranked singles player. And freshman Josh
Galanter has quickly risen in ability to
become the team's sixth-ranked player
with a promising future.
Racquetball is typically played on a six
walled court including floor and ceiling
with two players, or four players in dou

bles. The object is essentially to hit the ball
to the front wall; it can hit any of the
walls, so long as it doesn't touch the floor
first. The simple rules are complicated by
having two madly swinging people on so

small a court and a little blue
ball rebounding around at an
average of 100 miles per hour.
"It's a sport of balance," said
Kaltman. "You're always trying
to throw your opponent off, to
trip him up."
Racquetball is actually an
outgrowth of tennis. In the
early 1960s Joe Sobek, a disillu
sioned tennis player, sawed off
the end of his racquet and began
to hit tennis balls off concrete
walls. But the sport's official
starting point was at its debut
tournament in 1968 in Milwau
kee, Wis., where Bill Schultz
became its first champion. Since
then, it has grown to the point
where most health clubs have
racquetball facilities; the sport
will be recognized for the first
time at the 1995 Pan-American
Games.
Stanford has a history of rac

quetball also, although it has
gone somewhat unacknowl
edged. Since the early 1980s,
Stanford has been able to
muster a team each year with
varying degrees of support, usu
ally less rather than more. In
1989, that support fell away
entirely, due to the departing
seniors' lack of success at find
ing heirs to the team. No one
took it over, and until Kaltman
revived it this year, Stanford
racquetball was nonexistent,
despite the burgeoning talent
available on campus.
The club sport team supports
itself through a nominal fee
from the ASSU, but its funding
is much lower than that of other
schools. Therefore, the team
makes up for their lack of
finances in other ways. Luckily,
the team was able to use the
already-existing facilities
behind deGuerre Pool and
recruited current adult national
champion John Ellis to coach
them along with Barker. All of
their balls and some of their

equipment are provided by
Courtesy Sports, a local sport
ing goods store.
"We also have a tremendous
racquetball community in which
to play," said Barker. "All of us
are very enthusiastic about the
game, which lends us energy."
The team officially practices
only on Thursday evenings, but
most of the players are on the
courts far more often than that.
They hope to obtain a nation
al ranking and play well against
last year's top teams, Southwest
Missouri State and Brigham
Young University, at this week's
national tournament, which is
hosting approximately 60
schools. They also hope to
attract more prodigious players
in the future and preserve the
life of the team.
"Other sports get far more
recognition," said Barker. "But
to be able to hit a ball going at
over 100 miles an hour [while
performing] all the other move
ments involved in racquetball
[is] phenomenal."
