## Racquetball makes run at national prominence Saved from the brink of disaster, the club sport now boasts some of the top players in country 
### Matt Johnson 
If you're looking for a game that fuses
the physical rigors of basketball with the
intellectual intensity of chess, try racquet
ball. The captain of the Stanford racquet
ball team, junior Ryan Kaltman, calls it
"high-speed chess with sweat."
"It's a sport of angles," said Kaltman.
"You have to get inside the vectors, which
Stanford's team does very well."
Last year, Stanford had no racquetball
team. This year, the Cardinal's fledgling
team has a chance to become one of the
top 10 in the nation, thanks in large part
to Kaltman's enthusiasm. Kaltman, who
was introduced to the sport a few years
ago by a friend, was reading through a rac
quetball journal last year and noticed that
two of the top-ranked collegiate players
nationwide, sophomores James Mulcock
and Elkova Icenogle, attended Stanford.
"I then looked in the campus directory
and found their names," said Kaltman. "I
thought, 'We've got a championship rac
quetball team waiting to happen, and it's
just going to take someone to make things
click.' "
Things did indeed click. The team Kalt
man created quickly drubbed some of the
best collegiate teams in the Western
region, which includes California, Nevada
and Hawaii, at three tournaments earlier
this year. The team placed third at the
UC-Davis Shootout in November, first at
the Berkeley Invitational in February and
third at the Western Regional Conference
at Sacramento, earning the team a trip to
the National Intercollegiate Champi
onships, which begin today in Phoenix,
Ariz.

Stanford's second-ranked player men's,
law student Mark Eisenhut, was not able
to attend the regional conference, and
Kaltman speculated that with him at
regionals the team might have taken first.
But at the championships this week Stan
ford will have a full, powerful team and
expects to perform well.
Mulcock, Stanford's top-ranked men's
player, is among the 10 best players in his
division nationwide, according to coach
Clyde Barker. Barker calls Mulcock a
"quiet lion," and points to his explosive
energy despite his small frame. He has
smashed balls at an alarming 180 miles
per hour, which is close to the fastest a ball
has ever been clocked.
"James has a good court sense and a
good court manner about himself," said
Barker.
Like Mulcock, Stanford's top women's
player Icenogle has grown up around the
courts. She began playing with her moth
er and brother at an early age and has con
tinued to excel at the sport. For three
years in a row in high school, Icenogle was
ranked number one in the nation in
women's junior division racquetball.
Last year, while she did not compete at
a collegiate level, Icenogle played in open
division tournaments in the Bay Area.
Based on her performance at those compe
titions, she is considered among the top
eight players regionally. Her national col
legiate status will be determined at the
championships this week.
"You would think that there would be a
drop-off in ability after James and Elkova,
but our next player is deadly also," said
Kaltman.
That "next player," Eisenhut, is the

second-ranked men's player on the team,
and became a finalist at the 1989 Califor
nia State Games in men's Division A tour
naments. The team's third-ranked player,
junior Paul Previde, has played consis
tently well also. Previde plays on a doubles
team with Kaltman, who is the fourth

ranked singles player. And freshman Josh
Galanter has quickly risen in ability to
become the team's sixth-ranked player
with a promising future.
Racquetball is typically played on a six
walled court including floor and ceiling
with two players, or four players in dou

bles. The object is essentially to hit the ball
to the front wall; it can hit any of the
walls, so long as it doesn't touch the floor
first. The simple rules are complicated by
having two madly swinging people on so
