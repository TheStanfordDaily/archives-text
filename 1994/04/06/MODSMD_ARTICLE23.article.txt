# Future's so bright
## Sailing team finds new stars in easy victory 
### Jeremy Stone Staff writer 
The Stanford sailing team got a glimpse of
the future this weekend as it coasted to a vic
tory in a regatta hosted by the St. Francis
Yacht Club of San Francisco.
When team members weren't enjoying the
club's amenities, such as free food and a
sauna, they were enjoying the fast current
and afternoon winds that contributed to
unusual sailing. Though the regatta featured
teams from Hawaii, California and USC, the
competition paled in comparison to upcoming
regattas, so coach Steve Bourdow experi
mented with different personnel.
The six Stanford teams were dominant, as
they placed first, second, fifth, sixth, ninth
and 11th. Junior Charles Meade and senior
Sujata Patel won Division A in a landslide,

though Patel was sailing in a major regatta
for the first time. With sophomore teammates
Gretchen Uznis and Sibyl Diver, who finished
second in Division B, they won the regatta.
Stanford's second place team also shined,
as skipper Rolf Kaiser, a senior, and crew
Catherine Adams-Simmons, a sophomore,
swept all five races on Saturday en route to
the Division B title. Senior teammates Scott
Sellers and Britt Johnson finished a surpris
ing second in Division A, so the foursome
placed second overall.
Bourdow, however, was most thrilled with
the emergence of Kevin Pidduck, a freshman
in his first year of sailing monohull boats.
Though Pidduck and freshman crew Don
Chennavasin placed sixth among 19 boats,
they finished in the top five in several races.
"It's unusual in that [Pidduck is] working
really hard even though all year he has really

not had a chance to be a player," Boudow said.
Now, some time next year, he'll probably be a
real player."
Chennavasin also praised his skipper. "For
us to go out and sail together for the first time
and do so well, it just shows that Kevin's a
really good skipper," he said. "If he gets more
time on the boats, he'll be a total stud."
Pidduck was reluctant to take credit for his
rise into the spotlight, choosing to praise
Chennavasin, one of Stanford's top crew
members, and especially Bourdow.
"This is a totally new thing, and I've been
learning as fast as I can," he said. After sailing
catamarans since age five, he has been able to
adapt well to the monohulls of collegiate sailing.
Pidduck's ascension into the limelight may
be put on hold in the coming weeks, however,
as Stanford prepares for the district champi
onships at the end of the month.
