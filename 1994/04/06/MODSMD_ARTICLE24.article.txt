# Walsh looks toward an improved 1994 season
## Stresses Stenstrom's passing, Mitchell's running as keys to already-potent offense 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
The Stanford football team,
coming off a 4-7 season in 1993,
began working toward improve
ment in 1994 with the start of
spring practice yesterday.
The Cardinal squad, which
struggled throughout last season
due to youth and inexperience,
begins the new campaign older
and certainly wiser. But will it be
better?
With all but five starters

returning, head
coach Bill Walsh
is optimistic.
"We're really
excited to get
going," he said
in a press con
ference Monday.
"This is a vital
spring practice
for us. We have
to come of age
during this sea
son.
"We've been

through one era. Now we're pri
marily a sophomoie team, and
we're looking to see this group
establish a character of their
own."
At the front of that group,
though, lies quarterback Steve
Stenstrom, a fifth-year senior.
Stenstrom, who set three school
and three Pac-10 passing records
last season, anchors a veteran
offensive unit. While Stenstrom is
a proficient passer, Walsh notes
that Stenstrom will hone other
skills during the spring.
"Steve should have another
great year, but it is particularly
important that he learn how to
scramble and run," Walsh said.

'We know we can
throw the ball, and
we will have the best
passing game among
the top 30 or 40
teams in the country.'

"In the past he was always looking
for a third receiver. We need to
drill Steve in exploding up the
field. That would add another
dimension (to the offense) and
give us an extra first down or
two."
Meanwhile, the majority of the
spring quarterbacking duties will
be assumed by sophomore Scott
Frost. The heir apparent to Sten
strom, Walsh wants Frost to gain
as much experience as possible.
Frost will again be utilized to run
the quarterback option on selected

downs and also
in relief of Sten
strom.
The receiving
end of the Cardi
nal's aerial game
is stocked. Start
ing receivers
Justin Armour
and Brian Man
ning return,
along with capa
ble backups
Mark Harris,
David Shaw, and

Andre Kir wan. Tony Cline will
again line up at tight end.
"We know we can throw the
ball, and we will have the best
passing game among the top 30 or
40 teams in the country," Walsh
said. "The key is Brian (staying
ii\jury-free). He's the big play guy.
Whenever we had him we were
pretty potent."
As was the case throughout last
year, the question mark on offense
lies in the running game. The Car
dinal passed on most downs not
just because of ability, but out of
necessity. Walsh is hopeful that
running backs Ethan Allen and
Greg Cornelia will continue their
late-season progress and that

Mike Mitchell begins performing
to his capabilities.
"We're looking to see Mike
Mitchell be comfortable at this
position," Walsh said. "He was
very indecisive last year, but he
looks super-quick and appears to
be ready."
Yet despite his readiness, or

that of the other backs, their suc
cess will be contingent upon the
offensive line, which is concentrat
ing this spring on run-blocking.
Defensively, anything the Car
dinal does better than last year
will be a positive, for the team was
