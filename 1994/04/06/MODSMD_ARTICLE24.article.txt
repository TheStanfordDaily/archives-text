# Walsh looks toward an improved 1994 season
## Stresses Stenstrom's passing, Mitchell's running as keys to already-potent offense 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
The Stanford football team,
coming off a 4-7 season in 1993,
began working toward improve
ment in 1994 with the start of
spring practice yesterday.
The Cardinal squad, which
struggled throughout last season
due to youth and inexperience,
begins the new campaign older
and certainly wiser. But will it be
better?
With all but five starters

returning, head
coach Bill Walsh
is optimistic.
"We're really
excited to get
going," he said
in a press con
ference Monday.
"This is a vital
spring practice
for us. We have
to come of age
during this sea
son.
"We've been

through one era. Now we're pri
marily a sophomoie team, and
we're looking to see this group
establish a character of their
own."
At the front of that group,
though, lies quarterback Steve
Stenstrom, a fifth-year senior.
Stenstrom, who set three school
and three Pac-10 passing records
last season, anchors a veteran
offensive unit. While Stenstrom is
a proficient passer, Walsh notes
that Stenstrom will hone other
skills during the spring.
"Steve should have another
great year, but it is particularly
important that he learn how to
scramble and run," Walsh said.

'We know we can
throw the ball, and
we will have the best
passing game among
the top 30 or 40
teams in the country.'
- Bill Walsh

"In the past he was always looking
for a third receiver. We need to
drill Steve in exploding up the
field. That would add another
dimension (to the offense) and
give us an extra first down or
two."
Meanwhile, the majority of the
spring quarterbacking duties will
be assumed by sophomore Scott
Frost. The heir apparent to Sten
strom, Walsh wants Frost to gain
as much experience as possible.
Frost will again be utilized to run
the quarterback option on selected

downs and also
in relief of Sten
strom.
The receiving
end of the Cardi
nal's aerial game
is stocked. Start
ing receivers
Justin Armour
and Brian Man
ning return,
along with capa

Mark Harris,
David Shaw, and

Andre Kir wan. Tony Cline will
again line up at tight end.
"We know we can throw the
ball, and we will have the best
passing game among the top 30 or
40 teams in the country," Walsh
said. "The key is Brian (staying
ii\jury-free). He's the big play guy.
Whenever we had him we were
pretty potent."
As was the case throughout last
year, the question mark on offense
lies in the running game. The Car
dinal passed on most downs not
just because of ability, but out of
necessity. Walsh is hopeful that
running backs Ethan Allen and
Greg Cornelia will continue their
late-season progress and that

Mike Mitchell begins performing
to his capabilities.
"We're looking to see Mike
Mitchell be comfortable at this
position," Walsh said. "He was
very indecisive last year, but he
looks super-quick and appears to
be ready."
Yet despite his readiness, or

that of the other backs, their suc
cess will be contingent upon the
offensive line, which is concentrat
ing this spring on run-blocking.
Defensively, anything the Car
dinal does better than last year
will be a positive, for the team was

moved into the starting lineup

season. The defensive line lost

Namely, the secondary.
Walsh is depending on sopho
more Eliel Swinton to lead a
young group of defensive backs.
Swinton will be paired with
Kwame Ellis at cornerback, but
Walsh hinted that while junior
David Walker and senior Kevin
Garnett are the incumbents at
the safety positions, he will not

hesitate to place any number of
incoming freshman recruits in
either slot.
The team needs vast
improvement from both the
line and the secondary to make
the Cardinal competitive. Bar
ring that occurrence, postsea
son possibilities for Stanford
will be marginal at best.
As for the kicking game,
both kicker Eric Abrams and
punter Aaron Mills are back.
Mills, however, suffered an off
season mishap and will not
practice, but will be ready by
Sept. 1. He tore a ligament in
his kicking knee while practic
ing with the eighth grade girls'
basketball team that he coach
es.
"It got real physical and he's
taken a hit," Walsh quipped.

began working toward improve
ment in 1994 with the start of
spring practice yesterday.
The Cardinal squad, which
struggled throughout last season
due to youth and inexperience,
begins the new campaign older
and certainly wiser. But will it be
better?
With all but five starters

returning, head
coach Bill Walsh
is optimistic.
"We're really
excited to get
going," he said
in a press con
ference Monday.
"This is a vital
spring practice
for us. We have
to come of age
during this sea
son.
"We've been

through one era. Now we're pri
marily a sophomoie team, and
we're looking to see this group
establish a character of their
own."
At the front of that group,
though, lies quarterback Steve
Stenstrom, a fifth-year senior.
Stenstrom, who set three school
and three Pac-10 passing records
last season, anchors a veteran
offensive unit. While Stenstrom is
a proficient passer, Walsh notes
that Stenstrom will hone other
skills during the spring.
"Steve should have another
great year, but it is particularly
important that he learn how to
scramble and run," Walsh said.

'We know we can
throw the ball, and
we will have the best
passing game among
the top 30 or 40
teams in the country.'

"In the past he was always looking
for a third receiver. We need to
drill Steve in exploding up the
field. That would add another
dimension (to the offense) and
give us an extra first down or
two."
Meanwhile, the majority of the
spring quarterbacking duties will
be assumed by sophomore Scott
Frost. The heir apparent to Sten
strom, Walsh wants Frost to gain
as much experience as possible.
Frost will again be utilized to run
the quarterback option on selected

downs and also
in relief of Sten
strom.
The receiving
end of the Cardi
nal's aerial game
is stocked. Start
ing receivers
Justin Armour
and Brian Man
ning return,
along with capa
ble backups
Mark Harris,
David Shaw, and

Andre Kir wan. Tony Cline will
again line up at tight end.
"We know we can throw the
ball, and we will have the best
passing game among the top 30 or
40 teams in the country," Walsh
said. "The key is Brian (staying
ii\jury-free). He's the big play guy.
Whenever we had him we were
pretty potent."
As was the case throughout last
year, the question mark on offense
lies in the running game. The Car
dinal passed on most downs not
just because of ability, but out of
necessity. Walsh is hopeful that
running backs Ethan Allen and
Greg Cornelia will continue their
late-season progress and that

Mike Mitchell begins performing
to his capabilities.
"We're looking to see Mike
Mitchell be comfortable at this
position," Walsh said. "He was
very indecisive last year, but he
looks super-quick and appears to
be ready."
Yet despite his readiness, or

that of the other backs, their suc
cess will be contingent upon the
offensive line, which is concentrat
ing this spring on run-blocking.
Defensively, anything the Car
dinal does better than last year
will be a positive, for the team was

ranked last in the Pac-10 in
most major defensive cate
gories by season's end.

The strength of the defense
should be the outside lineback
ers. Junior Jason White and
freshman Brian Batson both
moved into the starting lineup
in the second game of the 1993
season. The defensive line lost
only one starter.
"We're solid, but we're look
ing for mobility," Walsh said.
"That might have to come from
other positions."
Namely, the secondary.
Walsh is depending on sopho
more Eliel Swinton to lead a
young group of defensive backs.
Swinton will be paired with
Kwame Ellis at cornerback, but
Walsh hinted that while junior
David Walker and senior Kevin
Garnett are the incumbents at
the safety positions, he will not

hesitate to place any number of
incoming freshman recruits in
either slot.
The team needs vast
improvement from both the
line and the secondary to make
the Cardinal competitive. Bar
ring that occurrence, postsea
son possibilities for Stanford
will be marginal at best.
As for the kicking game,
both kicker Eric Abrams and
punter Aaron Mills are back.
Mills, however, suffered an off
season mishap and will not
practice, but will be ready by
Sept. 1. He tore a ligament in
his kicking knee while practic
ing with the eighth grade girls'
basketball team that he coach
es.
"It got real physical and he's
taken a hit," Walsh quipped.
Spring practice notes
Defensive end Nate Olsen,
who began his career at Stan
ford as a fullback, has been
moved to inside linebacker. . . .
Sophomore Matt Harper has

been moved from outside
linebacker to defensive end. . . .
Incoming freshman punter
Kevin Miller is expected to red
shirt. . . . Vaughn Williams, a
First Team All Pac-10 per
former who played at Stanford
from 1980-83, returns to the
Farm to coach the defensive
backs. He replaces Tom Hol
moe, who took a similar posi
tion with the San Francisco
49ers. "His mentality is going
to be very physical," said Walsh
of Williams. "He's a firebrand
type of guy, really animated."
Injury update
Outside linebacker Nick
Watts will not participate in
spring practice because of off
season shoulder surgery; Nei
ther will free safety Charles
Young, who is recovering from
knee surgery; Defensive end
Pete Swanson, who injured his
left shoulder last season, will
not participate in full-contact
workouts but will take part in
some drills.
