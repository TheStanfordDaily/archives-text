## NCAA Tourney shows best and worse 
### 
Now that college basketball
has a new national champi
on, it is only fitting to take
one last look back at the just-com
pleted NCAA Tournament. Here
were the shining — and not-so
shining — moments:
• Thumbs down to coaches
wearing sponsorship garb on the
sidelines. Seton Hall coach P.J.
Carlissiino's blue Nike sweater
vest was an unnecessary item.
After all, P.J., your players are
wearing the shoes — isn't that
enough advertising? But worse
was Arkansas coach Nolan
Richardson, who wore a Starter
pin on the left lapel of his suit jack
et and a Nike pin on the right lapel
during the national semifinal
against Arizona, turning a nice
outfit into a walking billboard.
• Worst-dressed coach: Indi-

ana's Bobby
Knight. Not only
is it tacky to wear
a red Adidas
sweatshirt on the
bench, but it only
served to high
light Knight's
ever-increasing
gut. Instead of
head-butting your
players, Bobby,

why don't you try the treadmill?
• Best responses in post-game
interviews on CBS: 1) Arkansas'
Richardson, to commentator Billy
Packer, who observed that the key
to the Razorbacks' second-half run
in their 92-81 semifinal defeat of
Arizona was getting the ball down
low to center Corliss Williamson:
"I'm glad you saw that Billy. Even
a blind man could see that." 2)
Indiana's Knight, to Leslie Visser,
who asked Knight what enabled
the Hoosiers to defeat Temple in
an East Regional second-round
game: "Well, in case you didn't
notice, Leslie, we scored more
points than they did." Score one
for Knight.
• Best tournament coach: Duke
coach Mike Krzyzewski. Seven
Final Fours in nine years. Enough
said. Incidentally, the mock Bud
Light ad with Coach K driving the
limo was sheer genius.
• Least surprising first-round
upset: Tulsa defeating UCLA 112-
102. But hey, Jim Harrick, you had
another 20-win season, so it was
successful, right? And you ques
tion why Cherokee Parks chose
Duke.
• Most surprising first-round
upset: Cal succumbing to Wiscon
sin-Green Bay. The Golden Bears'
early nosedive wrecked many an
office pool, but then again, Pac-10
team plus NCAA Tourney equals
early vacation.
• Most surprising team: Boston
College. After barely surviving
their opening game against Wash
ington State, the Eagles were only
one game shy of the Final Four,
taking out defending national
champion North Carolina and
Indiana in successive games before
succumbing to Florida. In the pro

cess, they saved Coach Jim
O'Brien's job.
• Other surprises: No. 10-seed
ed Maryland eliminating second
seeded Massachusetts in the Mid
west second round; Marquette
beating Kentucky in the Southeast
second round; Tulsa winning over
Oklahoma State in the West sec
ond round.
• Best performance: Naismith
Player of the Year Glenn (Big Dog)
Robinson's 44 points for Purdue in
the Boilermakers' 83-78 win
against Kansas in the Southeast
Regional semifinal.
• Biggest choke: Connecticut's
Donyell Marshall. In the East
regional semifinal, the All-Ameri
can junior forward had a chance to
put Florida away in regulation, but
bricked two game-winning free
throws. Instead, the teams went

into overtime
and Connecti
cut lost.
• Most
likable Final
Four team:
Florida. Lon
Krueger takes
a bunch of
kids who were
not highly
recruited to

Charlotte. Center Andrew DeCler
cq's hustle was model for all. His
enthusiasm for the game was con
tagious. Plus, how could you not
like widebody forward Dametri
Hill shooting "Da Meat hook?"
• Add Hill: CBS' Jim Nantz got
it right when he said that Hill, at 6-
foot-7 and 270 pounds, could be
the first Final Four player drafted
in the first round — by the NFL.
• Best Reggie Miller imperson
ation: Arkansas guard A 1 Dilliard,
who jacked two threes from way
out against Arizona.
• Memorable dunks: Robinson's
monster slam over Kansas' Greg
Ostertag; Arizona's Reggie Geary's
through-the-lane airborne rebound
putback against Arkansas.
• To give and receive:
Arkansas' Corliss (Big Nasty)
Williamson, the Tournament
MVP, who, after getting resound
ingly swatted by Duke's Grant
Hill in Monday night's champi
onship game, returned the favor
on the other end by forcefully
rejecting a shot attempt by Duke's
Jeff Capel.
• Mr. Endurance: Duke's Hill.
The senior All-American did it all
for the Blue Devils, playing 38
minutes and tallying 12 points and
14 rebounds (13 defensive), while
also handling the ball.
• Mr. Clutch: Arkansas' Scotty
Thurman, whose high-arching
three-pointer from the right wing
over the blanket defense of Duke's
Antonio Lang swished with 51 sec
onds left as the shot clock expired
to break a 70-70 deadlock and led
to Arkansas' 76-72 win.

hoops starts up again.
