# Spartan pitching humbles Cardinal bats
## Stanford manages only two hits, commits four errors in 4-0 humbling loss 
### Swaminatha Gurudevan Staff writer 
Just 72 hours after sweeping
away the Golden Bears and with
conference leader USC in the on
deck circle for this weekend, the
Stanford baseball team took a
backward step with an anemic
offensive and sloppy defensive
performance in a 4-0 loss to San
Jose State yesterday. The loss
dropped the Cardinal's record to
21-14 overall, while the Spar
tans improved to 19-15 on the
season.
The Spartans jumped ahead
early 1-0 on an RBI single in the
first inning by shortstop Jason
Boesch off junior lefthander
Mike Robbins. Robbins (4-3)
took the loss despite putting in
an excellent showing overall,
allowing just the one run and
only two hits in five innings
pitched.
But the story of the day was
San Jose State starting pitcher
Paul Pavicich (5-3). The junior

lefthander pitched a complete
game and allowed only two hits,
shutting down a Stanford lineup
that had been red-hot last week
end against California. Pavicich
showed excellent control, walk
ing only one batter and striking
out five, while not allowing a
baserunner past second.

'My defense just did
the job — they made
some great plays in
the outfield, my
catcher did a great
job?
— Paul Pavicich

"Today, I was just throwing
strikes, and it happened that
everything they hit was right to
someone," Pavicich said. "You

can't cut these guys down
because they're a great ball club,
and they're all great hitters."
Pavicich was also aided by an
outstanding defensive perfor
mance by San Jose State. Every
time the Cardinal would threat
en extra bases with a deep fly
ball, a Spartan outfielder would
flag down the ball and snuff the
rally.
"I had great defense behind
me and all I did was let them hit
the ball," Pavicich said. "My
defense just did the job — they
made some great plays in the
outfield, my catcher did a great
job. It was definitely a team com
bination to help out and get the
win."
In contrast to the Spartans,
the Cardinal defense put in a
sub-par performance, commit
ting four errors which proved
costly in San Jose State's three
run sixth inning. Cardinal coach
Mark Marquess also expressed
concern at his team's lack of
offensive output.

"We gave up four runs," Mar
quess said. "Normally, you've
got a chance to win a game if you
only give up four runs, but we're
not doing very much with the
bat, and that's kind of been the
story all season for us."
