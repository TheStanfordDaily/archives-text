Former Jordanian Prime Minister Zaid Al-Rifa'i
views recent developments in the Middle East as a
cause for optimism, he said during a campus address
yesterday afternoon.
Speaking to a gathering of about 75 people in
Tresidder Union's Oak Lounge, Al-Rifa'i emphasized
the recent progress that has been made in reconciling
the region's historical problems.
"Who would have predicted a year ago that the
chairman of the I Palestinian Liberation Organization |
would be invited to the White House, to stand on the

lawns and shake hands with the prime minister of Is
rael," he said.
Al-Rifa'i, who was educated at both Harvard and
Columbia, became Jordan's youngest prime minister
ever in 1973. Presently he is a member of the Jordan
ian senate, where he holds the positions of First
Deputy President and Chairman of the Foreign Rela
tions Committee.
Although Al-Rifa'i views peace in the Middle East
as realistic, he is equally concerned with the task's dif
ficulty. (Jiven the predominance of competing territo-
rial claims, "one man's terrorist
can be another man's freedom
fighter."
For this reason, Al-Rifa'i said
he believes American involvement
in the Middle East to be a necessi
ty. As the current Israeli-PLO
negotiations have demonstrated,
the United States has the ability
to act as a neutral arbitrator, a
role that "must be maintained and
developed if peace is to be
achieved."
Due to the success of the these
bilateral negotiations, Al-Rifa'i is
convinced that a major break
through has been reached. Howev
er, he approaches the peace process
concurrently with a certain urgen
cy because he recognizes that "time
does not work in favor of peace."
"The sooner the issues are
addressed," he said, "the sooner
they will be resolved."
Although Al-Rifa'i believes that
it is impossible to predict the final
outcome of current tensions, he
cited certain prerequisites as nec
essary for a durable and just peace.

He claimed, for instance, that
"Israel must accept the U.S. inter
pretation of [United Nations] Reso
lution 242," if peace is to be
reached. This accord, which dates
back to 1967, sought to define Arab
and Israeli territories, and has been
all but forgotten by current Israeli
land claims, Al-Rifa'i said.
Similarly, he argued in favor of
an autonomous Palestinian state,
adding that Israel need not fear
such a development.
Besides these specific convic
tions, Al-Rifa'i attached equal
importance to the continued pur
suit of more general trends,
including the dual emergence of
democracy and internationalism.
After stressing the correlation
between democracy and human
rights, he went on to emphasize
the interdependent nature of the
world, concluding that "all divi
sions must be within the broader,
international picture."
Al-Rifa'i ended with a balanced
message of hope and challenge,
juxtaposing the difficulties that lie
ahead with the progress that has
already been made.
"Our achievements cannot be
ignored," he said, "and their sig
nificance cannot be minimized."
