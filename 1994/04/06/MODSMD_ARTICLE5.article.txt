## Children Now founder and president James Steyer finds time to teach popular education class 
### Elizbheth Murtaugh 
James Steyer — founder and president of
Children Now, the nation's second largest
organization for children's advocacy — is
teaching a new class this quarter that will
probe today's "burgeoning children's prob
lem" in the context of trends in America's
civil rights and women's movements.
The course, entitled "Children, Civil
Rights and Public Policy in the U. 5.," is list
ed under the School of Education, and will
offer a broad analysis of "some of the great
challenges facing America in the 1990s
ranging from the need to revitalize our na
tion's schools, to the unparalleled chal
lenges facing American families and chil
dren" as well as minority groups, Steyer
said.
Steyer's background — which includes
everything from teaching second graders to
prosecuting rapists — combined with a mag
netic style of speaking has already attracted
hundreds of students.
Erika Mikkelsen, a sophomore enrolled
in the class said, "His enthusiasm is so in
fectious. He's an engaging speaker who re
captures a lost sense of idealism in a way
that makes people believe in the power of
the law."

Among the issues to be studied are
changing trends in education, affirmative
action, sex discrimination, gender and pri
vacy issues, wealth and poverty and the im
pact of violence on children in America.
Steyer, a Stanford alumnus, stressed
that the primary focus of the class will be on
discussions that explore the "real-world,
practical" aspects of problems and possible
solutions to them.
Steyer's personal interests have reflected
this emphasis on pragmatism throughout
his life. At the age of 17, after completing
high school in three years, he taught high
school in the South Bronx.
A few years later, as a Stanford under
graduate, he taught in an East Palo Alto
school. He continued his "paraprofessional"
career in education between college and law
school by teaching once again in New York
City Schools, he said.
As a student at Stanford I>aw School,
Steyer created the East Palo Alto Commu
nity Law Project — an organization that of
fers low- cost legal assistance to the people
of East Palo Alto.
The project is still running strong today,
with four full-time lawyers and hundreds of
