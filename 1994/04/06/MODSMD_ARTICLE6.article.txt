# ASSU in uniform?
## Voters to decide senators' attire 
### Jim Luh Staff writer 
ASSU senators could be walk
ing around campus clad in official
"uniforms" next year if students
approve an amendment placed on
the spring general election ballot
last night by the ASSU Senate.
The senate passed a measure
sponsored by graduate senator
Sanford Dickert that, if approved
by two-thirds of the voters in next
week's election, would require sen
ators to wear the somewhat
tongue-in-cheek garb on days of
senate meetings.
Earlier in the meeting, Provost
Condoleezza Rice addressed con
cerns from senators concerning
the University's budget-cutting
process, revealing little new infor

icism about lack of student input in
several recent decisions.
The official senate uniform will
consist of an oatmeal-colored
sweatshirt that reads on the front,
"What is an ASSU Senator?" and
on the back, "I'm an ASSU Sena

display the time and location of
meetings as set by the senate at the
beginning of the year.
Dickert admitted that the bill
had started as a joke, but he said he
thought the uniform can be a very

simple yet effec

suring senate ac
countability.
"Something
that was original

joke now seems
to be a very good
idea," Dickert
said.

The original version of the uni
form bill, proposed by Dicker! last
quarter, included a propeller
beanie as part of the uniform and
addressed readers of the shirt as
"stupid" rather than "silly." But
after consulting with other sena
tors, Dickert excised the headgear
requirement and changed the
shirt's language.
"I was informed by various sen
ators that 'stupid' was disrespect
ful of our constituency," Dickert
said.
Other senators questioned the
choice of the sweatshirt as the sen
ate uniform. But Dickert noted the
versatility of the garment, saying it
could be worn conventionally or
wrapped around the waist or neck.
In her discussion with the sen
ate, Rice presented updates on the
University's administrative and
academic budget cuts, saying deci
