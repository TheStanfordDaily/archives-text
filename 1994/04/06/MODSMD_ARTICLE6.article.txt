# ASSU in uniform?
## Voters to decide senators' attire 
### Jim Luh Staff writer 
ASSU senators could be walk
ing around campus clad in official
"uniforms" next year if students
approve an amendment placed on
the spring general election ballot
last night by the ASSU Senate.
The senate passed a measure
sponsored by graduate senator
Sanford Dickert that, if approved
by two-thirds of the voters in next
week's election, would require sen
ators to wear the somewhat
tongue-in-cheek garb on days of
senate meetings.
Earlier in the meeting, Provost
Condoleezza Rice addressed con
cerns from senators concerning
the University's budget-cutting
process, revealing little new infor
mation but attempting to allay crit
icism about lack of student input in
several recent decisions.
The official senate uniform will
consist of an oatmeal-colored
sweatshirt that reads on the front,
"What is an ASSU Senator?" and
on the back, "I'm an ASSU Sena
tor, silly!" The sweatshirt will also
display the time and location of
meetings as set by the senate at the
beginning of the year.
Dickert admitted that the bill
had started as a joke, but he said he
thought the uniform can be a very

simple yet effec
tive means of en
suring senate ac
countability.
"Something
that was original
ly designed as a
joke now seems
to be a very good
idea," Dickert
said.

The original version of the uni
form bill, proposed by Dicker! last
quarter, included a propeller
beanie as part of the uniform and
addressed readers of the shirt as
"stupid" rather than "silly." But
after consulting with other sena
tors, Dickert excised the headgear
requirement and changed the
shirt's language.
"I was informed by various sen
ators that 'stupid' was disrespect
ful of our constituency," Dickert
said.
Other senators questioned the
choice of the sweatshirt as the sen
ate uniform. But Dickert noted the
versatility of the garment, saying it
could be worn conventionally or
wrapped around the waist or neck.
In her discussion with the sen
ate, Rice presented updates on the
University's administrative and
academic budget cuts, saying deci


Rice
sions in most units have either
already been finalized or are very
close to being completed.
Rice also addressed complaints
from undergraduate senator Mork
Murdock that the recent firing of
Assoc. Dean for Student Affairs
and Casa Zapata Resident Fellow
Cecilia Burciaga took place behind
closed doors and without student
input.
Graduate senator Nawwar Kas
rawi said he thought the firing was
the latest of a "pattern of deci
sions" that the administration had
made at times inconvenient for
student reaction and intervention,
noting that the decision to elimi
nate Burciaga's post was made
during spring break.
Rice denied that the adminis
tration was making any deliber
ate attempt to exclude students
from the decision-making pro
cess, but that other constraints
made it impossible to consider
students' schedules in the pro
cess.
"I make a budget decision three

times a day," Rice said. "I can't tie
the budget schedule to the aca
demic calendar."
Meanwhile, graduate senator
Steve Abbott raised concerns
that the new electronic-mail vot
ing system to be used next week
would effectively disenfranchise
students in the Schools of Law,
Business, and Medicine, as it
requires students to have
accounts on the Leland system.
Students in those schools typi
cally do not have Leland
accounts, Abbott said.
Council of Presidents member
Ron Brown promised to direct
Elections Commissioner Tom
Tsao to look for and implement
ways to remedy the problem.
In other business, the senate:
• Approved a bill placing an
advisory referendum on the
election ballot that asks voters
whether they belong to organi
zations that received funds
from special or general fees this
year.
• Approved an amendment in
the ASSU Bylaws aimed at revital
izing the dorm representative pro
gram. The program was never
eliminated but was not imple
mented this year.
