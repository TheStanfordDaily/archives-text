of the structure's support beams,
which may threaten the building's
strength in the event of an earth
quake.
Workers found partially failed
connections within the structural
brace system on the second floor
of the building while removing as

The asbestos removal effort,
which began last fall, forced the

East Asian Collection Library to

consists of a series of steel beams,
unlike the concrete braces in the
first floor and basement. The
"failed" connections among the
beams weakened the building's
ability to resist a major earth
quake.
Although the building is still
structurally safe, according to Fa

Barbara Pluta, the failure at some
of the connections between the
beams would make the system
