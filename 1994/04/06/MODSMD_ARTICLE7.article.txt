## Damaged support beams found in Lou Henry Hoover building 
### Rosalind Wang 
Asbestos isn't the only thing re
ceiving attention at the Hoover ln
stitution's Lou Henry Hoover
building these days.
Earlier this week, workers
there discovered damage to some
of the structure's support beams,
which may threaten the building's
strength in the event of an earth
quake.
Workers found partially failed
connections within the structural
brace system on the second floor
of the building while removing as
bestos from air ducts and walls.
The asbestos removal effort,
which began last fall, forced the
evacuation of Hoover fellows who
worked in the building and re
stricted use of the Institution's
East Asian Collection Library to

designated hours.
The damage to the beams was
not dis» vered earlier because the
beams ire hidden behind the
building's interior walls and were
not exposed until workers began
removal of asbestos from those
areas. The second floor system
consists of a series of steel beams,
unlike the concrete braces in the
first floor and basement. The
"failed" connections among the
beams weakened the building's
ability to resist a major earth
quake.
Although the building is still
structurally safe, according to Fa
cilities Construction Manager
Barbara Pluta, the failure at some
of the connections between the
beams would make the system
"resist less if an earthquake
should hit" than with proper con
nections.
The damage was caused by the
Loma Prieta earthquake of 1989,

Pluta said.
A few of the beams were also
bent, though Pluta said the angles
were slight. "We are talking about
20 to 30 foot beams which are
bent about an inch," she said.
According to Pluta, efforts to
replace the beams are currently
underway. However, work on the
brace system is not expected to

delay the reopening of the build
ing. The project is still expected to
be completed during the summer.
Pluta said she could not esti
mate the cost of repairs to the
beams.
The building houses the offices
of about 35 scholars and staff, as
well as the East Asian library.
The Hoover fellows and staff were

relocated in late October to Stan
ford Business Park, on Page Mill
Road near campus.
The asbestos that forced the
temporary closure of the building
was found in air ducts in
"mechanical areas" of the build
ing when facilities staff opened
the ducts to investigate com
plaints of poor circulation.
