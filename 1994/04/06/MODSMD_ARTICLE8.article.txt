## Epidemiologist discusses recent viral epidemic 
### George Chen 
Indian Health Service epidemiologist Ben
Muneta discussed the conflict between tradition
al Navajo and Western views of medicine which
occurred during the Hantavirus epidemic in a
speech before about 40 people at the School of
Medicine last night.
The Hantavirus epidemic — which infected
scores of Navajo while ravaging the Southwest
ern tribe's population last May— wjis centered
near Littlewater, New Mexico, although cases
also were reported in Arizona and Utah.
Although various causes were initially sus
pected, it was later determined that the illness
was due to the spread of the Hantavirus through
mice.
Muneta argued that once it was clear that an
infectious agent was the source of the mysterious
disease among the Navajo, media attention fo
cused on an unfavorable presentation of Navajo
lifestyle. The result was gross media insensitivity
to Navajo customs, ranging from interviewing an
infected woman on her deathbed to nvading fu-
nerals, Muneta said.
Muneta outlined the prejudice
perpetrated against the Navajo.
For instance, a bus of Navajo
school children en route to visit
their Los Angeles pen pals was
stopped and turned away at the
California border. Also, Navajo
children participating in a science
enrichment program for American
Indians were examined for the dis
ease although no children from
other tribes were examined.
In describing the media situa
tion surrounding the early days of
the epidemic, Muneta said there
was "lots of schlock and drama ...
[but it] is not the 'Andromeda
Strain,' " referring to a novel that
describes a deadly alien virus.
Muneta also spoke about the
interaction between Navajo heal
ing and Western medicine as both
struggled to deal with the Han
tavirus epidemic.
Major differences exist between
Western and Navajo views of
medicine. In Western medicine
there is a tendency to split every
thing apart, to conquer disease
through isolating the agent caus
ing disease, Muneta said.
In contrast, the traditional
Navajo way of healing emphasizes
harmony between patient and
universe, with a profound distur
bance in the harmony of world
reflected in people as disease. For
Navajo healers, the goal is not to
isolate virus, but to synchronize
the patient with nature, Muneta
said.
He added that perhaps the
biggest indicator of the different
views of the epidemic by Western
medicine and traditional Navajo
healing can be seen in the different
views toward mice, the presumed
carrier of the disease.
The Western world views the
mouse simply as a pest. In con
trast, Native Americans view the

mouse as both a bringer of grain
and a potential danger. "It can
give life and it can kill," Muneta
said.
Navajo common practice is to
burn anything touched by mice,
largely because they believe mice
carry an ancient disease that is
transmitted through their bodily
excretions, Muneta said. Ironically,
infrequent practice of this tradi
tion in recent years helped con
tribute to the pestilence of the
Hantavirus.
"[Traditional Navajo healers J
have tens of thousands of years of
things we don't know about,"
Muneta said. "We are arrogant
thinking we know it all and that
they don't know what they're talk
ing about."
Since the epidemic, various pre
ventive measures have been taken
to reduce the chance of future out
breaks, including changing building
codes to make buildings more
secure against mice and educating
the Navajo on recognizing early
symptoms of sickness, Muneta said.
However, Muneta claimed that
even these measures have been
thwarted by Western insensitivi
ties to Navajo culture.
In naming the strain of Han
tavirus responsible for last May's
epidemic the media has chosen to
call it the Morto Canyon strain,
oblivious to the fact that Morto
Canyon was the place of a mas
sacre of Navajo women and chil
dren in 1905 and tends to put
Navajos who hear that name in a
bad mood, making medical educa
tion difficult, Muneta said.
But Muneta was not completely
critical of Western medicine's
response to the epidemic. Despite
some conflicts and mishaps which
come from not having to deal with
unknown viral epidemics frequent
ly, Muneta said he believed that
the Center for Disease Control's
response was as rapid as possible,
determining the Hantavirus was
the causative agent in two weeks as
opposed to the multi-year studies
for other illnesses.
