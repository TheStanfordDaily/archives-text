DO YOU DREAM OF
SUNDAYS PICNICS
Yes, once again summer is arriving—and with it comes
Sunday Evening Jazz at Pearl's! By popular demand, we're
starting a bit earlier this year: May Day (May Ist).
We'll be open Sunday evenings all summer, serving live,
light jazz with our famous seafood menu. It's happening
in Palo Alto's most inviting outdoor courtyard, right in W
the heart of town. *
It's just one of the many things planned this summer at Pearl's, the
restaurant that more of Palo Alto discovers every year. So if you haven't 1
been to Pearl's before, join us for a Sunday jazz picnic. Our illustrious
staff and colorful clientele have made our spirit brighter than ever.
And if you're one of our beloved regulars, your favorite seat
will be waiting.
We are a seafood restaurant.
We serve dinner seven nights a week all summer.
