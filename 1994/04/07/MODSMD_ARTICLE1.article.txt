Stanford's unwanted houseguest could be on
his way back to his home country after being sen
tenced to three years probation in a Palo Alto
courtroom yesterday.
Abdelghani Attou, an Algerian national, has
already spent about 30 days in jail for two counts
of defrauding the innkeeper â€” acts which he
committed from during late January and Febru
ary at Branner Hall and Governor's Corner.
Attou owes $624 to Stanford for the 12 nights he
stayed without payment in on-campus housing.
The sentencing hearing in Santa Clara County
Municipal Court in Palo Alto was held over from
Tuesday in order to give Attou a chance to see if
the Algerian embassy would give him the money
to reimburse the University.
Attou's lawyer, Riccardo Ippolito, told the
court yesterday that the Algerian embassy was
unable to come up with the funds because the
payment was "outside the budget limit" of the
embassy. The embassy was also unable to give
Attou the $500 it had previously offered for bail,
Ippolito said after the hearing.
Attou appeared disoriented when walking into
the courtroom.
When Judge Gilbert Brown asked Attou what
he had to say about the charges, Attou replied, al
most inaudibly, that he promised not to do it
again.
"I learned a lesson by being through this expe
rience," he said.
Brown gave Attou a sentence of three years
probation with the added provision that Attou is
not allowed to set foot on the Stanford campus
unless invited.
Attou was given a June 2 deadline to pay the
$624 in restitution.
Attou will go directly from jail into the hands
