Clintons return documents
WASHINGTON (AP) — After repeated
requests from their former Whitewater
business partner, the Clintons are giving
failed S&L owner Jim McDougal about
2,000 pages of records from the Whitewa
ter real estate venture.
The Clintons sent McDougal corporate
tax returns, bank records on $203,000 in
Whitewater loans and contracts and pay
ment records on the sale of Whitewater
lots, says a letter by the Clintons' lawyer,
David Kendall.
The papers fall far short of providing a
complete picture on Whitewater, Kendall
added in an April 4 letter released yester
day by the White House.
McDougal — who needs the documents
to file tax returns — has said they would
help put to rest questions about the Clin

tons' role in Whitewater. The Clintons
have refused to release the documents to
the public, and, by their latest estimate,
assert they lost $47,000 in the partnership
with McDougal.
Rates stable for now
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Federal
Reserve, after jolting Wall Street with two
tiny interest rate increases, will likely
boost rates in mid-May after giving the
financial markets some time to stabilize,
private economists said.
While some analysts are looking for a
rate increase this week — based on last Fri
day's unusually strong employment report
— many said yesterday they think the cen
tral bank will wait several weeks. The rea
son: to assess the impact of the earlier rate
increases and the economy's performance.
