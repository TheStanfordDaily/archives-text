# Clinton begins search for new justice
## Mitchell, Babbitt appear to be favorites to succeed retiring Blackmun 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - White House
officials are reviewing about a dozen pos
sible candidates for President Clinton's
second appointment to the Supreme
Court, making no secret of the fact that
retiring Senate Majority l/eader George
Mitchell is high on the list.
Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt also
is on the list, even though he said he
wasn't interested and had told Clinton he
wanted to stay put.
Mitchell, D-Maine, and Babbitt were
the only two candidates publicly acknowl
edged as under consideration, but White
House officials insisted that the list was
longer and that no decision had been
made.
It was no surprise to Clinton when
Justice Hariy A. Blackmun announced
yesterday that he was retiring. The 85-
year-old jurist had told the president
months ago that he would retire. Black

mun called the White House on Monday
to say he was ready to announce his deci
sion publicly.
There was a torrent of speculation
about Blackmun's successor. Likely can
didates were said to include federal judges
Stephen G. Breyer of Boston, Jose A.
Cabranes of Connecticut and Appeals
Judge Richard Arnold of Little Rock, Ark.
Attorney General Janet Reno and
Solicitor General Drew Days also were
mentioned. One official floated the name
of U.S. District Judge Ann Clair Williams
of Illinois as a long-shot prospect. She
was named to the bench by Ronald Rea
gan in 1985.
Preliminary work on Blackmun's suc
cessor already had been under way
because of anticipation of his retirement.
The search goes into high gear, starting
from a base of names compiled last year
when Justice Byron White left the court.

White House special counsel Lloyd
Cutler said, "There are other people who
deserve consideration who were not seri
ously in the running the last time
around." He said the eventual list would
be 10 to 12, "more or less."
Cutler, leading the search with Mack
McLarty, the chief of staff, said he expect
ed Clinton to announce his nominee with
in "a matter of weeks."
"He will pick someone who generally
reflects his sense of political and moral
values," Cutler said. "Every president
does that." He said candidates would be
judged on the basis of ability, diversity
and character.
Mitchell said he had not received an
offer but would certainly consider one.
Cutler said there hadn't been any contact
with Mitchell, but "should it go much fur
ther, I think you can assume there will be
some contact."
