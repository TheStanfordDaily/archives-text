A new universal photo
ID card would be more
convenient for students

A SURVEY of Stanford stu
dents taken today would
probably reveal that about
10 percent have already lost their
flimsy Stanford student identifica
tion cards. Wait a few more weeks
and that number might jump to
around 20 or 30 percent.
Is this because Stanford students
are forgetful and lose things easily?
Maybe. But it's more likely that an
ID card that is so unimpressive and
rarely used is easily misplaced.
Stanford, like almost all other uni
versities, should have one photo ID
card that includes a meal card and
possibly additional functions.
The University cannot complain
about the cost of such a card. In
fact, it could save money by creat
ing one. One ID card with a photo,
the student's name, Stanford ID
number, the year the student
enrolled and an expiration date,
possibly the expected date of grad
uation, would be adequate. If a
student was still enrolled after the
expiration date, a new card could
be issued.
The benefits of such a card are
endless. Students would look at
this card as their driver's-license
on-campus and would always have
it in their possession. The Univer
sity would not have to pay for
printing or mailing student IDs
every quarter. The checking of IDs
at fraternity parties and other
campus events would be made
much easier with a photo.
Beyond the simple change of a
photo, a universal ID card could
include several other important
functions. At Duke University, stu
dents have cards that include all rel
evant information, food service
points and a campus credit line
accepted virtually everywhere.
Cards can be flashed at the book

store, the student union, Duke's
version of Tresidder Express, Domi
no's Pizza and even the laundry
machines. In fact, Duke students
only need to carry cash to tip the
waitress at the on-campus restau
rant after paying the bill with their
card.
One of the most popular aspects
of Duke's card is that all unused
money left on the card at the end
of the year is refunded, for both
food service and the pre-paid cred
it line.
The University needs to investi
gate such possibilities. Other
schools comparable to Stanford
have made the transition to uni
versal IDs smoothly, and there is
no reason to think Stanford could
not do the same.
The old IDs are supposedly
effective in keeping unenrolled
students from getting the benefits
of current students. If a student
stops out for one quarter, they are
not issued a new ID. But if
stopped-out students really want
to go to the library or need a Stan
ford ID for any other reason, they
can simply borrow one from a
friend. Without a photo ID, it is
hard to distinguish one card from
another.
A universal photo ID would
solve that problem painlessly.
Many schools require that an
enrollment sticker be placed on
the permanent ID to prove that
the student is enrolled for that
particular term. Copying this sys
tem would not be difficult for
Stanford.
In the end, the present ID sys
tem just doesn't make sense. One
universal ID would solve the mul
titude of problems that come with
the do-it-yourself IDs we get in the
mail every quarter. Initial invest
ments would have to be made to
change the current system, but
over time the savings would offset
the costs.
Stanford's commitment to mak
ing students' lives easier is suppos
edly a top priority. The University
can prove that by switching to a
more functional photo ID.
