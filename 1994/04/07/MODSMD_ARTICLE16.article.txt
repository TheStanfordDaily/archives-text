## The 						column of all columns 
### 
I NEED READERS. I need readers bad
— and I'm not afraid to grovel. That's
why, in the interest of all Daily fans, I
have taken a small, but I believe represen
tative poll, of what people don't want to
read columns on. Thus, by getting all pos
sible commentary on over-written topics
out of the way early I can avoid all such
subjects in the future.
"What people don't want to read
about" — an informal handbook for
columnists and readers alike, by Mike
Nichols.
People aren't interested in reading
about the full-tilt taste of the adminis
tration and budget cuts. Unfortunately
I found out about that one a week to
late. Bitten it, chewed it, spit it out.
Done it.
People don't want to hear about the
personal revelations I came to when my
sweaty palms gripped onto the final, gran
ite rock of Pinnacle Peak and I caught my
first breathless glimpse of the turquoise
and olive valley below, my mind swirling
like the circling pattern of red-tailed
hawks flying below.
Everyone hates hearing about how I
woke up one morning and groggily
searched for her little drooling mouth,
only to discover that my selfish, time-con
suming pursuit of deconstructionist dis
course had marginalized her feelings and
caused her to enter the empty, materialis
tic bourgeoisie paradigm and become a
Being of being filled with the nothing of

Nothingness, utterly crushing my Weltan
schauung.
And lines like, "I don't think people
stop to appreciate the Coffee House often
enough ..." aren't going to get any writ
er very far.
Using ideas from old Daily columns
isn't such a good idea either. Let's hope
most of you have forgotten Pete Huyck.
Did you ever think about the values
espoused by Scooby Doo? Shaggy, clearly a
gangly, malnourished midnight toker, was
always getting the munchies ....
Talking about Rush is no winner
either. Besides, I never did like that band.
Writing about the Draw is deadly.
There's just no excuse for saying things
like, "this traumatic experience that
heartlessly shreds apart close-knit groups
of friends, reducing caring, human rela
tionships to cruel, ice-cold numbers has
recently been computerized and deperson
alized into a system of electronic regurgi
tation that reduces this tradition of sus
pense and festivity to the unfeeling act it
truly is."
And thumbs down on articles about the
dreaded crunch of finals time. No one
wants to hear about the unbearable ten
sion that starts to build in the shoulders
and upper neck, wrenching and tightening
muscles, creeping slowly down the back,
causing hands to clench into fists and pecs
and triceps to bulge out — making sweat
bead up on the brow, the whole complex
ion to turn green . . . giving you the urge to

mutter "you wouldn't like me when I'm
angry."
Perhaps more than anything, howev
er, people don't want to read columns
about anything with initials, including
such cherry-bomb topics as the ASSU
and PC.
Ah, the Allegiance of reSume-packing
Stuck-up Undergraduates. Everyone has
a story to tell about them that'll curdle a
mother's milk while still inside her breast,
and no one wants to hear anyone else's.
And what about political correctness?
PC is dead and deserves to be run
through the ringer. Imagine what a neat
set of initials you could make by doing
that. How about CCCP — the non-Clas
sical Curriculum Creating Program. The
motto "We're making history of history"
sounds pretty good. Or, say, CPPC — the
Current Politics Potty-training Center.
Come in and have your brain washed
with the latest in non-rash-producing
terminology.
So, take it from me, purveyor of fine
Daily columns, you won't read any of that
rubbish here.

A very cute woman came up to Mike at
Flicks and said "You write a column for
the Daily, you're famous." He's not sure
it's true, but it sure sounded good.
