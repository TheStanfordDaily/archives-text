## Jordan Hall's Thai cafe not environmentally conscious 
### 
1 WOULD LIKE to inform the cam
pus community of a recent experi
ence I had with the Thai cafe locat
ed in the basement of Jordan Hall.
Having patronized this business in
the past, I have observed its indis
criminate use of Styrofoam containers
and disposable chopsticks in serving
its food. With this in mind, I brought
my own Tupperware and reusable
chopsticks when stopping there for
lunch this week. In making my selec
tion, I offered my plastic plate and
asked that my meal be served upon it.
The man in charge looked at me and
said, "It would cost you $14 [to do it
in this way]."
Thinking that the amount of food
was the issue, I clarified that the por
tion didn't need to match the size of

my container. To this he replied, "Do
you see the way this operation works
[presumably pre-boxed]? Do you want
this food or not?"
At this point, I had obviously lost
my appetite, and refused it. I also
refuse to be bullied by this clear prior
ity of business over service. A number
of other patrons witnessed this
exchange, and could certainly attest to
this man's complete lack of concern
for his customers. I am surprised that
anyone else would choose to patronize
the business after observing the treat
ment that I received.
I am similarly amazed at the
widespread acceptance of the "disser
vices" of the Thai cafe by such a
socially-conscious community as Stan
ford. If consuming the forests of

Indonesia through disposable chop
sticks is not tangible enough in the
way of environmental destruction,
perhaps we can see it more immediate
ly in the decreasing quality of air
above us as Styrofoam fails to decom
pose in our landfills. Yet flocks of peo
ple visit the Thai cafe every day, and
the cycle continues.
Most upsetting to me in this picture
is the sheer unwillingness of this busi
ness to accommodate an attempt for
more responsible and sustainable con
sumption. To me, this is an unaccept
able philosophy on both a commercial
and personal level, and should not be
tolerated. Despite my treatment, I
support this campus-based small busi
ness while disagreeing with its prac
tices.

Thus, I would advocate not a boy
cott of the business but a demand for
a change in its methods. Campus con
cern has proven effective in pressing
the businesses of Tresidder Memorial
Union to increase the use of recycled
paper products, and there is still
much progress to be made in limiting
the amount of non-recyclable materi
als circulated through campus ser
vices.
If individual concern for environ
mental responsibility and personal
respect becomes a prevalent force in
the basement of Jordan Hall, we will
certainly see changes at the Thai cafe
as well. The choice is ours, as con
sumers, to make.
