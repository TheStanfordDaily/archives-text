# University should look at Mary Edmonds, not Burciaga, to make cuts
## 
### 
I give up. Which one of the two front
pages published on Friday, April 1 was
the farce? I have to admit, I nearly
joined the long line of students at the
customer service desk waiting to
reclaim the Stanford Bookstore's sur
charge on textbooks. However, the
promise of extra cash was not the only
reason I hoped the first page was true
and the second "front page" was the
joke.

The supposedly real lead story
missed the point by a country mile.
Instead of asking why Cecilia Burciaga
was not reassigned elsewhere in the
University administration, the article
should have asked why someone else
wasn't fired. Vice Provost and Dean for
Student Affairs Mary Edmonds has
been omnipresent in budget-cutting
events, but her role on campus has
never been clearly defined nor subject
ed to question. I'm going to question it,
and I hope I will get some sort of rea
soned response.
Just who is Edmonds, and why has
she suddenly started making decisions
that affect me and many other stu
dents? Why do we need a second stu

dent dean (along with Dean of Stu
dents Michael Jackson) to the tune of
a six-figure salary? As a dean of Stu
dent Affairs, isn't Edmonds supposed
to advocate for our needs? If so, has
she shown any record or intent to
advocate for students' needs? If not,
what is her function? Does she know
what students' needs, desires or inter
ests are?
I don't believe so. During the one
admittedly brief conversation I had
with Edmonds, she seemed more like a
third grade teacher talking down to an
8-year-old than a University dean
speaking with an undergraduate.
On the other hand, Burciaga treats
students with respect and interest, and

she is a role model for the many stu
dents with whom she comes into con
tact. With her departure, the Universi
ty will lose a valuable student and
administrative talent, perhaps someone
who might have served well as a stu
dent dean.
If the University must have a vice
provost/dean and dean in the Office of
Student Affairs, the appropriate candi
dates to fill those posts should be cho
sen from a pool of resident fellows, stu
dent advisers or former students who
have experienced something of the
everyday lives of his or her constituen
cy: the students.
