## Power combo: a veteran and a newcomer Poruri and Schlukebir team up to form a fearsome doubles duo 
### Rob Ross Senior staff writer 
Something old, something new.
Something borrowed, something blue.
These instructions for bridal apparel
could also be used to create a high
powered doubles team.
Perhaps not the borrowed and blue
part. But to make his No. 1 doubles
tandem, Stanford head women's ten
nis coach Frank Brennan took his old
est and his newest and created what
may be the best duo in the country —
the team of senior Laxmi Poruri and
freshman Katie Schlukebir.
Brennan did have a luxury when
constructing his doubles squads.
"Doubles is a power game," he said.
"But usually, you don't have enough
power players to go around. So you get
a hitter and a setter. What makes
them unique is that you have two hit
ters."
These two hitters have pounded out
a 10-0 record this season, paving the
way to a No. 8 national ranking.
Included in these ten wins are two vic
tories over the fourth-ranked team in
the nation and wins over No. 6 and
No. 12.
But a meshing of power games is
not enough for collegiate success.
According to Brennan, top-notch dou
bles teams also must have a winning
personality combination. And that's
where the old-and-new aspect comes
in.
Poruri is the grizzled veteran. The
team's captain, "Popeye" has mixed
her natural quickness and soft hands
with the knowledge that comes from
playing high-level NCAA tennis to
propel herself to a 14-0 singles record
and a No. 2 national ranking.
"She just doesn't make mistakes,"
Schlukebir said of her partner. "All
my other doubles partners were good,
but always had something they needed
to work on. But with Laxmi, there's
nothing she can't do."
Schlukebir, on the other hand, is the
wide-eyed newcomer. Hailing from Kala
mazoo, Mich., the frosh relies on power
ful groundstrokes and serves to make up
for what she lacks in experience. She has
taken her lumps at No. 3 singles to more
seasoned players, yet still holds down a
No. 42 national ranking.
What both Brennan and Poruri
emphasize about Schlukebir, though,
is her toughness. They both knew that
she was a talented player on the junior
circuit, but her mental maturity came
as a surprise.

"She never wines or argues calls,"
Brennan said of last year's top recruit.
"She can have every break in the
world go against her, yet she doesn't
complain. That kid is a winner. She's
tough."
The old/new combination is not a
novel one for Brennan. Four seasons
ago, when Poruri was a mere naive
frosh coming to the Cardinal as its No.
1 recruit, Brennan teamed her with
his senior star Teri Whitlinger and the
pair made it all the way to the NCAA
doubles semifinals.
But the chemistry between Poruri
and Whitlinger was far from the
equality Poruri and Schlukebir have
enjoyed this season.
"I was under her wing," Poruri
recounted. "We had a lot of pressured
matches and she carried me.
"One thing that's special about
Katie and I is that we carry each other
out of slumps. I have confidence in her
that if I am a little off she'll take
over."
Nor was Schlukebir intimidated by
the prospect of playing with arguably
the best player in NCAA tennis.
"I was excited," she said. "I wanted
to play No. 1 doubles because I have
always played with great doubles play
ers. I wanted to show her (Poruri) I
could play doubles."
The duo excelled from its creation.
The National Collegiate Tennis Clas
sic in Palm Springs in January was
the team's first tournament — and its
first tournament win. Since then the
two have been unstoppable, cruising
through their regular season matches.
Perhaps the only blip in the pair's
career so far was a three-set affair
against the Bruin's Keri Phebus and
Susie Starrett in which the Cardinal
duo fell 1-6 in the first set before
rebounding to snare the next two sets
and the match.
"We both have a huge desire to
win," Poruri said. "When I go on the
court I know that we're not going to
lose. That's intimidating in itself.
Against UCLA, even after the first set,
I said, 'We're not going to lose this.'"
Midway through the season the duo
continues to improve. Schlukebir
points to improved intra-team com
munication that has lead to aggressive
play. Combined with powerful serves
and volleys, the pair's aggressive atti
tude has won a few matches through
sheer intimidation.
According to Brennan, the pair did
not begin with good communication,
or any communication at all. In fact,

he found Schlukebir reluctant to cross
the center line, concentrating on just
doing her own half. And to play suc
cessful doubles, each player must at
times contribute more than 50 per
cent.
"Early in the season I said, 'Look,
you can't have too much respect for
Popeye,'" Brennan said. "'lf you
don't, you're going to be in trouble.'
So basically Katie took a few more
shots and that's what made them so
much better. And now it's icing on the
cake time."

The icing on the cake would be an
NCAA doubles championship. And no
one doubts the possibility of that
accomplishment, although the senior
is a little more diplomatic about their
chances.
"I think we have a great shot at the
title," Poruri said. "There are some
great teams out there, but definitely
don't count us out."
The freshman is more direct:
"It doesn't matter who we play
against. We can play with anyone in
the country."
