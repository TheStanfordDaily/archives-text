# A 						blissful opener at the 'Stick
## 
### 
Monday showed me that everything is
right in the universe. You see, it was
Opening Day, and I spent it at Candle
stick Park.
Growing up in Washington, I never got the

chance to
watch profes
sional base
ball outside.
Sure, the
Kingdome has
a home plate,
three bases
and 55,000-
plus seats like
just about

every other
ballpark, but it has very little character. Make
that no character.
Shamefully, I'll admit that I've just come to
this realization. I used to love going to King
dome for Mariners games. I treasure my mem
ories from the Kingdome, even when my
beloved Mariners ended up on the short end of
the stick. But now, I've seen the light.
Yes, that's right. Candlestick, the Icebox by
the Bay, opened my eyes to the magnificence of
outdoor baseball. I had been to one other out
door game, but that was almost 15 years ago.
For all intents and purposes, Monday's Open
ing Day game was my first outdoor game.
Right away, I noticed things were different
than in Seattle. The parking lot was full of peo
ple tailgating — I had never seen so many mini
barbecues in my life. Granted, Monday's
weather made for a great chance to tailgate, but
the pre-game function also allowed me to bring
my baseball-craving blood to a full boil as I
watched fans devour polish dogs, ribs, burgers
and just about every beverage known to man.
About an hour before game time, we jour
neyed into Candlestick, picking up our com
memorative calendars on the way in. Walking
quickly up the stairs behind the outfield stands,
I came to the top as the darkness of the con
crete gave way to a flood of green and orange as
the 'Stick opened up before my eyes.
Settling into the new centerfield bleachers, a
scant 20 feet away from the lush grass of right
centerfield, my roommate Sam and I were
bathed in the bright sunlight as we judiciously
applied suntan lotion — something I never had
to worry about in the Kingdome (that wicked
glare from the gaziilion-watt light bulbs just
isn't the same as the real thing).

The game started 10 minutes
late, but nobody cared. Baseball
isn't about starting or ending at a
specific time. It's just nine innings,
however long they may take.
Unfortunately, the hours passed
rapidly, as the Giants made quick
work of the Pittsburgh Pirates. Two
Matt Williams home runs started
the season off with a bang, with the
first four-bagger landing in the sec

tion next to ours (Sam says he saw
us on Jumbovision, but I disagree).
Barry Bonds was his cocky self in
left field, running down fly balls and
snagging them with the snap of his
mitt, violating just about every rule
your little league coach told you
about catching the ball.
I even got my first taste of
bleacher bums. The group of gentle
men sitting in front of us were con
siderate enough to spend every
break in the action berating Pirates'
centerfielder Andy Van Slyke. They
even bad-mouthed the roving televi
sion camera crews for not putting

them on TV.
What made my opening day
experience even better was that I
got to spend it with my two newest
cousins, 3-year-old Payton and 9-
month-old Darren Robinson.
Although Payton has been to
other Opening Days, to hear a 3-
year-old say things like "Go
Giants!" or "It's Candlestick,
Mommy!" and mean it really
makes you see what baseball is all
about. His father has been to the
last 10 or so Giants' Opening
Days, and now he is passing the
tradition down to his kids.

Some people just don't get excit
ed about baseball. Boring, they say.
A waste of grass, others claim. The
players are overpaid. But when you
simultaneously see the eyes of a
child, his mother and father light up
when the first pitch is thrown, all
these complaints just don't fit.
Burkett into the wind-up . . .
here's the pitch ...

Watch out, Joe and Dom DiMaggio.
Greg thinks the combo of Payton and
Darren Robinson may just become
the greatest pair of brothers Major
League Baseball has ever seen.
