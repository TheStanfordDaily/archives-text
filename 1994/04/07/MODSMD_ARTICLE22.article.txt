# 'Breaking out of the dry spell'
## Women's golf to tee off in Tempe 
### Seth Goldstein Staff writer 
Imagine coming face to face with the Four Horsemen of the
Apocalypse.
That's sort of what the Stanford women's golf team is pre
pared to do tomorrow, Saturday and Sunday at the Lady Sun
Devil Invitational in Tempe, Ariz.
They may not be War, Famine, Pestilence and Death, but
No. 1 Arizona State, No. 2 San Jose State, No. 3 UCLA and No.
4 USC come fairly close. These teams lead an extremely com
petitive group, including eight of the top nine squads in the
nation. The fifth-ranked Cardinal will have some pretty fancy
golfing to do in order to stay close with these juggernauts.
"It is the strongest field of the year," said head coach Tim
Baldwin. "We should get a really good indication of where we
sit nationally."

The Sun Devils are the heavy favorite. Not only do they
bring five potential All-Americans to the tournament, but they
will also be playing on their home course. With one minor
exception in the fall, no team has come close to defeating them
this season.
"Arizona State is going to stay that tough all the way
through," said junior Jamille Jose.
The Stanford women must improve upon what has been a
lackluster year so far if they hope to compete well. As of yet, the
team has not lived up to the high expectations placed upon it by
the media or the team's members.
"It keeps lingering in our minds — breaking out of the dry
spell," said freshman Andrea Baxter. "We haven't been playing
as well as we can."
They have shown recent signs of improvement. However,
this ray of hope was literally cov
ered by rain clouds. Two weeks
ago at the Hawaii Invitational the
squad turned in a good first round
before monsoon-like weather
caused the cancellation of the final

two days of play leaving the Cardi
nal, only three strokes out of first
place.
"It was really disappointing,"
said Baxter. It showed us the
importance of playing well in the
first round."
Hopefully, the cancellation will
not ruin the momentum the
squad had built going into the
tournament. It will be up to fresh

man Mhairi McKay, senior Melin
da Daniels, sophomore Vicky Stra
da, Baxter and Jose to make sure
the team keeps improving.
This will be the eighth differ
ent lineup coach Baldwin has
fielded in eight tournaments this
season. Before each contest the
nine players on the team play in
an intra-squad qualifier to deter
mine which five will compete.

Those who placed among the top
10 individuals or averaged two
over par or less per round in the
previous tournament automati
cally qualify.
"Coach is really good about giv
ing everyone a fair shot," Baxter
said. "We all wish we didn't have
to play against our own, but it
gives us more tournament-like
experience."
