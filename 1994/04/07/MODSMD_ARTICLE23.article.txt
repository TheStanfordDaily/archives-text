# Crew takes to waters in San Diego

### Heather Hardwick 
After a long spring break of intense
training, the men's and women's crew
teams set out to prove themselves this
past Saturday at Redwood Shores. Facing
competitors from both UC-Davis and
Santa Clara, the results proved pleasing
for Stanford.
The men's varsity coasted to victory in
both races, overcoming UC-Davis and
Santa Clara by 53 and 23 seconds, respec
tively. The junior varsity encountered
similar success, beating the Aggies and
then making a triumphant comeback

after trailing for most of the race against
the fastest Santa Clara boat.
Varsity men's coach Wieslaw Kudja
indicated the importance of the victory
over Santa Clara in that it provided a
"good change in attitude" for a group of
sophomores who had never succeeded in
coming from behind.
The Stanford women came away from
the weekend with equally successful
results. The varsity defeated both UC-
Davis and Santa Clara handily, with
almost 30 seconds to spare in each case.
The junior varsity glided to an easy victo
ry over UC-Davis and did not compete

against Santa Clara. The novice women
suffered an initial loss to the Aggies but
came back to post a strong finish in the
second race, edging out Santa Clara by a
mere four seconds.
The achievements of this past weekend
give the team an optimistic view of the
season to come.
"We hope that the teams have devel
oped good speed and disposition in prepa
ration for the major regattas," Kudja said.
Both the men's and women's squads
head down south this weekend to compete
in the prestigious San Diego
Crew Classic. This contest marks
the beginning of NCAA Division I
competition and draws many
teams from the Pacific 10 Confer
ence, including rivals California
and Washington, deemed by
Kudja to have "one of the top two
boats in the country." The Clas

sic also draws several power
house teams from the Ivy
League.
While the Cardinal's oppo
nents include big names, and the
experience that goes with them,
such intimidating forces don't
deter Stanford.
"I'm not concerned how fast
the team is going, there's nothing
I can do about it," Kudja said.
"There's nothing they can do
about the opponents either, just
do their best, and go for it."
