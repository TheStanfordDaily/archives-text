# Arizona ahead
## Men's tennis faces tough Pac-10 challengers 
### Mike Langford Senior staff writer 
It doesn't get any easier from here.
After splitting dual matches with USC
and UCLA last weekend, the top-ranked
Stanford men's tennis team will host two
more visiting teams from down south. And as
with every squad in the Pacific 10 confer
ence, Arizona and Arizona State present
themselves as difficult opponents.
"This will be a big weekend," said head
coach Dick Gould. "Just when we get done
playing USC and UCLA, we have two more
tough matches."
Two weekends ago, No. 37-ranked Arizona
came close to toppling the then-undefeated
Cardinal, losing by a slim 3-4 margin.
Although Stanford swept in doubles play, the
Wildcats took three of the six singles matches.
Arizona is led by Jan Anderson, the No.
12-ranked singles player in the country. In
their last meeting, Anderson ably handled
Stanford senior Mike Flanagan 6-4, 6-3. At
second and third singles, sophomore JefT
Salzenstein and senior Bobby Devens won
their matches in straight sets, as did sopho
more Jim Thomas at sixth singles.
The Cardinal's losses came against seniors
Chris Cocotos and Vimal Patel at fifth and
fourth singles, respectively. The latter's
match went three sets against Wildcat Bran
don Hearn, with a few words of, uh, cama
raderie exchanged between the two.
Stanford's match against No. 25-ranked
Arizona State on March 25 was nearly rained
out, but then was fortunately decided without
needing to play doubles. The Cardinal took
every match but fourth singles, in which

Patel fell in straight sets to Paul Reber.
The head of the Sun Devils' class is Sargis
Sargsian, the third-ranked singles player in
the nation. Flanagan triumphed against
Sargsian two weeks ago 7-6, 6-4. However,
this weekend may feature this year's first
meeting of the two teams in doubles, where
Sargsian and partner Peter Jeschke are
ranked fourth nationally.
Stanford's doubles will counter with
Flanagan and partner Cocotos, who are 9-3
in dual match play and rank as 18th-best duo
in the nation. There is no drop-off from
there, as the Cardinal's second doubles team
of Patel and Salzenstein is ranked No. 17.
The third doubles team of Devens and fresh
man Grant Elliott have been consistently
successful, despite falling to Trojan oppo
nents last weekend.
In singles, Flanagan currently stands as
the ninth-best player in the country. With
wins against Sargsian, and USC's Wayne
Black, and a close match against Bruin
Robert Janecek, his ranking is likely to climb.
"Mike is legit," Gould said. "He's compet
ed well against four really great players in a
row. He's getting better all the time, and is
playing as good as anybody right now."
However, perhaps the biggest jump in the
rankings will be made by Salzenstein, who is
currently 11-2 in dual matches at No. 2 sin
gles. Ranked 72nd in the nation, Salzenstein
has impressive wins to his credit, including
UCLA's Canadian Davis Cup team member
Sebastien Le√ülanc and USC's No. 11-ranked
Jon Leach.
"JefT is doing a great job," Gould said. "He
has a phenomenal record, and he's
only going to get better."
Devens, at third singles, rounds
out a capable top half of the singles
lineup.
The bottom of the lineup is a
large portion of what makes Stan
ford so successful. At fourth sin
gles, Patel is ranked No. 77 in the

nation, but has been plagued by
recent inconsistency, losing three
of his last four matches. At fifth
singles, Cocotos continues to pro
vide depth.
But Thomas has been the
bedrock of the team. At sixth singles,
he has racked up a 15-0 record and is
currently ranked 39th nationally.
Stanford's match against Ari
zona on Friday begins at 1:30 p.m.
at the Stanford Tennis Stadium,
while Saturday's match against
Arizona State begins at noon.
