Add another sport to the long list of ath
letics in which Stanford has gained national
prominence.
Stanford women's lacrosse announced to
the traditional East Coast powerhouses
what the West had known all the time —
that the Cardinal had a lacrosse team to be
reckoned with.
On the verge of taking the club sport to a
higher level, Stanford went into St. Peters
burg, Fla. during spring break, where it
played against top notch competition. It also
discovered the Cardinal lacrosse team could
hold its own against anyone.
Last winter it was voted to change the
team's status from club to varsity for the
1995 season which also meant a stepping up
of intensity level. At the beginning of this
year, as the team increased its conditioning,
instituted weight training and met with a
nutritionist, a new determination arose.
Practices also jumped from a couple a
week to sessions almost every day in prepa
ration for the beginning of competition and
the vital spring break exhibitions.
The first part of the season went well
despite several injuries which sidelined
some players. Senior co-captain Kate Apple
white suffered the most serious of these
injuries, a torn rotator cuff, which required
surgery. Applewhite plays the key position
of defensive point, the last person before the

goalie.
The initial meeting between UC-Davis
and Stanford in the Santa Barbara Shootout
February 19 and 20 resulted in a victory for
UC-Davis which was in part due to team
injuries. The next week, Stanford traveled
to Davis where it played the Aggies tight,
losing a tough contest after keeping close for
most of the game.
The Cardinal recovered from the defeat
to win the games leading up to its spring
break stint in Florida. The team's record
now stands at 5-1 in the Western Women's
Lacrosse League with strong play from the
other senior co-captain Jenn Watts and
sophomore Hannah Flatau, who filled the
hole left by Applewhite.
Traveling to Florida, however, Stanford
was unsure of its stature among the teams
of the East coast. In the West, none of the
other women's lacrosse teams compete at
the varsity level, and aside from UC-Davis
and UC-Santa Barbara, the competition was
not very tough. In St. Petersburg, the Car
dinal competed against nationally-ranked
teams in Division 111 such as Oberlin,
Millersville and Middlebury.
Coaches Kay Cowperthwait and Cecilia
Wilcox Paglia were uncertain of how their
team would stack up. Paglia said the team
"did not know how well they were national
ly." Applewhite added that "we expected to
have a lot of hard competition."
In the eyes of everyone concerned, Stan

ford proved it belonged. In Florida, the team
went 7-2 against top competitors and earned
the respect for West Coast lacrosse that had
not been there before.
"The coaches who were running the clin
ics loved our team and always used us for
demos," Applewhite said. "It was fun, we
got our egos boosted."
While the team as a whole elevated its
level of play in Florida, Watts' contributions
stood out in everyone's mind as particularly
noteworthy. Describing Watts as the most
skilled player in the league and offensively
very strong, Paglia said she showed her abil
ities by leading the team in scoring during
the Florida trip.
"(Watts J was playing with higher level
competition and it brought her up to that
level that we all knew she had," Applewhite
said.
Overall, the team gained confidence it
hopes to carry into the rest of its games this
season, which leads up to the Final Four
Tournament, held April 30 and May 1 at
Stanford's Maloney Stadium. According to
Cowperthwait, the team should be seeded
No. 1 or No. 2 for what will be the last tour
nament for the club team before becoming a
varsity sport.
In facing off for the crown, the Cardinal
will face the country's top teams and aim to
avenge its previous losses to Davis, proving
once again that Stanford is the best in the
West.
