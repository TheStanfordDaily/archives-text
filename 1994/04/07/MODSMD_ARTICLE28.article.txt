### Julie Sauer Staff writer 
Poets and professors mourned
the declining emphasis on arts
and humanities in American uni
versities at a "memorial service"
yesterday afternoon, expressing
sorrow over their diminished role
in an increasingly technical and
scientific world.
French Prof. Emeritus Robert
Cohn hosted the event, explaining
in his opening address that the
need for the memorial rose from
his reflection on the loss of "a
whole way of life."
He cited 1987 poet laureate
Richard Wilbur, who describes
the new role of arts and humani
ties in universities as a tragic loss
which Cohn calls "a spiritual
holocaust."

Cohn attributed the decline of
the arts and humanities to the sci
ence, secularism and egalitarian
ism that contribute to a "loss of
dramatic spirit." Rather than con
demning science and technical
knowledge, he noted the catastro
phe that comes with an imbalance
between arts and sciences.
While Cohn's address implicat
ed Stanford as a participant in the
demise of the humanities, he
offered hope of a possible rebirth
under University President Ger
hard Casper's leadership
"Casper cares about scholar
ship," he said.
Cohn introduced several dis
tinguished scholars, including
Rabbi Ari Cartun, director of
Stanford Hillel, and Ricardo
Quinones, director of the Insti
tute for Humanistic Study at

Claremont-McKenna College.
Stanford professors Leo Wein
stein and Gerald Gillespie pre
sented messages from national
and international poets, scholars
and authors.
Quinones said American schol
ars moved in the wrong direction
in the early 1970s by accepting
"relentless, dogged" critical meth
ods rather than intellectually
bold criticism.
The current crisis in the arts
and humanities grew from the
trend of following the political
activism of the 19605, he said. This
resulted in "a loss of faith in the
validity of the literary imagination
and the value of literary studies."
"We are here to assert that the
literary imagination is no longer
to be used as a retread," Quinones
said. "It is useful to account for

who people are, where they are
and how they got to be there."
Weinstein and Gillespie presented
messages from intellectuals Czes
law Milosz, George Steiner,
James Q. Wilson, Rene Girard
and Wilbur. The scholars empha
sized the importance of the
humanities in expressing knowl
edge and cultural heritage.
Senior Hoover Fellow Robert
Conquest presented the closing
address, emphasizing the need to
rescue arts and humanities from
their current diminished role and
supported the value of human lit
erary scholarship.
"Every word carries history,
the hope of language, country and
background," he said. "Language
is dying to an extent for lack of
proper education in what lan
guage produces."
