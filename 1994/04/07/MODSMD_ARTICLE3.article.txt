The events in Bosnia constitute a be
nign bloodbath, democracy is fine as long
as the rich people win and the United
States is essentially perfect.
Employing a series of such sarcastic as
sertions to make a caustic attack on past
and present American foreign policy,
renowned linguist and author Noam

Chomsky ensured a healthy degree of un
certainty in the laughter of his audience of
more than 700 yesterday.
In the speech in Dinkelspiel Auditori
um, titled "Democracy and the Free
Market in the New World Order,"
Chomsky called the United States the
"leading violator" of the three principles
it claims to champion — human rights,
the free market and democracy — and
questioned the relationship among

them.
"Problem number one is that democra
cy, free markets and human rights are not
clearly linked," Chomsky said.
"But they do have some things in com
mon. One thing they have in common is
that the United States has historically
been opposed to them all."
