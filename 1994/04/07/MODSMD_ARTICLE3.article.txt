# Chomsky's sarcasm mauls U.S. policies
## 
### Josh Gohlke Staff writer 
The events in Bosnia constitute a be
nign bloodbath, democracy is fine as long
as the rich people win and the United
States is essentially perfect.
Employing a series of such sarcastic as
sertions to make a caustic attack on past
and present American foreign policy,
renowned linguist and author Noam

Chomsky ensured a healthy degree of un
certainty in the laughter of his audience of
more than 700 yesterday.
In the speech in Dinkelspiel Auditori
um, titled "Democracy and the Free
Market in the New World Order,"
Chomsky called the United States the
"leading violator" of the three principles
it claims to champion — human rights,
the free market and democracy — and
questioned the relationship among

them.
"Problem number one is that democra
cy, free markets and human rights are not
clearly linked," Chomsky said.
"But they do have some things in com
mon. One thing they have in common is
that the United States has historically
been opposed to them all."
Chomsky, a professor of linguistics at


Chomsky
MIT, linked his criticisms to cur
rent events. He cited Article 14 of
the United Nations' Universal
Declaration of Human Rights,
which guarantees the right to seek
asylum from persecution to all
refugees.
"Such as Haitians," he said.
Chomsky criticized both former
President Bush, for refusing
Haitians entrance into the United
States, and President Clinton, for
tightening the blockade.
When asked to address Bosnia
in the discussion following the lec

ture, Chomsky said the United
States is not getting involved
because it has no direct economic
or political interest there. He said
the events receive a great deal of
media coverage, however, because
the American government has an
indirect interest in them through
western Europe.
He contrasted this with the
atrocities in Angola, where he said
there have been even more casual
ties than in Bosnia and almost no
news coverage.
"If Africans want to kill each
other it's OK, as long as the
resources are there to be taken and
exploited," Chomsky said, sardon
ically describing what he said is the
U.S. government's attitude.
