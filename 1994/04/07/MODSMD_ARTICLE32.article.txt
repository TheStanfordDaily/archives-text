# Everybody's alternative

I paused in front of a telephone booth
papered with advertisements for up
coming music events. "The hottest
band from New York's underground music
scene" read one ad. Next to it were flyers for
the hottest bands from Seattle, Austin,
Chicago, Boston and Boulder. Amazingly,
all were products of their city's under
ground music scene.
So, these bands routinely perform at sub
terranean gopher bars as urbanites wind
down Inferno-like staircases toward the lilt
ing guitar of Boston's "hottest band?" Not.
I'm sorry, next contestant.
By underground, the ad must mean al
ternative, right? Not so well known, against
mainstream-Austin sound, hip-hoppily,
jazzmatazzily, grungily different. But what
meaning does underground have, when ap
parently every city sports a thriving under
ground music scene, and to be "hot" a band
must be popular?
America, what gives with the insatiable
and overwhelming desire to be different?
U2's Bono best stated America's paradox

on national television. "Fuck the main
stream!" he said, holding his gilded Gram
my statuette high in the air. What better val
idation of mainstream status than to be rec
ognized by the Grammy Committee?
Bono's wardrobe and lifestyle depend on
the fact that most of America bought the
overworked "Zooropa" album (your author
included).
How different can you be in a society
where Chanel adopts hip-hop oversized
jeans with suspenders in a full-page Vogue
ad, where grunge is accepted couture, and
"alternative" music makes up 80 percent of
MTV's programming? Mainstream Ameri
ca is dying to be different, snapping up
every potential fad and turning it into a
overused cliche before it's even begun.
So when the line between mainstream
and anti-establishment becomes blurred,

how can one make comparisons? The no
tion of opposite is lost in a society where
rebels are opposing a mainstream which is
basing itself on rebellion.
Yet the media capitalize on this paradox.
Fashion takes its cues from the music world;
a visual medium relying on a supposedly
aural one. Cinema springs from fashion;
Robert Altman's "Pret-£-Porter" is now in
production. Music becomes increasingly
technical (see U2), political (see any rapper)
and cross-categorized (what is Us 3's music
anyway?).
And now Peter Gabriel is mixing it up
even more, adding virtual reality machines
and interactive booths to his concerts. You
can truly fulfill your innermost desire to
jam with the band. His plans for an "Expe
rience Park" embody the modern spirit of
entertainment. All experiences fuse togcth

cr: movement, dance, music, television and
cinema (and roller coasters?) all for a $ 19.95
admission price.
And since when has music had so much
power? So much of our modern identity is
linked to our music taste, that a description
of a person can be as succinct as "He's a
Deadhead" or "I don't know, she listens to
the Breeders." Frankly, it's hard to imagine
our parents and their generation defining
themselves by Little Richard's profound
lyrics, let alone modeling their style of dress
after him.
One can only speculate what the future
of music will hold. Perhaps all styles will
commingle into one Kamikaze, eclectic, ca
cophonous noise. If music equals self, then
maybe we can reach that Rodney King/Bill
and Ted "why can't we all just get along"
Utopian ideal through it. I certainly hope so.
In the meantime, I'm going to check out
that new Pavorotti and Bob Weir singing
Motley Crue classics CD. I've heard that un
derground band from Juneau does a great
cover of it. ■
