# knee deep in a brand new heavy funk

It's the pure — not the right — thing,
baby. It's the "N" in noddin' heads, the "J"
in jeep-beats, the "F" in freestyle. The "D"
in deejayin', "H" in house jam, M B" in butter
flyin'-bodies-on-the-dance-floor. It's even
the "C" in Dre's "Chronic."
It's the funk, ya dig? Straight, no chaser. It's
free of artificial additives, preservatives,
sweeteners, colors and flavors. It's all-natur
al, organic, home-spun. F-U-N-K. Ask for

it by name. Accept no substitutes, for our
musical landscape — overwrought with
mediocrity (Mariah Carey, R. Kelly,
Jodeci, Hammer), complacency (Janet
Jackson, Ice Cube, Public Enemy,
Bobby Brown) and redundancy (H-
Town, Jade, Shai, Silk, SWV, DRS) —
offers very few options.
A De La Soul here, a Lenny Kravitz
there, a Me' Shell NdegeOcello from
around the way, or say an outfit from
across the deep blue sea: the Brand New
Heavies. One part rock, four parts jazz
fusion (blended with a twist of disco), and

the rest soul-sweet-soul, the Heavies' brand
of funk made waves almost immediately
following the '91 release of their self-titled
debut.
Then, they were three British chaps (two
white, one black) with a knack for most
things musical, and a down-home Georgian
bombshell with a Motown vibe that
screamed Tammi Terrell. The trio was
pushed together by a record company (Deli
cious Vinyl) to do a 10-track experiment that
ended up paying off big for all involved. The
album's first single, "Dream Come True," an
up-tempo dance track with a disco vibe and a
James Brown-inspired horn line, hipped pop
audiences to the UK's acid jazz experience.
But it was the follow up single, "Never Stop,"
a lazy, Saturday afternoon groove, that sewed
the new band's situation up proper.
Within the space of a year, everyone —
from jazz heads to discophiles to soul afi
cionados — had developed a taste for the
Heavy Brand of funk, including a wide cross
section of the most respected and artistically
savvy names in hip-hop. Names like A Tribe
Called Quest, Grand Puba, Black Sheep,
Gang Starr, Kool G Rap and Main Source
(befor' the Large Professor left).
Their enthusiasm for BNH spurred the
collaborative venture in '92, "Heavy Rhyme
Experience: Vol. 1." Another 10-track exper
iment, which married the "live" vocals often
rappers to the live instruments of the Heav
ies, the "Heavy Rhyme" reception wasn't as
consistently positive as it might have been
with more time and planning.
But the rap compilation's moderate suc
cess hasn't kept the Heavies — N'dea Daven
port (the bombshell), Simon Bartholomew,
Jan Kincaid and Andrew Levy (the two white
boys and the brother) — from bonding as a

group
and hit

ting
upon the
vibe that -

in their minds — has made

"Brother Sister" (their second album) a bet
ter recording than their first.
"I think we're more experienced in the
studio now. We've got more of an idea about
what we're doing and the whole process of
recording and stuff," explains keyboardist
and drummer Kincaid, who was on the
phone from New York. "It's quicker now, al
though tracks are more complex, and more
goes into them. As a result, I think this album
has a more well-rounded sound overall."
Listening to the 14 tracks of "Brother Sis
ter" affirms the musician's opinion. Whereas
BNH's debut works from track to track by
dangling one funky carrot on a string after
another, "Brother" is more ambitious, more
conscious of its ultimate goal: to take us on a
musical joyride, literally. Like a religious in
vocation minus the fanfare, "Have A Good
Time" hunkers down into a no-nonsense
Kool and the (iang-esque routine, complete
with a frolicking group chorus, flirtatious
organ riffs and a lone sax line that stages a
successful coup over Davenport's sultry vo
cals.
But never fear, Davenport's near. She
wages several aggressive battles of her own on
tracks like "Brother Sister," "Fake," "Back to
Love," weaving in and out of the boys' ac-

com

pan i -
merit like

the seasoned
Top Voice she is.

Likewise, bassist Levy,
guitarist Bartholomew and

Kincaid orchestrate tight pocket grooves
that hang together like mom's peanut butter
and jelly sandwiches. No one could ask for
better musical accompaniment.
But that doesn't change the fact that the
crew seems at its most vibrant when the
songbird sits a number or two out. After all,
it's the grooves that got the band noticed in
the first place. "Ten Ton Take," an antsy little
funk that showcases the group's horn-ar
ranging skills, feels like a "Starskyand Hutch"
car chase down the F.C.H., while "Los Burri
tos" struts like a pimp at the Player's Ball.
Still, the Brand New Heavies are four, not
three, and it's doubtful they'd change-up
even if given the opportunity. Back then, re
calls Kincaid, "It was like two groups of peo
ple getting to know each other. We were both
in a situation where by we were working to
gether. And it was really a question of getting
to grips with that and getting to grips with
how people work. Like any kind of job really,
when you go into a new situation you learn
more about the people around you. And we
were kind of in a working situation straight
away.
"So luckily," he continues, "we were expe
rienced enough — and certainly N'dea was
experienced enough — in the studio to be

able to get it off and running pretty quickly.
It was kind of a weird thing to do . . . but I
think it was a good thing as well to a certain
extent, because we just sort of got on with
it, as opposed to sitting around and wait
ing."
Of course the"it" that Kincaid refers to is
a sort of British interpolation of '70s jazz,
R&B and rock and soul synthesized together
into a composite music form that is as
much a pop lifestyle as it is a pop musical
discipline: acid jazz. But truth be told, the
music and its scene, notes Kincaid, is re
ally centered around the UK indepen
dent, Acid Jazz, the label that shipped
the Heavies sound to the States back in
the late '80s (before Delicious Vinyl
picked them up).
Still considered by some to be an
acid jazz act, though they've moved
onto a major label, Kincaid feels that
"acid jazz" is "really just a term that ap
plies to a whole wide range of different
music, all of it based around funky, jazzy
kind of things that isn't really pop. It's really
just a media term that was spurned out over
a group of bands that was around at the time.
Some of them still are around like ourselves.
But it really doesn't go too much deeper than
that."
But while Kincaid could really care less
about the actual term, it is clear that he sees
himself and his bandmates as apart of a larg
er movement. A movement preoccupied
with pushing the boundaries of the expected
to find something different, something bet
ter.
"It's a pretty relevant scene in England and
in Europe and even globally now, to a certain
extent. When we travel around we find clubs
all over the world that play (acid jazz), and we
play at those clubs. Basically, it's a very eclec
tic mix of music. You might here some funky
jazz tunes, a bit of reggae and a bit of hip-hop
maybe. It does travel quite a long way around
the world and has traveled quite along way
around the world.
"So it's got a valid movement I think. And
it's always been quite alternative in it's atti
tude. It's a kind of alternative scene to the
R&B scene or to the straight hip-hop scene,
or whatever. It's the kind of scene where any
thing goes to a certain extent, and a lot of
those elements of those different kinds of
music come into and cross-over in it."
While Kincaid doesn't care to place the
Heavies at the head of this movement, it's
clear that every album they produce is a veri
table microcosm of a world clique, where
melodic and rhythmic over-achievement is
the only order of the day. Though the future
looks exceedingly bright for the Brand New
Heavies, where it will take them is anyone's
guess. The only thing that's for sure is time
flies when vou're in the funk. ■
