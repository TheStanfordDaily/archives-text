# Take the new with the old
## Ram's Head's twist on 'Guys and Dolls' 
### Janar Stewart 
A woman orders the house lights cut down.
An eerie orange light seeps from the floor, cen
ter stage.
Just then a tall, well-built actor enters stage
left and joins another actor already in place.
They commence the scene, lift the trap door
and are greeted by smoke billowing from the
orchestra pit below. Shortly after the actors
drop into the hole, the woman asks director
Dave Barlin, "How does it look?"
Barlin replies, his temperate voice drowned
by the din of stage crew shouting orders, actors
wandering around behind him reciting lines
and a flutist in the orchestra practicing a part
missed during one of the earlier scenes.
Welcome to the way Barlin and his 28-
member cast spend Saturday nights. And
weekday nights. And whatever else it takes to
produce the best version of musical "Guys and
Dolls" they possibly can.
When Barlin first interviewed with produc
er Todd Feldman, he presented his vision of
Ram's Head's spring show as bringing "out the
same reaction from the audience that people
got when they first saw the show on Broadway."
Considering that the original 1950 produc
tion of "Guys and Dolls" not only ran for more
than 2,000 shows, but also drove critics to hail
it as one of the best all-time shows ever written,
that's a vision about as realistic as man walking
on Pluto by next year. And to complicate things

further, "Guys and Dolls" has been revitalized
and currently is running in the theater, leaving
ample room for unfair comparison.
Yet the technical staff continues to scurry
across stage taping down places for props and
actors, the choreographer still points out that
one off kick and that one lowered chin and the
actors still pursue criticism of their delivery
and their singing.

• Fortunately for all closely involved with the
project, Barlin is not a perfectionist. "The
most challenging part (of directing) is getting
rid of your pre-conceived notions about what
you're going to get from individuals in every
part of the production, and being able to work
from there," he says.
Barlin meets that challenge with much help
from his laid-back directing style and his re
spect for other members of the staff. During
intermission, the jeans-and-t-shirt-clad Bar
lin listens to vocal director Micky Killianey re
count problem areas he noticed while scruti-

nizing the night's
scenes.
A few actors still
have much to smooth
out vocally before
opening night — re
maining in the key,
coming in on cue,
switching from falsetto
to a natural voice with
in a song.
According to Kil
lianey, many of the ac
tors started out with
the idea they we're
simply dancers or ac
tors and didn't realize
they possessed other
talents, such as
singing. With little
self-confidence boost
and a lot of practice,
though, the students
tackled the task at
hand.
"Many of them
have the notes," Kil
lianey explains, citing
the Hot Box dancers'

former belief that they could not sing as an ex
ample. After encouraging them and working
with them, he says, "Their voices have im
proved tremendously."
Singing proved more of a challenge for
many of the male actors, however. Because
"Guys and Dolls" calls for men with high voic
es and most of Stanford's male cast members
are baritones, the staff threw around several

different coping strategies, from lowering the
highest male part an octave to transposing
everything down.
"We decided to cast a female (as Big Julie)
to ease the stress on the tenors," Killianey adds.
Along with musical alterations, the staff re
worked parts of the script in an attempt to
modernize the plot. Keep in mind the story:
main character Sky Masterson (Jason May
land) bets fellow low-life Nathan Detroit (Paco
Farias), an incurable gambler, that he can get
any girl to go with him to Havana, Cuba.
Convinced Masterson cannot sway every
girl, Detroit picks out Sarah Brown (Gina Sil

verman), a naive missionary girl, for the chal
lenge. Masterson, carrying out his portion of
the deal, poses as a "sinner" interested in con
verting and succeeds in manipulating Sarah
into flying to Cuba with him.
As the plot progresses, sexist tidbits about
the differences between "guys" and "dolls" lit
ter the road to the conclusion. It's no wonder
updating was on the agenda.
"Sarah Brown is written as this very meek
and very passive character," Barlin says. "Just
in reading the show over and seeing various
productions, I just came to the conclusion that
this is not a woman that is really believable on
stage anymore.
"If an audience today especially a Stanford
audience, is going to enjoy a production, then
they have to be interested in the characters and
care about them," he adds. "So you have to
make Sarah more of a person."
Although Barlin and company updated the
book, much of rounding out Sarah was left to
Silverman — quite a task for any actor in a play
that has the depth of a cookie sheet.
"It's hard to think about something that
you're not supposed to think about," Barlin
explains. "The presentation isn't supposed to
evoke thought, but that doesn't mean you
don't think about what goes into it."
Like the way lead actress Tammy Jones
(Adelaide) thinks when comically moving her
large brown eyes to the left, to the right,
straight ahead, all to the beat of the music re
sounding from the orchestra pit. Like the way
choreographer Kristin McDonald thinks
when adding nuances to graceful dance
moves.
Like the way Barlin thinks when tackling

one of the greatest of Broadway hits, succeed
ing by creating a lively and colorful produc
tion true to the entertaining spirit of the 1950
original. ■

got when they first saw the show on Broadway."
Considering that the original 1950 produc
tion of "Guys and Dolls" not only ran for more
than 2,000 shows, but also drove critics to hail
it as one of the best all-time shows ever written,
that's a vision about as realistic as man walking
on Pluto by next year. And to complicate things

further, "Guys and Dolls" has been revitalized
and currently is running in the theater, leaving
ample room for unfair comparison.
Yet the technical staff continues to scurry
across stage taping down places for props and
actors, the choreographer still points out that
one off kick and that one lowered chin and the
actors still pursue criticism of their delivery
and their singing.

• Fortunately for all closely involved with the
project, Barlin is not a perfectionist. "The
most challenging part (of directing) is getting
rid of your pre-conceived notions about what
you're going to get from individuals in every
part of the production, and being able to work
from there," he says.
Barlin meets that challenge with much help
from his laid-back directing style and his re
spect for other members of the staff. During
intermission, the jeans-and-t-shirt-clad Bar
lin listens to vocal director Micky Killianey re
count problem areas he noticed while scruti-

nizing the night's
scenes.
A few actors still
have much to smooth
out vocally before
opening night — re
maining in the key,
coming in on cue,
switching from falsetto
to a natural voice with
in a song.
According to Kil
lianey, many of the ac
tors started out with
the idea they we're
simply dancers or ac
tors and didn't realize
they possessed other
talents, such as
singing. With little
self-confidence boost
and a lot of practice,
though, the students
tackled the task at
hand.
"Many of them
have the notes," Kil
lianey explains, citing
the Hot Box dancers'

former belief that they could not sing as an ex
ample. After encouraging them and working
with them, he says, "Their voices have im
proved tremendously."
Singing proved more of a challenge for
many of the male actors, however. Because
"Guys and Dolls" calls for men with high voic
es and most of Stanford's male cast members
are baritones, the staff threw around several

different coping strategies, from lowering the
highest male part an octave to transposing
everything down.
"We decided to cast a female (as Big Julie)
to ease the stress on the tenors," Killianey adds.
Along with musical alterations, the staff re
worked parts of the script in an attempt to
modernize the plot. Keep in mind the story:
main character Sky Masterson (Jason May
land) bets fellow low-life Nathan Detroit (Paco
Farias), an incurable gambler, that he can get
any girl to go with him to Havana, Cuba.
Convinced Masterson cannot sway every
girl, Detroit picks out Sarah Brown (Gina Sil

verman), a naive missionary girl, for the chal
lenge. Masterson, carrying out his portion of
the deal, poses as a "sinner" interested in con
verting and succeeds in manipulating Sarah
into flying to Cuba with him.
As the plot progresses, sexist tidbits about
the differences between "guys" and "dolls" lit
ter the road to the conclusion. It's no wonder
updating was on the agenda.
"Sarah Brown is written as this very meek
and very passive character," Barlin says. "Just
in reading the show over and seeing various
productions, I just came to the conclusion that
this is not a woman that is really believable on
stage anymore.
"If an audience today especially a Stanford
audience, is going to enjoy a production, then
they have to be interested in the characters and
care about them," he adds. "So you have to
make Sarah more of a person."
Although Barlin and company updated the
book, much of rounding out Sarah was left to
Silverman — quite a task for any actor in a play
that has the depth of a cookie sheet.
"It's hard to think about something that
you're not supposed to think about," Barlin
explains. "The presentation isn't supposed to
evoke thought, but that doesn't mean you
don't think about what goes into it."
Like the way lead actress Tammy Jones
(Adelaide) thinks when comically moving her
large brown eyes to the left, to the right,
straight ahead, all to the beat of the music re
sounding from the orchestra pit. Like the way
choreographer Kristin McDonald thinks
when adding nuances to graceful dance
moves.

A woman orders the house lights cut down.
An eerie orange light seeps from the floor, cen
ter stage.
Just then a tall, well-built actor enters stage
left and joins another actor already in place.
They commence the scene, lift the trap door
and are greeted by smoke billowing from the
orchestra pit below. Shortly after the actors
drop into the hole, the woman asks director
Dave Barlin, "How does it look?"
Barlin replies, his temperate voice drowned
by the din of stage crew shouting orders, actors
wandering around behind him reciting lines
and a flutist in the orchestra practicing a part
missed during one of the earlier scenes.
Welcome to the way Barlin and his 28-
member cast spend Saturday nights. And
weekday nights. And whatever else it takes to
produce the best version of musical "Guys and
Dolls" they possibly can.
When Barlin first interviewed with produc
er Todd Feldman, he presented his vision of
Ram's Head's spring show as bringing "out the
same reaction from the audience that people
got when they first saw the show on Broadway."
Considering that the original 1950 produc
tion of "Guys and Dolls" not only ran for more
than 2,000 shows, but also drove critics to hail
it as one of the best all-time shows ever written,

on Pluto by next year. And to complicate things

further, "Guys and Dolls" has been revitalized
and currently is running in the theater, leaving
