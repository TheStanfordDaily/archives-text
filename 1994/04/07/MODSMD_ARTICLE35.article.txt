With their latest release, "Pale Sun, Crescent Moon," the
Cowboy Junkies stake out new musical territory.
After having defined themselves since 1986 by the
hushed blues guitar of Michael Timmins and the
eerily haunting voice of his sister Margo, they have moved on
to a very electric-sounding and guitar-driven album.
Gone are the harmonicas and mandolins which infused
"The Trinity Sessions" and"The Caution Horses." Gone for
the most part is the pop-edge which informed many of the
tracks on "Black Eyed Man." In their place lies a sound which
tries to balance a harder electric sound with the ever-tran
scendent voice of Margo. The change has only increased their
popularity — their upcoming show at Dinkelspiel Auditori
um April 13 sold out in three hours.
I was able to speak with Michael while he took a break
from touring in Houston, Texas.
Intermission Magazine: I spoke with Margo a few years ago
when "Black Eyed Man" came out and she said that there
were a couple of things which she was aiming at doing on that
album — things like harmony and a duet, which became the
song with John Prine. Was there anything which you were
particularly aiming at on "Pale Sun, Crescent Moon"?
Michael Timmins: I think on this one it was more of a musi
cal thing. We wanted to make this record more electric
sounding and simplify the instrumentation, and see what
happened once we did that — to get it down to a two guitars,
bass and drums format. That was sort of the main goal on
this one.
IM: "Murder in the Trailer Park" got quite a bit of commer
cial alternative air play last time around, which I'm sure
brought Cowboy Junkies to a new audience which had not
experienced you before. On this album you're covering J
Mascis' "The Post" (off Dinosaur Jr.'s album "Bug"). Is that a
direction in which you're comfortable heading?
MT: Yeah, I mean it's been happening naturally. You're right
that on "Black Eyed Man," "Murder" was definitely the song
which signaled the direction in which this one was going to
head in. A large part of that was the addition of Ken Meyer on
lead guitar. He played a lot of lead guitar on "Murder" and
then he joined our touring band. Our music was sort of head
ing in that direction by itself, and then with Ken being there
we had the sound with his guitar. When we came to write the
new album, I definitely knew we wanted to use Ken quite a bit
on this one. These things sort of happen naturally, but you
have to be able to recognize them and let them go in a certain
direction, and that's what happened.

IM: But there are still songs on the new album which hearken
back to — I don't know if we could call it the "old Cowboy
Junkies" — but certainly what you had done previously.
MT: There are still some quiet songs. We'll always have that.
Margo really shines on those quiet ballads — 1 really like
writing them, and the band's really good at playing them. So
we're never going to abandon what we do. We sort of add

different elements to it. Some elements will be submerged
a little bit, but there will always be that Cowboy Junkies

sound in there, which is sort of that trance-like feel on
some songs.

IM: The vocals seem recorded further back this
time, and it seems harder to hear the actual lyrics
on this one than on "Black Eyed Man" or "The
Caution Horses."
MT: That's interesting. You might be right. It's

not something we do consciously. It's just where we feel they
fit best and then we put them there. This is definitely a dark
er record than "Black Eyed Man", and it helps if the music is a
bit more swamping. Not swamping, but touching the vocals
so it gives a bit more of an ominous feel. It's nothing con
scious. You do it in the mixing stage, and wherever the vocals
seem to fit, that's where you put them. With more poppier
songs — and I think there were more on "Black Eyed Man"
— you really want the vocals up top because of the melodies
and things like that.

IM: I'm interested in your decision

to do the J Mascis song.
MT: The way we pick our

covers is sort of a different
criterion. We always

want a cover to com

plement both lyri
cally and musi

cally the origi
nals which are

going to be on

the album

with it. J's
song seemed

to do that,
both lyrically
and with the
whole elec
tric vibe for
the record. It

certainly
worked on

that level. And
then, once we
begin to work

on a song, we
want to feel that

we can do some
justice to it and
give it some of our
own personal
stance and per

sonality. . .
I'm a big Di
nosaur Jr.

fan and
I've al
ways

liked J's writing, especially his melodies and
lyrics 1 think are really cool.
IM: As you said, there is a definite difference
between this album and the previous one.
Your choice of the Dinosaur Jr. cover repre
sents a change from previous covers of more
blues and folk artists. Have you had different
influences over the past few years which have
catalyzed your shift in musical direction?
MT: Hopefully anybody's life over two years
is going to have different things coming into
it. There's always that element.
A lot of these songs talk about relation
ships which are a bit more developed than the
ones on "Black Eyed Man." That's certainly
the case in my life. My marriage is that much
older. The "Black Eyed Man" songs were
written really when I had just met the woman
who would eventually end up being my wife.
A lot of the ideas and thoughts were formed
during that phase in my life. These ones are
written four years into my marriage. If there's
an element of personal experience in them,
that's where they're coming from. Then I've
taken those experiences and extrapolated
them and used my imagination. So no influ
ences as far as literature goes, but just changes
in my own life.

IM: There must be a tendency on the part of
listeners to link your music and lyrics to
Margo's state of mind, since she's the one
who's singing them. When we look at the
i development of Cowboy Junkies we
I tend to see a unified development

rather than a movement of four sepa
rate individuals. Do you ever feel like
you lose your own identity within the
group?
MT: That's a good question. You're
right. As the writer, 1 find that my
identity is there. Certainly it's sub
verted a bit, as you mentioned, by peo
ple taking those lyrics and often
putting them in Margo's mind. A lot of
people would thirtk that Margo writes
the words, which is good. That's the

power of Margo s interpretative powers.
That element to the hand — how it's
perceived and how people approach us
— doesn't really affect me that personal
ly.
My identity comes when I'm writing
songs, and that's really where I find my
place. It hasn't really affected me in that

way. It doesn't bother me when people
interpret the songs to be Margo's

thoughts or ideas. To me that's a
good thing because it means

7 — — Q
Margo's doing her job well. By
the time Margo's singing the

songs, I've sort of aban
doned them. I write them

and then once I give
them to Margo 1 figure

they're her songs.
I've done my part

and gotten what I
need to get out of
, them.
k

IM: The last

two songs
on the new

a 1 b u in
make a
definite
state-

ment about the problems women face in
today's society. In the past you have written
songs about women and unfaithfulness, but
these two are the first ones which raise the
tension between male and female to a level of
danger and violence. The danger, especially
on "Hunted," is put in the form of a general
ized man. It's something different. Where
did that come from?
MT: I think that's my anxiety. It's part of what
we talked about earlier — my relationship
with my wife growing over four years and be
coming more attached to her presence in my
life. And the worry that something so random
as violence outside of what I can protect her
from could happen. It's a constant, constant
presence these days, and it's obviously getting
worse and worse. It just boggles my mind. We
have no idea as males how females live within
society. lust walking down the street, whether
it's night or day, their whole way of analyzing
a situation or a day or a climate is different
than ours. I've been thinking about that a lot.
It just began to become stranger and stranger
the more I thought about it.
IM: Especially given that we're men.
MT: Exactly. We are the enemy. Even if indi
vidually you are not, generally you are the
enemy. Even if I'm walking down a street at
night by myself and 1 see a woman coming to
wards me, I realize that I am a threat to this
woman. She is looking at me wondering,
"What's this guy all about, and what's going to
happen?" And that's really unsettling.
IM: And that undermines the stress on per
sonal relationships which exists at the begin
ning of the album.
MT: A lot of these songs are about personal
relationships and things that can go wrong in
them. Most of the songs are about things that
you have some control over. But it seems like
you have absolutely no control over this. It's
just those weird little quirks of fate or timing
that can screw an entire life up.
IM: There's been a great increase in the num
ber of female-based bands since "Black Eyed
Man" came out. Up until now, rock has been
primarily male-dominated. Is this a needed
change?
MT: Yeah. Especially the female songwriters
who are coming out now. There are some real
ly great ones — Liz Phair, for example. It's a
whole new type of writing which hasn't been
done before really. Women now can express
themselves as grittily as men have been able to
without people turning off. Female songwriters
in the past — Patti Smith excluded, of course—
have had to be genteel and poetic and haven't
been able to get down and dirty. I think that's
changing. It's a whole new slant on things.
IM: Canada has laws which require that 30
percent of music on the radio be from Cana
dian bands, and I know that many people up
there are thankful that you're Canadian. Do
you think that regulation is needed to main
tain a national identity?
MT: Well, in Canada it's a big debate which is
raging once again. 1 don't even look upon it as
a national identity. I look at it as economics.
Regulation is needed to support the industry
itself. I don't think that Canadian content
laws on the radio are going to allow artists to
express themselves as Canadians, but it's
going to keep enough money in the system to
allow them access to the technical tools to at

least attempt to express themselves as Cana
dians.
Allowing more air play to Canadian bands
puts more money in the Canadian hands'
pockets and in the Canadian companies'
pockets and that gets filtered down to the
studio engineers and the studio owners, and
all the guest musicians, and then the clubs.
The Canadian music industry is very strong
right now and I think that's due largely to the

"A lot of these soup are about personal relationships and thinp
that can p wroup; in them. Most of the sonp are about thinp that
you have some control over. But it seems like you have absolutely
no control over this. It's just those weird little quirks of fate or
limine that can screw an entire life up." — Michael Timmins

radio content laws. Otherwise it gets
swamped like everything else in Canada by
American corporations. There's just too
much power and money behind them.
IM: Which is something Americans probably
could not relate to.
MT: Right. 1 mean, you are the biggest
(laughs). You can't relate to something small
er than you. It's all economics. People argue
about it up there as if it's a cultural issue, hut
it's not. There are so many regulations up
there to protect Canadian industry that I
don't see why the music industry can't have
regulations to protect itself. You're dealing
with songs, but really once you get down to
radio, you're talking product — you're not
talking songs anymore. It's business. I think
it's much needed.
IM: I las the process of making music become
more of an occupation for you? Has it been
tougher to be creative?

MT: There's two sides to that. It's tougher cre
atively in some ways. You can begin to sec
ond-guess yourself because there's more to it
than doing it just because you have to do it,
because there's a desire within y0u.... Now
obviously there's other payoffs. We're obvi
ously making a living out of it, and we get to
tour, and all the things that come with a rela
tively successful band. You have to make sure
that you keep that on one side of your brain

and keep the creativity going on the other
side without the two coming together. That
can be difficult. You can fool yourself into be
lieving that you're doing something for one
reason, but it's totally for another. On the
other side of it, all my time can be put to
wards making music. I don't have to go out
and get another job to support myself. My life
is making music. I wouldn't want it to be any
other way. I think we have balanced the cre
ative side and the professional musician side
quite well. I still think we're making really
valid music.
IM: It must help that you're not really com
peting with anybody else. You're sort of in a
category to yourselves.
MT: That's true. We just sort of do what we
do, and whatever comes out — that's Cow
boy Junkies. ■
