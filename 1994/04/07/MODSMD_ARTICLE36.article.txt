# More than a bit outside
## 'Major League ll' suffers from sequelitis 
### 
1 missed Wesley Snipes. I missed pennant
race fever and good slapstick humor. I missed
baseball one-liners, Jabbu and Bob Uecker. So
I went to see "Major League II."
And all I got was Bob.
That dreaded disease, sequelitis, struck
down a new victim — David S. Ward. His fol
low-up to his 1989 hit "Major League" is a
swing-and-a-miss on a Ruthian scale. It is de
rivative, choppy and takes itself just too darn se
riously. In Uecker's famous understatement
from the original, the sequel is "just a bit out
side."
Using close to the same cast as he did in
"Major League," Ward ends up emphasizing
his actors' weaknesses rather than their
strengths. The best example is his use of the
ironic delight, Charlie Sheen. Sheen, who has
starred in a massive range of films from "Pla
toon" to "Wall Street," has made a name for
himself as a younger Leslie Nielsen recently in
films like "Hot Shots" and "Major League."
But in playing the fireballer-turned
junkballer Rick "the Wild Thing" Vaughn,
Sheen losses his ironic twist and becomes
merely boring. And, to compound his misuse,
Ward tries to mold Sheen's character into a
poster-boy for self-awareness. By taking him
self too seriously, Sheen's character loses most
of his humor and all of his charm.
The handling of much of the rest of the cast
is equally uninspiring. Tom Berenger, playing
the catcher-turned-manager Jake Taylor, is on
the screen too much. Corbin Bernsen of "L.A.
Law" fame, is on the screen too little. And
Omar Epps, who takes Wesley Snipes' place as
the character Willie Mays Hayes, simply
should not be on the screen at all. His butcher
ing of the character Snipes shined in is one of
the biggest disappointments of a movie
fraught with them.
The film looks at the traditionally under

achieving Cleveland Indians as they embark
on their second year under manager Lou
Brown (James Gammon), trying to top a sea
son that saw a division championship, but
ends with an early playoff exit at the hands of
the Chicago White Sox. The team encounters
early trouble due to character reversals of most
of the stars. During the off-season Vaughn
goes from a reckless delinquent to an image
conscious conservative, Pedro Cerrano (Den
nis Haysbert) converts from voodoo to Bud
dism and Hayes becomes a home-run hitter
with only warning-track power. Predictably,
the squad drops its first kizillion games.
Inspired by two newcomers, Japanese im
port Isuro "Kamikaze" Tanaka (Takaaki
Ishibashi) and naive farmboy Rube Baker
(Eric Bruskotter), the team inexplicably
shoots from worst-to-first, winning a second
division tide and taking a 3-0 lead in the
American League Championship Series over
the hated White Sox.
But intervention from the malicious owner
Rachel Phelps (Margaret Whitton) produces a
three-game slide that results in the movie's cli
matic and predictable battle between Vaughn
and White Sox power-hitter Jack Parkman
(David Keith).
The film remains derivative to the end, re
lying on the same plot as the original (chang
ing the Yankees into the White Sox and a divi
sion title into a league championship) and
using many of the exact same gags (from the
Yellowstone park joke to the slide-short-of
the-base). And the movie fails to produce a
sense of time, thereby snuffing any hopes of
recreating the tension-filled pennant race in
"Major League."
"Major League II" is not an unmitigated
failure, however. Haysbert's portrayal of a bel
licose-witch -doctor-turned-peaceful monk is
hilarious. It takes Tanaka's repeated insistence

that Cerrano "get bigger marbles" to help the
power-hitting right fielder realize that passive
ness has no place on a baseball diamond. Cer
rano finally reaches a resolution that combines
his previous aggressiveness with his new
found world view — "Buddha, meet Jabbu."
Tanaka is also a gem. Played by Japanese
comedic star Ishibashi, Tanaka becomes the
team's energetic but non-English-speaking
catalyst. His bat and wall smashing perfor

mance shakes his teammates out of their
lethargy and into the pennant race.
The movie relies on another outstanding
Ueckcr portrayal of the quick-witted Harry
Doyle, radio commentator. And the beautiful
Camden Yards setting is a plus. But the basic
problem lies in the subject matter. Making the
Cleveland Indians successful once is a feat.
Twice in a row is simply impossible.

There's no reason these three fellows should be smiling: "Major League II" is a big
swing-and-a-miss in the originality category.

sion title into a league championship) and
using many of the exact same gags (from the
Yellowstone park joke to the slide-short-of
the-base). And the movie fails to produce a
sense of time, thereby snuffing any hopes of
recreating the tension-filled pennant race in
"Major League."
"Major League II" is not an unmitigated
failure, however. Haysbert's portrayal of a bel
licose-witch -doctor-turned-peaceful monk is
hilarious. It takes Tanaka's repeated insistence

that Cerrano "get bigger marbles" to help the
power-hitting right fielder realize that passive
ness has no place on a baseball diamond. Cer
rano finally reaches a resolution that combines
his previous aggressiveness with his new
found world view — "Buddha, meet Jabbu."
Tanaka is also a gem. Played by Japanese
comedic star Ishibashi, Tanaka becomes the
team's energetic but non-English-speaking
catalyst. His bat and wall smashing perfor

mance shakes his teammates out of their
lethargy and into the pennant race.
The movie relies on another outstanding
Ueckcr portrayal of the quick-witted Harry
Doyle, radio commentator. And the beautiful
Camden Yards setting is a plus. But the basic
problem lies in the subject matter. Making the
Cleveland Indians successful once is a feat.
Twice in a row is simply impossible.

There's no reason these three fellows should be smiling: "Major League II" is a big
swing-and-a-miss in the originality category.
