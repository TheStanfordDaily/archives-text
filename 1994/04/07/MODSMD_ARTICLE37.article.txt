## Belle Epoque 
### 
At the 1991 Academy Awards, Chinese di
rector Zhang Yimou's acclaimed "Raise the
Red Lantern" was widely considered the fron
trunner, having won most of the critics awards.
But an innocuous, little-known European film
— Italy's "Mediteranneo" — pulled off an
upset victory.
Two years later, Chinese director Chen
Kaige's even more acclaimed "Farewell My
Concubine" was expected to win, since it won
first place at Cannes as well as best foreign film
at the Golden Globes and every critics' awards.

But yet another in
nocuous, little
known European
film — Spain's "Belle
Epoque" — proved
to be China's spoiler.
Americans, it
seems, like their for
eign films packed
with bucolic back
drops, bouncing
breasts and sizzling
sex scenes — the
more devoid of his
torical or political
content, the better.
And Fernando True-

ba's male fantasy "Belle Epoque" delivers in
spades.
You've all heard the one about the farmer's
daughter, right? Well, imagine if the farmer
had four daughters — horny widow Clara
(Miriam Diaz-Aroca), horny bride-to-be
Rocio (Maribel Verdu), horny lesbian Violeta
(Ariadna Gil) and horny virgin Luz (Penelope
Cruz).
The plot is the stuff wet dreams are made of.
Fernando (Jorge Sanz) deserts the Spanish
army in pre-Republican Spain. An elderly man
named Don Manolo puts him up for the night,
expecting to put the lad on a train the next day.
But when Fernando catches sight of Don
Manolo's daughters who arrive to spend the
summer, he conveniently misses his train and
returns to the villa.
This kicks off an abridged version of "La
Ronde," with Fernando playing musical beds
with each of the four daughters, naturally sav
ing the virginal Luz (the best?) for last. Trueba
pokes fun at the ability of men to severely de
lude themselves — after each of his sexual en
counters with the daughters, Fernando pro
claims himself in love. But he doesn't have any
thing original or insightful to say about the bat
tle of the sexes, so the whole thing comes off as
a dressed-up Penthouse Forum letter.
Still, Trueba gave the evening's best accep
tance speech — "I would thank God, but I only
believe in Billy Wilder" — a sign he can't take
himself too seriously.
