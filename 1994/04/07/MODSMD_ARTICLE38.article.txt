# The 						Ref
## 
### 
Ted Demme's "The Ref," starring Denis
Leary, Judy Davis and Kevin Spacey, had the
potential to be either a confusing, unrealis
tic, overdone comedy or a film with the per
fect mix of chaos, intensity and humor.
While "The Ref" comes precariously close to
falling into the first category, Demme senses
the fine line he is working with and ap
proaches, but does not surpass, the extreme.
The result is a hilarious, intense and ide
ally cast comedy about a cat burglar who
takes the family from hell for ransom on
Christmas Eve. Leary plays Gus, a thief who
has just botched a burglary. After triggering
the booby trap, Gus is in a sour mood when
he is forced to take a couple hostage in order
to escape.
When Gus spots Carolyn Chasseur, he
suspects he's found the kidnappee of his
dreams — a peaceful woman in her mid
thirties. Not quite. Carolyn (Davis), her hus
band Lloyd (Spacey) and their non-stop
bickering over marital problems make Gus'
worst nightmare materialize. They are more
concerned showing each other up in front of
Gus than the reality of their abduction.
Leary is dead on as he tries to convince the
couple that he is in charge: "1 have a gun, you

do not have a gun. It's a simple equation."
Delivering lines that challenge the lungs,
Spacey and Davis are ideal
Adding Christmas joy to the evening is
the arrival of the rest of the family. With Gly
nis Johns as Grandma the Horrible and
Christine Baranski as the chihuahua-like sis
ter-in-law, the supporting cast is amusing.
Especially ludicrous is the dinner scene in
which Caroline introduces Gus to the family
— all donning wreaths of burning candles
— as her marriage counselor, Dr. Wong.
In the end we actually feel sorry for Gus,
as he is tortured by the antics of the obnox
ious Chasseur family. Especially for those
who have ever dreaded family gatherings, I
highly recommend "The Ref."

missing this.
JR: = If you have money to burn,
this is for you.

time.
