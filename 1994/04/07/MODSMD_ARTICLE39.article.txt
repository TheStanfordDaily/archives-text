# On his way down
## Trent Reznor in his own personal hell 
### 
Sink into your fantasies, into your night
mares, into your illusions about the way the
world works and you can perhaps get a
glimpse of the existential angst that perme
ates the epic new Nine Inch Nails album "the
downward spiral."
Although not every song is a masterpiece
in and of itself, listened to as a whole the
album is mind-numbingly incredible.
You will live vicariously through Nails'
mastermind Trent Reznor's own perverted,
twisted world view — only his tormented vi
sions of life are hauntingly real. You begin the
album experience by being whipped into a
frenzy. Whip-smack, whip-smack, whip
smack — the tension builds to a boil, the
music imbued with a sudden visceral, sexual
energy. This first song, "mr. self destruct,"
with its psychotic crescendo and exceedingly
calm break, sets the tone for the entire experi
ence.
Lines like "i am the voice inside your head /
i am the lover in your bed" are countered by
high pitched and distorted echoes of, "and i
control you."
The swelling themes of sexual, mental, so
cial, religious and existential decay crash
around the songs, which vary from slow funk
grooves to industrialized speedmetal grinds
that crawl parasitically beneath your skin and
make you squirm.
The album leaves no taboo unmolested,
no pillar of morality uncracked. It is a ruth
less, genius dissection of social values. The
high-speed, high-energy dance tune "heresy,"
for example, redefines centuries of religious
philosophy: "he sewed his eyes shut because
he is afraid to see / he tries to tell me what i
put inside of me / he's got the answers to my
curiosity / he dreamed a god and called it
Christianity." The chorus one-ups Nietzsche
and tells us, "your god is dead and no one
cares / if there is a hell i will see you there."

With repeated listens, it becomes evident
that the album is a journey into one man's
psyche as he discards every normative aspect
of his life and tries to pull apart his psycholo
gy from the gut. For example, the groove-ori
ented tunc "closer" examines this man's sexu
al lust and philosophically breaks it down into
its primal nature. It's huge in its stark, per
sonal attack on sexual values: "i want to fuck
you like an animal / i want to feel you from
the inside / i want to fuck you like an ani
mal / my whole existence is flawed / you get
me closer to god."
The vicarious experience gets more twist
ed, more grotesque as the album proceeds to
fill the gargantuan holes in human interac
tion that the popular media won't touch.
From the conclusion of "i do not want this"
which explores the cracks of human desire ("i
want to know everything / i want to be every
where / i want to fuck everyone in the
world / i want to do something that matters")
to the entirety of "big man with a gun" which
nakedly describes the fantasies of a rapist, the
album speeds deeper into its self-proclaimed
downward spiral.
The musical interlude, "a warm place" of
fers a sense of longing, loss, desire and the
need for comfort and shelter which this man
is denied on his way down. This is followed by
"eraser," which hints at this man's desire to be
deleted from society, a hint that his own mind
is too much for him as he completes his
breakdown of contemporary moral plati
tudes.
Two songs later he gives us the most musi
cally striking piece on the album, the throb
bing "reptile." Behind walls of thick guitar
crunch you hear the pulse of the reptile, a
slow, slinky, evocative presence. It also probes
themes of overwhelming superficiality: "she
leaves a trail of honey to show me where she's
been, she has the blood of reptile just under

neath her skin."
The two final cuts on this 14-song master
piece are "the downward spiral," a noisy,
nearly incomprehensible portrayal told in
third person of the man's suicide which leads
into the soft-rock "hurt," a composition of

the afterlife reflections of the man who has fi
nally rejected everything, including his life.
While only six or seven of the 14 tracks
stand well alone, the album as a whole is a
work of unrivaled post-modern genius.
