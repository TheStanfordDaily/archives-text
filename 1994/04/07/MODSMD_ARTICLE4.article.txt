# $25M gift to help young scientists
## Hewlett, Packard donation aids research in science, engineering 
### Marc Lee 
Stanford has received a $25 mil
lion personal donation from alumni
David Hewlett and William
Packard to bolster research in the
natural sciences and engineering.
The gift, made public yesterday,
will be used to establish the Terman
Fellowships program, which will
support junior faculty members in
conducting research.
"The provost and I are convinced
that [Stanford's] long-term health
in the sciences and in engineering
rests on our ability to attract and re
tain the brightest young faculty,"
University President Gerhard
Casper wrote in a letter to the phil
anthropists thanking them for the
gift.
Casper did not release details
about the gift to The Daily and out
side media organizations until after
they were published in Campus Re

port yesterday — a break from the
way Stanford traditionally has han
dled such announcements. A $10
million gift to the Stanford Art Mu
seum last month was handled in a
similar manner.
The research award is named in
honor of the Hewlett-Packard Co.
founders' mentor, the late Freder
ick Terman, who was a provost,
dean and professor at Stanford.
Terman is credited with initiating
the Packard and Hewlett partner
ship and with helping the two men
establish their business in 1939 in
Packard's garage.
"It was his vision that the acade
mic community of a university and
the business community of the ad
jacent area could and should work
together for the benefit of both,"
Packard said in a statement.
As part of the gift, four junior
faculty members will receive fel
lowships each academic year,
beginning this fall. Each recipi
ent will be given up to $100,000
per year for three years and will
be selected by teams of senior
faculty members.
"Both Mr. Packard and I felt
this was a very important need
and would help faculty recruit
ment. We especially wanted to
help junior faculty with their
training," Hewlett said.
Since it has become increas
ingly difficult for junior faculty
to compete with senior
researchers for federal grants,
the purpose of the program is
"essentially to provide start-up
costs and ongoing support," said
David Glen, principal gifts direc
tor for the Development Office.
The fellowship will allow
researchers to use the money for
such expenses as laboratory set
up, including equipment, and to
support graduate students

working with the researchers.
The funds will vary in amount
and will be relatively unrestrict
ed, Glen said.
"It's really a wonderful dona
tion and is so much in keeping
with how David Packard and
William Hewlett have supported
Stanford over the years," said
Provost Condoleezza Rice. The
funding will allow "promising
and bright young scientists" to
make a name for themselves, she
said.
James Gibbons, dean of the
School of Engineering, said in a
statement that the funds will
attract both young scientists
working in industry as well as
new doctoral candidates.
"It's the first program at
Stanford in engineering and the
natural sciences that can be
counted upon and used wherev
er the need is greatest," rather
than in a specific department or
field, Gibbons said.
The gift, Rice said, "is really
such a marvelous thing. They
really do appreciate what Fred
erick Terman and Stanford engi
neering have done for them."
