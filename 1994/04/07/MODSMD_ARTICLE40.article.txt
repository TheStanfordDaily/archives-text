## "Total Destruction" Unsane 
### 
"Are you ready?" intones Unsane at the be
ginning of the band's new album "Total In
struction." The appropriate reply seems to be
"Ready for what?" We're ready for you to yell in
the same old boring way that you do for the rest
of the album. Just think, the band's members
have had six years to perfect this style.
For one thing, they don't sing love songs. At
least, they don't seem to be love songs. The
songs are loud and repetitious, and every once

in a while there 11 be a
solo buried at the end.
It would be one
thing if it were possi
ble to sing along to get
in on the rage a little.
The lyrics could be
printed, but they
aren't. Okay so you're
angry, but what are
you angry about?
Unsane tries to sus-

tain an intensity that is simply tiring by the sixth
sting. "Throw It Away," the sixth track, isn't that
bad, but it comes too late to salvage the album.
The other notable songs on the album are
"Wayne" and "Get Away." They have a sort of
Bauhaus/Sonic Youth feel to them, only not so
intelligent.
Unsane would be a cool band to see live —
the pit would be raging. You could punch the
guy or girl next to you, smile, then puke. Then
you could go home and stare at the albums
cover art and ponder the meaning of death. For
the three albums they have out, the only differ
ence between them seems to be the pictures on
the covers.
The cover of "Total Destruction" is actually
the least interesting, with its bloodied car hood.
One of their former albums pictured a man ap
parendy decapitated by a train.
The song "5.0.5." captures the character of
the album as a whole — except it's possible to
make out what he's saying. "It's all the same shit
look around / It's all the same shit coming
down." If you want to be shocked, buy the new
Nine Inch Nails because Unsane just doesn't
hurt.
