# "New Plastic Ideas" Unwound
## 
### 
"Punk is like the Force and there is a dark
side."
This statement from the liner notes of Un
wound's new LP, "New Plastic Ideas," refers to
scene politics, but also aptly describes the
band's disturbing, despairing, moody sound.
Unwound's faster, louder songs fall into that
hard-to-describe category of noisy, emotional,
discordant punk rock, somewhat like Steel Pole
Bathtub or Drive Like Jehu. An assortment of
seven-inch singles and their first LP, "Fake
Train," consist mostly of this style. And about a
third of the nine-song "New Plastic Ideas" fol
lows along the same lines.
However, the other two-thirds of the album
is what sets Unwound apart from a million
other similar-sounding bands. Songs like
"I lexen7sene," "Fiction Friction," "Arboretum"
and "Envelope" move away from full-on pedal
to-thc-floor punk to a more dynamic, artistic
style like Slint, (old) Sonic Youth or some of
Smashing Pumpkins' better songs. These

songs wander back and forth from slow,
melodic, quiet parts into loud, raging hardcore
parts like an out-of-control punk roller coaster.
"Usual Dosage" takes this dynamism to an
unbelievable extreme. Starting out with a slow,
quiet guitar riff, it moves into a loud, violent
guitar assault with aggravated screamed vocals.
Then the guitars slowly fade out, leaving just an
amazing tribal drum rhythm. Guitar noise
slowly builds up into a burning 10-second
hardcore burst, then, slowly, more tribal drum
ming, then back into more hardcore onslaught,
then slowly the song fades out.
"Usual Dosage" is about drug addiction,
and it takes you through each impassioned
emotion of the experience. I felt drained after
each listen. The song is simply amazing in its
despairing intensity. What's more, the entire
album is arranged to take you through these
emotions over its 40-minute duration. Don't
do anything while listening to this album. Just
turn out the lights, burn some candles, curl up
on the ground and experience it.
Forget "Dark Side of the Moon," forget
"Daydream Nation." "New Plastic Ideas" will
blow you away.
