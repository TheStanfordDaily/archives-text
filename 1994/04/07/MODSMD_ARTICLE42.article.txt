# Passage to India via Castro
## Mountain View's Taj Mahal serves grub on a cafeteria platter 
### Julie Tsai 
Yeah, it's spring at Stanford. So
your wallet's a little light. You're
still feelin' good 'cuz the sun is out.
And succulence is in the tongue of
the beholder, you remind yourself
daily as you make your way
through the Lagunita all-you-can
eat buffet. But when you've had all
you can take, and you're feeling like
something cheap and ethnic, get
thee down to Mountain View's Taj
Mahal.
We dropped in unannounced
after randomly selecting the none
too crowded Taj Mahal from a
whole litter of Castro Street Chi
nese and Indian restaurants and
the occasional pretentious cafe. It's
a cute little place with tables neatly
adorned by bright fake flowers, lilt
ing Indian music piped in, and a
hushed sort of ambiance.
For those not well-versed in In
dian food (such as I), the menu
looked a little daunting at first
glance. But slightly closer exami
nation revealed user-friendly

translations and tidy
luncheon/dinner combinations
which provide a nice sampling of a
variety of dishes.
Among the combination plates
— ideal for the budget-minded
and those afraid of ordering food
in a foreign language — there were
six offerings, including lamb curry,
tandoori chicken and vegetarian
stew, ranging from $5.45 - $7.95
that included seven, count 'em,
seven items. Served on a cafeteria
like partitioned metal tray, there's
plenty of food with which to play
mix-and-match.
Tandoori chicken, barbecued
meat baked to a nice fluorescent
red, went well with the taste buds,
but was a little dry, and the meat
quality—a little scrawny and a lit
tle fatty—left a little to be desired.
So too went the roganjosh, or lamb
curry, only without the red color.
Dal makhni, or spicy lentil
beans, are yummy and have just a
slight kick for flavor. They're also

good and saucy enough to drown
the rice, which was just a tad too
crunchy.
The mattar paneer, tofu and
peas in a creamy sauce, was tasty
and had a similar flavor to the
lentils — no complaints here. It's
also good for rice-dousing. To be
honest, I'm not completely sure
what's in there, because when I
talked to one of the hostesses, she
said something about cheese, but I
didn't taste anything that remind
ed me of cheese.
None of these dishes were of
hiccup-inducing spiciness, so if
you're into that sort of thing, bring
your own Tabasco, or ask the wait
er for suggestions.
In addition to these dishes, you
get raita, a cool cucumber-yogurt
sauce; nan, good flat Indian bread;
the slightly rigid rice; and a smidge
of salad. Somebody told me there's
some nice garlic nan> but I didn't
know about it at the time.
And before you go, wash it all

down with some re
freshing fluorescent
orange mango lassi, a
thinned-out yogurty
drink. The lassi also
comes in a plain,
non-glowing variety.
Altogether, dinner,
tax and tip came out
to $17 for two. You'll
be fairly stuffed, too.
If you're a hungry
man or want to shell
out a little more
dough, there's full
dinners (read: bigger
portions) both k la

carte or with all the accouterments.
Prices range from about $5.95 -
$6.95 for the former and $8.95 -
$9.95 for the latter. There's also a
lunchtime buffet.
Service is unobtrusive and at
tentive, but not particularly con
vivial. That's okay, though, because
they'll help you decipher what you
need to figure out your dinner.

In general I was pleased; the
food was tasteful, the ambiance
was happy, and the price was right.
It's a painless and pleasant entree
to Indian food.
In any case, head down to the
Castro if you can, 'cuz if Taj Mahal
doesn't take your fancy, there are
plenty of other friendly-looking
places to try. C'mon, I know Lagu
nita's not that good. ■
