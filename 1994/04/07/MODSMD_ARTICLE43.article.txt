Ace Ventura, Pet Detective
As the star of a movie featuring a pre
dictable plot and bad acting, comic
Jim Carrey carries the burden of
turning "Ace Ventura" from another
piece of trash into something worth
the price of a matinee ticket. Al
though his wacky pet detective char
acter wears thin at points, Carrey
succeeds in achieving very, very,
very modest goals. PG-13
Angie
Sure, this movie screams "chicflick!"
Vet Geena Davis' portrayal of a pro
totypical New York Italian gum
chomper makes the movie better
than commonplace. While some
scenes seem a little trite because of
stereotypical characters, other off
beat ones work: of note are the
scenes where Angie has to deal with
labor pains, in which she goes into
hilariously inappropriate, expletive
filled spasms. R
Blue Chips
You don't need to be a big-time bas
ketball fan to enjoy "Blue Chips."
Nick Nolte does a good job playing
the crazed basketball coach caught
between ethics and winning. The

athletes chosen to play parts also do
a good job playing themselves. Of
note is Shaquille O'Neal's acting
debut; the multi-media monster plays
his sarcastic and clueless character
well. PG-13
8 Seconds
Sure, a rodeo movie starring Luke
Perry won't be garnering any Oscar
nominations. But for what it is, "8
Seconds" is a charming flick with
broad-based appeal. Throw in some
excellent live action rodeo se
quences and a few corny yet heart
ening cowboy aphorisms and you've
got a movie that may be worth the
ticket price. PG-13
Fiorile
This Italian import has almost all
those qualities which make foreign
films fun going for it: famous direc
tors, beautiful cinematography, cute
actors and the exploitation of a pretty
foreign language. All that's missing is
a deep story: the plot chronicling an
age-old family curse remains unde
veloped throughout. So unless
you're a big foreign movie buff or just
an extremely chic individual, wait for
it to hit the video stores. PG-13

Guarding Tess
Somehow, this boring, boring movie
reached the top of the box office
charts a couple weeks back. But re
member, the movie-going public
who flocked to see this flick about an
obnoxious former first lady (Shirley
MacLaine) and her dissatisfied body
guard (Nicholas Cage) is probably
the same group that put "Ace Ventu
ra" at number one for multiple weeks.
Don't follow like the other sheep:
take a nap in your room instead of
the theater and save some cash. PG
-13
The Paper
As they say in the newspaper biz,
"The Paper" is page one material. Di
rector Ron Howard ably guides a
star-studded cast through a day at
the presses to realistic lengths. And
while some of it may seem melodra
matic or overacted, the theatrics of
the newsroom staff at the fictitious
New York Sun play true to life. R
Reality Bites
So what if "Reality Bites" is another
movie about twenty-somethings
struggling in the post-college world?

Although no shining rays of wisdom
are revealed in the movie, "Reality
Bites" is a fun movie with a refreshing
sense of humor. It's immediate
enough for us college students to for
give its minor flaws. PG-13
Sirens
If you've walked down University in
the last couple of weeks, you've
probably seen the marquee blaring
"Sirens: Be seduced." And the movie
delivers on that promise, alluring
viewers with its surreal, witty, erotic
and original story on the life of Aus
tralian painter Norman Lindsay. In
essence, "Sirens" proves to be an
"art film" in every sense of that term.
R
What's Eating Gilbert Grape?
"Gilbert Grape" isn't just another trite
"coming-of-age" flick. It's a fresh por
trayal of how reclusive Gilbert (John
ny Depp) emerges from the burdens
of family life to find love. The perfor
mances are excellent: Leonardo Di-
Caprio, who plays Gilbert's mentally
retarded brother, received an Oscar
nomination for his riveting work.
Above all that, there's a bunch of
neat symbols and metaphors! PG-13
