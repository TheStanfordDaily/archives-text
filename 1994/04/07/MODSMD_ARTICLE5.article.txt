## Ethnic centers' strategic plan defends existence, funding levels 
### Linda Friedlieb Editorial staff 
After numerous community
meetings, Stanford's ethnic cen
ters have delivered the final draft of
a strategic plan justifying their ex
istence and funding levels to Vice
Provost for Student Affairs Mary
Edmonds and Provost Condoieezza
Rice.
The strategic plan, although
more elaborate in its defense of the
centers than the last draft, retains
roughly the same funding projec
tions for 5,15 or 30 percent cuts. In
addition, it includes a plan to deal
with a 10 percent loss of funding.
Currently, the four centers —
El Centro Chicano, the Black Com
munity Services Center, the Asian
American Activities Center and the
American Indian Program Office

— together receive approximately
$500,000 from general funds.
After administrators have had a
chance to digest the report, they
will meet with some of the students
and associate deans who created it,
Rice said, adding that the meeting
should take place within the next
10 days.
Following the meeting, she said,
administrators will quickly decide
on funding levels and include them
in the final University budget, due
to be completed in early May for
presentation to the University Cab
inet, Faculty Senate and finally the
Board of Trustees.
The final report, titled "Oppor
tunity and Challenge: Foundations
for the Future of the Ethnic Com
munity Centers," is "a good tool for
discussion about where we go from
here," according to Dean of Stu
dents Michael Jackson, who over
sees the ethnic centers. "I think it
provides a good overview of the
work which takes place in the cen
ters."
The plan, forwarded to Rice and
Edmonds on Monday, will likely be
one of many topics of discussion at
tonight's town hall meeting on
"How Budget Cuts Will Effect Stu
dent Services," sponsored by
Edmonds and the ASSU. The
meeting will be held at 7:30 p.m. in
Terman Auditorium.
The report on the ethnic centers
begins with a historical analysis of
the reasoning behind the creation
of the centers. It continues with a
description of their "essential"
functions — including "contribu
tion to the academic mission of the
University," "[supporting] schools
and departments in their efforts to
identify, recruit and retain minori
ty faculty," and "[facilitating and
assisting] undergraduate and grad
uate student development, recruit
ment and retention."
In addition, the report empha
sizes that the funding levels for the

ethnic centers have remained con
stant even as their services have
increased, and that they have yet
to achieve the steady funding base
recommended in the 1989 Univer
sity Committee on Minority Issues
report.
Junior Luz Herrera, one of
many students involved in creating
the strategic plan, said she felt the
process was "really good because
we brought in all the students."
But she added that even after all
of the work, she is not certain that
students' voices are being fully
heard by administrators.
"Everyone's like, 'It's great. It's
wonderful. We're committed to
diversity.' But then there's stuff
like the layoff of Cecilia Burciaga
which makes me doubt," Herrera
said. "I'm afraid they'll say, 'It's
fine that you've done this report,
but we're going to do what we
want.' I'm not very optimistic."
Chris Clarke, the assistant direc
tor of El Centro Chicano, said he
believes the report adequately rep
resents the importance and func
tion of the centers, and that he
hopes funding decreases will be
minimal.
"We're certainly going to be
asked to take on additional work,
so I guess that would be the mini
mal cut," he said. "But it will be
significant from my perspective."
