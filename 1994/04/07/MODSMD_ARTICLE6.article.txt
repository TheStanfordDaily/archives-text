# Battling for the COP
## 'Students' Voice' promises reform 
### Jim Luh Staff writer 
Members of the "Students'
Voice" Council of Presidents slate
promise to draw on their experi
ences working with the ASSU
and campus ethnic communities
to foster close interaction be
tween students and the Universi
ty administration.
Displeased with the passive
stance they say the current COP
has taken on issues such as bud
get cuts to student services, slate
members also pledge to increase
student influence in University
decisions.
Junior Anietie Ekanem said he
is confident that Students' Voice
can build a better relationship

with the administration, "but I
think it's going to take a lot of
work."
Slate members said they will
take a proactive stance, identifying
student issues and presenting con
crete plans to administrators.
"There are different ways of
pressuring the administration" if it
is unresponsive, said junior Mork
Murdock, such as mobilizing stu
dent protest and focusing negative
media attention on unpopular deci
sions.
"Once [administrators] talk to a
whole campus of intelligent stu
dents," Ekanem said, "the lies just
won't hold up."
Students' Voice members have
been prominent in campus ethnic
communities — Ekanem is chair of
the Black Student Union, junior
Lisa Lee is a chair of the Asian
American Students Association,
and sophomore Vanessa Alvarado
is active in the Chicano/Latino
community.

Ekanem said that the leader
ship and organizational skills slate
members have used in mobilizing
their ethnic communities "are all
skills that I think the COP must
have."
But as its members have been
active participants in student poli
tics, Students' Voice will have to
rise above a general feeling that
current and past student govern
ments have been largely ineffectu
al. Three slate members —
Ekanem, Murdock and Alvarado —
serve on the current ASSU Senate.
Slate members said student
government's effectiveness has
been underestimated. But they
also acknowledged that student
government does have problems —
and they plan to correct them.
Murdock said one goal is to
increase the COP's interaction with
the senate, student groups and indi
vidual students. "I think the current
COP has a style that's detached
from the ASSU Senate [and] from
the student body," he said. "It's pos
sible to really share information,
share what our strategy is."
Students' Voice members plan
to use the ASSU dorm representa

tives program to bridge the gap
between students and their lead
ers, Murdock said. The program
fell into disuse this year, but the
senate voted to revive the program
at Tuesday's meeting.

Although all four are under
graduates, slate members said they
are also in tune with graduate
issues. After all, Alvarado said,
"we're potential graduate students
at this school."
