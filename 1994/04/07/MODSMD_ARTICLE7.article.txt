# 'Teamsters' depend on fuzzy dice style
## 
### Miranda Doyle Senior staff writer 
Over a breakfast of beer and
doughnuts in the Chapparal's
cluttered office, half of Hammer
and Coffin's Council of Presi
dents slate haggles over their
platform's finer points.
Students should get a "fair
wage" for time spent on home
work, says "Teamsters" member
Peter Marks, a senior. Struck by
sudden inspiration, he adds that
time spent thinking about a class
should count too.
"How would you do that?" asks
senior Doug Miro, shaking his
head at the idea.
"You could have a form you fill
out," Marks shoots back.
Miro is still skeptical. "People
would cheat," he says.
Suddenly recognizing that
their impromptu brainstorming
session might make them look
less than organized, the two
Teamsters smile. "There's some
infighting," Marks admits.
"I wouldn't call it infighting,"
Miro says, still worried about pro
jecting that polished political
image — a tough job for a COP
slate promising free fuzzy dice
and the return of the Tresidder
bowling alley.
Clad in identical "uniforms" of
white shirts and hats emblazoned
with beer logos, Miro and Marks
trade friendly quips like the room
mates they are. Senior Tony Sirna
and sophomore Scott Gagner are
also on the slate, but Sirna was
busy and Gagner missed an inter
view yesterday.
Making new campaign promis
es right and left — from a gam
bling boat in Lake Lagunita to a
student dental plan to a hunting
trip for entering freshmen — the
slate alternates between semi-seri
ousness and flights of fancy.
"We held a seance and I talked
to Jimmy Hoffa," Marks asserts at
one point.
Miro sighs. "He's a problem. He
makes things up — that doesn't
look good." But Marks will not be
cowed. "I know I talked to
Jimmy," he says, quietly.
Despite occasional lapses into
silliness, the Teamsters say they
are running a real campaign. Miro
points out that Chappie slates
have won past ASSU elections,
though not since 1985. The last
slate they fielded, in 1992, gar

nered only 4 percent of the vote.
"We're deadly serious about
this," Marks says. "We take this
very seriously."
"As seriously as I take my
schoolwork," Miro adds.
With three seniors on the slate,
however, the Teamsters have been
forced to borrow from "YOU!" —
the previous Hammer and Coffin
slate — by promising to rotate ran
domly chosen students into the
COP next year.
They carry their union theme
beyond the promise to secure a $20-
an-hour minimum wage for stu
dents, declaring, "We want to put
the 'union' back in the ASSU" and
vowing to use some "muscle" in
dealings with the administration.
Despite a $100 cut in their
spending limit as a sanction for
campaign violations — they
endorsed themselves in a parody of
The Daily that appeared before
ASSU Bylaws allow campaigning to
begin — Miro says he is not worried.
"We have big campaign surprises in
store; $200 can go a long way."
For a start, they plan to offer
free doughnuts, pinball in White
Plaza and a "Cheers"/"Simpsons"
marathon. A dunk tank featuring
Review columnist Aman Verjee is
a possibility, Miro says.

While the opposing slate is cer
tainly "worthy competition,"
Marks says the Teamsters are the
better choice. "We feel we have a
little bit more to offer in terms of
the fuzzy dice, the bowling alley
and the dental plan," he says.
As for the feasibility of their
campaign pledges, Miro labels the
bowling alley "a dream" but adds,

"We really think the gambling
thing could work. We know the
fuzzy dice will work — you can't go
wrong with fuzzy dice."
Still, the Teamsters are already
backing off from one promise:
there will be no beer truck in
White Plaza on Fridays. "We were
going to be funded by Budweiser,"
Miro says.
