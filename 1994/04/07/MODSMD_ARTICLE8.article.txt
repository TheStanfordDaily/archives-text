Too shy to ask someone out on a date
or just find the Farm not conducive to af
fairs of the heart? "Love Bites" — a new
SCBN program which premieres at 9

know."
Sophomore Julie Zwaska said she was

she would like to be on the show.

from a serious relationship and was dis

into the dating scene, when out of the
