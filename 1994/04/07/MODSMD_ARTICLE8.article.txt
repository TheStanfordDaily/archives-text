# New matchmaking show sparks campus romance

### Jo Marshall Staff writer 
Too shy to ask someone out on a date
or just find the Farm not conducive to af
fairs of the heart? "Love Bites" — a new
SCBN program which premieres at 9
p.m. tonight — does its best to make ro
mance happen, even at Stanford.
The half-hour show, based on the
ABC program "Street Match," attempts
to bring random people together. SCBN
staffers ask unknowing students at pub
lic places suth as Tresidder or Green Li
brary if they would like to be set up on a
date. If the student agrees, he or she is
then given two minutes to pick a nearby
stranger, and the two are later taken to a
restaurant and filmed as they get to
know each other.
"'Love Bites' is an attempt to turn the
camera back upon students at Stanford
and focus on one of the most entertain
ing yet difficult obstacles they face,
which is dating," said junior Matthew

Kuhkowski, SCBN station manager.
Junior John Moore, the producer and
host, said he feels the show takes some of
the pressure out of dating. "People al
ways say that no one dates at Stanford —
with our show we make it easier for peo
ple to meet because we go and ask the
person for them," he said.
Moore added that the show does not
just cater to heterosexuals. "We don't as
sume anyone's sexuality when we ap
proach people," he said. "We just ask
them to choose someone they don't
know."
Sophomore Julie Zwaska said she was
at Tresidder with a friend when she was
approached by sophomore Mariam Maq
sood, the associate producer, and asked if
she would like to be on the show.
"Ironically I'd recently broken up
from a serious relationship and was dis
cussing with a friend about getting back
into the dating scene, when out of the

blue the TV crew turned up," said
Zwaska.
Initially, Zwaska said she was
very excited at the prospect of
going on a date, although she was
also worried that she would look
bad on camera or have a bad date.
"It's another thing to look stupid if
you're playing a role but not if
you're being yourself," she said.
Zwaska was given two minutes
to choose a date from anyone on
the Tresidder patio that she didn't
know, finally settling on junior
Rowan Sandel because she recog
nized his companions.
"I was terrified about going out
with a total stranger and I recog
nized his (Sandel's) face, but knew
nothing else about him," said
Zwaska.
Once Zwaska had chosen her
date, the camera crew approached
Sandel and asked him if he would
accept. "I didn't know what to
think — I thought it was a joke,"
he said.
Sandel said he decided to go on
the date partly because he hadn't
had a date for a while and partly
because it was a "free meal," he
said. "There's not much of a dating
scene at Stanford," he added.
Two days later, the couple —
accompanied by the camera crew
— were taken out for a meal at Flo
rentine's, an Italian restaurant in

Palo Alto. The restaurant spon
sored the show, giving free meals
to the prospective couple in
exchange for the publicity, Moore
said.
Junior John Wu, the show's
director, asked Zwaska and Sandel
to try and be as natural as possible,
since the camera was right in front
of them. "We don't have the tech
nology to be a fly on the wall . . .
and anyway putting people on
guard produces more interesting
things," Wu said.
At the restaurant, Zwaska said
she was very worried about saying
anything on camera that might
offend someone and also about the
way she would look. "All the time I
was eating the thought would go
through my mind that 'television
makes you look 10 pounds heav
ier,' " she said.
Sandel said he enjoyed the meal
and is glad he went on the date.
"Julie is very attractive, definitely
smart and really cute," he said.
Zwaska has seen Sandel again
but only as "a friend," she said.
"I'm glad I got to know him better
but there's nothing romantic
there."
Four more episodes of "Love
Bites" are yet to be filmed. The
show will air on alternate Thurs
days on Channel 10 and will fea
ture different couples and differ
ent restaurants. Sites for the
choosing of potential couples will
include Green Library, the Coffee
House and social events, Moore
said.
