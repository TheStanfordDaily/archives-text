# Family research center fails from lack of funds
## 
### Scott Van Winkle Staff writer 
A University center devoted to studying chil
dren will fail to reach its twenty-first birthday
because operating funds have fallen short.
The Stanford Center for the Study of Fami
lies, Children, and Youth, founded in 1974 to
support interdisciplinary family research, will

move out of its office on June 30, according to the
center's director Shirley Feldman.
The 45 Stanford researchers who were associ
ated with the center will retain positions within
their individual departments, but the center's fa
cilitation of interdepartmental projects and pro
vision of preliminary seed money will end.
Two staff members, including Pat Shallen
berger, who has served as the center's adminis

trator for 15 years, will be laid ofT. Neither has
been offered another University position.
The center's steering committee decided to
close the center because they could not find
funds to cover the administrative, or "core,"
costs of the center, Feldman said.
The University does not provide funding for
non-departmental research cen
ters, which must be "more or less
self-sufficient" in attracting both
research grants and administra
tive support funds from private
sources, she said.
"We have generous donors, but
no donor or foundation is going to
repeatedly fund administrative
costs ... and I understand that,"
Feldman said.
Hoover Fellow Alex Inkeles,
whose research on troubled ado
lescents was supported by the cen
ter, called the lack of University
support for interdisciplinary
research centers a "serious mis
take."
"It raises the question of
whether or not this is the kind of
activity that [the University finds]
important," he said. "No one rais
es the issue of whether depart
ments are entitled to core sup
port."

While Feldman said the Uni
versity-wide budget cutting affect
ed the center "indirectly" by limit
ing the University's ability to
cover short-term expenses, Inkeles
was more critical.
"The cost-containing (process)
has put the departments in a rela
tively protected position," he said,
while centers are left to bear the
brunt of decreased funding.
Feldman said last week's layoff
of Associate Dean for Student
Affairs Cecilia Burciaga "puts (the
center's closure) into a context"
by showing that "we're not
alone." She also lamented the loss
of "one of the few interdisci
plinary centers in the country
that really worked on these
issues."
The center has supported stud
ies on such issues as welfare
reform, homelessness and custody
law which have produced many
books and journal articles.
"To solve the complex, multi
faceted problems of families, we
need a multidisciplinary
approach," Feldman said.
