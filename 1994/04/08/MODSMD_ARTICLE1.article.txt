# Job offers? Maybe. Budget cuts? No.
## A 						reprieve for the CPPC 
### Romesh Ratnesar Editorial staff 
Not even the most absorbed job-hunting
senior could ignore the levity in the air at the
Career Planning and Placement Center
Wednesday.
While students grimly searched old files
and thumbed through catalogs, CPPC
staffers brimmed with excitement, whisper
ing and giggling like mischievous school
children.
The center had just been notified that the
expected $50,000 cut in its funding had been
reduced to $25,000, perhaps saving a staff po
sition in the process. "We weren't very quiet

about it, I'm afraid," said CPPC director
Ruth Schneider.
The best was still yet to come. Yesterday
Provost Condoleezza Rice disclosed that she
had canceled the entire $50,000 cut, leaving
the CPPC totally unscathed by the budget
ax's swing at student services.
"I see a service being validated," Schnei
der said.
But in addition to leaving one of the cam
pus' most widely-used student resources in
tact, the center's reprieve also represents a
triumph for the Council of Presidents and re
flects the relatively benign fallout from the
much-feared budget cuts to stu
dent services.
Until Monday, there was every
indication that the CPPC would
suffer from a substantial hit. The
$50,000 cut, which would likely
have affected the center's coun
seling services, remained on Stu
dent Affairs' ledger, just days
before cuts to that administrative
unit were to be announced.
"This was a pretty final cut,"
Rice said. But behind the scenes,
an 1 lth-hour effort by COP mem
bers Jason Snyder and Delia
Lopez to spare the center was
underway.
Shortly before winter break,
members of the COP reviewed
the latest budget numbers with
Rice. "Is there anything here that
will have a really big effect?" Rice
asked the presidents. When they
pointed to the swipe at the CPPC,
Rice instructed them to "do some
analysis" on the possible effect to
the center.
"The reason we targeted the
CPPC is that this particular
reduction would have a great

impact ... on a service to all stu
dents of all backgrounds, includ
ing graduate students," Snyder
said, adding that cuts in other
areas were fairly minimal. "This
proposal had already made its
way to the end of the process."
Lopez and Snyder conferred
with Schneider and Registrar
Roger Printup to discuss what a
$50,000 loss would augur. "I told
[Snyder] that a $50,000 cut
would mean we would be looking
at a personnel cut," Schneider
said.
On Monday, the COP sent Rice
a memo that detailed the nature
and extent of the center's use to
graduating seniors and argued
that "the CPPC will be forced to
lower the quality of its counseling
services." The memo also claimed
that a significant reduction in
funding would constrain any pos
sible reforms to the center pro
posed by the Commission on
Undergraduate Education.
"The COP's argument really
resonated about how much peo
ple depended on that service,"
Rice said. On Wednesday, Rice
notified Vice Provost for Student
Affairs Mary Edmonds that she
had halved the planned cut to the
CPPC. Yesterday Rice abandoned

the cut altogether, professing
that she initially "just messed up
the numbers a little bit."
When asked whether he had
confidence the provost would be
won over, Snyder admitted,
"Well, no. We did the best we
could with what we had. I was
pleasantly surprised to find a
complete reduction."
In actual fact, comparable
efforts have not proven so persua
sive. "There have been a lot of
appeals," Rice said, "but only a
few have succeeded."
In the end, the provost said she
realized that with the CPPC, and
perhaps in other arenas of the bud
get, only so much can be cut before
the quality of the University's ser
vices is compromised. "People
made the case that there just
wasn't any other way to perform
this function — it would just be a
flat-out cut in service," she said,
reflecting on the administration's
turnabout. "It's not as if it could be
picked up by another office.
"There are a lot of good causes
out there that are in trouble,"
Rice continued. "You can't do this
lightly. The CPPC has such wide
applications, so many people
depend on it, that I didn't have
much choice."
