A week ago, The Daily printed
its annual April Fools' issue with
its traditionally fake front page.
However, the lead story "Book
store to reimburse students for
overpricing" actually fooled about
75 people, according to Bookstore
officials, into approaching the
Bookstore's customer service
window for a nonexistent $47.80
refund.
The Daily regrets any inconve
nience it caused the Bookstore
and its customers.
In addition, yesterday's article
on a $25 million donation to Stan
ford incorrectly identified the
donors as William Packard and
David Hewlett. Their names are
actually David Packard and
William Hewlett.
