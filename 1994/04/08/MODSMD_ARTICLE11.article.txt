## Clinton calls for Gorazde protection 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Clinton
administration is calling for the quick
dispatch of hundreds of U.N. peacekeep
ers to Serb-encircled Gorazde in eastern
Bosnia and vowing to have NATO air
power defend them if they are attacked.
In a policy speech, Anthony Lake, the
national security adviser, said yesterday
"a contingent of U.N. forces should soon
be on its way to Gorazde. It is important
that this happen as soon as possible."
Other administration officials said
the plan was being put on a fast track
and that it would involve hundreds of
Ukrainians and also British and French
troops already on peacekeeeping duty
elsewhere in the Balkans.
If the Serbs attacked the peacekeep
ers they would risk a NATO air strike,
the officials said.
"Let me be clear," Lake said at Johns
Hopkins University in Baltimore. "Nei
ther the president nor any of his senior

advisers rules out the use of NATO
power to help stop attacks such as those
against Gorazde."
The carefully drawn statement was
designed to alert the Serbs and the rest
of the world that Defense Secretary
William Perry and Gen. John Sha
likashvili subscribed to the ultimatum.
Earlier this week, Perry and Sha
likashvili, chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, ruled out any military action at
this stage to try to lift the siege of
Gorazde and its predominantly Muslim
population of 65,000.
Pentagon spokeswoman Kathleen
deLaski said yesterday "there's no day
light" between the Defense Department
and the State Department on using
force in Bosnia.
"Both departments are in complete
agreement that you should look at all
your options at all times in Bosnia. . . .
We're not ruling out the use of force as

a way to stop bloodshed or promote th< i
peace process. Those are the objectives
in Bosnia. And no one has said anything
to the contrary as a general concept,"
she said.
The United States stands ready to
transport the Ukrainians, most of
whom would come from Kiev, to a stag
ing area, deLaski and other officials
said.
The officials cautioned, however, that
it was not clear whether the Serbs would
try to block the peacekeeping mission.
Approval by the United Nations was
considered a virtual certainty.
The officials said there are now 15
peacekeepers on the ground in Gorazde.
Gorazde was declared a "safe area"
by the U.N. Security Council last year
and NATO committed itself to using its
air power to stop attacks on the town.
"We stand by that commitment,"
Lake said.
