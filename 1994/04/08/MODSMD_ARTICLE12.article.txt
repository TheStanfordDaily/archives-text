Israel bans Palestinians
AFULA, Israel (AP) — As thousands
of angry Israelis gathered yesterday to
bury the victims of a car bombing, the
army barred 1.8 million Palestinians
from entering Israel for a week in one of
its strictest closures ever.
The order follows two more attacks by
Islamic fundamentalists yesterday,
including one in which an Israeli was
killed and four were wounded when a
Palestinian opened fire at a bus stop in
southern Israel.
"We plan for Israel to be empty of
Arabs from the territories until Indepen
dence Day," Police Commissioner Rafi
Peled said.
The attacks, which undermined sup
port for Israel-PLO peacemaking,
spurred calls for a suspension of negotia

tions with the PLO on the withdrawal of
Israeli troops from the Gaza Strip and
town of Jericho.
Soldiers killed in Rwanda
NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — Rampaging
troops reportedly killed Rwanda's acting
premier and as many as 11 U.N. soldiers
yesterday during fighting touched off by
the deaths of the presidents of Rwanda
and Burundi in a suspicious plane crash.
The violence in Rwanda broke out
after President Juvenal Habyarimana of
Rwanda and President Cyprian
Ntaryamira of Burundi died late
Wednesday when their plane crashed
while landing at Kigali's airport. The
Rwandan government said the plane was
shot down, but U.N. monitors said they
could not confirm that.
