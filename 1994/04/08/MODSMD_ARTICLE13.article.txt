## Editorial Beyond special fees Student groups should investigate other ways to fund their activities 
### 
IN A YEAR that saw significant
increases in the ASSU special
fee refund rate, one might
expect that student groups would
try to do things a bit differently. Yet
as the ASSU Spring Elections
approach, most organizations don't
seem to be taking the special fee
skepticism into account — other
than raising their funding requests
to insulate them from further hikes
in fee refund rates.
Student groups, however, should
not fall so easily into the trap of sim
ply asking for more money as
refund requests increase. While
these special fee hikes are not
always unreasonable, groups must
be willing to explore other ways to
address this problem — with
stronger efforts to raise funds
through other means and to
increase their support base among
the student body.
Some groups already survive
quite well without the benefit of
fees levied on all students. For
example, the Bridge, which is finan
cially independent from Stanford,
raises all of its funds through its
annual Spring Faire.
Other groups could try to follow
this example. This would not mean
that they would have to become
independent of special fee support,
but it could at least ease the burden
on students' pocketbooks by mini
mizing the fee increases.
The current trend of increasing
refund rates stems in part from
heavy lobbying fall quarter by a
group called the Graduate Student
Tea Party, which increased the rate
of refund requests by 71 percent
from the previous year. Student
groups lost an average of 32 percent
of their funding in the fall (they had
expected to lose only 25 percent);
that rate increased to 39 percent in
winter quarter.

Although it is easy to point to
"graduate student revolt" as the
cause of the jump, the actual rea
sons are more complex. Students,
especially graduate students, are
becoming more and more unhappy
with the way their money is spent
— they want more tangible bang for
the buck and are willing to reject
groups that don't deliver.
Acknowledging this trend, the
ASSU raised the fee-request buffer
zone from 25 percent to 30 percent
to keep student groups from feeling
too much of a pinch from increasing
refund rates.
According to ASSU Financial
Manager Brian Hillger, the ballpark
estimate for the quarterly ASSU fee
that will appear on student bills next
year is $45, up from $37 this year.
That estimate doesn't even take
into account the effects of a pro
posed amendment to divide the
ASSU into two bodies (undergradu
ate and graduate) that would vote
on — and fund — special fee
requests independently.
This system could shift some of
the burden of organizations' finan
cial support, so that, for example, if
only a majority of undergraduates
voted to support certain groups,
those groups would be entirely
funded by undergraduates, raising
undergraduates' fees dramatically
In the aftermath of the decreases
in special fee funding, groups
appeared to be responsive to the
unexpected shortfalls in funding —
and to the way students felt.
But when it came time to submit
their fee requests, there were few
groups that showed interest in find
ing supplemental funding sources
or even acknowledged any need to
tighten their budget belts.
There is something wrong when
fee requests increase so much after
students demonstrate — rather
convincingly — that they don't like
to pay them. Groups must begin to
investigate other sources of funding
to keep fees reasonable and must
find more ways to prove to students
that they are worth their money.
If they don't, the biggest revolt is
yet to come.
