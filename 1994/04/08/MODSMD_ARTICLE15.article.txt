## Greg Waldorf Tough choices: why you should vote 
### 
THE ANSWER: "Because you have
an opinion." The Question: "Why
should I vote in next week's ASSU
election?"
Why? If you have an opinion on the
student groups which should be funded
by all Stanford students. If you have an
opinion on who should be your represen
tative in the ASSU. If you have an opin
ion on whether graduates and under
graduates should separately fund special
fee groups. If you have an opinion on
whether undergraduates should elect
their senators from geographic districts.
Stanford's student government, the
ASSU, is more powerful than student
governments found on most other Uni
versity campuses. The source of this
power is its unlimited ability to charge
fees to its members — the students. The
vast majority of these fees are direct
transfers from the students to the orga
nizations they have decided to fund. If all
fees on the ballot are approved, the ASSU
fee next year will be nearly $50 per quar
ter.
The ASSU fees that will appear on
your 1994-95 tuition bills will be directly
determined by which of the nearly 40 fees
you approve. The outcome of the vote on
fees is by no means certain. In recent
years, most fees have been approved.
However, last year, the majority of fees
were approved by less than 60 percent of
voters. Your vote can make the difference
in approving or rejecting a fee.
A group or board receives a fee for one

of two reasons. First, an organization
may receive a fee because funding it in
this manner is the most efficient form of
providing a student service. The most
clear example of this type of fee is the
Legal Counseling Office, one of the most
popular and beneficial organizations to
receive student funding. Funding the
office is an excellent way for students to
efficiently buy themselves an insurance
policy that covers basic legal services.
Few students know in advance when they
will need basic legal advice. However, by
having every student fund the office,
those who end up needing legal counsel
avoid hundreds of dollars worth of bills.
Every student benefits from having these
services available.
As the years have gone by, however,
more organizations have emerged from a
second category: those that provide a ser
vice for a specific group of people. An
example of this second type of organiza
tion is Spoon. It would be hard to make
any argument against the work of a
group that fights hunger among the poor
and homeless. In last year's election,
Spoon had the most widely approved spe
cial fee request. For these types of orga
nizations, we are essentially saying their
work is so valuable that we will require
every student to support it.
The problem is that the number of
groups we financially support as a com
munity has grown virtually every year
for two decades. Voters could originally
ask themselves simply whether they

believed in the purpose of an organiza
tion or board. No doubt, most of the
groups have laudable goals. Now, howev
er, we need to pose a tougher question:
specifically, is the work of this group so
important that the entire student body
should be required to financially support
the group with a special fee?
In my experience, Stanford students
are incredibly generous with their time
and money in supporting important and
necessary causes. We live in the most phi
lanthropic nation in the world. Charity,
however, is a deeply personal choice.
Hopefully, we all select those causes that
most touch our compassion or our inter
ests and we support them in ways that we
are best able. Special fees are not the only
vehicle through which students can sup
port their organizations.
We must begin to make the hard choic
es. We cannot continue to have the entire
student body support five or six addition
al fee groups every year. I am not certain
what the correct number of special fees
should be. My preferences are probably
different than yours. I do know, however,
that a field of 36 special fee groups
sounds too high. It is time to decide how
many groups we can require everyone to
support. Every $14,000 of special or gen
eral fees approved in next week's election
translates into approximately $1 on your
1994-95 ASSU fees.
Please take the time to vote. Voting

this year is easy because you can
do it from any computer on the
Stanford network. Taking a
refund is not a substitute for par
ticipating in next week's elec
tion. Read the ballot and look at
the amount of fees requested.
Get to know the candidates and
express your opinions.
