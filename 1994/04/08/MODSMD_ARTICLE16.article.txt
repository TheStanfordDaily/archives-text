## Stanford staff member finds romance... at Berkeley 
### 
IN READING Angie Chuang's col
umn in The Daily ("Romance in the
Classroom," April 6), I realized that
she was talking about someone like
myself. Someone whom struck fear in
what apparently is a majority of people
attending Stanford. Someone who all
the students fear the most. Dread the
most. Have living nightmares about.
I am talking about The Hopeless
Romantic.
Yes, I am one of those dreaded people
Chuang never wants to see, at least
right at this point in her life. I am the
scourge of Stanford University. The one
who breaks the stereotype that nobody
has or is willing to have a relationship
here at Stanford. The one thing that
was drilled into mind when I accepted
my staff position. Endlessly bludgeoned
into my psyche, forming my thoughts,
programmed by the media, reinforced
by co-workers, ad infinitum.

It was worse than reading "Dianet
ics" by L. Ron Hubbard. Worse than
watching "The Stepford Wives." Worse
than hearing Rush Limbaugh.
Well, I hate to say, but I must: I
never succumbed to those thoughts.
Never at all.
I have all those happy traits Chuang
wrote about, plus a few more. Like buy
ing every known "love song" of the '60s
and '70s (my favorite being "Let's Put
It All Together" by The Stylistics).
Watching every known romantic movie,
like "Love Story." Watching every
romantic television series like "The
Wonder Years." And the worst one of
all. . .
I have a companion.
Now, my companion and I do not have
a relationship, per se, in the usual sense.
But we share all the hand holding, cud
dling and nuzzling that a romantic such
as myself lives for. Dreams for. Dies for.

All the traits Chuang would die
because of.
My companion and I go everywhere,
always holding hands. During a movie.
Conversation with friends. Driving
along romantic Highway 1. Embracing
each other while overlooking the East
Bay at Lawrence Hall of Science, above
UC-Berkeley.
Oh, did I mention she is a student at
Cal?
Yes, those pesky programmers were
somewhat successful in luring me away
from anybody (and any chance) of any
thing happening here at Stanford. That
even includes having a close companion
such as mine. Mind you, not that I was
willing to take a chance in finding some
one here with whom I could seek some
thing beautiful, something wonderful,
something breathtaking.
Someone who would cry at "Beauty
and the Beast."

But it seems that the best chance I
had here at Stanford was a computer
dating program, filled with requests
from outside the campus. And a student
bulletin board full of unromantic things
for sale. Like three foot refrigerators.
Twelve-speed mountain bikes. Macin
tosh computers. Boring!
Yup. Stanford lived up to its image as
a non-romantic, iceberg-cold, un-loving
community, obsessed with success and
reality (Notice I did not totally slam
Stanford by saying "success and
money.") I had to resort to the competi
tion, the University of California at
Berkeley.
I'd say they're winning.
Ms. Chuang: I'd make the offer for
you to transfer to Cal, but you seem so
happy here at Stanford. . . .
