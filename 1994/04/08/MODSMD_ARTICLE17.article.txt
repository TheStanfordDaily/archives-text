# Croal whines, fails to offer any constructive solutions to problems
## 
### 
In the six months I've been at Stan
ford, my opinion of N'Gai Croal and his
columns has undergone a metamorpho
sis of sorts. At first, I was thrilled to be
at an institution where such a vocal crit
ic of the administration and the status
quo was allowed to air his ideas in such
a wide forum.
Later, my excitement gave way to
boredom as I realized that Croal was
essentially recycling one theme (with a
few exceptions) — namely, that Provost
Condoleezza Rice is out to get us all.
Finally, after his April 5 column, my
boredom transformed into annoyance
when I figured out that no matter what

happens, Croal is going to keep moan
ing about how terrible Stanford is and
how evil the higher levels of the admin
istration — Rice, University President
Gerhard Casper, Vice Provost for Stu
dent Affairs Mary Edmonds, Dean of
Students Michael Jackson, whoever —
are.
Croal does not seem to understand a
few critical points. Foremost, he is not
part of the administration! No matter
how much student involvement exists in
the budget cutting process, there are
some decisions to which we students are
not privy. We have had several opportu
nities to air our concerns, but that is all
that we, as students, have the right to
do.
Second, as far as budget cuts are
concerned, Croal does not seem to
understand they are a reality. I remem
ber that in an earlier column, Croal
asserted that the administration's ask
ing the ethnic centers to cut their bud

gets was essentially an attempt to "de
politicize" the groups themselves! Is
the whole purpose of the ethnic centers
to "politicize" the campus? Interesting,
for the major defense of ethnic centers
is that they make students who may
not be used to coming to an institution
as large as Stanford feel more comfort
able by giving them a place to congre
gate with members of their ethnic
minority. Ethnic centers do not exist to
"politicize" the student body, for if
they do politicize students on ethnic
grounds, that is nothing but self-segre
gation at its worst. At any rate, ethnic
centers are not being singled out for
budget cuts; everyone is affected by
them, and speaking for myself, I'd
rather have the budget cuts come as
little as possible from academic depart
ments.
Finally, it is not enough to complain.
All the same, Croal rarely offers any
constructive solutions; he just whines

about how terrible Stanford is. Croal
tells us what he would do, but he does
not tell us how he would do it. Therein
lies the greatest flaw in his argument.
