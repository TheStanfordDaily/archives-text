## To catch a thief: my failed five-finger discount 
### 
lAM NOT A CROOK. I may net-surf
through alt.sex.bestiality for an eye
brow-raiser now and then. I may leave
a cemetery of failed paper towel three
point attempts on the tile floor near the
trash can in the bathroom. I may screen
phone calls from my parents on weekend
mornings when I am preoccupied with
more intimate matters.
Thou shalt not steal.
But I do not steal. No shoplifting
Vagisil on my way out of Safeway. No
pocketing overpriced generic gummi bears
from Food Service. No pilfering tourists'
roomy, unlocked BMW sedans from the
parking lot next to the Oval.
Yet there I sat, in the periodicals divi
sion of Green Library, looking left-right
left again, ready to pull one over on Stan
ford Libraries. Sifting through New York
Times Magazines for my helpless little
late-February victim. Sitting down on the
comfortably carpeted floor with my
unsuspecting prey, plotting a magazine
jacking as Green had never seen before.
Crazed student, age 21, accused in kid
napping scam.

I sat there, the glossy cover of the mag
azine reflecting my murderous eyes, as I
wondered how I would carry out my heist.
I needed this magazine. Bad. I needed it
for a scant two-page article. I needed it for
one day, and one day only. I would give it
back. It would be "borrowing." Yeah, bor
rowing. Hut I needed this magazine.
A million thoughts rocketed through
my head. I could hide it in my shirt. Bet
ter yet, I could stash it in my bag. When
Green's bag-checker was peering at some
body's II) to let them in, I'd bolt out the
door. That was it — I'd bolt out the door
and when he came after me, I'd kick him
in the shins, push the nearest biker off
her bike and pedal to a smooth getaway.
Like butta.
I took my helpless victim in my hands,
started stuffing it into my backpack —
reviewing shin-kicking techniques in my
head — and began to zip up my backpack.
Then, my stomach knotted up. In an
instant, my head was hot, my palms
began to sweat, I got dizzy and I could
hear the thundering footsteps of every
library employee in a 50-mile radius.

Suddenly the bookshelves began to
grab my wrists like the evil trees in the
Wizard of Oz, screaming to alert the
check-out person. As I struggled to free
myself from their steely grips, they hurled
insults of "thief," "honor code" and "sin."
One of them lumbered over to fetch the
check-out person who would then,
undoubtedly, have me bound with
microfiche and flogged with old Life mag
azines.
Thou shalt not steal.
I couldn't do it. It was just one maga
zine. No one would ever miss it. Still, I
couldn't do it. Back in second grade I went
on a Brach's candy spree — stealing one
candy a week for a few weeks. I'd eat
them in my closet hideout and no one ever
noticed. No one ever noticed, that is, until
my mom's birthday, when I was caught
red-handed. Caught, then convicted of
stealing by my dad with a stiff sentence
that entailed apologizing to the store clerk
and having to watch my mother cry at the
dinner table on her birthday.
You ought to be ashamed.
From that moment on, I would never

again give even a second thought to steal
ing.
I just didn't have it in me.... Soon, I
stopped hyperventilating, regaining my
senses. I jerked the magazine out of my
backpack and looked at it, as it smirked
back at me. It mocked my anxiety. It
goaded me in my panic. It slapped me in
the face, knowing I couldn't steal it.
Go ahead, make my day.
Then an idea popped into my feeble lit
tle head and I smiled a fiendish smile. I
placed the magazine on the floor, opening
it to the two pages I needed, and began to
smoothly tear out the pages. I looked to
the sky, shouting to the library gods in
heated sacrifice, to ensure that they would
smile upon my actions.
I tore at least one-eighth of an inch
before I heard a stampede of Clydesdales
bolting my way. This was it. The gig was
up. Everyone had heard me as I ruthlessly
tore into the flesh of this poor periodical.
Paranoia, anyone?
A mild-mannered gentleman passed by,
outside the glass-windowed wall of the
back room, each step toward the copy

machine reverberating like atomic bombs
in my head. No Budweiser Clydesdales. It
was only in my head. I gasped a breath of
relief. Safe, for the moment.
I looked down at the New York Times
Magazine, which was giggling to itself by
now, and I realized I couldn't steal it. God
damned magazine. I shrugged my shoul
ders and carried it up to the front desk.
"Can you check out periodicals?" I
asked the man at the desk, getting ready
to deliver a slick pitch line to get him to
bend library rules just for me. "Only for
one week," the man said. "Is that OK?"
I looked down at the magazine and
began laughing a shallow, hysterical
laugh. I filled out the form as the man
looked at me confusedly, and waltzed out
of the library. I looked to the sky, tried to
slow down my racing heartbeat and
recalled my mother's tears a dozen or so
years ago.
Only the good die young.
