# No cuts for student centers
## Student Affairs will trim $1 million next year; budget knife spares ethnic centers, other groups 
### Andy Dworkin Senior staff writer 
Although more than a million dol
lars will be sliced from the Student Af
fairs budget next year, no budget cuts
will be made to the campus ethnic cen
ters, the Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual
Community Center, the Women's Cen
ter or Bechtel International Center.
The announcements came at a town
hall meeting held by Vice Provost for
Student Affairs Mary Edmonds last
night. Attended by about 80 people, the
two-and-a-half hour meeting included

about an hour of de
hate on the firing of
Assoc. Dean of Stu
dent Affairs Cecilia
Burciaga as well as in
formation on the bud
get cuts to Student
Affairs.
Edmonds an
nounced last night

that Student Affairs will cut 6.3 percent
— or $1,016,000 — of its more than
$16,000,000 budget next year. The
largest amounts of money will come
from the Dean of Students' office, fol

lowed by the central Student Affairs Of
fice and the Financial Aids Office.
The cuts are part of an effort to trim
between $15 million and $20 million
from the University's budget over the
next three years. Most of these cuts will
come from administrative areas.
The organization hit the hardest by
next year's Student Affairs cuts will be
Tresidder Union, a part of the Dean of
Students' office, which will cut
$216,500 (24 percent) of its $902,500
budget.

The rest of the Dean of Stu
dents' office, however, will only lose
about 8 percent of its more than $2
million budget.
And, Dean of Students Michael
Jackson said, the campus ethnic cen
ters, LGBCC and Women's Center
will not have their budgets reduced
at all next year. The I-Center and
Judicial Affairs Office also will be
spared the budget knife.
Indeed, Jackson said, a grant
from the Irvine Foundation to the
University will pay the tuition for
one master's student to work half
time at each ethnic center next year.
Right now, Jackson said, the eth
nic centers aren't slated to receive
any additional work, either. Howev
er, especially since the Office of Stu
dent Activities has been put under
his purview, Jackson said he and his
staff are currently reviewing the
work done in his office and may
redistribute it in the future.
The cuts to the Dean of Students'
office will come from a variety of
sources, Jackson said, including
eliminating some currently vacant

positions, raising some fees, finishing
a multi-year cut to the ASSU budget
and trying to create $300,000 in new,
non-general fund income from
Tresidder. A task force is currently
examining options to increase
income and reduce costs at Tresid
der.
The sparing of the ethnic centers
came after months of concern and
sometimes intense debate by stu
dents about the centers possibly los
ing funding. While Jackson said he
did not know what cuts he would
have to make in the next two years of
budget reductions, he said his person
al commitment to the centers' bud
gets is "very strong and unwavering..
.. Our goal is to continue these pro
grams and enhance these programs."
While one concern students had
was temporarily set to rest last night,
however, another was the subject of a
long, passionate debate.
Student members of the audience
questioned why Burciaga — a long
time Stanford employee and resident
fellow in Casa Zapata — was fired
from her job last week with relatively
little notice, why no other job was
found for the 20-year employee and
whether the firing was motivated by
the fact that Burciaga had at times
taken vocal political stances.

Students also mourned the loss of
Burciaga as a good role model for
campus and the Chicano/Latino
community and wondered whether
this fact was taken into account in
her dismissal.
Edmonds said that, when exam
ining what to cut, "My decision was
purely made on the basis I that] this
was a position that could go away."
Because Burciaga was in a develop
ment position, and Student Affairs
fund raising will be turned over to
the Development Office, Edmonds
said Burciaga's position was cut.
Edmonds said she did not offer Bur
ciaga a new job because there were no
open positions in Student Affairs.
In fact, Edmonds said several
other positions will also be cut,
although she said she did not know
the exact number of job eliminations
because some areas that report to her
are still figuring out how to make
their cuts.
But several students said Burcia
ga's contributions to campus outside
her specific job should have been con
sidered.
"I know it's a personnel issue but
it has enormous ramifications for
every member of our community,"
said senior Russell Calleros. "Such
personnel decisions do affect stu

dents."
Edmonds said that she recognized
and considered Burciaga's contribu
tions to the Stanford community
when she made the decision to cut
the position.
Also at last night's meeting,
details on the cuts to other areas in
Student Affairs were discussed.
Specifically:
• Need-blind admissions will be
maintained and students will not lose
financial aid, despite a 6.7 percent,
$200,000 cut to the Undergraduate
Admissions and Financial Aid Office,
said Dean of Admissions James Mon
toya. Cuts will come from consolidat
ing admissions and financial aid staff
and cutting positions, trying to
reduce publicity costs, and redesign
ing the calendar to allow early admis
sions and reduce the need for part
time employees to read applications.
• Registrar Roger Printup said his
office will have to cut 2.9 percent of
its budget, $135,500. Printup said
the reductions will be "back-room"
cuts and not affect student services.
The Career Planning and Placement
Center, Center for Teaching and
Learning and undergraduate advis
ing will not be cut next year, he said.
• The Haas Center for Public Ser
vice will cut 5.4 percent of its Univer-

sity-fiinded budget, or $17,500, said
Sue Gray, a clearinghouse coordina
tor at Haas. That savings could be
realized by getting rid of a half -time
volunteer coordinator position, she
said.
• Cowell Student Health Center
Director Ira Friedman said only 1.3
percent — or $52,000 — of his bud
get will be cut through "internal
cuts," substituting one type of staff
member for another. Students
should not see a change in services,
he said.
• Director of Housing and Dining
Services Keith Guy said he will likely
have to cut some money from his
budget, but he does not know how
much. The housing department is
entirely self-funded, Guy said, but its
budget is affected by overall Univer
sity expenditures. Guy said he won't
know exactly what cuts he must
make until other University cuts are
defined.
Guy did say that he is committed
to Residential Education. Some stu
dents expressed concern last night
that the combination of Res Ed and
the housing department would hurt
the former's academic mission. Guy
pointed out, however, that Res Ed
has always been funded entirely by
his department's income.
