### Andy Dworkin Senior staff writer 
Although more than a million dol
lars will be sliced from the Student Af
fairs budget next year, no budget cuts
will be made to the campus ethnic cen
ters, the Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual
Community Center, the Women's Cen
ter or Bechtel International Center.
The announcements came at a town
hall meeting held by Vice Provost for
Student Affairs Mary Edmonds last
night. Attended by about 80 people, the
two-and-a-half hour meeting included

about an hour of de
hate on the firing of
Assoc. Dean of Stu
dent Affairs Cecilia
Burciaga as well as in
formation on the bud
get cuts to Student
Affairs.
Edmonds an
nounced last night

that Student Affairs will cut 6.3 percent
— or $1,016,000 — of its more than
$16,000,000 budget next year. The
largest amounts of money will come
from the Dean of Students' office, fol

lowed by the central Student Affairs Of
fice and the Financial Aids Office.
The cuts are part of an effort to trim
between $15 million and $20 million
from the University's budget over the
next three years. Most of these cuts will
come from administrative areas.
The organization hit the hardest by
next year's Student Affairs cuts will be
Tresidder Union, a part of the Dean of
Students' office, which will cut
$216,500 (24 percent) of its $902,500
budget.
