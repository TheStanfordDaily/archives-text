## Gunning for USC Baseball targets lead in Six-Pac 
### Andy Eiser Senior staff writer 
Major league Baseball may just
now be getting underway, but the
Pacific 10 Conference Southern
Division pennant chase has already

begun.
Even with
more than one
month remaining
in conference
play, the second
place Cardinal
(21-13, 10-5 in
the Six-Pac) trav
els to I os Angeles
this weekend for
its most impor-

tant series of the season, a second
and final three-game grudge match
with pacesetting USC that could
make or break Stanford's hopes for
the conference crown.
Despite its sweep of archrival
California last weekend, the Cardi
nal, ranked 11th by Baseball Amer
ica, failed to gain any ground on the
No. 2 Trojans (27-8, 13-5), who
took three road decisions from last
place Arizona and remain 1-1/2
games ahead of both the Cardinal
and Arizona State. But now, Stan
ford can shake up the standings
with a solid performance at
Dedeaux Field.
"We can't get swept and lose five
of six to them," said head coach
Mark Marquess, referring to the

Trojans' two victories in three
games at Sunken Diamond last
month.
"We need to win two to have a
fighting chance and to have a shot
to do iUwin the Six-Pac title) our
selves," Marquess continued.
Approaching his squad's big
road trip, Marquess can take some
unusual comfort in knowing that
the Cardinal sports a 12-5 record
away from Sunken Diamond this
season, as opposed to a 9-9 mark at
home. Yet even the 18-year coach
comes up empty in explaining this
phenomenon.
"I've never had a club do better
on the road than at home, never.
This is new to me," Marquess said.
No matter where Stanford and
USC meet, however, several
intriguing matchup possibilities
exist. At the top of the ticket, the
Six-Pac Player and Pitcher of the
Week tangle today when Trojan
junior first baseman J.P. Roberge
faces Cardinal sophomore right
hander Todd Bartels. Roberge han
dled 39 fielding chances perfectly
and hit 8-for-14 off Arizona pitch
ers last weekend, while Bartels (4-
1) tossed a complete-game six-hit
ter against the Golden Bears March
31.

just short of conference honors
