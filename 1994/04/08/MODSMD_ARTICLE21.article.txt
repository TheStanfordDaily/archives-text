# Water Polo returns to action in spring tourney
## Everybody aiming at national champions 
### Kyle Utsumi Staff writer 
When you're the best, every
one is looking to shoot you down.
After this fall, when it was
ranked No. 1 nationally for the
entire season, the Stanford
men's water polo team had
become accustomed to facing
teams eager to boast of a victory
over the Cardinal. At the NCAA
Championships in November, it
was Stanford doing the boasting,
as coach Dante Dettamanti led
his Cardinal squad to the NCAA
title.
This weekend, Stanford will
be seeking another championship
trophy to put alongside its NCAA
award, as it plays host to the Sec
ond Annual Spring Collegiate
Tournament, sponsored by Una
Mas Taqueria. The Cardinal (24-
6 in 1993) will be joined by the
top water polo teams in the
nation, including USC, who fell
to Stanford, 11-9, in the national
championship match. California,
UCLA, Pepperdine, Pacific, Long
Beach State, UC-San Diego, Air
Force and Naw round out the

collegiate teams. The U.S.
National Junior Team will also
compete in the three-day tourna
ment.
For these spring champi
onships, teams can use any play
er who will be returning for the
1994 NCAA season who did not
red-shirt in 1993. Because no
seniors will be playing, the tour
nament will be a good preview of
the NCAA season.
"This will be a good indicator
of who will be good in the fall,"
said junior Wolf Wigo.
The tournament will feature
many of the top players in the
country, beginning with Stan
ford's returning 1993 All-Ameri
can selections, sophomore Jere
my Laster and Wigo.
While Dettamanti will rely
heavily on Laster, who is just
returning from playing with the
U.S. National Team in France,
the shooting and speed of Wigo
may not be available to the Cardi
nal next year. The three-time Ail-
American is facing possible
surgery to treat a back injury
