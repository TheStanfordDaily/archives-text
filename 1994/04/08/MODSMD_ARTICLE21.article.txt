# Water Polo returns to action in spring tourney
## Everybody aiming at national champions 
### Kyle Utsumi Staff writer 
When you're the best, every
one is looking to shoot you down.
After this fall, when it was
ranked No. 1 nationally for the
entire season, the Stanford
men's water polo team had
become accustomed to facing
teams eager to boast of a victory
over the Cardinal. At the NCAA
Championships in November, it
was Stanford doing the boasting,
as coach Dante Dettamanti led
his Cardinal squad to the NCAA
title.
This weekend, Stanford will
be seeking another championship
trophy to put alongside its NCAA
award, as it plays host to the Sec
ond Annual Spring Collegiate
Tournament, sponsored by Una
Mas Taqueria. The Cardinal (24-
6 in 1993) will be joined by the
top water polo teams in the
nation, including USC, who fell
to Stanford, 11-9, in the national
championship match. California,
UCLA, Pepperdine, Pacific, Long
Beach State, UC-San Diego, Air
Force and Naw round out the

collegiate teams. The U.S.
National Junior Team will also
compete in the three-day tourna
ment.
For these spring champi
onships, teams can use any play
er who will be returning for the
1994 NCAA season who did not
red-shirt in 1993. Because no
seniors will be playing, the tour
nament will be a good preview of
the NCAA season.
"This will be a good indicator
of who will be good in the fall,"
said junior Wolf Wigo.
The tournament will feature
many of the top players in the
country, beginning with Stan
ford's returning 1993 All-Ameri
can selections, sophomore Jere
my Laster and Wigo.
While Dettamanti will rely
heavily on Laster, who is just
returning from playing with the
U.S. National Team in France,
the shooting and speed of Wigo
may not be available to the Cardi
nal next year. The three-time Ail-
American is facing possible
surgery to treat a back injury
which hampered him throughout
Stanford's run at the national
title.
"It hurts," Wigo said. "I might
play a little (this weekend). If I
need surgery, I'll red-shirt next
fall, so this would be my last
chance at playing for a while, like
a last fling."
With the graduation of four

starters and other key contribu
tors off the bench, Dettamanti
will be looking for successful com
binations of players this weekend.
The most notable newcomer to
the lineup will be goaltender Jack
Bowen, who replaces four-year
starter Larry Bercutt. Bowen
competed for the U.S. National
Junior Team at the World Cham
pionships in Cairo this past sum
mer.
Also moving into the starting
lineup will be freshman Brian
Wallin. Wallin will split the duties

at the center-forward position
with junior Frank Schneider,
whose clutch goal against USC
sealed the NCAA championship
for Stanford in the fall. Detta
manti also expects to continue to
allow Laster to learn the position,
and will use him there periodical
ly this weekend.
Players who will be looking to
take on expanded roles this spring
and next year include Dan Han
cock, Brian Pyle and Josh Leach
man.
In preparation for this tourna

ment, most teams have been
training since the beginning of
March. Dettamanti likes his
team's chances, saying "We're in
the best shape of anybody."
The Cardinal will open the
tournament with two games
today — a 10 a.m. meeting with
Navy, a team they drubbed in the
opening round of the NCAAs, and
a 6 p.m. matchup with UC-San
Diego. Play continues all day Sat
urday and Sunday, with the
championship game Sunday at 1
p.m.
