Its record is 17-2. But to Stanford women's tennis
coach Frank Brennan, the team's record is 1-0. After
the third-ranked squad's disappointing loss to 12th

wipe the slate clean and concentrate solely on the
stretch drive to the NCAA Championships next

The Cardinal travels to the desert this weekend for
its second and third games ol its "second' season. r I he
team faces lOth-ranked Arizona State (8-7 overall, 3-
4 in Pacific 10 Conference play) today, then drives to
Tuscon tomorrow to battle No. 17 Arizona (8-9, 2-5).
To better understand Brennan's perspective, the
squad's season can be broken into three mini-seasons.
In the first, the Cardinal had all cylinders firing in

2 ranking, including victories over then-No. 3 Califor
nia, then-No. 15 Clemson, then-No. 17 Notre Dame
and both Arizona teams.
Then Stanford encountered rough waters. The
first blow was dealt by Florida at the semi-finals of the
National Team Indoors in Wisconsin. The Gators,
now ranked second in the country, narrowly defeated
the Cardinal 5-4. Then, after beating Cal again over
spring break, Stanford traveled to Los Angeles and
lost to the 12th-ranked Bruins in what Brennan
