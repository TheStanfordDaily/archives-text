# Tennis starts 'second season' with Devils,' Cats
## Brennan wants team to put UCLA loss out of its mind 
### Rob Ross Senior staff writer 
Its record is 17-2. But to Stanford women's tennis
coach Frank Brennan, the team's record is 1-0. After
the third-ranked squad's disappointing loss to 12th
ranked UCLA last Saturday, Brennan wants them to
wipe the slate clean and concentrate solely on the
stretch drive to the NCAA Championships next
month.
"USC was the first match of the five-game season
we're entering right now," he said. "I want the squad
to forget about UCLA, move on and think of ourselves
as a different team. They certainly did that against
USC. Now we've got to validate that result by doing it
again against the Arizona schools."
The Cardinal travels to the desert this weekend for
its second and third games ol its "second' season. r I he
team faces lOth-ranked Arizona State (8-7 overall, 3-
4 in Pacific 10 Conference play) today, then drives to
Tuscon tomorrow to battle No. 17 Arizona (8-9, 2-5).
To better understand Brennan's perspective, the
squad's season can be broken into three mini-seasons.
In the first, the Cardinal had all cylinders firing in
unison as the team shot out to a 15-0 start and a No.
2 ranking, including victories over then-No. 3 Califor
nia, then-No. 15 Clemson, then-No. 17 Notre Dame
and both Arizona teams.
Then Stanford encountered rough waters. The
first blow was dealt by Florida at the semi-finals of the
National Team Indoors in Wisconsin. The Gators,
now ranked second in the country, narrowly defeated
the Cardinal 5-4. Then, after beating Cal again over
spring break, Stanford traveled to Los Angeles and
lost to the 12th-ranked Bruins in what Brennan

called "our worst match of the
season."
Soon after its 15-0 start, Stan
ford had sputtered into a 1-2 mid
season slump. This slump forced
Brennan to re-evaluate his squad
which, during the pre-season,
was ranked No. 1 in the nation.
"I frankly don't think we were
quite as good as we thought we
were," he said. "We are not the
dominant team or a dominant
team. We are one of maybe six or
seven teams that could win the
national championship.
"We certainly have the talent
to win it, but we don't have over
whelming talent where we show

up and everyone else falls down
and plays dead."
"Falls down and plays dead"
accurately describes the perfor
mances of the Sun Devils and
Wildcats earlier in the season.
Both traveled to the Stanford
Tennis Stadium and were
stymied, losing 6-0 and 8-1,
respectively.
On paper, the Cardinal team
that competes in the Grand
Canyon State today overpowers
the squad the Arizona schools
saw three weeks ago. Sophomore
Kim Shasby, ranked No. 6 in the
preseason singles rankings, reen
tered the lineup after missing the
first 16 dual matches due to a
heel injury. Last season Shasby
competed in the No. 3 singles
position and won All-America
honors; now she fills the No. 4

slot behind Laxmi Poruri, Kris
tine Kurth and Katie Schlukebir.
Shasby has boosted the Stan
ford team in doubles, as well.
Combining with freshman dou
bles-specialist Emily Burt, she
helps form the Cardinal's No. 3
doubles team. The duo has com
piled a 2-1 record with impressive
wins over the Bruins and Bears.
Going down the lineup, the
Cardinal has had three virtual
guaranteed wins. Poruri is 14-0
at No. 1 singles, having dropped
only two sets all season. She and
freshman Katie Schlukebir are
also undefeated at No. 1 doubles
with a 10-0 dual match record.
Additionally, freshman Sandra
De Silva tops both those marks
with a 19-0 record at No. 6 sin
gles.
Stanford's other regular

starters, Kurth, Berris, Shasby
and Schlukebir in singles action
and the duos of Kurth-Berris and
Burt-Shasby, have usually been
brilliant, registering a combined
53-16 season mark. These 16
losses, however, occurred in cru
cial spurts — against the Bruins,
it was not just one or two players
that faltered, but four, which lead
to the defeat.
The flip side of this full team
faltering, though, was the follow
ing day's plastering of USC. After
that match, Brennan was excited
about how every single member
played.
"We've had some great perfor
mances this year, not the least of
which was USC," Brennan said.
"If we can play the way we did
against USC, we can beat any
body in the country."
