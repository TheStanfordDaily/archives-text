# Off to Regionals for gymnastics
## Men set sights at NCAAs 
### Sam Wu Staff writer 
Living to fight another day is not an option
for the two-time defending national champion
Stanford men's gymnastics team this week
end.
At the NCAA Western Regional Champi
onships tomorrow in Norman, Okla., the fifth
ranked Cardinal must rebound from last week
end's upset loss to now-No. 4 UCLA at the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Champi
onships in Albuquerque, N.M. Otherwise,
Stanford's goal of a threepeat at the NCAA
Championships in Lincoln, Neb., two weeks
from now will be nothing but a dream.
"This next meet is more important than the
MPSF Championships," said senior tri-captain
Chris Sey. "If we don't hit, we don't go to
NCAAs."
To qualify for NCAAs, the Cardinal must
finish among the top three out of a six-team
field at tomorrow's competition. This time
around, however, the Cardinal must overcome
greater opposition than just the Bruins.
Top-ranked and two-time national runner

tention as early as possible. Also,
UCLA — along with New Mexico
and California — will look once
again to slay Goliath.
"Nebraska, Oklahoma and
UCLA will be tough," said head
coach Sadao Hamada. "But as
long as we beat one of those three
schools, we'll make it to NCAAs —
that's all we care about. We'll go to
NCAAs unless something disas
trous happens to us like last
week."
One important factor for the
Cardinal's success will be the lim
ited return of junior all-around
standout Jing-Wei Liang. Though
still recovering from back pains
which kept him from attending
last week's MPSF event, Liang
will compete on the pommel horse
and vault.
"I don't want to push [Liang]
for Regionals," Hamada said. "I
just want his help to qualify for
NCAAs."
According to the coach, Stan
ford has the potential of putting in
a strong scoring performance of
290 points or better — if only the
squad can exhibit more consisten
cy in their routines.
The Cardinal has worked to
improve just that during this

past week. Specifically, Stanford
gymnasts have trained with more
intensity, remembering their
lack of flair and focus of a week
ago.
"We were together emotionally
[during the MPSF tournament],"
said junior tri-captain Josh Stein.
"But we weren't intense enough
about our routines and the compe
tition. This isn't like the regular
season meets. We have to take our
routines and competition seriously
in a meet like this."
To promote concentration and
competitive vigor, Hamada has
tried to simulate the tournament
environment during practice by
requiring his athletes to raise their
arms before they perform their
routines, as is customary in com
petitions.
"I consider things like that a
very important part of my training
program," Hamada said. "It gets
gymnasts in the competitive mind
set. It's what separates good gym
nasts from the others."
Hamada is not looking for his
team to peak at Regionals, howev
er, since all year long the Cardinal
has had its sights set on a third
consecutive national title.
"I don't want to just focus on
Western Regionals," said the
coach. "I want to look ahead at
NCAAs. What we do has to be part
of our training to win the NCAA
Championships."
