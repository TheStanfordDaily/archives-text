# Women hope road doesn't end in Boise

### Vanessa Arrington Staff writer 
The fate of the Cardinal women's
gymnastics team's season hangs in the
balance this Saturday at NCAA Region
al competition in Boise, Idaho.
"If we perform to our expectations,
we will qualify," said freshman Katie
Jennings. "We need to focus now on the
job ahead of us, and then Nationals will
be a result of those efforts."
Team performances at the five
regional competitions across the coun
try are the sole determining factors of
the field at nationals — at this point in
the season team averages and rankings
are inconsequential. Along with the
first-place teams in each region, the 12
top-scoring teams from the regional
sites will comprise the field of competi
tion at nationals in Salt Lake City,
Utah.
In Boise, Stanford will meet Oregon
State, UCLA, Cal State-Fullerton,
Boise State, Washington and Califor
nia. Though Stanford is ranked fifth in
this group, Cardinal head coach Breck
Greenwood expects his squad to finish
above that ranking.
"We think we are the third-best in
the region," Greenwood said. "Some
teams peaked earlier in the season, but
we are peaking now. But unless you win
your region, the placing within doesn't
really matter."
Even if Stanford does not qualify as
a team, several Cardinal gymnasts have
a good chance at qualifying individual
ly. The top-12 all-around individual
gymnasts, as well as any gymnast who
wins an event with a score of 9.800 or
higher, will earn a trip to Salt Lake
City.
In the event that Stanford does not
attend nationals as a team, Greenwood
predicts that sophomore Hillary

Anderson and junior Jene Elzie will
qualify to compete individually. Both
Anderson and Elzie competed at
nationals last year as individuals and
Greenwood pegs them, along with Jen
nings, junior Tina Snowden and junior
Meegan Lannin, as squad members
with a good chance of qualifying.
The lineup for the Cardinal this
weekend will be the same as that seen
in Seattle for the Pacific 10 Conference
championships, where Stanford came
in fourth out of seven teams. According
to Greenwood, the key to success for
the Cardinal this Saturday will lie in
the performances of the first few gym
nasts on each event. If these gymnasts
hit their routines, it will not only get
the team off to a good start in its scor
ing but will boost morale, he added.
Starting out for the Cardinal on the
vault rotation will be junior Jenny
Ward, freshman Ariel Passanisi and
sophomore Linda Chun, who will be
executing a vault that she has only
attempted twice in competition. Jen
nings, Lannin and Elzie round out the
lineup and will hopefully remain consis
tent, scoring in the 9.700 range, accord
ing to Greenwood.
Greenwood feels confident about
Stanford's beam and uneven bar teams,
which he describes as very solid and
calm this year. Seniors Laurie West and
Mollie Brown will lead off for the Cardi
nal on these two events, respectively.
These two are touted as "emotional
favorites" of the team because they are
seniors and because West is coming out
of ankle surgery earlier this season,
according to Greenwood.
Ward will commence on the floor
exercise for Stanford, followed by Lan
nin, who will unveil a new floor routine.

ever to trv a double-back in each of her

Jennings, Elzie and Snowden will
be the finishing competitors.

"We are really ready," Green
wood said. "We have backed
down on training so we can go
into this meet fresh. We are just

going to do our job and let the
judges do theirs. In this sport,
that is all you can do."
Jennings agrees that the team
should stay relaxed and confi
dent: "We don't want to put big
meet pressure on ourselves, but
on the other hand, we can feed off
of the extra adrenaline we'll
have.
"It has been a fun, great sea
son, and nationals would just be
the icing on the cake."
