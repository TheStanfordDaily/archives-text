# Heading down the back stretch
## Track travels to Fresno 
### Jorge Chen 
Before heading into the critical
meets of late April and early May,
the Stanford track and field team
rounds out the first half of the sea
son as it travels to the Fresno Invi
tational this weekend.
"This first whole half of the
season — basically all of April — is
to prepare and gear up our team
for big meets coming up later in
the season," said Stanford head
coach Vin Lananna.
"The Fresno Invite is a good
meet for many athletes to prepare
and qualify for the Pac-10 champi
onships," added Lananna.
Bringing in 25 schools, includ
ing UCLA and USC, the Fresno
Invitational will provide more
than enough competition for Stan
ford's up-and-coming team.
"This will definitely be a big
meet," said Red Eftes, the head
coach of host Fresno State Univer
sity.
The Cardinal goes into the
meet with confidence after recent
ly sweeping both the men's and
the women's titles in the San Luis
Obispo Invitational last weekend.
"This meet should be a good fol
low up to last weekend's team and
individual showings," said senior
co-captain Sarah Truitt.
Truitt also added that this week
end will give many team members a
chance to put up big performances
before the Mt. SAC Invitational,

coming up next weekend.
"It is just another opportunity
to compete and qualify for the Pac
-10 championships," added Truitt.
After a swift period of rebuild
ing, the Stanford squad is now
seen as a talented contender in the
eyes of many coaches, including
Eftes
"This year, Stanford has a very
strong track program," he said.
"They should be up there and
fighting with the big boys of UCLA
and USC this weekend. It will be a
good showing before the Pac-10
finals."
While Stanford appears to be on
the brink of breaking into "the big
leagues," Lananna looks forward
to smaller meets like the Fresno
Invite as a chance to hone the
team.
"The good thing about these
meets before the big and heavy
invitationals is that it gives our
athletes an excellent opportunity
to build team unity and morale,
which they have successfully and
constantly been doing this sea
son," Lananna said.
Despite sweeping top honors
last week, the Cardinal has not
been taking it easy this week. The
entire team is hoping to carry their
new-found confidence throughout
the remainder of the season and
eventually to the Pacific 10 Con
ference championships, held May
20 and 21 at Washington State in
Pullman, Wash.
