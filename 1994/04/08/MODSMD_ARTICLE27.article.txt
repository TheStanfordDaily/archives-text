# Volleyball looks to drown Waves
## Burnham finale for seniors Ceman, Burghardt 
### Kathryn Yang Staff writer 
For the first time this season,
the Stanford volleyball squad has
broken into the AVCA/Tachikara
Coaches Poll's top-three rank
ings. In order to preserve that
position, however, the No. 3 Car
dinal will have to overpower visi
tors Pepperdine and Long Beach
State over the weekend.
Going head-to-head with Pep
perdine (11-6 overall, 9-6 in the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion) for the first time this sea
spn, the Cardinal (13-8, 10-4) will
try to tame the Waves on Friday
with redshirt freshman opposite
hitter Matt Fuerbringer shoul
dering the offensive load.
Tallying a career-high 51 kills
against Hawaii last week, Fuer
bringer has already established
himself as one of the nation's pre
miere spikers in only his first col
legiate season. On the year, the
freshman leads Stanford with
574 kills — fourth-best in Cardi
nal volleyball history. Nation
wide, Fuerbringer also rises
above all competitors with a 7.45
kills-per-game average.
In reference to Fuerbringer's
tremendous one-match total in
Hawaii, head coach Ruben Nieves
said, "Very few people ever get
more than 50 kills a match, and
even some of the best hitters in
the nation have never accom
plished that. Matt's performance
is an indication of just how good
he is."
Right behind Fuerbringer,

however, is another future All-
American candidate playing his
first full season of collegiate vol
leyball. Sophomore swing hitter
Mike Lambert has picked up
where departed seniors Bob Hill
man and Ryan Moos left off last
year. Combining a powerful
offensive attack with the best
passing and blocking skills on
the team, Lambert is the best all
around player on the Cardinal
court, according to Nieves.

All this would not be possible
without the quarterbacking
skills of senior setter Canyon
Ceman. Ceman, last year's
National Player of the Year, has
fought off both injuries and a
slow start to pace the Cardinal on
another championship run this
season. Orchestrating a master
piece against first-place USC last
week, Ceman directed the court
with 94 sets and propelled the
Cardinal past USC in both the
standings and the national rank
ings.
No. 8 Pepperdine will
undoubtedly have its hands full
Friday, despite coming to Burn
ham Pavilion on the heels of a
two-match winning streak.
After the Waves roll out of
Stanford, the 49ers will invade
Burnham on Saturday night hop
ing to avenge a 15-9, 9-15, 15-9,
15-11 loss to the Cardinal earlier
this season.
In that match, Long Beach
State (12-12, 6-9) wilted under
the pressures of both Lambert

Matt Fuerbringer slams a spike past USC earlier this year. Fuer
bringer has continued his torrid hitting pace, leading the nation in
kills.
