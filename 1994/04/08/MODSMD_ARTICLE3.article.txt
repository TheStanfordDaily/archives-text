Campus couch potatoes rejoice.
Cable is coming to your room.
The University recently formed
the Stanford Cable Television Pro
ject, or STV, which aims to bring
cable services to all student and
faculty residences by the 1996-97
academic year. Coordinators for
the project held two sessions
Wednesday evening to gather stu

The University has chosen to be

residences will provide free access
to about 30 channels including
SUNet video — which offers the
Stanford Library Channel and
Stanford Instructional Television

work channels (ABC, CBS, NBC
and Fox) and PBS.
For approximately $20 per
month, students will be able to get
30 additional channels such as
CNN, Discovery, the Learning
Channel and Mind Extension Uni

and Cinemax will be available for
about $10 each.
STV will cost less than cable
services provided by other local
companies. The Cable Co-op's
