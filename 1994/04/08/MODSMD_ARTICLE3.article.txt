# Cable TV will be in place by 1996

Campus couch potatoes rejoice.
Cable is coming to your room.
The University recently formed
the Stanford Cable Television Pro
ject, or STV, which aims to bring
cable services to all student and
faculty residences by the 1996-97
academic year. Coordinators for
the project held two sessions
Wednesday evening to gather stu
dent input from undergraduates
and graduate resident assistants.
The University has chosen to be
master of its video future by not
signing on with the local cable
provider, Cable Co-op, whom it
has been negotiating with for a
decade on University cable service.
"The advantage of providing
our own cable services is that we
can select the programming," said
Anne Crowley, manager of client
services with the University's
Communications Services.
The next step, organizers said,
is to ask the community what
channels it wants. Surveys will be
distributed to students through
their RAs over the next two weeks.
Maureen Trimm, assistant di
rector for Communication Ser
vices, said STV will offer three lev
els of programming. Cable jacks in
residences will provide free access
to about 30 channels including
SUNet video — which offers the
Stanford Library Channel and
Stanford Instructional Television
Network (SITN) — and basic net
work channels (ABC, CBS, NBC
and Fox) and PBS.
For approximately $20 per
month, students will be able to get
30 additional channels such as
CNN, Discovery, the Learning
Channel and Mind Extension Uni
versity. For total video-heads, pre
mium movie channels like HBO
and Cinemax will be available for
about $10 each.
STV will cost less than cable
services provided by other local
companies. The Cable Co-op's
basic package, including network
channels plus ESPN, CNN,
MTV, Nickelodeon, and others,
costs $28. South Bay Cable Vision
offers a basic package for $11,
and a standard package that
includes CNN and MTV for an
additional $10. Students will pay
for the service in each living area
or suite — not for each cable jack.
Lounges and computer clusters
will only provide the free-access
channels.
Graduate students at the
Wednesday meeting voiced con
cern that lounges were an
important place for people to
watch movies together.
"We're open to student feed
back and input," said Trimm,
adding that the fine tuning of
the project will depend on feed
back.
Another concern raised at one
of the meetings was how much of
a market for cable really exists on
campus. Organizers did not have
figures on how many residents
have televisions in their rooms.
