# Students remember Holocaust

Holocaust Remembrance Day did not slip by unno
ticed at Stanford, as both a memorial service and a
candlelight vigil were held yesterday evening to
remind the community of past atrocities.
The ceremonies coincided with Yom Hashoah, the
Jewish day of remembrance of Holocaust victims.
Yom Hashoah is commemorated annually about one
week before the Israeli day of independence, which
marks the formation of Israel in 1948.
"We need to remember every year, so that we don't
forget," said sophomore Joe Bialowitz, who, along
with Hillel program director Rebecca Schwartz, over
saw coordination of the service.
About 50 people were present at both the memori
al service at Hillel and the vigil which followed in
White Plaza. The candlelight vigil was the first ever at
Stanford for Yom Hashoah.
The service strove not only to raise awareness
about the deaths of six million Jews, but also to
remind people how East European Jews lived in the
19305, before the Holocaust began.
Excerpts from Holocaust literature were read at
both the service and the vigil. One read at the service
summed up its message, "May we recall not only the
terror of their deaths, but the splendor of so many of
their lives."
"To focus solely on how a person died and not on
how he lived is to do a severe injustice to the sanctity

of that person's life," said Bialowitz.
To emphasize this point, "The Life That Disap
peared," a collection of photos taken by Roman Vish
niac in 1930s Poland, was shown in a slide show. "I
wanted to save the faces. They were all killed — all,"
Vishniac narrated.
People at both the service and the vigil called atten
tion to how the Holocaust related to today's situation
in Bosnia. "It's important that we remember today
the atrocities — they are being continued all over the
world," said one student at the vigil.
In addition, this year's program was more inclu
sive than in the past. "Last year several people felt
that the Holocaust vigil was insufficient, that it was
addressing just the Jews' suffering," said sophomore
Derek Isaacowitz.
As a result, yesterday's candlelight vigil was co
sponsored by the Jewish Student Association; the
Bisexual, Gay, and Lesbian Alliance; and the Disabili
ty Resource Center.
Some who were in attendance had relatives who
had been directly affected by Holocaust proceedings.
These people felt that their experiences were concrete
testimony against the recent trend of Holocaust 'revi
sionism.'
Bialowitz's father, for example, escaped from Sobi
bor, an extermination camp. "Observations like Ithe
service! instill in people a sense of loss that might help
them combat what the revisionists are trying to make
people believe," Bialowitz said.
