# Fab Four to provide new tune

### Hurt Herman Editorial staff 
John Lennon is dead, but the Fab Four
slate for Senior Class President hopes to
bring its brand of politics to Stanford from
a nearer shore.
All the members of the slate have had
previous experience working in the ASSU,
according to slate member Eric Chen.
The Fab Four sees its primary function
as creating "an environment that fosters
unity among the senior class," said Sarah-
Marie Martin, another member of the slate.
The group hopes to sponsor a greater va
riety of class activities to this end, with less
of an emphasis on alcohol, Martin said.
Some of the slate's ideas include a senior

day at Great America, a ski trip, and a tail
gate party to he held at one of the football
games in the fall.
Chen also said that the possibility of
gaining preferential seating at football
games for seniors has been discussed.
The slate also hopes to liven up the nor
mally morose week between finals and
graduation. One activity that the Fab Four
hopes to sponsor is a "Dis-orientation,"
similar to MuFuUnSun, which is held for
freshmen in the fall.
"We want to have square dancing
again," Martin said.
Slate member Paula Strange Dybdahl
said that Fab Four has talked to the cur-
rent senior class presidents as
well as the Stanford Alumni Net
work about their plans including
possible funding for activities.
Fab Four member Kevin Har
rington hopes to use the senior
class leverage to gain corporate
cooperation to sponsor free
events.
"We bring a lot of people to
these [activities]," Harrington
said.
In order to communicate
better with seniors, the slate
discussed starting an e-mail
list that would distribute
weekly updates to seniors on
activities.
The group also hopes to gain
more input into the graduation
speaker selection process, in
light of the controversy over the
process that has arisen in recent
years.

Chen said the group has dis
cussed giving the administration
a list of only five speakers to
choose from, as opposed to the

current policy of submitting a
list of 20 to University President
Gerhard Casper's office.
The Fab Four would also like
to bring some kind of musical act

to the graduation ceremony.
Slate members maintain that
their candidacy is a serious one.
"We've thought about this for a
long time," Dybdahl said.
