# Computer voting may delay results
## Paper-ballot option could mean half-week wait for final tallies 
### Beth Berselli Staff writer 
Next week's ASSU elections
will feature a new electronic-mail
voting system that can tally
10,000 votes in 45 seconds. But
some students without access to
the system could choose to vote by
paper ballot, possibly delaying
election results by days.
Elections Commissioner Tom
Tsao said he is expecting about
300 graduate students to vote by
paper ballot because they do not
have accounts on the Leland sys
tem, which are necessary in order
to use the new system. If 300 stu
dents vote by paper ballot, the
election results could be delayed
by several days, Tsao said.
"The crux of the matter is that
instead of 20 minutes at the most

it may take half a week to calcu
late the election results," Asst.
Election Commissioner Jonathan
Berent said. "It seems unfortu
nate to me that some students are
requesting paper ballots."
According to graduate senator
Steve Abbott, many students in
the schools of Law, Business and
Medicine don't have Leland ac
counts because these schools use
alternate systems.
As a result, Abbott fears that
many graduate students will be
discouraged from going to the
polls.
"The system basically ignores
an entire section of graduate stu
dents. Fifteen hundred to 2,000
students are being disenfran
chised," he said. "In a way it biases
the election against graduate pro
fessional students .... It will neg
atively impact graduate student
voting."
In order to meet the needs of
students lacking Leland
accounts, a pollsite for paper
voting will be set up at the
Graduate School of Business on
April 13 for about two hours,
Tsao said. Also, paper ballots
will be available at the ASSU
office, on the second floor of
Tresidder Union, on April 13
and 14 from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Students are required to have
two forms of identification — a
picture ID and a Stanford Uni
versity ID — in order to vote by
paper ballot.
The new UNIX, on-line vot
ing system is replacing the com
puterized pollsite voting of pre
vious years. Students with
Leland accounts will be able to
vote from any computer that is
connected to the Stanford Uni
versity Network (SUNet).

Berent said the goal of the
new system is "to make elections
cheaper and more accessible to
all students." About $5,000 will
be saved each year because poll
watchers won't have to be hired
to monitor pollsite voting, he
said.
Tsao said he hopes most stu
dents will open a Leland account
in order to vote because it will
save time and money, as well as
insure ballot security.
"It only takes 24 hours to get
a Leland account," Berent said.
"It should not be a hindrance at
all." He added that the process
for opening an account has been
well-advertised.
The movement for an on-line
voting system began last spring
when the senate passed a bill
calling for the development of
such a system. Tsao said no
Business School senators were
present at that time and there
fore weren't able to give any
input.
Graduate students Enda Hu
and Steve Friedland wrote the
voting program last summer. Hu
said the program can "only run
on one system for the sake of

voter consistency."
For example, if a student in
the Business School has
accounts on both the Leland sys
tem and the Business School
system then that student could
conceivably vote twice.
Hu said he and Friedland
choose the Leland system
because a majority of students
use it. "We had to pick the most
widely-used network," he said,
adding that numerous tests have
been run on the program and he
is confident that the program
will run smoothly.
Abbott said he plans to sub
mit a bill to the senate in the
next few weeks that will prevent
the looming complications in
election returns from happening
again next year. The bill will
"make sure that the program
includes all the major electronic
mail systems on campus,"
Abbott said.
"The main reason I'm upset
about this is because we didn't
find out about it until this week.
There should have been better
communication between the
ASSU bureaucracy and the stu
dents," he said.
