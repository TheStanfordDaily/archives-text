# Screening spotlights documentary films

Subjects from tornado chasers
to the plight of two juveniles living
on the streets in Mexico will be
profiled tonight in six documen
tary films that are the work of
graduate students in a two-year
Documentary Film and Video
Production program at Stanford.
"The program is unique in that
it is the only [Master of Arts] pro
gram in film and video production
in the country with an exclusive
focus on documentary films," said
Jan Krawitz, a professor within
the program. The program, run
through the Department of Com
munication, has been at Stanford
for over 25 years.
The department selects a
dozen students annually from a
diverse pool of about 70 appli
cants. The students "are typically
mature people who have had some
serious work experience since

completing their undergraduate
degrees," said Krawitz.
Documentary film students
take classes and workshops the
first year of the program, choos
ing from such subjects as the his
tory and theory of documentary
film, communications theory and
research methods.
During the second year, stu
dents become heavily involved in a
full-year M.A. Project Production
Seminar, in which they devote
time, money and energy to creat
ing their own original documen
tary film.
"The making of the films can
cost anywhere from $3,000 to
$25,000, and can take anywhere
from a year to five years to com
plete," said Ken Jacobson, a re
cent graduate of the program,
whose film, "The Lottery," traces
the history of the draft lottery sys
tem in the United States. Jacob
son said students earn the
money themselves, generally
through fundraising activities.
The documentary films, called
diploma projects, are completed
movies that have gone through
the filming, editing and produc
tion process, Jacobson said.
The student submits a pro
posal for the film, based on pre
liminary research, to the faculty
for approval. Once approved, the
student works closely with a fac
ulty advisor to create the docu
mentary.
After the film is taped, the
student shows it to both faculty
and students in a colloquium for
feedback, then edits it until satis
fied with the final outcome.
Though Jacobson admits that
the program is "really inten
sive," he said that he believes it
was "very thorough. I really
learned about everything in doc
umentary films, from editing to
producing."
Magnaye said he believes that
the program opens avenues in
the documentary film industry.

"There is definitely life after the
documentary film program. Cor
porate videos, MTV, Hollywood,
advertising, anything," added
Magnaye.
The six films being shown
tonight will explore a wide vari
ety of topics, and many have
already hit the film festival cir
cuit. For example, Magnaye will
be showing a 27-minute film
entitled "White Christmas," an
exploration — based on his own
experiences — of the influence of
Spanish and American colonial
ism on a child's perceptions of
Christmas in the Philippines.
Graduate Michael Magnaye's
film has won the Special Jury
Prize at the Golden Gate Film
Awards, and will be showing at
the San Francisco International
Film Festival during the first
week of May.
Joel Harris, another gradu
ate, has produced an eight
minute movie called "Weight
less" about the "grace and beau
ty of freediving" — scuba diving
without any equipment — which
is filmed entirely underwater in
Northern California.
The showing will begin at 8
p.m. in Cubberley Auditorium.
The screening is free.
