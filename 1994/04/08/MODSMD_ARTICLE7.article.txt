Subjects from tornado chasers
to the plight of two juveniles living
on the streets in Mexico will be
profiled tonight in six documen
tary films that are the work of
graduate students in a two-year
Documentary Film and Video
Production program at Stanford.
"The program is unique in that
it is the only [Master of Arts] pro
gram in film and video production
in the country with an exclusive
focus on documentary films," said
Jan Krawitz, a professor within
the program. The program, run
through the Department of Com
munication, has been at Stanford
for over 25 years.
The department selects a
dozen students annually from a
diverse pool of about 70 appli
cants. The students "are typically
mature people who have had some
serious work experience since

completing their undergraduate
degrees," said Krawitz.
Documentary film students
take classes and workshops the
first year of the program, choos
ing from such subjects as the his
tory and theory of documentary
film, communications theory and
research methods.
During the second year, stu
dents become heavily involved in a
full-year M.A. Project Production
Seminar, in which they devote
time, money and energy to creat
ing their own original documen
tary film.
"The making of the films can
cost anywhere from $3,000 to
$25,000, and can take anywhere
from a year to five years to com
plete," said Ken Jacobson, a re
cent graduate of the program,
whose film, "The Lottery," traces
the history of the draft lottery sys
tem in the United States. Jacob
