# 'No crap' for the Bottom Line
## 
### Burt Herman Editorial staff 
In a move consistent with the trend of
'people polities' that swept the 1992 presi
dential elections, the Bottom Line slate for
Senior Class President is taking an uncon
ventional campaign route.
The slate is not making the typical cam
paign promises of student activities that
normally accompany the ASSU campaigns.
"We don't want to make promises right
now that we know can't be kept," said slate
member Nik Kolodny, one of four human
biology majors on Bottom Line. "We want
to be realistic."
Members of Bottom Line clearly bring
an outsider's perspective to campus poli

tics. None of the members of the slate have
had previous experience in ASSU govern
ment.
The group said that their name was
symbolic of the theme of their campaign.
"No crap, no frills, just the bottom line,"
said slate member Reena Gulati.
Kolodny emphasized the slate's hope to
move toward a simpler role in campus poli
tics.
"We want to bring student government
back to the ideals they were supposed to
be," said Alexa Constantinides.
"We don't want to stand up here and say
this is what we want," the slate's final
member Alisa Kamigaki said, adding that
"interaction and accessibility"
would be Bottom Line's rallying
cry.
Because the senior class is the
only undergraduate class with
officers, Bottom Line hopes to
expand its role into student advo
cacy as well, Kolodny said,
The group also expressed its
desire to foster a greater sense of
class unity "by making people think
more of their class than T-shirts
and keychains," Kolodny said.
By raising the spirit of class
unity, members of Bottom Line
believe that contributions to the
Senior Gift will also increase.
"By the time they graduate, we
hope that people will understand
why they need to give," Kolodny
said.
Members of the slate realize
that voters might be hesitant to
vote for candidates who fail to
propose concrete ideas as to what
they might accomplish.
"We're asking people to trust
in our ability," Kolodny said.

The group is hoping to get stu
dent input on alternative activi
ties that the senior class can par
ticipate in, but also hopes to make
the position into "more than a

glorified social chair," Constan
tinides said.
"We're really enthusiastic to
see what people have to say,"
Kamigaki said.
