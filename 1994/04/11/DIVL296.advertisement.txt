We at the Transport Group know how people will react when you tell
them you're thinking of interviewing with an insurance company. Heck,
we've been hearing those responses for years. At parties you can kill a con
versation with the mention of your profession. At home, your family will ins
ist that insurers are evil. Even the industry's highest profile leaders won't
deny it's an unattractive career.
That is why we believe Transport's success is based on our ability to
attract customers who see us as more than just an insurer. Auto insurance is
one of their largest expenditures every year, but the average buyer knows
nothing about it. We want to reward our end-customer for depending on
Transport to handle their accidents. When insurers rank in popularity right
down there with lawyers, the government and used car dealers, pleasing
your customers is a tough assignment. We're confident that our intelligent,
ambitious, aggressive, hard-working and hard-playing employees will help
Transport ace this assignment.
So don't think of interviewing with Transport as interviewing with an
insurer. Think of it as interviewing with a leader ... a company that just might
stop your friends from saying
"Insurance? Were You Desperate?"
I Bids for Interviews with Transport Group and at the CPPC at 8:00 AM Tomorrow, April 12,1994.
