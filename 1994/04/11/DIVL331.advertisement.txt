Summer Opportunities
TRILOGY
Trilogy's SaIesBUILDER ™ software has the power to fundamentally change the way
Corporate America buys and sells products. Already, SaIesBUILDER ™ is supporting the
sales forces and large customers of AT&T, General Electric, and IBM. As Trilogy rapidly
expands into new industries, we need to effectively demonstrate the value of
SaIesBUILDER ™ to new clients. This is where you come in.
Trilogy is offering you the opportunity this summer to build an industry-specific
demonstration model that will dramatically change the way products are bought and sold.
As The Wall Street Journal writes, "SaIesBUILDER™ promises to be one of those rare
programs that changes the way business is done." This is your chance to get in on the action.
"Ok, this sounds great. But, what will I do?"
• Gain a powerful foundation in your industry and its products.
• Master Visual Basic (a GUI tool for Windows) and SaIesBUILDER ™(object oriented
modeling software).
• Build a solution for automating the sales of products in your specific industry.
• Create a marketing plan to exploit your industry solution.
The expected value of the solution pack would be at least $5 million over the next 12 months.
"Alright, so who do you expect me to be?"
• You are a CS, Symbolic Systems, or IE major.
• You've dabbled in commercial software development with visual programming
tools (Visual Basic, Powerßuilder, Supercard, etc.), databases, excel macros, expert
systems, and modeling tools.
• You exude strong initiative and a "make it happen" attitude.
• You possess the ability to thrive in a fast-paced and intense environment.
If you been looking for a summer opportunity
to make your mark, you've found it.
