Mexican assassins arraigned
MEXICO CITY (AP) â€” Two security
officers were arraigned yesterday on
charges of helping to kill Mexico's top
presidential contender, but the man who
hired them to help guard the candidate
was set free.
The decision was announced by spe
cial prosecutor Miguel Montes Garcia in
a statement that raised new questions
about whether progress was being made
in prosecuting the March 23 killing of
Luis Donaldo Colosio in Tijuana.
The case is Mexico's biggest political
assassination since 1928.
Vicente Mayoral Valenzuela and his
son Rodolfo Mayoral Esquer were

charged with being co-participants in
homicide, accused of assisting another
person to commit the crime.
Authorities accuse the two, who were
hired for crowd control, of helping the
confessed gunman, 23 year-old factory
worker Mario Aburto Martinez,
approach Colosio to shoot him.
But the statement announced that
Jose Rodolfo Rivapalacio Tinajero, who
organized the local security detail, was
being freed for lack of evidence.
The prosecutor's statement also sig
naled moves to quash rampant public
speculation of a wider conspiracy,
announcing that charges of "criminal
association" involving the four still under
arrest in the case were being dropped.
