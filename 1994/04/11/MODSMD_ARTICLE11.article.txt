SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP)
â€” Two U.S. F-16 fighter jets bombed Serb
targets near the besieged Muslim enclave
of Gorazde yesterday after Bosnian Serb
forces overran government defenses
to reach the outskirts of the town.
It was the first NATO attack on
ground positions in its 44-year history.
In February, NATO jets downed four
Serb planes violating a "no fly zone"
over Bosnia.
Bosnia has been convulsed by civil
war since seceding from Yugoslavia two
years ago.
NATO headquarters in Naples, Italy,
identified the planes as U.S. F-16Cs
based in Aviano, Italy, and said the
attack was requested by U.N. peace

keepers in Gorazde.
"We said we would act if we were
requested to do so," President Clinton
told reporters in Washington. "We have
now done so and will do so again if we
are requested."
"I very much hope that now the
attacks will cease, that the Serbs will go
back, that the talks will resume," he said.
Maj. Dacre Holloway, a U.N. military
spokesman in Sarajevo, said the planes
struck the Gorazde "pocket" yesterday
evening. He did not say what was hit.
NATO also did not specify the target and
said the extent of the damage was being
assessed.
Bosnian Serbs accused NATO of hit
ting civilian targets.

"With this action NATO has commit
ted open aggression against the Serb peo
ple, by attacking civilian targets far from
the front," said a statement from the
command of the Herzegovina Corps,
which has been besieging Gorazde.
A U.N. source in Belgrade, speaking
on condition of anonymity, said Bosnian
Serbs responded to the attack with anti
aircraft fire.
A U.S. Defense Department source in
Washington, also speaking on condition
of anonymity, said three to five bombs
were dropped. The attack appeared to be
over but "it depends on how the Serbs
react," the source said. "If the United
Nations military observers are still in
trouble, then it's not over."
