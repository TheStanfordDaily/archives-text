## Shake-up for senate 
### 
Redistricting undergrad
senate elections will lead
to better representation

The problem: Lack of ASSU
Senate accountability. A
remedy: Constitutional
Amendment/Senate Bill XXIV-
A&R-20.
As many would agree, the sen
ate has a large accountability
problem. Senators don't have
defined constituencies and con
sequently, students don't know
who "their" senators are.
When accountability doesn't
exist, voters' needs are neither
noticed nor addressed. The popu
lace begins questioning the utili
ty of a government and, in turn,
the stature of the government is
undermined.
Students can help stop this
vicious cycle by approving this
amendment, which would give all
senators the right to vote and
district the undergraduate sen
ate into six geographical districts
and four class districts. The plan
would also move senate elections
from the spring to the fall.
The most important point of
the proposal is the division of the
undergraduate senate by resi
dences and by class. Therefore, a
junior living in Toyon would
have a representative from the
Toyon area as well as a junior
class representative. This
increased interaction would
allow students to get to know
their representatives better.
Moving senate elections to the
fall would also have benefits.
Freshmen and one-year master's
students would have a chance to
elect representatives — instead
of being represented by people
who were voted into office before
they even decided to attend Stan
ford.
While it is a hectic time of the
year, giving these people true
representatives is worth adding
one more event to the autumn
quarter calendar. And now that
balloting is done via the comput
er network, the added cost is
minimal and well worth the

potential increases in account
ability.
Moreover, by holding elections
in the first half of fall quarter,
less time would be devoted to
campaigning, giving the senate
more time to do productive
work.
Because most representatives
would be dorm-based, prospec
tive senators would not have to
plaster the entire campus with
fliers.
Instead, candidates would
hold area meetings within their
district and voters could choose
people on their merits, rather
than electing someone just
because his name rhymes with
"vote."
Finally, by giving all elected
senators a vote, senators' partic
ipation would be increased.
What is the current incentive
for "alternate" senators to show
up to meetings, knowing that
they have a slim chance of vot
ing?
What is the current incentive
for alternates to initiate legisla
tion in the senate?
There is none. Giving every
one a vote is the minimum
incentive any elected person
deserves.
Critics charge the measure has
"no provisions" to ensure
accountability. But accountabili
ty cannot be written in to any
amendment — it starts with the
constituents. This amendment,
by providing constituents obvi
ous representatives, is a huge
step toward increasing account
ability.
Critics also charge that dis
tricting will balkanize the cam
pus. But all-campus interests
can be represented by the class
representatives and the Council
of Presidents.
Area senators are also free to
take up causes that cut across
geographical and class lines. Dis
tricting can hardly make sena
tors any more inaccessible than
they already are.
If students — and undergrad
uates in particular — want to
revitalize the ASSU and make it
more accountable and credible,
they can start by voting "yes" on
this amendment.
