# Senators' sweatshirts

Senator uniforms offer
much-needed visibility
and publicity for senate

Given the current sorry state
of affairs, anything that
improves the accountability
and visibility of ASSU senators is a
wise move. Constitutional Amend
ment/Senate Bill XXIV-CAS,
which would force senators to
wear a "uniform" on the days of
senate meetings, is a step in the
right direction.
The uniform would consist of

"an oatmeal color" sweatshirt with
cardinal red lettering which would
read: "What is an ASSU Senator?"
(on the front) and "I'm an ASSU
Senator, silly!" (on the back). The
shirt would also advertise the loca
tion and time of the meetings. Sen
ators who don't wear the uniform
on meeting days would not be
allowed to vote.
This plan would cost the ASSU
little, would help students identify
their representatives and would
inform them of meeting times and
locations. At the same time, it
would add a little levity to the
whole ASSU.
What more could one ask for,
except maybe a beanie?
