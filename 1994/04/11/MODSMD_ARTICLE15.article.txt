## On burglars and bicycles 
### 
I WANT TO ride my bicycle. Have you
ever had your bike stolen? If you
answered yes, then chances are the
theft was perpetrated here at Stanford
and not at home. I say that because this
campus, per capita, leads the league in
Nobel prizes, national championships
and bike thefts.
Well, maybe not, but the number has
to be really close to the top. Doesn't that
"Approaching Stanford" deal say that we
average two stolen bikes per person, per
Stanford career? Ricky Henderson would
die for numbers like that.
I am among the masses who have
gone through three bikes. I've known
one person who is on her fourth bike, but
rare is the person who can make it
through four years without losing his
bike at all. They should give you an
award at graduation if you make it
through: The Golden Locks? The Silver
Spokes? The Handled Bars?
I have fallen prey in the two worst
ways. My first bike was stolen over
Christmas break my freshman year. My
second was pilfered when I left it
unlocked outside Green Library in plain
daylight. Those are two of the biggest
bonehead maneuvers you could possibly
pull off. I'm proud of it, too.
Actually I've had bikes stolen four
times — I recovered one of them later.
There is no greater sense of vindication
than seeing someone else on your
machine and saying, "Excuse me, where
did you get that bike?" Unfortunately for

me, I could not experience the jubilation
because an old dormmate was riding it
when I found him. We laughed it off. It
was actually pretty funny. He didn't steal
it. Or so he says . . .
Having a bike on this campus is actu
ally a tremendous responsibility. I think
a cycling test and safety course should be
a part of Orientation, despite its lack of
intellectual or cultural stimulation.
Although cycling is normally a simple
task, somehow we geniuses "forget how
to ride" — and that isn't supposed to hap
pen, right?
We are also supposed endure no fewer
that two bicycle accidents every four
years. How is it then that I have managed
to avoid scraping my face on the cheese
grater that is the cobblestone of the
Quad? Not because three of my bikes
were stolen — although that's why I
haven't done it lately — but because I
am the only rider who watches where he
is going!
If everyone else is a worse driver than
you are, then everyone else is a worse
rider, too. I think those of us with a bike
have the motor skills to successfully
navigate our way around the campus.
But we don't concentrate on what's in
front us enough in order to avoid catas
trophe.
We're too busy solving fourth-dimen
sion equations in our head or trying to
figure out, up to the last penny, how
much the refund check is going to be.
Then all of a sudden, the bollard becomes

such an intimate friend, it has to meet
the parents.
The grad students do it right, though.
The law states, and I quote, "No graduate
student on God's green earth shall ride a
bicycle without the proper equipment:
helmet, reflector vest, and bike light.
Oops. Did we mention a helmet?" You've
got to hand it to them, though. Most
times "they're excellent riders, they're
excellent riders," as Dustin Hoffman
would say.
But you can only experience all this
excitement if you have your own bike. If
you don't, whether it was stolen or not,
here's what I recommend:
• Do the Michael Douglas thing and
take the law in your own hands — steal a
bike back. The cops can't (and won't) do
enough, so find an unlocked bike and
return it to where you found it when
you're done. It works for me.
• Ride carefully. It's not everyday a
Sigma Chi pledge can direct traffic by the
Clock Tower, so do your part, please.
• Above all, remember to put a helmet
on that soldier! It's like he's going into
battle.
