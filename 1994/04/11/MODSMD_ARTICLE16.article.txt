# Splitting special fee

Separate special-fee tally
for all grads, undergrads
is unfair and ineffective

It's widely held that the current
special-fee system often
"taxes" graduate students for
projects, programs and activities
that are mainly geared toward
undergraduates. However, Consti
tutional Amendment/Senate Bill
XXII-A&R-8 is not the proper way
to remedy the inequities in the
current system.
If this amendment passes, spe
cial fees will be approved separate
ly by undergraduates and gradu
ate students. If both groups
approve a fee, they will both fund
it; if one group approves a fee and
the other one doesn't, the approv
ing group will shoulder the entire
funding burden.
While that general premise may
have some merit, the major flaws
with this proposal lie in its details.
The biggest problem is the
amendment does not require a
minimum percentage of under
graduates and graduates to vote.
Rather, it simply mandates that 15
percent of the ASSU's members —
that is, 15 percent of all students
— must vote.
Under these guidelines, if 15
percent of all students voted in an
election, but only one was a gradu
ate student and he or she voted
against every special fee, under
graduates would immediately
shoulder the entire fee for all

groups they approved. All gradu
ate students would pay nothing.
If the current system is less than
democratic, the system that would
be implemented if this amendment
passes would be downright unjust.
With no minimum voting percent
age required, this amendment could
make it possible for a handful of dis
enchanted graduate students to
double undergraduates' fees
overnight.
Is such a scenario any more fair
than what exists now? The answer
is a resounding no. If the special
fee system is to be revamped, it
must be done right. Such an effort
should undoubtedly entail a full
fledged review of the entire fee
refund system and the fee
approval process in addition to the
division of fees between under
graduates and graduate students.
This half-baked amendment
fails to establish an equitable spe
cial-fee system. It would affect the
results of this week's special-fee
votes, yet the authors of the plan
have failed to anticipate any of its
crippling consequences, such as
greatly inflated undergraduate
fees and skyrocketing refund
requests.
In short, this amendment is not
the panacea its authors make it out
to be. The special-fee system needs
to be overhauled, but two wrongs
don't make a right. All students
should vote "no" on this amend
ment and demand that the new
ASSU Senate undertake a thorough
reconstruction of the special-fee
system that is fair to all — under
graduates and graduate students
alike.
