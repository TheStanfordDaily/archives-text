# Campus women leaders convene

Student and faculty leaders gathered at the second
Stanford Conference of Women and Leadership Satur
day to discuss issues ranging from women's leadership
styles to gender dynamics in the classroom.
The event, which featured workshops and presen
tations by prominent Stanford women, was attended
by 30 female students who hold leadership positions on
campus. The all-day conference was sponsored by the
Women's Leadership Coalition, founded this fall by
senior Liz Gorgue and juniors Louise Chang, Denise
Chan and Shana Yansen.
Provost Condoleezza Rice, the keynote speaker, and
Neurosurgery Prof. Frances Conley spoke about per
sonal leadership and the obstacles of working in a male
dominated field.
"Leaders are made, not born," said Rice, at her
speech's opening. Society sometimes views women as less
capable leaders than their male counterparts "because
their early experiences may or may not re-enforce the
styles that we associate with leadership," she said.
Rice, who grew up in "Jim Crow Alabama," pointed
to her overcoming of both racial and gender discrimi
nation to obtain leadership roles as an example of suc
cess through practice and experience.
Rice said characteristics which she attributes to
leaders include confidence, decisiveness and teamwork.
When a student asked Rice about role models and
how the recent firing of Assoc. Vice Provost for Student
Affairs Cecilia Burciaga might negatively affect women
who looked up to her, Rice replied that role models can
be of any gender and race, and that women can look for
inspiration in other figures including themselves.

Conley spoke at the conference because "three years
ago I challenged the administration at the Stanford
School of Medicine. 1 was asked to accept a chair for my
department of neurosurgery whose behavior over the
past 25 years has been a true embarrassment. I had
that choice to accept him or quit. And 1 chose to quit,"
she said. After media attention forced the Medical
School to make overtures to alleviate the situation, she
rejoined the faculty.
The experience taught her not to be afraid of con
flict, whereas many women try to avoid it, she said.
"The mindset that women are fair game is part of
our culture Tradition and stereotypic thinking
have a lot to do with the maintenance of that as part of
the status quo that we all accept," she said.
In her speech, she discussed inequality of both mar
ital arrangements and workplace wages. A woman
receives 70 cents for a man's dollar merely because she
is a woman, Conley said.
Although women comprise half the population, they
have not united politically over issues such as abortion
because they are too disjointed, according to Conley.
Yet she ended her speech on an optimistic note.
"The women's movement has moved and that which
has happened is not about ready to unhappen," Conley
said.
Other speakers at the conference included Fran Gib
son, public health education consultant, Assoc. Dean of
Memorial Church Diana Akiyama, and Rinku Sen,
executive director of the Center for Third World Orga
nizing.
The conference intended to "get women leaders who
are involved in different organizations on campus to
meet each other and talk about issues all women face,"
said Gorgue.
