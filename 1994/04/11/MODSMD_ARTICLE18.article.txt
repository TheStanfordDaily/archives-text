## Cardinal spikers overpower MPSF foes Ceman leads 'dangerous' Stanford 
### Kathryn Yang Staff writer 
Canyon Ceman hits the Burn
ham Pavilion parquet for yet
another point-saving dig. Mike
Lambert then (lies off the court
and takes a tumble into the
announcers' booth to put the ball
back in play. Finally, Joe
Burghardt draws a bead on his tar
get and pounds it across the net for
another kill. End of rally — point
Stanford.
"At the beginning of the season,
the only team making those superb
plays was (No. 1) UCLA," said
Stanford coach Ruben Nieves.
"Anytime you get a dig like that
and turn it into a swing it's a great
conversion. It's plays like that sep
arate the good teams from the
great teams, and the boys from the
men."
Over the weekend, the Cardinal
team made that leap from young
and talented to young, talented
and dangerous with blowout victo
ries against No. 8 Pepperdine (11-7
overall, 9-7 in the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) on Friday and
No. 13 Long Beach State (13-13, 7-
10) the next day.
In what might have been its eas
iest "W" of the season, the No. 3-
ranked Stanford spikers (15-8, 12-
4) limited the 49ers of Long Beach
to just 14 points the entire match
by dominating the scorecard dur
ing the 15-5, 15-3, 15-6 no-contest.
"They served well, they hit well,
they did everything well," said 49er

head coach Ray Ratelle. "Those
guys have a ton of talent, and it
wasn't much of a game."
Middle blocker Michael Hoefer
was just one source of Ratelle's
headache on Saturday as the fresh
man pounded out 10 kills for a .615
hitting percentage, in addition to
leading all defenders with eight
digs and five blocks. Hoefer was
also instrumental in closing out the
first game with a kill off Ceman's
quick set for point 14 and a solid
ace for the game point.
Leading the Cardinal attack,
however, was sophomore opposite
hitter Matt Fuerbringer, who
rebounded from a sub-par game on
Friday to punish the 49ers with a
game-high 17 kills and an astro
nomical .714 average.
"We had them reeling right
from the beginning," Nieves said.
"We served them strategically, and
we served them tough and aggres
sively. That gave us an edge, and
we were able to score with every
one."
The second frame was not much
better for the visiting 49ers. Afler
the Cardinal jumped to an easy 10-
3 lead, Long Beach State fell apart
and coughed up the last two points
of the match on passing and hitting
errors.
It would be the same story in the
final game, as Stanford took its
customary 10-3 lead before the
49ers mounted a last-ditch effort to
close the deficit to 12-6. Then,
enter Hoefer, who teamed with
sophomore swing hitter Mike Lam

bert to block Long Beach for points
13 and 14, before taking charge
and ending the match with a solo
stuff.
"I felt more confident out there
than I've felt all season," Hoefer
said. "We're definitely getting bet

ter as a team, and it got to a point
tonight where winning was easy."
And when it rains it pours.
Stanford got all the breaks that
night, and even busted plays
became winners. On the seventh
point of game three Ceman

screeched "Oh, God!" as he threw
up a misguided set. Miraculously,
his prayers were answered, as the
ball landed within Fuerbringer's
reach, and the 6-foot-7 opposite
slammed it over the net for anoth-

er happy ending.
"It was definitely one of our best
games yet," Lambert said.
The Cardinal set the tone for
Saturday's win with a tough match
against Pepperdine the night
before (15-5, 7-15, 15-12, 15-11).
"We ran into a little trouble
after dominating the first game,"
but we ironed everything out and
played perhaps our best match
since facing (No. 4| USC Itwo
weeks ago)," Nieves said.
After falling behind 2-8 and
then 6-10 in the third game,
Nieves relieved Fuerbringer and
middle blocker Brian Garrett with
sophomore Brink Sanders and
freshman Brian Moore.
The two set to work quickly, as
Moore accounted for points seven
and eight on two solo blocks and
Sanders pounded out two kills to
make it even at 10. Then, after a
brief tug-of-war on the scoreboards,
Moore put the game to rest with a
monstrous kill for game point.
"We have confidence in all our
players," Nieves said. "And
Canyon showed lots of poise and
leadership by being patient when
we struggled with passing and hit
ting errors."
Nevertheless, Ceman had a
tremendous outing with 84 sets
and six digs. "Canyon did an excel
lent job by setting our quick hit
ters at the right time. He realized
that Pepperdine knows to wait and
block our big hitters, so Canyon
spread the ball around to the quick
hitters and gave them more and
more confidence as the game pro
gressed."

er happy ending.
"It was definitely one of our best
games yet," Lambert said.
The Cardinal set the tone for
Saturday's win with a tough match
against Pepperdine the night
before (15-5, 7-15, 15-12, 15-11).
"We ran into a little trouble
after dominating the first game,"
but we ironed everything out and
played perhaps our best match
since facing (No. 4| USC Itwo
weeks ago)," Nieves said.
After falling behind 2-8 and
then 6-10 in the third game,
Nieves relieved Fuerbringer and
middle blocker Brian Garrett with
sophomore Brink Sanders and
freshman Brian Moore.
The two set to work quickly, as
Moore accounted for points seven
and eight on two solo blocks and
Sanders pounded out two kills to
make it even at 10. Then, after a
brief tug-of-war on the scoreboards,
Moore put the game to rest with a
monstrous kill for game point.
"We have confidence in all our
players," Nieves said. "And
Canyon showed lots of poise and
leadership by being patient when
we struggled with passing and hit
ting errors."
Nevertheless, Ceman had a
tremendous outing with 84 sets
and six digs. "Canyon did an excel
lent job by setting our quick hit
ters at the right time. He realized
that Pepperdine knows to wait and
block our big hitters, so Canyon
spread the ball around to the quick
hitters and gave them more and
more confidence as the game pro
gressed."
Canyon Ceman hits the Burn
ham Pavilion parquet for yet
another point-saving dig. Mike
Lambert then (lies off the court
and takes a tumble into the
announcers' booth to put the ball
back in play. Finally, Joe
Burghardt draws a bead on his tar
get and pounds it across the net for
another kill. End of rally — point
Stanford.
"At the beginning of the season,
the only team making those superb
plays was (No. 1) UCLA," said
Stanford coach Ruben Nieves.
"Anytime you get a dig like that
and turn it into a swing it's a great
conversion. It's plays like that sep
arate the good teams from the
great teams, and the boys from the
men."
Over the weekend, the Cardinal
team made that leap from young
and talented to young, talented
and dangerous with blowout victo
ries against No. 8 Pepperdine (11-7
overall, 9-7 in the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) on Friday and
No. 13 Long Beach State (13-13, 7-
10) the next day.
In what might have been its eas
iest "W" of the season, the No. 3-
ranked Stanford spikers (15-8, 12-
4) limited the 49ers of Long Beach
to just 14 points the entire match
by dominating the scorecard dur
ing the 15-5, 15-3, 15-6 no-contest.
"They served well, they hit well,
they did everything well," said 49er

head coach Ray Ratelle. "Those
guys have a ton of talent, and it
wasn't much of a game."
Middle blocker Michael Hoefer
was just one source of Ratelle's
headache on Saturday as the fresh
man pounded out 10 kills for a .615
hitting percentage, in addition to
leading all defenders with eight
digs and five blocks. Hoefer was
also instrumental in closing out the
first game with a kill off Ceman's
quick set for point 14 and a solid
ace for the game point.
Leading the Cardinal attack,
however, was sophomore opposite
hitter Matt Fuerbringer, who
rebounded from a sub-par game on
Friday to punish the 49ers with a
game-high 17 kills and an astro
nomical .714 average.
"We had them reeling right
from the beginning," Nieves said.
"We served them strategically, and
we served them tough and aggres
sively. That gave us an edge, and
we were able to score with every
one."
The second frame was not much
better for the visiting 49ers. Afler
the Cardinal jumped to an easy 10-
3 lead, Long Beach State fell apart
and coughed up the last two points
of the match on passing and hitting
errors.
It would be the same story in the
final game, as Stanford took its
customary 10-3 lead before the
49ers mounted a last-ditch effort to
close the deficit to 12-6. Then,
enter Hoefer, who teamed with
sophomore swing hitter Mike Lam

bert to block Long Beach for points
13 and 14, before taking charge
and ending the match with a solo
stuff.
"I felt more confident out there
than I've felt all season," Hoefer
said. "We're definitely getting bet

ter as a team, and it got to a point
tonight where winning was easy."
