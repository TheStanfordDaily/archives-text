Pitching plus hitting equals winning baseball.
In taking two of three games from USC at Los Ange
les' Dedeaux Field this weekend, the No. 11 Cardinal
baseball team put all aspects of its game toget her and
pulled to within half a game of first place in the Pacific
10 Conference Southern Division.
Giving itself what head coach Mark Marquess had
called a "fighting chance" at the Six-Pac title, Stanford
(23-15, 12-6 in the Six-Pac) captured Friday night's
opener, 2-1, and rebounded from an 8-3 defeat Satur
day with a 9-3 triumph yesterday. While the series loss
left the second-ranked Trojans (28-10, 14-7) clinging
atop the conference standings, the Cardinal enjoys a

one-game edge in the all-important loss column with 12
games remaining to USC's nine.
Friday's contest placed a premium on pitching, with
sophomore Dan Reed going the distance for Stanford
while allowing one run on six hits and improving his
record to 7-2. Trojan senior Tony Nieto (4-6) absorbed
the loss, but looked equally impressive in limiting the
Cardinal to two runs on just four hits.
So intense was the pitching duel, in fact, that all
three of the game's runs came across by way of sacrifice
plays. USC jumped on the board first as senior catcher
Mike Mancuso led off the fifth inning with a single,
moved to second base on a sacrifice bunt and scored on
a double to center field by junior third baseman Aaron
Boone.
Stanford retaliated with a pair of leadofi'triples and

sacrifice flies in the seventh and eighth innings. Sopho
more catcher A.J. Hinch drove in junior second base
man Jed Hansen for the tying run, while sophomore
rightfielder Brodie Van Wagenen drove in junior
pinchrunner Todd LaÃŸocca for the winning score.
Saturday's game featured offense, most of which
originated from USC bats. The Trojans scored early
and often, posting three runs in the second and two in
the third while freshman phenom Randy Flores (6-0)
retired the first 12 batters he faced en route to an easy
victory. Cardinal freshman shortstop P>ic Sees drove
home senior designated hitter Nate Olmstead in the
fifth to break up Flores' shutout, but Stanford's offense
could not prevent sophomore starter Todd Bartels (4-2)
from taking the loss.
USC added a run in the bottom
of the fifth and plated two off Car
dinal freshman reliever Brendan
Sullivan in the seventh. The Cardi
nal tallied single runs in the sev
enth and eighth, the latter coming
on the third homer of the year by

sophomore centerfielder Cale
Carter.
Yesterday's rubber match fea
tured the hurried return of Stan
ford's first five hitters, who
appeared to be missing in action
while managing just two hits in 35
at-bats over the first two games. So
quick was the re-emergence, in fact,
that Trojan freshman starter Scott
Henderson (3-1) did not survive the
Cardinal's three-run first inning.
Sophomore third baseman

Brian Dallimore led ofi' the game
being hit by a pitch, and Hansen
followed with the first of four hits
on the day. Hinch sacrificed the
runners to second and third, and
Henderson walked Olmstead to
load the bases and get to junior first
baseman Dusty Allen. Allen
promptly unloaded the bases with a
two-run single up the middle, and
sophomore leftfielder Steve Carver
followed with an RBI single of his
own to chase Henderson.

Trojan centerfielder Walter
Dawk ins greeted Stanford starter
Mike Robbins with his 11th homer
of the year to lead off the bottom of
the first, but that would not be a
sign of things to come, as the Cardi
nal responded with two-run innings
in the second, seventh and eighth.
Freshman Tom Reimers, who
relieved Robbins shortly after Boone
launched a two-run homerun for
USC in the third, picked up the vic
tory to improve to 2-3 for Stanford.
