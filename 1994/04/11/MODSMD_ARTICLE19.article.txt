Pitching plus hitting equals winning baseball.
In taking two of three games from USC at Los Ange
les' Dedeaux Field this weekend, the No. 11 Cardinal
baseball team put all aspects of its game toget her and
pulled to within half a game of first place in the Pacific
10 Conference Southern Division.
Giving itself what head coach Mark Marquess had
called a "fighting chance" at the Six-Pac title, Stanford
(23-15, 12-6 in the Six-Pac) captured Friday night's
opener, 2-1, and rebounded from an 8-3 defeat Satur
day with a 9-3 triumph yesterday. While the series loss
left the second-ranked Trojans (28-10, 14-7) clinging
atop the conference standings, the Cardinal enjoys a

one-game edge in the all-important loss column with 12
games remaining to USC's nine.
Friday's contest placed a premium on pitching, with
sophomore Dan Reed going the distance for Stanford
while allowing one run on six hits and improving his
record to 7-2. Trojan senior Tony Nieto (4-6) absorbed
the loss, but looked equally impressive in limiting the
Cardinal to two runs on just four hits.
So intense was the pitching duel, in fact, that all
three of the game's runs came across by way of sacrifice
plays. USC jumped on the board first as senior catcher
Mike Mancuso led off the fifth inning with a single,
moved to second base on a sacrifice bunt and scored on
a double to center field by junior third baseman Aaron
Boone.
Stanford retaliated with a pair of leadofi'triples and

sacrifice flies in the seventh and eighth innings. Sopho
more catcher A.J. Hinch drove in junior second base
man Jed Hansen for the tying run, while sophomore
rightfielder Brodie Van Wagenen drove in junior
pinchrunner Todd LaÃŸocca for the winning score.
Saturday's game featured offense, most of which
originated from USC bats. The Trojans scored early
and often, posting three runs in the second and two in
the third while freshman phenom Randy Flores (6-0)
retired the first 12 batters he faced en route to an easy
victory. Cardinal freshman shortstop P>ic Sees drove
home senior designated hitter Nate Olmstead in the
fifth to break up Flores' shutout, but Stanford's offense
could not prevent sophomore starter Todd Bartels (4-2)
