# Duking it out over districting
## Parceling proposal has Dickert, Lucas going head-to-head 
### Miranda Doyle Editorial staff 
For ASSU senators Gahe Lucas and Sanford Dick
ert, a proposal to split the campus into districts at elec
tion time has turned personal.
At 7a.m. Friday morning, Dickert was knocking on
Lucas' door demanding to know why the author of the
constitutional amendment — which students will vote
on Wednesday and Thursday — refuses to debate him.
Lucas is "avoiding a public discussion," said Dick
ert, who has organized a White Plaza protest for today.
"The man is a weasel," Dickert said. He has even
formed a group of about a dozen students to oppose the
districting plan, calling it Students Against Irrespon
sible Government.
But Lucas said Dickert seems more interested in at
tacking him than arguing over the plan's merits. "I
would go so far as to say there's some kind of personal
mission against me," he said.
Nonsense, Dickert responded. "I do not have a per
sonal vendetta against Gabe. Gabe is acting paranoid,"
he said, adding that his opposition stems from the fact
that the bill is poorly thought-out.
Lucas, a junior, asserts that creating six geographi

cal districts and four class districts for undergraduate
voters would increase ASSU accountability. The
amendment would also move senate elections to fall
quarter and give the senate's 20 non-voting senators
the right to vote.
Currently, candidates are ranked according to elec
tion vote totals and only the top 10 in each category —
graduate or undergraduate — can vote. The next 10 in
each category are alternates, and can cast ballots only
when voting senators fail to attend meetings.
If the amendment passes with two-thirds of the
vote, the senate will divide undergraduate residences
into six districts. Undergraduates will be able to vote
for a candidate within their district and a candidate
within their class, with each district and class electing
two representatives.
The posters plastered all over campus this week
show how impersonal campus-wide campaigns can be,
according to Lucas. "There is no direct campaign to
the students themselves," he said. "There are no de
bates between senators."
Districts "would force candidates to reach out" to
their constituents, Lucas said, and students would
know who their senators are.
But Dickert argues that dis
tricts would "reduce the options
for students to select people who
best represent their interests" —
in other words, candidates run
ning on issues important to mem
bers of ethnic communities or
other special interest groups
would not be able to draw support

from the entire campus.
Campaigning can counteract
that problem, Lucas argues.
"People in special interest groups
have allies. They can tell their
friends," he said, adding that
such candidates can use their
resources to campaign within the
districts.
Dickert said he also worries
about the switch to fall elections,
which would take place during the
fourth or fifth week of the quar
ter, would subject freshmen and

first-year graduate students to
"information overload."
"They're here five weeks into
the program. How are they sup
posed to know what the issues
are?" he asked. "They will be
electing people on the basis of
popularity."
Lucas, however, said fall elec
tions will increase participation in
student government because
"freshmen can right away get
involved." Students would continue
to vote on amendments and special

fee requests in the spring, he added.
Dickert also warned that the
change may result in under-rep
resentation of graduate students
because of their lower level of
participation in the ASSU. There
are currently 10 candidates for 20
graduate senate seats, compared
to 38 students seeking the same
number of undergraduate seats.
But Lucas said giving every
senator a vote will increase partic
ipation and attendance. "Histori
cally, the grad students have had

a harder time coming up with 20
senators," he admitted. However,
he said districting would create
more interest in the ASSU and
help solve that problem.
Dickert has been trying to
derail the amendment for some
time, said Lucas, who gathered
signatures on petitions to get his
amendment on the ballot.
Elections Commissioner Tom
Tsao alerted him after hearing
that Lucas had failed to provide
students with the text of the bill

when soliciting signatures. But he
said Dickert dropped the issue
when Tsao did not find a viola
tion.
Whether Lucas agrees to a
debate or not, Dickert said he will
show up at the ASSU's Tresidder
office at 8 p.m. Tuesday. Lucas,
however, is unlikely to meet him
there.
"I'm not interested in debating
someone who is making these
claims that I acted improperly,"
Lucas said.

signatures on petitions to get his
amendment on the ballot.
Elections Commissioner Tom
Tsao alerted him after hearing
that Lucas had failed to provide
students with the text of the bill

when soliciting signatures. But he
said Dickert dropped the issue
when Tsao did not find a viola
tion.
Whether Lucas agrees to a
debate or not, Dickert said he will
show up at the ASSU's Tresidder
office at 8 p.m. Tuesday. Lucas,
however, is unlikely to meet him
there.
"I'm not interested in debating
someone who is making these
claims that I acted improperly,"
Lucas said.
