# Duking it out over districting
## Parceling proposal has Dickert, Lucas going head-to-head 
### Miranda Doyle Editorial staff 
For ASSU senators Gahe Lucas and Sanford Dick
ert, a proposal to split the campus into districts at elec
tion time has turned personal.
At 7a.m. Friday morning, Dickert was knocking on
Lucas' door demanding to know why the author of the
constitutional amendment — which students will vote
on Wednesday and Thursday — refuses to debate him.
Lucas is "avoiding a public discussion," said Dick
ert, who has organized a White Plaza protest for today.
"The man is a weasel," Dickert said. He has even
formed a group of about a dozen students to oppose the
districting plan, calling it Students Against Irrespon
sible Government.
But Lucas said Dickert seems more interested in at
tacking him than arguing over the plan's merits. "I
would go so far as to say there's some kind of personal
mission against me," he said.
Nonsense, Dickert responded. "I do not have a per
sonal vendetta against Gabe. Gabe is acting paranoid,"
he said, adding that his opposition stems from the fact
that the bill is poorly thought-out.
Lucas, a junior, asserts that creating six geographi

cal districts and four class districts for undergraduate
voters would increase ASSU accountability. The
amendment would also move senate elections to fall
quarter and give the senate's 20 non-voting senators
the right to vote.
Currently, candidates are ranked according to elec
tion vote totals and only the top 10 in each category —
graduate or undergraduate — can vote. The next 10 in
each category are alternates, and can cast ballots only
when voting senators fail to attend meetings.
If the amendment passes with two-thirds of the
vote, the senate will divide undergraduate residences
into six districts. Undergraduates will be able to vote
for a candidate within their district and a candidate
within their class, with each district and class electing
two representatives.
The posters plastered all over campus this week
show how impersonal campus-wide campaigns can be,
according to Lucas. "There is no direct campaign to
the students themselves," he said. "There are no de
bates between senators."
Districts "would force candidates to reach out" to
their constituents, Lucas said, and students would
