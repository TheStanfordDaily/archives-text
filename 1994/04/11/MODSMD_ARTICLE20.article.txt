## Women netters pound to Sun Devil, Wildcat wins 
### Rob Ross Senior staff writer 
The Stanford women's tennis team
blazed through Arizona this weekend,
picking up two wins over conference
opponents in the process.
On Friday the Cardinal (19-2) lit up
the Whitman Tennis Center at Arizona
State (9-8), winning a by surprisingly
close score of 6-3. Saturday's match
proved neither surprising nor close,
however, as Stanford doused the Ari
zona Wildcats (9-12) in Tucson 7-1.
The contest against the Sun Devils
started with a surprise — second
ranked Laxmi Poruri lost her first

match of the season to No. 13 Kori
Davidson. Poruri played Davidson earli
er in the year at Stanford at the No. 1
singles slot and dispatched of the hard
hitting baseliner in two quick sets. But
on Friday, Davidson got her revenge.
Davidson kept Poruri on her heels
with her powerful ground-strokes in
garnering her biggest win of the season.
But, as head coach Frank Brennan
noted, Poruri's uncharacteristically bad
play was the important factor.
"Laxmi just didn't have it on Friday,"
he said. "She had no intensity."
Against Wildcat Celine Verdier,
Poruri obviously found "it" again. Her
strong strokes were overpowering and

resulted in a 6-2, 6-3 win.
Playing No. 2 singles, senior Kristine
Kurth regained her early-season win
ning form. Kurth has struggled of late,
but the Arizona trip seemed just the
cure as she downed Joelle Shad of the
Sun Devils in two sets 6-4, 6-4. In Tuc
son Angela Bernal lost the first set 6-3,
but then stretched Kurth and finally
won a second-set tie breaker 7-6. But
Bernal was not able to duplicate her sec
ond-set win and lost in the third 6-2.
"Kristine had a good weekend,"
Brennan said. "It looks like she's on a
roll now."
F>eshman Katie Schlukebir also had
a victorious weekend, winning both her

matches at No. 3 singles. Kim Shasby
and Beth Berris were unable to repeat
this performance, as both went 1-1 at
No. 4 and No. 5 singles, respectively.
Shasby won in Tempe, defeating
Page Bartelt 6-3, 6-4, but Stephanie
Sammaritano presented Shasby with
too much of a challenge. Her use of loop
ing forehands and well-placed shots con
founded the sophomore all afternoon,
and eventually resulted in a 6-4, 7-5 Ari
zona win.
Berris, who has been trying to work
her way out of a slump, was unsuccess
ful against Kara Schertzer of ASU, los-
ing 6-4, 6-0. The sophomore's for
tunes turned around against the
Wildcat's Melody Falco, however,
as she pulled out a 6-3, 6-4 victory.
There were no surprises at No.
6 singles as freshman Sandra De
Silva added two more notches to
her undefeated season. She did not

drop a set in either match, raising
her record to a team-best 21-0.
Stanford's adversaries includ
ed more than just the opposing
players this weekend. Much of the
team has been battling the flu. In
fact, on Monday Brennan expect
ed that he would have to replace a
couple of his sicker starters for
the Grand Canyon trip, but since
they were all ready to play by Fri
day, replacements were unneces
sary.
