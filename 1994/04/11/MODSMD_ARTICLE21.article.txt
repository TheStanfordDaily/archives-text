# Splashing tourney win
## Polo captures Spring Championships 
### Kyle Utsumi Staff writer 
The Stanford men's water polo
team kept a good thing going this
weekend by winning the Second
Annual Spring Collegiate Tourna
ment at deGuerre Pool.
After capturing the NCAA title
in the fall, the Cardinal went a
perfect 5-0 in the tournament to
claim the Spring Championships.
Without the services of the sever
al seniors who were instrumental
to the team's success in the fall, a
younger Stanford squad defeated
Navy (29-6) and UC-San Diego
(33-6) on Friday, and posted victo
ries over Pepperdine (33-21) and
UCLA (16-12) Saturday.
The tournament featured an
experimental scoring system
which awarded two-points for a
goal from within seven meters
and three for those from beyond
the line. The official
NCAA rules award one or two
points for a goal, depending on
the distance.
Kven with the new scoring sys
tem, Stanford and California
could only manage 15 points
between them in the champi
onship match, with the Cardinal
prevailing, 9-6.
Coach Dante Dettamanti

attributed the low score to fatigue
and the excellent play of both
goaltenders. Stanford's Jack
Bowen collected 12 saves, many
from point-blank range when the
Bears had man-advantage oppor
tunities. Cal's Sean Nolan turned
away 13 Cardinal shots-on-goal.
For Bowen, the championship
match was a great confidence
boost for the rest of the spring
and next fall's NCAA season. The
junior has spent two seasons
backing up Ail-American Larry
Bercutt after red-shirting his
freshman year.
"I'm trying to get used to the
starting role," Bowen said. "1
spent the whole day visualizing. 1
came down to the pool this morn
ing to warm up, and I knew I was
ready for anything. That's a good
mindset for a goalie. When a guy
had the ball, I was thinking,
'Where is he going to shoot it?' I
knew there was no place he could
score."
Indeed, the Golden Bears
rarely found space to put the ball
in the net, as they failed to score a
natural goal. Cal tallied twice on
6-on-5 man advantages, and once
on a penalty shot.

sive effort of his Cardinal team
mates, saying, "They work so hard
on defense. They were dictating
where a lot of the shots were going."
While the offense wasn't exactly
resting, they were having trouble
putting the ball away, hitting the

bar several times and missing just
high or wide on other occasions.
Much of the offense the Cardi
nal did manage to muster came
thanks to sophomore Daniel
Lehoczky, who netted a 6-on-5 goal
as well as a three-pointer, which he
fired at an unprepared Nolan.
"I saw [Nolan] come out [of the
goal]," Lehoczky said. "He always
comes out to help. I saw a hole
behind him and took the shot."

Lehoczky's tally came off an
assist by Dan Hancock, who also
assisted on a goal by All-American
Wolf Wigo. Sophomore Jeremy
Laster accounted for the rest of
Stanford's points.
Hancock led the team in scoring
for the tournament with 21 points.
Laster (19 points), Frank Schnei
der (18), Lehoczky (17) and fresh
man Brian Wallin (14) also con
tributed to the Stanford attack.
