# Splashing tourney win
## Polo captures Spring Championships 
### Kyle Utsumi Staff writer 
The Stanford men's water polo
team kept a good thing going this
weekend by winning the Second
Annual Spring Collegiate Tourna
ment at deGuerre Pool.
After capturing the NCAA title
in the fall, the Cardinal went a
perfect 5-0 in the tournament to
claim the Spring Championships.
Without the services of the sever
al seniors who were instrumental
to the team's success in the fall, a
younger Stanford squad defeated
Navy (29-6) and UC-San Diego
(33-6) on Friday, and posted victo
ries over Pepperdine (33-21) and
UCLA (16-12) Saturday.
The tournament featured an
experimental scoring system
which awarded two-points for a
goal from within seven meters
and three for those from beyond
the line. The official
NCAA rules award one or two
points for a goal, depending on
the distance.
Kven with the new scoring sys
tem, Stanford and California
could only manage 15 points
between them in the champi
onship match, with the Cardinal
prevailing, 9-6.
Coach Dante Dettamanti

attributed the low score to fatigue
and the excellent play of both
goaltenders. Stanford's Jack
Bowen collected 12 saves, many
from point-blank range when the
Bears had man-advantage oppor
tunities. Cal's Sean Nolan turned
away 13 Cardinal shots-on-goal.
For Bowen, the championship
match was a great confidence
boost for the rest of the spring
and next fall's NCAA season. The
junior has spent two seasons
backing up Ail-American Larry
Bercutt after red-shirting his
freshman year.
"I'm trying to get used to the
starting role," Bowen said. "1
spent the whole day visualizing. 1
came down to the pool this morn
ing to warm up, and I knew I was
ready for anything. That's a good
mindset for a goalie. When a guy
had the ball, I was thinking,
'Where is he going to shoot it?' I
knew there was no place he could
score."
Indeed, the Golden Bears
rarely found space to put the ball
in the net, as they failed to score a
natural goal. Cal tallied twice on
6-on-5 man advantages, and once
on a penalty shot.
