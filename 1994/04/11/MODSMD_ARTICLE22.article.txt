# Threepeat?
## Gymnastics flips to 2nd, on to NCAAs 
### Sam Wu Staff writer 
Stanford's two-time defending national
champion men's gymnastics team missed 10
times last weekend but still hit its target.
Indeed, the fifth-ranked Cardinal stumbled
on 10 of its routines during Saturday's NCAA
Western Regional Championships in Norman,
Okla. Nonetheless, with a 284.65-point tally, it
still managed to finish second behind top-ranked
Nebraska's 287.025 points and earn another
trip to the NCAA Championships, which will
take place two weeks from now in Lincoln, Neb.
Meanwhile, third-ranked Oklahoma followed
Stanford closely with a 284.475 total to secure
the last NCAA invitation and end the season for
No. 4 UCLA, California and New Mexico.
"I'm very glad to make NCAAs," said head
coach Sadao Hamada. "That's what we really
cared about."
Although Hamada's words may suggest relief
rather than pleasure in his team's performance,
he certainly did not wish to convey the former
idea. As he was quick to point out, it was not as
though the Cardinal benefited from sub-par
meets by its opponents.
While Stanford had five of its 10 missed rou
tines count towards its overall score, the Corn
huskers put together an almost perfect meet to
prevail by a 2.5-point margin — only one missed
routine figured into Nebraska's overall score. In
addition, the Cardinal could muster minimal
contribution from junior all-around star Jing-
Wei Liang, who only competed on pommel horse
because of back pains.
"Nothing really bad happened," Hamada
said. "We just had a few misses here and there.
That's the only reason why we were behind
Nebraska."
Senior tri-captain Chris Sey echoed his
coach's sentiments.
"I think we did well under the circum
stances," Sey said. "Jing-Wei didn't compete
much, and I myself was a little nervous because
of the threat that it was my last meet. But we
have a tradition of coming through when it
counts."
Indeed, Stanford's outing at regionals provid
ed both team and individual highlights. With
regard to team performance, the Cardinal post
ed a season-best score 0f47.90 on rings, an event
that has been difficult for the squad all year
long.
As for individual efforts, Liang and senior tn
captain Mark Booth led the Cardinal with scores
of 9.75, Liang on pommel horse and Booth on
parallel bars. Meanwhile, junior Evan Wells
posted a 9.725 on pommel horse, freshman
Keith Wiley earned a 9.70 on high bar and senior
Aaron Kushner garnered a 9.70 on rings.
"As a team, we were more focused [than dur
ing last weekend's Mountain Pacific Sports Fed
eration Championshipsl," Booth said. "We were
less worried about other teams and each other.
Instead, we were focused on ourselves and what
we each had to do."
"Speaking for myself, last weekend, I thought
about doing well in all-arounds and I wanted the
team to do well — there were a lot of distrac
tions. That was eliminated this meet."
Hamada said the Western
Regionals gave Stanford an
encouraging indication of how to
win the NCAA Championships.
"Nebraska is definitely the team
to beat," said the coach. "But
they're not going to improve much
more by NCAAs. They're about a
287-point team, while we are capa
ble of 289-290 points. I feel very
positive because we now know
exactly what we have to do, and
that's to just be more consistent
and hit our routines."

According to Hamada, steady
practice and execution with a com
petitive mindset will improve con
sistency. So Hamada will simulate
a competitive atmosphere for the
final weeks of training by holding
an intra-squad meet in the Ford
Center at 4 p.m. Friday.
As long as practice proceeds
well, the Cardinal believes it will
prevail.
"We practiced a lot so we were
exhausted for this meet," Sey said.
"But [in] two weeks we're going to
be in better shape. Last year, we got
second at regionals and went on to
win it all. History repeats itself —
this weekend proved we can win
NCAAs."
