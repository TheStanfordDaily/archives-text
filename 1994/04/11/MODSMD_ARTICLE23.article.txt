# Men topple Arizona teams
## No. 1 tennis wins two, sports new singles lineup 
### Mike Langford Senior staff writer 
Results in the matches against Arizona and Ari
zona State were not the most surprising aspect of
the Stanford men's tennis team's weekend. Neither
was the fact that the team got enough matches fin
ished before Friday's rainfall.
In a 4-1 victory over the Wildcats and a 6-0 win
over the Sun Devils, top-ranked Stanford (17-1)
for the first time sported significantly new looks at
the bottom of its singles lineup. Undefeated in
dual match play, sophomore Jim Thomas was
moved up to fourth singles, while both Vimal Patel
and Chris Cocotos were used at fifth singles and
sophomore Ricky Becker was given some work at
sixth singles.
"We usually evaluate the lineup after the first
lUSC and UCLA] matches," said Stanford head
coach Dick Gould. "My main goal this weekend was
to get Ricky (Becker) in some matches. He's our sev
enth singles player, and if someone gets injured, he
needs to be ready to play."
Friday against Arizona, the Cardinal looked to
rebound from its loss against USC. And although
Stanford defeated the Wildcats by a slim 4-3 margin
two weeks ago in Tucson, the Cardinal dominated in
the contest.
With threatening skies overhead, both teams
agreed to start with singles and hoped to get the
match done before the rain began to fall. Sure
enough, as the last singles matches were finishing,
the skies opened up. Fortunately for both teams, the
match was decided by that time, making the doubles
matches unnecessary.
Jeff Salzenstein scored the quickest win, a 6-2, 6-
1 trouncing of Wildcat Jason Appel at second sin
gles. Thomas, Patel and Michael Flanagan also
recorded straight-set wins over their opponents.
Senior All-American Flanagan, ranked No. 9 in the
nation, continued his strong play with a 6-3, 6-4 win
over 12th-ranked Jan Anderson, a match he lost two
weeks ago.

Robert Devens, up 6-3, 5-2 against Sten Sum
berg, was not able to put his opponent away, losing
two straight games before the match was stopped
because of the oncoming rain with Devens leading.
At sixth singles, Becker lost to Chris Jenkins, 6-3,
6-1.
"For a team that we split singles with two weeks
ago, I'm very pleased with our performance against
Arizona," Gould said.
Sunday dawned bright and dry, and Stanford was
able to play a complete match — which was unfortu
nate for the Sun Devils, who lost 7-0.
ASU was without its two top players, third
ranked Sargis Sargsian and Eric Brunner. When the
team discovered that the two possibly accepted
money, which is against NCAA rules, ASU reported
the problem and voluntarily suspended the players.
An investigation is pending.
Two weeks ago at full strength, the Sun Devils
lost to Stanford 5-1. Without the top of its lineup,
ASU had no chance.
Stanford got the first point of the match after
quickly winning all three doubles matches. The clos
est of the three was at second doubles, where Patel
and Salzenstein beat their opponents in a tie-breaker.
Singles was more of the same. Flanagan demol
ished his opponent, Peter Jeschke, by a score of 6-
0, 6-1. Salzenstein topped Paul Reber 6-4, 6-2, and
upped his record to 13-2 in dual matches. Devens
dominated Sergio Elias, winning by a score of 6-0,
6-2.
Thomas showed the fourth slot suits him just
fine, winning his second straight match at that spot
in a 6-0, 6-4 victory over Dennis Roberts. It took
Cocotos three sets to get the win over Mike MacKay,
and Ricky Becker rebounded well from Friday's loss
to beat Wolf Von Lindenau 6-2, 6-2.
"On Friday, Ricky played like someone who
hadn't played singles in a while," Gould said. "He
came back (on Saturday) with more confidence and
got the win."
Stanford will next take on the University of Utah
Tuesday at 1:30 p.m. at the Stanford Tennis Stadium.
