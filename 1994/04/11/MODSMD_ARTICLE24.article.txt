Challenging Internship in Software
Engineering
Get real world experience! We are looking for applicants
that have an excellent academic record, an interest in
programming end-user software, familiarity with
programming in C and Windows.
You will be working in the Engineering Department
significantly contributing to the design of new products
and/or the upgrade of current products. Past interns have
experienced national recognition for their contributions. For
example, a major portion of our product, Uncle Sam's Budget
Balancer, was coded by an intern. Reviews of that product
were written up in The Wall Street Journal, The Washington
Post, and several Bay Area newspapers. CNN did a feature
interview with Banner Blue's president giving the product
national coverage. This is an excellent opportunity for
ambitious students who want "Real Life" experience in the
software industry.
Challenging Internship in Product Marketing
The Ideal candidate will have an excellent academic record,
preferably a technical background. Computer Science majors
are encouraged to apply, applications from all majors will be

IBM PC is essential, especially knowledge of DOS and
proficiency on Windows applications such as Excel and Word

on one or several large summer marketing projects. No
telemarketing, no sales, and no "gofer" work! Previous
interns have worked on major projects including
advertisements for publications in national magazines,
market research to determine features for a new product, and
competitive analyses. This internship is an excellent
introduction for anyone thinking about a career in product or
brand management.
