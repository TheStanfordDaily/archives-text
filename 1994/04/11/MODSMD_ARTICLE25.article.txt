# Former USSR still unstable, panel says
## 
### Nereyda Salinas 
The situation of the former Soviet Union
remains uncertain because of the growing
assertiveness of Russian foreign policy toward
the region's new countries, diplomats and aca
demic experts said at a conference in the
Tresidder Oak Room Friday.
Dignitaries from two former Soviet
republics, Estonia and Kyrgyzstan, joined vis
iting Russian and Georgian scholars in a panel
discussion on the current problems of Russia
and the "Near Abroad," which refers to the
surrounding states created by the demise of
the Soviet empire.
The discussion was part of "Russia and Its
Neighbors," an all-day conference co-spon
sored by the Center for Russian and East
European Studies and UC-Berkeley's Center
for Slavic and East European Studies. The
panels brought together experts from both the
world of academia and prominent internation
al diplomats.
The discussion on Russia's relationship
with the former Soviet republics was moderat
ed by Political Science Prof. Alexander Dallin,
director of Stanford's Center for Russian and
East European Studies. Also participating
were Estonian Ambassador to the U.S.
Toomas lives and Kyrgyzstan's American-
Canadian Ambassador, Roza Otunbayeva.

Speaking first, lives addressed the issue of
the continued presence of the Russian mili
tary in Estonia. He pointed out that "with the
continued stationing, there are presently
more Russian troops than Estonian troops on
Estonian soil."
He added that Estonians believe Russia
should hasten the process of removing its
forces from the former Soviet republic, even at
the expense of straining Russian-Estonian
interaction. "The relations [with Russia] are
not good," he said, but added that "we won't
give up" until Russia agrees to full withdraw
al of its forces.
He also criticized Russia's desire to defend
ethnic Russians in Estonia, stressing that
"there is nothing wrong with defending your
citizens abroad, but defending your co-ethnics
abroad could be very dangerous." lives went
on to compare such practices to the mentality
Hitler used in conquering Europe.
Russia's continued presence in Estonia
reflects a worrisome policy toward many for
mer Soviet republics, lives said.
"Regarding the Near Abroad, Russia's for
eign interest attempts to maintain control and
are dangerous," he said.
Meanwhile, Otunbayeva spoke of the diffi
culty of running a new country. "In gaining
independence from Russia, we now know
nothing about our country — all of the

archives are still in Moscow." With an
absent past she also mentioned the challeng
ing present, where Kyrgyzstan has to survive
without the goods that were formerly provid
ed by the Soviet centralized economy. In refer
ence to trade, Otunbayeva added that now,
more than ever before, "we have to develop
good foreign relations with the surrounding
countries."
Yet in spite of the potential for increased
economic interdependence, Sergei Arutiunov
of the Russian Academy of Sciences, presently
a visiting lecturer at Stanford, said he sees a
polarization within the Near Abroad taking
place. "An oversimplified formation of black
and white in the world" — in which relations
among the new states are hampered by persis
tent political animosities — is taking hold.
"I hope we find an escape [from the grow
ing dissent]," he said, "but I don't see such an
escape."
Other panels at the conference examined
academic and political approaches to the col
lapse of the Soviet Union and the problems
left in its wake, including discussion of histor
ical treatment of the region and future
prospects of the "New Europe."
While the conference did not give rise to
any clear solutions, Dallin said there was "a
greater sense of the underlying complexity of
the whole problem."
