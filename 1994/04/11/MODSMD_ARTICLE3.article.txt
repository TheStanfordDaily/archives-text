## Cost-conscious hosptial cuts incinerator use, 7 employees 
### Josh Gohlke Staff writer 
Seven employees who operate
the University's medical waste in
cinerator will be laid off due to
Stanford Hospital's decision to
employ new, less expensive dis
posal technologies, officials an
nounced last week.
Until now, the hospital has
contracted with the University —
which owns the incinerator — to
dispose of its medical waste out
put, but it is currently negotiating
with an outside contractor that

specializes in such alternative
technologies as microwave, auto
clave and steam destruction. The
incinerator is located on Oak
Road, west of Campus Drive West.
The decision, which will result
in severely reduced use of the in
cinerator, was made as a result of
the hospital's ongoing investiga
tion into ways to reduce spending,
according to Larry Gibbs, director
of Environmental Health and
Safety.
"It goes back to the whole issue
of health-care cost containment,"
Gibbs said. "The hospital that

uses the facility is trying to reduce
the cost of medical care."
Although some of the new
methods are more environmental
ly sound than incineration, Gibbs
said their net environmental ef
fect as compared with that of the
older method is "difficult to say."
The employees — one supervi
sor and six United Stanford Work
ers union members — were noti
fied that the hospital was looking
into new disposal methods in late
February, Gibbs said.
