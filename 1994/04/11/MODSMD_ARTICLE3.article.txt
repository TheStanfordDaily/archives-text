## Cost-conscious hosptial cuts incinerator use, 7 employees 
### Josh Gohlke Staff writer 
Seven employees who operate
the University's medical waste in
cinerator will be laid off due to
Stanford Hospital's decision to
employ new, less expensive dis
posal technologies, officials an
nounced last week.
Until now, the hospital has
contracted with the University —
which owns the incinerator — to
dispose of its medical waste out
put, but it is currently negotiating
with an outside contractor that

specializes in such alternative
technologies as microwave, auto
clave and steam destruction. The
incinerator is located on Oak
Road, west of Campus Drive West.
The decision, which will result
in severely reduced use of the in
cinerator, was made as a result of
the hospital's ongoing investiga
tion into ways to reduce spending,
according to Larry Gibbs, director
of Environmental Health and
Safety.
"It goes back to the whole issue
of health-care cost containment,"
Gibbs said. "The hospital that

uses the facility is trying to reduce
the cost of medical care."
Although some of the new
methods are more environmental
ly sound than incineration, Gibbs
said their net environmental ef
fect as compared with that of the
older method is "difficult to say."
The employees — one supervi
sor and six United Stanford Work
ers union members — were noti
fied that the hospital was looking
into new disposal methods in late
February, Gibbs said.
However, Jon Showalter, the
deputy trustee at the USW, said
the change in plans and the lay
offs was somewhat unexpected,
given Stanford's previous invest
ment in the facility.
"It is surprising, because it's
our understanding that the Uni
versity spent a gob of money to
get the incinerator up to code
over the past four years,"
Showalter said.
Gibbs said the University has
made a "significant investment"
in the incinerator, but that it
had to be kept up to changing
safety codes in order to continue
operation. He said that the new
technologies have only recently
become feasible for large
amounts of waste, and that
these advances were unforesee
able.
Although medical waste from
the hospital and the Lucile Salter
Packard Children's Hospital
accounts for 80 percent of the
incinerator's load, Gibbs said the
facility will not be completely
shut down, partly due to the Uni
versity's investment in it.
Even if other medical-waste
producers such as Cowell Stu
dent Health Center and the
School of Medicine decide to
follow the hospital's lead, the
incinerator will be maintained
for certain types of waste and
as a "backup facility," Gibbs
said.
The administration has agreed
to "work closely" with the dis
placed employees to find employ
ment for them within or outside
the University, Showalter said.
"They're just beginning that
process," he said.
