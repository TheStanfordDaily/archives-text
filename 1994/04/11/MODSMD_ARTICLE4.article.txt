### Piers Henwood 
Innovative pop duo They Might He Giants will
headline the 20th annual Rinc-A-Delt event, organiz
ers announced last week.
Scheduled for May 15 at Frost Amphitheater, the
concert will be free of charge for registered Stanford
students, making it Rinc-A-Delt's first free concert in
Frost Amphitheater.
They Might. Be Giants, lead by guitarist/vocalist
John Flansburgh and accordionist John Linnell, are
currently in the midst of a nationwide college tour.
Their unique lyrical style and playful approach to mu
sicianship have garnered rave reviews, ranging from
the 1A Weekly's description of the duo as "cheesy in

the most profound way possible" to the New York
Times' "mentally hyperactive and proud of it."
Junior Jason Colton, director of the Stanford Con
cert Network, which helps to fund Rinc-A-Delt, de
scribed the group's brand of pop as "nerd rock."
Rinc-A-Delt, one of Stanford's best known annual
parties, came into existence 20 years ago as the brain
child of several Rinconada freshmen. Having since
combined forces with the Concert Network, it has
hosted major names such as the Red Hot Chili Pep
pers and Phish.
Freshman Tammie Glass, the event's co-publicity
coordinator, emphasized that the goal of keeping this
year's concert free was central in
Rinconada's planning.
"It was very important for us
to make the show free to all stu
dents," she said. "We have been
pretty successful in our fundrais
ing efforts and decided that Stan
ford students pay for enough on
this campus."
To achieve this end, Rinconada
has initiated several fundraising

campaigns over the past few
months, including the sale of
roses on Valentine's Day and cur
rent dorm solicitation efforts.
According to Sasha Aickin, anoth
er publicist, steady progress is
being made.
"Rinconada has raised about
$4,000 up to this point, and we're
hoping to end up around $7,000,"
he said. "Other expenses will be
taken care of by the Concert Net
work."
Colton declined to estimate
how much the Concert Network
will spend on the event, but said

that "our approach to Rinc-A-
Delt is that it is a service-oriented
concert" and that organizers sim
ply aim to break even.
In order to be admitted to
Rinc-A-Delt '94, all Stanford stu
dents will require a valid Stan
ford ID and a photo ID. For facul
ty, staff and the general public,
tickets are $12 and are currently
on sale at the Tresidder Ticket
Office and all Bass outlets.
The concert is scheduled to
begin at 2 p.m. and will include an
opening act. Doors to Frost will
open at 1 p.m.
