## Student leaders fear future budget battles 
### Scott Van Winkle Staff writer 
Student leaders who rallied to defend eth -
nic centers from possible budget cuts said
their sometimes contentious struggle with
the administration will continue, despite
Thursday's announcement that community
centers would not lose funds next year.
"If it's not progress, at least it's not re
gression," said MEChA co-chair Gabriela
Cervantes, a leader of the Chicano/Latino
community, adding that administrators

could make public battles — like the one
waged in recent months between students
of color and the administration — neces
sary in the future if they have not "learned
from their mistakes."
The $1 million cuts from student service
budgets — announced at a town meeting
held by Vice Provost for Student Affairs
Mary Edmonds — included a 24 percent cut
from Tresidder Union's budget as well as
cuts to a number of administrative offices
