## Student leaders fear future budget battles 
### Scott Van Winkle Staff writer 
Student leaders who rallied to defend eth -
nic centers from possible budget cuts said
their sometimes contentious struggle with
the administration will continue, despite
Thursday's announcement that community
centers would not lose funds next year.
"If it's not progress, at least it's not re
gression," said MEChA co-chair Gabriela
Cervantes, a leader of the Chicano/Latino
community, adding that administrators

could make public battles — like the one
waged in recent months between students
of color and the administration — neces
sary in the future if they have not "learned
from their mistakes."
The $1 million cuts from student service
budgets — announced at a town meeting
held by Vice Provost for Student Affairs
Mary Edmonds — included a 24 percent cut
from Tresidder Union's budget as well as
cuts to a number of administrative offices
and the Haas Center for Public
Service.
But ethnic centers, as well as
the Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual
Community Center and the
Women's Center, will face no
budget cuts next year. Neither
will the Career Planning and
Placement Center, the Under
graduate Advising Center and the
Center for Teaching and Learn
ing.
Students who were active in
the Students of Color Coalition,
which organized several rallies
and forums last fall and early this
year to discuss possible losses to
ethnic centers, reacted with sur
prise and approval while express
ing concern for the future.
"It's a big relief for us, but I

know ... it's not really over yet,"
said Myra Parker, chair of the
Stanford American Indian Orga
nization.
Only next year's budgets for
Student Affairs were announced
Thursday, although the Universi
ty plans to continue cutting
through the following two years.
About $6 million of the $18 mil
lion to $20 million in total cuts
expected by 1997 will be made to
next year's budget.
Parker was also concerned
that ethnic center staff might be
forced to serve non-related
administrative functions because
the Office of Student Activities
had been placed under the Dean
of Students Office, which admin
isters the ethnic centers.
Dean of Students Michael
Jackson said at Thursday's meet
ing that he may redistribute
responsibilities throughout his
office because of the change.

"Everything we do needs
money," said sophomore Nicole
Vazquez, co-treasurer of MEChA.
"[Budget cuts] make everything
we've stood for — cultural pride,
community stability — vulnera
ble."
While Vazquez said the
announcement hadn't changed
her suspicion toward the adminis
tration, she also said, "At least
now they're listening. ... I feel
like there really is a dialogue
going on."
Such a dialogue "doesn't com
pletely relieve the tension"
between student communities
and the administration, she said,
but it "brightens things for the
future."
Council of Presidents mem
bers Jason Snyder and Ron
Brown were more sanguine. The
decision is a sign that administra
tors "did in fact carefully consider
the needs of the student body"

and "a result of the University
receiving many different forms of
student input," said Brown.
"It was clear from the outset
that the goals of the budget-cut
ting process were to maintain
essential student services," he
said. "The rallying efforts seemed
to highlight what the students
considered (essential) services."
Snyder said, "The Provost and
Mary Edmonds have done a rea
sonable job of mitigating the
effects on student services (of
budget cuts), and that's what our
number one priority was as stu
dent representatives."
The University "is never static,
and with an $18 million to $20
million budget reduction, there's
never anything that we're going to
be jumping up and down about,"
he said, but "at this point the
results have been satisfactory."
Parker, on the other hand, was
concerned by Provost Condoleez

za Rice's argument that student
input is not necessary in every
decision she makes.
Parker feared that such "prob
lems with communications" will
continue. "They're not really
hearing what we're asking," she
said. "I wish that instead of send
ing their decisions and viewpoints
down, . . . they would just talk to
us."
Senior Rachel Maddow, an
LGBCC staff member, worried
that "massive mobilization"
would be required again in the
future. "People went to extreme
lengths," she said, "and we creat
ed a better student organization
and created a lot of pressure"
which forced administrators to
respond.
"In an ideal world, this would
lead to a more student-oriented
process all the way through," said
Maddow, "But I don't think it
will."
