# A 						switch to semesters?
## CUE advisory group compiles recommendations 
### Colleen Krueger Staff writer 
Recommendations of the group of stu
dents affiliated with the Commission on
Undergraduate Education will likely in
clude switching to a semester system and
changing Dead Week to include two days
without classes.
Emphasizing specifics, the Student Ad
visory Group on Undergraduate Educa
tion's steering committee met this week

end to hammer together these and other
suggestions for its parent commission.
And although its ideas will generally be
consistent with the reports of the commis
sion's seven subcommittees, the student
advisory group's recommendations will
likely break away on the issues of distribu
tion requirements, the Cultures, Ideas and
Values track and teaching quality.
"The students' ideas are sometimes in
line with what the committees are
recommending, sometimes stu
dents' own viewpoint," said Eddie
Garcia, chair of the advisory
group. "Often there are different
areas we want to emphasize as
students."
The advisory group's steering
committee is made up of Garcia,
Council of Presidents member
Ying-Ying Goh, two administra
tive coordinators, the two stu
dents on the commission itself
and the 10 student members of
the commission's seven subcom
mittees.
The advisory group will recom
mend a DR system very similar to
what the breadth requirements
subcommittee is proposing, Gar
cia said.
Last week, the commission's
subcommittee on breadth
requirements proposed a new sys
tem of distribution requirements
that would include a year-long sci
ence sequence for all students.
While the advisory group
agrees with the spirit of this pro
posal, it will recommend a two
quarter lab-intensive experience,
said Breadth Requirement Sub
committee member Greg
Gilchrist.
The advisory group will also
propose firmer, concrete changes
in CIV, Garcia said. "I think as far
as CIV goes the changes proposed
in '86 were never truly imple
mented," he added, referring to
the shift in 1986 from the old
Western Culture course to the
present CIV requirement.
"We have the same ideas (as
the subcommittee) but we were
far more specific in our propos
als," Gilchrist said. "The commis
sion's recommendations are very
broad and thematic, but we had
the feeling that nothing's going to
get done if we don't recommend
something specific."
The students from the academ
ic calendar subcommittee also
kept their recommendations to
the advisory group in line with
their committee's findings, said

member Ali Rowghani.
In keeping with these propos
als, the group will not recommend
a three-year graduation plan, but
will tentatively propose a change
from a three-quarter calendar to a
semester system, "if the semester
system advances the curricular
goals that the other subcommit
tees define," he said.
"On our subcommittee, there
was a pretty significant sentiment
for semesters," Rowghani said.
"The reason it's tentative — there
weren't any studies done to gauge
the feasibility of semesters: how
they would affect the budget, stu
dent polls, that sort of thing."
Although the group considered
a derivation of Dartmouth's
"sophomore summer" system,
which requires students to
remain on-campus during one
summer quarter, the group ulti
mately discarded the idea.
"We talked about it with a
measure of excitement for a cou
ple of sessions, and then it sort of
faded and we didn't make a very
strong recommendation for it,"
Rowghani said. "It's one of those
good ideas that comes out of the
process of evaluation but nothing
really seems to come of it."
As part of the foreign language
requirement recommendations,
the group discussed the possibili
ty of requiring overseas study for
all students.
"If some permutation of that
requirement is adopted, I think
that will be the most headline
grabbing (proposal) that comes of
the commission," Rowghani said.
"Probably 75 percent supported
the idea, and a quarter said we
can't do this." As a result, the
group has not yet developed such
a recommendation.
Another recommendation
that will come out of the adviso
ry group's discussions is a
strong stance on Dead Week.
The group will probably advo
cate two completely "dead" days
— Thursday and Friday — with
no papers, tests and classes,
Rowghani said.
"Coming from the perspective
of an academic environment, the
fact that we don't have a dead
week is ridiculous," said Academ

ic Calendar Subcommittee mem
ber Smeeta Ramarthanam.
The advisory group's recom
mendations on the student advis
ing system will be delayed, as the
academic environment subcom
mittee itself may receive an exten
sion from the commission.
The advisory group will also
include a section on teaching
quality in its report since "no sub
committee has really formally
looked at it," Garcia said.
The representatives from each
subcommittee proposed changes
in their area to the steering com
mittee for discussion, Garcia said.
The steering committee then dis
cussed each proposal and agreed
upon a recommendation to send
the commission.
"Now we're in the draft stages,
trying to rewrite the recommen
dations to a standard format,"
Garcia said. "We're in the back
room at this point, hitting the
word processors pretty hard."
The student advisory group
will present its report to the com
mission "within two weeks at the
most so we can be
influential to some extent on
CUE's final meetings," Garcia
said, adding that a copy of the rec
ommendations will also be sent to
the president and the provost.
And while the members of the
advisory group said they are try
ing to be realistic about their
report's influence, many also
hope their ideas will affect the
commission's final recommenda
tions.
"I think they're going to read
it, and pay attention to it,"
Rowghani said. "I don' t think
we're going to be ignored, and I
don't think the student report is
going to be earth-shattering in
influence."
Garcia said he tries to remain
optimistic, adding with a note of
resignation that "these days it's
hard to tell what's going to hap
pen around here."
"They've been really open
through this process, up to this
point, and really supportive in
terms of staff and funding," Gar
cia said. "All we can hope is that
that means there's an avenue for
us."

we're going to be ignored, and I
don't think the student report is
going to be earth-shattering in
influence."
Garcia said he tries to remain
optimistic, adding with a note of
resignation that "these days it's
hard to tell what's going to hap
pen around here."
"They've been really open
through this process, up to this
point, and really supportive in
terms of staff and funding," Gar
cia said. "All we can hope is that
that means there's an avenue for
us."
Recommendations of the group of stu
dents affiliated with the Commission on
Undergraduate Education will likely in
clude switching to a semester system and
changing Dead Week to include two days
without classes.
Emphasizing specifics, the Student Ad
visory Group on Undergraduate Educa
tion's steering committee met this week

end to hammer together these and other
suggestions for its parent commission.
And although its ideas will generally be
consistent with the reports of the commis
sion's seven subcommittees, the student
advisory group's recommendations will
likely break away on the issues of distribu
tion requirements, the Cultures, Ideas and
Values track and teaching quality.
"The students' ideas are sometimes in
line with what the committees are
recommending, sometimes stu
dents' own viewpoint," said Eddie
Garcia, chair of the advisory
group. "Often there are different
areas we want to emphasize as
students."
The advisory group's steering
committee is made up of Garcia,
Council of Presidents member
Ying-Ying Goh, two administra
tive coordinators, the two stu
dents on the commission itself
and the 10 student members of
the commission's seven subcom
mittees.
The advisory group will recom
mend a DR system very similar to
what the breadth requirements
subcommittee is proposing, Gar
cia said.
Last week, the commission's
subcommittee on breadth
requirements proposed a new sys
tem of distribution requirements
that would include a year-long sci
ence sequence for all students.
While the advisory group
agrees with the spirit of this pro
posal, it will recommend a two
quarter lab-intensive experience,
said Breadth Requirement Sub
committee member Greg
Gilchrist.
The advisory group will also
propose firmer, concrete changes
in CIV, Garcia said. "I think as far
as CIV goes the changes proposed
in '86 were never truly imple
mented," he added, referring to
the shift in 1986 from the old
Western Culture course to the
present CIV requirement.
"We have the same ideas (as
the subcommittee) but we were
far more specific in our propos
als," Gilchrist said. "The commis
sion's recommendations are very
broad and thematic, but we had
the feeling that nothing's going to
get done if we don't recommend
something specific."
The students from the academ
ic calendar subcommittee also
kept their recommendations to
the advisory group in line with
their committee's findings, said

member Ali Rowghani.
In keeping with these propos
als, the group will not recommend
a three-year graduation plan, but
will tentatively propose a change
from a three-quarter calendar to a
semester system, "if the semester
system advances the curricular
goals that the other subcommit
tees define," he said.
"On our subcommittee, there
was a pretty significant sentiment
for semesters," Rowghani said.
"The reason it's tentative — there
weren't any studies done to gauge
the feasibility of semesters: how
they would affect the budget, stu
dent polls, that sort of thing."
Although the group considered
a derivation of Dartmouth's
"sophomore summer" system,
which requires students to
remain on-campus during one
summer quarter, the group ulti
mately discarded the idea.
"We talked about it with a
measure of excitement for a cou
ple of sessions, and then it sort of
faded and we didn't make a very
strong recommendation for it,"
Rowghani said. "It's one of those
good ideas that comes out of the
process of evaluation but nothing
really seems to come of it."
As part of the foreign language
requirement recommendations,
the group discussed the possibili
ty of requiring overseas study for
all students.
"If some permutation of that
requirement is adopted, I think
that will be the most headline
grabbing (proposal) that comes of
the commission," Rowghani said.
"Probably 75 percent supported
the idea, and a quarter said we
can't do this." As a result, the
group has not yet developed such
a recommendation.
Another recommendation
that will come out of the adviso
ry group's discussions is a
strong stance on Dead Week.
The group will probably advo
cate two completely "dead" days
— Thursday and Friday — with
no papers, tests and classes,
Rowghani said.
"Coming from the perspective
of an academic environment, the
fact that we don't have a dead
week is ridiculous," said Academ

ic Calendar Subcommittee mem
ber Smeeta Ramarthanam.
The advisory group's recom
mendations on the student advis
ing system will be delayed, as the
academic environment subcom
mittee itself may receive an exten
sion from the commission.
The advisory group will also
include a section on teaching
quality in its report since "no sub
committee has really formally
looked at it," Garcia said.
The representatives from each
subcommittee proposed changes
in their area to the steering com
mittee for discussion, Garcia said.
The steering committee then dis
cussed each proposal and agreed
upon a recommendation to send
the commission.
"Now we're in the draft stages,
trying to rewrite the recommen
dations to a standard format,"
Garcia said. "We're in the back
room at this point, hitting the
word processors pretty hard."
The student advisory group
will present its report to the com
mission "within two weeks at the
most so we can be
influential to some extent on
CUE's final meetings," Garcia
said, adding that a copy of the rec
ommendations will also be sent to
the president and the provost.
And while the members of the
advisory group said they are try
ing to be realistic about their
report's influence, many also
hope their ideas will affect the
commission's final recommenda
tions.
"I think they're going to read
it, and pay attention to it,"
Rowghani said. "I don' t think
we're going to be ignored, and I
don't think the student report is
going to be earth-shattering in
influence."
Garcia said he tries to remain
optimistic, adding with a note of
