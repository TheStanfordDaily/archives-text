# The 						great divide?
## Amendment would make undergrads, grads approve special fees separately 
### Jim Luh Staff writer 
A proposed amendment to the
ASSU Constitution aims to reduce
the tension between graduate stu
dents and undergraduates over
the special-fee process, but it re
mains unclear what effect the
amendment would have on ASSU
quarterly fees, refund rates and,
ultimately, student organizations.
If the amendment is approved by
two-thirds of voters in this week's
general election, undergraduate
and graduate votes for special fees
will be considered separately. If
passed, the amendment will apply
to this year's special fee vote.
Under the amendment, if a spe
cial fee is approved by a majority in
one population but not in the
other, the entire amount of the fee

will be levied on the population
that approved it. If a fee is ap
proved by a majority in both popu
lations, all students will pay the
fee as under the current system.
The amendment was intro
duced last spring in the wake of
the rejection of the special fee for
the Graduate Student Association
and growing discontent among
graduate students, who believed
they were funding organizations
catering solely to undergraduates.
Some graduate students even dis
cussed seceding from the ASSU.
The tension culminated this
year in a fee-re fund drive orga
nized by the Graduate Student
Tea Party, an organization formed
last fall to attract attention to
graduate issues. The Tea Party
contributed to a 32 percent
refund rate fall quarter and a 39
percent refund rate winter quar
ter. Refund rates are typically
around 25 percent, and student
groups have in the past included
a "buffer" in their budgets to
account for that rate of refund.
Graduate senator Sanford
Dickert, who co-authored the
amendment, said the rationale
behind the bill was that "graduate
and undergraduate life are two
distinct entities."
The amendment, Dickert said,
would allow graduates and under
graduates to fund organizations
catering to their specific interests
while still allowing both popula

tions to jointly fund organizations
that serve common interests.
"It'll make it easier for groups
to get funding by their con
stituents," he said.
Dickert said the amendment
will also eliminate the "sabotage"
that has plagued the special-fee
system, such as the Tea Party's
refund drive and the rejection of
the Graduate Student Associa
tion's fee.
Electrical engineering gradu
ate student Michael Grant, a co
chair of the Tea Party, said he
sees the amendment as "a perfect
solution" because it would allow
student groups to receive full
funding from the students who
benefit from them most without
unfairly collecting money from
students who do not benefit.
But splitting the special-fee
process may shift more of the bur

den for funding student groups
onto undergraduates, with some
important consequences for stu
dent organizations.
ASSU Financial Manager
Brian Hillger said he could not
accurately predict the effect of the
amendment but offered some
speculation on its possible impact.
"My inclination would be
roughly half the groups will get
funding" from both graduates
and undergraduates, with the
other half funded primarily by the
undergraduates, he said.
That outcome, Hillger said,
would translate into about a 50
percent increase in undergraduate
ASSU fees and a decrease in grad
uate fees. Hillger speculated that
lower fees and a fairer fee system
would bring about a decline in the
graduate refund rate but the
undergraduate refund rate would

probably increase.
A higher undergraduate
refund rate could create problems
for student groups, as many stu
dents who request special-fee
refunds take money back from
every organization.
"Fall quarter this year, over
half the requests were for all the
groups," Hillger said.
Undergraduate senator Gabe
Lucas said he is concerned that an
increase in undergraduate fees —
and in undergraduate refunds —
"could be potentially damaging to
student government and student
groups."
"I think students are very frus
trated . . . with a high fee, and
they don't understand how the
system works," he said.
But Dickert said that effect
might not be too severe, as gradu
ate students might be eager to

fund many groups that benefit
the entire campus, such as club
sports, the ASSU Speakers
Bureau or SURE Escort, or that
benefit the community, such as
service and cultural organiza
tions.
"It's my guess that graduate
students will surprise the under
graduates," Dickert said.
Graduate senator Jerry Yang,
a co-author of the amendment,
said the plan might also improve
the special-fee system in other
ways. Higher fees might cause
students to be more selective
when they vote instead of simply
funding all the groups on the bal
lot, he said.
Student organizations might
also make more concerted efforts
to reduce their reliance on special
fees and to reach out to graduate
students, Yang added.

Brian Hillger said he could not
accurately predict the effect of the
amendment but offered some
speculation on its possible impact.
"My inclination would be
roughly half the groups will get
funding" from both graduates
and undergraduates, with the
other half funded primarily by the
undergraduates, he said.
That outcome, Hillger said,
would translate into about a 50
percent increase in undergraduate
ASSU fees and a decrease in grad
uate fees. Hillger speculated that
lower fees and a fairer fee system
would bring about a decline in the
graduate refund rate but the
undergraduate refund rate would

probably increase.
A higher undergraduate
refund rate could create problems
for student groups, as many stu
dents who request special-fee
refunds take money back from
every organization.
"Fall quarter this year, over
half the requests were for all the
groups," Hillger said.
Undergraduate senator Gabe
Lucas said he is concerned that an
increase in undergraduate fees —
and in undergraduate refunds —
"could be potentially damaging to
student government and student
groups."
"I think students are very frus
trated . . . with a high fee, and
they don't understand how the
system works," he said.
But Dickert said that effect
might not be too severe, as gradu
ate students might be eager to

fund many groups that benefit
the entire campus, such as club
sports, the ASSU Speakers
Bureau or SURE Escort, or that
benefit the community, such as
service and cultural organiza
tions.
"It's my guess that graduate
students will surprise the under
graduates," Dickert said.
Graduate senator Jerry Yang,
a co-author of the amendment,
said the plan might also improve
the special-fee system in other
ways. Higher fees might cause
students to be more selective
when they vote instead of simply
funding all the groups on the bal
lot, he said.
Student organizations might
also make more concerted efforts
to reduce their reliance on special
fees and to reach out to graduate
students, Yang added.
