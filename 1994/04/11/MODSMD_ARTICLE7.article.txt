ultimately, student organizations.
If the amendment is approved by
two-thirds of voters in this week's
general election, undergraduate

will be levied on the population
that approved it. If a fee is ap

fee as under the current system.

Tea Party, an organization formed
last fall to attract attention to
graduate issues. The Tea Party
