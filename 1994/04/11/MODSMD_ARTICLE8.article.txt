## Students mark Nazi atrocities, Bosnian horrors 
### Emily Bazar Staff writer 
A protest jointly commemo
rating the second anniversary
of the war in Bosnia and Na
tional Holocaust Remem
brance Day drew about 40 peo
ple to White Plaza Friday.
Sponsored by Students
Against Genocide (SAGE) and
Hillel, the speak-out was part
of a nationwide campus protest
aimed at raising awareness
about the war, calling the sys
tematic killing of Bosnians an
other act of genocide compara
ble to the Holocaust.
"It is essential that we learn
something from what hap
pened in Europe 50 years ago
and apply t hat to how we react
today," said sophomore Joe
Bialowitz, a speak-out partici
pant. "Otherwise the victims of
Nazi genocide will have died
completely in vain."
Speakers recited poetry and

read accounts about and by vic
tims in Bosnia, accounts which
touched them personally.
Medical student Sheri Fink,
national project coordinator for
SAGE, read an account about the
first person killed during the
Bosnian war, a young female stu
dent soon to graduate from med
ical school.
Fink also identified another
personal interest in Bosnia. "I
see a lot of parallels in the Bosni
an situation to what happened in
the Holocaust," she said. "I'm
Jewish and that affected me a
lot."
Education graduate student
Brad Blitz, SAGE's executive
director, attributed part of the
blame for the genocide to Stan
ford alumni — Secretary of State
Warren Christopher and Secre
tary of Defense William J. Perry
— calling them part of a govern
ment which tolerates genocide
and "has given a green light to
Serbia's aggression."
The protesters also asked peo

ple to sign petitions criticizing
the lack of adequate American
intervention in Bosnia. SAGE
hopes to collect more signatures
before presenting the petitions to
Clinton and other officials on
April 20.
Fink also requested mone
tary donations at the protest,
beginning a campaign to raise
$2,500 which will be used to
send a convoy from Stanford to
Bosnia carrying food and
medicine.
The convoy would be sent
through Hand to Hand, an orga
nization dedicated to aiding
civilians caught in the middle of
the war.
Fink said SAGE will begin
soliciting donations from dorms
and individual students to
finance the convoy. SAGE gath
ered $184 at the protest, which
Fink called "a good start."
SAGE has previously held
public demonstrations on cam
pus, most recently staging a re
enactment of the February
shelling of a Sarajevo market
place. Friday's event was part of
a national student commemora
tion of the Bosnian war's second
anniversary, Blitz said.
