the larger community — is a valuable asset. But
the real question is whether MEChA achieves
these goals with a tight budget, attempts to
fund itself when it can and shows a recognition
that their funds come directly from all students'
pockets. MEChA fails on all these counts. At a
time when other groups cut activities to trim
budgets, MEChA added some expensive
events. While other ethnic organizations are
asking for an increase in line with inflation over
the next year, MEChA is requesting almost
$17,000 more without any convincing explana
tion.
The Mind's Eye $14,649
($1.04)
®YES O NO
This quarterly literary magazine is increasing its
fee request so it can raise the number of copies
it prints each quarter from 1,000 to 3,000. Sub
missions are received from both graduate and
undergraduate students, and editors are not
paid. It receives funds from Pub Board and aca
demic departments, but a student special fee
would help offset printing costs, improve distri
bution methods and increase the volume of the
magazine printed.
Project Motivation $12,954
($.93)
(DYES O NO
There are a few reasons for not supporting Pro
Mo, but one very compelling point earns it an
endorsement. Pro Mo runs a high school visita
tion program for about 1,100 to 1,600 Chicano
students in the Bay Area. The program encour
ages students to attend college and works on
improving their self-esteem. However, Pro Mo
should ask the University to fund its Pro Fro
week programs. Pro Mo spends $4,557 on
events during Pro Fro week to encourage
minority enrollment here at Stanford.
Rape Education Project $23,882
($1.70)
O YES (D NO
The Rape Education Project organizes events
like Rape Awareness Week and tries to facili
tate dorm discussions on the subject. It also
distributes a book called Confronting Rape to
all students. Though it's a good cause, REP's
mission overlaps confusingly with other groups
— including the Coalition Against Sexual
Assault, which is also asking for a special fee.
The total money put into raising awareness
about sexual assault issues by this group,
CASA, the University, the Women's Center and
other on-campus counseling services amounts
to a lot, and could be used more efficiently.
REDWOOD $47,300 ($3.37)
WITHOUT RECOMMENDATION
Although REDWOOD offers great outdoor
experiences for both graduate and undergradu
ate students, its $24,760 for various salaries
seems remarkably high. REDWOOD gets rev
enue from the small fees it charges for first-year
and quarterly trips, but as a student-fee funded
group, it could reconsider its distribution of staff
salaries and $8 per hour student employee
wages. REDWOOD commendably recognized
that its public service trips this fall were not very
popular and canceled them.
Sexual Assault $10,286
Legal Advocates ($.73)
(DYES O NO
A new group, SALA is composed of 14 Law
School students who are trained to offer legal
counseling and referrals for campus victims of
sexual assaults. The group wants funding so it
can be independent of related organizations
and services — including the University — to
give victims an unbiased review of their legal
options. SALA intends to work with the Coali
tion Against Sexual Assault and plans to devel
op a referral list of local attorneys. It also hopes
to educate the community on the legal issues
surrounding this subject.
Speakers Bureau $108,194.
($7.72)
®YES O NO
The Speakers' Bureau never fails to bring a
wide range of engaging speakers anyone in the
Stanford community can go to see. They also
try to raise money by charging a small entrance
fee for their non-Stanford audience members.
The Speakers' Bureau is asking for a modest
fee increase and has decreased their operating
budget by about 7 percent.
Stanford Project $6,666.67
On Nutrition ($.47)
(DYES O NO
SPOON efficiently collects and distributes thou
sands of pounds of unused food each year from
campus kitchens and Housing and Dining Ser
vices. Their workers are volunteers, and your
fee goes to support such essentials as freezer
upkeep and plastic bags. While the group could
try to get some items — like twist ties and
labels — donated, overall, the group provides a
great deal of service for a very small amount of
student money.
Stanford American $32,641
Indian Organization ($2.33)
(DYES O NO
SAIO is an excellent example of a group
which raises a lot of its own money and puts
on many successful programs for Native
Americans and the Stanford community at
large. SAIO's annual Powwow brings in
$65,000 and with a little more effort, could be
self-sustaining. SAIO raises money in many
ways, such as selling tacos and T-shirts. The
group has eliminated programs that are no
longer popular and has sought alternate
sources of funds for some projects from
places like the Haas Center for Public Ser
vice. The group's fee request increase is
small, and the main new activity that is being
added is an alternative spring break public
service program. None of SAIO's members
receive salaries.
