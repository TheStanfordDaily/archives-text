Stanford Axe $29,121
Committee ($2.08)
(DYES O NO
In addition to putting on the Big Game bonfire,
the Axe Committee produces a handbook dis
tributed to freshmen and also will maintain the
security of the Axe when it returns to campus.
It is also planning to get involved in sports other
than football.
Stanford Band $61,714 ($4.41)
(I) YES O NO
The Band is a unique group that sets Stanford
out from the crowd. It lost Music Department
funding three years ago, but still receives about
$20,000 each year from the Athletics Depart
ment. Through its performances at home foot
ball and basketball games, its unscheduled
marches around campus, and the opportunity it
offers to all students, the Band has earned its
special fee.
SCBN $44,071 ($3.15)
®YES O NO
Since its creation in 1992, SCBN has worked to
provide the Stanford community with new, inno
vative television programming. The station has
come a long way in attaining its goals. The sta
tion is currently looking to increase its service to
the Stanford community, possibly through tele
vising ASSU Senate and Faculty Senate meet
ings. Most of the special-fee money requested
would go toward new equipment to help the
station get off the ground. The group reaches
out to the community, has a no-frills budget,
and aims to accommodate students. It should
be encouraged to increase underwriting
income.
Stanford Chaparral $9,994
($.71)
(DYES O NO
This year, the Chappie has done a good job
consistently putting out an entertaining humor
magazine and recruiting new staff members. It
needs more money than Pub Board can give it
to ensure two issues per quarter. Ad revenues
for the Chappie are up, and its small fee
request will help it pay its printing costs. It
should look into ways to economize, such as
printing parts of the magazine on less expen
sive paper.
Stanford Concert $61,500
Network ($4.39)
(DYES O NO
The Concert Network has done a good job
recently in bringing big-name musical talent to
campus — including They Might Be Giants,
who are coming to Rinc-A-Delt in May. To keep
down costs, it should investigate other sources
of revenue, including corporate sponsors and
charging students a small amount for tickets.
The Concert Network should also check into
the feasibility of denying subsidized tickets to
students who did not vote for its special fee, as
the Legal Office already does.
Stanford Daily $64,129
($4.58)
NO RECOMMENDATION
Stanford Homelessness $9,423
Action Coalition ($.67)
O YES (D NO
Although homelessness remains a chronic
problem in America, SHAC does not address
the issue in a cost-effective manner. With a
large portion of the fee going to speaker costs,
which a SHAC member said draws between 10
and 20 people per speech, their budget cannot
be considered worthwhile enough for all stu
dents to support. SHAC members should con
sider joining forces with local homelessness
groups instead of having a separate campus
group which holds meetings in Palo Alto.
Stanford in $53,527
Government ($3.82)
DYES O NO
SIG provides a valuable service for students
interested in learning about local and national
government. Staffed by about 50 unpaid stu
dents, SIG brings prominent speakers to cam
pus, helps students find jobs and internships
and offers stipends and fellowships for stu
dents. SIG does a good job fund raising and
should be applauded for pushing the Public
Policy Department to pay for the teaching
assistants in the jointly sponsored Public Policy
197 class.
Stanford Jazz $14,286
Orchestra ($1.02)
O YES (D NO
While a jazz orchestra certainly enhances the
arts scene at Stanford, half of this group's spe
cial fee covers the costs of two festivals that its
approximately 18 members attend. The group
has not projected any fundraising activities to
help subsidize its expenses or lower its special
fee request.
Stanford Journal $16,343
of International Affairs ($1.17)
WITHOUT RECOMMENDATION
This journal provides a wonderful opportunity
for undergraduates and graduate students to
publish their writings on international affairs
alongside the writings of top Stanford scholars.
But it is largely an academic journal and, as
such, should receive some funds from academ
ic departments. It raises some of its own money
through other schools' subscriptions to the jour
nal, but has minimal on-campus circulation.
Stanford Kayak $15,186
Club ($1.08)
O YES ® NO
The Kayak Club teaches kayaking and leads
several whitewater trips each year that anyone
can go on. The group is asking for a one-time
fee this year to purchase rafts. But at a time
when students are feeling the strain of addi-
