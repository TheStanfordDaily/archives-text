AASA $42,020 ($3.00)
WITHOUT RECOMMENDATION
This group performs a myriad of valuable activ
ities for Stanford and the surrounding commu
nity on a budget that has seen only a minimal
increase in recent years. AASA's current bud
get admirably serves a community that repre
sents nearly 25 percent of the undergraduate
and 10 percent of the graduate student body.
However, recognizing the current backlash
against special-fee funding, AASA must also
take some initiative to stay under budget and
help fund itself. It has cut some of its sparsely
attended programs and begun exploring the
possibilities of outside fund raising. But it needs
to lay these out in concrete terms in its budget,
which currently reflects minimal revenue
enhancement, despite its ability this year, for
example, to raise about $1,000 for the A3C at
the winter semi-formal. Perhaps by charging
active members (who reap the most benefits
out of semi-formals and other Asian communi
ty-targeted events), or channeling some profits
from some of its charitable events, such as
benefits for the formerly endangered A3C, back
to itself or starting other similar fundraising
events or activities AASA could lower the fund
ing burden it places on students.
Barrio Assistance $25,803
($1.84)
®YES O NO
This tutoring program has been a boon to pro
moting East Palo Alto youngsters' interest in
academics for years. It has a well-defined goal
and structure and a noble purpose. Denying
this group funding for even one year would
harm its continuity. However, with annual per
pupil costs reaching about $500, the group
should re-evaluate some of its activities and try
to find other resources — perhaps, for exam
ple, some donations of supplies — to help fel
low students shoulder the financial burden.
Black Student Union $42,735
($3.05)
WITHOUT RECOMMENDATION
The BSU puts on a variety of events throughout
the year that benefit the entire community,
including Martin Luther King week, Black Liber
ation month and Malcolm X week. However,
the BSU is currently completely dependent on
special fees for funding; in the future, it should
look into supplemental sources of income other
than the special fee. The group is getting start
ed in this direction; it is considering turning the
Soul Food dinner — which will cost $3,500 next
year — into a fundraiser. The BSU also needs
to encourage graduate students to have a
stronger voice in its group.
Club Sports $164,894
($11.78)
DYES O NO
Although expensive, the Club Sports program
— which used to receive support from the Ath
letics Department — is a worthy cause. It sub
sidizes 18 different non-varsity teams, which
raise an average of two-thirds of their budgets
from sources other than the special fee. This is
one of the few groups that has high graduate
