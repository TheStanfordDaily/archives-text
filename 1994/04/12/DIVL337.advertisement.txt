little to do about it anyway. It's an all
or-nothing situation. Because the edi
torial board recognizes the inherent
inadequacy of the current fee-refund
system, the recommendations reflect
the absolute nature of the process.
In making its recommendations on
ASSU special fee requests, The Daily
editorial board used five guiding crite
ria:
• Whether the group demonstrated ini
tiative in self-funding (that is, whether
its budget reflects that it is actively
seeking revenue sources other than the
special fee)
• Whether the group has tightened its
budget in response to refunds
• Whether the group has made a con
scientious effort to involve members of
the Stanford community
• Whether the group's methods to its
goal are a good value for the dollar
• Whether the student body — and not
the University or other parties —
should be funding the group's mission
If the group in question met these
criteria well, it received a "yes." If it did
not meet the criteria sufficiently, the
group's special fee request was given a
"no." Groups that met some well, but
failed on others, received a "without
recommendation," meaning that The
Daily editorial board could not confi
dently endorse the group either way. A
"no recommendation" signals that the
editorial board did not meet with the
group representative and could not
make an endorsement.
The annual cost per student was
estimated using this year's total
enrollment figure of 14,002. Next
year's total special fee per student is
estimated to be about $45 for each stu
dent, up from about $37 this year. And
that assumes that XXII-A&R-8, the
proposed special fee amendment, does
not pass.
