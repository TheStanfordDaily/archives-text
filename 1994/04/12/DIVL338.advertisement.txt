Coalition Against $55,731
Sexual Assault ($3.98)
WITHOUT RECOMMENDATION
While CASA provides important referral and
outreach programs — and opportunities for stu
dent participation in these programs — it is part
of a large and complicated system of campus
groups which appear to fulfill similar functions.
CASA is part of a confusing network supported
by students, the University and the Women's
Center. Consolidation should be a top priority
for next year, and groups, such as the Rape
Education Project, under the coalition should
not have to request a separate special fee. The
University shows a lack of commitment by fund
ing only the Campus Sexual Assault Response
and Recovery Team — solely a clinical coun
seling service for sexual assault victims — and
one part-time position in Health Promotion Ser
vices at Cowell. It is common knowledge that
sexual assault services must go far beyond
simple counseling, and the University should
not expect students to carry the financial lion's
share of referral and outreach programs.
Coffeehouse Live! $31,236
($2.23)
O YES ® NO
Though it has a gem of an idea — to pay for a
real musical act to play at the Coffeehouse
once a week — this group's special fee repre
sents yet another service that shouldn't be sup
ported by students alone. Bon Appetit, the
owner of the CoHo, would surely profit from this
venture without providing any of the funding.
Members of the Concert Network who are
behind this project should try to work with the
Coffeehouse to split the cost more fairly.
KZSU $120,444 ($8.60)
WITHOUT RECOMMENDATION
KZSU fills the criteria of reaching out to the
entire community in that staff members come
from both the undergraduate and graduate
population. It also does not have a frivolous
budget (most of their money will go toward
replacing old equipment). However, it is gener
ally agreed that KZSU's listenership is very
small outside of sports and a few talk shows.
The overriding reason for the limited number is
due to programming choices. Students are sim
ply not seeing proportional returns to the fee
they pay. KZSU doesn't try to captivate its
Stanford audience; in fact, station members
said their main purpose is to train students in
radio, not cater to most students' musical
tastes. If students are being asked to pay one
of the highest fees on the ballot, KZSU should
better tailor its programming to student prefer
ences.
Legal Counseling $91,108
