Stanford Solar $34,500
Car Project ($2.46)
(DYES O NO
The success of the Solar Car project has
brought a lot of prestige to Stanford, especially
its engineering departments, yet it must still
fund itself because the University has refused
to offer more than minimal assistance. This is
because Stanford does not have departmental
research in these areas. The group tries to fund
as much of its project as possible, raising its
own $26,500 of its $50,650 budget. The project
has a very tight budget, requesting funds
almost solely for supplies and maintenance,
which the group has to pay for because races
prohibit it from accepting donations. The group
also tried this year to include non-techie stu
dents in its project to boost its fundraising
efforts.

Transportation Program ($.52)
(DYES O NO
STOP'S barebones budget shows a strong con
sideration for student funds. In addition to giv
ing rides to about 50 students a week who don't
want to drive under the influence, STOP gener
ously loans its van to other groups, such as
Barrio Assistance and Senior Pub Night. The
drivers are volunteers, and your fee goes to
support basic items like gas, phones, insurance
and van repairs.
Stanford Symphony $7,143
Orchestra ($.51)
WITHOUT RECOMMENDATION
While it is worthwhile to have a student group
on campus promoting music, questions about
the orchestra's budget abound. The proceeds
from their quarterly concerts go directly to the
Music Department, which provides support and
some equipment. However, the advertisements
to promote these University-benefit concerts
are funded through student fees. Revenues
from the concerts should actually go to lower
students' special fees. Their saving grace is
that they do make valiant attempts at fund rais
ing at events like the Viennese Ball and the
Halloween Concert.

Rape Elimination ($5.25)
(DYES O NO
SURE Escort serves a valuable function by pro
viding rides for members of the Stanford com

alone at night. Staff members must make sure
they do not deny male students rides simply
based on gender, as some students have expe

Stanford $5,714
Volunteer Network ($.40)
(DYES O NO
The SVN runs a number of good community
service projects including the Reach Out Today
and the Holiday Sharing Drive. However, it has
the wrong philosophy when it states in the Elec
tion Handbook, "SVN has grown increasingly
less dependent on the Haas Center for its fund
ing of these projects." This is nothing to brag
about at a time when student groups should be
scratching for alternate funding. The Haas Cen
ter trains SVN, and should certainly have a part
in its funding if it will lower the special fee. SVN
should be lauded for actually lowering its fee
request. Maybe the SVN financial director
should be loaned to a few other groups.

retreats for SEAS members, and for college
students from all over California to attend an
environmental conference at Stanford. The
conference costs include $1,800 for attendees'

line asking the conference attendees to pay for
their own meals for the weekend. While SEAS
has several positive programs, including its
newsletter, the Daily Planet, its budget does not
show sufficient effort to decrease significant
and unnecessary costs to the student body.
Women's Center $30,218
($2.15)
(DYES O NO
The Women's Center is a valuable campus
resource, providing support to numerous smaller
groups on campus. They put on some excellent
campus-wide programs, such as Women's Her
story Month. It is a concern that, in times of tight
budgets, the center wants to add another paid
position; however, if the center is indeed being
used more this might be justified. In the future,
the Women's Center should look for innovative
ways to economize: for example, printing the
Women's Guide on less expensive paper or pub

tional and constantly escalating special-fee
requests, they should not be asked to chip in
for a few rafts too. Since the club intends to
loan them out for dorm rafting trips, it should try
to cover its costs through these "rentals." Rent
ing kayaks and rafts to dorms may even make
a good business project.
Stanford Solar $34,500
Car Project ($2.46)
(DYES O NO
The success of the Solar Car project has
brought a lot of prestige to Stanford, especially
its engineering departments, yet it must still
fund itself because the University has refused
to offer more than minimal assistance. This is
because Stanford does not have departmental
research in these areas. The group tries to fund
as much of its project as possible, raising its
own $26,500 of its $50,650 budget. The project
has a very tight budget, requesting funds
almost solely for supplies and maintenance,
which the group has to pay for because races
prohibit it from accepting donations. The group
also tried this year to include non-techie stu
dents in its project to boost its fundraising
efforts.
Stanford Safe $7,286
Transportation Program ($.52)
(DYES O NO
STOP'S barebones budget shows a strong con
sideration for student funds. In addition to giv
ing rides to about 50 students a week who don't
want to drive under the influence, STOP gener
ously loans its van to other groups, such as
Barrio Assistance and Senior Pub Night. The
drivers are volunteers, and your fee goes to
support basic items like gas, phones, insurance
and van repairs.
Stanford Symphony $7,143
Orchestra ($.51)
WITHOUT RECOMMENDATION
While it is worthwhile to have a student group
on campus promoting music, questions about
the orchestra's budget abound. The proceeds
from their quarterly concerts go directly to the
Music Department, which provides support and
some equipment. However, the advertisements
to promote these University-benefit concerts
are funded through student fees. Revenues
from the concerts should actually go to lower
students' special fees. Their saving grace is
that they do make valiant attempts at fund rais
ing at events like the Viennese Ball and the
Halloween Concert.
Stanford United for $73,649
Rape Elimination ($5.25)
(DYES O NO
SURE Escort serves a valuable function by pro
viding rides for members of the Stanford com
munity who do not wish to walk around campus
alone at night. Staff members must make sure
they do not deny male students rides simply
based on gender, as some students have expe
rienced.
Stanford $5,714
Volunteer Network ($.40)
(DYES O NO
The SVN runs a number of good community
service projects including the Reach Out Today
and the Holiday Sharing Drive. However, it has
the wrong philosophy when it states in the Elec
tion Handbook, "SVN has grown increasingly
less dependent on the Haas Center for its fund
ing of these projects." This is nothing to brag
about at a time when student groups should be
scratching for alternate funding. The Haas Cen
ter trains SVN, and should certainly have a part
in its funding if it will lower the special fee. SVN
should be lauded for actually lowering its fee
request. Maybe the SVN financial director
should be loaned to a few other groups.
Students for $15,453
Environmental ($1.10)
Action at Stanford
O YES (DNO
Of the SEAS requested net special fee, about
one-third of it, or $3,544.99, will pay for two
retreats for SEAS members, and for college
students from all over California to attend an
environmental conference at Stanford. The
conference costs include $1,800 for attendees'
food. The projected income from conference
dues is only $1,000. SEAS would not be out of
line asking the conference attendees to pay for
their own meals for the weekend. While SEAS
has several positive programs, including its
newsletter, the Daily Planet, its budget does not
show sufficient effort to decrease significant
and unnecessary costs to the student body.
Women's Center $30,218
($2.15)
(DYES O NO
The Women's Center is a valuable campus
resource, providing support to numerous smaller
groups on campus. They put on some excellent
campus-wide programs, such as Women's Her
story Month. It is a concern that, in times of tight
budgets, the center wants to add another paid
position; however, if the center is indeed being
used more this might be justified. In the future,
the Women's Center should look for innovative
ways to economize: for example, printing the
Women's Guide on less expensive paper or pub
lishing it in the Directory.

Conference
O YES WNO
YCMAD's heyday has come and gone. While this
event drew thousands of people in the 1980s,
recent years have seen esoteric topics and declin
ing attendance. Last year, about 300 people
attended; this year, around 400 came. Only half of
those were students. YCMAD is requesting
$29,170.00 — which amounts to more than $50
per attendee, given recent attendence rates. Stu
dents should no longer support a conference
which has failed to select topics of popular inter
est and failed to eliminate excesses.
