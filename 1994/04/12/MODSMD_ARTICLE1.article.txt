# 'Smattering of courses'
## CUE discusses majors report 
### Burt Herman Editorial staff 
Turning its attention to the area where Stanford
students spend roughly one-third of their academic ca
reers, the Commission on Undergraduate Education
heard a report from the subcommittee on majors at its
weekly meeting yesterday.
By examining majors that the subcommittee
deemed successful — including Industrial Engineer
ing, Public Policy, Human Biology and Biology — the
report identified standards which all majors should
strive to follow, said commission member and gradu
ate student David Lowell.
According to the report, majors should be more co
herent and have progression, as opposed to containing
a "smattering of courses," Lowell said.
The report also called for a heightened sense of fac
ulty responsibility in undergraduate teaching, as well
as more non-lecture courses to encourage participato
ry learning.
Other features of a strong major include a senior
thesis or project, a system of feedback within the de
partment and better advising within the major, Low
ell said.
The commission also discussed the fact that the
only majors currently subject to Faculty Senate re
view are interdepartmental programs, said History
Prof. James Sheehan, the commission's chair. The
commission hopes to "erase the distinctions" and
bring all majors under the auspices of a regular evalu
ation, Sheehan said.
According to Sheehan, the subcommittee's report
was well received and will go into
the final commission report with
few changes.
Commission members also
briefly turned their discussion to
the report of the subcommittee on
breadth requirements, which was
submitted last week. The commis
sion has almost settled on recom
mending a three-quarter sequence
of courses to satisfy the natural
sciences distribution requirement,
Lowell said.
However, the commission is
debating whether to offer a similar
sequence of courses to satisfy
humanities and social sciences
requirements.
The current option under dis
cussion is a requirement of two
classes from each discipline, which
might be grouped into subject
areas. These courses will not nec
essarily be given in sequence, Low
ell said.
In an effort to ensure that its
recommendations are adopted,

the commission again discussed
the creation of an administrative
post that will be responsible for
undergraduate education, Shee
han said.
Currently, the responsibility
for undergraduate education is
spread across several administra
tors, including the Provost and
Deans' offices, Ijowell said.
Who does a parent go to if they
are unhappy with their child's
education?" Lowell said. "There
really isn't any one person."
The new administrative post
would report directly to the
provost on matters pertaining to
undergraduate education, Lowell
said.
In order to ensure that the new
position would have enough power
to implement its responsibilities,
Lowell said the commission might
recommend that the administra
tor also be given control over
money for teaching assistants and
faculty billets.
The commission will finish
hearing subcommittee reports by
the end of the quarter and hopes
to issue its final report by the Oct.
1 due date, Sheehan said.
