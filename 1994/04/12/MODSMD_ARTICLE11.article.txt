Economics Prof. Victor Fuchs, a member of the
University's Department of Health Research and
Policy, addressed aspects of the American health
care crisis yesterday, proposing reforms ranging
from cost containment strategies to instituting
physicians as leaders in health care reform
In a discussion at the Medical School's Munzer
Auditorium, Fuchs said, "it is unfortunate that so
much policy debate is focused either on government
mandates or market incentives." He suggested dis
cussing integrative systems such as families, reli
gious communities and relationships between
patient and physician to find solutions.
Fuchs also said that the escalating severity of the
nation's health care dilemma calls for an effort to
apply research to practical strategies of reform.
Of the current controversy's most prominent con
cerns — the uninsured and the rising cost of care —
Fuchs said he considered the cost problem to be "by
far the most important." He pointed out that health
care not only comprises 14 percent of our nation's
gross domestic product, but also grows annually 3
percent faster than the rest of the economy.
Fuchs also discussed the question of universal
health care coverage. Approaching the issue requires

the consideration of several complex questions —
such as various methods of taxation and how to
divide payment and coverage between the upper and
lower ends of the economic spectrum, he said.
Fuchs proposed a "quasi-egalitarian" approach to
national health insurance that would allow those
with higher incomes to pay for health care of higher
quality than that which is offered to the majority of
middle- and lower-class Americans.
In addition, he noted the possibility of reducing
expenditures by cutting back on administrative
costs and using resources more efficiently.
Identifying technology as the driving force behind
the rising cost of health care, Fuchs suggested that
the nation "tame, but not destroy technological
change in medicine." He proposed the creation of a
large national center for technological assessment to
research and determine the cost-effectiveness of var
ious policies.
Such a center, according to Fuchs, would be the
"backbone" of health care policy research and would
allow doctors to focus more professional attention
on providing care for their patients.
Fuchs went on to stress the need to "disengage
health insurance from employment," highlighting
problems like job mobility as negative outgrowths of
a system that relies too heavily on government sub
sidies.
