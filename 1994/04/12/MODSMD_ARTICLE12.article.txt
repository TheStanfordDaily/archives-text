## U.S. planes bomb persistent Serbs

SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina
(AF) â€” U.S. bombs destroyed a tank and
struck several personnel carriers outside
the besieged Muslim enclave of Gorazde
yesterday in NATO's second air strike on
Bosnian Serb positions in two days.
After two F-18 warplanes based in
Aviano, Italy, ended their bombing mis
sion, the Serbs responded with renewed
fury, firing a barrage of artillery shells on
Muslims holed up in the battered town
35 miles southeast of Sarajevo. Later, the
Serb attacks were reported to have
stopped.
But Bosnian Serb leader Radovan
Karadzic indicated yesterday that if air
strikes continue, the Serbs could "shoot
down planes." The Serbs have denied
assaulting the town.
Following Serb refusals to stop
assaulting Gorazde, NATO began attack

ing Serb positions Sunday around the
town, one of six designated U.N. "safe
areas" for Bosnian Muslims.
The strikes were called officially to
protect U.N. personnel in the enclave,
although they seem aimed more at halt
ing an assault that has left an estimated
156 people dead and 646 wounded in the
past 12 days.
The morning after NATO struck Sun
day, aid workers reported heavy shelling
and many wounded, UNHCR spokesman
Ron Redmond said in Geneva.
U.N. officials quoted reports from
Gorazde as saying that 200 refugees
were wounded yesterday morning in a
single artillery attack on a former
schoolhouse.
Later in the day, NATO planes struck
again, hitting several Serbian tanks and
armored personnel carriers, a senior

Pentagon official said. The United
Nations said three bombs were dropped,
destroying a tank that was "firing direct
ly into the town."
Olivier van Bunnen, a representative
of Doctors Without Borders in Gorazde,
and Gorazde official Esad Ohranovic said
Serb attacks intensified after the NATO
air raid.
"The city is literally burning," said
Ohranovic.
Lyndall Sachs, a spokeswoman for the
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in
Belgrade, reported "indiscriminate
shelling" of Gorazde. She said a shell
landed close to UNHCR offices in
Gorazde, blowing out all the windows.
There were no casualties.
The Serb fire later decreased, then
stopped around 8 p.m. (2 p.m. EDT), van
Bunnen said.
