Cancer vaccine?
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Research
ers using the diseased cells of melanoma
patients have developed a vaccine that
they say dramatically reduces the recur
rence of the deadliest form of skin cancer.
The method also could be used to devel
op vaccines for other forms of cancer.
Dr. David Berd of Thomas Jefferson
University in Philadelphia said his team
treated the patients with a vaccine made
from their own cancer cells and another
chemical to stimulate the immune sys
tem.
After three years, 70 percent of
those vaccinated remained cancer-free,
compared with 20 percent in patients
treated with surgery alone, Berd told
the American Association of Cancer

Research yesterday.
Rwanda war continues
BUTARE, Rwanda (AF) — Chaos,
despair and blood flowed through this
small African country for a fifth day yes
terday. The air was heavy with the
stench from thousands of corpses and
from the smoke of villages burned by
marauders.
Hundreds of foreigners have fled since
the ethnic-based violence gripped Rwan
da.
In Butare, Rwanda's second-largest
city, refugees from the countryside
told of gangs of men roaming the coun
tryside, setting fire to villages and
hacking the residents to death with
machetes.
