# Clintons paid too little in taxes
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
Clintons failed to report $6,498
in income that Mrs. Clinton made
in commodities trading in 1980,
the White House disclosed yester
day. They wrote checks totaling
$14,615 in back taxes and inter
est to cover what the White
House called an oversight.
The checks were written to the
U.S. Treasury and to the state of
Arkansas.
"The Clintons do not know
how the error occurred but accept
responsibility for it,"the Clin
tons' personal attorney, David
Kendall, said in a statement.
The income is in addition to a
nearly $100,000 gain that the
White House previously reported
Mrs. Clinton made in 1979-1980
in commodities trading.
The White House has said
Mrs. Clinton made the money
after staking $1,000 of her own
money on risky cattle futures.
New documents made avail
able by the White House on yes
terday showed Mrs. Clinton put
up $5,000 of her own money in a
second trading account in Octo
ber 1979.

A review of the records showed
"that a short term capital gain of
$6,498 from 1980 commodities
trading was not reported,"
Kendall said. "The federal tax on
this gain would have been $3,315;
the state tax would have been
$514. The Clintons are today pay
ing these taxes plus accrued
interest."
In addition to the check for the
back federal taxes, Kendall said
the Clintons paid $10,134 in fed
eral interest. They paid Arkansas
$652 for back interest, he said.
The Clintons did not pay any
penalties on the amounts.
A source close to the Clinton's
tax situation, made available by
the White House to reporters,
said penalties were not paid
because the failure to pay the
taxes was an oversight — and not
willful.
The Clintons came voluntari
ly, he said. He noted that the
statute of limitations on back
taxes is three years — five years if
the IRS suspects criminal wrong
doing.
The source said the accounts
on Mrs. Clinton's trading "are

confusing. We don't know how it
happened."
The White House also dis
closed that the Clintons were
audited by the Internal Revenue
Service in 1980 with respect to
their 1979 taxes and not required
to pay back taxes.
Kendall, in his statement, said
the taxes on the previously unre
ported capital gain of $6,498 in
1980 were slightly offset by an $80
loss from commodities trading
that was not reported that year.
The existence of a second trad
ing account for Mrs. Clinton,
with the brokerage firm of
Stephens Inc., had been previous
ly reported. Earlier, it was said
that she put up $5,000 of her own
money and closed the account
after losing about $1,000.
The earlier statement "is inop
erative," a senior administration,
speaking on the condition of
anonymity, said yesterday.
Actually, the new document
revealed, Mrs. Clinton opened the
account in 1978, put $5,000 into
it in October 1979, and closed it
in May 1980, withdrawing
$10,489.
