## Editorial COP: slim pickings 
### 
ONE IS idealistic. One is
downright dangerous. Both
are naive and neither is suit
ably prepared. As candidates for
the Council of Presidents, neither
"Students' Voice" nor "The Team
sters" has the qualifications need
ed to rescue the ASSU's ailing rep
utation or to salvage some vestige
of responsive and accountable stu
dent government at Stanford.
But "Students' Voice" is at least
serious.
In contrast, "The Teamsters,"
sponsored by the Chaparral, promis
es a floating casino on Lake Lagunita
to raise funds for a minimum Uni
versity wage of $20 per hour.
The members of this slate —
Tony Sirna, Doug Miro, Pete Marks
and Scott Gagner — are occasional
ly funny, but they seem to ignore
the fact that Lake Lag exists only
with high rainfall. How do they pro
pose to fund their exorbitant pro
grams with such an unpredictable
income source?
Besides, Gagner was "assassinat
ed" in last night's debate, and
sophomore Shaun Cram, the new
fourth member selected from the
audience by "randomocracy" is a
complete political unknown.
The four members of the People's
Platform slate, "Students' Voice,"
Vanessa Alvarado, Anietie Ekanem,
Lisa Lee and Mork Murdock, are
convincing: they want make the
ASSU more responsive to student
concerns. But they lack concrete
plans and an understanding of how
to turn the ASSU around.
As members of the Student of
Color Coalition, they hope to main
tain support for ethnic centers. But
a COP that only supports powerful
interests will be worthless. The
COP has a responsibility to fight
just as hard for the interests that
can't form organized student sup
port, like the need to improve Hous
ing and Dining Service, Residential
Education, Tresidder, graduate
housing and the libraries. The slate
must develop detailed plans of how
it would represent these interests if
it is to gain support from students
and be taken seriously by members

of the administration.
Alvarado, Ekanem and Murdock
— ASSU senators this year — cor
rectly point out that the COP must
provide strong leadership in the sen
ate, and that the current COP's lack
of involvement weakens its influence
in the Provost's office and beyond.
The slate recognizes the main
problem with the senate — that
senators are completely anonymous
and therefore unaccountable, but
they oppose increasing accountabil
ity by electing undergraduate sena
tors from residential and class dis
tricts. Instead, "Students' Voice"
offers its only concrete proposal:
They want to resurrect the failed
dorm representative system, and
add an additional level of bureaucra
cy with regional meetings which will
"gather information" from dorm
reps and pass this on to senators.
The slate has not studied the rea
sons the dorm reps program fell
apart two years ago, but acknowl
edges that being a dorm rep may be
seen as a "grunge job" that few stu
dents will want to participate in.
As well, the dorm reps program
was famous for leaving out graduate
students. The slate should under
stand the COP has to represent the
entire student body, and should
make plans that take graduate
interests into account.
"Students' Voice" has, at one
time or another, mentioned other
issues: student opposition to bring
ing back the "F" grade, post office
lines, universal ID cards and getting
a COP member on the University
cabinet. More often than not, how
ever, these ideas seem to lack any
concrete plan of action. If elected,
the slate needs to sit down and seri
ously iron out its agenda for next
year and the ways to complete it.
The ASSU needs an influential
COP to focus the senate on impor
tant student services, design an
overhaul of the special fee process
and make the student government
accountable to students. Unfortu
nately, it appears neither slate is
prepared enough to accomplish this.
But it would be nice to be proved
wrong.
