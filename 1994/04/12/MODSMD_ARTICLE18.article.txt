## In defense of segregation 
### 
CONTROVERSY RAGED last
spring over a small class most stu
dents had probably never heard of
before.
The class in self-defense for women
began as a part of the Stanford Workshops
on Political Issues (SWOPSI 174 A), and
was subsequently taken up by the Femi
nist Studies Department. Issues in Self
defense for Women was taught during the
1992-93 academic year for three units,
pass/no credit. The class was extremely
popular, with many more students inter
ested than the 36-person class could
accommodate. This fall, the class was cut.
It was alleged to be in violation of Title IX,
the 1972 regulation prohibiting sex segre
gation in schools that receive federal fund
ing. And that was the last we heard of it.
There are a number of disturbing facts
about the elimination of the class from
Stanford's curriculum. According to a
pamphlet distributed by Women Defend
ing Ourselves, a collective working in
self-defense education throughout the
Bay Area, Stanford declined the U.S.
Department of Education's offer of an
official investigation of the complaint
filed against the class. The charge was
based on the premise that the University
offered "two sex-segregated classes that
were not equivalent." The men's section
of the class included assertiveness train
ing, readings and discussion but lacked
the physical self-defense component of
the women's section.
Why would the University decline the

Department of Education's investiga
tion? Only then would it know whether
the class itself was truly in violation of
Title IX, or whether, as the instructors of
the course believe, it was "in compliance
with the spirit of Title IX, which was
enacted to ensure that women receive
equal treatment in education."
The University opted to change the
format of the class so that its compliance
with the law was no longer in question.
Women Defending Ourselves was given
two choices: either offering one co-ed
comprehensive class or teaching a single
sex physical self-defense course.
Neither of these options was satisfac
tory to the group. The component of the
class which teaches the physical self
defense techniques in a co-ed group
might inhibit each gender's participation.
But offering two single-sex classes which
only teach self-defense would not fully
achieve the goals of the course.
According to the Women's Needs
Assessment report, "Women who have
completed this class report that they
have a much stronger sense of self
empowerment, personal strength, and
self-defense. Many of these women were
able to make further connections
between [the class andl their ability to
participate in classes with more
assertiveness and self-advocacy."
What is wrong with having two single
sex classes, each of which addressed the
same issues — assertiveness, sexuality,
body image, self-defense and other rele

vant issues? Are these issues not relevant
to men's experiences?
It's a tough call to balance targeting
empowerment and safety concerns as
women's issues, as well as problems with
in the context of the greater Stanford
community. The statistics on Stanford
women's self-confidence and safety con
cerns could be quoted ad nauseam, and
could still be dismissed as easily manipu
lated. However, campus realities are
more difficult to ignore. The campus is
poorly lit, the SURE Escort service is lim
ited and there are few campus phones —
and no emergency phones which auto
matically connect callers to police.
The formal complaint of non-compliance
with Title IX was filed in August of 1993.
Women Defending Ourselves is currently in
the process of compiling a legal defense of
the class, composed of legal briefs, sociologi
cal and psychological studies and letters of
student support. The statute of limitations
on the appeal runs out one year after the
original complaint was filed. That gives our
campus four months to turn the tide of
silence that has swept over this issue for the
past eight. Don't let this issue get buried
without a fight.

The Daily hopes the class returns because
Liz needs more assertiueness training.
