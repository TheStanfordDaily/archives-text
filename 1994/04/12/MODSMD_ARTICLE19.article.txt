I'm not like them
But I can pretend
The sun is gone
But I have a light
The day is done
But I'm having fun
I think I'm dumb
Or maybe just happy
— "Dumb." Lyrics by Kurt Cobain. Music
by Nirvana
I have to fill this space.
CAN YOU FIND RWANDA on a
map? Which U.S. organization
funds the majority of research into
the racial superiority of whites? Do you
know what is the capital of Burundi? Who
is the aggressor in the former Yugoslavia?
That's not hip enough. Let me start
over.
Last Friday Kurt Cobain, the 27-year
old lead singer of the Seattle grunge band
Nirvana was found dead in his home.
Apparently, he took a shotgun, placed it in
his mouth and pulled the trigger. He is
survived by his wife, singer Courtney
Love, and his 19-month old daughter,
Frances Bean.
Insert the appropriate Hemingway,
Monroe or Plath reference.
Only a few weeks earlier, Cobain sur
vived an overdose of heroin and pills in
Rome. This had forced Nirvana to post
pone its European tour dates and pull out
of this summer's Lollapalooza tour.
Insert the appropriate Hendrix, Morri
son or Joplin reference.
Given Cobain's enormous, ever-grow
ing fame and his public problems with
drugs, the police and wife Courtney, his
suicide was bound to attract national
attention. The New York Times ran his
obituary off the front page of its Saturday

paper, then followed it up two days later.
Is this column going to be any different
from those "I'm a music /pop culture critic
who doesn't really have anything to say
but feels like he should pieces'?"
Newsweek went one better: it pulled its
cover story, scared up a black-and-white
photo of an angst-ridden Cobain, slapped
the headline "Suicide: Why Do People Kill
Themselves?" on top of it. Time magazine
couldn't match that, but they tantalized us
with a banner headline "Kurt Cobain:
Legacy of a Punk Poet" on a gun-filled
cover. Rolling Stone, Entertainment Week
ly, Spin and People covers are sure to follow
— can GQ and Esquire be far behind?
Corporate magazines still suck, but how
about college papers ?
Apart from the grieving fans in Seattle,
most newspapers portrayed people as not
only indifferent to the news of Cobain's
death, but downright hostile. What an
idiot, said one "fan." I think he's stupid,
says another. The media runs with these
few quotes and blows them up as repre
sentative of bored, alienated, Generation
X-slacker-reality bitten misfits who don't
give a fuck that someone is dead.
I could make a movie about this. Ralph
Fiennes as Kurt, Gary Old man and Tim
Roth as bassist and drummer and Patricia
Arquette as Courtney.
But the media care as much about
Cobain as they do our generation: zero. We
exist to be sold to, and Cobain's suicide is
just another product they're pushing into
our greedy little minds.
Scratch that. Tom Cruise as Kurt, Keanu
Reeves and Charlie Sheen as the other two
and Julia Roberts as Courtney. It'll make
millions. Academy Awards all around.
He gets a framed picture and a closed
casket. We get at least a week's worth of
"Hard Copy" and "A Current Affair" — or

these days, its §ister publications "Prime
time Live" and "Dateline NBC." We can
wait for comedians to create Kurt Cobain
jokes, or make up our own. We can specu
late endlessly on how and why and then
blame Cobain for being an idiot so that we
can feel better.
You won't find any answers here.
Michael Jackson and a 13-year-old kid.
Tonya Harding, Nancy Kerrigan and a lead
pipe. Lorena Bobbitt, John Wayne Bobbitt,
a kitchen knife and a severed penis. Erik
Menendez, Lyle Menendez, two dead par
ents, a mistrial and a retrial. Bill Clinton,
Hillary Clinton, a failed land deal, one dead
White House counsel, two Arkansas troop
ers, and half the women in Arkansas.
This column is not about Kurt Cobain.
They suffer for our sins. Every time we
watch them squirm on television or read
another sordid detail from their sordid
lives, our glee masks our own flaws. It's
far more interesting to speculate about the
scandals of the rich and infamous than
Bosnia or Burundi or budget deficits or
our own Bank of America bills.
This column is about me.
This cruel world pushes all of us closer
to the edge with every passing day, but few
of us can find compassion for each other.
He spray-painted a car? Cane him 'til he
bleeds. She had a bag of coke on the front
seat? Third strike, she's outta here. He
killed someone? Let's kill him back, that'll
teach him.
Oh, he blew his head off? Too bad for
him, eh?
This column is just one in a long line of
pieces that will take one man's tragedy
and turn it into an allusive, alliteration
filled, destructive attempt at caustic self
reflection. It will fail and it will be forgot
ten.
What has happened to empathy? How

many of us can say that we've ever
reached a point that ending our lives
seems like the only logical choice? I can't.
So until I fall to those depths, I'm not
going to judge someone who has.
How thick is the line that separates me
from him?
Because for all of his angry lyrics and
alienating guitar riffs, Cobain genuinely
cared about his fellow humans. Rather
than immediately jump on a sell-out tour,
as befitting a multi-platinum artist, he
played shows to benefit victims in war
torn Bosnia.
What have we done ? What are we going
to do?
He called two men who raped a woman
while singing one of his songs "two wastes
of sperm and eggs." And in the liner notes
to the album "Incesticide," he wrote to his
fans: "If any of you in any way hate homo
sexuals, people of different color, or
women, please do this one favor for us —
leave us the fuck alone." This is not a per
son who — as the mindless critics who
wish his life would correspond precisely to
the lyrics from "Smells Like Teen Spirit"
— ever said, "Oh well, whatever, never
mind" to the world around him.
Can we say the same?
But Cobain won't have much longer to
turn in his grave. Once we suck the last
drop of "news" from his corpse, we'll find
another scandal to anesthetize ourselves
from reality. And it doesn't matter
whether it's bloodshed in Burundi or
blood shed from Michael Fay's buttocks. It
just has to be new.
Here we are now, entertain us.

lives, our glee masks our own flaws. It's
far more interesting to speculate about the
scandals of the rich and infamous than

This column is about me.
This cruel world pushes all of us closer
to the edge with every passing day, but few
of us can find compassion for each other.
He spray-painted a car? Cane him 'til he
bleeds. She had a bag of coke on the front
seat? Third strike, she's outta here. He
killed someone? Let's kill him back, that'll
teach him.
Oh, he blew his head off? Too bad for
him, eh?
This column is just one in a long line of
pieces that will take one man's tragedy
and turn it into an allusive, alliteration
filled, destructive attempt at caustic self
reflection. It will fail and it will be forgot
ten.
What has happened to empathy? How

many of us can say that we've ever
reached a point that ending our lives
seems like the only logical choice? I can't.
So until I fall to those depths, I'm not
going to judge someone who has.
How thick is the line that separates me
from him?
Because for all of his angry lyrics and
alienating guitar riffs, Cobain genuinely
cared about his fellow humans. Rather
than immediately jump on a sell-out tour,
as befitting a multi-platinum artist, he
played shows to benefit victims in war
torn Bosnia.
What have we done ? What are we going
to do?
He called two men who raped a woman
while singing one of his songs "two wastes
of sperm and eggs." And in the liner notes
to the album "Incesticide," he wrote to his
fans: "If any of you in any way hate homo
sexuals, people of different color, or
women, please do this one favor for us —
leave us the fuck alone." This is not a per
son who — as the mindless critics who
wish his life would correspond precisely to
the lyrics from "Smells Like Teen Spirit"
— ever said, "Oh well, whatever, never
mind" to the world around him.
Can we say the same?
But Cobain won't have much longer to
turn in his grave. Once we suck the last
drop of "news" from his corpse, we'll find
another scandal to anesthetize ourselves
from reality. And it doesn't matter
whether it's bloodshed in Burundi or
blood shed from Michael Fay's buttocks. It
just has to be new.
Here we are now, entertain us.

I'm not like them
But I can pretend
The sun is gone
But I have a light
The day is done
But I'm having fun
I think I'm dumb
Or maybe just happy
— "Dumb." Lyrics by Kurt Cobain. Music
by Nirvana
I have to fill this space.
CAN YOU FIND RWANDA on a
map? Which U.S. organization
funds the majority of research into
the racial superiority of whites? Do you
know what is the capital of Burundi? Who
is the aggressor in the former Yugoslavia?
That's not hip enough. Let me start
over.
Last Friday Kurt Cobain, the 27-year
old lead singer of the Seattle grunge band
Nirvana was found dead in his home.
Apparently, he took a shotgun, placed it in
his mouth and pulled the trigger. He is
survived by his wife, singer Courtney
Love, and his 19-month old daughter,
Frances Bean.
Insert the appropriate Hemingway,
Monroe or Plath reference.
Only a few weeks earlier, Cobain sur
vived an overdose of heroin and pills in
Rome. This had forced Nirvana to post
pone its European tour dates and pull out
of this summer's Lollapalooza tour.
Insert the appropriate Hendrix, Morri
son or Joplin reference.
Given Cobain's enormous, ever-grow
ing fame and his public problems with
drugs, the police and wife Courtney, his
suicide was bound to attract national
attention. The New York Times ran his
obituary off the front page of its Saturday

paper, then followed it up two days later.
Is this column going to be any different
from those "I'm a music /pop culture critic
who doesn't really have anything to say
but feels like he should pieces'?"
Newsweek went one better: it pulled its
cover story, scared up a black-and-white
photo of an angst-ridden Cobain, slapped
the headline "Suicide: Why Do People Kill
Themselves?" on top of it. Time magazine
couldn't match that, but they tantalized us
with a banner headline "Kurt Cobain:
Legacy of a Punk Poet" on a gun-filled
cover. Rolling Stone, Entertainment Week
ly, Spin and People covers are sure to follow
— can GQ and Esquire be far behind?
Corporate magazines still suck, but how
about college papers ?
Apart from the grieving fans in Seattle,
most newspapers portrayed people as not
only indifferent to the news of Cobain's
death, but downright hostile. What an
idiot, said one "fan." I think he's stupid,
says another. The media runs with these
few quotes and blows them up as repre
sentative of bored, alienated, Generation
X-slacker-reality bitten misfits who don't
give a fuck that someone is dead.
I could make a movie about this. Ralph
Fiennes as Kurt, Gary Old man and Tim
Roth as bassist and drummer and Patricia
Arquette as Courtney.
But the media care as much about
Cobain as they do our generation: zero. We
exist to be sold to, and Cobain's suicide is
just another product they're pushing into
our greedy little minds.
Scratch that. Tom Cruise as Kurt, Keanu
Reeves and Charlie Sheen as the other two
and Julia Roberts as Courtney. It'll make
millions. Academy Awards all around.
He gets a framed picture and a closed
casket. We get at least a week's worth of
"Hard Copy" and "A Current Affair" — or

these days, its §ister publications "Prime
time Live" and "Dateline NBC." We can
wait for comedians to create Kurt Cobain
jokes, or make up our own. We can specu
late endlessly on how and why and then
blame Cobain for being an idiot so that we
can feel better.
You won't find any answers here.
Michael Jackson and a 13-year-old kid.
Tonya Harding, Nancy Kerrigan and a lead
pipe. Lorena Bobbitt, John Wayne Bobbitt,
a kitchen knife and a severed penis. Erik
Menendez, Lyle Menendez, two dead par
ents, a mistrial and a retrial. Bill Clinton,
Hillary Clinton, a failed land deal, one dead
White House counsel, two Arkansas troop
ers, and half the women in Arkansas.
This column is not about Kurt Cobain.
They suffer for our sins. Every time we
watch them squirm on television or read
another sordid detail from their sordid
lives, our glee masks our own flaws. It's
far more interesting to speculate about the
scandals of the rich and infamous than
Bosnia or Burundi or budget deficits or
