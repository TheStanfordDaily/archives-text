Breaking records and expectations both in and out
of academics seems to be the trend among this year's
eight winners for the Dean's Award for Academic
Achievement.
The award, which is in its sixth year, recognizes un
dergraduates for their intellectual achievements. Out
standing students from disciplines all over the Univer
sity were recommended by faculty and staff to receive
the awards, which were presented last Tuesday.
Gavin Polhemus, a physics major, is graduating in
three years with honors — a feat never before ac
complished by a Stanford physics student.
Polhemus' thesis topic, "The Application of String
Theopr to the Quantum Mechanics of Black Holes,"
Physics Prof. Douglas OsherofT said, is "for under
graduates, beyond my wildest dreams. We expect him
to become a first-rate theorist."
A senior majoring in African and Afro-American
Studies, Kwame Anku was recognized for his extraor
dinary achievements in music and drama. He com
posed the music for the convocation of University
President Gerhard Casper, and has recorded a com
pact disc of original compositions.
Anku was also the co-founder of the Institute NHI,
an intellectual organization formed to fight the scape
goating of African-Americans as the source of social
problems.
Senior David Andre is completing majors with
honors in both symbolic systems and psychology. Psy
chology Prof. Ellen Markman, described his honors
thesis in her department as "an
alternative explanation for a very
prominent theory."
Computer Science Prof. Nils
Nilsson added that Andre
"impresses everyone he meets. I
felt he was doing work way beyond
what undergraduates do."
Mimi Kao, who is majoring in
both human biology and East
Asian studies, was honored for her
original research, the results of
which will be published. Her work
— which measures the stress lev
els in fish — poses significant
questions about the relationship
between stress and reproduction.
Chris Shaw, a mechanical engi
neering major, has been actively
involved as the leader of the Stan
ford Solar Car Project for the past
three years. "Chris has been the
top academic achiever in the .. .
department this year and last
year," Mechanical Engineering

Prof. James Johnston said.
Human biology major Albert-
Liu was honored for both his hon
ors research on the regulation of
neurons in vitro, as well as his
accomplishment as a violinist.
"I felt really flattered and
shocked that these professors
nominated me," Liu said.
The only thing that prevented
Steven Lin from triple majoring
was the absence of an undergradu
ate statistics major at Stanford. As
a math and economics major, he
was the only undergraduate in
Statistics 218, yet he still managed
to be at the top of the class.
Kira Weissman, a chemistry
major, helped to discover a
molecule that has potential appli
cations in photodynamic therapy,
an experimental form of cancer
treatment. Her results are expect
ed to be published this spring.
Weissman consistently topped
the most difficult and competitive
courses in the chemistry curricu
lum and served as a teaching assis
tant in organic chemistry last
quarter.
