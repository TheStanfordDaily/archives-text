## Forthright Sey finds creative outlet in gymnastics Senior tri-captain overcomes back injury, heads to NCAAs 
### Sam Wu Staff writer 
Senior tri-captain Chris Sey has found
many more parallels in his gymnastics
career than just on the bars.
Indeed, over the years, the Cardinal
veteran has discovered recurring trends
in his gymnastics fortunes, similarities
between his sister's experiences and his
own and connections between his sport
and his very personality.
The road to discovery began for Sey at
the age of 13 in Allentown, Pa., where he
first started to pursue his sport at a high
ly competitive level. By age 15, he had
developed into a regular at the Junior
National Championships.
However, satisfaction eluded Sey for
the majority of his high school career. In
fact, success did not come for Sey until his
senior year in high school, when he made
the Junior National Team — right in time
for the college recruitment season.
"The brief success of senior year
opened up so many doors for me," Sey
said. "[Fellow seniors] Jason Cohen and
Mark Booth always had plenty of success.
To suddenly be at the same recruiting
level was a nice stroke of luck."
Excited by the prospects of joining
1992 Olympic team member and person
al role model Jair Lynch at Stanford, Sey
opted in his senior summer to train at the
Olympic Training Center in Colorado
Springs, Colo.
As Sey phrased it, he worked out long
and hard so as not to make a "mockery"
of himself at Stanford. Mockery or not,
however, Sey's first collegiate season did
not proceed as he had hoped.
The 1991-1992 Cardinal qualified for
the NCAA Championships by placing
first in the NCAA Western Regionals.
Unfortunately for Stanford, however,
Booth broke his foot at NCAAs. This sent
a less-experienced Sey into the Cardinal
lineup.

"We ended up fifth," Sey recalled. "I
did atrociously all around — I played a big
role in our finish."
To Sey's chagrin, more misfortunes
would follow.
The summer after his freshman year,
he returned to Colorado to train for Unit
ed States Gymnastics Federation compe
titions. His preparations came to a close
abruptly, however, after a missed triple
back dismount off the high bar resulted
in a fractured fifth thoracic vertebrate.
Sey made a comeback his sophomore
season as a consistent contributor in
three to four events, but injured himself
again at the beginning of his junior year.
He had again taken an awkward spill in
Colorado, this time fracturing his sixth
thoracic vertebrate.
"I became very frustrated with the
sport," Sey said. "It took me five months
of rehab to get two or three events ready
in time for [the conference champi
onships]."
However, what appeared to be a con
tinuing physical and psychological tor
ment turned into a rebirth of Chris Sey.
During last year's Western Regionals,
Booth would once again limp to the side
lines with a ruptured Achilles tendon.
Although he had not competed the entire
season due to his own injuries, Sey
responded triumphantly — not during
Regionals, but at the NCAA Champi
onships.
"In the week and a half between
Regionals and NCAAs, I had to get all my
routines ready," Sey said. "Nationals was
the first meet of the year for me. My par
allel bar routine was made up on the day
of Nationals."
Nonetheless, five of Sey's six routines
counted towards Stanford's overall score
during the first day of competition. In the
finals the next day, four of Sey's events
contributed to a back-to-back national
title for the Cardinal.
"Chris was the key factor," said head

coach Sadao Hamada. "He was fantas
tic."
It was then that the parallels in Sey's
life came together.
Sey began to identify strongly with his
older sister Jennifer, a former gymnast
herself. Indeed, Jennifer was a "top level
elite" who competed in the 1985 World
Championships. During that meet, she
broke her femur, and many had declared
an end to her career.
But Jennifer would return in 1986 to
capture the U.S. Championships.
"We both had really tragic injuries at
career heights," Sey said. "And we both
came back. Junior year was a great matu
ration process. I was really proud of
myself. I couldn't have asked for a better
experience."
Sey's brush with career-ending
injuries also turned his attention to what
he valued in and outside gymnastics.
"The most important thing to me
about gymnastics is expressing myself in
the sport," Sey said. "Part of the reason
why I love gymnastics is that it's the most
creative sport there is. After my injuries, I
started thinking about other important
things in my life. I wanted to start devot
ing myself to different kinds of creativity."
As a matter of fact, last summer,
rather than continue with training, Sey
researched the economic development of
Native American artists. In his spare
time, he reads a wide variety of books and
writes fiction.
Fortunately for the Cardinal, the final
parallel found in Sey's gymnastics career
involves success in the sport. Just as
senior year in high school made a critical
difference in Sey's ascent to collegiate
competition, during his senior year in col
lege, Sey is contributing both the athletic
talent and leadership skills that may
result in a third consecutive national
title.
