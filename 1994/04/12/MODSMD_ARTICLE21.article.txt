# Linksters swing for second in Invite

The demon is gone. It fought
furiously to maintain its grip upon
the victim, but in the end the pow
ers of good managed to vanquish
the foul creature.
It may sound like a scene from
"The Exorcist," but it also describes
the performance of the Stanford
women's golf team. The fifth
ranked Cardinal put the past
behind it and captured second place
this past weekend at the Ping/Ari
zona State University Women's
Golf Invitational at Karsten Golf
Course in Tempe, Ariz.

The squad faced two difficult
challenges. The more obvious of the
two was women's college golfs ver
sion of a Murderers' Row — No. 1
Arizona State, No. 2 San Jose State,
No. 3 UCLA and No. 4 USC. It also
had to deal with its own feelings of
inadequacy — Stanford had not
fared well against this intimidating
group so far this season.
"I was a little leery coming into
the tournament — we hadn't
played like we should," said head
coach Tim Baldwin. "But the team
really came together and put up
some fabulous numbers."
Stanford finished 30 strokes
behind host Arizona State, who

ended with a score 0f869. USC took
third place with 902, three shots off
Stanford's total of 899. San Jose
State captured fourth with 906.
After Friday's first round, the
Cardinal stood in second, only three
shots behind ASU. But a poorer
second round for the Cardinal
allowed the Lady Sun Devils to pull
away and drop Stanford into third.
On Sunday Stanford's final
round could not get it any closer to
ASU, yet it did score the Cardinal a
victory over USC. On the final hole
of the tourney, Stanford shot even
par, but the Trojans were three
over, providing the final margin of
victory.

"This was the first tournament
we all played well [in] and brought
in four good scores each day," said
sophomore Vicky Strada. "We
proved that we could hang with the
other teams."
Individually, Heather Bowie and
Wendy Ward of ASU grabbed the
title with scores of 216. San Jose
State's Vibeke Stensrud took third
with 217.
For Stanford, freshman Mhairi
McKay, the ninth-ranked player in
the nation, finished tied for fourth
overall, three strokes off the lead,
and had two of the five low individ
ual rounds in the tournament.
In addition, junior Jamille Jose
placed 14th. Strada took 17th, and
only her final round score kept her
out of the top ten.
"IStrada] was one of the stories
of the tournament," Baldwin said.
"Her initial rounds of 73 were out

standing."
"I was really happy with my
first two rounds. I didn't hit the
ball too well but my putting was
good," Strada said. "On the final
day, I didn't putt as well and it cost
me."
The team hopes its play in
Tempe is a sign that its problems
are over.
"We're starting to gel at the
right time," Baldwin said. "Every
thing's coming together."
