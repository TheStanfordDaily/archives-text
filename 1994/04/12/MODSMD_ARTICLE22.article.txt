Associate Athletic Director Tom Beckett
was appointed Director of Athletics of Yale
University, Yale President Richard C. Levin
announced today. He will begin a five-year
term this summer.
"I feel fortunate to receive this appointment
as Director of Athletics at Yale," Beckett said.
"I look forward to the opportunity to work
with Yale's students, coaches, faculty and
staff. I am extremely honored by this appoint
ment."
Beckett leaves Stanford after 11 years of
service in the Department of Athletics. Over
that time, his responsibilities included budget

administration, fundraising, marketing and
promotion, community outreach programs
and management of extensive radio and televi
sion contracts.
While at Stanford, Beckett also created
Cardinal Productions, which produces weekly
network television and radio programs to pro
mote University athletics. Stanford's Com
munity Outreach Program, which sends Car
dinal athletes and coaches to local schools,
hospitals and youth programs emphasizing
drug and alcohol education, was also started
by Beckett.
"Tom Beckett is a very qualified athletic
administrator," said Senior Sports Informa
tion Director Gary Midgol. "This move came as
no surprise to anyone.

"This is a big loss for Stanford athletics.
Tom was a big part of Stanford's successes on
and off the field."
At Yale, Beckett will oversee one of the
nation's largest collegiate athletic programs.
Yale boasts 33 varsity sports, 17 for women
and 16 for men. Yale is an NCAA Division I
member, with most of its sports competing in
the Ivy League.
Before working at Stanford, Beckett was
associate director of athletics at San Jose
State University from 1980 to 1983. From
1971 to 1979, he was head basketball and
baseball coach at Butler (Penn.) Community
College. Before that, he was a professional
baseball player in the San Francisco Giants
organization.
