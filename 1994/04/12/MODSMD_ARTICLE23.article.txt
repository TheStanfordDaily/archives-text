# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
As baseball lit up Dedeaux Field in Los
Angeles, as tennis stomped on the Arizona
teams both home and away and as volley
ball worked its magic on the Burnham
courts, Cardinal teams pulled off victories
across the map.

With competition coming to a boil for
most squads, the weekend served as a test
ing ground for Stanford's upcoming chal
lenges. As playoffs and championships
loom on the none-too-distant horizon, this
weekend's showings proved many teams
are worthy of the tasks ahead of them.
For his contribution to the men's volley
ball wins, freshman Mike Hoefer is The
Daily's Athlete of the Week. He is joined by
sophomore gymnast Hillary Anderson, who
turned in an admirable performance in the
Western Regionals.
At 6-feet-7, Hoefer stands as Stanford's
tallest player and the man responsible for a
match-high five blocks in Saturday's Long
Beach State contest. At the middle blocker
position, he also pounded down 10 kills for
a .615 hitting percentage and capped off his
night with eight digs.
In addition, the Goleta, Calif, native's
game winning aces and stuffs provided the
final punch the team needed to secure its
victories.

While the women's gymnastics team did
not fare as well in its bid for an NCAA
berth, Anderson collected individual hon
ors in three events.
Her 9.825 on the bars merited a third, to
which she added a 9.775 on the beam, good

for sixth and a 9.550 on the floor, to take
19th. Despite these impressive numbers,
Anderson, who hails from West Granby,
Conn., will not make a repeat trip to the
NCAAs, as only the top finishers in indi
vidual events qualify.
