# Dashed hopes
## Hunt for NCAA bid fruitless for women 
### Vanessa Arrington Staff writer 
The Stanford women's gymnas
tics team failed to meet its expec
tation of qualifying for NCAA
Nationals last Saturday at the
Regional Championships in Boise,
Idaho. Rather than placing third
out of the seven universities, as
anticipated by the team, the Cardi
nal came in seventh place with a
score of 188.775.
"We've improved so much from
last year, and really were over
achievers all season," said Stan
ford head coach Breck Greenwood.
"We just did not pull it together
for this meet."
UCLA captured the meet with a
194.300, followed closely by Ore
gon State and Washington in a dis
tant third, all of whom will
advance to nationals.
The Cardinal's poor showing
came as a surprise, considering its
two previous wins over Washing
ton earlier this season. Stanford
also garnered victories over both
Cal State-Fullerton and Califor
nia, teams that took fourth and
fifth respectively. Boise State, who
Stanford never met in the regular
season, came in sixth place with a
189.450.
"I was really disappointed with
our team," said junior Meegan
Lannin. "I feel like we let some
thing go which was really in our
reach."
The meet began well for the
Cardinal on the vault, where solid
performances promised what
could have been the team's best
showing of the season, according
to Greenwood. Yet junior Jenny
Ward and freshman Ariel Pas
sanisi suffered from a disparity in
what the judges saw as the start
ing value for the gymnasts'
vaults.
Scores were more accurate for
sophomore Linda Chun, who
earned a season high score of
9.425 on a vault she had only per
formed twice before in competi
tion. Freshman Katie Jennings
also nailed her vault to tie her pre
vious season high of 9.600.
Stanford's fortune took a turn
for the worse when the team
moved to bars and three gymnasts
fell. Chun and senior Laurie West
both missed their release
moves, and Jennings failed to stick
her dismount.
The remaining three gymnasts
— sophomore Hillary Anderson,
junior Jen 6 Elzie and Lannin — all
hit their routines, with Anderson
and Elzie taking third and ninth,
respectively. Yet the team only
managed a 46.850, its fourth-low
est score of the season.

"There is no reason why we
didn't do as well as we should
have," West said. "We were well
rested and ready. We just weren't
on, and it was a meet where you
have to be on."
The Cardinal pulled together
for a 48.000 on the beam, its sec
ond highest team score of the sea
son. Senior Mollie Brown started
the event off well, followed by Pas
sanisi, who gave a calm and solid
performance, according to Green
wood.
Although Anderson and Elzie
nailed their routines and received
sixth and 16th places, respectively,
an injury to Jennings quickly low
ered team morale. She fell during
both her mount and tumbling
series, hitting her knee on the
beam. Jennings finished her rou
tine, but was unable to compete on
the next event.
"After three falls on bars, our
chances were limited," Lannin
said. "People took charge on the
beam but there were wobbles and
Katie's injury. By the time we went
to floor, we knew there was no way
we were going to Nationals."
Ward started the Cardinal off
on the floor, earning an 8.700 after
falling on her double back. Next
up, Lannin "nailed the best rou
tine of her life," according to
Greenwood. She executed three
double backs in her routine, a feat
never accomplished by a Stanford
gymnast, to earn 16th place.
Junior Tina Snowden and
Anderson performed well, earning
seventh and 19th places, respec
tively. Elzie, who Greenwood
expected to qualify easily for
Nationals in the all-around, also
fell on her double back and earned
a 9.200.
"It wasn't the fault of any one
person," Greenwood said. "If we
had all hit though, we probably
would have gone to Nationals."
Lannin thinks more mental
determination may have led to a
different outcome.
We kept emphasizing having
fun, but maybe talking more about
how bad we wanted to go to
nationals and how we would do
whatever it takes to get there
would have been better," she said.
West, who competed for the last
time last Saturday, said she thinks
it is important to look at the sea
son overall, and how successful the
season was.
"We were really productive and
had a lot of fun — there were great
dynamics on the team," West said.
What happened at regionals is a
shame, but it really puts things
into perspective — it is forcing me
to look at the whole rather than
just the parts."

sophomore Linda Chun, who
earned a season high score of
9.425 on a vault she had only per
formed twice before in competi
tion. Freshman Katie Jennings
also nailed her vault to tie her pre
vious season high of 9.600.
Stanford's fortune took a turn
for the worse when the team
moved to bars and three gymnasts
fell. Chun and senior Laurie West
both missed their release
moves, and Jennings failed to stick
her dismount.
The remaining three gymnasts
— sophomore Hillary Anderson,
junior Jen 6 Elzie and Lannin — all
hit their routines, with Anderson
and Elzie taking third and ninth,
respectively. Yet the team only
managed a 46.850, its fourth-low
est score of the season.

"There is no reason why we
didn't do as well as we should
have," West said. "We were well
rested and ready. We just weren't
on, and it was a meet where you
have to be on."
The Cardinal pulled together
for a 48.000 on the beam, its sec
ond highest team score of the sea
son. Senior Mollie Brown started
the event off well, followed by Pas
sanisi, who gave a calm and solid
performance, according to Green
wood.
Although Anderson and Elzie
nailed their routines and received
sixth and 16th places, respectively,
an injury to Jennings quickly low
ered team morale. She fell during
both her mount and tumbling
series, hitting her knee on the
beam. Jennings finished her rou
tine, but was unable to compete on
the next event.
"After three falls on bars, our
chances were limited," Lannin
said. "People took charge on the
beam but there were wobbles and
Katie's injury. By the time we went
to floor, we knew there was no way
we were going to Nationals."
Ward started the Cardinal off
on the floor, earning an 8.700 after
falling on her double back. Next
up, Lannin "nailed the best rou
tine of her life," according to
Greenwood. She executed three
double backs in her routine, a feat
never accomplished by a Stanford
gymnast, to earn 16th place.
Junior Tina Snowden and
Anderson performed well, earning
seventh and 19th places, respec
tively. Elzie, who Greenwood
expected to qualify easily for
Nationals in the all-around, also
fell on her double back and earned
a 9.200.
"It wasn't the fault of any one
person," Greenwood said. "If we
had all hit though, we probably
would have gone to Nationals."
Lannin thinks more mental
determination may have led to a
different outcome.
We kept emphasizing having
fun, but maybe talking more about
how bad we wanted to go to
nationals and how we would do
whatever it takes to get there
would have been better," she said.
West, who competed for the last
time last Saturday, said she thinks
it is important to look at the sea
son overall, and how successful the
season was.
"We were really productive and
had a lot of fun — there were great
dynamics on the team," West said.
What happened at regionals is a
shame, but it really puts things
into perspective — it is forcing me
to look at the whole rather than
just the parts."
