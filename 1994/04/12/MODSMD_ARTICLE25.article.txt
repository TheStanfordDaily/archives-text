# Softball at St.Mary's
## Out for revenge 
### Randy Reback Staff writer 
With vengeance in mind, the Stanford soft ball team will travel to
St. Mary's for a double-header today.
The two teams last met in mid-February during the Spartan
Kick-Off Tournament in San Jose. The Gaeles shutout Stanford on
consecutive days with 2-0 and 6-0 scores in what were the opening
days of the season for the Cardinal (3-22).
While the youthful Cardinal team has only aged two months since
those games, Stanford head coach Sandy Pearce said the club has
significantly matured. "We were so young then," said Pearce. "We're
a different team now."
Captain Lynn Anderson, a sophomore, shares Pearce's positive
attitude and said she thinks the team has become more accustomed
to its positions.
"I feel like we're going to beat them this time," said Anderson.
"The other games were close, and our hitting has been better lately."
The latest improvement for the Cardinal may be the addition of
sophomore Amanda Renteria who joined the lineup 12 days ago.
With Renteria at second base, the starting infield may finally be set.
Freshman Angela Webb will be Stanford's starting pitcher in
today's opener, while classmate Summer Lee will take the mound to
begin the nightcap.
Katie Beattie, another freshman, should continue her recent role
as a relief pitcher as she earned two wins out of the bullpen against
Loyola Mary mount, the Cardinal's most recent opponent.
"A couple of times things were moving slowly, and Katie came in
(to pitch 1 with such a spark," Pearce said of Beattie's performance at
Loyola.
The Cardinal hurlers will try to shut down Paula Libby, St. Mary's
hard-hitting second baseman who pounded out five hits and drove in
four runs against Stanford during the Spartan Tournament.
Controlling Libby will be unimportant, however, if the Cardinal
bats are not more successful against Gaeles pitchers Angela White
and Cindy Waterman who held Stanford to only 11 baserunners dur
ing St. Mary's two victories against Stanford.
"We'll have to push some runs across early and set the tone of the
game," Webb said. "They aren't a big hitting team, but we helped
them in the other games by making errors."
If the Stanford players hope to avenge those defeats today, they
must prove that they are indeed a different team than before.
