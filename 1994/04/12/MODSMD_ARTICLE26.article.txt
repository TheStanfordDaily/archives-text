# Young pitchers take to mound
## Baseball to battle USF Dons

Get to know the Cardinal pitching staff.
When the lOth-ranked Stanford baseball team
(23-15) takes on the University of San Francisco
Dons in non-conference action today at Sunken
Diamond, fans can take a look at some young pitch
ers who do not make regular appearances in Pacif
ic 10 Conference Southern Division play.
While Cardinal head coach Mark Marquess
remains uncertain as to who will start this after
noon's contest, he expects to use a "committee" of
three or four hurlers from a group of righthanders
that includes junior Matt Marenghi and freshmen
Ben Rada, Mark Williams and John David Brammer.
"We need to give these guys some work," Mar
quess said.
Dons batters gave six Stanford pitchers all the
work they could handle when USF drubbed the
Cardinal 18-5 at San Francisco's Benedetti Dia
mond on March 29. In that game, Brammer gave
up four runs and recorded only two outs in his first
collegiate start as the Dons batted around in the
first inning. Williams and Rada then surrendered
eight runs between them in a fourth inning that
saw USF sophomore first baseman Cassidy Fegan
blast solo and grand slam homeruns en route to a
perfect 5-for-5 performance.
"They really started to play
well in that game against us,"
Marquess said, referring to two
subsequent Dons victories in a
three-game series with San Jose
State in West Coast Conference
action. The Spartans then defeat
ed Stanford 4-0 last Tuesday at
Sunken Diamond.
Yet while the Cardinal has
dropped its last two non-confer
ence decisions, it continued its
hot Six-Pac play by taking two of
three from USC last weekend in

Los Angeles. In particular, Mar
quess hopes that the Stanford
bats, quiet the series' first two
games, can carry the momentum
gained from Sunday's solid 9-3
into today's contest.
"It's so hard to predict because
our offense has been our most
inconsistent unit all year," Mar
quess said. "I don't know what
happened Sunday, but I'll take
it."
Meanwhile, a whole stable of
young Cardinal pitchers awaits
an opportunity for revenge on
USF, and for a chance to join in
on Stanford's gripping pennant
drive. Today's contest gets
underway at 2:30 p.m.
