## Baseball to battle USF Dons

Get to know the Cardinal pitching staff.
When the lOth-ranked Stanford baseball team
(23-15) takes on the University of San Francisco
Dons in non-conference action today at Sunken
Diamond, fans can take a look at some young pitch
ers who do not make regular appearances in Pacif
ic 10 Conference Southern Division play.
While Cardinal head coach Mark Marquess
remains uncertain as to who will start this after
noon's contest, he expects to use a "committee" of
three or four hurlers from a group of righthanders
that includes junior Matt Marenghi and freshmen
Ben Rada, Mark Williams and John David Brammer.
"We need to give these guys some work," Mar
quess said.
Dons batters gave six Stanford pitchers all the
work they could handle when USF drubbed the
Cardinal 18-5 at San Francisco's Benedetti Dia
mond on March 29. In that game, Brammer gave
up four runs and recorded only two outs in his first
collegiate start as the Dons batted around in the
first inning. Williams and Rada then surrendered
eight runs between them in a fourth inning that
saw USF sophomore first baseman Cassidy Fegan
blast solo and grand slam homeruns en route to a
perfect 5-for-5 performance.
