# Women's lacrosse captures mid-season win
## 
### Emery Chen 
With the biggest games of the season coming
up, Stanford appeared as if it forgot about the
one last Sunday.
With the attention of the Stanford women's
lacrosse team focused on the upcoming three
weeks, Cal Poly-SLO gave the Cardinal a scare
during the first half before Stanford pulled
together to garner an 18-6 win.
In the process of improving its record to 6-1,
the Cardinal realized Cal Poly would pose a
greater challenge than anticipated. With the
critical Western Regionals tourney coming up
this weekend and the Final Four three weeks
away, it was understandable how the team
overlooked the Mustangs.
While the first half of the contest was much
closer than the team had expected, at the break,
the Cardinal controlled the game by a count of
7-4.
Many scoring opportunities opened up once
Stanford's offense started to click. Goals were

evenly distributed the first half with two play
ers, seniors Betsy Bassis and Amy Leib, scoring
two apiece and three others chipping in. The
Cardinal also had numerous other chances as
some shots bounced off the goal posts while
others barely missed.
However, Cal Poly kept up its scrappy play
and chased loose balls quickly. Center Amelia
Merril scored twice and would likely have added
to the tally if not for the play from Stanford
goalie Hadley Abernathy.
Abernathy, a freshman, made several key
saves to ensure the Cardinal would keep the
lead. Coach Kay Cowperthwait has worked
extensively with the goalies during practices
and it paid off Sunday.
Abernathy's work was not needed as much
in the second half as the Cardinal came out
blazing. Stanford scored quickly as senior co
captain Jenn Watts added her first two goals to
increase the lead to 10-5, forcing Cal Poly to call
a time out in an attempt to put out the fire.
The plan failed. Stanford outscored Cal Poly

8-1 the rest of the way with the final score 18-
6.
The Cardinal coaches had felt that the team
was playing too conservatively during the first
half and, during their halftime speech, stressed
denying passes, checking cleanly and going all
out for loose balls to their team. Stanford fol
lowed, the instructions during the second half
as both the offense and defense played adroitly.
Watts finished the game as the leading scor
er with five goals while Bassis repeated her first
half performance adding two more goals to
bring her total to four. In all, seven Cardinal
players scored.
Coach Cecelia Paglia was happy with the
overall performance saying "the balanced scor
ing means that the team is playing well."
The squad will now center its attention on
the last three weeks of the season. This week,
the Cardinal will travel to Berkeley on Tuesday
followed by St. Mary's on Thursday, and then
return home to face Chico State on Friday for a
make-up game.
