# Cardinal cyclers pedal for second, third
## 
### Joseph Hei 
A little known fact: the Stanford cycling
team is one of the best in the nation. Racing
in Nationals every year since the inception
of the Western Collegiate Cycling Confer
ence (WCCC), the Cardinal has always
placed strongly in the top 10.
And judging by the team's performances
so far this season, coach Art Walker is confi
dent of another powerful showing from his
riders this year.
"Our prospect for being in the top three
in nationals is extremely high," Walker said.
In two dramatic races over the weekend,
third-ranked Stanford continued its suc
cessful season with several strong finishes.
Stanford placed third Saturday behind No. 1
Cal Poly-SLO and UC-Davis, despite win
ning three of six events. Sunday, the team
finished a very close second with 209 points
to Cal Poly's 220.
Stanford's racing weekend included two
different types of races. On Saturday, Stan
ford hosted a criterium race in the parking
lot across from Maples Pavilion. Criteriums
are high-speed, tight-corner races empha
sizing rider control and sprinting. In spite of
the initial wet conditions, Stanford dis
played "great rides by a few riders," accord

ing to Walker.
These rides included senior Nicole Freed
inan's victory in the women's upper level A
race, an event Stanford controlled. In the
men's A race, graduate student Lee Fleming
dramatically sprinted away in the last min
utes to take third. Sophomores Berkeley
Eurbank and Kelley Herndon took the
men's D and women's B division races,
respectively.
Freedman's victory came with an added
bonus: she now stands as the national leader
in the season omnium standings, which
determine the season's individual champion.
"Our objective was to get her the win,"
Walker said. "I have to give credit to the rest
of the team because they gave Nicole what
she needed to achieve this."
Freedman also praised the contributions
of her teammates as crucial to her success.
"It was a great team race. We worked
incredibly well as a team," she said.
On Sunday the team shifted from Satur
day's lap format to a more traditional road
race, held in Alameda County. Both the
men's course (69 miles), and the women's
course (46 miles) provided plenty of hills,
with over 4,000-foot climbs.
Graduate student Bill Lloyd pedaled for
second in the men's A race while fellow

grads Dan Lyons and Rich Long finished
fifth and sixth, respectively, in men's C
competition. In the highlight finish of the
weekend, the Cardinal women rode for first,
second, third and fifth in the A race.
Junior Tracy Timms, the 1992 National
Collegiate Road Race Champion, rode to vic
tory in Herculean fashion. She soloed for
the entire second half of the race, riding
without the aid of a draft.
"I went as hard as I could, and next thing
I knew I had a pretty substantial gap," she
said.
That gap amounted to an impressive eight
minutes between her and the main pack at
the finish line.
Grad student Megan Troxell and Freed
man, both of whom blocked out the competi
tion to help in Timms' win, sprinted late in
the race to exciting second and third place
finishes.
Strong placings on both days proved par
ticularly pleasing to Walker, who anticipat
ed an especially tough weekend due to the
added stress of hosting Saturday's race.
"They didn't get to focus as much because
they had to put on the race," he said.
Judging by the results, however, Stan
ford's focus is locked on to the bull's eye of
a tremendous season.
