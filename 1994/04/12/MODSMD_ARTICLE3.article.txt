## Undergrads assist public-interest lawyers 
### Nina Wasow 
Students with a social con
science who are interested in law
now have a new outlet for their en
ergies.
Concerned about the lack of op
portunities for pre-law students to
gain experience, senior Anita
Presser and coterminal student
Raj Dosanjh have recently formed
Students for Public Interest Law,
a group of undergraduates who
work with lawyers at the East Palo
Alto Community Law Project.
The Project offers pro-bono
legal assistance to low-income
families in East Palo Alto. All of
the lawyers are graduates of Stan
ford Law School.
"Volunteers do research on is
sues that affect the community,"
said Presser. Specifically, the is
sues include education, rent and
housing laws, domestic violence
and community economic develop
ment. Students work directly with

the lawyers, doing paralegal work
and research.
Presser and Dosanjh were both
involved individually with the pro
ject during the last year, but
thought more students should
have the chance to get involved. "It
just seemed like there was nothing
for pre-law students to do in terms
of work, when there was all these
opportunities for pre-med or engi
neering students," Presser said.
The two students decided to
make their work official. "At the
beginning of last quarter, we put
up posters and held meetings for
interested students to publicize
the group," said Presser.
About 12 undergraduates are
currently involved with SPIL,
which is also seeking funding from
the ASSU and has space at the
Haas Center for Public Service.
The project also has an office in the
Law School.
