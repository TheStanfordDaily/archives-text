## Undergrads assist public-interest lawyers 
### Nina Wasow 
Students with a social con
science who are interested in law
now have a new outlet for their en
ergies.
Concerned about the lack of op
portunities for pre-law students to
gain experience, senior Anita
Presser and coterminal student
Raj Dosanjh have recently formed
Students for Public Interest Law,
a group of undergraduates who
work with lawyers at the East Palo
Alto Community Law Project.
The Project offers pro-bono
legal assistance to low-income
families in East Palo Alto. All of
the lawyers are graduates of Stan
ford Law School.
"Volunteers do research on is
sues that affect the community,"
said Presser. Specifically, the is
sues include education, rent and
housing laws, domestic violence
and community economic develop
ment. Students work directly with

the lawyers, doing paralegal work
and research.
Presser and Dosanjh were both
involved individually with the pro
ject during the last year, but
thought more students should
have the chance to get involved. "It
just seemed like there was nothing
for pre-law students to do in terms
of work, when there was all these
opportunities for pre-med or engi
neering students," Presser said.
The two students decided to
make their work official. "At the
beginning of last quarter, we put
up posters and held meetings for
interested students to publicize
the group," said Presser.
About 12 undergraduates are
currently involved with SPIL,
which is also seeking funding from
the ASSU and has space at the
Haas Center for Public Service.
The project also has an office in the
Law School.

Dosanjh recently formed Students for Public Inter

This quarter's group of volun
teers were given assignments last
Friday. Presser said students who
speak Spanish are assigned posi
tions in translating for the
lawyers to prepare their clients
for court — an activity she has
been doing for four years with
lawyer Genie Marino.
Non-bilingual students arrange
and attend meetings to inform

prospective clients of their rights,
or do other tasks for lawyers. "It
really depends on the students'
interests," said Presser.
Some members of SPIL also
have the role of gathering the East
Palo Alto community's opinions
on issues, and talking with resi
dents about the advantages and
downsides of various programs.
Dosanjh said he is currently
involved in a small survey to "find
out about the Indian American
community and how they are feel
ing, legally and educationally
seeing what they would like to see

improved, and letting them know
about the project," he said.
In the past, Dosanjh has
worked with local governments
and school systems to see how
money is appropriated.
"In a sense, the program is a
clearing house for information.
We do a lot of help with fact find
ing on issues when the communi
ty comes to a lawyer with a prob
lem," said Dosanjh.
Dosanjh works with lawyer
David Giles. "We were approached
by the students, and we wanted to
take advantage of that. They're

very talented and energetic," said
Giles. However, he added that,
"it's been hard because we're so
busy, and we wanted to see that
they're supervised well, and have
a good experience."
Giles said the volunteer's effort
can make or break the experience.
"Some have contributed a great
amount. A few students did some
substantial educational research
for me on tracking and special edu
cation in schools," he said. "Others
have not come through enough.
Again, that's partly because of the
quality of the projects and the

supervision. We need to work on
that, but it really depends on the
student's initiative."
While he works with large
numbers of law students, Giles
said that working with under
graduates has been a unique
experience.
SPIL is a year-round program,
with opportunities for summer
volunteer work. In the future,
Dosanjh said that "we plan to
remain small: there's only so
much work for the lawyers to give
us. It's a service oriented pro
gram."
