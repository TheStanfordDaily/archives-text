# Stanford Health Services board named
## Casper appoints Van Etten first CEO of newly formed management body 
### Andy Dworkin Senior staff writer 
Taking a concrete step toward the cre
ation of a new health-care system at
Stanford, University President Gerhard
Casper named the first board of Stanford
Health Services yesterday.
The board will oversee the formation
of SHS, a new management body that
will merge and oversee the clinical opera
tions of Stanford Hospital, School of
Medicine faculty and local physicians.
The first chief executive officer of the
new health group will be the University's
current Chief Financial Officer Peter

Van Etten. Van Etten is taking a leave
from his current job to lead SHS and re
place Kenneth Bloem as president and
CEO of Stanford Hospital.
Bloem is leaving to take a job at a think
tank in Washington, D.C.
Van Etten said he will start his new
job May 2 and should retain the job for six
months to a year. In the meantime, he
said, the duties of the chief financial offi
cer "will be divided among a number of
people."
The first chair of the SHS board will
be Isaac Stein, a member of the hospital
board of directors who helped
come up with the idea for SHS and
is president of the Palo Alto invest
ment firm Waverly Associates Inc.
Casper said this board has the
weighty task of "getting us to the
formal formation of Stanford
Health Services," including com
ing up with a business plan for
the group and seeing it through
its legal creation.
Currently, SHS is only "a cor
poration in formation," not a
legal corporation, Casper said.
Thus, the board named yesterday
is actually called an "interim
board." However, Casper said
that once SHS becomes an offi
cial body, the interim board will
likely continue and become the
official SHS board.
The SHS should become a
legal body by Sept. 1. Before that
time, however, the organization
needs to get final approval from
the University Board of Trustees.
Casper said the trustees will con
sider the SHS business plan and
evaluate its overall viability when
they vote on final approval for
the group. That vote should come
at the trustees' June meeting,
Casper said.
Stanford Health Services itself
is the product of a re-examina
tion ordered by Casper of how the

Medical Center conducts busi
ness. A task force presented a
blueprint for the reform last
June, and the Board of Trustees
and Hospital Board approved the
reform in February.
The changes aim to make
Stanford more competitive in the
changing health care market and
thus support the center's aca
demic mission as well as improve
its finances.
After implementing the
blueprint, the SHS board will
develop a "strategic plan" for the
future of the Medical Center,
Van Etten said.
"There's obviously a lot of
change going on in the medical
field," Van Etten said. "It will be
a very active board, involved in
many issues, especially because
of the many changes going on in
the industry."
Among the specific issues the
board will have to address are how
Stanford Hospital and the Chil
dren's Hospital will fit into the
overall plan and how "to ensure
the Hospital continues to provide
support and resources for private
physicians," Van Etten said.
Peter Gregory, an associate
dean in the School of Medicine
and medical director of the Facul
ty Practice Program, will serve as
the first chief medical officer of
SHS. Casper also named hospital
Vice President for Operations
Malinda Mitchell to the board as
chief operating officer.
