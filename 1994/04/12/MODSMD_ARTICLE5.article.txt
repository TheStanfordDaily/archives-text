# Hospital president leaving Farm
## 
### Andy Dworkin Senior staff writer 
Kenneth Bloem, president and
chief executive officer of Stanford
Hospital, will soon be leaving the
Farm for a job in the big city.
Bloem said he will leave the hospi
tal to take charge of a Washington,
D.C.-baaed think tank. Bloem will
likely start his new job in the fall.
At Stanford, Bloem has been the fi

nancial head of the hospital and has
helped plan the changes the Medical
Center is implementing. These
changes aim to make Stanford more
competitive in the changing national
health-care environment.
University Chief Financial Officer
Peter Van Etten will take a leave of ab
sence to temporarily replace Bloem.
Bloem said his work on Stanford's
health reform and other experi
ences on campus will help him
when he becomes president and
CEO of Advisory Board Co., a for
profit think-tank that advises
organizations on health care,
finance and human resources.
About 1,000 of the largest hos
pitals and pharmaceutical con
cerns in America and worldwide
use Advisory Board, Bloem said,
as well as about 400 major banks.
"It's an opportunity for me to
be involved in an organization
that is highly respected . . . for
providing the best strategic
advice in health care" and deal
with exciting issues in non
health-care fields, Bloem said.
While Bloem has worked on
many different areas of health
care at Stanford, he said one of
the projects he is most proud of is
trying to give extra attention to
"treating patients like whole peo
ple," bringing greater empathy
and humanism to health care. He
cited such practices as holding
concerts in the atrium and intro
ducing health care to local minor

ity students as examples of the
humanization of health care.
Bloem also said he values the
more collegial and supportive
relations that have developed
between local doctors and full
time faculty over the years.
University President Gerhard
Casper said Bloem's influence is
reflected in Stanford Health Ser
vices, the body that Bloem helped
create to oversee the changes and
reorganization of the Medical
Center. He added that Bloem is
"truly seizing an extraordinary
opportunity" in his move to
Washington.
Van Etten said Bloem "has
done a superb job managing the
hospital for the last five years
and has made significant contri
butions to Stanford."
Bloem said he will miss Stan
ford in the future, especially the
management staff and others he
has worked with here.
"The things that I'll especially
miss are the colleagues and the
relations I've developed," he said.
"It's a higher level of profession
alism and dedication . . . than I
have seen in my 20 years of expe
rience.
"Stanford is a magic place,"
Bloem said.
