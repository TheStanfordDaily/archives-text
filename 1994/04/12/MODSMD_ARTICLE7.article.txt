# COP debate covers range of issues
## 
### Jim Luh Staff writer 
The two slates for Council of Presi
dents stood in sharp contrast last night,
clashing over issues from student repre
sentation in the University administra
tion to gambling boats in Lake Lagunita
as they debated in Rinconada lounge.
While neither slate presented many
new plans or positions, the dialogue —
and drama on the part of one slate —
provided a window into the distinctions
between the humorously oriented

"Teamsters" slate and the more ortho
dox "Students' Voice" slate.
The Teamsters, who are sponsored
by the Chaparral, came clad in work
shirts and jeans, smoking cigars and
passing out Budweiser. One of their
members, Tony Sirna, arrived late —
and clad in an Italian-style suit — saying
he had to take care of some "business."
Students' Voice, who are sponsored
by the People's Platform, came without
uniforms or gifts, and during the debate
appeared alternately amused and an
noyed by their opponents. Their fourth

member, junior Anietie Ekanem, ar
rived late because he had been meeting
with a Board of Trustees committee.
The Teamsters started the debate by
expressing their dismay at students who
did not take their platform — which in
cludes a bowling alley in Tresidder
Union, free fuzzy dice and a gambling
boat in Lake Lagunita — seriously.
"We're deadly serious," senior Doug
Miro declared. "If any of you are writing
that down, you can put deadly in italics."
Students' Voice, on the other
hand, sent a less extravagant mes
sage, promising student empow
erment in University decision
making.
"Students really do need a
voice, and we intend to be that
voice," said junior Mork Murdock.
Responding to a question
regarding the lack of student rep
resentation in the University
administration, sophomore
Vanessa Alvarado said that Stu
dents' Voice will use the Student
Affairs Committee of the ASSU
Senate, the recently revived dorm
representatives program and
quarterly meetings with the
administration to involve the
entire student body in administra
tive decisions.
Junior Lisa Lee said Students'
Voice will also work to force the
administration to share informa
tion with students.
"Something that we have to
keep doing is asking for more
information," Lee said.
The slates also differed on the
role of the COP in student leader
ship.
"The COP is four people, but

the real power remains with . . .
students," said Ekanem, promis
ing that if elected, Students' Voice
would serve as a coordinating
body to guide students who want
to get involved.
The Teamsters, on the other
hand, promised that the COP
could provide the necessary pres
sure without help from students,
vaguely alluding to connections
with organized crime.
"We'll be able to put some pres
sure on the administration,"
Sirna assured.
"Bats and crowbars make good
leverage," said Peter Marks.
The debate also gave the Team
sters an opportunity to demon
strate their proposed system of
"randemocracy," by which stu
dents would be rotated randomly
into the COP.
The debate was interrupted
midway by a faux assassination —
slate member Scott Gagner was
"gunned down" by an unidentified
assailant. The surviving Team
sters quickly recruited sophomore
Shaun Cram from the audience as
their new fourth member.
Cram assumed her duties
immediately, joining the Team
sters on their couch and challeng
ing Students' Voice's positions on
improving the efficiency at the
post office.
