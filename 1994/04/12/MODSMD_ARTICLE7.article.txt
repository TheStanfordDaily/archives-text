# COP debate covers range of issues

### Jim Luh Staff writer 
The two slates for Council of Presi
dents stood in sharp contrast last night,
clashing over issues from student repre
sentation in the University administra
tion to gambling boats in Lake Lagunita
as they debated in Rinconada lounge.
While neither slate presented many
new plans or positions, the dialogue —
and drama on the part of one slate —
provided a window into the distinctions
between the humorously oriented

"Teamsters" slate and the more ortho
dox "Students' Voice" slate.
The Teamsters, who are sponsored
by the Chaparral, came clad in work
shirts and jeans, smoking cigars and
passing out Budweiser. One of their
members, Tony Sirna, arrived late —
and clad in an Italian-style suit — saying
he had to take care of some "business."
Students' Voice, who are sponsored
by the People's Platform, came without
uniforms or gifts, and during the debate
appeared alternately amused and an
noyed by their opponents. Their fourth

member, junior Anietie Ekanem, ar
rived late because he had been meeting
with a Board of Trustees committee.
The Teamsters started the debate by
expressing their dismay at students who
did not take their platform — which in
cludes a bowling alley in Tresidder
Union, free fuzzy dice and a gambling
boat in Lake Lagunita — seriously.
"We're deadly serious," senior Doug
Miro declared. "If any of you are writing
that down, you can put deadly in italics."
