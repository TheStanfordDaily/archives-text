Is Florence Moore Hall at the
top of your draw card?
If not, scheduled summer reno
vations of Flo Mo and various Row
Houses may alter the way you rank
your housing options.
The University's Housing Capi
tal Campaign is a $ 110 million pro
ject aimed at improving Stanford's
residences over the next 10 years.
Priority is given to those older res
idences with the "worst deferred
maintenance," said Rodger Whit
ney, associate director of Student
Housing.
"We work with the existing
buildings, but we bring them up to
new standards. We make them
more aesthetically pleasing and
improve their usefulness to stu
dents," said Whitney.
The campaign — which began
last summer — funds the renova
tion of one large dormitory and two
to four Row Houses per year. Re
pairs in Escondido Village take
place throughout the year, restor
ing apartments upon vacancy. Im
provement of Mirrielees is sched
uled toward the latter half of the
restoration campaign.
The project began with the ren
ovation of Wilbur Hall, the Beta
House and Muwekma-Tah-Ruk.
"The Wilbur renovation got high
marks and lots of positive feed
back," in response to a student sur
vey sponsored by his office, Whit
ney said.
The second phase of the cam
paign will begin this summer after
graduation. The improvement
plan includes Flo Mo, Grove-La
suen, Hammarskjold House, Phi
Sigand 553 Mayfield.
In the fall, residents of Flo Mo
can expect to find a freshly painted
building, improved landscaping
and courtyards, renovated
