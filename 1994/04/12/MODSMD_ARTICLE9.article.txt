This summer, several Stanford students
will have the chance to explore public service
opportunities worldwide, working on pro
jects as diverse as coordinating activities for
Japanese-American senior citizens or inves
tigating educational programs in Nepal.
The Donald Kennedy Public Service Sum
mer Fellowship program will support 14 stu
dents' full-time community service projects
this summer. The Haas Center for Public
Service first implemented the program in
1984 to aid students interested in addressing
environmental, social and educational issues,
and later renamed the program in honor of
former University President Kennedy's com
mitment to public service.
Junior Jose Munoz, a psychology and
Spanish major, will work with the Alliance
Against Family Violence in Bakersfield,
Calif, to establish peer counseling groups for
abused women. Munoz said he will use the
summer to establish the new program which

he hopes will "keep running by itself with
help from alliance members."
He said his experience as a peer counselor
at the Jane Lathrop Stanford school in Palo
Alto has provided a strong foundation for his
summer service work.
Sophomore Trisha Moquino, an American
studies major, will return to her hometown of
Santo Domingo Pueblo, N.M. to start ayouth
group for the villagers. The youth organiza
tion will emphasize community service activ
ities, such as cleaning the village outskirts, as
well as social events including drug and alco
hol-free dances.
Moquino also plans to lead writing work
shops to compensate for deficiencies in the
writing program at the local school.
For Moquino, the fellowship allows her to
realize a longtime goal. "I had been wanting
to start a youth group and needed financial
aid," she said. "Even if I didn't get the schol
arship, I'd still start the group, but the finan
cial aid will help."
Darren Nakata, an earth systems
co-terminal student, will use fellow
ship money to improve programs at
a Japanese-American senior citizen
center in Portland, Ore. The cen
ter, Ikoi-no-kai, currently serves hot
lunches, but Nakata's plan will
expand the service.
"I want to develop a program
that has two goals: increasing social
activities and improving health
maintenance," he said. Under the
new plan, seniors will take field
trips to Portland's Japanese gar
dens or to the Oregon coast.
Senior Natasha Iskander will
work at the Larkin Street Youth
Center in San Francisco, a crisis
service center for homeless youths.
Iskander said she wants to help the
children confront the issue of HIV
because they have information
about being safe but "lack negotia
tion skills."
In addition, law student David
Adelman will work with the Gila

River tribe in Arizona to research
the effects of federal environmental
regulations. Brock Albin, also a law
student, will start a program for
Stanford students to defend chil
dren in dependency court cases.
Master's students Natasha
Deganello and Beatriz de la Mora
will travel to Nepal to investigate
the Educate the Children program
in that country. Other recipients
include Eric Hsu, a sophomore who
will fight poverty with Empty the
Shelters in Oakland, Calif., and law
student Tamara Lave who will sup
port the plight of battered women
by working with Ayuda Legal Aid
in Washington, D.C. Adele Morri
son, also a law student, will address
HIV issues with the National Cen
ter for Lesbian Rights.
Sophomore Nereyda Salinas
will fight gang activity by working
with inner-city students in Chica
go. Junior Paula Shoemake will
help implement the Healthy Start
program in East Palo Alto and
Menlo Park. Junior Abdi Soltani
will work with the Greenbelt
Alliance to address environmental
issues in the Bay Area.
