This summer, several Stanford students
will have the chance to explore public service
opportunities worldwide, working on pro
jects as diverse as coordinating activities for
Japanese-American senior citizens or inves
tigating educational programs in Nepal.
The Donald Kennedy Public Service Sum
mer Fellowship program will support 14 stu
dents' full-time community service projects
this summer. The Haas Center for Public
Service first implemented the program in
1984 to aid students interested in addressing
environmental, social and educational issues,
and later renamed the program in honor of
former University President Kennedy's com
mitment to public service.
Junior Jose Munoz, a psychology and
Spanish major, will work with the Alliance
Against Family Violence in Bakersfield,
Calif, to establish peer counseling groups for
abused women. Munoz said he will use the
summer to establish the new program which

he hopes will "keep running by itself with
help from alliance members."
He said his experience as a peer counselor
at the Jane Lathrop Stanford school in Palo
Alto has provided a strong foundation for his
summer service work.
Sophomore Trisha Moquino, an American
studies major, will return to her hometown of
Santo Domingo Pueblo, N.M. to start ayouth
group for the villagers. The youth organiza
tion will emphasize community service activ
ities, such as cleaning the village outskirts, as
well as social events including drug and alco
hol-free dances.
Moquino also plans to lead writing work
shops to compensate for deficiencies in the
writing program at the local school.
For Moquino, the fellowship allows her to
realize a longtime goal. "I had been wanting
to start a youth group and needed financial
aid," she said. "Even if I didn't get the schol
arship, I'd still start the group, but the finan
cial aid will help."
