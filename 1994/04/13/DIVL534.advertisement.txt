and Learning: Findings from the Harvard
Assessment Seminars
A Public Address
by
Professor Richard Light
on
Thursday, April 14,
2:14-3:05 pm
at
CERAS, Room 112
Professor Light is the director of the Harvard Assessment
Seminars, "Explorations with Students and Faculty about
Teaching, Learning and Student Life," and the author of
two influential reports on the Seminar's findings, dated
1990 and 1992. Over one hundred faculty and
administrators from Harvard and twenty other colleges have
participated in the Seminars, meeting on a regular basis to
discuss how systematic research could improve
undergraduate teaching and learning. Though the meetings
are still going on,enough conclusions have been drawn to fill j
two reports and stir national interest in the in-class and out
of-class experience of undergraduates.
This event co-sponsored by The Center for Teaching and
Learning and the Commission on Undergraduate Education ,
