Only the styles
have changed.
When we started our fraternal benefit
insurance society nearly 100 years ago.
we designed special benefits for the
families of our members — because we
knew you would want it that way. Nothing
has really changed. Our members still
want special benefits for their families.
And Royal Neighbors of America still pro
vides them — like our Newborn Benefit
that combines an infant death benefit with
a provision for permanent life insurance
protection without evidence of insurability.
Styles have changed. People are still
basically the same. And so is Royal
Neighbors of America.
