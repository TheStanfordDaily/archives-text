Learning to fly is no easy task. But Stanford Flying Club makes it fun. Our step by
step lessons will take you all the way from your first lesson to your pilot's license in
no time. Most of our students obtain their Solo License"" with only 10-20 hours of
flying time. After that, you might try one of our advanced training or aerobatics
classes. And as a non-profit club, we can get you flying for far cheaper than you
might think: our aircraft rates are 15-35% less than Bay Area commercial flight
schools offer. Call today between 1:00-5:00 and get the details.
