Interested in writing for the Science section?
Or just have an idea for a science story you think The Daily should investigate?
Though the Science Bug is on vacation this week, The Daily's science
department is still hard at work. Call the science editor at 725-2100 or send
him e-mail at science@daily.stanford.edu with ideas, suggestions or
complaints about the page. If you're interested in writing for the science
section, also watch The Daily for announcements of new-writer meetings.
