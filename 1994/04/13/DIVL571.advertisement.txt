Vote YES on Senate ReForm!
A&R-20 (The Districting Bill) will-
• Eliminate campus -wide flyer • Inspire debates among candidates
plastering, keeping campaigns for each district to expose issues
confined to one district and opinions
• Force senators to campaign • Create a REAL dorm representation
directly to their constituents system where senators represent
and listen to the voters the very people who elected
• Give every senator the right to vote them
Graduates are districted by their various schools
Why shouldn't undergraduates have the
same advantage?
And making every senator vote is an advantage for everyone
