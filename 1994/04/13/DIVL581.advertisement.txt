Why THE DAILY needs your support
Imagine putting out an award-winning newspaper every day. Finding and reporting the news, covering sports games (and national championshipsl),
spotlighting great entertainment, sorting through letters, selling advertisements, producing a cutting-edge multi-media magazine, and shooting photographs often on a moment's notice.
Now imagine doing this while juggling a full load of classes. This is what over 100 students do here at The Daily. The end product is a newspaper that is read campus-wide
as well as in the surrounding neighborhoods by 25,000 students, faculty, staff and other members of the community.
The Stanford Daily is an independent, non-profit, student-run newspaper that is the primary medium for communicating news and events to the Stanford community.
Our mission is twofold:
1) To provide professional news coverage of the University community
2) To provide a valuable learning experience for over 300 students per year
However, in the last three years, The Daily has been forced to accomplish this mission while also cutting $100,000 from its budget. Reductions in advertising, caused by a sluggish economy and contin
uing University budget cuts, have prompted The Daily to reduce circulation and compensation and lower the average paper size — while working aggressively to maximize sales.
• Your special fee will help avoid additional cuts, which would include further reductions in circulation, less sports coverage and fewer resources overall to adequately
cover campus news.
• Your special fee will ultimately ensure that The Daily continues to report campus news — on budget cuts, protests, layoffs, town meetings or other matters of interest
— in a timely manner (unlike UC-Berkeley's Daily Californian, which is now published only twice a week due to lack of funds).
• The Daily's special fee request represents a 6.5 percent increase over last year's request, not including inflation. This is well below the 10 percent increase (not
including inflation) which student groups were allowed, and which many took advantage of. The Daily's increased costs mainly reflect an increase in typesetting and
printing charges.
• Why does The Daily need a special fee if it is a $1 million corporation? This is a commonly asked question. The answer: Being a $1 million corporation means
that while we have about $1 million in revenue (this includes your fee), we also have about $1 million in expenses. Contrary to published reports, The Daily does not
have a $1 million endowment.
• The Daily's production costs slightly exceed $1 million, and advertising revenues fall slightly below. Your special fee helps make up the difference. For us, it guaran
tees financial solvency. For you, it guarantees continued coverage of campus issues and events. And for each student, it amounts to only three cents per issue.
