# LaIR to cut 7.6%
## Government relations offices also hit 
### Andy Dworkin Senior staff writer 
Yesterday's "town hall" meeting
on budget cuts started with a bit of
comic relief.
Robert Street, vice provost for Li-
and Information Resources,
projected a Far Side cartoon show
ing Humpty Dumpty sitting on the
ground, intact after his fall. "Well,
I'llbedanged!.. .I'mOK!"Humpty
says.
Behind him, the wall is falling
and about to crush Humpty to bits.
The message was clear. "There is
a sense of humor left somewhere,"
Street said. "Afler four years of

repositioning, budget cuts and plan
ning, it's perhaps not surprising —
or maybe it is — that we can feel OK,
feel like Humpty Dumpty."
Now he just has to avoid the wall.
Street and Chief Financial Offi
cer Peter Van Etten spent about 90
minutes explaining to a crowd of
about 200 how they aim to dodge the
wall, or at least cushion its blow, over
the next three years of budget cuts.
Taking the stage first, Street dis
cussed the ways through which he
hopes to trim $305,000 — about 7.6
percent — from his $4 million ad
ministrative budget in fiscal year

Government
and Stanford
will decide on
a permanent
indirect cost
rate.
