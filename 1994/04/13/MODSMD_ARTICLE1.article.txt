# LaIR to cut 7.6%
## Government relations offices also hit 
### Andy Dworkin Senior staff writer 
Yesterday's "town hall" meeting
on budget cuts started with a bit of
comic relief.
Robert Street, vice provost for Li-
and Information Resources,
projected a Far Side cartoon show
ing Humpty Dumpty sitting on the
ground, intact after his fall. "Well,
I'llbedanged!.. .I'mOK!"Humpty
says.
Behind him, the wall is falling
and about to crush Humpty to bits.
The message was clear. "There is
a sense of humor left somewhere,"
Street said. "Afler four years of

repositioning, budget cuts and plan
ning, it's perhaps not surprising —
or maybe it is — that we can feel OK,
feel like Humpty Dumpty."
Now he just has to avoid the wall.
Street and Chief Financial Offi
cer Peter Van Etten spent about 90
minutes explaining to a crowd of
about 200 how they aim to dodge the
wall, or at least cushion its blow, over
the next three years of budget cuts.
Taking the stage first, Street dis
cussed the ways through which he
hopes to trim $305,000 — about 7.6
percent — from his $4 million ad
ministrative budget in fiscal year

Government
and Stanford
will decide on
a permanent
indirect cost
rate.

-1995. At the same time, Street said
he hopes to maintain or increase
the investment in many of the aca
demic areas of Libraries and Infor
mation Resources.
Van Etten followed, outlining
his plans for a 17.6 percent reduc
tion in his approximately $53 mil
lion budget over the next three
years. About one-quarter of those
cuts will come next year.
The hardest hit areas over the
next three years will be the Spon
sored Projects Office, which helps
regulate some research on campus,
and the Office of Government Cost
and Rate Studies, which helps
negotiate research funds from the
government.
Street estimated that 25 posi
tions could be cut from Libraries
and Information Resources over
the three years of budget cuts. He
said he would try to make cuts
through attrition or by not filling
empty jobs instead of laying people
off. Van Etten said it was too early

in the process for him to estimate
the number of positions that will be
cut from the areas he oversees.
Street said that, because his
organization has both academic
and administrative components, it
was put in the unique position of
cutting and bolstering different
areas at the same time.
The cuts will come from trying
to reduce administrative use of
computers and getting rid of cer
tain connections to the mainframe
computer called "Gandolf" connec
tions.
Library and Information
Resources also will try to more effi
ciently use the mainframe comput
er by moving some computing
functions from Stanford's main
frame computer to client-servers —
other computers that can centrally
store information. Some electronic
mail will be moved off the main
frame, as well as the libraries'
NOTIS computer system, the stu
dent financial aid system and the
Folio system.
Folio will be replaced by a new
system called "Portfolio" that is
currently being tested and should
be in place by the fall, Street said.
Portfolio is a "graphic user inter

face" (it looks a little like the Mac
intosh system, with its icons) and
will allow access to information on
Stanford's campus, classrooms,
research and administration as
well as a connection to the Internet
and other features.
Further savings will come from
holding down the budget for tele
phone services in upcoming years
and adding cable television to
dorms, Street said. Cable TV will
help relieve stress on the budget
because the funds raised by charg
ing residences for the services will
be used to fund the educational
television services currently paid
for by general funds.
At the same time these cuts are
carried out, however, Street said
several areas will have additional
resources diverted to them, includ
ing new fund-raising drives for
some areas.
The reconstruction of Green
Library West, and combining
Green West, Green East and Meyer
Library into "a library quad of
some importance," are two areas
that will be targeted for fundraising
and reallocated resources, Street
said.
Technical support services also

will get more attention. In fact,
Street said, a new building to sup
port technical services will be con
structed near the Stanford Auxil
iary Library in the next 18 months
to three years.
Resources will also be refocused
on trying to deal with the ever
increasing number of computers
and maintaining and improving
Stanford's link to the Internet.
Many of the cuts to Van Etten's
area will come from offices that deal
with the government, research and
indirect costs — the money the fed
eral government pays the Universi
ty to cover some of the overhead
costs of certain research projects.
Hardest hit will be the Spon
sored Projects Office, which will
lose 30 percent of its approximately
$1.5 million budget over the next
three years. The cuts are part of an
overall effort to change the way
research is administered at Stan
ford to support research while cut
ting costs. The savings will be real
ized through restructuring the
office's procedures, he said.
The Government Cost and Rate
Studies office will lose 22 percent of
its $3.6 million budget over the
next three years by changing the

way the government and Stanford
calculate the percentage of indirect
cost reimbursement.
Currently, a rate is set at the
start of a fiscal year and then audi
tors evaluate the research done at
the end of the year and adjust pay
ments. In the future, Van Etten
said, the University and govern
ment will decide on a permanent,
fixed rate — saving significantly on
auditing costs.
The Internal Audit office will
lose 20 percent of its approximately
$1.8 million budget by 1997
through restructuring and some
cuts.
Also cutting 20 percent over
three years from its approximately
$8.3 million budget is the Con
troller's office. In the first year,
one-quarter of these cuts will be
made through "all-around belt
tightening" and not filling empty
jobs, said Controller Joanne Cov
ille. In future years, cuts will have
to come through restructuring the
office's work, tiying to lower costs
and possibly farming work out to
other companies, she said.
Facilities will cut 15 percent of
its approximately $33.5 million
budget by 1997 through restruc-

Turing and reorganizing its office
and procedures and likely farming
out some work, said Assoc. Vice
Provost for Facilities Kernel
Dawkins. Dawkins said he will also
look at tiying to buy cheaper sup
plies and save money on the meth
ods used to make purchases.
The Business Information Sys
tems Applications will have to cut 5
percent of its $3.7 million budget
next year, partly through not filling
two positions, Van Etten said. In
the future, they will have to try and
save much more money, he added,
although the exact amount is not
known.
Van Etten's own office will cut
its $667,000 budget 8 percent next
year by not filling a half billet, he
said. The Planning office will have
to cut 10 percent of its $400,000
budget by 1997, he added.
The Office of Technology
Licensing will not have to make any
cuts, because it raises general funds
for the University instead of cost
ing funds, Van Etten said. Howev
er, he added, even this office will try
to cut its budget by about 5 percent
a year for five years in anticipation
of the end of a very lucrative patent
on genetic technology.

The message was clear. "There is
a sense of humor left somewhere,"
Street said. "Afler four years of

repositioning, budget cuts and plan
ning, it's perhaps not surprising —
or maybe it is — that we can feel OK,
feel like Humpty Dumpty."
Now he just has to avoid the wall.
Street and Chief Financial Offi
cer Peter Van Etten spent about 90
minutes explaining to a crowd of
about 200 how they aim to dodge the
wall, or at least cushion its blow, over
the next three years of budget cuts.
Taking the stage first, Street dis
cussed the ways through which he
hopes to trim $305,000 — about 7.6
percent — from his $4 million ad
ministrative budget in fiscal year

Government
and Stanford
will decide on
a permanent
indirect cost
rate.

-1995. At the same time, Street said
he hopes to maintain or increase
the investment in many of the aca
demic areas of Libraries and Infor
mation Resources.
Van Etten followed, outlining
his plans for a 17.6 percent reduc
tion in his approximately $53 mil
lion budget over the next three
years. About one-quarter of those
cuts will come next year.
The hardest hit areas over the
next three years will be the Spon
sored Projects Office, which helps
regulate some research on campus,
and the Office of Government Cost
and Rate Studies, which helps
negotiate research funds from the
government.
Street estimated that 25 posi
tions could be cut from Libraries
and Information Resources over
the three years of budget cuts. He
said he would try to make cuts
through attrition or by not filling
empty jobs instead of laying people
off. Van Etten said it was too early

in the process for him to estimate
the number of positions that will be
cut from the areas he oversees.
Street said that, because his
organization has both academic
and administrative components, it
was put in the unique position of
cutting and bolstering different
areas at the same time.
The cuts will come from trying
to reduce administrative use of
computers and getting rid of cer
tain connections to the mainframe
computer called "Gandolf" connec
tions.
Library and Information
Resources also will try to more effi
ciently use the mainframe comput
er by moving some computing
functions from Stanford's main
frame computer to client-servers —
other computers that can centrally
store information. Some electronic
mail will be moved off the main
frame, as well as the libraries'
NOTIS computer system, the stu
dent financial aid system and the
Folio system.
Folio will be replaced by a new
system called "Portfolio" that is
currently being tested and should
be in place by the fall, Street said.
Portfolio is a "graphic user inter

face" (it looks a little like the Mac
intosh system, with its icons) and
will allow access to information on
Stanford's campus, classrooms,
research and administration as
well as a connection to the Internet
and other features.
Further savings will come from
holding down the budget for tele
phone services in upcoming years
and adding cable television to
dorms, Street said. Cable TV will
help relieve stress on the budget
because the funds raised by charg
ing residences for the services will
be used to fund the educational
television services currently paid
for by general funds.
At the same time these cuts are
carried out, however, Street said
several areas will have additional
resources diverted to them, includ
ing new fund-raising drives for
some areas.
The reconstruction of Green
Library West, and combining
Green West, Green East and Meyer
Library into "a library quad of
some importance," are two areas
that will be targeted for fundraising
and reallocated resources, Street
said.
Technical support services also

will get more attention. In fact,
Street said, a new building to sup
port technical services will be con
structed near the Stanford Auxil
iary Library in the next 18 months
to three years.
Resources will also be refocused
on trying to deal with the ever
increasing number of computers
and maintaining and improving
Stanford's link to the Internet.
Many of the cuts to Van Etten's
area will come from offices that deal
with the government, research and
indirect costs — the money the fed
eral government pays the Universi
ty to cover some of the overhead
costs of certain research projects.
Hardest hit will be the Spon
sored Projects Office, which will
lose 30 percent of its approximately
$1.5 million budget over the next
three years. The cuts are part of an
overall effort to change the way
research is administered at Stan
ford to support research while cut
ting costs. The savings will be real
ized through restructuring the
office's procedures, he said.
The Government Cost and Rate
Studies office will lose 22 percent of
its $3.6 million budget over the
next three years by changing the

way the government and Stanford
calculate the percentage of indirect
cost reimbursement.
Currently, a rate is set at the
start of a fiscal year and then audi
tors evaluate the research done at
the end of the year and adjust pay
ments. In the future, Van Etten
said, the University and govern
ment will decide on a permanent,
fixed rate — saving significantly on
auditing costs.
The Internal Audit office will
lose 20 percent of its approximately
$1.8 million budget by 1997
through restructuring and some
cuts.
Also cutting 20 percent over
three years from its approximately
$8.3 million budget is the Con
troller's office. In the first year,
one-quarter of these cuts will be
made through "all-around belt
tightening" and not filling empty
jobs, said Controller Joanne Cov
ille. In future years, cuts will have
to come through restructuring the
office's work, tiying to lower costs
and possibly farming work out to
other companies, she said.
Facilities will cut 15 percent of
its approximately $33.5 million
budget by 1997 through restruc-

Turing and reorganizing its office
and procedures and likely farming
out some work, said Assoc. Vice
Provost for Facilities Kernel
Dawkins. Dawkins said he will also
look at tiying to buy cheaper sup
plies and save money on the meth
ods used to make purchases.
The Business Information Sys
tems Applications will have to cut 5
percent of its $3.7 million budget
next year, partly through not filling
two positions, Van Etten said. In
the future, they will have to try and
save much more money, he added,
although the exact amount is not
known.
Van Etten's own office will cut
its $667,000 budget 8 percent next
year by not filling a half billet, he
said. The Planning office will have
to cut 10 percent of its $400,000
budget by 1997, he added.
The Office of Technology
Licensing will not have to make any
cuts, because it raises general funds
for the University instead of cost
ing funds, Van Etten said. Howev
er, he added, even this office will try
to cut its budget by about 5 percent
a year for five years in anticipation
of the end of a very lucrative patent
on genetic technology.
Yesterday's "town hall" meeting
on budget cuts started with a bit of
comic relief.
Robert Street, vice provost for Li-
and Information Resources,
projected a Far Side cartoon show
ing Humpty Dumpty sitting on the
ground, intact after his fall. "Well,
I'llbedanged!.. .I'mOK!"Humpty
says.
Behind him, the wall is falling
