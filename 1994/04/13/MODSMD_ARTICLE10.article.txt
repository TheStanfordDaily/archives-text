Martin Piccoli, Teach For America's director of
core member affairs, emphasized the importance of
grass-roots education during an informal campus
address in Toyon lounge last night.
Teach For America, a national organization
founded in the mid-1980s, sends highly qualified
college graduates into inner-city schools to partici
pate in a two-year teaching program.
Piccoli, noting that college presents students
with a unique opportunity to devote themselves to
issues of concern, told the students in attendance
that the time to get involved with educational
reform is now.
"College provides a chance to focus on some
thing, take a stand, and put your energy into it,"he
said.
However, Piccoli was quick to point out that edu
cational issues are rarely at the forefront of stu
dents' minds, for the simple reason that most uni
versity-level students rarely have been affected by
the severe shortcomings of many inner-city schools.
"Are there students who are ready to fight for
public education, the way people fight for the envi
ronment and other such issues? Not right now,"
Piccoli said.
Consequently, Piccoli focused on a message that
preached the importance of passionate individual

involvement. What college campuses need, he
argued, are committed students who bring the
issue (of education] into their personal lives and also
into the life of the campus. "
Piccoli was joined by three past participants in
Teach For America, each of whom reiterated the
value of careers in education. Kheita Davis, who
presently teaches in East Palo Alto, spoke of the tra
ditional lack of interest in children's education, con
trasting this indifference with a plea for involve
ment.
"We all have a responsibility, regardless of
whether we're rich or poor, white or black, to give
back," she said.
The discussion marked the beginning of Educa
tion Week, an event being organized by TEACh â€”
Targeting Education Action for Children. TEACh is
a campus organization that was established in Jan
uary in order to bring greater attention to educa
tional issues.
Junior Karen Matsouka, one of TEACh's co
founders, described the organization as an "out
growth" of Teach For America, emphasizing that it
is currently guided by two main principles.
"Firstly, we intend to increase campus awareness
with regard to children's educational issues, specifi
cally (those surrounding) inequalities and under
resourced areas. Secondly, we intend to take action
in local communities," Matsuka said.
