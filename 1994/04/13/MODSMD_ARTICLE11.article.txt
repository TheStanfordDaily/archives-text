Antibiotics recalled
WASHINGTON (AP) — Bristol-Myers
Squibb Co. began recalling its liquid oral
antibiotics from pharmacies yesterday
after foreign objects were found in some
bottles, the F(x>d and Drug Administra
tion said.
Consumers should stop using the prod
ucts and consult a health-care profession
al, the FDA said.
The antibiotics are named Polymox
O/S, Trimox O/S, Betapen-V/K O/S,
Veetids O/S, Principen O/S and Pollycillin
O/S.
Small plastic caps have been found in
some containers and could cause choking,
the FDA said.
The products are sold to pharmacies in
powdered form and reconstituted before
being dispensed to customers.
No injuries have been reported so far,

said Betsy Adams, an FDA spokeswoman.
Refugees express sorrow
KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) — More than
100,000 refugees bent by the weight of
their last possessions streamed south of
Kigali yesterday in a slow river of human
misery that stretched for more than five
miles.
A convoy of a dozen luxury cars, appar
ently loaded with high government offi
cials, raced past the refugees, heading
toward Burundi with their escorts of
armored cars and truckloads of nervous
Rwandan soldiers.
The exodus appeared to include almost
half the capital's 250,000 residents,
caught in the grip of a murderous terror
since Rwanda's president and his Burundi
counterpart were mysteriously killed at
the Kigali airport last week.
