# Mitchell withdraws from search
## Fears Supreme Court position would hinder health care reform 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Clinton's Supreme Court search was
scrambled yesterday as Senate Majority
Leader George Mitchell abruptly with
drew from consideration. Mitchell said
he was convinced taking the job might
hurt the chances of health care reform
passing this year.
In bowing out, Mitchell said Clinton
had told him Monday night he was
inclined to nominate the 60-year-old
Maine Democrat for the vacancy created
by Justice Harry A. Blackmun's retire
ment.
Rut Mitchell said Clinton "reluctant
ly accepted" his assessment that he
might not be able to undergo the
demanding confirmation process and
keep his promise to shepherd health
care reform through the Senate this
year.

Mitchell served briefly as a federal
judge in his native Maine, and his polit
ical skills were viewed as an important
asset on a court narrowly divided on
many controversial issues. But Clinton
accepted Mitchell's judgment that nom
inating him now "would have had an
adverse impact on their shared agenda,"
said White House press secretary Dee
Dee Myers.
While casting the development as a
disappointment that set the search back
a few steps, administration officials said
Clinton had been aware from the outset
that legal or legislative obstacles could
foreclose a Mitchell nomination. "We've
always maintained some flexibility,"
said Myers.
U.S. District Judge Jose Cabranes of
Connecticut was said to be high on Clin
ton's list. Solicitor General Drew S.

Days 111 is another contender, as are at
least two federal appeals court judges,
Richard Arnold of Arkansas and Amalya
Kearse of New York.
Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt said
last week he did not want to be consid
ered, and Education Secretary Richard
Riley made the same request last year.
Both Babbitt and Riley are former gov
ernors.
Speaking to reporters on Capitol Hill,
Mitchell said Clinton had "reluctantly
accepted" his assessment that he could
not guarantee the attention necessary
to steer a suitable health care bill to pas
sage while preparing to join the court in
October.
Clinton advisers said that there was
no firm timetable for filling the vacancy
but that it would be a few weeks at
most.
