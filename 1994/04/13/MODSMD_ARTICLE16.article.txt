## A 						lonely American in Paris 
### 
IWAS ONE of those females in high
school who never went to the bath
room alone. I always dragged an
entourage of friends, our purses full of
multi-colored eye shadow sets and hair
spray in hand.
In fact, I never did anything alone.
Never went to a class, saw a movie, or
even took a walk by myself. Heaven for
bid I should be solely responsible and
accountable for my actions and deci
sions.
So when my long-awaited chance to
travel to Europe arose between my win
ter and spring quarters at Stanford in
Oxford, the question came up of who I
was going to latch onto to stumble my
way through completely foreign coun
tries.
But somewhere along the line, I decid
ed I had to spend at least some of my
vacation traveling alone. I wanted the
challenge, the freedom, the chance to
think, reflect and figure out things — to
"find myself," if you will — but really,
most of all, I needed to prove to myself
that I wasn't the chicken who took her
support crew with her to the bathroom.
After all, I was 20 years old, almost a col
lege graduate, independent, educated . . .
As my departure date for Paris
approached, I was scared. What was I
doing? I was beginning my trip alone,
plunging straight into the foreign, con
fusing world of the European continent
with only a Eurail pass, a few hundred
dollars, the clothes on my back and a

back pack full of clothes and underwear.
Lingering through the galleries of the
Louvre seemed less enticing as I sudden
ly found myself bombarded with stories
of rude Parisians, the difficulties faced
by non-French speakers (I knew about
three words in French) and the perils
faced by women traveling alone.
However, before I had a chance to
reconsider, I found myself on a hover
boat, crossing the English Channel, not a
familiar face in sight.
So yes, those first 15 minutes finding
my way through the Paris Metro were
disorienting. My attempts to get by on
my negligible French vocabulary were
intimidating and the one incident of ver
bal sexual harassment I encountered was
disturbing (but one important lesson I
learned while traveling is that an Ameri
can-style flip-off transcends all language
barriers).
But I found that I loved the freedom
of making all my own decisions — even
so, the best part about traveling alone
was that I really wasn't alone at all.
There were moments that I found to rec
ollect and ponder in solitude as I had
envisioned, but these were few and far
between.
During that week, I discussed NAFTA
with a Welsh political science student,
soccer with an Argentine whose brother
was playing in the World Cup and Luke
Perry and Shannen Doherty with Italian
"Beverly Hills, 90210" fans. (The show is
everywhere. It's asinine.)

I climbed the Sacre Coeur Cathedral,
discussed religion and family, ate dinner
and drank too much wine at a Greek
restaurant with a Canadian woman and
then we stayed up late comparing driv
er's licenses with German and Austrian
travelers. I listened to live jazz in a con
verted dungeon with a Japanese art stu
dent and learned to dance (the swing)
from the Italian "90210" fans.
And despite my embarrassing igno
rance of the French language, almost all
of the Parisians I encountered were
more than happy to offer directions, rec
ommendations and, even once, imported
dates from a fruit stand.
As I moved on to Italy and Spain and
traveled with friends, I realized that
while I enjoyed the security and compan
ionship, I really wasn't meeting people
anymore — at least not in the same way.
There were some lonely and maybe a
couple of scary moments during my
excursion through Paris, but the height
ened awareness of my surroundings, the
experiences I would otherwise would not
have had and the people I would not have
met were more than worth it.

Angie is secretly happy that she is able to
keep up with "90210" story lines while
she is at Stanford in Oxford.
