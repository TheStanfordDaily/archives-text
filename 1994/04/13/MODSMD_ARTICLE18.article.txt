# Senators' sweatshirts
## 
### 
Constitutional Amendment: Senate Bill XXIV-A&R-20
(DYES O NO
To increase accountability and accessbility of senators by making them wear identifying
sweatshirts.

GIVEN THE current sorry
state of affairs, anything
that improves the account
ability and visibility of ASSU sena
tors is a wise move. Constitutional
Amendment/Senate Bill XXIV
CAS, which would force senators
to wear a "uniform" on the days of
senate meetings, is a step in the
right direction.

Consisting of "an oatmeal color"
sweatshirt, the uniform would
read "What is an ASSU Senator?"
(on the front) and "I'm an ASSU
Senator, silly!" (on the back). The
shirt would also advertise the loca
tion and time of the meetings.
This plan is inexpensive and
efficient â€” students should vote
for it.
