# ASSU miscalculation results in MEChA special-fee error
## Fee request on ballot $17K higher than group's budget total

The special-fee request for campus
Chicano/Latino student association
MEChA appearing on today's ASSU
election ballot is accidentally listed at
nearly 30 percent more than the amount
intended by the group's leaders, MEChA
and ASSU officials admitted last night.
In an extraordinary and nearly over
looked glitch, MEChA's fee request was
printed as $56,495.80 in the ASSU elec
tion handbook, The Daily and on the

election ballot. That is almost $17,000
more than the $39,546.85 sum the group
originally submitted to the ASSU's Ap
propriations Committee for approval
more than two months ago.
The inflation of MEChA's request
stemmed from a series of miscalcula
tions, miscommunications and missteps
by both MEChA leaders and members of
the committee. But, somewhat remark
ably, the mistake did not catch the atten
tion of either group until yesterday's
Daily endorsement of a "No" vote on
MEChA's request.

Despite protestations by MEChA offi
cials last night, Elections Commissioner
Tom Tsao said that "unless God spoke,"
the incorrect request would remain on
the ballot for the election, which began at
12 a.m. this morning and runs until mid
night Thursday. Indeed, the larger fig
ure appeared on ballots filled by voters
early this morning.
"For me to change the ballot two and
a half hours before it goes out — it would
take drastic measures by the senate," he
said. "I don't forsee a change [in
the ballot] just because some peo
ple say, 'I made a boo-boo.' We're
ready to vote."
Sophomore Nicole Vazquez,
MEChA's treasurer, said the group
would discuss "some sort of collec
tive action" if its fee is rejected by
students this week, including con
testing the result with the senate.
"We have to take that into consider
ation As far as we're concerned,
the special fee is very important."
Meanwhile, The Daily today
withdrew its non-endorsement of
the groups request and instead will
offer no recommendation on the
issue.
The problems surrounding the
MEChA request began in Febru
ary, when representatives from
student groups presented their
proposed budgets to the senate's
Appropriations Committee. In cal
culating their expected expenses
for next year, MEChA officials
added 30 percent to the base costs
of each line-item on their budget.
The 30 percent figure is the
amount the ASSU recommends
student groups add to their bud
gets to account for student
refunds. Most groups tally their
"net" special fee when submitting
their budgets to appropriations —
that is, without adding the 30 per

cent buffer. MEChA, however,
accounted for the buffer in each
item, thus arriving at a "gross"
request of $39,546.85.
The committee, however,
assumed the $39,546.85 sum was
MEChA's net request, and as a
result independently added 30 per
cent to that amount, bringing
MEChA's total fee to $56,495.80.
Whether that error was either
recognized or discussed during the
meeting is unclear. "There was a lot
of confusion at the Appropriations
Committee meeting," Vazquez said.
Graduate senator Sanford Dickert,
chair of the committee, said both
parties discussed correction of the
bloated request, but for some rea
son, neither followed through.
"We assumed they were going to
do it, and they assumed we were
going to do it," Dickert said. "It was
a miscommunication." He added
that "there was no attempt Iby
MEChA] to slip anything under the
table. They were the most meticu
lous, documented group of all that
we saw."
But the miscue could still have
been corrected at the Feb. 15 sen
ate meeting, when the entire body
reviewed the budget submissions.
However, neither appropriations
members nor MEChA representa
tives, all of whom were present,
noticed the gaffe, which by now
was plainly printed as the bottom
line of the group's request.
Dickert maintained that his
committee, in presenting the bud

gets to the senate, was more con
cerned with "whether they had the
right calculation of the refund
rates," not whether the request
themselves were correct. Vazquez
and fellow treasurer Nancy Salas,
meanwhile, left the meeting before
the MEChA request, which was
near the bottom of the night's
agenda, came up for discussion.
Subsequently, the ASSU elec
tion handbook, released last week,
reflects the rather bizarre series of
events that surrounded the
MEChA request. In its reprinting
of the group's budget, the hand
book includes two figures — one,
MEChA's original request, and the
other, the incorrectly ASSU
adjusted sum — for both gross and
net special fee. The final figure,
however, and the one that appears
on the ballot, is $56,495.80.
But even that was not contested
until yesterday, when The Daily
recommended that voters reject
MEChA's request, quoting the
inflated figure, which would consti
tute a more than $20,000 increase
over last year's request.
Tsao maintained that there is
no other error "of this magnitude"
on the ballot. But he remained
unmoved by MEChA's llth-hour
appeals to correct the mistake,
claiming that it was simply too late
to make changes to the ballot.
"This should have been taken
care of a month ago by whomever
should have been in charge of this
thing," he said.
