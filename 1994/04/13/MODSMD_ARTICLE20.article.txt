# Special-fee requests
## 
### 
In reaching its special-fee endorse
ments, The Daily editorial board met
with representatives from each organi
zation requesting special fees these past
two weekends. The editorial board is
composed of eight members, including
Daily editors, staff members and at
large community members. The board
grilled representatives on relevant mat
ters (budgets, participation, fund rais
ing efforts, among others), which dif
fered from group to group, depending
on the nature and purpose of the orga
nization. The editorial board discussed
these meetings extensively afterward to
reach a majority decision.
Few groups this year demonstrated
any awareness of this year's trend of
spiraling special-fee refunds. Some
groups were hit harder than others.
However, most groups ignored the sig
nal that students are becoming more
thrifty with their ASSU money, and
continued to budget up to the maxi
mum allowable increase.
These inflated fees reveal a funda
mental flaw in the system. Spiraling
special-fee refund rates do not induce
groups to lower their requests, change
their outreach efforts, fund raise, or re
evaluate their budgets — instead, they
cause groups to cushion themselves
even more with the built-in expectation
of a larger refund rate. At this pace,
students will be forced to pay more
each year, with no cap in sight, in a sys
tem that will be unable to sustain itself
much longer.
The endorsements below do not
question mission, but rather, method.
While almost all the groups are valu
able and certainly worthwhile, the
question to ask is, do they use the
funds in the wisest ways? For example,
do they try to economize? And are their
line items reasonable? If not, there's

little to do about it anyway. It's an all
or-nothing situation. Because the edi
torial board recognizes the inherent
inadequacy of the current fee-refund
system, the recommendations reflect
the absolute nature of the process.
In making its recommendations on
ASSU special fee requests, The Daily edi
torial board used five guiding criteria:
• Whether the group demonstrated ini
tiative in self-funding (that is, whether
its budget reflects that it is actively
seeking revenue sources other than the
special fee)
• Whether the group has tightened its
budget in response to refunds
• Whether the group has made a con
scientious effort to involve members of
the Stanford community
• Whether the group's methods to its
goal are a good value for the dollar
• Whether the student body — and not
the University or other parties —
should be funding the group's mission
If the group in question met these
criteria well, it received a "yes."
If it did not meet the criteria suffi
ciently, the group's special fee request
was given a "no."
Groups that met some well, but
failed on others, received a "without
recommendation," meaning that
The Daily editorial board could not con
fidently endorse the group either way.
A "no recommendation" signals
that the editorial board did not meet
with the group representative and
could not make an endorsement.
The annual cost per student in
parentheses was estimated using this
year's total enrollment figure of
14,002. Next year's total special fee
per student per quarter is estimated to
be about $45 for each student, up from
about $37 this year. And that assumes
that XXII-A&R-8, the proposed special
fee amendment, does not pass.
