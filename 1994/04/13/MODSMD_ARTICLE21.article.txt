($11.51)

The Program Board provides funding to
help student groups put on various
events. It considers each request careful
ly, and usually cannot fully fund all groups
that qualify. This year, it was in a tight sit
uation because only 30 percent of funds
to be given out were placed in the discre
tionary — as opposed to annual — bud
get. Next year, the budget will be adjust
ed to give more to discretionary funding, a
smart move. Students should vote to
slightly increase funding to help the Board
keep up with demand.

This organization funds community ser
vice projects that meet its carefully
defined criteria. Recently, demand for
funding has been light enough to allow
the Board to completely fund most
requests. The Board provides a valuable
service, but does not need any more
funding at this time.

Board ($3.60)

The Publications Board — which helps to
fund student publications like the Stanford
Review and Chaparral — desperately needs
more money. Currently, it has only $4,500 in
discretionary funding per quarter, a fraction of
the sum of requests that it receives When
students vote, they will have two choices: to
increase its annual funding to $158,200,
which amounts to an estimated $7.70
increase per student, or to adjust the funding
level by one of several set percentages The
Publications Board does a good job, but ask
ing for a tnpling of its funding in just one year
is too risky. Students should vote for the next
highest increase — 50 percent
