## Supercooled helium reveals possible new state of matter Scientists describe vortex-filled intermediate fluid state 
### Corinna Wu 
Helium is familiar to us as the
gas that makes party balloons rise
and, more amusingly, that allows
a normal human being to do
impressions of the Chipmunks
when it is inhaled.
But when helium is cooled to a
few degrees Kelvin above absolute
zero, it becomes a superfluid — a
liquid that loses all of its viscosity.
"Theoretically, if you connect
ed a pipe in a ring, the superfluid
would flow around it infinitely,"
said Shouchang Zhang, associate
professor of physics and consult
ing assistant professor of applied
physics.
In transforming from a liquid
to a superfluid, helium passes
through an intermediate phase.
Zhang argues that this phase is an
entirely new state of matter —
existing in addition to more tradi
tional states such as gasses and
solids.
His theory claims that thin
films of helium fluid contain a lat
tice of whirlpools, or vortices,
spaced in an array similar to the
sodium and chlorine atoms in
salt.
The vortices spin in both clock
wise and counterclockwise direc
tions. According to Zhang, they
create a net balance in "vorticity,"
just like the positive and negative
charges found in an ionic crystal
like salt create a balance of
charge.
The superfluid state of matter

is, in many ways, analogous to the
superconductivity which some
materials exhibit when cooled. In
that case, however, it is the elec
trons that can move freely rather
than the entire fluid.
In fact, much of the interest in
superfluidity arises from its simi
larity to superconductivity.
"Superconductors are simply
superfluids that are charged,"
said Aharon Kapitulnik, associate
professor of physics and applied
physics.
Kapitulnik independently
came up with a theory analogous
to Zhang's in order to describe
unusual behavior observed in
two-dimensional superconduc
tors. Now, he and Zhang are col
laborating in order to refine the
theory as it applies to both super
fluids and superconductors.
To create a vortex within a
bulk fluid, scientists can essen
tially just spin the material at
high speeds. However, in a thin
film of superfluid, vortices are
created by heating it slightly.
Independent of the amount of
heating, Zhang and Kapitulnik
found an equal number of vortices
and anti-vortices, spinning in
opposite directions.
The arrangement of the vor
tices in a lattice gives this possible
new state of matter solid-like
properties.
"There is one property which is
very unique to solids called the
shear modulus," Kapitulnik said.
"The experimental results on this

fluid can be explained as resis
tance to shear.
"If you detect a shear modulus,
this is a solid," he added, pointing
to the variety of new properties
exhibited by the state created
when a superfluid is heated in this
manner.
In an ionic solid, such as sodi
um chloride, the nature of the
entire crystal can be determined
by examining only two of its com
ponent atoms: one positively
charged sodium atom and one
negatively charged chlorine atom,
for example.
The attractive electrostatic
force between oppositely charged
atoms and the repulsive force
from like charges creates two
counterbalancing forces which
prevail throughout the crystal.
At some point, a minimum
energy is reached — where the
forces exactly coincide so that the
ions are maintained in a lattice.
Here, the distance between each
pair of atoms — the lattice con
stant — is established. This con
stant remains the same through
out the crystal's structure.
According to Kapitulnik, this
classical repulsive force is missing
among the vortices found in the
newly proposed state of matter.
"Two of these objects separate
ly have very different properties
than the crystal as a whole,"
Kapitulnik said, meaning that the
structure of the entire lattice can
not be determined from only two
components as in a salt crystal.

"These (vortices] can go as
much as they want through each
other, then they annihilate," he
said. By the time the distance
between the centers of two vor
tices becomes zero, "the energy
becomes infinitely negative, and
basically they are gone."
However, in order to maintain
some type of lattice structure
among the vortices, Kapitulnik
said the material must contain
some force holding them in place.
"The problem in this new state
is that you need a mechanism to
produce the repulsive force," he
said. "We both agree that this is
something that has to do with

quantum mechanics."
Kapitulnik added that there
must be "a collective effect that
gives it [the] repulsion you need
in order to produce this [energy]
minimum" and create a lattice.
The lattice of vortices exists in
thin film superfluids only within a
narrow temperature window
between about 0.6 and 1 degree
Kelvin above absolute zero,
according to Zhang.
If the temperature is too low,
there aren't enough vortices to
achieve the collective stabilizing
effect, and the helium simply
becomes a superfluid without the
vortices described by Zhang and

Kapitulnik.
If, on the other hand, the tem
perature is too high, the structure
is destroyed. Just as heating a
solid causes the atoms to become
more disordered, the vortices are
no longer held in any sort of struc
ture, and they are free to cancel
each other out.
The existence of this interme
diate phase was discovered two
years ago by researchers at the
University of Illinois at Urbana-
Champaign. The most recent
results by this group seem to sup
port Zhang and Kapitulnik's theo
ries about how the state is both
created and maintained.

energy is reached — where the
forces exactly coincide so that the
ions are maintained in a lattice.
Here, the distance between each
pair of atoms — the lattice con
stant — is established. This con
stant remains the same through
out the crystal's structure.
According to Kapitulnik, this
classical repulsive force is missing
among the vortices found in the
newly proposed state of matter.
"Two of these objects separate
ly have very different properties
than the crystal as a whole,"
Kapitulnik said, meaning that the
structure of the entire lattice can
not be determined from only two
components as in a salt crystal.

"These (vortices] can go as
much as they want through each
other, then they annihilate," he
said. By the time the distance
between the centers of two vor
tices becomes zero, "the energy
becomes infinitely negative, and
basically they are gone."
However, in order to maintain
some type of lattice structure
among the vortices, Kapitulnik
said the material must contain
some force holding them in place.
"The problem in this new state
is that you need a mechanism to
produce the repulsive force," he
said. "We both agree that this is
something that has to do with

quantum mechanics."
Kapitulnik added that there
must be "a collective effect that
gives it [the] repulsion you need
in order to produce this [energy]
minimum" and create a lattice.
The lattice of vortices exists in
thin film superfluids only within a
narrow temperature window
between about 0.6 and 1 degree
Kelvin above absolute zero,
according to Zhang.
If the temperature is too low,
there aren't enough vortices to
achieve the collective stabilizing
effect, and the helium simply
becomes a superfluid without the
vortices described by Zhang and

Kapitulnik.
If, on the other hand, the tem
perature is too high, the structure
is destroyed. Just as heating a
solid causes the atoms to become
more disordered, the vortices are
no longer held in any sort of struc
ture, and they are free to cancel
each other out.
The existence of this interme
diate phase was discovered two
years ago by researchers at the
University of Illinois at Urbana-
Champaign. The most recent
results by this group seem to sup
port Zhang and Kapitulnik's theo
ries about how the state is both
created and maintained.

Helium is familiar to us as the
gas that makes party balloons rise
and, more amusingly, that allows
a normal human being to do
impressions of the Chipmunks
when it is inhaled.
But when helium is cooled to a
few degrees Kelvin above absolute
zero, it becomes a superfluid — a
liquid that loses all of its viscosity.
"Theoretically, if you connect
ed a pipe in a ring, the superfluid
would flow around it infinitely,"
said Shouchang Zhang, associate
professor of physics and consult
ing assistant professor of applied
physics.
In transforming from a liquid
to a superfluid, helium passes
through an intermediate phase.
Zhang argues that this phase is an
entirely new state of matter —
existing in addition to more tradi
tional states such as gasses and
solids.
His theory claims that thin
films of helium fluid contain a lat
tice of whirlpools, or vortices,
spaced in an array similar to the
sodium and chlorine atoms in
salt.
The vortices spin in both clock
wise and counterclockwise direc
tions. According to Zhang, they
create a net balance in "vorticity,"
just like the positive and negative
charges found in an ionic crystal
like salt create a balance of
charge.
The superfluid state of matter

is, in many ways, analogous to the
superconductivity which some
materials exhibit when cooled. In
that case, however, it is the elec
trons that can move freely rather
than the entire fluid.
In fact, much of the interest in
superfluidity arises from its simi
larity to superconductivity.
"Superconductors are simply
superfluids that are charged,"
said Aharon Kapitulnik, associate
professor of physics and applied
physics.
Kapitulnik independently
came up with a theory analogous
to Zhang's in order to describe
unusual behavior observed in
two-dimensional superconduc
tors. Now, he and Zhang are col
laborating in order to refine the
theory as it applies to both super
fluids and superconductors.
To create a vortex within a
bulk fluid, scientists can essen
tially just spin the material at
high speeds. However, in a thin
film of superfluid, vortices are
created by heating it slightly.
Independent of the amount of
heating, Zhang and Kapitulnik
found an equal number of vortices
and anti-vortices, spinning in
opposite directions.
The arrangement of the vor
tices in a lattice gives this possible
new state of matter solid-like
properties.
"There is one property which is
very unique to solids called the
shear modulus," Kapitulnik said.
"The experimental results on this

fluid can be explained as resis
tance to shear.
"If you detect a shear modulus,
this is a solid," he added, pointing
to the variety of new properties
exhibited by the state created
when a superfluid is heated in this
manner.
In an ionic solid, such as sodi
um chloride, the nature of the
entire crystal can be determined
by examining only two of its com
ponent atoms: one positively
charged sodium atom and one
negatively charged chlorine atom,
for example.
The attractive electrostatic
force between oppositely charged
atoms and the repulsive force
from like charges creates two
counterbalancing forces which
prevail throughout the crystal.
At some point, a minimum
energy is reached — where the
forces exactly coincide so that the
ions are maintained in a lattice.
Here, the distance between each
pair of atoms — the lattice con
stant — is established. This con
stant remains the same through
out the crystal's structure.
According to Kapitulnik, this
classical repulsive force is missing
