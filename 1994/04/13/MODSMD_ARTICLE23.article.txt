# Research explains how muscles work
## 
### Michael Slemmer Editorial staff 
Stanford researchers can now pro
vide convincing evidence supporting the
theory which is now used to explain how
muscles perform their tasks at the
molecular level.
According to Biochemistry Prof.
James Spudich, who aided in the
research performed at the School of
Medicine, the experimental data that
has now been collected may allow future
scientists to understand just how mus
cles work.
The current theory used to describe
the action of these fibers, which are nec
essary to sustain even the most basic of
animal life, claims that two different
types of muscle protein act together to
generate motion.
The muscles themselves are made up
of long filaments made up of "actin"
proteins. In order to move, the hypothe
sis argues that groups of the other type
of protein, "myosin" proteins, grab hold
of the filaments and pull them in a par
ticular direction.
However, two points in the theory
have remained unclear — exactly how
the molecules in the proteins hold on to
each other and whether this interpreta
tion of what occurs within muscles is, in
fact, correct.
According to Jeffrey Finer, the Medi
cal School graduate student who
authored a paper explaining the group's
research, experimental evidence has
shown that the myosin protein can actu
ally act as a sort of motor, contracting
the muscle.
In addition, their study proved that
each myosin protein burns one molecule
of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) —
which acts as the energy source for most
of the body's cells — every time it pulls
on the actin strand.
This finding is likely to be important
because, according to Finer, many cur
rent researchers believe that "myosin is

capable of more than one stroke per
ATP."
The experiment to explain the struc
ture of muscle movement was per
formed in collaboration with Robert
Simmons, a professor of physiology in
London.
The researchers employed a device
allied "optical tweezers," which uses a
laser and motion detectors to trap parti
cles which are floating in a liquid —
allowing them to move the proteins to a
microscope slide for visual inspection.
In examining the muscle proteins,
they held two ends of a stained actin
fiber in place and then lowered it onto a
single molecule of myosin protein.
By putting both proteins in an ATP
containing solution, the scientists were
able to observe the myosin protein's
movement along the filament.
In this manner, using highly precise
instruments capable of viewing move

ment on the scale of billionths of a
meter, they were able to measure exact
ly how far the myosin protein moved.
The group also measured the force
exerted by the proteins in moving along
the filament — about five-trillionths of
a Newton. In comparison, the Earth's
gravity exerts about 9.8 Newtons of
downward force on a one-kilogram
object.
Though the researchers' detailed
observations provide proof for the cur
rent theory about how muscles operate,
Spundich explained that the actual pro
cesses involved in the "molecular
motor" which moves the proteins are
not well understood.
"This is the first measure of the
mechanical properties of the muscle
proteins at the level of single
molecules," Finer said. But the deeper
question of how the proteins actually
work remains unresolved.
