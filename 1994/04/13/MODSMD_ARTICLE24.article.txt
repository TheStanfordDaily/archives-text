# Breaking through the performance barrier
## Silicon-germanium chips promise faster computers

A Stanford researcher has set the
microelectronic industry abuzz with her
revelation that mixing germanium with
silicon can speed up and enhance the
performance of integrated circuits.
Judy Hoyt, a research associate in
electrical engineering, maintains that
using a silicon-germanium mix, rather
than pure silicon, allows electrons to
travel faster through transistors that
constitute the building block of integrat
ed circuits.
As a result, the use of germanium
could lead to production of faster and
more powerful computer chips and other
microelectronic devices by improving
their performance at the most basic
level.
Hoyt presented her findings at the
spring meeting of the American Physical
Society, held in Pittsburgh March 21. In
her speech, she said that "the silicon
germanium field has been around for a
while.
"Today, [these] integrated circuits
are on the verge of commercialization,"
she added, pointing to the vast possibili
ties for this technological improvement.
Researchers have discovered in recent
studies that transistors using silicon
germanium alloys can transmit approxi
mately 60 percent faster than those with
pure silicon.
According to Hoyt, silicon-germani
um is close to commercialization in the
market for bipolar transistors, which are
used in high-power equipment like
telecommunications devices and ampli

fiers.
This growing popularity of silicon
germanium comes at a time when previ
ous modes of circuit innovation are
becoming increasingly obsolete.
In the past, improvements in inte
grated circuits mainly came from mina
turization. But experts now say that the
size of transistors in chips has become so
small that further shrinking is nearly
impossible.
As chips become smaller and transis
tors are squeezed closer together, inter
ference becomes more likely, research
ers contend.
The use of silicon-germanium, how
ever, would not affect the size of the cir
cuits. Moreover, the alloy is less expen
sive to fabricate into chips than semi
conductor materials that have also been
proven faster than silicon, including gal
lium arsenide.
While silicon-germanium has proven
faster and more effective than pure sili
con, implementing the alloy in the short
term may be difficult. Because the ger
manium atoms are larger than silicon
atoms, they can strain the material's
crystalline structure and limit the thick
ness of the layers that can be grown
without detrimental effects.
Hoyt said significant progress is being
made in the development of metal oxide
chips — usually used in computers —
that utilize germanium-silicon alloys,
but the technology may still require
more time.
She and her Stanford colleagues have
already produced metal-oxide transis
tors that mobilize electrons 180 times
faster than those using pure silicon.
