## Late-inning rally powers Cardinal Homers by Olmstead, Allen blow game wide open during five-run seventh

Revenge and momentum.
The No. 10 Cardinal baseball team,
using a five-run seventh inning to break
open a 2-2 tie, downed the University of
San Francisco Dons 7-3 yesterday at
Sunken Diamond. With the victory, Stan
ford (24-15) avenged an 18-5 loss to the
Dons two weeks ago and captured its sixth
win in eight games.
While the Cardinal never trailed and
continued to show signs of an offensive
awakening with three home runs, the con
test was close through the seventh-inning
stretch and could have gone the way of
USF (16-21) if not for a crucial sequence
in the top of the sixth.
With Stanford holding a 2-0 lead, the
Cardinal coaching staff lifted junior
starter Matt Marenghi, who had scattered
three hits over five innings and stood to

get the win. Freshman Ben Rada came on
and surrendered two singles and a walk to
put the Dons on the scoreboard. After
USF junior catcher Rich Crawford sacri
ficed the runners to second and third,
Rada plunked junior pinch hitter Larry
Pasero to load the bases.
Freshman Brendan Sullivan then
relieved Rada, only to hit Dons junior
third baseman Roberto Garcia and bring
in the tying run. But Sullivan, a subma
rine-style right-hander, quickly recovered
and struck out senior shortstop Ricardo
Baneulos to end the threat. The Dons
managed to put two runners on base in
both the eighth and ninth, but could only
muster one run off the victorious Sullivan
(1-0), who picked up his first career Stan
ford win.
"It takes a while for hitters to adjust,
especially if you're only going through the
lineup once," said Sullivan of his whip-like
sidearm delivery. "And with our hitting

coming together, my job is easy — just to
go out and throw strikes."
Indeed, on the heels of a solid perfor
mance in Sunday's series finale at USC,
Cardinal bats enjoyed one big inning yes
terday in time to give Sullivan a little
breathing room on the mound. After Sul
livan retired the side in order in the top of
the seventh, Stanford tagged USF junior
starter George Kinard (0-4) as he began to
tire in the bottom half of the inning.
Sophomore catcher A.J. Hinch started
the Cardinal rally with a single to center,
and senior designated hitter Nate Olm
stead followed with his fourth home run
of the season, a blast off the scoreboard in
left field that drove home what would be
the game-winning runs.
"It was a fastball up and over the mid
dle of the plate, and I figured it would at
least get to the gap and had a chance of

defeat the Dons by supplying three hits and scoring one run.
