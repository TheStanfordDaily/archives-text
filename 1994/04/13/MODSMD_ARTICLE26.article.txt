# Chong small in stature, big in impact
## Freshman fights his way onto team despite 5-foot-10 frame 
### Kathryn Yang Senior staff writer 
He's not exactly Spud Webb or Muggsy
Bogues.
In fact, Stewart Chong is two inches taller
than Webb and six inches taller than Bogues.
But still, that's really nothing to brag about
when he's playing with men who tower
almost a foot above him.
Standing at a respectable 5-foot-10, the
volleyball world saw Chong's height as a dis
tinct disadvantage — despite him graduating
as Hawaii's Player of the Year last season.
As expected, Chong was not heavily
recruited after winning that honor, and the
freshman setter had almost considered going
to Harvard or the University of Pennsylvania
over Stanford — two schools which do not
have men's volleyball programs.
Instead, Chong, nicknamed Chilly Willy by
his teammates, was lured to the Farm by Cal
ifornia's mild weather. But more importantly,
there was also the chance of playing volleyball
for one of the top programs in the nation.
"Overall, I think my decision to come to
Stanford was more academic than athletic,
because I didn't even think I would make
team during the fall," he said.
Not that making the team was his only
obstacle, Chong almost didn't even receive an
invitation to try out for the Cardinal squad.
"[Coach Ruben Nieves] didn't really recruit
me," he said. "I got one of my former coaches
to call him and put in a good word for me. But
even after that, I was surprised when Ruben
called me and told me about the tryouts."
Nieves' side of the story is a little more flat
tering. "The thing that caught my attention
was a couple of phone calls I received from
people whose opinion I value very highly," he
said. "They told me, 'Ruben, he's only 5-10,
but he's a dynamite player, and you definitely
won't be disappointed.' "
And the rest is history.
After making the team, Chong has devel
oped into one of Stanford's most versatile and
dependable players off the bench. Often play
ing the role of the seventh man, Chong has
seen considerable playing time as a setter,
swing hitter and defensive specialist.
His natural position however, is setting,
and he was given a chance to prove his worth
during a three-game homestand at the begin
ning of the season.
"When Canyon [Ceman] was injured early
in the season, Stewart was pressed into a
starting role," Nieves said. "At that point we
didn't know what kind of team we were, but
he won the second, third and fourth games of
the season for us and started us off on the
right foot with that critical contribution."
Tallying 66 sets against UC-Irvine on Jan.
31, Chong paced the Cardinal to an easy 15-7,
15-11, 17-15 victory over the Anteaters. After
that impressive performance, Chong was
given another start against San Diego State
the next week. Living up to everyone's expec
tations, Chong contributed 68 sets and a
team-high eight digs in coordinating Stan
ford's five-game winner. The freshman then

capped off his collegiate debut with 46 sets
against UC-San Diego on Feb. 5.
"He played and competed very well against
the big guys, because he compensates with his
tremendous jumping abilities," Nieves said.
"He's very quick, agile and coordinated, so
when he's in the air, he know exactly how to
control his body and where to put his hands.
He uses every bit of height he obtains on his
jump, whereas some players get up high and
even higher, but don't have the coordination
and control to make complete use of their
jumping ability and size.
"But even with that, he shouldn't be as
good as he is."
Since Ceman's return to the lineup, Chong
has also experimented with a couple starts as
a swing hitter, before settling into his current
backrow-specialist role.

Occasionally, however, Chong gets the
opportunity to play in relief of Ceman at the
setting position. Against Hawaii last week,
Stanford struggled early on and Nieves sub
stituted Chong for Ceman to shake up the
Cardinal lineup.
"I knew that things weren't going well, and
it wasn't any particular player — we just
needed a change," Chong said. "So Aaron
[Garcial and I went in, and Aaron passed real
ly well so I could set our hitters. After that,
Canyon went back in and sealed up the win."
According to Nieves, "We put Canyon back
late in the match, but Stewart was the one
who got us out of the hole, into the lead and
into position to win that match."
