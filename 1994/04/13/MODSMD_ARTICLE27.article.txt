# Women's rugby heads to Western Regionals
## Club team looking for second straight trip to national championship 
### Cindy Buchner 
After a long winter, the Stan
ford women's rugby team hopes
to repeat its showing as the west
ern region's representative at the
Women's Rugby National Cham
pionships. But first it must prove
its worth at this weekend's quali
fying tournament, the Pacific
Coast Collegiate Playoffs at Reed
College in Portland, Ore.
Last year, the women's rugby
team had an exciting season
which not only included earning
the spot to go to nationals, but
also finishing fourth in the tour
nament in a close-fought game.
But the team has some good rea
sons to be more excited this year.

"I think we have a pretty good
chance to make it to nationals,"
said junior Louise Grotenhuis.
"Out of the 12 teams there, prob
ably Oregon State or Washington
State will give us the most trou
ble."
Its most recent victory quanti
fied the team's improvement and
added to its enthusiasm. Display
ing their dedication, the women
stayed the weekend after winter
quarter finals to host a game
against Air Force. Stanford con
trolled the ball and won 15-7.
This is especially significant
because Air Force was the second
place finisher at the National
Championships last year.
Because collegiate women's

rugby teams are so scarce in Cali
fornia, Stanford plays in the
Northern California Rugby Con
ference, which is predominantly
composed of women's club teams.
These club teams are high caliber
and provide the Cardinal with
experience against seasoned
teams. This year Stanford's
improvement has been marked
by closer games against these
club teams than in previous
years.
The team is still young, but is
gaining experience. There were
more than 10 freshmen who con
tributed to last year's achieve
ments and now have another
valuable year of experience with
the sport. Also returning is senior

Elizabeth Bassett, who was
named to the All-Star team at
nationals last year.
"The team is a strong con
tender this year," Bassett said.
"We have three freshman who are
definitely assets."
Another asset to the team this
year is Coach Desmond Latham.
According to Grotenhuis, Latham
has added considerable energy to
the team with his encouragement.
Unfortunately, he is only here for
one year, as he is a visiting Knight
Fellow.
"Our forwards are very solid,
usually controlling scrums for
us," Grotenhuis said. "By doing
that, it helps out our backs, who
are amazingly fast."
