# Down to the last Straw
## Dodgers' Strawberry should be gone, period 
### 
Darryl Strawberry has no
place in the Major Leagues.
Last week, it was revealed
that Strawberry, a substantially
well-paid outfielder for the Los
Angeles Dodgers baseball club,
was AWOL from the final game
of the exhibition "Freeway
Series" with the California
Angels.
His reason? Drugs.
Drugs had overpowered him
and prevented him from doing
his job. Not just any job, but as a
professional baseball player, an
occupation that pays him the
tidy sum of $4 million per
annum to hit a ball with a stick.
If it were any other job, the
employer would tell Straw,
"Well, too bad for you. You're
supposed to show up for work
and you didn't. You're fired."
But because he is a baseball
player, he wasn't fired. He was
criticized, but he was not dis
missed. Darryl let the team
down, but no matter. Darryl
cares only about Darryl.
His selfish attitude would be
somewhat palatable, for
instance, if he were playing an
individual sport, such as golf.
For example, John Daly is an
alcoholic. He admitted it, took
some time off to deal with it, and
now is back on the PGA tour.
But Straw is on a team, where
each player has a role. Evident
ly, Straw thought his role was
primary, and his actions were
his alone, regardless of the con
sequence to others.
Rather than losing his job,
though, Straw will enter a sub
stance-abuse clinic to cope with
his "problem." And the Dodgers
will pay for it. Straw will just
keep cashing in those monthly

$330,000 checks. The team is
paying for his therapy, when he
is not fulfilling his end of the
contract! Not only should the
Dodgers suspend him without
pay, they should remove him
from the roster altogether.
Straw is a public figure.
Therefore, his actions as they

affect his public life are a public
matter. If he were a candidate
for political office, Straw would
be vilified â€” by the press and by
his peers.
But on the Field of Dreams,
the press has been quiet, his
teammates numb. Only manager
Tommy Lasorda has spoken any
harsh words of criticism, while
general manager Fred Claire has
expressed his "disappointment."
Straw is by no means a valued
member of the Los Angeles com
munity. Earlier this year, when
fires ravaged Laguna Beach,
Straw made a comment to the
effect of "I hope all those rich
people's houses burn down."
Yes, true words of wisdom from
an overpaid ballplayer trying to
identify with the masses. Last I
checked, Straw, your income
falls into the same tax bracket as
those darned "rich people."
Maybe by doing drugs Straw
