# Individual performances highlight Fresno Invite
## Track gearing up for late-season rush 
### Jorge Chen 
As the Stanford track and field
squad fires up for the big outdoor
meets coming up, the team made
a stop at the Fresno Invitational
this weekend to sharpen up its
performances. As the meet was
non-scoring regarding team
standings, only individual perfor
mances were recorded.
Even without the services of
1992 Pacific 10 Conference ham
mer champion Dave Popejoy,
who missed the meet due to strep
throat, the throwing squad still
finished strongly. Pete Swanson
filled in Popejoy's leadership spot
with a 55-foot, 6-inch shot-put
toss, good for second place.
"We missed Dave a lot as far as
points are concerned since he was
always up there scoring for us,"
Swanson said.
Other notable performances in
the men's throwing team includ
ed senior Toby Norwood's third
place hammer toss of 194", 10'.
On the track, sophomore All-
American Rene Rodriguez broke
the tape with a first place run of
47.37 seconds in the 400 meters.
Despite his blue-ribbon showing,
his expectations were not totally
fulfilled.
"I wasn't too satisfied with my
performance this weekend."
Rodriguez said. "I know that I
could have done better."
While Rodriguez might not
have finished with the time he
had been aiming for, junior co

captain Tovi Abello expressed
mixed sentiments about his
showing. He flew over the hur
dles for a personal best in the 110
meter race with a time of 14.52
seconds, yet was disappointed
that his fifth place finish did not
boost the Cardinal's overall
score.
"I was happy with my perfor
mance because I cleared the hur
dles with controlled speed," he
said. "And I was really focused."
In the 1,500 meters, freshman
J.J. White impressed everyone
including head coach Vin Lanan
na by placing first with a time of
3:53.04.
On the women's side, the
highlight for the day came from
senior Jennifer McCormick with
a javelin flight of 160', 4" for sec
ond place in the event, despite
the field's windy and cold condi
tions.
This weekend's throw was an
average one," McCormick said.
Since it is early in the season,
most athletes are in a point
where they aren't displaying
peak performances but we will
see those later into the season."
This weekend's competition
provided needed experience as
the athletes will continue to
develop and gear up for the
championship meets coming up,
according to Lananna.
The first of these important
meets will be held April 15-17 at
Mt. San Antonio College in Wal
nut, Calif.
