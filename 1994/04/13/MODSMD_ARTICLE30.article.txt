# Bring on No. 1 USC
## Men's tennis dispatches Utah 6-1 
### Mike Langford Senior staff writer 
In a warm-up match before
this weekend's trip to southern
California, the Stanford men's
tennis team downed the Universi
ty of Utah 6-1 in a non-confer
ence dual match. But the Utes did
not go quietly.
"I didn't know what to expect,"
said sophomore Jim Thomas, who
saw action for the first time this
year at No. 3 singles and doubles.
"I saw that they beat San Jose
State pretty badly, but I really
didn't know what to expect."
It would have been safe to
expect a win in doubles. Thomas,
along with freshman partner
Grant Elliott, were the first team
off the courts after beating their
opponents, Utah's Ryan John
ston and Alex Buxton, 8-3.
Stanford's other two teams
soon followed suit. Senior Vimal
Patel and sophomore Jeff Salzen
stein outlasted their opponents,
Magnus Hjalmarson and Chris
tian Svensson, 8-6. The tandem
of seniors Mike Flanagan and
Chris Cocotos finished ahead of
Utah's Toby Curtis and Brian
Conner by the same score. The
three doubles wins gave Stanford
the initial doubles point.
In singles, Flanagan had the
easiest match of the day, winning
his fourth straight match by

dominating Curtis, 6-0, 6-2. In
yesterday's release of the Rolex
collegiate rankings, Flanagan's
singles ranking jumped from
ninth all the way to third in the
nation. Flanagan's dual match
record currently stands at 10-4.
At second singles, Salzenstein
lost for the first time in recent
history. In a three setter against
Utah's Hjalmarson, the No. 51-
ranked Salzenstein lost 6-3, 1-6,
4-6.
With senior Robert Devens'
presence required in class, No.
50-ranked Thomas moved up to
third singles, and came through
after a marathon match. In a 3-
1/2 hour three-set see-saw battle,
Thomas came out on top, beating
Conner 7-6, 6-7, 6-3.
"The actual points didn't take
so long," Thomas said about the
match. "He spent a lot of time in
between points, walking around
really slow after balls and that
kind of thing."
At fourth singles, Cocotos
exploded in the first set before his
opponent gave him a run in the
second, finally settling for a 6-0,
7-5 win over Johnston. Patel also
won at fifth singles by a 6-3, 6-4
margin over Utah's Svensson.
Sophomore Ricky Becker won
his second straight singles match
in a 6-3, 6-2 triumph over Bran
don Hodges. Becker's dual match
record stands at 7-1.
