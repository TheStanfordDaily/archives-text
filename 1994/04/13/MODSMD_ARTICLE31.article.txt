Women's Basketball
The strength of Stanford
women's basketball program
received great praise earlier
this week as five current and
former Cardinal players were
invited to try out for the 1994
USA Basketball Women's
National Team, which will be
coached by Stanford head
coach Tara VanDerveer.
Jennifer Azzi, Molly Good
enbour, Christy Hedgpeth,

Anita Kaplan and Val Whiting
give Stanford five possible
members out of the field of 54
invitees.
National Team Trials run
April 28-May 4 at the U.S.
Olympic Training Center in
Colorado Springs, Colo.
Only Tennessee landed
more players on the invitation
list than Stanford, as the Lady
Volunteers nabbed seven
spots.
