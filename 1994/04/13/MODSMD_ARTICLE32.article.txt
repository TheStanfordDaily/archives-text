# Former hostage to speak
## Anderson will recount seven years of Lebanese captivity 
### Laura Shin 
Terry Anderson, the American journalist held
hostage in Lebanon for seven years during the
1980s, will speak in Kresge Auditorium on April 22
at 4 p.m. Admission is free to all current students,
faculty and staff with a Stanford ID.
Tickets for the general public will go on sale
starting April 19, at the Tresidder box office. The
tickets will cost $5 each.
The ASSU Speakers Bureau is co-sponsoring
Anderson's speech with the Ford Motor Company
and the New York Times.
"We've been trying to get him to speak for about
a year now," said Melind John, director of the ASSU
Speakers Bureau. "We happened to catch him while
he was here in the Bay Area."
John said Ford and the Times — which together
have begun a campaign to "help students across the
country bring bigger-name speakers to their cam

puses" — will cover about a quarter of Anderson's
speaking fee and most publicity expenses. He said
this is the first time the two corporations have spon
sored a lecture at Stanford.
John surmised that Anderson would talk about
"his seven years of captivity and his strange relation
ship with his captors who might joke with him one day
and then torture him the next." Also, since he is famil
iar with the situation in the Middle East, John added
that he might discuss the prospects for peace there.
Anderson was the Associated Press Bureau Chief
of the Middle East at the time of his capture in Beirut
by Moslem extremists. His capture came to symbolize
the hostility toward the U.S. in the Middle East dur
ing the 1980s and the effort to gain his release was a
major element of American policy in the region.
He was liberated by his captors in late 1991 and
returned to the U.S. His book "Den of Lions"
recounts his experience as a hostage and was pub
lished last Christmas.
