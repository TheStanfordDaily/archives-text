When you've seen Fisherman's Wharf, eaten at Fresh Choice and hiked up to the Dish,
it's easy to think you've done it all. But as the academic machinery of spring quarter
grinds into life, we hope Off the Farm can help you get away to offbeat and obscure
Bay Area locations you never knew existed.
Visit the back roads of Marin County, or parachute out of an airplane at 13,500 feet. Dine at
some of Palo Alto's lesser-known eateries before spending the afternoon on the boardwalk in
Santa Cruz and the evening in a cozy bed and breakfast.
Come on. You're only young once, and four years at Stanford can go pretty fast, lake a
Friday afternoon to visit the Cherry Blossom Festival in San Francisco. Or ask that girl or guy
you've been eyeing across the Wilbur dining hall to go hiking or spend a day at Half Moon Bay
romance can happen at Stanford, and when it does, Off the Farm is chock full of ideas for the
ideally obscure date.
Fveryone says the Bay Area is a great place to go to school because there's so much to do
here. An hour in any direction can mean an entirely new environment. But nestled away on our
quiet campus among the palm tires, it's easy to forget that there's a whole world outside, just
waiting for you to visit.
We know there are times here when things get so busy that your only connection to Marin's
Muir Woods is a wooden cubicle in Green Library. But with California's springtime weather
beckoning just outside those big, glass library windows, it's worth it to take some time to explore
the surrounding territory.
So steal your roommate's car and head out to the coast for some rest and relaxation. The
library has been here for years; it will be waiting for you when you come back.
And when you come back, tanned and happy, don't say we didn't tell you so.
