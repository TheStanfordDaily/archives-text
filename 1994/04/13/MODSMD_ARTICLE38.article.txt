Fisherman's Wharf.
Seen it.
Cable cars.
Rode 'em.
Coit Tower.
Been there.
Golden Gate Bridge.
Done that.
After a couple dorm trips
to the City, the tourist traps
become, in a word, boring.
How many over-priced bowls
of clam chowder can one eat?
But yawn not, Farm dwellers,
San Francisco still has plenty
to offer.
You just have to look a lit
tle harder.
While most Stanfordites
wake up bright and early to go
to the City, why not turn that
logic on its head? If you leave
Stanford around 4 p.m., you
can beat the traffic and see die
sunset over the Bay. Fry The
Cliff House at 1090 Point
Lobos Ave. for a great view.
The place is actually three
restaurants: the early San
Francisco-style "Upstairs

at the Cliff House," the more
casual "Seaf(K)cl and Beverage
Company" and the old-style
pub "Phineas T. Barnacle."
The Barnacle has the best
views. The fare ranges from
American to seafood and
pasta, with dinners going from
$12 to $25. Reservations
accepted (386-3330).
After the sun goes down,
you can find several interest
ing nightspots nearby.
Fledgling yupsters let it all
hang out at the upscale meat
market Johnny Love's, at
1500 Broadway at Polk. If
you're looking for something a
little more funky, how about

The Tonga
Room at the

Fair m on t

Hotel
. (corner

of California
and Mason
Sts.) This Tiki
bar, which has
been described
as a "kitsch-o
rania bar cus
tom-made for
tou-rists" is
actually kind
of fun. It's got
a 1950s feci to
it, and your
drinks are
served with
fruit and those

funky paper umbrellas. The
waiters wear mumus, and a
simulated rainstorm occurs
often in the simulated lagoon.
As the evening wears on,
make your way to the Haight-
Ashbury district, but watch out
for your safety, especially if
you travel through the "pan
handle" section of
Golden Gate Park. If
you're feeling real
adventuresome, try

The Noc Noc at 557 Haight.
1 he interior looks like Fred
Flintstone might have decorat
ed it using modern materials.
There's a good selection of
beer, pins wine and sake. II
you're in town on a weekend,
check out The Deluxe, .it
1511 Haight. While there's .i
small cover ($3-sf)), the atmos
phere is worth it. It's a
19405-typc place, and tin
clientele (iresses the part. Ihe
music is swing or Sinatra.
When you're ready to
crash, head for the place
"where the summer of love
and today's world meet"
The Red Victorian Bed and

Breakfast Inn. Ixxrated .n
1665 Haight Street, this

blast from the 1970s is
run by a surprising

older woman, Sami
Sunchild, who carnc
to S.F". in 1976
after her

Hawaiian com
mune folded.
There are Iv< v


guest rooms, some with pri
vate baths. Stay in "the Flower
Child Room" (which has rain
bows, clouds and a sun paint
ed on the ceiling and '60s
posters on the walls); "The
Golden Gate Park Room"
(with cable car photos, bay
windows and a mirror on the
ceiling); or "The Peacock
Suite" (with a canopied king
bed and stained glass windows
"Fit for Ali Baba and his
love," the brochure says).
Rates range from $65 to $135
a night, and reservations (864-
1978) are recommended.
If you've been imbibing,
you may be templed to sleep
in early, but don't! Morning in
the city is especially interest
ing. Head to North Beach at 8
a.m. and have a bite at
Mama's Girl, a bright break
fast bistro on Washington
Square, at the corner of Filbert
and Stockton. 'Fry the cinna
mon-chocolate French toast, or
one of their renown light,
fluffy omelets. lliey also have
a wide array of pastries, such
as cinnamon twists and banana
nut bread. On the day we
dropped in, there was a huge
bowl of fresh strawberries

behind the counter, and you
can watch the chefs cook.
When you're good and
full, walk over to Chinatown.
Be sure to go between 8 a.m.
and 9 a.m., when the meat,
fish and vegetable markets are
just starting to open. Stockton
Street is a hotbed of activity,
and you can pick up fresh tan
gerines, Asian pears and other
fruits as you stroll down the
street. Pop in to any one of the
bakeries for almond cookies
and other Asian sweets, or pic k
up pork buns or steaming rice
cakes.
As you make your way
down Stockton, take notice of

the murals near the Ping Yuen
Senior Recreation Center. You
can also pick up some import
ed pornographic magazines
nearby, if you're into that sort
of thing.
When you reach Jackson
Street, head east, down toward
the Bay. After passing such
interesting places as Dick Lee
Pastry and Hue An (k>. Herbs
and Ginseng, you will see
"Ross Alley" on your right.
Though it can look a little
intimidating, a stroll through
the dark lane will give you a
glimpse into the real
Chinatown.
At 56 Ross Alley, you'll
see a place with a sign that
reads, "French Adult Fortune
Cookies." Step inside, and
you'll learn the ancient
"Chinese" secret of fortune
c<xÂ»kie making. You can buy a
bag of "G-rated" fortune c(x>k
ies for $2, or a bag of "adult"
ones for $1. While the "adult"
fortunes are a bit odd, they
can be amusing, as in: "The
bluebird of happiness will
surely crap on your birthday
cake," "Woman who sow wild
oats hope for crop failure,"
and "Stale bread not as good

as roll in grass."
Once your tour of
Chinatown is complete, head
up to the water, but stay away
from the dreaded Fisherman's
Wharf. If you head west from
the Wharf area, you'll hit the
Marina district and Fort
Mason.
The view of the Golden
Gate Bridge is gorgeous from
here and there's plenty of
grassy patches along the
waterfront to sit down and
feast on some of the food you
picked up in Chinatown. If
you're still hungry, there's a
Safeway prominently located
on Marina Boulevard.
Trek on over to Fort
Mason, which looks like a
series of warehouses built on
piers. Once an army com
mand post, the fort now is
home to a host of small muse
ums, including the African
American Historical and
Cultural Society, the Mexican
Museum and the San
Francisco Craft and Folk Art
Museum. There are often
musical and dramatic perfor
mances there as well; check

The Barnacle has the best
views. The fare ranges from
American to seafood and
pasta, with dinners going from
$12 to $25. Reservations
accepted (386-3330).
After the sun goes down,
you can find several interest
ing nightspots nearby.
Fledgling yupsters let it all
hang out at the upscale meat
market Johnny Love's, at
1500 Broadway at Polk. If
you're looking for something a
little more funky, how about

The Tonga
Room at the

Fair m on t

Hotel
. (corner

of California
and Mason
Sts.) This Tiki
bar, which has
been described
as a "kitsch-o
rania bar cus
tom-made for
tou-rists" is
actually kind
of fun. It's got
a 1950s feci to
it, and your
drinks are
served with
fruit and those

funky paper umbrellas. The
waiters wear mumus, and a
simulated rainstorm occurs
often in the simulated lagoon.
As the evening wears on,
make your way to the Haight-

for your safety, especially if
you travel through the "pan

The Noc Noc at 557 Haight.

There's a good selection of
beer, pins wine and sake. II
you're in town on a weekend,
check out The Deluxe, .it
1511 Haight. While there's .i
small cover ($3-sf)), the atmos
phere is worth it. It's a
19405-typc place, and tin
clientele (iresses the part. Ihe
music is swing or Sinatra.
When you're ready to
crash, head for the place
"where the summer of love
and today's world meet"
The Red Victorian Bed and

Breakfast Inn. Ixxrated .n
1665 Haight Street, this

blast from the 1970s is
run by a surprising

older woman, Sami
Sunchild, who carnc
to S.F". in 1976
after her

Hawaiian com
mune folded.
There are Iv< v


guest rooms, some with pri
vate baths. Stay in "the Flower
Child Room" (which has rain
bows, clouds and a sun paint
ed on the ceiling and '60s
posters on the walls); "The
Golden Gate Park Room"
(with cable car photos, bay
windows and a mirror on the
ceiling); or "The Peacock
Suite" (with a canopied king
bed and stained glass windows
"Fit for Ali Baba and his
love," the brochure says).
Rates range from $65 to $135
a night, and reservations (864-
1978) are recommended.
If you've been imbibing,
you may be templed to sleep
in early, but don't! Morning in
the city is especially interest
ing. Head to North Beach at 8
a.m. and have a bite at
Mama's Girl, a bright break
fast bistro on Washington
Square, at the corner of Filbert
and Stockton. 'Fry the cinna
mon-chocolate French toast, or
one of their renown light,
fluffy omelets. lliey also have
a wide array of pastries, such
as cinnamon twists and banana
nut bread. On the day we
dropped in, there was a huge
bowl of fresh strawberries

behind the counter, and you
can watch the chefs cook.
When you're good and
full, walk over to Chinatown.
Be sure to go between 8 a.m.
and 9 a.m., when the meat,
fish and vegetable markets are
just starting to open. Stockton
Street is a hotbed of activity,
and you can pick up fresh tan
gerines, Asian pears and other
fruits as you stroll down the
street. Pop in to any one of the
bakeries for almond cookies
and other Asian sweets, or pic k
up pork buns or steaming rice
cakes.
As you make your way
down Stockton, take notice of

the murals near the Ping Yuen
Senior Recreation Center. You
can also pick up some import
ed pornographic magazines
nearby, if you're into that sort
of thing.
When you reach Jackson
Street, head east, down toward
the Bay. After passing such
interesting places as Dick Lee
Pastry and Hue An (k>. Herbs
and Ginseng, you will see
"Ross Alley" on your right.
Though it can look a little
intimidating, a stroll through
the dark lane will give you a
glimpse into the real
Chinatown.
At 56 Ross Alley, you'll
see a place with a sign that
reads, "French Adult Fortune
Cookies." Step inside, and
you'll learn the ancient
"Chinese" secret of fortune
c<xÂ»kie making. You can buy a
bag of "G-rated" fortune c(x>k
ies for $2, or a bag of "adult"
ones for $1. While the "adult"
fortunes are a bit odd, they
can be amusing, as in: "The
bluebird of happiness will
surely crap on your birthday
cake," "Woman who sow wild
oats hope for crop failure,"
and "Stale bread not as good

as roll in grass."
Once your tour of
Chinatown is complete, head
up to the water, but stay away
from the dreaded Fisherman's
Wharf. If you head west from
the Wharf area, you'll hit the
Marina district and Fort
Mason.
The view of the Golden
Gate Bridge is gorgeous from
here and there's plenty of
grassy patches along the
waterfront to sit down and
feast on some of the food you
picked up in Chinatown. If
you're still hungry, there's a
Safeway prominently located
on Marina Boulevard.
Trek on over to Fort
Mason, which looks like a
series of warehouses built on
piers. Once an army com
mand post, the fort now is
home to a host of small muse
ums, including the African
American Historical and
Cultural Society, the Mexican
Museum and the San
Francisco Craft and Folk Art
Museum. There are often
musical and dramatic perfor
mances there as well; check

Fisherman's Wharf.
Seen it.
Cable cars.
Rode 'em.
Coit Tower.
Been there.
Golden Gate Bridge.
Done that.
After a couple dorm trips
to the City, the tourist traps
become, in a word, boring.
How many over-priced bowls
of clam chowder can one eat?
But yawn not, Farm dwellers,
San Francisco still has plenty
to offer.
You just have to look a lit
tle harder.
While most Stanfordites
wake up bright and early to go
to the City, why not turn that
logic on its head? If you leave
Stanford around 4 p.m., you
can beat the traffic and see die
sunset over the Bay. Fry The
Cliff House at 1090 Point
Lobos Ave. for a great view.
The place is actually three
restaurants: the early San
Francisco-style "Upstairs

at the Cliff House," the more
casual "Seaf(K)cl and Beverage
Company" and the old-style
pub "Phineas T. Barnacle."
The Barnacle has the best
views. The fare ranges from
