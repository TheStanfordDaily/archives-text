Fisherman's Wharf.
Seen it.
Cable cars.
Rode 'em.
Coit Tower.
Been there.
Golden Gate Bridge.
Done that.
After a couple dorm trips
to the City, the tourist traps
become, in a word, boring.
How many over-priced bowls
of clam chowder can one eat?
But yawn not, Farm dwellers,
San Francisco still has plenty
to offer.
You just have to look a lit
tle harder.
While most Stanfordites
wake up bright and early to go
to the City, why not turn that
logic on its head? If you leave
Stanford around 4 p.m., you
can beat the traffic and see die
sunset over the Bay. Fry The
Cliff House at 1090 Point
Lobos Ave. for a great view.
The place is actually three
restaurants: the early San
Francisco-style "Upstairs

at the Cliff House," the more
casual "Seaf(K)cl and Beverage
Company" and the old-style
pub "Phineas T. Barnacle."
The Barnacle has the best
views. The fare ranges from
American to seafood and
pasta, with dinners going from
$12 to $25. Reservations
accepted (386-3330).
After the sun goes down,
you can find several interest
ing nightspots nearby.
Fledgling yupsters let it all
hang out at the upscale meat
market Johnny Love's, at
1500 Broadway at Polk. If
you're looking for something a
little more funky, how about

The Tonga
Room at the

Fair m on t

Hotel
. (corner

of California
and Mason
Sts.) This Tiki
bar, which has
been described
as a "kitsch-o
rania bar cus
tom-made for
tou-rists" is
actually kind
of fun. It's got
a 1950s feci to
it, and your
drinks are
served with
fruit and those

funky paper umbrellas. The
waiters wear mumus, and a
simulated rainstorm occurs
often in the simulated lagoon.
As the evening wears on,
make your way to the Haight-
Ashbury district, but watch out
for your safety, especially if
you travel through the "pan
handle" section of
Golden Gate Park. If
you're feeling real
adventuresome, try

The Noc Noc at 557 Haight.
1 he interior looks like Fred
Flintstone might have decorat
ed it using modern materials.
There's a good selection of
beer, pins wine and sake. II
you're in town on a weekend,
check out The Deluxe, .it
1511 Haight. While there's .i
small cover ($3-sf)), the atmos
phere is worth it. It's a
19405-typc place, and tin
clientele (iresses the part. Ihe
music is swing or Sinatra.
When you're ready to
crash, head for the place
"where the summer of love
and today's world meet"
The Red Victorian Bed and

Breakfast Inn. Ixxrated .n
1665 Haight Street, this

blast from the 1970s is
run by a surprising

older woman, Sami
Sunchild, who carnc
