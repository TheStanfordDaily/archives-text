# Rush '94: 'one of the best'
## Five out of 6 sororities reach quota 
### Frank Guinan Staff writer 
As the tents on Wilbur Field were
packed up yesterday afternoon, formal
sorority bids were handed out, signifying
the official end of Sorority Rush.
Five of the six sororities made the
University-set quota this year, handing
out the maximum number of 24 bids
each to prospective pledges, according to
Intersorority Council Co-Chair Katie Al

berts. Delta Gamma offered 13 bids.
Informal bids were expected to con
tinue to be handed out last night and
today in a process known as continuous
bidding.
Women who accept the bids will be
come pledges and will be initiated into
their sororities either this spring or next
fall
Heather Dunn, program director at
the Office of Student Affairs, said she
thought Rush went very smoothly.

"There were no crises this year," she
said, as opposed to last year, when heavy
rains and a power failure delayed two
nights of activities.
"We did have one night of rain on Fri
day, but everyone managed," Dunn said.
According to Dunn, Rush chairs
worked closely with the fire marshals to
make sure that there were no hazardous
decorations and that everything met the
fire code.
"Organizationally, it was one
of the best Rush weeks we have
had here," said Nanci Howe,
director of the Office of Student
Affairs, who also serves as an
adviser for the Greek system.
This also was the second year
that a computer system was used
in helping to manage Rush.
According to Dunn, the system

helped with the scheduling of dif
ferent parties and activities.
After the rains last year, there
were plans to move Rush to a loca
tion other than Wilbur Field, but
there were no facilities on campus
which could accommodate that
many women, according to Dunn
and Alberts.
The idea of holding Rush off
campus, such as in the homes of
sorority alumni, was rejected
because the chairs wanted to
ensure equity for each sorority.
The sororities which participat
ed in Rush included Chi Omega,

Delta Delta Delta, Delta Gamma,
Kappa Alpha Theta, Kappa Kappa
Gamma and Pi Beta Phi.
One freshman who received a
bid into Pi Beta Phi but asked not
to be named said the whole week
was more that she expected. "I
first thought it would be a really
superficial process, but I learned a
lot more about the women in the
sororities," she said.
"One thing I learned is that
being in a sorority is not some
thing you really need," she said,
"but it is something which could
add a lot to your life."
