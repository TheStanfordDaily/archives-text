# Districting debate has few fireworks
## 
### Scott Van Winkle Staff writer 
Despite having sparked a rancorous and personal
dispute between two ASSU senators, last night's de
bate over a proposed amendment to overhaul the way
senators are elected was surprisingly light-hearted
and amiable.
The hour-long debate between graduate senator
Sanford Dickert and Tom Costello, a concerned grad
uate student, settled little in the dispute between
those who argue the change will improve senator ac
countability and those who fear the altered ASSU
Senate would inaccurately represent students.
What it did provide the 20 students who came to
the ASSU offices was a few laughs and a chance to air
their views during a 10-minute open forum.
"I'm here just to disagree with what Sanford
said," Costello said in his opening remarks. A stu
dent in the computer science department and occa
sional member of the Stanford debate team, Costello
offered to debate Dickert after undergraduate sena

tor Gabe Lucas, who authored the amendment, de
clined Dickert's invitation to debate.
The amendment to the ASSU Constitution, which
students will vote on during the election today and
tomorrow, would create six geographical districts
and four class-level districts. Two undergraduate
senators would be elected from each district, and, un
like the current system in which there are 10 voting
and 10 non-voting senators, all 20 would be permit
ted to vote.
The amendment, which would require approval
from two-thirds of voters to pass, would also move
elections to fall quarter and give the 10 non-voting
graduate senators the right to vote.
Dickert has been the most outspoken critic of the
amendment since it was first proposed by Lucas
early winter quarter. Dickert responded to Lucas' de
cision not to debate by knocking on his door at 7 a.m.
in an effort to get an explanation and distributing fly
ers calling on Lucas to meet him.
Neil Crellin, a graduate sena
tor who recruited his roommate
Costello for the debate, said, "We
felt |Lucas] had been smeared in
public and the amendment
shouldn't be defeated on the basis
of a smear campaign."
Lucas, who attended most of
the debate, said he felt his deci
sion not to participate allowed the
debate to focus on the issues.
"Nobody that was there cared
about me," he said, "and I don't
think Sanford realizes that."
Dickert insisted that Lucas
had a "responsibility to his con
stituents" to attend the debate.
"What disappoints me the
most about this debate is that
Gabe did not have the mettle to
speak on the issues in front of his
constituents," Dickert said.

Lucas blamed Dickert's
"name-calling" for his reluctance
to debate. "I was very supportive of
having the issues on the table," he
said.
Dickert said the personal ele
ment of the debate arose from
Lucas' refusal to debate him.
"There is no personal element in a
debate on the issues," he said, "and
Gabe avoided a debate on issues."
Compared with the debate on
whether to debate, last night's dis
cussion between Costello and Dick
ert was relatively tame.
Dickert referred to previous
attempts to elect senators by dis
trict in the late 1960s and '70s,
which were repealed, he said,
because they "baikanized the cam
pus" and "forced students to select
from a smaller slate of students."
Costello responded with humor,
saying, "Who was here in 1969?
Drug-crazed hippies! . . . It's a dif
ferent crowd around here now."
More substantively, he added,

"We want districts so people will
know who they vote for."
When the floor was opened for
audience comments, computer sci
ence graduate student Oliver Brock
reacted to Costello's hyperbolic
style, saying he was "shocked" by
his "ridiculous remarks."
Undergraduate senator Peter
Cousins also jumped into the
debate, calling the districting plan
a "white-power bill" because it
would divide the campus into
dorm-based constituencies which
are "overwhelmingly white" except
in theme houses.
Costello responded to Cousins
by saying, "People vote regardless
of color. Stanford is not broken
down on race lines. . . . That's
something that we should fight for
on this campus — integration."
Dickert said in his closing
remarks, "Districting is not going to
increase accountability, it's not
going to make senators do their
jobs.... Simply put, it won't work."
