# Districting debate has few fireworks
## 
### Scott Van Winkle Staff writer 
Despite having sparked a rancorous and personal
dispute between two ASSU senators, last night's de
bate over a proposed amendment to overhaul the way
senators are elected was surprisingly light-hearted
and amiable.
The hour-long debate between graduate senator
Sanford Dickert and Tom Costello, a concerned grad
uate student, settled little in the dispute between
those who argue the change will improve senator ac
countability and those who fear the altered ASSU
Senate would inaccurately represent students.
What it did provide the 20 students who came to
the ASSU offices was a few laughs and a chance to air
their views during a 10-minute open forum.
"I'm here just to disagree with what Sanford
said," Costello said in his opening remarks. A stu
dent in the computer science department and occa
sional member of the Stanford debate team, Costello
offered to debate Dickert after undergraduate sena

tor Gabe Lucas, who authored the amendment, de
clined Dickert's invitation to debate.
The amendment to the ASSU Constitution, which
students will vote on during the election today and
tomorrow, would create six geographical districts
and four class-level districts. Two undergraduate
senators would be elected from each district, and, un
like the current system in which there are 10 voting
and 10 non-voting senators, all 20 would be permit
ted to vote.
The amendment, which would require approval
from two-thirds of voters to pass, would also move
elections to fall quarter and give the 10 non-voting
graduate senators the right to vote.
Dickert has been the most outspoken critic of the
amendment since it was first proposed by Lucas
early winter quarter. Dickert responded to Lucas' de
cision not to debate by knocking on his door at 7 a.m.
in an effort to get an explanation and distributing fly
ers calling on Lucas to meet him.
