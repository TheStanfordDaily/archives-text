## Fee refund revolt prompts belt-tightening 
### Jim Luh Staff writer 
With controversy brewing over the
ASSU special-fee process and student
groups hit hard by high fee refund rates
this year, many organizations are trim
ming their budgets, looking to other
sources of funding and making greater ef
forts to make their presence — and their fi
nancial needs — known to students.
Student group fee request budgets have
typically included an extra allowance to ac
count for student fee refunds.
The allowances in groups' budgets for
1993-'94 averaged about 25 percent of
their total fee requests.
But refund rates rose beyond their an
ticipated levels this year, perhaps partially
driven by a "fee revolt" organized by the
Graduate Student Tea Party. The group of
graduate students said they were disen
chanted with the special-fee system be
cause they felt they were funding groups
that catered solely to undergraduate stu
dents while ignoring the interests of grad
uate students.
Student refund rates were 32 percent
fall quarter and 39 percent winter quarter,
according to ASSU Financial Manager
Brian Hillger.

So student orga
nizations' special
fee budgets for
next year have in
cluded larger al
lowances, which
Hillger based on
the refund rates
each group expe
rienced this year.

But the higher allowances do not com
pletely solve the cash flow problems that
organizations face.
Nineteen of the 27 groups receiving spe
cial fee funding this year experienced re
fund rates of greater than 30 percent, but
the ASSU Bylaws limit the allowances at
30 percent — leaving them with the poten
tial of continuing shortfalls.
In addition, the higher refund rate esti
mates do not affect funding for this year,
and, as a result, groups have had to make
do with less income than had been figured
into their budgets.
Matthew Mizel of the Stanford Rape
Education Project said that his group has
tried to reduce its costs.
"We examined costs much more and we
actually cut costs in many areas," Mizel
