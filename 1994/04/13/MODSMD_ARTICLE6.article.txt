## Fee refund revolt prompts belt-tightening 
### Jim Luh Staff writer 
With controversy brewing over the
ASSU special-fee process and student
groups hit hard by high fee refund rates
this year, many organizations are trim
ming their budgets, looking to other
sources of funding and making greater ef
forts to make their presence — and their fi
nancial needs — known to students.
Student group fee request budgets have
typically included an extra allowance to ac
count for student fee refunds.
The allowances in groups' budgets for
1993-'94 averaged about 25 percent of
their total fee requests.
But refund rates rose beyond their an
ticipated levels this year, perhaps partially
driven by a "fee revolt" organized by the
Graduate Student Tea Party. The group of
graduate students said they were disen
chanted with the special-fee system be
cause they felt they were funding groups
that catered solely to undergraduate stu
dents while ignoring the interests of grad
uate students.
Student refund rates were 32 percent
fall quarter and 39 percent winter quarter,
according to ASSU Financial Manager
Brian Hillger.

So student orga
nizations' special
fee budgets for
next year have in
cluded larger al
lowances, which
Hillger based on
the refund rates
each group expe
rienced this year.

But the higher allowances do not com
pletely solve the cash flow problems that
organizations face.
Nineteen of the 27 groups receiving spe
cial fee funding this year experienced re
fund rates of greater than 30 percent, but
the ASSU Bylaws limit the allowances at
30 percent — leaving them with the poten
tial of continuing shortfalls.
In addition, the higher refund rate esti
mates do not affect funding for this year,
and, as a result, groups have had to make
do with less income than had been figured
into their budgets.
Matthew Mizel of the Stanford Rape
Education Project said that his group has
tried to reduce its costs.
"We examined costs much more and we
actually cut costs in many areas," Mizel

said. "We basically tried to be
more frugal."
Other groups, meanwhile, are
looking for other ways to fund
their projects.
Junior Gabe Lucas, who repre
sents the Stanford Jazz Orches
tra, said his group has been seek
ing alternate sources of funding,
including booking performances
throughout the University.
"The Jazz Orchestra has been
pursuing alternate sources of
funding," Lucas said, including
"playing for dorm functions [and]
department functions."
Craig Zajac of the Stanford
Axe Committee said his group
also has been working to find dif
ferent ways to fund its events, but
said the timing of the Axe Com
mittee's events — which include
the Big Game Bonfire and the
Freshman Handbook — severely
limits outside fundraising.
"We [need) kind of a large
amount of money, and we need it
earlier in the year," Zajac said.
Zajac said that while some of
the Axe Committee's activities,
such as Frisbee golf, might appeal

to graduate students, its focus on
school spirit makes it difficult to
appeal directly to graduate stu
dents. But, he said, "special-fee
groups can't take the graduate
students for granted."
Specific attempts to reach out
to graduate students is an
approach taken by several groups
in the hopes of securing broader
support.
Bryan Perez, general manager
of the Stanford Concert Network,
said his organization has not
made significant reductions in its
budget but has been making
efforts to reach out to more stu
dents.
"We didn't try to adjust our
budget, we just tried to communi
cate our value," Perez said.
Perez said the Concert Net
work's has also been trying to
reach out to more graduate stu
dents, both in its recruitment and
its programming. Perez said he
recognized that graduates could
be a valuable resource, both as
operators and customers of the
Concert Network — partially
because he is a graduate student
himself.
Keri Castaneda of the Stanford
Women's Center said her organi
zation was trying to diversify its
programs to reach more students,

male and female, and undertak
ing fundraising efforts to reduce
its reliance on special fee money.
"I think that all student
groups are finding that . . . they
can't rely on special fees as in the
past," Castaneda said.
But despite these groups'
attempts at broader appeals,
medical student Karen Seta, a co
chair of the Graduate Student
Tea Party, said that the response
to the graduate student refund
drive thus far has been inade
quate.
"It didn't have the desired
effect, which was to make the
organizations more accountable"
in terms of "spending students'
money more responsibly," Seta
said.
Seta said she has also not seen
groups reaching out to more grad
uate students.
While Seta said she sees
promise in a proposed constitu
tional amendment to divide the
special-fee process into graduate
and undergraduate votes, she
fears that if the amendment does
not pass, the Graduate Student
Tea Party may have to regroup
and organize another special-fee
revolt.
"That's the only way to make
our point," she said.
