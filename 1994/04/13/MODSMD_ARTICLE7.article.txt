# For trustees, lighter fare
## Thirty former board members return to meet Casper, discuss state of University 
### Colleen Krueger Staff writer 
Sandwiched between meetings with tough
agenda items like January's tuition increases
and June's budget approval, this week's
Board of Trustees meeting offered a welcome
break to trustees and committee members.
Although the annual budget is generally
unveiled at the April meeting, this year's
budget-reduction process delayed that pre
sentation.
Instead, the trustees and committee mem
bers spent most of their time Sunday
through yesterday discussing reports from
different areas of the University in the
board's eight standing committees and as a
full board, said John Freidenrich, president
of the board. Relatively few "action items"
were on the agenda, he added.
The bi-monthly gathering was visited by
30 former trustees — many of whom had

never met University President Gerhard
Casper — who spoke with Casper and the
trustees about their perceptions of the state
of the University.
"We were very pleased with the turnout of
former trustees," Freidenrich said. "Al
though there were few items officially acted
upon, it was overall a very positive session."
And despite a highly-publicized drop in
the level of general alumni satisfaction with
the University, Freidenrich said these
"alums" were generally very supportive of
the Casper administration and its decisions.
"All in all, it was a very upbeat experi
ence," Freidenrich said. "I think both the
current and the former trustees felt a bit re
vitalized."
After attending various committee meet
ings, both Casper and Provost Condoleezza
Rice addressed the board. Freidenrich re-
fused to elaborate on Casper's
remarks, except to say that he
"commented on a number of
important issues."
The committee on development,
external and alumni affairs spent
most of its time "looking at how to
work with U.S. News and World
Report's changing calculation" of
its annual ranking of American
colleges and universities, said com

mittee member and graduate stu
dent Derek Miyahara. In its latest
survey published last fall, the mag
azine rated Stanford sixth among
the major research universities.
The committee is developing
recommendations for the maga
zine detailing factors the Universi
ty thinks its report should take
into account, he said.
The alumni trustees who sat in
on his committee "provided valu
able suggestions and made very pos
itive observations about the Univer
sity's future," Miyahara said.

Athletic Director Ted Leland,
Assoc. Dean of the Graduate School
of Business Jerry Porras and Senior
Assoc. Athletic Director Cheryl Lev
ick led a "presentation on the status
and progress of the athletic depart
ment" for the committee on aca
demic policy, planning and manage
ment, said committee member,
senior Jason Snyder.
"We talked about such issues as
the financial health of the depart
ment of athletics, gender equity
and academic performance of stu
dent-athletes," Snyder said.
