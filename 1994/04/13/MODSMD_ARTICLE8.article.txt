Despite recent violent actions, the Israeli-Palestin
ian peace process continues to move forward, Israeli
Deputy Consul General to the Pacific Reda Mansour
said yesterday.
"The peace process is still going on, momentum is
there and we still have a lot of work to do, but as soon
as there is a change people will start to feel it," Mansour
told an audience of about 15 students and community
members in a discussion yesterday afternoon at
Tresidder Union.
Mansour began by briefly discussing the political ef
fects of the chain of tragic events that started with the


Bobby Lee—Daily
Israel's Deputy Council General to the Pacific Rada
Mansour speaks at Tresidder yesterday about the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
February massacre of Palestinians
in the Tomb of the Patriarchs in
Hebron and included the stab
bings of some Israelis and the
suicide car-bombing of a Pales
tinian that killed several Israeli
youths as well as an Arab Israeli
woman.
Noting the death of the Arab
Israeli woman, Mansour said that
"this is a proof that terror is
blind." He said that the perpetra
tors of these violent acts were all
people who oppose the peace pro
cess and that the "courageous"
leaders of both sides will keep
negotiating.
Both the Israeli government
and the Palestinian leadership
face internal, mainstream opposi
tion, he said. The Israeli govern
ment faces it from various right
ist movements such as Kahane
Chai, and the Palestinian Libera
tion Organization must overcome
resistance from movements such
as the militant Hamas.
"But I think that as soon as
something will start to happen, it

will change the atmosphere in the
West Bank," Mansour said.
Mansour pointed to the initial
reaction to the Camp David
accords of 1978 — when Israel
agreed to return the Sinai Penin
sula to Egypt — as an example in
which public opinion drastically
changed.
"Eighty percent of Israelis
were opposed to giving back the
Sinai before [former Egyptian
President Anwar] Sadat came to
speak, but after they heard him
speak and realized that he really
wanted peace and this wasn't just
another political maneuver,
around 80 percent of Israelis
changed their minds and were for
it," Mansour said.
The agreement for three years
of interim Palestinian self-rule in
Jericho and the Gaza Strip is in
its final stages, Mansour said, and
"we hope to finalize it soon. The
Palestinians will have a police
force . . . and some Palestinians
from Tunis will come and start to
organize things."
Mansour also discussed the
problems Israel faces with bor
dering countries, contending that
the Lebanese government is con
trolled by the Syrians and that

Syria refused to negotiate for
anything but a complete return of
the Golan Heights.
He said that Syria feels like
"they're the last barrier. The rest
of the countries will agree to
peace and Syria feels like it's
responsible for the Arab unity."
"Even though the talks seem
frustrating we have to remember
that before the Madrid Confer
ence the situation was much
worse," he said. "Israelis are
starting diplomatic relations with
other Arab countries in North
Africa . . . (and) meeting with
Arabs and Palestinians to work
on projects. . . . Momentum is
there."
After his speech, Mansour
answered various questions from
the audience. On the issue of Jew
ish settlements in the occupied
territories, Mansour said they
will be discussed in three years in
conjunction with the other
"hard" issues.
Yesterday's peace process ses
sion, sponsored by Hillel, was
scheduled to precede the annual
Israel Independence Day cele
bration, which will take place
this Friday in White Plaza at
noon.
