4) Follow instructions on the screen & VOTE!...when finished voting, type logout at the prompt.
If you do NOT obtain a Cardinal account in time for the election, you can vote by paper ballot,
available at the ASSU lobby, second floor of Tresidder Union. However, please open a cardinal
account for your own convenience. You will probably have to wait in line for paper ballot
voting. We will also require two forms of identification: 1) Picture I.D. & 2) Valid Spring
S.U.I.D. (or an official document that could serve the same purpose).
We will have paper ballots available at the ASSU lobby ONLY from 9AM to SPM on
April 13 Gf April 14, as those are the general business hours of the ASSII office.
If you have any problems connecting to a ResComp NeXT station, try connecting to another NeXT
on the list. Direct any questions and/or problems to the Elections Commission at 723-2839.
. PLEASE KEEP THIS SHEET FOR YOUR REFERENCE WHEN YOU VOTE!
