*Read only as much as we can afford to cover.
In the last three years, The Daily has been forced to trim $100,000 from Its
budget. Reductions in advertising, caused by a sluggish economy and
continuing University budget cuts, have forced The Daily to reduce circulation and
compensation, and lower the average paper size —- while working aggressively to
maximize sales. Your special fee will help avoid additional cuts.
These days, the annual costs of producing a newspaper like The Stanford Daily
161 days a year exceed $1 million. Persisting trends in the economy leave our
advertising revenue slightly below that amount. Your $4.58 annual fee helps make
up the difference. For each student, it amounts to less than three cents per issue.
