## Universal ID in the works 
### Burt Herman Editorial staff 
With the Registrar's Office currently studying op
tions for new photographic identification cards, Stan
ford students could have another bad picture of them
selves to carry around by sometime next year.
A card with a photo and a magnetic strip on the back
encoded with the bearer's identification number would
combine both the current meal card and student IDs,
according to University Registrar Roger Printup.
While the new identification cards will first be used
for dining services, library services and at campus
gymnasiums, Printup said students may one day be
able to pay for services such as laundry machines,
copy machines and Tresidder purchases with the

card.
Before these services can be
added, the University will have to im
plement some kind of "debit-down
account," Printup said. When stu
dents make purchases, money will be
subtracted from their account.
"The idea is that students only
have to write one check and have
just one pot of money," Printup
said. "Students won't have to carry
a lot of cash around."

Currently, a task force chaired by Printup is study
ing options for the new card's final form and working
out details for the new data system. The task force
hopes to complete its work by the end of the quarter,
Printup said.
The card may also be used for dormitory access in
the future. Universities with greater security con
cerns usually use identification cards as electronic
keys to control access to residences, Printup said.
However, housing officials are still discussing this
feature â€” which would not be implemented until at least
the second year of the system's operation, Printup said.
The initial start-up costs of the new system will be
around $400,000 to $500,000, according to Printup.
"In the long run, [the system] should pay for it
self," he said. Funds for the modernization will be
drawn from money allocated for administrative infor
mation upgrades.
"Students at universities which have these types
of systems are very pleased," Printup said.
