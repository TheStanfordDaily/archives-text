Serbs fight back
SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP)
â€” Two days after coming under NATO
attack, Bosnian Serbs lashed back yester
day, detaining U.N. military observers in
the Gorazde area and cutting off natural
gas to Sarajevo. Four rockets landed in the
capital, shattering a two-month cease-fire.
Russian special envoy Vitaly Churkin
also said the Serbs were ready to stop
attacks on the besieged Muslim enclave of
Gorazde. Two weeks of Serb assaults on
the enclave 35 miles southeast of Sarajevo
provoked NATO air strikes Sunday and
Monday.
Following the NATO air strikes, the
Serbs suspended peace talks with the
United Nations and threatened to shoot
down NATO planes. But fighting has
ebbed since Monday's raid, and interna

tional negotiators have pressed the war
ring sides to return to peace talks.
Helpful gene discovered
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - A key gene
that normally suppresses cancer has been
identified by researchers, offering an
important new focus for treating the dis
ease, scientists reported yesterday.
Loss of the gene was detected in a broad
range of cancers, including 60 percent of
breast cancer cases and 82 percent of one
type of brain tumor.
The newly identified tumor-suppress
ing gene, pl 6, appears even more signifi
cant than the previously identified p53
gene, which is believed to be a major factor
in colon, breast, liver and other cancers,
said Alexander Kamb of Utah-based Myri
ad Genetics Inc..
