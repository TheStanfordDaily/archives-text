HADERA, Israel (AP) â€” An apparent
suicide bomb claimed by Islamic oppo
nents of Israel-Palestinian peace talks
ripped through a bus jammtxl with sol
diers and civilians yesterday, killing six
people and wounding 28.
Senior officials warned that two such
attacks in a week could mean the start of
a gruesome pattern that would be diffi
cult to combat. Militant Islamic groups
vowed they would carry out at least three
more suicide bombings as revenge for the
Feb. 25 Hebron mosque massacre.
Officials reacted quickly to try to reas
sure the Israeli public, whose support for
the peace talks is largely based on the
belief they will bring security inside
Israel's pre-1967 borders.
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin sent
more troops to seal off the occupied Gaza
Strip and the West Bank, where authori
ties believe the bomb was constructed.

but said he would continue with peace
talks.
"Hamas and Islamic Jihad have come
to the conclusion they have to strike ...
inside Israel because the dividend is Israeli
opposition to the peace process," Rabin
said in remarks broadcast nationwide.
The morning explosion at the central
bus station in this coastal city midway
between Tel Aviv and Haifa reverberated
across the country at the start of an
extended holiday weekend, when Israel
first mourns its 17,955 war dead on
Remembrance Day and then celebrates
its 1948 creation on Independence Day.
Police said they suspect a West Bank
Palestinian either rigged the explosives to
his body or carried them in a bag and
ignited them afler climbing in the back
door of the public bus, which stops
repeatedly on its route from Tiberius
across the country to Tel Aviv.

A second bomb left on a bench outside
the bus was timed to go off at 11 a.m.,
when sirens sounded nationwide for two
minutes in memory of the war dead and
virtually everyone stands at attention. It
was exploded harmlessly by police.
Bus passengers said someone outside
had noticed an abandoned black bag, sus
pected it contained a bomb, and was
yelling at the driver to move the bus when
the bomb inside the vehicle went off.
"Suddenly there was a roar, I felt
things hitting me from all sides," said
Rachel Muallam, 50, from her hospital
bed. "The man sitting next to me was
either wounded or killed. He was com
pletely mangled, covered in blood, his
head lolling."
Police said five of the six people killed,
including the attacker, had been identi
fied but their names were withheld until
their relatives could be told.
