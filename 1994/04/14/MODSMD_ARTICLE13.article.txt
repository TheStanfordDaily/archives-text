## ASSU ELECTION ENDORSEMENTS COP: slim pickings 
### 
WITHOUT RECOMMENDATION

ONE IS idealistic. One is
downright dangerous. Both
are naive and neither is suit
ably prepared. As candidates for
the Council of Presidents, neither
"Students' Voice" nor "The Team
sters" has the qualifications need
ed to rescue the ASSU's ailing rep
utation.
But "Students' Voice" is at least
serious.
In contrast, "The Teamsters,"
sponsored by the Chaparral,
promise to erect a floating casino
on Lake Lagunita to raise funds for
a minimum University wage of $20
per hour.
The members of this slate, Tony
Sirna, Doug Miro, Pete Marks and
Scott Gagner, are occasionally
funny but won't provide the seri
ous leadership that Stanford stu
dents need.
The four members of the Peo
ple's Platform slate, "Students'
Voice," Vanessa Alvarado, Anietie
Ekanem, Lisa Lee and Mork Mur
dock, are convincing: they want to
make the ASSU more responsive to
student concerns. But they lack
concrete plans and an understand
ing of how to turn the ASSU
around.
As members of the Student of
Color Coalition, they hope to main
tain support for ethnic centers. But
a COP that only supports a few
powerful interests — as opposed to
the interests that can't form orga
nized student support — will be
worthless. The slate must develop
detailed plans of how it would rep
resent these interests if it is to gain
support from students and be
taken seriously by the administra
tion.
Alvarado, Ekanem and Mur
dock are ASSU senators this year,
so have some experience with stu
dent government. They correctly

point out that the COP must pro
vide strong leadership in the sen
ate, and that the current COP's
lack of involvement weakens its
influence in the Provost's office
and beyond.
The slate recognizes the
accountability problem with the
senate, but they oppose elections of
undergraduate senators from resi
dential and class districts. Instead,
"Students' Voice" offers its only
concrete proposal — resurrection
of the failed dorm representative
system.
The slate has not studied the
reasons the dorm reps program
fell apart two years ago, but
acknowledges that being a dorm
rep may be seen as a "grunge job"
few students will want to partici
pate in.
As well, the dorm reps program
was famous for leaving out grad
uate students. The slate should
understand the COP has to repre
sent the entire student body, and
should make plans that take
graduate interests into account.
"Students' Voice" has, at one
time or another, mentioned other
issues: student opposition to
bringing back the "F" grade, post
office lines, universal ID cards,
and getting a COP member on the
University cabinet. More often
than not, however, these ideas
seem to lack any concrete plan of
action.
The ASSU needs an influential
COP to focus the senate on impor
tant student services, to design an
overhaul of the special fee process,
and to make the student govern
ment accountable to students.
Unfortunately, it appears neither
slate is prepared enough to accom
plish this.
But it would be nice to be proved
wrong.
