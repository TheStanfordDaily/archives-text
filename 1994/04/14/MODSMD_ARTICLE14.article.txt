Constitutional Amendment: Senate Bill XXIV-A&R-20
DYES O NO
To district the undergraduate senate into six geographical districts and four class districts,
and to make all senators voting.

THE PROBLEM: Lack of
ASSU Senate accountability.
A remedy: Constitutional
Amendment/Senate Bill XXIV-
A&R-20.
As many would agree, the sen
ate has a large accountability
problem. Senators don't have
defined constituencies and conse
quently, students don't know who
"their" senators are. As a result,
voters' needs are neither noticed
nor addressed. The populace
begins questioning the utility of a
government and, in turn, the
stature of the government is
undermined.
Students can help stop this
vicious cycle by approving this
amendment, which would give all
senators the right to vote and dis
trict the undergraduate senate
into six geographical districts and
four class districts. The plan
would also move senate elections
from the spring to the fall.
The most important point of the
proposal is the division of the
undergraduate senate by resi
dences and by class. Therefore, a
junior living in Toyon would have
two representatives from the
Toyon area as well as two junior
class representatives. This
increased interaction would allow
students to get to know their rep
resentatives better.
Moving senate elections to the
fall would also have benefits.
Freshmen and one-year master's
students would have a chance to
elect representatives — instead of
being represented by people who
were elected before they arrived

on campus.
Moreover, by holding elections in
the first half of fall quarter, less
time would be devoted to campaign
ing, giving the senate more time to
do productive work. Because most
representatives would be dorm
based, prospective senators would
not plaster the entire campus with
fliers — they would be able to
engage the fewer voters with more
substantive issues.
Finally, by giving all elected sen
ators a vote, senators' participa
tion would be increased. What is
the current incentive for "alter
nate" senators to show up to meet
ings, knowing that they have a
slim chance of voting? There is
none. Giving everyone a vote is the
minimum incentive any elected
person deserves.
Critics charge the measure has
"no provisions" to ensure account
ability. But accountability cannot
be written in to any amendment; it
starts with the constituents, who
— if this amendment passes —
should know which senators to
approach with a problem.
Critics also charge that district
ing will balkanize the campus. But
all-campus interests can be repre
sented by the class representatives
and the Council of Presidents. Dis
tricting can hardly make senators
any more inaccessible than they
already are.
If students — and undergradu
ates in particular — want to revi
talize the ASSU and make it more
accountable and credible, they can
start by voting "yes" on this
amendment.
