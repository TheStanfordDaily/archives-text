## Freaky nails and ponytails 
### 
THERE'S SOMETHING to be said
for being a freak. Seriously. I'm a
freak. Take a look at my photo
today. Take a look my thumb, my
mutant thumbnail thumb, my mother of
all thumbnails thumb.
When people see my thumb they shut
up. It doesn't matter what they are
doing. They could be presenting a paper
on sublime aesthetics to an audience of
thousands, and all I have to do is stand
up in the back of the room and hold up
my thumbnail. They shut up.
Then, after they pick their chin up off
the floor, they think to themselves,
"Boy, this guy's a real freak."
Some people just don't like things like
fingernails on a guy. They think it's a
sign, a signal. They think I must be into
strange bedtime rituals and heavy hallu
cinogens. They think I must be part of
the little known "men who want to get
in touch with the woman inside them
selves" cult or something.
Other people think they are really far
out. They go wild over them. They say
"Oh, my God, are all these your real
nails?" and want to finger them and
show them to their friends.
Some people even go further. They're
really wild about them. They're wildly
outraged by them. They think they're a
lascivious aberration cf what is right
and a blasphemous statement against
the natural order of God. They're
annoyed by them. I actually had some
one once offer me $5 a nail if I cut them

off, just so he wouldn't have to look at
them. What a freak.
And then there is the hair. Why the
long hair? Why the bands in the pony
tail? Why can't I just be a regular all-
American boy? Why do I have to have
the longest hair of any guy on campus?
What's a nice guy like me doing with
hair like that?
People like freaks who they can
understand. People like freaks who sit at
home and listen to Mel Torme records
while cleaning their sawed-off shot
guns. People like freaks who stay with
their own kind. People like freaks who
never seem to go anywhere. They are
disturbed, however, to find freaks at
Stanford. They are disturbed to find
that there is a little bit of a freak in all of
us.
Yes, the abnormal lies underneath all
of our skins. It lurks there, waiting to
come out in a joke about wanting to go
to work dressed like Darth Vader, wait
ing to be revealed in a question about
what tuna fish and jelly on a pumper
nickel sandwich would taste like.
But shouldn't you be ashamed of
your strange inklings? Shouldn't you
fight off those shifty-eyed desires?
Absolutely not.
As a bona fide, certified, genuine
freak, I encourage everyone out there to
celebrate the peculiar in themselves and
take full advantage of other people's
squeamishness. There's a certain je ne
sais quoi about being able to grimace at

people when you're walking down the
street and cause them to run away in
terror. There's a lot to be said for dis
covering what type of person refuses to
give you the time of day just because
you're wearing six watches.
There's also a real advantage of being
able to walk into a four-star restaurant
in leopard print spandex and say to the
maitre d': "Listen buddy, I think it
would be a good idea for you to give me
the corner window seat . . . unless, of
course, you want me to come back here
for every meal — breakfast, lunch and
dinner — until you do."
The best part about being a freak is
that you're never alone — there's a real
camaraderie involved. When I see anoth
er freak walking down the street we can
nod to each other because we know what
it's like. We can revel in the beauty of
taking this soft-edged world by surprise,
we can find delight in the things people
mutter about us behind our backs.
Because people are strange, when you're
even stranger.

Mike Nichols had to cut off his nails for
a show called "Three Blind Mice" that's
playing at 8 p.m. and midnight today
through Saturday at Lambda Nu; he
suggests you come see it.
