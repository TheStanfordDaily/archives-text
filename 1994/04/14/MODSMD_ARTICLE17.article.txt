Constitutional Amendment: Senate Bill XXII-A&R-8
O YES (D NO
To amend the constitution of the association to allow for undergraduate and graduate stu
dents to finance campus organizations of particular interest to one of the two groups.

IT'S WIDELY held that the cur
rent special-fee system often
"taxes" graduate students for
projects, programs and activities
that are mainly geared toward
undergraduates. However, Consti
tutional Amendment/Senate Bill
XXII-A&R-8 is not the proper way
to fix the current system.
If this amendment passes, special
fees will be approved separately by
undergraduates and graduate stu
dents. If both groups approve a fee,
they will both fund it; if one group
approves a fee and the other one
doesn't, the approving group will
shoulder the entire funding burden.
While that general premise may
have some merit, the major flaws
with this proposal lie in its details.
The biggest problem is that the

amendment does not require a min
imum percentage of students to vote
in either the undergraduate or grad
uate populations. The lack of a min
imum voting requirement, such as
the one currently in place, potential
ly allows a small number of students
to determine the fate of all students.
Under the bill as it stands now, a
handful of graduate students could
decide which organizations the
entire graduate student body sup
ports. The same situation would
apply to undergraduates.
Such a system would be downright
unjust. Students should vote "no" on
this amendment and demand the
new senate undertake a thorough
reconstruction of the special-fee sys
tem that is fair to all — undergradu
ates and graduate students alike.
