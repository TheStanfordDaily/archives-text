# ASSU ELECTION
## ENDORSEMENTS 
### 
Because of last night's announcement that MEChA's special fee was incorrectly
listed on the ballot and in the ASSU Elections Handbook, The Daily's editorial
board has changed its recommendation regarding the group's request. For fur
ther explanation of the error, please see the news story on the front page.

AASA $42,020 ($3.00)
WITHOUT RECOMMENDATION
This group performs a myriad of valuable activ
ities for Stanford and the surrounding commu
nity on a budget that has seen only a minimal
increase in recent years. AASA's current bud
get admirably serves a community that repre
sents nearly 25 percent of the undergraduate
and 10 percent of the graduate student body.
However, recognizing the current backlash
against special-fee funding, AASA must also
take some initiative to stay under budget and
help fund itself. It has cut some of its sparsely
attended programs and begun exploring the
possibilities of outside fund raising. But it needs
to lay these out in concrete terms in its budget,
which currently reflects minimal revenue
enhancement, despite its ability this year, for
example, to raise about $1,000 for the A3C at
the winter semi-formal. Perhaps by charging
active members (who reap the most benefits
out of semi-formals and other Asian communi
ty-targeted events), or channeling some profits
from some of its charitable events, such as
benefits for the formerly endangered A3C, back
to itself or starting other similar fundraising
events or activities AASA could lower the fund
ing burden it places on students.

Barrio Assistance $25,803
($1.84)
(DYES O NO
This tutoring program has been a boon to pro
moting East Palo Alto youngsters' interest in
academics for years. It has a well-defined goal
and structure and a noble purpose. Denying
this group funding for even one year would
harm its continufty. However, with annual per
pupil costs reaching about $500, the group
should re-evaluate some of its activities and try
to find other resources — perhaps, for exam
ple, some donations of supplies — to help fel
low students shoulder the financial burden.

Black Student Union $42,735
($3.05)
WITHOUT RECOMMENDATION
The BSU puts on a variety of events throughout
the year that benefit the entire community,
including Martin Luther King week, Black Liber
ation month and Malcolm X week. However,
the BSU is currently completely dependent on
special fees for funding; in the future, it should
look into supplemental sources of income other
than the special fee. The group is getting start
ed in this direction; it is considering turning the
Soul Food dinner — which will cost $3,500 next
year — into a fundraiser. The BSU also needs
to encourage graduate students to have a
stronger voice in its group.
Club Sports $164,894
($11.78)
DYES O NO
Although expensive, the Club Sports program
— which used to receive support from the Ath
letics Department — is a worthy cause. It sub
sidizes 18 different non-varsity teams, which
raise an average of two-thirds of their budgets
from sources other than the special fee. This is
one of the few groups that has high graduate
student participation; some teams are made up
of entirely graduate students.
Coalition Against $55,731
Sexual Assault ($3.98)
WITHOUT RECOMMENDATION
While CASA provides important referral and

outreach programs — and opportunities for stu
dent participation in these programs — it is part
of a large and complicated system of campus
groups which appear to fulfill similar functions.
CASA is part of a confusing network supported
by students, the University and the Women's
Center. Consolidation should be a top priority
for next year, and groups, such as the Rape
Education Project, under the coalition should
not have to request a separate special fee. The
University shows a lack of commitment by
funding only the Campus Sexual Assault
Response and Recovery Team — solely a clin
ical counseling service for sexual assault vic
tims — and one part-time position in Health
Promotion Services at Cowell. It is common
knowledge that sexual assault services must
go far beyond simple counseling, and the Uni
versity should not expect students to carry the
financial lion's share of referral and outreach
programs.
Coffeehouse Live! $31,236
($2.23)
O YES ® NO
Though it has a gem of an idea — to pay for
a real musical act to play at the Coffeehouse
once a week — this group's special fee rep
resents yet another service that shouldn't be
supported by students alone. Bon Appetit,
the owner of the CoHo, would surely profit
from this venture without providing any of the
funding. Members of the Concert Network
who are behind this project should try to work
with the Coffeehouse to split the cost more
fairly.
KZSU $120,444 ($8.60)
WITHOUT RECOMMENDATION
KZSU fills the criteria of reaching out to the
entire community in that staff members come
from both the undergraduate and graduate
population. It also does not have a frivolous
budget (most of their money will go toward
replacing old equipment). However, it is gener
ally agreed that KZSU's listenership is very
small outside of sports and a few talk shows.
The overriding reason for the limited number is
due to programming choices Students are sim
ply not seeing proportional returns to the fee
they pay. KZSU doesn't try to captivate its
Stanford audience; in fact, station members
said their main purpose is to train students in
radio, not cater to most students' musical
tastes If students are being asked to pay one
of the highest fees on the ballot, KZSU should
better tailor its programming to student prefer
ences.
Legal Counseling $91,108
($6.50)
NO RECOMMENDATION
MEChA $39,548 ($2.82)
WITHOUT RECOMMENDATION
There is no question that this group — with a
mission to create a cultural center and edu
cate the larger community — is a valuable
asset. Still, MEChA is largely dependent on its
fee request for survival, unwise for a group
which was hit hard by fee refunds and only
received 53.4 percent of the vote last year. In
the future, MEChA should investigate sources
of income to supplement its special fee. The
recent realization that the group's special fee
was erroneously inflated by $16,947 — and
overlooked — during the ASSU's appropria
tion process raises some questions about the
the group's financial oversights in the budget
ing process.

The Mind's Eye $14,649
($1.04)
DYES O NO
This quarterly literary magazine is increasing its
fee request so it can raise the number of copies
it prints each quarter from 1,000 to 3,000. Sub
missions are received from both graduate and
undergraduate students, and editors are not
paid. It receives funds from Pub Board and
academic departments, but a student special
fee would help offset printing costs, improve
distribution methods and increase the volume
of the magazine printed.
Project Motivation $12,954
($.93)
(DYES O NO
There are a few reasons for not supporting Pro
Mo, but one very compelling point earns it an
endorsement Pro Mo runs a high school visita
tion program for about 1,100 to 1,600 Chicano
students in the Bay Area. The program encour
ages students to attend college and works on
improving their self-esteem. However, Pro Mo
should ask the University to fund its Pro Fro
week programs. Pro Mo spends $4,557 on
events during Pro Fro week to encourage
minority enrollment here at Stanford.
Rape Education $23,882
Project ($1.70)
O YES (§>NO
The Rape Education Project organizes events
like Rape Awareness Week and tries to facili
tate dorm discussions on the subject. It also
distributes a book called Confronting Rape to
all students. Though it's a good cause, REP's
mission overlaps confusingly with other groups
— including the Coalition Against Sexual
Assault, which is also asking for a special fee.
The total money put into raising awareness
about sexual assault issues by this group,
CASA, the University, the Women's Center and
other on-campus counseling services amounts
to a lot, and could be used more efficiently.
REDWOOD $47,300 ($3.37)
WITHOUT RECOMMENDATION
Although REDWOOD offers great outdoor
experiences for both graduate and undergradu
ate students, its $24,760 for various salaries
seems remarkably high. REDWOOD gets rev
enue from the small fees it charges for first
year and quarterly trips, but as a student-fee
funded group, it could reconsider its distribution
of staff salaries and $8 per hour student
employee wages. REDWOOD commendably
recognized that its public service trips this fall
were not very popular and canceled them.
Sexual Assault $10,286
Legal Advocates ($.73)
d)YES O NO
A new group, SALA is composed of 14 Law
School students who are trained to offer legal
counseling and referrals for campus victims of
sexual assaults. The group wants funding so it
can be independent of related organizations
and services — including the University — to
give victims an unbiased review of their legal
options. SALA intends to work with the Coali
tion Against Sexual Assault and plans to devel
op a referral list of local attorneys. It also hopes
to educate the community on the legal issues
surrounding this subject.
Speakers Bureau $108,194
($7.72)
®YES O NO
The Speakers' Bureau never fails to bring a
wide range of engaging speakers anyone in the
Stanford community can go to see. They also
try to raise money by charging a small entrance
fee for their non-Stanford audience members.
The Speakers' Bureau is asking for a modest
fee increase and has decreased their operating
budget by about 7 percent.
Stanford Project $6,667
On Nutrition ($-47)
(DYES O NO
SPOON efficiently collects and distributes thou
sands of pounds of unused food each year
from campus kitchens and Housing and Dining
Services. Their workers are volunteers, and
your fee goes to support such essentials as
freezer upkeep and plastic bags. While the
group could try to get some items — like twist
ties and labels — donated, overall, the group
provides a great deal of service for a very small
amount of student money.
Stanford American $32,641
Indian Organization ($2.33)
(DYES O NO
SAIO is an excellent example of a group which
raises a lot of its own money and puts on
many successful programs for Native Ameri
cans and the Stanford community at large.
SAIO's annual Powwow brings in $65,000 and
with a little more effort, could be self-sustain
ing. SAIO raises money in many ways, such
as selling tacos and T-shirts. The group has
eliminated programs that are no longer popu
lar and has sought alternate sources of funds
for some projects from places like the Haas
Center for Public Service The group's fee
request increase is small, and the main new
activity that is being added is an alternative
spring break public service program None of
SAIO's members receive salaries
Stanford Axe $29,121
Committee ($2.08)
(DYES O NO
In addition to putting on the Big Game bonfire,
the Axe Committee produces a handbook dis
tributed to freshmen and also will maintain the
security of the Axe when it returns to campus.
It is also planning to get involved in sports other
than football.
Stanford Band $61,714 ($4.41)
®YES O NO
The Band is a unique group that sets Stanford
out from the crowd. It lost Music Department
funding three years ago, but still receives about
$20,000 each year from the Athletics Depart
ment. Through its performances at home football
and basketball games, its unscheduled marches
around campus, and the opportunity it offers to
all students, the Band has earned its special fee.
SCBN $44,071 ($3.15)
®YES O NO
Since its creation in 1992, SCBN has worked to
provide the Stanford community with new, inno
vative television programming. The station has

come a long way in attaining its goals. The sta
tion is currently looking to increase its service
to the Stanford community, possibly through
televising ASSU Senate and Faculty Senate
meetings. Most of the special-fee money
requested would go toward new equipment to
help the station get off the ground. The group
reaches out to the community, has a no-frills
budget, and aims to accommodate students. It
should be encouraged to increase underwriting
income.
Stanford Chaparral $9,994
($.71)
®YES O NO
This year, the Chappie has done a good job
consistently putting out an entertaining humor
magazine and recruiting new staff members. It
needs more money than Pub Board can give it
to ensure two issues per quarter. Ad revenues
for the Chappie are up, and its small fee
request will help it pay its printing costs. It
should look into ways to economize, such as
printing parts of the magazine on less expen
sive paper.
Stanford Concert $61,500
Network ($4.39)
(DYES O NO
The Concert Network has done a good job
recently in bringing big-name musical talent to
campus — including They Might Be Giants,
who are coming to Rinc-A-Delt in May. To keep
down costs, it should investigate other sources
of revenue, including corporate sponsors and
charging students a small amount for tickets.
The Concert Network should also check into
the feasibility of denying subsidized tickets to
students who refunded for its special fee, as
the Legal Office already does.
Stanford Daily $64,129
($4.58)
NO RECOMMENDATION
Stanford $9,423
Homelessness Action ($.67)
Coalition
O YES t NO
Although homelessness remains a chronic
problem in America, SHAC does not address
the issue in a cost-effective manner. With a
large portion of the fee going to speaker costs,
which a SHAC member said draws between 10
and 20 people per speech, their budget cannot
be considered worthwhile enough for all stu
dents to support. SHAC members should con
sider joining forces with local homelessness
groups instead of having a separate campus
group which holds meetings in Palo Alto.
Stanford in $53,527
Government ($3.82)
DYES ONO
SIG provides a valuable service for students
interested in learning about local and national
government. Staffed by about 50 unpaid stu
dents, SIG brings prominent speakers to cam
pus, helps students find jobs and internships and
offers stipends and fellowships for students. SiG
does a good job fund raising and should be
applauded for pushing the Public Policy Depart
ment to pay for the teaching assistants in the
jointly sponsored Public Policy 197 class.
Stanford Jazz $14,286
Orchestra ($1.02)
O YES D NO
While a jazz orchestra certainly enhances the
arts scene at Stanford, half of this group's spe
cial fee covers the costs of two festivals that its
approximately 18 members attend The group
has not projected any fundraising activities to
help subsidize its expenses or lower its special
fee request.
Stanford Journal $16,343
of International Affairs ($1.17)
WITHOUT RECOMMENDATION
This journal provides a wonderful opportunity
for undergraduates and graduate students to
publish their writings on international affairs
alongside the writings of top Stanford scholars.
But it is largely an academic journal and, as
such, should receive some funds from academ
ic departments. It raises some of its own money
through other schools' subscriptions to the jour
nal, but has minimal on-campus circulation.
Stanford Kayak $15,186
Club ($1.08)
O YES ® NO
The Kayak Club teaches kayaking and leads
several whitewater trips each year that anyone
can go on. The group is asking for a one-time
fee this year to purchase rafts. But at a time
when students are feeling the strain of addi
tional and constantly escalating special-fee
requests, they should not be asked to chip in
for a few rafts too. Since the club intends to
loan them out for dorm rafting trips, it should try
to cover its costs through these "rentals." Rent
ing kayaks and rafts to dorms may even make
a good business project.
Stanford Solar $34,500
Car Project ($2.46)
DYES O NO
The success of the Solar Car project has
brought a lot of prestige to Stanford, especially
its engineering departments, yet it must still
fund itself because the University has refused
to offer more than minimal assistance This is
because Stanford does not have departmental
research in these areas. The group tries to fund
as much of its project as possible, raising its
own $26,500 of its $50,650 budget The project
has a very tight budget, requesting funds
almost solely for supplies and maintenance,
which the group has to pay for because races
prohibit it from accepting donations. The group
also tried this year to include non-techie stu
dents in its project to boost its fundraising
efforts.
Stanford Safe $7,286
Transportation Program ($.52)
(DYES O NO
STOP'S barebones budget shows a strong con
sideration for student funds. In addition to giv
ing rides to about 50 students a week who don't
want to drive under the influence, STOP gener
ously loans its van to other groups, such as
Barrio Assistance and Senior Pub Night. The
drivers are volunteers, and your fee goes to
support basic items like gas, phones, insurance
and van repairs.

Stanford Symphony $7,143
Orchestra ($.51)
WITHOUT RECOMMENDATION
While it is worthwhile to have a student group
on campus promoting music, questions about
the orchestra's budget abound. The proceeds
from their quarterly concerts go directly to the
Music Department, which provides support and
some equipment. However, the advertisements
to promote these University-benefit concerts
are funded through student fees. Revenues
from the concerts should actually go to lower
students' special fees. Their saving grace is
that they do make valiant attempts at fund rais
ing at events like the Viennese Ball and the
Halloween Concert.
Stanford United for $73,649
Rape Elimination ($5.25)
(DYES O NO
SURE Escort serves a valuable function by
providing rides for members of the Stanford
community who do not wish to walk around
campus alone at night. Staff members must
make sure they do not deny male students
rides simply based on gender, as some stu
dents have experienced.
Stanford $5,714
Volunteer Network ($.40)
(DYES O NO
The SVN runs a number of good community
service projects including the Reach Out Today
and the Holiday Sharing Drive. However, it has
the wrong philosophy when it states in the Elec
tion Handbook, "SVN has grown increasingly
less dependent on the Haas Center for its fund
ing of these projects." This is nothing to brag
about at a time when student groups should be
scratching for alternate funding. The Haas Cen
ter trains SVN, and should certainly have a part
in its funding if it will lower the special fee. SVN
should be lauded for actually lowering its fee
request. Maybe the SVN financial director
should be loaned to a few other groups.
Students for $15,453
Environmental ($1.10)
Action at Stanford
O YES <§> NO
Of the SEAS requested net special fee, about
one-third of it, or $3,544.99, will pay for two
retreats for SEAS members, and for college
students from all over California to attend an
environmental conference at Stanford. The
conference costs include $1,800 for attendees'
food. The projected income from conference
dues is only $1,000. SEAS would not be out of
line asking the conference attendees to pay for
their own meals. While SEAS has several pos
itive programs, including its newsletter, the
Daily Planet, its budget does not show suffi
cient effort to decrease significant and unnec
essary costs to the student body.
Women's Center $30,218
($2.15)
(DYES O NO
The Women's Center is a valuable campus
resource, providing support to numerous small
er groups on campus. They put on some excel
lent campus-wide programs, such as Women's
Herstory Month. It is a concern that, in times of
tight budgets, the center wants to add another
paid position; however, if the center is indeed
being used more this might be justified. In the
future, the Women's Center should look for
innovative ways to economize: for example,
printing the Women's Guide on less expensive
paper or publishing it in the Directory.
You Can Make A $29,170
Difference ($2.08)
Conference
O YES NO
YCMAD's heyday has come and gone. While this
event drew thousands of people in the 1980s,
recent years have seen esoteric topics and
declining attendance. Last year, about 300 peo
ple attended; this year, around 400 came. Only
half of those were students. YCMAD is request
ing $29,170.00 — which amounts to more than
$50 per attendee, given recent attendence rates
Stuoents should no longer support a conference
which has failed to select topics of popular inter
est and failed to eliminate excesses.
