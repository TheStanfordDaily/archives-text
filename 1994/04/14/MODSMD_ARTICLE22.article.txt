# Profs honored with Bing teaching awards

### Linda Friedlieb Editorial staff 
Four Stanford professors have earned Bing
teaching awards and accompanying $30,000
stipends for their passion for imparting knowl
edge.

From a pool of professors
nominated by their fellow
faculty, Provost Condoleezza
Rice selected the third group
of Bing Fellows — Harry
Elain, associate professor of
drama; David Freyberg, asso
ciate professor of civil engi
neering; Robert Waymouth,
associate professor of chem
istry; and Philip Zimbardo,
professor of psychology.

Stanford trustee Peter Bing and his wife,
Helen, donated $5 million in 1991 for an
endowment to be used as an incentive to
improve teaching. The awards are for three
year terms, with a third of the award granted
each year.
Two-thirds of the money must be designated
for the funding of projects designed to improve
teaching and curriculum, while the remainder
can be used for any purpose.
The Bing award winners "exemplify what
Peter and Helen were trying to do with the
award," Rice said, "promoting excellence in
teaching and research."

In addition to his duties in the Drama
Department, Elam directs the Committee on
Black Performing Arts as well as serving as an
advisor and assisting with many campus drama
productions.
"For me, the most important thing is finding
some way to excite the student and engage
them in the material," Elam said, adding that
he hopes to make teaching "an interactive pro
cess in which we — both myself and the stu
dent — are involved."
Elam said he may use some of the award to
support the East Palo Alto Project, supported
by the Committee on Black Performing Arts.
The project involves "researching the history
and evolution of East Palo Alto and turning
that into two plays," he said. "The whole pro
ject is looking at education — the theory of
research and how that can be turned into per
formance."
Zimbardo, while he works in a different dis
cipline, also sees performance as an important
part of teaching, especially in large lectures
such as Psychology 1.
"One of the main issues is getting students
attention and maintaining that attention,"
Zimbardo said. "You can't be a good lecturer in
a large lecture without being somewhat of a
performer. It's a show. The only question is
how much of a show.
"For me, it's a big show," he added.
Zimbardo said he was honored by the award,
which he hopes to use to "take some risks" in

his research. "One of the things I've been able
to do is integrate my teaching and my research.
I get ideas about research from teaching exer
cises, and I find ways to incorporate my
research into teaching," he said.
Waymouth, a regular teacher of large, intro-

ductory chemistry courses,
said the trick is teaching stu
dents that his subject is appli
cable to their lives. "My own
feeling is that chemistry is I
very difficult and if people!
don't realize it's interesting
than it's dreadfully tedious,"
he said. "Half the battle is
almost being a cheerleader."
Waymouth said the cheer-

ing approach applies as well to students in the
laboratory as in the lecture hall. With his award
money, he said he hopes "to provide an oppor
tunity for undergraduates to present their
work."
"Presenting their work is half the fun," he
said.
The final Bing Fellow, Freyberg, has
received awards, including a Presidential
Young Investigator Award, for his research on
the behavior of water in the environment. He
spent four years as associate dean for under
graduate education in the School of Engineer
ing and he is also a member of the National
Research Council's board on engineering edu
cation.
