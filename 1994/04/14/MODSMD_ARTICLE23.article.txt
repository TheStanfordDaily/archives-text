### Burt Herman Editorial staff 
Four UC-Berkeley students
who came to Stanford looking
to "serenade the girls" could be
singing "Jailhouse Rock"
instead.
The students will be
charged with petty theft for
allegedly taking a fire extin
guisher from the Herrin Biolo
gy Building. Two of the men
will also be charged with
"prowling" for loitering near
553 Mayfield.
Stanford Police arrested the
students in the early morning
hours April 6, according to the
police report. Deputies initially
noticed two young men at
about 1 a.m. sitting in a car
parked in the Tresidder park
ing lot and also sighted two
others running from the lot,
the report said.
After a Stanford deputy
questioned the two men in the
car, Joshua Patrick Short and
Wael Alzayat, ages 19 and 18,
claimed to have no identifica
tion with them. Police later
found Short's identification in
the car, according to the
report.
Police also found a red five
pound fire extinguisher labeled
with Stanford tags in the back
of the car. When asked where

the extinguisher came from,
Short and Alzayat told the
deputy that another group of
students had placed it there.
The fire extinguisher was
later identified as missing from
the Herrin Biology Building
and was valued at $79. The
UC-Berkeley students told
police that they were on cam
pus "to serenade the girls,"
according to the police report.
At about 4:30 a.m., police
found the other two UC-
Berkeley students loitering
near 553 Mayfield. They were
identified as Arash Ross
Ghadishah and Edwin Yung
Mu Lin, both 18.
Ghadishah also told the
deputies that he did not know
how the fire extinguisher got
into the car. According to the
police report, all four young
men admitted to walking
through dorms and adjacent
areas to "serenade girls."
All four of the students were
arrested and later released.
They are scheduled to appear
in Palo Alto Municipal Court
on May 23, where they will
officially be charged with petty
theft. Ghadishah and Lin will
also be charged with "prowl
ing."
None of the four could be
reached for comment last
night.
