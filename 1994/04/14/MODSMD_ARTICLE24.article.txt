## Lannin realizes Cardinal dream Junior gymnast travels from far reaches of globe to impress team with strong routines, motivation to try new tricks 
### Vanessa Arrington Staff writer 
Meegan Lannin knows what she wants.
At the age of 14, she decided she would make it
her goal to get a gymnastics scholarship to Stanford,
and is now a Cardinal junior competing on three
events. Near the end of this season, she decided to
try executing three double backs in her floor routine,
a feat never before accomplished by a Stanford gym
nast. At NCAA Regionals last Saturday, Lannin
solidly performed this new routine.
"Meegan is amazing," said fellow gymnast and
junior Jenny Ward. "She is so powerful and so
strong, and is always continuing to learn new things.
She also has a positive attitude and doesn't let
things get to her."
After years of playing soccer, Lannin began to do
gymnastics at the age of 10. She competed at a local
club in Virginia for two years until it closed, then
began commuting to a club an hour away, where she
competed optionals, in which she created her own
routines as opposed to previous compulsory perfor
mances. After two years of optionals, she started
training for the elite level. In 1988, Lannin met that
goal by competing in Elite Nationals.
"When I made the move to Roanoke (the location
of Lannin's new gym), my life became gymnastics,"
Lannin said. "I remember doing my homework by
flashlight in the car."
During her sophomore year, she was recruited by
Penn State, where Breck Greenwood, Stanford's
current head coach, was coaching. When she was 16,
however, her family moved to Thailand, and Lannin
trained periodically with the national team, trying to
keep in shape. While overseas, she spoke with
Greenwood, who had moved to Stanford in 1990,
and then reached her goal of becoming a Cardinal.
"Stanford was always my first choice," Lannin
said. "It has the best combination of academics and
athletics, for me."
Lannin prefers gymnastics on the college level
over the club level. Gymnastics is an individual
sport, but in college the gymnasts are competing for
the sake of their team, which makes competing more
fun, according to Lannin. She also feels like she is
balancing her time between friends and gymnastics
better now that she is in college.

"When I was younger, I made the choice to focus
on gymnastics, and I never felt like I was sacrificing
things," Lannin said. "But I also didn't have a social
life out of the gym."
"I am doing more gymnastics now than ever, but
I am still taking advantage of the other things here."
Lannin enjoys spending time with her friends and
skiing. She is also a member of the Kappa Alpha
Theta sorority on campus. Lannin plans to major in
Organizational Behavior and obtain a consulting job
in San Francisco after graduation and before attend
ing business school.
Lannin competes for Stanford on vault, uneven
bars and floor. Due to a back injury during her
sophomore year, she has been unable to compete on
the beam.
"My favorite and best event is vault," Lannin
said. "I like the quickness, and the feel of it in the
air. But in terms of performing, floor is my favorite."
Lannin received her best score of the season, a
9.675, on vault against Arizona State. She began the
season competing a layout tsukihara with a full
twist, arguably the toughest woman's vault in the
world. She spent most of the season competing a
tuck tsukihara full, though, and plans to perfect her
original vault next year.
"Like most Stanford gymnasts, Meegan typically
wants to do more than we ask of her," Greenwood
said. "She is highly motivated, and has already sur
passed the level I thought she would reach."
This season on the bars Lannin consistently exe
cuted two major release moves — a geinger and a
tkatchev, a trick that is a trademark of a big league bar
routine — and had only a few falls. Her highest bar
score of the season, a 9.650, was received at a home
meet against California, Minnesota and UC-Davis.
Each year Lannin has increased the difficulty in
her floor routine. This season, she brought in her
highest score of 9.675 against Washington. Overall,
Lannin has improved considerably this year on bars
and floor, according to Greenwood.
"Meegan got the Most Improved Gymnast Award
her first year, but since then she has put on 10
pounds of muscle and really improved her strength,"
Greenwood said.
When Lannin first came to Stanford, she would
perform well during practice and then crash at com
petition, according to Greenwood. But each year, she

has been perfecting her mental skills at competing
while raising her level of gymnastics, and has become
one of the most consistent Cardinal gymnasts.
"Meegan is a very talented gymnast, and has real
ly been scoring high for us," Greenwood said. "She is
also really fun, and probably the team comedian.
"She is a positive force on the team," Greenwood
continued. "When she gets frustrated, she will
briefly scream or kick something and then laugh.
She would never mope around the gym."
A unique aspect of Lannin is her ability to do

tricks without learning the progression. According
to Greenwood, she has proven this ability so many
times that, even though she is unable to do any of
the progressions to execute a full-in (a double back
with a full twist), she will begin practicing full-ins at
the beginning of next year.
"I am anxious to join the other three seniors and
lead the team in the gym next year," Lannin said. "I
would like to become an Ail-American (the top 12
gymnasts on each event at NCAA Nationals) — It
would be nice to leave Stanford with that."

air. But in terms of performing, floor is my favorite."
Lannin received her best score of the season, a
9.675, on vault against Arizona State. She began the
season competing a layout tsukihara with a full
twist, arguably the toughest woman's vault in the
world. She spent most of the season competing a
tuck tsukihara full, though, and plans to perfect her
original vault next year.
"Like most Stanford gymnasts, Meegan typically
wants to do more than we ask of her," Greenwood
said. "She is highly motivated, and has already sur
passed the level I thought she would reach."
This season on the bars Lannin consistently exe
cuted two major release moves — a geinger and a
tkatchev, a trick that is a trademark of a big league bar
routine — and had only a few falls. Her highest bar
score of the season, a 9.650, was received at a home
meet against California, Minnesota and UC-Davis.
Each year Lannin has increased the difficulty in
her floor routine. This season, she brought in her
highest score of 9.675 against Washington. Overall,
Lannin has improved considerably this year on bars
and floor, according to Greenwood.
"Meegan got the Most Improved Gymnast Award
her first year, but since then she has put on 10
pounds of muscle and really improved her strength,"
Greenwood said.
When Lannin first came to Stanford, she would
perform well during practice and then crash at com
petition, according to Greenwood. But each year, she

has been perfecting her mental skills at competing
while raising her level of gymnastics, and has become
one of the most consistent Cardinal gymnasts.
"Meegan is a very talented gymnast, and has real
ly been scoring high for us," Greenwood said. "She is
also really fun, and probably the team comedian.
"She is a positive force on the team," Greenwood
continued. "When she gets frustrated, she will
briefly scream or kick something and then laugh.
She would never mope around the gym."
A unique aspect of Lannin is her ability to do

tricks without learning the progression. According
to Greenwood, she has proven this ability so many
times that, even though she is unable to do any of
the progressions to execute a full-in (a double back
with a full twist), she will begin practicing full-ins at
the beginning of next year.
"I am anxious to join the other three seniors and
lead the team in the gym next year," Lannin said. "I
would like to become an Ail-American (the top 12
gymnasts on each event at NCAA Nationals) — It
would be nice to leave Stanford with that."

Junior Meegan Lannin strikes a pose during her floor exercise earlier this year at BYU. Lannin is known
for her ability to attempt difficult moves with little or no set up.
Meegan Lannin knows what she wants.
At the age of 14, she decided she would make it
her goal to get a gymnastics scholarship to Stanford,
and is now a Cardinal junior competing on three
events. Near the end of this season, she decided to
try executing three double backs in her floor routine,
a feat never before accomplished by a Stanford gym
nast. At NCAA Regionals last Saturday, Lannin
solidly performed this new routine.
"Meegan is amazing," said fellow gymnast and
junior Jenny Ward. "She is so powerful and so
strong, and is always continuing to learn new things.
She also has a positive attitude and doesn't let
things get to her."
After years of playing soccer, Lannin began to do
gymnastics at the age of 10. She competed at a local
club in Virginia for two years until it closed, then
began commuting to a club an hour away, where she
competed optionals, in which she created her own
routines as opposed to previous compulsory perfor
mances. After two years of optionals, she started
training for the elite level. In 1988, Lannin met that
goal by competing in Elite Nationals.
"When I made the move to Roanoke (the location
of Lannin's new gym), my life became gymnastics,"
Lannin said. "I remember doing my homework by
flashlight in the car."
During her sophomore year, she was recruited by
Penn State, where Breck Greenwood, Stanford's
current head coach, was coaching. When she was 16,
however, her family moved to Thailand, and Lannin
trained periodically with the national team, trying to
keep in shape. While overseas, she spoke with
Greenwood, who had moved to Stanford in 1990,
and then reached her goal of becoming a Cardinal.
"Stanford was always my first choice," Lannin
said. "It has the best combination of academics and
athletics, for me."
Lannin prefers gymnastics on the college level
over the club level. Gymnastics is an individual
sport, but in college the gymnasts are competing for
the sake of their team, which makes competing more
fun, according to Lannin. She also feels like she is
balancing her time between friends and gymnastics
better now that she is in college.

"When I was younger, I made the choice to focus
on gymnastics, and I never felt like I was sacrificing
things," Lannin said. "But I also didn't have a social
life out of the gym."
"I am doing more gymnastics now than ever, but
I am still taking advantage of the other things here."
Lannin enjoys spending time with her friends and
skiing. She is also a member of the Kappa Alpha
Theta sorority on campus. Lannin plans to major in
Organizational Behavior and obtain a consulting job
in San Francisco after graduation and before attend
ing business school.
Lannin competes for Stanford on vault, uneven
bars and floor. Due to a back injury during her
sophomore year, she has been unable to compete on
the beam.
"My favorite and best event is vault," Lannin
said. "I like the quickness, and the feel of it in the
air. But in terms of performing, floor is my favorite."
