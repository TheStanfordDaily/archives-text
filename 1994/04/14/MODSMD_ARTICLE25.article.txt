## Crews place sixth, seventh in San Diego 
### Heather Hardwick 
Last weekend marked the passing of the
prestigious San Diego Crew Classic in Mis
sion Bay, Calif. The event involved both the
men's and women's crew teams at the varsi
ty, junior varsity and novice levels. In a com
petitive field of about twenty boats, featur
ing teams from both the strong Ivy League
schools and rivals from the Pacific 10 Con
ference, Stanford was able to make a strong
showing.
The men's varsity boat finished seventh
overall. This place did not quite meet the
men's expectations, but in terms of speed,
the races represented a definite achieve
ment. According to varsity coach Wieslaw
Kujda, the "heats weren't honest.
"In the initial heats we were racing with
boats that placed second, third and fourth in
the final, and we only lost by a half a sec
ond," said Kujda.
The Cardinal varsity boat actually rowed
faster than the fourth place boat in the final,
but unfortunately, the original heats set up
the ultimate placement.

"On the whole, I feel the varsity did the
job. They're on the right track." Kujda said.
The junior varsity and freshman men's
teams placed sixth and third, respectively.
However, these results were a little lower
than they'd hoped, and Kujda blamed the
performance on inexperience.

'It was the first time the var
sity women had made the
finals in several years. It had
been one of our main goals
of the season.'

"The junior varsity and freshmen need to
learn how to use what they've gained from
the preparation period," Kujda said. "They
need to work more psychologically than
physically."

Kujda said the power of the younger
teams lies in their physical strength, but to
make the most of this resource, they need
to work on their sharpness and race readi
ness.
The varsity women, who placed sixth,
were very pleased with their performance.
Varsity women's coach Jocelyn McCandless
said she was happy with the team's perfor
mance.
"It was the first time the varsity women
had made the finals in several years," she
said. "It had been one of our main goals of
the season."
The team was able to beat Washington
State despite tough conditions, thereby
avenging a past loss. The environmental cir
cumstances were very windy and there were
definite favorites in lanes.
"We rowed in tough lanes. Given the con
ditions, we did a good job," said McCandless.
The junior varsity women also qualified
for the finals, posting a strong fourth place
finish overall, while the novice team came in
10th. Overall, McCandless pointed
out that the strength of the teams
was demonstrated by "a very good
sprint in the heats, and the ability to
come from behind." In keeping with
Kudja's citation of a lack in "sharp
ness" in the men's team, McCand
less noted the women also need to
work on their starts.
However, despite the many fac

tors contributing to last weekend's
results, Coach McCandless
described it as "one of the best over
all performances for Stanford crews
in quite some time."
Stanford will take this weekend
off from competition, giving the
teams a chance to develop areas
that need work. Ivooking two weeks
ahead, the Stanford Regatta lurks
on the horizon. Along with UCLA
and Washington State, this regatta
features the "Big Row," as Cal
comes to the Stanford home course
at Redwood Shores April 23-24.
