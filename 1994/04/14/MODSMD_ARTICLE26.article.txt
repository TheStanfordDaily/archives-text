# Softball surprises St. Mary's with twin-bill split
## Women avenge early season shut-outs by pounding out 22 hits in two games 
### Randy Reback Staff writer 
It's mid-April and things are
starting to heat up â€” especially
the bats of the Stanford softball
team, which knocked out 22 hits
as the Cardinal split a double
header against St. Mary's Tues
day.
St. Mary's offense struck first
in the opener, scoring one run in
each of the first two innings. The
Cardinal bats would not be silent
for long, however, as Stanford
exploded for six runs in the
fourth inning.
"Our spirits weren't really
high at the time," said sopho
more third baseman Toni Maren
go. "We had made some errors in
the first inning, and our feet were

dragging. Then one person got a
hit and the whole team rallied."
The Gaels rebounded to tie the
game with four runs in the fifth
inning off Cardinal starter
Angela Webb.
In the next inning the Stan
ford lineup responded by driving
in three more runs. Webb, a
freshman, allowed a run in the
bottom of the inning, but then
shut down St. Mary's in the sev
enth to earn a 9-7 victory.
In the second game, St. Mary's
once again struck early, scoring
two runs in both the first and
third innings. The Cardinal post
ed its first run in the third and
added one in the fourth, but the
Gaels drove three runners home
in the bottom of the fourth off
Cardinal starter Summer Lee.

After relieving Lee in the
fourth, freshman Katie Beattie
held the Gaels scoreless the rest
of the game. Despite collecting
eleven hits, the Cardinal was
never able to put a big inning
together and suffered a 7-4 loss.
Stanford's offensive perfor
mance was remarkably better
than during the team's last two
games against St. Mary's. During
the first week of Stanford's sea
son, the Gaels shutout the Cardi
nal twice during the Spartan Kick-
Off Tournament in San Jose.
"We were just smashing the
ball [on Tuesday]," said Cardinal
head coach Sandy Pearce. "The
next day we were lining the ball
hard in batting practice. I love it,
it's fun."
The best part of the Cardinal's

22 hits on Tuesday was that they
were spread throughout the line
up. Sophomore second baseman
Amanda Renteria, who has estab
lished herself in the lead-off spot,
led the way with four hits and
three runs scored. Junior Caryn
Okinaga, sophomores Marengo
and Lynn Anderson, and Lee, a
freshman, each contributed three
hits.
The Cardinal hopes to keep its
offense in gear when it visits
Point Loma for a doubleheader
tomorrow and travels to the Uni
versity of San Diego on Saturday
to play another pair.
"Not only are we hitting better
now, but we're playing better
defense," said Pearce. "If we con
tinue to play this well, we'll do
fine."
