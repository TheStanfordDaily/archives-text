Sunflower seeds, well-oiled gloves show
how new baseball season has now begun

It always starts about this time
of year. You can tell by the
sunflower seeds scattered
throughout the house, the dirty
cleats tossed in the garage, the
jock straps hanging in the laun
dry room — baseball season has
begun.
While football and basketball
receive their proper attention in
my house, their main function is
basically to fill time until spring
when the real sport starts. With a
devoted and what could even be
termed fanatical fervor, my
brother and dad follow, read,
watch, talk, play, eat, sleep,
dream and breathe the game from
the first day of spring training
until the last out of the World
Series.
Actually, the season begins
long before Opening Day. The
anticipation starts to build
around December with long, nar
row packages under the Christ
mas tree and the oiling and work
ing in of new leather. January is a
month of waiting, of lifting
weights and taking swings in
front of the mirror before Febru
ary finally arrives — and with it,
the first day of practice.
Almost as far back as I can
remember, my brother has played
the game. From his early days of
glory as the standout of his first
grade Little League team to his
current spot as the starting sec
ond baseman in high school, my
family has shared in his home
runs and MVPs as well as his
strikeouts and slumps.
However well his team hap
pened to be doing, whether strug
gling just to break .500 or a shoe
in for the league championship,
he and my dad would deliver a
play-by-excruciatingly-detailed
play recap after each game. Once
the two had delivered a thorough
review, they began on the second
round, rehashing throughout the
night in case a bunt or a stolen
base had been left out during the
first go-round.

The outcome of the day's game
pretty much dictated the mood in
the house that night. Missed a
double play in the second? Went
down looking in the fourth? Hey,
I've got a lot of homework to do,
I'll be in my room.

My brother's first word was
"ball," and the guy has always
had a crazy love and affection for
his baseball equipment. When he
was in third grade, he actually
named his bat and has also been
known to sleep with his glove
beside him, just in case someone
might walk off with it in the
night.
Even though my brother has
played baseball practically all his
life, my father is truly our fami
ly's most devoted fan. In fact, his
absorption in the game caused me
many embarrassing moments as
we would be sitting on the bleach
ers and he would jerk and twitch
in response to what was happen
ing on the field. I learned the
finer points of the sport — subtle
pick-off strategies, shrugged
signs, proper bunting techniques
— all from my dad, a source of
unending stats, knowledge and
insights.
While my family's not one but
two batting cages are a clear indi
cation that the sport has taken an
unnatural grip, baseball has also
provided us with quality bonding
time.
During the summer we have
traveled to such envied destina
tions as Yakima, Wash, and


Sarah
Nagae
Canby, Ore. They may not be
everyone's ideal weekend get
away spots but I can proudly say
I've been to just about every
ballpark in the Pacific North
west.
Despite the one-topic conver
sations, the pain that comes with
hours of sitting on the bleachers
and the rather interesting road
trips, I must admit I too share an

affection for the game.
Yes, I also took the field in
high school, strived to improve
my swing during sessions in the
cage and, admittedly, own my
own catching mask. It may be
genetic, but most likely it's just
a natural part of life in a base
ball-crazed family.

Sarah even surprises herself
with her baseball mastery some
times. Just last week, sice found
herself adding a split-fingered
fastball to her impressive pitch
ing repertoire.
