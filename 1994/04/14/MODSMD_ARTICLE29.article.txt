# Women's water polo dives into a whole new ocean
## Cardinal balances experience and new blood in preparation for Western Qualifiers 
### Kyle Utsumi Stall writer 
This has been a great year for
Stanford water polo.
In the fall, the men's team cap
tured the NCAA title, and last
weekend it continued its success
by winning the Spring Collegiate
Championships.
This weekend the Stanford
women's water polo team will look
to make a big splash, as it heads for
the University of the Pacific in
Stockton to compete in the West
ern Qualifiers. The Cardinal will
need to finish among the top four
or five teams in the western zone
to be invited to the National
Championships, which will be held
in Michigan.
"It will be tough, because the
teams in the West are better than
those on the East Coast," said
coach Ben Quittner. An assistant
for several years with the men's
program, Quittner took over the
head coaching position of the

women's team.in January.
"The Rast is not as far behind
(the West) in women's water polo
as they are in men's," he added.
"There are more women's teams,
so the power is spread out more."
The Cardinal has established
itself as an up-and-coming power
in women's water polo, largely due
to the commitment made by the
players since the announcement
that the program would become
varsity in the 1995-96 year.
"We're playing well," Quittner
said. "We've got a brand new team,
a new coach and a new attitude.
Before, there was always a different
coach and a different mentality."
Stanford's team features a bal
anced group of players. Quittner
looks to four seniors, Joanna Rein
hardt, Katie Sternfels, Liz Wasson
and Karen Suskiewicz, to share
their experiences with the younger
players, many of whom did not
play water polo before this year. As
many of the team members are
former swimmers, speed is one of

the Cardinal's top assets.
Quittner will also rely on the
play of freshmen such as Amy Hid
deson, Alice Cathcart, Becky Neill
and Olivia White, who will become
the core of the team in the upcom
ing years.
"We have a really good fresh
man class," Quittner said.
"They've really been performing.
These will be our main people in
the future — we're building our
team now."
As for the immediate future,
Quittner and his squad are pre
pared to challenge for a spot at
nationals.
"I'm looking to finish anywhere
from fourth to sixth," Quittner
said. "There will be tough teams,
like UC-Davis and UC-San Diego,
who have had serious programs
for six or seven years."
Junior Nicki Bergstrom, a vet
eran on the squad, senses a differ
ence between this year's team and
years past.
"We've set more specific goals

and had more focus," Bergstrom
said. "This team's attitude is more
serious. We have a good chance to
finish in the top four this weekend.
We're prepared mentally. We have
to believe we can do it — we have
the skill."
Cathcart, who played high
school water polo in Mas
sachusetts before coming to Stan
ford, is aware of the test that lies
ahead for the Cardinal.
"There are tough teams," she
said. "This is a tough zone to qual
ify out of. It will come down to
who's mentally tougher."
"We've been working hard,"
Quittner said. "These women have
played against a lot harder compe
tition than in the past, and they've
held their own. We've had a lot of
fun while learning and practicing
hard. We want to follow the suc
cess of all the athletic programs at
Stanford."
For Cathcart, that means one
thing. "Before I graduate, I want
to be No. 1," she said.
