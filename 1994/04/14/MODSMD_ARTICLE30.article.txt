A racetrack bet with 100-1
odds paid off for Stanford after a
Hong Kong millionaire pledged
his $5 million prize for the
endowment of graduate fellow
ships for students from Asia.
Stanford parent Larry C.K.
Yung, chairman of the China
International Trust and
Investment Corporation, had
already donated $1 million to
Stanford when University
President Gerhard Casper,
during his recent trip to Asia,
visited Yung to thank him.
When Casper expressed his
desire to have parents and
alumni from Asia help fund
their children's education,
Yung donated his racetrack

winnings to the cause.
"We all saw great value — for
Stanford, the individuals, the
nations and, we trust, the world
— in giving the next generation
of international leaders on all
sides of the Pacific Rim a Stan
ford education," Casper said.
"Mr. Yung shared that vision
and made his generous gift
which we hope to build upon."
Yung won the money last
October when betting on the
horse "Best of Luck" at a Hong
Kong racetrack. He had origi
nally intended to bet on a dif
ferent horse, but a mistake on
the phone led to greater profits.
The money will be endowed
to fund graduate fellowships,
said Steven Suda, director of
Asian operations for the Office
of Development.
