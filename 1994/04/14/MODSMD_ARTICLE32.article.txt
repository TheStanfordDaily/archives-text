ASSU Elections are today.
Voting yes on The Daily's special fee will
help support the newspaper that you
and 25,000 other members of the
Stanford community turn to every day
for campus news.

The Stanford Daily is an independent, non-profit,
student-run newspaper that is the primary medium
for communicating news and events to the Stanford
community.
Our mission is twofold:
1) To provide professional news coverage of the
University community; and
2) To provide a valuable learning experience for
over 300 students per year
However, in the last three years, The Daily has
been forced to accomplish this mission while also
cutting $100,000 from its budget. Reductions in
advertising, caused by a sluggish economy and
continuing University budget cuts, have prompted
The Daily to reduce circulation and compensation
and lower the average paper size — while working
even more aggressively to maximize sales.
Your special fee will help avoid additional cuts,
which would include further reductions in circula
tion and fewer resources overall to adequately
cover the Stanford community.
No, The Daily will not immediately fold without
your vote. But you will undoubtedly notice a sharp

decline in the quantity and quality of coverage we
are able to provide. That means fewer stories,
fewer pages, less comprehensive coverage of
Stanford sports — in short, a paper that may not be
able to provide consistent coverage of campus
events and issues which concern and affect all of us.
Your special fee will ultimately ensure that The
Daily continues to report campus news — on bud
get cuts, layoffs, town meetings and other important
issues — in a timely manner (unlike UC-Berkeley's
Daily Californian, which is now published twice a
week due to lack of funds).
Sometimes, you may not agree with the positions
we take or the things we report on.
But by supporting The Daily, you will ensure that
student press at Stanford remains vibrant, open and
representative of a diverse range of student view
points. By supporting The Daily, you support our
independence, which guarantees that our coverage
will remain unswayed by pressures from any single
interest at the University. That is the responsibility
of any independent newspaper, and it remains our
abiding commitment to you.

• The Daily's special fee request represents a 6.5 percent increase over last year's request, not including inflation. This
is well below the 10 percent increase (not including inflation) which student groups were allowed. The Daily's Increased
costs mainly reflect an increase in the typesetting and printing charges associated with publishing a paper 161 days per year.
• Why does The Daily need a special fee If It Is a $ 1 million corporation? This Is a commonly asked question. The
answer: Being a $1 million corporation means that while we have about $1 million In revenue, we also have over $1 mil
lion in expenses. (Contrary to published reports, The Daily does not have a $1 million endowment.) Your special fee
helps make up the difference, and, for each student It amounts to less than three cents per Issue.
