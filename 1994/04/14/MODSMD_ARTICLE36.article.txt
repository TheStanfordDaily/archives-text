# East meets Hollywood Julie Tsai

I love movies, and every time I see a great
one, I get a little wistful. When I saw
"Farewell My Concubine," I wished that it
had been 1 who created such soul-rending art
from heartbreak. "The Joy Luck Club" had me
craving equally neat resolutions to all my con
flicts with my mother. I envied Stanford alum
David Henry Hwang's creative agility with
"M. Butterfly." In beautiful movies, even the
chores of everyday life become covet-worthy;
too bad they're not really as evocative and ex
quisite as "The Scent of Green Papaya."
And whenever I see Zhang Yimou's work
— he's the one who did "Raise the Red
Lantern," "Ju Dou" and"The Story of Qiu
lu" — 1 marvel at his eye for compelling
drama and the telling moment, as the grace
ful face of his muse and actress Gong Li al
ways makes me especially wistful. Aside from
all that wistfulness, though, this year I've
seen a lot more Chinese, Vietnamese, Asian-
American, Asian, Haitian, whatever, people
in film, and I think it's a lovely thing — and
about time.
When I was a little tike, happily and oblivi
ously absorbing such cultural gems as "The

Brady Bunch," "Good Times" and "Banana
Split," the only yellow person I can recall is that
housekeeper woman on "The Courtship of
Eddie's Father." I don't remember much about
her except that she was unnaturally pleasant,
had a beehive hairdo, and I was never sure
what exactly was going on between her and
Eddie's father. Ah, role models.
Or I suppose there was the occasional
Asian sidekick. Nothing wrong with that, I
suppose. George Takei made a profitable ca
reer out of it on "Star Trek," and one can al
ways find some goofy-looking Asian dude in
those raging '80s gang-dancing videos of
Michael Jackson. And Pat Morita elevated the
role to its zenith with the Yoda-like wisdom of
Mr. Miyagi in "The Karate Kid." I'm sure that
at one time or another we've all been grateful
that we know the "crane" move.
But anyone who's seen the current crop of
flicks based on Asian experience, including

such cross-cultural productions as "Heaven
and Earth" and"The Wedding Banquet,"
knows this is a new breed. Gone are the stereo
types of guru-like wizened old men and red
taloned dragon women in the corrupt bowels
of exotic, yet foreign, Chinatowns. These are
wizened men and dragon women on home
turf, even made human enough that "Regular
People" can relate to them.
There wasn't a dry eye in the house after
"The Joy Luck Club," though God knows I
tried. And 1 believe that all this tear-inducing
is due not just to immediate empathy with
some overwrought mother-daughter experi
ence, but because it forces one to get a clearer
vision of the conflicts others experience —
mothers, daughters, men, women, Asians,
non-Asians, cats, dogs, etc. Granted, the
movie had built-in pauses for sniffles, but I've
never seen so many Asian actresses on screen
together at once. Maybe they cried because

they were overcome with emotion, too.
Or perhaps the profusion of Asians films,
particularly ones from the old country, is not
based on common experience, but uncom
mon pain, the kind one can't imagine in our
idyllic Stanford existences, or not.
At least that's what our parents would have
us believe.
Dump all the analysis, though, and images
float back through my mind: the ambivalent
agony on the face of the opera kind at the end
of "Farewell My Concubine"; the bittersweet,
humorous ceremony of "The Wedding Ban
quet."
These films drive home more effectively
than my parents ever could a mixture of guilt
over student life and appreciation for univer
sal conflicts between people. The tacit mes
sage 1 hear beneath the surface says, "You
should be a more grateful child, you wretch."
Spoken like a true parent.
But I wouldn't mind if this year's Asian film
crop spawns more next year; this is a sort of
wist fulness 1 could handle more of.
And, I think, a sort of multicultural devel
opment in art that we can all welcome. ■
