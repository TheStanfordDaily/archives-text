# MCMIZ: KEEPING UP WITH THE WORLD'S MOST POPULAR MUSICAL
## 
### KIMBERLY CHRISMAN 
Bt keeps going and going and going. And
now it'scoming here, "Les Miserables" opens
next week in Cupertino — the show's first
Bay Area visit since its initial 1990 run in San
Francisco.
More than 30 million people worldwide
have seen "Les Miserables" since its 1985 Ix»n
don premiere, a box-office record that has
earned it the reputation of "the world's most
popular musical."
It's an impressive legacy for a show that
many said couldn't be done. Victor Hugo's grit
ty 19th-century novel was, at best, an unlikely
candidate for a Broadway musical, much less a
hit Broadway musical. A 1,200-page opus with
an unpronounceable name, the book's only
previous claim to pop-culture fame was as the
inspiration for the TV series "The Fugitive."
Its characters are drawn from the lowest or
ders of French society — peasants and petty
criminals, starving students and doomed revo
lutionaries. The show itself is entirely sung,
with almost no dancing and minimal spectacle.
Nine years and 20 countries later, "Les Mis
erables" is well on its way to becoming the
longest-running, highest-grossing, most ac
claimed musical ofall time. (.ailed "Les Mi/." by
those familiar with the show — and, by this
time, who isn't? — worldwide touring produc
tions are bringing 1 lugo back to the masses.
And the masses are loving it. Technical bril
liance aside, the musical is an ageless saga of re
demption, romance and revolution that
doesn't ask you to know anything about French
history. With its stirring songs (there are no
fewer than 25 cast albums) and time-tested
story, "Les Miserables" sweeps audiences along
in a tide of revolutionary fervor as the show
builds to its bloody climax.

Universal appeal
Perhaps no one understands the
universal appeal of "Les Miserables"
better than Richard Jay-Alexander,
the musical's director and executive
producer. Working directly under ,
London-based producer (Cameron
Mackintosh, Jay-Alexander acts as
the musical's manager, guardian and
head quality-controller.
Despite a slew of Tony Awards for
Claude-Michel Schonberg

and Alain Boublil's rousing score and Trevor
Nunn and John Caird's seamless direction, Jay-
Alexander attributes the show's continued in
ternational success to Hugo's story.
"There isn't a country in the world that
hasn't fought for change," he says. "Unemploy
ment, battered children, homelessness, hunger,
suicide, abused women — even though it's
1994, these conditions still exist every-

where."
These conditions, coupled
J with the $4.2 million production's
own considerable merits, keep au-
I diences everywhere coming —
I and, often, coming back for more.
"You'd have to travel pretty
far to find someone who doesn't
like Les Miz," Jay-Alexander says.
"I'm sure there are one or two, but I
wouldn't want to meet them."
Jay-Alexander has

lost count of how many times he's seen the
show himself, but estimates that the number is
"in the thousand range."
And he's looking forward to the day when
"Les Miserables" can be licensed to amateur
groups and staged in entirely different ways.
"When it comes to amateur productions, 1
believe it will go down as the greatest musical of
all time," he says."It will never be dated."
)ay-Alexander is confident that the show can
succeed without its celebrated sets — which
include a turntable stage and an automated
barricade.
"It still works," he insists. "I know that be
cause I've rehearsed these companies from
scratch on ladders and chairs in basements.
When people are moved to tears in run
throughs, you know you've got something. The
set just enhances it."
A work in progress
"Les Miserables" is as attractive to perform
ers as to audiences, Jay-Alexander believes. Un
like many Broadway musicals, "Les Miserables"
is an ensemble piece, "not a kick line show or a
show with stars and a chorus. It's 37 actors tour
ing together."
"The main requirement for the show is feed
ing it with talent," he says. The numerous casts
currently performing the show around the
world are constantly restocked, ensuring that
the show is always fresh, always different —
"always a work in progress."
Since taking control of the show, Jay-
Alexander has made those casts even more var
ied by consciously hiring performers represent
ing a wide range of ages.
"On Broadway, we had very skilled people,
but they were all in their mid-305," he says."I like
to see the ages differ so it doesn't flatten out."
The touring cast currently on its way to Cu
pertino is in "tip-top form. There won't be any
sort of road tiredness, because we've just recy
cled a lot of people out of the cast and brought
new people in."
Coming off 11 weeks of sold-out perfor
mances in Singapore, "they're going to be very
anxious to kiss American ground," (ay-Alexan
der says.
Multicultural musical
In addition to his artistic duties, lav-Alexan

der acts as chief executive officer of what has be
come a major international industry.
Theaters hoping to host "Les Miserables" are
scouted out years in advance. The show's pro
ducers have turned down many invitations
from theater owners whose stages can't accom
modate the massive sets and cast.
"We can't leave scenery out on the sidewalk
like some touring shows do," Jay-Alexander
says.
Technically, the show remains intact from
city to city and country to country. "There are
always surprises — the turntable breaks — but
the show has traveled miraculously well," lay-
Alexander savs.
In Singapore, the American touring cast
performed on an Australian set, singing in Lng
lish with Mandarin surtitles — a multicultural
collaboration typical of the show's internation
al productions.
The Singapore show was the first interna
tional production to use surtitles — transla
tions projected above the stage. In other coun
tries, the lyrics have been translated into the
host's native tongue — 14 languages in all. lay-
Alexander describes the surtitles as "part of
conquering the East."
Indeed, Asia is one ot the tew places "Les
Miserables" has not toured extensively, along
with Mexico and South America. Jay-Alexan
der hopes to change that soon.
The touring production is currently booked
for five years, with shows still selling out in Lon
don and on Broadway. Jay-Alexander warns
that because of these commitments, "it's going
to be a long time before we're in the Bay Area
again."
By that time, Jay-Alexander will no doubt
have added to his long list ot credits, which in
clude executive producer ot the Broadway pro
ductions of Mackintosh's "Miss Saigon and
"Five Guys Named Moe."
Mackintosh is currently planning a revival of
"Oliver!" in London and a new musical by the
"Les Miserables" creative team, based on the
story of Martin Guerre. Both projects promise
to be nothing short of revolutionary. ■
