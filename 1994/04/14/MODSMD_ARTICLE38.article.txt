# See how they run
## 'Three Blind Mice' shows what can happen in a second 
### Lisa Corrigan 
The set of "Three Blind Mice" offers
nothing save three chairs and some
peripheral branches. The empty black
space, illuminated by a few visible lights, will
become the final playing ground of the Ex
perimental Theatre Laboratory as its mem
bers perform their last Stanford production,
opening tonight in the New Theatre in the
Lambda Nu lounge.
The show is directed by Babak Ebrahimi
an, a graduate student at Stanford for the
past four years. Junior Tyler Graham and se
niors Matthew Getz and Michael G. Nichols
are the three primary actors of the Experi
mental Theatre Laboratory. Running until
Saturday, with showings at 8 p.m. and mid
night each night, their latest piece is a "self
generated text that came out of a workshop
— self-generated by the empty space a nd us"
according to Ebrahimian. As Graham simply
states, "The process of filling up the space is
the play."
The space is filled, according to Ebrahimi
an, by "one second. On one level, the whole
thing is the explosion of one second, a very
special second. That one second is called a
"kairos" — a moment of change that every
one goes through in (his or her] life."
Nichols, who has performed in all of
Ebrahimian's productions, elaborates on the
definition. "Kairos is originally a Greek no
tion. It is the moment in which everything
that preceded that instant seems to have led
up to it, and everything that follows the in
stant seems to have been because of the mo
ment. It is sort of a pinnacle, a turning
point."
In exploring that second of kairos,
Ebrahimian explains that "we look at it [the
second] within the architecture of love,
friendship, humanity and dreams."

"These are all things that
everybody shares on a very per
sonal level," Nichols adds.
"With humanity, the moment of
giving and sharing that every
one can relate to and under
stand is not something that just
happens, it's something that

comes out of your real person, instead of just
your functioning person. It comes out of
your soul."
Unlike much of experimental theater,
which can be esoteric and enigmatic,
Nichols claims that "we're addressing issues
in this play which are accessible to everyone.
When they see a moment of humanity or
share of moment of friendship, or a moment
of love, they can be taken back to this (pro
duction] and remember some of what it was

all about, what we were trying to say. It is a
vision of what is true and what is real ...
about love, about friendship."
In a scene titled "Lady at the Beach," a
moment of a relationship with a woman on
the beach is simultaneously acted out by one
actor and narrated by another. The depic
tion of this second could be a moment of
kairos for any of them. The rest of the play
could indeed be illuminating, brief turning
points, or may in the end result in one mon-

umental pinnacle.
The ensemble was one of Ebrahimian's
earliest theater groups at Stanford. Now, for
Ebrahimian, "Three Blind Mice" is "a very
special production because in a way 1 think
it's the last piece of theater we're going to be
doing as a group because we've been work
ing as a group for a very long time," he says.
"This is pretty much the trickling of the
group, the last remnants of the so-called
group, the ensemble. It is in a sense a gift, the

final gift we arc giving to our past collabora
tors, our friends, our past audiences, a final
gift that combines four years of experience."
Nichols, having been with Ebrahimian
since the beginning, shares the same senti
ments concerning the nature of their final
production. "There is something in this
show from all our past shows, and we've
taken what we've learned over the. last four
years from working as a group, and put it
into a production that moves in a different
direction."
Indeed, the minimalist theater of "Three
Blind Mice" is a far cry from Ebrahimian's
past history of shocking visual imagery.
"We're very happy with it because it's very
raw," Babak reports.
"1 believe that it's honest. We're not using
a bathroom filled with water, or thousands
of carnations, or naked bodies hanging up
side down covered with smoke at the end, it's
not a script, it's what you see. It's a black box,
an empty space."
Ebrahimian quotes director Peter Burke
when describing this production in compar
ison to his others. " 'You go with your hands
empty to the audience, you roll up your
sleeves and begin to work. There is no cheat
ing involved.' An empty space, a black box
theater, that's what this is. There is no cheat
ing involved."
He describes the development of his the
ater as a "very special and unique... process
to us, which is a combination of Zen and
ROTC: a lot of warm-ups, a lot of push-ups.
The actors were drinking water, purifying
themselves, living in the space, inhabiting
the space, making the space smell like us so
that for the audience it is another time, an
other place." Since Ebrahimian's style re
quires obvious dedication, some in the past

have developed a cult vision of his
group. From this sprang a whole
new vocabulary, such as
"Babakian," and "Babakish," ad
jectives which Ebrahimian be
lieves stereotype and objectify his
work.
Thus, Ebrahimian said he

feels this final work with this group is also a
response to misnomer of "avant-garde,"
pinned on the group by critics. "It is a re
sponse to show that we are not avant-garde,
but very simple, with nothing in our hands,
nothing in our sleeves." ■

stant seems to have been because of the mo
ment. It is sort of a pinnacle, a turning
point."
In exploring that second of kairos,
Ebrahimian explains that "we look at it [the
second] within the architecture of love,
friendship, humanity and dreams."

"These are all things that
everybody shares on a very per
sonal level," Nichols adds.
"With humanity, the moment of
giving and sharing that every
one can relate to and under
stand is not something that just
happens, it's something that

comes out of your real person, instead of just
your functioning person. It comes out of
your soul."
Unlike much of experimental theater,
which can be esoteric and enigmatic,
Nichols claims that "we're addressing issues
in this play which are accessible to everyone.
When they see a moment of humanity or
share of moment of friendship, or a moment
of love, they can be taken back to this (pro
duction] and remember some of what it was

all about, what we were trying to say. It is a
vision of what is true and what is real ...
about love, about friendship."
In a scene titled "Lady at the Beach," a
moment of a relationship with a woman on
the beach is simultaneously acted out by one
actor and narrated by another. The depic
tion of this second could be a moment of
kairos for any of them. The rest of the play
could indeed be illuminating, brief turning
points, or may in the end result in one mon-

umental pinnacle.
The ensemble was one of Ebrahimian's
earliest theater groups at Stanford. Now, for
Ebrahimian, "Three Blind Mice" is "a very
special production because in a way 1 think
it's the last piece of theater we're going to be
doing as a group because we've been work
ing as a group for a very long time," he says.
"This is pretty much the trickling of the
group, the last remnants of the so-called
group, the ensemble. It is in a sense a gift, the

final gift we arc giving to our past collabora
tors, our friends, our past audiences, a final
gift that combines four years of experience."
Nichols, having been with Ebrahimian
since the beginning, shares the same senti
ments concerning the nature of their final
production. "There is something in this
show from all our past shows, and we've
taken what we've learned over the. last four
years from working as a group, and put it
into a production that moves in a different
direction."
Indeed, the minimalist theater of "Three
Blind Mice" is a far cry from Ebrahimian's
past history of shocking visual imagery.
"We're very happy with it because it's very
raw," Babak reports.
"1 believe that it's honest. We're not using
a bathroom filled with water, or thousands
of carnations, or naked bodies hanging up
side down covered with smoke at the end, it's
not a script, it's what you see. It's a black box,
an empty space."
Ebrahimian quotes director Peter Burke
when describing this production in compar
ison to his others. " 'You go with your hands
empty to the audience, you roll up your
sleeves and begin to work. There is no cheat
ing involved.' An empty space, a black box
theater, that's what this is. There is no cheat
ing involved."
He describes the development of his the
ater as a "very special and unique... process
to us, which is a combination of Zen and
ROTC: a lot of warm-ups, a lot of push-ups.
The actors were drinking water, purifying
themselves, living in the space, inhabiting
the space, making the space smell like us so
that for the audience it is another time, an
other place." Since Ebrahimian's style re
quires obvious dedication, some in the past

have developed a cult vision of his
group. From this sprang a whole
new vocabulary, such as
"Babakian," and "Babakish," ad
jectives which Ebrahimian be
lieves stereotype and objectify his
work.
Thus, Ebrahimian said he

feels this final work with this group is also a
response to misnomer of "avant-garde,"
pinned on the group by critics. "It is a re
sponse to show that we are not avant-garde,
but very simple, with nothing in our hands,
nothing in our sleeves." ■

"Three Blind Mice" will be performed tonight
through Saturday at the New Theatre in the
Lambda Nu house. Tickets are $5 at the door

The set of "Three Blind Mice" offers
nothing save three chairs and some
peripheral branches. The empty black
space, illuminated by a few visible lights, will
become the final playing ground of the Ex
perimental Theatre Laboratory as its mem
bers perform their last Stanford production,
opening tonight in the New Theatre in the
Lambda Nu lounge.
The show is directed by Babak Ebrahimi
an, a graduate student at Stanford for the
past four years. Junior Tyler Graham and se
niors Matthew Getz and Michael G. Nichols
are the three primary actors of the Experi
mental Theatre Laboratory. Running until
Saturday, with showings at 8 p.m. and mid
night each night, their latest piece is a "self
generated text that came out of a workshop
— self-generated by the empty space a nd us"
according to Ebrahimian. As Graham simply
states, "The process of filling up the space is
the play."
The space is filled, according to Ebrahimi
an, by "one second. On one level, the whole
thing is the explosion of one second, a very
special second. That one second is called a
"kairos" — a moment of change that every
one goes through in (his or her] life."
Nichols, who has performed in all of
Ebrahimian's productions, elaborates on the
definition. "Kairos is originally a Greek no
tion. It is the moment in which everything
that preceded that instant seems to have led
up to it, and everything that follows the in
stant seems to have been because of the mo
ment. It is sort of a pinnacle, a turning
point."
In exploring that second of kairos,
Ebrahimian explains that "we look at it [the
second] within the architecture of love,
friendship, humanity and dreams."

"These are all things that
everybody shares on a very per
sonal level," Nichols adds.
"With humanity, the moment of
giving and sharing that every
one can relate to and under
stand is not something that just
happens, it's something that

comes out of your real person, instead of just
your functioning person. It comes out of
your soul."
