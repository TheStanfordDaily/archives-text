# Waltzing through time

### 
f / man steps up to a woman and
x / r asks her to dance. She accepts
/ and, to the straining sounds of
a waltz, they begin to polka, tentatively at
first, then, gaining confidence, swirling
around the dance floor in a blur.
Although it could be a scene from a
mid-19th century Jane Austen novel, this
old-fashioned courtship ritual is being
played out in the Roble dance studio at
Stanford.
The Stanford Vintage Dance Ensemble is
a perfect place for students who enjoy social
dances — such as the waltz, polka, quadrille
and reel — to strut their stuff. A two-unit
class, the dance ensemble is led by Dance
Division Prof. Richard Powers and attracts a
very diverse membership including gradu
ate students, undergraduates and members
of the Stanford community.
The dances range in style from waltzes of
the 1840s to ragtime-era swings. Most are
done in couples (the man leads of course),
while some are performed in lines, and still
others in diamond formations.
When it comes to social dance, enthusi
asm and experience count for more than
just raw talent. "People have been with the
group for two years, and they really have im
bued the whole style of moving. It's more
the experience — how long you've been
with the group — almost more than your
natural ability," Powers says.
And it's exactly this enthusiasm that
keeps Powers going. "The students are also
the strongest reason for staying out here [in
California). It is very satisfying to have that
degree of dedication and talent. The dancers
back then did have some training and some
technique, but these are social dances.
That's why it's very important that we keep
the spirit of what we're doing and not turn it
into another ballet or another musical the
ater."
A 'powerful' method
Fran Sheehan, a graduate student in me

chanical engineering, was involved with a
folk dance group before Powers came to
Stanford. When the old instructor left, she
and three other couples joined the Vintage
Dance Ensemble to keep the group going.
Her commitment to the dance ensemble
led her and the Ensemble to Japan this fall
and Washington, D.C. last month to per
form the dances. "Stanford wanted, be
cause Richard is so well known, to get a
name for Stanford and do these big perfor
mances."
Powers was much in demand, having cre
ated the most coveted vintage dance ensem
ble in America in Cincinnati, called the Fly
ing Cloud Academy. He has performed all
over the world, including Hollywood, with
roles in the movies "dory" and "North and
South." He was persuaded to come to Stan
ford two years ago. "The chair of the Dance
Division was trying to get me out here for a
number of years. It just happened that a year
and a half ago, things were fairly stable [and
1 could come]."
"There's this one part in 'North and
South' where you get a good look at him, his
face is right in the camera" laughs James
Mendoza, a first-year graduate student and
an Ensemble member.
In fact, it was during his graduate student
days in engineering at Stanford that Powers
discovered dance. It was only a hobby for a
long time, allowing Powers to pursue a ca
reer in product design. Interestingly
enough, he holds seven patents, the most
well-know of which is the tamper-proof cap.
Yet he found his niche researching 19th
century and ragtime dance, and has made it
his vocation ever since.
All rave about Powers' teaching style.
"Richard is an excellent teacher," says Barry
Lewis, a middle-aged electrical engineer
with Hewlett-Packard. "And I've seen a lot
of teachers."
Angela Amarillas, a freshman, agrees.
"Richard is wonderful. He has a charisma
that's hard to pinpoint. More than easy

going, he has an infectious style. It's great to
work with him — it's an honor to work with
him."
Amarillas should know, having been pro
moted to featured soloist in less than a quar
ter. "It's been so flattering. I've never been
spotlighted, I've always been chorus. In the
'Nutcracker,' I was always snow or a flower
or something," she laughs.
She joined the group winter quarter, after
hearing about it through her social dance
class. "I joined because I heard they were
performing at Spring Migration." Though
she has been involved in dance "since I was
about three," Amarillas had never explored
social dance, concentrating instead on clas
sical training: ballet, Spanish dance and
modern dance.
'Intergrating everyone'
She, too, has benefited from the travel ex
periences, traveling to Washington with fea
tured members of the dance ensemble last
month. "I was so flattered to be asked to go.
It was such an elite group," Amarillas says.
The preparation for the trip was intense
— Amarillas practiced more than seven
hours a week in addition to her other three
dance classes and pre-med courseload.
However, she says it was well worth it."It re
ally helped me understand how much dance
means to me."

When the Smithsonian Museum in
Washington, D.C. contacted Powers to give
a lecture on social dance history, he thought
it would be best illustrated not only by
slides, but through real demonstration. He
used his honorarium to purchase plane tick
ets for four couples in the group. The Stan
ford Dance Division and personal pocket
money of the group made up the rest. "To
take his salary and flip it into plane tickets
because that's what the dance was about (re
quires a lot of dedication]," Sheehan says.
"His love for the dance is really neat."
The couples made their authentic cos
tumes by hand, which included crinolines
and hoops, complete with curtain-like trim.
" They're so much fun to perform in," says
Sheehan.
Sheehan compares this experience with
her trip to Japan this fall. Paid for by a
Japanese organization interested in Ameri
can traditional dance, eight couples trav
eled, all expenses paid, to complement Pow
ers' instruction.
It turned out to be larger than anyone ex
pected. Powers gave microphoned instruc
tion to 1,200 people over the covered
Olympic pool in Tokyo. "It was impressive
that they built a wooden dance floor half the
size of a football field [over the pool) just for
this," Powers admits. Plus, all 600 women
were dressed in traditional American ball

room gowns, made expressly for this one
night.
"We don't want an elite group doing all
the performances outside Stanford," Shee
han points out, "but sometimes it's hard to
bring everyone else up to speed. Slowly but
surely we've been integrating everyone."
An outlet for expression
So what makes this class and this form of
dance so popular? "It's such a wonderful
form of expression," Amarillas says. Plus,
"it's social, it's a good way to meet people
and it's enjoyable. You're out there having a
good time and dancing."
Mendoza claims that his interest lies in
vintage dance's "intellectual component.
I'm excited about dance and the history be
hind it." But Mendoza says the real reason he
continues with the group is his teacher.
"[Richard has] changed my life. He's a great
teacher, you want to be around him. He's a
Renaissance man."
Mendoza got into dance late in his Stan
ford career. I le felt that "here I am at Stanford.
I should try something totally different [from
microbiology]." Of course, it didn't hurt that
a cute girl he knew was participating. "That
was my social motivation," he admits.
"I fell in love with the waltz," Mendoza
continues. He continued his training and
choreographed the opening dance at the Vi

ennese Ball this year. He is also working
dance into his curriculum as a school
teacher. "I've named all my kids' groups
after dances. One is the mazurka, another is
the polka, etc. 1 would love to create an in
terdisciplinary class involving dance, Amer
ican history and costumes."
Tango through the tulips
Powers agrees that the historical compo
nent is most interesting. The dance craze of
1844 was started by the immigration of the
Kuropean polka. "The waltz was earlier, but
it didn't catch on; it was forbidden. It was
not acceptable to hold someone in an inti
mate embrace in public."
Hut the polka waltz changed this attitude.
It was so good-humored and sunny that it
couldn't be seen as licentious, Powers ex
plains. And many other dances were off
shoots of this one. The Cancan, for example,
far from modern conceptions of women
dancing in a line, was started by French stu
dents as an "anarchistic mockery of the
dances they were taught in school."
Another of these is a tango. Different
from the modern tango and the Argentine
tango, this dance was described in 1856.
Powers reconstructed it entirely from its
written form.
Powers claims these dances have the same
pull in 1994 as they did 150 years ago.

"There is a tremendous variety," he says.
" 19th century and ragtime have spirited fast
dances, have slow sensual dances, have very
easy improvisational dances, have techni
cally challenging dances, and there's also the
contrast between 19th century and ragtime.
One could spend a lifetime studying these
dances and still have more to learn."
The dance ensemble's April 15 show will
recreate the program performed at the
Smithsonian Museum in Washington, D.C.
But instead of keeping it elite and in cos
tume, the whole ensemble will perform the
dances. "Richard could have kept it small,"
Sheehan says, "but instead he said, no, let's
let everyone perform."
In addition to the group dances, Amani
tas and Ken Delmar, a ballet instructor at
Stanford, will perform the 1856 tango. It
will be contrasted by Delmar's performance
of the Argentine tango with Buenos Aires
born Mariela Franganillo. "There are a lot of
contrasts [in this program], especially be
tween old and new," Powers says.
Though she is teased often for her ability
to learn new steps quickly, Amarillas claims
it was difficult for her to switch from ballet
to the tango. In fact, it took her a long time
to learn to follow a lead. "It was hard to let
go of my [ballet] training and perceptions."
Practicing projection
"It's not pretentious," Mendoza says of
the ensemble's dance style. "It's not like
competition ballroom with snapping heads
like in 'Strictly Ballroom.' We try to recreate
a period with mirth and merriment." This
attitude was reflected in his Viennese Ball
choreography which brought in some
"humor and playfulness" through its paro
dy of Disney movies and role-reversal danc
ing, where the woman takes the lead.
At tonight's rehearsal, only 10 days re
main until the show. Still, everyone is smil
ing, and Powers himself is very calm. He is
not looking for precise synchronicity. "I

don't have anything against perfection, but
once it becomes too much an exercise in
technique and too uniform and too ho
mogenized and too much of the Rockettes,
then it ceases to be an authentic recreation
of how our great-great-grandparents
danced."
The group practices a freestyle waltz,
moving erratically around the dance studio.
Some tudents spin in circles, flying around
the room, while others practice the basic
step. The quadrille requires four couples to
make a square, and the reel is a line dance
done in almost square dance style. Perhaps
the most popular dance, if the most ex
hausting, is the mazurka, and more than
one couple falls to the floor during an intri
cate move in which two couples pass
through each other.
Powers gives supporting, if honest criti
cisms. "It looks a little ragged," he admits after
one dance. "But some couples were just scin
tillating." During the dance, he shouts en
couragement. "Steamy, powerful, project it!"
The style carries over. "The most impor
tant thing to remember is the time period,"
says Sheehan. "Look how the hands are
going, look how the eyes are going, it's all
part of a performance style. When you fin
ish it, you don't just drop off, you stay in
character."
Clearly, the ensemble strives for strong
performances but has maintained a clear
sense of purpose: to have fun and provide a
creative outlet for its participants.
Powers smiles watching the group's
members dance the night away. "You can see
who's a hot shot and who isn't but they all
have the spirit. It's not about perfection.' ■

Victorian Dance Mama" Friday, April 15 at 8

quires a lot of dedication]," Sheehan says.
"His love for the dance is really neat."
The couples made their authentic cos
tumes by hand, which included crinolines
and hoops, complete with curtain-like trim.
" They're so much fun to perform in," says
Sheehan.
Sheehan compares this experience with
her trip to Japan this fall. Paid for by a
Japanese organization interested in Ameri
can traditional dance, eight couples trav
eled, all expenses paid, to complement Pow
ers' instruction.
It turned out to be larger than anyone ex
pected. Powers gave microphoned instruc
tion to 1,200 people over the covered
Olympic pool in Tokyo. "It was impressive
that they built a wooden dance floor half the
size of a football field [over the pool) just for
this," Powers admits. Plus, all 600 women
were dressed in traditional American ball

room gowns, made expressly for this one
night.
"We don't want an elite group doing all
the performances outside Stanford," Shee
han points out, "but sometimes it's hard to
bring everyone else up to speed. Slowly but
surely we've been integrating everyone."
An outlet for expression
So what makes this class and this form of
dance so popular? "It's such a wonderful
form of expression," Amarillas says. Plus,
"it's social, it's a good way to meet people
and it's enjoyable. You're out there having a
good time and dancing."
Mendoza claims that his interest lies in
vintage dance's "intellectual component.
I'm excited about dance and the history be
hind it." But Mendoza says the real reason he
continues with the group is his teacher.
"[Richard has] changed my life. He's a great
teacher, you want to be around him. He's a
Renaissance man."
Mendoza got into dance late in his Stan
ford career. I le felt that "here I am at Stanford.
I should try something totally different [from
microbiology]." Of course, it didn't hurt that
a cute girl he knew was participating. "That
was my social motivation," he admits.
"I fell in love with the waltz," Mendoza
continues. He continued his training and
choreographed the opening dance at the Vi

ennese Ball this year. He is also working
dance into his curriculum as a school
teacher. "I've named all my kids' groups
after dances. One is the mazurka, another is
the polka, etc. 1 would love to create an in
terdisciplinary class involving dance, Amer
ican history and costumes."
Tango through the tulips
Powers agrees that the historical compo
nent is most interesting. The dance craze of
1844 was started by the immigration of the
Kuropean polka. "The waltz was earlier, but
it didn't catch on; it was forbidden. It was
not acceptable to hold someone in an inti
mate embrace in public."
Hut the polka waltz changed this attitude.
It was so good-humored and sunny that it
couldn't be seen as licentious, Powers ex
plains. And many other dances were off
shoots of this one. The Cancan, for example,
far from modern conceptions of women
dancing in a line, was started by French stu
dents as an "anarchistic mockery of the
dances they were taught in school."
Another of these is a tango. Different
from the modern tango and the Argentine
tango, this dance was described in 1856.
Powers reconstructed it entirely from its
written form.
Powers claims these dances have the same
pull in 1994 as they did 150 years ago.

"There is a tremendous variety," he says.
" 19th century and ragtime have spirited fast
dances, have slow sensual dances, have very
easy improvisational dances, have techni
cally challenging dances, and there's also the
contrast between 19th century and ragtime.
One could spend a lifetime studying these
dances and still have more to learn."
The dance ensemble's April 15 show will
recreate the program performed at the
Smithsonian Museum in Washington, D.C.
But instead of keeping it elite and in cos
tume, the whole ensemble will perform the
dances. "Richard could have kept it small,"
Sheehan says, "but instead he said, no, let's
let everyone perform."
In addition to the group dances, Amani
tas and Ken Delmar, a ballet instructor at
Stanford, will perform the 1856 tango. It
will be contrasted by Delmar's performance
of the Argentine tango with Buenos Aires
born Mariela Franganillo. "There are a lot of
contrasts [in this program], especially be
tween old and new," Powers says.
Though she is teased often for her ability
to learn new steps quickly, Amarillas claims
it was difficult for her to switch from ballet
to the tango. In fact, it took her a long time
to learn to follow a lead. "It was hard to let
go of my [ballet] training and perceptions."
Practicing projection
"It's not pretentious," Mendoza says of
the ensemble's dance style. "It's not like
competition ballroom with snapping heads
like in 'Strictly Ballroom.' We try to recreate
a period with mirth and merriment." This
attitude was reflected in his Viennese Ball
choreography which brought in some
"humor and playfulness" through its paro
dy of Disney movies and role-reversal danc
ing, where the woman takes the lead.
At tonight's rehearsal, only 10 days re
main until the show. Still, everyone is smil
ing, and Powers himself is very calm. He is
not looking for precise synchronicity. "I

don't have anything against perfection, but
once it becomes too much an exercise in
technique and too uniform and too ho
mogenized and too much of the Rockettes,
then it ceases to be an authentic recreation
of how our great-great-grandparents
danced."
The group practices a freestyle waltz,
moving erratically around the dance studio.
Some tudents spin in circles, flying around
the room, while others practice the basic
step. The quadrille requires four couples to
make a square, and the reel is a line dance
done in almost square dance style. Perhaps
the most popular dance, if the most ex
hausting, is the mazurka, and more than
one couple falls to the floor during an intri
cate move in which two couples pass
through each other.
Powers gives supporting, if honest criti
cisms. "It looks a little ragged," he admits after
one dance. "But some couples were just scin
tillating." During the dance, he shouts en
couragement. "Steamy, powerful, project it!"
The style carries over. "The most impor
tant thing to remember is the time period,"
says Sheehan. "Look how the hands are
going, look how the eyes are going, it's all
part of a performance style. When you fin
ish it, you don't just drop off, you stay in
character."
Clearly, the ensemble strives for strong
performances but has maintained a clear
sense of purpose: to have fun and provide a
creative outlet for its participants.
Powers smiles watching the group's
members dance the night away. "You can see
who's a hot shot and who isn't but they all
have the spirit. It's not about perfection.' ■

The Vintage Dance Ensemble will recreate its
Smithsonian performance titled "The Great
Victorian Dance Mama" Friday, April 15 at 8
p.m. The show, to he held at Roble dance stu
dio, is free with an optional contribution. For
more information call 723-1234.



f / man steps up to a woman and
x / r asks her to dance. She accepts
/ and, to the straining sounds of
a waltz, they begin to polka, tentatively at
first, then, gaining confidence, swirling
around the dance floor in a blur.
Although it could be a scene from a
mid-19th century Jane Austen novel, this
old-fashioned courtship ritual is being
played out in the Roble dance studio at
Stanford.
The Stanford Vintage Dance Ensemble is
a perfect place for students who enjoy social
dances — such as the waltz, polka, quadrille
and reel — to strut their stuff. A two-unit
class, the dance ensemble is led by Dance
Division Prof. Richard Powers and attracts a
very diverse membership including gradu
ate students, undergraduates and members
of the Stanford community.
The dances range in style from waltzes of
the 1840s to ragtime-era swings. Most are
done in couples (the man leads of course),
while some are performed in lines, and still
others in diamond formations.
When it comes to social dance, enthusi
asm and experience count for more than
just raw talent. "People have been with the
group for two years, and they really have im
bued the whole style of moving. It's more
the experience — how long you've been
with the group — almost more than your
natural ability," Powers says.
And it's exactly this enthusiasm that
keeps Powers going. "The students are also
the strongest reason for staying out here [in
California). It is very satisfying to have that
degree of dedication and talent. The dancers
back then did have some training and some
technique, but these are social dances.
That's why it's very important that we keep
the spirit of what we're doing and not turn it
into another ballet or another musical the
ater."
A 'powerful' method
Fran Sheehan, a graduate student in me

chanical engineering, was involved with a
folk dance group before Powers came to
Stanford. When the old instructor left, she
and three other couples joined the Vintage
Dance Ensemble to keep the group going.
Her commitment to the dance ensemble
led her and the Ensemble to Japan this fall
and Washington, D.C. last month to per
form the dances. "Stanford wanted, be
cause Richard is so well known, to get a
name for Stanford and do these big perfor
mances."
Powers was much in demand, having cre
ated the most coveted vintage dance ensem
ble in America in Cincinnati, called the Fly
ing Cloud Academy. He has performed all
over the world, including Hollywood, with
roles in the movies "dory" and "North and
South." He was persuaded to come to Stan
ford two years ago. "The chair of the Dance
Division was trying to get me out here for a
number of years. It just happened that a year
and a half ago, things were fairly stable [and
1 could come]."
"There's this one part in 'North and
South' where you get a good look at him, his
face is right in the camera" laughs James
Mendoza, a first-year graduate student and
an Ensemble member.
In fact, it was during his graduate student
days in engineering at Stanford that Powers
discovered dance. It was only a hobby for a
long time, allowing Powers to pursue a ca
reer in product design. Interestingly
enough, he holds seven patents, the most
well-know of which is the tamper-proof cap.
Yet he found his niche researching 19th
century and ragtime dance, and has made it
his vocation ever since.
All rave about Powers' teaching style.
"Richard is an excellent teacher," says Barry
Lewis, a middle-aged electrical engineer
with Hewlett-Packard. "And I've seen a lot
of teachers."
Angela Amarillas, a freshman, agrees.
"Richard is wonderful. He has a charisma
that's hard to pinpoint. More than easy

going, he has an infectious style. It's great to
work with him — it's an honor to work with
him."
Amarillas should know, having been pro
moted to featured soloist in less than a quar
ter. "It's been so flattering. I've never been
spotlighted, I've always been chorus. In the
'Nutcracker,' I was always snow or a flower
or something," she laughs.
She joined the group winter quarter, after
hearing about it through her social dance
class. "I joined because I heard they were
performing at Spring Migration." Though
she has been involved in dance "since I was
about three," Amarillas had never explored
social dance, concentrating instead on clas
sical training: ballet, Spanish dance and
modern dance.
'Intergrating everyone'
She, too, has benefited from the travel ex
periences, traveling to Washington with fea
tured members of the dance ensemble last
month. "I was so flattered to be asked to go.
It was such an elite group," Amarillas says.
The preparation for the trip was intense
— Amarillas practiced more than seven
hours a week in addition to her other three
dance classes and pre-med courseload.
However, she says it was well worth it."It re
ally helped me understand how much dance
means to me."

When the Smithsonian Museum in
Washington, D.C. contacted Powers to give
a lecture on social dance history, he thought
it would be best illustrated not only by
slides, but through real demonstration. He
used his honorarium to purchase plane tick
ets for four couples in the group. The Stan
ford Dance Division and personal pocket
money of the group made up the rest. "To
take his salary and flip it into plane tickets
because that's what the dance was about (re
quires a lot of dedication]," Sheehan says.
"His love for the dance is really neat."
The couples made their authentic cos
tumes by hand, which included crinolines
and hoops, complete with curtain-like trim.
" They're so much fun to perform in," says
Sheehan.
Sheehan compares this experience with
her trip to Japan this fall. Paid for by a

main until the show. Still, everyone is smil
ing, and Powers himself is very calm. He is
not looking for precise synchronicity. "I

don't have anything against perfection, but
once it becomes too much an exercise in
technique and too uniform and too ho
mogenized and too much of the Rockettes,
then it ceases to be an authentic recreation
of how our great-great-grandparents
danced."
The group practices a freestyle waltz,
moving erratically around the dance studio.
Some tudents spin in circles, flying around
the room, while others practice the basic
step. The quadrille requires four couples to
make a square, and the reel is a line dance
done in almost square dance style. Perhaps
the most popular dance, if the most ex
hausting, is the mazurka, and more than
one couple falls to the floor during an intri
cate move in which two couples pass
through each other.
Powers gives supporting, if honest criti
cisms. "It looks a little ragged," he admits after
one dance. "But some couples were just scin
tillating." During the dance, he shouts en
couragement. "Steamy, powerful, project it!"
The style carries over. "The most impor
tant thing to remember is the time period,"
says Sheehan. "Look how the hands are
going, look how the eyes are going, it's all
part of a performance style. When you fin
ish it, you don't just drop off, you stay in
character."
Clearly, the ensemble strives for strong
performances but has maintained a clear
sense of purpose: to have fun and provide a
creative outlet for its participants.
Powers smiles watching the group's
members dance the night away. "You can see
who's a hot shot and who isn't but they all
have the spirit. It's not about perfection.' ■

The Vintage Dance Ensemble will recreate its
Smithsonian performance titled "The Great
Victorian Dance Mama" Friday, April 15 at 8
p.m. The show, to he held at Roble dance stu
dio, is free with an optional contribution. For

f / man steps up to a woman and
x / r asks her to dance. She accepts
/ and, to the straining sounds of
a waltz, they begin to polka, tentatively at
first, then, gaining confidence, swirling
around the dance floor in a blur.
Although it could be a scene from a
mid-19th century Jane Austen novel, this
old-fashioned courtship ritual is being
played out in the Roble dance studio at
Stanford.
The Stanford Vintage Dance Ensemble is
a perfect place for students who enjoy social
dances — such as the waltz, polka, quadrille
and reel — to strut their stuff. A two-unit
class, the dance ensemble is led by Dance
Division Prof. Richard Powers and attracts a
very diverse membership including gradu
ate students, undergraduates and members
of the Stanford community.
The dances range in style from waltzes of
the 1840s to ragtime-era swings. Most are
done in couples (the man leads of course),
while some are performed in lines, and still
others in diamond formations.
When it comes to social dance, enthusi
asm and experience count for more than
just raw talent. "People have been with the
group for two years, and they really have im
bued the whole style of moving. It's more
the experience — how long you've been
with the group — almost more than your
natural ability," Powers says.
And it's exactly this enthusiasm that
keeps Powers going. "The students are also
the strongest reason for staying out here [in
California). It is very satisfying to have that
degree of dedication and talent. The dancers
back then did have some training and some
technique, but these are social dances.
That's why it's very important that we keep
the spirit of what we're doing and not turn it
into another ballet or another musical the
ater."
A 'powerful' method
Fran Sheehan, a graduate student in me

chanical engineering, was involved with a
folk dance group before Powers came to
Stanford. When the old instructor left, she
and three other couples joined the Vintage
Dance Ensemble to keep the group going.
Her commitment to the dance ensemble
led her and the Ensemble to Japan this fall
and Washington, D.C. last month to per
form the dances. "Stanford wanted, be
cause Richard is so well known, to get a
name for Stanford and do these big perfor
mances."
Powers was much in demand, having cre
ated the most coveted vintage dance ensem
ble in America in Cincinnati, called the Fly
ing Cloud Academy. He has performed all
over the world, including Hollywood, with
roles in the movies "dory" and "North and
South." He was persuaded to come to Stan
ford two years ago. "The chair of the Dance
Division was trying to get me out here for a
number of years. It just happened that a year
and a half ago, things were fairly stable [and
1 could come]."
"There's this one part in 'North and
South' where you get a good look at him, his
face is right in the camera" laughs James
Mendoza, a first-year graduate student and
an Ensemble member.
In fact, it was during his graduate student
days in engineering at Stanford that Powers
discovered dance. It was only a hobby for a
long time, allowing Powers to pursue a ca
reer in product design. Interestingly
enough, he holds seven patents, the most
well-know of which is the tamper-proof cap.
Yet he found his niche researching 19th
century and ragtime dance, and has made it
his vocation ever since.
All rave about Powers' teaching style.
"Richard is an excellent teacher," says Barry
Lewis, a middle-aged electrical engineer
with Hewlett-Packard. "And I've seen a lot
of teachers."
Angela Amarillas, a freshman, agrees.
"Richard is wonderful. He has a charisma
that's hard to pinpoint. More than easy

going, he has an infectious style. It's great to
work with him — it's an honor to work with
him."
Amarillas should know, having been pro
moted to featured soloist in less than a quar
ter. "It's been so flattering. I've never been
spotlighted, I've always been chorus. In the
'Nutcracker,' I was always snow or a flower
or something," she laughs.
She joined the group winter quarter, after
hearing about it through her social dance
class. "I joined because I heard they were
performing at Spring Migration." Though
she has been involved in dance "since I was
about three," Amarillas had never explored
social dance, concentrating instead on clas
sical training: ballet, Spanish dance and
modern dance.
'Intergrating everyone'
She, too, has benefited from the travel ex
periences, traveling to Washington with fea
tured members of the dance ensemble last
month. "I was so flattered to be asked to go.
It was such an elite group," Amarillas says.
The preparation for the trip was intense
— Amarillas practiced more than seven
hours a week in addition to her other three
dance classes and pre-med courseload.
However, she says it was well worth it."It re
ally helped me understand how much dance
means to me."

When the Smithsonian Museum in
Washington, D.C. contacted Powers to give
a lecture on social dance history, he thought
it would be best illustrated not only by
slides, but through real demonstration. He
used his honorarium to purchase plane tick
ets for four couples in the group. The Stan
ford Dance Division and personal pocket
money of the group made up the rest. "To
take his salary and flip it into plane tickets
because that's what the dance was about (re
quires a lot of dedication]," Sheehan says.
"His love for the dance is really neat."
The couples made their authentic cos
tumes by hand, which included crinolines
and hoops, complete with curtain-like trim.
" They're so much fun to perform in," says
Sheehan.
Sheehan compares this experience with
her trip to Japan this fall. Paid for by a
Japanese organization interested in Ameri
can traditional dance, eight couples trav
eled, all expenses paid, to complement Pow
ers' instruction.
It turned out to be larger than anyone ex
pected. Powers gave microphoned instruc
tion to 1,200 people over the covered
Olympic pool in Tokyo. "It was impressive
that they built a wooden dance floor half the
size of a football field [over the pool) just for
this," Powers admits. Plus, all 600 women
were dressed in traditional American ball

room gowns, made expressly for this one
night.
"We don't want an elite group doing all
the performances outside Stanford," Shee
han points out, "but sometimes it's hard to
bring everyone else up to speed. Slowly but
surely we've been integrating everyone."
An outlet for expression
So what makes this class and this form of
dance so popular? "It's such a wonderful
form of expression," Amarillas says. Plus,
"it's social, it's a good way to meet people
and it's enjoyable. You're out there having a
good time and dancing."
Mendoza claims that his interest lies in
vintage dance's "intellectual component.
I'm excited about dance and the history be
hind it." But Mendoza says the real reason he
continues with the group is his teacher.
"[Richard has] changed my life. He's a great
teacher, you want to be around him. He's a
Renaissance man."
Mendoza got into dance late in his Stan
ford career. I le felt that "here I am at Stanford.
I should try something totally different [from
microbiology]." Of course, it didn't hurt that
a cute girl he knew was participating. "That
was my social motivation," he admits.
"I fell in love with the waltz," Mendoza
continues. He continued his training and
choreographed the opening dance at the Vi

ennese Ball this year. He is also working
dance into his curriculum as a school
teacher. "I've named all my kids' groups
after dances. One is the mazurka, another is
the polka, etc. 1 would love to create an in
terdisciplinary class involving dance, Amer
ican history and costumes."
Tango through the tulips
Powers agrees that the historical compo
nent is most interesting. The dance craze of
1844 was started by the immigration of the
Kuropean polka. "The waltz was earlier, but
it didn't catch on; it was forbidden. It was
not acceptable to hold someone in an inti
mate embrace in public."
Hut the polka waltz changed this attitude.
It was so good-humored and sunny that it
couldn't be seen as licentious, Powers ex
plains. And many other dances were off
shoots of this one. The Cancan, for example,
far from modern conceptions of women
dancing in a line, was started by French stu
dents as an "anarchistic mockery of the
dances they were taught in school."
Another of these is a tango. Different
from the modern tango and the Argentine
tango, this dance was described in 1856.
Powers reconstructed it entirely from its
written form.
Powers claims these dances have the same
pull in 1994 as they did 150 years ago.

"There is a tremendous variety," he says.
" 19th century and ragtime have spirited fast
dances, have slow sensual dances, have very
easy improvisational dances, have techni
cally challenging dances, and there's also the
contrast between 19th century and ragtime.
One could spend a lifetime studying these
dances and still have more to learn."
The dance ensemble's April 15 show will
recreate the program performed at the
Smithsonian Museum in Washington, D.C.
But instead of keeping it elite and in cos
tume, the whole ensemble will perform the
dances. "Richard could have kept it small,"
Sheehan says, "but instead he said, no, let's
let everyone perform."
In addition to the group dances, Amani
tas and Ken Delmar, a ballet instructor at
Stanford, will perform the 1856 tango. It
will be contrasted by Delmar's performance
of the Argentine tango with Buenos Aires
born Mariela Franganillo. "There are a lot of
contrasts [in this program], especially be
tween old and new," Powers says.
Though she is teased often for her ability
to learn new steps quickly, Amarillas claims
it was difficult for her to switch from ballet
to the tango. In fact, it took her a long time
to learn to follow a lead. "It was hard to let
go of my [ballet] training and perceptions."
Practicing projection
"It's not pretentious," Mendoza says of
the ensemble's dance style. "It's not like
competition ballroom with snapping heads
like in 'Strictly Ballroom.' We try to recreate
a period with mirth and merriment." This
attitude was reflected in his Viennese Ball
choreography which brought in some
"humor and playfulness" through its paro
dy of Disney movies and role-reversal danc
ing, where the woman takes the lead.
At tonight's rehearsal, only 10 days re
main until the show. Still, everyone is smil
ing, and Powers himself is very calm. He is
not looking for precise synchronicity. "I

don't have anything against perfection, but
once it becomes too much an exercise in
technique and too uniform and too ho
mogenized and too much of the Rockettes,
then it ceases to be an authentic recreation
of how our great-great-grandparents
danced."
The group practices a freestyle waltz,
moving erratically around the dance studio.
Some tudents spin in circles, flying around
the room, while others practice the basic
step. The quadrille requires four couples to
make a square, and the reel is a line dance
done in almost square dance style. Perhaps
the most popular dance, if the most ex
hausting, is the mazurka, and more than
one couple falls to the floor during an intri
cate move in which two couples pass

Powers gives supporting, if honest criti
cisms. "It looks a little ragged," he admits after

tillating." During the dance, he shouts en
couragement. "Steamy, powerful, project it!"
The style carries over. "The most impor

performances but has maintained a clear
