## Black House groups plan relocation to Old Union 
### Laura Shin 
Seeking more space, organizations in the
Black House are hoping to relocate to the third
floor of the Old Union Clubhouse — but several
obstacles lie in the way.
The need to renovate the Clubhouse and find
a place for the offices of the Stanford Associated
Ministries — which currently occupy the third
floor — may delay the move, administrators say.
The Black Community Services Center and
the Black Student Union now share the Black
House, located near the Bowman Alumni

House. "The BCSC is the smallest facilities-wise
of the centers and we've been in need of addi
tional space for many years now," said Asst.
Dean of Students Barbara Smith, the center's
director.
The new location would provide more space
for a lounge area, she said. The current confer
ence room seats about 12, Smith added, while
other ethnic centers have lounges where people
can relax or hold large meetings.
"We can finally have a center where students
feel welcome, where the students
can just go and chill," said BSU
treasurer Johnathon Briggs, a
sophomore. "It's not that they
don't try to make you feel wel
come, it's that there's no room.
[The Black House] is more of a
place of business now."
Smith said the move is "quasi
finalized," explaining that although
no action has been taken adminis
trators have made up their minds.
But Vice Provost for Student
Affairs Mary Edmonds and other
administrators were more cau
tious. Before the move could take
place administrators would have
to "identify funding sources" for
improvements and find a place for
the Associated Ministries,
Edmonds said.
"We have nowhere to go, so we
won't move out," said Associated

Ministries secretary coordinator
Elsi Stucki. The group's offices
house campus religious leaders.
The relocation has been dis
cussed by Edmonds, Provost Con
doleezza Rice, Dean of Students
Michael Jackson, the BCSC Policy
Board, faculty, staff, students and
alumni.
Despite her concerns, Edmonds
agreed that the center needs
improved facilities. "Evidently
there has long been a recognition
that when you considered the
space and the amenities, the Black
Community Services Center did
not have the same comforts as the
other centers," she said.
Smith said she expects the Uni
versity to form a committee "to
review the structural soundness"
of the Clubhouse, which closed for
several weeks after the Ix>ma Pri
eta earthquake in 1989.
She said she wants the commit
tee to determine the building's
problems and what specific reno
vations it needs to comply with the

Americans with Disabilities Act so
that a date can be set for the move.
Briggs said his only complaint
is that the hoped-for location is not
in good condition. "It's kind of an
insult to move us into Ithe Club
house] instead of expanding [the
Black House)."
A larger area would also allow
groups to maintain archival files,
Smith said. The lack of space in
the Black House prevents some
organizations from centralizing
archives, she said, and as a result
information is scattered or lost.
A new site would also accommo
date other groups under the
umbrella of the Black House, Smith
said, such as the Black Graduate
Student Association and black fra
ternities and sororities. At present
only the BSU and the BCSC have
physical work space in the Black
House and the other organizations
come in to use the equipment.
A disadvantage of the move
would be the increased distance
between groups currently head

quartered in the Black House and
Ujamaa and the Committee on
Black Performing Arts in Harmo
ny House, Smith said.
But Smith pointed out that if
the BCSC moves to the Club
house, it can share equipment
such as copiers and fax machines
with the Asian American Activities
Center and the American Indian
Program Office, permitting mod
est budget savings.
Some, however, have raised
concerns about placing three eth
nic community centers together,
in effect creating a "multicultural
center" building.
"I don't see this as a step
toward a single multicultural cen
ter," said Asst. Dean of Students
James Larimore, director of the
American Indian Program Office,
"although we should be concerned
that some people may take the per
ception that these centers belong
in one place or that Stanford
should concentrate minorities in
one building."
