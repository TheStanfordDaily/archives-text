# It's no 'Barton Fink'
## 'The Hudsucker Proxy' plummets fast and hard 
### 
Joel and Ethan Coen's new film "The Hud
sucker Proxy" needs a warning label — not for
viewers with vertigo.
As the movie demonstrates, the Coens
know all about falling. Whether it be a physical
free-fall from a 46-story New York skyscraper,
or a mental plummeting from the heights of
idealism to the depths of luxurious hedonism,
these talented brothers create one heck of a
morality play based upon this simple action.
But it just doesn't make for a good movie.
The Coen brothers are known for their for
ays into the cinematic world of the weird and
abstract. From "Blood Simple" to "Barton
Fink," the two have teamed to write, direct and
produce films whose screen life is brief, but
which are revitalized in the VCR. The duo's
creations have become cult hits of sorts — the
most successful being "Raising Arizona" —
and rely on similar themes, characterizations
and camera shots.
"The Hudsucker Proxy" is no exception. It
owes quite a debt to "Barton Fink" in particu
lar, as its thematic and structural similarities
are obvious. But unlike in "Barton Fink" —
which was a critical success if not a box office
hit — "The Hudsucker Proxy" employs an ele
mentary-school humor which borders on
corny. These additions, along with an amaz
ingly distant cast of characters, makes the pair's
newest film their worst.
The movie chronicles the rapid ascent of
Norville Barnes (Tim Robbins) in the super
company Hudsucker Industries. Barnes, a
graduate of the Muncie College of Business
Administration, Class of '58, is a stereotypic
small town, happy-go-lucky idealist who gets a
job in a hellish mail room. Alter Waring Hud

sucker (Charles Durning) takes a plunge from
the 45th floor, Barnes is quickly promoted by
the malicious Sidney J. Mussburger (Paul
Newman) in the hopes that Barnes will run the
company so ineptly that the stock will plunge
and Mussburger and his pals can snatch it up
cheap.
But Barnes has a plan. A toy, in fact, whose
construction Barnes has been planing for ages.
I lis "hula-hoop" becomes amazingly success
ful and Barnes becomes the toast of the corpo
rate world. Not surprisingly, his newfound
success radically changes the simple country
boy into a self-important fool.
Dismayed by this reversal of fortune, Muss
burger changes tactics and unceremoniously
has Barnes fired because of his relationship
with Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Amy
Archer (Jennifer Jason Ixngh) and his mental
instability.
The powers of good and evil clash in the
movie's anti-climatic finale as Barnes plum
mets 45 floors to the pavement below. As in
most fairy tales, good surmounts the insur
mountable odds and everyone lives happily, if
incredibly, ever after.
Robbins and Newman— two unquestion
able talents the Coens abuse by allowing the
pair to play stereotypes. Neither gets much
deeper than the adjectives "simple" and "naive"
or "malicious" and "greed/' in playing their
characters, with the result being paper-thin
leading roles that are amazingly untouchable.
Perhaps this character distance is supposed
to be mediated by the film's attempts at slap
stick humor. But the gags, while funny, are sim
ilarly cold. The movie is not warmly amusing.
Rather it is satirically and dispassionately com

ical, which creates chuckles, but further re
moves the audience from the subject matter.
Thus, the newest Coen venture is a frigid
and simplistic morality tale. The camera work
is interesting, but it can't carry the show. The
brothers have definitely taken quite the leap

downward from the artistic heights of "Raising
Arizona" and "Miller's Crossing."
Let's hope that their next venture doesn't
pull a Waring Hudsucker and "gelly up the
sidewalk."
