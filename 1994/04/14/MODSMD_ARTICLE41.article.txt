The House of the Spirits

The spirits aren't the only ones who get
restless in this plodding family chronicle,
based on the acclaimed novel by Chilean
writer Isabel Allende. Relying on its presti
gious cast and credentials, "The House of the
Spirits" forgets to be entertaining.
Danish writer/director Bille August brings
a delicate Euro-sensibility to the film, but Al
lende's story — spanning four generations
and several political upheavals — ultimately
proves too unwieldy for his limited scale.
Granted, the somewhat sudsy plot has
been streamlined for the screen, with charac
ters and events combined or, more often, cut.
Although the result is a bit choppy, there is
plenty of intrigue to spare.
More crucially, the magic realism and lush
sense of South

American atmos
phere that charac
terized the novel is
gone. We're left in a
vaguely historical,
vaguely Latin fanta
syland at the mercy
of halfhearted su
pernatural effects
and August's own
excruciating script.
The film follows
the fortunes of the
Trueba family —

the cruel, ambitious patriarch (Jeremy
Irons), his clairvoyant wife (Meryl Streep),
spinster sister (Glenn Close) and rebellious
daughter (Winona Ryder), all of whom age
significantly over the course of the two-plus
hour show.
August improbably casts Ryder as a tor
tured political prisoner and saddles Streep
with a girlish blond wig identical to the one
Ryder wore in "Edward Scissorhands." Irons
barely masks his English accent behind an
unintelligible bellow.
More successful are Close as Irons' embit
tered sister and Antonio Banderas as a hunky
young revolutionary. Dressed and coifed in
black, Close turns a relatively minor charac
ter into a virtuoso role.
"You don't know the thoughts that can
run through the mind of a lonely woman,"
she tells her confessor. But all it takes is one
chilling close-up for Close to tell us exactly
what she's thinking.
Though fantastical, Allende's book is be
lievable not only because of her masterful
storytelling — it's also based on the true
story of her upbringing. But the film version
is entirely devoid of credibility. It's as if these
celebrated thespians decided on a whim to
act out a favorite novel. The results are often
impressive, but unfailingly hollow.
Anyone with a taste for "Melrose Place"
melodrama will feel at home in "The House of
the Spirits." But the only things haunting this
"House" are misbegotten good intentions.

Bitter Moon

Nothing lasts. And Roman Polanski isn't
afraid to admit it.
Set aboard a cruise en route to the Orient,
"Bitter Moon" opens when a second-rate
writer named Oscar (played excellently by the
gravel-voiced and haggard Peter Coyote) cor
ners Nigel, a stereotypically repressed English
man (Hugh Grant, quelle surprise) and tells
his story of the strange relationship with his
young and spandexed French wife, Mimi (Em
manuelle Seigner, the curvaceous nymph
whose affair with Polanski during her early
teen years caused an uproar over a decade ago).
Nigel and his equally repressed wife Fiona
(Kristin Scott-Thomas, in Talbots-starched
chic) are heading to India, hoping that a va
cation could replenish the meaning in their
relationship that four years of childless mar
riage has drained away.
Oscar, with the use of flashbacks (a trite
technique that dovetails nicely with his trite
prose ... assuming that it is intentional), re
counts the initial period of passion between
him and Mimi. But eventually, their desire
wanes. As Oscar puts it: "Our credit was run
ning out, we were heading for sexual bank
ruptcy." To regenerate their relationship,
Oscar and Mimi increase the intensity of their
sexual stimulation. Their natural lovemaking
transforms into contrived performances in
volving razors, urine, farm animals...
The attempts of Oscar and Mimi to com

bat sexual boredom are so absurd that it in
vites laughter from the audience. But the
chuckle elicited is an uneasy one. Why? We
are laughing at something that is too familiar.
Polanski is making us acknowledge the
unnerving truth couples try desperately to
airbrush away with sex toys or See's truffles
on Valentine's Day: attraction has an expira
tion date.
For Oscar and Mimi, not only does their
passion end, but they also wind up hating each
other. Oscar mentally abuses Mimi and she
later commits a most disturbing act of revenge.
As the director of this erotic morality play,
Folanski compels his cast to perform without
a net. The result is a dangerous and powerful
film that exposes the painful finitude of pas
sion and the darker side of human nature.
If you don't wish to end your rose-tinted
reverie of Disney romances and Whitney
Houston hits, I advise you to avoid this flick.
If your preferences lie elsewhere, enjoy.
