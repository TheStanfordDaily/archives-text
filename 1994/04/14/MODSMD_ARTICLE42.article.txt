# Giving Phish a lift
## Catching the MTV generation hook, line and sinker 
### 
The world is on the verge of radical
change: Phish just released a new album.
F.verybody's heard of them, but very few peo
ple have ever actually heard them. Their
music has been compared to hundreds of
artists, which shows the diversity of their
sounds. They're sort of jazzy, sort of funky,
sort of bluesy, sort of outerspacey —a little of
everything.
But maybe it's this diversity that has kept
them out of the mainstream for so long. Sure
it's nice that a select, privileged group of peo
ple has been hoarding the pleasure, getting to
see them play at nice small clubs and theaters,
trading bootlegs of their favorite shows and
doing the whole underground band bit. The
only problem is that a band of such phenom
enal virtuosity and with such a rich reper
toire can't keep itself secret forever.
Eleven years and five albums into their ca
reer, Phish is about to get the big payback.
Their livelihood, until very recently, has de
pended on their constant touring: when they
take time off to record an album, they take
time away from earning a living. However,
with their third major label release, "Hoist,"
things were not so rushed in the studio; nor
were they working on creating a 70-minute
epic like all of their last four albums, so they
had time to work on producing the music
and taking advantage of the studio setting.
Most bands that achieve fame in the '90s
have generally put months of time and effort
and money into making their hit albums: the
songs are often so "studioized" that they are
nearly impossible to reproduce live. Songs
from U2's"Achtung Baby," for example, must
have been quite a challenge on their promo
tional tour. While numerous dedicated Phish
fans are complaining about the amount of
production that went into the album — pro
duction which they say takes away from the
ingenuity of the album — the actual problem

of being unable to reproduce songs is ex
tremely minor and any production only adds
to the artistry of the album.
The album also features incredible guest
musicians like '90s banjo icon Bdla Fleck and
the super-tight lower of Power horn section.
However, musicianship and production
alone do not a platinum album make. It is the
quality of the songs themselves that makes
this album a pleasure to listen to. While many
Phans lament the lack of a "You Enjoy My
self" (from the album "Junta"), the songs
aren't too far a cry from the older music;
rather they are simply a different tack on the
old ideals of the music. These songs are all
more integrated songs, more structured, less
free form than on past albums, or than some
of their unreleased material.
But the thought to keep in mind is that
these songs are all set up for fantastic live
jams: every single one of them (excepting
maybe "Riker's Mailbox," which is only a few
seconds long) has the potential to jam as hard
as "Llama" (off "Picture of Nectar"), be as
cool as the unreleased "Possum" or sound as
strange as "Reba" (off "Lawn Boy").
Among the album's many highlights are
the classic "Sample in a Jar," the single
"Down with the Disease," and the John
Schofield-esque "Demand." In the age-old
tradition of the Beatles and Nirvana, Phish
included an unnamed, unmentioned pair of
tunes at the end of the album. The first, a
bootleg of an incredibly groovy "Split Open
and Melt" (off their second album,
Boy") is supplemented by the sounds of an
car chase ending in a huge crash, and the sec
ond is an a capella Hebrew prayer, Alvinu
Malkaenu (although it's hard to tell for sure).
This follows with the themes of death and
dying that permeate the album (themes
which Fin still, after tens of listenings, trying
to unravel).

Accompanying the first single released off
the album, "Down with the Disease," is
Phish's first MTV-ready music video. It's
been shown time and time again that a suc
cessful video can lead to monster album
sales, a reward Phish definitely deserves.

While the 11-year Phans may be sad to see
Phish moving up to bigger and more expen
sive arenas, who can truly complain if such a
deserving and influential band as Phish is put
in the spotlight?
