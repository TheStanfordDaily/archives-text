"Freedom"
Yothu Yindi

Mixing a modern rock-group lineup with
traditional dancers, singers, and instruments
from Australia's Aborigine culture, Yothu
Yindi's music runs the gamut from ancient
tribal chants to synth-flavored rock anthems.
On "Freedom," its latest offering, the band at
tempts to confront some of society's most
pressing problems while it tries to keep its
music grounded in Aboriginal tribal heritage.
According to the album's liner notes, Yothu

Yindi seeks "to share
knowledge and expe
rience and create a
world in which we
can all live in harmo
ny" while celebrating
"their deep spiritual
connections with the
land."
While some songs
successfully deal with
issues like the plight

of the world's indigenous peoples or the state
of the global environment with great success,
many of Yothu Yindi's efforts in this direction
are ultimately unsatisfying. Singer/songwriter
Mandawuy Yunupingu's lyrics can be inspir
ing, but are often undermined by the presence
of unpoetic phrases like "human rights for in
digenous peoples."
The best moments of "Freedom" actually
come when the group drops its own music
and performs traditional tribal chants from
the Aborigine clans its members come from.
Sung in the Yolgnu language, with only click
ing sticks and the rhythmic hum of a tradi
tional didjeridoo, these tribal numbers res
onate with the experience of the 40,000-year
old culture they derive from.
The album's best track, "Gapu," in which a
tribal song is remixed with a modern beat,
provides a glimpse of how Yothu Yindi could
better bring its traditions to a modern audi
ence. As the singer's reedy, timeless voice
sings about ocean tides in his ancient lan
guage, a bassline that could be borrowed
from Dr. Dre slinks through the background,
creating a mysterious, hypnotic effect.

"Superunknown"
Soundgarden

Ironically, Soundgarden's members
named their album "Superunknown" par
tially in response to the lack of fame they've
received in comparison to their Seattle coun
terparts. Public acclaim had eluded them —
until a few of weeks ago, when they joined
Pearl Jam, Nirvana and Alice in Chains in
having their newest album debut at number
one on the Billboard charts.
The band's members had been gaining ac
ceptance underground and in the music in
dustry for their previous work "Badmotorfin
ger" and for their participation in the "Sin
gles" soundtrack and "Temple of the Dog" al
bums. However, it was through constant tour
ing with Guns N' Roses, Lollapaloo7,a and,
most recendy, Neil Young that they quietly be
came well-known to the masses.
Their latest work, which was eagerly
awaited, did not disappoint — "Superunk
nown" is one of the best albums of the year.
From the opening riff "Let Me Drown" to

the fading feedback of "Like Suicide," the
record supplies all of the dark, brooding rock
that anyone could ever want in a seventy
minute package. The guitars, most of it done
by "riffmeister" Kim Thayil, give the album
the groundwork to bore into the listener's
brain. It perfectly suits the moods evoked by
Chris Cornell's lyrics.
His vocals on "Superunknown," along with
previous songs and albums Cornell has
worked on, continues to portray the death
motif. Unlike "Temple of the Dog," however,
the theme does not translate directly about the
passing away of a person; death is used to il
lustrate loss of innocence, realization of mor
tality and general despair about the world.
Unlike many songs he had written before,
Cornell's work on this album achieves a ma
turity that was not evident previously. In ad
dition, he delivers the vocals with the same
intensity and feeling as evidenced in the song
"Seasons" on the "Singles" soundtrack, thus
allowing the lyrics to complement the music.
With this album, Soundgarden proved
that it has escaped the shackles of Seattle to
become one of the biggest bands today.
