# In the shadow of a favorite
## It's not Florentine's, but Capriccio is next door 
### Vincent Ho 
If you're looking for a place that's
slightly off the beaten trail but still
within sight of it, a place that has de
cent Italian food and a quiet, mid
dle-of-the-road atmosphere, here's a
good candidate.
Capriccio is a relatively small Ital
ian restaurant along the same lines as
Florentine's in Palo Alto — in fact, a
Florentine's take out and pasta shop
is right next door. Flowever, that's as
close as Capriccio comes to the bet
ter-known Florentine's chain. Locat
ed across from the San Antonio
shopping center, Capriccio is sec
onds away from lower Records, the
classic Stanford landmark.
Upon entering through the back,
my dining companion and I were im
mediately greeted by the maitre d', and
seated quickly by the owner, Franco
Siccardi, an amiable and attentive

man with a slight Italian accent.
The restaurant itself has a fairly
nondescript decor— it is difficult to
detect a dominant theme. The tan
walls reminded me of the too many
pairs of khaki colored slacks that all
men seem to own — not terribly ex
citing, but not out of style, either.
Lirge white seagulls dangle from the
ceiling as well, and they appear to
drift with the air currents when the
air conditioning is turned on.
The clientele at the restaurant is a
crowd of folks in their early- and
mid-30s who aren't into brewpubs
or cafes, but want to go out and have
a decent dinner without ttx) much
flash and dash.
Capriccio's menu is expansive, re
plete with classic Italian dishes such
as lasagna, chicken parmigiana, piz
zas and pastas galore. Most fall with

in the $9-$ 13 range. Being in the
seafood kind of mood, I tried the lin
guine and clams, and my dining
companion chose the sole Floren
tine. Not all meals come with the
standard soup or salad, as we discov
ered at bill time: the soup my date or
dered was extra.
Other noteworthy dishes include
seafood linguine — scallops,
shrimp, clams, mussels, calamari
and fresh fish in a spicy tomato sauce
— tortellini alfredo, and chicken ar
tichoke, consisting of boneless
chicken saut£ed with artichoke
hearts.
Overall, the service was excellent.
My dining companion and 1 were
pressed for time, and our waitress
was more than happy to accommo
date us without rushing us out the
door. The portions were larger than

average and pleasantly
presented. On the
down side, the clam
sauce was a smidgen
too creamy and the
sole was not as tender
as to be hoped by na
tive New Englanders.
