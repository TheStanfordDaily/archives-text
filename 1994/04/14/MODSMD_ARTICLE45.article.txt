Angie
Sure, this movie screams "chic
flick!" Yet Geena Davis' portrayal of
a prototypical New York Italian gum
chomper makes the movie better
than commonplace. While some
scenes seem a little trite because of
stereotypical characters, other off
beat ones work. Of note are the
scenes in which Angie has to deal
with labor pains, where Davis goes
into hilariously inappropriate, exple
tive-filled spasms. R
Belle Epoque
In the tradition of critically-ac
claimed, innocuous, little-known
European movies comes Spanish
director Fernando Trueba's "Belle
Epoque." But don't let the hype of a
Best Foreign Film Oscar fool you:
the story of four farmer's daughters
and a Spanish army deserter serves

up sizzling sex scenes, but little his
torical or political content. In
essence, 1993's winner proves to
be nothing more than a dressed-up
Penthouse Forum letter. R
Major League II
If you're looking for a little comedy
with your baseball fun, you won't
find it in "Major League II." The se
quel proves to be a boring rehash
ing of the original, just on a slightly
larger scale: the hapless Indians win
an American League pennant rather
than a mere division championship.
Nothing in the flick works except
maybe Bob Uecker's reprisal of a
his quick-witted commentator role
— if that's really a plus. PG
The Paper
As they say in the newspaper biz,
"The Paper" is Page One material.

Director Ron Howard ably guides a
star-studded cast through a day at
the presses to realistic lengths. And
while some of it may seem melo
dramitc or overacted, the theatrics
of the newsroom staff at the fictitious
New York Sun play true to life. R
Reality Bites
So what if "Reality Bites" is another
movie about twenty-somethings
struggling in the post-college world?
Although no shining rays of wisdom
are revealed in the movie, "Reality
Bites" is a fun movie with a refresh
ing sense of humor. It's immediate
enough for us college students to
forgive its minor flaws. PG-13
The Ref
OK, the premise of burglar Dennis
Leary kidnapping a family after a

botched robbery on Christmas Eve
may seem ludicrous. Yet "The Ref"
turns out to be great fun— especial
ly for those who know what living in
a bickering family is like. What
makes the movie work is director
Ted Demme's ability to walk the fine
line between an overdone comedy
and a wildly chaotic piece. R
Sirens
If you've walked down University in
the last couple of weeks, you've
probably seen the marquee blaring
"Sirens: Be seduced." And the
movie delivers on that promise, al
luring viewers with its surreal, witty,
erotic and original story on the life of
Australian painter Norman Lindsay.
In essence, "Sirens" proves to be
an "art film" in every sense of that
term. R
