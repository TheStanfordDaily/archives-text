Award-winning Italian writer
Dacia Maraini described the
mafia's complex power network
on the island of Sicily, Italy, dur
ing a aim pus address yesterday af
ternoon.
"One became a member of the
mafia to escape the system of
criminality that was run by the
mafia itself," she told a gathering
of about 30 people in the Lou
Henry Hoover Room at the
Hoover Institution.
Maraini, whose prolific body of
work includes 10 novels, five
books of poetry and 35 plays, is
spending this week at Stanford as
a guest of the Italian theme house,
La Casa Italiana.
Claiming that the mafia first
became intertwined with Sicilian
life after the abolition of feudalism
in 1860, Maraini went on to argue
that the mafia gained its power by
filling the social gap left by feudal
ism's demise. As a result of this so
cietal change, mafia members
were able to assert themselves as
protectors of the people, who
claimed to support public inter

ests such as the maintenance of
order.
"The maf a pretends to give im
portant services to Sicilian society,
and in certain cases it is actually
true," Maraini said.
It is for this reason that the
mafia's power has grown to its
present day stature, according to
Maraini, a phenomenon which in
turn has created a society favoring
status quo as opposed to upheaval.
"All the people who have been
helped by the mafia have a vested
interest in the continuation of sta
tus quo," Maraini said.
This network of relationships
is made even more complicated by
what Maraini termed "the ex
change of protection." Given that
many of Sicily's citizens believe
the mafia provides valuable ser
vices, some public servants such
as judges and government officials
have joined forces with the mafia
in order to secure votes.
"The mafia is deeply rooted in
the society because this system of
protection works," Maraini said.
"It works very well."

Italian author Dacia Maraini explains the mafia's power structure to a group at the
Hoover Institution yesterday.
Although the power of the mafia
is virtually incomprehensible,
Maraini does see light at the end of
the tunnel. Whereas a traditionally
dominant characteristic of the

mafia has been its ability to smoth
er all talk of its practices, this "con
spiracy of silence" has been over
turned in recent years by the testi
monies of approximately 300 ex
mafia members.
Consequently, this new trend is
allowing Sicilian officials to uncov
er some of the mafia's mysteries
and prosecute corrupt activities.

Although Maraini recognizes that
it am be questionable whether a
"repentant" is actually telling the
truth, she argued that the consis
tency of several testimonies can
certainly be used as sound evi
dence.
"Even though some have ques
tioned the truth of many state
ments, if there is consistent infor

mation of a politician linked to the
mafia, he should be prosecuted,"
she said.
Despite the current progress
being made, the mafia's symbiotic
link to the life and workings of Sici
ly will continue to make the task
arduous.
"It's a fight, it's a very, very dif
ficult fight," Maraini concluded.
