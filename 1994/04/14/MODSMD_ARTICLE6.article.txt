# Last-minute edit gives new twist to conflict policy
## 
### Colleen Krueger Staff writer 
In an eleventh-hour change,
the committee responsible for the
creation of a new faculty conflict
of interest policy rewrote a contro
versial clause dealing with owner
ship of computer software patent
rights just in time for today's Fac
ulty Senate meeting.
The revised policy draws a
clearer distinction between soft
ware that can be claimed by the
University as an invention and
software protected from institu
tional ownership on the basis of its
creative, "text-like" content.
If adopted by the University,
the policy will establish guidelines
for faculty research, investments
and outside consulting in an at
tempt to avoid improprietous be
havior. The policy also governs

faculty presence
on campus.
At today's
meeting, the sen
ate will continue
to debate
whether it
should recom
mend that Stan
ford adopt the
policy.

While the Faculty Policy on
Conflict of Commitment and In
terest has been more than two
years in the making, comments at
the last senate meeting prompted
Biology Prof. Craig Heller to take
his committee back to the drawing
board Monday for a few last
minute revisions.
"I don't think we've changed
the fundamental intent of any
thing in the document," Heller
said. "We just clarified some of
its language and simplified the
software issue."
The previous version of the
policy drew fire for its attempts
to differentiate between "text
like, educational" software and
software which "like a tool ... is
created to run a machine" in
determining whether the creator
or the University owns its "intel
lectual property rights," Heller
said.
The new version abandons the
effort to distinguish "text-like"
from "device-like" software and
instead draws the line between
patents and copyrights.
Software which can be patent
ed will be considered technology
and subject to the policy's rules
on inventions â€” which in many
cases assigns the University sole
ownership of the patent.
Copyrighted software, howev
er, will be protected in the tradi
tion of academic freedom, which

prohibits the University from
owning the rights to books,
works of art and music and other
"creative" endeavors. In this
case, the copyright will be given
to the software's creator, unless
contractual obligation specifies
otherwise.
"Software spans the whole
continuum, from a tool to a work
of art," Heller said.
"In theory we should be able
to make a case-by-case decision
about software, but we've real
ized that the cost and effort of
such an undertaking would be
overwhelming," he said.
Instead, the committee decid
ed it would be prudent to "back
off" and say that copyrighted
software falls in the artistic
domain, while patented software
can be considered an invention,
Heller said.
"We made a much cleaner dis
tinction between these two
types," he added.
Heller also addressed what he
called the "concern among com
puter scientists that we are say
ing that software is not an act of
creativity."
"On the contrary, we would

bend over backwards to say the
opposite ... to say that creating
a machine is an act of creativi
ty," Heller said. "Once some
thing can be commercialized,
however, it often presents a con
flict of interest which the policy
must cover."
Although textbooks and other
"artistic" material can also be
commercialized, different rules
apply when academic freedom is
at stake, Heller said.
For many of the policy's most
outspoken critics, the change in
software distinction may mean
their long-withheld support.
"This change definitely brings
the policy much more in-line
with [the Committee on Academ
ic Computing and Information
Systems'] guidelines," said Civil
Engineering Prof. Boyd Paulson,
who chairs the committee. "I
would call the change a step in
the right direction."
In a letter published in yester
day's Campus Report, Paulson
criticized the previous version of
the controversial software provi
sion on the grounds that it was
not in line with his committee's
statement on intellectual proper-

ty rights and software drafted
just last year. This statement,
which was endorsed by a majori
ty in the senate, recommended
that courseware and software be
treated consistently with other
creative works.
"I would think that this
change will definitely change
some (senators') positions,"
Paulson added.
Another former critic, Indus
trial Engineering Prof. Warren
Hausman, said the committee's
responsiveness to faculty con
cerns has been overwhelmingly
positive.
"I think they've done an
amazing job at really listening to
us," Hausman said. "I'm quite
satisfied."
Despite these currents of
approval, Heller remains cau
tious in predicting the policy's
future.
Although he hopes the senate
will realize that the document is
a very strong effort to combat a
growing problem, Heller predict
ed its trial by fire is not quite
over.
"I think the debate is going to
intensify and get hotter," he said.
