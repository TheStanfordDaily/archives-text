# Software glitches hamper election
## Bugs in program worked out early 
### Holly Lloyd 
Except for a few initial techni
cal glitches, the new computer
ized voting system for the ASSU
elections is running smoothly, ac
cording to the Elections Commis
sion.
Some of the first electronic vot
ers to hop on the high-tech system
yesterday had trouble recording
their votes. According to graduate
student Enda Hu, one of the pro
grammers involved in the on-line
voting project, the connections
were initially "kind of flaky."
The first-run glitches were
fixed, unrecorded votes recorded,
and according to Hu, there were
no complaints the rest of the day.
AsofB:3o p.m. last night, 2,172
students had voted using the new
computer system, 28 by paper bal
lot. Last year, 5,012 students
voted in total.
Non-students with Leland ac
counts are able to vote on the
computerized system, but ac
cording to Jaasi Munanka, who
monitors election violations,

these votes will not be included
in the final tally.
Despite the new voting sys
tem's technical wizardry and

$5,000 in
cost savings,
some stu
dents are
displeased
with how it
has been im
plemented.
"People

should have been better educated
as to how to use the on-line sys
tem," said Mike Choo, a candidate
for undergraduate senator. "The
idea is very good, but for the first
transitional year, it could have
been better."
Choo said he heard voters com
plain that the computerized sys
tem took longer than paper ballots
and was confusing because it did
not match the format of the sam
ple ballots. He called for better
publicity in the future, including
electronic-mail notices to every

student explaining how to use the
system.
According to Election Commis
sioner Tom Tsao, the new voting
procedure was well publicized.
Notices were sent to about 13,500
students with their spring quar
ter tuition bill and advertise
ments in The Daily were used to
inform students about the on-line
system. Still, there is concern
that the computerized approach
might keep voters from the polls,
electronic or not.

"I'm concerned that voter
turnout will be low," Choo said.
But a low turnout may also be
the result of an amendment to the
ASSU Constitution passed last
year which makes special-fee
refunds no longer contingent on
voting.
"People are now voting as a
sense of duty. ... In the past, peo
ple were bribed to vote. I think
we'll see a significant drop [in
voter turnout] as a result," Tsao
said. "It'll be hard to speculate
whether it's the on-line system or
the fee refund issue."
One of the major criticisms of
the on-line system has come from
graduate students. Because the

UNIX-based program is available
only to students with Leland
accounts, some graduate students
in business, law and medicine
have not been able to use the new
system.
Traditional paper ballots are
still available, although they can
delay tallying results. A polling
station will be set up outside the
Graduate School of Business today
from 11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. In
addition, paper ballots are avail
able between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. in
the ASSU lobby in Tresidder.
Observers from the San Mateo
County Elections Commission, as
well as a professor from Califor
nia State University at Hayward,

are visiting Stanford to see the
new on-line voting program in
action.
Stanford is one of the first uni
versities, along with MIT, to use
such a system, according to
Nawwar Kasrawi, an electrical
engineering graduate student
senator involved in implementing
the on-line program.
Once the voting procedure has
been refined and the bugs worked
out, election results will be avail
able half an hour after the polls
close, said Kasrawi.
"It's basically a good system.
There are just a few things to be
ironed out so that everybody has
access," he said.
