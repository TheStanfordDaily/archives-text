# Women's groups fight for return of defense class
## 
### Beth Berselli Staff writer 
Sponsors of the women's self-defense class kicked
off campus last fall are launching a campaign to con
vince the University that the course does not violate
a federal regulation against sex discrimination.
"We believe that we were never in violation of
Title IX, and we're preparing a legal brief for Stan
ford to outline the reasons that support our argu
ment," said Margaret Hodder, a member of the
Women Defending Ourselves Collective.
The class — titled "Issues in Self-Defense for
Women" and offered through the Program in Femi
nist Studies — was canceled last September as the
result of a complaint that segregating sections by
sex violated Title IX, a 1972 regulation prohibiting
sex discrimination in schools that receive federal
funding.
Last fall, the University declined an investigation
by the U.S. Department of Education's Office of
Civil Rights and decided instead "to bring the class
into compliance without any determination by the
Office of Civil Rights," Hodder said.
Collective members, many of whom now teach
the class off campus, say that work on their brief
should be finished within the month. "We will soon
be prepared to begin discussions with the Universi
ty," Hodder said.
Once the brief is complete, she said the group will
hold a rally "to make people aware of the issue and


Heller
to demonstrate support for the
class."
Members of the collective
have also gathered almost 50
letters of support and more
than 200 signatures on a peti
tion calling for the course's
return to campus. "And that's
only in the past week," collec
tive member Rachel Katz said.
"We're trying to let the Univer
sity know that the issue won't
just die off."
Assoc. University General
Counsel Iris Brest said it is pos
sible that the course will be rein
stated, but not with classes that
exclude men.
"The regulations clearly say
that these classes should not be
offered in separate, sex-segregat
ed sections," Brest said. "It is
perfectly possible for the course
to be redefined in such a way
that it is clearly consistent with
Title IX."
But collective members decid
ed against changing the class last

fall when the University suggest
ed two alternative formats. "We
could either offer co-ed classes or
teach a single-sex, strictly physi
cal P.E. course, with no discus
sions or assertiveness training,"
Katz said.
Members felt that in a co-ed
class women would no longer feel
safe discussing personal issues
and in a strictly physical self
defense class women would not
learn important assertiveness
skills.
"Neither option was accept
able so we canceled the class,"
Katz said.
Collective members are hope
ful about the chances of getting
the class back. "I think that we
have a very good strong legal
basis for making our argument,
and it's our hope that when the
University reviews our argu
ment they will reinstate the class
as a single-sex course," Hodder
said.
"I think that the class is fun
damental," collective member
Kris Carpenter said. "For the
women who take the course, it
can be life-altering. Everyone
should have access to it."
