# ASSU elections yield few winners
## 19 special fees smoked in elections; many losses to low voter turnout 
### B Jim Luh Scott Van Winkle Staff writers 
In what may prove to be a crippling
blow to several student organizations,
voters rejected 19 special-fee requests —
with three more pending — in this week's
ASSU Elections. Three of the campus'
four ethnic student organizations were
among those not approved.
Most of the groups denied funding
were supported by a majority of students
voting, but failed to garner a total vote
large enough to meet participation re
quirements. The ASSU Constitution re
quires that at least 15 percent of the stu
dent population, or about 2,100 students,
approve a special-fee request in order for
it to be adopted.
Of the 36 groups which requested spe
cial-fee funds from the ASSU, only 14 met
this standard. Last year, 27 of 32 requests
passed.
Many student groups, which depend
on special-fee revenue to fund most of
their budgets, said they will be forced to

cancel events and reduce services next
year. The ASSU fee will decline from
about $37 per quarter this year to $26 per
quarter.

year, said Axe Committee chair
Craig Zajac.
MEChA co-treasurer Elvira Pri
eto, who later insisted that she was
speaking as an individual and not
representing the Chicano-Latino
community, said "it's taken away
the funding for all the program
ming that we do. Whenever we do
anything above and beyond special
fee, we have to work really hard,
and it takes a lot of leg work."
Axe Committee's Zajac was
even more pessimistic. "Do you
know any way to raise $23,000 in
a couple of months?" he asked.
Sophomore Vanessa Alvarado
added, "When things like tutoring
kids in East Palo Alto get shot
down, what does this have to say
about where Stanford stands?"
Of the four minority student
organizations, only the Asian
American Student Association's
request passed. The Black Stu
dent Union, MEChA and the
Stanford American Indian Orga
nization all failed to gain their
requests.

ence all lost their fee requests.
STOP, KZSU and Sexual
Assault Legal Advocates came
within 50 votes of victory as of
last night. Their requests may be
approved if current enrollment
figures are sufficiently lower than
those for fall quarter.
The surprising number of
denials was attributed to a mobi
lized graduate student population
and a high number of absten
tions. Of the 19 groups which
were denied, 10 were approved by
a majority of those voting. An
average of 1,450 students
abstained from approving each
fee request.

The graduate student backlash
this week had its root in previous,
coordinated actions. This year, a
high number of graduate stu
dents expressed their dissatisfac
tion with student groups which
they say benefit undergraduates
disproportionately by requesting
refunds of the money they were
charged in special fees.
Fee refunds, which had previ
ously totaled less than 25 percent
of money given to student groups,
skyrocketed to 39 percent winter
quarter, mainly because more
graduate students requested
refunds.
A "fair-funding" amendment
to create separate special-fee
votes for undergraduates and
graduates was also defeated in
this week's elections, allowing
graduate student resentment to
impact special-fee votes.
"If we had the fair-funding
amendment, most of the groups
would have gotten their special
fees," said Alvarado.
"The Axe Committee knew
that (the amendment] needed to
pass. Some of the other under
graduate groups on campus didn't
support it and didn't get their
members to support it," said
senior Steve Zika, a former chair
of the Axe Committee.
