# ASSU elections yield few winners
## 19 special fees smoked in elections; many losses to low voter turnout 
### B Jim Luh Scott Van Winkle Staff writers 
In what may prove to be a crippling
blow to several student organizations,
voters rejected 19 special-fee requests —
with three more pending — in this week's
ASSU Elections. Three of the campus'
four ethnic student organizations were
among those not approved.
Most of the groups denied funding
were supported by a majority of students
voting, but failed to garner a total vote
large enough to meet participation re
quirements. The ASSU Constitution re
quires that at least 15 percent of the stu
dent population, or about 2,100 students,
approve a special-fee request in order for
it to be adopted.
Of the 36 groups which requested spe
cial-fee funds from the ASSU, only 14 met
this standard. Last year, 27 of 32 requests
passed.
Many student groups, which depend
on special-fee revenue to fund most of
their budgets, said they will be forced to

cancel events and reduce services next
year. The ASSU fee will decline from
about $37 per quarter this year to $26 per
quarter.
The defeat means "no bonfire and no
