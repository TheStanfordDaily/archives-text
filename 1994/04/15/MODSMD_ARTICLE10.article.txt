Barkett approved
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Senate
approved a federal appeals judge yesterday
after conservative Republicans assailed
her legal opinions and turned her confir
mation into a six-hour debate on crime and
the death penalty.
On a 61-37 near-party-line vote, the
Senate confirmed the nomination of Rose
mary Barkett, chief justice of the Florida
Supreme Court, to the 11th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals. The circuit covers Flori
da, Georgia and Alabama. Only six Repub
licans voted to confirm Barkett.
Her nomination to the lifetime judge
ship had been pending since September.
Barkett, 54, often has shown sympathy
toward criminal defendants with troubled
backgrounds. She has been accused of
being too soft, on crime, even though she
voted for the death penalty in 270 cases.
Barkett "epitomizes the kind of judge

the American people don't want, but we're
going to get her," said Sen. Robert Smith,
R-N.H. "The American people are sick and
tired of these liberal judges who coddle the
criminal."
Cigarettes defended
WASHINGTON (AP) - Cigarettes are
not an addiction but merely a pleasurable
habit, much like a morning cup of coffee or
a dessert, the nation's top tobacco execu
tives told Congress yesterday.
But in often angry exchanges, lawmak
ers charged cigarette makers with trivializ
ing and suppressing information about the
health impact of their products.
The chiefs of the nation's seven largest
tobacco companies spent over six hours
yesterday testifying before the House
Energy and Commerce health subcommit
tee about what goes into cigarettes and
whether they're dangerous.
