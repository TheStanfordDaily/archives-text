WASHINGTON (AP) - American
fighter jets mistakenly shot down two
U.S. Army helicopters over northern
Iraq yesterday, killing the American
crews and passengers from four other
nations. "Something went wrong,"
said the chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, and President Clinton
promised to find out what.
The dead were military officers
from the United States, Britain,
France, and Turkey working to sup
port the U.N. humanitarian relief
operation aiding the Kurdish minori
ty in northern Iraq. Five Kurds also
were aboard.
The helicopters were shot down by
two F-15C fighters enforcing the "no
fly zone" over the area. Clinton
expressed "terrible sorrow" and
pledged a thorough investigation.
At the Pentagon, Defense Secre
tary William Perry said initial reports
indicated the fighter pilots mistook
the UH-60 Blackhawk choppers for
Iraqi "Hind" helicopters.
Both jets apparently had the heli
copters in sight during the daylight
mission and both fired missiles, Perry

said. F-15s carry AMRAAM or
Sidewinder air-to-air missiles.
An AWACs reconnaissance plane
was overseeing the helicopters' flight.
Gen. John Shalikashvili, the Joint
Chiefs chairman, said the final order
to shoot normally is given "on the
scene" and not from military com
manders at the jets' base in Incirlik,
Turkey.
"Clearly, something went wrong,
and an investigation will have to
determine exactly what did go
wrong," said the four-star Army gen
eral, who spearheaded the relief effort
for the Kurds in 1991.
U.S. warplanes and helicopters
normally use electronic identification
systems designed to tell friend from
foe.
If proper procedures were followed,
the helicopters' identification beacons
should have been operating routinely,
Shalikashvili said. He did not say
whether the Pentagon knew if the
beacons were on or if they emitted the
proper coded messages.
A Kurdish spokesman said the heli
copters were ferrying U.S., British,

French and Turkish officers from the
U.N. office in Zakho, near the Turkish
border. The group planned to meet
Kurdish leaders in Salahaddin, the
central region of the Kurdish zone.
Clinton said those who died were a
part of a "mission of mercy. They
served with courage and professional
ism, and they lost their lives while
trying to save the lives of others. The
important work they were doing must
and will continue," he said.
The dead included 15 from the
United States, three from Turkey,
one from France, two from Britain
and five Kurds, Lt. Gen. Richard
Keller, the chief of staff of the U.S.
European Command in Stuttgart,
Germany, said in a telephone briefing
with reporters at the Pentagon.
"There were no survivors," Keller
said. The bodies were being taken to
the base in Turkey.
"I take full responsibility for
today's tragedy," Perry said, adding
that he and the general wanted to
publicly express their sorrow and con
dolences to the families of those
killed.
