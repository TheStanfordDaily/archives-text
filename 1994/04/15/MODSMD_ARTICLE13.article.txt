						non-secret ballot 
### 
WITH ON-LINE voting
instituted this year, the
ASSU spring elections
eliminated the long waiting lines
at polling sites.
But for the handful of students
who voted by paper ballot, the
election also eliminated the option
of anonymous voting.
Students who voted by paper
ballot had their name and student
ID number recorded on the first
page of the paper balloting packets.
This information, however, was
never crossed out, detached or
somehow hidden to protect the
voter's identity. Because of securi
ty precautions — for example, to
check if someone had already
voted electronically — the name
and ID number had to remain.
But why on the ballot? Why not
on a separate list?
With names attached to ballots,
the vote counter may as well be

standing over the voters' shoul
ders the whole time. Even if vote
counters are, in fact, completely
uninterested in how people voted,
the atmosphere can still be very
uncomfortable for the voter — and
the possibility of disclosure still
exists
The ASSU's first attempt at
implementing an on-line voting
system cannot be expected to be
perfect. But it should have taken
more care to guarantee voters the
right to remain anonymous.
And while elections security is
certainly a concern, the expecta
tion of anonymity is too funda
mental and necessary to the voting
process to eliminate for any rea
son.
It is the basis on which voters
can vote how they feel — knowing
that no one else, not even those
whose task it is to count the votes,
will know how they voted.
