The assu elections
handbook is the official guide
to the just concluded spring
voting. Unfortunately, poor distri
bution and significant errors made
the publication an ineffective source
of information about the elections.
The first version of the special-fee
summaries included headlines that
were out of place and confusing.
This was apparently a layout error,
but the ASSU cannot absolve itself
of all responsibility. Someone should
have checked the final proofs before
sending them off to the printer.
Because of the errors, the ASSU
had to reprint the fee-request por
tion of the handbook as a "supple
ment," costing the organization
$300.
And there were other mistakes
that were not fixed. The Legal
Office's summary and budget were
missing — though the fee request
was on the sample ballot. And the
name of undergraduate senate can
didate Rupali Gandhi was left off
the sample ballot — though her

platform statement was included.
One of the most significant
choices in the election — the Pub
lications Board request for a
tripling of its funding — was nei
ther on the sample ballot nor dis
cussed anywhere else. Neglecting
to inform the electorate of such a
significant choice, which would
have increased each student's fee
by $7.70, is inexcusable.
Since this year's election used
students' UNIX accounts — mean
ing that voting was not limited to
certain hours at certain locations
— handbook distribution was also
inadequate.
In the future, the elections com
mission should look into letting vot
ers read about special fee groups,
candidates and amendments on-line
as they vote. Such a system would
also better inform voters by allow
ing corrections and changes after
the paper handbook is printed.
Because an ill-informed elec
torate is worth even less than an
apathetic one.
