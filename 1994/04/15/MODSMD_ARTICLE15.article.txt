## Stephen Peeps The 						critical importance of alumni giving 
### 
AS A STANFORD graduate (Class of
1974), and as director of University
development, I get many questions
these days about Stanford's low alumni
giving rate and whether it really matters.
After all, if this is indeed a problem, it is
chronic rather than sudden; the percent
age of alumni who make annual gifts has
hovered around 25 percent ever since the
19505, when such statistics were first com
piled. Moreover, Stanford seems no worse
for it. Anyone who has experienced the
University recently — including those of
us here today — would likely describe it as
a prosperous place where essential things
somehow always get taken care of. It is
therefore easy to dismiss the significance
of alumni -giving and take Stanford for
granted. It is also very dangerous.
What really accounts for this historic
nonchalance about annual giving? It
begins with the fact that our alumni do not
realize that there is a need. Few students
and alumni understand that, despite the
high price of tuition, room and board, these
fees contribute only a fraction of Stan
ford's yearly costs. In fact, undergraduate
tuition represents only about a quarter of
this year's Operating Budget. Why such
high costs? Because, as with life in general,
quality does not come cheap, particularly
when the goal is to assemble the nation's
best faculty, students and academic facili
ties. We all came here for that and, frankly,
we want nothing less.
A Stanford education is therefore subsi

dized — not just for some, but for every
one. And, because well over half of us Eire
helped through Stanford with financial aid
(thanks to one of the nation's few remain
ing need-blind admissions policies), the
subsidy is generally greater again.
It is commonly assumed that Stanford's
sizable endowment closes the gap, but that
again is a misperception. By definition,
endowment principal is composed mostly
of large gifts for important but restricted
purposes, and this principal cannot be
spent; only the income it generates is avail
able for use and, by policy, only part of that
is actually spent (the rest is prudently rein
vested to grow the principal). As a conse
quence, the unrestricted income actually
generated from endowment*, valuable as it
is, accounted for only 20 percent of this
year' 9 Operating Budget:" 1 »»
Why then has Stanford prospered this
long despite the modest percentage of
alumni who make annual gifts? The
answer is that, so far, a relatively small
number of people have been disproportion
ately generous. They believe in repaying
the generosity they received from Stanford
as a result of annual gifts from the alumni
who preceded them. We know they also
believe there is an ongoing investment to
be made in sustaining Stanford's excel
lence and, along with it, the life-long value
of their Stanford degree.
The rest of us — not to mention the Uni
versity itself — have in turn become dispro
portionately reliant on this loyal minority.

In doing so we have put Stanford at risk.
This same 25 percent cannot shoulder the
load endlessly. In addition, the steady ero
sion of other revenues — particularly feder
al and state support — is already widening
the gap between what our alumni loyalists
are giving and what Stanford needs each
year to sustain its quality. That is where,
and why, the issue of alumni giving sud
denly becomes so important.
While all this helps to explain the need, it
fails to address the other key reason alumni
tend not to give: it simply seems impossible
that, on its own, a single contribution will
make much of a difference. Yet each gift, no
matter how small, can take on real meaning
at both a personal and collective level.
This begins witlv recognizing that, no
matter how hard-earned, a Stanford edu
cation is a privilege rather than an entitle
ment. And with that privilege comes the
responsibility to make it possible for who
ever comes next.
Second, if you believe that society bene
fits from the relatively few places where
the best minds come together, then Stan
ford is certainly one of those places and
requires constant replenishment.
Third, we all have a vested interest in
sustaining Stanford's excellence if, indeed,
we hope to put the value of our Stanford
association to good use over the course of
our lives.
Fourth, the power of unrestricted annu-

al gifts is best measured by their
collective rather than individual
impact. Even a small percentage
increase in alumni participation
aggregates to immediate and con
siderable value. Moreover, annual
gifts are earmarked for financial
aid, faculty salaries and library
acquisitions, as well as the real
time needs of Residential Educa
tion and the community centers.

Finally, whether we like it or not,
the world beyond Stanford treats
alumni participation as a direct
measure of how alumni themselves
assess Stanford's quality — not
merely how we might be feeling at a
given time about a pet peeve or pol
icy. In that regard, the public's
regard for Stanford's value is veiy
much in our own hands.
Why should current students
care whether more alumni make
annual gifts? The immediate
answer is that, so long as you are
here, you depend on them. More
important is that, within just a

year or two or three, you too will
join the alumni family where the
vast majority of your association
with Stanford will be spent. If you
continue to care about Stanford,
then all these other reasons for
making annual gifts come into
play. And judging by the extraordi
narily positive response by this
year's seniors to Peter Bing's
Senior Gift Challenge, they already
are. It's time to lead the way.
