## Spouse thanks supporters, criticizes 'political decision' 
### 
AS CECILIA Burciaga's husband
and co-resident fellow at Casa
Zapata I would like to express
our deepest sentimientos of apprecia
tion for the overwhelming messages
and calls of support that numbered
over 100. She has tried to acknowledge
or return all of them.
Also, I would like to express my own
thoughts on the callous political decision
to terminate Cecilia's position with no
alternative. It is insulting to the intelli
gence of many people to call it strictly a
budget cut.
The Chicano/Latino community will
continue to feel the effects of administra
tors from the snow and rust belts who
have no concept, knowledge or respect for
Chicano culture, geography, history of
California, the Southwest and leaders
such as Cecilia. Mary Edmonds' insistence
on calling Chicanos "Hispanics" from
time to time is offensive.
What Cecilia has meant to Stanford
community for the past 20 years goes
beyond El Camino Real. She continuously
receives letters from alumni, especially
women, thanking her for her inspiration
and support. Her friendships and connec
tions stretch from Stern Hall dining work

ers to serving on national boards and
commissions such as the Educational
Testing Standards Board, President
Carter's Commission on Women, Palo
Alto's YWCA Board of Directors, United
Way of Santa Clara and the Ford Founda
tion Commission on Higher Education.
Her awards are endless and her promi
nence is not only local but national.
Zapata students are well aware that
they can still find Cecilia working past
midnight most nights and that our door is
always open. She writes no less than two
recommendations a week for students.
Worthy of mention is Cecilia's love for
the American Indian community. It is sec
ond to none because she knows Chicanos
are also indigenous. My most poignant
memory of this goes back 19 years ago.
Cecilia came home one Saturday after
noon in tears after attending an American
Indian graduation. The American Indian
community had awarded their top student
with a $15 check for academic excellence.
Cecilia wept like I have rarely seen her,
pained and unable to understand this in
such a wealthy university.
Many people are familiar with Cecilia's
tough exterior but unfamiliar with her
soft side. This June, attend a Chicano or

American Indian graduation ceremony,
which "some administrators" would like
to discontinue, and you will know what
Stanford means to all these families.
Before coming to live at Stanford, I
worked in Silicon Valley and found it diffi
cult to accept Cecilia's long hours at Stan
ford. It was not until the whole family
moved here that I understood what Stan
ford means and her love for the students.
It was through Cecilia that I was able to
paint a major mural, bring other muralists,
write four books and establish a career I
had only dreamed of, not to mention the
opportunity to work with students.
"In the past," she confided, "I could
tangle with whoever and they would
engage in the debate. But now it's like
you're fighting a ghost. .. . This is not the
way I wanted to leave Stanford. .. ." But
for someone who speaks the truth, there
was no other way in such a politically
oppressive atmosphere.
Cecilia is also proud to be in the compa
ny of so many other contributors who
have been driven from Stanford. Such was
Ray Bachetti, her first Stanford mentor,
Alice Supton, associate dean of Residential
Education, Bob Beyers, former director of
Stanford News Service, Margarita Ibarra

of Events and Services, terminated after
22 years, and so many others.
Our request to be allowed a transition
al period at Zapata (normally granted)
was to not only insure continued strength
for Casa Zapata but also because our 17-
year-old son, Tono, will be a senior at
Gunn High School next year. We don't
want to interrupt his social and academic
life. Our daughter Rebeca, a second-year
student at UC-Santa Cruz, was only three
weeks old when Cecilia interviewed for
her first of many positions at Stanford.
Tono was born at Stanford.
Unmentioned as they have been, our
two children have sacrificed more than
anyone else while at the same time loved
life at Stanford. Tono took the news in
typical humorous stride. "We'll move to
wherever, start a new life and change our
names."
We won't change our names, but we do
look forward to continuing our work
someplace else. We leave a lot of friends
and wonderful memories but we will be
close by down the road someplace. Know
that we will take with us your love and in
return we leave you ours. iViva Zapata!

We won't change our names, but we do
look forward to continuing our work
someplace else. We leave a lot of friends
and wonderful memories but we will be
close by down the road someplace. Know
that we will take with us your love and in
return we leave you ours. iViva Zapata!
