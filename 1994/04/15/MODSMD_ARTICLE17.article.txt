# Switching to semester system has drawbacks
## 
### 
The Daily reported on April 11 that
Stanford may switch from the quarter
system to semesters. UC-Berkeley made
a similar switch in the fall of 1983, right
in the middle of my undergraduate years
there. I therefore got the opportunity to
compare the same university under both
quarter and semester systems, and I'd
like to share my opinions of change.
In my opinion, the quarter system
was preferable. Here's why:
• Year-long classes that used to be
three quarters long were now two

semesters in length. This seemed pretty
innocuous to us until we realized that,
come finals week, we were to be tested
on 15 weeks worth of chemistry instead
of 10. Think about that as you study
physics this June!
• There is a brief period during the
middle of a quarter where it seems that
academic life is bogging down and you
just wish the term was over. Under the
semester system, this became what I
called the mid-semester doldrums, an
entire month or more where I slogged
through week after week with no end in
sight. This was quite depressing.
• The actual transition from quarters
to semesters was a royal pain. Since the
academic year under quarter systems

typically goes from early October
through the middle of June, and the
semester system goes from early
September to the middle of May, our
transition summer break was only two
months long, wreaking havoc with sum
mer jobs, summer school, and psycholog
ical well-being. The unit conversion was
annoying; you wouldn't believe what a
school bureaucracy can do with the con
cept of a third of a unit ("Oh, you only
have 119.9 units, you can't gradu
ate. . . .").
• The most important change, howev
er, was the reduction of students' abili
ties to take that wonderful, once-in-a
lifetime class — the elective. There are
many classes that are one term long,

regardless of what the term is. There
fore, one-quarter electives turned into
one semester electives; if a biology
wanted to take computer science, astron
omy, German, music theory, and the his
tory of the Falkland Islands to be more
"well-rounded," he now lost the ability
to take a full one-third of those courses.
I was thankful that my lower-division
years were spent with quarters, so I was
able to take many of those classes; the
people that came after me were not so
lucky.
I hope this letter helps the debate
about whether or not to switch.
