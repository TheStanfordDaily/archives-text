# Tish Williams
## Packing that resume — I wanna be a senator, man 
### 
FOE AS LONG AS I can remember,
I've wanted to be an ASSU sena
tor. To taste the power that comes
with membership in an elite corps of
Richard-NLxons-to-be. To bask in head
line after headline about proposed sand
paper-to-Charmin-toilet-paper upgrades
in bathroom stalls campus-wide. To get
unlimited bullet-proof Cushman motor
cades to the post office and back.
Vote for Tish, she's delish.
I can see it now — President Casper
and I, having a quick II Fornaio-catered
lunch out on the verandah, comparing
the full-bodied taste of Diet Coke to the
more tangy flavor of Diet Pepsi. Condi
Rice leaving loving messages on my
answering machine, begging for my
insightful feedback on the nocturnal
lighting illuminating the Mem Chu
facade. The ID-checker at Meyer waving
me through the library entranceway,
recommending a carrel in a secluded cor
ner of the media center for my personal

enjoyment.
If it's not Tish, is rub-bish.
Unmonitored second-helpings of
artery-busting desserts at the Faculty
Club. Door-to-door limo service from the
Mall to SLAC to the faculty ghetto, wet
bar included. The penthouse suite in
Blackwelder, at my disposal anytime,
roach motels chipped in free of charge.
Tish is no cold fish.
Ability to fall asleep in a large room
full of pontificating peers? Like a baby.
Screwing the students and watching
their dreams of representation go the
way of the Tidy Bowl Man? Not a prob
lem. Allergies to luxurious cherry-wood
furniture and butter-soft Corinthian
leather? Why, no.
Tish — the right man for the job.
I can smell the Nike endorsements
coming. Me, slam-dunking amendments
over Elizabeth Dole in one-on-one bas
ketball mastery. Me, getting nothing but
net in a three-point contest with Ruth

Bader Ginsberg. Me, going Easy Spirit
to Easy Spirit with Diane Feinstein in
my AirASSU's.
When it comes to comfort and fit,
nothing compares to Tish.
My Saturday Night Live stint with
Roger Clinton is just around the corner.
Me, handing my underwear to David
Letterman in an all-you-can-sniff
hygienefest. Xuxa and me, in matching
hotpants, speaking unintelligible
English to baby-faced potential voters of
the future.
The ASSU won't be childish with
Tish.
I have always yearned for the chance
to spread my cold sores to the pink
cheeked babies of the world, shaking
their poorly toupeed fathers' hands vig
orously and giving a strong upper-arm
squeeze to their beaming mothers. To
convince them that I am an upstanding,
moral human being who would never
take advantage of a poor, unfortunate

livestock, no matter how tantalizing the
benefits.
Tish is not a four-letter word.
Smacked my lips at the opportunity
to charm the pants off doe-eyed frosh
who believe that I, and only I, can turn
Tresidder into a real student union,
complete with Long John Silver and
Pizza Hut franchises.
Vote Tish if you want fish and deep
dish.
I really, truly believe that I am the
one caring, compassionate individual
who can make all my campaign promises
come true. I can feel the University
swaying under my weight as I push for
Playboy channel hook-ups in every
dorm. Fruzen-Gladje gallons in every
dining hall. Less stringent parking-vio
lation monitoring by Turban Man.
The ASSU's not just a fetish for Tish.
I can just see the postal workers shak
ing in their polyester pants as I, the
mighty non-voting senator, step up to

the window and demand that my Sports
Illustrated swimsuit edition be handed
over swiftly and without hesitation.
Vote Tish, my name is almost "shit"
spelled backwards.
Just imagine, me, right next to Rush
Limbaugh on Mt. Rushmore II in Butte,
Montana. Me, signing my name for free
postage on glossy campaign brochures
mailed to my millions of loyal followers.
Me, gracing the front of the buck-and-a
quarter bill. Me, on a ticket with Keanu
Reeves, perched at the helm of the free
world, all the continents at my beck and
call.
Don't vote for Tish and watch this
ego go squish.

Everybody has bad days, OK?
