## Another sweep? Batters to swing at Bears 
### Andy Eiser Senior staff writer 
Who says familiarity breeds contempt?
After executing a masterful sweep of its archrival
two weeks ago, the No. 10 Cardinal baseball team
holds no special grudge for the unranked California
Golden Bears as the teams conclude their season
series with another three-game set this weekend.
In fact, Stanford (24-15, 12-6 in the Pacific 10 Con
ference Southern Division) approaches the unranked
Golden Bears (19-26, 8-10) in the same manner it pre
pares for any Six-Pac opponent — with guarded opti
mism.
"It's not realistic to think we can sweep them again,
because they play better at home," said Cardinal head
coach Mark Marquess, referring to a "road-home
road" format that sandwiches tomorrow's game at
Sunken Diamond between dates at Evans Diamond in
Berkeley today and Sunday afternoon. Stanford swept
Cal in a series with reversed format March 31-April 2.
Logistics aside, however, the Cardinal appears to
hold a tangible edge over the fourth-place Golden
Bears. Stanford remains tied with Arizona State a half
game back of conference-leading USC (with the Sun

Devils and Trojans battling in Los Angeles this week
end), while fourth-place Cal stands 4-1/2 games off the
pace and needs a sweep to get back into the race.
But Six-Pac games are not decided on paper and offer
a degree of unpredictability that can at once be charming
and unsettling for front-runners like Stanford.
"The league is full of well-coached, quality players,
and there is no rhyme or reason to the outcomes,"
Marquess said. "Once you start thinking about who
should beat whom, you outsmart yourself."
For its part, the Cardinal has played smart baseball
of late, riding hot hitting by all pails of its lineup to
seven wins in its last nine conference games.
Near the top of the order, junior second baseman
Jed Hansen, who lined two big RBI singles Tuesday
and ranks in the top 10 in four Six-Pac offensive cate
gories, has been at the forefront of Stanford's surge.
"Jed leads us in runs scored, and that's the most
important contribution he can make," Marquess said.
Hansen's 44 runs rank him second in the conference,
just one behind ASU's Scott Shores.
In the middle of the attack, sophomore left fielder
Steve Carver, who recently switched from seventh to

sixth, has come on strong and hit
his First home run of the year
against the Dons. Meanwhile, at
the bottom of the order, sopho
more centerfielder Cale Carter
rounds out the lineup with some

unexpected sock. Carter cracked
two home runs last weekend, giv
ing him four on the season, and
lashed two more hits Tuesday.
"I'm pleased to see Cale doing
that in the nine-spot. I didn't
expect the power or the RBI poten
tial from him," Marquess said.
The Cardinal looks for its third
straight win at 2:30 p.m. today at
Evans Diamond, with sophomore

Dan Reed (7-2) facing Golden
Bears freshman Keith Evans (3-5).
Sophomore Todd Bartels (4-2) toes
the rubber for Stanford tomorrow
at 1 p.m. at Sunken Diamond,
while freshman Jason Middle
brook (5-0) or sophomore Mike
Robbins (4-3) will start Sunday at
1 p.m. at Evans Diamond. Cal has
yet to announce starters for the
final two games.
