# Students vote Voice
## 
### Jim Luh Scott Van Winkle Staff writers 
No fuzzy dice, no gambling boat
in Lake Lagunita, but possibly a
louder "Students' Voice" in Univer
sity decisions, as that slate for Coun
cil of Presidents overwhelmed its
competition, "The Teamsters," in
the spring general election.
With 4974 votes tallied last
night, near-final totals showed vic
tories for Students' Voice in the
COP race and gains for People's
Platform in the race for seats in the
ASSU Senate. The results will not
be final until overseas ballots have
been tallied and the results are
approved by the ASSU Senate.
Students' Voice, which includes
juniors Mork Murdock, Anietie
Ekanem, and Lisa Lee and sopho
more Vanessa Alvarado, garnered
2063 votes, while the Teamsters
garnered 1,201 votes.
Slate members had few words to
say other than to express their
gratitude to the student body.

"We'll be a more visible COP,"
promised Alvarado.
Their reservedness was perhaps
due to apprehension about the
votes for special fees for ethnic
organizations, which had been
shown by preliminary tallies to be
lagging behind. Students' Voice
members have been prominent
leaders in their respective ethnic
communities.
Teamsters member Doug Miro
expressed his regrets.
"1,200 people voted for the
Teamsters. The white trash vote
just doesn't cut it,"he said.
But Miro took his slate's loss in
stride. "Part of our campaign was
based on complete ignorance of
what the COP does," Miro said. "I
think that our turnout reflects that
ignorance."
An amendment to divide the

undergraduate senate into six geo
graphical districts and four class
districts failed to gamer the two
thirds margin it needed to pass.
"Evidently, students heard the
issues despite the ... avoidance of
the discussion of issues by the
author," said graduate senator
Sanford Dickert, who opposed the
amendment from the start.
Another amendment, which
would have separated the special-fee
vote into graduate and undergradu
ate divisions and allowed each popu
lation to decide separately whether
to fund a special fee, failed to pass.
"Obviously, I'm disappointed
that it didn't pass. I think it was a
very close vote," said graduate sen
ator Nawwar Kasrawi.
The one amendment that did
pass, in the name of greater senate
accountability and a little bit of

humor, was a proposal to require
ASSU senators to wear sweatshirts
on the days of senate meetings.
"I thought it was fun; I'm glad
everyone else did, too," said Dick
ert, who authored the amendment.-
The top vote-getter for the
undergraduate senate was Michael
Choo, who received 760 votes — 87
more than his nearest competitor
— thanks in part to his highly visi
ble "Choose Choo" campaign.
The top ten vote-getters in the
race for undergraduate senate
were Choo, Michelle Gee, Liane
Nomura, Nicole Vazquez, Rupali
Gandhi, Jason Liu, Andre Vanier,
Jerry Chen, Nancy Salas, and
Smeeta Ramarathnam.
Of those winners, six were
endorsed by the People's Platform.
"It really says something that so
many Platform senators were elect-

Ed," Choo said. "It means that stu
dents want change in the senate."
The winners of the ten nonvot
ing seats in the undergraduate sen
ate were Phillip Lin, Elvira Prieto,
Scott Handleman, Irene Folstrom,
Patty Ferguson, Charles Katz, Ed
Malone, Stephen Russell, Mark
Cordoba and Ginger Richardson.
In the schools of Engineering
and Earth Sciences, the winners of
the four voting senate seats were
Kasrawi, Marc Oppenheimer,
Christopher Hondl and Sandeep
Singhal. The winners of the four
nonvoting seats were Juan Taboas,
Dickert, Donald Aingworth and
Sudarshan Chawathe.
In the schools of Humanities
and Sciences and Education, the
winners of the three voting senate
seats were Julie Cantor, Robert
Jonas and Pei-Pei Tang. Mike Bai

ley and Roland M. Clarke won non
voting seats, and David Sutter tied
with Martin Valadez for the third
nonvoting seat.
In the schools of Business,
and Medicine, the winners of the
three voting senate seats were Cur
tis Kin, Seksom Suriyapa and Tom
Adams. The winners of the nonvot
ing seats were Richard Holden,
Lowell Hawkins and Greg Ruhnke.
In the race for Senior Class
Presidents, "The Fab Four," which
included juniors Eric Chen, Paula
Dybdahl, Kevin Harrington, and
Sarah-Marie Martin, beat out its
competition, "The Bottom Line,"
with 331 votes to 249.
Elections Commissioner Tom
Tsao noted that write-in winners
who wish to claim their seats must
file a declaration of intent at the
ASSU office by 5 p.m. today.
