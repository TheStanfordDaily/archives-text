# 'Getting better and better'
## Volley realizes potential, takes on Tritons, Aztecs 
### Kathryn Yang Senior staff writer 
When the Cardinal men's volleyball squad
started the season ranked seventh national
ly, opposing coaches knew it was just a mat
ter of time before Stanford inched its way
into the pollsters' penthouse.
Usually fielding a starting lineup includ
ing two seniors and four first-year starters,
No. 2 Stanford is just beginning to live up to
its full potential. After punishing Long
Beach State and Pepperdine last week, the
Cardinal remains only a game behind first
place USC in the Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation standings.
However, in order to maintain this spot
and keep pace with the Trojans, Stanford
(15-8 overall, 12-4 in the MPSF) will have to
hold two very hungry teams at bay this week
end.
Despite having already defeated both
unranked UC-San Diego and No. 9 San
Diego State at home earlier this season, the
Cardinal will have to be extra cautious this
weekend, according to coach Ruben Nieves.
"We really have to keep up our guard
against these two teams, because they both
want to beat Stanford really badly," Nieves
said. "With San Diego State, they're battling
for a playoff spot and upsetting Stanford will
be what puts them over the top."
The Tritons have not seen a league victo
ry yet this season and would love to get their
only MPSF win against the second-ranked
team in the nation.
During its third and fourth league match
es of the year, the Cardinal creamed the Tri
tons 15-9, 15-1, 15-13 and teased the Aztecs
to a 13-15,15-8, 15-11, 15-3 victory.
"We should have no problems with the
Tritons because they haven't won a league
game yet," said senior setter Canyon Ceman.

"I'm not too worried about them, but San
Diego State is a very talented team with a
couple really good players."
Indeed, the Aztecs will field a lineup cen
tered around junior opposite hitter John
Hyden, who has garnered two MPSF Player
of the Week awards for his tremendous
offensive output.
Hyden has racked in 28 service aces this
season (third in the nation), along with 440
kills and a 6.98 kills per game average (also
third in the nation). Against Stanford earlier,
Hyden led all spikers with 37 kills and a .413
hitting percentage. His top performance of
the season, in which he tallied 58 kills
against Long Beach State on April 1, is also
ranked as the nation's best single-game
offensive output.
Nevertheless, Stanford remains confident
heading into the today's match.
"If we keep on passing well and not mak
ing mental mistakes, we can beat almost any
team out there," said sophomore outside hit
ter Mike Lambert. "We've been building a lot
of momentum lately, and I don't think we've
peaked yet."
Last week, all the pieces came together for
Stanford, and the Cardinal clobbered Pep
perdine and Long Beach State in what might
have been its easiest weekend of the season.
For his efforts during those two victories,
Ceman became Stanford's first selection to
the MPSF Molten Player of the Week chart
this season.
Organizing the Cardinal offense with 132
sets and two service aces over the weekend,
Ceman is finally beginning to shake the
effects of an injury-plagued pre-season.
"I'm really pumped up about how much
better we are right now," Nieves said. "Some
teams stop improving, but we plan on getting
better and better, right up until the last
game of the season."
