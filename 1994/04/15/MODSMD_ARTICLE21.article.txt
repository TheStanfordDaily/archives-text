# Men's tennis to battle UCLA, No. 1 USC
## 
### Mike Langford Senior staff writer 
It may be an uphill battle, but the Stanford men's tennis
team is ready to fight it.
The team faces the most difficult weekend of tennis thus
far, as it travels to southern California to take on UCLA and
USC in two Pacific 10 Conference matches.
Stanford, now ranked second nationally with a 19-1 dual
match record, would do well to win one of the two matches on
this annual road trip. In head coach Dick Gould's 27 years of
coaching, the Cardinal has swept the two Los Angeles schools
on the road only once.
"They are two very good teams, and down there, it's very
difficult to beat them both," Gould said. "Home court advan
tage works in tennis much as it does in basketball."
Friday's match against the Trojans will be the first and

probably more challenging of the two for the Cardinal.
Ranked No. 1 in the most recent Rolex Collegiate Rankings,
USC boasts a deep and formidable lineup in both singles and
doubles.
Allegations that up to five members of the USC tennis
team may have violated NCAA regulations led the Trojans to
voluntarily default two of its matches, including one against
UCLA. However, USC will be at full strength for Stanford.
USC's No. 1 singles player, Zimbabwe's Wayne Black, is
currently ranked second in the nation. However, Stanford's
Mike Flanagan, ranked third, beat Black two weeks ago at
Stanford. Similarly, the Trojans' No. 14-ranked Jon Leach
was beaten by Cardinal Jeff Salzenstein. However, USC swept
Stanford in doubles, and performed well against the middle of
the Cardinal's singles lineup on its way to a 4-3 win.
