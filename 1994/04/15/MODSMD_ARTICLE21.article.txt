# Men's tennis to battle UCLA, No. 1 USC
## 
### Mike Langford Senior staff writer 
It may be an uphill battle, but the Stanford men's tennis
team is ready to fight it.
The team faces the most difficult weekend of tennis thus
far, as it travels to southern California to take on UCLA and
USC in two Pacific 10 Conference matches.
Stanford, now ranked second nationally with a 19-1 dual
match record, would do well to win one of the two matches on
this annual road trip. In head coach Dick Gould's 27 years of
coaching, the Cardinal has swept the two Los Angeles schools
on the road only once.
"They are two very good teams, and down there, it's very
difficult to beat them both," Gould said. "Home court advan
tage works in tennis much as it does in basketball."
Friday's match against the Trojans will be the first and

probably more challenging of the two for the Cardinal.
Ranked No. 1 in the most recent Rolex Collegiate Rankings,
USC boasts a deep and formidable lineup in both singles and
doubles.
Allegations that up to five members of the USC tennis
team may have violated NCAA regulations led the Trojans to
voluntarily default two of its matches, including one against
UCLA. However, USC will be at full strength for Stanford.
USC's No. 1 singles player, Zimbabwe's Wayne Black, is
currently ranked second in the nation. However, Stanford's
Mike Flanagan, ranked third, beat Black two weeks ago at
Stanford. Similarly, the Trojans' No. 14-ranked Jon Leach
was beaten by Cardinal Jeff Salzenstein. However, USC swept
Stanford in doubles, and performed well against the middle of
the Cardinal's singles lineup on its way to a 4-3 win.
Stanford fared better in a 5-2
victory against UCLA. Flanagan
dropped a close three-setter to
now-fifth-ranked Robert
Janecek, and Devens also came
up short in a three-setter
against Eric Taino, but the rest
of the team won its matches
against the young Bruin lineup.
With recent tinkering within
its ranks, Stanford will most
likely sport a new lineup for
USC and UCLA. Barring any
unforeseen changes in the top
three positions, Flanagan,

Salzenstein and senior Robert
Devens should fill the one, two,
and three singles spots, respec
tively.
Fourth singles will most like
ly be played by sophomore Jim
Thomas, who boasts an 18-0
record in dual matches, mostly
at sixth singles. Fifth and sixth
singles will probably see seniors
Chris Cocotos and Vimal Patel
at either slot. Doubles should
remain constant.
Gearing up for the imminent
NCAA tournament, Gould's pri
mary concern for the weekend is
that his squad gets in two good
matches against two excellent
teams.
"This team has competed

well, and competed intelligent
ly. If they maintain a level of
focus, and don't let their minds
wander, they'll do well, win or
lose," Gould said. "That we
make a strong, competitive
effort is the most important
thing."
However, Gould added that if
the players allow themselves to
be distracted, either UCLA or
USC could win easily. In such a
competitive and historic rivalry,
the two matches may result in a
number of ways.
"Any of the three teams is
capable of beating any of the
others on any given day," Gould
said. "I just hope the matches
are close."
