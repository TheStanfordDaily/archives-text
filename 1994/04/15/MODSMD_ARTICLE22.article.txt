# Track sprints south to Mt. SAC Invite
## 
### Jorge Chen 
When the Stanford track and field
team heads off to this weekend's Mt.
SAC Invitational, it will not travel
north but rather the opposite direc
tion.
Bound not for Sacramento, as the
meet's title implies, the squad will
pack its bags instead for southern Cal
ifornia as the Cardinal will join the
best track and field athletes in the
Pacific 10 Conference and profession
al entrants from the entire western
United States at San Antonio College
in Walnut, Calif.
"We are going to send our best to
this meet," said head coach Vin Lan
nana, as he foresees a weekend of tough
competition in all events. While the
team's previous matchups have given
the Cardinal athletes plenty of time to
gather experience under intense cir

cumstances, this weekend's contest
marks the beginning of championship
quality meets.
"This weekend there will be lots of
rough competitors since some of the
best from everywhere will be compet
ing," said freshman middle distance
specialist Leila Burr.
"I am going to try my best and
hopefully I will be able to do well this
weekend."
Many members of the sprinting
squad, which consists of mostly fresh
men and sophomores, are approaching
this meet as their first dip into the
waters of collegiate-level competition.
"The sprint squad is very young with
no seniors. Therefore, this meet will
give us some big time experience with
athletes ranging from high schoolers to
veteran Olympians," said freshman
Jimmie Johnson, who already qualified
provisionally for the Pac-10 Champi

onships in the 200-meters earlier this
month.
With high expectations of himself,
Johnson is approaching this meet as an
opportunity to knock down a personal
barrier.
"I've been really disappointed thus
far this season for not being able to
stop hovering at 21.3 (secondsl," John
son said.
"This weekend I want to get low
21 's so I can get at the doorstep of
breaking the 21 barrier which stood in
my way for four years."
Not only will Stanford be running
and throwing against the strongest col
legiate and Olympic athletes, the trip
will also provide the team with a reflec
tion of its own progress.
"This weekend will provide everyone
with a good measure of where they
stand at this stage of the season," Lan
nana said.
