# Women take second aim at Bruins, Trojans
## 
### Rob Ross Senior staff writer 
The Stanford women's tennis team does not
lose much. Rare indeed are the cases when the
Cardinal (19-2) can seek vengeance for one of
those blemishes during the regular season.
This weekend is one of those rare moments.
In its final dual matches of the year, Stanford
takes on USC (9-10) today at 1:30 p.m., then

UCLA (15-5) tomorrow at 1 p.m. Both events
will take place at the Stanford Tennis Stadium.
While the Trojans aren't pushovers, ranked
19th in the nation, Friday's match will serve as a
mere prelude to one of Stanford's most impor
tant dual matches of the season the following
day. The Bruins jumped up in the rankings to
No. 8 after sneaking away with a 5-4 victoiy over
the Cardinal two weeks ago in Westwood as the
center of the Stanford lineup disintegrated. The

Cardinal won at No. 1 and No. 6 singles, with
Nos. 2-5 all tripping on the Los Angeles concrete.
In the rematch both teams will have some
thing to prove. UCLA needs to legitimize its
new-found top-10 ranking and serve notice that
earlier losses to Arizona State, Brigham Young
University and USC were just the growing pains
of a young team (the Bruins start only one senior
in their singles lineup) coming into its own.
No. 5 Stanford will attempt to show its slip
against UCLA earlier in the year was a fluke.
Moreover, the middle of the Cardinal lineup will
try to reassert the mechanical dominance it
demonstrated in the first two-thirds of the season.
"Against UCLA, three of the girls had bad
days," said Stanford head coach Frank Brennan,
referring to the play of freshman Katie Schluke
bir, and sophomores Kim Shasby and Beth
Berris. "In particular, Katie had her worst
match of the season."
Kristine Kurth, at No. 2 singles, was also a
negative part of the squad's faltering to UCLA,
losing to 6th-ranked Jane Chi. But the senior did
have match point against the higher-ranked Chi
before fading in three sets, and Brennan was sat
isfied with her effort. Moreover, due to a shoul
der injury, Chi will likely sidestep the Stanford
match, making way for 90th-ranked freshman
Diana Spadea at the No. 2 singles slot.
The other starting Stanford senior is team
captain Laxmi Poruri, who just moved up to
occupy the top spot individually in national
rankings despite her loss to llth-ranked Kori
Davidson of Arizona State University. That loss,
which occurred last week in Tempe, was the
senior's first of the season.
The only undefeated singles player in the Car
dinal ladder is freshman Sandra De Silva, who is
21-0 and has been, according to Stanford assis
tant coach Lele Forood, "a buzzsaw" at the sixth
position. De Silva is currently ranked 75th in the
country and is the anchor of a Cardinal lineup
that features a top-100 player in every slot.
At doubles, the only Stanford lock has been
the No. 1 team of Poruri-Schlukebir. This pair is
ranked fifth in the country on the strength of a
12-0 record, but will be challenged by the Bruin
duo of Phebus-Starrett. At UCLA this team
nabbed the first set 6-1 from the powerful Cardi
nal pair, only to lose the next two and the match.
