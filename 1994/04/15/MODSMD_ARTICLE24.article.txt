## Cardinal golfers host California Collegiate 
### Seth Goldstein Staff writer 
Back in the saddle and back
on the Farm.
One week after a rejuvenat
ing second-place finish at the
Ping/Lady Sun Devil Invita
tional in Arizona, the fifth
ranked Stanford women's golf
team hosts the California Col
legiate golf tournament tomor
row and Sunday at the Stan
ford Golf Course. The squad
hopes to carry its recently
improved game back to its
home turf.
"We definitely played more
to our potential (in Arizona),"
said freshman Mhairi McKay.
"It was really encouraging, we
hadn't quite managed to put it
all together before."
McKay finished fourth over
all among individuals at the
Invitational and is currently the
ninth-ranked college player in
the nation.
This weekend's contest will
hold true to its name and fea
ture mainly California teams.
Local teams like Santa Clara
and University of San Francisco
will be in attendance.
"It's a chance for some of
the smaller schools in the area
to showcase their talents in
front of the bigger guns in the
game," head coach Tim Bald
win said. "It's sort of a tune-up
for us before the conference
championships."

However, this does not mean
the competition will be any less
fierce. Ainong the 11-team field
will be No. 2 San Jose State,
No. 3 UCLA and No. 4 USC.
"There's no reason why we
can't beat them," McKay said.
"Especially when we know the
course better than they do."
While the Cardinal golfers
express confidence about their
chances to capture the tourna
ment, San Jose State still caus
es concern in light of the Spar
tan's historical success on the
Stanford greens. The team
holds many of the course
records and captured the Stan
ford Invitational in the fall. One
of the Spartan's top golfers,
Vibeke Stensrud, finished third
in Arizona two strokes ahead of
McKay.
"They think they own this
course," said Baldwin. "Hope
fully, we can prove them
wrong."
Regardless of the outcome of
the tourney, Baldwin is opti
mistic about how the Cardinal
will fare in the national polls
and believes Stanford's high fin
ish last week will give it a boost.
"We will no doubt move up,"
he said. "We probably should
move past USC and UClj\ into
third."
In addition to McKay, senior
Melinda Daniels, junior Jamille
Jose, sophomore Vicky Strada
and freshman Andrea Baxter
will tee off for Stanford.
