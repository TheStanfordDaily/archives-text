# Lacrosse defeats Cal, St. Mary's

While traveling on the path to
the Final Four, the Stanford
women's lacrosse team did a 360
but recovered in time to defeat
California and St. Mary's.
In a surprisingly tough game
against Cal on Tuesday, the Car
dinal (8-1) emerged victorious by
a 10-8 margin, despite trailing for
most of the contest.
"Cal came out strong," said
coach Kay Cowperthwait. "[Stan
ford] could not get into a
rhythm."
In addition, the defense was
greatly hampered after receiving
five yellow cards for rough or
dangerous checking. Although
the team's play for most of the
game lacked intensity, the Cardi
nal managed to regain its compo
sure during the final ten min
utes.
Senior Christina Wiellette led
Stanford offensively at the left
attacking wing position while
senior co-captain Jenn Watts also
added a couple of key goals as the

third home.
Defensively, sophomore third
man Peppie Stephenson and
cover point Hannah Flatau,
despite their foul trouble, both
filled key roles in helping fresh
man goalie Emily Chang preserve
the win.
Overall, however, the team
was not pleased with its perfor
mance and during practice
Wednesday, a team meeting was
called to reassess the Cardinal's
objectives.
"We have not been playing the
level of lacrosse that we are capa
ble of playing," said senior co
captain Kate Applewhite.
"With the most exciting time
of the year coming up, [Stanford]
needs to pick up speed," added
coach Cecelia Paglia.
On Thursday, the team gained
some of the momentum it wanted
when it defeated the Gaels by a
score of 16-8. Balanced goal scor
ing and good defense character
ized an improved Stanford effort.
Wiellette, together with senior
Betsy Bassis, led the Cardinal

with on-target shooting and crisp
passing. In addition, Chang
deflected numerous shots from
the Gaels, especially during the
second half.
"[Stanford! knew what [itj
wanted and came together as a
team," Applewhite said.
On the brink of its postseason
tournaments, the team now feels
it is on a mission. The first chal
lenge will arise on Saturday and
Sunday, when the Cardinal will
travel to Santa Cruz for the
Western States tournament. The
tournament will be a grueling
one since each day, teams will
play three or four games.
Additionally, some of the best
teams from the West will take
part in the tournament. Stan
ford, competing in the top brack
et, will meet University of Col
orado, UC-Santa Barbara and the
East Bay Club during the round
robin portion of the tournament.
The pressure is building on
the Cardinal to win and, as
Applewhite said, it "feels like
cramming for a Final exam."
