# Voter apathy
## Alumni Association cancels trustee elections due to low voter turnout 
### Scott Van Winkle Staff writer 
Stanford students who avoided
the ASSU polls this week might
learn the dangers of apathy —
from their elders.
The Stanford Alumni Associa
tion has decided to cancel elections
to select the eight alumni members
of the Board of Trustees because,
they said, alumni simply don't vote.
Association President Bill Stone,
citing the failure of efforts to in
crease voter turnout — which has
remained around 10 percent over
the last few years — said, "We're
playing to a bored audience at best."
The eight alumni trustees will
now be selected by a nine-member
committee to be named by the as
sociation.
The slate would then be ap
proved or amended by the board's
nominations committee at a joint
meeting of the committees.
Alumni will continue to nomi
nate candidates, and four new
trustees will begin serving their
five-year terms in 1995. The 30-
inember board approves the Uni
versity's budget and oversees its
operation.
The eight alumni trustees have
been elected since 1970, when 28
percent of alumni participated in
the elect ion. Since t hen, participa

tion levels have persistently de
clined, despite outreach efforts
costing up to $75,000 a year.
The price of outreach and a de
sire to make nominees more will
ing to be considered for the posi
tion also motivated the change,
Stone said.
Information packets and moti
vational letters distributed to
alumni was "not a very frugal pro
ject," he said, "because of the num
bers involved."
Furthermore, Stone said such
efforts couldn't work because
"there was just not enough infor
mation or differentiation (between
candidates), and not enough give
and take about what the direction
of the school ought to be."
The change is also expected to
eliminate some of the anxiety in
volved in the selection process and
allow committee members to ac
tively recruit suitable candidates,
Stone said.
"What the change implies is a
lot better way of opening up the
process and getting more minority
and women" to consider the posi
tion, said alumnus Emory Lee,
who served on the task force that
developed the plan.
The association generally re
ceives about 1200 nominations,
Stone said, of whom about 150
agree to run for the positions.
