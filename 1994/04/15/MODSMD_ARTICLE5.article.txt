The Algerian citizen who spent 12 nights
in campus housing impersonating a student
might soon become the problem of Inspector
Clouseau.
Abdelghani Attou has told the U.S. Border
Patrol that he wants to go to France, said a se
nior Border Patrol official. Attou speaks flu
ent French, according to police reports.
Attou pled guilty to two counts of "de
frauding an innkeeper" in March and was
sentenced to three years of probation on April

6 in Palo Alto Municipal Court. One of the
conditions of his probation is to pay Stanford
the $624 he owes in rent by June 2.
Attou is now being held at a detention fa
cility in San Pedro, Calif., the official said.
Attou was granted "voluntary departure"
by an im migration judge at a hearing on Tues
day, according to the official. He has been
given until April 22 to come up with the money
to leave the United Suites. Attou will be kept
in custody until his departure, the official said.
If the French consulate does not grant
Attou a visa, he will have to go back to his na
tive Algeria, the official said.
