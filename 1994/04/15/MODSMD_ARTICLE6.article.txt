## Senate OKs conflict of interest policy 
### Andy Dworkin Colleen Krueger Staff writers 
After a lively and sometimes vicious debate, the
Faculty Senate voted yesterday to endorse a new
conflict of interest policy that sets guidelines for
faculty research, investments and outside consult
ing.
The final version of the Faculty Policy on Conflict
of Commitment and Conflict of Interest represents
more than two years of meetings and revisions by the
senate's Committee on Research.
"Of course I'm absolutely thrilled," said Biology
Prof. Craig Heller, who chairs the committee. "We've
worked so hard to develop a document that will place
Stanford in a good position for the future as far as
conflicts of interest are concerned."
Although it still must be accepted by the Universi
ty, the presence of a vocally supportive University
President Gerhard Casper at yesterday's meeting
suggests that the document will soon become Uni
versity policy.
While the policy eventually passed with only two
dissenting votes, it encountered intense opposition
by several senators.
As soon as the floor was opened to amendments,
Chemistry Prof. Dick Zare jumped up with a bold
proposal to temporarily remove the document's
highly-contested provisions regarding intellectual
property rights. Zare wanted to send that section
back to the committee or another comparable body
for further consideration.
"It is not the intent of this
motion to reject (the section) in
its entirety," Zare said, "but
rather to ask that broader consid
eration be given to certain contro
versial aspects."
The passage Zare wanted to
excerpt extends the University's
jurisdiction over inventions cre
ated with University resources.
The new conflict policy brings
inventions created with gift
funds in line with University pol
icy on other technological inven
tions.
The objections arose out of the
document's distinction between
inventions which are fundamen
tally technological in nature and
those which are protected under
the tradition of academic freedom
— which places books, works of
art and music, and other scholar
ly creations out of the realm of

institutional ownership on the
grounds of freedom of speech and
expression.
While reaction to this section
of the policy has always given
Heller and his committee trou
ble, last-minute wording changes
which draw the line between
patents and copyrights cleared
up many long-standing objec
tions.
Zare, however, still felt that
the policy "seems to say that
'technology' is not 'scholarship.' "
"Many faculty find this distinc
tion not only logically inconsis
tent but also insulting," he added.
Supporters of Zare's amend
ment, including Economics Prof.
Roger Noll and Operations
Research Prof. B. Curtis Eaves,
feared that this week's clarifica
tions — which responded to facul
ty concerns raised at the last sen
ate meeting— may have been
made hastily.
"That's a false accusation,"
Heller responded. "The basic
principles of the document have

remained very much the same.
Suggesting that our response to
faculty concerns has somehow
compromised the quality of the
document is grossly unfair."
Heller also said Zare was fail
ing to recognize the well-estab
lished boundaries of freedom of
speech and expression looming
over the creation of such a policy.
Furthermore, the financial inter
ests with which Zare was con
cerned fall under the category of
distribution of royalties, a subject
the policy does not attempt to
cover, Heller said.
After almost an hour of debate,
which included a lesson in patent
and copyright law from a visibly
excited Casper, the senate finally
voted Zare's amendment down
before passing the policy itself.
While the comprehensive new
policy will mean minor changes
in research procedures through
out the University, its most sig
nificant provisions can be broken
into three parts: commitment,
disclosure and intellectual prop

erty rights.
In its "conflict of commitment"
clause, the document requires
faculty members to spend a sig
nificant amount of time on cam
pus and be available to students.
Under the general heading of
"disclosure," the new policy asks
that any relationships between
researchers and their sources of
funding which could be construed
as questionable be divulged to the
University, then approved
through their schools.
In other news, English Prof.
Ron Rebholz questioned a new
University policy that requires
school deans to fund pay increas
es for lecturers and instructors.
In the past, the money for those
raises has come from the same
funding pool as the raises and
salaries of other types of teach
ers.
Rebholz said that forcing
deans to budget for lecturers'
raises might lead to some lecturer
jobs being cut to gain extra funds.
In the Writing and Critical Think

ing (formerly Freshman English)
program, for example, Rebholz
said nine sections and 1.5 lecturer
slots would have to be cut to fund
the salary raises, increasing the
average number of students per
class from 18 to 19.
Provost Condoleezza Rice said
the change was made because she
could not keep inflating salary
budgets at the same rate, and this
was a method of "cost-sharing"
with the schools.
Rice stressed that the deans
must pay for raises for lecturers
and instructors; they cannot
choose not to raise their salaries.
She also stressed that she will
continue to fund the salaries of
lecturers and instructors at the
current level, since only pay
increases will have to be paid by
the deans. Deans can choose to
fund the increase any way they
want, including changing the way
teaching jobs are distributed, she
said.
The new system should pro
vide an incentive for deans to

"look at the redeployment of fac
ulty, in some departments, into
undergraduate teaching."
In funding the raises, Rice
said, she asked deans to be careful
not to harm teaching. If, as Reb
holz fears, teaching is significant
ly hurt by the move, she will con
sider other options, Rice said.
Casper addressed the senate,
discussing recent gifts to the Uni
versity. He said gifts have been
given "in all areas of the Universi
ty this year," including "major
commitments to the Green
Library construction" as well as
donations for the Stanford Art
Museum, the School of Engineer
ing, the Athletics Department
and graduate fellowships for
Asian students.
The senate also voted to revoke
a doctoral student's degree in
education which was granted in
1992 because of plagiarism, said
Registrar Roger Printup. The stu
dent apparently copied an entire
dissertation and deliberately falsi
fied data, Printup said.
