## Senate OKs conflict of interest policy 
### Andy Dworkin Colleen Krueger Staff writers 
After a lively and sometimes vicious debate, the
Faculty Senate voted yesterday to endorse a new
conflict of interest policy that sets guidelines for
faculty research, investments and outside consult
ing.
The final version of the Faculty Policy on Conflict
of Commitment and Conflict of Interest represents
more than two years of meetings and revisions by the
senate's Committee on Research.
"Of course I'm absolutely thrilled," said Biology
Prof. Craig Heller, who chairs the committee. "We've
worked so hard to develop a document that will place
Stanford in a good position for the future as far as
conflicts of interest are concerned."
Although it still must be accepted by the Universi
ty, the presence of a vocally supportive University
President Gerhard Casper at yesterday's meeting
suggests that the document will soon become Uni
versity policy.
While the policy eventually passed with only two
dissenting votes, it encountered intense opposition
by several senators.
As soon as the floor was opened to amendments,
Chemistry Prof. Dick Zare jumped up with a bold
proposal to temporarily remove the document's
highly-contested provisions regarding intellectual
property rights. Zare wanted to send that section
back to the committee or another comparable body
for further consideration.
