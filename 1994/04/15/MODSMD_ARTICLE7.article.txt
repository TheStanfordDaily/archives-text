# Stanford health system studied
## 3,000 employees surveyed on 'managed competition' 
### Shirley Park 
National policy-makers grappling with health care
reform may get some help from a study of the Univer
sity's new "managed competition" employee health
care plan.
Two Stanford researchers are trying to gain insights
into how people choose health care by examining Stan
ford's recently revamped health care system.
"[Stanford] is a good setting to look at what kind of
choices about health insurance people would make," said
Anne Beeson Royalty, assistant professor of economics,
who is conducting the research along with Neil Solomon,
a health policy researcher at the School of Medicine.
Royalty and Solomon sent out surveys to approxi
mately 3,000 randomly selected Stanford employees on
March 14. Tne 38-question survey asked employees
what led them to choose their current health care plan.
It also asked them to characterize their current plan, as
well as when and why they would switch to another one.
Royalty and Solomon hope to publish their findings
in medical and economic journals to "illuminate policy
makers so the debate ion health care) is grounded in
factual research, not knee-jerk reactions or assump
tions," according to Solomon.
In November 1993, to cut expenses, Stanford moved
from a more traditional fee-for-service insurance cov
erage to a new Triple Option plan.
The University now offers employees three Health
Maintenance Organization, or HMO, plans: Kaiser,
Take Care and Health Net. Kaiser's doctors work in the
same location, whereas physicians affiliated with Take
Care and Health Net are dispersed throughout differ-
ent clinics and hospitals.
Stanford's health care plan is
unique in offering a "point of ser
vice" component, which allows
clients to pursue physicians and ser
vices outside of the HMO by paying
extra
This new system of managed
competition, as well as the fact that
all three HMOs provide about the
same benefits, makes Stanford's

health care policy ideal for study,
according to Solomon. He added
that the option to choose services
outside the HMO is an aspect of
managed care that First Lady
Hillary Clinton has insisted be in
the national plan.
"The plans available to Stanford
employees look very much like the
plans that would exist if [the United
States] moved to a system of man
aged competition," Solomon said.
Solomon believes the results from
the study will help to shed a new per
spective on the national health care
debate. "Most of the debate in Wash

ington focuses on broad issues — it
doesn't look directly at how individu
als would like the system to be
changed," he said, speculating that
the team might in the future be
called upon by lawmakers for coun
sel on the health care issue.
In order to produce the surveys,
Royalty and Solomon first talked
with employees and formed on
campus focus groups where
employees discussed the different
health care plans. "Only when we
did that research did we feel we
could construct a survey reflecting
people's needs," Solomon said.
