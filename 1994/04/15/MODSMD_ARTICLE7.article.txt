National policy-makers grappling with health care
reform may get some help from a study of the Univer
sity's new "managed competition" employee health

into how people choose health care by examining Stan
ford's recently revamped health care system.
"[Stanford] is a good setting to look at what kind of
choices about health insurance people would make," said
Anne Beeson Royalty, assistant professor of economics,
who is conducting the research along with Neil Solomon,
a health policy researcher at the School of Medicine.
Royalty and Solomon sent out surveys to approxi
mately 3,000 randomly selected Stanford employees on
March 14. Tne 38-question survey asked employees
what led them to choose their current health care plan.
It also asked them to characterize their current plan, as
well as when and why they would switch to another one.
Royalty and Solomon hope to publish their findings
in medical and economic journals to "illuminate policy
makers so the debate ion health care) is grounded in
factual research, not knee-jerk reactions or assump
tions," according to Solomon.
In November 1993, to cut expenses, Stanford moved
from a more traditional fee-for-service insurance cov
erage to a new Triple Option plan.
The University now offers employees three Health
Maintenance Organization, or HMO, plans: Kaiser,
Take Care and Health Net. Kaiser's doctors work in the

Care and Health Net are dispersed throughout differ-
