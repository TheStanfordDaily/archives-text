In the midst of an ever-growing
public relations crisis, Provost Con
doleezza Rice held a private meeting
with Assoc. Vice Provost for Stu
dent Affairs Cecilia Burciaga late
yesterday afternoon for the first
time since the abrupt news that
Burciaga's position would be termi
nated in August.
The meeting drew the atten
tion of approximately 30 commu
nity members, most of them Chi
cano/Latino, who sat outside
Building 10 for the duration of the

20-minute meeting. The crowd re
mained subdued, and greeted
Burciaga with applause when she
emerged from Rice's office.
In an informal address to the
crowd, Burciaga — the highest
ranking Chicana administrator at
Stanford and a resident fellow at
Casa Zapata — told her support
ers that Rice called her yesterday
morning to schedule the meeting.
"The first thing Condi asked me
was, 'Cecilia, I've heard that you
feel hurt. Is that true?' " Burciaga
said. "I said, 'I feel dismissed.' "
