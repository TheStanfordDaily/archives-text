# Rice meets Burciaga, tries to 'clear the air'
## 
### Romesh Ratnesar Editorial staff 
In the midst of an ever-growing
public relations crisis, Provost Con
doleezza Rice held a private meeting
with Assoc. Vice Provost for Stu
dent Affairs Cecilia Burciaga late
yesterday afternoon for the first
time since the abrupt news that
Burciaga's position would be termi
nated in August.
The meeting drew the atten
tion of approximately 30 commu
nity members, most of them Chi
cano/Latino, who sat outside
Building 10 for the duration of the

20-minute meeting. The crowd re
mained subdued, and greeted
Burciaga with applause when she
emerged from Rice's office.
In an informal address to the
crowd, Burciaga — the highest
ranking Chicana administrator at
Stanford and a resident fellow at
Casa Zapata — told her support
ers that Rice called her yesterday
morning to schedule the meeting.
"The first thing Condi asked me
was, 'Cecilia, I've heard that you
feel hurt. Is that true?' " Burciaga
said. "I said, 'I feel dismissed.' "
Shortly after Burciaga exited
her office, Rice walked past the
small congregation without
acknowledging the crowd.
Rice declined to discuss the
details of the meeting, but later
called it "very civil," adding that
"I still have a great amount of
respect for Cecilia."
"It was really a private meet
ing between Cecilia and me — I

wanted to have the chance to talk
with her and clear some things
up," Rice said. "I had heard she
felt she had been treated badly,
and I wanted to discuss that with
her."
The firing of Burciaga, who has
been employed by the University
for 20 years, has been publicly crit
icized by students, administrators
and faculty, some questioning the
administration's handling of the
situation, others calling the deci
sion a direct attack on Stanford's
minority community. On April 1,
the day the firing was reported in

The Daily, about 40 students con
fronted University President Ger
hard Casper as he walked to his
office, protesting Burciaga's firing
and questioning his commitment
to multicultural issues.
Top administrators, including
Casper, Rice and Vice Provost and
Dean for Student Affairs Mary
Edmonds have maintained that
the layoff was a budgetary — and
not a political — decision. But the
issue has not lost its resonance,
receiving coverage by several local
news agencies including a seg
ment on KPIX-TV's newscast

Wednesday night.
Rice said yesterday's meeting
was "not scheduled in response to
anything in particular."
Burciaga told the gathering
yesterday that "This [meetingl is
only about trying to understand
my feelings. And it's too late."
The provost told Burciaga that
Rice's father had endured a
painful experience similar to the
one she is going through. "I feel
like your father did," Burciaga
said she responded.
Members of the gathering con
tended that Rice did not under

stand the delicacy of the situa
tion, and one referred to her
"blitzkrieg mentality — every
thing's top-down."
But Burciaga stressed, in a
farewell-like tone, that she "is not
devastated," and revealed that
she is actively pursuing positions
at other institutions.
"In the end, it's just my job,
not my soul," she said. She also
encouraged students to "always,
always speak the truth. I do
encourage you to sharpen your
skills — you have to know how to
talk firmly but indirectly. I think

I talk too directly."
Burciaga said she was not
aware the crowd, some of whom
were present before Rice or Bur
ciaga even arrived for the 5:45
meeting, had planned to show up.
"It felt very comforting," she
said.
Rice said she has not been sur
prised by the well-spring of sup
port for Burciaga. "Cecilia is a
very important person, important
to many communities," she said.
"I would expect this outpouring of
love, and outpouring of concern
for her."
