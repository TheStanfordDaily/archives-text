# When voters say no
## Student groups struggle with special-fee rejections 
### Jim Luh Staff writer 
In the aftermath of last week's ASSU
election, student groups left without
funding are struggling to understand
their special fees' rejection, planning for
next year and even talking about calling
for a new election.
Of 36 groups requesting special-fee
funding, 10 were voted down in Friday's
election. An additional eight groups were
approved by a majority of voters but will
not get funds because the number of
"yes" voters did not constitute 15 per

cent of the student population, as re
quired by the ASSU Bylaws.
One group, the Stanford American In
dian Organization, was incorrectly re
ported in Friday's Daily as not having
met the 15 percent requirement because
the ASSU's student population estimate
was higher than the official figure pro
vided by the Registrar's Office.
In addition, three groups whose spe
cial fees were in question Friday —
KZSU, the Sexual Assault Legal Advo
cates and the Stanford Safe Transporta
tion Program — will be funded.
Some groups are considering chal

lenging the election results, arguing that
the large number of abstentions on spe
cial-fee votes this year was due to the
complexity of the new UNIX voting sys
tem implemented this year.
According to that explanation, stu
dents tired of continuously typing in
their votes simply abstained from voting
on most groups — preventing student or
ganizations from reaching the required
15 percent mark.
Sophomore Miguel Green, academic
coordinator of the Black Student Union,
said the BSU is "thinking about
raising the issue lof the UNIX vot
ing system 1 publicly."
"There's been a lot of talk about
a re-vote," he said. "That's about
the extent of the action we want."
Whether the BSU will take an
active stance in calling for a new
election, however, depends on the
direction that the ASSU Senate
takes at Tuesday's meeting, Green
said.
"It's basically a watch and wait
situation," he added.
If the BSU is eventually forced
to operate without special-fee fund
ing, Green said, the organization
and groups that fall under its aegis
will be forced to trim programs and
find alternate sources of funding.
"The real resourcefulness of the
Stanford black community will cer
tainly show next year," Green said.
Junior Esther Conrad of Stu
dents for Environmental Action at
Stanford said that while her orga
nization had no definite plan of
action on the matter, SEAS is also
considering working with other
student groups to challenge the
election results.
"Whatever we do, if there is a
contestation of the election, it

won't be just SEAS by itself. It
would be a concentrated effort,"
she said.
But ASSU Elections Commis
sioner Tom Tsao said he did not
think the computer system unfair
ly skewed the results. "I ran a fair
election. To contest that would just
really make no sense to me," he
said.
Other groups are simply consid
ering ways to deal with the loss of
funds. Some organizations said
they will be forced to cut programs
entirely.
Stanford Axe Committee Chair
Craig Zajac said the loss of special
fee funding will most likely kill the
prospects for Big Game week pro
gramming.
"As of right now, there is no Big
Game week for the Axe Commit
tee," Zqjac said.
Junior Jason Colton said that
his organization, Coffeehouse
Live!, will not start up next year as
planned.
"Coffeehouse Live! will never
exist," he said. "It was created as a
special-fee organization because
the [Stanford] Concert Network
was unable to find corporate spon
sorship for a ... series of concerts
at the Coffee House."
But other groups said they will
cany on, though some programs
will have to be scaled down.
Junior Gabe Lucas of the Stan

ford Jazz Orchestra said the group's
basic operations will continue, but
the Jazz Orchestra will not be able
to sponsor other planned events
such as hosting performances by
famous jazz musicians.
"The money we asked for is
money we know we can't raise on
our own," Lucas said. "We are com
mitted to staying together. We can
raise money to do some things."
The Stanford Cardinal Broad
casting Network will probably sur
vive without its special fee, accord
ing to senior Mark Shalaby,
SCBN's financial manager.
"For the past two years, we've
been in the same situation. We've
dealt with it before through Pro
gram Board funds and some under
writing," Shalaby said.
SCBN is also considering
becoming independent of the Uni
versity, Shalaby said, although it
would have to overcome some legal
hurdles to achieve that status.
Junior Cathy Amirfar, co-chair
of the You Can Make a Difference
Conference, said the conference
will still take place, but other pro
gramming the organization spon
sors throughout the year may be
cut.
"We're just going to have to
reconcentrate our efforts," she
said, adding that the conference is
also seeking other sources of fund
ing for its events, including private

grants and donations.
REDWOOD may still be able to
put on first-year trips for entering
freshmen, according to sophomore
Nathan Gove, the group's acting
coordinator. But its members
would have to run the trips on a
volunteer rather than a salary
basis.
"That's sort of up in the air right
now," Gove said.
The Rape Education Project will
be able to continue some program
ming, according to treasurer
Matthew Mizel, but portions
of the project's budget will be cut.
"There probably will not be a
Rape Awareness Week," Mizel said.
In addition, he said that while the
project will still be able to publish
"Confronting Rape" next year,
publication two years from now will
depend on whether the project
receives special-fee funding next
year.
Mizel said the project is also
looking into the possibility of carry
ing funds from this year's special
fee over into next year, and mem
bers may have to "chip in our own"
money.
Some groups have not yet had
an opportunity to plan their
actions. "We really haven't had a
chance to come up with anything
yet," said senior Martha Cervantes,
a co-chair of MEChA, a
Chicano/Latino student group.
