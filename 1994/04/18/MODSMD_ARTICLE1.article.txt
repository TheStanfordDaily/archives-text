# When voters say no
## Student groups struggle with special-fee rejections 
### Jim Luh Staff writer 
In the aftermath of last week's ASSU
election, student groups left without
funding are struggling to understand
their special fees' rejection, planning for
next year and even talking about calling
for a new election.
Of 36 groups requesting special-fee
funding, 10 were voted down in Friday's
election. An additional eight groups were
approved by a majority of voters but will
not get funds because the number of
"yes" voters did not constitute 15 per

cent of the student population, as re
quired by the ASSU Bylaws.
One group, the Stanford American In
dian Organization, was incorrectly re
ported in Friday's Daily as not having
met the 15 percent requirement because
the ASSU's student population estimate
was higher than the official figure pro
vided by the Registrar's Office.
In addition, three groups whose spe
cial fees were in question Friday —
KZSU, the Sexual Assault Legal Advo
cates and the Stanford Safe Transporta
tion Program — will be funded.
Some groups are considering chal

lenging the election results, arguing that
the large number of abstentions on spe
cial-fee votes this year was due to the
complexity of the new UNIX voting sys
tem implemented this year.
According to that explanation, stu
dents tired of continuously typing in
their votes simply abstained from voting
on most groups — preventing student or
ganizations from reaching the required
15 percent mark.
