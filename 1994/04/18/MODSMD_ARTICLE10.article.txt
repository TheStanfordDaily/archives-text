# It's not easy 'Living Single'
## Alumna Lee talks on being a black producer in Hollywood 
### Emily Bazar Staff writer 
Writer-producer Yvette Denise Lee described her
experiences as a black female in the television indus
try during a speech Saturday night, urging talented
black students to enter the field.
"We [blacks] need to run our own studios and our
own networks," Lee said, adding that "Hollywood is
not America. It is a private industry and those who
own it have their way."
A 1987 Stanford graduate, Lee is the creator and
executive producer of the TV series "Living Single,"
which she calls an "honest, hip show about being
young, single and African-American in the '905."
"I've been labeled a phenomenal woman," said
Lee in the speech culminating Alpha Kappa
Alpha week. But she attributes her success to
being a "stubborn, opinionated woman who
works hard."
Lee, who owns Sister Lee Productions, is the first
black woman to create and produce a prime-time
television show. However, her sojourn in the world
of television has not been easy.
Lee began her career as an intern for Bill Cosby
and said she had to struggle with an industry that
does not understand African-Americans. She associ

ates the popularity of black IT shows to trends
because "being black and urban and hip is what's
'in' right now."
For black shows to become permanent elements
of the television industry rather than flourishing
only when fashionable, Lee said more African-
Americans must gain power and pervade the indus
try.
Lee challenged the audience, "If you have talent
and desire, don't just sit back and criticize. The
media needs you. We need to take control."
"Living Single," which airs on Fox at 8:30 p.m. on
Sundays, has been a ratings hit this season. Because
of its success, Fox wants to air 30 episodes next year.
Lee described "Living Single" as a series about
women who are black and have very strong opinions.
She said there is a part of her in each of the four
main female characters. However, she identifies best
with Khadijah, "who is very driven and very career
oriented."
"I've certainly been as bitter as Max," she said,
associating herself with another character on the
show. "My Stanford boyfriend made me Max."
Lee ended her speech with a word of encourage
ment for the audience, reminding them that "phe
nomenal people are not born. Either they're made
into phenomenal people or they make themselves."
