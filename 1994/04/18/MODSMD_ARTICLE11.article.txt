## Serb tanks enter Gorazde, 21 dead U.N. officials say an agreement has been reached to end the siege 
### 
SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina
(AP) — Serb tanks ground into Gorazde
yesterday, shortly after U.N. officials
announced an agreement had been
reached to end the siege of the long-suf
fering Muslim enclave.
In a sense, much of Gorazde had
already fallen to the Serbs though there
were pockets of resistance around town
yesterday, particularly at the hospital,
which remained in government hands
but under intense sniper fire. Elsewhere,
Serbian forces appeared free to move
about town.
Tens of thousands of Gorazde resi
dents, who have been under fire for most
of the two-year war, cowered in buildings
or huddled fearfully in a drenching rain
as the Serbs' tanks lumbered down the
streets yesterday.
Officials said 21 people had been killed

and at least 55 wounded by Serbs that
intensified in the afternoon and evening.
The casualty report could not be inde
pendently confirmed.
Later yesterday, a senior government
official in Gorazde told Sarajevo radio
that 10-12 tanks were moving toward
town from the direction of Ustipraca to
the east.
In New York, the U.N. Security Coun
cil began consultations last night on
Bosnia.
Taking de facto control of Gorazde, 35
miles southeast of Sarajevo, is a substan
tial victory for the Bosnian Serbs. It
allows them to improve the road links
between land they have captured from
Bosnian government forces to the east
and the south.
It also is another blow to efforts to end
the war by the world community, often

criticized as weak and unfocused Despite
Gorazde's designation as a protected
zone for Muslims last year by the United
Nations, the Serbs continued their siege
and were undeterred by NATO air mis
sions in the past two weeks.
"Before the eyes of the entire world, a
city is dying," declared Gorazde ham
radio operator Enes Musovic, monitored
by Bosnian radio.
Sylvana Foa, spokeswoman for the
Geneva-based U.N. High Commissioner
for Refugees, told of the fear and despair
at the building housing U.N. stall in
Gorazde.
"Shells and sniper fire are shaking the
building and it's suicidal to step outside,"
she said. "We're now up to about 30,000
panicking people who have moved into
the center of town. Our building is full of
people fleeing."
