Weapons ban lacks support
WASHINGTON (AP) — Supporters
of a ban on assault weapons are 15 to 20
votes short in the House of Representa
tives, a key congressman said yesterday.
In the latest head count by House
Democratic leaders, a bill banning
assault-style weapons such as Uzis and
AK-47s is shy of a majority, raising the
prospect of a major disagreement
between the House and Senate on anti
crime legislation.
"I find it very surprising with all the
mayhem going on in the streets," Rep.
Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said in an
interview yesterday."The House voted
against an assault weapons ban two
years ago, but a lot has changed since
then."
Schumer is chairman of the House

Judiciary subcommittee on crime and
leading sponsor of the assault weapons
ban.
Three dead in S. Africa
CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) — A
six-year-old boy and two other spectators
were crushed to death yesterday as
crowds rushed onto a soccer field during a
campaign rally featuring African National
Congress leader Nelson Mandela.
Twenty-one were hospitalized after
the accident at Athlone Stadium just
outside Cape Town, medical authorities
said.
The casualties occurred when, with the
bleachers full, organizers opened gates to
allow people to spill onto the field.
About 20,000 people had crowded into
the stadium for the rally.
