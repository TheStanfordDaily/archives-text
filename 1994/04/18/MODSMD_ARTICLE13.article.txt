## Editorial Special-fee faux pas ASSU Senate needs to apply clear criteria to decisions on budgets 
### 
THE SPECIAL-FEE process is
no longer special. The num
ber of groups applying for fees
is increasing every year, while at the
same time, students are more and
more apt to vote groups down or get
refund checks. The demand for
money seems to be increasing while
its supply is shrinking.
One way to help the system
return to equilibrium is to ensure
that every group needs all the money
it is requesting. Currently, there are
little or no checks of groups' bud
gets. The budgets groups present are
almost always the same ones that
appear on the ballots, regardless of
the budgets' contents.
Unlike the stringent process
employed by the Program Board
and the Community Service
Board, the application process for
special fees does not require
groups to fulfill set criteria to be
approved by the ASSU Senate and
placed on the Spring General Elec
tion ballot.
Often budget line items, which
most would agree should not be
funded by all students — such as
AASA's Winter Semi-Forma —
make it on the ballot. The result is
never a pleasant one. Either the
group's entire budget is rejected or
it is passed and students end up
with inflated fees.
A special fee request goes
through several „ckajwls before it;
appears on the ballot. First it is
approved by the Appropriations
Committee whose single criterion is
that the numbers on the budget for
each item reflect the actual cost,
according to committee member
Sanford Dickert. All the budgets are
then presented to the ASSU Senate.
The senate has the power to change
budget line items to the level it feels
is appropriate. Once the senate

approves all the budgets, these fig
ures are placed on the ballot.
Currently, none of these groups
acts as a discretionary body and
makes judgment calls on specific
items in groups' budgets. This has
led to bloated budgets. The senate
needs to develop a list of specific cri
teria and stick by them. That way,
students would have the comfort of
knowing that someone has put
thought and time into the budget
items appearing in the election
handbook.
Perhaps the Council of Presi
dents could undertake the responsi
bility of reforming the special-fee
process. This would allow a few peo
ple to seriously study the special-fee
process, find its faults and try to
amend them.
The COP should look to the Pro
gram Board and the Haas Center
for Public Service as good examples
of groups that disperse money wise
ly. Both of these groups have specif
ic criteria that student organiza
tions must fulfill in order to receive
funding.
Possible criteria are whether
students should be funding events
that are, in essence, for a small per
centage of the population; whether
the group has made an effort to
raise as much of its own money as
possible; and whether the group
benefits or serves all facets of the
population.
As it currently exists, the special
fee system will not survive for long
— something is going to break. Dur
ing the recent election, several
groups with noble causes but expen
sive budgets were denied their fees.
The, first step in improving the
system, should,be to reduce groups'
budgets to include items that stu
dents want, and should, be paying
for. The ASSU Senate must fill this
void. The Appropriations Commit
tee is too small to fill this role, and
there are too often individuals
looking out for special interests on
this committee. If ASSU senators
take their roles seriously and look
out for all students, the special-fee
system will be one step closer to
being fixed.
