## A 						trip to hockey heaven 
### 
THE SAN JOSE Sharks are in the
NHL playoffs. Now, normally a guy
from New York can't get excited
over any team from the West Coast, espe
cially in the "we-love-ourselves" Bay
Area. But I am a New York Rangers fan.
I can empathize with Sharks fans'
plight over the past two seasons. You see,
the Rangers haven't won a Stanley Cup
since 1940. And while the Sharks are a
very good hockey team, it may be 54 years
before they win their first Cup.
It's nice to see them do well. It's won
derful when something, that on the sur
face seems one way, surpasses all expecta
tions. That is exactly what the Sharks
have done.
A couple of months ago, two friends
(Greg and Debbie) and I decided to check
out this phenomenon-on-ice, Tonya
Harding notwithstanding. My mission
was two-fold: to compare this hockey
experience to the ones I've had at Ranger
games and to make sure we had fun away
from campus.
We arrived at the Shark Tank (a.k.a.
San Jose Arena) 15 minutes before game
time. Parking was a little tricky. We actu
ally created our own spot by moving
around some of those orange cones. A
very "New York" move, but we felt fine
doing it because if they were going to
screw us for 10 bucks to get in the lot,
damned if we were going to walk half-a
mile just to get inside.
Inside the place is a trip. The building

is beautiful. It has windows and — since
this was a day game — the sunlight was
great. The floors are squeaky clean and
there are all kinds of food and drink avail
able including several standard franchis
es, Gordon Biersch microbrews for $6
apiece, and coffee vendors that made the
ones from Seattle look like lemonade
stands. To me it is unsettling — no, down
right wrong — that you can get a mocha
at a hockey game.
As far as a hockey experience, it was
sort of a letdown. Everyone was friendly,
sportsmanship was high and no one got
into any fights — and I'm not just talking
about the players. Debbie and Greg actu
ally had a good time. Our seats were
great. We weren't close enough to "smell
the action," but we were high enough to
have a good view of the ice — essential for
pure hockey enjoyment.
Debbie and I sat on either side of Greg.
Sitting in the middle is great because you
have access to both your friends. The
opposite is true on an airplane. Needless
to say, Greg was happy.
End of the first period: Sharks 2, Cal
gary 0.
Time for the first pit-stop. Debbie got
the first round. I had a beer and a dog.
They both got dogs and split a glass of
wine. I was disappointed in their choice of
beverage at first, but who can honestly
say they've had wine at a hockey game?
Debbie helped Greg with the hot dog.
End of the second: Sharks 2, Calgary 1.

As hockey games head into the third
period, one tends to lose interest. But no
pucks came near us, the mascot didn't
come near us, hell, the beer guy never
even said "Hi." We were there with
friends away from school, though: the
perfect therapeutic device.
Final: Sharks 3, Calgary 2.
As the game ended, we weaved our way
through the exiting crowd, swerving and
dodging all of the other Sharks fans on
our way back to the car.
We got back to the car and Greg got in
first, as usual. I was going to drive home,
which wasn't all that strange. Greg usual
ly lets someone else drive.
This probably would have been
of another ordinary day except that my
friend Greg is in a wheelchair. And while
I wasn't doing him a favor by "taking"
him to the hockey game this day, it was
great to do something with him.
In June, he will graduate with a mas
ters in computer science, moving on to a
job at Microsoft. I am proud to call him
a good friend. It's wonderful when
something, that on the surface seems
one way, surpasses all expectations,
isn't it?

Jesfe applauds the San Jose Arena for its
attention to disabled-person access.
