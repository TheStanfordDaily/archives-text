## SHAC unfairly criticized in Daily recommendation 
### 
WE ARE WRITING out of shock
and incredulity at The Daily's rec
ommendation April 11 that stu
dents vote against the Stanford Homeless
ness Action Coalition's special fee request.
Though we agree with The Daily's senti
ment that homelessness is a pressing prob
lem concerning us all, the remainder of
their comments on SHAC are superficial,
incorrect or obscure the issues.
First, The Daily suggests that we work
with established community groups in
order to be cost-effective. Where The Daily
got the idea that we do not work with other
organizations is beyond us. Currently we
hold our community meetings for free in
the Peninsula Peace and Justice Center
and are a member of their organization.
We made the transition to the community
only with the help of the Urban Ministry of
Palo Alto. And we have worked with
numerous community organizations up
and down the Peninsula.
Second, The Daily argues that SHAC
does not address the issue of homelessness
in a cost-effective manner because our
speaker events typically draw only about

20 students. We would agree if campus
based speaker events were our only activi
ty. In fact, they are a very small percentage
of our budget.
Our community-based speaker events
which are open and available to students,
homeless people and community members
alike draw a much larger turnout. An
example would be our town meeting on
aggressive panhandling which was attend
ed by 50-100 people. We will continue to
serve a campus education function for stu
dents who are interested, but last year we
realized its ineffectiveness as a strategy for
ending homelessness on its own. That is
precisely why we significantly expanded
our activities this year.
Over the past eight months SHAC has
made a challenging but important decision
to do organizing and advocacy in addition
to educational events. This decision
involved moving our meetings to Palo Alto,
while opening them up to homeless people
themselves. We believed that it would be
more effective in that the people most
directly affected by social problems are
usually the people who work hardest to

transform their situations. Given this shift
in SHAC's work, and given that at present
there is no organization in Palo Alto focus
ing on organizing and advocacy on home
lessness issues, we would argue that we are
in fact extraordinarily cost-effective for the
job of being a full-fledged and critically
needed community organization.
Ultimately, The Daily suggests that our
community meetings themselves are a bad
idea or, in their staunchly conservative jar
gon, "not cost-effective." We resent that
implication. Such a rationale suggests that
we should exclude homeless people from
our organization because it is too "costly,"
thus violating their civil and human right
to participate in decisions and efforts that
affect them. But more importantly, it rein
forces one of the causes of homelessness,
namely that in a political system dominat
ed by money, poor and homeless people
have few opportunities to make their voice
heard in their demands for affordable
housing, living wages, jobs and health care.
Instead, The Daily would do well to
remember their own Feb. 24 editorial
which praised SHAC, saying "the group

tackles an issue that extends beyond the
Stanford community and spreads a proac
tive sentiment to other student groups." In
their talk of cost-effectiveness, this new
Daily ultimately suggests that SHAC
retreat to campus and academic theorizing
about homelessness, divorcing theory from
action and excluding the very people we are
trying to help. But as The Daily wrote on
Feb. 24 about our efforts: "While fighting
homelessness is no easy battle, it's better
than fighting the homeless." We heartily
agree.
SHAC lost its special fee in the election
last week, and we hold The Daily partially
responsible. Unfortunately, the short
sightedness and inaccuracy of The Daily is
moot because the Stanford student body
has failed to recognize the value of our
effort.
