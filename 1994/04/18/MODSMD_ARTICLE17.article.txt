# President Aristide on campus is a reminder to support democracy
## 
### 
Jean-Bert rand Aristide, the exiled presi
dent of Haiti, will speak at Stanford
tonight.
Aristide was elected by a landslide
majority of 67 percent in December, 1990,
in the first democratic election in Haiti's
200-year history. During the brief seven
month interlude of democracy before the
military coup, Aristide supporters engaged
in simple acts of citizenship that once
would have prompted murderous retribu
tion from military thugß — cleaning their
streets, posting pictures of Aristide on
their doors, and holding public meetings.

With the coup in September, 1991, the
military reinstated a brutal and systematic
campaign designed to crush popular sup
port of Aristide. In choosing Aristide,
Haitians chose change — an end to the
terror, an increase in the minimum wage
of 35 cents per hour, a chance for real rep
resentation. In choosing Aristide, Haitians
chose democracy. But democracy, it seems,
has not chosen them.
In a polity begun by President Bush
and continued by President Clinton
despite his earlier condemnation of the
policy as "cruel" and "illegal," the U.S.
Coast Guard intercepts Haitians attempt
ing to leave Haiti by sea and forcibly
returns them to Haiti where they are fin
gerprinted and photographed by military
officers. In recent weeks, soldiers have
beaten returning refugees on the landing
docks in the presence of Coast Guard offi

rials (The New York Times, April 2).
Aristide has now been in exile for 2-1/2
years. Aristide supporters continue to face
arbitrary arrests, torture and summary
execution. Under the leadership of General
Raoul C&lras, the military has repeatedly
failed to honor deadlines set for the return
of Aristide.
In recent days, many have joined in
criticism of the Clinton administration's
Haitian policy, including human rights
groups, the Congressional Black Caucus
and prominent Democrats in Congress.
They are calling upon the administration
to tighten its largely ineffective embargo
on Haiti, through which foreign oil and
military supplies have continued to flow.
They are also demanding that the admin
istration repeal its inhuman policy of
repatriating Haitian refugees to a mur
derous regime. They are asking the

administration to cease wringing ever
more concessions from Aristide (including
the granting of amnesty to the military
leaders who depose him) without offering
any concrete support to the exiled presi
dent or any credible commitments to his
return.
Finally, they are asking the Clinton
administration to treat Aristide with the
dignity he deserves as the elected repre
sentative of those whose voices we ignore
and in whose bloody silencing we as a
nation are complicit. At pro-democracy ral
lies in Haiti, the people shout, "Together,
together, we are strong. Together we are
the flood." As a nation dedicated to democ
racy, we should not let the Haitians stand
alone in their struggle against tyranny.
