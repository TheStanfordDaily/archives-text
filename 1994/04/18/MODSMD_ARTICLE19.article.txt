# New educational philosophy needed, not F

### 
Reinstating the 112 grade is supposed
to return Stanford to the days when stu
dents were brave enough to compete. It
was a time when sparks of inspiration encour
aged the enthusiasm of students to combine
with the experience of faculty.
While this may be the ideal, the F alone is not
going to help us realize it. In fact, bringing back
the F grade will only lead us further away from
the educational goals of this institution.

Grades are merely tools that can motivate
students, communicate the educational goals
of the class and record progress. When consid
ering any kind of grading policy change, we
need to ask how that change will affect the
educational environment between students
and faculty.
I remember reading in "Approaching Stan
ford" that if a parent called Stanford to ask for
her student's grades, Stanford would politely
inform her to talk to her son or daughter. I men
tion this because it was my first taste of Stan
ford's policy of individual responsibility.
This school promotes the idea that students
are responsible for making their own education
al decisions while learning from their mistakes
and successes. This kind of policy does not force
people to approach education or grades in any
specific way. If grades are the absolute measure
of success for you, so be it. But if the actual expe
rience of taking a class teaches you all you need
to know, well, that is fine by Stanford too.
While Stanford's philosophy gives students

the latitude to formulate their own approach
toward grades, it unfortunately lacks any guid
ing principles professors can use when assigning
grades. The result is a widely varying "good"
each grading scheme tries to achieve. Some tiy
to achieve fairness, others try to recognize indi
vidual growth and still others try to give stu
dents incentives to do more.
But bringing back the F will not unify grad
ing schemes. Grading schemes depend on how
professors understand the goals of their courses
and how they evaluate students. Did students
learn how to write a research paper in Fresh
man English? Have they applied the topics cov
ered in the course in their work? Have they mas
tered the skills that the course teaches?
If the goals of the course are well defined,
then the professor will have a solid foundation
on which to grade students. Some professors fail
to set down clear course goals — when this hap
pens, grading becomes much more difficult.
All of the dialogue about grades eventually
appearing on an official transcript ignores one
crucial thing: the course goals should be commu
nicated to the student during the course. Learn
ing is a process. A grade at the end of the quarter
serves mainly as external reinforcement for the
learning that has already taken place.
Getting an A at the end of the quarter does
not motivate students because it goes on the offi
cial transcript. Instead, it is the professor's way
of communicating to students that they have
done outstanding work. Students should be
mature enough to know the quality of the work
they have done already. However, it is still
extremely important to have someone else, an
expert in that subject, confirm your opinion
about your work.

End-quarter grades do record students'
progress through their time at Stanford. Stu
dents are expected to manage this progress.
They often use grades to decide if they need to
retake a course. Under the current transcript
system, a student who re-took a course and
received a higher grade would overwrite an F or
any other grade.
If the University made the F a permanent
mark on the record, it would only encourage peo
ple to drop courses they expected to fail. This sys
tem does not offer any incentive for students to
improve and often leads to students staying extra
quarters to make up time lost by dropped classes.
By adding an F to the existing system without
changing it as a whole, students will only lose.
Instead of simply bringing back the F, why
don't we adopt a system of incentives that is a

embedded in a well-defined educational philos
ophy? The philosophy should make certain

that students leave Stanford open-minded

and able to teach themselves beyond the

Farm. A Stanford education should be

more than the sum of the courses
taken here. Bringing back the F is

not as important as helping stu
dents mature to the point that
they can overcome failure. That j
way, a transcript is simply a .
piece of paper you can use to sell (
yourself to grad schools or
employers, but every Stanford

graduate will be guaranteed a set

of skills worth the $100,000

price tag.
