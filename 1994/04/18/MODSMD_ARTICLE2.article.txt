# Packing them in
## Budget ax means more students per CIV section 
### Bobby Chen 
Discussion section size will in
crease by an average of one stu
dent when the Cultures, Ideas and
Values Program loses a lecturer
next year, according to the pro
gram's new budget.
Provost Condoleezza Rice in
formed the Dean of Humanities and
Sciences two weeks ago that the
budget for all lecturers in the school
will remain at the 1993-94 level,
with no salary increases, CIV Pro
gram Director Paul Seaver said.
To raise all instructors' salaries
by about 2 percent, Seaver said the
dean's office created a new budget
that eliminates a position from the
CIV program.
The direct result of this reduc
tion in lecturers, Seaver said,
would be an increase in the aver
age number of students per discus
sion section. Assuming that the
number of freshmen and transfers
matriculating in September will
be about the same as this year's,
every discussion section will in
crease from 17.8 to 18.6 students.
Seaver expressed concern as to
how the increase in the number of
students enrolled in each discus
sion section would affect the qual
ity of teaching.
"These larger discussion sec
tions, some of which will be over 20
students in number, will be unfair
not only to freshmen but also to
instructors as a result of the
increased amount of work in the
same amount of time," he said.
The CIV program decided to
eliminate the lecturer position from
the History CIV track because of
three lecturers in the track who will
leave at the end of this quarter,
Seaver said. Only two of the vacat
ed positions will be filled.
Great Works and Humanities,
the other two large CIV tracks,
were also considered for the cut.
However, since no openings exist in
those tracks, eliminating the lec
turer position would entail firing
one of the present instructors. "We
weren't going to fire anybody if it
was possible," Seaver said.
History Department chair David
Kennedy maintained that "any stu
dent in History CIV will never know
the difference," adding that approx
imately 70 fewer students will be
enrolled in the track next year.
Those students would be dis
tributed evenly across the other
tracks and discussion sections of
the CIV program, increasing their
numbers marginally.

Kennedy said he believes that
the reduction in History lecturers
will be temporary due to the effi
ciency of History CIV, both in
terms of cost effectiveness and
individual attention to the stu
dents. "We've done a first-rate job
over the years," he said.
Seaver said the CIV program
plans to reinstate the History lec
turer position by the 1995-96
school year. Ideally, an increase in
budget would allow the program to
restore the position without any
further effects.
However, he said that if the
provost does not increase the bud
get to the School of Humanities
and Sciences, the additional lectur
er would be reinstated anyway.
Seaver said several lecturers will
be leaving the Great Works track
for other positions at the end of
next year, and they could restore
History ClV's lecturer by eliminat
ing one position from Great Works
at that time.
Freshman Howard Loo, a Histo
ry CIV student, said he considers
individual attention to be one of the
most important aspects of his dis
cussion section and that more stu
dents would reduce this attention.
"Section leaders would have less
time to devote to each student —
not only during the group discus
sion but in one-to-one meetings
about papers as well," he said.
