# Student rights as 'research participants'
## 
### 
THE LAST 25 years have seen great
progress in protecting the rights of
research participants. Their risks must
now be minimized, and they sign an agreement
stipulating that they "... have the right to dis
continue participation at any time without
penalty."
The present grading system at Stanford cor
rectly treats students like research partici
pants.

With the present NC (No Credit) grading
option, students incur minimal risk and have the
right to discontinue their course participation
without serious penalty. However, if F grades
are re-instituted and drop deadlines enforced,
student rights will be seriously compromised.
While the intent may differ, a course resem
bles an informal research study. The instruc
tors (researchers) want to test the hypothesis
that their class activities and reading assign
ments (experimental interventions) will enable
this year's students (research participants) to
master the material better than last year's stu
dents (control group). To assess outcomes they

administer quizzes and exams (quantitative
measures), assign term papers (qualitative
measures) and distribute anonymous course
rating forms (subjective measures).
An F-grade policy will expose students to
an additional risk that they have not had for
the past 25 years. If their performance is
judged unsatisfactory (one person is the jury
and judge), an F grade could be entered on
their transcripts, permanently damaging
their future educational and career opportu
nities.
We need to ask whether this risk is neces
sary. What is gained by adding F grades? Cer
tainly we don't want Stanford to certify that
people have mastered some material if they
haven't, but the NC grade solves that problem
beautifully. The student receives no credit but
is not stigmatized for life. An F grade, however,
clearly subjects students to an additional risk.
For what reason? Maintaining a historically
accurate record? NC grades are perfectly accu
rate â€” students who learn nothing have noth
ing recorded.
Research participants are allowed to with
draw their participation at any time without
penalty. Students should be entitled to this
same right. An F grade is a severe penalty.

Restricting the right of stu
dents to withdraw their
participation would be as
inhumane to students as it
used to be for research par
ticipants.

Requiring students to '
continue a course against I
their will when they already
know they are destined to fail
is completely unproductive.
Besides stigmatizing them
with an F grade which follows
them for the rest of their lives,
students are charged full
tuition for the privilege of
being treated this way. That
kind of policy clearly violates
the standards of justice and
decency we now willingly
grant to research partici
pants.
Let's think this issue
through carefully together
before we rush to judgment. |
