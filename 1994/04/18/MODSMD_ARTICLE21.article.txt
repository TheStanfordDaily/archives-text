GRADES PROVIDE stu
dents with feedback on
the degree of mastery of a
given body of knowledge. This
information is important for stu
dents' decisions about selection
of subsequent courses, fields of
study and careers.
A second purpose of grades is
to provide one means of evaluat
ing student training and exper
tise in given subjects and overall
academic accomplishments. The
academic record serves as a criti
cal and valued evaluative element
in obtaining jobs and admission
to graduate and professional
schools.

A third purpose of grades is to
make sure the rewards of a
meaningful system provide real
incentives to students for strong
academic effort. While there are
doubtless many other purposes
of a system of academic
appraisal, these three provide
ample background against which
we can ask if our current system
meets these objectives.
Given the changes in the
Stanford grading system that
took place in 1970, it is not sur
prising that we have evolved a
system that meets none of the
three central objectives of an
appraisal system.
Currently nearly 50 percent
of the letter grades awarded are
A's and 40 percent are B's.
There are undoubtedly courses
where this distribution of grades
may accurately reflect student
accomplishment — that is, 50
percent of the students actually
gave "exceptional performance"
and 40 percent gave "superior
performance."
But it is my experience, influ
enced heavily by teaching a
large, required introductory
course, that this grade distribu
tion does not generally reflect
the range of student achieve
ment.
Some will ask, "What's the
problem? Simoni can give any
grade he likes so that perfor
mance is actually reflected in the
grades given in his class."
The problem is that the over
all system of grading and prac
tice have led to a culture in
which anything less than a B is
considered failure,
the C grade

I has been
devalued
into disuse

and the dre
aded D has

become the rea
son to ask for a fail-

ing grade. The sys
tem, in its current

form, is neither a
relative or absolute

standard of aca
demic achievement.

What are the
solutions? Several
years ago the D

was reinstated in
the hope that it

would make the
C more respect-

able. This effort
has failed, primarily
because the evolu
tion of grading

practice had
already gone too
far.

| It is my feeling
that in spite of
this, expanding
the letter grade

options to include
an "indelible F"
coupled with

change in the sys
tem of adminis
tration, discussed

112 below, will go a
long way toward
returning some
value to our grad
ing system.

7 As the range of
grades expands, our
best students, those
least well served by our
current system, will
once again receive the
recognition that "excep
tional performance"
deserves.

Along with expand
ing the grade options
to include the "indeli
ble F," drastic changes
must be made in the
administration of
grades. The current
policy of having NC (No
Credit) within the let-

ter grade system vanish from
the official record does not
serve the central purposes of a
grading system.
The academic record should
honestly report all levels of
accomplishment. The current
system of the "vanishing NC"
provides a disincentive to aca
demic effort and an all-too-easy
option to bail out when things
get tough rather than to redou
ble one's effort.
Some argue that the "indelible
F" will haunt students forever as
a debilitating blemish. As one
who has survived a well-deserved
F (it apparently went undetected
as I interviewed for my job at
Stanford), I can promise that the
consequences are not nearly so
dire as some predict.
On the other hand, the incen
tives provided to students by the
certainty that a poor grade will be
recorded are powerful and good.
As unreasonable as the "van
ishing NC" is, the current course
retake policy is worse. In my
judgment, it borders on dishon
est to remove a course grade in
favor of a grade earned as a
retake.
Should not an evaluator know
that although John got an A in
Biology 31, he took it twice? Is it

The academic record
should honestly
report all levels of
accomplishment.
The current system of
the 'vanishing NC'
provides a disincen
tive to academic
effort and an all-too
easy option to bail
out whterithings

redouble one's effort.

fair to Joan who also got an A in
this excellent and extremely pop
ular course but only took it once?
In addition to yielding a
deceptive academic record, the
retake policy also provides an
alternative to sustained effort.
There is the misperception by
some students and advisors that
a C on a transcript has career
threatening consequences. I can
promise that it does not.
Furthermore, time, money
and effort in retaking a course
are really wasted for both stu
dents and faculty.
While there is no place for the
"vanishing NC" within the letter
grade system, there is one argu
ment in favor of retaining the
Pass/NC option of the current
system that I find persuasive
even in the absence of any data.
Some claim that the "vanish
ing NC" allows students to be
more adventuresome in their
choice of courses since there is
no lasting consequence of fail
ure. On the off-chance this is
true, I would support the reten
tion of the current Pass/NC
grading option.
In summary, I propose the fol
lowing:
• The full range of letter
grades be available, A-F.
• All letter grades earned
appear permanently on the tran
script.
• The current Pass/NC option
be retained as an instructor and
student option and that NC
grades not be recorded.
• For courses retaken, the sec
ond grade be recorded along with
the first.
• The drop option be moved to
four weeks into the quarter.
• Some drop designation
should be available for medical
or other approved reasons.
These changes, I feel, will
restore evaluative meaning to
our academic appraisal system.
The extraordinary students
who come to Stanford need to
know that we expect a great deal
from them and that exceptional
performance will once again be
rewarded with a meaningful A.
