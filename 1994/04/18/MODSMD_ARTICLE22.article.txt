Put those brooms away.
After taking the first two games of a weekend set
with the California Golden Bears, the Cardinal base
ball team fell one game shy of sweeping the season
series with its archrival yesterday in a narrow 4-3
defeat at Evans Diamond in Berkeley.
However, with a 5-3 victoiy Friday at Evans and a
4-3 win Saturday at Sunken Diamond, Stanford (26-

Nate Olmstead started the attack, scoring junior sec
ond baseman Jed Hansen with a double to the left
center field gap. Sophomore leftfielder Steve Carver
and sophomore rightfielder Brodie Van Wagenen sus

squeeze bunt, respectively.
But the Golden Bears capitalized on Reed's wild
ness in the bottom of the fifth, using two walks, a wild
pitch and a two-out single by freshman second base
man Dan Cey to plate two runs and close to within one.
The Cardinal immediately rose to the challenge,
however, as Hinch beat out an infield single to lead off
the sixth. With one out, junior first baseman Dusty
Allen laced a double down the left field line to score
Hinch. Van Wagenen followed with an inside-out sin-
