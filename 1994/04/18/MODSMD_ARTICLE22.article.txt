## Baseball paws 2 of 3 from Golden Bears Cardinal half game from USC in Six-Pac runnings 
### Andy Eiser Senior staff writer 
Put those brooms away.
After taking the first two games of a weekend set
with the California Golden Bears, the Cardinal base
ball team fell one game shy of sweeping the season
series with its archrival yesterday in a narrow 4-3
defeat at Evans Diamond in Berkeley.
However, with a 5-3 victoiy Friday at Evans and a
4-3 win Saturday at Sunken Diamond, Stanford (26-
16, 14-7 in the Pacific 10 Conference Southern Divi
sion) remains one-half game behind conference-lead
ing USC. Ironically, the Trojans allowed the Cardinal
to take sole possession of second-place by dealing a
pair of losses to Arizona State in Los Angeles. The Sun
Devils now stand one-and-a-half games out of first in
a tight, three-way Six-Pac race.
Picking up where it had left off two weeks earlier
in a three-game sweep of the Golden Bears (20-28, 9-
12), Stanford staked an early lead Friday and rode an
outstanding pitching performance by sophomore Dan
Reed (8-2) to hold on for the win.
After Reed and Golden Bears freshman starter
Keith Evans (3-6) faced just 10 batters apiece through
three innings, the Cardinal broke the scoring seal
with three runs in the fourth. Senior designated hitter
Nate Olmstead started the attack, scoring junior sec
ond baseman Jed Hansen with a double to the left
center field gap. Sophomore leftfielder Steve Carver
and sophomore rightfielder Brodie Van Wagenen sus
tained the rally with RBI on an infield single and
squeeze bunt, respectively.
But the Golden Bears capitalized on Reed's wild
ness in the bottom of the fifth, using two walks, a wild
pitch and a two-out single by freshman second base
man Dan Cey to plate two runs and close to within one.
The Cardinal immediately rose to the challenge,
however, as Hinch beat out an infield single to lead off
the sixth. With one out, junior first baseman Dusty
Allen laced a double down the left field line to score
Hinch. Van Wagenen followed with an inside-out sin-
gle down the right-field line to drive
in Allen as Stanford regained its
three-run advantage.
"They scored and took away our
momentum, so when I saw a chance
to pull, I wanted to make solid con
tact," Allen said. "It ended up being
the turning point of the game."
With renewed run support, Reed
went three more innings, surren
dering only a seventh-inning solo
home run to Cal junior designated
hitter Ricky Spears. Freshman Tom
Reimers then pitched a scoreless
ninth for his sixth save.
"That's the story of my season. I
didn't necessarily have my best
stuff', but the team picked me up,"
Reed said.
Sophomore Todd Bartels started
with his best stuff' for the Cardinal
Saturday, but failed to pick up a
decision for his efforts. Buoyed by
single Stanford runs in each of the
first three frames, Bartels faced just
three batters over the minimum
through six innings.
But a two-run home run by
Golden Bear junior catcher Justin
Stark in the fiffh and three shutout
relief innings by junior Mike Wolger
left Cal down by just one as Bartels
took the mound for the seventh.
Three singles later, the Golden
Bears evened things at 3-3. Bartels

induced a double-play grounder by
junior centerfielder Eddie
Comeaux, but with Stark due up
next, was pulled in favor of junior
Matt Marenghi. The game's biggest
showdown then went the Cardinal's
way, thanks to a run-saving, over
the-shoulder basket catch by
Hansen between three converging
fielders in shallow right field.
"When the ball was hit, I wasn't
sure anyone could get to it, but it
hung up in the air just long
enough," Hansen said. "I figured
someone had to catch it, so I called
everyone off."
Like the previous day, Stanford
responded immediately to Cal's
challenge. With one out in the bot
tom of the seventh, Hinch again
beat out an infield hit. Olmstead
singled Hinch to third, and Allen
provided the game-winning RBI for
the second-straight day with a sacri
fice fly to center. Marenghi (1-2) fin
ished the game for his first victory
of the season, while Wolger (0-3)
remained winless on the year.
The Cardinal's spell over its
archrival wore off yesterday, howev
er, as an interesting pitching strate
gy by Cal head coach Bob Milano
made a first-inning three-run home
run by junior first baseman Andy
Tarpley stand up.
Milano, honored before the con
test as the all-time winningest coach
in Golden Bears history, started
junior reliever Alex Franklin, who
retired eight of nine Stanford bat

ters and gave way to senior Bobby
Kahlon, ordinarily Cal's closer, in
the third. In his longest appearance
of the season, Kahlon (6-7) went the
final 6-1/3 innings for the victory.
"I'd rather beat (Stanford) than
anyone else, but our lack of pitching
depth meant we had to get a lot out
of Kahlon," Milano said.
The Cardinal got on the board
with a run in the sixth, but the
Golden Bears tacked on an impor
tant insurance run to make it 4-1 in
the seventh. Freshman shortstop

Eric Sees led off the Stanford eighth
with a towering home run to left,
and while the Cardinal plated a run
in the ninth to make it close, it could
not take freshman starter Jason
Middlebrook (5-1) off the hook for
his first career loss.
Even if his first Six-Pac home
run did not produce a win, Sees put
the game in perspective for Stan
ford and its potential broom-wield
ing fans. "I'm disappointed, but you
can never be too disappointed after
winning two of three," Sees said.
