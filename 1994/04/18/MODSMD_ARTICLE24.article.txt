Doing exactly what it takes to win.
That's what the Stanford baseball team
accomplished this weekend, taking two of
three from the Golden Bears and pulling
within a half game of front-running USC
in the Pacific 10 Conference Southern
Division standings.
Aggressive baserunning and constant

pressure on Cal's pitching staff helped
Stanford offset a lack of run production
during the series. In addition, the Cardinal
was flawless with the glove, committing no
errors and turning in several dazzling
defensive plays to snuff out Cal rallies.
"That's one of the things our coaching
staff emphasizes," said junior second base
man Jed Hansen. "They want us to stay
focused on defense, because a lot of times
if we're not hitting well we can usually

stay in the games with defense and pitch
ing. That's what has been consistent for
us game in and game out."
Stanford also showed an excellent abil
ity to bounce back whenever the Golden
Bears mounted a rally, with timely hitting
to produce crucial runs and outstanding
relief pitching.
