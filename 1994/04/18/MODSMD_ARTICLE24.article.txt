# Efficient offense, consistent pitching keys for Cardinal

Doing exactly what it takes to win.
That's what the Stanford baseball team
accomplished this weekend, taking two of
three from the Golden Bears and pulling
within a half game of front-running USC
in the Pacific 10 Conference Southern
Division standings.
Aggressive baserunning and constant

pressure on Cal's pitching staff helped
Stanford offset a lack of run production
during the series. In addition, the Cardinal
was flawless with the glove, committing no
errors and turning in several dazzling
defensive plays to snuff out Cal rallies.
"That's one of the things our coaching
staff emphasizes," said junior second base
man Jed Hansen. "They want us to stay
focused on defense, because a lot of times
if we're not hitting well we can usually

stay in the games with defense and pitch
ing. That's what has been consistent for
us game in and game out."
Stanford also showed an excellent abil
ity to bounce back whenever the Golden
Bears mounted a rally, with timely hitting
to produce crucial runs and outstanding
relief pitching.

Junior first baseman Dusty Allen readies for the tag en route to the Cardinal's 4-3 victory over Cal on Saturday .
Stanford leading 3-0, Cal scored
two runs in the bottom of the fifth
inning to cut the Cardinal's lead to
3-2.
But Stanford responded in the
top of the sixth with junior first
baseman Dusty Allen ripping an
RBI double down the left field line
and sophomore right fielder Brodie
Van Wagenen following with an
RBI single.
The Golden Bears were unable
to get any closer as starter Dan
Reed stiffened up and freshman
relief ace Tom Reimers slammed
the door shut by pitching a perfect
ninth inning.
"The ability to score after the
other team scores is a big plus,"
Allen said. "It's a game of momen
tum, and the way to get momen
tum is scoring runs. To be able to
score right after the other team
scores slows their momentum
down and shifts it a little bit."
Allen turned in another clutch
performance in Saturday's game at
Sunken Diamond. After a Golden

Bear rally tied the score at three in
the top of the seventh, the Cardinal
once again bounced back in the bot
tom of the inning.
This time, Allen fought off a
tough pitch from Cal's ace reliever
Bobby Kahlon and hit a sacrifice fly
to score sophomore catcher A.J.
Hinch and give the Cardinal a 4-3
lead.
"Kahlon was trying to strike
him out and trying to strand the
runner on third, and Dusty won
that battle, so that's a credit to
Dusty since it's tough to get a hit
off Kahlon," said Cardinal coach
Mark Marquess. "He's one of the
best relievers in college baseball."
Once again, the Cardinal pitch
ing staff turned in a dominant per
formance. During the weekend,
Stanford relievers only surren
dered four hits and one earned run
in 6-1/3 innings. Overall, the Cardi
nal allowed only nine runs and 20
hits in three games.
"Our pitching staff has done a
great job of keeping us in just about
every ball game," Allen said.
"They've been consistent all year
long, and they're the sole reason
why we are where we are right
now."
