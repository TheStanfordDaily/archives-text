# Men split down south
## Tennis narrowly succumbs to Trojans for 2nd loss, rebounds against UCLA 
### Mike Langford Senior staff writer 
It was a tall order, one that has been
filled only once in 28 years. A weekend
sweep in Southern California most like
ly would have vaulted the men's tennis
team back to the position it occupied for
much of the season — No. 1 in the
nation.
As it turned out, the order was a bit
too tall. The second-ranked Cardinal
beat No. 12 UCLA 4-3 but fell 3-4 to top
ranked USC on a road trip which Stan
ford has swept only once in head coach

Dick Gould's 28-year tenure. It was the
Cardinal's second loss to the Trojans,
who have dealt Stanford its only defeats
of the season.
"Overall, it was a good weekend for
us," Gould said. "You don't like to lose,
but we competed well, and that's the
important thing at this point."
Friday's match against archrival
USC proved as close and competitive as
ever. Two weeks ago, Stanford lost all
three doubles matches to the Trojans.
While Stanford's top team of seniors
Michael Flanagan and Chris Cocotos did
manage to turn the tables and beat

USC's Wayne Black and Jon Leach, the
Cardinal's second and third doubles
teams fell to their Trojan opponents,
giving USC the initial doubles point.
USC went on to win three quick sin
gles matches, securing the necessary
four points to clinch the match. At first
singles, the No. 3-ranked Flanagan suc
cumbed quickly to the No. 2-ranked
Black, losing 6-3, 6-3. Devens' troubles
against the Trojans continued in a 6-4,
6-3 loss to Brett Hansen. Cocotos
dropped straight sets at fifth singles.
"The first three went very quickly,"
Gould said. "But then we got three good

wins. They were hard earned, but the
guys played tough and did a real nice
job."
Even with the match decided, the
remaining Stanford players refused to
lose. Three Stanford sophomores
showed USC what it can expect to face
for the next two years as all three beat
their opponents in three sets.
Jeff Salzenstein came back after los
ing the first set to defeat the No. 14-
ranked Leach for the second time this
year, 4-6, 6-2, 6-3. Jim Thomas,
recently promoted to the fourth
spot in singles, and Ricky Becker,
playing for an ailing Vimal Patel at
sixth singles, both won their
matches as well.
"We did a pretty good job split
ting singles again," Gould said.
"Now we just have to figure out
how to win doubles."
Cardinal doubles didn't fare any
better against Canadians
Robert Janecek and Sebastien
paired up for the first time
this year to down Flanagan-Coco
tos by a score of 8-5. Salzenstein
and partner Patel were dominated
by a Bruin freshmen duo, with the
latter pair winning 8-2. Third dou
bles came the closest to
Although the team of Devens and
freshman Grant Elliott never lost
their serve, the two were unable to
hold onto an advantage in the tie
breaker and lost 9-8.
With UCLA taking the doubles
point, Stanford faced the
formidable task of winning four of
the six singles matches. And that's
exactly what it did. Although the
middle of the Cardinal singles line
up appeared weak when the Bruins
visited the Farm, that was not the
case on Saturday. Salzenstein,
Devens, Thomas and Cocotos all
won their contests in straight sets.
As in their match two weeks
ago, Flanagan captured a set
against the No. 5-ranked Janecek,
but the Bruin fought back for the
6-3, 3-6, 7-5 win. Stanford's other
loss came at sixth singles, where
Patel gave up the advantage to lose
to Sergio Rico, 6-3, 3-6, 6-7.
However, Gould emphasized the
importance of the Cardinal's never
say-die attitude over the weekend.
"The team was behind both
times, and kept rising up," Gould
said. "That's a mark of a really good
team. It will carry you a long way."
