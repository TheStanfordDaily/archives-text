# Men's golf grilled by Arizona heat, finishes 10th

The Stanford men's golf team finally ran into an
opponent with which it simply could not compete last
weekend. But that foe turned out to be the brutal
desert heat of Arizona, and not the highly ranked
squads which played at the Karsten Golf Course in
Tempe, Ariz.
Plagued by severe dehydration in near 100-degree
weather, the No. 2-ranked Cardinal put together its
worst tournament to date â€” a lOth-place finish in the
15-team field Thunderbird Invitational. The disap
pointing performance broke a string of two consecu
tive tournament victories for the Stanford linksters.
"We lost all our strength and mental focus," said
coach Wally Goodwin. "Those were some tough condi
tions that we're just not used to and I think our worst
mistake was to lose track of the hydration factor."
After opening up with a three-under par first

round, Stanford faltered badly, finishing the tourna
ment 16 strokes above par as a team. Not one Stanford
linkster was able to shoot par for the tournament.
Senior Brad Lanning led the Cardinal with a solid
one-over par 217 and Steve Burdick, a junior, con
tributed a score of 219. However, three of Stanford's
best golfers, Casey Martin, Notah Begay 111 and
William Yanigisawa, all had disappointing tourna
ments, fmishing well above par.
"We don't want to make excuses," Burdick said.
"The weather was tough but I don't think it was the
sole reason we did poorly. We've had one bad tourna
ment and I don't think you can base our whole season
on that."
Arizona State's Larry Barbar led his team to a
home tournament victory by winning the individual
title with an 11-under par 205. Three Sun Devil golfers
withstood the heat to finish in the top four and likely
cement ASU as the No. 1 team in the nation.
The Cardinal finished the three-round tournament

with a score of 880, 39 strokes behind the victorious
Sun Devils. A telling sign of the weather's effect on the
results was that those schools located in hot climates,
including Arizona, Texas and Oklahoma, faired con
siderably better than strong squads from BYU, Col
orado, Oregon and Stanford.
To make matters worse for Stanford, the Pacific 10
Conference Championships and the NCAA West
Regionals will both be held in Tucson, Ariz., in May,
when even more brutal conditions can be expected.
Next weekend's U.S. Intercollegiate will be the Car
dinal's final tune-up before it heads back to the desert
climate of Arizona. The Intercollegiate tournament
will be held in the more comfortable surroundings of
the Stanford Golf Course and will mark just the second
time all year that Stanford has competed at home. The
Cardinal won the Stanford Shootout in October.
