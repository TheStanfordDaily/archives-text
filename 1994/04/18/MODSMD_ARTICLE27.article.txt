# Pac-10 suspends all women's tennis matches
## Possible violations of status rules prompt voluntary halt 
### Rob Ross Senior staff writer 
Saturday was a gorgeous day to play tennis. At the
Stanford Tennis Stadium there was a match sched
uled between two of the best women's tennis teams in
the nation — Stanford and UCLA. The stands were
packed with fans anxious for a match between the
top-10 teams in a battle that would help determine
seedings at the NCAA National Championships next
month.
The Stanford cable company was there to capture
this premier event for the Palo Alto community.
There was even a hot dog vendor outside the stadium,
primed to benefit from the three-hour sporting event.
All the pieces were in place.
Yet no match was played. The Pacific 10 Confer
ence, of which both Stanford (20-2) and UCLA (15-6)
are a part, canceled all of its women's tennis matches
pending investigation of the amateur status of all
players.
"We got a fax yesterday saying that any player
who has accepted expense money from professional
tournaments is ineligible," said disappointed Cardi
nal head coach Frank Brennan.

expense money from professional
tournaments except freshman
Emily Burt. Stanford is not alone in
this regard; in fact, most collegiate
tennis players have accepted money
to cover expenses.
Until recently, players could
take expense money from tourna
ments and retain their amateur
status, thereby maintaining their
collegiate eligibility. But before the
season the NCAA Rules Committee
rewrote the rule which governs this
behavior, intensifying the guide
lines players must follow.
Pac-10 Conference heads were
unavailable for comment over the
weekend, but this unusual move is
suspected to be a blanket decision
to prevent any conference schools
from NCAA Championship suspen
sion. By voluntarily halting the
play of its member schools, the Pac
-10 schools can perhaps avoid hav
ing to serve their suspensions dur
ing the NCAA Championships.
The curtailment leaves next
weekend's Pac-10 Tournament in
question. If the conference insists
on a two-game halting of play to cor
respond to the NCAA's two-match
suspension, then there would be no

championship as such an event
would be the second of the two.
As of Thursday, Brennan main
tained that none of his players had
broken any eligibility rules. There
fore, Saturday's cancellation came
as quite a surprise.
"I have no idea what will happen
next," he said. "But I feel very
strongly about attending the
NCAAs (in three weeks)."
Friday's scheduled match
against USC (10-12) was no less
surprising. The squad had already
voluntarily declared two of the top
players, Petra Schmitt and Suzanne
Italiano, ineligible due to violations
of this same rule.
These eligibility problems and
also two team injuries forced USC
head coach Cheryl Woods to forfeit
with only three of her players both
eligible and healthy.
Assuming all Pac-10 teams are
reinstated by the conference in time
for the NCAA Championships, the
biggest losers in the weekend's con
fusion were Cardinal seniors Laxmi
Poruri, Kristine Kurth and Emma
Woodhouse. Each was honored in a
small ceremony and did play intra
squad matches on Saturday, but
according to team captain Poruri, a
senior, it just was not the same.
"I'm pissed, really pissed," she
said.
