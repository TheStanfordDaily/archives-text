## Volley pounds to double wins 
### Kathryn Yang Senior staff writer 
Returning just two seniors from last year's second
ranked team, the Stanford volleyball squad entered
the 1994 campaign as the dark horse candidate in the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation.
However, as the season progressed, the dark horse
has turned into a beauty, inching its way up from the
No. 7 to its present No. 2 spot and securing first place
in the Pacific Division with only one regular season
game left.
Over the weekend, the Cardinal continued to build
upon its momentum with easy victories against No. 9
San Diego State and unranked UC-San Diego.
Against a hungry San Diego State team on Friday
night, Stanford (17-8 overall, 14-4 in the MPSF) stood
its ground and denied the Aztecs of both a victoiy and
a playoff spot. However, the 13-15, 15-5, 15-11, 15-9
final does not do justice to the drama of the match.
In the first game, Stanford fell behind early due to
hitting errors by its big guns — opposite hitter Matt
Fuerbringer and swing hitter Mike Lambert.
Although middle blockers Michael Hoefer and Brian
Garrett picked up the slack, the Cardinal could not
pull out the win.
"We were a little nervous coming out there in
game one, because it was an important game," said
coach Ruben Nieves. "There were some ball-handling
and communication mistakes out there, but we final
ly did turn the momentum around."
And that momentum carried Stanford through
the second game, as the they "got ahead and never
looked back," according to Nieves.
Despite the 15-5 slaughter in the second frame,
Stanford still struggled in the third game — falling
behind 7-0 before turning things around.
At 7-0, Nieves inserted freshman defensive spe
cialist Stewart Chong into the back row. After three
rotations, Chong had narrowed the Cardinal deficit to
just 8-6. Then, enter sophomore defensive specialist
J.B. Taylor, who served for three consecutive points
and put Stanford up 9-8 for the first time in the game.
"That was the turning point in the game," Nieves
said. "Because after that we sided-out really well and
allowed San Diego State only three more points."
In all, Stanford sided-out 10 times in a row — just
enough for them to narrow the 11-9 deficit and turn
it into a 15-11 win.
Then, in the final game of the match, Stanford fell
behind again, 5-6, before Fuerbringer turned things
around with a deadly spike down the sideline. As
Fuerbringer exploded on the ball, the Aztecs' setter
David Smith threw up both hands to protect his face
— but to no avail. Smith left the game with possibly a
broken nose, and Stanford went on tally five straight
points en route to the 15-9 finish.
The next night's drudging would not be as excit
ing, as Stanford made short work of the Tritons 15-9,
15-5, 15-7. Two of UCSD's top hitters were held to a
negative hitting percentage as the Triton's accounted
for a pitiful .039 team hitting percentage.
Meanwhile, the Cardinal had a field day with
Lambert swinging for a .769 average and 11 kills and
Fuerbringer adding 11 kills on a .500 day. Overall,
the Cardinal overpowered UCSD with a .453 hitting
percentage.
On defense, it would be much the same story —
Stanford gathering 24 blocks to the Tritons' four.
"It was kind of a mismatch," Nieves said. "The
only way we'd be completely satisfied with a game like
that, though, is if we win 15-0."
