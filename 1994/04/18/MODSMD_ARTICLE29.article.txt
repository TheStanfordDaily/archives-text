# Softball bats to winless weekend

In some ball games, one team's hits do not
find the holes while the opposing team's seem
to use eyes to guide themselves.
Unfortunately for the Stanford softball
team, too few of its hits landed in the gaps this
weekend as it dropped double-headers against
both Point Loma Nazarene College (18-12)
and the University of San Diego (19-13).
The Cardinal (4-27) started its road trip on
Friday against Point Loma's ace pitcher Jack
ie Volkert. With two outs in the first inning,
Cardinal freshman Summer Lee whacked a
triple off Volkert, but Lee was left stranded.
This was the closest the Cardinal came to
scoring, as Volkert went on to hurl a four-hit
shutout.
"She was the fastest pitcher that we've
faced all year," said sophomore captain Lynn
Anderson of Volkert. "By the time that we
adjusted, the game was over."
The loss came in spite of a strong perfor

mance by Cardinal pitcher Angela Webb, who
allowed no earned runs and no walks in the 1-
0 defeat.
Ironically, Stanford had trouble adjusting
to slow pitching in the second game against
Point Loma, as Robin Rabello yielded just
four hits in another 1-0 victory for the Lady
Crusaders.
"Rabello changed speeds well against us,"
said Stanford assistant coach Andy Pearce.
"We hit some hard balls, but they all went
right at someone."
Once again the Cardinal failed to take
advantage of a fine pitching performance.
Cardinal freshman Katie Beattie, despite suf
fering from the flu, gave up no walks and only
two hits to the Lady Crusaders. Yet the Car
dinal defense could not remedy Beattie's
efforts as it allowed an unearned run to score
in the first inning and committed a total of
four errors.
Stanford tried to recover on Saturday dur
ing a pair against the University of San Diego.
However, the Toreros (18-13) handed the Car

dinal a 8-0 beating in the opener. San Diego
starter Andrea Marino gave up only four hits
as Webb took the loss for the Cardinal.
"That was the first time in a while when we
simply had a bad game," Pearce said. "It was
disappointing â€” we hit a couple hard balls
right at them for two double plays in the first
three innings. We were still in the game until
we gave up five runs in the fourth inning."
Stanford's offense returned to normal in
the nightcap as junior Caryn Okinaga led the
way with three of the Cardinal's ten hits.
Starting pitcher Lee kept the Cardinal in the
game, taking a 5-2 lead into the bottom of the
sixth. This lead would soon evaporate with San
Diego driving in three runs to tie the game.
Beattie, who had relieved Lee in the sixth,
went on to pitch the seventh inning. Beattie
recorded two outs before San Diego's Trisha
Smith singled in the game winning run.
"It was disappointing that we couldn't
hold on to our lead, but at least we pulled our
level up to where we knew we could play,"
Anderson said.
