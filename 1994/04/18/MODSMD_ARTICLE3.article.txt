Jasmine, a child from East
Palo Alto, tries to slip under a
limbo stick at Saturday's 10th
annual Stanford Community
Carnival on Florence Moore
field. Several hundred elemen
tary school children from East
Palo Alto were shuttled to
campus to participate in tradi
tional carnival games like a
sponge toss, a whiffleball
throw and a dunking booth.
About 30 dorms sponsored
game booths at the event,
which — in addition to provid
ing an afternoon of fun —
raised funds for the East Palo
Alto-Stanford Summer Acade
my. The academy, a six-week
program, provides enrichment
education to middle school
students from the
Ravenswood School District.
