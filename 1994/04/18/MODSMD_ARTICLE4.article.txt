# 'If you can't talk about it, don't do it'
## New sexual assault prevention coordinator Shapiro plans to be vocal 
### Beth Berselli Staff writer 
Trace Shapiro plans to remember the words
of her favorite comedian when she begins work
today as coordinator of the Sexual Assault Pre
vention Program.
"Suzie Landolphi, who does this hilarious act
about AIDS, always says, 'If you can't talk about
it, don't do it.' I really agree with that message,"
she said.
Shapiro hopes to spread this message to stu
dents as part of her new job, which is half-time
and funded by the University for the next six

months.
"This is a fixed-term position," Shapiro said,
adding that she plans to re-apply when her term
ends in late September. The University has com
mitted to funding the position for an additional
two years, she said.
As coordinator, Shapiro will be responsible
for organizing sexujil assault prevention educa
tion for students and improving outreach ser
vices to students in residence halls and commu
nity groups.
"My job Ls kind of a catalyst to start building a
lot more bridges in the community," said
Shapiro, who will complete her masters in

health psychology education in June. "I will
serve as a kind of resource network."
Establishing a peer health education pro
gram at Stanford is a top priority, Shapiro said.
"Outreach — I really feel like it needs to be
out there. It can't reside in Cowell alone because
very few people use Cowell. It's important to get
it out there. It's important to get it in the dorms
and really have the resources there and available
for people," she said.
"What we're trying to do is establish a resi
dent peer health educator in the dorms. We're
running a pilot program next year
to establish this," Shapiro added.
Stressing that the peer health
educators would not be counselors,
Shapiro said, "They would be edu
cators. They would design pro
grams and also serve as resources
for anybody's questions."
In addition to developing a peer
health education program, Shapiro
will be working together with Sex
ual Assault Prevention Educator
Angelina Cheney to organize the
"Sex in the '90s" Orientation pro
gram.
"My primary focus right now is
getting the facilitators trained for
'Sex in the '90s'," Shapiro said.
"The majority of the rapes that
occur happen within the first three
months of a women's time at col
lege. ... That's why 'Sex in the
'90s' really targets that time peri

od."
Shapiro is not new to the Uni
versity's Health Promotion Ser
vices. As a program assistant for
the previous two quarters,
Shapiro conducted a survey to
determine how useful a residence
based peer health educator pro
gram would be. The survey
results revealed that "the majori
ty of people said that they would
use a peer health educator," she
said.
Shapiro's predecessor, Fran
Gibson, resigned in November, but
Shapiro did not become aware of
the vacancy until early this year.
She applied for the position and
was interviewed by a selection com
mittee composed of students and
staff.
"I know she'll do a terrific job,"
said Virginia Duplessis, a member
of the selection committee. "She's
got lots of energy and a very good
rapport with students."
Health Promotion Program
director Carole Pertofsky said

Shapiro has "a fabulous back
ground" in program development.
"Trace has the kind of interperson
al skills and openness that will
make her an asset to the program.
We're really lucky to have her," she
said.
Originally from Kansas City,
Kansas, Shapiro completed her
undergraduate work at Sarah
Lawrence College in New York.
While at Sarah Lawrence, she was
a member of the Women's Coali
tion and also did research on can
cer prevention.
Shapiro spent last summer vol
unteering at a children's hospital
in Siberia, and she is currently try
ing to organize a doctor's exchange
between the Lucile Packard Chil
dren's Hospital at Stanford and the
Russian hospital where she volun
teered.
"I'd love to be a doctor some
day. I would like to be a general
practitioner with an emphasis on
women's and children's health,"
she said.
