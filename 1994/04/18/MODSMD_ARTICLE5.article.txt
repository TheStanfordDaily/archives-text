# Making seniors feel 'Young at Heart'
## Student group entertains older generation with songs of yore 
### Katarina Milicevic 
For the elderly, living in convalescent
homes, holidays are often the only times
when they receive extra attention from
relatives and the community. But a newly
formed community service group at Stan
ford strives to bring them joy on a regular
basis through song and dance.
Recently organized by sophomores Be
linda Fu and I jsa Brooks, Young At Heart
visits convalescent homes every Sunday
evening, entertaining the senior citizens
with a performance of songs from their
youth.
The purpose of the group's visit is not
to show off singing and dancing talents,
Fu said. "You don't do it to get audience
cheers and yells and screams. You're not

going to get that."
Instead, a major part of the perfor
mance is the constant interaction with the
seniors. Brooks said the group will move
into the audience and hold the senior citi
zens' hands, singing directly to them.
"Physical contact is really important, a
very humanizing thing. A lot of people are
afraid to touch older people for some rea
son," she said.
When Fu first arrived at Stanford, she
was looking for an activity that dealt di
rectly with the older generation. Failing to
find one, Fu said she decided to create her
own, basing it on Rainbow Connection, a
performance group both she and Brooks
belonged to in high school.
Fu applied for the Alumni Associa
tion's $1,500 Pierce Award. Although she

did not receive the grant, Fu was awarded
with the association's community service
grant instead.
Coming together for the first time last
quarter, Young At Heart has spent many
hours practicing songs and choreograph
ing numbers. There are 14 students in the
group, representing all undergraduate
classes, and includes a graduate student.
While the founders have been im
pressed with the group's interest, commit
ment and teamwork, the new members
are pleased with the freedoms and oppor
tunities they are given in creating the
show, which lasts from 30 to 45 minutes.
The group sings mostly older, standard
songs that the senior citizens will recog-
