# Making seniors feel 'Young at Heart'
## Student group entertains older generation with songs of yore 
### Katarina Milicevic 
For the elderly, living in convalescent
homes, holidays are often the only times
when they receive extra attention from
relatives and the community. But a newly
formed community service group at Stan
ford strives to bring them joy on a regular
basis through song and dance.
Recently organized by sophomores Be
linda Fu and I jsa Brooks, Young At Heart
visits convalescent homes every Sunday
evening, entertaining the senior citizens
with a performance of songs from their
youth.
The purpose of the group's visit is not
to show off singing and dancing talents,
Fu said. "You don't do it to get audience
cheers and yells and screams. You're not

going to get that."
Instead, a major part of the perfor
mance is the constant interaction with the
seniors. Brooks said the group will move
into the audience and hold the senior citi
zens' hands, singing directly to them.
"Physical contact is really important, a
very humanizing thing. A lot of people are
afraid to touch older people for some rea
son," she said.
When Fu first arrived at Stanford, she
was looking for an activity that dealt di
rectly with the older generation. Failing to
find one, Fu said she decided to create her
own, basing it on Rainbow Connection, a
performance group both she and Brooks
belonged to in high school.
Fu applied for the Alumni Associa
tion's $1,500 Pierce Award. Although she

did not receive the grant, Fu was awarded
with the association's community service
grant instead.
Coming together for the first time last
quarter, Young At Heart has spent many
hours practicing songs and choreograph
ing numbers. There are 14 students in the
group, representing all undergraduate
classes, and includes a graduate student.
While the founders have been im
pressed with the group's interest, commit
ment and teamwork, the new members
are pleased with the freedoms and oppor
tunities they are given in creating the
show, which lasts from 30 to 45 minutes.
The group sings mostly older, standard
songs that the senior citizens will recog-

nize, such as "It Don't Mean A
Thing," "Boogie Woogie Bugle
Boy," and other jazz and Broad
way melodies. However, both Fu
and Brooks stressed that Young
At Heart is as much a community
service group as a performance
group.
Young At Heart's first perfor
mance was on April 10 at the Uni
versity Convalescent Home in
Menlo Park. Afterwards, group
members said they realized how
rewarding yet difficult the visits
can be.
Freshman Katie Barnett
remembered how receptive one
woman was. "She started to sing
along and was telling us how she
used to be a performer," she said.
At other times, however, Barnett

said some senior citizens did unpre
dictable things. "They would walk
around or leave or mumble and
some were completely unrespon
sive," she said.
For the members, the most
important aspect of the visit is
after the show, when the students
stay to talk with their audience.
Junior Mike Chinnavaso noted
that the senior citizens "were
incredibly happy. One lady said, 'It
made my whole week!' They said
that they haven't seen a group like
this in a long time."
Barnett said almost all the audi
ence members asked the group to
come back, highlighting one
woman in particular. "She didn't
want us to leave. She started crying
and saying she was scared and
didn't know where she was. Her
kids had left her there and no one
came to see her. She didn't want us
to go, and it was so hard to leave
her," she said.

Not only are the senior citizens
touched by the performances, the
students are affected as well. The
visits cause Young At Heart mem
bers to deal with the realities of ag
ing, sickness, and death, issues
many tend to ignore. "It provokes
lots of inner feelings and inner con
flicts," Brooks said.
After the first performance,
some members wanted to stay with
the same home and develop indi
vidual relationships. Others felt it
was important to reach out to all
the elderly. In fact, Fu said she is
already thinking of ways to possi
bly expand the group, perhaps by
forming other versions of Young At
Heart.
For students interested in join
ing Young At Heart, auditions will
probably be held next fall. In addi
tion to their weekly visits, the
group is also scheduled to perform
at the Class of 1924's 70th reunion
on April 30.

touched by the performances, the
students are affected as well. The
visits cause Young At Heart mem
bers to deal with the realities of ag
ing, sickness, and death, issues
many tend to ignore. "It provokes
lots of inner feelings and inner con
flicts," Brooks said.
After the first performance,
some members wanted to stay with
the same home and develop indi
vidual relationships. Others felt it
was important to reach out to all
the elderly. In fact, Fu said she is
already thinking of ways to possi
bly expand the group, perhaps by
forming other versions of Young At
Heart.
For students interested in join
ing Young At Heart, auditions will
probably be held next fall. In addi
tion to their weekly visits, the
group is also scheduled to perform
at the Class of 1924's 70th reunion
on April 30.
