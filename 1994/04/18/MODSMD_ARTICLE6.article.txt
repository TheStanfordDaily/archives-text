# Why voters said no
## News analysis 
### Jim Luh Staff writer 
Student organizations disappointed at
losing their special fees in last week's elec
tion are pointing to a graduate student

backlash, climbing ASSU
fees on student bills and
unfavorable Daily en
dorsements as the cause of
the voters' mass rejection

of funding requests.
But the results may be less an organized
movement against special fees than a re
flection of student apathy amplified by a

new computer voting system that requires
a few more keystrokes to approve a fee than
last year's HyperCard ballot.
Eighteen of the 36 groups that appeared
on the ballot this year will not receive spe
cial-fee funding, the highest proportion of
rejections in recent history. By comparison,
only five of 32 groups were voted down last
year.
Eight of those 18 groups were approved
by the majority, but lost because they did
not receive enough "yes" votes. The ASSU
Bylaws require that the majority approving
a special fee constitutes 15 percent
of the registered student population
in spring quarter, or 1,974 votes.
Those eight failures may have
been partially due to an unusually
high number of abstentions.
Although the total number of voters
dropped by just 37 from last year, the
average number of abstentions on
special fee votes more than tripled.
An additional reason for so many
student groups' failures in the polls
may have been growing graduate
student discontent with special fees.
ASSU Elections Commissioner
Tom Tsao refuses to release figures
on the graduate and undergraduate
votes unless the senate requests
that he do so, which will likely hap
pen during tomorrow's meeting.
But preliminary results released
Thursday show that even if gradu
ate students had not voted against
special fees at a higher rate than
undergraduates, no additional fees

would have passed because they still
would not have reached the 15 per
cent mark.
Disenchanted with paying fees
they felt mostly benefit undergradu
ates, graduate students organized
into the Graduate Student Tea
Party contributed to high special-fee
refund rates this year — about 32
percent fall quarter and about 39
percent winter quarter. Refund
rates in past years have typically
remained near 25 percent.
Graduate student discontent also
spawned the Fair Funding Amend
ment, a proposed alteration of the
ASSU Constitution that would have
split special-fee votes into graduate
and undergraduate divisions and
eliminated the 15 percent rule. The
proposal failed by fewer than 2 per
centage points.
Interestingly enough, if the
amendment had passed, several
more groups would have received
funding. Eight groups would have
received funding because the
amendment abolished the 15 per
cent rule, and some of the additional
10 organizations would have been

approved by undergraduates alone.
But a graduate backlash may not
be the only explanation — the num
ber of graduate voters this year actu
ally decreased slightly, from 2,189
last year to 2,071 this year. And the
average number of total "no" votes
on special fees declined.
Other groups cited endorsements
by The Daily's editorial board as a
reason for the rejection of their
groups, saying The Daily acted irre
sponsibly and unfairly when formu
lating its recommendations. The
board suggested "no" votes on seven
groups and gave eight "without rec
ommendations."
Esther Conrad, a representative
of Students for Environmental
Action at Stanford said she thought
The Daily should have considered
only a group's value to the Stanford
community when it made its
endorsements. She found it inappro
priate that The Daily considered line
items in student group budgets,
since that role is filled by the senate's
Appropriations Committee. Howev
er, Appropriations Committee mem
ber Sanford Dickert said the commit

tee's single responsibility was to
ensure that the numbers on the bud
get reflect the true cost of the items.
Jason Colton, whose Coffeehouse
Live! will not receive funding, said
that as an organization that receives
a fee itself, The Daily should not
make any endorsements on special
fee issues. "It's a direct conflict of
interest," he said.
But the larger problem for spe
cial-fee groups, it seems, is the
increased abstention rate. The high
est number of abstentions on a spe
cial-fee vote last year was 779, and
the average number was 447. This
year, the lowest number of absten
tions was 1,045, for the Asian Amer
ican Students Association and the
average was 1,451.
Many have suggested that the new
UNIX on-line voting system played a
role in the increased abstention rate,
as students had to type a group's
number, type "y" or "n," and press
"return," instead of simply mouse
clicking an organization's name, as in
the old HyperCard system.
"I think that a lot of students ...
just get so sick of the process and just

skip through," said freshman Nicole
Wellman, treasurer of the Stanford
American Indian Organization.
"It's not nearly as user-friendly
as the Macintosh," Tsao admitted,
stressing that a limited budget made
it difficult to refine the system
before its first practical application.
But the controversy over the
UNIX system and the abstention
rate obscures the more fundamental
question of how well special fee votes
reflect student opinion — does the
new, more cumbersome voting sys
tem make it too difficult for students
to vote for groups they want to fund,
or did the old, easier system make it
too easy for an uninformed elec
torate to vote "yes" on groups they
knew nothing about?
Junior Virginia Duplessis, whose
group, the Coalition Against Sexual
Assault, missed the 15 percent mark
by 10 votes, had a definite opinion
on that issue.
"If the majority of voters votes
for your group, you should win," she
said. "I don't see why ... apathy is
basically taken as a 'no' vote."
Law student Kim Walsh, who

represents Sexual Assault Legal
Advocates, said that while she
understood the importance of "close
scrutiny of budgets," she was con
cerned that many students and vot
ers do not realize the value and
extent of the services that special-fee
organizations provide to the Stan
ford community.
"[lt's] unfortunate that the new
system does not adequately reflect
the student body's ... appreciation
for the services provided," she said.
Graduate senator Sanford Dick
ert also mentioned the importance
of informing voters, saying the on
line system provided no information
about ballot measures and organiza
tions requesting special fees. Before
the new UNIX system was institut
ed, election handbooks were usually
available at polling sites.
But the special-fee groups them
selves are also responsible for com
municating their importance to both
graduate and undergraduate voters,
Dickert said.
"No special-fee groups advertised
in the graduate domain," Dickert
said.
