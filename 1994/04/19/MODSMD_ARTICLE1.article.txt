# U.S. policies toward Haiti scrutinized by Aristide

### Josh Gohlke Staff writer 
Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide,
whose government was ousted by a military
coup over two and a half years ago, compared
the country he was forced to flee to a house on
fire in a speech last night at Memorial Audito
rium.
"When those inside somehow find a way to
escape, the U.S. Coast Guard throws them
back into the burning house," Aristide said.
Speaking to an audience of about 1,400 in a
soft yet confident voice, the exiled president
decried what he called the Clinton administra
tion's "racist" policy of refusing asylum to
Haitian refugees fleeing the government of the
coup leaders.
"If Haiti were a country of white people, and
not black people, U.S. policy would change,"
Aristide said.
Aristide, who was elected president with 67
percent of the popular vote in December 1991,
contrasted his democratic, nonviolent princi
ples with the dictatorship of those who ousted
him, led by General Raoul Cedras.
"Two strategies have emerged: the strate
gy of the gun versus the strategy of the pen,"
he said. "The coup leaders have chosen the
gun. This strategy is rooted in murder, lies,
economic self-interest and dilatory maneu
vers."
Aristide said this "strategy of the gun" has
led to a dramatic rise in the violation of human
rights, a trend which his government had re
versed during the seven months he was in
power.
"This is not my subjective judgment; this is
a rational conclusion that can be demonstrated
by facts," Aristide said, stating that over 5,000
Haitians have been murdered since his exile.
Aristide cited other atrocities as well, saying
that rape is now a strategy used by the "illegit

imate" government, as soldiers violate the
wives and daughters of men who supported
him.
The 40-year-old president then spoke of his
desire to restore democracy in Haiti and
change its status as the poorest nation in the
Western Hemisphere.
Other conditions in Haiti which the presi
dent said are being perpetuated are its position
as the second largest drug trafficker in Latin
America, its 85 percent illiteracy rate — "Can
you believe that?" he repeatedly asked the au
dience — and its count of one soldier for every
1,000 inhabitants, but only 1.8 doctors for
every 10,000.
Aristide said his government, before it was
deposed, had already begun changing the con
ditions which cause the overwhelming majori
ty of Haitians to be poverty-stricken, by re
structuring the military, instituting civilian
leadership, and thereby stemming the flow of

refugees.
"In those seven months, we stopped the
exodus of citizens from Haiti he said.
"There was no refugee crisis. . . there was no
political repression to flee. If Ithe United
States] wants to stop the refugees, the only
way is through the restoration of democra
cy."
Given his success, Aristide questioned the
lack of "practical" support from the interna
tional community. Although all the major
powers recognize Aristide's administration as
the legitimate government of Haiti, the coup
leaders have not been forced to step down.
"We still see the same military with the
same weapons doing the same kind of repres
sion," he said.
However, Aristide maintained that, regard
less of the lack of support from other coun-
