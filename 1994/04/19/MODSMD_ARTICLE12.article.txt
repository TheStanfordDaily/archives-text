Nixon suffers stroke
NEW YORK (AP) - Former Presi
dent Richard Nixon, whose accomplish
ments in a lifetime on the world stage
were forever overshadowed by the
Watergate scandal that forced him from
office, suffered a stroke yesterday.
Nixon, 81, had the stroke at his Park
Ridge, N.J., home and was taken by
ambulance to New York Hospital-Cornell
Medical Center, where he was listed in
stable condition, Nixon spokeswoman
Kathy O'Connor said. "He's fine," she
said.
Nixon was conscious in intensive care
and was being treating with blood-thin
ners, she said.
O'Connor said Nixon was upstairs
getting ready for dinner when he suf
fered the stroke at 5:45 p.m. He was able

to summon the housekeeper, who called
the ambulance, she said.
Rates upped again
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Federal
Reserve nudged interest rates up for the
third time this year yesterday, prompting
large banks to boost prime lending rates
to the highest level in nearly 2 1/2 years.
Citibank and Chemical Bank, two of
the largest U.S. banks, led the move to a
higher prime rate, announcing they were
boosting this benchmark for many busi
ness and consumer loans by a half-per
centage point to 6.75 percent.
The Dow Jones industrial average lost
41.05 points to close at 3620.42, while
the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond
went up to 7.42 percent, the highest level
of the Clinton presidency.
