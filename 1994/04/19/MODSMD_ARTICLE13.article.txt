# U.N.: 'The town is at their mercy'
## Gorazde assault continues while cease-fire promised, air-strikes considered 
### 
SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina
(AP) — Confounded by Bosnian Serb
guns they cannot silence, international
mediators and U.N. officials said yester
day there was nothing they could do for
the terrorized Muslim enclave of
Gorazde.
"The town is at their mercy," said the
U.N. commander for Bosnia, Lt. Gen.
Sir Michael Rose. "We are on the edge of
a major humanitarian catastrophe."
While Serb artillery pounded
Gorazde and refugees searched for
cover, U.N. officials said Serb leaders
again promised a cease-fire and the
deployment of U.N. troops in the east
ern enclave, home to an estimated
65,000 people.
A Red Cross convoy and a company
of U.N. troops were prepared to head to
Gorazde today, said U.N. spokesman

Maj. Dacre Holloway.
But relief officials and local leaders
reported more shelling, and there was
no immediate sign that the cease-fire
would be respected. The Serbs have
repeatedly broken promises to stop
attacking the U.N.-declared safe haven.
Later yesterday, U.N. chief Boutros
Boutros-Ghali asked NATO to autho
rize air strikes to protect all the Un
designated "safe areas" in Bosnia, a
move that would expand U.N. authority
to call in NATO planes. There was no
immediate response from NATO.
Earlier in the day, President Clinton
played down the possibility of further
air attacks on Serb forces around
Gorazde, and renewed his call for end
ing a U.N. ban on arms shipments to
the Muslim-led government.
U.N. officials had said there would be

little gained by calling in more NATO
air strikes because the limited raids
over the past week did not blunt the
Serb offensive. The only military officer
in Gorazde to guide NATO planes was
among seven British officers evacuated
at dawn, U.N. officials said.
Fewer than 10 U.N. observers were
left in the besieged enclave.
U.N. workers in Gorazde reported
heavy shelling of the town about 35
miles southeast of Sarajevo, said U.N.
spokesman Joe Sills in New York.
"The defenses have collapsed. There
are intentional and indiscriminate
attacks on civilians," he said.
Bosnian Serb forces said they had
taken over most of the Gorazde enclave,
apart from the center of town and a
stretch of 4 to 5 miles along the north
ern bank of the Drina.
