## Editorial Choosing to abstain 
### 
The new voting system
made abstaining easy —
and hurt many groups

ASSU ELECTIONS have
come and gone again, and by
this time, they are usually
long-forgotten. But last week's bal
loting continues to weigh on the
minds of many students as they
struggle to understand why 18 of
36 organizations lost their special
fee requests.
This year, numerous groups lost
their fees not because more voters
said "no" than "yes" but because
their "yes" tally didn't total at least
15 percent of the student body, as
required. More than 1,000 people
said "I abstain" on the special fees
of every group — a near tripling of
the abstention rate over last year.
Voter apathy may be one expla
nation, but many people are blam
ing this year's new on-line voting
system for the unprecedented
abstention rate. While direct culpa
bility could never be proven — and
any statistics student knows that
correlation doesn't equal causation
— the design of the program can't
help but raise suspicions.
Most significantly, this year's
program required voters to expend
considerably more time and effort
to vote either "yes" or "no" than to
simply abstain. To vote "yes" or
"no," one had to first select the line
number of the group, then type in
"y" or "n." An abstention required
one to do nothing. While this seems
petty on first glance, the
keystrokes add up when voting on
36 groups.
In a system in which abstentions
are not neutral — they can and do
negatively influence the results —
the ASSU must design a program
which requires voters to expend
equal effort to abstain or to vote
"yes" or "no." This year's program
failed grossly in this way, and stu
dent groups who lost their fee

requests because of the abstention
rate are living with the conse
quences.
While the yes-no-abstain flaw
was the most egregious, other
aspects of the system also warrant
scrutiny.
In previous years, when there
were designated polling places, vot
ers had easy access to Special Fee
Handbooks. Now, as students cast
ballots from their rooms or dorm
clusters, it's less likely that a hand
book will be available nearby.
Without the information —
albeit muddled — contained in the
handbook, voters have little to go
on but gut feelings, rumors, their
roommate's admonitions or the
opinion of the person sitting next
to them in the cluster.
The on-line system should allow
students the option of viewing
more information about senate
candidates, Council of Presidents
slates, groups seeking special fees
and amendments. For student
groups in particular, their general
statement as well as their line-item
budget should be available at the
touch of a button or two.
Another troubling issue sur
rounding the on-line voting was
requiring Leland accounts in order
to access the system. Many stu
dents at the Graduate School of
Business and other graduate
schools did not have these accounts
and either had to open new ones —
placing undue burdens on the Uni
versity network — or go to the
ASSU office to vote via paper bal
lot.
Furthermore, many graduated
students whose accounts are still
active were able to vote in the elec
tion. Perhaps a system similar to
CPPC Remote could address these
issues.
In the coming months, the
ASSU must revisit the idea of on
line voting and decide if it should
be continued next year. While the
ASSU should be applauded for try
ing to devise a more convenient,
and in the long run, less expensive
voting system, the question is: do
the benefits outweigh the bugs?
