## The 						Daily and the elections 
### 
NOAM CHOMSKY got to Stanford
in the nick of time. Just in time for
ASSU elections, that is. In the film
"Manufacturing Consent" Chomsky
speaks of the ideological control the media
(what many call "the fourth branch of gov
ernment") exert over democratic societies.
The first step in freeing oneself from its
grip is to recognize that it exists, to under
stand that the pretended objectivity and
neutrality of social and political commen
tary, or simple news reporting, masks pre
suppositions and ideological principles
that should be challenged, and that often
collapse very quickly when exposed.
The Daily is the main source of infor
mation about campus events for students.
There is no other source available for infor
mation and student input with a compara
ble distribution. This power grants The
Daily special privileges. The same power
also burdens any newspaper with responsi
bilities, namely to print correct facts and
allow for readers' responses to their arti
cles in a timely manner.
At no time are these privileges and
responsibilities more crucial than during
campus elections. And at no time is it more
evident that The Daily does not always ful
fill them.
We as students should continuously chal
lenge the inaccuracy and lack of openness we
may find in The Daily. Come election time,
we must be all the more watchful, as the
paper carries substantial weight in the vot
ing process through its endorsements. Stu

dents often forget our own responsibilities:
accountability is not just a one-way street.
Students must investigate, learn and ques
tion so they understand for themselves the
issues that directly affect them.
The Daily, too, needs to keep its basic
function — to provide a forum for infor
mation and openness — in mind as it han
dles special events, such as election week.
Printing endorsements seems especially
problematic when none of these groups is
able to respond to these endorsements
before elections. Even if responses are
made possible, are endorsements neces
sary or appropriate?
Students need to be informed as to the
validity of groups' requests come election
time. We need an analysis of groups' bud
gets, as most of us do not have the time to
wade through all the figures in the ASSU
Election Supplement. But students should
not allow The Daily to spoon-feed us "the
bottom line" every day of election week.
Endorsements also detract from The
Daily's forgotten responsibility: printing
the other side. By printing endorsements
and editorials for three days in a row in lieu
of allotting space for responses, The Daily
neglected its self-professed duty to provide
the campus with, as it said in its full-page
ad during elections week, a "vibrant, open,
and representative" paper. This action also
encouraged the dangerous apathy of the
typical Stanford student, who most likely
did not care enough to question the Daily's
sweeping endorsements.

There are a vast number of people who
are uninformed and heavily propagan
dized, but fundamentally decent. If they
can be brought to raise questions and apply
their decent instincts and basic intelli
gence, many people quickly escape the con
fines of the doctrinal system. ...
One acceptable alternative to The
Daily's endorsements would be a simple
analysis of the pros and cons of a group's
request without handing down a recom
mendation. Perhaps the ASSU should
rethink its Elections Handbook along
these lines. Maybe this information could
also be diffused on-line through an inde
pendent news group. These are concrete
alternatives which would help serve our
interests, while helping fulfill our individu
al responsibilities.
If The Daily does continue with its poli
cy of endorsements, it should, at a bare
minimum consider giving organizations
more lead time to respond to them.
We must recognize the dangers of the
carelessness and apathy of character
ized last week's elections. Both students
and The Daily staff need to recognize
the responsibilities which come in tan
dem with accountability, and must hold
ourselves accountable for the conse
quences of choosing to neglect such
responsibilities.
