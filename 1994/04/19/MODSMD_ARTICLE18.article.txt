## Chicano faculty members criticize firing of Burciaga 
### 
THE APRIL 13 meeting between
the Provost and Cecilia Burciaga
did little to resolve the crisis of
confidence triggered by the termination
of Cecilia. Removing her as associate
vice provost for student affairs and Casa
Zapata resident fellow, together with her
husband Antonio Burciaga, has reduced
directly the human resources available
to the entire University community for
intellectual, social and cultural develop
ment.
One consequence for us as faculty —
especially the women — is that we are

now being called upon to shoulder addi
tional responsibilities and burdens to fill
this vacuum. While everyone suffers in
times of budget cuts, the Chicana/o com
munity is being disproportionately
affected.
Not only do we believe that Cecilia's
termination was ineptly executed, we
reject the characterization that her dis
missal was simply a budgetary decision.
The administration has eliminated the
most prominent Latina associated with
Stanford without regard to its effects on
Chicana/o students, staff and faculty

and thereby signaled to us the low prior
ity which is given to Stanford's Chi
canas/os and other communities of color.
We have historically worked with
University central administrators in
resolving issues of importance to Stan
ford and the Chicana/o community in
particular. Though we remain prepared
to work with the president and provost,
we cannot see how we can assist unless
there is a significant shift in this admin
istration's commitment to Chicana/o
students, staff and faculty and those of
other communities of color.

This administration has repeatedly
alluded to the need for concrcte action
and not just verbal pronouncements.
We accept this standard and hold them
to it.
