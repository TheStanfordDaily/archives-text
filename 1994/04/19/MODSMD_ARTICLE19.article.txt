# Caning cartoon shows untrue stereotypes of Singaporean customs
## 
### 
I write in response to the cartoon
featured in the April 15 Daily. It
depicts a group of burly torturers
working inside the "Singapore Tor
ture Chamber," with a grinning Uncle
Sam looking on. Lest some Daily read
ers buy into the popular stereotype of
Singapore as an oppressive society, I
present another perspective.
Michael Fay does not deserve his
inhumane punishment. Neither do the
many Singaporeans and non-Singa
poreans who have been caned in Sin
gapore. As an informed insider, I
would say that not many other fellow
Singaporeans concur with this com
passionate view. The majority of peo
ple from back home see only the func
tional aspect of caning. They do not
consider the punishment's physical
pain and emotional trauma.
Singapore is a livable place in spite
of its restrictive laws. The streets are
safe at night, public transportation is
cheap and efficient, public housing is
decent, and, of course, there is the
delectable food. It is not another Pol

Pot regime. Much as Americans
abroad love and long for their land of
the free, other Singaporeans at Stan
ford and I yearn for and are proud of
the sights, sounds, and smells of this
tiny island-nation in southeast Asia.
Let us all not presume that a society
without a socio-political order based
upon the individual's sovereign and
inalienable rights is necessarily
repressive.
The American media seldom pre
sent a balanced picture of life in other
countries. Friday's cartoon is culpable
in sustaining a one-dimensional cari
cature of Singapore â€” a caricature
that is inaccurate and contrary to the
university's mission of fostering
cross-cultural sensitivity. To have a
"thick" insight into how life is in Sin
gapore, I encourage readers to talk
with the 70 or so Singaporean stu
dents on campus. We are not brain
washed Asians spouting pro-establish
ment rhetoric. Instead, we are indi
viduals with diverse concerns, inter
ests, and political opinions.
Singapore is not a static society.
Some day, the winds of liberal free
dom will blow through the nation.
Until then, I'll forgo chewing gum and
sink my teeth into a Snickers instead.
