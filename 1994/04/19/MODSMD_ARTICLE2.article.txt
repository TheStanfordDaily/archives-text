# Lawsuit in works over speech code
## Claims Stanford violates 1992 law 
### Linda Friedlieb Editorial staff 
Two Stanford students said
yesterday they plan to file a law
suit contesting the legality of the
University policy which governs
speech.
Junior Aman Verjee and third
year law student Rob Corry —
both of whom work for The Stan
ford Review — said they plan to
file their suit in Santa Clara Coun
ty Court, probably during the next
week.
The suit, if filed, would allege
that the Grey Interpretation of the
Fundamental Standard — which
outlines the limitations of free
speech and expression on campus

— is in violation of a 1992 Califor
nia Law known as the "Leonard
Law."
University General Counsel
Michael Roster said he had not
heard of the possibility of a suit.
"We will wait until we're served
with the suit and we will not likely
have any comment until we see
what the specific allegations are,"
he said.
The Fundamental Standard is
as old as the University itself, em
phasizing "respect for order,
morality, personal honor, and the
rights of others."
However, in 1989, an interpre
tation of the standard authored by
Law Prof. Thomas Grey was
adopted to "clarify the point at
which protected free expression
ends and prohibited discriminatory
harassment begins." The interpre
tation focuses specifically on
speech which "is intended to insult
or stigmatize an individual or
group of individuals on the basis of
their sex, race, color, handicap,
religion, sexual orientation, or
national and ethnic origin."
Verjee said he hoped to see the
code abolished because of its "chill
ing effect" on speech and also the

potential harm it could do, if
enforced more rigorously.
"I'm motivated out of love for
Stanford," Corry added. "It's more
of a First Amendment, philosophi
cal issue. It's a matter of principle,
not a desire to engage in hate
speech."
The "Leonard Law," California
Education Code Section 94367,
requires private secondary educa
tional institutions in the state of
California to adhere to the same
standards as public institutions in
the protection of free speech.
The law states that private uni
versities "shall not make or enforce
any rule subjecting any student to
disciplinary sanctions solely on the
basis of conduct that is speech or

other communication that, when
engaged in outside the campus .. .
is protected from governmental
restriction" by either the federal or
state constitutions.
Corry said he cannot name their
counsel because they are still in the
negotiation process. However, he
added that the counsel will be
named on the filed lawsuit.
Corry also stated that the duo
has standing to file a suit even
though they have not been accused
of or punished for violating the
speech code.
However, Roster said that
standing could be one of many
issues discussed in such a lawsuit.
The ultimate goals of the law
suit, according to Veijee, include

the repeal of the speech code and
sensitivity training on the issues
surrounding freedom of speech for
the defendants, who may include
University President Gerhard
Casper and Judicial Affairs Officer
Sally Cole.
Cole also said she could not
comment on the possibility of a
lawsuit because she did not have
enough information.
However, Grey, the author of the
interpretation, said he feels the
interpretation is consistent with the
First Amendment. "Our harass
ment regulation is perfectly consti
tutional and will withstand any
legal challenge," he said. "Our view
was always that Stanford should
follow the First Amendment."
