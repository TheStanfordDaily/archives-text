# 28 groups in Stanford ministries need space for services, activities

### 
The Daily's April 14 headline "Moving
Day" above the article about the Black
House groups' plans to relocate in the Old
Union is very misleading. It seems to over
look the text of the article which indicates
there are serious problems which need to
addressed before any move might take
place. According to Vice Provost for Stu
dent Affairs Mary Edmonds, finding a place
for Stanford Associated Ministries must be
worked out first.
Your readers need to know some of our
history. There are 28 different religious
groups in SAM. These groups serve liter
ally thousands of Stanford students, and
have occupied the clubhouse space for
more than 20 years. These student groups
deserve adequate space just as much as
any other group on campus.
The administration of the University,
through Memorial Church's Dean Robert
Gregg and acting Dean Diana Akiyama,
has made it clear that no move can be
made before adequate and comparable
accommodations can be found for the reli
gious groups on campus. To date this has
not been done.

What the campus really needs is a
multi-faith center which will accommo
date the activities of the many Stanford
students involved with religious groups
on campus. Until such a center is built, we
trust the assurances of the administra
tion adequately to provide for the thou
sands of students involved in religious
activities.
At other universities we have observed
that too often administrators refrain
from making difficult and controversial
decisions until the students are away for
the summer. We hope that such a proce
dure is not followed in this case.
