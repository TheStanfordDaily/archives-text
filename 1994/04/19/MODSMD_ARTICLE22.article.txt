## Grace Lee Why newspapers can and should make endorsements 
### 
Why are you meddling in these elec
tions?" The Daily was asked by
numerous students last week.
Even before we published our endorse
ments for the recently concluded ASSU
elections, students were clamoring to know
what right we had to pore over their bud
gets, question their proposals and basically
stick our nose in their business. (Afler all,
we're a newspaper.)
Afler two weekends of exhaustive
interviews, debate and scrutiny of bud
gets, we published our endorsements. The
first level of questioning then escalated
into accusations that The Daily was
"abusing its power" by publishing such
endorsements — or, more significantly in
this case, non-endorsements.
However, no one so vehemently or

vociferously challenged The Daily's right
to make endorsements in previous years,
when it was expected that The Daily
would endorse virtually all items on the
ballot by rubber-stamp approval.
Only when The Daily spoke unfavor
ably about these items last week did stu
dents frantically decry its right to make
endorsements that could "unfairly influ
ence" the election.
But the recognition of the media's
right and responsibility to print endorse
ments — and on a broader scale, to play
the critic — is not and should never be a
fair-weather decision based on whether
one agrees or disagrees with it. In a demo
cratic society, it must simply be a given.
Newspapers have a right and obliga
tion to make endorsements during elec-

tion times. The validity of the endorse
ments must stem from the understanding
that the newspaper, in this case, The
Daily, is independent, arid not beholden to
any special interests, such as particular
student groups or the administration.
However, even with such a mandate, no
news organization, including The Daily,
expects or encourages readers to swallow
its editorials whole, no questions asked.
But it seems that in the last week,
there was some confusion in questioning
the endorsements and questioning the
right to make these endorsements.
Questioning the endorsements, some
students suggested that we give other
groups a chance to respond. But then,
which groups? The 1974 Supreme Court
case, The Miami Herald v. Tornillo, held

that a newspaper is under no legal obliga
tion to print replies. But in more practical
terms: because The Daily could not air all
groups' responses during the elections, it
chose to air none.
Other readers more seriously ques
tioned our right to make endorsements,
suggesting the notion that editorials or
endorsements could have a very strong
influence over the largely indifferent stu
dent body. Maybe The Daily shouldn't
publish endorsements at all, they suggest
ed, lest readers be brainwashed all the
way to the polls.
This logic seems skewed. It is undeniable
that the media's influence over an apathetic
constituency can be great. However, this
influence cannot be blamed on the media.
Is it right to tell the media to back

down because the readers can't handle
it? Because readers may not be able to
think for themselves, or may somehow
mistake the analysis of the editorial
board for the authoritative word of some
higher power?
The queries become laughable, but,
sadly, they are real suggestions either
stated openly or implied in students'
responses to The Daily's endorsements
this past week.
While it may be a real concern that
some voters are apathetic, this cannot be
used to invalidate and retract a newspa
per's right to make endorsements.
Rather than asking The Daily, "Why are
you meddling in the elections?" maybe it
would be better to ask the students, "Why
aren't you 'meddling" in the elections?"
