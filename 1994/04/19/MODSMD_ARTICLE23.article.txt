# N'Gai Croal: fly in the buttermilk
## Pro Fros' guide to getting the scoop on Stanford 
### 
HEY, YOU. You with the framed,
hand-signed acceptance letter with
"Bravo!" at the bottom. You with
the Stanford jersey, Stanford backpack,
Stanford baseball cap and Stanford boxer
shorts. You with the bags under your
eyes and the jet lag from visiting 10
schools in 10 days and racking up 10 mil
lion frequent flier miles.
Yeah, you, Pro Fro. Welcome to
Stanford.
So you're thinking about becoming a
Farm boy/girl/person. Ah, yes, I remem
ber it well: a naive young lad from the
wilds of Canada, trying to decide between
the Harvard of the West, a rigorous Cali
fornia engineering school and the then
number one ranked school in U.S. News
and World Report, a decision that might
have stumped Solomon himself, yet 1...
But enough about me. You've only got
a few days to spend here and the decision
of a lifetime to make. In that spirit, here
is a list of some people you should talk to
and a few questions that you ought to
ask them.
1. Gerhard Casper, president (723-
2481, hk.gxc@forsythe.stanford.edu).

What have his first two years at Stanford
been like? Does he have a vision for the
University? How much of a say does he
believe that you will have in the direction
Stanford should take? And what are his
favorite cuss words?
2. Condoleezza Rice, provost (723-4988,
hk.cxr@forsythe.stanford.edu). Why is it
that at a university supposedly committed
to the free exchange of ideas, line-item
budgets — even as ordinary as Food Ser
vice's — are kept hidden from students?
Will her callous approach to firing long
serving administrator Cecilia Burciaga
(725-1653, cr.cpb@forsythe.stanford.edu)
become a blueprint for future employer
employee relations 9 And just how long has
she been, well, you know, black?
3. Peter Van Etten, Chief Financial Offi
cer, (725-8715, van.etten@forsythe.stan
ford.edu). Stanford tuition keeps escalat
ing at a faster rate than inflation, while
services are being cut. Why can't the
University commit to holding tuition
increases to the rate of inflation? What
added value will you receive for if tuition
continues to outpace the rate of infla
tion? And where does he get those great

titles ("Why Stanford Seems So Rich But
Acts So Poor?") for his presentations?
4. Tara VanDerveer, women's basket
ball coach, (723-0284, no listed e-mail
address). What is her secret to keeping
her team continually in the hunt for the
NCAA title? What can you do to support
the team next year? And what are the
odds of you walking onto the team if you
practice really hard over the summer?
5. James Montoya, dean of admis
sions and financial aids, (725-2839,
hf.jim@forsythe.stanford.edu). With
tuition continuing to reach new
heights and budgets continuing to be
slashed, how long will Stanford stay
committed to need-blind admissions?
Why do some students see their family
contributions rise year after year with
no apparent increase in family income?
How much room do you have to nego
tiate a better financial aid package?
And shouldn't there be some kind of
signing bonus?
6. Mary Edmonds, dean of student
affairs, (725-1808, cm.mxe@forsythe.stan
ford.edu). As a self-described advocate for
students, what has she done for students

during her tenure besides reduce services?
How does she propose to improve your
quality of life over the next four years?
What do Food Service and Residential
Education — recently lumped together to
save money — have in common? And how
often does she work out in order to lift
that big, bad budget ax?
7. Bill Walsh, Stanford football coach,
(723-4510, no listed e-mail address). Two
words: the Axe.
8. Robert Street, vice provost and dean
for libraries and information resources,
(723-2015, hk.rls@forsythe.stanford.edu).
What is the current state of Stanford's
library system, particularly as compared
to other universities? How will the reorga
nization of Green Library affect you? Will
Stanford's computer resources continue
to improve in the face of ongoing budget
cuts? And is it really true that Current
Periodicals carries Playboy and Playgirl,
but not USA Today?
9. Paul Seaver, program director for
Cultures, Ideas and Values, (723-4466,
hf.civ@forsythe.stanford.edu). What really
happened when the program changed
from Western Culture to CIV? How will

the increase in section size affect the quali
ty of my education? What changes are like
ly to take place as a result of the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Education? And, if
by some freak of fate, you get a six on your
Advanced Placement exam, will they let
you place out of the course?
10. J. Jonah Euclid, resident writer
philosopher, (no phone number or e-mail
account, often found behind Tresidder).
What is his perspective on the current
changes taking place at Stanford? How
much better — and cheaper — is Tresid
der food than Food Service? And how
much longer will he take to finish that
novel he's been typing away on that old
fashioned typewriter?
Good luck, you happy people.

ing at a faster rate than inflation, while
services are being cut. Why can't the
University commit to holding tuition
increases to the rate of inflation? What
added value will you receive for if tuition
continues to outpace the rate of infla
tion? And where does he get those great

titles ("Why Stanford Seems So Rich But
Acts So Poor?") for his presentations?
4. Tara VanDerveer, women's basket
ball coach, (723-0284, no listed e-mail
address). What is her secret to keeping
her team continually in the hunt for the
NCAA title? What can you do to support
the team next year? And what are the
odds of you walking onto the team if you
practice really hard over the summer?
5. James Montoya, dean of admis
sions and financial aids, (725-2839,
hf.jim@forsythe.stanford.edu). With
tuition continuing to reach new
heights and budgets continuing to be
slashed, how long will Stanford stay
committed to need-blind admissions?
Why do some students see their family
contributions rise year after year with
no apparent increase in family income?
How much room do you have to nego
tiate a better financial aid package?
And shouldn't there be some kind of
signing bonus?
6. Mary Edmonds, dean of student
affairs, (725-1808, cm.mxe@forsythe.stan
ford.edu). As a self-described advocate for
students, what has she done for students

during her tenure besides reduce services?
How does she propose to improve your
quality of life over the next four years?
What do Food Service and Residential
Education — recently lumped together to
save money — have in common? And how
often does she work out in order to lift
that big, bad budget ax?
7. Bill Walsh, Stanford football coach,
(723-4510, no listed e-mail address). Two
words: the Axe.
8. Robert Street, vice provost and dean
for libraries and information resources,
(723-2015, hk.rls@forsythe.stanford.edu).
What is the current state of Stanford's
library system, particularly as compared
to other universities? How will the reorga
nization of Green Library affect you? Will
Stanford's computer resources continue
to improve in the face of ongoing budget
cuts? And is it really true that Current
Periodicals carries Playboy and Playgirl,
but not USA Today?
9. Paul Seaver, program director for
Cultures, Ideas and Values, (723-4466,
hf.civ@forsythe.stanford.edu). What really
happened when the program changed
from Western Culture to CIV? How will

the increase in section size affect the quali
ty of my education? What changes are like
ly to take place as a result of the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Education? And, if
by some freak of fate, you get a six on your
Advanced Placement exam, will they let
you place out of the course?
10. J. Jonah Euclid, resident writer
philosopher, (no phone number or e-mail
account, often found behind Tresidder).
What is his perspective on the current
changes taking place at Stanford? How
much better — and cheaper — is Tresid
der food than Food Service? And how
much longer will he take to finish that
novel he's been typing away on that old
fashioned typewriter?
Good luck, you happy people.

Fros at The Daily all week between 11 a. m
and 1 p.m., or by arrangement.

HEY, YOU. You with the framed,
hand-signed acceptance letter with
"Bravo!" at the bottom. You with
the Stanford jersey, Stanford backpack,
Stanford baseball cap and Stanford boxer
shorts. You with the bags under your
eyes and the jet lag from visiting 10
schools in 10 days and racking up 10 mil
lion frequent flier miles.
Yeah, you, Pro Fro. Welcome to
Stanford.
So you're thinking about becoming a
Farm boy/girl/person. Ah, yes, I remem
ber it well: a naive young lad from the
wilds of Canada, trying to decide between
the Harvard of the West, a rigorous Cali
fornia engineering school and the then
number one ranked school in U.S. News
and World Report, a decision that might
have stumped Solomon himself, yet 1...
But enough about me. You've only got
a few days to spend here and the decision
of a lifetime to make. In that spirit, here
is a list of some people you should talk to
and a few questions that you ought to
ask them.
1. Gerhard Casper, president (723-
2481, hk.gxc@forsythe.stanford.edu).

What have his first two years at Stanford
been like? Does he have a vision for the
University? How much of a say does he
believe that you will have in the direction
Stanford should take? And what are his
favorite cuss words?
2. Condoleezza Rice, provost (723-4988,
hk.cxr@forsythe.stanford.edu). Why is it
that at a university supposedly committed
to the free exchange of ideas, line-item
budgets — even as ordinary as Food Ser
vice's — are kept hidden from students?
Will her callous approach to firing long
serving administrator Cecilia Burciaga
(725-1653, cr.cpb@forsythe.stanford.edu)
become a blueprint for future employer
employee relations 9 And just how long has
she been, well, you know, black?
3. Peter Van Etten, Chief Financial Offi
cer, (725-8715, van.etten@forsythe.stan
ford.edu). Stanford tuition keeps escalat
ing at a faster rate than inflation, while
services are being cut. Why can't the
University commit to holding tuition
increases to the rate of inflation? What
added value will you receive for if tuition
continues to outpace the rate of infla
tion? And where does he get those great

titles ("Why Stanford Seems So Rich But
Acts So Poor?") for his presentations?
