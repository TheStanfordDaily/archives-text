## Golfers take second place Top efforts from freshmen as McKay, Baxter lead way 
### Seth Goldstein Staff writer 
The New York Knicks have Madison Square
Garden.
The University of Miami Hurricanes have
the Orange Bowl.
And the San Jose State women's golf team
has the Stanford Golf Course.
The second-ranked Spartans continued their
dominance of the Cardinal's home course by
capturing the California Collegiate over the
weekend. San Jose State fmished with a two
day total of 588 strokes, five fewer than fifth
ranked Stanford's 593. Fourth-ranked USC
placed third with 609, while the rest of the 11-
team field came in well behind the three leaders.
The Spartans hold many of the course
records, including the 54-hole team low and the
18-hole team low. San Jose State set these
marks in the fall at the Stanford Intercollegiate,
which it won, defeating No. 1 Arizona State.
Spartan individuals from both the past and pre
sent have also fared extremely well on the Stan
ford greens.
"For some reason, we win at Stanford," said
San Jose State head coach Mark Gayle earlier in
the year. "We get up here to practice a few times
during the year and that might explain our suc
cess over other visiting teams, but not over
Stanford."
After Saturday's first round, the Spartans
held a one shot lead over Stanford. But the
superior play of Moodie, Vibeke Stensrud and
Nicole Materne allowed San Jose State to pull
away on Sunday.
"It's hard to tell how the team is doing when
you're out on the course," freshman Andrea
Baxter said. "But if you see that your teammate
is down, it's a good indication that the golfer
they are paired with is beating them. Everyone
seemed down on Sunday."
Though the Cardinal lost the contest, there
was some outstanding individual play. San Jose
State's Moodie captured first with
144 strokes, but one shot off her total
was Baxter and McKay, in second.
"Finally, I played well two days
in a row," said Baxter. "Beating
my own inconsistency has oflen
been harder than beating the other
team."
Senior Melinda Daniels placed
seventh, junior Jamille Jose took
ninth and sophomore Vicky Strada
finished in 16th. All in all, the
golfers were pleased, if not satis
fied with the results.
As the tournament was at
home, Stanford also fielded a sec
ond team which did not officially
compete. Made up of junior Amy
Lawrence, senior Sara Hallock and
sophomores Julie Bowen and
Kathryn Weber, Stanford Team
Two shot well enough to finish
fourth.
"It's a testimony to our team
strength," said head coach Tim
Baldwin. "Our iilternates are just
as good as some school's starting
lineups."
