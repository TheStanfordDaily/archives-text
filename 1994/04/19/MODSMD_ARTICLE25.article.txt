# Out of sight, but Wright not out of mind
## Senior's efforts overshadow lack of court time 
### Mike Langford Senior staff writer 
For someone who couldn't even hold a ten
nis racket with one hand, Billy Wright cer
tainly has come a long way.
"I started playing tennis at the age of two,
and I was too weak to hold up my tennis rack
et with one hand," said Wright, a senior in his
fourth year with the Stanford tennis team.
"That's the reason I play two-handed on both
sides (forehand and backhand)."
With a Stanford two-time All-American
for an uncle — Perry Wright in 1977 and '78
— and two tennis playing parents, including
a mother who'd throw him balls in practice,
Wright was destined to swing a racket in
some fashion.
Playing in his first national tournament at
the age of 11, Wright went on to play all
through the national junior circuit. After an
outstanding career at Beverly Hills High,
where Wright played No. 1, one spot above
Eric Menendez, it came time to think about
the future.
"I always knew that I'd play in college, but
I was going to play at UCLA originally,"
Wright said. "But then I visited Stanford and
met [head coach Dick] Gould. It was just too
good of an educational opportunity to pass
up."
But that opportunity didn't extend to the
courts during Wright's freshman year on the
Farm. He came to the top tennis program in
the nation as part of the top recruiting class
in the nation; Wright and classmates Michael
Flanagan, Robert Devens, Chris Cocotos and
Vimal Patel were all top players on the junior
circuit, but none of the five saw much playing
time with Ail-Americans Alex O'Brien, Jared
Palmer and Jonathan Stark around.
The next year was more of the same as a
deep and talented Stanford team went on to
win the National Championship. Wright
sported a 3-1 record at No. 6 singles, and won
the Ojai Invitational doubles title with team
mate Roman Sydorak, but spent most of the
year unable to crack the lineup.
But Wright's junior year was completely
different.
"I started out the year ninth, but I played
some challenge matches," Wright says with a
shrug. "I did well."
With three challenge match victories,

Wright played himself into the lineup. At one
point, the junior won eight matches in a row,
finishing the year with a 13-5 record in sin
gles.
However, expectations for his senior year
soon turned sour. Over the summer, Wright
tore ligaments in his wrist and missed all the
challenge matches at the beginning of the
year. When Pacific 10 Indoor Champi
onships came around in January, Wright
had only been playing a few weeks. But
when offered a spot in the lineup due to
teammate Jim Thomas' injury, the hard-hit
ting baseliner made the most of his opportu
nity.
"I wasn't expecting to go — I only found
out that I was playing two days before,"
Wright said. "I played well, how, I don't
know."
Wright traveled to Pac-10 Indoors and
played with a loose, confident and aggressive
style, coming out on top of many tight match
es. When he returned to Stanford, he did so
as the champion of his singles draw.
Since then, Wright has not seen much
playing time for the Cardinal. Consistently
ranked either first or second in the nation for
the entire season, the Stanford squad has
made it difficult for many of the regulars —
including senior Ail-Americans Cocotos and
Patel — to hold onto their spots in the line
up.
However, Wright's contributions to the
team extend to practices and challenge
matches, pushing all the players, through
both motivation and example, to be the best
they can. Wright's work ethic is a perfect
example of Stanford tennis.
But that type of consistency, in play and in
practice, has been something that Gould has
come to expect of Wright.
"I'm always confident that if Billy is in
lineup, he'll play extremely well," Gould said.
"His game has really gone up a notch."
Wright agrees that his game has benefited
from his time at Stanford.
"I'm a smarter player, and I'm much bet
ter conditioned," Wright said. "And I got a
great education."
A political science major, Wright will be
attending USC Law School next year. He also
hopes to continue playing, either in local

tournaments or working out with
the Trojan collegiate team.
"He's great to work with,"
Gould said. "He kind of epitomizes
someone who works like crazy.

We're going to miss him a lot."
And Wright will miss Stanford.
But with his motivation and work
ethic, there's no telling where
Wright's endeavors on and off the
court will carry him.
"Maybe I'll be the first touring
pro with a law degree," Wright said
with a laugh. "I can play and do
some legal stuff on the side."
