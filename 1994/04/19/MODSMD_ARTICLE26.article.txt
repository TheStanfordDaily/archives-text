## Pitcher Steve Carlton oversteps bounds as sports legend with eccentric attitude 
### 
Steve Carlton will be inducted
into the Hall of Fame on July
31. Although this event
should mark the coup de gras of an
illustrious career, some unfortu
nate racist statements made
recently by the former Phillies
superstar will no doubt change
some people's opinions of him.
Whether these people ought to
think differently of Lefty Carlton is
another story.

Let's first be clear on what has
transpired thus far and why. Dur
ing his playing years, Carlton was
almost as famous for his silence off
the field as he was for his successes
on the mound. He turned down
interview requests on a regular
basis, thus enhancing his reputa
tion as someone who was some
what strange or, as we like to say at
Stanford, sketchy.
According to what Carlton's
good friend and former battery
mate Tim McCarver told Murray
Chass of The New York Times,
there was a reason why Carlton
acted the way he did.
"To say that Steve has a diffi
cult time relating is an understate
ment," McCarver said. "I don't
understand Lefty. I've known him
for three decades and I don't
understand him. He has a rich
sense of humor and a lot of good
qualities, but to try to explain his
eccentric views to anybody is not
one of his strengths."
Apparently, Carlton never cared
about what people thought about
him. Yet a rare interview with Pat
Jordan appearing in the April issue
of Philadelphia Magazine has led
some people to believe that indeed
Carlton did care â€” that his seasons
of silence were self-imposed forms
of risk containment, the risk being
that he might let slip his unortho
dox, "eccentric" political views.
Just what are his views?
According to the article written by
Jordan, Carlton said the world is
ruled or controlled by the Russian
and United States governments
which "fill the air with low-fre
quency sound waves," the Elders
of Zion, British intelligence agen

cies, 12 Jewish bankers meeting in
Switzerland and "a committee of
300 which meets at a roundtable in
Rome."
Add in his beliefs that President
Clinton has "a black son" he won't
acknowledge and that the AIDS
virus was created at a secret Mary
land biological warfare laboratory
"to get rid of gays and blacks," and
you get a picture of a deranged or
ignorant man, whose mind is, to
say the least, abounding in food for
thought.
Perhaps he thinks too much.
Afler all, his reclusive way of life
allows him ample time to read and
ruminate while at home in what
Jordan describes as a bunker in
Durango, Colo.
It is from his "bunker" that
Carlton communicates with the
Phillies organization, which last
Wednesday issued a statement
quoting Carlton as saying, "The
article has almost no truth in it."
But the damage has already
been done. Perhaps the value of
Carlton's 1965 Topps rookie base
ball card will modestly decline from
its current list price of $450. Factor
in the positive publicity of his
Cooperstown induction, however,
and the price fluctuations may can
cel each other out.
On a more serious note, the let
down being felt by Carlton's fans
may be irreversible. When I take
my kid to Cooperstown, how will I
be able to tell him or her in good
conscience about how I rooted for
Carlton to beat George Brett, pine
tar and all, and the Royals in the
first World Series I can remember,
but then neglecting to mention
that, by the way, Carlton is a
looney-toon who probably hates us
and everything we represent as
Jews.
Maybe I'll tell my kid about
Carlton's background. If I've
raised him to be a smart aleck (like
father, like son), he might respond,
"But Daddy, Charles Barkley says
on TV, 'Just because I can slam a
basketball, doesn't mean I should
raise your kids.'" He'd be on to
something there, but wouldn't
really be grasping what I'd be get
ting at.
That Carlton actually believes
in these myths is simply a testa
ment to his stupidity. Of course, we
quite regularly root for athletes
who are not the brightest people in
town. Jason Kidd took his SATs
seven times before achieving a
score of 710. For all we know, ath
letes who lack reasoning skills and
