# Looking on to the Final Four
## Lacrosse finishes fourth despite key injury 
### Emery Chen Staff writer 
While the Stanford women's
lacrosse team may be known for
its hard checks, the one given by
a UC-Santa Barbara player Sat
urday may have been to much
for the Cardinal to withstand.
With only a few minutes
remaining during the last game
on the first day of the Western
States tournament, senior co
captain Kate Applewhite was
injured on a check from behind.
Applewhite had pre-season
surgery to repair her torn rota
tor cuff and the blow re-aggra
vated the injury.
The injury could also be dev
astating to the Cardinal (8-1)
since the Northern California
Qualifying Tournament begins
Saturday while the Final Four
Tournament will be held the fol
lowing weekend.
Applewhite will probably not
be able to play in the qualifying
tournament but said she hopes

to be ready for the Final Four.
Physically the loss will be
hard to fill as Applewhite plays
point, the key defensive position
which is the last person before
the goalie. Mentally, however,
the injury may take a greater
toll.
"Kate is an enormous leader
on the team and the team is
more composed knowing that
she's back there," said Coach
Cecelia Paglia. "We desperately
need her and Kate at less than
full strength is better than what
most teams have."
The loss was evident as Stan
ford played well with Applewhite
on Saturday, defeating the East
Bay Club team and UC-Santa
Barbara and tying Colorado-
Boulder. However, without
Applewhite, the team lost to UC-
Davis and the Seattle Club team
on Sunday.
The Cardinal's first game was
against Colorado, and ended in a
6-6 tie. According to Paglia, the
team started out slow against

this good team, but gradually
improved.
The second game of the tour
nament was against the East
Bay Club team. The club team
was composed of former East
Coast college players who had
relocated to the East Bay. In
that contest, Stanford played
strong lacrosse and came out vic
torious by a score of 10-6.
Stanford saved its best
lacrosse of the day for the final
game, holding UC-Santa Bar
bara to only one goal while scor
ing five of its own. During the
latter two games, the Cardinal
passed well at midfield, stayed
composed throughout and had
balanced scoring.
The team had an added offen
sive surge from the defensive
wings on Saturday, helping Stan
ford from relying too much on
senior co-captain Jenn Watts.
Paglia said she was very pleased
with the work of freshman goalie
Hadley Abernathy, who allowed
only one Gaucho shot to get by her.

In the semi-finals on Sunday,
the Cardinal had to play against
UC-Davis without Applewhite.
Although Laura Dean did a good
job replacing her, according to
Paglia, the team lost 6-4.
"Stanford did not have the
offensive punch they needed,"
said Paglia. "We definitely could
have beat [UC-Davis]."
As on the day before, the Car
dinal started slow but recovered
in the second half to come close
to beating the Aggies. Paglia
remarked that the team was get
ting better and can defeat UC-
Davis, pointing out that the mar
gin of defeat against the Aggies
was shrinking, from seven dur
ing the Santa Barbara Shootout
to Sunday's two-goal loss.
In the consolation match Sun
day afternoon, Stanford took on a
tough Seattle Club team. The
coaches were pleased with the Car
dinal's performance against Seat
tle despite the loss, stating that the
