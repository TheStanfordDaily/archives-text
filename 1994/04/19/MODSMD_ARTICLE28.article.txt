# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
In a week rocked by potential scandal in
collegiate tennis, The Daily is happy to
turn its attention to more positive athlet
ic endeavors. Those endeavors happen to
be the efforts put forth by baseball catch
er A.J. Hinch and golfer Andrea Baxter.
Because of their exemplary showings,
they have been named the Athletes of the

Week.
Freshman Andrea Baxter, while occa
sionally overshadowed by classmate
Mhairi McKay, put together two excep
tional rounds on the links during the Cal
ifornia Collegiate last weekend to capture
second place.
Baxter, who hails from Eagle, Idaho,
shot 74-71-145 for the two-day tourna
ment to tie with McKay for second, one
shot behind San Jose State's Janice Mood
ie. Baxter put forth a strong charge over
the last four holes, scoring three birdies to
pull within one shot of Moodie.
With five Stanford golfers finishing in
the top ten, women's golf appears to have
returned to the Farm with a vengeance.

As we turn our attention from the
Stanford Golf Course across campus to
Sunken Diamond, we find our seoncd star
athlete. Hinch, a sophomore, had an excel
lent series against Cal this past weekend.
He was 7-of-12 at the plate and scored
four runs, including both game winners as
the Cardinal took two of three from the
Golden Bears.
Apparently, Cal was extremely worried
about Hinch on the basepaths, as he was
hit twice by errant throws during the "Big
Series." Such contact was of little worry
to Hinch since, as a catcher, he is used to
the occasional beanball.

A Midwest City, Okla. native, Hinch
has clearly shown why he is an Ail-Ameri
can candidate. After hitting .350 his fresh
man year, Hinch's average is at .333 this
year.
Surprisingly, Hinch has also stolen 12
bases in 18 attempts this year, while gun
ning down 44 of 74 opponent baserunners.
