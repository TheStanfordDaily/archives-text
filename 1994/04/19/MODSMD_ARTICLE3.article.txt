# CUE divided over CIV requirement

### Piers Hen wood 
In their third meeting of the quar
ter, members of the Commission on
Undergraduate Education agreed
upon the value of a year-long science
requirement, but were unable to
roach consensus with regard to the
Cultures, Ideas, and Values pro
gram, according to commission chair
and History Prof James Sheehan.
Yesterday's session, which was
devoted solely to the discussion of
Stanford's distribution require
ments and CIV program, focused on
the general questions surrounding
these two issues rather than the lo
gistics of specific goals.
"The purpose of these discus
sions is to get out on the table what
people agree with, what they don't

agree with, and what isn't as clear as
it should be," Sheehan said.
The report of the subcommittee
on breadth requirements, chaired
by Sheehan, presented earlier this
quarter had suggested a three-quar
ter course in the sciences as well as
requirements for two classes in the
social sciences and two in the hu
manities.
The year-long science require
ment, which would be designed to
give non-scientists a thorough intro
duction to both the natural and ap
plied sciences, received an "enthusi
astic response," according to Shee
han. The only potential problem that
such a program might face, Sheehan
said, would be one of feasibility.
