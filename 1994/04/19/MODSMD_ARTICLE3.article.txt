# CUE divided over CIV requirement
## 
### Piers Hen wood 
In their third meeting of the quar
ter, members of the Commission on
Undergraduate Education agreed
upon the value of a year-long science
requirement, but were unable to
roach consensus with regard to the
Cultures, Ideas, and Values pro
gram, according to commission chair
and History Prof James Sheehan.
Yesterday's session, which was
devoted solely to the discussion of
Stanford's distribution require
ments and CIV program, focused on
the general questions surrounding
these two issues rather than the lo
gistics of specific goals.
"The purpose of these discus
sions is to get out on the table what
people agree with, what they don't

agree with, and what isn't as clear as
it should be," Sheehan said.
The report of the subcommittee
on breadth requirements, chaired
by Sheehan, presented earlier this
quarter had suggested a three-quar
ter course in the sciences as well as
requirements for two classes in the
social sciences and two in the hu
manities.
The year-long science require
ment, which would be designed to
give non-scientists a thorough intro
duction to both the natural and ap
plied sciences, received an "enthusi
astic response," according to Shee
han. The only potential problem that
such a program might face, Sheehan
said, would be one of feasibility.
"I think it would be a good idea if
we could do it, but it's a big if," he
said. "It depends on whether the
University is willing to invest in it."
Junior Luz Herrera, the lone
undergraduate on the commission,
echoed this same concern, noting
that "the idea (of a year-long sci
ence requirement) won't work if
faculty aren't commiited." Howev
er, Herrera did point out that "a
core group of four or five faculty
members have already shown inter
est," leading her to believe that the
proposal is realistic.
The proposed science require
ment is part of a broader effort to
reorganize all breadth require
ments, including those relating to
the humanities and social sciences.
The problem, from Sheehan's per
spective, is that the current system
provides little relevance to most
students' chosen interests.
"DRs force students to think of
them as a series of individual cours

es," he said.
To rectify the apparent incon
gruence between certain require
ments and certain fields of study,
the commission discussed the pos
sibility of awarding minors that
would be partially fulfilled by dis
tribution requirements. The
details of such a scheme, however,
have not yet been clarified, Shee
han said.
Unlike the unified support
shown for the proposed science
requirement, discussion concerning
the CIV program was marked by
"considerable division," Sheehan
said.
The discussion centered around
the need for a greater emphasis on
American culture and world cul
tures, which are "underrepresent
ed," Herrera said. She added that a
potential solution would entail the
creation of two new CIV programs,
although the only conclusion actu
ally reached was that the commis
sion would "come back to (the
issue) later."
The commission will meet next
week to discuss current writing and
language requirements.
