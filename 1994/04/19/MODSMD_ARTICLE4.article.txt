# Giving a 'whole different perspective'
## Consultant hired to boost donations 
### Scott Van Winkle Staff writer 
Tryingto expand its fund-raising
efforts beyond cajoling donors to
"just say yes," the Office of Develop
ment has hired a former political
consultant to give its endeavors a
competitive edge.
"My job is really to determine for
sure why people give and why they
don't," said Jerold Pearson, the of
fice's new director of market re
search, in his sparsely furnished
Encina Hall office.
The new position, which is "still
evolving," stems from a belief, held
by Pearson and others in the office,
that the University needs to see
alumni giving as a "purchase deci
sion" similar to those consumers
make every day.
This "whole different perspec
tive" makes new research strate-

gies, such as focus
groups and phone
polls, a profitable
investment for
the University,
Pearson said.
Pearson, who
graduated from
Stanford in 1975,
said his aim is not
to "demean stu-

dents and alumni as a market to be
exploited," but rather to better un
derstand potential donors in order
to address their concerns.
Nevertheless, he said, "The nega
tive connotations of the phrase 'mar
ket research' have prevented univer
sities from doing market research"
in the past. That puts Stanford "way
in the forefront" in its efforts to un
derstand alumni concerns.

Citing statistics that show the
majority of alumni don't give to the
University, Pearson said, "The
most valuable stuff we can learn at
this point is why people don't
give."
While Pearson said the Univer
sity already has some "hypotheses"
as to why alumni don't give, he
said, "my job is to quantify the

work they've done."
By talking with "relevant hon
chos" in various University offices,
Pearson said he has identified "a
dozen or so" potential research
projects.
Pearson previously worked for a
public-opinion research firm, inves
tigating voter responses to specific
issues and ballot proposals, as well
as consumer product development.
He was hired by the Development
Office after he wrote a letter propos
ing the University conduct market
research into alumni giving.

This is just the beginning of a
long process of improving donation
rates, Pearson said. "Once the
strategy has been identified, the
implementation is what makes the
difference," he said.
Pearson expects the University
to eventually follow up his efforts
with new appeals to alumni or pos
sibly changes in what Stanford can
offer students.
He added that his position has
not added to the office's budget,
since the office reorganized its bud
get to accommodate it.
