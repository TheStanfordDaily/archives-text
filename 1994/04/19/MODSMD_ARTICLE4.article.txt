# Giving a 'whole different perspective'
## Consultant hired to boost donations 
### Scott Van Winkle Staff writer 
Tryingto expand its fund-raising
efforts beyond cajoling donors to
"just say yes," the Office of Develop
ment has hired a former political
consultant to give its endeavors a
competitive edge.
"My job is really to determine for
sure why people give and why they
don't," said Jerold Pearson, the of
fice's new director of market re
search, in his sparsely furnished
Encina Hall office.
The new position, which is "still
evolving," stems from a belief, held
by Pearson and others in the office,
that the University needs to see
alumni giving as a "purchase deci
sion" similar to those consumers
make every day.
This "whole different perspec
tive" makes new research strate-

gies, such as focus
groups and phone
polls, a profitable
investment for
the University,
Pearson said.
Pearson, who
graduated from
Stanford in 1975,
said his aim is not
to "demean stu-

dents and alumni as a market to be
exploited," but rather to better un
derstand potential donors in order
to address their concerns.
Nevertheless, he said, "The nega
tive connotations of the phrase 'mar
ket research' have prevented univer
sities from doing market research"
in the past. That puts Stanford "way
in the forefront" in its efforts to un
derstand alumni concerns.
