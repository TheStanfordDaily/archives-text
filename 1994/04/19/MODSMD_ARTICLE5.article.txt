# Students fight to end storm-drain dumping
## 
### Nereyda Salinas 
Stanford students were walking
around campus with spray-paint
cans and a mission Saturday after
noon.
But instead of vandalizing stu
dent property, their efforts were
aimed at improving the environ
ment by marking storm drains in
the Tresidder Union area with the
words "NO DUMPING - FLOWS
TC> RAY."
In some places there were al
ready worn-away signs from previ
ous years, while in others no such
warning had ever been stenciled â€”
allowing people to remain ignorant

as to the destination of liquids
dumped into the drains.
"Many people don't realize that
the waste that gets into storm
drains flows straight into the bay
untreated," said Rick Furtado, a Fa
cilities employee who led Saturday's
outing.
"People need to be made aware
that motor oil, paint products, de
tergents and other chemicals we use
get washed straight into the storm
drains, affecting the ecosystem.
They contribute to.. .pollution and
harm wildlife and fisheries."
Marjorie Lucks, a member of
Students for Environmental
Action at Stanford (SEAS), helped
arrange the day's event. "This out
ing was experimental," she said.
"We wanted to see how long it
takes to go through campus and
cover all of the storm drains in a
given area and also to see the kind
of student turnout we could get."

The student turnout was not
high. In addition to Lucks, there
were only two other students pre
sent.
"It was difficult to even get
SEAS people out here," Lucks said.
But even with only four people
working, they were able to spray 20
storm drains within three hours.
"A lot of people who do things for
environmental reasons don't get to
see the results of their
actions, "sophomore Rebecca Moyle
said.
