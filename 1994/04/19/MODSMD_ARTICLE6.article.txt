# Profs angered by lack of history Pulitzer

And the winner is... no one.
So those weren't the exact words of the
Pulitzer Prize Board. But its decision last week
not to award a prize in the history category for
this year had an equally unnerving effect on two
Stanford professors with great interest in the
process — one nominator, one nominee.
Only twice since the 1917 inception of the
Pulitzer — in 1919 and 1984 — had the board de
cided not to give out a history award. Board mem
ber John L. Dotson, Jr. told the Ix>s Angeles
Times that each of the finalists was "flawed in
certain ways."
Law Prof. Lawrence M. Friedman's book
"Crime and Punishment in American History"

was one of three books nominated for the his
tory prize. "Case Closed: Lee Harvey Oswald
and the Assassination of JFK" by Gerald Pos
ner and "William Faulkner and Southern His
tory" by Joel Williamson were the other final
ists.
History Dept. ('hair David Kennedy was a
member of t he three-member jury which recom
mended the books. 1 le said he was both surprised
and angered by the decision to ignore the jury's
recommendation.
" I was outraged because we made a good-faith
recommendation of the books we thought were
worthy," he said.
Much of Kennedy's frustration stemmed from
what he saw as a flawed selection process. The
jury was instructed to nominate either three
books or none. No other number was an option.

This procedure perplexed Kennedy and his col
leagues.
"We had opinions about the matter that we
were not able to communicate [with the board 1,"
he said.
Kennedy added that after the decision not to
award a prize was made, the board never ex
plained its rationale to the jury. He said he still
has "not a clue" as to why the board felt none of
the finalists were suitable.
Friedman, who is spending spring quarter as a
visiting professor at the University of Chicago,
said he too was very surprised by the board's ac
tion.
"I was very pleased to be honored by the pro
fessionals (thejury 1 and very disappointed by the
action of those who are not profes
sionals [the board]," he said. "It's
very rare. It may be unprecedent
ed.
"People are baffled," he contin
ued. "Members of the community

don't know [why the board made
its decision], I called my publisher,
thinking he might have some kind
of inside dope, and he said it was
completely mysterious. They
haven't given me any explanation,
and I'm sure they don't intend to."
The board has the absolute
right to go over the jury's head —
shifting nominees from one catego
ry to another, selecting a book not

on the list of finalists, or not award
ing a prize at all.
But the 1 tter option has rarely,
if ever, been exercised in the histo
ry category. Kennedy, who was a
member of the history jury in
1984, said that no prize was
awarded that year because none
were nominated. The circum
stances surrounding the 1919 case
were unknown.
