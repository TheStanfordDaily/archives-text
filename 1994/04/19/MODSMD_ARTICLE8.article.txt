# Co-op plans next year's relocation
## 
### Beth Berselli Staff writer 
When Synergy residents return
to campus next fall, they will move
into the newly renovated Cooksey
House instead of into the co-opera
tive's present location in Durand
House on the Row.
Synergy House Manager For
rest Melton said the primary rea
son for the move next fall is to "ex
pand" both the house and its com
munity with its focus on environ
mental ism.
Cooksey — which is located on
San Juan Hill near the Lou Henry
Hoover House — is larger than the
co-op's present home. The extra
space will allow for about 10 more
residents next year, bringing the
total up to about 43, Melton said.
"I see it as a really good chance
for the house to grow and put down
some roots. It's nice to hav6 a
chance to settle down again."
Melton said. "I hope that this will
be a rebirth for the house."
Others said the move would give
the house more isolation. "Our gar
den at Durand gets thrashed every
time Taxi has a party," said next
year's house manager Rachel Katz,

a sophomore. "In the old days, Syn
ergy had 20 chickens, a huge gar
den and a greenhouse. We'd like to
recapture that atmosphere." Katz
added that Durand will most likely
become a self-operative next year.
Despite the move, the co-op will
retain its original name. "Synergy
is more of a way of life than a par
ticular house," Katz said.
This move will be the co-op's
third since its founding in the early
'70s. The original Synergy house
off the Row was torn down by the

University after suffering exten
sive damage during the 1989 Loma
Prieta earthquake.
The co-op spent one year at
Grove before moving to its present
location three years ago.
Melton said he does not expect
next year's house rent or board bill
to increase.
Renovation of Cooksey has
already begun. "They're trying to
bring it back to its original histori
cal value," said Lori Carlucci, direc
tor of the Row Facilities. In addi

tion, the new house will be accessi
ble to students with disabilities.
Melton said funding for the ren
ovation "is coming from earth
quake relief funds and also from
the National Historical Society."
Synergy residents first heard
about the availability of Cooksey in
winter of 1992. They submitted a
proposal to the Office of Residential
Education in September 1993 and
met with University officials to dis
cuss how the new location could ben
efit both Synergy and the University.
