Preaching peace, love and un
derstanding, the Dalai Lama vis
ited campus yesterday to meet
with prominent University sci
entists and deliver a speech titled
"The Global Community and the
Need for Universal Responsibili
ty."
Addressing more than 1,000
people in Memorial Church, the
exiled Tibetan religious leader
expounded on everything from
global responsibility for environ
mental problems to the secret of
happiness.
"Taking care about ecology
... is not a question of luxury or
morality, but a question of our
own survival," the Dalai Lama
said. "If we are serious about our
thoughts of the future, of the fate
of the world, future generations
or the next century, it's only at
the global level that it will make
sense .. . not at the individual
nation level."
The Dalai Lama, 58, is consid
ered the living incarnation of the
Tibetan God of Compassion and
is the spiritual leader of 6 million
Tibetans around the world. After
the Chinese military squelched a
Tibetan revolt in 1959, he fled
his native land and established a
government-in-exile in India.
For the last 45 years, he has
been preaching non-violence to
achieve freedom for his people,
and in 1989 he was awarded the
Nobel Peace Prize.
Speaking mainly in his self
described "broken English," the
Dalai Lama talked about the im
portance of religious tolerance,
explaining that religion must
naturally include a variety of
ideas. Drawing a chuckle from
the crowd, he said that religion,
just like a supermarket or a
restaurant, must pffer variety.
"Like restaurants, selling all
the time just one dish, people
