# Dalai Lama urges diverse faiths
## Tibetan leader dazzles Mem Chu audience, chats with science profs 
### Julie Makinen Senior staff writer 
Preaching peace, love and un
derstanding, the Dalai Lama vis
ited campus yesterday to meet
with prominent University sci
entists and deliver a speech titled
"The Global Community and the
Need for Universal Responsibili
ty."
Addressing more than 1,000
people in Memorial Church, the
exiled Tibetan religious leader
expounded on everything from
global responsibility for environ
mental problems to the secret of
happiness.
"Taking care about ecology
... is not a question of luxury or
morality, but a question of our
own survival," the Dalai Lama
said. "If we are serious about our
thoughts of the future, of the fate
of the world, future generations
or the next century, it's only at
the global level that it will make
sense .. . not at the individual
nation level."
The Dalai Lama, 58, is consid
ered the living incarnation of the
Tibetan God of Compassion and
is the spiritual leader of 6 million
Tibetans around the world. After
the Chinese military squelched a
Tibetan revolt in 1959, he fled
his native land and established a
government-in-exile in India.
For the last 45 years, he has
been preaching non-violence to
achieve freedom for his people,
and in 1989 he was awarded the
Nobel Peace Prize.
Speaking mainly in his self
described "broken English," the
Dalai Lama talked about the im
portance of religious tolerance,
explaining that religion must
naturally include a variety of
ideas. Drawing a chuckle from
the crowd, he said that religion,
just like a supermarket or a
restaurant, must pffer variety.
"Like restaurants, selling all
the time just one dish, people

who come there naturally become
less and less. More variety, more
and more people come. ... More
variety of philosophy, religious tra
dition, more useful for people."
People must respect these vari
ety of ideas, said the Dalai Lama,
because all religions — regardless
of their differences — serve
humanity by giving people guide
lines by which to conduct them
selves.
While speaking generally on
religious tolerance, the Dalai Lama
also presented some of his specific
philosophical ideas, saying he
believes the purpose of human life
is happiness and it is "our right to
be a happy person, to overcome
suffering."
The key to achieving happiness,
he said, is neither material wealth

nor education, but one's mental
attitude. If one has the right kind
of mental attitude, "broad-mind
ed" and "steadfast," then one can
weather highs and lows more easi
ly, said the Dalai Lama.
Both happiness and collective
responsibility are rooted in human
nature, which is "gentleness" and
affection, he said. While anger,
hatred and jealousy are part of the
human mind, they are not "the
determining force."
This is evident, said the Dalai
Lama, because anger, hatred and
jealousy make body function "diffi
cult," while a gentle mind is in har
mony with the body, and "body
function becomes more smooth."
While avoiding discussion of
Tibet in his speech, the Dalai Lama
touched on the subject in a brief
question-and-answer session that
followed.
Although the Chinese govern
ment has tried to negotiate for his
return, "I have told them this is

not the basic issue," he said. "The
basic issue is 6 million Tibetan peo
ple's welfare and rights, environ
ment and culture.
"I feel from my side I made
every concession. ... I feel I've
made every attempt to open the
door to .. . full negotiation."
After concluding his remarks,
the Dalai Lama greeted a small con
tingent of Tibetans from the local
area who had gathered in the front
of the church. He shook hands and
embraced beaming onlookers as
others prayed at his feet.
"The one point I liked the most
was that money doesn't make you
happy, it's your heart," said sopho
more Meetpaul Singh, who received
a hug from the religious leader.
"I think what he said was world
ly-wise and would strike a chord
with many Stanford students,"
said Yu-Sheng Ng, Class of '91.
"He was pretty progressive. ... He
struck me more as a Humanist
than a Buddhist."

Earlier in the day, the Dalai
Lama met with several prominent
Stanford scientists who briefed
him on topics ranging from gene
therapy to cosmology and the Big
Bang theory. The religious leader
discussed Buddhist ethics as they
related to the topics and drew par
allels between Buddhist beliefs and
science.
"One of the fascinating
moments" of the morning, said
Molecular Pharmacology Prof.
Helen Blau, was when Physics
Prof. Stephen Chu was talking
about "macro- and microphysics"
and the Dalai asked about
physicists' definition of time and
space.
Time is "an embarrassing thing
to scientists," Chu conceded.
"[Chu) couldn't answer any bet
ter than the Buddhist, and so the
Buddhist and the physicist seemed
to agree to meet half-way," Blau
said.
After summarizing the Big

Bang theory and some new find
ings in atomic physics, Chu asked
the religious leader if he felt that
science was improperly infringing
on what used to be purely the
realm of religious thought.
"From a Buddhist point of view,
there is no fundamental incompat
ibility between the scientific
approach and the Buddhist
approach," said the Dalai Lama.
Describing two fundamental
principles of Buddhism, the Dalai
Lama said that in Buddhism, while
on one hand there is an "apprecia
tion of possible discrepancies
between appearance and reality,"
there is also "the acceptance that it
is only through analysis and exam
ination that one should accept"
ideas.
In fact, part of Buddhism's
appeal in the Western world, the
Dalai hypothesized, may be
due to its emphasis on understand
ing and investigation, rather than
blind faith.

"Buddha stated: my followers
should not accept my word out of
faith, out of respect, but rather
through investigation," the Dalai
Lama said. "Buddhist tradition
very much emphasizes investiga
tion. ... It is open to skepticism."
Dialogues such as yesterday's
are beneficial to both Buddhists
and scientists, the Dalai Lama said.
"To learn from scientists their lat
est findings in these fields to us is
very, very useful, very beneficial,"
he said afler the morning session.
"To the scientists, some Buddhist
explanations give them a new angle
to look at their respective fields."
Psychiatry Prof. David Spiegel,
who presented his research on
breast cancer to the Dalai Lama,
said the religious leader was "a
very impressive man."
"I wish all people as deeply
imbued with their religion as he is
would be as open-minded. His
questions were simple but very
deep and profound," Spiegel said.

who come there naturally become
less and less. More variety, more
and more people come. ... More
variety of philosophy, religious tra
dition, more useful for people."
People must respect these vari
ety of ideas, said the Dalai Lama,
because all religions — regardless
of their differences — serve
humanity by giving people guide
lines by which to conduct them
selves.
While speaking generally on
religious tolerance, the Dalai Lama
also presented some of his specific
philosophical ideas, saying he
believes the purpose of human life
is happiness and it is "our right to
be a happy person, to overcome
suffering."
The key to achieving happiness,
he said, is neither material wealth

nor education, but one's mental
attitude. If one has the right kind
of mental attitude, "broad-mind
ed" and "steadfast," then one can
weather highs and lows more easi
ly, said the Dalai Lama.
Both happiness and collective
responsibility are rooted in human
nature, which is "gentleness" and
affection, he said. While anger,
hatred and jealousy are part of the
human mind, they are not "the
determining force."
This is evident, said the Dalai
Lama, because anger, hatred and
jealousy make body function "diffi
cult," while a gentle mind is in har
mony with the body, and "body
function becomes more smooth."
While avoiding discussion of
Tibet in his speech, the Dalai Lama
touched on the subject in a brief
question-and-answer session that
followed.
Although the Chinese govern
ment has tried to negotiate for his
return, "I have told them this is

not the basic issue," he said. "The
basic issue is 6 million Tibetan peo
ple's welfare and rights, environ
ment and culture.
"I feel from my side I made
every concession. ... I feel I've
made every attempt to open the
door to .. . full negotiation."
After concluding his remarks,
the Dalai Lama greeted a small con
tingent of Tibetans from the local
area who had gathered in the front
of the church. He shook hands and
embraced beaming onlookers as
others prayed at his feet.
"The one point I liked the most
was that money doesn't make you
happy, it's your heart," said sopho
more Meetpaul Singh, who received
a hug from the religious leader.
"I think what he said was world
ly-wise and would strike a chord
with many Stanford students,"
said Yu-Sheng Ng, Class of '91.
"He was pretty progressive. ... He
struck me more as a Humanist
than a Buddhist."

Earlier in the day, the Dalai
Lama met with several prominent
Stanford scientists who briefed
him on topics ranging from gene
therapy to cosmology and the Big
Bang theory. The religious leader
discussed Buddhist ethics as they
related to the topics and drew par
allels between Buddhist beliefs and
science.
"One of the fascinating
moments" of the morning, said
Molecular Pharmacology Prof.
Helen Blau, was when Physics
Prof. Stephen Chu was talking
about "macro- and microphysics"
and the Dalai asked about
physicists' definition of time and
space.
Time is "an embarrassing thing
to scientists," Chu conceded.
"[Chu) couldn't answer any bet
ter than the Buddhist, and so the
Buddhist and the physicist seemed
to agree to meet half-way," Blau
said.
After summarizing the Big

Bang theory and some new find
ings in atomic physics, Chu asked
the religious leader if he felt that
science was improperly infringing
on what used to be purely the
realm of religious thought.
"From a Buddhist point of view,
there is no fundamental incompat
ibility between the scientific
approach and the Buddhist
approach," said the Dalai Lama.
Describing two fundamental
principles of Buddhism, the Dalai
Lama said that in Buddhism, while
on one hand there is an "apprecia
tion of possible discrepancies
between appearance and reality,"
there is also "the acceptance that it
is only through analysis and exam
ination that one should accept"
ideas.
In fact, part of Buddhism's
appeal in the Western world, the
Dalai hypothesized, may be
due to its emphasis on understand
ing and investigation, rather than
blind faith.

"Buddha stated: my followers
should not accept my word out of
faith, out of respect, but rather
through investigation," the Dalai
Lama said. "Buddhist tradition
very much emphasizes investiga
tion. ... It is open to skepticism."
Dialogues such as yesterday's
are beneficial to both Buddhists
and scientists, the Dalai Lama said.
"To learn from scientists their lat
est findings in these fields to us is
very, very useful, very beneficial,"
he said afler the morning session.
"To the scientists, some Buddhist
explanations give them a new angle
to look at their respective fields."
Psychiatry Prof. David Spiegel,
who presented his research on
breast cancer to the Dalai Lama,
said the religious leader was "a
very impressive man."
"I wish all people as deeply
imbued with their religion as he is
would be as open-minded. His
questions were simple but very
deep and profound," Spiegel said.
Preaching peace, love and un
derstanding, the Dalai Lama vis
ited campus yesterday to meet
with prominent University sci
entists and deliver a speech titled
"The Global Community and the
Need for Universal Responsibili
ty."
Addressing more than 1,000
people in Memorial Church, the
exiled Tibetan religious leader
expounded on everything from
global responsibility for environ
mental problems to the secret of
happiness.
"Taking care about ecology
... is not a question of luxury or
morality, but a question of our
own survival," the Dalai Lama
said. "If we are serious about our
thoughts of the future, of the fate
of the world, future generations
or the next century, it's only at
the global level that it will make
sense .. . not at the individual
nation level."
The Dalai Lama, 58, is consid
ered the living incarnation of the
Tibetan God of Compassion and
is the spiritual leader of 6 million
Tibetans around the world. After
the Chinese military squelched a
Tibetan revolt in 1959, he fled
his native land and established a
government-in-exile in India.
For the last 45 years, he has
been preaching non-violence to
achieve freedom for his people,
and in 1989 he was awarded the
Nobel Peace Prize.
Speaking mainly in his self
described "broken English," the
Dalai Lama talked about the im
portance of religious tolerance,
explaining that religion must
naturally include a variety of
ideas. Drawing a chuckle from
the crowd, he said that religion,
just like a supermarket or a
restaurant, must pffer variety.
"Like restaurants, selling all
the time just one dish, people
