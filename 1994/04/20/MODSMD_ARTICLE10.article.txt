PRETORIA, South Africa (AP)
Zulu leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi broke
a political deadlock yesterday by agreeing
to take part in next week's election, giv
ing South Africa its first hope of peaceful
balloting and an end to years of violence.
"This agreement is a leap forward for
peace. ... A bright future awaits our
land," African National Congress leader
Nelson Mandela declared after a two-day
summit culminated in the announce
ment.
Mandela, Buthelezi and President
F.W. de Klerk struck a deal whereby
Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party will
be added to the ballots for the April 26-28

elections. Buthelezi had threatened to
boycott the vote unless he won guaran
tees of autonomy for his black homeland.
"We had to carry them into this agree
ment kicking and screaming. .. It's good
for South Africa. Let the violence now
stop," de Klerk told a campaign rally in
Port Elizabeth late yesterday.
Buthelezi also had demanded the elec
tion be delayed to give Inkatha more cam
paign time, and a security crackdown
across the Zulu stronghold of eastern
Natal province be lifted.
But he decided it was more prudent to
enter the election at the last minute than
boycott it and be left out of the country's

first black-led government.
The only concession made by the ANC
and government was to amend the con
stitution to recognize Zulu King Goodwill
Zwelethini as traditional monarch of the
KwaZulu-Natal region.
This proposal, offered earlier, means
the all-white Parliament will be sum
moned to Cape Town a final time Monday
to approve the change.
A post-apartheid constitution
approved in December by black groups
and white groups failed to satisfy
Buthelezi's demands for autonomy and
prompted Inkatha to announce an elec
tion boycott.
