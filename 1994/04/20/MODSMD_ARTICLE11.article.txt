## Clinton sends support to Bosnia 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — President
Clinton is sending new military and
diplomatic initiatives to the NATO
allies to consider this week to try to halt
the Bosnian Serb drive on Muslim
enclaves.
"They include U.S. support for U.N.
Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-
Ghali's proposal to broaden NATO
authority to use air power and one by
Clinton to stiffen economic curbs on
Serbia," a senior administration official
said yesterday.
"We would expect we can work them
through," the North Atlantic Council
meeting to be held later in the week in
Brussels, Belgium, the official said. He
provided no further details of what
Clinton endorsed after two sessions
with his senior advisers on foreign poli
cy.
Russia and the United Nations also
will be consulted, said the official, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
The mix of diplomacy and threat of
force so far has not deterred the Serbs
from their assault on Gorazde, a mostly

Muslim enclave in eastern Bosnia. The
plight of the 65,000 civilians was dis
cussed by the president and his advis
ers, the official said.
Anthony Lake, the president's
national security adviser, said mean
while: "The use of power without diplo
macy is purposeless, and the use of
power without diplomacy will fail."
Clinton, in exchanges with reporters
earlier, gave no clearer idea what he was
asking the NATO allies to endorse.
Mindful, perhaps, of European reluc
tance to take strong measures, Clinton
said: "We simply must not be on record
for any policy we are not prepared to fol
low through."
The President also said he was con
sidering a proposal by Russian Presi
dent Boris Yeltsin for an international
summit on Bosnia, though he also called
the idea premature.
Concurring, the official said the pro
posal "has some potential," but that a
conference required considerable prepa
ration.
In New York, Boutros-Ghali asked

NATO to authorize air strikes to protect
all the U.N.-designated "safe areas" in
Bosnia.
Clinton said: "We're discussing
exactly how that would be done and, of
course, whether the other NATO allies
would be willing to do it and what the
ups and downs would be and what else
we could do to get this thing going."
On the sidelines, urging him to pro
ceed, House Democratic Whip David E.
Bonior of Michigan said, "It's time to
use the full weight of U.S. and NATO
warplanes in Bosnia. It's time to
pound the Bosnian Serbs into submis
sion."
Russian diplomats quit their efforts
to cajole the Serbs into withdrawing
from Gorazde where 65,000 civilians
fear a wave of "ethnic cleansing."
Yeltsin, in a statement in Moscow,
accused Serb leaders of reneging on a
pledge to cease fighting and withdraw
from the U.N.-designated haven. He
proposed a summit involving the United
States, Russia, the European Union and
the United Nations.
