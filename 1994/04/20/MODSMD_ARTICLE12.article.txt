King receives $3.8 million
LOS ANGELES (AP) - The jury in
Rodney King's civil lawsuit awarded him
$3.8 million in compensatory damages
from the city of Los Angeles yesterday
for his 1991 police beating.
The award was significantly below the
$15 million sought by King's lawyers but
well above the $800,000 the city said was
a fair sum.
King was not present in the court
room for the jury's verdict, which came
on the fourth day of deliberations.
A second phase of the trial, to
begin immediately, will determine

punitive damages.
No sex discrimination
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” The Supreme
Court, decrying "archaic and overbroad
stereotypes" about men and women, yes
terday outlawed the practice of excluding
people from juries just because of their sex.
Such gender-based exclusions are as
wrong as keeping people ofTjuries based on
their race, the court said in a 6-3 decision.
"Gender, like race, is an unconstitu
tional proxy for juror competence and
impartiality," Justice Harry A. Black
mun wrote for the court.
