## Editorial A 						budgetary circus Bungling of MEChA budget signals need for increased oversight 
### 
A SEVENTEEN THOUSAND
dollar mistake is hard to
overlook.
Yet members of the campus Chi
cano/Latino student organization
MEChA apparently did just that
with their ASSU special-fee
request, which voters rejected by a
small margin last week.
Last Tuesday MEChA's leaders
suddenly realized that the group's
requested amount on the ballot —
$56,495.80 — was off. By a lot.
Specifically, the amount was
$16,948.95 more than the figure
the group said they actually sub
mitted to the ASSU.
The details surrounding the
mistake — and the group's failure
to correct it given several opportu
nities — make the three stooges
seem competent.
ASSU rules allow groups to
include up to a 30 percent "buffer"
in their budgets to compensate for
expected fee refunds. In MEChA's
case, however, the group's budget
was inflated twice — once as mem
bers calculated each line item, and
again by the ASSU Appropriations
Committee, which tacked on
another 30 percent as a lump sum
at the bottom of the budget.
According to group leaders and
members of the Appropriations
Committee, the mistake was dis
cussed when the Appropriations
Committee first went over the bud
get MEChA submitted, but neither
MEChA nor the ASSU Appropria
tions Committee actually acted to
correct the mistake.
Since more than one group was
involved, it's difficult — and prob
ably unfair — to assess any blame
for the mistake at that point in
time.
Still, things didn't get any better
when the full senate met Feb. 15 to
OK MEChA's fee request for place

ment on the ballot. In fact, no one
even mentioned the inflated error,
which was plainly printed at the
bottom of the group's request.
MEChA's two treasurers left
before the groups' fee request came
up for discussion.
So the wrong budget was sent on
to the Elections Commission,
which placed it in the draft copy of
the Elections Handbook. Again,
the group was given an opportuni
ty to fix the mistake — printouts of
all pages of the handbook were left
in the ASSU's office for candidates
and groups to check before the
final copy was sent to the printer.
But there was no protest — and no
change.
The week before the election,
thousands of handbooks were dis
tributed around campus, each one
saying that MEChA was request
ing $56,495.80 for its special fee.
Based on that figure — which
would have represented a $20,000
fee increase over last year — The
Daily's editorial board voted to give
the group's request a "no" recom
mendation. (When The Daily met
with MEChA representatives, the
error was not mentioned.)
Only after The Daily printed its
endorsements did MEChA appar
ently realize what had happened.
Unfortunately, it was too late to fix
the ballot. The Daily changed its
endorsement the next day to reflect
the lower figure.
The comedy of errors that led to
this fiasco might seem somewhat
humorous. However, there was an
unhappy ending — MEChA lost its
special fee by a small margin.
Perhaps there could have been
greater oversight to catch the error
before it made it all the way
through the ASSU and onto the
ballot. This responsibility ulti
mately rested with the group's
leaders. Others could not have
caught the mistake, since they did
not know that all the figures were
pre-inflated.
The failure to promptly correct
this $17,000 error may have cost
the group much more in the long
run.
