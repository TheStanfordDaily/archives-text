## Succeed, but don't forget 
### 
I HATE Connie Chung. All right, so
"hate" is a strong word, but this goes
beyond a healthy jealousy of her
money, fame, success and Maury Povich
(as if). Yes, she wears too much eye make
up and all the publicity about her trying
to get pregnant didn't help either, but
I've been harboring a more deeply-seeded
grudge for quite a while now against this
woman I've never met.
As the first visibly successful Asian-
American female journalist and perhaps
the most recognized Asian-American
woman, period, Connie Chung's actions
become highly representative of those
who share her race and gender. To say
the least, I am not ecstatic about the idea
of being associated with her.
Many Asian-American journalists
begrudge Chung's dismissal of her ethnic
ties after she became successful because
she thought they might weigh her down.
She made this decision after she had net
worked within the community early in
her career.
Several years ago, Chung was assigned
to do an on-location special about China.
When she was interviewed on television,
she joked about her trip, saying, "I don't
know how I'm going to find my relatives
there. Everyone looks alike." Excuse me,
Connie?
So maybe I need to make a few con
cessions. After all, Connie Chung never
asked to bear the burden of all Asian-
American womanhood, or even all
Asian-American female journalists. So

can we really put the responsibility of
representing an entire community on an
individual?
The dilemma becomes more difficult
when we address artists — particularly
popular writers, filmmakers and actors
— and their responsibility to their com
munities. At one level, it seems that all
artists' creative inspirations and choices
should be theirs and theirs alone, and to
impose the burden of representing their
race or any other community is not only
unfair, but against the principles of
artistic expression.
Yet both Amy Tan and Maxine Hong
Kingston are criticized for their portray
als of brutal, misogynist Chinese men and
their exotic pictures of Chinese culture.
Directors of the recent wave of Asian-
American movies (including "The Joy
Luck Club," "Heaven and Earth" and
"Golden Gate") and of the Broadway
musical "Miss Saigon" have been
attacked time and time again for roman
ticizing the white male- Asian woman
pairing, particularly in ways that rein
force stereotypes of the asexual Asian
male and exotic, subservient (thus desir
able) Asian female.
Similarly, the actor who played the
grossly stereotyped Asian exchange stu
dent Long Duck Dong in "Sixteen Can
dles" has explained that though he
detested the role, he was a struggling
actor who needed the money and the
part.
So the question is whether or not the

way these public figures' actions are per
ceived by the masses overrides their per
sonal intentions and messages (or lack
thereof). Can we argue with Amy Tan
when she says she is just writing about
Chinese culture as she has experienced
it? But can we ignore the impact of her
novels on the already-skewed perceptions
of many?
Similarly, I cannot reconcile my own
frustration with many of Connie Chung's
choices with her right to make her own
career decisions.
But maybe Chung's decision to speak
at last summer's Asian-American jour
nalists national convention and to pub
licly apologize in her speech for being
"terribly remiss" to her own ethnic com
munity indicates that, beyond should or
should not, we people of color — or mem
bers of any community, for that matter
— cannot fully escape the burden of rep
resentation.
We can talk of fair and unfair, but in
the end, for artists, journalists, or any
public and private figures, it all comes
with the territory.

Angie's sources at Stanford in Oxford
agree not only that Abhi Katyal is a better
representative than Connie Chung, but
also that he's better looking too.
