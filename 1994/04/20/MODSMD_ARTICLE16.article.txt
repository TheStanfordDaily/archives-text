# Letter
## University must reconcile Burciaga's loss, meet demands 
### 
Editor's Note: The following letter to
Provost Condoleezza Rice was submitted
to The Daily yesterday for publication.
Members of the Chicano community,
including the Chicano Graduate Student
Association, will meet with Rice today at
5:30 p.m. at El Centro Chicano.
WE, THE CHICANO Graduate
Student Association, are writing
to express our outrage at your
firing of Cecilia Burciaga on March 30.
As members of the Chicana/o communi
ty, we feel that Cecilia's layoff consti
tutes an act of disrespect to her and to
the entire Stanford community.
Despite the climate of budget cuts,
her 20 years of service to the University
merited promotion rather than callous
dismissal. With her departure, we lose
the historical memory that informed
her position as the conscience of the
Stanford administration and communi
ty for the past 20 years. In expressing
our shock, we join with everyone in the
Stanford community, especially organi
zations of students, faculty of color, and
ethnic centers, who have drawn
strength from Cecilia's role as our most
genuine representative in the Stanford
administration.
Cecilia's firing puts in jeopardy the
enormous gains Chicanos/as and all
marginalized groups have made at
Stanford under the guidance and lead
ership of the Burciagas as they pursued
a vision of a truly diverse and empow
ered institution of learning. To date the
University has offered no plan for fill
ing the gaps left by the Burciagas' dis
missal. No single response by the Stan
ford administration will replace Cecilia
and Antonio Burciagas' invaluable ser
vice to the University community, but
we hold the administration responsible
for filling the gaps left by Cecilia's fir
ing in the following areas:
1. Representation in the University
administration
We, the Chicana/o graduate stu-

dents, need voices in the decision-mak
ing processes which define our member
ship to Stanford. More than any other
administrator, Burciaga has been that
voice. Through her ability to create
community across lines of difference,
Burciaga has enabled the Chicana/o
presence on campus to serve as a
resource and support for others at the
University and beyond.
Therefore, we want to see new
appointments going to members of the
Chicano/Latino community who could
play the role of advocate and communi
cator Cecilia has played. We need
administrators informed about the par
ticular history of Chicanos/as at Stan
ford who will bring our interests to the
administration of the University.
2. Preservation of Casa Zapata
The administration must make a
public statement of commitment to the
preservation of Casa Zapata as it has
functioned under the vision of the Bur
ciagas. We are disturbed that Antonio
Burciaga's role as educator, mentor and
artist/writer-in-residence has gone
unacknowledged by the administration
in the firing of Cecilia. During his
tenure as resident fellow, Antonio has
authored several books and created
spectacular murals, always engaging
students and Stanford in his artistic
creation.
The Casa Zapata murals must be
preserved. They constitute important
testament to the vitality of the Chi
cano presence at Stanford, and its con
nection to the greater Chicano/Latino
community. Therefore we demand that
funds be allocated for programming
and a program coordinator to assist in
the transition to the new RFs. In order
to preserve the integrity of Casa Zapa
ta's function, the RF position should
be filled by a Chicano faculty member
who may not be as easily dismissed as
staff.
3. Support for El Centro Chicano
and all ethnic centers

We know that there can be no com
mitment to the recruitment and reten
tion of students and faculty of color
without a corresponding commitment
to the functioning of the ethnic centers.
We demand a firing freeze: the staff
of the ethnic centers cannot carry out
their work in a climate of fear that
makes them vulnerable to the actions
we've witnessed in the firings of Cecilia
Burciaga and Magarita Ibarra, the
administrative assistant for University
Events and Services.
The University cannot continue to
burden existing staff with new tasks
and responsibilities. Therefore, we ask
that the University follow through with
its previous commitment to create a
third staff position at El Centro.
Given the administration's initiatives
for the recruitment and retention of
graduate students of color, we demand
an end to the budget cuts to the centers
which play the central role in maintain
ing our presence on campus. Indeed,
priority must be given to allocating
resource in the form of program funds
and staff positions to meet the demands
placed by students, staff, faculty and
administrators on the centers.
4. Graduate studies
At the recent Minority Graduate
Student Recruitment Weekend, we all
heard administrators responsible for
Cecilia's firing declare their "commit
ment to diversity at Stanford." We, the
Chicano graduate students, have a
vision of how this commitment may be
institutionalized.
A) We demand that the University
create administrative positions for the
active recruitment and retention of
graduate students of color to meet and
surpass the recommendations of the
report of the University Committee on
Minority Issues and the Provost's Com
mittee on Recruitment, Retention, and
Graduation of Minority Graduate Stu
dents (CRRGMGS). We envision an
office where every minority group

would be represented by a recruitment
officer who would track individual
departments of the various schools'
progress in the recruitment and reten
tion of students of color.
B) We demand that the University
meet all the recommendations of the
Provost's CRRGMGS, chaired by
George Dekker.
The recent television coverage, radio
shows and letters to local papers about
Burciaga's layoff are testimony not only
to the importance of her presence at
Stanford, but also to the depth of peo
ple's concern for communities of color
in higher education. It is now up to the
Stanford administration to find an
answer to the questions that emerge
from this crisis of confianza y respeto
(confidence and respect).
While we recognize that no easy
solution is in sight to the problems
we've touched on, we want to express
our commitment to pursuing the Burci
agas' vision of making Stanford a true
institution of learning.
We refuse to let our communities be
governed by the cynical language of
budgetary efficiency. In this budget cri
sis we need to know where our wealth
lies. It will not be found in the coffers
of Stanford's endowment, but in the
hearts and works of people like Cecilia
and Antonio Burciaga.

While we recognize that no easy
solution is in sight to the problems
we've touched on, we want to express
our commitment to pursuing the Burci
agas' vision of making Stanford a true
institution of learning.
We refuse to let our communities be
governed by the cynical language of
budgetary efficiency. In this budget cri
sis we need to know where our wealth
lies. It will not be found in the coffers
of Stanford's endowment, but in the
hearts and works of people like Cecilia
and Antonio Burciaga.

Editor's Note: The following letter to
Provost Condoleezza Rice was submitted
to The Daily yesterday for publication.
Members of the Chicano community,
including the Chicano Graduate Student
Association, will meet with Rice today at
5:30 p.m. at El Centro Chicano.
WE, THE CHICANO Graduate
Student Association, are writing
to express our outrage at your
firing of Cecilia Burciaga on March 30.
As members of the Chicana/o communi
ty, we feel that Cecilia's layoff consti
tutes an act of disrespect to her and to
the entire Stanford community.
Despite the climate of budget cuts,
her 20 years of service to the University
merited promotion rather than callous
dismissal. With her departure, we lose
the historical memory that informed
her position as the conscience of the
Stanford administration and communi
ty for the past 20 years. In expressing
our shock, we join with everyone in the
Stanford community, especially organi
zations of students, faculty of color, and
ethnic centers, who have drawn
strength from Cecilia's role as our most
genuine representative in the Stanford
administration.
Cecilia's firing puts in jeopardy the
enormous gains Chicanos/as and all
marginalized groups have made at
Stanford under the guidance and lead
ership of the Burciagas as they pursued
a vision of a truly diverse and empow
ered institution of learning. To date the
University has offered no plan for fill
ing the gaps left by the Burciagas' dis
missal. No single response by the Stan
ford administration will replace Cecilia
and Antonio Burciagas' invaluable ser
vice to the University community, but
we hold the administration responsible
for filling the gaps left by Cecilia's fir
ing in the following areas:
1. Representation in the University
administration
We, the Chicana/o graduate stu-

dents, need voices in the decision-mak
ing processes which define our member
ship to Stanford. More than any other
administrator, Burciaga has been that
voice. Through her ability to create
community across lines of difference,
Burciaga has enabled the Chicana/o
presence on campus to serve as a
resource and support for others at the
University and beyond.
Therefore, we want to see new
appointments going to members of the
Chicano/Latino community who could
play the role of advocate and communi
cator Cecilia has played. We need
administrators informed about the par
ticular history of Chicanos/as at Stan
ford who will bring our interests to the
administration of the University.
2. Preservation of Casa Zapata
The administration must make a
public statement of commitment to the
preservation of Casa Zapata as it has
functioned under the vision of the Bur
ciagas. We are disturbed that Antonio
Burciaga's role as educator, mentor and
artist/writer-in-residence has gone
unacknowledged by the administration
in the firing of Cecilia. During his
tenure as resident fellow, Antonio has
authored several books and created
spectacular murals, always engaging
students and Stanford in his artistic
creation.
The Casa Zapata murals must be
preserved. They constitute important
testament to the vitality of the Chi
cano presence at Stanford, and its con
nection to the greater Chicano/Latino
community. Therefore we demand that
funds be allocated for programming
and a program coordinator to assist in
the transition to the new RFs. In order
to preserve the integrity of Casa Zapa
ta's function, the RF position should
be filled by a Chicano faculty member
who may not be as easily dismissed as
staff.
3. Support for El Centro Chicano
and all ethnic centers

We know that there can be no com
mitment to the recruitment and reten
tion of students and faculty of color
without a corresponding commitment
to the functioning of the ethnic centers.
We demand a firing freeze: the staff
of the ethnic centers cannot carry out
their work in a climate of fear that
makes them vulnerable to the actions
we've witnessed in the firings of Cecilia
Burciaga and Magarita Ibarra, the
administrative assistant for University
Events and Services.
The University cannot continue to
burden existing staff with new tasks
and responsibilities. Therefore, we ask
that the University follow through with
its previous commitment to create a
third staff position at El Centro.
Given the administration's initiatives
for the recruitment and retention of
graduate students of color, we demand
an end to the budget cuts to the centers
which play the central role in maintain
ing our presence on campus. Indeed,
priority must be given to allocating
resource in the form of program funds
and staff positions to meet the demands
placed by students, staff, faculty and
administrators on the centers.
4. Graduate studies
At the recent Minority Graduate
Student Recruitment Weekend, we all
heard administrators responsible for
Cecilia's firing declare their "commit
ment to diversity at Stanford." We, the
Chicano graduate students, have a
vision of how this commitment may be
institutionalized.
A) We demand that the University
create administrative positions for the
active recruitment and retention of
graduate students of color to meet and
surpass the recommendations of the
report of the University Committee on
Minority Issues and the Provost's Com
mittee on Recruitment, Retention, and
Graduation of Minority Graduate Stu
dents (CRRGMGS). We envision an
office where every minority group

would be represented by a recruitment
officer who would track individual
departments of the various schools'
progress in the recruitment and reten
tion of students of color.
B) We demand that the University
meet all the recommendations of the
Provost's CRRGMGS, chaired by
George Dekker.
The recent television coverage, radio
shows and letters to local papers about
Burciaga's layoff are testimony not only
to the importance of her presence at
Stanford, but also to the depth of peo
ple's concern for communities of color
in higher education. It is now up to the
Stanford administration to find an
answer to the questions that emerge
from this crisis of confianza y respeto
(confidence and respect).
While we recognize that no easy
solution is in sight to the problems
we've touched on, we want to express
our commitment to pursuing the Burci
agas' vision of making Stanford a true
institution of learning.
We refuse to let our communities be
governed by the cynical language of
budgetary efficiency. In this budget cri
sis we need to know where our wealth
lies. It will not be found in the coffers
of Stanford's endowment, but in the
hearts and works of people like Cecilia
and Antonio Burciaga.
