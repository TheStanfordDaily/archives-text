## Dismissal of Burciaga cannot not erase issues 
### 
We the members of the Women's
Center Collective, wish to express our
deep regret that Stanford has chosen to
let go one of our most inspiring and
committed community leaders, Cecilia
Burciaga.
The article in the April 1 Daily indi
cated Burciaga's position was eliminated
because of budget cuts. We feel an indi
vidual who has given so much leadership
and love to the Stanford community
should not be dismissed so easily. As
women, as members or allies of the Chi
cano community and as students, we
value her forceful presence, and we are
enraged that this administration has
shown no such value or respect.
For the last 20 years, Cecilia has been
a role model for students, staff and fac
ulty. She has been a resident fellow,
with her husband, Tony, in Casa Zapata,
an advocate for students in numerous
staff capacities and a strong voice for the
concerns of the Chicano and women's
communities. She has served on the
Women's Center Advisory Board since
its inception in 1991, and remains one of
the strongest, most committed advo
cates for women's issues on this campus.
This academic year alone, she has not
only attended, but actively participated
in several vital Women's Center pro
grams: the frosh orientation panel, the

open forum on the budget cuts and a
Strategic Planning session. In addition,
she consistently ofTers her insight,
humor and support at community-build
ing gatherings such as Women's Center
open houses, Herstory events and coali
tion building sessions between student
groups.
As young people beginning profes
sional or academic careers and continu
ing the struggle for equality, we thank
Cecilia for her unique ability to foster
collective leadership. Cecilia encouraged
the importance of collective responsibili
ty in creating this University communi
ty. She communicated a respect for our
experiences as students and an invest
ment in our growth as people and com
munity leaders.
In her capacity as associate dean and
development officer in the Office of Stu
dent Affairs, Cecilia Burciaga has ful
filled her mission well. She has continu
ously advocated on behalf of students.
She has fought for the necessary, con
tinuing self-assessment of Stanford's
commitment to diversity by speaking
out against Casper and the Faculty Sen
ate's refusal to pass the "Statement on
Diversity" put out by the Western Asso
ciation of Schools and Colleges.
She has fought for the needs of grad
uate students by speaking out against
the decentralization of Graduate Ser
vices.
She has fought for the right of stu
dents to have a voice in decisions by
speaking out against the lack of open

communication between the administra
tion and the student body.
She has fought for the Chicano com
munity for 20 years, most recently by
urging the administration to honor its
verbal commitment to multiculturalism
by fully funding the ethnic centers. She
has fought for the concerns of women
students by insisting that the University
prioritize women's issues. She has
repeatedly stressed the urgent need for
staff at Women's Center, and the impor
tance for other student organizations to
reflect women's contributions and
issues. Cecilia fought for these things in
a relentless but loving effort to improve
the Stanford community.
No longer will we be fooled by the
excuses offered for administrative deci
sions: the true cause of the layoff of
Cecilia Burciaga was not budget cuts. If
this administration values individuals
like Burciaga and the ideals for which
she fights, they should not be so quick to
let her go. The cross-cultural, inter-com
munity love and leadership Cecilia has
given to this University community is
worth much more than the money that
will be saved by cutting her position.
In fact, we think such an enormous
contribution to a community cannot be
measured in monetary terms. Moreover,
the critical issues that Cecilia and indi
viduals like her have unapologetically
raised will not go away, because these
are student issues. And as the life force
of this institution, we will not stop fight
ing for them: a faculty resident fellow in

Zapata; greater representation of Chi
canos/as and other people of color in
higher administration; retention of
women faculty; full staffing and support
for the community resource centers: the
Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Center, the
Disabilities Resource Center, the
Women's Center, the ethnic centers;
concrete support for graduate women;
and open and complete communication
between all levels of the administration
and the concerned student body.
