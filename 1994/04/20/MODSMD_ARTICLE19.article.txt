# Endorsements could inhibit voter decisions
## 
### 
I'm writing in response to yesterday's
editorial piece, "Why newspapers can
and should make endorsements."
I believe The Daily has a right to pro
nounce its endorsements. However, I
also believe there are legitimate ques
tions regarding those endorsements.
There are a couple of factors that
makes Daily endorsements different
from ordinary endorsements by newspa
pers during election time.
First, The Daily itself asked for ASSU
special fees. While The Daily wisely and
rightfully refrained from offering an

endorsement of its own special-fee
request, it can be argued that because
The Daily is involved in the process, this
makes it less than a totally independent
party that can offer absolutely unbiased
opinions on the appropriateness of other
special-fee requests, that compete for
the electorate's attention.
Much more importantly, The Daily is
the only major newspaper, in fact, the
only media channel (KZSU and SCBN
both having a comparatively small
reach) where endorsements and differ
ent opinions could reach a wide audience
on campus. By refusing to let groups
respond to your (non)endorsements, one
begins to wonder whether you're abus
ing your unique position on campus.
The Daily's editorial piece argues it
has no legal obligation to let other peo
ple respond to your opinions. But I
believe The Daily has a moral obligation,
especially due to its special position, to
let diverse viewpoints be heard, and
encourage discussion and debate,
instead of monopolizing the airwaves.
Wouldn't it be more productive for
The Daily to state a group's position —
instead of providing endorsements of
particular causes and programs — then
step aside and provide a forum in which
different people and different interest
groups could argue and present their
respective views? Then you could let the
voters decide, instead of attempting to
make the decisions for all of us.
