## First Jewish Arts Festival begins today 
### Nina Wasow 
A multimedia collage — part jigsaw puzzle
and part painting — celebrating Zionism and
family is one of the many types of art that will
be displayed at Stanford's first Jewish Arts
Festival.
Submissions by 10 Jewish student artists
will be exhibited for approximately six weeks
starting today.
Other mediums submitted include paint
ing, essays, poetry, collage, calligraphy, a bib
liography of illustrated Yiddish books, ornate
ritual objects and personal narrative.
The grand prize will be $500 and two run
ners-up will be awarded gift certificates to
Bob and Bob Judaica Shop in Palo Alto,
which also sponsored the festival through ad
vertising.
The festival is being coordinated by Stan
ford Hillel, and is co-sponsored by the Office of
the Dean of Humanities and Sciences, the Jew
ish Students' Association and the program in
Jewish Studies. Hillel approached each of
them for academic or financial support.

Art was reviewed by a panel of five judges.
"They picked pieces that illustrated the way
that Judaism has afTected their lives," said
Michael Latz, the assistant program director
of Hillel. The jurors were English Prof. John
Felstiner, Art Lecturer Ruth Kedar, Judaica
Curator at Green Library Roger Kohn, Art
Prof. Joel Leivick and sophomore Jessica
Cohen.
Cohen said the panel looked for pieces that
showed pride in the past and present of Ju
daism.
"It's easier for Jews to assimilate than
other groups because we look the same — Ju
daism is about the foods you eat, and where
you live and going to services. . . . Many of us
are not forced to deal with it every day," she
said. "We looked for people who showed that
Judaism is a positive, not just assimilating
factor, and if it {the art] gave us food for
thought."
While being Jewish was not a requirement
for entering the contest, all ten submissions
were made by Jews. "The art
reflects Judaism and their experi
ences as Jews," said Latz.
The art conveyed a variety of
messages, mostly reflecting Zionism
— the support of a Jewish home
land in Israel — and family. "Most
were saying that it's a big effort, a
legacy — there is great responsibility
in being a Jew," said Cohen.
Junior Derek Isaacowitz wrote
a poem for the festival. "It's about
an experience I had in the New
York airport on the way to Israel
that related to being in a Jew in the

community. It's hard to explain,"
he said.
Isaacowitz said he wrote the
poem specifically for the contest.
"I've never been that involved in
creative work, but I decided it
might be a worthwhile thing to try,
or a unique experience," he said.
Latz said there has never been a
Jewish arts festival like this
before. Preliminary plans for the
festival began last fall. "We were
brainstorming at a committee
meeting, thinking of ways to get
more Jews involved in the commu
nity. That's where we came up
with the idea for a Jewish Film
Festival, which we did this year,
and I had the idea for an arts festi
val," said Cohen. "It's a good start;

we plan to do both events next
year."
Winners will be announced at
the opening ceremony, which is
open to the artists and the rest of
the community. "Jessica Cohen
and I will make some comments on
how important it is for religious
and ethnic groups to offer creative
programs for people to express
themselves, and how it's a wonder
ful way to develop individual and
community pride," said Latz.
Cohen added, "We feel that we
have a specific and special ethnic
heritage, but it is downplayed
sometimes because we're white."
The festival will be kicked off
with an opening ceremony from 5
p.m. to 7 p.m. in Tresidder Union.
