## First Jewish Arts Festival begins today 
### Nina Wasow 
A multimedia collage — part jigsaw puzzle
and part painting — celebrating Zionism and
family is one of the many types of art that will
be displayed at Stanford's first Jewish Arts
Festival.
Submissions by 10 Jewish student artists
will be exhibited for approximately six weeks
starting today.
Other mediums submitted include paint
ing, essays, poetry, collage, calligraphy, a bib

ritual objects and personal narrative.
The grand prize will be $500 and two run
ners-up will be awarded gift certificates to
Bob and Bob Judaica Shop in Palo Alto,
which also sponsored the festival through ad
vertising.
The festival is being coordinated by Stan

Michael Latz, the assistant program director
of Hillel. The jurors were English Prof. John
Felstiner, Art Lecturer Ruth Kedar, Judaica
Curator at Green Library Roger Kohn, Art
Prof. Joel Leivick and sophomore Jessica

are not forced to deal with it every day," she
said. "We looked for people who showed that
Judaism is a positive, not just assimilating

for entering the contest, all ten submissions
