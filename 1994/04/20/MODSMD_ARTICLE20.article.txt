## Silicon chips help increase understanding of the brain Researchers analyze neural activity by probing the brain's surface, growing nerve cells on chips Probing the brain

Often referred to as the "brains"
behind modern technology, integrated
circuits will soon be built into almost
everything from toys to toasters. At
Stanford, these tiny chips also may soon
help to shed light on the operation of the
most complex circuitry of all: the human
brain.
A group of scientists and engineers
working under Electrical Engineering
Prof. Gregory Kovacs is currently using
these chips to explore the interactions
between neurons — the cells which
make up the brain. In doing this, they
hope to improve the understanding of
how these billions of cells interact, and
thus explain how the brain processes
information and reacts to outside stim
uli. '
Integrated circuits are in many ways
ideal for investigating cellular interac
tions, since they are smaller and cheap
er than other electronic technologies.
They are also generally more reliable.
This is a key factor if permanent
implantable neural sensors are ever to
be used, since the chips could not be
replaced easily in the brain.

The group has been working on elec
tronic interfaces to nerves for several
years, but the members have recently
come up with the two new projects
involving neurons which follow two very
different strategies.
Probing the neurons
The first project involves designing
and manufacturing tiny electronic
probes to be inserted directly into the
surface layers of the brain.

Each probe consists of several
electrodes arranged on two or more
sharp tines, which are inserted into

the brain with the top of the probe glued
to a large substrate, such as a printed
circuit board. The electrodes are then
used to pick up the signals sent among
neurons through the intracellular medi
um — the area between cells.
Some of the signal-processing circuit
ry may be put on the same chip with the
probe as the experiment continues. This
change would enable more computation
to be done by the implant itself, reduc
ing the need for a wire tether to trans
mit data back to a central computer.
Using these electrodes should yield
new and interesting results, since most
investigations into the brain in the past
have used one large electrode, according
to David Kewley, a Caltech graduate
student working on the project. The
electrodes are also spaced both in
rini| terms of depth into

implanted in the brain.

Varying the spacing of the tines produces

multiple images of activity in the brain.

the brain and in

lateral separation, creating anoth
er advantage over previous techniques.
Many parts of the brain are in layers
depending on their function. Probes
which place electrodes at different
depths can observe how different parts
of the brain process the same informa
tion.
The lateral separation between the
tines of each probe will allow
researchers to examine how neurons in
the same layer of the brain process dif
ferent information.
Since the probes are only about one to
1 1/2 millimeters long, only the surface
of the brain will be able to be explored
using this technique.
The first batch of 15 probes for the
group's experiment has just been manu
factured and will soon undergo testing
to ready them for insertion into test

animals.
Each one is slightly different
and can function independently of
the others. This stage of the experi
ment may not take place for a while,
however. According to Kewly, "we are

pushing things farther than what we
know we can do." Unanticipated prob
lems are virtually certain.
Eventually, the goal of the project is
to employ permanent implants, in
which probes could be inserted into ani
mals, which would then recover from
surgery and "go about business."
Problems with the technique
Although the group hopes for suc
cess, there are several problems which
must be overcome to perfect the pro
cess.
Because the body is in many ways a
hostile environment for implants, espe
cially those involving electronics, one of
the main obstacles to electronically
monitoring neural activity is separating
the individual signals out of the general
electronic noise of the brain's intracellu
lar medium. Since each electrode

Researchers plan to use miniature probes like this one to
measure neural activity at the brain's surface. The probes will
eventually be designed so that they can be permanently

receives a signal from each surrounding
neuron, separation is often very diffi
cult.
The use of many tiny electrodes helps
to solve this problem. Rows of electrodes
can act like arrays of stereo receivers,
providing multiple images of the brain's
activity.
By using computer-processing tech
niques the signal from each nearby neu
ron can be identified.
However, even if the individual sig
nals can be isolated, interpreting these
signals remains formidable. An analo
gous task might be attempting to under
stand an incoming fax simply by listen
ing to the high-pitched tone transmitted
by a fax machine.
Growing neurons on chips
In the other project, cells are grown
onto a "petri dish chip" which contains
an array of tiny electrodes. This allows
the electrodes to observe the cellular
interactions in a more controlled envi
ronment.
Currently, the neurons being grown
on chips are derived from the sub
thalmic tissue of a mouse or from neu
roblastoma — cancer-derived cells
which are neuron-like. However, since
the cells are not actual neurons, there is
no direct connection between their
activity and that of a brain
Instead, the project is geared toward
examining the cells' reactions to various
stimuli.
One potential use of this kind of chip
lies in detecting changes in the neurons'
activity when they are exposed to differ
ent substances.
For example, dying neurons exhibit
changes in their activity patterns, and in
addition shrivel away from the surface
of the chip, changing the electrical
impedance seen by the electrodes. Both
of these effects would be potentially
detectable using the technology being
developed by the group.
The type of biosensor the group is
developing would be able to detect any

0.5 r^rn

neurotoxins simply by being able to tell
when the cells are being affected.
Neurotoxins can inhibit neuron activ
ity in a number of different ways, and
conventional chemical sensors have to
test for every known substance sepa
rately.
The electrodes can also be used to
stimulate the neurons and observe their
reactions. Thus scientists could study
the behavior of live "neural networks,"
rather than being restricted to those
modeled in a computer.
However, the project is still in the
early stages, so it will be quite some time
before any practical devices are devel
oped.
"A lot of infrastructure is involved in
the set-up" of a project like this, said
David Borkholder, one of the graduate
students working on the project.
According to Borkholder, the main
work to date has involved developing
ways to culture the neurons on the chips
and developing the basic chip design.
Currently, the entire experiment must
be kept in an incubator used to culture
the cells.
Immediate goals include developing
electrodes with tiny spikes to project up
into the cells, and developing smaller
electrodes, so that it might be possible to
have them fit entirely beneath a single
cell. Such changes would greatly
increase signal quality.
In all of these experiments, the elec
trodes can only provide insight into the
signals sent through the intracellular
medium. Much of the information pro
cessing takes place inside the neurons
themselves, and these processes cannot
be directly observed with the probes cur
rently in use.
Though actual implementation of the
experimental results derived from tests
with individual groups of neurons is still
in the future, the research may one day
provide important clues about the inter
nal structure of the brain — knowledge
which may help bring what is now mere
ly science fiction into reality.
