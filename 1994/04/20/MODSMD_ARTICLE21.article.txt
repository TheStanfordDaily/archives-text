# New software to ease networking
## Technology will aid retrieval, manipulation of information 
### Michael Slemmer Editorial staff 
Bringing computer technology ever clos
er to the average person, Stanford profes
sors are working to implement a new type
of networking software which would allow
easier access to the Internet.
At the core of the technology is the abili
ty to retrieve and manipulate information
across the international network without
knowing its exact location. In order to
accomplish this goal, Stanford program
mers are working on implementing code
which searches through the network to find
specific information.
"The initial goal ... is to allow compa
nies to make data available on the net," said
Computer Science Department Chair Jef
frey Ullman, one of the heads of the recent
ly formed Stanford Center for Information
Technology, which is carrying out the pro
ject.
The center's work will initially be
applied to the Commerce Net, a new com
munications network which will link busi
nesses electronically. In this field, the tech
nology can be used in applications ranging
from "selling memory chips to establishing
a 'virtual corporation' where people who
have never met can do business," Ullman
said.
The new networking software will be
based on the Mosaic program, which cur
rently allows net users to access the World
Wide Web — a system which makes using

the Internet easier.
However, according to Ullman, one of
the Web's major limitations is the fact that
searching for information can prove
extremely difficult. "It is very important to
be able to search the Web by content," he
said. "Right now you have to navigate the
system. Essentially you already have to
know where the information you seek is
located."
This problem exists because using the
Web requires moving through "links"
which take the user from one information
area or "page" to another. For example,
while accessing Stanford's page, users have
a limited number of other pages to which
they can move.
Using the technology being developed by
the Stanford center, on the other hand,
users could instruct their computers to
search throughout the entire Web for infor
mation, so that they do not have to move
through the sometimes-complex series of
pages.
The Commerce Net is only one specific
application of the technology the Stanford
based center is developing. According to
Ullman, the future possibilities for the
technology are likely to be profound.
For example, physicians could use the
ability to search large networks of data to
look up specific information on diseases
and complications they encounter. In this
manner, the need for passing around large
quantities of paper can be virtually elimi
nated.

Another likely candidate for the new
technology is education. According to Oil
man, networking innovations could eventu
ally produce a type of "global electronic uni
versity" which would rely on computers for
communication between students and edu
cators.
"In terms of Stanford's own educational
efforts, we're hoping this technology will be
used in the classrooms," he said, pointing
out that such devices as interactive text
books and electronic classrooms may exist
in the not-too-distant future.
Because classes are likely to be "export
ed" in this manner, Ullman said it is impor
tant for the University to stay abreast of
technological developments as they occur.
However, he warned against trying pre
maturely to gauge the effects that innova
tions in network software will have on the
way people carry out their work.
"In the 1980s, we couldn't have imag
ined what [personal computers] would be
used for," Ullman said. "I don't think it was
clear at that time what the applications
would be."
Despite the unknowns involved in esti
mating the future of computer technology,
the researchers working at the center are
optimistic about their developments in net
working software.
"We hope that what we do will make an
impact on computer use in the future," Ull
man said. "Our work has a variety of possi
ble applications and, I believe, a variety of
potential benefits."
