# Aggressive caterpillars are completely harmless
## 
### Nick Kuritzky Staff writer 
Aggressive hordes of small
green worms are ravaging campus
trees and attacking anyone who
dares to cross their path.
The half-inch long, oak-moth
caterpillars are actually quite
harmless, according to Grounds
Supervisor Herb Fong.
But they do have the ability to
weaken the oak trees that they
infest and pose quite a nuisance to
people who walk under them.
According to Fong, the emer
gence of these caterpillars is a
yearly event at Stanford and this
year is no worse than previous
ones.
Ground Services, however, has
already begun spraying for the
insects in especially problematic
areas, such as Manzanita Park,
Roble, Lagunita and Lomita Mall.
Spraying is being focused on
patios and picnic areas in which
the worms' defecations can "add a
little spice to people's lunch," said
Fong.
Caterpillar control includes the
use of the pesticide Orthene, and a
bacterial agent that causes inter
nal hemorrhaging in the insects.

Fong said the goal of the spray
ing was to pre-empt complaints
and "correct the problem before it
becomes a problem. Once a com
plaint is received, it is too late."
He added, "The tree may
already be defoliated and there is
not much you can do."
Fliers alerting students to close
their windows and move their cars
are distributed before the spray
ing.
In the Manzanita trailers, how
ever, a misunderstanding between
Ground Services and Housing Ser
vices led to spraying at a different
time than was announced on the
flier.
Fong said the chemical sprays
are not harmful to people or dam
aging to car paint.
Many students find the caterpil
lars, which hang by silk threads
from the trees, to be an annoyance
and welcome any attempt to get rid
of them.
Freshman Taavi Reiss, com
plained that the "little things stick
to me and crawl in my ear while I
am asleep."
Sophomore Greg Martellotto
echoed this sentiment, claiming
that the insects have infested his
hair and backpack.
