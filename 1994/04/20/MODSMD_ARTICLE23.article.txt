## De Silva off to a surprising start Frosh sports top record on talented tennis squad 
### Rob Ross Senior staff writer 
Ann De Silva got the best present a mother
could ask for her birthday — her daughter, San
dra.
A freshman at Stanford, Sandra De Silva
flew south to San Marino, Calif, right after that
Sunday's women's tennis match, hid at a
friend's house and popped out from behind a
door to surprise her overwhelmed mother.
"She couldn't believe it. She was so shocked,"
the younger De Silva said. "She looked at my
dad and did a double-take. My little sister was
shocked too, because if we had told her before
hand, then my mom would know."
De Silva has shocked more than just her
family this season. In compiling the best dual
match record on the Cardinal women's tennis
team, the frosh has surprised 21 different oppo
nents, giving up only one set in the process.
Overall, at Stanford De Silva is 31-2 on her
career, having constructed a 10-2 mark in fall
and winter tournament play.
The last time a frosh went undefeated in
dual-match play for the Cardinal was in 1989,
when Debbie Graham strung together 27
freshman victories. As a sophomore Graham
added another 25 before losing, thereby setting
the Stanford record for most dual-match wins
in a row. Graham, a three-year starter for the
Cardinal, left Stanford after her junior season
to turn pro.
Stanford head coach Frank Brennan counts
himself as one of the many De Silva has sur
prised this year.
"She's not on a scholarship this year," Bren
nan said. "In that sense she was a sleeper. Then
again, coaches who knew her were very
impressed."
Much of this impression comes from an
amazing tournament De Silva put together the
summer after her junior year. Memphis, Tenn.
was the site of the National 18-and under Clay
Court Championships that year, and De Silva
was one of the favorites going in. She had pre
pared for this championship for a number of
months, actually going to Europe to practice on
the clay courts there.
But in the first round, a heavily favored De
Silva lost.
"It was a huge disappointment," she said.
"After preparing for so long, it was a crushing
loss. So then I went to play in the back draw."
She tore up that back draw. Playing in as
many as three matches a day (two singles and a
doubles match), she zoomed through her com
petitors and was able to finish a respectable fifth
after the heartbreaking beginning.
"That performance kind of defines me," she
said. "Even after a tough loss I want to come
back and give it my all."
A performance like that, under the adverse
condition of having to play an exhausting
number of matches under the Memphis heat,
is what tuned Brennan to his future No. 6 sin
gles player.

"She made her bones at the National Clay
Court Championships," Brennan said. "Win
ning the back draw is an amazing accomplish
ment, because the conditions can be brutal. .. .
Everybody told me that story."
You'd be surprised too, after meeting this

unassuming Flo Mo resident. A thin 5-feet-8, De
Silva tends to hide her high school tennis
accomplishments (which include being the top
ranked girl under 18 in southern California and

rated as high as ninth nationally in
the same age group) behind a mod
est exterior that claimed not to
have reali2ed about her tally of vic
tories until she read about them in
The Daily.
In fact, when asked about her
thoughts on the individual brack
ets at the NCAA Women's Tennis
Championship next month, she
had no idea even how that ladder
was selected. Neither in stature
nor in attitude does this woman
of Sri Lankan descent bear any
resemblance off the court to the
75th-ranked player nationally
who was described by assistant
coach Lele Forood as "a buzz

saw."

"She's very tough mentally,"
Brennan said. "She just plays who
ever's on the other side of the net
and beats them."
As a freshman, De Silva does
not know much about her oppo
nents. Often, she knows absolutely
nothing at all which, ironically, has
led to greater success on the court
rather than less. Without any con
cept of how good her opponents
are, she can then expect to beat
them. Ignorance is bliss, so they
say.
"I don't know who the girls I'm
playing are," De Silva said. "I feel
like I'm expected to win, which
feels good. When I'm expected to
lose, if I know that the girl I'm
playing is higher ranked, I think,
'Oh, it wouldn't be so bad to lose

this match.' "
Given the salient fact that De
Silva is often just overwhelmingly
better than her opponent, Brennan
sometimes de-emphasizes concen
tration on her opposition's game,
preferring just to reassure De Silva
that a good, average performance
will bring home a victory.
"Sandra's game doesn't have
a whole lot of diversity," Bren
nan said of his baseline player.
"She's got a pretty idiot-proof
game. She gets her serve in and
has a nice, hard, and flat fore
hand and backhand and runs
well when there is a tennis ball
on the court.
"Mostly, she just competes like
a tiger."
Hmmm, a tiger. A thin, easy
going, laid-back, California tiger.
One can't help but be surprised.
