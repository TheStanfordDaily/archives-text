# Bump and grind
## Volleyball gets down and dirty at Maples 
### 
It's time for a little bump
and grind. Now don't get
your hopes up, this is Stan
ford. But probably the closest
thing to it will be available this
weekend, right in the comforts
of your own, uh . . . Maples
Pavilion.

The best of college volleyball
will be coming to the Farm for
the Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation Championship
Tournament, starting Satur
day. The marquee event is slat
ed for 7 p.m., when Mountain
champion UCLA, ranked No. 1
in the nation by Volleyball
Monthly, battles host Stanford,
champion of the Pacific Division
and ranked No. 2. To the winner
goes an automatic berth in the
NCAA Final Four May 6-7 in Ft.
Wayne, Ind.
Yet the way the MPSF tour
nament works is the loser of
that matchup is not out of it.
The loser becomes part of the
tournament bracket, playing
the winner of Cal State
Northridge-Pepperdine in the
semis, and needs to win just one
other match beyond that to also
earn a spot in the Final Four.
So there will be a lot of bump
and grind on the Farm. A rare
occurrence, yes. But add some
sets and spikes to the mix, and it
is an event that occurs quite reg

ularly on this campus. For those
who have not been to a Stanford
men's volleyball game this sea
son, here's what you've been
missing:
• The Cardinal spikers are
doing quite well. Stanford has a
record of 17-8 overall, 14-4 in
conference.
• Canyon Ceman. The senior
setter from Manhattan Beach,
Calif, is without question the
best player in college volleyball.
He was named Collegiate Player
of the Year in 1993, and could be
cited for back-to-back honors.
Most likely, two years from now
he'll be wearing the red, white,
cind blue for the U.S. in Atlanta.
If you have not yet seen Ceman
play volleyball for the Cardinal,
this is your last chance. Don't
miss it.
• Matt Fuerbringer. The
freshman from Costa Mesa
leads the MPSF in kills with 446
on the season, averaging 7.5 a
game. He is a candidate for 1994
Freshman of the Year.
• Michael Hoefer. Another
freshman who has made a big
contribution to this year's Stan
ford squad, the middle blocker
from Goleta, Calif, rates third in
the MPSF in both hitting per
centage and blocking average.
Hoefer has a Stanford record of
136 blocks so far this season.
• Ceman. Did I mention that
he has 5,571 career assists, a
school record?
• Joe Burghardt. The senior
middle blocker from Alhambra,
Calif, provides the Cardinal
with consistency. A three-year
starter, Burghardt is Stanford's
top server, tallying 31 aces in
this season alone.

For all of the East Coast trans
plants in the Stanford community,
this tournament is an opportunity
to take some of that California cul
ture home this summer. All but two
of the 17 players on the Cardinal
roster are from southern California
— the others are from Hawaii.
Observe the volleyball fashion, and
pick up on the rules of the game.
Your friends might be impressed.

Or maybe not. Nevertheless,
you'll be a better person for it.
This is college, a time to try new
things and test the waters. And a
road trip is not even necessary.
Seven of the top-10 rated teams
will be playing right here, within
walking distance of your room.
As for the Californians who have
not seen a volleyball game, you're
missing out on important stuff.
People from the rest of the United
States expect us to know this —
how to play it, how to dress it, how
to describe it. How can you say
you're from the Golden State when

volleyball is not part of your reper
toire? It's like people expecting all
Californians to know how to surf.
All right, you caught me.
Regardless, the point of this is
that the Stanford volleyball team
is having a fine season, and
deserves some fan support. So get
out to Maples and take in some
digs and kills. It will be, to use Cal
ifornian dialect, cool.

It's been a long time since
Schwartz has been able to bump
and grind. Why do you think he
knows so much about volleyball?
