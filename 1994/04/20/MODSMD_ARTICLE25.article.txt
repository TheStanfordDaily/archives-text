## Volleyball clinches top spot in MPSF 
### Kathryn Yang Senior staff writer 
Both Stanford players and
fans let out a collective sigh of
relief as the Cardinal volleyball
squad clinched first place in the
Pacific Division of the Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation
with a 13-15, 15-8, 15-7, 8-15,
15-13 nailbiter against
unranked Pacific last night.
After a relatively simple
four-game victory over the
Tigers earlier this season, No. 2
Stanford (18-8 overall, 15-4 in
the MPSF) could not have

anticipated such a fierce battle
against sixth-place UOP (8-8,
5-14). However, a combination
of great volleyball by Pacific
and an off-night for Stanford's
big swingers resulted in a
tooth-and-nail fight.
"That was UOP's last game
of the season, and they turned
it into a their championship
match," said Stanford coach
Ruben Nieves. "It was seniors'
night for them, and they just
played extremely well for the
home crowd."
In addition, the Cardinal's
offense stalled with opposite hitter
Matt Fuerbringer committing 15
hitting errors for a sub-par .204
hitting percentage. Swing hitter
Mike Lambert has also seen better
days than his 11 errors and .298
average performance.
Nevertheless, assuming the
form of a true championship team,
the Cardinal pulled the mateh out
when it counted.
After splitting the first pair of
games, Stanford slipped in the
third frame and allowed the Tigers
an early 5-0 advantage.
At that point, Nieves resorted
to his favorite backup plan, insert
ing defensive specialists Stewart
Chong and J.B. Taylor into the
backrow for three rotations each.
Chong's play eventually thrust
the Cardinal ahead 9-7, and Tay
lor then widened that margin to
12-7 on his serve.
Unfortunately, Stanford could
not sustain that momentum and
succumbed to a slew of hitting
errors in the fourth game, as the
Tigers swept to a 15-8 victory.
Despite entering that final
game with a 3-1 season record in
five-game matches, Stanford still
fell periously behind, 4-0. After
two time-outs, the Cardinal then
pulled itself out of the hole to tie
the game at six, eight, 11 and 13,
before icing the victory on senior
captain Joe Burghardt's serve.
Next up will be a rematch
against undefeated and No. 1
UCLA in the MPSF Champi
onship game. Last year the Bruins
grabbed the automatic NCAA bid
with a 15-4, 10-15, 15-9,15-11 vic
tory over the Cardinal. However,
this year the game will be played in
Northern California for the first
time ever, and Stanford is hoping
to cash in that home field advan
tage. The match begins at 7 p.m.
this Saturday at Burham Pavilion.
