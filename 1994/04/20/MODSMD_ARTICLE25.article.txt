## Volleyball clinches top spot in MPSF 
### Kathryn Yang Senior staff writer 
Both Stanford players and
fans let out a collective sigh of
relief as the Cardinal volleyball
squad clinched first place in the
Pacific Division of the Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation
with a 13-15, 15-8, 15-7, 8-15,
15-13 nailbiter against
unranked Pacific last night.
After a relatively simple
four-game victory over the
Tigers earlier this season, No. 2
Stanford (18-8 overall, 15-4 in
the MPSF) could not have

anticipated such a fierce battle
against sixth-place UOP (8-8,
5-14). However, a combination
of great volleyball by Pacific
and an off-night for Stanford's
big swingers resulted in a
tooth-and-nail fight.
"That was UOP's last game
of the season, and they turned
it into a their championship
match," said Stanford coach
Ruben Nieves. "It was seniors'
night for them, and they just
played extremely well for the
home crowd."
