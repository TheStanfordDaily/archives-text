# Five-run ninth turns close game into rout
## Allen, Carver combine for 4 hits, 6 RBI 
### Andy Eiser Senior staff writer 
MORAGA — Picture perfect.
The No. 9 Cardinal baseball
team, cranking up a rusty offense
to back up trademark solid pitch
ing, cruised to a 10-2 win over the
St. Mary's Gaels on a beautiful
day at Guisto Field.
Taking no time to enjoy the
plush green hills and clear blue
skies surrounding the diamond,
Stanford (27-16) pounded out 14
hits and scored five runs in the
ninth inning to provide the final
margin of victory for junior
starter Matt Marenghi (2-2), who
allowed just one run on two hits
over five innings. Freshman
Brendan Sullivan closed the door
on the Gaels (22-18), surrender
ing the other St. Mary's run on
just one hit over four innings.
"I give credit to Matt, he
pitched well," said junior first
baseman Dusty Allen. "I can't
remember the last time he had a
bad outing."
Allen helped make a bad outing
look even worse for Gaels' senior
starter Don Tynon (3-3), who left
after five innings with his team
trailing 4-1. But Allen, the first
batter to face reliever Kevin
Lowry, singled to lead off the

sixth arid came around to score on
a single by sophomore leftfielder
Steve Carver and a sacrifice fly by
sophomore rightfielder Brodie
Van Wagenen.
St. Mary's closed again to with-

in three runs in
the bottom of the
frame, when an
RBI single by
senior catcher
Bear Nitschke
drove home
junior second
baseman Kelly
Asan to make it
5-2.

But both Stanford and Allen
saved their thunder for a furious
ninth-inning ambush that put the
contest out of reach. With one
out, junior second baseman Jed
Hansen drew a walk from fresh
man reliever Sam Madrid. Sopho
more catcher A.J. Hinch then sin
gled Hansen to third, taking sec
ond on the throw.
Madrid intentionally walked
senior designated hitter Nate
Olmstead to load the bases, then
was replaced by junior Gary Han
ifen. But Hanifen could not get
out of the jam, serving up Allen'•
second hit and a pair of runs on a


Carver
seeing-eye grounder through the
left side of a drawn-in infield.
"They walked Nate to set up
the double play, so I wanted to
keep the ball off the ground. But I
got behind two strikes, and then I
just wanted to put the ball in
play," Allen said.
Carver followed with the
demoralizing blow, a three-run
cue shot off the end of his bat that
cleared the right-center field
fence for his second home run of
the year.
"I talked with coach [Dean]
Stotz before the inning about
'clearing my hips,' " Carver said.
"I tried to get enough of my body
twisted around before I brought
my hands to the ball, and I ended
up with a good whip at it."
Allen, the Cardinal's home run
leader with six, praised Carver's
strength.

"It's great to see Steve coming
around like that. As a hitter, it's a
tremendous feeling to mishit a
ball and still get it out of the
park," Allen said.
Aside from providing a helpful
tip to his leftfielder, Stotz appar
ently motivated Stanford's late
heroics in other ways.
"He was on to us about how big
a couple of runs would be in
breaking the game open and keep
ing our pitchers confident," Carv
er said. "We didn't want to win 5-
2, but 10-2 is more like it."
Head coach Mark Marquess
also stoked his squad's fire,
speaking before the game about
how midweek losses, like the one
the Cardinal suffered Feb. 1 at
the hands of the Gaels, halt the
momentum that the team has
built in recent weeks.
"We talked about how impor
tant it is to keep our mental focus
on Tuesday games," Carver said.
"Our mental approach is chang
ing, and it's changing at a key
point in the season."
