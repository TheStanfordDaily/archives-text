MORAGA — Picture perfect.
The No. 9 Cardinal baseball
team, cranking up a rusty offense
to back up trademark solid pitch
ing, cruised to a 10-2 win over the
St. Mary's Gaels on a beautiful
day at Guisto Field.
Taking no time to enjoy the
plush green hills and clear blue
skies surrounding the diamond,
Stanford (27-16) pounded out 14
hits and scored five runs in the
ninth inning to provide the final
margin of victory for junior
starter Matt Marenghi (2-2), who
allowed just one run on two hits
over five innings. Freshman
Brendan Sullivan closed the door
on the Gaels (22-18), surrender
ing the other St. Mary's run on
just one hit over four innings.
"I give credit to Matt, he
pitched well," said junior first
baseman Dusty Allen. "I can't
remember the last time he had a
bad outing."
Allen helped make a bad outing
look even worse for Gaels' senior
starter Don Tynon (3-3), who left
after five innings with his team
trailing 4-1. But Allen, the first
batter to face reliever Kevin
Lowry, singled to lead off the

sixth arid came around to score on
a single by sophomore leftfielder
Steve Carver and a sacrifice fly by
sophomore rightfielder Brodie
Van Wagenen.
St. Mary's closed again to with-

in three runs in
the bottom of the
frame, when an
RBI single by
senior catcher
Bear Nitschke
drove home
junior second
baseman Kelly
Asan to make it
5-2.

But both Stanford and Allen
saved their thunder for a furious
ninth-inning ambush that put the
contest out of reach. With one
out, junior second baseman Jed
Hansen drew a walk from fresh
man reliever Sam Madrid. Sopho
more catcher A.J. Hinch then sin
gled Hansen to third, taking sec
ond on the throw.
Madrid intentionally walked
senior designated hitter Nate
Olmstead to load the bases, then
was replaced by junior Gary Han
ifen. But Hanifen could not get
out of the jam, serving up Allen'•
second hit and a pair of runs on a
