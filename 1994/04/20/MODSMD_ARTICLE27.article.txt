Steve Cummer, also a grad student, prevailed in the
D competition by outlasting the field and sprinting
late to victory.
In the 30-mile women's A course, the Stanford
squad dominated again on Saturday. Junior Tracy

filled out the top 12 point-qualifying positions with
sixth, seventh and llth-place finishes.
