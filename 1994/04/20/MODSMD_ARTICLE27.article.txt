# Cycling sprints to second place at Berkeley
## Women place five in top twelve in Saturday's 30-mile road race

As the season winds down, the Stanford cycling
team is winding up and riding right through the com
petition. In two races this past weekend in Berkeley,
third-ranked Stanford perpetuated a season-long
trend of strong finishes.
Stanford, with 204 points, placed a close second to
Cal Poly-SLO's 223 points in Saturday's road race.
On Sunday, the team placed fourth in the criterium
race behind Cal Poly, UC-Davis and California.
Saturday's cycling dramatics took place on the
stage of a very hilly and windy course. In the 50-mile
men's A race, Stanford found itself in a very tough
situation with only three riders competing. Despite
this numerical handicap, and despite being blocked
by a Cal Poly rider, graduate student Bill Lloyd broke
away with the front group and rode to third place.
Steve Cummer, also a grad student, prevailed in the
D competition by outlasting the field and sprinting
late to victory.
In the 30-mile women's A course, the Stanford
squad dominated again on Saturday. Junior Tracy
Timms and senior Nicole Freed man worked together
to garner first and third, respectively, while Stanford
filled out the top 12 point-qualifying positions with
sixth, seventh and llth-place finishes.
"It was really a good race," Timms said, "There
was great teamwork. Nicole gave me a wonderful

lead-out that was crucial to my
winning the race."
Freedman echoed Timms' sen
timents about the finish of the 30-
mile race.
"It was an awesome sprint,"
Freedman said. "I led-out really
early, just hoping that I could hold
it long enough for Tracy."
In Sunday's criterium competi
tion, the Stanford riders had to
pedal in a short, fast course around
the Berkeley campus. Stanford's
team effort was dampened by rid
ers missing the event due to ill
nesses; however, individual riders
turned in strong performances to
heat up the race.

In the women's A battle, first
year rider Freedman displayed her
omnium-leading mettle by dueling
with Cal's ex-National Team rider,
Kendra Kneeland, to take second
place. The race turned into a two
woman competition, as Freedman
and Kneeland lapped the rest of
the pack.
"It was an amazing race, the best
race. It was great to see how strong
the top really is," Freedman said.
The men's A race proved equal
ly dramatic with Stanford's Dario
Falquier sprinting to fourth place.
Falquier raced ahead of the pack
to establish a four-man break
away group with riders from each
of the top teams; this representa
tive group also lapped the pack
and raced each other to the finish
line.
"Dario has been making the

race all year, making the break
happen in almost every race this
year that determined who was
going to win," coach Art Walker
said. "He's a fine, fine rider and
I'm looking forward to him tak
ing a long time to get his Ph.D."
This weekend, Stanford com
petes in the last conference race of
the season at Chico State. This is
an important race because the for
mat and flat terrain is the closest
to what the team will face at
nationals in Wichita Falls, Texas.
"It will be a proving ground,"
Walker said.
Stanford is aiming to secure
some wins but Walker expects
tough competition from No. 1 Cal
Poly and from individual riders
Ken Husband (Chico State), Brian
Whitcomb (Cal) and Ben Bourne
(Cal Poly).
