# Women's water polo falls short of nationals
##

In the three months since coach Ben Quit
tner took over the Stanford women's water polo
program, the team has set its sights on some
lofty goals, both for this year and the future.
While the Cardinal s future is looking
bright — it will become a varsity sport in 1995-
96 — the women's immediate goals eluded
them this past weekend as they fell just short
of a berth in the National Championships.
Stanford finished the Western Qualifying
Tournament in Stockton, Calif, with a 1-3
record, finishing sixth. The Cardinal needed a
fourth place result to guarantee an invitation
to the national tournament.
Stanford opened the weekend play with a 12-

6 victory over UC-Irvine. The Cardinal over
came a slow start in which it found itself down
4-1 at the end of the first quarter.
"They came out shooting, and we were
caught ofT guard," said junior Nicki Bergstrom.
"Afler the first quarter, we stopped their hole
set, who was basically their best player."
Over the final three periods of play, Stanford
used its speed to keep the pressure on the
Ant-eaters, scoring often with a strong counter
attacking offense.
Following its win, the Cardinal faced UC-San
Diego and fell to the more experienced Tritons.
"We came out fired up against Irvine, but
then we played UCSD who was just bigger,
faster and more experienced," Quittner said.
With its record evened at 1-1 on the weekend,
Stanford faced UC-Santa Barbara in a contest

between two evenly matched teams. The Cardi
nal again came out flat, however, and was
defeated by the Gauchos by a 10-5 score.
"We should have won our game against
Santa Barbara," Quittner said. "We came out
and were down 6-1 after the first quarter. In a
game between two equal teams, you can't let
that happen."
Quittner mentioned the lack of firepower as
a factor in the loss. "We were hurting for scor
ing," he said. "We hit a million bars. We just
made too many mistakes. If we had won that
game, we would have played for fourth place."
Instead, the Cardinal finished the tourney by
facing Cal, and fell at the hands of the Golden
Bears.
