# Racquetball shocks nationals
## Team nets sixth place, highest ever for a first-time competitor

Stanford's racquetball team went to the National
Intercollegiate Racquetball Championships as an
unknown. By the time they left, members of other
teams were clamoring to buy their equipment.
Of the 39 colleges in attendance, the Cardinal fin
ished sixth in the nation, the first time in two decades
that a new team has entered the top 10. As junior
Elkova Icenogle said, the team was "mentally tough."
"[Coach] Clyde Barker almost cried when they
announced the final scores, he was so excited," said
Icenogle.
Stanford's men's team placed fifth in the nation,
and its women's team placed 10th â€” with Elkova
Icenogle alone scoring enough points to put the
women's team in the top ten.
In fact, Icenogle by herself was the women's team.
No other Stanford women were in attendance. She
competed forcefully against other schools with full six
woman teams and, by the end of the weekend, was
ranked as the third-best women's player nationally.
She took home a bronze medal for her smashing
efforts.
Sophomore James Mulcock, Stanford's top men's
player, exhibited court brilliance, but was defeated in
the quarterfinals by University of Pennsylvania's
Craig Rappaport. Still, the tournament placed him in
the top eight players nationwide.
First year law student Mark Eisenhut's agility with
the racquet garnered him a Division II third-place fin
ish and a bronze medal, and he and James Mulcock
became the third best doubles team in the nation later

that day. For their efforts they won the All-American
title, despite its being their first time ever playing dou
bles together.
Paul Previde, a Division II player, pounded his way
into second-place and silver-medalhood in a tough
match. However, according to most members, the
most exciting match of the championships was Ryan
Kaltman's come-from-behind victory in the finals to
win first place and a gold-medal in Division IV. In the
three-round game, Kaltman won the first round by
one point and lost the second by two points. In the
third match, his opponent, John Carzoli of Oklahoma,
pulled out to a 7-0 lead. With tension high, Kaltman
managed to wrestle his way from behind to win the
match.
Stanford senior Blake Stephenson stomped into
the quarterfinals in Division V play, and freshman
Josh Galanter, despite an injury, reached Division VI
quarterfinals, gaining further victory points for the
team.
"When . . . the overall standings Iwere announced)
on the last day of competition, we were just overjoyed
that we had placed in the top 10. To have attained our
goals in the first year, that's exciting," said Kaltman.
The top ranked teams ahead of Stanford were last
year's champion Southwest Missouri State in first,
Memphis State in second, Wisconsin third, Brigham
Young fourth, and Baldwin Wallace fifth. Stanford's
team has been invited back to compete again next year
and hope to do just as well, if not better.
"I think other teams were impressed by our sense
of sportsmanship and skill," said Kaltman. "It's all
due to the dedication of the team."
