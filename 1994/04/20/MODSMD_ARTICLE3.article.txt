He was riding away with a flat tire, but
that's not why he didn't get very far.
Stanford police arrested two alleged
thieves on campus early Saturday morning,
according to Detective Tim Schreiner.
The alleged thieves were originally spot
ted by Florence Moore Hall residents. At
around 3 a.m., people sitting inside a first
floor Mirlo room "heard this big loud tnetal
breaking falling-type noise," said sopho
more Peter Ligotti.
When they looked out the window, resi
dents noticed a man riding towards the

Tresidder Union parking lot on a bicycle
with a flat tire and a woman dressed in
black clothing casually walking away from
the building, Ligotti said.
A student living upstairs also noticed the
tfieft and immediately called police. When
residents looked outside, they found the
remnants of a broken U-lock on the ground
near the Mirlo bicycle racks, Schreiner
said.
David Charles Ready, a 35-year-old San
Francisco resident, and Kelliene Marie
Wetzel, a 25-year-old Kentfield resident,
were later found by police in a Subaru sta-
tion wagon with three bikes in the
trunk, Schreiner said. Car jacks
of the kind that are used to break
U-locks were also found in the
vehicle, Schreiner said.
The bicycles were all identified
as stolen from areas near Flo Mo,
Casa Zapata and the front of Cow
ell Student Health Center.
Ready and Wetzel both will be
charged with possession of stolen

property, possession of burglary
tools, possession of a stolen vehi
cle and conspiracy.
After searching Ready, police
found a set of brass knuckles in
his pocket, Schreiner said. Ready
will be charged with felony pos
session of a deadly weapon,
according to Schreiner.
Police also later determined
that Ready was under the influ
ence of heroin at the time of his
arrest, and he will be charged for
being under the influence of a
controlled substance, Schreiner
said.

Wetzel had two outstanding
warrants for her arrest, one for
traffic violations and another for
failure to appear in a San Francis
co court, he said.
The Mirlo residents were able
to make a positive identification
of both Ready and Wetzel,
Schreiner said.
Because all of the stolen bikes
were licensed, the police were able
to more quickly assemble their
charges. "A case really comes
together when we can find out
who owns [the bicycles],"
Schreiner said.
