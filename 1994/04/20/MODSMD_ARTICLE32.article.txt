# Three Stanford grads win Mellon humanities award

For liana Ben-Amos, studying tourist photos of
Samoa was more than a hobby. It has led to her
receiving one of three Mellon Fellowships awarded to
recent Stanford graduates.
"I was working on why tourists take the pho
tographs that they do of American and Western
Samoa," Ben-Amos said in an interview from Eng
land. "I wanted to know how stereotypes of the South
Pacific get accepted and re-enacted by the tourists
who visit."
Rather fortuitously, a member of the board that
reviews prospective Mellon scholars happened to be
teaching a course on tourism at the time of Ben-
Amos' interview, and the two spoke about Ben-Amos'
experience in Samoa, said the 1993 graduate.
The Andrew W. Mellon Fellowships in Humanistic
Studies, designed to honor academic excellence and a
commitment to a career in university teaching, also
will be awarded to 1988 graduates James Driscoll and
Natalie Nenadic.
The students were among the 85 college seniors
and recent graduates selected by The Woodrow Wil
son National Fellowships Foundation from more than
1,000 applicants. The award provides a $12,750
stipend and covers tuition and fees for the first year of
graduate study in the United States or Canada.
Ben-Amos, who designed her own major — history
and philosophy of the social sciences — while at Stan
ford, actually received the award last year but
deferred it until this year. She spent the last year pur
suing a master's degree in social anthropology at

Cambridge. The Mellon Fellowship cannot be used to
cover educational expenses overseas.
Ben-Amos plans to use the fellowship to help cover
expenses as she enters a graduate program in cultural
anthropology at the University of Chicago in the fall.
Driscoll, who is currently in Russia and unavail
able for comment, majored in Slavic languages and is
one of only two 1994 Mellon Fellowship recipients
who pursued Slavic studies. While at Stanford, he was
interested in Slavic poetry, according to Slavic Lan
guages and Literatures Prof. Lazar Fleishman, who is
chair of the department.
While at Stanford, Driscoll was the co-founder of
Slavianskii Dom, the Slavic/East European theme
house. He also organized two student periodicals, co
founded the Stanford-Soviet Exchange Program and
garnered myriad undergraduate awards, including
the Dinkelspiel Award, the Dean's Award for Service,
and the Dean's Award for Academic Achievement.
"He is perhaps the best undergraduate student I
have ever encountered in my career in academia. He
is one of those Stanford graduates our campus should
be proud of," Fleishman said.
Fleishman predicted that Driscoll will be one of the
future leading scholars in Slavic studies.He has been
offered admission to the graduate program in the
Slavic departments at Stanford and Harvard, but he
has not yet selected which school he will attend. "We
are eagerly waiting for his decision," Fleishman said.
Nenadic, the third recipient, graduated from Stan
ford with departmental honors in international rela
tions and also majored in Italian. She was unavailable
for comment.
