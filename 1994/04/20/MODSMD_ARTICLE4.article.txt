# ASSU validates election results
## Senate meeting rules computer-voting system fair, confirms special-fee defeats 
### Jim Luh Staff writer 
The ASSU Senate voted last
night to validate the results of last
week's general election despite
concerns about how the new com
puter-voting system may have af
fected the fee requests of numer
ous student groups.
By validating the election in a
near-unanimous vote, the senate
effectively accepted that it was
conducted in a non-partisan man
ner. Before the election results are
considered final, the senate must
also certify that the results were
accurately determined. That vote
will take place in two weeks.
Before voting on validation,
senators raised questions about
how the new UNIX election sys
tem performed. Several individu

als inside and outside the senate
have suggested that the design of
the system was responsible for
high abstention rates on special
fee requests — potentially con
tributing to the abnormally high
number of student groups that
lost their funding. All told, voters
denied the requests of 18 groups.
But ASSU Elections Commis
sioner Tom Tsao downplayed the
computer system's effect. "I be
lieve that was a little blown out of
proportion," he said.
Tsao offered an alternate ex
planation — a graduate student
movement to increase abstentions
on special fees.
Hearings Officer Jaasi Munan
ka said that he had received two
telephone calls from students re
porting that they had received
electronic mail chain letters urg
ing graduate students to abstain
from special-fee voting.
"The thing is, that wasn't sub
stantiated," Munanka said.
Munanka said he had asked the
callers to forward copies of the
message to him, but he never
received any evidence or further
communications from the com
plainants. Munanka said he did
not pursue the matter further.
Tsao suggested that other fac
tors had more of an impact on the
unusual number of special-fee fail
ures, including unfavorable
endorsements by The Daily and
the increased number of groups
requesting fees.
"[Students] are having to
choose from a lot, and it's a hard
choice," Tsao said.
Other senators asked Tsao and
his programming team whether
the voting systems were accessible
at all times.
Programmer Enda Hu admit
ted that some students may have
experienced delays when voting
but that those delays did not influ
ence the election unfairly.
"I only got one e-mail from a
person who was frustrated," Hu
said, and that person "came in and

got a paper ballot."
While there may have been
quirks in the voting system, few
senators saw them as grounds for
invalidation.
"The election process might
have been more difficult than last
year, but that doesn't mean it's
unfair," said graduate senator
Edward Sharp.
Other senators seemed to
agree, as only two senators voted
against validation.
One of the dissenting senators,
sophomore Phillip Lin, said, "I
personally do feel that the comput
er program did affect the results."
Sophomore Cecili Sessions said
she voted against validation
because of the "major financial
problems" the results will bring to
campus ethnic communities. The
special fees of two major ethnic
groups — the Black Student
Union and MEChA, a
Chicano/Latino student group —
failed to receive the mandatory
approval of 15 percent of the regis
tered student body.
Graduate senators Nawwar
Kasrawi and Jerry Yang also man
aged to attach amendments to the
validation bill that will require the
Elections Commission to release
separate figures for graduate and
undergraduate votes on special fees
and on constitutional amendments.
There was little objection to the
amendments, except from gradu
ate senator Neil Crellin, who

asserted that the freedom of infor
mation provisions in the ASSU
Bylaws require the Elections Com
mission to release the figures upon
request regardless of senate action.
In other business, the senate
voted to confirm junior Gabe
Lucas as next year's ASSU Finan
cial Manager. Lucas, who has
served as an undergraduate sena
tor for the past two years, resigned
from his post last night to assume
the position.
But a bill to confirm next year's
ASSU business project managers
and assistant financial managers
was sidelined, as the senate
approved a motion by undergradu
ate senator Eric Chen to postpone
the bill indefinitely.
Chen noted that, contrary to
procedures outlined in the ASSU
Bylaws, ASSU senators and Coun
cil of Presidents members were
not present during the interview
ing process, possibly causing can
didates to be overlooked.
"It wasn't a representative pro
cess," Chen said. "These positions
are important... . You're directly
in contact with students' fees."
Crellin suggested that Chen's
motion was an attempt to get his
friends appointed to the positions.
Chen simply shook his head at
Crellin's accusations. "There's
some people here that are my
friends," he said, pointing to the
names listed on the confirmation
biU.

but that those delays did not influ
ence the election unfairly.
"I only got one e-mail from a
person who was frustrated," Hu
said, and that person "came in and

got a paper ballot."
While there may have been
quirks in the voting system, few
senators saw them as grounds for
invalidation.
"The election process might
have been more difficult than last
year, but that doesn't mean it's
unfair," said graduate senator
Edward Sharp.
Other senators seemed to
agree, as only two senators voted
against validation.
One of the dissenting senators,
sophomore Phillip Lin, said, "I
personally do feel that the comput
er program did affect the results."
Sophomore Cecili Sessions said
she voted against validation
because of the "major financial
problems" the results will bring to
campus ethnic communities. The
special fees of two major ethnic
groups — the Black Student
Union and MEChA, a
Chicano/Latino student group —
failed to receive the mandatory
approval of 15 percent of the regis
tered student body.
Graduate senators Nawwar
Kasrawi and Jerry Yang also man
aged to attach amendments to the
validation bill that will require the
Elections Commission to release
separate figures for graduate and
undergraduate votes on special fees
and on constitutional amendments.
There was little objection to the
amendments, except from gradu
ate senator Neil Crellin, who

asserted that the freedom of infor
mation provisions in the ASSU
Bylaws require the Elections Com
mission to release the figures upon
request regardless of senate action.
In other business, the senate
voted to confirm junior Gabe
Lucas as next year's ASSU Finan
cial Manager. Lucas, who has
served as an undergraduate sena
tor for the past two years, resigned
from his post last night to assume
the position.
But a bill to confirm next year's
ASSU business project managers
and assistant financial managers
was sidelined, as the senate
approved a motion by undergradu
ate senator Eric Chen to postpone
the bill indefinitely.
Chen noted that, contrary to
procedures outlined in the ASSU
Bylaws, ASSU senators and Coun
cil of Presidents members were
not present during the interview
ing process, possibly causing can
didates to be overlooked.
"It wasn't a representative pro
cess," Chen said. "These positions
are important... . You're directly
in contact with students' fees."
Crellin suggested that Chen's
motion was an attempt to get his
friends appointed to the positions.
Chen simply shook his head at
Crellin's accusations. "There's
some people here that are my
friends," he said, pointing to the
names listed on the confirmation
biU.
