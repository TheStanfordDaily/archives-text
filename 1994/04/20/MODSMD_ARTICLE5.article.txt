## D.C. campus director to step down as a result of budget-cutting measures 
### Lisa Taber 
In a move to save money and
provide greater continuity, the
directorship of the Stanford in
Washington program is being
changed from a faculty to "a non
professorial, staff position," ac
cording to Assoc. Dean of Hu
manities and Sciences A 1 Camar
illo.
Stanford in Washington's Pro
gram Director, Communication
Prof. Emeritus Elie Abel, was
asked to step down from his posi
tion last week as part of a budget
cutting measure designed to
"change the nature of the direc
torship," said Camarillo.
"I didn't make the decision,"
Abel said in a phone interview

from Washington on Monday.
"But it seems to be quite appro
priate that I should step down
given the severity of the budget
cuts."
Abel's position as head of
Stanford's popular program in
Washington, D.C., is being
changed to a "longer-term, staff
directorship," said Camarillo,
who expects the move to "save
tremendous amounts of money."
Budget woes were the "lion's
share of the reason" Abel was
asked to step down, he explained.
Abel's salary as a full professor
is much larger than the money
expected to be paid to a full-time
staff director.
"I would like to have stayed
longer," said Abel, who assumed
the position just last September,
and suffered a heart attack in
January. "But I'm not unhappy
about the decision," he added,
predicting that his replacement
would probably be "younger and
less expensive."
Camarillo also emphasized
"the issue of continuity," which
"is critical to the program."
"It is nearly impossible for a

faculty member to stay longer
than two to three years," he said,
while a "staff director can stay
for a substantially longer period
of time." Camarillo added that
the nearly 74-year-old profes
sor's health "was not the reason
[Abel] is being asked to step
down."
The search for a new director
of the program is "just starting,"
said Camarillo, who expects to
have the position filled in June.
"We're looking for a D.C. person
who knows Washington inti
mately and who, for placement
purposes, is familiar with both
government and non-profit

agencies."
Abel was confident that the
quality of Stanford in Washing
ton would not suffer due to the
change in leadership, saying "it's
an excellent program and it will
continue to be so."
Program Administrator Mar
sha Shinkman echoed that cer
tainty, saying "there will be an
adjustment period but I'm con
vinced that the staff here will
be able to keep everything here
on an even keel and going
strong."
"It's a very solid program
and it only gets better," she
added.
