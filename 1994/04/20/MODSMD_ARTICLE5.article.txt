## D.C. campus director to step down as a result of budget-cutting measures 
### Lisa Taber 
In a move to save money and
provide greater continuity, the
directorship of the Stanford in
Washington program is being
changed from a faculty to "a non
professorial, staff position," ac
cording to Assoc. Dean of Hu
manities and Sciences A 1 Camar
illo.
Stanford in Washington's Pro
gram Director, Communication
Prof. Emeritus Elie Abel, was
asked to step down from his posi
tion last week as part of a budget
cutting measure designed to
"change the nature of the direc
torship," said Camarillo.
"I didn't make the decision,"
Abel said in a phone interview

from Washington on Monday.
"But it seems to be quite appro
priate that I should step down
given the severity of the budget
cuts."
Abel's position as head of
Stanford's popular program in
Washington, D.C., is being
changed to a "longer-term, staff
directorship," said Camarillo,
who expects the move to "save
tremendous amounts of money."
Budget woes were the "lion's
share of the reason" Abel was
asked to step down, he explained.
Abel's salary as a full professor
is much larger than the money
expected to be paid to a full-time
staff director.
