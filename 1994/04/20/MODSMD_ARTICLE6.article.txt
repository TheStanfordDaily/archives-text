# Celebrating 'that bisexual, gay and lesbian people are here at Stanford'
## BGLAD hopes to raise awareness 
### Beth Berselli Staff writer 
Gays in the military, living with the
HIV-virus and same-sex marriages are
just a few of the issues that will be ex
plored during this year's celebration of
the Bisexual Gay Lesbian Awareness
Days.
The annual event — which kicks off
today and lasts for 10 days — is aimed at
"celebrating the fact that bisexual, gay
and lesbian people are here at Stanford

and out and proud of who they are," said
organizer Romy Kozak, a doctoral stu
dent in modern thought and literature.
"The main purpose of BGLAD is to af
firm and articulate the aspects of our
lives — historical and cultural — that are
not included in our Stanford education,"
said senior Natasha Iskander, an orga
nizer of the event.
The event will also serve to raise
awareness on campus about gay and les
bian issues, said Kozak. "Hopefully,
BGLAD will enhance the understanding

of the larger Stanford community about
what the gay and lesbian community is
all about."
"The whole purpose of BGLAD is to
open dialogue," said organizer Eric
Whitney, a senior. "I hope that people
who are gay, straight or even question
ing come and see that there are many as
pects of gay life that go beyond the
stereotypes."
Organizers are particularly enthusi-
astic about a performance by the
acclaimed Native American les
bian poet Chrystos tomorrow in
Roble Lounge at 7:30 p.m. "We're
really excited about having Chrys
tos because her presence will allow
us to articulate the diversity with
in the community," Kozak said.
"She's just an amazing
women," Iskander said of the
Seattle poet. "She speaks about
issues of sexuality, race and class
with honesty and clarity and
amazing forthrightness."
Whitney said many "timely"
issues are being addressed during
the event. A lecture by historian

Allan B6rube about the military's
anti-gay policy and a panel discus
sion titled "Living with HIV: Per
sonal Perspectives" exemplifies the
diversity and relevancy of this
year's programming, Whitney said.
Other featured events include
a speech by playwright Mart
Crowley, who wrote the gay clas
sic "The Boys in the Band." Whit
ney said the play was "ground
breaking because prior to its pro
duction off-Broadway 25 years
ago, plays of its nature were con
sidered taboo."
Organizers stress that the cele
bration is not only for gay and les
bian people. "We want to give the
impression of being inclusive, not
exclusive," Whitney said.
Whitney said that this year's
celebration features a "greater

breadth" in programming than in
previous years. In addition, the
event will last a couple of days
longer this year.
"I like the diversity of the pro
grams," Whitney said. "Overall, it
has a very positive feel to it."
Organizers say this year's cele
bration is especially significant
because 1994 marks the 25th
anniversary of the Stonewall inci
dent. The gay bar in New York
City was the site of a police raid in
June 1969, and"the working
class gay subculture — butches,
femmes and drag queens —
rebelled against the constant
police harassment in their
spaces," Iskander said.
"Stonewall was the night that
the gay liberation movement took
off," Kozak said.
