# African health care defended by speaker

### Rosalind Wang Staff writer 
Southern African health consul
tant Stephen Hendricks criticized
Western modes of thought as being
too narrow-minded when applied to
African health care systems in a
speech last night at Bechtel Inter
national Center.
"We need African solutions for
African problems," Hendricks said.
"We had our own indigenous health
care systems before external forces
came in."
Hendricks, a former consultant
for the Zimbabwe Health Ministry
and current research fellow at Har
vard University, examined the
positive aspects of "traditional heal
ers" — native African doctors
whom he said have been discredited
because they were not "scientific"
by Western standards.
"Western doctors won't believe
that someone else can find a cure.

They think, 'If we can't find it, then
no one else can,' " he said. "But
even with all the Western training
I've received, when I'm in my
grandmother's home I go for her
medicine."
Hendricks was the keynote
speaker for Africa Week, a series of
informational sessions and cultural
events sponsored by the Stanford
African Students Association.
The health care analyst warned
against believing in the superiority
of Western methods over native
ones, particularly in the training of
physicians.
"You look at how cold Western
medicine is, how it's like a produc
tion line," Hendricks said. "There is
very little discussion between the
patient and the physician. Then you
look at the 'witch doctors,' who
make you feel that there is more to
you than your medical problems.

Steve Hendricks speaks on Western and African
health care at Bechtel International Center last night.
Listening is important to the heal
ing process."
Hendricks said that attempts to
model the Southern African health
systems upon the Western model
would fail because of basic differ
ences in the ways of thinking.

"If today somebody wanted to
conjure up the spirits, people would
say, 'What nonsense!' But that is
what we believed. ... It is a part of
us that we will not give up.... We
need country-specific answers,"
Hendricks said.
Another flaw of Western
medicine described by Hendricks
was the "aura" created around
physicians, which prevents
patients from having any input and

gives too much power to the doc
tors.
"You're handing [physicians] a
blank check, saying, 'Do what you
think is best.' People know what is
best for them.... Patients must
become part of the decision-mak
ing process," Hendricks said.
The keys to improving the
health care in Southern Africa,
Hendricks said, include combining
aspects of Western medicine with

the wisdom of traditional healers
and increasing patient involvement
in the healing process.
"Doctors don't produce health,"
he said. "It takes patient, family,
and social teamwork."
Other recommendations includ
ed reforming the type of training
given to those in the medical prac
tice. Instead of training physicians
first and then finding where they
are needed, Hendricks said that the

more efficient method would be to
train physicians to meet existing
needs in the region.
The key to the improvements
would be to recognize the needs of
the people by listening to the peo
ple themselves.
"If we get participation from the
grass-roots with forums like this,
we can make sure our practices are
in tandem with the needs of the
people," Hendricks said.
