# African health care defended by speaker

### Rosalind Wang Staff writer 
Southern African health consul
tant Stephen Hendricks criticized
Western modes of thought as being
too narrow-minded when applied to
African health care systems in a
speech last night at Bechtel Inter
national Center.
"We need African solutions for
African problems," Hendricks said.
"We had our own indigenous health
care systems before external forces
came in."
Hendricks, a former consultant
for the Zimbabwe Health Ministry
and current research fellow at Har
vard University, examined the
positive aspects of "traditional heal
ers" — native African doctors
whom he said have been discredited
because they were not "scientific"
by Western standards.
"Western doctors won't believe
that someone else can find a cure.

They think, 'If we can't find it, then
no one else can,' " he said. "But
even with all the Western training
I've received, when I'm in my
grandmother's home I go for her
medicine."
Hendricks was the keynote
speaker for Africa Week, a series of
informational sessions and cultural
events sponsored by the Stanford
African Students Association.
The health care analyst warned
against believing in the superiority
of Western methods over native
ones, particularly in the training of
physicians.
"You look at how cold Western
medicine is, how it's like a produc
tion line," Hendricks said. "There is
very little discussion between the
patient and the physician. Then you
look at the 'witch doctors,' who
make you feel that there is more to
you than your medical problems.
