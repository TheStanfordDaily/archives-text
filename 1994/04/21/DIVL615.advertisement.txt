Over the years, I have studied on and ofF with voice teachers in the
U.S. and Europe. Umberto Gatica, my engineer, had spoken to me
about Seth Riggs. I began to work with him. For the first time in my
vocal life, I discovered my 'connected head voice.' I began to sing
tenor, high Cs and above. The new power, range and control was
amazing. Thank you, Seth, for your assistance on Hombre Solo."
