# 'You have to be one of those masochistic people'
## Medicine's final hurdle 
### 
Like their counterparts in
hospitals throughout the U.S.,
the 519 residents at Stanford
University Medical Center rep
resent the infantry of health care
— diagnosing illness, comforting
patients and their families, pre
scribing drugs, performing
surgery — all at low cost to the
institutions that employ them.
They are still in training, of
course — the final and most im
portant stage of their training as
physicians. The hours are long
and difficult, the work often un
glorified and tedious, the envi
ronment hierarchical and rigid.
But somehow residents slog
through another day and night,

and the transformation from
trainee to senior physician slow
ly, but inevitably, takes place.
In addition to learning the
requisite technical skills, the res
ident is also immersed in the cul
ture of medicine, quickly shed
ding romantic conceptions of
what being a doctor means and
adapting to medicine's own
ethos.
We approached four resi
dents from Stanford, all with
only a few months left in their
training, to describe their own
experience with the process, and
how it has affected them.
Today's stories are the first in a
two-part series.
