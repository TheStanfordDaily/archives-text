# Doctors in Training
## Surgeon trades film production for career in medicine 
### Ed Yoon Senior staff writer 
"I never used to eat out of vending machines
before," says Dr. Deborah Aaron, apologetically, as a
Diet Pepsi clunks to the bottom of one of the many
that line the hallway of Stanford Medical Center,
hulking symbols of the resident's way of life.
Now finding herself watching meals being pushed
slowly forward and reached through a metal slot,
Aaron has come a long way since her days as a film
major at New York University.
After graduating from NYU "during its heyday,"
she says, Aaron worked briefly at an advertising
agency and moved to Los Angeles to make television
commercials for several years. She then moved into
feature film production, as what she describes as a
"behind-the-scenes production organizing person."
"One thing I realized in film school was that I was
not a major artistic talent ready to unleash itself,"
she laughs. "I didn't feel like I had a big message to
deliver. I was a film major because I liked the
movies." Nevertheless, she admits, "it was a fun
thing to study."
Later working in feature film publicity, Aaron
came to a moment of decision: she had applied to
business schools, but suddenly realized during the
process that "I couldn't think of any great reason to
keep going in that direction."
Almost 30 at the time, she took stock of her inter
ests, and almost on a whim gambled on a future in
medicine. "I just really had a strong feeling," she
says. "No one in my family is a doctor, and I didn't

have anything to base it on — intuition or whatever."
So back to school she went, taking biology, chem
istry and physics, going on field trips with her biolo
gy classmates who were overjoyed to find someone
old enough to buy beer for them. After completing
all her pre-med requirements, she entered UCLA
Medical School.
Now 38, and finishing up her chief residency after
five years of training in general surgery, she
describes her work with the enthusiasm of someone
years younger.
"It's fun to work with your hands, to immerse
yourself in the technical aspects of someone's care,"
she says."And the responsibility for taking care of
patients in that way is just an awesome thing — it's
just incredible."
General surgeons deal with a variety of surgical
problems, ranging from breast lumpectomies to
bowel surgery, vascular surgery and pediatric
surgery. "There's such a variety of procedures," she
says. "That's what's fun about general surgery."
Nevertheless, like most other residents, the train
ing has been an extreme test of her physical, intel
lectual and emotional capacities, one that couldn't
possibly be anticipated or prepared for.
"It's been so much better, and so much harder
and worse in some ways than anything I would have
imagined," she says. "What we deal with day to day
are the crises in other people's lives — people finding
out they have cancer, people getting critically
injured in accidents. All those things happen — day
in and day out. It's routine, but it's not."
Aaron has her own analogy. "It's like psychically

donating a part of yourself," she says. "Like an
organ that you're just never going to get back, and
there's not enough time, money or anything that
will give you back what you give up to do this."
Aaron found her attitude towards residency shift
ing markedly as the years passed. Initially, the long
work hours, fatigue and emotional toll often pits
physicians against patients in an almost adversarial
relationship.
A patient may suddenly spike a fever during the
night, complain of pain or discomfort or fail to
respond to conventional therapy, leaving exhausted
residents sometimes angry and frustrated, and even
angry at the patients themselves.
"More work means less sleep for you — you get
kind of reduced to dealing with things on that basic
a level," she says. As someone who considers herself
"basically a nice person, a talker and a hand-holder,"
she says, "It's hard to be nice when you're working
as hard as you do."
However, as the level of responsibility grows,
"you start to realize that it's not your job to keep
sick people out of the hospital," she says. "In fact,
you are supposed to admit sick people into the hos
pital, even if it's more work for you. You start
becoming or feeling more like a patient advocate —
that's how things work for me."
'A little more aggressive'
However, Aaron admits — with a laugh — that
she thought about quitting daily "for probably more
than half the time I was a resident. But I think
that's just an immature coping mechanism, some
means of fighting back or saying to yourself, 'I don't
have to do this.' "
She admits that the training has probably
changed her, though she's somewhat at a loss to
describe precisely how. "I've probably gotten a little
more aggressive," she says, as she describes a stint
at Santa Clara County Medical Center.
"I used to come home and start barking orders at
my husband," she says. " 'Do that,' 'Put that away'
— he didn't like that very much."
But she persevered. And now, with a schedule
that consists of visiting patients at about 6 a.m, then
disappearing into the operating room at about 7:30,
then making rounds again at 6 p.m., studying X
rays, calling for lab tests, preparing for the next
day's cases, it is, by her own admission, "a long day."
However, she thrives in the clinical environment
and plans to set up shop in Arizona after celebrating
and spending some time "decompressing."
"The day just goes by, you're absorbed in what
you're doing, you're that concentrated," she says.
Then with a grin she says, "It's almost relaxing."
No special burden for women
Aaron doesn't think she fits the stereotypical
"surgeon" persona — aggressive, rigid, brusque.
And she doesn't think women carry any special bur
den in a field such as surgery.
However;' she does admit that expectations of
women — more often among colleagues and other
members of the health care team, rather than
among patients — might differ from those of men.
"There are people on some level that really do not
like being told what to do by a woman," she says."And
I think some of that affects the interactions you have,
and as your level of responsibility goes up, and you're

in a position to say, 'You do this, or You do that, I
think there's probably a little bit of resistance."
She's found that having other women in such a
small program makes a difference. Overall, 34 per
cent of Stanford's residents are female, and they
tend to concentrate in fields like internal medicine,
pediatrics, psychiatry and obstetrics, though women
have passed through all of the specialties.

It's fun to work with your hands,
to immerse yourself in the techni
cal aspects of someone's
And the responsibility for taking
care of patients in that way is just
an awesome thing — it's just
incredible.'

"When I came into the program it had a lot of
women," she says, though most of them have
already graduated. "I think on a day-to-day basis
that makes me more comfortable, because maybe
there is a camaraderie or friendship between women
and women that is not between women and men.
Certainly you don't want to necessarily do some of
the things guys would often do."
'Suddenly you're in charge'
Though she's adapted to her harrowing schedule
and projects an air of easygoing confidence, Aaron
believes there's still much to learn.
"Say you're the anesthesiologist in the ER
attending, and somebody comes in really bad shape,
and they start to deteriorate," she says."And sud
denly you're not the resident anymore. You're in
charge. I still don't even know what that feels like.
You have to make clear decisions with an inadequate
amount of information."
A particular patient — her stepfather — gave an
especially unique lesson. At Stanford earlier this
year for a biopsy and surgery, "he was operated on
and taken care of by people that I knew and worked
with," she says.
Playing the role of the family member, she says,
gave an unusual perspective on a procedure that
had since seemed routine. "I've probably been
nicer in response to other people's families since
then," she says."I think that it's made a big dif
ference."
During her stint in the movie business, Aaron
loved the work because it was "hectic, stressful, fran
tic, with odd hours and new things every day." And
she's found the same qualities in surgery, affecting
lives with a much greater impact than before.
Like an actor, she says, "you get to experience
hundreds of lives that you'll never know, and people
will tell you things they never tell anyone else."
"I don't think there's anything better that you
could possibly do as far as work goes," she says.
"There's such a spectrum of all personality types, a
variety of opportunities — I can't see how it
wouldn't be interesting."
