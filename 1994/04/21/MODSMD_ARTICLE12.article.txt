# Clinton urges safe-zone air strikes

WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Clinton declared yesterday that Serb
forces responsible for the carnage in the
Muslim enclave of Gorazde "must pay a
higher price" for their unrelenting
attacks. He called for more aggressive
NATO air strikes to stop assaults on safe
havens throughout Bosnia.
Acknowledging that the situation in
Gorazde is increasingly grim, Clinton
urged NATO to ban all heavy weapons
from Gorazde and other designated areas,
as was done last month to break the siege
of Sarajevo.
Clinton, at a White House news con
ference, said the Sarajevo approach was
best despite apprehension among some
allies.
"Under the Sarajevo model you can
say, 'OK, here's the safe zone, all the
heavy weaponry has to be withdrawn or
put under U.N. control' and if there's any
violation by anybody, there can be air

action," the president said. "It is a much
clearer thing."
Clinton's plan represents a shift in pol
icy alter months of indecision and takes
the United States and its allies deeper
into Bosnia's two-year civil war, which
has left 200,000 people dead or missing.
NATO signaled it was willing to go
along with Clinton's proposal but delayed
final approval to give military advisers
time to consider the best way to proceed.
Clinton also urged tightening sanc
tions on Serbia through stricter enforce
ment.
The president said the United States,
Russia and their European allies planned
"a major diplomatic initiative" to end the
strife in the former Yugoslavia. He did
not provide details, saying they remain to
be worked out.
"Air power alone will not settle this
conflict," said Clinton. "This conflict will
have to be settled through negotiations."

There are six safe havens designated
by the United Nations, including Saraje
vo and Gorazde.
Sarajevo was singled out by NATO
when the capital was besieged by Bosni
an Serb artillery. NATO threatened the
Serbs with punitive air strikes unless
they removed their heavy weapons
from a "free zone" around the city or
placed them under the control of U.N.
troops.
The Serbs generally complied, no air
strikes were undertaken and life in the
city has been limping back to normal.
However, the Serbs recently have seized
or tried to reclaim some of their weapons
by force. They have not been punished.
Reports from Gorazde were filled with
despair. Doctors and foreign aid workers
said Serb gunners were firing point-blank
at the main hospital and bombarding the
Muslim enclave with artillery shells,
rockets and heavy machine guns.
