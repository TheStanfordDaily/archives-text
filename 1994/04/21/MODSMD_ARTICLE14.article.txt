## Editorial Media access denied 
### 
Ytesterday The Daily and other
outside media were barred
from entering and covering a
community meeting at El Centro
Chicano with Provost Condoleezza
Rice. The meeting was held to dis
cuss the recent firing of Cecilia
Burciaga, an associate dean in the
Office of Student Affairs and a res
ident fellow in Casa Zapata.
According to University policy, an
"open" meeting is one which "all
who wish to do so may attend" while
a closed meeting is described as
"attendance limited to members of
the sponsoring department, office or
organization or specifically invited
guest." By California state law, the
media may cover any open meeting.
A Daily reporter called El Centro
yesterday afternoon and confirmed
that the meeting was in fact open.
However, when three Daily
reporters tried to enter the meeting
at El Centro, they were stopped by
"bouncers." Two large male students
stood in front of the door and pre
vented the reporters from entering.
But they allowed anyone they
"knew" to enter, including more
than 100 people of all ethnicities:
students, staff, administrators and
faculty members. There was no
actual invitation list or membership
requirement, even though a sign on
the door stated that the meeting
was "private."
The "bouncers" discriminated
solely against the media.
Frances Morales, director of El
Centro, said she wanted an "inti
mate" meeting between the Provost
and the Chicano community. She
and other organizers publicized the
meeting — to what turned out to be
a standing-room-only crowd —
specifically stating that the press
would not be present.
Morales and others at Stanford
must be educated about University
policy and must realize that an
"open" meeting which bars the press
is impermissible. It is not a matter of
negotiation. It is a matter of law.
In addition, Rice, who was aware
of the debate concerning press
attendance, did not stick up for the
rights of the media. Although there
was confusion originally between

Rice and Morales over the format of
the meeting, as people entered El
Centro it was clear the meeting was
open to anyone but the press.
Afterwards, Rice admitted that
The Daily should have been able to
attend, given the nature of the
meeting. She should have clearly
stated this at the outset.
The media's rights cannot be
compromised at anyone's conve
nience. For example, while mem
bers of MEChA, the Chicano/Latino
student group, urged The Daily last
week to report on their special-fee
error so they could better inform
the community hours before the
ASSU election, many Chicano com
munity members yesterday dis
played outright hostility to The
Daily, refusing to speak to a
reporter even after the meeting.
Imagine a reverse situation: a
large group of students held a meet
ing with Rice in which they offered
their support for the decision to fire
Burciaga. If two physically intimi
dating students stood at the door
and barred the media, would the
Chicano community support such
censorship?
If other groups begin to employ
such intimidation tactics against The
Daily or other media organizations, it
will only come back to hurt these
communities — in the filtering and
suppression of information. Free
dom of the press is not conditional.
The Stanford campus should not
tolerate — and The Daily will not
tolerate — such intimidation, dis
crimination and censorship. If an
open meeting occurs on campus
that we believe is newsworthy, we
will cover it — even if it means
bringing in police or lawyers.
It is time for groups across cam
pus to re-examine the hypocritical
attitudes they have toward the
media, specifically The Daily. A uni
versity should have a free flow of
information at all times — some
thing students were clamoring for
throughout the budget-cutting pro
cess, but clearly rejected yesterday.
It is in Stanford's best interest to
keep the events on this campus
accessible to the media. That is
what America is all about.
