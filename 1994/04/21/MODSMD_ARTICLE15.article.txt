## Create, but not for art's sake 
### 
THE PHRASE "art for art's sake"
never made much sense to me. Who
the hell is this Art guy anyway, and
why do I want to work my butt off on
some performance or project that he's
never going to see?
I always thought there should be a
motto for creating art that had a little
more logic or punch to it. Like, "art for
making you look at the world in a differ
ent way's sake," or "art kicks ass!"
But mottoes like that would never
catch on. Most people aren't into art like
that; they don't stop to look at it every
day. Just think about the last time you
sped by The Thinker or the architecture
of the Quad.
We have been conditioned to an art
for-art's-sake world where we are sold
enjoyable, disposable, digestible enter
tainment that fills us up while we see it,
but leaves us empty come time for the
next meal. We are encouraged to enjoy
art that doesn't touch our lives, that's
not provoking. Art shouldn't be a re
entry into reality, it should be a break
from it.
We are taught to look at art from a
detached standpoint, one where it's
almost impossible to be critical. If a
painting, for instance, lives in its own
reality, then it's impossible for it to suck.
Just ask an instructor what he/she thinks
of your latest acrylic sneeze on canvas.
The technique or composition will range
from "nice" to "good," and never once

has a professor not liked what a student
did "with that area there."
Is it any surprise that in a world of art
that cannot be judged we wonder what
good another artist bring the world?
But that critique of art is passe, cliche,
Perrier. What am I saying that hasn't
been said a thousand times before? I'm
saying just paint it, sculpt it, sing it,
sketch it, act it or dance it. It's spring
quarter, the time when even the most
aesthetically challenged (in terms of tal
ent, not appearance) have the opportuni
ty to join in the creation of art all around
campus. But when you get out there to
make that idea a reality, take a moment
to think before you start.
Whatever you do, make sure that you
and others are getting something from
your art. Give it a purpose greater than
that of creating something "nice." I
worked with a director once who would
scream at the top of his lungs: "Nice?
Nice? Toilet paper's nice!" every time he
heard that compliment.
He was right. Art shouldn't be "nice,"
it should create a reaction. And while the
response doesn't have to be positive,
there should be a response That's how
you'll know you're doing your job.
Let's say you are in a show. And let's
say someone comes to one of your perfor
mances, call her Peggy. Now, let's just
suppose Peggy is moved by your show, so
moved that she decides to play the hot
new Eurosingles "Shaved My Head 'Cuz

My Life Sucks!" and"I Can't Act But I
Still Think Your Play's Pretentious!" at
maximum volume right outside your the
ater during one of your performances.
Then maybe she decides to throw a fuse
and cut your power, subjecting you to
electrical sabotage.
Now you've got a reaction.
Now you're doing your job.
I don't think art has to be controver
sial to be good, but it should make you
think. Art should not be passed by â€” it
should call on the spectator to partici
pate.
We love art so much, yet it takes the
sun and relaxed atmosphere of spring
quarter to get people in gear enough to
actually make it or even go out and see it.
Be an artist. Create. Tell people who
snivel at your inspiration, "I wear plaid
on the outside, because plaid is how I feel
on the inside!" Do improvisational dance
performances to the soundtrack of
"Jesus Christ Superstar" in White Plaza
Stand up in the middle of lecture and
recite Beatnik poetry to your professor.
Shake the world a little.
