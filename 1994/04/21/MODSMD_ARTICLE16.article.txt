## Daily used faulty logic for amendment endorsement 
### 
THE CAMPAIGN AGAINST The
Daily's special fee last week
should be explained to the stu
dent body.
On April 4 The Daily's editorial on
the splitting special-fee amendment
was misleading. It implied that if the
amendment passed a special fee would
require separate majority support from
both undergraduate and graduate con
stituencies to be funded.
Actually, the amendment would
require both groups to vote in favor if
both groups were to fund the fee, but
would allow one group to fund a fee if
only one group supported it. In a letter
I suggested that the Daily correct
themselves with language such as "the
amendment requires both bodies to
disapprove a fee for the special fee not
to pass."
The Daily recognized this mistake
and corrected it — but incorrectly. It
claimed that "student groups [would]
receive part of their fee if just one [of
the bodies (undergrad or grad)] passed
the fee request." However, the amend
ment states that if just one body
passed the request that body would pay
the entire fee. I corrected The Daily
again in a letter that was not pub
lished. The Daily's repeated mistakes
suggested a misunderstanding of the
amendment.
On April 11 The Daily's election
endorsement editorial against the
amendment came out. In its words
"The biggest problem is the amend
ment does not require a minimum per
centage of undergraduates and gradu
ates to vote." Accurate so far. "Rather
it simply mandates that 15 percent of
the ASSU's members must vote."
This is simply wrong. There was no
minimum requirement in the amend
ment. It was by now clear to me The
Daily really did not understand the
amendment. Finally, it goes into its
logic based on incorrect facts. "... if
15 per cent of all students voted in an

election, but only one graduate student
and he or she voted against every spe
cial fee, undergraduates would immedi
ately shoulder the entire fee for all
groups they approved. All graduates
would pay nothing."
It is true that only one graduate stu
dent's vote against a special fee would
make undergraduates shoulder the
entire fee. But the 15 percent rule
would have done nothing to stop this.
The rule states that the default vote is
no, and unless 15 percent of the gradu
ate students voted in favor of a fee
(and this number was greater than the
number voting against), then the
undergraduates would pay the whole
fee.
The absence of the rule would not
"make it possible for a handful of dis
enchanted graduate students to double
undergraduate fees overnight" as
claimed by The Daily. Such a rule
would in fact make it more likely for
undergraduates to shoulder the entire
fee. If this was The Daily's concern, it
should have campaigned for the
amendment.
I am left with the impression that
The Daily really didn't know what was
going on and needed someone to
explain some reason to vote against
the amendment. Perhaps what The
Daily should have said was "if only one
graduate student voted, and voted in
favor of all the special fees, graduates
would have been immediately bur
dened with half the special fees when
there was only one graduate support
ing them." This would have been a
valid argument in favor of the rule.
This having been explained to The
Daily, it used this justification for
going against the amendment in its
election days' editorial.
What we saw was either scare tactics
or a complete misunderstanding of the
amendment. There was no mention of
the graduate student tea party which
forced refund rates up this year, reduc

ing funding for groups. No mention of
graduates subsidizing undergraduate
activities. No mention of "The Daily
just cannot understand this amend
ment and if we cannot how are stu
dents expected to be able to vote on it.
So vote no."
Instead we saw inaccurate facts and
bad logic. However, all was not lost. I
sent the paper a letter on Monday cor
recting their facts. I also called on sev
eral occasions. I warned The Daily that
if it did not publish my letter or correct
the facts in the editorial I would make
efforts to defeat The Daily's special fee.
I was told by a member of the editorial
board that I was wasting their time.
(Lesson number one: the paper wasted
more time trying to repair the damage
done by my campaign. Lesson for all of
us: problems don't go away if we ignore
them.)
I even went to see The Daily staff
members in person, but they were
stuck in their ways. I clearly stated
that my complaint was not with their
conclusion, even though I disagreed
with it, but with their logic and facts.
But they were not for changing. The
editor told me that there was no room
for corrections or letters this week, and
perhaps the letter could be published
next week.
She said the editorial had been
revised, but would not allow me to
look at it. Given the history of errors, I
had no option but to start the cam
paign against The Daily in earnest,
producing flyers that Tuesday night.
The revised editorial did omit the
inaccurate facts and logic, basing the
rejection of the amendment on the
lack of the 15 percent rule, but with
out acknowledgments of their earlier
mistakes.
"No room for letters or corrections."
Imagine my surprise when I saw the
third of a page ad on Wednesday, and
full page ad on Thursday. The Daily
claimed that "supporting The Daily . . .

will ensure that student press at Stan
ford remains vibrant, open and repre
sentative of a diverse range of student
viewpoints."
Make what you will of these claims.
The students voted in favor of The
Daily in the election. But how many of
these students knew the facts stated
above? Who was going to inform
them? The Daily would not publish
my letters and I could not afford a full
page ad costing hundreds of dollars.
My fight with The Daily has not been
won, or lost, yet. We can only know if
this is a victory when we see more
open commentary in The Daily, more
accurate reporting and logic and more
honesty in what the editors don't
understand. Most importantly, more
letters. If that doesn't happen we all
lose.

the bodies (undergrad or grad)] passed
the fee request." However, the amend
ment states that if just one body
passed the request that body would pay
the entire fee. I corrected The Daily
again in a letter that was not pub
lished. The Daily's repeated mistakes
suggested a misunderstanding of the
amendment.
On April 11 The Daily's election
endorsement editorial against the
amendment came out. In its words
"The biggest problem is the amend
ment does not require a minimum per
centage of undergraduates and gradu
ates to vote." Accurate so far. "Rather
it simply mandates that 15 percent of
the ASSU's members must vote."
This is simply wrong. There was no
minimum requirement in the amend
ment. It was by now clear to me The
Daily really did not understand the
amendment. Finally, it goes into its
logic based on incorrect facts. "... if
15 per cent of all students voted in an

election, but only one graduate student
and he or she voted against every spe
cial fee, undergraduates would immedi
ately shoulder the entire fee for all
groups they approved. All graduates
would pay nothing."
It is true that only one graduate stu
dent's vote against a special fee would
make undergraduates shoulder the
entire fee. But the 15 percent rule
would have done nothing to stop this.
The rule states that the default vote is
no, and unless 15 percent of the gradu
ate students voted in favor of a fee
(and this number was greater than the
number voting against), then the
undergraduates would pay the whole
fee.
The absence of the rule would not
"make it possible for a handful of dis
enchanted graduate students to double
undergraduate fees overnight" as
claimed by The Daily. Such a rule
would in fact make it more likely for
undergraduates to shoulder the entire
fee. If this was The Daily's concern, it
should have campaigned for the
amendment.
I am left with the impression that
The Daily really didn't know what was
going on and needed someone to
explain some reason to vote against
the amendment. Perhaps what The
Daily should have said was "if only one
graduate student voted, and voted in
favor of all the special fees, graduates
would have been immediately bur
dened with half the special fees when
there was only one graduate support
ing them." This would have been a
valid argument in favor of the rule.
This having been explained to The
Daily, it used this justification for
going against the amendment in its
election days' editorial.
What we saw was either scare tactics
or a complete misunderstanding of the
amendment. There was no mention of
the graduate student tea party which
forced refund rates up this year, reduc

ing funding for groups. No mention of
graduates subsidizing undergraduate
activities. No mention of "The Daily
just cannot understand this amend
ment and if we cannot how are stu
dents expected to be able to vote on it.
So vote no."
Instead we saw inaccurate facts and
bad logic. However, all was not lost. I
sent the paper a letter on Monday cor
recting their facts. I also called on sev
eral occasions. I warned The Daily that
if it did not publish my letter or correct
the facts in the editorial I would make
efforts to defeat The Daily's special fee.
I was told by a member of the editorial
board that I was wasting their time.
(Lesson number one: the paper wasted
more time trying to repair the damage
done by my campaign. Lesson for all of
us: problems don't go away if we ignore
them.)
I even went to see The Daily staff
members in person, but they were
stuck in their ways. I clearly stated
that my complaint was not with their
conclusion, even though I disagreed
with it, but with their logic and facts.
But they were not for changing. The
editor told me that there was no room
for corrections or letters this week, and
perhaps the letter could be published
next week.
She said the editorial had been
revised, but would not allow me to
look at it. Given the history of errors, I
had no option but to start the cam
paign against The Daily in earnest,
producing flyers that Tuesday night.
The revised editorial did omit the
inaccurate facts and logic, basing the
rejection of the amendment on the
lack of the 15 percent rule, but with
out acknowledgments of their earlier
mistakes.
"No room for letters or corrections."
Imagine my surprise when I saw the
third of a page ad on Wednesday, and
full page ad on Thursday. The Daily
claimed that "supporting The Daily . . .

will ensure that student press at Stan
ford remains vibrant, open and repre
sentative of a diverse range of student
viewpoints."
Make what you will of these claims.
The students voted in favor of The
Daily in the election. But how many of
these students knew the facts stated
above? Who was going to inform
them? The Daily would not publish
my letters and I could not afford a full
page ad costing hundreds of dollars.
My fight with The Daily has not been
won, or lost, yet. We can only know if
this is a victory when we see more
open commentary in The Daily, more
accurate reporting and logic and more
honesty in what the editors don't
understand. Most importantly, more
letters. If that doesn't happen we all
lose.

THE CAMPAIGN AGAINST The
Daily's special fee last week
should be explained to the stu
dent body.
On April 4 The Daily's editorial on
the splitting special-fee amendment
was misleading. It implied that if the
amendment passed a special fee would
require separate majority support from
both undergraduate and graduate con
stituencies to be funded.
Actually, the amendment would
require both groups to vote in favor if
both groups were to fund the fee, but
would allow one group to fund a fee if
only one group supported it. In a letter
I suggested that the Daily correct
themselves with language such as "the
amendment requires both bodies to
disapprove a fee for the special fee not
to pass."
The Daily recognized this mistake
and corrected it — but incorrectly. It
claimed that "student groups [would]
receive part of their fee if just one [of
the bodies (undergrad or grad)] passed
the fee request." However, the amend
ment states that if just one body
passed the request that body would pay
the entire fee. I corrected The Daily
again in a letter that was not pub
lished. The Daily's repeated mistakes
suggested a misunderstanding of the
amendment.

amendment came out. In its words
"The biggest problem is the amend
