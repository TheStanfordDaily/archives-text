## YCMAD endorsement overlooked importance of community impact 
### 
The Stanford Daily enjoys quite a
status on this campus. Many under
graduate and graduate students alike
make it a morning ritual to read it
cover to cover.
Even those who are not quite as
firmly engrossed still rely on the paper
for information about campus activi
ties, events and controversies. In
effect, The Daily is the major informer
on campus. And we believe what we see
in print.
Remember the long line of students
who waited in front of the Stanford
Bookstore in hopes of getting a refund
from Bookstore overpricing? April
Fool's, courtesy of The Daily. It's hard
to believe, and even harder to admit,
but for many, the information on those
printed pages is seen as the truth and
the hard facts. This view is a tribute to
the power of the written word. That's
quite a power for a campus newspaper
to enjoy. Though it may still win the
publishing awards, The Stanford Daily
has gotten sloppy. And by getting slop
py, it has abused its power.
I was compelled to write this letter
after I read The Daily's ASSU election
endorsement description of the You
Can Make a Difference Conference. In
it, the Daily's editorial board of eight
members, self-described as "including

Daily editors, staff members and at
large community members," came to
some conclusions, that I, as the
YCMAD co-chair, know to be complete
ly wrong.
This year's topic was "Cities in Cri
sis: Promoting Urban Change," a con
ference that explored what's going on
in our inner cities today, from youth
gangs to welfare reform to police vio
lence. In the post-L.A. riot era, there
have been serious controversies sur
rounding San Francisco's Matrix pro
gram and the "three strikes, you're
out" initiative. Are these the issues the
Daily editorial board has deemed "eso
teric"? Is this where YCMAD has
"failed to select topics of popular inter
est"? If so, I would recommend that
the editorial board get out more.
Also, the Daily board took much
pride in pointing to YCMAD's atten
dance numbers as an indication of
value. It seems the board mistakenly
assumed that the 400 conference atten
dees were the only ones impacted on
Stanford campus. In addition, there
are the 250 students who attended a
week of Special Projects, the 30 confer
ence student organizers, the 130 con
ference day student volunteers, the
advisory board of 30 of the best faculty
and staff on campus, the 120 local
activist organizations that participated
in the Opportunities Faire and the 300-
plus people on and off campus contact
ed and interviewed to bring the week of
events together. YCMAD can be very
proud of the quality and extent of its
contribution to the Stanford communi

ty this year, and most certainly in
future years.
But this is an issue that goes beyond
special fees. Simply put, we, as readers,
as critical readers, who question the
vast amount of images and opinions we
are spoon-fed, enjoy a certain power,
too. It's a power that can be exercised
if we do one thing: snap out of it.
Demand to be well-informed and
don't depend solely on The Daily to do
it. The Daily is entrusted with the
valuable duty of keeping the campus
informed. It seems we, as students,
need to be more careful with whom we
entrust with that duty.
