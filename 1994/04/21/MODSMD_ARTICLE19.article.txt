# Stanford has lost trust of Chicano community after Burciaga's firing
## 
### 
Still reeling from the exhaustive
effort which went into writing the
"Strategic Plan," the Chicano communi
ty was surprised and shocked by layoffs
this spring quarter of two important
members of our community. Cecilia Bur
ciaga and Margarita Ibarra, after 20 and
22 years of service to Stanford, respec
tively, were informed that their services
are no longer needed at Stanford.
The unprofessional manner in which
Burciaga and Ibarra were informed of

their layoffs is an affront to the entire
community and, while their loss will be
felt by many at this University, the Chi
cano/Latino community will be most
directly impacted by their absence.
As other letters have documented,
Burciaga and Ibarra were dismissed in a
most disrespectful fashion: notified min
utes before meetings with the Provost
(Burciaga) and co-workers (Ibarra), and
without any prior consultation. Stanford
must realize that when one member of
our community is disrespected, the
entire community is disrespected and
feels the pain of such an act.
As we grow up, we learn at a young
age that to be bien educado (well educat
ed), it is not measured by the degrees a
person holds but by the way one shows
respect to others. Stanford as a degree
granting institution has a long way to go
before one can say that it knows how to
treat its members with respect.
To certain top level administrators,
Burciaga and Ibarra may appear as indi
viduals performing various functions
that can easily be reassigned upon their
leave. But Burciaga and Ibarra are also
valued members of a Stanford Chicano/
Latino community they helped to shape.
Both have been here since the early
'70s when Chicanos first came to Stan
ford in significant numbers. They have
helped develop institutions such as the
Chicano Fellows Program, Casa Zapata
and El Centro Chicano as well as sup
ported individual students to achieve
their academic goals and intellectual
pursuits â€” all of which serve to confirm
and validate our presence at this Univer

sity.
Through their unique contributions,
generations of Chicano students have
been able to thrive at Stanford and have
launched the University into an era of
unparalleled diversity.
Stanford has a lot of work ahead to
gain the trust of the Chicano/Latino
community once again. Chicano alumni
will certainly not be so willing to con
tribute to Stanford knowing Burciaga
and Ibarra, two people who made their
education at Stanford possible by advis
ing and mentoring them when others
questioned their intellectual potential,
were disrespected and kicked out of
Stanford.
Potential graduate and undergradu
ate students will certainly think twice
of the values of an institution that dis
respects people of color. Our current
students who are the next group of
alums with potential to contribute to
Stanford will also question how they
will support an institution that forgets
very quickly about the members that
made Stanford the pluralistic institu
tion it is today.
As Stanford moves into the 21st cen
tury, will it do so at the expense of peo
ple of color and its valued employees, or
will it start dialogue with its communi
ties of color and bring them to the table
to consult with them not as isolated
individuals, but as communities who
share a history of perseverance and
unity?
