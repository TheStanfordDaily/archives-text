# Neurosurgeon runs the gauntlet of residency
## 
### Ed Yoon Senior staff writer 
Neurosurgeons realize that theirs is not a
happy field: tumors, infections and trauma,
even when treated with the highest standard
of care, often rob patients of their ability to
speak, walk or think as clearly as before. But
occasionally, unmitigated triumphs do occur.
Perhaps the most dramatic case this year

for Dr. Alan Efron, chief resident in neuro
surgery at Stanford Medical Center, involved
a secretary who, while at work, suddenly
couldn't see to one side and complained of
terrible headaches.
In the ambulance she suddenly collapsed
into a coma, and her respirations had deteri
orated to the extent that a breathing tube had
to be inserted. A further complication was
that she was pregnant, nearly full-term, and

the fetus was in distress.
After a page from the junior resident and a
scramble to the Emergency Room, Efron
could see that the patient was dying — her
pupil was dilated, and didn't contract in re
sponse to light — and an immediate CT scan
confirmed extensive bleeding into the right
side of her brain.
