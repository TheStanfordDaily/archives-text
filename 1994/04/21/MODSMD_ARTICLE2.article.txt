# Neurosurgeon runs the gauntlet of residency
## 
### Ed Yoon Senior staff writer 
Neurosurgeons realize that theirs is not a
happy field: tumors, infections and trauma,
even when treated with the highest standard
of care, often rob patients of their ability to
speak, walk or think as clearly as before. But
occasionally, unmitigated triumphs do occur.
Perhaps the most dramatic case this year

for Dr. Alan Efron, chief resident in neuro
surgery at Stanford Medical Center, involved
a secretary who, while at work, suddenly
couldn't see to one side and complained of
terrible headaches.
In the ambulance she suddenly collapsed
into a coma, and her respirations had deteri
orated to the extent that a breathing tube had
to be inserted. A further complication was
that she was pregnant, nearly full-term, and

the fetus was in distress.
After a page from the junior resident and a
scramble to the Emergency Room, Efron
could see that the patient was dying — her
pupil was dilated, and didn't contract in re
sponse to light — and an immediate CT scan
confirmed extensive bleeding into the right
side of her brain.
While an obstetric team delivered
the child by Cesarean section, Dr.
Efron, after about three hours of
careful — and rapid — surgery,
located the cause of the problem.
"During the craniotomy they
delivered the baby," he says."And
you hear this baby crying, and it's
healthy and looks good. Mean
while I'm taking this clot out, and
I found the vascular malforma
tion, which I figured I would find
— so I excised that and I took the
pressure off the brain and closed
everything back up."
Generally, such gross injury to
the brain demands conservative
and hopeful watching after surgery
— with no guarantees on the final
outcome. The patient was moved
into the intensive care unit with
the breathing tube still in place.

'Here I am, I'm going
to be 33 years old,
and I'm still a boy.
I'm still getting hollered
at by grownups.'

"We figured she would be pret
ty sick, because her brain had
been subject to a huge amount of
pressure," he says."And by the
next morning, we had removed
her breathing tube and she was
yelling at me about her haircut. I
thought that was probably the
biggest triumph I'd had, because
it was one of those instances
where every step of the system
worked, from the paramedics
going to get her, to the emergency
room, to the CT scanner, to the
neurosurgeons to the 08-GYN."
'Real indentured servitude'
The neurosurgery residency
spans six to eight years of post
graduate training after medical
school — one of the longest and
most grueling residencies in
medicine, reflecting the complexi

ty and delicacy of brain and
spinal-cord surgery. Each year,
only about 100 new residents
begin such training in the United
States, and Stanford accepts only
one new resident per year.
As chief resident, Efron keeps
tabs, via the interns and junior
residents, on all patients coming
through the neurosurgery ser
vice. The bulk of his time is spent
in the operating room, however —
selecting the most interesting
surgical cases to expand his surgi
cal repertoire. "They'll have two
or three rooms going, and I'll look
at the schedule and say, 'Well,
this is the most interesting room
today.' "
As chief resident, Efron makes
rounds on all the patients at 6
a.m., visiting the patients individ
ually and coming up with a plan
for the day with the team of resi
dents and nurses.
He hits the operating room at
7:30 a.m., and might not emerge
until evening. When he does, he
makes rounds on the patients
again, and deals with whatever
complications arise, returning to
the hospital if necessary.
Efron's specific interests in
neurosurgery include tumors of
the skull base — which require
difficult approaches to the brain
— and the embryonic field of neu
roendoscopy, the use of flexible
fiber-optic scopes designed to per
form a kind of surgery by "remote
control" without requiring exten
sive opening of the skull.
Efron has been at Stanford
since September of 1983, though
"there are guys who've been here
even longer than that," he says.
As a surgeon, his first year out of
medical school was spent in a gen
eral surgical internship during
which all surgeons, regardless of
specialty, must spend several
weeks in each of the various sur
gical services.
"Real indentured servitude,"
he says with a laugh at the men
tion of internship. "When you're a
medical student you think you're
low on the pecking order, and then
you get an M.D. and become an

intern and then you realize that
you've sunk to your lowest."
"Basically, you're everybody's
gofer," Efron says. "You think,
'This is what I spent $100,000 to
do?' Everything runs downhill to
you. Everybody pages you all the
time — they want their X-rays
delivered to a certain place, they
want their labs rounded up and
analyzed.
"You're responsible for taking
histories and doing all the physi
cals on admissions. You bear first
responsibility if something goes
wrong the patient — taking care
of them in the middle of the night
— but you just try to be a good
soldier and follow orders."
Efron says it seems less incred
ible that the neurosurgical resi
dency takes so long than that it
can be learned at all within that
short span of time.

'Although I have a lot
of interests, I can't
imagine by this time
in my life being as
proficient in any one
of them, where I
could feel a sense of
triumph and sense of
accomplishment as I
feel at this point.'

"Just six years ago, I'd be mak
ing rounds with these guys and
the attending would be saying,
'OK, this guy needs a lumbar
puncture, this guy needs X-rays
brought to my office, this guy
needs that.' And now they're
putting up a CT scan on the board
and saying, 'Alan, how would you
approach this tumor, what do you
think we should do?' In the space
of six years — it's phenomenal."
But in a field renown for

intense personalities and a gung
ho, cabalistic attitude, there were
times of self-doubt. For Efron the
doubts began in medical school.
Then internship rolled around —
"I thought, 'This is pretty brutal,
and it's for the birds,' " he says.
The long night of internship
was replaced by residency, with
more time spent in the operating
room and greater responsibilities
and decision-making power.
But even then, he says, "You
have your moments where you
say, 'Is it worth it?' There's so
many years and early on in the
residency I'd say, 'There's so
much to learn in neurosurgery.
It's hard for me to imagine get
ting to that end point where I
know as much as these guys who
are teaching me.' "
The stresses are undeniable.
Physically, of course, "you're just
so tired," he says. And the
inevitable comparison with col
lege friends seem to offer only
bleak contrasts.
"Here I am, I'm going to be 33
years old, and I'm still a boy,"
Efron laughs. "I'm still getting
hollered at by grownups."
Sense of humor 'essential*
"I think you have to be one
those masochistic people that
seems to delight in pushing them
selves to the furthest limits,"
Efron says, discussing the type
who chooses neurosurgery as a
specialty. "Because you really do
get pushed in all ways — physical
ly, intellectually and emotionally."
And it's "very, very taxing on
relationships" he says, simply
because the marriage between
doctor and hospital rivals any
commitment to one's spouse,
even if he or she is a fellow physi
cian. Efron says it's no secret that
divorce rates are high.
To survive the pressure, a
sense of humor "is essential," he
says. "In many ways, it's a very
depressing field because you're
dealing with kids and young peo
ple your own age that come to
you, and the first time you see
them you make a diagnosis of a

terrible disease process. You
know that the only thing you're
going to be able to do is try to pro
long their life with the best quali
ty possible."
But he believes having other
interests — even if they exist only
in theory, not in practice — helps
maintain balance in such an
intense calling.
"We like to think that you have
to be intellectually diverse," he
says."I think you have to be,
because if you get bogged down in
this it becomes awfully confining
at times.
"When you're sitting there and
operating on somebody's brain
stem for hour after hour, and
thinking that their outcome, their
life and the life for their family is
going to be dependent on what
you do in the next few millime
ters, in the next few hours —
when your skill is being brought

to boar — I think that's one of the
greatest challenges any human
being can face."
So to the cliched question of
whether he would do it all again,
Efron says he would. "But I think
you could take any neurosurgeon
at different points in their
career," he adds, "and they'd
answer that question differently,
and I know there have been times
when I sure would have answered
differently."
Efron seems amazed at where
the residency has taken him.
"Although I have a lot of inter
ests, I can't imagine by this time
in my life being as proficient in
any one of them, where I could
feel a sense of triumph and sense
of accomplishment as I feel at this
point," he says.
But then with a quick smile he
says, "Next year, however, I may
be back down again."

charge.
Neurosurgeons realize that theirs is not a
happy field: tumors, infections and trauma,
even when treated with the highest standard
of care, often rob patients of their ability to
speak, walk or think as clearly as before. But
occasionally, unmitigated triumphs do occur.
Perhaps the most dramatic case this year

for Dr. Alan Efron, chief resident in neuro
surgery at Stanford Medical Center, involved
a secretary who, while at work, suddenly
couldn't see to one side and complained of
terrible headaches.
In the ambulance she suddenly collapsed
into a coma, and her respirations had deteri
orated to the extent that a breathing tube had
to be inserted. A further complication was
that she was pregnant, nearly full-term, and

the fetus was in distress.
After a page from the junior resident and a
scramble to the Emergency Room, Efron
could see that the patient was dying — her
pupil was dilated, and didn't contract in re
sponse to light — and an immediate CT scan
confirmed extensive bleeding into the right
side of her brain.
While an obstetric team delivered
the child by Cesarean section, Dr.
Efron, after about three hours of
careful — and rapid — surgery,
located the cause of the problem.
"During the craniotomy they
delivered the baby," he says."And
you hear this baby crying, and it's
healthy and looks good. Mean
while I'm taking this clot out, and
I found the vascular malforma
tion, which I figured I would find
— so I excised that and I took the
pressure off the brain and closed
everything back up."
Generally, such gross injury to
the brain demands conservative
and hopeful watching after surgery
— with no guarantees on the final
outcome. The patient was moved
into the intensive care unit with
the breathing tube still in place.

'Here I am, I'm going
to be 33 years old,
and I'm still a boy.
I'm still getting hollered
at by grownups.'

"We figured she would be pret
ty sick, because her brain had
been subject to a huge amount of
pressure," he says."And by the
next morning, we had removed
her breathing tube and she was
yelling at me about her haircut. I
thought that was probably the
biggest triumph I'd had, because
it was one of those instances
where every step of the system
worked, from the paramedics
going to get her, to the emergency
room, to the CT scanner, to the
neurosurgeons to the 08-GYN."
'Real indentured servitude'
The neurosurgery residency
spans six to eight years of post
graduate training after medical
school — one of the longest and
most grueling residencies in
medicine, reflecting the complexi

ty and delicacy of brain and
spinal-cord surgery. Each year,
only about 100 new residents
begin such training in the United
States, and Stanford accepts only
one new resident per year.
As chief resident, Efron keeps
tabs, via the interns and junior
residents, on all patients coming
through the neurosurgery ser
vice. The bulk of his time is spent
in the operating room, however —
selecting the most interesting
surgical cases to expand his surgi
cal repertoire. "They'll have two
or three rooms going, and I'll look
at the schedule and say, 'Well,
this is the most interesting room
today.' "
As chief resident, Efron makes
rounds on all the patients at 6
a.m., visiting the patients individ
ually and coming up with a plan
for the day with the team of resi
dents and nurses.
He hits the operating room at
7:30 a.m., and might not emerge
until evening. When he does, he
makes rounds on the patients
again, and deals with whatever
complications arise, returning to
the hospital if necessary.
Efron's specific interests in
neurosurgery include tumors of
the skull base — which require
difficult approaches to the brain
— and the embryonic field of neu
roendoscopy, the use of flexible
fiber-optic scopes designed to per
form a kind of surgery by "remote
control" without requiring exten
sive opening of the skull.
Efron has been at Stanford
since September of 1983, though
"there are guys who've been here
even longer than that," he says.
As a surgeon, his first year out of
medical school was spent in a gen
eral surgical internship during
which all surgeons, regardless of
specialty, must spend several
weeks in each of the various sur
gical services.
"Real indentured servitude,"
he says with a laugh at the men
tion of internship. "When you're a
medical student you think you're
low on the pecking order, and then
you get an M.D. and become an

intern and then you realize that
you've sunk to your lowest."
"Basically, you're everybody's
gofer," Efron says. "You think,
'This is what I spent $100,000 to
do?' Everything runs downhill to
you. Everybody pages you all the
time — they want their X-rays
delivered to a certain place, they
want their labs rounded up and
analyzed.
"You're responsible for taking
histories and doing all the physi
cals on admissions. You bear first
responsibility if something goes
wrong the patient — taking care
of them in the middle of the night
— but you just try to be a good
soldier and follow orders."
Efron says it seems less incred
ible that the neurosurgical resi
dency takes so long than that it
can be learned at all within that
short span of time.

'Although I have a lot
of interests, I can't
imagine by this time
in my life being as
proficient in any one
of them, where I
could feel a sense of
triumph and sense of
accomplishment as I
feel at this point.'

"Just six years ago, I'd be mak
ing rounds with these guys and
the attending would be saying,
'OK, this guy needs a lumbar
puncture, this guy needs X-rays
brought to my office, this guy
needs that.' And now they're
putting up a CT scan on the board
and saying, 'Alan, how would you
approach this tumor, what do you
think we should do?' In the space
of six years — it's phenomenal."
But in a field renown for

intense personalities and a gung
ho, cabalistic attitude, there were
times of self-doubt. For Efron the
doubts began in medical school.
Then internship rolled around —
"I thought, 'This is pretty brutal,
and it's for the birds,' " he says.
The long night of internship
was replaced by residency, with
more time spent in the operating
room and greater responsibilities
and decision-making power.
But even then, he says, "You
have your moments where you
say, 'Is it worth it?' There's so
many years and early on in the
residency I'd say, 'There's so
much to learn in neurosurgery.
It's hard for me to imagine get
ting to that end point where I
know as much as these guys who
are teaching me.' "
The stresses are undeniable.
Physically, of course, "you're just
so tired," he says. And the
inevitable comparison with col
lege friends seem to offer only
bleak contrasts.
"Here I am, I'm going to be 33
years old, and I'm still a boy,"
Efron laughs. "I'm still getting
hollered at by grownups."
Sense of humor 'essential*
"I think you have to be one
those masochistic people that
seems to delight in pushing them
selves to the furthest limits,"
Efron says, discussing the type
who chooses neurosurgery as a
specialty. "Because you really do
get pushed in all ways — physical
ly, intellectually and emotionally."
And it's "very, very taxing on
relationships" he says, simply
because the marriage between
doctor and hospital rivals any
commitment to one's spouse,
even if he or she is a fellow physi
cian. Efron says it's no secret that
divorce rates are high.
To survive the pressure, a
sense of humor "is essential," he
says. "In many ways, it's a very
depressing field because you're
dealing with kids and young peo
ple your own age that come to
you, and the first time you see
them you make a diagnosis of a

terrible disease process. You
know that the only thing you're
going to be able to do is try to pro
long their life with the best quali
ty possible."
But he believes having other
interests — even if they exist only
in theory, not in practice — helps
maintain balance in such an
intense calling.
"We like to think that you have
to be intellectually diverse," he
says."I think you have to be,
because if you get bogged down in
this it becomes awfully confining
at times.
"When you're sitting there and
operating on somebody's brain
stem for hour after hour, and
thinking that their outcome, their
life and the life for their family is
going to be dependent on what
you do in the next few millime
ters, in the next few hours —
when your skill is being brought

to boar — I think that's one of the
greatest challenges any human
being can face."
So to the cliched question of
whether he would do it all again,
Efron says he would. "But I think
you could take any neurosurgeon
at different points in their
career," he adds, "and they'd
answer that question differently,
and I know there have been times
when I sure would have answered
differently."
Efron seems amazed at where
the residency has taken him.
"Although I have a lot of inter
ests, I can't imagine by this time
in my life being as proficient in
any one of them, where I could
feel a sense of triumph and sense
of accomplishment as I feel at this
point," he says.
But then with a quick smile he
says, "Next year, however, I may
be back down again."

Neurosurgeons realize that theirs is not a
happy field: tumors, infections and trauma,
even when treated with the highest standard
of care, often rob patients of their ability to
speak, walk or think as clearly as before. But
occasionally, unmitigated triumphs do occur.
Perhaps the most dramatic case this year

for Dr. Alan Efron, chief resident in neuro
surgery at Stanford Medical Center, involved
a secretary who, while at work, suddenly
couldn't see to one side and complained of
terrible headaches.
In the ambulance she suddenly collapsed
into a coma, and her respirations had deteri
orated to the extent that a breathing tube had
to be inserted. A further complication was
that she was pregnant, nearly full-term, and

the fetus was in distress.
After a page from the junior resident and a
scramble to the Emergency Room, Efron
could see that the patient was dying — her
pupil was dilated, and didn't contract in re
sponse to light — and an immediate CT scan
confirmed extensive bleeding into the right
side of her brain.
While an obstetric team delivered
the child by Cesarean section, Dr.
Efron, after about three hours of
careful — and rapid — surgery,
located the cause of the problem.
"During the craniotomy they
delivered the baby," he says."And
you hear this baby crying, and it's
healthy and looks good. Mean
while I'm taking this clot out, and
I found the vascular malforma
tion, which I figured I would find
— so I excised that and I took the
pressure off the brain and closed
everything back up."
Generally, such gross injury to
the brain demands conservative
and hopeful watching after surgery
— with no guarantees on the final
outcome. The patient was moved
into the intensive care unit with
the breathing tube still in place.

'Here I am, I'm going
to be 33 years old,
and I'm still a boy.
I'm still getting hollered
at by grownups.'

"We figured she would be pret
ty sick, because her brain had
been subject to a huge amount of
pressure," he says."And by the
next morning, we had removed
her breathing tube and she was
yelling at me about her haircut. I
thought that was probably the
biggest triumph I'd had, because
it was one of those instances
where every step of the system
worked, from the paramedics
going to get her, to the emergency
room, to the CT scanner, to the
neurosurgeons to the 08-GYN."
'Real indentured servitude'
The neurosurgery residency
spans six to eight years of post
graduate training after medical
school — one of the longest and
most grueling residencies in
medicine, reflecting the complexi

ty and delicacy of brain and
spinal-cord surgery. Each year,
only about 100 new residents
begin such training in the United
States, and Stanford accepts only
one new resident per year.
As chief resident, Efron keeps
tabs, via the interns and junior
residents, on all patients coming
through the neurosurgery ser
vice. The bulk of his time is spent
in the operating room, however —
selecting the most interesting
surgical cases to expand his surgi
cal repertoire. "They'll have two
or three rooms going, and I'll look
at the schedule and say, 'Well,
this is the most interesting room
today.' "
As chief resident, Efron makes
rounds on all the patients at 6
a.m., visiting the patients individ
ually and coming up with a plan
for the day with the team of resi
dents and nurses.
He hits the operating room at
7:30 a.m., and might not emerge
until evening. When he does, he
makes rounds on the patients
again, and deals with whatever
complications arise, returning to
the hospital if necessary.
Efron's specific interests in
neurosurgery include tumors of
the skull base — which require
difficult approaches to the brain
— and the embryonic field of neu
roendoscopy, the use of flexible
fiber-optic scopes designed to per
form a kind of surgery by "remote
control" without requiring exten
sive opening of the skull.
Efron has been at Stanford
since September of 1983, though
"there are guys who've been here
even longer than that," he says.
As a surgeon, his first year out of
medical school was spent in a gen
eral surgical internship during
which all surgeons, regardless of
specialty, must spend several
weeks in each of the various sur
gical services.
"Real indentured servitude,"
he says with a laugh at the men
tion of internship. "When you're a
medical student you think you're
low on the pecking order, and then
you get an M.D. and become an

intern and then you realize that
you've sunk to your lowest."
"Basically, you're everybody's
gofer," Efron says. "You think,
'This is what I spent $100,000 to
do?' Everything runs downhill to
you. Everybody pages you all the
time — they want their X-rays
delivered to a certain place, they
want their labs rounded up and
analyzed.
"You're responsible for taking
histories and doing all the physi
cals on admissions. You bear first
responsibility if something goes
wrong the patient — taking care
of them in the middle of the night
— but you just try to be a good
soldier and follow orders."
Efron says it seems less incred
ible that the neurosurgical resi
dency takes so long than that it
can be learned at all within that
short span of time.

'Although I have a lot
of interests, I can't
imagine by this time
in my life being as
proficient in any one
of them, where I
could feel a sense of
triumph and sense of
accomplishment as I
feel at this point.'

"Just six years ago, I'd be mak
ing rounds with these guys and
the attending would be saying,
'OK, this guy needs a lumbar
puncture, this guy needs X-rays
brought to my office, this guy
needs that.' And now they're
putting up a CT scan on the board
and saying, 'Alan, how would you
approach this tumor, what do you
think we should do?' In the space
of six years — it's phenomenal."
But in a field renown for

intense personalities and a gung
ho, cabalistic attitude, there were
times of self-doubt. For Efron the
doubts began in medical school.
Then internship rolled around —
"I thought, 'This is pretty brutal,
and it's for the birds,' " he says.
The long night of internship
was replaced by residency, with
more time spent in the operating
room and greater responsibilities
and decision-making power.
But even then, he says, "You
have your moments where you
say, 'Is it worth it?' There's so
many years and early on in the
residency I'd say, 'There's so
much to learn in neurosurgery.
It's hard for me to imagine get
ting to that end point where I
know as much as these guys who
are teaching me.' "
The stresses are undeniable.
Physically, of course, "you're just
so tired," he says. And the
inevitable comparison with col
lege friends seem to offer only
bleak contrasts.
"Here I am, I'm going to be 33
years old, and I'm still a boy,"
Efron laughs. "I'm still getting
hollered at by grownups."
Sense of humor 'essential*
"I think you have to be one
those masochistic people that
seems to delight in pushing them
selves to the furthest limits,"
Efron says, discussing the type
who chooses neurosurgery as a
specialty. "Because you really do
get pushed in all ways — physical
ly, intellectually and emotionally."
And it's "very, very taxing on
relationships" he says, simply
because the marriage between
doctor and hospital rivals any
commitment to one's spouse,
even if he or she is a fellow physi
cian. Efron says it's no secret that
divorce rates are high.
To survive the pressure, a
sense of humor "is essential," he
says. "In many ways, it's a very
depressing field because you're
dealing with kids and young peo
ple your own age that come to
you, and the first time you see
them you make a diagnosis of a

terrible disease process. You
know that the only thing you're
going to be able to do is try to pro
long their life with the best quali
ty possible."
But he believes having other
interests — even if they exist only
in theory, not in practice — helps
maintain balance in such an
intense calling.
"We like to think that you have
to be intellectually diverse," he
says."I think you have to be,
because if you get bogged down in
this it becomes awfully confining
at times.
"When you're sitting there and
operating on somebody's brain
stem for hour after hour, and
thinking that their outcome, their
life and the life for their family is
going to be dependent on what
you do in the next few millime
ters, in the next few hours —
when your skill is being brought

to boar — I think that's one of the
greatest challenges any human
being can face."
So to the cliched question of
whether he would do it all again,
Efron says he would. "But I think
you could take any neurosurgeon
at different points in their
career," he adds, "and they'd
answer that question differently,
and I know there have been times
when I sure would have answered
differently."
Efron seems amazed at where
the residency has taken him.
"Although I have a lot of inter
ests, I can't imagine by this time
in my life being as proficient in
any one of them, where I could
feel a sense of triumph and sense
of accomplishment as I feel at this
point," he says.
But then with a quick smile he
says, "Next year, however, I may
be back down again."
