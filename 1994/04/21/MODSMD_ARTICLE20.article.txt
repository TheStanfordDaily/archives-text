WITH THE ARRIVAL of the Dalai Lama on
campus, the presence of the living incarna
tion of the Tibetan God of Compassion, I
was overcome with thoughts that had escaped my
mind for some time.
What were those thoughts, you ask? Was it a
rediscovered love for my fellow man, or a new
insight into achieving world peace? Not quite.
It was Bill Murray.
Yes, the man who was stiffed by "the Lama" in
the movie "Caddyshack."
Much like the task undertaken by Murray's charac-

ter, Carl the assis
tant greenskeeper,
in fetching the
Lama's ball from a
10,000-foot crevice,
this week's column
topic eluded me
until the combina
tion of the Dalai
Lama and the
"Cinderella story at
Augusta" provided

the necessary enlightenment.
Sports and movies.
Dating back to such classic flicks as "Knute
Rockne, All-American" and "Pride of the Yankees,"
sports has been a popular focus of the silver screen.
From the innocence of "The Bad News Bears" to
the quasi-realism of "The Program" or "Blue
Chips," sports movies capture the interest of
movie-goers everywhere.
So, for your reading pleasure, I have constructed
a list of my most memorable characters, lines and
scenes from the history of sports cinema.
Leading off my lineup is the conversation
between Shoeless Joe Jackson (Ray Liotta) and Ray
Kinsella (Kevin Costner) in "Field of Dreams."
"Is this heaven?" asks Jackson, in awe of Kinsel
la's cornfield diamond, to which Kinsella responds,
"No, it's lowa."
Moving from the sublime to the downtrodden,
Robert DeNiro's portrayal of aging boxer Jake
LaMotta in "Raging Bull" goes against the grain,
depicting a sports story in which the ending doesn't
show a magnificent comeback against all odds.
Instead, it is symbolized by LaMotta's plea "I coul
da been a contenda."
Finishing off the first category, sports lovers
gained incredible wisdom from Webb (Chevy
Chase) in "Caddyshack" as we were all instructed
