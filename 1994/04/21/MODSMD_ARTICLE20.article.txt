## True classics The 						best of Hollywood's sports flicks 
### 
WITH THE ARRIVAL of the Dalai Lama on
campus, the presence of the living incarna
tion of the Tibetan God of Compassion, I
was overcome with thoughts that had escaped my
mind for some time.
What were those thoughts, you ask? Was it a
rediscovered love for my fellow man, or a new
insight into achieving world peace? Not quite.
It was Bill Murray.
Yes, the man who was stiffed by "the Lama" in
the movie "Caddyshack."
Much like the task undertaken by Murray's charac-

ter, Carl the assis
tant greenskeeper,
in fetching the
Lama's ball from a
10,000-foot crevice,
this week's column
topic eluded me
until the combina
tion of the Dalai
Lama and the
"Cinderella story at
Augusta" provided

the necessary enlightenment.
Sports and movies.
Dating back to such classic flicks as "Knute
Rockne, All-American" and "Pride of the Yankees,"
sports has been a popular focus of the silver screen.
From the innocence of "The Bad News Bears" to
the quasi-realism of "The Program" or "Blue
Chips," sports movies capture the interest of
movie-goers everywhere.
So, for your reading pleasure, I have constructed
a list of my most memorable characters, lines and
scenes from the history of sports cinema.
Leading off my lineup is the conversation
between Shoeless Joe Jackson (Ray Liotta) and Ray
Kinsella (Kevin Costner) in "Field of Dreams."
"Is this heaven?" asks Jackson, in awe of Kinsel
la's cornfield diamond, to which Kinsella responds,
"No, it's lowa."
Moving from the sublime to the downtrodden,
Robert DeNiro's portrayal of aging boxer Jake
LaMotta in "Raging Bull" goes against the grain,
depicting a sports story in which the ending doesn't
show a magnificent comeback against all odds.
Instead, it is symbolized by LaMotta's plea "I coul
da been a contenda."
Finishing off the first category, sports lovers
gained incredible wisdom from Webb (Chevy
Chase) in "Caddyshack" as we were all instructed

to "be the ball." More words of
insight from Ty — "A flute with
no holes is not a flute; a donut
without a hole is a danish."
Chase acts as a good transi
tion from the best lines to the
best characters, as he fits in
both categories. Another oddball
comes from the "Major League"
pair of flicks — the announcer
Harry Doyle. Yes, you could
make an argument for any of
the whackos in that movie, but
Bob Uecker's portrayal of the
semi-drunk, loyal-to-the-death
radio broadcaster takes the
prize with a true-to-life imper
sonation of Harry Caray.
Another creation founded in

real life is Burgess Meredith's
role as Mickey, the aging man
ager of Rocky Balboa. Although
the "Rocky" movies quickly
devolved after the first, Mickey
got out while he still had some
respect.
The mood lightens up as we
head around the horn to the cat
egory of most memorable
scenes. With this, "Bull
Durham" makes its first appear
ance. The pitching mound dis
cussion between Nuke LaLoosh,
Crash Davis and others shines
bright in a movie full of great
scenes.
During the conversation, the
players argue about how to take
a curse of a player's glove, the
problem of Nuke breathing out
of the wrong eyelid (like the
Galapagos lizard) and what wed
ding gift to get another player.

All this controversy lets the audi
ence see the true worth of a base
ball assistant coach, as Robert
Wuhl solves everything by sug
gesting candlesticks, which make
a great wedding present.
Football checks in with its
lone addition to the list,
although "The Longest Yard"
doesn't necessarily show the
sport in all its glory. Any movie
about prison life risks being
ridiculed to no end, but pitting
prisoners against guards does
have an interesting twist. Burt
Reynolds' bullet pass into the
groin of the malicious onrushing
linebacker is a little slice of
revenge for every underdog.
Basketball, full of drama and
suspense in real life, comes to a
head in "Hoosiers." As the small
high school team, coached by
Gene Hackman, enters the enor

mous arena in which they will
be playing the Indiana state
championship game, awe wash
es over the wide-eyed players.
This scene has a great impact
in two ways. Not only does it
show the way the ultimate level
of competition in any sport can
take over anyone, but it also has
Hackman measuring the height
of the basket and distance from
the end line to the free throw
line. This simple act reassures
each player that beyond the
lights and big city, a basketball
floor is still a basketball floor.
My last two selections come
down to a tie-breaker between
my personal favorites. Both
"The Natural" and "Chariots of
Fire" show the true spirit of ath
letics, as a continuum of gains
and losses.
"Pick me out a winner,

Bobby." With this line, Roy
Hobbs (Robert Redford) dis
cards his broken "Wonderboy"
bat and picks up the "Savoy Spe
cial." After two strikes, Hobbs
slams a pitch into the lights and
rounds the bases under a show
er of sparks, synchronized with
the second-best theme music
from any sports movie.
The best song combines with
one of the best scenes in "Chari
ots of Fire," as the opening
depicts Olympic hopefuls, clad in
white, running along a beach to
the beauty of Vangelis' theme,
capturing the ultimate meaning
of sport for the sport's sake.

Greg wants everyone to remem
ber that this is definitely not a
complete list, and more sugges
tions can be e-mailed to him at
