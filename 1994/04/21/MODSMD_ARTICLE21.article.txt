# To be the best: Ceman sparkles on Farm
## Senior setter draws comparisons to Kiraly

"I prefer academically-oriented,"
Canyon Ceman quickly amended.
That is after saying, "I like the fact that
I'm a nerd. To be considered nerdly is to be
intelligent and act as if you care about
school, and I think those are virtues."
Hardly the words you would expect to
hear from one of the most talented volley
ball players in the nation — a setter who
became the National Player of the Year last
year, a three-time Ail-American, a four
year starter on the Cardinal squad, Stan
ford's all-time assist leader, not to mention
a successful amateur beach volleyball play
er who aspires to play pro beach after grad
uation.
Yet, there is another side to the Canyon
Ceman, who set his Olympic Festival team
to a gold medal in 1989 at age 18 — the
youngest player to ever make a traveling
U.S. National Volleyball Team.
"The thing I'll miss most about Stan
ford is the fact that everyone's so smart,
but along with everyone being smart,
they're all good at something else besides
that," the senior said.
And Ceman fits that general description
perfectly. In addition to earning a 3.6 grade
point average and a four-year co-term
degree at Stanford, the 6-foot-5 native of
Manhattan Beach, Calif., has distinguished
himself as one of the greatest setters ever
to grace Burnham Pavilion.
According to Stanford coach Ruben
Nieves, "I know this program will have a
lot of great setters in the future, but I don't
know if we'll ever have one as good as
Canyon."
That is probably the same way the Bulls
think about Michael Jordan. Sure, there
will be other Hall of Fame point guards,
but...
In fact, Ceman has already been com
pared to the best player in the world, Karch
Kiraly — a two-time Olympic gold medal
ist, a fellow setter and a top-prize winner
on the beach tour.
That is, of course, when people are not
making comparisons between Ceman and
Dusty Dvorak, the man who set the U.S.
National team to a gold medal in 1984.
"I think when Canyon was coming up
through high school he reminded a lot of
people of Dusty, because he's gifted with a
great pair of hands," Nieves said. "As to his
versatility and his ability to play indoor vol
leyball and beach volleyball at a very high
level, I think the comparison might be with
someone like Karch Kiraly. Canyon might
just turn out to be the best player in beach
volleyball."
But as a man who always tempers his

confidence with just enough modesty,
Ceman insists he has to "really really over
achieve to be anything like Karch."
"I've been compared to Karch in a cou
ple of magazines, but I don't take that too
seriously because I realize that Karch can
jump a lot higher than I can. He jumps
about 40 inches and I jump about 30 inch
es and those 10 inches are probably the dif
ference between being the best player in
the world and being a good college player."
Although Ceman would love to be called
the top player of his decade and live up to
the comparisons with Kiraly, he also
understands that he has a lot of improving
to do.
"Right now, Karch is the best player in
the world, and in the future I aspire to be
the best player in the world."
In order to even come close to that
honor, Ceman must beat his bum rap and
prove his critics wrong when it comes to his
blocking and defense. Although his defen
sive skills have improved since his arrival
at Stanford, both Ceman and Nieves agree
that this facet of his game still needs fine
tuning.
"The biggest question mark in whether
he attains that highest level is his blocking
and defense skills," Nieves said. "But with
additional training, and if he makes the
U.S. National team, I think he'll be able to
match any setter in the world."
Those goals are really not too unrealistic
for a man who wants to play indoor volley
ball in the 1996 Olympics and compete in
beach volleyball in the 2000 Olympics,
while pursuing a pro beach career in
between.
Ceman already has more than a foot in
the door on both fronts. As an amateur,
Ceman has won six AAA beach tourna
ments in addition to placing ninth at the
Hermosa Beach Open (highest amateur
finish in 10 years) in 1992. Indoors he
trained and traveled with the National B
Team last season after setting Stanford to
a division title and setting himself to the
highest individual honor in collegiate vol
leyball.
"I think Canyon is a fine athlete," said
UCLA coach A 1 Scates. "He's got great vol
leyball skills, and he'll probably make a lot
of money out on the beach."
A flattering comment from top-ranked
UCLA's coach, considering Ceman has set
No. 2 Stanford past the Bruins on three
occasions since 1990.
His career 3-3 record against UCLA
might not seem impressive, but consider
ing UCLA's perfect 20-0 record this season
along with the fact that Stanford was 1-49
against the Bruins before Canyon arrived,
