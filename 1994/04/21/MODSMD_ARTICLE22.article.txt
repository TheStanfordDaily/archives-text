# Ojai mystique surrounds Pac-10 tourney
## Men and women off to championships 
### Mike Langford Rob Ross Senior staff writers 
The entire town of Ojai, Calif,
will stop this weekend. Schools will
be canceled. Businesses will close.
Whole offices will take sick leave.
All for a tennis tournament.
But it is tennis on a magnificent
scale, at least for this sleepy south
ern California town of about
10,000. Not only will Pacific 10
Conference men's and women's
title matches be played over the
next four days, but many other
tournaments at various skill levels
will also take place, from the junior
level to the professional circuit.
"Ojai determines the Pac-10
individual singles and doubles
champion, but there are also many
other classifications as well," said
Stanford women's coach Frank
Brennan. "There is the open col
lege division, the Big West Confer
ence championship, an open divi
sion with some pros and a couple
junior divisions. So it's a chance for
all your players to get some compe
tition."
For both Brennan and Cardinal
men's coach Dick Gould, "all"
means everyone. Both squads will
take a full load to Ojai, and those
who don't play in the Pac-10 cham
pionships in singles and doubles
will play in the slightly less com
petitive collegiate open division.
The championship division nor
mally allows each team five entries

in singles and two in doubles. But
with the extraordinary number of
eligibility problems in collegiate
tennis this year, it is possible that
both squads' No. 6 and even No. 7
players may enter the draw in the
championship division.
Regardless of their particular
bracket, according to some Stan
ford netters, the Ojai tournament
compares to none other.
"It's my favorite tournament of
all time," said Stanford women's
captain Laxmi Poruri. "It doesn't
matter who wins or loses. The fans
just want to see good tennis."
As the second oldest American
tournament run in consecutive
years at the same spot, the Ojai
Championships seem modeled
after Wimbledon, the oldest of all
tennis tournaments. But instead of
strawberries and cream for break
fast, it's orange juice, freshly
squeezed an hour before.
"The history is phenomenal,"
Gould said. "It makes you stop and
think what it must have been like
in 1900."
As a mid-afternoon break, play
is halted for tea time when the
ladies of this artists' town, clad in
white gloves and Easter hats, serve
cookies and tea on their best china.
The charm of this unique tour
nament extends onto the courts
themselves, where a set of ball boys
and young score keepers assist the
chair umpires during every match.
