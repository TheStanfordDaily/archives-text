# Ojai mystique surrounds Pac-10 tourney
## Men and women off to championships 
### Mike Langford Rob Ross Senior staff writers 
The entire town of Ojai, Calif,
will stop this weekend. Schools will
be canceled. Businesses will close.
Whole offices will take sick leave.
All for a tennis tournament.
But it is tennis on a magnificent
scale, at least for this sleepy south
ern California town of about
10,000. Not only will Pacific 10
Conference men's and women's
title matches be played over the
next four days, but many other
tournaments at various skill levels
will also take place, from the junior
level to the professional circuit.
"Ojai determines the Pac-10
individual singles and doubles
champion, but there are also many
other classifications as well," said
Stanford women's coach Frank
Brennan. "There is the open col
lege division, the Big West Confer
ence championship, an open divi
sion with some pros and a couple
junior divisions. So it's a chance for
all your players to get some compe
tition."
For both Brennan and Cardinal
men's coach Dick Gould, "all"
means everyone. Both squads will
take a full load to Ojai, and those
who don't play in the Pac-10 cham
pionships in singles and doubles
will play in the slightly less com
petitive collegiate open division.
The championship division nor
mally allows each team five entries

in singles and two in doubles. But
with the extraordinary number of
eligibility problems in collegiate
tennis this year, it is possible that
both squads' No. 6 and even No. 7
players may enter the draw in the
championship division.
Regardless of their particular
bracket, according to some Stan
ford netters, the Ojai tournament
compares to none other.
"It's my favorite tournament of
all time," said Stanford women's
captain Laxmi Poruri. "It doesn't
matter who wins or loses. The fans
just want to see good tennis."
As the second oldest American
tournament run in consecutive
years at the same spot, the Ojai
Championships seem modeled
after Wimbledon, the oldest of all
tennis tournaments. But instead of
strawberries and cream for break
fast, it's orange juice, freshly
squeezed an hour before.
"The history is phenomenal,"
Gould said. "It makes you stop and
think what it must have been like
in 1900."
As a mid-afternoon break, play
is halted for tea time when the
ladies of this artists' town, clad in
white gloves and Easter hats, serve
cookies and tea on their best china.
The charm of this unique tour
nament extends onto the courts
themselves, where a set of ball boys
and young score keepers assist the
chair umpires during every match.

"The kids from the Thatcher
School (one of the many preparato
ry schools in Ojai) have been let out
of school for this week for the last
hundred years," Brennan said.
The actual players in the tour
nament make up as much a part of
this tradition-filled weekend as do
ball boys, tea time and orange
juice. With so many different divi
sions of play taking place at the
same time, kids can make their
first Ojai appearance at a young
age and compete right through
their professional careers.
"I've been involved as a player or
coach in this tournament for a long,
long time." Gould said. "This will be
my 32 nd consecutive year in Ojai
(as a coach), and before that I played
in it in high school and college."
The money in the open division
may not be extraordinary, but the
Ojai mystique keeps drawing back
players like Billie Jean King, an
Ojai regular even at the height of
her Hall of Fame career.
For the women's team, the
tournament presents the Stanford
players with a chance to compete
against rarely seen opponents —
those who played at different spots
in the ladder during the regular
season. Thus, the bottom half of
the Cardinal lineup which includes
Beth Berris, Sandra De Silva and
Kim Shasby could be matched
against conference standouts like
UCLA's Jane Chi and California's
Pam Nelson.
"It's a great chance for players
in the middle of the lineup to possi
bly get a win over other teams' No.
1 or No. 2 player," Gould said.
Individually, wins here are
important if some Stanford players
in the middle or bottom of the
men's and women's lineup want to
be in the NCAA Championships
singles draw, which only takes the
top 64 players in the nation.
Despite the pressure of qualifi
cations, Brennan looks for the Ojai
weekend to be a relaxing one for
the women's team as a whole.
After his team clinched the Pac-10
title with the strange Stanford-
UCLA double forfeit last Saturday,
Brennan sees the next four days as
a win-win situation.
"I'd like to see the team leave
Ojai with a lot of confidence at the
end of the weekend, thinking that
we're a different team than that
which lost to Florida and UCLA,"
Brennan said. "But if they don't do
well, they still have two weeks to

prepare for NCAAs."
When the Pac-10 canceled ail
matches due to eligibility questions
last weekend, the Stanford women
(20-2) missed a chance at revenge
against the Bruins alter a loss in
Los Angeles three weeks ago. Sim
ilar inquires have arisen in schools
all over the country because of the
NCAA's revisions of its amateur
eligibility guidelines, made before
this season.
Early this week, the NCAA
ruled that neither the Stanford
men's or women's teams has any
ineligible players, the claim made
by both Brennan and Gould since
the beginning of the controversy.
Other top Pac-10 players may be
conspicuously absent, however.
"It will be interesting to see if
some schools sit out Ojai (in order
to go to NCAAs)," Brennan said.
For the second-ranked Stanford
men's team (20-2), the goal for the
tournament is to play well and
fine-tune the squad's perfor
mances. With NCAAs only a
month away, Gould knows the pre
sent is a crucial time for his team.
"Our primary concern is not to
sustain any injuries," Gould said.
"Health is the most important
thing at this point. We want to be
in good shape for nationals."
The men's team will also take
its entire staff to Ojai. Mike Flana
gan, Jeff Salzenstein, Robert
Devens, Jim Thomas and Chris
Cocotos will all compete for the
Pac-10 individual title.
Vimal Patel, who has been trou
bled by a hip pointer, will likely
only compete in doubles with
Salzenstein. Flanagan and Cocotos
will also play in the main draw for
doubles.
Billy Wright and Ricky Becker
will both compete in the individual
open, while freshman Grant Elliott
will stay home to allow a sprained
thumb to heal. However, if any
Pac-10 team does not bring its
entire complement, the picture
may change.
Considering the mystique and
prestige of the Ojai tournaments,
anything can happen. It is almost
commonplace for a lower-ranked
player to upset a high seed. A role
player from some team could win
an open championship. An NCAA
bid often hangs in the balance.
But for more than 100 years, a
few things have been constant at
Ojai: tradition, excitement and
great tennis.
"I won [the junior competition
in high school] and I love going
back," said sophomore Berris. "It's
a southern California tennis hap
pening."

The entire town of Ojai, Calif,
will stop this weekend. Schools will
be canceled. Businesses will close.
Whole offices will take sick leave.
All for a tennis tournament.
But it is tennis on a magnificent
scale, at least for this sleepy south
ern California town of about
10,000. Not only will Pacific 10
Conference men's and women's
title matches be played over the
next four days, but many other
tournaments at various skill levels
will also take place, from the junior
level to the professional circuit.
"Ojai determines the Pac-10
individual singles and doubles
champion, but there are also many
other classifications as well," said
Stanford women's coach Frank
Brennan. "There is the open col
lege division, the Big West Confer
ence championship, an open divi
sion with some pros and a couple
junior divisions. So it's a chance for
all your players to get some compe
tition."
For both Brennan and Cardinal
men's coach Dick Gould, "all"
means everyone. Both squads will
take a full load to Ojai, and those
who don't play in the Pac-10 cham
pionships in singles and doubles
will play in the slightly less com
petitive collegiate open division.
The championship division nor
mally allows each team five entries

in singles and two in doubles. But
with the extraordinary number of
eligibility problems in collegiate
tennis this year, it is possible that
both squads' No. 6 and even No. 7
players may enter the draw in the
championship division.
Regardless of their particular
bracket, according to some Stan
ford netters, the Ojai tournament
compares to none other.
"It's my favorite tournament of
all time," said Stanford women's
captain Laxmi Poruri. "It doesn't
matter who wins or loses. The fans
just want to see good tennis."
As the second oldest American
tournament run in consecutive
years at the same spot, the Ojai
Championships seem modeled
after Wimbledon, the oldest of all
tennis tournaments. But instead of
strawberries and cream for break
fast, it's orange juice, freshly
squeezed an hour before.
"The history is phenomenal,"
Gould said. "It makes you stop and
think what it must have been like
in 1900."
As a mid-afternoon break, play
is halted for tea time when the
ladies of this artists' town, clad in
white gloves and Easter hats, serve
cookies and tea on their best china.
The charm of this unique tour
nament extends onto the courts
themselves, where a set of ball boys
and young score keepers assist the
chair umpires during every match.

with Hawaii.
"The kids from the Thatcher
School (one of the many preparato
ry schools in Ojai) have been let out
of school for this week for the last
hundred years," Brennan said.
The actual players in the tour
nament make up as much a part of
this tradition-filled weekend as do
ball boys, tea time and orange
juice. With so many different divi
sions of play taking place at the
same time, kids can make their
first Ojai appearance at a young
age and compete right through
their professional careers.
"I've been involved as a player or
coach in this tournament for a long,
long time." Gould said. "This will be
my 32 nd consecutive year in Ojai
(as a coach), and before that I played
in it in high school and college."
The money in the open division
may not be extraordinary, but the
Ojai mystique keeps drawing back
players like Billie Jean King, an
Ojai regular even at the height of
her Hall of Fame career.
For the women's team, the
tournament presents the Stanford
players with a chance to compete
against rarely seen opponents —
those who played at different spots
in the ladder during the regular
season. Thus, the bottom half of
the Cardinal lineup which includes
Beth Berris, Sandra De Silva and
Kim Shasby could be matched
against conference standouts like
UCLA's Jane Chi and California's
Pam Nelson.
"It's a great chance for players
in the middle of the lineup to possi
bly get a win over other teams' No.
1 or No. 2 player," Gould said.
Individually, wins here are
important if some Stanford players
in the middle or bottom of the
men's and women's lineup want to
be in the NCAA Championships
singles draw, which only takes the
top 64 players in the nation.
Despite the pressure of qualifi
cations, Brennan looks for the Ojai
weekend to be a relaxing one for
the women's team as a whole.
After his team clinched the Pac-10
title with the strange Stanford-
UCLA double forfeit last Saturday,
Brennan sees the next four days as
a win-win situation.
"I'd like to see the team leave
Ojai with a lot of confidence at the
end of the weekend, thinking that
we're a different team than that
which lost to Florida and UCLA,"
Brennan said. "But if they don't do
well, they still have two weeks to

prepare for NCAAs."
When the Pac-10 canceled ail
matches due to eligibility questions
last weekend, the Stanford women
(20-2) missed a chance at revenge
against the Bruins alter a loss in
Los Angeles three weeks ago. Sim
ilar inquires have arisen in schools
all over the country because of the
NCAA's revisions of its amateur
eligibility guidelines, made before
this season.
Early this week, the NCAA
ruled that neither the Stanford
men's or women's teams has any
ineligible players, the claim made
by both Brennan and Gould since
the beginning of the controversy.
Other top Pac-10 players may be
conspicuously absent, however.
"It will be interesting to see if
some schools sit out Ojai (in order
to go to NCAAs)," Brennan said.
For the second-ranked Stanford
men's team (20-2), the goal for the
tournament is to play well and
fine-tune the squad's perfor
mances. With NCAAs only a
month away, Gould knows the pre
sent is a crucial time for his team.
"Our primary concern is not to
sustain any injuries," Gould said.
"Health is the most important
thing at this point. We want to be
in good shape for nationals."
The men's team will also take
its entire staff to Ojai. Mike Flana
gan, Jeff Salzenstein, Robert
Devens, Jim Thomas and Chris
Cocotos will all compete for the
Pac-10 individual title.
Vimal Patel, who has been trou
bled by a hip pointer, will likely
only compete in doubles with
Salzenstein. Flanagan and Cocotos
will also play in the main draw for
doubles.
Billy Wright and Ricky Becker
will both compete in the individual
open, while freshman Grant Elliott
will stay home to allow a sprained
thumb to heal. However, if any
Pac-10 team does not bring its
entire complement, the picture
may change.
Considering the mystique and
prestige of the Ojai tournaments,
anything can happen. It is almost
commonplace for a lower-ranked
player to upset a high seed. A role
player from some team could win
an open championship. An NCAA
bid often hangs in the balance.
But for more than 100 years, a
few things have been constant at
Ojai: tradition, excitement and
great tennis.
"I won [the junior competition
in high school] and I love going
back," said sophomore Berris. "It's
a southern California tennis hap
pening."
