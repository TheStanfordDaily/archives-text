# Not this year
## Women's rugby falls in playoffs 
### Cindy Buchner 
Despite playing two hard-fought games at
the Pacific Coast Collegiate Playoffs in Port
land, Ore. last weekend, the Stanford
women's rugby team will stay home from the
national championships this year.
Stanford finished its season with two
strong showings, however, starting with a 5-0
victory over Reed College on Saturday. The
Cardinal was defeated by Oregon State on
Sunday to split its record. Oregon State will
advance to nationals.
The Cardinal's victory over Reed College
was the result of a long battle, as neither team
scored during the two 40-minute halves.
"It was kind of frustrating because we were
playing better and controlling the ball, but lit
tle mistakes kept pushing us back," said junior
Karen O'Connell.
Only in the second 10-minute sudden death
period did the Cardinal's determination result
in a successful try. A Reed player was called
for playing on the ground, which gave Stan
ford the ball. O'Connell took advantage of this
opportunity with a quick penalty by handing
the ball to second row sophomore Jin Sun
Park, who scored the winning try before the
other team could react.
The Cardinal then faced Oregon State Sun
day in what turned out to be a tough contest.
Stanford controlled the ball for most of the
game but failed to reach the goal line. Oregon
State scored when a Beaver wing beat the Car
dinal down the line. The Beavers did not make
the two-point conversion kick,
so the score was left at 5-0.
Just two days before the play
offs, Stanford was forced to do
some last minute re-positioning
of players due to an injury to
junior Cynthia Fong's shoulder.
Freshman Keiko Suda was
trained for the position of hook
er while in Portland.
"Suda stole four hooks in the
first game and three hooks in
the second game at key times,"
O'Connell said. "She played
well in that position."
The Cardinal had not com
peted against Reed or Oregon
State since the playoffs a year
ago and thus entered the tour
nament unfamiliar with their
style of play. Stanford practices
against local club teams which
are generally stronger and more
experienced, so playing the col
lege teams presented a new
challenge.
"It was a different kind of
game playing against these
teams," said graduate student
Elizabeth Bassett. "Our back
line is used to being able to
breakthrough and use their
speed, but they were neutral
ized. It became a game for the
forward pack."
The Cardinal plans to attend a
mid-season collegiate tourna
ment in Oregon next year in
hopes of gaining practice scoring
against teams with different
styles.
O'Connell predicts "a strong
team again," despite the loss of
co-captain Bassett who "is
going to be missed for her play
ing and leadership." In addition
to Bassett's departure, the
team will also say good-bye to
its coach Desmond Latham,
who is a visiting Knight Fellow.
Looking forward to next
year, the team will begin its
search for victory with eyes
open for a new coach and new
players.
