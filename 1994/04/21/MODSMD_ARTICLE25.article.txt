# Panel to discuss genital mutilation
## 
### Vanessa Arrington Staff writer 
In an effort to increase awareness of female
genital mutilation in Africa, a panel discus
sion focused primarily on the health effects of
the practice will take place tonight at 7 p.m. in
Bechtel International Center.
A showing of Alice Walker's "Warrior
Marks" — which takes a look at female geni
tal mutilation in West Africa — will precede
the discussion, both of which tie in with Africa
Week's theme of "Health in Africa: Conflict
and Synergy."
"This is one of the most contemporary films
made on this topic," said Adjo Amekudzi, the
panel discussion's program director. "It pro
vides a different perspective, from someone
outside of the African culture. We hope this
movie will stimulate conversation."
After the showing of the movie, three
women will lead a discussion on the health
risks, as well as the cultural significance, of
female "circumcision."
"I think discussion on any important issue
is one of the first ways to bring about change,"
Amekudzi said. "Discussion focuses us to
reexamine our values as well as others' val
ues."
Two of the panel members are doctors: Dr.
Eiman Mahmoud and Dr. Charlotte Gray.
Mahmoud is a Sudanese woman currently

working on a master's in public health at UC-
Berkeley. She is also the founder of the
National Resource Protection Group, the first
women's group in Sudan to deal with environ
mental and health issues.
According to Mahmoud, female genital
mutilation dates back to the introduction of
Arabic culture into East Africa, though the
practice is not linked to religion. This practice
is decreasing in capital cities, yet it is still very
common in other areas of North, East and
West Africa.
"I totally disagree with this practice, but it
is a cultural thing that should be respected,"
Mahmoud said. "My aim is not to propose
eradication of the whole process, but rather to
change to the sunna method from the phara
noic."
The sunna method is removal of just the tip
of the clitoris, while the pharanoic is the
removal of the whole clitoris and frequently,
the closing of the vagina.
While the only hazards of the sunna
method are psychological, the pharanoic has
many negative side effects on a woman's
health, such as painful menstruation and sex
ual intercourse, vaginal infections and
obstructed labor.
Despite these effects, there are many peo
ple, including women, who approve of this
practice. Some of these reasons, according to
Mahmoud, are that the clitoris is comparable

to the male organ and thus should be
removed, the process is seen as a sort of
cleansing, or sexual enjoyment for men is
increased through intercourse with a "circum
cised" woman.
Mahmoud also said this practice was used
historically when men went to war and want
ed to suppress women's sexual desires.
"This practice is something that has been
in the culture for a long time," Mahmoud said.
"I think it is mutilation, but it is more about
how women in Africa think of themselves, and
their dependency on men.
"I also want people to perceive the issue as
more than just a barbaric practice forced by
men in Africa. Women do it to women gener
ally, and often, after women have babies, they
even ask to be re-circumcised. People say
women are unable to enjoy sex once they are
circumcised, but sex is not an important part
of marital life in our culture."
The third panel member is a Stanford
sophomore, Almaz Andu. She describes her
self as an extremist because she wants female
genital mutilation totally eliminated. She
acknowledges that this will not happen right
away, but said the effort needs to be made.
"Female genital mutilation is very degrad
ing, and strips women of their sexuality,"
Andu said. "A westerner can't force this
change, though. It will have to come from
within."
