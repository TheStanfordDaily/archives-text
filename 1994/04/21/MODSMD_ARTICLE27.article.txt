# Construction leaves ducks out in cold
## 
### Matt Brockwell 
After spending the winter traveling in
flocks and feeding across all of North America
— from the Aleutian Islands to the Gulf of
Mexico — countless numbers of Common Mal
lard ducks migrate every year from their win
ter grazing fields to spring breeding ranges.
That is, assuming everything goes accord
ing to plan. For the two ducks who have
returned eveiy spring to nest in the pond
beside the Terman Engineering Building, a
rude surprise awaited them this week.
As the construction of the new Charles B.
Thornton center for Engineering Manage

ment continues, the old Terman Pond lies
empty.
The ducks' habitat has been temporarily
pre-empted by the Barnes Construction com
pany, employed by Stanford's School of Engi
neering to construct an annex next to Ter
man.
The open area between Terman and Santa
Teresa St. is currently a construction site. In
the fall of 1994, the projected 11,200 -square
foot annex will be finished. The two-story
building will contain two case-style class
rooms and two non-hazardous labs.
Although the architects plan to incorporate
a freshwater pond into the plaza between Ter

man and the projected annex, it remains to be
seen whether this freshwater pond will be
duck-friendly. Ducks are particular about
where they choose to nest.
Meanwhile, the chances are dwindling that
Terman's ducks will decide to stay. As long as
the pond lies dry, the pair has no chance of
teaching their offspring the essential swim
ming skills that all ducks must acquire.

Whether the ducks will return next year is
yet to be seen. The possibility remains that
the only quacking sounds that will be heard
outside Terman next spring will be the Macin
tosh system error noises wafting out from
indoor computers.
