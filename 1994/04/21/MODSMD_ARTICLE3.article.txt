# Questioning His Holiness
## Dalai Lama fields complex queries from panel of profs 
### Josh Gohlke Staff writer 
A panel of six Stanford profes
sors asked the Dalai Lama a series
of questions so difficult that even
the audience of about 40 faculty
members in Littlefield Center had
to sigh a few times during a discus
sion yesterday morning.
But Tibet's spiritual leader lis
tened calmly to the complex
queries — dealing with topics from
new computer technology to the
origins of the universe — turning
to his interpreters only for words
also unintelligible to most native
English speakers: "cyberspace,"
"polygynandry," "matrilineal de
scent system."
The most tense and perhaps
most concrete moment in the two
and-a-half hours of the Dalai
Lama's last talk during his Stan
ford visit came when Anthropolo
gy Prof. Sylvia Yanagisako, after
noting that the successive reincar
nations of the supreme Tibetan
Buddhist have not been con
strained even by national borders,
posed the following:
"Why is it that the Dalai Lama
has never been reincarnated in a
woman?"
His Holiness, speaking through
his interpreters, made his wisdom
manifest by working himself out of
the web with unprecedented skill.
He explained that since men are
socially dominant in his time and

place, the Dalai
Lamas could
only be the best
possible rulers

if reincarnated as males.
"The purpose of the person
reincarnated is to be of service," he
said. "The question becomes,
'How can the person be most effec
tive in that service?' If women
were more highly esteemed than
men, the Dalai Lama could be a
woman."
The talk ventured into the
highly metaphysical when Anthro
pology Prof. William H. Durham
began by asking the Dalai Lama to
reconcile evolution with Bud
dhism, and ended by requesting
that he describe the beginning of
the universe.
His Holiness took it in stride,
painting a portrait of several men
tal consciousnesses that always
have existed and always will exist,
in several universes, that have
taken temporary form as the many
organisms of planet Earth.
As the two interpreters flank
ing him argued out the semantics
in English and Tibetan, attempt
ing to get the message across to the
audience and panel, the Dalai
Lama leaned his head back in frus
tration and summed it all up very
neatly.
"No beginning, no end," he
said.
