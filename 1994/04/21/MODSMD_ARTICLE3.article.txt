# Questioning His Holiness
## Dalai Lama fields complex queries from panel of profs 
### Josh Gohlke Staff writer 
A panel of six Stanford profes
sors asked the Dalai Lama a series
of questions so difficult that even
the audience of about 40 faculty
members in Littlefield Center had
to sigh a few times during a discus
sion yesterday morning.
But Tibet's spiritual leader lis
tened calmly to the complex
queries — dealing with topics from
new computer technology to the
origins of the universe — turning
to his interpreters only for words
also unintelligible to most native
English speakers: "cyberspace,"
"polygynandry," "matrilineal de
scent system."
The most tense and perhaps
most concrete moment in the two
and-a-half hours of the Dalai
Lama's last talk during his Stan
ford visit came when Anthropolo
gy Prof. Sylvia Yanagisako, after
noting that the successive reincar
nations of the supreme Tibetan
Buddhist have not been con
strained even by national borders,
posed the following:
"Why is it that the Dalai Lama
has never been reincarnated in a
woman?"
His Holiness, speaking through
his interpreters, made his wisdom
manifest by working himself out of
the web with unprecedented skill.
He explained that since men are
socially dominant in his time and

place, the Dalai
Lamas could
only be the best
possible rulers

if reincarnated as males.
"The purpose of the person
reincarnated is to be of service," he
said. "The question becomes,
'How can the person be most effec
tive in that service?' If women
were more highly esteemed than
men, the Dalai Lama could be a
woman."
The talk ventured into the
highly metaphysical when Anthro
pology Prof. William H. Durham
began by asking the Dalai Lama to
reconcile evolution with Bud
dhism, and ended by requesting
that he describe the beginning of
the universe.
His Holiness took it in stride,
painting a portrait of several men
tal consciousnesses that always
have existed and always will exist,
in several universes, that have
taken temporary form as the many
organisms of planet Earth.
As the two interpreters flank
ing him argued out the semantics
in English and Tibetan, attempt
ing to get the message across to the
audience and panel, the Dalai
Lama leaned his head back in frus
tration and summed it all up very
neatly.
"No beginning, no end," he
said.

cations, of course. For example,
there have been several Buddhist
equivalents of what scientists call
the Big Bang, the Dalai Lama
said, since a certain sentience has
always existed.
"If they prove 100 percent that
there was only one Big Bang, then
Buddhists will have to think very
hard," he said with a smile and
pointing to his head, to the
amusement of the audience.
The leader of six million Bud
dhists showed tolerance as well as
humor. When Religious Studies
Prof. Lee Yearley asked how
much choice people should have
regarding religion, he said that
different religions work better for
different individuals and the
important thing is that it have a
positive effect on the person.
"The main objective for a spiri
tual person is to become a better
person," he said. "All major world
religions have the same objec
tive."
The talk even addressed the

issues of computer network com
munication when Computer Sci
ence Prof. Terry Winograd asked
for advice on how to allow people
to assume electronic identities
without abusing their new disem
bodied, anonymous status.
The Dalai Lama, admitting he
has little knowledge of the field,
based his answer on certain Bud
dhist practices which allow the
mental creation of fantasy worlds
and new identities. He said that
although such situations are
advantageous for the testing of
new ideas and achieving a height
ened sense of awareness, prob
lems arise if the new identity is
not based in the individual's own.
The Dalai Lama ended the talk
and his two-day visit to Stanford
— which included a discussion
with science faculty and a speech
in Memorial Church Tuesday —
by answering a question from
Yearley about the role of universi
ties in the world.
"The people who go to univer
sities end up being the people who
really shape the universe," His
Holiness said. "They have a
tremendous responsibility to
build and change the world."
