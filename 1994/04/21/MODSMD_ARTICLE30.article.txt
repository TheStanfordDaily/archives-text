# Lightin' up on Cypress Hill Joey Rosenblum

Sex, drugs and rock 'n roll. Not neces
sarily in that order. This is the immor
tal legacy left by the '60s and '70s ver
sions of bad-ass rock 'n roll motherfuckers.
Images of Jimi Hendrix smoking a joint or
jamming on stage with a tab of acid in his
head-band; Keith Richards shooting up
smack and recording the best music of his
life; Janis Joplin chugging a fifth of lack; the
Grateful Dead: the classic musician, rather,
the immortal musician is heavily involved in
drugs and drug culture.
While many creative geniuses become in
volved in self-abuse in one form or another,
there is evidence this could be due to a bio
chemical component. Would Hemingway
have written masterpiece after masterpiece
without alcohol dependency as his muse?
I love you Mary Jane. While for some this
is an artistic muse and biological necessity, I
have a hard time calling the dope dependent,
AK-47 totin' members of Cypress Hill artis
tic geniuses. They make some decent, some
times funky, mostly funny hip hop. But now
the sight of pre-pubescent boys screaming,
"Hits from the bong!" is not an uncommon

sight — it's the difference between Velvet Un
derground's monumental "Heroin" and Cy
press Hill's meaningless "I wanna' get high."
I have a hard time believing that Cypress
Hill is singing moving songs of personal
depth, growth and experience; They're a
bunch of psyched twenty-somethings who
caught onto the fact that America loves to live
vicariously through its musical heroes (from
Madonna and sex/uality to Snoop Doggy
Dog and misogyny), and translated a person
al like of marijuana indulgence into an ex
tremely accessible, extremely packaged,
ready-to-sell format.
And of course, it's not just Cypress Hill on
the band wagon: Dr. Dre and his cohorts,
Sonic Youth (in collaboration with Cypress
Hill) and a host of "alternative" and "rap"
and "heavy metal" artists are glorifying drugs
and drug use in song after song.
Personal drug use, drug references in your

music, fine. But is holding up a bag of kind
buds in your Rolling Stone photo shoot a lib
ertarian idealist statement or a media gag a la
Madonna? It's a tragedy that artists are get
ting rich by exploiting one of this country's
weakest aspects: its treatment of drugs and
drug use.
Did "Just Say No" help you surmount the
temptation of experimentation? This coun
try is caught in a backwards reality where al
cohol is legal and marijuana possession is a
criminal offense (not applicable in Califor
nia).
Turn on, tune in. Drug use among
teenagers is on the rise. More eighth graders
are using LSD than ever before, and more
high school seniors are daily dope smokers.
Crack cocaine is selling for less money, more
heroin is being imported, and marijuana has
a 10 times higher concentration of its psy
choactive chemical THC than common dope

did in the '60s.
Junkies can't get help because of repressive
costs, and Clinton's campaign promise of
"help on demand" is an obvious farce. And
the failed "War On Drugs" spent billions of
dollars to put a few hundred thousand small
time dope dealers behind bars, leaving 90
percent of the real drug lords free and rich.
So Cypress Hill, Dr. Dre et al have brought
dope into the spotlight. Sure it's fun for us
dope smokers to see pot leaves on CDs, T-
Shirts, hats, backpacks and even in the Gap. 1
support and endorse personal liberty; I con
demn irresponsible messages that take ad
vantage of the public and propagate a system
where the rich get richer and the poor get
screwed.
Sex, drugs and rock 'n roll, glamorously
portrayed as insepa~ably hand-in-hand, is a
myth eaten up by the average consumer. 1
wish that popular music would place more of
an emphasis on personal, meaningful expe
rience, as in the days when the phrase "sex,
drugs and rock 'n roll" was coined. But as
long as Snoop Doggy Dog is on top of the
charts, there simply isn't a chance. ■
