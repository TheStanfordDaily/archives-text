# An object of affection
## Shawn Colvin steps into Fat City 
### Romesh Ratnesar 
It's past 9 p.m. when Shawn
Colvin arrives for her 8 p.m.
show at Dinkelspiel Audito
rium. Her opening act, an un
heralded, last-minute addition
named Phil Cody, has been re
clining backstage long enough to
discuss a recent tour with War
ren Zevon and throw back half a
bottle of beer. The door at one
end of the stage opens and
Colvin walks in alone and with a
bluster, and though you only
catch a whisper, it sounds as if
she's —
"Bitching?" she asks later, sifting through
guitar picks and applying eyeliner. "Yeah, my
hotel didn't have my reservations."
By now, sitting in a drab little makeup
room next to an untouched tray of cold cuts,
she hardly seems bothered by the inconve
nience. And make no mistake: Shawn Colvin
is not unaccustomed to less-than-royal treat
ment.
It's hard not to get the feeling that the
time-tested but undeniably charming Colvin
is just happy to be here. 1 ler stop at Stanford,
she concedes, is just part of a tour of "fill-in
gigs" to promote the upcoming release of her
third album. "Ill be coming back in the late
summer or fall to play more nights, probably
in a bigger place," she says. "This is just kind
of for fun."
In her mid-30s, Colvin is part of a bur
geoning generation of young, searching fe
male singer-songwriters reared in the folk
rock styles of artists like Joni Mitchell and
Bonnie Raitt. Of that lot — which includes
Mary Chapin Carpenter, k.d. lang, Tori
Amos, Liz Fhair — Colvin is among the most
successful. Her first album, the dark, muscu
lar "Steady On," won a Grammy in 1990. The
follow-up, "Fat City," gained Colvin a fair
measure of mainstream popularity, which
has since been bolstered by Colvin's tireless
touring and spot appearances at high-profile
engagements.
Her show at Dinkelspiel, for instance, sold
out in three days. By the middle of the set
many in the audience are substituting as
backup vocalists on songs Colvin recorded
with a full band. On this evening, as has be-

come her wont, she performs solo.

When she finishes, the crowd
— a well-balanced

group tipped

slightly

toward the female side — gives her two
standing ovations.
Diamond in the rough
But things weren't always so swimming.
"Before I got a record contract," she says,"I
just sold tapes of my gigs to my friends."
And despite a growing fan base, the reali
ties of the industry still weigh upon Colvin.
Last year, she was on the road for 255 days —
she keeps a record of such things, she says,
"for my taxes — it's so much easier."
While she agrees that her career received a
big boost with the critical and popular suc
cess of "Fat City," Colvin's life remains rela
tively unchanged. "Maybe I play to more
people, play bigger rooms," she says, shrug
ging. "1 make a little more money. But I'm
still not selling enough records for them to
pay for themselves.
"I'm gaining notoriety," she continues.
"But it would be nice if the day comes when I
make the jump so that the record company
starts making money, and I can make a little
more," she says.
Ferhaps because she still hasn't achieved
widespread recognition, Colvin eschews
both the garish strappings of a major record
ing star and the tortured pretense of younger
artists. More than anything else, Colvin is
normal. Slender and toned in a simple gray
cotton dress and black chapeau, she exudes a
disarming, down-home earthiness. When
she comes back on to the stage for an encore
this night, Colvin solicits audience ques
tions, ranging from whether her husband
still cuts her short-cropped hair (no), to her
favorite ice cream (Haagen-Dazs white

chocolate).
Orion in the sky
Her music
holds a famil
iarity as
well.
Colvin's
deeply per
sonal songs
most obvi
ously come
out of the
folk tradi
tion, but
her
d e -

veloping pop sensibilities, especially on re
cent songs like "Climb On (A Back That's
Strong)" and "Object of My Affection" are
unmistakable. Fittingly, her favorite band is
the uncannily tuneful Australian trio
Crowded House.
"1 love them," she gushes as she walks out
of the makeup room. The muffled sounds of
the crowd, which is clapping restlessly in an
ticipation, are audible. "1 listen to them all
the time." Colvin opens her Stanford show
with Crowded House's "Four Seasons in A
Day,"and over the course of the 90- minute
performance, covers Jane Sieberry, Talking
Heads and The Police.
That is just a taste of Colvin's forthcoming
record, which will consist entirely of "other
people's songs." Some, she tells the audience
late in the set, "will be live, like this, and the
rest will be totally over-produced and you'll
hate it." She says the album will pay homage
to "everyone from Sting to David Byrne to
Bob Dylan."
Colvin hardly needs to lean on the
strength of other artists' music; her own
songwriting has proven both textured and
accessible. Instead, her motivation is entirely
personal.
"I've been playing other people's songs
longer than I've been writing them — I've
developed quite a collection," she says."And
anyway, I consider myself an interpreter of
songs as much as a writer." Rather than
record the songs piecemeal (Zevon and lack
son Browne's "Tenderness on the Block" ap
pears on "Fat City"), Colvin resolved to
"throw them all in at once."
Even Colvin might be surprised by the re
ceptiveness of the 1,500 listeners who
have gathered to hear her this
night. She wins them over im
mediately with a rendition
of"Fo

laroids," a delicate, affecting recollection of
a broken relationship. Midway through, in a
genuine hurst of spontaneity, Colvin muses
on other tunes that follow "Polaroids'" sim
ple chord progression. She comes up with
"Put a Little Love in Your Heart," "Just My
Imagination," "My Girl," "Ebony and Ivory,"
"Like a Rolling Stone," and most imagina
tively, the Red Hot Chili Peppers' "Give It
Away."
"Anything works!" she says with credible
surprise, and the audience, several of whom
had probably never heard Colvin before, is
hers. She closes with "Richochet in Time," a
sprite song from the first album. "Just pick a
day and I'm in a new destination," she sings.
And so she is, off to Santa Cruz to play more
shows, pay more bills.
Steady on
She has been backstage for all of 20 min
utes, but Shawn Colvin is anxious to start.
"Do you need anything more?" she asks the
interviewer sympathetically.
You ask about her modest but growing
niche of college followers, somewhat strange
considering the angrier, grungier predilec
tions of college radio. "I don't know why I ap
peal to college students," she says."I think
women like me ... probably because I'm
honest in what I try to write about."
She inches toward the curtain separating
her from the waiting crowd, and looks back.
"I'm glad I appeal to college students," she
says."It means I'm more than dinner music."
Colvin pushes back the curtain, and steps
onto the stage. ■

room next to an untouched tray of cold cuts,
she hardly seems bothered by the inconve
nience. And make no mistake: Shawn Colvin
is not unaccustomed to less-than-royal treat
ment.
It's hard not to get the feeling that the
time-tested but undeniably charming Colvin
is just happy to be here. 1 ler stop at Stanford,
she concedes, is just part of a tour of "fill-in
gigs" to promote the upcoming release of her
third album. "Ill be coming back in the late
summer or fall to play more nights, probably
in a bigger place," she says. "This is just kind
of for fun."
In her mid-30s, Colvin is part of a bur
geoning generation of young, searching fe
male singer-songwriters reared in the folk
rock styles of artists like Joni Mitchell and
Bonnie Raitt. Of that lot — which includes
Mary Chapin Carpenter, k.d. lang, Tori
Amos, Liz Fhair — Colvin is among the most
successful. Her first album, the dark, muscu
lar "Steady On," won a Grammy in 1990. The
follow-up, "Fat City," gained Colvin a fair
measure of mainstream popularity, which
has since been bolstered by Colvin's tireless
touring and spot appearances at high-profile
engagements.
Her show at Dinkelspiel, for instance, sold
out in three days. By the middle of the set
many in the audience are substituting as
backup vocalists on songs Colvin recorded
with a full band. On this evening, as has be-

come her wont, she performs solo.

When she finishes, the crowd
— a well-balanced

group tipped

slightly

toward the female side — gives her two
standing ovations.
Diamond in the rough
But things weren't always so swimming.
"Before I got a record contract," she says,"I
just sold tapes of my gigs to my friends."
And despite a growing fan base, the reali
ties of the industry still weigh upon Colvin.
Last year, she was on the road for 255 days —
she keeps a record of such things, she says,
"for my taxes — it's so much easier."
While she agrees that her career received a
big boost with the critical and popular suc
cess of "Fat City," Colvin's life remains rela
tively unchanged. "Maybe I play to more
people, play bigger rooms," she says, shrug
ging. "1 make a little more money. But I'm
still not selling enough records for them to
pay for themselves.
"I'm gaining notoriety," she continues.
"But it would be nice if the day comes when I
make the jump so that the record company
starts making money, and I can make a little
more," she says.
Ferhaps because she still hasn't achieved
widespread recognition, Colvin eschews
both the garish strappings of a major record
ing star and the tortured pretense of younger
artists. More than anything else, Colvin is
normal. Slender and toned in a simple gray
cotton dress and black chapeau, she exudes a
disarming, down-home earthiness. When
she comes back on to the stage for an encore
this night, Colvin solicits audience ques
tions, ranging from whether her husband
still cuts her short-cropped hair (no), to her
favorite ice cream (Haagen-Dazs white

chocolate).
Orion in the sky
Her music
holds a famil
iarity as
well.
Colvin's
deeply per
sonal songs
most obvi
ously come
out of the
folk tradi
tion, but
her
d e -

veloping pop sensibilities, especially on re
cent songs like "Climb On (A Back That's
Strong)" and "Object of My Affection" are
unmistakable. Fittingly, her favorite band is
the uncannily tuneful Australian trio
Crowded House.
"1 love them," she gushes as she walks out
of the makeup room. The muffled sounds of
the crowd, which is clapping restlessly in an
ticipation, are audible. "1 listen to them all
the time." Colvin opens her Stanford show
with Crowded House's "Four Seasons in A
Day,"and over the course of the 90- minute
performance, covers Jane Sieberry, Talking
Heads and The Police.
That is just a taste of Colvin's forthcoming
record, which will consist entirely of "other
people's songs." Some, she tells the audience
late in the set, "will be live, like this, and the
rest will be totally over-produced and you'll
hate it." She says the album will pay homage
to "everyone from Sting to David Byrne to
Bob Dylan."
Colvin hardly needs to lean on the
strength of other artists' music; her own
songwriting has proven both textured and
accessible. Instead, her motivation is entirely
personal.
"I've been playing other people's songs
longer than I've been writing them — I've
developed quite a collection," she says."And
anyway, I consider myself an interpreter of
songs as much as a writer." Rather than
record the songs piecemeal (Zevon and lack
son Browne's "Tenderness on the Block" ap
pears on "Fat City"), Colvin resolved to
"throw them all in at once."
Even Colvin might be surprised by the re
ceptiveness of the 1,500 listeners who
have gathered to hear her this
night. She wins them over im
mediately with a rendition
of"Fo

laroids," a delicate, affecting recollection of
a broken relationship. Midway through, in a
genuine hurst of spontaneity, Colvin muses
on other tunes that follow "Polaroids'" sim
ple chord progression. She comes up with
"Put a Little Love in Your Heart," "Just My
Imagination," "My Girl," "Ebony and Ivory,"
"Like a Rolling Stone," and most imagina
tively, the Red Hot Chili Peppers' "Give It
Away."
"Anything works!" she says with credible
surprise, and the audience, several of whom
had probably never heard Colvin before, is
hers. She closes with "Richochet in Time," a
sprite song from the first album. "Just pick a
day and I'm in a new destination," she sings.
And so she is, off to Santa Cruz to play more
shows, pay more bills.
Steady on
She has been backstage for all of 20 min
utes, but Shawn Colvin is anxious to start.
"Do you need anything more?" she asks the
interviewer sympathetically.
You ask about her modest but growing
niche of college followers, somewhat strange
considering the angrier, grungier predilec
tions of college radio. "I don't know why I ap
peal to college students," she says."I think
women like me ... probably because I'm
honest in what I try to write about."
She inches toward the curtain separating
her from the waiting crowd, and looks back.
"I'm glad I appeal to college students," she
says."It means I'm more than dinner music."
Colvin pushes back the curtain, and steps
onto the stage. ■

It's past 9 p.m. when Shawn
Colvin arrives for her 8 p.m.
show at Dinkelspiel Audito
rium. Her opening act, an un
heralded, last-minute addition
named Phil Cody, has been re
clining backstage long enough to
discuss a recent tour with War
ren Zevon and throw back half a
bottle of beer. The door at one
end of the stage opens and
Colvin walks in alone and with a
bluster, and though you only
catch a whisper, it sounds as if
she's —
"Bitching?" she asks later, sifting through
guitar picks and applying eyeliner. "Yeah, my
hotel didn't have my reservations."
