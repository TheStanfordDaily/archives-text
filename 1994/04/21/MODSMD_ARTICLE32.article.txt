# Michael Halaas the Bard of Punk Piano
## 
### Matt Johnson 
Michael Halaas may be the
Vladimir Horowitz of anti-classi
cal piano. He pounds the key
board with the same juggernaut intensity,
wipes the sweat from his brow, hardly stops
to take a breath. The classical world would
frown heavily on his hunched posture and
his knurled fingering of the keys. But he
couldn't care less.
"One person after a show called my
music punk piano," says Halaas. "Another
friend calls it piano-core."
He laughs at that. Yet sitting in a prac
tice room, listening to his sometimes furi
ous playing, I can easily imagine him be
fore a seething audience in an under
ground club, pounding the keys with
abandon. No wonder one of his main in

fluences is Trent Reznor of Nine Inch
Nails, an icon of the industrial under
world. Halaas' playing seems to require a
much louder, denser instrument than the
acoustic piano — and yet he makes do
with it. Magnificently. On his latest album
"Face to Face," his heavier side is evi
denced strongly on tracks like
"Wingspan," "Rope and Cord" and
"Gush."
"But I wouldn't want my music to be
characterized solely by that heavier side,"
says Halaas, a 1993 Stanford graduate. "I
have my lyrical side as well."
The other half of what he does has the
ambient, ethereal quality of New Age.
Though he cringes at the term, he admits
that the label could be applied to him just as

easily as punk piano could. Other terms —
new acoustic music, for instance — appeal
more to Halaas because they don't have the
negative bohemian implication.
"But what can you do?" asks Halaas.
"New Age conjures up this image of people
out recording forests. Yet the guitarist
Michael Hedges is classified as New Age,
and if you go see him, he's slamming and
beating his guitar. So if Michael Hedges is
New Age, then so am I. If it's the people who
record forests, well ... I'm definitely not
that."
At age 5 Halaas underwent one of the es
sential rites of passage for American chil
dren: his parents began sending him to
piano lessons in Pueblo, Colo., where he
was raised. ("A stifling place ... a city with
a small town mentality," he says.) He reluc
tantly endured them until he was 14, prac
ticing half an hour a day on his mother's in
sistence. Hut during his freshman year in
high school he was drafted as a drummer
into the metal band Living Hell. Iron Maid
en, Metallica and other symbols of reac
tionary angst became his daily fare.
"When you play heavy metal drums for
four years, it's hard to get those rhythms out
of your head. You adopt a drummer's men
tality, beating on everything," says Halaas.
He slaps his chest like a hambone player
would.
When he first came to Stanford, he took
up the piano again, having sated his hard
core yearnings for a while. During that year,
he sat for hours at the piano in the lounge of
Arroyo House and wrote.
"It drove people nuts," he says. " They'd
say, 'Oh god, he's playing again!' "
Now the tables seem to have turned —
he's being paid to play on those same dorm
pianos. Halaas, however, doesn't merely
play the keyboard, he leans over and into it,
his head at times nearly touching the keys,
his hands reaching into the sound-chamber
to mute a note. One foot juts out toward
the audience and stomps along. His body
rises and falls with the music.
"My songs tend to stem from emotions.
The music I enjoy is essentially emotional
— people like Ani DiFranco, Tori Amos, Liz
Story — and so is the music I write. If you

sit in front of a piano for a while, you just
want to hit it,"says Halaas. "So I do."
Halaas has spent hours hitting pianos.
His favorite sits in a small room upstairs in
the music building, surrounded by unused
soundboards and parts of instruments.
Cloistered in the neighboring rooms are
classical musicians, but Halaas brushes
them away with a flourish of his arm.
"They give me funny looks," he says.
"They hear me playing when they pass by."
At this piano, in this cramped room, Ha
laas perfected his style and wrote most of
the music on his three albums. In the
process he invented new ways to play: one
night in a state of boredom, he took off his
t-shirt, shredded it and stuffed the bits be
tween the strings. The result was a percus
sive attack and ring. He's prepared the
strings with cameras, wedges of foam and
his own hands. As a result, he breaks strings
fairly often, which is unusual for a pianist.
"I tell the staff I found it that way and it's
fixed fairly quickly," says Halaas.
In front of audiences, Halaas tends to
sink into his music and forget they're there.
But at many campus shows, he's glanced
out into the audiences and seen them
rapt —as absorbed as he is in the music.
He's had people cry at his concerts, and oth
ers who came up afterward and told him
they were devastated. Since the release of
"Face to Face," more and more people have
approached Halaas on campus. And con
siderable interest in his music has been
shown by a number of people in the music
industry — including pianist George Win
ston.
Michael Halaas Finally recognizes the
limitations of solo piano. Its markets are
slim, its danceability low, its practitioners
well-honed but few and of a piece. Yet he re
fuses to get discouraged, and he continues
to write his tone poems based on events in
his life. He continues to play with jugger
naut intensity, wipes the sweat from his
brow and hardly stops to breathe. ■

Michael Halaas plays tonight at 7p.m. in the
Ricker Dining ami Performance Center. His
three albums are available at the Stanford
Bookstore.
