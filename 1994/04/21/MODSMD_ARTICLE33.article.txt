# Conan O'Brien Real life can be fun
## 
### 
Conan O'Brien's reputation precedes
him: his "people" claim the late night
talk show host is a good interview.
Maybe even too good — they say they have
hard time getting him off the phone and keep
ing him to a schedule.
For once, all the talk isn't hype. The 30-
year-old O'Brien really is a good guy to talk to.
In fact, he might he just too good: O'Brien
turns what could be 10-minute, assembly
line, constructed promotional spiel into a in
sightful half-hour run-on sentence dotted
with plenty of "Do you know what I mean?"s
to keep you with him.
After a couple of hours of taping and a cou
ple of hours doing phone interviews, O'Brien
still seems eager to launch into yet another
question-and-answer session about his show.
Not even the couple of hours of writing for
the next day's show ahead of him or a staph
infection can stop him from talking about his
show. In fact, O'Brien begins to critique this
evening's taping right after the pleasantries
have been pushed aside.
Taking chances
"It was good. I thought this was an okay
show," O'Brien says, changing his mind and
direction in mid-speech. "I like our show last
night. I thought we had more energy last
night.... But tonight, we did a thing we real
ly like, which was 'Emergency Guest.' "
O'Brien continues breathlessly, enthusi
astically explaining the comedy bit where a
tuxedo-clad, robot-resembling mannequin
is taken out of a glass case and placed into the
guest scat opposite O'Brien's desk. With a
flip of a switch by O'Brien's goofy sidekick
Andy Richter, the emergency guest begins to
talk the "generic movie talk," which culmi
nates in a wacky movie clip, involving the
mannequin and generic-movie-talking
Nazis. And when O'Brien resorts to the
emergency guest a little later on, things go
really crazy when chattering comedian
Gilbert Gottfried is freed from his glass cage.
It's controlled hysterics like these which set
O'Brien apart from his peers. And that's the
effect this newest member of the late night
talk show fraternity has wanted all along.
"I sort of felt from the beginning that we
need to take a lot of chances in the show. And
I think that's what we should be doing,"
O'Brien notes on the philosophy guiding the
show. "We're trying to do something new and
different. At the beginning, the thing to do
|is] to take a lot of chances. And we take big
swings at things and I think we hit enough so
that when we miss, it's OK."
Whether it's a hit (like when a 200-pound
ant tells a joke about Whitewater or when a
middle-aged streaker rushes across stage on
the night David Letterman makes an appear
ance as a guest) or a miss (such as the super
hero, " The Nicknamer"), what's obvious is
O'Brien's fresh effort at making unorthodox
comedy.
