Moreover, the craziness behind these skits
carries over to all aspects of the show. One
night, you might see O'Brien take his shoes off
in the middle of the monologue and saunter
about in socked feet. On another, you'll see
guest John Goodman leg-wrestling George
Wendt on the floor in front of O'Brien's desk.
Tritely yet truly put, anyone who's seen an
episode of "Late Night" knows that nothing is
sacred.
im going to grow o lot'
Still, there's a method with the madness —
after all, he is a Harvard man. Along with the
happy-go-lucky charm and schoolboy looks
come a savvy and serious side which seem to
be constantly reflected in his mannerisms and
approach. For instance, although he likes to
keep the comic intensity of the show high
with such madcap hi-jinks, O'Brien has
learned that making a variety show work in
volves more than molding an hour of wild
humor. Take his revamped approach to inter
viewing as just one example of how he is hon
ing his craft.
"What we used to do early is comedy that
blended in with the interviews. We'd get
someone who was doing the interview to
play along with something. And I sort ol re
alized that it sort of messed up the inter
view," O'Brien points out. "Interviews have
to have a sort of credibility or else they don't
work."
Much of the evolution of O'Brien's "Late
Night" can be attributed to his growing com
fort level on the air. In terms of interviewing,
it's being able to figure what about a guest in
terests him most. In terms of the show as a
whole, it's being able to evaluate where the
show has been and where it's going.
"I'm going to grow a lot. The more time
I'm on the camera, the more I become com
pletely comfortable, l ike now — I'm on so
much that I kind of forget. Which is good, be
cause I'm really like myself," he says earnest
ly.
"In the beginning, I was thinking, Don't
screw this up.' I was worried about doing
everything competently, to make sure to do
every thing right. But no one wants to see
that; so I don't do that and I'm not like that
anymore."
Still, this process of shaping and reshaping
the show seems neither haphazard nor overly
pre-meditated. By all accounts, O'Brien has
been moving the show along at a natural pace,
allowing the pieces to fall together with time.
Of course, it helps to have the support of the
network, a growing core ol steadfast viewers
and "total control" over all aspects ot his
show.
And, clearly, the show belongs to O'Brien.
He makes all the final decisions on the aes
thetic qualities of "Late Night," from which
celebrities he wants on the show to*which
comedy bits go on the air. As O'Brien puts it,
"there's no one making me do anything.

"We live in cynical times, so sometimes
people think, 'Oh, he's being controlled from
behind.' But in all honesty, I have total con
trol," O'Brien remarks, off-handedly refuting
the idea that he was chosen by NBC to be their
late night puppet.
In turn, the power O'Brien has over the
finished product gives him the "luxury" of
being himself. Perhaps the most alluring as
pect emanates from the host's sincerity. Sure,
he might seem a little fidgety as he runs
through the monologue. Or a little uncom
fortable when he's placed next to a glitzy star.
Yet the collection of these "flaws" somehow
works for O'Brien. Certainly it's more inter
esting to see him out on stage than it is to
watch another boring, plastic-faced host go
through a nightly routine.
"I'm pretty much who I am. I'm not de
ceiving anybody. 1 just come out and go 'Hey
everybody!' and tell a few jokes," O'Brien says,
nonchalantly describing his craft. In short, it's
almost like you know the host.
Just do it
In some sense, you do. The son ot a doctor
and attorney, O'Brien personifies the subur
ban, college-educated brat. What s so heart
ening about his new-found, not-so-ordinary
fame is the not-so-unordinary way he
climbed to such heights. In these days when
even the wonderland of movies spoon-feed us
doom and gloom, it's nice to see someone
with motivation, talent and perseverance suc
ceed in real life.
"I'll be the first one to tell you that I got
some luck breaks along the way. I'm not going
to deny that. But it helped to get into the I lar
vard Lampoon. I started writing comedy very
seriously when 1 was 18 years old. So I got sort
of an early jump on it," O'Brien says.
"I got my first check writing a piece for a
Harvard Lampoon parody of Newsweek. I
photocopied the check — and I still have it.
That's something that's helped me.... When
I came out of college, I knew exactly what I
wanted to do."
In fact, that's the message the amiable
O'Brien relates to us aspiring folks with our
heads in the clouds. The talk show host al
most turns into a preachy motivational
speaker when he passes on the knowledge he's
gained on his way. According to him, "the
Nike commercials are truer than you think."
"A lot of young people tell me, 'I want to
write for TV. I want to do TV.' I'll say 'What
d'you got?' And they don't have anything. It's
like anything else: if you want to do it, just do
it. I■ veil it you don't get paid for it, just start
doing it," O'Brien says.
"Do it and take criticism and learn from it
and move on and do it some more. And so by
the time you get out ot college, you II have
something to show people."
While these words may sound like they
come down from someone on high, O'Brien
speaks sincerely from experience. When he

decided to pursue comedy at age 18, he did
everything he could to work on his skills, in
cluding emcee ing events to tel 1 jokes an d wr i t -
ing pieces for the Harvard Lampoon. After his
college years and two stints as president of the
Lampoon, O'Brien took his fortunes to Los
Angeles, where he promptly joined the ac
claimed Groundlings Theatre to get more of
taste for both writing and performing. With
hard work, he hit the "big time," producing
and writing for "The Simpsons" and per
forming and writing for "Saturday Night
Live." Although it may sound hackneyed, he's
certainly paid his dues.
No resets
What's more, O'Brien has encountered
some of the same crossroads we college stu
dents are about to face. F.ven without the
guarantee of the golden days he basks in now,
he nonetheless decided to pursue what he en
joyed most in lieu of a more secure path.
"1 was scared when I decided. It's scary to
decide not to apply to graduate school and try
to do this weird thing that no one in my fam
ily has ever done before. That was a scary de
cision to make. [But] fear is no reason not to
do something. It really isn't. And I've been in
scary situations in my life and I'll be in more
of them," O'Brien punctuates with a nervous
chuckle. "They've been good to me. You just
have to know.
"I just knew, 'Look, I'm not going to be
happy if I'm a lawyer or working in some of
fice. This is what is going to make me happy
so I've got to try. You can't regret that."
Yet before anyone thinks everything has
become peachy keen for O'Brien now that
he's got his own outlet to show off his
comedic talents, just remember back to the
early days of his show last fall. As a virtual un
known, O'Brien took a lot flack for essential
ly not being David Letterman. While the re
views have gotten better as O'Brien continues
to carve out his own "Late Night" niche, he

still tends to ignore what the media say about
him.
"There have been lots of nice things writ
ten about me too. But I don't look at them too
closely either, do you know?" O'Brien affirms.
"Either way, you get screwed up. The good
stuff is as misleading as the bad stuff some
times. You really do have to focus on tollow
ing your own instinct."
Clearly, it's not what other people think
that drives the driven host; it's what he thinks
about himself that matters.
"The only thing I think about now is that 1
want to do this as well as I and my team can do
it. I want this show to hit its potential. That's
what we'd all want. I'd be happy.
"Are we at our potential now?" O'Brien
asks himself. "No— 1 think we've hit a nice
groove the last few months. I think it's catch
ing 0n.... That feels really good; but in all
honesty, I want this thing to be as amazing as
I know it could be. I really do think it could be
something very different.... [W]e're taking
chances, which is where I think good things
come from."
Until the day everything comes together
and O'Brien creates that ideal episode of "I ate
Night," he'll be satisfied with what he's done
thus tar to change things for his audience, lust
as the risks he's taken in the past have brought
him to where he is today, it's just possible that
the risks O'Brien is taking now will help turn
his show's potential into reality.
"Things have been going pretty well for us.
Our ratings have been climbing and the net
work seems really happy. Things are great and
I'm happy about that," O'Brien remarks.
"But if somebody were to throw a switch
and it were to go away tomorrow, I wouldn't
regret that we took a lot of chances. I wouldn't
regret it at all." ■

guest John Goodman leg-wrestling George
Wendt on the floor in front of O'Brien's desk.
Tritely yet truly put, anyone who's seen an
episode of "Late Night" knows that nothing is
sacred.
im going to grow o lot'
Still, there's a method with the madness —
after all, he is a Harvard man. Along with the
happy-go-lucky charm and schoolboy looks
come a savvy and serious side which seem to
be constantly reflected in his mannerisms and
approach. For instance, although he likes to
keep the comic intensity of the show high
with such madcap hi-jinks, O'Brien has
learned that making a variety show work in
volves more than molding an hour of wild
humor. Take his revamped approach to inter
viewing as just one example of how he is hon
ing his craft.
"What we used to do early is comedy that
blended in with the interviews. We'd get
someone who was doing the interview to
play along with something. And I sort ol re
alized that it sort of messed up the inter
view," O'Brien points out. "Interviews have
to have a sort of credibility or else they don't
work."
Much of the evolution of O'Brien's "Late
Night" can be attributed to his growing com
fort level on the air. In terms of interviewing,
it's being able to figure what about a guest in
terests him most. In terms of the show as a
whole, it's being able to evaluate where the
show has been and where it's going.
"I'm going to grow a lot. The more time
I'm on the camera, the more I become com
pletely comfortable, l ike now — I'm on so
much that I kind of forget. Which is good, be
cause I'm really like myself," he says earnest
ly.
"In the beginning, I was thinking, Don't
screw this up.' I was worried about doing
everything competently, to make sure to do
every thing right. But no one wants to see
that; so I don't do that and I'm not like that
anymore."
Still, this process of shaping and reshaping
the show seems neither haphazard nor overly
pre-meditated. By all accounts, O'Brien has
been moving the show along at a natural pace,
allowing the pieces to fall together with time.
Of course, it helps to have the support of the
network, a growing core ol steadfast viewers
and "total control" over all aspects ot his
show.
And, clearly, the show belongs to O'Brien.
He makes all the final decisions on the aes
thetic qualities of "Late Night," from which
celebrities he wants on the show to*which
comedy bits go on the air. As O'Brien puts it,
"there's no one making me do anything.

"We live in cynical times, so sometimes
people think, 'Oh, he's being controlled from
behind.' But in all honesty, I have total con
trol," O'Brien remarks, off-handedly refuting
the idea that he was chosen by NBC to be their
late night puppet.
In turn, the power O'Brien has over the
finished product gives him the "luxury" of
being himself. Perhaps the most alluring as
pect emanates from the host's sincerity. Sure,
he might seem a little fidgety as he runs
through the monologue. Or a little uncom
fortable when he's placed next to a glitzy star.
Yet the collection of these "flaws" somehow
works for O'Brien. Certainly it's more inter
esting to see him out on stage than it is to
watch another boring, plastic-faced host go
through a nightly routine.
"I'm pretty much who I am. I'm not de
ceiving anybody. 1 just come out and go 'Hey
everybody!' and tell a few jokes," O'Brien says,
nonchalantly describing his craft. In short, it's
almost like you know the host.
Just do it
In some sense, you do. The son ot a doctor
and attorney, O'Brien personifies the subur
ban, college-educated brat. What s so heart
ening about his new-found, not-so-ordinary
fame is the not-so-unordinary way he
climbed to such heights. In these days when
even the wonderland of movies spoon-feed us
doom and gloom, it's nice to see someone
with motivation, talent and perseverance suc
ceed in real life.
"I'll be the first one to tell you that I got
some luck breaks along the way. I'm not going
to deny that. But it helped to get into the I lar
vard Lampoon. I started writing comedy very
seriously when 1 was 18 years old. So I got sort
of an early jump on it," O'Brien says.
"I got my first check writing a piece for a
Harvard Lampoon parody of Newsweek. I
photocopied the check — and I still have it.
That's something that's helped me.... When
I came out of college, I knew exactly what I
wanted to do."
In fact, that's the message the amiable
O'Brien relates to us aspiring folks with our
heads in the clouds. The talk show host al
most turns into a preachy motivational
speaker when he passes on the knowledge he's
gained on his way. According to him, "the
Nike commercials are truer than you think."
"A lot of young people tell me, 'I want to
write for TV. I want to do TV.' I'll say 'What
d'you got?' And they don't have anything. It's
like anything else: if you want to do it, just do
it. I■ veil it you don't get paid for it, just start
doing it," O'Brien says.
"Do it and take criticism and learn from it
and move on and do it some more. And so by
the time you get out ot college, you II have
something to show people."
While these words may sound like they
come down from someone on high, O'Brien
speaks sincerely from experience. When he

decided to pursue comedy at age 18, he did
everything he could to work on his skills, in
cluding emcee ing events to tel 1 jokes an d wr i t -
ing pieces for the Harvard Lampoon. After his
college years and two stints as president of the
Lampoon, O'Brien took his fortunes to Los
Angeles, where he promptly joined the ac
claimed Groundlings Theatre to get more of
taste for both writing and performing. With
hard work, he hit the "big time," producing
and writing for "The Simpsons" and per
forming and writing for "Saturday Night
Live." Although it may sound hackneyed, he's
certainly paid his dues.
No resets
What's more, O'Brien has encountered
some of the same crossroads we college stu
dents are about to face. F.ven without the
guarantee of the golden days he basks in now,
he nonetheless decided to pursue what he en
joyed most in lieu of a more secure path.
"1 was scared when I decided. It's scary to
decide not to apply to graduate school and try
to do this weird thing that no one in my fam
ily has ever done before. That was a scary de
cision to make. [But] fear is no reason not to
do something. It really isn't. And I've been in
scary situations in my life and I'll be in more
of them," O'Brien punctuates with a nervous
chuckle. "They've been good to me. You just
have to know.
"I just knew, 'Look, I'm not going to be
happy if I'm a lawyer or working in some of
fice. This is what is going to make me happy
so I've got to try. You can't regret that."
Yet before anyone thinks everything has
become peachy keen for O'Brien now that
he's got his own outlet to show off his
comedic talents, just remember back to the
early days of his show last fall. As a virtual un
known, O'Brien took a lot flack for essential
ly not being David Letterman. While the re
views have gotten better as O'Brien continues
to carve out his own "Late Night" niche, he

still tends to ignore what the media say about
him.
"There have been lots of nice things writ
ten about me too. But I don't look at them too
closely either, do you know?" O'Brien affirms.
"Either way, you get screwed up. The good
stuff is as misleading as the bad stuff some
times. You really do have to focus on tollow
ing your own instinct."
Clearly, it's not what other people think
that drives the driven host; it's what he thinks
about himself that matters.
"The only thing I think about now is that 1
want to do this as well as I and my team can do
it. I want this show to hit its potential. That's
what we'd all want. I'd be happy.
"Are we at our potential now?" O'Brien
asks himself. "No— 1 think we've hit a nice
groove the last few months. I think it's catch
ing 0n.... That feels really good; but in all
honesty, I want this thing to be as amazing as
I know it could be. I really do think it could be
something very different.... [W]e're taking
chances, which is where I think good things
come from."
Until the day everything comes together
and O'Brien creates that ideal episode of "I ate
Night," he'll be satisfied with what he's done
thus tar to change things for his audience, lust
as the risks he's taken in the past have brought
him to where he is today, it's just possible that
the risks O'Brien is taking now will help turn
his show's potential into reality.
"Things have been going pretty well for us.
Our ratings have been climbing and the net
work seems really happy. Things are great and
I'm happy about that," O'Brien remarks.
"But if somebody were to throw a switch
and it were to go away tomorrow, I wouldn't
regret that we took a lot of chances. I wouldn't
regret it at all." ■

im going to grow o lot'
Still, there's a method with the madness —
after all, he is a Harvard man. Along with the
happy-go-lucky charm and schoolboy looks
come a savvy and serious side which seem to
be constantly reflected in his mannerisms and
approach. For instance, although he likes to
keep the comic intensity of the show high
with such madcap hi-jinks, O'Brien has
learned that making a variety show work in
volves more than molding an hour of wild
humor. Take his revamped approach to inter
viewing as just one example of how he is hon
ing his craft.
"What we used to do early is comedy that
blended in with the interviews. We'd get
someone who was doing the interview to
play along with something. And I sort ol re
alized that it sort of messed up the inter
view," O'Brien points out. "Interviews have
to have a sort of credibility or else they don't
work."
Much of the evolution of O'Brien's "Late
Night" can be attributed to his growing com
fort level on the air. In terms of interviewing,
it's being able to figure what about a guest in
terests him most. In terms of the show as a
whole, it's being able to evaluate where the
show has been and where it's going.
"I'm going to grow a lot. The more time
I'm on the camera, the more I become com
pletely comfortable, l ike now — I'm on so
much that I kind of forget. Which is good, be
cause I'm really like myself," he says earnest
ly.
"In the beginning, I was thinking, Don't
screw this up.' I was worried about doing
everything competently, to make sure to do
every thing right. But no one wants to see
that; so I don't do that and I'm not like that
anymore."
Still, this process of shaping and reshaping
the show seems neither haphazard nor overly
pre-meditated. By all accounts, O'Brien has
been moving the show along at a natural pace,
allowing the pieces to fall together with time.
Of course, it helps to have the support of the
network, a growing core ol steadfast viewers
and "total control" over all aspects ot his
show.
And, clearly, the show belongs to O'Brien.
He makes all the final decisions on the aes
thetic qualities of "Late Night," from which
celebrities he wants on the show to*which
comedy bits go on the air. As O'Brien puts it,
"there's no one making me do anything.

"We live in cynical times, so sometimes
people think, 'Oh, he's being controlled from
behind.' But in all honesty, I have total con
trol," O'Brien remarks, off-handedly refuting
the idea that he was chosen by NBC to be their
late night puppet.
In turn, the power O'Brien has over the
finished product gives him the "luxury" of
being himself. Perhaps the most alluring as
pect emanates from the host's sincerity. Sure,
he might seem a little fidgety as he runs
through the monologue. Or a little uncom
fortable when he's placed next to a glitzy star.
Yet the collection of these "flaws" somehow
works for O'Brien. Certainly it's more inter
esting to see him out on stage than it is to
watch another boring, plastic-faced host go
through a nightly routine.
"I'm pretty much who I am. I'm not de
ceiving anybody. 1 just come out and go 'Hey
everybody!' and tell a few jokes," O'Brien says,
nonchalantly describing his craft. In short, it's
almost like you know the host.
Just do it
In some sense, you do. The son ot a doctor
and attorney, O'Brien personifies the subur
ban, college-educated brat. What s so heart
ening about his new-found, not-so-ordinary
fame is the not-so-unordinary way he
climbed to such heights. In these days when
even the wonderland of movies spoon-feed us
doom and gloom, it's nice to see someone
with motivation, talent and perseverance suc
ceed in real life.
"I'll be the first one to tell you that I got
some luck breaks along the way. I'm not going
to deny that. But it helped to get into the I lar
vard Lampoon. I started writing comedy very
seriously when 1 was 18 years old. So I got sort
of an early jump on it," O'Brien says.
"I got my first check writing a piece for a
Harvard Lampoon parody of Newsweek. I
photocopied the check — and I still have it.
That's something that's helped me.... When
I came out of college, I knew exactly what I
wanted to do."
In fact, that's the message the amiable
O'Brien relates to us aspiring folks with our
heads in the clouds. The talk show host al
most turns into a preachy motivational
speaker when he passes on the knowledge he's
gained on his way. According to him, "the
Nike commercials are truer than you think."
"A lot of young people tell me, 'I want to
write for TV. I want to do TV.' I'll say 'What
d'you got?' And they don't have anything. It's
like anything else: if you want to do it, just do
it. I■ veil it you don't get paid for it, just start
doing it," O'Brien says.
"Do it and take criticism and learn from it
and move on and do it some more. And so by
the time you get out ot college, you II have
something to show people."
While these words may sound like they
come down from someone on high, O'Brien
speaks sincerely from experience. When he

decided to pursue comedy at age 18, he did
everything he could to work on his skills, in
cluding emcee ing events to tel 1 jokes an d wr i t -
ing pieces for the Harvard Lampoon. After his
college years and two stints as president of the
Lampoon, O'Brien took his fortunes to Los
Angeles, where he promptly joined the ac
claimed Groundlings Theatre to get more of
taste for both writing and performing. With
hard work, he hit the "big time," producing
and writing for "The Simpsons" and per
forming and writing for "Saturday Night
Live." Although it may sound hackneyed, he's
certainly paid his dues.
No resets
What's more, O'Brien has encountered
some of the same crossroads we college stu
dents are about to face. F.ven without the
guarantee of the golden days he basks in now,
he nonetheless decided to pursue what he en
joyed most in lieu of a more secure path.
"1 was scared when I decided. It's scary to
decide not to apply to graduate school and try
to do this weird thing that no one in my fam
ily has ever done before. That was a scary de
cision to make. [But] fear is no reason not to
do something. It really isn't. And I've been in
scary situations in my life and I'll be in more
of them," O'Brien punctuates with a nervous
chuckle. "They've been good to me. You just
have to know.
"I just knew, 'Look, I'm not going to be
happy if I'm a lawyer or working in some of
fice. This is what is going to make me happy
so I've got to try. You can't regret that."
Yet before anyone thinks everything has
become peachy keen for O'Brien now that
he's got his own outlet to show off his
comedic talents, just remember back to the
early days of his show last fall. As a virtual un
known, O'Brien took a lot flack for essential
ly not being David Letterman. While the re
views have gotten better as O'Brien continues
to carve out his own "Late Night" niche, he

still tends to ignore what the media say about
him.
"There have been lots of nice things writ
ten about me too. But I don't look at them too
closely either, do you know?" O'Brien affirms.
"Either way, you get screwed up. The good
stuff is as misleading as the bad stuff some
times. You really do have to focus on tollow
ing your own instinct."
Clearly, it's not what other people think
that drives the driven host; it's what he thinks
about himself that matters.
"The only thing I think about now is that 1
want to do this as well as I and my team can do
it. I want this show to hit its potential. That's
what we'd all want. I'd be happy.
"Are we at our potential now?" O'Brien
asks himself. "No— 1 think we've hit a nice
groove the last few months. I think it's catch
ing 0n.... That feels really good; but in all
honesty, I want this thing to be as amazing as
I know it could be. I really do think it could be
something very different.... [W]e're taking
chances, which is where I think good things
come from."
Until the day everything comes together
and O'Brien creates that ideal episode of "I ate
Night," he'll be satisfied with what he's done
thus tar to change things for his audience, lust
as the risks he's taken in the past have brought
him to where he is today, it's just possible that
the risks O'Brien is taking now will help turn
his show's potential into reality.
"Things have been going pretty well for us.
Our ratings have been climbing and the net
work seems really happy. Things are great and
I'm happy about that," O'Brien remarks.
"But if somebody were to throw a switch
and it were to go away tomorrow, I wouldn't
regret that we took a lot of chances. I wouldn't
regret it at all." ■
