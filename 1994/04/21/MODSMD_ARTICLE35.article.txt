# Bring the 'BackBeat'
## A 						band, some music and a love story 
### 
Despite several historical inaccuracies,
"Backßeat" — focusing on the complex rela
tionships among John Lennon, his best friend
Stuart Sutcliffe, and Stuart's lover Astrid Kirch
herr — serves as an engaging and realistic mu
sical drama of the Beatles' life in Hamburg be
fore the group launched into world wide fame.
While at times the plot drags, lain Softley's
exciting direction carries the movie through its
slow points. "Backßeat" transcends being a
good movie to a being a great one, because it
accomplishes the difficult task of capturing the
essence of the Beatles and their lifestyles before
they became famous.
Softley uses this fascinating subplot of the
Beatles' development as a springboard to ex
plore the romantic relationship that develops
between Stuart and Astrid Kirchherr (Sheryl
Lee of "Twin Peaks" fame), a 22-year-old Ger
man photographer and existentialist.
Unlike most movies that do not dare to
show the human side of icons like John
Lennon, "Backßeat" displays John's jealousy
and dependence on Stuart's friendship. Soft
ley's writing and direction is evidence that he
deeply understood the complex man Lennon
was and his bond with Stuart.
"Backßeat" also brings up the possibility
that John and Stuart had a sexual attraction to
each other. Unfortunately, Softley is homo
phobic in his repudiation of the suggestion —
he adds to it by emphasizes John's heterosexu
ality, using the ridicule of gay men as comic re
lief and attempting to make the Beatles' homo
phobia a source of humor which interferes
with the representation of John and Stuart's
friendship.
John and Astrid's relationship was also cen
tral to "Backßeat," especially in providing ac
curate insight into their real life personas. Lee
represents Astrid as the poised, intelligent and
talented woman she was. The haircut and pho-

tography scenes (the
pictures are imita
tions of real pictures
that she took of the
Beatles) touch the sur
face of Astrid's nu
merous artistic and
intellectual influences
on John, Stuart, and
the rest of the Beatles.
Softley used Astrid's
incisiveness to explain
aspects of John, such
as her comments
about him being so
angry and "always in a
hurry."
Although Softley
and fellow writers
Michael Thomas and
Stephen Ward wrote
an engrossing screen
play based on several
sources of informa
tion, the movie has
several shortcomings.
At times it drags and
fails to coherently
connect the plot with
prior scenes. Howev
er, the gripping cam-

era angles and solid musical scenes that Softley
learned as a director of music videos and doc
umentaries compensate for the occasional
slow story development.
"Backßeat" becomes a "must see" movie,
especially for die-hard Beatles fans, because it
recreated vividly what it must have been like to
watch the Beatles perform in Hamburg and to
be among their coterie. However, since "Back-
Beat" did not focus on Paul McCartney and
George Harrison, their personalities are a trite

portrayal that adds little to the movie.
The most striking aspect of the actors re
semblance to the real Beatles was their stage
presence. Hart straddled the microphone with
a tough guy stance and bounced to the beat as
John Lennon had. Gary Bakewell's perfor
mance of Paul's smile and head bob augment
ed his already striking similarity to Paul. Dress
ing and grooming the actors in the "teddy boy"
style of the Beatles made the Hamburg scenes
even more realistic

There are, however, glaring historical errors
in "Backßeat" Most striking is the blasphe
mous closing scene at the airport, because John
did not cry but instead burst into hysterical
laughter. This lack of true emotion demon
strates that he kept his pain inside of himself, a
central aspect of his personality. However, the
highest praise I can give "Backßeat" is in saying
that these flaws did not inhibit a rabid Beatles
fan like myself from enjoying the film.
