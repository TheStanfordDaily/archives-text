With the studio-backed "Serial Mom,"
filmmaker John Waters finally has at his dis
posal a budget sufficiently hefty to generate
production values comparable to the slickly
commercialized iconography of suburban
America he has been spoofing for the past
three decades.
Indeed, whenever Kathleen Turner as Se
rial Mom announces breakfast proceedings
to her picture-perfect family, birds start
whistling outside the kitchen window to
bring a helpless tear of recognition to many a
morning-cereal-ad-inflicted eye.
Those who dared to chuckle at Divine's

cannibalistic romps
in vintage Waters
fare like "Pink
Flamingos" will
find the directors
latest subversive
take on domestic
consumer culture
somewhat watered
down by industry
rating guidelines.
Nevertheless, the
darker stirrings be
neath the pristine

surface respectability of an eco-conscious
homemaker may prove a more disturbing
onslaught on the Norman Rockwellian
school of thought. Divine's contrived Techni
color excesses ultimately provided a protec
tive distance from mundane grays of reality.
Turner's obvious enthusiasm for her char
acter is palpable, as her rampage through the
unsuspecting Baltimore suburbia leaves a
sarcastic schoolteacher, a heart-breaking col
lege boy and a couple of dietary kamikazes in
her trail, but the film's plodding second half
fails to measure up.
Particularly uninspired is the court-room
coda; when John Waters resorts to borrowing
a gag from "Basic Instinct" without twisting it
into caricature, something must clearly be
amiss. At best, the 1 lth-hour cameos by Patty
Hearst and Suzanne Somers come across as
mildly amusing cheap-shots at novelty; at
worst, one gets a nasty aftertaste from witness
ing an achingly self-congratulatory Waters
homage being paid by brand-name celebrities.
Still, there is plenty in "Serial Mom" to be
thankful for. When Turner creeps up behind
a victim who is merrily chirping away at
Barry Manilow's "Tomorrow" to the open
ing credits of "Annie" on TV, it is comforting
to know that in the world of John Waters at
least, carnage is sometimes richly justified.
