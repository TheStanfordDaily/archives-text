# Pink Flamingos
## 
### 
I had two responses to "Pink Flamingos."
One was a bizarre sense of the sublime and
the other was a gag reflex. Both came simul
taneously, and both speak of the curious
power of the B-movie in general, and John
Waters in specific.
The plot: a certain Ms. Divine holds the
dubitable honor of being called the "filthiest
person in the world." Unbeknownst to Di
vine, her title as the most lewd and crude is
coveted by a Mr. and Mrs. Marble — a pair
whose pastimes include arson, the selling of
babies and an advanced form of public expo
sure which requires a sausage. The rest of
movie consists of competition, sabotage and
crank mail in which the two competing par
ties fight for the highest filth trophy of all —
good publicity.
John Waters shows us the beauty of the
underworld. He endeavors for us in the audi
ence to remember the glory and sublimity
that exists in pimps, pornography, phone
sex, cigarette butts, mother-son blow jobs
and fat people in their underwear. He is the
ultimate end in political correctness where
we not only tolerate difference, but we also
come to embrace what we despise.
And it is not a romanticization of the

taboo. "Pink Flamingos" admits that its sub
ject is ugly (it is subtitled "An experiment in
bad taste"). We are not shown the hidden
beauty in sin, we are shown the obvious ugli
ness of it. The movie is not challenging us to
love our secret desires — that would be too
easy. Instead it is challenging us to love our
ugliest parts — to caress our zits and to sniff
ourselves lovingly.
And with great pathos comes great humor.
You are forced, against your better con
science, to laugh at fat people and chicken sex.
The scenes are violent, tragic and amusing.
And Waters would also add, beautiful.
1 liked the movie best during its transition
al scenes set to '50s rebel rock. At those times
the movie becomes what it tries to be
throughout — a nice anthem for the ugly.

= Don't even think about
missing this.


= If you have money to burn,
this is for you.


= Even a freebie is a waste of
time.
