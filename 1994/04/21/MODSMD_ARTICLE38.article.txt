## Courtney and company 'Live Through This' 
### 
Largely forgotten amid the empty specu
lation and romanticism that immediately
followed the suicide of Kurt Cobain last
week were those the Nirvana frontman left
behind. Forgotten, that is, until fans gath
ered at a Seattle memorial service for
Cobain heard the wrenching, recorded
message of Cobain's wife, Courtney Love,
who told the throng that "this is all bull
shit," and instructed them to call Cobain an
"asshole."
Love's diatribe might be interpreted as a
reflection of her often-tempestuous mar
riage with Cobain, with whom she had a
daughter, Frances. But that would be to in
terpret Love wrongly. Instead, we might use
the unrestrained grief Love expressed to
understand Love on her own terms, as a
thoughtful yet emotive artist who, at the
time of Cobain's death, was on the verge of
becoming a major voice in American
music.
Unfortunately, the unparalleled rise and
fall of Cobain threatens to obscure Love's
achievements and growth as a musician.
That's a real loss, especially considering the
strength of "Live Through This," the fine
new album from Love's band Hole.
Past efforts by the four members of I lole
— as both soloists and as a group — have
been engaging but ragged, offering hints of
more substantial, sustained work. Love's
standing as one of the godmothers of
punk's raucous "riot grrl" movement con
fined Hole — somewhat justifiably — to
the fringes of popular acceptance. But on
"Live Through This," the band balances its
flights of emotional fury with tight, smart
songwriting.
The album's second song, "Miss World,'
has the more adolescent spirit of Hole's past
work, as Love wails, "Kill me pills / No one
cares my friend." Yet at the same time, the

intelligence of the songs' hooks now draws
listeners in, rather than repelling them.
On "Asking For It," Love comments with
dripping irony on the cruelty of relation
ships. "Was she asking for it?" she asks.
"Did she ask nice?" Musically, "Asking For
It" disguises a listenable melody behind the
sonic swirl of Eric Frlandson's guitar.
Meanwhile, Love frequently launches
into howling fits, her voice cutting over the
frenetic pace of the rhythm section, wom
anned by basisst Kristen M. Pfaff and
drummer Patty Schemel. That's not to say
Love can't carry the group's melodies with
proper restraint. Left to its own devices,
Love's sultry, lingering delivery lends Hole
a mark of undeniable distinctiveness.
Musically, "Live Through This" resem
bles the sprightly work of other female
fronted bands like the Breeders and Belly.
On the album's most ballad-like songs,
"Doll Parts" and "Softer, Softest," Hole
pulls back, layering fairly warm harmonics
over simple understated tunes. But "Live
Through This" has no "Feed the Tree" — no
easily accessible pop song likely to be fea
tured on a Fox soap opera.
Instead, Hole is more idiosyncratic, fol
lowing a fearsome, straight-ahead rocker
like "She Walks With Me" with the compli
cated "I Think That 1 Would Die," which
shifts meter and mood several times, keep
ing the listener off-balance, uneasy, as Love
contemplates the future with the anguished
uncertainty the song's title suggests.
Based on "Live Through This," the fu
ture seems full of possibility for Hole. 'The
band shows a surer grasp of the appeal —
and burdens — of growing up. On the
album's last song, "Rock Star," Love sings of
"When I went to school in Olympia / We all
looked the same / We all talked the same."
It's a recognition that when Love and

friends thought they were rebelling against
conformity, they were only producing the
same trite twenty-something noise. While
the unevenness of "Live Through This"
shows that the vestiges of youth remain,
this disc shows that the hand has arrived at
a better, wiser place.

But that was before the tragedy of
Cobain's suicide cast a shroud on the
brightness of Hole's future. This album
makes one hope that Love and the rest of
the group can confront their grief, live
through this and press on.

Sure the group's been touted to be the "Next Big Thing." But it's not all hype — Hole de
livers something new in a scene that's growing kind of old.
