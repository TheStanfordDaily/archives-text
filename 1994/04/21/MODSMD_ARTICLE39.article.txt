# "Vauxhall and I" Morrissey
## spins

Morrissey. People are moved to emotions
of extreme adoration or nausea at the mention
of this cult hero. 1 le has shaped many a per
former and angst-ridden teen in his role as vo
calist for the Smiths or currently as a solo
artist, but he has never had a top-40 hit in the
States. In England it's a surprise if his singles
don't reach the top five. Morrissey characteris
tically allows this to depress him.
He has been doing incredible work for

many years and has
yet to become the
apple of the Ameri
can media's eye. Per
haps "Vauxhall and I"
will change that.
Critics have been
raving that "Vaux
hall" is Morrissey's
best work since the
Smiths. A few even
say that if he contin-

ues to produce albums like "Vauxhall" there
will no longer be a cry for the Smiths. Morris
sey believes "Vauxhall" to be the "best record
I've ever made."
"Vauxhall and I" is very satisfying. A defi
nite flashback to "Viva Hate," his best album,
but more of a departure from the work with
the Smiths than "Viva." "Vauxhall" is com
posed of a more idyllic, harmonic, floating,
often acoustic guitar based music. The album
is laced with gentle persuasive melodies beg
ging for attention, in particular "I Am Hated
for I-oving" and"The lazy Sunbathcrs." The
harsher songs such as "Speedway" or "Hilly
Bud" never stray as far away from the whole
harmony of the work acting as complimenta
ry peaks.
Lyrically Morrisseys genius in eloquently
relating personal self-loathing and universal
misery is unmatched. Definitely these lyrics
feel different. Some complain they aren't as
"g(H>d." I disagree. "Vauxhall" just reflects a
more accepting Morrissey with his life which is
eternally shadowed by depression. Many still
sec him as the pasty 23-year-old of the Smiths.
Maybe he is, but at least now he dresses well.
