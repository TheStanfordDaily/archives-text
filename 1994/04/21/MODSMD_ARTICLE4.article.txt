# State files suit against 3 former Bookstore heads
## 
### Sarah Katz Editorial staff 
Three former Stanford Book
store officials are being sued by
the California Attorney General's
office for investing Bookstore
funds in speculative stocks, and
one of the three has also been
charged with appropriating more
than $25,000 for personal use.
The Attorney General's office
filed the lawsuit for breach of fidu
ciary duty and negligence yester
day after a two-year investigation,
but did not name the Stanford
Bookstore itself as a party to the
action.
Former general manager
Eldon Speed, assistant manager
Philip Chiaramonte and con
troller Patrick McDonald face civil
charges for their compliance in
risky investments of Bookstore
assets that resulted in a $2 million
loss on the stock market for the

non-profit orga
nization.
In addition, a
second cause of
action charges
McDonald with
diverting Book
store funds for his
own use. Speed
and Chiaramonte
settled similar

personal claims out of court.
"Our audit discovered that
there had been substantial securi
ties losses," said Deputy Attorney
General Jim Schwartz. "We hope
to recover monetary damages."
The suit is also open, meaning
that up to 50 other people — "di
rectors, officers, trustees, agents
or employees of the defendants"
— may be named as parties later.
Speed and McDonald could not
be reached for comment vester
