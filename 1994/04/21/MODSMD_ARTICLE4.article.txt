# State files suit against 3 former Bookstore heads

### Sarah Katz Editorial staff 
Three former Stanford Book
store officials are being sued by
the California Attorney General's
office for investing Bookstore
funds in speculative stocks, and
one of the three has also been
charged with appropriating more
than $25,000 for personal use.
The Attorney General's office
filed the lawsuit for breach of fidu
ciary duty and negligence yester
day after a two-year investigation,
but did not name the Stanford
Bookstore itself as a party to the
action.
Former general manager
Eldon Speed, assistant manager
Philip Chiaramonte and con
troller Patrick McDonald face civil
charges for their compliance in
risky investments of Bookstore
assets that resulted in a $2 million
loss on the stock market for the

non-profit orga
nization.
In addition, a
second cause of
action charges
McDonald with
diverting Book
store funds for his
own use. Speed
and Chiaramonte
settled similar

personal claims out of court.
"Our audit discovered that
there had been substantial securi
ties losses," said Deputy Attorney
General Jim Schwartz. "We hope
to recover monetary damages."
The suit is also open, meaning
that up to 50 other people — "di
rectors, officers, trustees, agents
or employees of the defendants"
— may be named as parties later.
Speed and McDonald could not
be reached for comment vester

day. Chiaramonte refused to com
ment on the case.
"The purpose of the suit is for
the attorney general to recover on
an insurance policy the Bookstore
had," said attorney Martin Quinn,
who represents Speed and Chiara
monte. "To recover, he has to go
through the motions of suing."
The lawsuit is the first action
taken by the state in an investiga
tion that has been pending since
The Daily reported in February
1992 that senior Bookstore
employees were receiving perks
unheard of at other college book
stores, including use of a vacation
home in Twain Harte, Calif., and
company-provided automobiles.
"We're quite pleased that no
further action will be taken against
the Bookstore," said Law Prof.

Robert Weisberg, president of the
Bookstore's board of directors.
Weisberg added that no formal
action has ever been taken
against the Bookstore itself. "The
attorney general wanted to see
that the Bookstore created new
ways of governance to settle
financial problems. I guess he's
pleased," he said.
Specifically, the negligence
suit charges the former managers
with unwise investments of the
Bookstore's "charitable assets."
Schwartz said all charges against
the defendants are civil, not crim
inal.
The trio is alleged to have vio
lated the Bookstore's internal
policies as well as Corporations
Code section 5240, which allows
non-profit organizations to invest
in the stock market but mandates
that they "avoid speculation."
In February 1986, the suit
alleges, Chiaramonte and McDon
ald were authorized by the Board

of Directors to open a securities
account with Charles Schwab and
Co. However, the three defen
dants allegedly later changed the
account to one with higher risk
without the board's permission.
With this account, the defen
dants "engagefdl in a pattern and
practice of speculative, unwise
and unsound investments using
charitable assets," contradicting
the mandatory policy of the Book
store and resulting in an eventual
loss of more than $2 million,
according to the suit.
As part of the settlement,
Speed and Chiaramonte agreed to
give up their retirement benefits.
Speed's would have totaled more
than $63,000, and Chiara
monte's, $42,500. Speed also
repaid salary advances.
The Twain Harte house has
been sold, and the proceeds went
to the Stanford Bookstore. Auto
mobile leases entered into for the
benefit of the two former employ

ees have also been canceled.
McDonald is also charged with
"intentionally and wrongfully"
appropriating Bookstore funds
"for his own personal financial
benefit... in an amount present
ly unknown to plaintiff but esti
mated to exceed $25,000."
McDonald resigned his position at
the Bookstore in September 1990.
Schwartz said he did not
attempt to negotiate these claims
with McDonald.
Quinn said there has also
"been a settlement between my
clients and the Bookstore,"
although he would not comment
on the terms of that agreement.
Quinn said he thought the set
tlement was successful. "If
there's a good settlement,
nobody's pleased — everyone's a
little unhappy. I think that's
what happened," he said.
Schwartz said that suit was
filed yesterday but may "take a
while to resolve."
