# "With Honors" various artists

Although this year's filmmakers already
seem to be running out of new ways to pack
age celluloid commentaries on the twenty
something generation, the genre may receive a
shot in the arm from a long-standing ally to
the teen flick: the movie soundtrack.
Newly-released soundtracks like "Reality
Bites" and "Threesome" are holding their own
on the charts based largely on a winning for
mula of '80s standards and grunge-era angst
tunes. Add a couple of parent-esque classics to
the equation and you have the latest of these al
bums: the soundtrack to "With I tenors."
Shuffling eras and artists, the soundtrack
comes up with some intriguing combinations,
like l.ylc lx)vett's charming rendition of Irving
Berlin's "Blue Skies." This same system, how
ever, breeds the Pretenders' disappointing at
tempt at Bob Dylan's "Forever Young" and
Duran Duran's lackluster version of Robert
Plant and Jimmy Page's " Thank You."

Buckingham's nicely-executed "On the Wrong
Side" sounds a little like a hold-over from Pres
ident Clinton's inaugural festivities. A merely
re-styled "She Sells Sanctuary" from the Cult is
a welcome relief from the chaos.
Though Madonna's contribution, "I'll re
member," will sail through high school gradu
ation season on its "wind-beneath-my-wings"
sentiment, it signals Madonna's complete sur
render to the world of the musically mundane.
It's the younger generation that redeems the
soundtrack musically. Kristin Hersh's "Your
Ghost" is a tormented and dreamy tune vague
ly reminiscent of Sarah McLachlan's recent
work. Hersh's ballad is helped out by Michael
Stipe of R.E.M. — fast becoming the "bad
penny" of early '90s albums. Mudhoney and
both come off respectably, and
Belly kicks in with its catchy but strong cover of
Tom Jones' "It's Not Unusual."
Even given its weaknesses, the "With Hon
ors" Soundtrack contains just enough worth
while music to make it a decent investment —
especially at the popularity-induced bargain
prices the year's other "Generation X" movie
music compilations have merited.
