# Culinary Christmas, Cantonese-style
## Hong Kee serves up super-affordable food to please any palate by Kristie Stout 
### 
In the realm of Asian cuisine ex
ists an inverse relationship between
the quality of food and the quality
of the dining atmosphere: a hole
in-the-wall restaurant is most like
ly to serve exquisite palate-pleasers,
whereas one draped in chic decor is
most likely to offer an insipid inter
pretation of the real thing.
At Hong Kee, prepare yourself to
be surrounded by muzak hits, bub
bly Cantonese pop tunes, flashing
Christmas decor (yes, it's April)
and food that is both inexpensive
and tasty.
This often overlooked southern
Chinese restaurant specializes in
noodles, soup and fresh seafood.
Their noodle soup items (wanton
noodle soup, seafood noodle soup,
salty duck noodle soup, etc.), rang
ing from $3.25 to $3.95, represent a

delicious, less expensive alternative
for that overpriced piece of greasy
Domino's cardboard or that trip to
partake of some more dining mo
notony at Kimball or Stern.
Hong Kee also has a fresh Chi
nese deli featuring a chorus line of
dangling roast ducks and a dozen
more barbecue dishes that range
from $4.50 to $7.25. Another pop
ular meat dish at Hong Kee is the
dried sliced beef with orange sauce.
This $5.95 plate is a mouth-water
ing presentation of tender beef rest
ing in a thick soy and chili pepper
sauce, perfumed in citrus.
If you tend to stay clear of meat
dishes, relish the wide array of
Hong Kee's vegetable and bean
curd specialties. The sweet bok
choy paired with chewy and tender
black mushrooms in the "black

mushroom tender greens" dish is,
at $5.95, yet another culinary de
light.
For those who likethe exotic, I
advise the back page of the menu
for the te jia he cat can, or special
combination dinners. Since the
menu is scrawled in hastily written
Chinese, be prepared to ask for a
translator's assistance or exercise
your own prowess at character
recognition. The menu on the back
page gives you access to the more
adventurous dishes, offered at ex
tremely reasonable prices.
The menu, which changes every
month, lists combo dinners for a
group of two, four, six or eight. I,
along, with two companions, sam
pled the combo dinner for two and,
despite our ravenous appetites,
walked away with leftover cartons

of food. For only $ 18,
the dinner combina
tion for two is a meal
consisting of kim
chee, hot and sour
fish soup, salt-baked
whole prawns, stir
fried seasonal greens,
rice, fresh fruit, and a
salted fish, minced
pork, and bean curd
pot.
The soup is a won
derful collection of
fresh basil, fish, bean
sprouts, celery and
pineapple. Amazing-

ly, this seafood soup does not exude
a strong seafood taste. Prepared in
garlic, scallions and onions, the
salt-baked prawns also delight the
senses.

Hong Kee
600 W. El Camino Real (between Castro
and Calderon), Mountain View
961-6588
Recommendation: Extremely good food
comes cheap at Hong Kee, a hole-in-the
wall down El Camino. Plus, the Cantonese
pop tunes in the background provide nice
ambiance for a tasty and filling meal.

Your palate has long been
numbed by bland Stanford cuisine.
I advise you to trek to Hong Kee for
a dining experience that is both af
fordable and delicious. ■
