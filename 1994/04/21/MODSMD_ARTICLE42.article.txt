Angie
Sure, this movie screams "chic
flick!" Yet Geena Davis' portrayal of
a prototypical New York Italian
gum-chomper makes the movie
better than commonplace. While
some scenes seem a little trite be
cause of stereotypical characters,
other offbeat ones work: of note
are the scenes where Angie has to
deal with labor pains, where Davis
goes into hilariously inappropriate,
expletive-filled spasms. R
Belle Epoque
In the tradition of critically-ac
claimed, innocuous, little-known
European movies comes Spanish
director Fernando Trueba's "Belle
Epoque." But don't let the hype of
a Best Foreign Film Oscar fool you:
the story of four farmer's daughters
and a Spanish army deserter
serves up sizzling sex scenes, but
little historical or political content.
In essence, 1993's winner proves
to be nothing more than a dressed
up Penthouse Forum letter. R
Bitter Moon
Roman Polanski (of Manson Mur
der fame) is back with a fantastic

yet disturbing sexuality morality
tale that takes us into the lives of a
couple on the verge of sexual
breakdown. The setting: a cruise
ship; the purpose: restore vitality to
Oscar's (Peter Coyote) and Mimi's
(Emmanuelle Seigner) relationship.
Only Oscar and Mimi have yet to
learn that razors, urine and farm an
imals do not a healthy sexual rela
tionship make. A powerful film that
explores the dangerous territory of
the finitude of passion and attrac
tion. R
The House of the Spirits
In a poor imitation of a fantastic,
fantastical novel, an über-cast of
Jeremy Irons, Glenn Close, Winona
Ryder and Meryl Streep can't seem
to capture any of the sentiment of
the original text, based on author
Isabelle Allende's own life and up
bringing in Chile. It's a long, some
what painful, and tragic corruption
of the novel; save your $7 and buy
the book! R
The Hudsucker Proxy
The Coen brother duo who brought
you the cult hits, "Raising Arizona"
and "Barton Fink" are back with a

slightly less engaging, slightly
more corny flick. A mailroom em
ployee of a big toy company gets
promoted to the top when the boss
dies, but his invention of the "hula
hoop" proves too promising for the
main manipulator who wants Hud
sucker Industries to fail. But even
though it's a cold, simple morality
tale, it's got Tim Robbins and Paul
Newman, so it can't be all bad. PG
Major League II
If you're looking for a little comedy
with your baseball fun, you won't
find it in "Major League II." The se
quel proves to be a boring rehash
ing of the original, just on a slightly
larger scale: the hapless Cleveland
Indians win an American League
pennant rather than a mere division
championships. Just about nothing
in the flick works — except maybe
Bob Uecker's reprisal of a his
quick-witted commentator role, if
that's really a plus. PG
The Paper
As they say in the newspaper biz,
"The Paper" is Page One material.
Director Ron Howard ably guides a
star-studded cast through a day at

the presses to realistic lengths. And
while some of it may seem melo
dramatic or overacted, the theatrics
of the newsroom staff at the ficti
tious New York Sun play true to life.
R
The Ref
OK, the premise of burglar Denis
Leary kidnapping a family after a
botched robbery on Christmas Eve
may seem ludicrous. Yet "The Ref"
turns out to be great fun — espe
cially for those of you who know
what living in a bickering family.
What makes the movie work is di
rector Ted Demme's ability to walk
the fine line between an overdone
comedy or a wildly chaotic piece.
R
Sirens
If you've walked down University in
the last couple of weeks, you've
probably seen the marquee blaring
"Sirens: Be seduced." And the
movie delivers on that promise, al
luring viewers with its surreal, witty,
erotic and original story on the life
of Australian painter Norman Lind
say. In essence,this is an "art film"
in every sense of the term. R
