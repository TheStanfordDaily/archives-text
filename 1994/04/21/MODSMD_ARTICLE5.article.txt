## Chicano community meets with Rice, discusses Burciaga layoff, other issues 
### Beth Berselli Staff writer 
In a community meeting closed
to the press, members of Stan
ford's Chicano/Latino community
met with Provost Condoleezza
Rice last night to discuss the re
cent layoff of a high-ranking Chi
cana administrator and other re
lated issues.
After the standing-room-only
meeting of more than 100, several
students said they were dissatis
fied with the provost's answers
and doubted her commitment to
minority issues, especially in light
of the recent dismissal of Cecilia
Burciaga, an associate dean in the
Office of Student Affairs and resi

dent fellow in Casa Zapata.
"They're the same answers
we've always gotten," said doctor
al student Rod Hernandez.
"They're so vacuous that they've
just become a continuous hum."
El Centro Chicano Director
Frances Morales said Rice agreed
to involve community members in
the selection of a new RF for Casa
Zapata, but made few other
promises at the meeting.
"We agreed that the communi
ty is in the process of thinking
through Zapata and who they'd
like to try to bring into Zapata,"
Rice said in an interview last
night. "I said that I respect that
process and I will support their
recommendation."
Rice said she genuinely
attempted to reach the members
of the community, although she
pointed out that problems cannot
be solved in an hour-long meet
ing.
"I tried to use the meeting to
express again my commitment to
minority issues," Rice said. "I
said that I know that they have
doubts about our commitment to
these issues and all I can do over
the next couple of years is try to
erase those doubts."
At the meeting, community
members presented Rice with a
list of concerns which requested
a freeze on further layoffs of Chi
cano staff and quarterly meet
ings with members of the admin
istration, including Rice and Uni
versity President Gerhard
Casper.
"We gave Rice a report from
our task force that we created
after Cecilia was laid off,"
Hernandez said. "Essentially the
task force is in the process of
preparing a report card on the
status of Chicano students at
Stanford in all aspects of the Uni
versity."
Although members of the com
munity expressed disappoint
ment with Rice's comments, they
said that overall the meeting did
serve a useful purpose.
"I'm very frustrated with our
encounter with her, but I am
pleased to see what we have done
as a result of this frustration,"
Hernandez said.
"It was a good beginning. It
was only a beginning," Morales
said, adding that the tone of the
meeting was quiet. "It was not
confrontational at all," she
said.
Doctoral student Carrie Tira
do Bramen, a Chicana Fellow,
said the meeting served as a way
to "vent the community's frus
tration and also to unify us. We
felt a collective power."
Students and alumni spent
part of the meeting telling Rice
how important Burciaga was to
their community. "I think the
pitch of the students was from
the heart â€” that Cecilia means in
many ways a kind of emotional
core. One student called Cecilia

our surrogate mother. It was very
heartfelt," Bramen said.
Morales added that at a two
hour discussion following Rice's
talk several people said that "we
had maybe been too polite during
the meeting with Rice and hadn't
conveyed the anger the communi
ty is feeling." Some people won
dered "how effective it was for us
to be so respectful" toward Rice,
Morales said.
Several students said they
were angry at Rice for offering
few substantial solutions. "I
think that Provost Rice circum
vented the issues by speaking
'administrative' speech," Bramen
said.
"She knows how to talk a lot
and say nothing," Hernandez
said. "I don't have any hope for
what she says. I don't have faith
in her."
But Rice said she would like to
see people focus on concrete goals
to be achieved in the next few
years. "I think that having specif
ic goals to which we can try to
respond is more important than
just sitting here and saying that
we aren't making progress," she
said.
Although University policy
specifies that no one can be
barred from an open meeting,
people trying to enter El Centro
were asked whether they were
members of the press. Two men
blocked the door and prevented
reporters from attending, and a
sign on the door said the meeting
was "private" and "closed to
press."
The majority of the people at
the meeting were Chicano/Lati
no, but other ethnic groups were
represented. Community mem
bers argued that the gathering
was not open to all students.
El Centro staff member
Valentina del Olmo said that invi
tations for the meeting were
"supposed to go to students who
are active members of the com
munity. We classify that as peo
ple that are on the organizational
rosters of any of the organiza
tions that work out of El Centro
Chicano."
Organizers originally planned
a small gathering, and Rice said
she and Morales "agreed that it
should be a private meeting"
closed to the press. But they did
not alter that decision even after
the event grew to include any
interested students, administra
tors and alumni.
