# Theta Delts apply to regain old house
## 
### September Trevino Staff writer 
With more than 40 new pledges, the Theta
Delta Chi fraternity — which currently boasts
just four members — is well on its way to re
gaining its old residence at 675 Lomita.
Theta Delt President Cyd Zeigler met with
University officials yesterday morning to for

mally request the return of the house, now a
University self-operative. Zeigler said he used
the meeting to demonstrate the fraternity's
ability to fill and preserve a house.
"There's no question at this point. . . .
Nancy Howe said the University has every in
tention of giving us the house in the fall," Zei
gler said. He suggested that the fraternity will
work with the University to make the transi

tion as easy as possible.
"They have fulfilled all the conditions nec
essary," said Fraternal Affairs Advisor
Heather Dunn. "It's not final, [but] it looks as
though they will be able to return to 675 Lomi
ta." She added that future meetings will be
used to iron out details and verify that the fra-
ternity is ready to reclaim the
house.
In order to take back their
home, the Theta Delts needed a
minimum head count of 45, mem
bers and pledges combined, and
must demonstrate financial
health and strong connections
with the alumni community.
According to Diana Conklin,
acting co-director of Residential
Education, Zeigler submitted

signed pledge commitments from
42 members of the current pledge
class and a letter of support from
alumni.
However, Zeigler said the fra
ternity actually had 47 pledges.
The Theta Delts voluntarily
left 675 Lomita, which houses 51
students, in the spring of 1991 in
the midst of declining member
ship and the ensuing financial
responsibility of filling vacant
housing spots.
The University recommends
that less than 10 percent of spaces
in a fraternity house be filled
through boarders. At the time, the

University agreed that the Theta
Delts could reclaim their home at
any time within the next five
years.
However, in the winter of 1992,
the remaining members of the fra
ternity met with University offi
cials to set up a mechanism for the
fraternity's re-establishment.
The Theta Delts have redraft
ed a set of bylaws, developed a fra
ternal mission statement describ
ing the values and goals of their
fraternity, reestablished contact
with alumni and secured adequate
membership through Rush.
"We couldn't have done it with

out the alumni," Zeigler said. He
said they provided the necessary
guidance and financial support
essential to the fraternities
renewed aims.
"We are thrilled to get the
house back. Having a place where
we can all live will promote broth
erhood," said Zeigler
Zeigler already has his sights
set on the fall. The Theta Delts
hope to gain University permis
sion to renovate 675 Lomita and
to repaint its interior. He said the
fraternity members hope to main
tain some elements of the self-op
style, including the cook.
