### Emily Bazar Staff writer 
Former head of the Environmental Protection
Agency William K. Reilly explored the politics of en
vironmentalism in a speech yesterday, supporting
former President George Bush's claim to the title of
"the environmental president."
Reilly said Bush's reputation as an environmen
tally friendly president plummeted drastically be
cause of the international Rio Conference on the en
vironment in 1992.
"American viewers saw that their country was
stiffing the world in the most important environ
mental conference in history," said Reilly, attribut
ing these perceptions to negative media coverage.
At the conference, Bush had rejected the proposed
commitment to stabilize greenhouse gas emissions
and refused to sign the Convention on Biodiversity.
Reilly said that Bush's rejection of stabilizing gas
emissions was the only broken campaign promise re
lated to the environment. But he added that the po
litical consequences were drastic.
"The political fallout upset environmental groups
and the public who called into question President
Bush's ability to conduct foreign policy," said Reilly.
"Instead of projecting competence, we appeared out
of control."
Reilly said the conference
could have been a triumph for
Bush and the United States
because of Bush's prior achieve
ments in environmental policy,
which included the Clean Air Act
and a new wildlife refuge "every
third week."
He added that the administra
tion's policy achievements proved
that "Bush was the most effective
U.S. president on the environ
ment in history."
"George Bush cared about the
environment. He felt at home in
nature and the natural out
doors."
Reilly said that Bush's aspira
tion to be the environmental pres
ident was astute, both politically
and environmentally. Bush's
appeal to conservationism and
ecology was also an attempt to

court the vote of suburban, well
educated women who are also
concerned about abortion, he
said.
The Republican platform lost
some of these women to the abor
tion issue, but also catered to
their concern for environment,
attempting to earn their votes
this way.
But Reilly said that overall,
most progress on the environ
ment has been a result of bi-par
tisan cooperation. He also recog
nized American commitment
and concern for the environ
ment.
"Nature and natural parks are
to America what the cathedrals
are to Europe," Reilly said,
adding that these natural sys
tems can only thrive with unify
ing, bi-partisan politics.
Reilly's speech, held in Kresge
Auditorium, was the last of the
1993-94 Arthur and Frank Payne
Lectureship sponsored by the
Institute for International Stud
ies.
