Israel strives for peace
JERUSALEM (AP) — Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin, responding to a key
demand of Syria, said yesterday that to
achieve peace Israel was willing to uproot
Jewish settlements in the Golan Heights.
"For me, peace is a more important
value for the future of Israel's security
than one group of settlements or anoth
er," Rabin told leaders of Israel's kibbutz
movement, some of whom heckled him.
The statement, his most clear-cut on
the subject, comes in advance of Secre
tary of State Warren Christopher's visit
to the Middle East next week that is
expected to focus on breaking the Syria-
Israel impasse in negotiations.
Rabin's remarks dispelled some of the
doubts about his willingness to tackle the
sensitive Golan issue at a time when pub

lic support for peacemaking with the PLO
was sagging because of a series of suicide
bombings and attacks on Israeli civilians.
Nixon's health worsens
NEW YORK (AP) - Richard Nixon
fell into a deep coma yesterday, two days
after suffering a major stroke, and doc
tors said the former president's condition
appeared to be life-threatening.
Nixon's family was at his side as his
condition deteriorated, according to a
statement from New York Hospital.
The hospital gave no other details and
Nixon's doctors and aides declined to dis
cuss his treatment or condition in detail.
But other doctors said the coma sharply
reduced Nixon's chances of survival and
virtually guaranteed he would never recov
er his formidable powers of expression.
