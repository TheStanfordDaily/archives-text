SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina
(AP) — Bosnian Serbs bombarded
Gorazde yesterday in the heaviest assault
of their three-week offensive, killing
dozens and reducing a hospital ward to
"heaps of flesh and metal." There were
reports of house-to-house fighting as
Serb infantry entered the city.
Chinmaya Gharekhan, special politi
cal adviser to U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali, told The Associ
ated Press in New York that Serb
infantry entered Gorazde, but said he
would not characterize the city as hav
ing fallen. He said the Serbs earlier
moved tanks into Gorazde and then
withdrew them.
Bosnia's U.N. ambassador,
Muhamed Sacirbey, told the Security
Council he could confirm reports of
house-to-house fighting in Gorazde.

Doctors and town officials contacted
by ham radio called yesterday's bom
bardment the worst of the three-week
Serb offensive against the besieged
Muslim enclave.
Ohranovic said four wire-guided
rockets landed near a building that
houses U.N. aid workers and military
observers, killing or wounding 25 peo
ple. There was no word on whether
U.N. staff were hurt.
The Serb push against Gorazde, one
of six U.N.-declared "safe areas" in
Bosnia, has continued in defiance of
world condemnation, and even of their
own cease-fire agreements.
On Wednesday, President Clinton
urged NATO to "make the Serbs pay a
higher price" for continued carnage by
authorizing air strikes to protect civil
ians in Gorazde and the other safe

areas. He also called for a heavy
weapons pullback from around the
enclave and for tighter sanctions
against Serbia.
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan
Karadzic called Clinton's approach a
"fatal mistake" and said there would be
no more peace talks until all sanctions
against Serbia were lifted.
The deputy commander of Bosnian
Serb forces, Gen. Milan Gvero, warned
in a newspaper interview that the
"aggressor's personnel would not be
safe" if there were more air strikes, a
clear warning to U.N. military
observers in Serb-held territory.
Sen. Sam Nunn, chairman of the
Senate Armed Services Committee, said
"pinprick" air strikes may not be
enough, and the United States and its
allies "have to be willing to escalate."
