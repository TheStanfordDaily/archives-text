## Editorials Silencing the truth

WHEN SOMEONE breaks
the law, the arrest, trial
and decision are on the
public record. Any citizen, not just
the media, can gain access to the
names of those involved in a crim
inal or civil proceeding unless the
court seals records or institutes a
rarely used gag order.
Unfortunately, public access
changes when treading on universi
ty ground, and Stanford is no excep
tion. When someone breaks the
Honor Code, the "academic law" of
Stanford, the matter is entirely con
fidential.
A clear example of this is seen in
the recent revocation of a doctorate
for plagiarism. Facts of the case
were not discussed on the Faculty
Senate floor, and the name of the
offender was not released to the
public.
University judicial matters are
kept confidential for good reasons
when the process is still in motion.
There is no need to mark someone
for life by printing a story about a

person who has not yet been
proven guilty.
However, there is no clear justifi
cation for non-disclosure after a
decision has been handed down
against a student. If the student
was proven guilty, what protection
will secrecy offer that person? Any
employer or other university who
may be considering that person for
a position can call Stanford and find
out the degree has been revoked.
The Honor Code is often seen as a
hazy policy rarely put into action. Its
obscurity can be attributed partially
to the lack of reporting on it. It is
hard to understand how students
can be expected to obey the tenets of
a policy that they never see applied.
The name of the doctoral candi
date and facts of the case should be
disclosed immediately. The only
reason for secrecy at this point is to
save that person from shame.
But serious acts call for stringent
disciplinary measures. And disclo
sure could also help deter similar
acts in the future.
