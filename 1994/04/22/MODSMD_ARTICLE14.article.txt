GOING TO the library. Pump
ing iron at the new gym.
Taking a dip at deGuerre.
And oh yes, the fraternity parties.
Most students take these privileges
for granted since a quick flash of a
student identification card is all one
needs to gain admittance.
But those who are in their "grad
uation quarter" — students who
graduated after winter quarter but
stay on campus until graduation —
encounter a roadblock to these
seemingly simple privileges.
According to the Housing Center,
about 200 still live in campus hous
ing this quarter but are not regis
tered students. But these former
students are not issued ID cards
and therefore cannot use Stanford
facilities that are funded by student
tuition. Although they are techni
cally no longer Stanford students,
these individuals — the 200 on
campus and the ones who live off

campus — deserve the courtesy of
these few privileges during this
quarter of residence.
Most of these former students
have been members of the Stanford
community for at least a few years.
It is not too much to ask to let them
utilize these services they helped
fund for another 10 weeks.
Extending these privileges would
not burden the facilities concerned
by any means. The libraries would
not be feasibly hindered in their
mission or purpose if a fraction of
the graduated students used library
services.
Former students who choose to
remain on campus during spring
quarter usually do so because they
wish to graduate with their class.
Allowing former students to use
facilities such as the library, gym
and pool would certainly help their
final quarter at Stanford go more
swimmingly.
