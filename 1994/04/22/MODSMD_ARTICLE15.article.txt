## Natasha Deganello The
						many flags and faces of 'America' 
### 
WHAT WOULD we think if
France decided to take on the
name Europe for itself, and
only for itself? And when the people of
France said "Europeans" they expected
everyone to assume exclusively
"French." How about if Japan called
itself Asia or if Liberia appropriated the
name Africa?
Why then, is it perfectly normal in
this country to say America and auto
matically assume we are talking about
the United States? Why is it that the
U.S.A. is one of the only countries in
the world that doesn't lend itself to hav
ing a proper name for its citizens?
In Korea are the Koreans, in Nigeria
the Nigerians, in Venezuela the
Venezuelans. Of course Koreans consid
er themselves Asian but when they
speak of Asians they include their
neighboring dwellers of the continent.
The same goes for the Nigerians when
they speak of Africans.
What about the United States? Do
the United Statians live here? No, the
Americans do. That makes sense; after
all, the United States is in America.
But the people of Mexico are also
Americans, and so are those of Ecuador
and Peru and El Salvador, and Canada
and Trinidad and Tobago.
For some unclear reason, the United
States' rhetoric does not allow for this
continental right. I am confident that it
is not intentionally harmful. To the

contrary, the words come out as a mat
ter of habit, almost as if without any
thought.
How can it be that Stanford Univer
sity scholars continue to refer to Amer
ica day in and day out when they have
no intentions of including anything
other than the U.S.A.? This is particu
larly intriguing of a campus so indoctri
nated with the norms of political cor
rectness. This is a place where every
thing is he or she, his or her,
humankind instead of mankind. . . .
Don't get me wrong. This is not
about political correctness nor is it the
stand of a minority movement that feels
defensive. Most of the millions of the
people of America are not part of the
U.S.A.
Perhaps those who engage in this iso
lationist linguistic habit have neglected
the sandwiched two-letter preposition
between States and America. Namely
"of." Said word, in this case, denotes
"belonging to." Thus, referring to the
United States as contained, along with
many other countries, within a larger
body: America.
America, continent of frosted pines
and coconut palms; stroked by macaws
and bald eagles; bathed by the Magdale
na, the Titicaca, by tropical rains and
Andean winds, by the Pacific, the
Orinoco, the Atlantic, the Mississippi.
Guided by the heartbeat of Kingston,
Montreal, Barlovento, New Orleans,

Vina del Mar, Bahia synchronized to
the tune of cicadas, coquitos and to the
graceful splashing of pink dolphins.
America, home of the Tica, the
Yanomami, the black, the gaucho, the
cafe con leche, the Chilean, the Navajo,
the Puerto Rican, the white, the
Caraquena. America; living in pyramids
and palafitos, in skyscrapers and churu
atas, in igloos and A-frames and bohios.
America, whose flag is blue, yellow
and green, black, red, orange and white;
whose children's tongue is Quechua,
English, Portuguese, Piaroa, French,
Yiddish, Spanish.
America, land of eternal springtime,
breathtaking autumn, Patagonian win
ters, nightless summer days.
When we say America, whether it's
with our colleagues or friends, students
or teachers, parents or children, lets
refer to her in her entirety. Let's
remember the extent of her people, lan
guages, land, waters, histories, future.
Let's remember human beings outside
this country rightfully consider them
selves of America.
Above all, let's remember that only
with this kind of respect does intelligence
have the chance of becoming wisdom.

uate student in journalism, was born in

ican Students Association.
