## Challenge to Stanford speech code legitimate, overdue 
### 
ON TUESDAY The Daily reported
that junior Aman Veijee and
third-year law student Rob Corry
plan to file a lawsuit challenging the
validity of the Grey Interpretation of
Stanford's Fundamental Standard in
light of the 1992 California "Leonard
Law" requiring private educational insti
tutions to comply with the same stan
dards as public institutions when regu
lating student expression. Not only does
this lawsuit rest on sound First Amend
ment principles, but the students'
awareness of the "chilling effect" of
speech codes constitutes an accurate
response to anti-speech legislation.
I emphatically agree with speech code
proponents that hate speech is repulsive.
Particularly in an educational atmo
sphere, discriminatory speech strikes at
the heart of the diversity which
strengthens a university campus.
Nevertheless, a speech code repre
sents an inadequate and unconstitution
al response to the serious problems of
racial, religious, and sexual harassment.
In drafting the code, Stanford law pro
fessor Thomas Grey interprets the Fun
damental Standard to prohibit speech
that "makes use of insulting or 'fighting
words' or non-verbal symbols." Grey
defines fighting words as those words
"which by their very utterance inflict

injury or tend to incite an immediate
breach of the peace." Grey borrows this
definition from the 1942 U.S. Supreme
Court case Chaplinsky v. New Hamp
shire, a case that outlined the fighting
words exception to the First Amend
ment.
Since that case, however, the
Supreme Court has cut this two-pronged
definition in half. In University of Wis
consin Post v. Board of Regents of the
University of Wisconsin System, a feder
al district court struck down a campus
speech code remarkably similar to the
Grey Interpretation. In so doing, the
court cited Supreme Court precedent
and argued that "since Chaplinsky, the
Supreme Court has narrowed . . . the
scope of the fighting words doctrine. . . .
The Court has limited the fighting
words definition so that it now only
includes the second half."
In light of the Wisconsin case, Grey's
interpretation is inconsistent with mod
ern First Amendment law because it
restricts speech that now receives pro
tection under the Constitution. This
unconstitutional "overbreadth" caused
the speech codes at Wisconsin and the
University of Michigan to be struck
down in federal courts, and it has also
caused the repeal of speech codes at sev
eral universities nationwide.

In addition to violating the Constitu
tion (and thus the 1992 California law),
Stanford's code is bad policy. Propo
nents of speech codes argue that hate
speech should be punished because it
inflicts severe emotional harm on the
victim. While I agree that hate speech
causes harm, this does not constitute a
sufficient basis for restricting expres
sion. As Wayne State University Law
Prof. George Fishman argues, "many
other . . . hurtful remarks have the same
effect as hate speech. There are probably
students wandering every campus who
are in the process of being emotionally
destroyed through failed romances.
Should hateful speech between
boyfriends and girlfriends be banned? Of
course not."
Speech code advocates also argue that
hate speech impedes the victim's access
to the educational marketplace because
of its intimidating nature. First, this
argument patronizes minority groups by
ignoring their capacity to fight back and
respond to hate speech with speech of
their own. Second, if minorities actually
do avoid confrontations as a result of
hate speech, then nothing a person says
would ever result in a "fighting words"
type confrontation, rendering the Stan
ford code completely ineffectual (which
is probably why no one has ever been

punished under the Grey Interpretation,
or, for that matter, Cal's speech code).
Third, a speech code actually violates
equal protection more than it helps it by
singling out racist or sexist speech for
prohibition while not restricting insults
aimed at one's political beliefs, age, hair
color or height.
In an educational atmosphere free
discourse merits the highest protection.
Fishman worries about the chilling
effect on controversial views that caused
these two Stanford students to challenge
our speech code. While universities
ought to champion free speech, Stan
ford's speech code imposes censorship.
While Stanford ought to foster intellec
tual exploration, the speech code poisons
the educational environment with fear
of punishment.
Instead of seeking truth, Stanford
labels certain ideas taboo. Multicultural
education, through campus programs
like "Faces in the Community," dorm
programs, multicultural classes (maybe
even a distribution requirement that
actually helps us), and community ser
vice projects is the answer to racism and
sexism. Censorship is not. As former
Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis
argued, "repression breeds hate."

Fishman worries about the chilling
effect on controversial views that caused
these two Stanford students to challenge
our speech code. While universities
ought to champion free speech, Stan
ford's speech code imposes censorship.
While Stanford ought to foster intellec
tual exploration, the speech code poisons
the educational environment with fear
of punishment.
Instead of seeking truth, Stanford
labels certain ideas taboo. Multicultural
education, through campus programs
like "Faces in the Community," dorm
programs, multicultural classes (maybe
even a distribution requirement that
actually helps us), and community ser
vice projects is the answer to racism and
sexism. Censorship is not. As former
Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis
argued, "repression breeds hate."
