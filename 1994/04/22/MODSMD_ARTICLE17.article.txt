# Celebration of Jewish culture shouldn't only focus on state of Israel
## 
### 
It was troubling to read in Wednes
day's Daily that many of the exhibits in
the Jewish arts festival convey a message
"reflecting Zionism — the support of a
Jewish homeland in Israel." For me, as
for many other Jews, Judaism and our
Jewish heritage do not mean supporting
the state of Israel but trying to Live

according to values and teachings that go
back more than 4,000 years.
To us, Judaism is a way of looking at
God and our fellow human beings, with
reverence for both. At its best, to be Jew
ish means being rational, compassionate
and always a little skeptical. It also
means being burdened with a history not
only of persecution but of great courage
and endurance — a legacy that cannot be
borne lightly.
The state of Israel since its inception
has violated some of the most basic pre
cepts of Judaism. The "homeland" cele
brated in the current Jewish arts festival

is today the fourth-ranking military power
in the world. It holds territory seized by
force from the Palestinians, has expropri
ated most of their land and water, crippled
their economy, killed thousands of their
young people, and systematically tried to
destroy their culture and society.
How would we feel about a Chinese arts
festival that featured China's occupation of
Tibet? Or if a British arts festival focused
on the colonization of India? There is much
to celebrate in Jewish tradition and culture
without emphasizing the most recent and
shameful phase of our history.
