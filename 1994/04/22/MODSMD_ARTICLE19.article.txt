## Woe is me — faceplanting in the networking game 
### 
MY LIFE IS RUINED. My head
sank further into my hands as I
tried to remain calm and polite
and keep a good grip on the phone receiv
er. As I tried to stomach the death knell
coming through the devilish fiber-optic
lines. As I absorbed blow after blow to my
doubled-over ego, hoping tardiness in my
phone bill payments would cause
Forsythe miraculously to cut off my line.
"So, basically you're saying my future
in writing is bleak ..." I sighed, my lungs
collapsed under the weight of the soul
crushing advice wafting my way.
Take it like a man.
There I was, the idealistic youth —
acne-free and bloated with hope — the
world my oyster. There I was, looking for
advice from a well-schooled professional,
acorns of truth to stuff in my cheeks as I
set out to survey the world outside my
dorm room. There I was, begging for a few
morsels of wisdom and a soft pat on the
tuckus as I flew out of the nest, heading
East of Eden and into the big bad world.
Straight to hell.

The man on the other end of the line
asked why I had picked him, of all
humans on earth, to ask for advice. As a
professional writer, I perkily intoned, he
was a perfect choice for a few pointers to
guide me down the path of writerdom. He
was accomplished and established and I
needed all the help I could get.
So far, so good.
I had been calling people all quarter,
searching for a cure to my cluelessness.
Surprise-attacking adult after adult, ask
ing them their secrets, histories, sugges
tions. Everybody likes to help others, I
kept telling myself. People like to tell their
success stories, I chanted. And they'd all
been helpful. All been friendly. All turned
me a little closer to the right direction and
sent me on my way — a little wiser and a
little more self-assured.
That is, until the Howard the Duck of
career-plan bombs decimated the future
of your humble narrator. Me, slumped
over the edge of my chair, tsunamis of
panic devastating my tiny archipelagos of
self-confidence. Me, broken out in a

CPPC-esque fever, suddenly realizing that
even reception work would probably be
out of reach for a lowly history major such
as myself. Me, ready to jump off my loft
and out the window in an attempt to snuff
it before my pathetic future got a chance
to strangle me with two iron fists.
Poor, poor Alex.
"Have you ever had an internship?" he
asked as we started out on the road to
ruin, me still naively believing I was being
led closer and closer to enlightenment and
a cubicle in the carpeted office of a news
paper or magazine. "Nope," I explained.
"I've spent the last three summers
abroad, two doing research in Nicaragua."
"No internships, huh?" he said, a clap
of thunder causing his words to echo as
the skies darkened and I began to sense
the imminent flood of sour news. "Well,
that was your choice. Your options are
pretty limited now."
Checkmate.
I began to sweat more than is socially
acceptable in most circles. Began to envi
sion my life as a janitress, stewardess,

infomercial hostess. Began to invent dif
ferent pitchlines to convince this man I
had a call on call waiting and hang up.
Nowhere to run to, baby.
I was finished. Washed up. A worthless
writer's notebook and a measly collection
of disks, yearning to be free. Time to get
into real estate. Time to learn to sell vacu
um cleaners. Time to take the GRE and
apply to grad school.
I hadn't decided on my career path at
age 16, now sentenced to life as a prune
farmer for my sins. I hadn't carefully
manicured my resume. I had spent too
much time exploring different paths. I
hadn't spent every summer at Woodward
and Bernstein camp and now it was time
to wait for death so I could begin my next
life and get that one right.
This is the end.
He spent the next 15 minutes detailing
just how screwed I was. Just how badly I
had failed. Just how long and hard I
would have to struggle to get to where
most budding writers get when they are
starting to grow armpit hair. Just how

poor, unsuccessful and unhappy I would
be for the rest of my god-given days.
My quotes, not his.
And I finally got off the phone with
him. Finally freed myself of the shackles
of doom. Finally finished a call I would
end up paying actual money for. Finally
gasped a breath of air and tried to get rid
of the knot in my stomach.
I picked up the pile of articles I had sit
ting next to my computer. Flipped
through the stack that it turned out
would amount to a null set, a big bagel,
the granddaddy of all doughnuts.
But I couldn't give up. I turned to the
rest of the numbers, now potential slaps
in the face, and looked out the window.
Why didn't a friend of the family own a
newspaper? Why hadn't I taken the gilded
road to writing careerhood? Why had I
suddenly gone from 60 to zero in 4.5 sec
onds? Where was my fairy godmother
when I needed her?
Stop the presses.

onds? Where was my fairy godmother
when I needed her?
Stop the presses.

MY LIFE IS RUINED. My head
sank further into my hands as I
tried to remain calm and polite
and keep a good grip on the phone receiv
er. As I tried to stomach the death knell
coming through the devilish fiber-optic
lines. As I absorbed blow after blow to my
doubled-over ego, hoping tardiness in my
phone bill payments would cause
Forsythe miraculously to cut off my line.
"So, basically you're saying my future
in writing is bleak ..." I sighed, my lungs
collapsed under the weight of the soul
crushing advice wafting my way.
Take it like a man.
There I was, the idealistic youth —
acne-free and bloated with hope — the
world my oyster. There I was, looking for
advice from a well-schooled professional,
acorns of truth to stuff in my cheeks as I
set out to survey the world outside my
dorm room. There I was, begging for a few
morsels of wisdom and a soft pat on the
tuckus as I flew out of the nest, heading
East of Eden and into the big bad world.
Straight to hell.

The man on the other end of the line
asked why I had picked him, of all
humans on earth, to ask for advice. As a
professional writer, I perkily intoned, he
was a perfect choice for a few pointers to
guide me down the path of writerdom. He
was accomplished and established and I
needed all the help I could get.
So far, so good.
I had been calling people all quarter,
searching for a cure to my cluelessness.
Surprise-attacking adult after adult, ask
ing them their secrets, histories, sugges
tions. Everybody likes to help others, I
kept telling myself. People like to tell their
success stories, I chanted. And they'd all
been helpful. All been friendly. All turned
me a little closer to the right direction and
sent me on my way — a little wiser and a
little more self-assured.
That is, until the Howard the Duck of
career-plan bombs decimated the future
of your humble narrator. Me, slumped
over the edge of my chair, tsunamis of
panic devastating my tiny archipelagos of
self-confidence. Me, broken out in a

CPPC-esque fever, suddenly realizing that
even reception work would probably be
out of reach for a lowly history major such
as myself. Me, ready to jump off my loft
and out the window in an attempt to snuff
it before my pathetic future got a chance
to strangle me with two iron fists.
Poor, poor Alex.
"Have you ever had an internship?" he
asked as we started out on the road to
ruin, me still naively believing I was being
led closer and closer to enlightenment and
a cubicle in the carpeted office of a news
paper or magazine. "Nope," I explained.
"I've spent the last three summers
abroad, two doing research in Nicaragua."
"No internships, huh?" he said, a clap
of thunder causing his words to echo as
the skies darkened and I began to sense
the imminent flood of sour news. "Well,
that was your choice. Your options are
pretty limited now."
Checkmate.
I began to sweat more than is socially
acceptable in most circles. Began to envi
sion my life as a janitress, stewardess,

infomercial hostess. Began to invent dif
ferent pitchlines to convince this man I
had a call on call waiting and hang up.
Nowhere to run to, baby.
I was finished. Washed up. A worthless
writer's notebook and a measly collection
of disks, yearning to be free. Time to get
into real estate. Time to learn to sell vacu
um cleaners. Time to take the GRE and
apply to grad school.
I hadn't decided on my career path at
age 16, now sentenced to life as a prune
farmer for my sins. I hadn't carefully
manicured my resume. I had spent too
much time exploring different paths. I
hadn't spent every summer at Woodward
and Bernstein camp and now it was time
to wait for death so I could begin my next
life and get that one right.
This is the end.
He spent the next 15 minutes detailing
just how screwed I was. Just how badly I
had failed. Just how long and hard I
would have to struggle to get to where
most budding writers get when they are
starting to grow armpit hair. Just how

poor, unsuccessful and unhappy I would
be for the rest of my god-given days.
My quotes, not his.
And I finally got off the phone with
him. Finally freed myself of the shackles
of doom. Finally finished a call I would
end up paying actual money for. Finally
gasped a breath of air and tried to get rid
of the knot in my stomach.
I picked up the pile of articles I had sit
ting next to my computer. Flipped
through the stack that it turned out
would amount to a null set, a big bagel,
the granddaddy of all doughnuts.
But I couldn't give up. I turned to the
rest of the numbers, now potential slaps
in the face, and looked out the window.
Why didn't a friend of the family own a
newspaper? Why hadn't I taken the gilded
road to writing careerhood? Why had I
suddenly gone from 60 to zero in 4.5 sec
onds? Where was my fairy godmother
when I needed her?
Stop the presses.
