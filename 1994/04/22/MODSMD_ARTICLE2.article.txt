# Saldivar named dean of undergrad studies
## Will serve on full-time basis in new post 
### Scott Van Winkle Staff writer 
Ramon Saldivar, professor of English
and resident fellow in Roble, has been
named the new associate dean for under
graduate studies in the School of Humani
ties and Sciences, Dean John Shoven an
nounced yesterday.
Saldivar will become the first full-time
H&S dean whose sole responsibility is over
seeing undergraduate education. The new
post was created in February as part of a re
organization of the dean's office prompted
by the job changes of two current associate
deans.
The new position will expand the duties
presently performed by History Prof. A 1

Camarillo, whose term at the half-time
post of H&S associate dean and director of
undergraduate studies will end this sum
mer.
Saldivar, who will now have primary re
sponsibility for implementing the recom
mendations of the Commission on Under
graduate Education, stressed continuity in
outlining his goals.
"I'm tremendously excited," he said. "A 1
has done a tremendously wonderful job,
and he's actually the person who I've
shared my doubts with and gotten encour
agement from" in deciding to take the posi
tion.
Saldivar said he would try to expand the
sophomore seminar program,
which began during Camarillo's
tenure, to include juniors and
freshman.
"I hear from students that we
have too many large classes," he
said. "I agree that we should have
more opportunities for interaction
between undergraduates and fac
ulty."
Saldi'var, who is in his third year
at Stanford, teaches the enormous
ly popular 20th-century American
Literatures class which filled the
physics tank this quarter.
Exposure to "the real day-to
day life" of students as an RF,
Saldivar said, helped him feel com
fortable taking the position.
He expressed his hope to serve
as a "conduit" of understanding
between top administrators and

the Chicano/Latino community.
That role has become "more
important at this moment," he said,
because "there's the perception of a
need for it.... The channels of com
munication are there, but they
haven't been used as they might."
Citing his work as an RF and
director of the Chicano Fellows
program, which allows undergrad
uates and Ph.D. students to
explore Chicano studies, Shoven
praised Saldlvar as "a superb
scholar and an outstanding teach
er and adviser" in his speech.
Linguistics Prof. Thomas
Wasow, who chaired the faculty
committee which helped Shoven
select the new dean, said he had
heard "nothing but positives"
about Saldi'var.
Wasow said the committee and
Shoven picked Saldi'var from 25 to
30 names put forward by faculty
members.
Saldivar's responsibility for
undergraduate studies will be

shared with Assoc. Deans John
Etchemendy, Anne Peck and
David Siegmund, who are respon
sible for graduate and undergradu
ate matters in the humanities,
social sciences and sciences,
respectively.
Specifically, Saldfvar will over
see interdisciplinary programs, the
Cultures, Ideas and Values and
Writing and Critical Thinking pro
grams and Overseas Studies. H&S
Assoc. Dean Russell Berman's
position will be eliminated, as
Berman will become full-time
director of Overseas Studies.
Saldfvar seemed to jump right
into his new role, regretting only
that he would no longer be able to
serve as an RF. Following the
speech, Shoven conversed with
Saldfvar over the need for "subjec
tive" methods of evaluating teach
ing, and the new dean began by sug
gesting exit interviews with gradu
ating seniors as a way to gauge
teachers' impact on students.
