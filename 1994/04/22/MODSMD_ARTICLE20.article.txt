## Gymnastics to shoot for third NCAA title 
### Sam Wu Staff writer 
"No step on my last dismount."
That's how senior tri-captain Chris Sey
would like to end his career when the two
time defending national champion Stanford
men's gymnastics team attempts to threep
eat at the NCAA Championships in Lincoln,
Neb. today and tomorrow.
The perfection Sey seeks may be the only
way for Stanford to prevail, as the Cardinal
must overcome the top-ranked Corn
huskers in their own back yard in addition
to top-10 teams Ohio State, Oklahoma,
Penn State and lowa.
"We just have to make the top three
[today] to make it to the finals on Satur
day," Hamada said. "We can have a few
missed routines here and there. But on Sat
urday, we must hit everything."
Fortunately for the Cardinal, over the
past two weeks, the team has accomplished
the three feats Hamada deemed necessary
for securing another national crown.
First and foremost, according to the
coach, Stanford has improved its consisten
cy. In last Friday's intra-squad competition,
Cardinal gymnasts missed only five rou
tines. Just two weeks ago, they committed
10 misses at the NCAA Western Regional
Championships.
Second, Stanford has refined routines of
greater difficulty on vault and rings, two
areas in which the Cardinal has traditional
ly struggled.

As a team Stanford can now vault to
scores of 9.80 or better. Last weekend's
intra-squad event saw senior tri-captain
Mark Booth, junior tri-captain Josh Stein
and freshmen Keith Wiley and lan
Bachrach all earn scores of 9.80 or higher
on the apparatus. Before last Friday, the
Cardinal mustered only two vaults of such
caliber over the entire course of the season.
Meanwhile, Stein, Booth and Sey have
increased the difficulty levels on their ring
routines by .2 points and have performed
their new maneuvers successfully.
"I personally believe this team is the
most talented team I ve competed with,
Sey said. "With the frosh for example, when
I came back this year, 1 saw them throw the
most outrageous tricks — they were tum
bling out of their socks. "
Lastly, Stanford gymnasts are sticking
more of their dismounts. Extra steps and
wobbles upon landing have been of particu
lar concern for the Cardinal, as these small
lapses in execution can drop a 9.90 or 10.0
routine to a 9.80 or worse.
"Hitting the landing is like shooting a
three-pointer in basketball," Hamada said.
"On a given day, you have to be right on. If
you hit the rim, you bounce off. You just
have to keep trying to make sure you'll be
on."
Additional good news for Stanford comes
in the form of junior all-around phenom
Jing-Wei Liang. Due to back pains, Liang

Junior Jing-Wei Liang performs a routine on the pommel horse earlier this year. Two-time national champion Stanford will
try to make it three this weekend at the NCAA Championships in Lincoln, Neb.
