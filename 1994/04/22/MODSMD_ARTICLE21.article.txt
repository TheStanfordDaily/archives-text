# Hurlers aim for Six-Pac boosting

"And they're coming down
the home stretch ..."
For the No. 9 Cardinal base
ball team, the outcome of the
Pacific 10 Conference Southern
Division horse race could hinge
on the fact that six of its nine
remaining Six-Pac games,
including this weekend's series
with the Arizona Wildcats, will
be played at Sunken Diamond.
Trailing first-place USC by a
scant one-half game, Stanford
(27-16, 14-7 in the Six-Pac)
remains ahead of the Trojans in
the loss column with three games
in hand, making these three con
tests with the woeful Wildcats (9-
32, 5-16) crucial to the Cardinal's
crown aspirations.
Stanford took two of the
teams' first three meetings last
month in Tucson, Ariz., and
needs at least a pair of victories
this weekend to maintain pres
sure on USC, which squares off
with archrival UCLA in the Tro
jans' second-to-last Six-Pac set.
The Cardinal has won nine of
its last 12 conference games and
could easily stay hot with a
sweep this weekend. But head
coach Mark Marquess uses a
recent example to warn of over
looking Arizona, which grabbed
its first series win of the year last
weekend, taking two of three
from the Bruins.
"It's tough to sweep anyone.
Like our last game against Cal
(last weekend), even if you have
a team's number they can win
one from you," Marquess said.
Despite Marquess' stoicism
and Arizona's moderate success
last weekend, the Wildcats still
play a poor imitation of Stan
ford's brand of baseball. Arizona

mimics the Cardinal's reliance
on pitching and defense, but does
so far less successfully.
For example, while the squads'
batting averages bear a striking
resemblance (.278 for the Wild
cats to .281 for Stanford), Ari
zona's pitching staff (6.99 earned
run average) gives up over three
runs per game more than the
Cardinal (3.77 ERA). The discrep
ancy widens when considering
the Wildcats' defense, which has
tagged its share of unearned runs
on the pitching staff by commit
ting 91 errors in 41 games.
Yet Arizona's starting trio of
Steve Arffa (1-5), Ben White (2-6)
and Ryan Frace (1-4) remains the
greatest obstacle to Stanford.
"They are capable of beating
us, but the key for us is to score
runs, because when we do, we
present problems for them,"
Marquess said.
Those problems originate
mostly from Stanford's three
scheduled starters — sophomore
Dan Reed (8-2), sophomore Todd
Bartels (4-2) and freshman
Jason Middlebrook (5-1) — who
have combined for a 17-5 record
and a 3.08 ERA.
"We've pitched well this sea
son, which makes up for the fact
that we don't normally score a
lot of runs," Marquess said.
Luckily, while the Cardinal
averages a sub-par 6.3 runs per
game, Arizona averages just 4.9,
in addition to a conference-low
eight home runs all season.
So, offense, defense and pitch
ing — Stanford appears to have
all the bases covered, so to speak.
Right, Coach Marquess?
"It's difficult for me to predict
what will happen. [The Wildcats]
concern me even without an
impressive record," Marquess
said.
