# Men's golf to tee off in U.S. Intercollegiate
## 
### Andrew Blachman Staff writer 
Sunny skies with highs in the
mid to upper 60s.
The Stanford men's golf team
couldn't have asked for a better
forecast for its return home.
After stumbling to a lOth-place
finish in the heat-plagued Thun
derbird Invitational in Tempe,
Ariz, last weekend, No. 2-ranked
Cardinal will seek to regain its
composure at the Stanford Golf
Course tomorrow and Sunday in
the U.S. Intercollegiates.
Hampered by 97-degree weath
er, the Cardinal fell 39 strokes shy
of tournament winner Arizona
State last weekend. The top
ranked Sun Devils head the field of
18 teams competing this weekend,
which marks the Cardinal's final

home appearance of the year.
"It was a good learning experi
ence for us [last weekend]," said
coach Wally Goodwin. "We're
going to have to get tougher as a
team and right now we're just
happy to be playing at home."
The Stanford squad had placed
no worse than second in its four
tournaments prior to the Thunder
bird Invitational to gain its current
No. 2 national ranking.
In the midst of its strongest sea
son in school history, the Cardinal
has already captured four tourna
ment titles. Stanford won the
William Tucker Invitational in the
fall, followed by back-to-back titles
at the Pacific Coast Champi
onships and Southwestern Invita
tional in March. The Cardinal also
took the team title at its only other
home tournament of the year, the
Stanford Shootout in October.
"This tournament is a lot big
ger than the Shootout," said fresh
man Conrad Ray. "There's a lot of
tough teams coming here and it
should be a challenge."
This weekend's U.S. Intercolle
giate will also serve as the Cardi
nal's last tune up before heading
into the Pacific 10 Conference
Championships and the NCAA
Regionals. Both tournaments will
be held in Tucson, Ariz, in May,
followed by the NCAA finals in
Dallas, Texas in June. The Inter
collegiate tournament could play a
key role in focusing Stanford
towards an NCAA championship.
"This tournament is a good
opportunity for us to get back in
it," said junior Steve Burdick. "We
should be the favorites to win and
that's exactly what we want to
do."
Burdick, who has improved
steadily throughout the season,
will play in the No. 2 position for
the team, behind junior Casey
Martin. Senior Brad Lanning will
compete out of No. 3, followed by
juniors Notah Begay 111 and
William Yanigisawa. Ray and
junior Darren Dragovich will com
pete for No. 6 position and a trip to
the Pac-10 Championships.
The tournament begins on the
par 71, 6,786-yard course with 36
holes on Saturday and an addi
tional 18 on Sunday. Both days
have scheduled tee-off times of 8
a.m.

mid to upper 60s.
