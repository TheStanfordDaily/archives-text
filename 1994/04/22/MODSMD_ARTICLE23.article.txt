# Track gears up for Cal competition

"Practice makes perfect."
While the saying may be
overused, not to mention corny, it
certainly applies to the Stanford
track and field team.
Last weekend, both the men's
and women's squads traveled to the
Mt. San Antonio College Invitation
al, racking up many satisfying
times on their personal record
books as well as the experience of
competition against some of the
West Coast's finest athletes.
"Mt. SAC was a fantastic oppor
tunity for many of our athletes to
get a taste of top national caliber
competition," said head coach Vin
Lannana. "And by competing
[against] the best, many of our ath

letes had a great weekend trip high
lighted by many great marks."
One of those exceptional show
ings came from senior hammer
thrower Debbie Templeton, who
woke up the crowd with a current
national best throw of 178 feet and
3 inches. This mark also won a
place in the national record books
as the fourth best throw ever in col
legiate competitions.
"I felt good when I let that big
one go," Templeton said. "I was a
little bit frustrated since I could
have corrected some of my mis
takes on that throw to have made it
even better."
Templeton is gearing up for the
open nationals to be held this sum
mer in Knoxville, Tenn. since her
event is not displayed in the NCAA
Championships.

While Templeton was letting her
hammer fly, on the men's side,
junior co-captain Dave Popejoy
placed second on the same event
with a landing of 220' 8". Fresh
man Pete Swanson also garnered a
red ribbon with a 57' 3" toss in the
shot-put, edging many of UCLA's
top throwers.
Other highlights came from
sophomore All-American Rene
Rodriguez with a 46.48-second fin
ish in the 400 meters for a third
place crossing. Another on-track
highlight came from freshman J. J.
White, who was six seconds shy of
the freshman school record in the
5,000 meters with a clocking of
14:28.0.
"My performance was really sat
isfactory considering that this is my
first time running the 5 K." White

said. "But there is a lot of room for
improvement and hopefully I will
be able to drop that freshman
record soon."
While most of the Cardinal
squad spent the weekend in south
ern California, the multi-event ath
letes traveled to Sacramento City
College to compete in the
decathlon. Junior Travis Clark
earned the most points in the event
with a somewhat unexpected 6,990.
"Travis did a very good job in
responding to the unknown like a
swimmer being thrown into the
ocean, since he hasn't competed in
many of the events ever," said
assistant coach Mark Reiff.
While the Pacific 10 Conference
decathlon championships — to be
held on May 14-15 at Washington
State — will only be Clark's second
outing in the event, his prospects
look bright based on this weekend's
performance.
"If Travis keeps on responding
well he will be sitting at the thick of
the Pac-10 championships having a
great chance of taking the crown,"
Reiff said.
The next stop will be on rival
turf as the team travels to Califor
nia Saturday, where the Cardinal

will face another day of tough com
petition against Cal, USC and Col
orado. As some of the men's team
will miss the meet due to MCAT
testing, the remaining throwers
and runners will be called upon to
fill these places.
"This weekend we are taking a
very skeletal men's and a very rep
resentative women's team to
Memorial Stadium at Cal," Lan
nana said. "Many athletes will be
competing in events where they
don't usually compete in but they
will be able to get a taste of a good
meet and a preview of the upcom
ing Big Meet also at Cal in early
May."
