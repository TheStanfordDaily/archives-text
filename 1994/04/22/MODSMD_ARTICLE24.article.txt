# Maples-style showdown
## Cardinal guns for UCLA in MPSF tourney 
### Kathryn Yang Senior staff writer 
Volleyball fans will be in for a
treat this weekend, as eight of the
nation's top teams invade Maples
Pavilion for the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation Tournament. At
stake during this three-day event
will be both an automatic and a
wild-card bid to the NCAA Final
Four in early May.
By virtue of first-place finishes
in their respective divisions, No. 1
UCLA and No. 2 Stanford will pro
vide the marquee matchup in the
championship match on Saturday
at 7 p.m.
The winner of that match will
receive an automatic entry into the
Final Four, while the loser will re
enter the wild-card playoffs as a
semi-finalist. First-round action in
the wild-card playoffs also begins on
Saturday, with the semi-finals slat
ed for Monday and the finals sched
uled to take place Tuesday night.
For the Cardinal, Saturday
night's contest against the Bruins
will be a rematch of last year's
championship round, where Stan
ford bowed out to the Bruins in a
tough four-game match. Earlier
this season, Stanford also suc
cumbed to the Bruins' top-ranked
volleyball game at home in a 15-12,
15-11, 15-6 fight.
At this point, the odds-makers
are probably betting the bank on
the Bruins; however, the Cardinal
team can point to quite a few fac
tors which favor an upset.
"Right now I see Stanford as the
only team which can compare to
UCLA in sheer athleticism," said
senior setter and last year's
National Player of the Year
Canyon Ceman. "But in order to
win, we have to be consistent and
play to our potential."
Playing to the Cardinal's full
potential means realizing the All-
American talents of rookies like
freshman opposite hitter Matt
Fuerbringer. As Stanford's offen
sive centerpiece, Fuerbringer is
second in the nation with a 7.10
kills per game average and 646
total kills on the season — good for
the second-best single-season
mark in Stanford history.

Sophomore swing hitter Mike
Lambert, the prize of his recruiting
class two years ago, has also pow
ered the Stanford attack this sea
son by swinging for 608 kills and a
.320 hitting percentage.
Then at middle blocker, Stan
ford starts a true freshman in
Michael Hoefer, who has per
formed like a veteran All-American
all season long. Besides hitting a
cool .485 (fifth in the nation), Hoe
fer has added a much needed
dimension to the Cardinal rotation
— defense and blocking. The 6-
foot-7 native of Goleta, Calif, set a
school record in just his first sea
son on the Farm with 139 blocks
this year.
Then, of course, there is the
maestro who effortlessly orches
trates the Stanford offense from
his setting position. Finishing his
fourth season as a starter on the
Cardinal squad, Ceman ranks his
troops along with and sometimes
above the Bruins' All-American
cast.
When asked how Stanford
stacks up against the Bruins in
each position, Ceman replied, "I
think I'm better than their setter,
Lambert is better than their swing
hitters and I'd take Hoefer over
[Paul] Nihipali any day."
Not that the Bruins will come to
Maples as the Bad News Bears of
volleyball on Saturday or anything.
In fact, UCLA has dominated the
collegiate courts in 1994 with
opposite hitter Jeff Nygaard man
ning most of the spiking duties on
offense.
As a candidate for National
Player of the Year honors this sea
son, there have even been talks of
penciling Nygaard in for the 1996
Olympics, even though he has two
year's eligibility left. The 6-foot-8
junior already has several matches
of U.S. National team experience
under his belt, and he presently
leads the UCLA attack with 571
kills (7.0 per game, third in the
nation) and a .407 hitting percent
age.
Overall, the Bruins racked up a
.374 hitting average this year —
outdistancing the Cardinal by five

percentage points.
"No doubt about it, UCLA is a
great team with tremendous tal
ent," said Stanford head coach
Ruben Nieves.
Beyond the Nygaard express
lies a freshman middle blocker who
is comparable in talent to Stan
ford's own Hoefer. One of UCLA's
top recruits last season, Nihipali
has provided the Bruins with a
solid 1.5 blocks per game, in addi
tion to swinging for a .427 average.

The Yorba Linda, Calif, native is
joined by another quick hitter up
the middle in 6-foot-9 senior Tim
Kelly. Kelly's .502 hitting percent
age ranks him third in the nation.
Stopping the red-hot Bruins will
be a tall order for the Cardinal this
weekend, however Stanford is up
to the task, especially after clinch
ing the division title and ending the
season on an upswing.
"There's really no pressure for
us to beat UCLA on Saturday,"
Ceman said. "And I think we're in
a good position to win it right
now."
However, in order to accomplish
that, the Cardinal will have to stay

in the game and wear away at the
Bruins until they crack.
"We've got to stay with UCLA,"
Nieves emphasized. "If we take
them to either four or five games,
our chances of winning improves
dramatically."
Thus far, Ceman has described
Stanford's season as a bull market
— with obvious declines and
upswings all averaging out to a
general gain in Cardinal stocks.
However, both teams have to
remain on their toes this weekend,
because sports, just like real-life
economics, also draws upon luck
and momentum in addition to pure
talent.

Canyon Ceman. "But in order to
win, we have to be consistent and
play to our potential."
Playing to the Cardinal's full
potential means realizing the All-
American talents of rookies like
freshman opposite hitter Matt
Fuerbringer. As Stanford's offen
sive centerpiece, Fuerbringer is
second in the nation with a 7.10
kills per game average and 646
total kills on the season — good for
the second-best single-season
mark in Stanford history.

Sophomore swing hitter Mike
Lambert, the prize of his recruiting
class two years ago, has also pow
ered the Stanford attack this sea
son by swinging for 608 kills and a
.320 hitting percentage.
Then at middle blocker, Stan
ford starts a true freshman in
Michael Hoefer, who has per
formed like a veteran All-American
all season long. Besides hitting a
cool .485 (fifth in the nation), Hoe
fer has added a much needed
dimension to the Cardinal rotation
— defense and blocking. The 6-
foot-7 native of Goleta, Calif, set a
school record in just his first sea
son on the Farm with 139 blocks
this year.
Then, of course, there is the
maestro who effortlessly orches
trates the Stanford offense from
his setting position. Finishing his
fourth season as a starter on the
Cardinal squad, Ceman ranks his
troops along with and sometimes
above the Bruins' All-American
cast.
When asked how Stanford
stacks up against the Bruins in
each position, Ceman replied, "I
think I'm better than their setter,
Lambert is better than their swing
hitters and I'd take Hoefer over
[Paul] Nihipali any day."
Not that the Bruins will come to
Maples as the Bad News Bears of
volleyball on Saturday or anything.
In fact, UCLA has dominated the
collegiate courts in 1994 with
opposite hitter Jeff Nygaard man
ning most of the spiking duties on
offense.
As a candidate for National
Player of the Year honors this sea
son, there have even been talks of
penciling Nygaard in for the 1996
Olympics, even though he has two
year's eligibility left. The 6-foot-8
junior already has several matches
of U.S. National team experience
under his belt, and he presently
leads the UCLA attack with 571
kills (7.0 per game, third in the
nation) and a .407 hitting percent
age.
Overall, the Bruins racked up a
.374 hitting average this year —
outdistancing the Cardinal by five

percentage points.
"No doubt about it, UCLA is a
great team with tremendous tal
ent," said Stanford head coach
Ruben Nieves.
Beyond the Nygaard express
lies a freshman middle blocker who
is comparable in talent to Stan
ford's own Hoefer. One of UCLA's
top recruits last season, Nihipali
has provided the Bruins with a
solid 1.5 blocks per game, in addi
tion to swinging for a .427 average.

The Yorba Linda, Calif, native is
joined by another quick hitter up
the middle in 6-foot-9 senior Tim
Kelly. Kelly's .502 hitting percent
age ranks him third in the nation.
Stopping the red-hot Bruins will
be a tall order for the Cardinal this
weekend, however Stanford is up
to the task, especially after clinch
ing the division title and ending the
season on an upswing.
"There's really no pressure for
us to beat UCLA on Saturday,"
Ceman said. "And I think we're in
a good position to win it right
now."
However, in order to accomplish
that, the Cardinal will have to stay

in the game and wear away at the
Bruins until they crack.
"We've got to stay with UCLA,"
Nieves emphasized. "If we take
them to either four or five games,
our chances of winning improves
dramatically."
Thus far, Ceman has described
Stanford's season as a bull market
— with obvious declines and
upswings all averaging out to a
general gain in Cardinal stocks.
However, both teams have to
remain on their toes this weekend,
because sports, just like real-life
economics, also draws upon luck
and momentum in addition to pure
talent.
Volleyball fans will be in for a
treat this weekend, as eight of the
nation's top teams invade Maples
Pavilion for the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation Tournament. At
stake during this three-day event
will be both an automatic and a
wild-card bid to the NCAA Final
Four in early May.
By virtue of first-place finishes
in their respective divisions, No. 1
UCLA and No. 2 Stanford will pro
vide the marquee matchup in the
championship match on Saturday
at 7 p.m.
The winner of that match will
receive an automatic entry into the
Final Four, while the loser will re
enter the wild-card playoffs as a
semi-finalist. First-round action in
the wild-card playoffs also begins on
Saturday, with the semi-finals slat
ed for Monday and the finals sched
uled to take place Tuesday night.
For the Cardinal, Saturday
night's contest against the Bruins
will be a rematch of last year's
championship round, where Stan
ford bowed out to the Bruins in a
tough four-game match. Earlier
this season, Stanford also suc
cumbed to the Bruins' top-ranked
volleyball game at home in a 15-12,
15-11, 15-6 fight.
At this point, the odds-makers
are probably betting the bank on
the Bruins; however, the Cardinal
team can point to quite a few fac
tors which favor an upset.
"Right now I see Stanford as the
only team which can compare to
UCLA in sheer athleticism," said
senior setter and last year's
National Player of the Year
Canyon Ceman. "But in order to
win, we have to be consistent and
play to our potential."
Playing to the Cardinal's full
potential means realizing the All-
