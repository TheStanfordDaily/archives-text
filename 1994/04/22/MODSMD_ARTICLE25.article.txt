# Softball hopes for home field win
## 
### Randy Reback Staff writer 
I here s no place like home, or so the Cardi
nal hopes.
Tomorrow, the Stanford softball team will
try to use a rare home field advantage when it
hosts St. Mary s (21-29-1) for a doubleheader.
This season the squad's home turf has vir
tuallybeen reduced to a practice field. The
Cardinal (4-27) has played only six games at
El Camino Park, which is located on El
Camino Real opposite the Stanford Shopping
Center.
One reason for the low number of home
games this year is that the Cardinal is not com
peting in a conference. After participating in the
Pacific 10 Conference last year, the team was
granted a one-year exemption due to the low
number of players on the roster last fall. Since it
does not host division games, the Cardinal has
seen most of this season's action during tourna
ments and weekend road trips.

The less-than-perfect conditions of its field is
another reason the Cardinal rarely hosts games
at El Camino Park, which is maintained by the
Palo Alto Recreation Department. Two of the
Cardinal's home games have been canceled or
postponed due to wetness from rain on the pre
vious day.
"Our field has no drainage and it's not the
best playing surface," said head coach Sandy
Pearce. "We will have a new field somewhere on
campus next season. Right now we're trying to
find a site with the right dimensions."
For the Stanford players, the homestand will
provide a chance to improve their season record
against St. Mary's, who shut out the Cardinal
twice during a tournament in San Jose at the
beginning of the season. When the teams last
met on April 12, the Cardinal offense surprised
the Gaels by knocking out 22 hits as the squads
split a doubleheader.
"They're not going to take us lightly like they
did before," said sophomore Lynn Anderson,
Stanford's captain.

St. Mail's, coming ofT a 2-0 loss to California
Wednesday, has had to fight the flu bug recent
ly. Starting pitcher Cindy Waterman may not be
healthy enough to take the mound. If Water
man is sidelined, Kristi Delplain, who has also
been playing with a cold, will start both games
on Saturday.
"Despite some health problems, our pitching
and defense has been doing an excellent job
recently," said St. Mary's assistant coach Mark
Moyer, whose team is among the top 15 Division
I teams in the nation in fielding percentage.
"Stanford was hitting the ball a lot better the
second time we played them. We're expecting
that they'll get a few more hits than last time,
which means that we can't take as many risks in
the field," he said.
Stanford hopes that its offense will indeed
pick up, after collecting only 22 hits during its
last four games.
"We're excited to play St. Mary's," said
Pearce. "They have been playing well lately, but
we've proven that we can beat them."
