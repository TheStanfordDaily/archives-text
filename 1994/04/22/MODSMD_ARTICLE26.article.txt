# Goalies play key role for lacrosse

The Stanford women's la
crosse team began the season
with a goal, two players and one
coach to help protect it during the
team's quest for the Final Four.
As the end of this search
nears, the Cardinal will need its
defense to be at the top of its
game starting tomorrow, when
Stanford travels to St. Mary's for
the Northern California Qualify
ing Tournament. The outcome of
this tournament determines who
moves on to the Final Four the
following weekend.
Throughout the season,
defense has been one of the keys
to the Cardinal's (8-1) game.
The credit, according to Stan
ford's defensive players, goes to
the goaltenders and Kay Cow
perthwait's direction.
One of the few coaches on the
West Coast who concentrates on
the goalie position, Cowperth
wait has worked hard on mak
ing the Stanford goalies junior
Emily Chang and freshman
Hadley Abernathy who they are.
"The goalies are often over
looked on the field," Cowperth
wait said. "When I First started
coaching last year, I forgot
about them myself."
In her attempts to correct
this problem, Cowperthwait has
often taken the goalies off to the
side and worked with them
teaching everything that she
knows. She has focused her
efforts on refining the players'
styles in goal and training them
to be mentally tough, traits
which Cowperthwait believes
are very important in the com
position of great goalkeepers.
Cowperthwait, however,

believes the goalies should get
most of the credit themselves.
"I am really lucky," she said.
"The goalies have worked hard
and wanted to get better, they
keep plucking information from
me."
Chang and Abernathy have
been splitting time in the goal
this year, an arrangement
which some might think would
result in friction between the
two goalies. But it is actually
quite the opposite â€” the two
look to each other for support.
"We have a great relationship
between us, she'll cheer for me
and help me out during games
pointing out various things,"
Chang said. "We both feel for
each other and have these inside
goalie jokes."
Cowperthwait agrees that
there is a great relationship
between the goalies and also
pointed out their contrasting
styles, which help each appreci
ate the other. After a season of
training, the coaches feel the
goalies are peaking at the right
time.
"Hadley finally showed what
she could do last weekend
against Santa Barbara," said
coach Cecelia Paglia, referring
to Abernathy's performance in
which she allowed only one UC-
Santa Barbara shot past her.
This weekend Stanford will
be the favored team in the tour
nament, despite the loss of
senior co-captain Kate Apple
white due to a shoulder injury.
With utmost confidence in
the training and strength of the
goalies, the Cardinal should be
in good shape to achieve its sea
son-long quest for the Final
Four title.
