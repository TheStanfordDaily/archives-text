# Stanford's Earth Day to address international environmental issues
## 
### 
Approaches to solving international environmen
tal issues will be the theme of Stanford Earth Day
'94, to be held tomorrow at Wilbur Field.
The all-day event, titled "Think Globally," will
feature an address by Philip Berry, former president
of the Sierra Club, as well as speeches by officials
from environmental organizations Bay Area Action,
the Rainforest Action Network and the Internation
al Rivers Network.
Senior Justin Pollard, the event coordinator, said
Berry's speech will focus on efforts to preserve the
endangered tiger. Other speakers will discuss issues
such as "oil exploitation in Equador."
"This year's program is about realizing the
importance of our individual actions and their effect

on the international environment," he said.
Pollard said he expects 1,000-2,000 people to
attend the event. He said the Wilbur location was
selected because "it is in the center of a lot of dorms
and is accessible to the rest of the campus."
"We're hoping to reach as much of the campus as
possible to educate about the importance of environ
mental issues," he said.
The event will also include live music, food ven
dors and informational booths from various non
profit environmental groups.
"Think Globally" is sponsored by the Students
for Environmental Action at Stanford. The event is
free and open to the public and will run from 11 a.m.
to 5 p.m.
