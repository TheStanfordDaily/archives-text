# Shoven: H&S to remain strong despite cutbacks
## 
### Scott Van Winkle Staff writer 
Attempting to defeat fears that the Uni
versity is losing its academic edge in an era
of pinpoint accounting, Dean of the School
of Humanities and Sciences John Shoven
trumpeted his school's accomplishments
and its readiness for the future at his first
annual "State of the School" address yes
terday.
As part of its "faculty renewal" effort,
Shoven said the Board of Trustees has de
cided on a faculty retirement-incentive
program which would be formally an
nounced "in a few days."
The incentives will consist of a "supple
mental payment" to professors between
the ages of 60 and 70 who announce their
retirement a year in advance, he said.
Those who announce their retirement at
the introduction of the plan, he said, would
receive additional incentives as part of the
program's "grand opening sale."
Shoven stressed the importance of the
scheme in bringing in new talent, but hir
ing younger faculty at lower salaries will
also likely result in significant cost-savings
for the school.
"There is every reason to believe that

this new faculty benefit will prove to be in
the interests of both the faculty and the
University," he said.
"We must make sure that Stanford de

ars," he said. "We do this through
our mentoring of undergraduates
and graduate students, but we
also must make sure that this is
absolutely the best university in
the world in which to start an
academic career as an assistant
professor."
The audience of about 150 fac
ulty and staff members reacted
with an awed "Ooh" to Shoven's
announcement of a new program
in the Art Department to study
American made objects and the
cultures which produce them,
funded by an "extraordinarily
generous and deeply anonymous"
grant.
The grant, which will allow the
department to hire a new assis
tant professor and a visiting dis
tinguished scholar and to admit
two new Ph.D. students in each of
the next four years, appeared to
spark some jealousy among audi
ence members.
Shoven said the new program
will "significantly strengthen
American visual studies at Stan
ford and will have far-reaching
benefits for the school's graduate
and undergraduate programs."
English Dept. Chair Ron Reb
holz, who called the new funding
a "great grant," was quick to
question Shoven at the end of his
speech, asking him if he "wor
ried" about the lack of funding
for lecturers, which may force the
University to increase class sizes
in the Cultures, Ideas and Values
and Writing and Critical Think

ing programs next year.
As part of an effort to trim $18
million to $20 million from the
University's budget over the next
three years, Provost Condoleezza
Rice had proposed no salary
increase next year for lecturers,
who lead most CIV and freshman
English sections.
But the school decided to give
"market-rate raises" to lecturers,
Shoven said, which means that
"something's got to give." As a
result, one CIV lecturer position
will be eliminated next year.
Shoven did not mention the
decision in his speech, which
summarized changes throughout
the University's largest school.
The school conducts about 80
percent of teaching at the Univer
sity.
Shoven praised the school's
financial situation as "very solid,"
stressing the restructuring which
has eliminated the school's deficit
over the last five years and given
the dean more flexibility in
assigning faculty positions, or bil
lets.
He cited the Irvine Multicul
tural Curriculum Development
grant, which has funded 20 new
undergraduate courses and sup
ported 18 existing ones, as an
example of this financial stability.
Shoven also announced a new
endowed visiting professorship at
the Stanford in Washington cam
pus, which will allow a Stanford
professor to teach there for one
quarter each year.
Shoven stressed the need for
the school and its departments to
work more closely with the Office
of Development to raise new
funds, possibly focusing on the

University's location in the Sili
con Valley to improve the "fund
ability" of the school.
Beyond finances, Shoven
offered updates on changes in
how the school carries out its aca
demic mission.
Shoven said the eight to 10 fac
ulty billets which the dean's office
controls as a result of cuts to
departmental billets will be used
to hire younger faculty.
Also, Shoven said the school
will favor junior faculty when dol
ing out raises this year.
Improving the evaluation of
teaching at the school was also
identified by Shoven as an impor
tant change that must be made.
"The truth of the matter is
that we don't have enough objec
tive or even subjective evi
dence," he said. A subcommittee
of the Faculty Senate's Commit
tee on Academic Appraisal and
Achievement has been looking
into ways to improve teaching
evaluation and is expected to
issue a report by year's end, but
Shoven said ultimately improve
ments must be made at the
department level.
Shoven also announced the
Dean's Awards for Distinguished
Teaching. Physics Prof. Alexan
der Fetter, Drama Prof. Charles
Lyons and Communications
Prof. Clifford Nass were honored
for graduate teaching, while
Statistics Prof. Michael Martin's
past efforts in the Public Policy
Program were acknowledged.
Philosophy Prof. Peter Godfrey-
Smith and History Prof. Mary
Louise Roberts won for excel
lence in their first years at Stan
ford.
