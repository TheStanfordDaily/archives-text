# Stanford finishing Sand Hill plans

Having completed a six-month com
munity outreach program, Stanford will
present an updated version of its Sand
Hill Road corridor proposal to residents
of Menlo Park and Palo Alto on Thurs
day.
According to Andy Coe, Stanford's di
rector of community relations, the Uni
versity has gathered "community input
in a variety of forms," all of which will be
publicized at next week's meeting.

"We're going to report back what
we've heard and what our thinking is,"
Coe said.
The project plan, which was originally
filed with the neighboring cities nearly
18 months ago, contains two central pro
posals.
The first seeks to widen and extend
Sand Hill Road so that it would intersect
with El Camino Real, while concurrently
expanding the Stanford Shopping Center
by 10 percent. A 1992 study estimated
the project would cost $9 million.
The second calls for the construction

of "Stanford West," a residential housing
complex that would be built on the 48
acres of land adjacent to the Oak Creek
apartments and San Francisquito Creek.
The intention behind these proposals,
according to Coe, is to create a project
that will be beneficial for Stanford and
the surrounding area.
"We're trying to develop a program
that will create a win-win situation for
both the University and the local com
munities," he said.
