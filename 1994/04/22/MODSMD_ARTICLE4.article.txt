# Stanford finishing Sand Hill plans
## 
### Piers Henwood Staff writer 
Having completed a six-month com
munity outreach program, Stanford will
present an updated version of its Sand
Hill Road corridor proposal to residents
of Menlo Park and Palo Alto on Thurs
day.
According to Andy Coe, Stanford's di
rector of community relations, the Uni
versity has gathered "community input
in a variety of forms," all of which will be
publicized at next week's meeting.

"We're going to report back what
we've heard and what our thinking is,"
Coe said.
The project plan, which was originally
filed with the neighboring cities nearly
18 months ago, contains two central pro
posals.
The first seeks to widen and extend
Sand Hill Road so that it would intersect
with El Camino Real, while concurrently
expanding the Stanford Shopping Center
by 10 percent. A 1992 study estimated
the project would cost $9 million.
The second calls for the construction

of "Stanford West," a residential housing
complex that would be built on the 48
acres of land adjacent to the Oak Creek
apartments and San Francisquito Creek.
The intention behind these proposals,
according to Coe, is to create a project
that will be beneficial for Stanford and
the surrounding area.
"We're trying to develop a program
that will create a win-win situation for
both the University and the local com
munities," he said.
Specifically, Coe claimed that
the proposed changes to Sand Hill
Road will improve traffic circula
tion by "taking cars off the resi
dential streets and onto the major
road." Sand Hill Road begins four
miles southwest of Stanford near
Highway 280 and currently mean
ders to an end in the Shopping
Center parking lot.
Coe also believes the Stanford
West project will ameliorate the San
Francisquito Creek area, which is
currently in "terrible shape."
Local residents, however, are
not convinced. According to Gail
Slocum, a Menlo Park council
woman, Stanford's plans do not
take local interests into account.
"The current proposal does not
meet enough of Menlo Park's
needs to be acceptable," she said.
In particular, Slocum believes
that expanding Sand Hill Road will
not relieve traffic in Menlo Park's
residential areas, but rather that
the reverse will occur. According to
Slocum, the proposed expansion

will include 11 traffic lights and
will inevitably cause huge backups
in traffic, encouraging cars to turn
off into Menlo Park residential
areas.
"Like water, traffic follows the
path of least resistance. Drivers
will eventually lose patience and
search for quicker routes," Slocum
said.
Bill Watson, a member of Menlo
Park's Citizens for Sensible Plan
ning, echoed this same perspective,
calling Coe's hypothesis "the ulti
mate fallacy."
"With all the additional devel
opment, cars will end up going
through Menlo Park streets," he
said.
Although Stanford has devel
oped traffic models that specifical
ly predict a decrease in circulation,
residents are skeptical due to the
increase in population that the
Stanford West project will engen
der. With nearly 1,200 residential
units planned, the impact on Palo
Alto's traffic flow will be tremen
dous, Slocum believes.
"The proposed housing repre
sents a 5 percent increase in Palo
Alto's population," she said. "That
could be devastating."

Furthermore, the housing pro
ject itself will badly affect the sur
rounding areas, according to Wat
son. The open fields where the pro
ject is to be situated comprise a
valuable part of the local commu
nity, he believes, which should be
maintained for future generations.
"Saving that area is like saving
a small Yosemite, saving a Golden
Gate Park," Watson said. "The
best use for us and for future gen
erations is as open space."
Given this tumultuous recep
tion, it is unclear whether Stan
ford's plans will come to fruition.
Because the areas under question
fall under both Menlo Park and
Palo Alto jurisdiction, Stanford
must ultimately obtain approval
from the two city councils if the
plans are to be pursued.
After Thursday's meeting,
Stanford will draft its final propos
al sometime next month, when the
issue will be reviewed by an envi
ronmental impact commission and
then the city councils.
"Often Stanford does not listen
to what we say," Slocum conclud
ed. "But seeing as they want this
project, this time they will have
to."
