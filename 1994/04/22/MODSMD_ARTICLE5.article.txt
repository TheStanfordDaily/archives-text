# Apathy in action
## Aimless student protesters attempt to shut down Old Union with U-locks 
### Burt Herman Editorial staff 
A group of self-proclaimed apathetic
protesters made an unsuccessful attempt
to shut down Old Union yesterday.
Three U-locks were fastened to the
front doors of the building, according to
University Bursar Jon Erickson, who no
ticed the locks when he arrived for work at
about 7 a.m.
Fliers were also posted on the building
that said the locks were placed there by a
group called "R.U.S.T." â€” an acronym for
"Rise Up and Sleep Through."
According to the fliers, the group had no
specific aim to their protest. "Demonstra
tion is the hallmark of every generation of
young Americans," the fliers said. "Have

we protested? No. Should we be protest
ing? Yes. What should we protest for?
Nothing."
"We're shutting down Old Union be
cause we don't care, and we're prepared to
do something about it,"the fliers said.
The flier continued by saying that the
lock-out was making the statement that
"even apathy requires action."
"Stanford students already don't care," the
fliers said. "We just want them to show it."
Operations and maintenance personnel
were able to remove the locks from the
building in about 20 minutes, Erickson
said. There was no delay to the building's
operations, as employees were able to enter
from other doors, according to Erickson.
"It was a minor irritant," he said. "It's
springtime, that pretty much says it all."
