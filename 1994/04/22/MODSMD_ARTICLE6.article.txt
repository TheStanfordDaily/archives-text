# Poet Crystos discusses writings, racism and lesbian relationships

"One of the greatest things about poetry is
that it's an excellent opportunity for revenge
— revenge you can't get incarcerated for . . .
or at least not yet."
That's what Crystos, a Native American
lesbian poet, told an audience of about 30 last
night in a poetry readingat Roble Hall — part
of this year's Bisexual, Gay and lesbian
Awareness Days celebration.
Over the course of her 90-minute discus
sion, her poems and jokes managed to draw
several moments of emotionally charged si
lence as well as quite a few laughs.

Crystos — whose poetry translates bitter
ness into biting, often sardonic humor — has
published three collections of her work and
has contributed to several anthologies, in
cluding "This Bridge Called My Back," one of
the foremost collections of feminist poetry.
Her poems probe the depths of a variety of
often-ignored issues, ranging from disre
spect for Native Americans' spiritual identi
ty to the issue of battering in lesbian rela
tionships.
In reading from her work last night, Crys
tos also addressed the larger issue of racism
— a phenomenon she feels is an outgrowth of
a "need for hatred."
Responding to the Ku Klux
Klan's increasingly frequent plant
ing of burning crosses on reserva
tions, she spoke of the problems
associated with a population of
indigenous people who do not fully
understand the history behind
racism in America.
Crystos commented on "assimi
lation soap suds" and "spiritual
appropriation" as regrettable char
acteristics of the American drive

toward a cultural "melting pot."
"What are you doing here?" she
asked in one of her poems. "Go
build a McDonald's somewhere
else."
The ill effects of this "melting
pot," according to Crystos, are also
reflected in the American literary
canon, in which artists who are
members of marginalized groups
are rarely published.
She asserted that "categorically,
publishers are pimps."
Her solution to this problem is
to "insert [her native] language
into literature ... demanding a
place for it."
Recollecting a childhood in

which she "learned young to be
mean enough to be safe," Crystos
urged artists to "develop a strong,
nasty core," to harness their
strength, and to hold fast to their
artistic assertions.
She criticized feminism's ten
dency to work within what she per
ceives as the patriarchal frame
work of the publishing industry,
rather than challenging that
framework with greater courage
and perseverance.
Crystos also showed that her
poetry is not limited to the realm of
political commentary. Referring to
herself as a "whore with the heart
of a marshmallow," she read some
