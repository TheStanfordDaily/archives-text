Dr. Jeanette Wolf, a tall, red-haired New York na
tive, is in a hurry, which seems a chronic state of af
fairs for her. But as chief resident in emergency med
icine, she hopes life will resemble something like nor
malcy within a few months when she graduates from
the program.
She plans to start painting again, among other
things. In college she enjoyed impressionist art, and
although she's experimented with both oil and wa
tercolor, she says that "I'm not as talented as I'd like
to be."
In addition, she'd like to start exercising more,
and learn how to cook something "other than a can of
Spaghetti-O's." She's also firm in her resolution to
get a dog — "a yellow Lab" — and to run a marathon.
But on top of that, she's making plans for a full
time academic position in emergency medicine. The
texts she's lugging around are for an upcoming lec
ture she's presenting, and her enthusiasm for teach
ing is part of the reason she wants to stay in acade
mics.
Emergency medicine is a relatively new specialty,
and one in high demand by hospitals and HMOs.
Trained to diagnose and treat a diverse array of prob
lems — from nasty flus among the elderly to abdom
inal trauma among children to allergy attacks among
college students — residents pass through a program
that lasts about three years, and Wolf happens to be
among the first emergency medicine graduates from
Stanford.

Dr. Jeanette Wolf examines the heart of a young visitor to Stan
ford's emergency room.
She vividly remembers her
time as an off-service resident,
training in say, the anesthesiolo
gy or surgery service, rather
than the emergency room.
"You'll often park your car in
the parking lot at 8 in the morn
ing, and not pick it up until 36
hours later the next night," she
says. "During that time I might
have one Snickers and a hot
dog. You're going to have a lot

The specialty's breadth and its
unique scheduling appealed to
her. "I think, as a whole, people
go into it because they have out
side interests," she says.
"And they want to develop in
areas other than just clinical
medicine. We work very hard,
believe in very good medical
care, but at the same time have
priorities in other places of life. I
chose emergency medicine
because I wanted to develop as a
well-rounded human being in all
aspects of my life, and not just
my medical career."
The flexibility allows resi
dents to explore such diverse
options as wilderness medicine,
toxicology, emergency medical
services or research. Neverthe
less, she says with a smile, "This
is all in theory too. Even on good
months you're pressed for
time."
She describes residency as "an
incredibly trying time," but one
where "you make goals you never
thought you could attain, go
through stresses you never
thought you could go through."
Some months, she says, "are like
studying for final exams every
fourth night because you're up
36 hours straight."
As chief resident, the training
isn't quite as arduous as before,
and she's not as attached to the
hospital during clinical shifts as
she was during internship. As an
emergency medicine resident,
training partly consists of rota
tions through the other medical
specialties, focusing on problems
and procedures relevant to emer
gency care.

of nurses who've changed
shifts, and often they don't
understand why you're so tired
because they're coming back
fresh."
Trying to find balance
Because many of her patients
arrive at the doors of the hospital
with life-threatening or
advanced medical problems, Wolf
has had to find a psychological
balance that lies somewhere
between emotional exhaustion
and cold detachment.
"The other day there was
someone in the ER who was
dying of AIDS," she says."And
they were with a sister who was
trying to struggle with this, and
I just realized how devastated
the sister was, and how young
the person was who was dying,
and how important it was for us
to be compassionate — not only
for the dying patient's needs,

but also for the sister's needs —
and I realized that if you got too
drawn into the situation, then
you go around back and start
crying yourself. I think the bal
ance is trying to deliver good
care without burning yourself
out."
Because of the nature of her
specialty, she says, "some of our
contacts in the emergency
department are too brief,

'You'll often park your car in the parking lot at
8 in the morning, and not pick it up until 36
hours later the next night. During that time I
might have one Snickers and a hot dog.'

because we're very busy and we
have many patients to see." And
although this frees her from
some the obligations other physi
cians have, it sometimes dis
tances her from her patients. It's
an issue that weighs heavily with
her.
"We see the worst possible
scenario as a child who has been
hit by a car, and is either dead or
has brain damage," she says, qui
etly.
"And we see that patient and
the emotion of the family for
maybe 10 minutes. The physi
cian who's been taking care of
that child knows that child much
better than I can ever hope to
know him in the few minutes I
interact with him. So in many
ways, it's a loss."
Women: New to the game
Nevertheless, Wolf has man
aged to survive — and often

through lessons learned from
patients. "When you see a
patient who's been battered by
her husband, and who is econom
ically dependent on her spouse
for any hope of survival, and
who, if she walks away with her
children walks into poverty, to a
shelter, you realize that your
problem of, 'Oh my God, I
haven't seen a movie in two
weeks,' is pretty minimal," she
says.
As a female physician, Wolf
says that though she hasn't
encountered any sexual discrim
ination, she believes women may
face difficulties that their male
counterparts don't. "You have to
prove yourself maybe a bit
more," she says. "You have to
prove to yourself that you're
dedicated and that you're
tough."
Women are "new players to
the game," Wolf says, conscious
ly or unconsciously testing the
traditional dynamics among
patients, physicians, nurses and
other members of the health care
system, and consequently facing
problems a male physician might
not.
In part, Wolfs decision to seek
a future in academia is driven by
her belief that there need to be
more women in faculty positions,
which are still overwhelmingly
occupied by men.
Though all of this may sound
deadly serious, tense and grim,
Wolf projects an easygoing atti
tude.
Though she's had her
moments of doubt, she still
believes that medicine is a worth
while calling, and one that
needn't impede other avenues
for growth and self-development.

Her advice to those fretting
about medicine is not to fall into
obsessive anxiety.
"Go where your heart is," she
says."And if it takes a couple
years to get there, don't worry
about it. Once you pick a career,
especially if you pick medicine,
once you're out of your residen

cy, you're that type of doctor for
the rest of your life. I'm a physi
cian now at 28 — I could have
just as easily been a physician at
32, and have 5 years more life
experience between the time I
graduated from college to medi
cal school. There's no hurry —
life's not a race."

Dr. Jeanette Wolf fills out the requisite paperwork after an admis
sion to the emergency room. Quiet in the morning, the ER is often
jammed on Friday and weekend nights.
