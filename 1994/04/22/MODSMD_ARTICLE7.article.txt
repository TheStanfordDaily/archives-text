Dr. Jeanette Wolf, a tall, red-haired New York na
tive, is in a hurry, which seems a chronic state of af
fairs for her. But as chief resident in emergency med
icine, she hopes life will resemble something like nor
malcy within a few months when she graduates from
the program.
She plans to start painting again, among other
things. In college she enjoyed impressionist art, and
although she's experimented with both oil and wa
tercolor, she says that "I'm not as talented as I'd like
to be."
In addition, she'd like to start exercising more,
and learn how to cook something "other than a can of
Spaghetti-O's." She's also firm in her resolution to
get a dog — "a yellow Lab" — and to run a marathon.
But on top of that, she's making plans for a full
time academic position in emergency medicine. The
texts she's lugging around are for an upcoming lec
ture she's presenting, and her enthusiasm for teach
ing is part of the reason she wants to stay in acade
mics.
Emergency medicine is a relatively new specialty,
and one in high demand by hospitals and HMOs.
Trained to diagnose and treat a diverse array of prob
lems — from nasty flus among the elderly to abdom
inal trauma among children to allergy attacks among
college students — residents pass through a program
that lasts about three years, and Wolf happens to be
among the first emergency medicine graduates from
Stanford.
