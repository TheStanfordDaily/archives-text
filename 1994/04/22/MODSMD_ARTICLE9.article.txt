# Doctors in Training
## Attracted by problem solving rather than procedures Ezeji-Okoye seeks the subtler victories of internal medicine, explores the perceptions that drive health-care decisions 
### Ed Yoon Senior staff writer 
You twist your knee badly
while rollerblading — time for an
MRI and a visit to the orthopedic
surgeon?
Or your mother suffers a mas
sive heart attack and enters the
hospital. Anxious and confused,
how do you — and your mother
— respond to doctor's questions
about issues of life support,
inserting a breathing tube or
administering heart-stimulating
drugs?
Dr. Stephen Ezeji-Okoye,
chief resident in internal
medicine at Stanford Medical
Center, plans to examine some of
these questions — questions
which reflect the attitudes of
physicians and patients and fuel
the millions of dollars spent on
health care each year. Especially
interested in issues of access,
he's seen clear changes in the
way Stanford operates in the five
years that he's trained here.
"There weren't quite so many
issues in terms of cost contain
ment," he says. "Before you
came in, and left when someone
decided it was time to leave.
There weren't the outside pres
sures that all the hospitals are
facing in terms of being more
efficient and cost-effective in
their care."
Listening to the patient
At first drawn to surgery in
medical school, Ezeji-Okoye
found himself taking more inter
est in simply listening — listen
ing to the patient's story from all
angles — physical, intellectual
and psychosocial — and trying to
approach the individual by inte
grating these separate aspects
into a whole.
"I found I got more interested
in the problem-solving aspect of
medicine," he says, sitting in his
small office in the hospital's new
wing, by a patient ward.
"One of the things I found
unsatisfying about surgery was
that often, when people arrived,
the diagnosis had already been
made, and we were doing the
more technical aspects. I found
that I was more interested in
how the diagnosis was made than
in actually doing the operation."
Once one of the most sought
after residencies in medicine,
internal medicine is in a crisis of
sorts. Recent editorials in the
New England Journal of
Medicine have addressed the
declining numbers of medical
students entering the field, and
studies have painted a bleak pic
ture of plummeting morale and
complaints about low pay.
At top-ranked medical
schools, the perception that

patients in internal medicine are
older, with chronic intractable
illnesses that are at best held in
check, never reversed, holds little
excitement when contrasted with
the bold and interventional
image of other specialties.
"I was concerned that it
would represent a continuous
trail of taking care of people
with chronic illnesses who are
going to move towards the end
of their life without making any
significant change," Ezeji-
Okoye says. "Fixing up some
thing, though it's never quite as
good as it was before, moving
down a path of continuous
decay. I felt that there would be
no victories."
But he found that the tri
umphs were there — though per
haps more subtle, less cinematic.
"What made me go into medicine
was that I found the way you
measure your victories is differ
ent," he says.
"They take longer to achieve,
but they're there. When you have
a complex problem that you're
able to finally solve, it's a
tremendous feeling. And you
can't play down the level of
patient interaction and commu
nication. That really makes it
worthwhile."
Indeed, Ezeji-Okoye has devel
oped close relationships with sev
eral of his former patients, and
there's no accounting that can
measure their value.
"Most of the fun I had was

actually talking with patients,
spending time and finding out
what was going on with them,
regardless of whether they were
sick or not," he says. "In fact,
when they're not sick, it's actual
ly just as much fun, or more fun,
because you find out who you're
patient is, what they're like and
what their interests are, what
drives them. And that can be use
ful when they're sick because
then you have a better under
standing what's going on in their
lives and what illness means to
them."
Retooling health care
As chief resident in internal
medicine, Ezeji-Okoye spends
most of his time with administra
tive tasks — arranging patient
transfers, scheduling confer
ences on patient outcomes and
developments in research, acting
as liaison between the internal
medicine house staff and the hos
pital — than he did as a junior
resident.
His first few years were "fair
ly stressful," he says, especially
because of the unending self
questioning that naturally
occurs in such hands-on training.
"When things go wrong, there's
always a lot of soul searching
about what you could have done
differently," he says.
"Did you interpret the data
correctly, could you have influ
enced the outcome differently —
you get very concerned. Are you

a good physician? Are you going
to be a good physician?"
Apparently he was. Selected
by the attending physicians two
years ago, the chief residency
position in internal medicine

'When you have a
complex problem
that you're able to
finally solve, it's a
tremendous feeling.
And you can't play
down the level of
patient interaction
and communication.'

involves less direct patient care
but a high degree of responsibili
ty. As a university hospital, Stan
ford offers specialized care and
facilities that most community
hospitals lack, and he directs
patient transfers from hospitals
all over Northern California.
Ezeji-Okoye's administrative
insights will probably serve him
well as he makes forays into
health policy and medical
anthropology. Now looking into
health policy fellowships, he is
interested in the interface

between patient and provider
and how it affects health care
delivery.
"How do we know what we're
designing is going to meet the
needs of the population?" he
asks, considering the reform pro
posals being debated.
"A lot of the expectations the
population has are built up by
what the media says — being
able to cure a wide range of dis
ease, expensive technology. I
don't think it's always been put
in a light that's truly accurate in
terms of what our true abilities
are.
"I think there needs to be bet
ter communication between
physicians and patients in terms
of coming to a better understand
ing of what can be offered and
what can be done," he says.
"There needs to be a retooling of
responsibility both among
patients and physicians to do
what's really necessary, like
when you have a cold you don't
need antibiotics."
As medicine advances, the
need to evaluate what is appro
priate and to explain its complex
ities to patients grows ever larg
er. "There should be an expecta
tion among patients and physi
cians that the best care will be
delivered,"he says. "But some
times doing nothing amounts to
doing something, rather than
feeling that you have to go for
the most expensive."
Working with the underserved

is a special priority for Ezeji-
Okoye. "The people who don't
have insurance, who don't have
Medi-Cal or Medicare, really get
hurt in the current medical sys
tem because they don't really
have a lot of ways to get access,"
he says.
"Though you can go to county
hospitals, it takes a lot of time
and effort even to he seen. Given
those constraints, and that a lot
of people are working very hard
for their money, you have to
make a tough decision about
when to see the doctor."
A 'great privilege and honor'
As a black physician, Ezeji-
Okoye has found Stanford to be
receptive and open, and believes
that there's a concerted effort to
increase the number of minori
ties on the staff.
"I think people treated me like
a physician first, a black physi
cian second," he says. "But I
think that was something I was
aware of in my interaction with
minority patients. Often they
were surprised and pleased to see
me, and that meant a lot to me. I
developed some close relations
with some of my patients I saw in
the clinic.
"I think the main thing that
was important to them was that
someone was interested in their
health and well-being and cared
about how they did, but I think
it's nice to see someone of their
own background to pursue
opportunities where traditional
ly there had been none."
This awareness bears certain
responsibilities, Ezeji-Okoye
believes. He considers his career
to be "a great privilege and a
great honor, because a lot of peo
ple worked very hard to make
that possible, and I think in some
ways, it's a greater responsibility
on minority physicians, because I
think you don't only represent
yourself."
"You have a responsibility
because a lot of people sacrificed
a lot, worked pretty hard to make
it possible for you to get to this
position."
That knowledge helps him
weather his own personal trials,
and overall he feels the program
has trained him well. "You may
have worked very hard, but it's
certainly a lot easier than it was
20 years ago, 10 years ago," he
says.
"I think that's something
minority students have to be
aware of, partly because of preju
dices that exist. But I've really
enjoyed my time at Stanford, and
I hope it continues. I'd some
times wonder if I'd chosen the
right field, but I'd never felt I
made a mistake on the right pro
gram."

Dr. Stephen
Ezeji-Okoye
seems untrou
bled by the bulk
of knowledge
found in inter
nal medicine.
As chief resi
dent, his job
involves more
administrative
tasks than
before, and
keeping a light
hearted tone
among the 80
or so residents
in internal
medicine.
