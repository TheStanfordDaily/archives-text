# Rain dampens Earth Day
## 
### Frank Guinan Staff writer 
Rain poured down on Stanford's Earth Day
celebration for the second year in a row on Satur
day, forcing most activities to be cut short and
eventually canceled.
Although events were originally scheduled
from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., the tents, booths and podi
um on Wilbur Field were taken down only two
hours into the event.
Among the five scheduled speakers, only one
was actually able to attend. Tom Hayden, a candi
date for governor in the upcoming Democratic
primary, addressed a crowd of about 50 people
and recited an Earth Day prayer he had written.
Organizers remained upbeat despite the
washout. "The importance here is the amount of
effort and enthusiasm put in to organizing the
event," said coordinator Justin Pollard, a senior.
"It shows that [the environment] has a future as
a cause."
He said Students for Environmental Action at
Stanford, sponsors of this year's Earth Day, will
hold a follow-up event within the next two weeks.
Some of the other scheduled speakers —
including Phillip Berry, vice president of the Sier
ra Club, Shannon Wright from the Rainforest

Action Network, Bay Area Action Co-Director
Peter Drekmeier and Eduardo Viola, a visiting
Latin American studies professor — might be
part of a panel discussion, Pollard said.
In addition to speakers, three bands were
scheduled to play. While Narnian Consort, a folk
trio, performed under a tent, the appearances of
Gitano, a Latin jazz quintet, and Rankin' Scroo
and Ginger, a Jamaican-Hawaiian reggae band,
were canceled.
Only about half of the expected non-profit
environmental groups and student organizations
showed up with their respective booths Saturday.
Among these groups were Planned Parenthood,
the Stanford Recycling Center and the Stanford
Solar Car Project.
This year's event, entitled "Think Globally,"
was the first to be sponsored by SEAS alone. Last
year, the student organization held the activity in
conjunction with Bay Area Action as part of the
larger Bay Area activities.
According to Pollard, nearly half of the money
for the event came from the fundraisers in cam
pus dorms. Another substantial amount came
from selling Earth Day T-shirts.
Earth Day is a celebration which dates back to
1970, held every year on April 22 to promote envi
ronmental awareness.
