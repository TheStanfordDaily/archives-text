## Car bomb explodes in Johannesburg Explosion kills at least nine people, damages ANC headquarters 
### 
JOHANNESBURG, South
Africa (AP) — A car bomb explod
ed in downtown Johannesburg
yesterday, killing at least nine peo
ple, damaging the headquarters of
the African National Congress,
and terrorizing South Africans
just two days before the first all
race election.
No one claimed responsibility
for the blast, which also wounded
about 100 people. Suspicions fell on
white extremists — the last, stub
born holdouts to the election that
will usher in black-majority rule.
Police later found a second
bomb in a car parked only blocks
away. Police Col. Eugene Opper
man said police uncovered it just
after midnight after receiving a
telephone tip. The bomb would be
defused or detonated in a con
trolled explosion, he told the inde
pendent South African Press Asso
ciation.
Political leaders from several
parties appealed for calm.
"I don't want you to concen
trate on the violent action of those
people who want to disrupt the
process," ANC President Nelson
Mandela said at a huge rally in
Durban that culminated his cam
paign for the nation's highest
office.
"We're going to deal with those
people. We have made fantastic

progress, despite criminals and
murderers."
The ANC was expected to win
the election, the first in South
African history to include the
black majority. Right-wing
extremists opposed to black major
ity rule have threatened drastic
action before voting begins.
The present white-led govern
ment, expected to share power
with the ANC in the next adminis
tration, said it was resolved to go
ahead with the three days of vot
ing, which begins tomorrow.
"There is no possibility that
radical minorities will be allowed
to frustrate the will of the vast
majority of the South African peo
ple," President F.W. de Klerk said
in a statement. "All they will
achieve will be to add to the unnec
essary suffering of innocent citi
zens who have already suffered
enough."
One of those killed was an ANC
provincial legislature candidate,
Susan Keane, who was driving
into the ANC regional office for a
meeting when the bomb went off.
Other victims were pedestrians
near the blast site.
A spokesman for the militant
right-wing Afrikaner Resistance
Movement denied the group was
involved.
The blast, the biggest ever to hit

Johannesburg, renewed fears of
raging violence during the election
— fears that had been quelled by
the last-minute decision of the
Zulu nationalist Inkatha Freedom
Party to take part in the vote.
Inkatha's decision left only right
wing extremists boycotting the
ballot.
Supporters of Inkatha and the
ANC have fought in the black
townships for years — three ANC
election workers were killed Satur
day and eight were missing after a
shooting in Ulundi, the capital of
the Zulu homeland.
Three Inkatha supporters were
killed after a campaign rally yes
terday.
Inkatha leader Mangosuthu
Buthelezi, who agreed last week to
end the party's boycott of the bal
loting, joined in condemning the
violence yesterday.
He appealed to his supporters:
"The IFP gains absolutely nothing
from violence. ... Let the election
run its course and let it be free and
fair."
The attack did not bear hall
marks of militant black groups,
who have tended to focus on white
targets, either civilian or military.
Most of the victims yesterday were
black. White right-wingers are
known to possess explosives and to
be experts at using them.

Agrippa Manyate, who lives
next door to ANC national head
quarters, said he doubted it would
be safe for him to vote. Manyate
returned home an hour after the
blast to find soldiers setting up a
barbed-wire barricade down the
middle of his street.
Solomon Shirinda, 27, a fruit
hawker, was putting up his apple
stand when he was shaken by the
blast at 9:50 a.m. He said he would
not be deterred from casting the
first vote of his life. "I have to free
my people," he said.
As much as 200 pounds of explo
sives were packed in the car, which
blew up on Bree Street, about
halfway between the ANC's nation
al headquarters and regional offices,
police Col. Steve Senekal said.
Several smaller bombings have
hit Johannesburg in recent years,
but there have been rare events
since the ANC gave up its anti
apartheid sabotage campaign in
1990. Bombings have increased in
rural right-wing areas in recent
months, including the dramatic
sabotage of an important oil
pipeline Saturday in Sasolburg, 60
miles south of Johannesburg.
The explosion yesterday left a
hole in the pavement four feet
deep and six feet across and twist
ed shards of blackened chassis
where the car was parked.
