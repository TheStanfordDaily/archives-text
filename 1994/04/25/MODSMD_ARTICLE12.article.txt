SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina
(AP) — Bosnian Serbs grudgingly gave
up their three-week assault on Gorazde
yesterday under threat of NATO air
strikes, allowing deployment of U.N.
troops, food deliveries and evacuation
of scores of wounded.
The Serbs burned houses and blew
up a water treatment plant as they
withdrew, but U.N. officials said they
were satisfied.
"In the last 24 hours in Gorazde, the
situation, I'm delighted to say, is
quiet," said the U.N. commander in
Bosnia, Lt. Gen. Sir Michael Rose.

That contradicted reports by the
Muslim-led Bosnian government,
evacuees and some aid workers who
reported intense sniper fire yesterday.
Local officials said three people were
killed and 15 wounded, but those
reports could not immediately be con
firmed.
A 14-truck convoy carrying 90 tons
of aid arrived late yesterday after being
delayed much of the day by Serbs. It
was the first relief convoy since before
the Serb offensive began.
Rose said the Serbs were withdraw
ing three kilometers (1.9 miles) from

the center of Gorazde, as NATO had
demanded they do by early yesterday.
Air reconnaissance indicated a larger
scale withdrawal was beginning, he
said.
"We think there are one or two
observation posts left just inside the
three-kilometer zone, but you know we
are very short of troops at the
moment," he said.
The Bosnian Serbs face another
deadline to withdraw 20 kilometers
(12.4 miles) from Gorazde by early
Wednesday, and Rose said it appeared
they intend to comply.
