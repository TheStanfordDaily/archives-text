Global economy to grow
WASHINGTON (AP) - Finance offi
cials from the world's seven richest
industrial countries expressed optimism
yesterday that the global economy can
achieve faster growth this year despite a
recent rise in long-term interest rates.
In a chairman's statement summariz
ing the discussions, Treasury Secretary
Lloyd Bentsen said his colleagues believed
that a variety of signs point to stronger
growth with inflation remaining low.

"Collectively, we are more encouraged
that we have been," Bentsen said. "And I
must say I was pleased to hear the opti
mism around the table."
British Chancellor of the Exchequer
Kenneth Clarke, summarizing the five
hours of discussions, said, "We thought,
on the whole, things were very much bet
ter than they were 12 months ago. We
were quite optimistic about the outlook."
Clarke said he was encouraged by com
ments from German officials that the
recession in that country has bottomed out.
