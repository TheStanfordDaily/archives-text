Frequent tinkering with
academic policy projects
bad message to outside

NO, YOU CAN'T retake class
es. Wait a minute, there's
really nothing wrong with
retaking them; we'll let you. Uh,
then again, maybe you shouldn't.
Give us a quarter and we'll get
back to you. In the meantime,
don't act on anything we tell you.
We'll probably just change our
minds again next year. . . .
This isn't hypothetical. More
and more, this wavering character
izes Stanford's academic policy.
For the past several years, the
Faculty Senate has forced students
to try to plan their courses around
a continuously changing set of aca
demic rules and regulations. The
distribution requirements, course
retake policy, course drop deadline
and Cultures, Ideas and Values
curriculum have all been changed
significantly during the last four
years alone. Many of them have
changed more than once.
Clearly, periodic revisions of
Stanford's requirements and grad
ing policies are necessary. The Uni
versity should always be working
to improve the design of its educa
tional product.
Yet the inconsistencies of many
recent changes seem to suggest a
lack of faculty agreement about
what type of product should be
offered. More importantly, the sen
ate seems more ready to implement
various conflicting suggestions for
reform than to decide exactly what
sort of educational philosophy
should be guiding its decisions.
For example, the old class-retake
policy encouraged students to drop
classes rather than work through the
end of the quarter, because any pass
ing grade, including a D, became a
permanent mark on their transcript.
Less than two years ago, in May
1992, the senate voted to change
the class retake policy. Their new

policy allowed students to replace
previous grades by retaking a class
in which they weren't satisfied
with their performance. Students
were now free to try their best in
very competitive classes or classes
outside their major, even through
the final, without fear of an indeli
ble "Scarlet D."
On its own, such a change would
suggest the senate agreed with pos
itive rather than punitive academic
incentives. But a recent recom
mendation of the Committee on
Academic Appraisal and Achieve
ment to bring back a version of the
abandoned F grade also intends to
throw out the recently implement
ed grade replacement policy.
If faculty members abandon the
replacement policy without some
sort of "grandfathering" clause,
many students who endured a com
petitive course with the understand
ing they could take it over later will
feel justifiably defrauded. It seems
very much like a bait-and-switch.
More importantly, such rapid
reversals in philosophy seem dan
gerously schizophrenic. The facul
ty, whether intentionally or not, is
sending very mixed messages to
students and the public about what
goals Stanford has for its students.
This is a problem.
Has Stanford lost confidence in
its own ability to educate students
for the real world? Regardless of
how much well-intended debate goes
on within the policy-making groups,
to an outsider Stanford vacillates.
The solution for this is not sim
ple. But making Stanford's educa
tional philosophy more clear can
only start with the faculty. As the
senate considers proposals that
would again change the academic
and grading policies, it should keep
in mind that overturning previous
decisions has severe consequences
for future ones. It should try to
work out differences in committee,
not through continuous reversals.
Ignoring this "split personality"
threatens to infect Stanford's edu
cational mission, its students' suc
cess and its position as a leading
American university.
