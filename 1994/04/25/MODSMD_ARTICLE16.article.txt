## Radio memories: the '70s 
### 
THE BIGGEST hits of the '70s.
That's the slogan of the Bay Area's
newest radio station — "Big" 98.1
EM. Have you heard it yet? I know there
are a bunch of people out there who have
heard it — and they are not, I repeat are
not, ashamed to admit it. Those I have
talked to love it as much as I do, and not
because it harkens us back to the days
when we were squeezing into a pair of
bellbottoms or doin' the hustle at the
local discotheque.
The station's playlist is not laden with
the disco music we normally associate
with the 19705, as great a decade as it
was. Although Saturday is "shake your
booty" night — when they fill your ears
with the golden tones of the Gibb broth
ers — the station celebrates one of the
best things to come out of the time period
next to Tupperware. That, my friends, is
rock' n' roll.
Here are just some of the artists you
are guaranteed to hear on that station:
Billy Joel, Chicago, Boston, Little River
Band, Queen, Bruce, The Eagles, Wings,
Paul Simon, Steely Dan and Steve Miller
— and the hits just keep on coming. And
if you ever hear Barry Manilow, Neil
Diamond or good oF Babs Streisand, I
think you have permission to blow up
the transmitter. But don't quote me on
that.
Despite how it sounds, this column is
not a plug for the station. I am not abus
ing my power as a columnist and accept
ing money to promote the these guys. But

I do want to say that listening to this sta
tion is more than recalling what songs
were at the top of the charts 20 years ago.
All I can think about when I listen to this
station is what it was like to be in grade
school again.
Music marks the time better than any
thing else. It might not be the song "Born
to Run" that does it for you, but try to
remember what it was like to be a kid and
the music comes back to you instantly.
I'll bet that most students have at least
one "Remember that song by " con
versation with their roommates or hall
mates during their first quarter here at
Stanford. Why are these old-time songs
special to us? Because it reminds us of
how great it was to be a kid.
I wish I was a kid forever. I'm pretty
sure I would want to be a pre-teen, prob
ably no older than 11. Any older than
that and you've got to deal with puberty,
girls (or boys) and a lot of other stuff
that just makes your life way too compli
cated.
But if you're 11 — no 10 — 10 years
old, you still get meals provided, classes
in school require the teachers to come to
your home room and not the other way
around, and you may be starting to
acquire your musical tastes.
Age means responsibility and that's
bad, very bad. I'm not afraid to steal the
line from "Cheers" when Norm tells
Woody that's it's a dog-eat-dog world out
there — and he's wearing Milk Bone
underwear. You all know about my apart

ment and its minimal accouterments.
Empty homes don't happen when you're
a 10-year-old.
Who doesn't remember getting called
in to eat after an entire afternoon of play
ing kickball? Who could forget stealing
those extra cookies to put in your lunch
just so you'd have more than your friend?
And around holiday time, who had to run
to the store to get those last minute
Christmas gifts? Life was great because
we didn't have a care in the world.
I'm really just whining about hav>ng
to find a job. I don't want to have to do it
Wah. I just want to listen to the radio.
Wah. I don't want to grow up. I'm a Toys
'R' Us kid. There's a million toys at Toys
'R' Us that I can play with.
I think we spend some of our life, not
of all it, trying to get back to the womb.
Since that's true, I hope I have extra bat
teries for my Walkman. I might even buy
some of the actual albums. Maybe Billy
Joel's "52nd St." or Paul Simon's "Still
Crazy After All These Years." Regard
less, the reception better be good. Noth
ing from the '50s, '60s, '80s or '90s. Just
the biggest hits of the '70s. All day long.
Groovy.

Jesse slept out for Barbra Streisand tick
ets. Really.
