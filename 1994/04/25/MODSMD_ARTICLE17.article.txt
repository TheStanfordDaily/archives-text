## Citizens of U.S. have no other name besides 'Americans' 
### 
I APPRECIATE Natasha Deganello's
intent (and eloquent language) in
her Friday forum piece "The many
flags and faces of 'America,' " but her
view seems limited in its practical appli
cation.
She complained that those from the
United States of America refer to them
selves — and exclusively themselves —
as "Americans," when everyone on the
continents of North and South America
are "Americans." She implies that we
deny respect to the rest of Americans liv
ing on the two continents.
When I spent a week each year of
high school in Mexico, those of us from
the States were referred to as norteam
ericanos, rather than americanos. This
was to be sensitive to the Mexican

nationals who also, of course, are Ameri
cans. This bothered me, however,
because it denied the fact that I am from
the U.S.A., of which I am very proud. I
respect Canada, but would have liked
others to acknowledge who I am as I
visit other countries, rather than lump
ing me in with another country.
When I visited Argentina two sum
mers ago, our hosts, their families and
their friends took great offense when we
referred to ourselves as Americans or
americanos. I could understand this con
cern, and I would be offended if a
Chilean came to visit me in Palo Alto
and, when asked where she was from,
announced herself to be "American." It
is true that this denies that I and every
one else not from Chile is American. But

how am I to refer to myself as I travel in
the rest of the Americas?
I could say I am an "United Statian"
or a "Statian." But Mexico also has
states, and that could become confusing.
The truth is, those from Venezuela can
call themselves Venezuelans. Those from
Costa Rica can call themselves Costa
Ricans. But what can I, from the United
States of America, call myself, but an
American?
I am proud of being an American. I
am proud to be a member of the diverse
Americas Deganello describes, but I am
proud to be a U.S.A. American, too. I am
proud that people have come here and
found a place of hope where they can
improve their lives. Despite its many
faults, the United States is a wonderful,

free country. I do not want to deny that
I am from the U.S.A. every time I say I
am "American" and refer also to the vast
area and population that is the Americ
as.
I respect what Deganello has written.
I agree that those from the U.S.A. too
easily forget the rest of the Americans. I
even remember that "human beings out
side this country rightfully consider
themselves of America." But until the
people and the leaders of this country
come up with another, more specific
name for ourselves (and they should), I
cannot see how to practically avoid call
ing myself, as a citizen of the U.S.A., an
"American."
