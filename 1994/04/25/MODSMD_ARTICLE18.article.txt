# Croat's columns about the administration are now boring, repetitive
## 
### 
Hey you. You with the column that
has all the flair of a chemistry Ph.D. dis
sertation. You with the Malcolm X jer
sey, Malcolm X backpack and Malcolm X
boxer shorts. You with the bags under
your eyes from staying up and trying to
figure out how University President
Gerhard Casper and Provost Condoleez
za Rice are plotting to get you this week.
Yeah, you, N'Gai. Lighten up, tiger.
While your latest high-minded assault
on the administration was scathing and
devastating and all, I did not understand
why you included Dean of Admissions
and Financial Aid James Montoya
(N'Gai Croal's April 19 Daily column,
"Pro Fros' guide to getting the scoop on
Stanford"). Stanford has quotas for just
about anything that can break a 700 on
the SAT. The Admissions Office should
be the least of your worries.
As for the rest of your targets, they

were amusingly predictable. There is
certainly a small audience out there for
your incessant blather about institution
al racism, and I suspect you know each
of them personally. However, the rest of
us are yawning. Move on.
Don't you get tired of coming up with
"new angles" on something you've beat
en to death — and beyond — many
months ago? How many "Traitor to the
Color" pieces can you do on poor Rice?
How about a little diversity in your sub
ject matter, N'Gai? You like diversity,
don't you? Redirect your black rage at
something a little less boring. You've
become a parody of yourself. Try cri
tiquing Tish Williams' columns for
racist undertones. I don't recall her ever
writing about making out with a black
person. Perhaps Casper and Rice have
gotten to her. Use that turbo-charged
intellect of yours and investigate.
You seem so unhappy here at Stan
ford, N'Gai. I have the solution for you:
transfer. Get away from Casper and his
oppressive whiteness which keeps you
from being the great person you should
be. I suggest you go to Howard Universi
ty. Sure, the academics make San Jose

State look like Oxford, but at least you
won't have all those nasty white people
after you night and day. Be prepared
though, some of the blacks there may
not be quite black enough for you, you
know, like that ruthless Rice.
If you decide to follow my advice, take
Political Science Prof. John Manley with
you. I have a feeling he needs to get away
from here as much as you do. Maybe
you two can start one of those race riots
which seem to be the current vogue.
Get off the victimhood bandwagon,
N'Gai. It really is boring.
