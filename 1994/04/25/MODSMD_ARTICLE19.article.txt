# Israel is an important part of Jewish culture for many participants

I am writing in response to Rachelle
Marshall's letter to the editor on Friday.
Marshall writes that "it is troubling to
read in [The April 201 Daily that many
exhibits in the Jewish Arts Festival con

vey a message 'reflecting Zionism'." To
my knowledge — as the staff member
responsible for the festival — Marshall
did not attend the opening of the exhib
it, and therefore has no idea as to the .
place of Israel in the festival.
It should also be noted that the contest
was open to students to submit art which
reflected their Jewish experience and the
impact that Judaism has had upon their
lives. We sought no specific themes
beyond that, and the judges themselves
have varying opinions about Israel.
The fact that some of the art did
reflect Jewish students' pride, concern,
struggle, and commitment to the state of
Israel merely exemplifies that fact that
Israel is an important aspect of many
Jewish students' sense of pride, culture
and identity. And the fact that Hillel
refused to censor the exhibition based on
political ideology is testimony to the fact
that Hillel strives to be the Jewish stu
dent center for all Jews; we find strength
in our diversity and celebrate a Judaism
that will thrive into the next millennia.
