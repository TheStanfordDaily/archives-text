# New grade system proposed
## Failing grades, course withdrawals, retakes may be recorded 
### Andy Dworkin Senior staff writer 
Students will face failing grades, just three
weeks to drop or add classes and a stricter poli
cy on retaking courses next year if the Faculty
Senate adopts a new grading system to be in
troduced at its meeting Thursday.
The proposal calls for a more historical tran
script, notes when a class has been retaken and
records withdrawals from classes between the
fourth and eighth week of the quarter. But it
would also permit students to opt for the
pass/no credit option until the sixth week.
The proposed policy grew out of a faculty
survey on grading conducted earlier this year.
The senate is scheduled to hear and discuss the
survey's results this week and vote on the rec
ommendations May 28.

The grading guidelines would create a new
"NP" (not passed) grade that would remain on
students' transcripts if they take a class for a
letter grade and fail. F grades currently do not
appear on student records.
No credit or "NC" would be recorded on
transcripts for courses taken "S/NC," under a
satisfactory/no credit grading system faculty
members can choose for their courses.
Students could elect to take a class "CR/NC,"
a new credit/no credit grade notation to replace
the P/NC option. Students would have to get a
C- or better to get the "CR" or "S" notations,
the same cut-off grade that now stands.
New deadlines
Under the proposed system, the deadline for
electing credit/no credit grading would be
moved from the third to the end of the sixth

week of the quarter.
The new guidelines would only let students
drop classes with no record on their transcript
until the end of three full weeks of classes. Now
students can drop a class with no transcript
record up until the course's final examination.
Students will be allowed to drop courses be
tween the end of the third and eighth full
weeks of classes, but a "W" for withdrawal will
appear on their transcripts.
The deadline for adding classes will be
moved to the same time as the deadline for
dropping classes. Currently, classes can be
added until the seventh week of the quarter.
Courses left incomplete will have to be fin
ished within one year or else an "NP" or "NC"
will be placed on the student's transcript.
A final suggested change affects the policy
on retaking courses. Currently, a
student can retake a course any
number of times and petition to
have their previous perfor
mances in that course wiped
from their records.
The new policy would allow
students to retake a course once
if the student received a grade of
D-f or below, an NC or a W.
Upon retaking the course, the
old grade would be replaced with
the letters "RP" for repeated
course and the credits would be
reduced to zero.
The second grade and credits
for the class would be recorded
on the transcript, but a asterisk
would be placed by the grade to
show that the class had been
retaken.
Students would also be
allowed to retake a course if they
receive a satisfactory grade the
first time, but both grades would
appear on the transcript and no
units would be recorded with the
second grade.
Aims and causes
The proposal arose from sur
veys of faculty conducted in
March and May 1993 by the
Committee on Academic
Appraisal and Achievement, a
subcommittee of the senate.
Of the 732 faculty and lectur
ers who returned the survey, 76
percent of those expressing an
opinion said they favor recording
failing grades on transcripts.
The survey also showed a

strong faculty desire to change
student transcripts from
"records of achievement" into
more "historical records" —
from just list ing when students
succeed at classes to listing
both their successes and fail
ures.
The report lists several objec
tives for the new grading policy.
"The main goal," it says, "was to
produce a grading policy that
encouraged sensible use of pre
cious academic resources . . .
(especially) productive use of
student and faculty time."
The policy also aims to make
transcripts more historical while
"providing some academic for
giveness in recognition of the
errors in judgment freshman can
make. . . (and) the overwhelming
pressure some students feel to
acquire high grades."
A third reason for the policy
was to attempt to counteract
grade inflation — the steady
increase in the percentage of
high letter grades that has
occurred over the past 20 or so
years.
A's and B's made up 77 per
cent of the letter grades assigned
in Stanford classes during the
1968-69 school year, compared to
93 percent last academic year.
Fifty-seven percent of the letter
grades given last year were A's.
And in the School of Educa
tion — the area that tends to give
the highest grades — the average
letter grade for undergraduates
last year was an A-.
Seventy percent of faculty
expressing an opinion agreed
with the assertion that "the pre
ponderance of A grades makes

the indication and reward of
truly excellent student perfor
mances difficult."
The last time Stanford con
ducted a major examination and
overhaul of its grading policies
was during the massive Study of
Education at Stanford, complet
ed in 1968. "It was time to look
anew at the policies," said Assoc.
Dean of Humanities and Sci
ences A 1 Camarillo, a member of
the committee.
The committee report spells
out two guidelines that con
strained the process: the policies
should not impact differently on
people from diverse social and
economic backgrounds and they
should not increase the workload
of the Registrar's Office.
Specific rationales
Each individual suggestion in
the new policy addresses differ
ent issues that concern faculty,
according to the report.
The creation and recording of
the "NP" grade, for example,
aims to make transcripts more
historical and also to rein in
grade inflation by creating a
broader range of grades and eas
ing professors' fears about giving
C's, the report says.
Adding the "NP" should also
prevent students from effectively
dropping courses late in the
quarter by failing them, and keep
students from seeking failing
grades instead of D's to prevent
the D from appearing on their
transcript.
Finally, by recording failures
the proposal aims to keep stu
dents from spending more time
at Stanford to retake classes

dropped late in the quarter, a
practice the report says unfairly
burdens poorer students.
The committee recommended
the "NP" instead of an F grade
because of concern that "some
faculty feel so strongly that the F
is stigmatizing and punitive that
they would not use it,"the report
says.
The proposals to change the
drop and add deadlines were
made partly to reduce the bur
dens on faculty and teaching
assistants caused by students
who drop or add classes late in
the quarter. The changes also
will encourage students to
"make a more careful assess
ment of what they can handle
and will focus their efforts on
fewer courses," the report said.
The goal of the pass/no credit
deadline change is to give stu
dents a greater ability to "fine
tune" their work load, according
to the report. The "W" notation
will help counterbalance the
earlier drop deadline, while
making the transcript more his
torical.
In addition, the report said,
the "W" will discourage students
from withdrawing from a large
number of classes because many
such notations would not look
good on their transcripts.
The changes in the retake
policy are aimed to prevent
cases "where it is clear that peo
ple are taking courses over to
improve the grade from B-range
to A-range grades," Camarillo
said.
Camarillo said he does not
think the new grading policy will
make Stanford students look less

academically able and less com
petitive after they graduate
because other institutions will
know about the grading policy
behind the transcripts.
Even if this were not true,
Camarillo said he believes there
would only be a "marginal differ
ence" in the way students are
perceived.
While the policy came largely
out of consultation with faculty,
especially through the survey,
students did have some input in
the process.
Senior Carleen Chou, who has

been on the committee for the
past three years, said the three
student members of the commit
tee "were definitely respected in
terms of their opinions."
Chou said Geology Prof. Gail
Mahood, the committee's chair,
met with several students
before the survey was drafted
and committee members talked
informally with students they
knew. But the study definitely
was "driven by faculty needs,"
she added.
Mahood could not be reached
for comment yesterday.
Students will face failing grades, just three
weeks to drop or add classes and a stricter poli

aims to make transcripts more
historical and also to rein in
grade inflation by creating a
broader range of grades and eas
ing professors' fears about giving
C's, the report says.
Adding the "NP" should also
prevent students from effectively
dropping courses late in the
quarter by failing them, and keep
students from seeking failing
grades instead of D's to prevent
the D from appearing on their
transcript.
Finally, by recording failures
the proposal aims to keep stu
dents from spending more time
at Stanford to retake classes

dropped late in the quarter, a
practice the report says unfairly
burdens poorer students.
The committee recommended
the "NP" instead of an F grade
because of concern that "some
faculty feel so strongly that the F
is stigmatizing and punitive that
they would not use it,"the report
says.
The proposals to change the
drop and add deadlines were
made partly to reduce the bur
dens on faculty and teaching
assistants caused by students
who drop or add classes late in
the quarter. The changes also
will encourage students to
"make a more careful assess
ment of what they can handle
and will focus their efforts on
fewer courses," the report said.
The goal of the pass/no credit
deadline change is to give stu
dents a greater ability to "fine
tune" their work load, according
to the report. The "W" notation
will help counterbalance the
earlier drop deadline, while
making the transcript more his
torical.
In addition, the report said,
the "W" will discourage students
from withdrawing from a large
number of classes because many
such notations would not look
good on their transcripts.
The changes in the retake
policy are aimed to prevent
cases "where it is clear that peo
ple are taking courses over to
improve the grade from B-range
to A-range grades," Camarillo
said.
Camarillo said he does not
think the new grading policy will
make Stanford students look less

academically able and less com
petitive after they graduate
because other institutions will
know about the grading policy
behind the transcripts.
Even if this were not true,
Camarillo said he believes there
would only be a "marginal differ
ence" in the way students are
perceived.
While the policy came largely
out of consultation with faculty,
especially through the survey,
students did have some input in
the process.
Senior Carleen Chou, who has

been on the committee for the
past three years, said the three
student members of the commit
tee "were definitely respected in
terms of their opinions."
Chou said Geology Prof. Gail
Mahood, the committee's chair,
met with several students
before the survey was drafted
and committee members talked
informally with students they
knew. But the study definitely
was "driven by faculty needs,"
she added.
Mahood could not be reached
for comment yesterday.
Students will face failing grades, just three
weeks to drop or add classes and a stricter poli
cy on retaking courses next year if the Faculty
Senate adopts a new grading system to be in
troduced at its meeting Thursday.
The proposal calls for a more historical tran
script, notes when a class has been retaken and
records withdrawals from classes between the
fourth and eighth week of the quarter. But it
would also permit students to opt for the
pass/no credit option until the sixth week.
The proposed policy grew out of a faculty
survey on grading conducted earlier this year.
The senate is scheduled to hear and discuss the
survey's results this week and vote on the rec
ommendations May 28.

The grading guidelines would create a new
"NP" (not passed) grade that would remain on
students' transcripts if they take a class for a
letter grade and fail. F grades currently do not
appear on student records.
No credit or "NC" would be recorded on
transcripts for courses taken "S/NC," under a
satisfactory/no credit grading system faculty
members can choose for their courses.
Students could elect to take a class "CR/NC,"
a new credit/no credit grade notation to replace
the P/NC option. Students would have to get a
C- or better to get the "CR" or "S" notations,
the same cut-off grade that now stands.
New deadlines
Under the proposed system, the deadline for
electing credit/no credit grading would be
moved from the third to the end of the sixth

week of the quarter.
The new guidelines would only let students
drop classes with no record on their transcript
until the end of three full weeks of classes. Now
students can drop a class with no transcript
record up until the course's final examination.
Students will be allowed to drop courses be
tween the end of the third and eighth full
weeks of classes, but a "W" for withdrawal will
appear on their transcripts.
The deadline for adding classes will be
moved to the same time as the deadline for
dropping classes. Currently, classes can be
added until the seventh week of the quarter.
Courses left incomplete will have to be fin
ished within one year or else an "NP" or "NC"
will be placed on the student's transcript.
A final suggested change affects the policy
on retaking courses. Currently, a
student can retake a course any
number of times and petition to
have their previous perfor
mances in that course wiped
from their records.
The new policy would allow
students to retake a course once
if the student received a grade of
D-f or below, an NC or a W.
Upon retaking the course, the
old grade would be replaced with
the letters "RP" for repeated
course and the credits would be
reduced to zero.
The second grade and credits
for the class would be recorded
on the transcript, but a asterisk
would be placed by the grade to
show that the class had been
retaken.
Students would also be
allowed to retake a course if they
receive a satisfactory grade the
first time, but both grades would
appear on the transcript and no
units would be recorded with the
second grade.
Aims and causes
The proposal arose from sur
veys of faculty conducted in
March and May 1993 by the
Committee on Academic
Appraisal and Achievement, a
subcommittee of the senate.
Of the 732 faculty and lectur
ers who returned the survey, 76
percent of those expressing an
opinion said they favor recording
failing grades on transcripts.
The survey also showed a

strong faculty desire to change
student transcripts from
"records of achievement" into
more "historical records" —
from just list ing when students
succeed at classes to listing
both their successes and fail
ures.
The report lists several objec
tives for the new grading policy.
"The main goal," it says, "was to
produce a grading policy that
encouraged sensible use of pre
cious academic resources . . .
(especially) productive use of
student and faculty time."
The policy also aims to make
transcripts more historical while
"providing some academic for
giveness in recognition of the
errors in judgment freshman can
make. . . (and) the overwhelming
pressure some students feel to
acquire high grades."
A third reason for the policy
was to attempt to counteract
grade inflation — the steady
increase in the percentage of
high letter grades that has
occurred over the past 20 or so
years.
A's and B's made up 77 per
cent of the letter grades assigned
in Stanford classes during the
1968-69 school year, compared to
93 percent last academic year.
Fifty-seven percent of the letter
grades given last year were A's.
And in the School of Educa
tion — the area that tends to give
the highest grades — the average
letter grade for undergraduates
last year was an A-.
Seventy percent of faculty
expressing an opinion agreed
with the assertion that "the pre
ponderance of A grades makes

the indication and reward of
truly excellent student perfor
mances difficult."
The last time Stanford con
ducted a major examination and
overhaul of its grading policies
was during the massive Study of
Education at Stanford, complet
ed in 1968. "It was time to look
anew at the policies," said Assoc.
Dean of Humanities and Sci
ences A 1 Camarillo, a member of
the committee.
The committee report spells
out two guidelines that con
strained the process: the policies
should not impact differently on
people from diverse social and
economic backgrounds and they
should not increase the workload
of the Registrar's Office.

the new policy addresses differ

according to the report.
