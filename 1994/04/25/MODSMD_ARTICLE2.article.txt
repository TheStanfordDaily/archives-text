# New grade system proposed
## Failing grades, course withdrawals, retakes may be recorded 
### Andy Dworkin Senior staff writer 
Students will face failing grades, just three
weeks to drop or add classes and a stricter poli
cy on retaking courses next year if the Faculty
Senate adopts a new grading system to be in
troduced at its meeting Thursday.
The proposal calls for a more historical tran
script, notes when a class has been retaken and
records withdrawals from classes between the
fourth and eighth week of the quarter. But it
would also permit students to opt for the
pass/no credit option until the sixth week.
The proposed policy grew out of a faculty
survey on grading conducted earlier this year.
The senate is scheduled to hear and discuss the
survey's results this week and vote on the rec
ommendations May 28.

The grading guidelines would create a new
"NP" (not passed) grade that would remain on
students' transcripts if they take a class for a
letter grade and fail. F grades currently do not
appear on student records.
No credit or "NC" would be recorded on
transcripts for courses taken "S/NC," under a
satisfactory/no credit grading system faculty
members can choose for their courses.
Students could elect to take a class "CR/NC,"
a new credit/no credit grade notation to replace
the P/NC option. Students would have to get a
C- or better to get the "CR" or "S" notations,
the same cut-off grade that now stands.
New deadlines
Under the proposed system, the deadline for
electing credit/no credit grading would be
moved from the third to the end of the sixth

week of the quarter.
The new guidelines would only let students
drop classes with no record on their transcript
until the end of three full weeks of classes. Now
students can drop a class with no transcript
record up until the course's final examination.
Students will be allowed to drop courses be
tween the end of the third and eighth full
weeks of classes, but a "W" for withdrawal will
appear on their transcripts.
The deadline for adding classes will be
moved to the same time as the deadline for
dropping classes. Currently, classes can be
added until the seventh week of the quarter.
Courses left incomplete will have to be fin
ished within one year or else an "NP" or "NC"
will be placed on the student's transcript.
A final suggested change affects the policy
