## Knocked off the throne Men's gymnastics places 2nd at NCAAs 
### 
Triple flips, triple spins but no
triple crown.
The two-time defending national

champion Stanford
men's gymnastics
team pulled out all
the tricks and posted
a season-high
285.925 points in the
NCAA Championship
finals in Lincoln,
Neb. Saturday
against top-ranked
Nebraska and third
ranked Ohio State.

However, the two-time NCAA run
ner-up Cornhuskers amassed a
288.175-point total over the weekend
to avenge their losses in the past two
NCAA finals. Ohio State's 285.050-
point tally earned third place.
The results mirrored those of the
night before, when Nebraska, Stan
ford and Ohio State qualified for the
NCAA finals in the opening round of
the NCAA Championships with scores
of 287.325, 285.6 and 284.2 respective
ly-
"l knew that this year, the key to

winning would be execution," said
head coach Sadao Hamada. "It wasn't
there — we just didn't execute."
Indeed, Stanford had the guns, but
didn't hit.
In regard to firepower, three Cardi
nal gymnasts finished in the top seven
in all-around competition. Junior tri
captain Josh Stein led the way for
Stanford with a second-place perfor
mance of 57.65 points behind Nebras
ka's Dennis Harrison's 58.2. Senior
tri-captain Mark Booth and junior
Jing-Wei Liang followed in sixth and
seventh place, respectively, with scores
of 57.025 and 56.925. All the gymnasts
featured the required level of difficulty
and flair in their maneuvers to justify
their standings.
However, all three athletes — as
well as other members of the Stanford
squad — might have captured even
greater memories if they had not
missed some of their routines. With
Liang, for instance, the veteran stand
out led the all-around race until his
stint at parallel bars, where he fell off
and was slapped with a 8.90. In the
events before parallel bars — floor
exercises, pommel horse and rings —
he scored no less than 9.70 and earned
a team-high of 9.80 on floor.

Meanwhile, Booth, who qualified
for four individual event champi
onships Saturday evening, soared with
scores ranging from 9.50 on the vault
to 9.75 on pommel horse until he
missed on rings.

'I knew that this year, the
key to winning would be
execution. It wasn't
there — we just didn't
execute.'

"We didn't get off to a strong start
on the pommel horse and rings,"
Booth said. "There was a lot of hard
work and a lot of great individual per
formances, but it was hard to get the
ball rolling after the two events."
Altogether, the Cardinal committed
11 misses, three of which came on
rings. That gave Nebraska more than
enough room to muster an insur
mountable lead. Indeed, although
Stanford trailed the Cornhuskers by a

mere .075-point margin (190.8-
190.875) after four rotations, two key
misses later by the Cardinal on the
high bar allowed Nebraska to slam the
door. For the entire competition, the
Cornhuskers missed only one routine.
"From the last two years, I learned
that you must take chances to win,"
Hamada said. "Gymnastics is a combi
nation of skill and luck. Our strategy
was to take chances — it was going to
be close, and we didn't come [to
NCAAsJ to finish second or third. We
put our best guys last in the rotations,
the guys who could hit 9.90-10.0 rou
tines. Unfortunately, the last guys
missed."
Stanford gymnasts themselves
found no better answer for why they
missed as many routines as they did.
Just a week ago, in an intra-squad
meet mediated by official judges in a
competitive environment, the Cardinal
missed only five routines.
"It was freakish," Booth said. "It
may have been nerves or the higher
status of the meet — I don't know. The
luck just wasn't there."
Although the team in general
expressed disappointment in failing to
