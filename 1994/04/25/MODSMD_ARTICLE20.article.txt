## Knocked off the throne Men's gymnastics places 2nd at NCAAs 
### 
Triple flips, triple spins but no
triple crown.
The two-time defending national

champion Stanford
men's gymnastics
team pulled out all
the tricks and posted
a season-high
285.925 points in the
NCAA Championship
finals in Lincoln,
Neb. Saturday
against top-ranked
Nebraska and third
ranked Ohio State.

However, the two-time NCAA run
ner-up Cornhuskers amassed a
288.175-point total over the weekend
to avenge their losses in the past two
NCAA finals. Ohio State's 285.050-
point tally earned third place.
The results mirrored those of the
night before, when Nebraska, Stan
ford and Ohio State qualified for the
NCAA finals in the opening round of
the NCAA Championships with scores
of 287.325, 285.6 and 284.2 respective
ly-
"l knew that this year, the key to

winning would be execution," said
head coach Sadao Hamada. "It wasn't
there — we just didn't execute."
Indeed, Stanford had the guns, but
didn't hit.
In regard to firepower, three Cardi
nal gymnasts finished in the top seven
in all-around competition. Junior tri
captain Josh Stein led the way for
Stanford with a second-place perfor
mance of 57.65 points behind Nebras
ka's Dennis Harrison's 58.2. Senior
tri-captain Mark Booth and junior
Jing-Wei Liang followed in sixth and
seventh place, respectively, with scores
of 57.025 and 56.925. All the gymnasts
featured the required level of difficulty
and flair in their maneuvers to justify
their standings.
However, all three athletes — as
well as other members of the Stanford
squad — might have captured even
greater memories if they had not
missed some of their routines. With
Liang, for instance, the veteran stand
out led the all-around race until his
stint at parallel bars, where he fell off
and was slapped with a 8.90. In the
events before parallel bars — floor
exercises, pommel horse and rings —
he scored no less than 9.70 and earned
a team-high of 9.80 on floor.

Meanwhile, Booth, who qualified
for four individual event champi
onships Saturday evening, soared with
scores ranging from 9.50 on the vault
to 9.75 on pommel horse until he
missed on rings.

'I knew that this year, the
key to winning would be
execution. It wasn't
there — we just didn't
execute.'
— Sadao Hamada

"We didn't get off to a strong start
on the pommel horse and rings,"
Booth said. "There was a lot of hard
work and a lot of great individual per
formances, but it was hard to get the
ball rolling after the two events."
Altogether, the Cardinal committed
11 misses, three of which came on
rings. That gave Nebraska more than
enough room to muster an insur
mountable lead. Indeed, although
Stanford trailed the Cornhuskers by a

mere .075-point margin (190.8-
190.875) after four rotations, two key
misses later by the Cardinal on the
high bar allowed Nebraska to slam the
door. For the entire competition, the
Cornhuskers missed only one routine.
"From the last two years, I learned
that you must take chances to win,"
Hamada said. "Gymnastics is a combi
nation of skill and luck. Our strategy
was to take chances — it was going to
be close, and we didn't come [to
NCAAsJ to finish second or third. We
put our best guys last in the rotations,
the guys who could hit 9.90-10.0 rou
tines. Unfortunately, the last guys
missed."
Stanford gymnasts themselves
found no better answer for why they
missed as many routines as they did.
Just a week ago, in an intra-squad
meet mediated by official judges in a
competitive environment, the Cardinal
missed only five routines.
"It was freakish," Booth said. "It
may have been nerves or the higher
status of the meet — I don't know. The
luck just wasn't there."
Although the team in general
expressed disappointment in failing to


Booth
secure a third consecutive
national title, the Cardinal did
find points of light at the NCAA
finals and in the season as a
whole.
In terms of team performance
at NCAAs, Stanford did garner a
season-best overall score for the
meet. Also, on the vault and
floor, the Cardinal sprang to a
47.5 and 48.5 respectively. Each
tally was almost a full point

higher than those of both
Nebraska and Ohio State.
"Vault was a definite high
light," Booth said. "It was our
last event, and it was the hardest
event. We never gave in and
scored a point higher than both
the other teams."
Senior tri-captain Chris Sey
said the Cardinal's performance
on the vault demonstrated its
character.
"We knew going into vault
that we were going to finish sec
ond," he said. "But we showed
heart and gave our best perfor
mance of the season."

In addition, Hamada said the
comeback of Liang, who had vir
tually missed the NCAA Western
Regional Championships two
weeks ago due to back pains,
deserves particular note.
"There is no way, in my expe
rience, that an athlete can com
pete two days in a row on six
events in spite of injury," Hama
da said. "Jing-Wei did every
thing right to get himself back to
the competition floor. He worked
through the pain during the
meet and did very well even
though he was hurting like
crazy. I really- have to admire

him."
Finally, Hamada and the
seniors on the team all found
solace in a sense of fulfillment.
"I'm not only trying to teach
skills to these guys," Hamada
said. "In the mid '70s, I thought
I was hired to win NCAAs.
That's all I cared about, and the
kids were quitting and getting
hurt. I came to realize that I
wanted to take care of the guys
and help them learn about life in
general. Especially with the guys
who are leaving, I hope they
have learned a great deal. I'm
confident with each one that

they are prepared for life beyond
Stanford. I established my goals
in that respect. Though we lost, I
have no regrets."
While their coach spoke of
intangibles, the seniors found
comfort in their gymnastics per
formances themselves.
"Second place was great,"
Booth said. "There's nothing to
be ashamed of. We competed
with great pride and dignity. I
competed all-around for two
days and savored every moment.
I leave with nothing but fond
memories."
Sey's praises went further

than Booth, remarking that the
1994 season was nothing short
of phenomenal.
"It was amazing to get sec
ond," he said. "Except for me
and Josh, everyone else had less
experience at NCAAs. This was
Jing-Wei's second, and it was
Mark's second, and for everyone
else, this was their first time. On
the other hand, Nebraska's top
five guys each have had four
years at NCAAs. We didn't have
a Jair Lynch this year, and still
we got second. That's terrific. It
was a great experience to be a
part of."
