# Cardinal ambushed by Bruins in three games
## Stanford now fights for Final Four bid 
### Kathryn Yang Senior staff writer 
No team has ever dominated a sport
like UCLA has dominated men's vol
leyball.
Over the weekend, the top-ranked
Bruins had 2,322 fans uttering that
same statement after a blowout of No.
2 Stanford 15-5, 15-4, 15-7 in the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
Championship Tournament in Maples
Pavilion.
Dominating the net from start to
finish, the Bruins presented a night
mare for the Cardinal hitters. UCLA
coasted through the all three games
without breaking a sweat by out-block
ing Stanford 15-5 and out-hitting the
Cardinal .500 to .249.
"It's not that they're good at this or
good at that, UCLA is just a good vol
leyball team overall," said Stanford
head coach Ruben Nieves.
With junior opposite hitter Jeff
Nygaard leading the offense, any team
can be the best in the nation. On Sat
urday, Nygaard showed off his All-
American talent to the tune of 25 kills,
a .556 hitting percentage and six blocks
on the night — including consecutive
three stuffs to end the final game.
Nygaard, the MPSF Player of the
Year and favorite for National Player
of the Year honors, made a difference
in every aspect of UCIJVs game.
"He hurt us in so many ways,"
Nieves said. "He was digging the ball,

hitting, blocking and even passing
our jump serves. I think Canyon
[Cemanl hit some great jump
serves down the line and into the
corner, but Nygaard passed all
but one of them."
Ceman, last year's National
Player of the Year, also showered
praise upon his opponent. "I've
never been hit over before, and
Nygaard hit a backrow ball and he
hit it straight over me. So, frankly
I don't know what any team can
do about him. Other teams just
have to hope he has a bad night,
and even then they probably
won't stop him."
However, despite the obvious
impact Nygaard had, the Cardinal

also self-destructed with 27 hit
ting errors (compared to UCLA's
14). Trying to hit above and
beyond the Bruin block, Stan
ford's top spiker Matt Fuer
bringer had 16 kills at the expense
of 11 errors for a sub-par .147
showing.
"I think our mistake was try
ing to avoid the block, and we
ended up hitting out a lot," Nieves
said. "They got a lot more points
on us hitting the balls out than
they got from actually stuffing
the ball themselves."
To some extent, sophomore
swing hitter Mike Lambert
repaired that damage by swinging
for 22 kills and a tremendous .531
average, but even he admitted the
UCLA block was intimidating.
"They put up a pretty imposing
wall, but I was just trying to hit as
hard as I could, and luckily I

found a couple of holes," he said.
Lambert was the catalyst dur
ing the Cardinal's 5-1 comeback
run to open the final game of the
match. Waking up the crowd with
two consecutive spikes, Stanford
forced Bruins coach A 1 Scates to
take a time-out and send in a
replacement before UCLA finally
got back on track.
The Bruins then snuffed Stan
ford's rally, as the Cardinal stag
nated at five points for a dozen
rotations. After missing three
consecutive serves, the Cardinal
could only stand and watch as the
Bruins rattled off seven points to
take the lead at 8-5 for the even
tual 15-7 winner.
"Obviously yes, we got killed,
but not in the way we played, just
in the final outcome," Ceman
said. "If we play like that against
most teams, we'll win, but that
won't happen against UCLA. I
couldn't think of one thing they
did wrong during that match."
With that victory, UCLA (26-1)
has confirmed its ticket to the
Final Four, while the Cardinal
(18-9) will re-enter the round
robin tournament and fight for
the wild-card playoff spot.
Although no losing team from
the championship match has ever
gone on to secure the wild-card
bid, the Cardinal will try to do just
that with a semifinal match
against No. 6 Pepperdine tonight
at 7 p.m.
"The loser of the championship
match is in the best position to
win the tournament," Nieves
said. "I know history doesn't say
that, but I'm not superstitious. I
like looking at the facts, and the
facts say we're the highest
remaining seed and we're playing
the lowest remaining seed on our
home court. I think our chances
are excellent."

like UCLA has dominated men's vol
leyball.
Over the weekend, the top-ranked
Bruins had 2,322 fans uttering that
same statement after a blowout of No.
2 Stanford 15-5, 15-4, 15-7 in the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
Championship Tournament in Maples
Pavilion.
Dominating the net from start to
finish, the Bruins presented a night
mare for the Cardinal hitters. UCLA
coasted through the all three games
without breaking a sweat by out-block
ing Stanford 15-5 and out-hitting the
Cardinal .500 to .249.
"It's not that they're good at this or
good at that, UCLA is just a good vol
leyball team overall," said Stanford
head coach Ruben Nieves.
With junior opposite hitter Jeff
Nygaard leading the offense, any team
can be the best in the nation. On Sat
urday, Nygaard showed off his All-
American talent to the tune of 25 kills,
a .556 hitting percentage and six blocks
on the night — including consecutive
three stuffs to end the final game.
Nygaard, the MPSF Player of the
Year and favorite for National Player
of the Year honors, made a difference
in every aspect of UCIJVs game.
"He hurt us in so many ways,"
Nieves said. "He was digging the ball,

hitting, blocking and even passing
our jump serves. I think Canyon
[Cemanl hit some great jump
serves down the line and into the
corner, but Nygaard passed all
but one of them."
Ceman, last year's National
Player of the Year, also showered
praise upon his opponent. "I've
never been hit over before, and
Nygaard hit a backrow ball and he
hit it straight over me. So, frankly
I don't know what any team can
do about him. Other teams just
have to hope he has a bad night,
and even then they probably
won't stop him."
However, despite the obvious
impact Nygaard had, the Cardinal

also self-destructed with 27 hit
ting errors (compared to UCLA's
14). Trying to hit above and
beyond the Bruin block, Stan
ford's top spiker Matt Fuer
bringer had 16 kills at the expense
of 11 errors for a sub-par .147
showing.
"I think our mistake was try
ing to avoid the block, and we
ended up hitting out a lot," Nieves
said. "They got a lot more points
on us hitting the balls out than
they got from actually stuffing
the ball themselves."
To some extent, sophomore
swing hitter Mike Lambert
repaired that damage by swinging
for 22 kills and a tremendous .531
average, but even he admitted the
UCLA block was intimidating.
"They put up a pretty imposing
wall, but I was just trying to hit as
hard as I could, and luckily I

found a couple of holes," he said.
Lambert was the catalyst dur
ing the Cardinal's 5-1 comeback
run to open the final game of the
match. Waking up the crowd with
two consecutive spikes, Stanford
forced Bruins coach A 1 Scates to
take a time-out and send in a
replacement before UCLA finally
got back on track.
The Bruins then snuffed Stan
ford's rally, as the Cardinal stag
nated at five points for a dozen
rotations. After missing three
consecutive serves, the Cardinal
could only stand and watch as the
Bruins rattled off seven points to
take the lead at 8-5 for the even
tual 15-7 winner.
"Obviously yes, we got killed,
but not in the way we played, just
in the final outcome," Ceman
said. "If we play like that against
most teams, we'll win, but that
won't happen against UCLA. I
couldn't think of one thing they
did wrong during that match."
With that victory, UCLA (26-1)
has confirmed its ticket to the
Final Four, while the Cardinal
(18-9) will re-enter the round
robin tournament and fight for
the wild-card playoff spot.
Although no losing team from
the championship match has ever
gone on to secure the wild-card
bid, the Cardinal will try to do just
that with a semifinal match
against No. 6 Pepperdine tonight
at 7 p.m.
"The loser of the championship
match is in the best position to
win the tournament," Nieves
said. "I know history doesn't say
that, but I'm not superstitious. I
like looking at the facts, and the
facts say we're the highest
remaining seed and we're playing
the lowest remaining seed on our
home court. I think our chances
are excellent."
