# De Silva wins Pac-10 title
## Frosh surprises higher seeds 
### Sam Wu Staff writer Rob Ross Senior staff writer 
"Have you heard about Sandra?"
That was the question on the tips of all of the
Stanford women's tennis players' tongues. The
exchanges went something like the following:
"Kristine, how were the Ojai Pacific 10 Champi
onships?"
"Fine, but did you hear what Sandra did?"
Or even, "Coach Brennan, how did your Cardinal
team do in Ojai?"
"Super, do you know about Sandra?"
That would be Sandra De Silva, freshman
women's tennis player. Sandra De Silva, Stanford's
No. 6 singles player who was not even scheduled to
participate in the Invitational draw. Sandra De
Silva, the 77th-ranked player in the nation, who was
slated to play No. 32, No. 15 and No. 7 on her way to
the finals.
That would be Sandra De Silva, the 1994 Pac-10
Singles Champion.
"This is pretty overwhelming evidence that we
have underrated her," head coach Frank Brennan
said of his former No. 6 player. "We will move her
up, but I don't know where."
De Silva blazed her way through some of the best
players in the toughest conference in the nation to
capture this unexpected crown. She began her quest
with a 6-3, 6-4 flailing of Keri Phebus.
Ranked 15th in the country, Phebus has held
down the No. 1 singles spot for the eighth-ranked
Bruins and was expected to make
easy work of this Cardinal fresh
man who only was able to make the
Invitational draw due to injuries of

other higher ranked players. Hut
De Silva dealt quickly with this
Bruin star, using her hard-hitting
groundstrokes to keep Wiebus
away from the net and, ultimately,
out of the tournament.
"I found out the night before I was
in the tournament," De Silva said.
"So there was really no pressure."

The story remained the same as
De Silva carved a path to the
finals. In each match, the frosh
took a higher-ranked, more experi
enced player and disposed of them
as quickly as possible. Next on the
list was Petra Schmitt, USC's No.
1. She was dispatched 4-6, 6-3, 6-2.
A parade of Hears followed

Schmitt. First came California's
unranked Angela Nelson, who fell
quickly in the round of eight, 6-2,
6-2. Teammate Jennifer Poulos,
just off a three-set victory over
Stanford's Kim Shasby, took the
next swing at De Silva, and had
even worse luck. De Silva declawed
this Bear, ranked seventh in the
country, by a score of 6-1, 6-1.
"It was a match of two good
fighters," Brennan said. "Finally,
Sandra just marched through her.
It looked to me as if Poulos kept
wondering 'can (De Silval really
keep doing this?' "
In the finals De Silva matched
up against a third Cal player, Pam
Nelson. Ranked 32nd in the
nation, Nelson upset Stanford's
Laxmi Poruri in the semifinals 6-
1, 6-3. Losing for only the second
time on the season, Poruri was the
top seed in the tournament and
the ranked No. 1 in the nation.
"I just had a bad day,"the senior
captain said. "I think I lost the
match. I don't think she won it."
But this impressive pedigree did
not phase the freshman. After
dropping the first set 6-2, De Silva
swept through the next two 6-0, 6-
4, winning ten straight games in
the process and thereby becoming
the most unlikely Pac-10 champi
on in recent memory.
"I was overwhelmed in the first
set, the stands were packed and I
couldn't concentrate," De Silva
said. "Maybe I was just a little ner
vous."
Other Cardinal players, though
not as successful as De Silva, also
performed well at Ojai. Freshman
Katie Schlukebir, who plays No. 3
singles for Stanford, knocked off
Cal's Nicole Klliot in three sets in
the first round, then followed that
performance with another three

set victory over Arizona's No. I
player Celine Verdier. This victory
was an upset of sorts for Schluke
bir, as Verdier is ranked 10 slots
ahead of her nationally.
But Schlukebir could not pull off
the next task. Pitted against team
mate Poruri in the quarterfinals,
Schlukebir fell in two sets 6-3, 6-4.
"Celine's a good player. It felt
good to beat her," Schlukebir said.
"Against Laxmi, I worked on dif
ferent things, like coming to the
net more."
Shasby also ventured into the
quarterfinals with Poruri,
Schlukebir and De Silva. In the
process, Shasby picked up wins
against Arizona's Michelle Old
ham and USC's Maggie Simkova,
both in two sets. The sophomore
was then ambushed in three by
Poulos, 0-6, 6-1,6-1.
Rounding out the Cardinal lad
der, No. 5 singles player Beth
Berris got a first-round victory
over Wildcat Stephanie Sammari
tano before getting dropped by
finalist Nelson 6-0, 6-3.
"Pam Nelson is an old rival,"
Berris said. "It was a good match,
much closer than the score indi
cates."
The only blemish on the Cardi
nal's first-round record was senior
Kristine Kurth, Stanford's No. 2
singles player. The victim of a less
than-favorable draw, Kurth was
matched against Arizona State's
Kori Davidson, the 11th ranked
player in the nation. Kurth was
shut out in the first set 6-0, but by
changing pace and mixing up her
shots, the senior won the second
set in a tie-breaker. She was
unable to carry this momentum
into the third, losing the set 7-5,
and with it, the match.
"I was down 5-3 match point in

the third, and I got it back to 5-
all," Kurth said. "But then she hit
four winners in a row and won the
next two games."
In doubles, Stanford entered
two teams in the 16-slot Pac-10
Championship tournament. The
Cardinal's No. 2 team of Kurth-
Berris won their first round game,
then lost a tight three-setter to the
Bruin duo of Phebus-Susie Star
rett 3-6, 7-6, 7-5.
"We played really well," Berris
said. "It was one of the best match
es we've played all year."
The highly regarded and unde
feated No. 1 pair of Poruri-
Schlukebir fought their way to the
semifinals before slipping to the
Bears' duo of Pam Nelson-Keirsten
Alley. The Stanford duo had beaten
this Cal squad twice during the
regular season, but in this tourna
ment, the results were different.
"Neither of us played great,"
Schlukebir said. "We just didn't
have the drive to put in the extra
effort. They both wanted it more
than we did."
Brennan entered his other
three players — Emma Wood
house, Emily Burt and Wendy
Sacks — into the Open Invitation
al division. Tearing up the first
three rounds, all three made it to
the semi-finals, where Sacks
defeated Burt in three close sets.
Woodhouse also advanced, setting
the stage for an all-Cardinal final.
Youth emerged victorious from
that final as Sacks pulled out a
tedious win 6-3, 5-7, 6-3.
But the hero of Ojai remains
freshman Sandra De Silva.
"I just wanted to play as well as
I could," she said. "I had no expec
tations and there were no expecta
tions of me. I just went out there
and played game by game."
