## Cardinal at top of Six-Pac standings

First, at last.
Sweeping three games from
the Arizona Wildcats at Sunken
Diamond and receiving a well
timed assist from UCLA, the No.
9 Cardinal baseball team this
weekend grabbed first place in the
Pacific 10 Conference Southern
Division for the first time this
season.
Picking apart the Wildcats Fri
day for an 8-3 victory, Stanford
(30-16, 17-7 in the Six-Pac)
remained one-half game back of
USC, which defeated its archrival
in Los Angeles. But the Cardinal

scooted into a first-place tie Sat
urday despite having its .contest
rained out, as the Bruins rallied
in the ninth inning to defeat the
Trojans (32-13, 18-9), who now
stand two games back of Stanford
in the loss column.
The Cardinal then took mat
ters into its own hands yesterday,
sweeping a make-up doublehead
er, 10-3 and 5-1, from the woeful
Wildcats (9-35, 5-19), while USC
won its rubber match down
south.
"A sweep right now is so big,
because we can control our own
destiny," said Stanford sophomore
