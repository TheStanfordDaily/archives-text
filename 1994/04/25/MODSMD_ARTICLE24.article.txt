# Baseball humiliates Arizona in three-game sweep
## Cardinal at top of Six-Pac standings 
### Andy Eiser Senior staff writer 
First, at last.
Sweeping three games from
the Arizona Wildcats at Sunken
Diamond and receiving a well
timed assist from UCLA, the No.
9 Cardinal baseball team this
weekend grabbed first place in the
Pacific 10 Conference Southern
Division for the first time this
season.
Picking apart the Wildcats Fri
day for an 8-3 victory, Stanford
(30-16, 17-7 in the Six-Pac)
remained one-half game back of
USC, which defeated its archrival
in Los Angeles. But the Cardinal

scooted into a first-place tie Sat
urday despite having its .contest
rained out, as the Bruins rallied
in the ninth inning to defeat the
Trojans (32-13, 18-9), who now
stand two games back of Stanford
in the loss column.
The Cardinal then took mat
ters into its own hands yesterday,
sweeping a make-up doublehead
er, 10-3 and 5-1, from the woeful
Wildcats (9-35, 5-19), while USC
won its rubber match down
south.
"A sweep right now is so big,
because we can control our own
destiny," said Stanford sophomore

Sophomore Dan Reed gets ready to hurl one In Friday's 8-3 trouncing of Arizona. Reed left the mound
after striking out 10 batters in more than six innings. The Cardinal swept the Wildcats in the series at
Sunken Diamond.
catcher A.J. Hinch. "We hold the
outcome of the conference race in
our hands."
Cardinal starting pitchers con
tinued to dazzle, combining for 22
solid innings in three days, but
Stanford's bats ensured a com
fortable margin of victory each
game by pounding Arizona pitch
ing from the outset. Responding
to an RBI single by Wildcat junior
third baseman Chris Cooper in the
top of the first inning Friday,
Stanford unleashed a ferocious
two-out, four-run rally to give
sophomore starter Dan Reed (9-2)
all the support he would need.
After Arizona sophomore
starter Steve Arffa (1-6) recorded
what would be his only two outs of
the day, Cardinal junior catcher
A.J. Hinch ripped a double down
the left-field line. Arffa then hit
senior designated hitter Nate Olm
stead with a pitch, and allowed the
runners to advance to second and
third on a wild pitch.
The Wildcats pitched around

junior first baseman Dusty Allen,
walking him to load the bases for
sophomore rightfielder Brodie Van
Wagenen, who unloaded a three
run double to the left-centerfield
gap and took third on an erroi\
"I saw that the wind was blow
ing out to left field, so I could bene
fit by pulling the ball," said the
right-handed hitter Van Wagenen.
"I was sitting on the fastball, and 1
got one right where I wanted it, on
the inner part of the plate."
Junior leftfielder Steve Carver
followed with a single to left, driv
ing home Van Wagenen and chas
ing Arffa, who saw his team-lead
ing earned-run average balloon
from 4.25 to 4.86.
Van Wagenen and Carver
teamed up again in the third
inning, punching a single and a
double for a run off sophomore
reliever Tod Brown to make it 5-1
Stanford. Wildcat sophomore
catcher Scott Frisbee led off the
seventh with a home run to close
the gap to three, but Hinch touched
Brown with a two-run shot over the
left field fence in the bottom of the
inning to put the game out of reach.
"It was a fastball inside, and
coach fDean] Stotz had told me to

crowd the plate a little bit so that
they would be drawn to pitching
me inside," Hinch said. "Look
what happened."
The teams traded single runs in
their last at-bats, as sophomore
centerfielder Cale Carter drove
home the Cardinal's last run on a
double in the eighth and Arizona
sophomore second baseman Scott
Kidd singled home the Wildcats'
final tally in the ninth. Stanford
freshman Tom Reimers pitched
the final three innings for his sev
enth save to preserve the win for
Reed, who departed after striking
out 10 in six-plus innings.
Wintry weather stopped play on
Saturday, but could not cool the
Cardinal down yesterday. In the
opener, sophomore starter Todd
Bartels (5-2) made what could have
been a marathon afternoon shorter
by tossing his second complete
game of the year in just over two
hours. Meanwhile, Bartels' team
mates jumped on Arizona sopho
more Ben White (2-7) for eight runs
on just four hits in 4-2/3 innings en
route to a 10-3 Stanford victory.
The Wildcats again raced to a 1-
0 lead in the first, as junior center
fielder Menno Wickey crushed a

Bartels offering for his team-lead
ing third home run of the season
with two outs. But the Cardinal
clawed back, scoring two runs
before White could retire a batter.
Sophomore third baseman
Brian Dallimore led off with an
infield single, and, after junior sec
ond baseman Jed Hansen walked,
Hinch grounded a single to left to
score Dallimore. A wild pitch then
scored Hansen with the second
Stanford run.
Hinch collected his fourth RBI of
the weekend on a groundout in the
third inning, but Arizona sopho
more first baseman Matt Lake
erased it with a solo blast in the top
of the fourth to close to 3-2.
The Cardinal then took advan
tage of a tiring White and sagging
Wildcat defense to plate six runs on
two hits and two errors in the fifth.
After a Hansen sacrifice fly scored
Carter and Olmstead drove in a
run on a fielder's choice, White
intentionally walked Allen to get to
Van Wagenen, who also walked to
load the bases. Senior reliever Rich
Tomey came on to stop the rally,
but Carver took his first pitch over
the right-field wall for his first
career grand slam.
"I figured with the bases loaded
he wouldn't waste any pitches or
risk walking me," Carver said. "I
sat on the fastball, and I knew I hit
it well, but with the wind blowing in
from right field I thought at first
that it would hit the fence."
Carver's third home run of the
year traveled further than that,
and the Cardinal found itself sit
ting on an insurmountable 9-2
lead. The final margin would be
seven runs, as an Olmstead RBI
single in the sixth and a Cooper
home run in the ninth provided
the contest's final runs.
Stanford struck first in yester
day's nightcap, pushing across
three runs with two outs in the
first inning on Arizona junior
starter Ryan Frace (1-5). After
Hinch walked, Olmstead lined a
single to right, the first of his four
hits on the game. Allen then sent
his team-leading seventh home
run towering over the trees beyond
the left-field fence.
Stanford freshman starter
Jason Middlebrook (6-1) impressed
several scouts on hand, going seven
innings and striking out nine while
tipping the radar guns at 97 miles
per hour with his blazing fastball.
Junior Matt Marenghi shut Ari
zona down over the final two
frames to earn his fifth save.
