# Relief pitching there when needed
## 
### Swaminatha Gurudevan Staff writer 
How does the Stanford baseball
team spell relief? R-E-I-M-E-R-S.
During the Cardinal's three
game sweep of Arizona over the
weekend, Stanford relief pitching
put in solid performances whenev
er called open and extinguished
almost all Wildcat rallies while
adding strength to an already
impressive starting rotation.
In the seventh inning of Fri
day's game, freshman righthander
Tom Reimers entered the game

with Stanford ahead 5-3. Arizona
appeared to have finally reached
Cardinal starter Dan Reed, scoring
a run in the inning and putting
runners on first and second with
no outs.
However, as he has done all sea
son, Reimers quickly slammed the
door shut on the Wildcats, induc
ing a fly ball and a 6-4-3 double
play to allow the Cardinal to escape
the inning unscathed and fuel a
back-breaking two-run Stanford
rally in the bottom of the inning.
"That's basically my job,"
Reimers said. "I've got to throw
strikes, but they've still got to be
nasty."
Reimers allowed only one run in
three innings of relief to earn his
fifth save of the season. Cardinal
coach Mark Marquess said he
believes Reimers' excellent perfor
mance was the difference in Fri
day's game.
"I think that was the game,"
Marquess said. "[Arizona] had first
and second, no outs and we got a
fly ball and a double play. That's
where they could have gotten back
into the game and Tom did a great
job."
After Todd Bartels pitched com
plete game, seven-hit performance
in the first game on Sunday, the
bullpen once again made its pres
ence felt in the second game.
Righthander Matt Marenghi
entered the game in the eighth

inning with Stanford leading 4-1,
after seven spectacular four-hit
innings by starter Jason Middle
brook. Marenghi preserved Mid
dlebrook's momentum, blanking
the Wildcats for two innings and
allowing only one hit while striking
out one to pick up his fourth save.
"I'm really impressed with
Matt," Marquess said. "I think
Matt has really been one of our bet
ter pitchers the last three or four
weeks â€” he's focused and he's
throwing great pitches in great
locations."
Stanford's excellent relief per
formance was especially impres
sive in light of strong winds blow
ing out of Sunken Diamond all
weekend that turned many deep
fly balls into home runs.
During the three-game set,
Stanford hit three home runs
while Arizona, considered a light
hitting team with only eight total
home runs entering the series,
belted five solo shots all to left field.
"I think the pitching staff was
extraordinary this whole week
end," Marquess said.
