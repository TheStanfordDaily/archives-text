# Relief pitching there when needed
## 
### Swaminatha Gurudevan Staff writer 
How does the Stanford baseball
team spell relief? R-E-I-M-E-R-S.
During the Cardinal's three
game sweep of Arizona over the
weekend, Stanford relief pitching
put in solid performances whenev
er called open and extinguished
almost all Wildcat rallies while
adding strength to an already
impressive starting rotation.
In the seventh inning of Fri
day's game, freshman righthander
Tom Reimers entered the game

with Stanford ahead 5-3. Arizona
appeared to have finally reached
Cardinal starter Dan Reed, scoring
a run in the inning and putting
runners on first and second with
no outs.
However, as he has done all sea
son, Reimers quickly slammed the
door shut on the Wildcats, induc
ing a fly ball and a 6-4-3 double
play to allow the Cardinal to escape
the inning unscathed and fuel a
back-breaking two-run Stanford
rally in the bottom of the inning.
