# Men's golf nabs third in tourney
## Martin leads Cardinal charge 
### Andrew Blachman Staff writer 
Stanford men's golf coach Wally
Goodwin found a lot to be opti
mistic about despite the No. 2-
ranked Cardinal's third-place fin
ish in the U.S. Intercollegiate Golf
Tournament.
"We really came along this
weekend," he said. "I was con
cerned that we had to get tougher
as a team and we did. We played
some good golf â€” it may not have
been winning golf, but it was still
good golf and I was proud of the
guys."
Despite solid performances
from all five Cardinal golfers,
Stanford finished the three-round
tournament at the Stanford Golf
Course behind two other Pacific 10
Conference teams, Arizona State
and Oregon State. Six more confer
ence foes competed, making the
U.S. Intercollegiate tournament a

preview of next week's Pac-10
Championships in Tucson, Ariz.
The Sun Devils, led by individu
al champion Todd Demsey, shot an
opening round of 285 and cruised
from there, winning the tourna
ment by 11 strokes. Oregon State,
the surprise team of the tourna
ment, edged the Cardinal by one
stroke for second place in the
windy conditions at Stanford.
Junior Casey Martin led the
Cardinal with a three-round total
of 213, good enough for fourth
place overall, but three strokes shy
of Demsey. Junior William Yanigi
sawa finished second for Stanford
and 18th overall with a total of
218.
Next weekend's Pac-10 Cham
pionships will be the Cardinal's
final competition before the NCAA
Regionals May 19-21. The streak
ing Sun Devils appear to be the
favorites but Stanford and Ari
zona, the one team absent from the
U.S. Intercollegiates, could chal
lenge for the title, according to
Goodwin.
Since Stanford will be allowed to
send six golfers to the Pac-10
Championships instead of the
usual five, junior Darren
Dragovich will be heading with the
team to Tucson. Dragovich shot a
three-round 221, including first

and third-round scores of 72, to
beat out freshman Conrad Ray.
Goodwin, however, downplayed
the importance of next week's
tournament.
"Basically, it's just another
tournament," he said. "It means a
little bit in terms of bragging rights
but we're just looking at it as a way
to get ready for the important
NCAA action ahead."
In fact, the Cardinal has likely
already guaranteed itself a spot in
the NCAA Regionals by being
among the top 12 teams in District
8. The tournament could serve as a
sign of how far Stanford has come

since a ninth-place conference fin
ish last season.
"Our entire season has been a
story of getting ready to get ready,"
said Goodwin. "In college golf,
rankings don't mean a whole lot,
it's how you do in the NCAAs that
matters."
Nine of the 18 teams in the
NCAA Regionals will advance to
the finals in Dallas, Texas, June 2-
4 and, if all goes well, the Cardinal
should be among them.
"On paper,- it looks like we're
going to the NCAA finals," said
Goodwin. "But sports aren't played
on paper."
