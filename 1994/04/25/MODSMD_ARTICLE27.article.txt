# Violence in the media
## Panel debates effects, possible regulations of TV 
### Emily Bazar Staff writer 
The scene: an urban high
school, overrun with gang vio
lence. Racially-based gangs "rum
ble" in the cafeteria. The gang
members draw knives, students
are brutally murdered and the
first part of a TV miniseries fades
to black.
In a lively and sometimes con
tentious debate at Kresge Audito
rium Saturday, 10 panelists dis
cussing violence in the media dis
agreed over whether they would
air the second part of the imagi
nary series after the first install
ment hypothetically incited out
breaks of violence across the
nation.
Law Prof. Kathleen Sullivan
moderated the discussion, posing
as a scriptwriter going through
the process of creating and pro
ducing the miniseries.
The panelists, responding to
the scenario, immediately illus
trated the issue's divisiveness by
disagreeing over the notion that
violence in the media is itself
harmful.
"I don't see any consensus that
there is a causal connection
between violence on television
and actual violent behavior," said
Nadine Strossen, president of the
American Civil Liberties Union.

Strossen said contemporary
American society continues to
scapegoat speech and images
without addressing "actual" soci
etal problems such as guns.
Peggy Charren, former direc
tor of Action for Children's Tele
vision, added that depictions of
violence may have benefits for
viewers — especially children.
"Violence should be nauseat
ing," said Charren. "If kids think
that there's no consequence to
violence, then they won't learn
that violence is wrong."
But screen and television writ
er Paul Attanasio said he believes
media violence directly con
tributes to society's problems. As
a rule, Attanasio said he turns
down jobs which involve excessive
or gratuitous violence.
"I can't take guns out of peo
ple's hands. But I can take guns
out of my shows and movies,"
added Attanasio.
Terry Rakolta, president of
Americans for Responsible Tele
vision, agreed that violence in the
media is harmful because it can
incite violence in viewers.
But some efforts have already
been made to placate concerned
viewers. Most networks have
warning labels which alert the
audience of potentially objection
able and violent content.
Concerning the warnings,

Showtime Network Chairman
Winston Cox said that "giving the
viewer the content of the show is
not only good, but it's a responsi
bility."
Rakolta said advisory labels
are a "band-aid solution" and
called for a safe harbor time
between 4 p.m. and 9 p.m. when
violence would be prohibited on
television. These are times when
children have the most exposure
and accessibility to television, she
said.
Panelists offered other solu
tions such as the V-chip, a tech
nological device which would give
parents the power to block violent
programs out.
Echoing the majority of pan
elists, Communication Prof. Don
ald Roberts said he is "against
government intervention" to curb
violence in the media.
Assistant Attorney General
Eleanor Acheson agreed, adding
that "the Attorney General
doesn't believe in a legislative
solution to this. She's looking to
the industry to self-regulate."
Other panelists included
Christopher Wright, deputy gen
eral counsel to the Federal Com
munications Commission; actor
Alan Rosenberg and media execu
tive William Croasdale. The dis
cussion was sponsored by the
Stanford Law Review.
