# For the record

In an article about a Native
American lesbian poet in Fri
day's Daily, the poet's name was
misspelled. The correct spelling
is Chrystos. In addition, it incor
rectly implied that the quotation
"Go build a McDonald's some
where else" was from her poem.
The final sentence should have
read: "Referring to herself as a
'whore with the heart of a
marsh mallow,' she read some
poems of shockingly honest
eroticism, many of which appear
in her latest published work,
titled 'In Her I Am.' "
