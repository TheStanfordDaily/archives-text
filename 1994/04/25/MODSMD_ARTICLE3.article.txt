# Taylor to leave Stanford
## Econ 1 guru to be 'a '90s kind of guy' 
### Sarah Katz Editorial staff 
After five years as one of the
most popular Economics 1 lectur
ers on campus, Tim Taylor's rea
sons for leaving Stanford are as
straightforward as the principle
of supply and demand.
"My wife is getting an MBA
and graduating in June and she
accepted a job with a company in
Minneapolis," Taylor said. "I'm
going to go off and be a '90s kind
of guy and have my wife support
me.
Although Taylor taught the in
troductory economics course for
four of his five years at Stanford,
his full-time campus job is as
managing editor for the Journal
of Economic Perspectives. The
journal will be moving to Min
nesota with him.
The journal is funded by the
American Economics Associa
tion, and the money "is funneled
through Stanford but can be fun
neled through any university,"
Taylor said, adding that the jour
nal was formerly at Princeton.
"I've moved it once before; I
know it'll work out," he said. "I'm
getting a dry-run" this week, as
the Economics Department
moves from Encina Hall to its
new building near Memorial
Auditorium.
Taylor said he is currently
negotiating with the University of
Minnesota to see if their offices
can house the publication, which
prints articles from economics
professors and Ph.D.s.
Despite his "peculiar status"
as a journal editor rather than a
professor, Taylor said he enjoys
teaching. "I felt badly I didn't get
a chance this year," he said.
Whether Taylor will teach at
Minnesota is "unclear," he said.
"I'd be interested but it depends on
what I can negotiate at that end."
Economics Prof. David Star
rett, the department chair, called
Taylor "one of the best teachers
we ever had in Econ 1. .. . We're
very sorry he's leaving — he's
been an awfully good person and
an excellent teacher."
Although Taylor only taught

Economics 1, Starrett said the
department had also hoped to
have him teach Economics 101, a
writing course, because of his
background as a journalist. "Now
that he's leaving, we won't do
that," Starrett said.
Others echoed Starrett's
praise. "It's a really big loss," said
Dean of Humanities and Sciences

John Shoven, a former depart
ment chair. "He's a terrific teach
er — one of the best."
Taylor was originally brought
to Stanford with the Journal of
Economic Perspectives by then
editor and Economics Prof.
Joseph Stiglitz. Stiglitz has since
left the University to become a
member of President Clinton's
Council of Economic Advisors.
"I had a nice time here. There
are good students and good people
in general," Taylor said, adding
that "whenever you think about
moving from this climate to Min
nesota you have to shake a little
bit."
The decision was made easier
for Taylor because his family lives
in Minneapolis. "It was not an
easy choice to leave. There are a
lot of good people here, but tran
sitions happen," he said. "We
weren't determined to leave, it
just turned out that [my wife's]
best offer was in Minnesota. Once
we made that decision, other
things looked attractive."
Starrett said the department
will not replace Taylor, since he
taught only on a part-time basis
and is taking the journal with him.
