## 
### Burt Herman Editorial staff 
Alpha Sig's Exotic Erotic party Saturday
night was marked with another arrest, adding to
a long history of police involvement at the annu
al celebration of scant attire.
Stanford police arrested Brian Vye, an 18-
year-old San Jose resident who is not a Stanford
student, for being intoxicated in public, giving
police false information and possessing false

identification.
Vye spent the night at the North County Jail
in Palo Alto and was released yesterday, accord
ing to jail authorities.
Emergency units first responded to the scene
at about 3 a.m. to answer a medical call for alco
hol poisoning, police said. When they arrived, po
lice could not locate the person the call was made
for but instead found Vye outside.
Vye told police at the time of his arrest that he
was a prospective freshman, police said. Pro Fro

week officials have no record of Vye.
According to Vye's aunt, he will be attending
Brigham Young University next year. Vye also
told police that he plays quarterback for his high
school football team.
As he was being handcuffed, Vye shouted that
he was staying with an Eli Robinson. No student
of that name could be found in public records.
When asked why his son was on campus, Vye's
father said, "He was invited by
some friends to a party."
"We did everything we could to
check IDs," Alpha Sig House Man
ager Mike Christian said, adding
that two kinds of bracelets were
used to differentiate between under
age and 21-year-old partygoers.
In the past, the annual under
dressed bash has been the scene of
several arrests. Last year, the
party was held the week before Pro
Fro week and alcohol was not
served because the house was on
probation, Christian said.
In 1992, one arrest was made at
the party for assault on a police
officer. Police also shut down the
party due to overcrowding and
underage drinking.
There were five arrests at Exot
ic Erotic in 1991, including the
arrest of a prospective freshman
on charges of public drunkenness.
