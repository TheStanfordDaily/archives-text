## Former hostage Anderson describes seven years in captivity 
### Josh Gohlke Staff writer 
It is difficult to imagine what it would bo
like to be a prisoner in a foreign country for
seven years, to have an entire nation antic
ipate your release, to meet your six-year
old daughter for the first time. But former
hostage Terry Anderson did his best to help
an audience of about 400 to do so in a
speech Friday at Kresge Auditorium.
Anderson, an Associated Press reporter
who was captured by Shi'ite Muslims in
Beirut in March 1985 and held until Dec.
1991 — making him the last hostage re
leased — spoke about his time in captivity
and his time since with emotion, under
standing and oflen humor.

"I'm pleased to be here," Anderson
began the speech. "Of course, I'm pleased
to bo most anywhere these days."
Much of Anderson's talk dealt with the
two years since his release, and how he has
readjusted and changed since the experi
ence. Me spoke of his daughter, Sulome,
and his wife, Madeline, whom he married
after his return.
"1 know Maddy loves me deeply. She
waited for me for seven years in pain, and
she was there when I got back," he said.
"We're moving on with our lives. I got to
know my daughter, who is beautiful and
intelligent and exciting, just like her moth
er. She's also very stubborn.
"I don't know where she got that from,"
he added with irony.

Anderson, who was the Middle East
Bureau Chief for the Associated Press
when he was captured, also spoke about
his professional life, and why he is no
longer a journalist.
"1 had a lot of time to think," he said. "I
didn't want to be a watcher anymore — I
wanted to be a participant."
The Batavia, N.Y., native, is satisfying
his new participatory tendencies through
New York Renaissance, an organization
he founded to advocate political reform.
Asked in the question-and-answer session
after the speech if he would ever consider
running for office, he said, "I may. I'm not
rejecting it."
