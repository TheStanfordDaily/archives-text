# 'Yanked off the street and put in hell'
## Former hostage Anderson describes seven years in captivity 
### Josh Gohlke Staff writer 
It is difficult to imagine what it would bo
like to be a prisoner in a foreign country for
seven years, to have an entire nation antic
ipate your release, to meet your six-year
old daughter for the first time. But former
hostage Terry Anderson did his best to help
an audience of about 400 to do so in a
speech Friday at Kresge Auditorium.
Anderson, an Associated Press reporter
who was captured by Shi'ite Muslims in
Beirut in March 1985 and held until Dec.
1991 — making him the last hostage re
leased — spoke about his time in captivity
and his time since with emotion, under
standing and oflen humor.

"I'm pleased to be here," Anderson
began the speech. "Of course, I'm pleased
to bo most anywhere these days."
Much of Anderson's talk dealt with the
two years since his release, and how he has
readjusted and changed since the experi
ence. Me spoke of his daughter, Sulome,
and his wife, Madeline, whom he married
after his return.
"1 know Maddy loves me deeply. She
waited for me for seven years in pain, and
she was there when I got back," he said.
"We're moving on with our lives. I got to
know my daughter, who is beautiful and
intelligent and exciting, just like her moth
er. She's also very stubborn.
"I don't know where she got that from,"
he added with irony.

Anderson, who was the Middle East
Bureau Chief for the Associated Press
when he was captured, also spoke about
his professional life, and why he is no
longer a journalist.
"1 had a lot of time to think," he said. "I
didn't want to be a watcher anymore — I
wanted to be a participant."
The Batavia, N.Y., native, is satisfying
his new participatory tendencies through
New York Renaissance, an organization
he founded to advocate political reform.
Asked in the question-and-answer session
after the speech if he would ever consider
running for office, he said, "I may. I'm not
rejecting it."


Bobby Lee Daily
Former Asso
ciated Press
journalist Terry
Anderson, who
was held
hostage for
seven years in
Lebanon, dis
cusses his
captivity on
Friday in Kres
ge Auditorium.
He has also written a book,
titled "Den of Lions," about his
experiences in Lebanon, many of
which he described in detail for the
audience.
Anderson described how, on his
way to play tennis on the morning
of March 16, 1985, in Beirut, he
was "yanked off the street and put
in hell" by four armed men. After
he was forced onto the floor of a
Mercedes, one of the kidnappers

turned around and said in English,
"Don't worry. It's political."
"Somehow I wasn't too reas
sured," he told the audience, to
their amusement.
During his first weeks in captiv
ity, the horrors of the experience —
and memories of his life before —
were almost too much for him to
endure, Anderson said.
"There were times I thought I
wanted to die — I would say, 'Go
ahead, shoot me,' " he said. "Most
ly I thought of the beautiful, loving
woman I had left behind. I thought
of things I had done and not done.
I knew I was losing it. I was just

going to go crazy."
Anderson discussed the things
that got him through, such as
Catholicism, which he stopped
practicing as a young man but
began again six months before he
was captured.
He said he called a guard in at
one point early in his captivity and
said to him, "I want a Bible." The
guard complied with his request.
"I can still feel that Bible, I can
still smell it," Anderson said, ges
turing as if he were still holding the
book. "I read it cover to cover some
50 times."
Another thing that Anderson

said saved his life and sanity were
his fellow hostages, and the close
relationships he developed with
them. He said his relationships
with the other captives — whom he
still sees and talks to quite fre
quently — were, although often
turbulent, the closest friendships
he has ever had.
Anderson's closest friendship
was with Tom Sutherland, with
whom he spent six years within
arm's reach.
"Can you imagine living that
close to someone for so long?"
Anderson asked the audience, and
then added humorously, "Tom

told me he had been married to his
wife for 30 years and had spent
more time with me. And he made
it clear that he didn't enjoy it as
much."
Anderson also described the
deep mutual understanding
between him and the other prison
ers, on any subject.
"I can sit here and talk forever,
and leave feeling like I have not
really explained anything to you,"
he said. "But I can talk to (fellow
hostage) John McCarthy for five
minutes, and know he under
stands."
Anderson made it clear that he

harbors no ill will toward the peo
ple of the Middle East — "Those
people that held me did not repre
sent the Lebanese or Arabs or
Muslims" — and even said he
would like to return some time, if
his wife lets him.
As for a greater lesson to be
learned and taught from his terri
ble seven years, Anderson offered
the following:
"Each of us, each of you, can
win through anything. We were
ordinary men, picked randomly off
the streets of Beirut. The human
spirit is extraordinarily difficult to
crush," he said.

Catholicism, which he stopped
practicing as a young man but
began again six months before he
was captured.
He said he called a guard in at
one point early in his captivity and
said to him, "I want a Bible." The
guard complied with his request.
"I can still feel that Bible, I can
still smell it," Anderson said, ges
turing as if he were still holding the
book. "I read it cover to cover some
50 times."
Another thing that Anderson

said saved his life and sanity were
his fellow hostages, and the close
relationships he developed with
them. He said his relationships
with the other captives — whom he
still sees and talks to quite fre
quently — were, although often
turbulent, the closest friendships
he has ever had.
Anderson's closest friendship
was with Tom Sutherland, with
whom he spent six years within
arm's reach.
"Can you imagine living that
close to someone for so long?"
Anderson asked the audience, and
then added humorously, "Tom

told me he had been married to his
wife for 30 years and had spent
more time with me. And he made
it clear that he didn't enjoy it as
much."
Anderson also described the
deep mutual understanding
between him and the other prison
ers, on any subject.
"I can sit here and talk forever,
and leave feeling like I have not
really explained anything to you,"
he said. "But I can talk to (fellow
hostage) John McCarthy for five
minutes, and know he under
stands."
Anderson made it clear that he

harbors no ill will toward the peo
ple of the Middle East — "Those
people that held me did not repre
sent the Lebanese or Arabs or
Muslims" — and even said he
would like to return some time, if
his wife lets him.
As for a greater lesson to be
learned and taught from his terri
ble seven years, Anderson offered
the following:
"Each of us, each of you, can
win through anything. We were
ordinary men, picked randomly off
the streets of Beirut. The human
spirit is extraordinarily difficult to
crush," he said.
It is difficult to imagine what it would bo
like to be a prisoner in a foreign country for
seven years, to have an entire nation antic
ipate your release, to meet your six-year
old daughter for the first time. But former
hostage Terry Anderson did his best to help
an audience of about 400 to do so in a
speech Friday at Kresge Auditorium.
Anderson, an Associated Press reporter
who was captured by Shi'ite Muslims in
Beirut in March 1985 and held until Dec.
1991 — making him the last hostage re
leased — spoke about his time in captivity
and his time since with emotion, under
standing and oflen humor.

"I'm pleased to be here," Anderson
began the speech. "Of course, I'm pleased
to bo most anywhere these days."
Much of Anderson's talk dealt with the
two years since his release, and how he has
readjusted and changed since the experi
ence. Me spoke of his daughter, Sulome,
and his wife, Madeline, whom he married
after his return.
"1 know Maddy loves me deeply. She
waited for me for seven years in pain, and
she was there when I got back," he said.
"We're moving on with our lives. I got to
know my daughter, who is beautiful and
intelligent and exciting, just like her moth
er. She's also very stubborn.
"I don't know where she got that from,"
he added with irony.

Anderson, who was the Middle East
Bureau Chief for the Associated Press
when he was captured, also spoke about
his professional life, and why he is no
longer a journalist.
"1 had a lot of time to think," he said. "I
didn't want to be a watcher anymore — I
wanted to be a participant."
The Batavia, N.Y., native, is satisfying
his new participatory tendencies through
New York Renaissance, an organization
he founded to advocate political reform.
Asked in the question-and-answer session
after the speech if he would ever consider
running for office, he said, "I may. I'm not
rejecting it."


Bobby Lee Daily
Former Asso
ciated Press
journalist Terry
Anderson, who
was held
hostage for
seven years in
Lebanon, dis
cusses his
captivity on
Friday in Kres
ge Auditorium.
He has also written a book,
titled "Den of Lions," about his
experiences in Lebanon, many of
which he described in detail for the
audience.
Anderson described how, on his
way to play tennis on the morning
of March 16, 1985, in Beirut, he
was "yanked off the street and put
in hell" by four armed men. After
he was forced onto the floor of a
Mercedes, one of the kidnappers

turned around and said in English,
"Don't worry. It's political."
"Somehow I wasn't too reas
sured," he told the audience, to
their amusement.
During his first weeks in captiv
ity, the horrors of the experience —
and memories of his life before —
were almost too much for him to
endure, Anderson said.
"There were times I thought I
wanted to die — I would say, 'Go
ahead, shoot me,' " he said. "Most
ly I thought of the beautiful, loving
woman I had left behind. I thought
of things I had done and not done.
I knew I was losing it. I was just

going to go crazy."
Anderson discussed the things
that got him through, such as
Catholicism, which he stopped
practicing as a young man but
began again six months before he
was captured.
He said he called a guard in at
one point early in his captivity and
said to him, "I want a Bible." The
guard complied with his request.
