# What if...
## Under split-fee system, 14 more groups would have received funds 
### Jim Luh Staff writer 
Some student groups may wish
the Fair Funding Amendment had
passed during the ASSU election
earlier this month in light of newly
released figures showing that all
but four would have received their
special fee.
If voters had approved the
amendment earlier this month, 14
more groups would have received
funding. But undergraduates
would have paid $55 per quarter
while graduates paid about $13 —
compared to the $22 per quarter
all students will pay next year.
The Fair Funding Amendment,
which fell short of the necessary
two-thirds approval by less than 2
percent, would have divided the
graduate and undergraduate
votes, allowing each population to

decide separately whether to ap
prove a group's special fee.
According to figures recently
released by the Elections Commis
sion, only four groups — Coffee
house Live!, the Stanford Journal
of International Affairs, the Stan
ford Kayak Club and the You Can
Make a Difference Conference —
would not have received fees
under the amendment. Instead,
18 of 36 groups were denied fund
ing.
Had the bill passed, a group
whose fee was approved by the
majority of only one population
would receive its entire request,
but the fee would be paid for only
by the approving population.
The amendment would have
also eliminated a rule that re
quires 'yes' votes to constitute 15
percent of the student population
— a rule that prevented 10
groups' fees from passing this
year.
The amendment was over
whelmingly approved by graduate
students, with 1,530 voting in
favor of the amendment, only 235
voting against and 306 abstain
ing.
The undergraduate vote was
largely against the amendment,
with 1,082 voting against the
amendment, 949 voting in favor
and 873 abstaining.
"It demonstrates that grad stu
dents can be mobilized when an
effort is made to get grad students
to vote," said graduate senator

Sanford Dickert, one of the bill's
co-authors.
Graduate senator Nawwar
Kasrawi, who has been re-elected
for next year's term, said the
results indicate that "something
along those lines is wanted by stu
dents. ... 65 percent is pretty
overwhelming."
Kasrawi said he might be will
ing to help draft a new version of
the bill, refining it to overcome the
objections of some of the bill's
opponents.
"I guess our stance would be
that we would hope to get funding
in any way possible, and if it took
having the student body divided
like that, we would support it,"
said senior Mark Shalaby, finan
cial manager of the Stanford Car
dinal Broadcasting Network. "If it
comes up again, we would support

it — if this year is any indication of
the future."
Only 10 of the groups seeking
special-fee funding were approved
by a majority of graduate students
— Club Sports, Legal Counseling,
the ASSU Speakers Bureau,
Spoon Hunger Relief Network,
The Daily, STOP, the Stanford
Solar Car Project, the Stanford
Symphony Orchestra, SURE and
Stanford Volunteer Network. All
10 of those groups passed in the
overall vote.
Graduate senator Sanford
Dickert said the low graduate spe
*cial-fee approval was indicative of
groups' failure to reach out to
graduate students.
"Evidently the grad students
do not feel .... they're receiving
benefits from these organiza
tions," Dickert said.
