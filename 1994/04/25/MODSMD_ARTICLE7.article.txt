# What if...
## Under split-fee system, 14 more groups would have received funds 
### Jim Luh Staff writer 
Some student groups may wish
the Fair Funding Amendment had
passed during the ASSU election
earlier this month in light of newly
released figures showing that all
but four would have received their
special fee.
If voters had approved the
amendment earlier this month, 14
more groups would have received
funding. But undergraduates
would have paid $55 per quarter
while graduates paid about $13 —
compared to the $22 per quarter
all students will pay next year.
The Fair Funding Amendment,
which fell short of the necessary
two-thirds approval by less than 2
percent, would have divided the
graduate and undergraduate
votes, allowing each population to

decide separately whether to ap
prove a group's special fee.
According to figures recently
released by the Elections Commis
sion, only four groups — Coffee
house Live!, the Stanford Journal
of International Affairs, the Stan
ford Kayak Club and the You Can
Make a Difference Conference —
would not have received fees
under the amendment. Instead,
18 of 36 groups were denied fund
ing.
Had the bill passed, a group
whose fee was approved by the
majority of only one population
would receive its entire request,
but the fee would be paid for only
by the approving population.
The amendment would have
also eliminated a rule that re
quires 'yes' votes to constitute 15
percent of the student population
