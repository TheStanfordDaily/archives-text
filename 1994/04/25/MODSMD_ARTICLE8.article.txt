## Awareness Week starts today 
### Beth Berselli Staff writer 
A survivor speak-out in White
Plaza, a panel discussion about
rape on college campuses and an a
cappella concert to benefit a rape
crisis center are just a few of the
events scheduled for this year's
Rape Awareness Week.
"Breaking the Bonds of Silence:
Demystifying Sexual Assault" is
the theme for the week. "Our mes
sage is that rape occurs here at
Stanford," said junior Sally Matlin,
an organizer of the week.
Sponsored by the Coalition
Against Sexual Assault, the week is
aimed at "making people think
about the issue and inspire them
talk about it with their peers," said
junior Kirsten Frohnmayer, a
coalition member.
"We hope to educate people
about the prevalence of date rape
and why it's so serious and has such
devastating consequences. We also

hope to give people ideas about how
they can prevent and avoid date
rape from happening both through
changed attitudes and changed ac
tions," Frohnmayer said.
Matlin said the event is different
this year because "we're not trying
to reach huge amounts of people
with one or two events. We're try
ing to do smaller events directed at
specific communities."
Senior Matthew Mizel said he
and other organizers are "focusing
on fraternities and sororities more.
Studies have shown that fraternity
and sorority members are more
likely to be sexually assaulted or to
sexually assault someone."
The week is also aimed at pro
viding training for groups that are
likely to deal with a survivor, Mizel
added. This includes Bridge coun
selors and "Sex in the '90s" facilita
tors.
