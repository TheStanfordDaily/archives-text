# ME class takes aim at hoops
## 
### Shirley Park Staff writer 
Encina Gym buzzed with
sounds of "basket," "foul" and
"shot-clock" yesterday. "Hoop It
Up" was no ordinary basketball
tournament, however, but a
challenge for teams of Mechani
cal Engineering 101 students to
score a basket within 90 seconds.
It sounded easy until the guide
lines were established: students
were not allowed to touch the ball,
get within six feet of the court or
speak. In addition, team members
who moved while playing would be
called for "traveling."
To circumvent these obsta
cles, students devised creative
contraptions out of a restricted
list of materials — including
foam-core, string, PVC tubing,
rubber bands, glue, a coat hanger
and a kitchen utensil. The re
sults were displayed in yester
day's tournament, the first of
three design projects for stu
dents in the traditionally innova
tive course.
In this game, shot accuracy
wasn't as important as style.
Students were graded on creativ
ity, cleverness and "coolness" as
well, said participant Johnny
Chen, a freshman. Hargadon
added elegance and the crowd
pleasing factor as two more grad
ing criteria.
"It's better to fail dramatical
ly than to succeed boringly,"said
first-year graduate student
Raino Zoller, a member of the
"Fab Foam Five" team.

Sophomore Dorian West sets up an ME 101 project yesterday in old Encina Gym. The
device inbounds a basketball and then shoots a basket.
