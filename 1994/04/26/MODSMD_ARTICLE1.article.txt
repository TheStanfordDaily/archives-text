# ME class takes aim at hoops
## 
### Shirley Park Staff writer 
Encina Gym buzzed with
sounds of "basket," "foul" and
"shot-clock" yesterday. "Hoop It
Up" was no ordinary basketball
tournament, however, but a
challenge for teams of Mechani
cal Engineering 101 students to
score a basket within 90 seconds.
It sounded easy until the guide
lines were established: students
were not allowed to touch the ball,
get within six feet of the court or
speak. In addition, team members
who moved while playing would be
called for "traveling."
To circumvent these obsta
cles, students devised creative
contraptions out of a restricted
list of materials — including
foam-core, string, PVC tubing,
rubber bands, glue, a coat hanger
and a kitchen utensil. The re
sults were displayed in yester
day's tournament, the first of
three design projects for stu
dents in the traditionally innova
tive course.
In this game, shot accuracy
wasn't as important as style.
Students were graded on creativ
ity, cleverness and "coolness" as
well, said participant Johnny
Chen, a freshman. Hargadon
added elegance and the crowd
pleasing factor as two more grad
ing criteria.
"It's better to fail dramatical
ly than to succeed boringly,"said
first-year graduate student
Raino Zoller, a member of the
"Fab Foam Five" team.


Curtis Chen — Daily
Sophomore Dorian West sets up an ME 101 project yesterday in old Encina Gym. The
device inbounds a basketball and then shoots a basket.
His fellow team member Kit
Rodgers, a sophomore, seemed
confident of success and bragged
of a 100 percent success rate in the
past two weeks of practice.
Rodgers was able to back up his
words later as his team's contrap
tion worked to perfection.
The set-up of the court also
played on the basketball theme.
Lecturer Larry Shubert and
teaching assistant Chuck Shafer
donned referee uniforms and blew
a whistle to signal the start of the
90 second shot clock. The court, 20
by 30 feet, was marked by four
cardboard defenders wearing
Stanford uniforms.
At one point, the contraption by
the team "In Your Face" dunked
over a dummy and accidentally
decapitated it, prompting calls of
"technical" and "charging" from
the audience.
The audience, comprised most
ly of fellow classmates, was
enthusiastic and supportive,
cheering the playing team on and
in some cases expressing awe.

"That's pretty sweet — I wish we
could have thought of that," a
student said after observing
"Foam Core Four's" elaborate
concoction of wheels, levers and
string, complete with background
music.
The team "Above Your Rim"
was the first to succeed in their
endeavor as well as the first to
get a "rebound," retrieving the
ball without entering the arena.
"We're definitely the most well
rounded team out here," sopho
more Mike Yurochko boasted.
Teammate Chen agreed,
adding that they were "technically
proficient."
"Foam Core Advantage" enlist
ed the help of the audience, who
chanted "I think I can" as a blast
from a rubber band sent the ball
down a constructed railroad track
and lifted up to the basket by a
system of counterweights.
Of the 13 groups who attempt
ed to "shoot for two," 10 were suc
cessful in getting the ball through
the hoop.
But in lecturer Andy Har
gadon's opinion, everyone was
successful. "They all did an incred
ible and creative job, with no two
solutions being alike," he said.
