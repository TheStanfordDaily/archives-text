# Panelists discuss on-campus rape
## 
### Beth Berselli Staff writer 
College student Katie Koest
ner, whose accusations of rape
drew national attention three
years ago, described overhearing
a fraternity member brag about
a "fun game" called "Rodeo"
during a speech last night.
The "game" involves inviting
a "cow" — usually an over
weight, unattractive girl — over
to the fraternity house, getting
her drunk and gang-raping her,
Koestner said during the panel
discussion of rape on college
campuses in an attempt to illus
trate current attitudes.
The fraternity members take
turns "riding her," while timing
and photographing each ride.
"It's a game of who can stay on
the longest," Koestner told the
Dinkelspiel Auditorium audi
ence of approximately 50 peo
ple.
Koestner said she was raped
by a male friend during her
freshman year at the College of
William and Mary. She reported
the incident, but the man was
not convicted or punished by the

college. She eventually sued the
school over its lack of response.
Currently a senior at William
and Mary, Koestner now travels
around the country and speaks
about her experience to college
and high school students.
In a 15-minute speech, Koest
ner discussed the various atti
tudes she has encountered dur
ing her travels.
"I have met men who say that
drunk sex is better than sober sex
because they can stay hard
longer," she said. "Men have told
me that they're selfish. That they
outright don't care. They feel no
emotions when they have sex."
Koestner also talked about the
trials she encountered after going
public. "Talking to other survivors
was the only thing that kept me
going," she said. "It is so impor
tant to find a support group."
In addition to Koestner, Stan
ford Law Prof. Deborah Rhode
and author Tim Beneke spoke
last night.
Rhode — the former director
of the Institute for Research on
Women and Gender — talked
about "rape as a crime" and gave
an overview of how campus rape

and acquaintance rape fit into
the "general picture."
"It's not so swell," Rhode
said. "Most coercive sex
remains unacknowledged. . . .
Recent estimates suggest that
40 percent to 45 percent of
women will experience a violent
sexual assault outside of mar
riage."
Rhode said a major problem
exists in the "disparity between
what men and women perceive
about what constitutes consent
and what constitutes coercion."
Calling rape the "most unre
ported felony," Rhode said the
current penalty for rapists is
very lenient. Rapists are typical-

ly sentenced to about four years
in prison, which is less than
many armed robbers.
Beneke — who wrote a book
titled "Men on Rape" — dis
cussed how men fit into the
"rape picture." Men need to
acknowledge rape as a problem,
he said. "It's intellectually easy,
but emotionally difficult to do."
At the discussion's conclu
sion, moderator Cecilia Burciaga
urged the audience to "exercise
your voice."
"Seek out the resources on
campus. Don't keep silent," said
Burciaga, who is an associate
dean and resident fellow in Casa
Zapata.
