Serbs withdraw, stall U.N.
SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina
(AP) — Bosnian Serbs blocked a U.N. aid
convoy headed for Gorazde yesterday
despite pledges to allow free access, but
appeared to be moving heavy weapons
further away from the Muslim town as
demanded by NATO.
U.N. helicopters evacuated 91 more
wounded people from the besieged Mus
lim enclave for treatment in Sarajevo.
Hundreds more were waiting flights.
The Serbs mostly halted their assault
on Gorazde yesterday, more than a day
after NATO threatened air strikes if they
did not immediately cease fire and with
draw armor and artillery 1.9 miles from
the town center.
"We have good news from Gorazde,"
said a U.N. spokesman, Maj. Guy Vinet.
"The situation is quiet. . . . There's some
sporadic small-arms fire, but it's very lit
tle."
About 350 peacekeepers moved to
Gorazde over the weekend and a human
itarian convoy delivered 90 tons of aid
yesterday.

But Bosnian Serbs blocked a second
aid convoy at the Yugoslav border yester
day, claiming it had no clearance, aid
workers said.
Haiti massacre uncovered
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) - Sol
diers massacred at least 23 fishermen and
merchants in a west coast slum loyal to
ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide,
witnesses and human rights advocates said
yesterday. It followed a wave of attacks on
Haiti's pro-democracy movement.
The soldiers raided a seaside neighbor
hood near the west coast city of Gonaives,
firing shots in the air Saturday, but caus
ing no reported injuries.
Hours later, they returned and began
shooting indiscriminately at people gath
ering firewood on the beach. The troops
also commandeered rowboats and
attacked fishermen off shore. The week
end attack was first reported yesterday.
The killings come as Washington has
toughened its stance against the military,
which has dominated Haiti since ousting
the elected Aristide in a 1991 coup.
