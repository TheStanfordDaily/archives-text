JOHANNESBURG, South Africa
(AP) — Terrorist bombers struck twice
yesterday, killing at least 12 people on
the eve of the election that will bring
blacks to power in South Africa. Politi
cal leaders tried to reassure voters and
ordered more than 100,000 police to
protect the polling.
A car bomb ripped through a taxi
stand yesterday morning in the eastern
suburb ofGermiston, raining a firestorm
of glass and twisted metal down on most
ly black commuters. Ten people died and
41 were wounded.
A caller claiming to speak for a white
extremist group claimed responsibility.
Police did not say whether the call was
genuine.
Yesterday evening, a bomb exploded
at a Pretoria tavern frequented by
blacks, killing at least two people and
injuring about 30, police said. Witness
es said white youths hurled the bomb
from a passing car.
The blasts came a day after a car
bomb in downtown Johannesburg
killed nine people.
No group claimed responsibility, but
authorities believed the blasts were
linked and said they had detained one

person for questioning.
Survivors saw whites fleeing the
scenes of all three bombings, adding to
suspicions that the attacks were the
work of right-wingers bent on disrupt
ing the election that will bring an end to
white rule in Africa.
"A group of desperate people has . . .
declared war on the rest of this soci
ety," President F.W. de Klerk said. "We
will not rest until they have been
tracked down, convicted and punished,
as they deserve."
There were at least 10 smaller bomb
ings Sunday and yesterday that caused
no casualties but escalated the tension.
Electric pylons, polling stations and
black taxi stands were targeted.
Some voters were undeterred by the
bombings.
Kenneth Jele, a black man who lives
in a cardboard box near the Pretoria
explosion, said the bombing would not
keep him from voting for the African
National Congress this week.
Manie Netto, a white onlooker, also
intended to cast his ballot. "It's actual
ly made me more firm that I have to go
and vote, just to prove that these people
don't have a say in the future of this

country," he said.
The attacks in Johannesburg and
the Germiston suburb were the worst
in the city's history.
Debris was scattered over a four
block area of Germiston after the blast.
Shattered car parts hung from tree
limbs; body parts and twisted metal lay
on the ground. One building collapsed,
and a minivan was thrown on top of
another.
The explosions led to the biggest
peacetime military callup in the coun
try's history, Deputy Law and Order
Minister Gert Myburgh said. He
refused to give numbers but said more
than 100,000 police — more than dou
ble the number originally planned —
would be deployed at polling stations
along with army troops.
Polls open at 7 a.m. today for "spe
cial voting" for invalids, hospital
patients and the elderly. General voting
is to take place tomorrow and Thurs
day. The three-day election is the first
to include South Africa's black majori
ty.
Nelson Mandela's African National
Congress is the overwhelming favorite
to win.
