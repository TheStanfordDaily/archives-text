KZSU - THE NOISE you
need. Although some may
argue the sounds that
emanate from Stanford's campus
radio station are extraneous, last
week's broadcast of the Dalai Lama's
speech in Memorial Church was def
initely beneficial programming.
The Dalai Lama's visit — which
included the speech in the church, a
discussion with some members of
the Stanford faculty and a faculty
seminar — proved to be an
extremely popular event.
The speech in particular attract
ed many more people than the
church could hold, and many stu
dents were unable to attend. KZSU
should be commended for broad
casting the speech, so that those
who did not get lucky in the speech
lottery could still hear the address,
more clearly than in some parts of
the church.
KZSU also broadcasts other
valuable events students can tune

in to — such as baseball and volley
ball games, speeches from adminis
tration officials and visitors such as
Jean-Bertrand Aristide. The sta
tion should increase the amount of
time it devotes to this program
ming, as it lends variety to the sta
tion in addition to making it more
of a "campus" radio.
In this year's special-fee voting,
KZSU passed by a small margin. If
students are more aware of KZSU's
special broadcasts, they might be
more inclined to want to fund
KZSU's sizable fee. KZSU should
continue to advertise through
fliers, on-air announcements, press
releases and internet publicity.
While students may not find all
of KZSU's programming in tune
with their musical palates, speech
es and other activities broadcast on
the station are valuable assets to
the Stanford community, and
KZSU should attempt to broadcast
more of these types of events.
