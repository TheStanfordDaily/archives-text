Although apathy de
serves most of the blame for
the special fee massacre two
weeks ago, more detailed statistics
recently released by the ASSU Elec
tions Commission indicate that lack
of graduate student support was
also a significant factor in the voting
which downed many groups' fees.
While undergrads approved 32
of the 36 special-fee requests, the
graduate student body passed just
10. A lot of the groups which lost by
a small margin, like MEChA, would
have benefited enormously from
stronger support from the graduate
community. Groups should realize
that they must work harder to con
sider what graduate students want.
Unfortunately, the talk after the
election has largely been centered
on how the results would have been
different had the so-called "Fair
Funding" amendment been
approved. It is true that the mea
sure — which would have changed
the ASSU Constitution to count

graduate and undergraduate special
fee votes separately — would have
resulted in funding for more groups.
However, special fee charges for
undergraduates would have sky
rocketed to $55 per quarter had the
amendment received the two-thirds
majority necessary.
Before lobbying to change the
special fee system, groups should
look to themselves for solutions.
Reaching out to graduate students
over the next year — by publicizing
more in graduate housing, for
example — would give the other
half of the student body a clearer
picture of what special-fee groups
do. Groups should also work on
more active outreach efforts, rather
than simply settling for the current
ly disinterested "they-can-partici
pate-if-they-want-to" attitude. With
the increased attention, graduate
students, who have long felt ignored
by many groups, would be less
inclined to voting against every spe
cial fee.
