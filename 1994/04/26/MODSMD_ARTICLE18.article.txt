## You and your hormones 
### 
Recently, one of my buddies
was complaining that he had to
read Darwin in CIV. I usually
ignore what he says — he is a senior in
CIV — but my friend does have a point. I
think that evolution is a load of bunk.
It's kind of like learning about some
thing you know is false just because if
they taught you anything else in school,
the teachers would go on strike or you'd
get stabbed or shot or you'd be stuck sit
ting in Prophylactic Usage 101.
Now, before all you creationists start
cheering mindlessly, I want to explain
myself. The basic premise is that species
evolve due to changes in the environ
ment — survival of the fittest as it were,
except in today's day and age we encour
age and subsidize mediocrity.
(Did I mean to comment on Stan
ford's policy of not failing anyone and
allowing all those budding neurosur
geons who are going to be operating on
your children to take Chem 35 three
times? Oh no. Obviously I was condemn
ing farm subsidies.)
Now, how exactly do species propa
gate? All of you giggling frosh in Hum
Sex should know this and all of you
upperclassmen should have heard about
it. It is through sex. (I can see those cre
ationists wincing in fear.) Sex is made
possible by the physical development of
all the, um, appropriate equipment. This
whole process is started by the secretion
of sex hormones. Alas, herein lies the
paradox of humanity. These very same

hormones that are supposed to result in
the propagation of the species result in
the near-fatality of the individual.
At first, they cause you to grow hair in
ungodly places and make your voice
sound like Charlie Brown's. And you feel
so much better when you realize that the
same hormones that are making this
switch may also give you Charlie
Brown's receding hairline.
It only gets worse. Soon those blasted
hormones are making you do stupid
things in high school like walk to the
drinking fountain 20 zillion times so you
look cool to a girl who is only 20 feet
away — but who doesn't even realize you
live in the same area code. You do stupid
stuff like hanging around gym class and
spending your hard-earned summer cash
on needless perfumes you can't pro
nounce — and which give you hives.
These sadistic hormones don't give up
once you're in college. During freshman
year you participate in those embarrass
ing Orientation activities where you try
to score that significant other. Then,
when you get older, you think you've
mastered the frat scene — but instead of
walking home with that significant
other, you wake up alone and cold in the
bushes with the significant other being
your roommate.
Then you become a big bad senior,
dressing up for your 9 a.m. so that you
can impress someone. Four years older,
$100,000 poorer, and still back at square
one — drinking with your frosh year

roommate. Full circle. Ashes to ashes,
dust to dust.
Soon panic sets in. You begin to real
ize that things really don't get much bet
ter than life here at Stanford. I mean,
you're surrounded by potentially 13,000
(not counting those who have tatched on
to someone else and have already taken a
number for that ceremony at city hall)
others, one of whom may be looking for
you.
Face it, grad school isn't going to get
any better. In college, you could impress
frosh by your knowledge of Yoruba buri
al customs; that won't work with Ph.D.
candidates who spent three years living
with the Yoruba. And it certainly won't
fly with the married ones.
Once you leave school, you're tossed
into the real world and forced to enter
tain fantasies of coffee room romances
and mysterious encounters by the Xerox
machine. Life progresses, if you're lucky
to have a midday rendezvous at the
Bumpus Motel behind the bowling alley.
And then, after your hormones have
ruined your life, they disappear — and
your hairline does look like Charlie
Brown's.
