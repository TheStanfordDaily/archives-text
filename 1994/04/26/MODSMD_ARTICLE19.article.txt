## Driving range prices should be kept low for students 
### 
STANFORD IS unusually blessed
with fine athletic facilities. It is
good that a large part of these facil
ities are open to non-varsity athletes.
However, as paradoxical as it may
sound, just because these facilities are
open to students does not mean students
can use them. Specifically, I am refer
ring to the golf facilities.
Stanford's golf facilities are composed
of three parts: the golf course itself, the
driving range and a practice area next to
the driving range reserved for the golf
team. The golf course should be com
mended for offering a fair discounted
price for students. The driving range,
however, is becoming increasingly inac
cessible to students. First, there is no
student discount of any sort, and second,
prices are going up.
The current price is $6 for a large

bucket of balls. As of May 1, prices will
rise about 17 percent to $7. While $7 is a
reasonable price, (I found that prices
varied from $6.50 to $8 at area courses),
that is not the main issue. Currently —
outside of classes — I estimate that no
more than 25 percent of the people who
use the driving range are Stanford stu
dents. I got that figure from purely visu
al estimation, but anyone who has been
to the driving range would probably con
cur. Imagine what a controversy it
would be if the weight room, for exam
ple, had the same student/non-student
ratio. Raising prices will probably fur
ther reduce the percentage of students.
I understand that the driving range
probably does not get any funding from
tuition charges. But this cannot be used
as a justification for not serving stu
dents. It is reasonable that the driving

range should be able to pay for itself.
With the installation of night lighting
this year there was a large capital invest
ment which could be a factor in the
increase. But what good is a lighted driv
ing range when no students can afford
to use it?
It might be argued that the driving
range is economically accessible to stu
dents because golf classes are a good
deal. But I wonder if the people who
make that argument have ever tried to
sign up for a class. "Sure you're signed
up — you're on the third page of the
wait list!" If the prices at the driving
range were cheaper, more students
would become customers instead of try
ing to take a class.
The driving range — like the golf
course — cannot financially survive
without outside customers. But it should

not be run without consideration for
who it serves, which includes students.
After all, it is still the Stanford Golf
Club. To that extent, I would advocate
they institute a system of student dis
counts. Perhaps they should raise the
prices only for non-students, keeping the
student price at $6. Or they could raise
the outside rate to $8 and create a stu
dent rate of $5.
I don't think this will cause the range
to lose any money and it will go a far
way toward fulfilling the goal of serving
the Stanford community. Unfortunately,
golf has an image as an elitist sport.
That trend is changing across the coun
try; Stanford should follow this trend by
keeping the golf facilities economically
accessible to students.
