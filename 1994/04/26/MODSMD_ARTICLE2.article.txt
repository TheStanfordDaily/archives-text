# A 						to NP?
## Students concerned about proposed grading policies 
### Linda Friedlieb Editorial staff 
Some student leaders are upset
over suggested changes to the Univer
sity's grading policy, proposals they
say were formulated without enough
student input and threaten to dis
courage academic experimentation.
Many students believe "the pro
posal is good because the current
grading system detracts from Stan
ford's creditability," said senior Ying-
Ying Goh, a member of the current

Council of Presidents. "The gist is 'I think it's a good
idea but I don't want to be here when it's in effect.'
"But people are also worried that they're not going
to be able to take classes for interest," she added,
pointing out that most students receive lower grades
in courses outside their majors.
The proposal, which grew out of a faculty survey
on grading and will be discussed at a Faculty Senate
meeting Thursday, proposes the inclusion of failing


Goh
grades on transcripts, a stricter
policy on retaking courses and a
three-week deadline for dropping
and adding courses.
In addition, transcripts would
be more historical — including
"NP" for courses not passed, "W"
for courses dropped between the
fourth and eight weeks of the quar
ter, and an asterisk to indicate
courses that are retaken. It would
also move the deadline for declar
ing the pass/no credit option from
the fourth to eighth week of the
quarter.
COP member Jason Snyder, a
senior, said he believes the ability
to drop a class late in the quarter is
important to students. "The prob
lem with having a more Draconian
grading scale is that individual pro
fessors have different grading
scales, and thus it's hard to create
a uniform scale," he said.
Snyder suggested that if the
policy is adopted, fewer students
will be willing to take a chance on
classes or professors rumored to
have more difficult grade expecta
tions.
Senior Eddie Garcia, chair of
the Student Advisory Group on
Undergraduate Education, said he
also believes one of the main draw
backs to the proposal would be a
decline in experimentation.
"My primary concern is based
on my own experience as an engi
neering Not having the F
grade has allowed me and a lot of
other students to take risks in tak
ing classes outside the major,"
Garcia said. "I've always defended
not having the F as a tool for aca
demic freedom."

Garcia also expressed concern
over the lack of student input in
the decision process, pointing out
that the advisory group was not
consulted by the senate's Commit
tee on Academic Appraisal and
Achievement during the proposal's
construction.
Junior Anietie Ekanem, a mem
ber of newly elected Council of
Presidents, said he is bothered by
the restricted debate surrounding
the proposal.
"I understand that the commit
tee had a few Stanford students on
it, but I think this has to go up for
general discussion," he said. "1
would hope [the committee] would
not want to steamroll us like the
administration steamrolled some
of the administrative units during
budget cuts.
"I think the whole concept of an
F needs to be worked out," he
added, pointing out that there is
little substantive difference
between "NP" and F.
ASSU graduate senator
Nawwar Kasrawi said he believes
there needs to be more research
before substantive changes in the
grading policy are adopted.
"I feel that a decision of this
importance should not be made in
a closed, confidential atmosphere,"
he said, pointing out that there has
been some concern about bias in
the faculty survey upon which the
policy is based.
Doctoral candidate Derek Miya
hara, who also serves as a resident
fellow in Okada, said he does not
believe the changes would have a
large impact on graduate students.
He added that the law, medicine
and business schools each have
their own grading policies and that
it is unlikely that engineering and
humanities graduate students will
receive failing grades.
