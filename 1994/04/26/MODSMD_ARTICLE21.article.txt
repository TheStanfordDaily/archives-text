# N'Gai Croal: fly in the buttermilk
## Back to the cradle: infantilization on the Farm 
### 
Dear Mom,
DO YOU remember my excitement
about the prospect of attending a
university that treated its students
with care, flexibility, understanding and
respect — like adults? For a lad coming
from a land more inflexible and unsympa
thetic, such a place was a dream.
Alas, there is often a great divide sepa
rating dream from reality, and Stanford is
not immune from reality's bite. For exam
ple, Stanford's drug and alcohol policy was
to Inform us of local laws. It was each stu
dent's decision as to whether he or she
would obey those laws. Enforcement was
left to the appropriate authorities. The
hands-off policy assumed that students
were adults, both responsible and prepared
to take responsibility for their actions.
Not long after I arrived, the University
caved in the face of government pressure
and complied with the Drug-Free Schools
and Communities Act, which obligated
Stanford to set up its own rules and regula
tions on drugs and alcohol, and to enforce

them. The first casualty was Stuart lieges,
a highly popular computer science lecturer.
Me was fired from Stanford, but not
because he had been caught violating Stan
ford's drug and alcohol policy. He was fired
for saying that he would not refrain from
carrying drugs with him on campus and for
saying that he would continue to tell stu
dents that he found drug use beneficial —
and not at all harmful to his life.
But I guess I understand where they
were coming from, Mom. You know how
college kids are: young, impressionable, and
completely unable to make up their own
minds. All it takes is one authoritative
instructor and abracadabra — Night of the
Living Baseheads. Mr. Stanford did what
you might have done. He got rid of the bad
man so we would be safe from his bad ideas.
After that, it wasn't much of a surprise
that they would regulate all speech on
campus. The University approved the
Grey interpretation of the Fundamental
Standard, a speech code that would protect
us from bad words like "nigger," "kike"
and "faggot" — "fighting words" that

could really, really, really hurt somebody.
It was like we were all back in a big
sandbox, Mom, where if someone said
something mean, an adult would come
along, seize the offender and wash his or
her mouth out with an economy-sized bar
of soap. I thought we had outgrown that
— you know, "sticks and stones" and all
that — to the point where we were intelli
gent enough to fight bad words with other
words. But Mr. Stanford didn't seem to
think we were smart enough to do that, so
back to the sandbox we went.
Now, they want to toughen us children
up, academically speaking. Apparently,
Mr. Stanford gives out too many A's and
B's, not enough C's and D's and can't give
us a failing grade because we don't have
an F, just No Credit. But Mr. Stanford's
employees don't want to give out F's
because they think they are too stigmatiz
ing. So they won't call it an F — they'll call
it "NP" or "Not Passed," to make the
grade more user-friendly. I guess it won't
be long before a C becomes an "NBA" and
so on.

The professors also don't like us to drop
their classes late in the quarter because it
can affect group projects and the like. So
they want to move the drop deadline up to
the third week of the quarter — before the
first midterm, after which our transcript
would read "W" for withdrawn.
But they're not just doing this for
themselves, Mom. They're doing this for
us. I mean, we can't possibly liave any idea
of how heavy an 18-plus unit workload can
be. So, rather than let us drop a class late
in the quarter, or substitute another one,
they'll discourage us with "W" 'sand
"NP" 's — an alphabet soup of disincen
tives.
I know what you're probably saying at
this point, Mom. Why doesn't the Faculty
Senate just ask professors to give out more
evenly distributed grades, but give them the
freedom to do what they must? Why don't
they simply explain to us how difficult a
heavy load can be, then allow us to try that
load on without fear of punishment? Why
won't they just tell professors that they
shouldn't make extra efforts to accommo-

date late-arriving students, but let the pro
fessors decide? In essence, why not sit down
and discuss desirable outcomes without leg
islating away Stanford's flexibility? You
know, treat us all like adults.
I thought this was a place that wanted
to encourage learning, experimentation
and intellectualism. But I was wrong,
Mom. Grades aren't indicators; they have
become punishments and rewards — ends
in and of themselves. Grade inflation,
adding or dropping classes and transcript
editing are only symptoms of what ails
higher education. It's too bad that $25,000
a year can't buy us a cure.
But I'd better stop writing now, Mom.
Lights out was two hours ago at 8 p.m.
Who knows when the RA might do a bed
check and give me more demerits? Or
worse, send me to Mr. Stanford's office?
Sincerely yours,

Dear Mom,
DO YOU remember my excitement
about the prospect of attending a
university that treated its students
with care, flexibility, understanding and
respect — like adults? For a lad coming
from a land more inflexible and unsympa
thetic, such a place was a dream.
Alas, there is often a great divide sepa
rating dream from reality, and Stanford is
not immune from reality's bite. For exam
ple, Stanford's drug and alcohol policy was
to Inform us of local laws. It was each stu
dent's decision as to whether he or she
would obey those laws. Enforcement was
left to the appropriate authorities. The
hands-off policy assumed that students
were adults, both responsible and prepared
to take responsibility for their actions.
Not long after I arrived, the University
caved in the face of government pressure
and complied with the Drug-Free Schools
and Communities Act, which obligated
Stanford to set up its own rules and regula
tions on drugs and alcohol, and to enforce

them. The first casualty was Stuart lieges,
a highly popular computer science lecturer.
Me was fired from Stanford, but not
because he had been caught violating Stan
ford's drug and alcohol policy. He was fired
for saying that he would not refrain from
carrying drugs with him on campus and for
saying that he would continue to tell stu
dents that he found drug use beneficial —
and not at all harmful to his life.
But I guess I understand where they
were coming from, Mom. You know how
college kids are: young, impressionable, and
completely unable to make up their own
minds. All it takes is one authoritative
instructor and abracadabra — Night of the
Living Baseheads. Mr. Stanford did what
you might have done. He got rid of the bad
man so we would be safe from his bad ideas.
After that, it wasn't much of a surprise
that they would regulate all speech on
campus. The University approved the
Grey interpretation of the Fundamental
Standard, a speech code that would protect
us from bad words like "nigger," "kike"
and "faggot" — "fighting words" that

could really, really, really hurt somebody.
It was like we were all back in a big
sandbox, Mom, where if someone said
something mean, an adult would come
along, seize the offender and wash his or
her mouth out with an economy-sized bar
of soap. I thought we had outgrown that
— you know, "sticks and stones" and all
that — to the point where we were intelli
gent enough to fight bad words with other
words. But Mr. Stanford didn't seem to
think we were smart enough to do that, so
back to the sandbox we went.
Now, they want to toughen us children
up, academically speaking. Apparently,
Mr. Stanford gives out too many A's and
B's, not enough C's and D's and can't give
us a failing grade because we don't have
an F, just No Credit. But Mr. Stanford's
employees don't want to give out F's
because they think they are too stigmatiz
ing. So they won't call it an F — they'll call
it "NP" or "Not Passed," to make the
grade more user-friendly. I guess it won't
be long before a C becomes an "NBA" and
so on.

The professors also don't like us to drop
their classes late in the quarter because it
can affect group projects and the like. So
they want to move the drop deadline up to
the third week of the quarter — before the
first midterm, after which our transcript
would read "W" for withdrawn.
But they're not just doing this for
themselves, Mom. They're doing this for
us. I mean, we can't possibly liave any idea
of how heavy an 18-plus unit workload can
be. So, rather than let us drop a class late
in the quarter, or substitute another one,
they'll discourage us with "W" 'sand
"NP" 's — an alphabet soup of disincen
tives.
I know what you're probably saying at
this point, Mom. Why doesn't the Faculty
Senate just ask professors to give out more
evenly distributed grades, but give them the
freedom to do what they must? Why don't
they simply explain to us how difficult a
heavy load can be, then allow us to try that
load on without fear of punishment? Why
won't they just tell professors that they
shouldn't make extra efforts to accommo-

date late-arriving students, but let the pro
fessors decide? In essence, why not sit down
and discuss desirable outcomes without leg
islating away Stanford's flexibility? You
know, treat us all like adults.
I thought this was a place that wanted
to encourage learning, experimentation
and intellectualism. But I was wrong,
Mom. Grades aren't indicators; they have
become punishments and rewards — ends
in and of themselves. Grade inflation,
adding or dropping classes and transcript
editing are only symptoms of what ails
higher education. It's too bad that $25,000
a year can't buy us a cure.
But I'd better stop writing now, Mom.
