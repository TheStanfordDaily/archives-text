## Volleyball still alive for Final Four Win over Pepperdine sets MPSF final against BYU 
### Kathryn Yang Senior staff writer 
Last night the second-ranked Cardinal easily
dispatched of No. 8 Pepperdine in a 15-13,11-15,
15-8, 15-13 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
semifinal match.
Relying on its hitting and serving all match
long, Stanford managed to keep the Waves at bay
with a concerted .338 hitting effort on offense
and 20 blocks on defense — compared to Pepper
dine's sub-par .283 average and four blocks.
Proving himself to be the go-to man in tight
matches, freshman Matt Fuerbringer broke out
of his recent hitting slump with an impressive
performance at the net. Swinging for a .476 aver
age, the MPSF Freshman of the Year led all
attackers with 41 kills on the night.
And while sophomore All-MPSF first-team
honoree Mike Lambert struggled by hitting only
.128, freshman middle blocker Michael Hoefer
picked up the slack with an unheard of 17 kills in
18 attempts for a near-perfect .944 attacking per
centage.
Despite all that offense, the Waves still man
aged to keep the games close. After jumping out
to a quick 4-0 lead in the first game, Pepperdine
forced the Cardinal to scratch its way to an even
tual 11-6 lead.
Then the game shifted momentum, as the
Waves fought back to take a 13-12 advantage on a
Greg Shankle kill, before the Cardinal woke up
and responded with three consecutive points. The
match was put to rest with a Canyon Ceman ace
down the line — one of his game-high four aces.
"We're usually a good team," Fuerbringer
said. "When we get on a hot streak we can domi
nate and score four or five points in a row. But
our problem is that we get into our ruts too and
give up five points in a row."
That inconsistency shined through during the
second frame, as Pepperdine jumped out to a 11-
2 advantage and never looked back. Although
Stanford managed to close that scoring gap with
a 15-11 final effort, the Cardinal's play was pep
pered with both hitting and passing errors.
"We tend to shoot ourselves in the foot some
times," Fuerbringer added. "Pepperdine is a
scrappy team and we can't afford to give them
second chance with our mistakes."
Going into the third game with that mentali
ty, Stanford held a comfortable lead at all times.
However, when the Waves' setter Chip McCaw
aced in Pepperdine's eighth point to tighten the
score at 11-8, coach Ruben Nieves inserted fresh
man Stewart Chong as a backrow specialist.
Chong responded with an ace, a point-saving dig
and a pass to seal the 15-8 victory.

Then, with one game separating it from the
finals, the Cardinal lapsed into another inconsis
tent see-saw battle. Despite leading by as many
as four points at one stretch, Stanford allowed
Pepperdine to tamper with its destiny at 11 all.
Powered by a Shankle kill and a key block, Pep
perdine toyed with the lead, before acquiescing to
the a pair of Fuerbringer spikes.
"1 thought this team showed a lot of heart in
bouncing back from our lose against UCLA (on

Saturday]," Nieves said. "We were inconsistent
and down at some points, but we showed charac
ter by pulling this match through."
However, just pulling the match through will
not be enough tonight, as Stanford faces off
against No. 3 Brigham Young at 7 p.m. in the
final round of MPSF play. At stake is a wild-card
bid to the NCAA Final Four.
The match will be broadcasted on KZSU 90.1
FM, with Rob Ross doing the play-by-play.
