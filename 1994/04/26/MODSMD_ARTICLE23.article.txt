## Recollections of two championship seasons 
### 
The NCAA Championships.For
many athletes, the NCAA
Championships are the high
est level of competition they will
experience.
When I was a water polo player
and swimmer as an age-grouper
and then in high school, I had
dreams of going to the NCAA
Championships, dreams of win
ning the NCAA Championships.
In the past five months, I've
been a part of not one, but two
NCAA Championships.
Well, sort of.

I've been there — not as an ath
lete, but as a member of the press.
And I've seen two Stanford teams
— the men's water polo team and
the men's swim team — be tri
umphant at this pinnacle of colle
giate sports. It's not exactly what I
dreamed about as a kid, but just
being there, in the midst of all the
excitement and drama, was cer
tainly a thrill.
The road that these two Cardi
nal squads took to get to their
moment of glory was slightly simi
lar — both held the top spot in the
national rankings for the entire
season. But then they were so dif
ferent as well.
The water polo team was con
stantly challenged by their opposi
tion, winning countless close
games and losing a few, keeping its
goal of an NCAA title in sight; the
swimmers had to challenge them
selves to keep focused on a goal
they were convinced they would
attain, blowing out rivals Texas
and Michigan in dual meets along
the way.
The final tune-up for the NCAA
Championships couldn't have been
any more opposite for these two
teams — water polo was bounced
from the Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation tournament on the
first day of competition; the swim

mers set a new record for points at
the Pacific 10 Conference Champi
onships.
But once these two aquatic pow
erhouses reached the NCAA
Championships, they took care of
business in very similar style — by
being consistently outstanding and
capitalizing on their foes' weak
nesses.
In both Long Beach and Min
neapolis, the second of the three
days of action saw a Cardinal rival
stumble — three-time defending
champion California was defeated
by USC in water polo, and Texas
swam below their expectations in
the crucial qualifying session.
Both Stanford teams, laden
with depth, proceeded to simply
out-class their competition, and
the results were exactly the same.
In the fall, it was coach Dante Det
tamanti being hauled into the pool
by his celebrating squad. Just last
month, coach Skip Kenney took
the dive, with his swimmers, in full
sweatsuits, savoring the moment
alongside him.
I don't know which images
stand out most in my mind — the
water polo squad, which had been
defeated in the NCAA title game
twice in the past three years, lined
up across the bulkhead in Long
Beach's Belmont Plaza, holding
aloft the NCAA banner; or the
swimmers, covering the entire vic
tory stand at Minneapolis' Univer
sity Aquatic Center, with senior
Tyler Mayfield displaying the
NCAA trophy for all to see.
Perhaps it was Jeremy Laster,
both arms raised in the air after net
ting a two-point goal that keyed a
third quarter Stanford run. Or
maybe Frank Schneider, firing a
shot right over Trojan goalie
Andrew Tinseth's head with less
than a minute remaining, to seal the
deal.
Certainly the incredible first
day performance of Brian Retterer
in Minneapolis — he broke Ameri
can records in the 100-yard back
stroke and the 200 freestyle relay,
the Stanford record in the 50 free,
won his first individual NCAA title
(50 free) and was on two winning
relays — will be hard to ever for
get.

Then there were seniors
Derek Weatherford (200 back)
and Mayfield (100 breaststroke)
winning their specialty races in
their final meet for the Cardi
nal. And junior Kurt Grote win
ning his first NCAA title in the
200 breast on the final night of
the competition.
These images are bound to
spark dreams in a whole slew
of teenagers, who like me sev
eral years ago, ventured out to
Belmont Plaza to watch the
best college water polo players
compete for the NCAA crown.
For those young fans, and
even those of us who are a bit
older, it's hard to really under
stand the level at which these
athletes are competing. Their
skills are sometimes taken for
granted, especially here at
Stanford, where we have come
to expect a handful of NCAA
titles every year. These are
international caliber athletes,
several of whom will no doubt
be competing in Atlanta in the
1996 Olympic Games.
They're that good.
Kenney's swim squad was
so incredible that the hardest
part of my job was finding a
way to really portray the mag
nitude of their accomplish
ments, a way to tell you that
what they did was more than
just win all of their dual meets
and championship competi
tions.
I hope that people know
more about this team than
"Yeah, they won again."
In Minneapolis, there were
countless youngsters who
understood and fully appreci
ated the awe-inspiring efforts
of the Cardinal swimmers.
These kids were leaning
over the railing, earnestly
seeking autographs. Mayfield,
after swimming his final race,
held out his Stanford swim
cap and said, "Does anyone
want this?"
The cap was grabbed in an
instant by an eager girl of
about 10. You can bet she
won't forget where she got
that cap with the red "S" on it.

Since retiring from aquatic com
petition, Kyle readily admits
that he has gotten shorter, fatter
and slower.
