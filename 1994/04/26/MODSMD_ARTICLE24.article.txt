# Sailing cruises to win
## Women dominate waters at Pacific Coast Championships despite winds 
### Jeremy Stone Staff writer 
Though conditions were wet
this weekend, it failed to rain on
the Stanford sailing team's parade.
The women's team coasted to vic
tory in the Women's Pacific Coast
Championships in Redwood City,
and the co-ed squad placed third in
the Thompson Trophy Intersec
tional in New London, Conn.
In the women's regatta, Stan
ford was the heavy favorite as the
only nationally ranked group
among nine schools. Saturday's
action featured several capsizes as
winds consistently reached 18
knots. Despite the gusts and the
rain, Cardinal teams conducted
business as usual.
In the A Division, sophomore

skipper Gretchen Uznis and a
rotating crew of sophomore Sibyl
Diver, freshman Alice Manard,
and junior Polly Brown finished
third in their first race. They then
cruised to six consecutive victories
to put the division out of reach. In
the two days, they won 12 of 16
races and never finished lower
than fourth. They finished with
only 23 points, 29 lower than their
closest competition, UC-Irvine.
The B Division group also left
the other schools in its wake. Man
ard and sophomore Cinnamon
Ilampikian split the skippering
duties, and Brown and sophomore
Michelle Derbenwick served as
crew. Though they trailed UC-
Irvine by two points after six races,
they tied the regatta in the seventh.
After winning the next four races,
they opened a 16-point lead and
never looked back. They ended up
with nine wins in 16 races and a 22-
point margin of victory over UC-
Irvine.
The 51-point win qualified Stan
ford and the Anteaters for the
Women's Nationals at Yale May 26-
28.
Meanwhile, the co-ed team put
its number five ranking to the test
in the most prestigious intersection
al of the spring season. Held at the
site of the nationals and against
much of the competition Stanford
hopes to face in nationals, the Car
dinal needed a strong showing as
one of only two West Coast teams
present.
Due in part to the heavy winds of
the Thames River, "the dinghies got
off to a really rough start," said
coach Steve Bourdow. "We weren't

looking too good after the first day."
As a mqjor intersectional, there
were three divisions and three types
of boats: 420s (dinghies), Flying
Juniors (dinghies), and lasers. In
the A division, senior skipper Scott
Sellers switched his crew from
senior Sujata Patel to senior Britt
Johnson due to the conditions, but
struggled anyway.
Likewise, senior Jeremy Mcln
tyre and freshman crew Don Chen
navasin found themselves in the
middle of the B Division pack after
the first day.
However, in the C Division,
junior Charles Meade was impres
sive, maintaining a strong second
place behind undefeated Tufts Uni
versity. Meade's performance in
lasers almost single-handedly kept
Stanford within reach of the upper
echelon after Saturday, and they
rebounded Sunday to finish third
overall, behind No. 2 Old Dominion
and College of Charleston, the
fourth-ranked team in the country,
but also well ahead of top-ranked
Tufts and No. 3 Navy, who rounded
out the top five.
