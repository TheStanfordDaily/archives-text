# Tennis makes it to semifinals at Ojai
## Flanagan, Salzenstein, doubles ousted one match before finals 
### Mike Langford Senior staff writer 
Once again, the Pac-10 is
dominating men's collegiate
tennis.
When people talk about ten
nis, they cannot help but talk
— a lot — about the Pacific 10
Conference. In the 48 years
the NCAA has named a
national collegiate champion
in men's tennis, the winning
team has been Stanford, USC
or UCLA an astounding 41
times.
This year, either Stanford
or USC has been at the top of
the rankings for most of the
season. In singles, five of the
top 10 players hail from the
Pac-10, including four of the
top five. Seven of the top 25
doubles teams are from the
conference.
Needless to say, the Pac-10
singles and doubles champi
onships were bound to be
interesting.
"It was a really solid tour
nament for us," said head
coach Dick Gould. "And to
take away some kind of recog
nition for it was great."
In an informal tally of team
standings where teams are
awarded points for every
match that its players win,

Stanford tied with USC for
first place with 12 points, and
was awarded the Thatcher
Cup.
Five Stanford players began
play last Thursday in the main
singles draw for the Pac-10
singles title. But with Pac-10
competition what it is, only
three remained after the first
day.
Stanford's No. 1 player,
senior Michael Flanagan, easi
ly beat Arizona State's No. 5
player, Sergio Elias in the first
round 6-4, 6-0. The Cardinal's
No. 2 player, sophomore Jeff
Salzenstein, advanced with
similar ease in beating
UCLA's No. 5 singles player,
Heath Montgomery, by a score
of 6-4, 6-4.
Senior Robert Devens,
Stanford's third singles play
er, defeated Arizona's Chris
Jenkins, who plays sixth sin
gles for the Wildcats, by a 6-0,
6-7, 6-4 tally. Stanford's No. 5
singles player, senior Chris
Cocotos, scored a mild upset in
defeating No. 36-ranked Brett
Hansen of USC by a score of 6-
3, 6-4. Hansen had beaten
Devens in straight sets both
times the Cardinal faced the
Trojans this year.
Sophomore Jim Thomas, who
has been playing No. 4 singles for
Stanford, was upset in the first
round by California's Brian
Eagle 4-6, 0-6, 3-6.
"Jimmy lost the first set, but
then he won nine straight
games," Gould said. "He had
beaten Eagle in [the Rolex Nor-
Cal regional last Fall], but this
time Eagle got on a roll in the
third set."
The second round, also on
Thursday, saw Flanagan down
Washington's Ornello Arlati by a
6-4, 6-4 score. Salzenstein won
by the same score over Arizona's
No. 2 player, Jason Appel. Coco
tos continued his outstanding
play by dominating Arizona
State's No. 4 player, Paul Reber,
by a 6-2, 6-3 score.
After a close first set, Devens
fell to Arizona State's Sargis Sar
gisian in the second round. Sar
gisian, ranked No. 4 in the
nation, won the match by a 7-6,
6-1 score.

Day two of the tournament
featured the three remaining
Stanford players in round three,
the quarterfinals of the draw.
Flanagan faced Adam Peterson,
USC's fifth singles player, and
won by default when Peterson
forfeited the match.
In an unfortunate twist,
Salzenstein faced Cocotos in his
quarterfinal bracket. After a
tough three setter, Salzenstein
came out on top by a 3-6, 6-0, 6-3
score.
"It doesn't surprise me that
our top two guys did so well, and it
was great that Jeff got to play
against guys ranked higher than
him," Gould said, who added that
he was equally pleased with the
play of Cocotos in the tournament.
Friday also featured the first
two rounds of doubles action. In
the first round, both Stanford
doubles teams entered in the
draw survived. Flanagan-Coco
tos defeated USC's Hansen and
Chad Ross after a 6-2, 2-6, 6-3
seesaw battle. Salzenstein and
partner Vimal Patel, who was
held out of singles with a leg
injury, also came out with a
tough three set victory over Cal's

Eagle and Steve Lappin.
The second round, also the
quarterfinals, saw Flanagan-
Cocotos beat the other Cal team
of Dan Hiddleson and David
Melmed by a 6-3, 6-4 score. How
ever, Salzenstein-Patel lost to
the newly formed UCLA doubles
team of Robert Janecek and
Sebastian Leßlanc, 6-4, 3-6, 4-6.
"Jeff and Vimal had a great
chance to beat Janecek and
Leßlanc," Gould said. "That was
a tough match."
Although Saturday didn't
hold much promise for Stanford
players, it showed promising
competitiveness for NCAAs. The
two semifinal matches featured
three of the top four players in
the nation. No. 2-ranked Wayne
Black narrowly beat the No. 3-
ranked Flanagan 7-6, 7-6.
"Mike was solid and reached
the semis convincingly," Gould
said. "Black is at the top of his
game right now, but Mike played
him better than he did (two
weeks ago at USC)."
The No. 4-ranked Sargisian
faced Salzenstein, who is ranked
No. 51 despite an impressive 19-
3 record heading into the tourna

ment. After a tough three setter,
Sargisian finished on top 1-6, 6-
3, 6-0.
"Jeff was in control in that
match," said Gould. "But Sar
gisian worked his way back in
and Jeff didn't quite have the
experience to turn it back
around. But it was a solid effort
overall."
Stanford also lost in the dou
bles semifinals, where Flanagan-
Cocotos fell to USC's Black and
Jonathan Leach by a 6-2, 6-4
score.
"Mike and Chris did not play a
good match," Gould said. "They
weren't able to rise up. But
they've had a great year on the
whole, so I'm not that worried
about them."
However, the Cardinal wasn't
completely finished. In the open
invitational tournament, which
featured college players not in the
main singles draw, Stanford
senior Billy Wright made it all the
way to the finals before losing to
UCLA's Eric Lin, 3-6, 7-6, 2-6.
Wright and partner Ricky
Becker also won the open doubles
tournament, beating teams from
USC and Cal along the way.
