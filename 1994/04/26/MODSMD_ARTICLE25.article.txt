Once again, the Pac-10 is
dominating men's collegiate
tennis.
When people talk about ten
nis, they cannot help but talk
— a lot — about the Pacific 10
Conference. In the 48 years
the NCAA has named a
national collegiate champion
in men's tennis, the winning
team has been Stanford, USC
or UCLA an astounding 41
times.
This year, either Stanford
or USC has been at the top of
the rankings for most of the
season. In singles, five of the
top 10 players hail from the
Pac-10, including four of the
top five. Seven of the top 25
doubles teams are from the
conference.
Needless to say, the Pac-10
singles and doubles champi
onships were bound to be
interesting.
"It was a really solid tour
nament for us," said head
coach Dick Gould. "And to
take away some kind of recog
nition for it was great."
In an informal tally of team
standings where teams are
awarded points for every
match that its players win,

Stanford tied with USC for
first place with 12 points, and
was awarded the Thatcher
Cup.
Five Stanford players began
play last Thursday in the main
singles draw for the Pac-10
singles title. But with Pac-10
competition what it is, only
three remained after the first
day.
Stanford's No. 1 player,
senior Michael Flanagan, easi
ly beat Arizona State's No. 5
player, Sergio Elias in the first
round 6-4, 6-0. The Cardinal's
No. 2 player, sophomore Jeff
Salzenstein, advanced with
similar ease in beating
UCLA's No. 5 singles player,
Heath Montgomery, by a score
of 6-4, 6-4.
Senior Robert Devens,
Stanford's third singles play
er, defeated Arizona's Chris
Jenkins, who plays sixth sin
gles for the Wildcats, by a 6-0,
6-7, 6-4 tally. Stanford's No. 5
singles player, senior Chris
Cocotos, scored a mild upset in
defeating No. 36-ranked Brett
Hansen of USC by a score of 6-
3, 6-4. Hansen had beaten
Devens in straight sets both
times the Cardinal faced the
Trojans this year.
