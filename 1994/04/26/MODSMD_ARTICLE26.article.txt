## Women's golf heads to Pac-10 tournament 
### Seth Goldstein Staff writer 
Is it good to be a big fish in a
small pond?
Not if the pond is populated by
piranhas.
The third-ranked Stanford
women's golf team jumped into
that pond yesterday at the Pac-10
Championships at the Brentwood
Country Club in Bel Air, Calif. The
three-day contest will run through
tomorrow. Nine of the conference
schools (Cal does not have a
women's golf team) are in atten
dance.
The Pac-10 is easily the
strongest conference in women's
golf this year. It boasts six of the
top 12 squads in the nation and
four of the top five, including No. 1
Arizona State.
"We'll (the conference) definite
ly be a force to be reckoned with at
the NCAA Championships," Stan
ford head coach Tim Baldwin.
"The Pac-10 always does relatively
well, but this year we should really
clean up."
All this talent concentrated in
one place means stiff competition

for the Cardinal in Bel Air. Stanford
may be a "big fish" nationally, but
in the Pac-10 "pond," the team's
high standing means veiy little.
"(Stanford has] a full plate,"
said Baldwin. "We're ranked high
er than either USC or UGlj\ right
now, but anything am happen over
the next few days."
Arizona State is clearly the
favorite, with an unblemished
record against Pac-10 opponents
this season. The Sun Devils have
three potential Ail-Americans in
Tracy Cone, Emily Klein and the
number one player in the nation
Wendy Ward.
"I think they're locks (for All-
American status)," Baldwin said.
"This is one of the best threesomes
I've ever seen."
If Arizona State falters, No. 4
UCLA may be the team with the
most to gain. Brentwood is the
Bruins' home course and the squad
of small, straight hitters is perfect
ly matched with the course's tree
lined fairways.
Besides Arizona State's big
three, the favorites for the individ
ual title are U.S. Amateur Champi
on Jill McGill of third-ranked USC,
Lita Lindley of No. 12 Arizona and
Stanford's own Mhairi McKay.
The freshman star is slightly
nervous about being included in
such august company.
"I'm glad that people think I can
play that well," she said. "But I'd
just as soon not have anyone men
tion it. I want the team as a whole
to do well."
Baldwin said he hopes McKay
and fellow freshman Andrea Baxter
can lead the team to victory, but he
also expects big days from juniors
Jamille Jose and Amy Lawrence
and senior Melinda Daniels.
"The older players could've
played better last time out," he
said. "We need them to perform at
a level even with their experience if

we want to win."
At the California Collegiate two
weeks ago, the Cardinal finished in
second, five shots off the lead. On
the last day of the contest, Daniels
shot a 79 and Jose a 77. These
weren't the scores the team needed
or expected.
"I've only got a few more
chances to help Stanford," said
Daniels. "I need to make the most
of them. We can win the Pac-10 and
I want to be a part of it."
Stanford needs a combination of
youth and experience if it hopes to
place well. McKay and Baxter are
gifted players and the other golfers
have experience in Pac-10 play.
However, inconsistency has
plagued them all season.
"Early on, we were up and down
and none of us ever put it together
all at once," Baxter said. "I think
we've managed to put ourselves
where we want to be. Our last few
tournaments were good ones. We
just need to keep doing it."
