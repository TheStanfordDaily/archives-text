## Women's golf heads to Pac-10 tournament

Is it good to be a big fish in a
small pond?
Not if the pond is populated by
piranhas.
The third-ranked Stanford
women's golf team jumped into
that pond yesterday at the Pac-10
Championships at the Brentwood
Country Club in Bel Air, Calif. The
three-day contest will run through
tomorrow. Nine of the conference
schools (Cal does not have a
women's golf team) are in atten
dance.
The Pac-10 is easily the
strongest conference in women's
golf this year. It boasts six of the
top 12 squads in the nation and
four of the top five, including No. 1
Arizona State.
"We'll (the conference) definite
ly be a force to be reckoned with at
the NCAA Championships," Stan
ford head coach Tim Baldwin.
"The Pac-10 always does relatively
well, but this year we should really
clean up."
All this talent concentrated in
one place means stiff competition

for the Cardinal in Bel Air. Stanford
may be a "big fish" nationally, but
in the Pac-10 "pond," the team's
high standing means veiy little.
"(Stanford has] a full plate,"
said Baldwin. "We're ranked high
er than either USC or UGlj\ right
now, but anything am happen over
the next few days."
Arizona State is clearly the
favorite, with an unblemished
record against Pac-10 opponents
this season. The Sun Devils have
three potential Ail-Americans in
Tracy Cone, Emily Klein and the
number one player in the nation
Wendy Ward.
"I think they're locks (for All-
American status)," Baldwin said.
"This is one of the best threesomes
I've ever seen."
If Arizona State falters, No. 4
UCLA may be the team with the
most to gain. Brentwood is the
Bruins' home course and the squad
of small, straight hitters is perfect
ly matched with the course's tree
lined fairways.
Besides Arizona State's big
three, the favorites for the individ
