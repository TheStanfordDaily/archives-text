# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
'Tis the season of champions. Come spring,
Stanford athletics jump into full gear, challeng
ing for the top in nearly every sport. Two in par
ticular that the Cardinal have dominated lately,
women's tennis and men's gymnastics, gave
Sandra De Silva and Jing-Wei Liang a chance to
display their skills this past weekend.
For their outstanding efforts this past seven

days, De Silva and Liang have earned the honor
of Athletes of the Week.
De Silva, a freshman, amazed the orange
juice-sipping crowd at the Pacific 10 Tourna
ment this weekend in Ojai, Calif. Squeezing
into the singles draw because of injuries to
other higher-ranked players, De Silva qu'ckly
pulped the competition. Starting her domi
nance with UCIjVs No. 1 singles player, she
didn't stop until she had defeated the 32nd,
15th and 7th-ranked players in the nation.
After swallowing up USC's No. 1 singles
with powerful groundstrokes, De Silva cap
tured the Pac-10 singles championship by
knocking off three Cal players.
De Silva, a native of San Marino, Calif., was
labeled a "sleeper" by coach Frank Brennan
before the season started. Apparently, that
sleeper woke up just in time for breakfast, as
she made a meal of the Pac-10 field before the
distinguished Ojai crowds.

Moving from Pac-lOs to nationals, while the
men's gymnastics team failed in its attempt to
win its third consecutive NCAA title, it did get
the next best thing. Finishing 2.325 points
behind champion Nebraska, the Cardinal
ended its season with the highest point total of
the year.
Ixiading the Stanford charge was Liang, who
overcame a nagging back ir\jury to place sev
enth place in the all-around competition. Liang,
a junior, led the all-around until a fall during

his routine on the parallel bais. In the events
before his mishap — the floor exercises, pom
mel horse, and rings — he scored at least a 9.70
with a team-high of 9.8 on floor.
A former member of the Chinese National
Team, Liang has another year on the Farm to
try for Stanford s third national championship
in four years.
