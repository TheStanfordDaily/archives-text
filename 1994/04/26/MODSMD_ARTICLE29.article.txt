# Lacrosse secures Final Four berth
## Women defeat St. Mary's 14-11, will host UCSB Saturday 
### Emery Chen Staff writer 
It was wet, cold and miserable,
yet the Stanford women's lacrosse
enjoyed last Saturday as it battled
its way into the Final Four Tour
nament.
On Saturday, Stanford (8-1)
took part in the Northern Califor
nia Qualifying Tournament at St.
Mary's. The winner of the tourna
ment would receive an invitation
to participate in the Final Four
which will be held this weekend at
Stanford's Maloney Field.
At the beginning of the season,
the Cardinal's goal was to win the
Final Four in front of a home crowd
and now the team will have the
opportunity to do so. However,
there was uncertainty as to
whether the chance would arise.
Late in the game against St.
Mary's, coach Kay Cowperthwait
said to coach Cecelia Paglia,
"We're going to host the Final
Four but not play in it?"
At the time, the Cardinal and
the Gaels were tied with about 10
minutes to go after a hard fought
game, the outcome of which was in
doubt. Throughout most of the
contest, St. Mary's had led.
After Cowperthwait uttered her
statement, however, Peppie

Stephenson took steps to insure
that the scenario did not happen.
Stephenson, the sophomore
third man, moved out of her defen
sive position and attacked the goal,
making two key scores which
helped Stanford emerge victorious
over St. Mary's by a margin of 14-
11.
"[She] came up with huge plays
and finished strong," said Paglia of
Stephenson's play. In addition,
Paglia also praised freshman
goalie Hadley Abernathy, adding
that Abernathy did an exceptional
job stopping short range shots.
Cowperthwait also was happy
with Stanford's performance, not
ing that although St. Mary's ran
out to a quick 3-0 lead in front of its
home crowd, the Cardinal battled
well against adversity and the envi
ronment and pulled out the victo
ry-
Stanford made the finals of the
qualifying tournament by beating
California by a score of 15-6 earli
er on Saturday. However, the con
test was not as lopsided as the final
result may indicate as with 10
minutes to go, Berkeley called a
time-out while down only by three,
9-6.
In the end, the Golden Bears
were no match for the Cardinal
and especially senior Betsy Bassis,

who tallied five goals to lead the
Stanford offense.
"They couldn't stop her," said
Paglia of the lefty Bassis. "When
she was going to the goal, you
knew she was going to score."
The Stanford defense was
anchored by junior goalie Emily
Chang and several players who
stepped up as senior co-captain
Kate Applewhite was unable to
play due to a shoulder injury.
One of those players was fresh
man Rachel Price, a defensive
wing. Paglia said Price was doing
everything asked of her, including
denying passes well, although
maybe too well.
Price was injured late in the
game against Cal on an errant pass
that hit her in the eye as she was
running downfleld to cover her
position. However, she is expected
to be ready for the Final Four
Tournament.
The Cardinal will now get ready
for the Final Four this weekend.
In preparation for the tough
games, Cowperthwait said the
team will be practicing hard and
getting into peak condition.
The teams that will also be
appearing will be UC-Santa Bar
bara, Stanford's first round oppo
nent, UC-San Diego and the
Aggies of UC-Davis.
