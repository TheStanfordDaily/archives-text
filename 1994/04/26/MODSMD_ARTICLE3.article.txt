# Arbitrator hears Webb arguments
## 
### Vivien Wang Staff writer 
After a six-month delay, representatives from Webb
Ranch and the United Stanford Workers finally pre
sented their dispute over the ownership of trailers do
nated by the University to an arbitrator last Thursday.
Independent arbitrator Thomas Angelo will render
a decision within about six weeks, USW Deputy
Trustee Jon Showalter said. The outcome "would be
difficult for me to predict. The union put on good case
and submitted compelling evidence," he added. "No
doubt that Webb Ranch feels the same way."
The dispute began in 1991 when the University of
fered eight Manzanita Park trailers to anyone who
would pay the moving costs. The Webbs, who have
leased the 237-acre vegetable and
berry farm from the University
since 1922, took up the offer.
The trailers were intended to
replace older trailers deemed unfit
for human occupancy by San Mateo
County health officials. But several
months after the trailers were
moved onto the ranch, the USW,
which represents the Webb Ranch
workers, said non-workers were
being allowed to occupy the trailers.
"The county holds us responsi
ble regardless of what is decided,"
said Tom Hubbard, the ranch's
manager. "We still control the
housing on the ranch."
Attorney Terry O'Connor, who
represented Webb Ranch at the
arbitration, said the "union and the
company are both desperately try
ing to settle the issue."
O'Connor said the contract
between Webb Ranch and workers
makes "a clear distinction between
family housing and labor/dormito
ry housing."
"What is clear," he added, "is

that the Webb family has put in
over $100,000 into these eight
trailers, and the union has put in
nothing."
Families living on the ranch
prior to when the trailers were
donated have a right to those trail
ers even if they are not employed by
Webb Ranch, O'Connor said.
"There really isn't a factual dis
pute; it's a legal matter," he said.
"We're really getting along â€” this
is just a minor glitch in the road."
However, Showalter called the
dispute over ownership of the trail
ers a "fundamental disagreement
between ourselves and Webb
Ranch." The union wants the trail
ers donated to the tenant associa
tion, he said.
But Showalter also stressed that
both sides had important points.
"If one side was clearly right, there
would be no arbitration," he said.
The arbitration, which was held
on campus and took almost all day,
was delayed because of a clause in
the arbitration contract stating
that the arbitrator had to meet
with the concerned parties within
seven days of selection. Because
most arbitrators hold regular jobs,
this initially proved difficult.
