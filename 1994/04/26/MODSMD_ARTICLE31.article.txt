Junior Eva Bunker swings at a pitch in last week's game
against St. Mary's, which was called after two innings due to
rain. The softball team has had its difficulties with the elements
this season, but weather permitting, will face off against Santa
Clara today. The softball team (4-27) captured its first win of
the season earlier this year against the Broncos. Bunker, an
outfielder, is second on the team in runs batted in.
