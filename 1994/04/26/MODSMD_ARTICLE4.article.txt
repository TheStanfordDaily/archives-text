# University confronts arbitration backlog
## 100 unsettled cases 'poison' union relationships 
### Andy Dworkin Senior staff writer 
Administrators for the United Stanford
Workers and the University are trying to
dig out from under scores of backed-up ar
bitrations, some of which have been delayed
for years.
About 100 union grievances are now
awaiting arbitration with Stanford, said
Jon Showalter, deputy trustee of union
local 680. Some have awaited hearings for
as long as three years.
"Some [workers] die awaiting arbitra
tion, although that's a remarkable case,"
Showalter said.
Showalter said he wants to get the back
log taken care of and "establish a busi
nesslike relationship with Stanford."
The University also wants to figure out a

way to clear up the outstanding arbitra
tions, said Michael Vartain, the lawyer for
Stanford who is working with the union.
"There's no doubt that there is a lengthy
backlog of union grievances," said Vartain.
"We both recognize we have a problem. . . .
We hope to work wi'h the union to solve
both sides' concerns about the grievance
process."
The arbitration traffic jam is a problem
because it can damage the morale of work
ers, Showalter said, and "poison" the rela
tionships between union workers and Uni
versity management.
Showalter said he believes the backlog
stems, in part, from a history of tension be
tween the USW and the University. In the
past, he said, some union grievances were
brought for "political" reasons
rather than over contractual
questions. In response, he said,
he believes the Legal Office may
have acted slowly on arbitrations
in the past.
Vartain said he did not want to
discuss the roots of the problem
because "the University feels that
labor/management disputes need
to be solved directly" through dis
cussions between representatives
for Stanford and the union.
But, even if the problem lies in
the past, both Showalter and Var
tain said they are looking to the
future and hope to figure out a
way to take care of the backlog of
arbitrations and keep new pileups
from forming. The two men are
currently discussing ways to solve
the problem.
One possible solution is to hold
a "special conference" at which
lawyers for Stanford and the
union would meet and try to set
tle or dismiss some of the pending
arbitrations and schedule hear
ings for the remaining ones.
Showalter said he believes 70
percent of the backlog could be

either dismissed or settled at such
a special conference.
Vartain said he has proposed
preparing for a special conference
over the coming weeks and hold
ing the meeting at the end of
May.
Showalter said he has heard
the University proposal, but
would like to hold the conference
earlier. He said he has phoned the
lawyer to discuss the conference
and the two are still discussing
solutions.
Both men said they would like
to fix the problem and establish a
friendly working relationship
before negotiations start on
renewing the USW contract.
The current union contract
with the University expires Aug.
31. Showalter said an attempt to
renegotiate the contract will like
ly start in June.
Arbitration is a later step in
the grievance process spelled out
by the current USW contract.
Before a grievance is referred to
arbitration, it always goes
through a hearing by the
Employee Relations office. Some
worker grievances go through an
earlier step, in which the worker
brings the question or problem to
the attention of his or her man
ager.
