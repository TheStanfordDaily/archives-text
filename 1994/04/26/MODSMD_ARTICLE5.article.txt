# CUE proposes majors include more writing
## 
### Scott Van Winkle Staff writer 
Students will have to take a writing-in
tensive course within their major, and high
school credit alone will no longer meet the
foreign-language requirement, if changes
considered yesterday by the Commission
on Undergraduate Education are adopted.
The commission endorsed a proposal
that would require students to take at least
one "writing-intensive" course as a part of
their major course of study, while sparing
the current Writing and Critical Thinking
Program from a drastic overhaul.
"Our major impression was that they're
doing a pretty good job. ... If something
isn't broke, you don't fix it," said Geology
Prof. Gail Mahood, who serves on both the

commission and the Dean
of the School of Humani
ties and Science's commit
tee on Freshman English.
The committee, which
has no student members,
recommended expanding
the current "Writing
Across the Curriculum"
program — which works
with professors and teach-

ing assistants in various disciplines to de
velop writing-intensive classes — to all ma
jors.
Writing-intensive classes include such
features as teacher conferences, peer eval
uations and paper revision in an effort to


Mahood
focus on the writing process,
according to Freshman English
Director Kenneth Fields.
Mahood said the committee
also proposed longer-term
changes to broaden the scope of
Freshman English classes, which
are required of all freshmen and
transfer students, by allowing
TAs from non-English depart
ments teach sections.
"One thing that students
express dissatisfaction about" in
focus groups and course evalua
tions, Mahood said, "is that they
would like to see the topics of
courses be broader."
Mahood said such changes
could not be accomplished right
away because the funding for the
program is "worked out on a Uni
versity level." English Department
TAs currently teach all Freshman

English sections, so much of the
funding allowing the department's
graduate students to attend Stan
ford is tied to their participation in
the program, she said.
Having discussed the Fresh
man English committee's recom
mendations, the commission
turned its attention to the report
of its own subcommittee on lan
guage requirements.
History Prof. James Sheehan,
who chairs the commission, said
that while there was a "general
consensus" about ending the
practice of allowing three years of
high school study to meet the for
eign-language requirement, a
decision on the subcommittee's
recommendations would not be
made before next week.
Senior Josh Kallmer, who also
served on the subcommittee,
described the proposed changes
as "essentially doing away with"
the method of meeting the
requirement used by some 90 per
cent of current Stanford students

— high school study.
The University currently
requires that students have taken
either three years of a foreign lan
guage in high school or one year
in college in order to graduate.
"If you have a Stanford lan
guage requirement that can be
met without taking any classes at
Stanford, you're sending the
wrong message" about the impor
tance of foreign-language study,
Kallmer said.
To better emphasize lan
guages, the subcommittee would
require that all students pass pro
ficiency tests similar to current
placement tests, take foreign-lan
guage based classes or spend time
in a foreign country.
The standard for proficiency
would vary from language to lan
guage, Kallmer said, but students
generally would be required to
show proficiency in each of the
four "modalities" — writing,
reading, speaking and listening.
Specific requirements would

be determined by individual
departments. But Kallmer added,
"What you learn in high school is
usually enough to get you
through the (new) requirement,
. . . provided you don't forget
everything you know as soon as
you get to Stanford."
Stanford classes which could
meet the requirement in the place
of a test include third-quarter for
eign language instruction and "lan
guage across the curriculum"
courses, which generally include
some discussion of literature read
in a foreign language, Kallmer said.
Other options include
research, internships and public
service abroad, or attending one
of Stanford's overseas campuses.
Commission members stressed
the provisional nature of these
proposals. Mahood said her com
mittee still had "some specifics to
work out" before its report would
be presented to the Faculty Sen
ate's Committee on Undergradu
ate Studiea and the dean's office.
