Theta Delta Chi fared the best during
this year's fraternity Rush with 45 new
pledges, as official numbers from Rush
were turned in to the Office of Student Ac
tivities last night. With only seven pledges,
Theta Xi had the lowest number.
Sigma Phi Epsilon, which has 31 new
pledges, recorded the second largest pledge
class. Four other fraternities — Alpha
Delta Phi, Beta Theta Pi, Kappa Sigma
and Phi Delta Theta — each gained 20 or
more new members.
In all, 13 fraternities recorded double
figures in the number of new pledges ad
mitted. Phi Kappa Psi did not turn in fig

year, 247 men accepted bids —
down 10 percent from two years ago. That
number rose this year to 296 pledges, even

"We were very pleased with the guys we
met and of our current pledge class," said
Scott Reiss, former president of Sigma Phi
Epsilon.
Kappa Sigma Rush Chair Brian Hillger
said that his fraternity "had one of [its]
strongest Rush in four years."
In order to keep its campus residence,
in the past a housed fraternity needed to
have a minimum number of "sophomore
equivalent" pledges each year. This quota
was computed by determining the number
of pledges needed to keep the fraternity's
house filled mostly with members.
Fraternal Affairs Adviser Heather

Dunn said the requirement is now chang
ing and will obligate a house to be filled
with 90 percent members in the future.
For now, however, "no one will lose a
house," Dunn said.
Eighteen of the 22 fraternities on cam
pus participated in official Rush. Delta
Lambda Phi and the three chapters in the
African-American fraternity society each
hold what is called "in-take," or informal
Rush, at various times during the year.
This was the second year in which alco
hol was completely banned during the en
tire two-week Rush period. According to
Dunn, the fraternity Rush chairs did a
"good job" in planning activities which did
not involve alcohol, especially during the
