# Stanford to host economic forum
## 
### Linda Friedlieb Editorial staff 
Just days before the freshmen arrive for Orientation, an
other group of newcomers will hold their own seminars on the
Farm.
The World Economic Forum, an international group of
economists and industry leaders based in Geneva, Switzerland,
will hold an "industry summit" at Stanford Sept. 18-20.
The summit has a dual purpose, according to William Miller,
a management professor at the Graduate School of Business who
is helping to coordinate the event. Economically, the planners
hope to educate industry leaders about issues afTecting their own
and related industries; socially, the conference should provide a
chance for the same people to get to know one another.
The summit will be patterned after a similar conference held
last year at MIT, Miller added. In the future, the World Eco
nomic Forum plans to hold conferences annually at locations
around the world.
The conference will begin and end with overarching themes
explored through speakers, many of whom Miller said will be
associated with the University and fairly prominent in eco
nomics and industry. However, Miller declined to name the
speakers because they have yet to commit to the conference.
A number of panels will also discuss issues of interest to spe
cific industries. For example, Miller cited information, auto
mobiles, pharmaceuticals and health care as industries likely to
be discussed.
