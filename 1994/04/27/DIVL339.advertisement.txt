ASSOCIATION
The Stanford Engineering Association (SEA) is made up of a board of nine
Stanford engineering students. SEA was formed over ten years ago with
the main purpose of distributing funds obtained through the overseeing of
Nuts & Mud, the concession business on the bottom floor of Terman
Engineering. Our objective is to allocate these funds to programs which
benefit and enrich the Stanford engineering community.
