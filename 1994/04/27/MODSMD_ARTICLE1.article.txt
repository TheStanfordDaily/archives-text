### Bur Herman Editorial staff 
Four Stanford professors have been elected to the
prestigious National Academy of Sciences, the Acade
my announced yesterday.
Out of a total membership of 1,710 people, Stanford
now holds 105 positions in the Academy, with an addi
tional five members from the Hoover Institution. Elec
tion to the Academy is generally regarded as one of the
highest honors that can be awarded to a scientist.
The new Stanford members are Psychology Prof.
John H. Flavell, Physics Prof. Robert B. Laughlin, De
velopmental Biology Prof. Lucille Shapiro and Eco
nomics Prof. Robert B. Wilson.
The Academy was established by Congress in 1863,
and the group's founding act states that its role is to
serve as an official adviser to the federal government in
matters of science and technology.
Flavell said he was "very excited" to be elected to the
Academy. There are only 60 psychologists in the Acad
emy, and only four members in his field of developmen
tal psychology, Flavell said.
Flavell first gained national prominence with his
book on Jean Piaget, the psychologist who conducted
famous studies on children. Flavell subsequently fo
cused his research on "egocentric thinking," and
showed that even though young children are aware
that others have different perspectives than their own,
they are unable to use this in their communication.
Laughlin has concentrated his research in the area of
condensed matter physics. In his current work, he is try
ing to create a theory to explain high temperature super
conductors, which work at much higher temperatures
than previously discovered superconducting materials.
"It's a great honor," Laughlin said. "I'm enjoying
having been selected."
Shapiro said she was "surprised" and "delighted" at
