# With honors
## 4 named to science academy 
### Bur Herman Editorial staff 
Four Stanford professors have been elected to the
prestigious National Academy of Sciences, the Acade
my announced yesterday.
Out of a total membership of 1,710 people, Stanford
now holds 105 positions in the Academy, with an addi
tional five members from the Hoover Institution. Elec
tion to the Academy is generally regarded as one of the
highest honors that can be awarded to a scientist.
The new Stanford members are Psychology Prof.
John H. Flavell, Physics Prof. Robert B. Laughlin, De
velopmental Biology Prof. Lucille Shapiro and Eco
nomics Prof. Robert B. Wilson.
The Academy was established by Congress in 1863,
and the group's founding act states that its role is to
serve as an official adviser to the federal government in
matters of science and technology.
Flavell said he was "very excited" to be elected to the
Academy. There are only 60 psychologists in the Acad
emy, and only four members in his field of developmen
tal psychology, Flavell said.
Flavell first gained national prominence with his
book on Jean Piaget, the psychologist who conducted
famous studies on children. Flavell subsequently fo
cused his research on "egocentric thinking," and
showed that even though young children are aware
that others have different perspectives than their own,
they are unable to use this in their communication.
Laughlin has concentrated his research in the area of
condensed matter physics. In his current work, he is try
ing to create a theory to explain high temperature super
conductors, which work at much higher temperatures
than previously discovered superconducting materials.
"It's a great honor," Laughlin said. "I'm enjoying
having been selected."
Shapiro said she was "surprised" and "delighted" at
her election to the Academy.
"In the five years since (the
Developmental Biology) depart
ment was established, we've had a
faculty member named to the
Academy every year â€” I think
that's pretty remarkable," Shapiro
said. "And there are many more in
the pipeline."
"We had an enormous party"
yesterday afternoon to celebrate
the announcement, Shapiro said.
Shapiro helped Stanford estab
lish the Department of Develop
mental Biology in 1989. Her
research is focused on the ques
tion of how a one-dimensional
genetic code is translated into the
three-dimensional organization of
a cell.
Wilson has focused his research
on the role of incentives and the
effects of differences in information
in multi-person decisions.
He also helped design the auc
tion system that will be used this
year by the Federal Communica
tions Commission to sell radio spec
trum licenses.
