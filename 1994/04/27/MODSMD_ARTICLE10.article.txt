Crash kills 259 people
NAGOYA, Japan (AP) — A Taiwanese
jetliner crashed and burned while trying to
land at an airport in central Japan yester
day night, killing at least 259 people and
narrowly missing a nearby housing area.
The China Airlines A3OO-600R Airbus
had 271 people on board. Airport officials
said 10 were being treated in hospitals and
two were unaccounted for.
Minutes before the crash, pilot Wang
Lo-chi radioed that he would abandon his
landing attempt and try again, the Trans
port Ministry said. The pilot did not give a
reason or indicate any trouble.
Top quark discovered
BATAVIA, 111. (AP) — A team of 440
scientists has successfully concluded an
intensive, 17-year search for one of the

most elusive and mysterious objects in the
universe — the top quark.
Yesterday, researchers at the Fermi
National Accelerator Laboratory
announced they had found the first evi
dence of its existence.
If confirmed, it would support our basic
understanding of the nature of time, mat
ter and the universe.
"If it had not been discovered ... I think
the whole picture of the universe would
have collapsed," said Michael Riordan at
the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center.
The finding also would mark the end of
a worldwide search for the six quarks that
make up protons and neutrons inside
atoms.
"We have not yet observed enough
examples of top quark production to estab
lish the particle's existence beyond ques
tion," said Melvyn Shochet, a University of
Chicago physicist involved in the research.
