JOHANNESBURG, South
Africa (AP) â€” Black South
Africans made history yester
day, voting by the tens of
thousands to take control of
their country for the first
time since whites arrived 342
years ago.
Refusing to be cowed by a
wave of deadly bombings, the
elderly and infirm came in
droves from squatter settle
ments and thatched villages to
mark a simple cross on a piece
of paper.
Some literally crawled and
others were pushed to the polls
in wheelbarrows. Many broke
down in tears after making
their mark.
"We need freedom," said

72-year-old Florence Ndiman
gele, voting with other elderly
people near Cape Town. "We
are tired of being slaves."
Despite late-arriving ballots
and lines so long in some
places that people collapsed,
the mood among blacks cast
ing the first vote of their lives
was jubilant.
Yesterday's voting was
reserved for the aged,
invalids, people in hospitals
and the military. Genered vot
ing begins today, when
African National Congress
leader Nelson Mandela and
President F.W. de Klerk will
cast their ballots.
"Today marks the dawn of
our freedom," Mandela said.

For Gladys Shabalala, a 62-
year-old retired nurse voting
near Durban, it was a day of
immeasurable significance.
"There have been so many
white elections," she said. "I
used to pass the posters on the
road and dream about
whether I would be able to
vote. That's why I came so
early, to see if this is really
happening."
Her seven daughters, she
said, will see "a real new South
Africa."
Alter two days of bombings
by suspected right-wingers
that killed 21 people and
injured more than 150, no vio
lence was reported yesterday.
Election officials said they were

generally pleased with the vot
ing, despite some glitches.
The heavy turnout was a
striking repudiation of the
bomb-throwers, as blacks
went out of their way to show
they would not be denied their
moment of glory.
"I can't wait to vote," said
29-year-old David Maimola,
speaking from a hospital bed
where he is recovering from
injuries sustained in a bomb
blast Sunday.
"After what has happened
to me ... I want a new govern
ment."
The election, which is set to
conclude tomorrow night, will
select a national assembly and
nine provincial assemblies.
