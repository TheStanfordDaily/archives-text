## Editorial New policy gets 'NP' Grading policy recs by C-AAA are punitive, fail to solve grade inflation 
### 
THE PERCEIVED problem
with grading at Stanford: Too
many students get A's and B's.
And too many grade-grubbing stu
dents add and drop classes sporadi
cally to maintain their all-important
grade point average, upsetting the
learning processes of others.
The proposed solution: mark stu
dents with a letter, any letter, maybe
even two, to keep them in check.
While the proposal submitted by
the Faculty Senate's Committee on
Academic Appraisal and Achieve
ment is not this simple, it comes
remarkably close. And for this, the
C-AAA deserves an F, or an "NP"
(not passed), to permanently mark
its failure to understand the materi
al in the given time.
The C-AAA has proposed a new,
comprehensive grading policy to
force accountability upon students
with a handful of scheduling
changes and new grade notations.
The proposal, which will be pre
sented to the senate tomorrow and
voted on May 28, would alter student
transcripts in the following ways:
institute an "NP" (not passed) to
denote failed classes; move the dead
line to drop courses up from right
before the final exam to the end of
the third week of the quarter; give
students a "W" for any course they
dropped between the end of the third
and eighth weeks of classes ; mark an
"RP" for classes that were retaken.
(Students could only retake classes
in which they received lower than a
C-.) The new grade would be marked
with an asterisk to denote a second
attempt; extend the pass/no credit
deadline from the third week of the
quarter to the end of the sixth week;
and move the deadline for adding
courses from the seventh week to the
third week of the quarter.
If the proposal's trying to allevi
ate the problem of grade inflation, it

misses by a long shot. It is illogical to
think that adding a few damning
marks ("NFj" "W," etc.) on one end of
the grading spectrum will decrease
the currently excessive number of
A's and B's on the other end to a
more respectable level.
The "NP" and the stringent
retake policy only heap the punish
ment onto those who are already
struggling — with more difficult
classes, or just more classes.
The proposal's early drop dead
line and its "W" effectively extin
guish the spirit of academic adven
ture, invoking a new educational
philosophy that discourages experi
mentation. It forgets about the pro
cess of learning, and places the
emphasis largely on grades and the
final product.
The shift in philosophy is even
more disturbing since it is almost
entirely initiated by faculty, with min
imal student input — even though it
most significantly affects students.
In addition, the two sets of ques
tionnaires, which were directed at
faculty and showed about 75 percent
favoring a more historical transcript
(including records of failing perfor
mances), contained such leading
questions as, "Do you agree that the
preponderance of A grades makes the
indication and reward of truly excel
lent student performances difficult?"
With A's and B's making up 93
percent of the grades assigned last
year, the credibility of these grades
may indeed be held in question. The
policy proposed by the C-AAA, how
ever, does not properly address this
problem and unfairly concentrates
on penalizing students. To maximize
equity and effectiveness, perhaps
courses that generate outstanding
grade inflation or dropout rates
could be examined more closely on a
case-by-case basis.
What is needed is a more even
handed approach to taming grade
inflation that demands the same
accountability and solicits an equal
amount of input from faculty and
students.
When the faculty is able to grade
its own inflationary practices, maybe
then it will be able to grade students.
