## A 						Toblerone trip to heaven 
### 
WHEN I DIE, you can send me to
Switzerland. I never really
believed in heaven anyway, and
even if I can make it in (doubtful), it
always seemed a little boring.
My experience in Basel, Switzerland,
was only about 15 hours long, on a one
day stopover between Eurail night trains
from Paris to Italy. Limited, yes, but the
city fulfilled Switzerland's promise of the
fabled Utopia so well it was almost eerie.
Ironically, Basel borders the Rhine
near the French border, and is actually
known as "more European" (i.e. more
polluted) and "less charming" (i.e. indus
trial) than other parts of Switzerland.
But in Basel, pollution amounts to
colorful, artistic graffiti on highway
overpasses, and only a few smokestacks
peek out in the distance amid rows of
cottage-like houses.
I chose Basel as a stop on my trip
because of its art collections, many of
which were acquired when Germany
decided to do away with "decadent" mas
terpieces during the rise of Nazism. By
the time I left, I was convinced Basel was
the most pristine place I had ever been —
Utopia was not just a state of cleanliness,
it was a way of life.
Unlike much of the rest of Europe,
Basel drivers actually wait for pedestri
ans to cross the street. Most streets and
buildings are wheelchair accessible,
stores and restaurants open early and
close late and even the pigeons are clean

and unobtrusive.
Outside houses, neatly-bound piles of
newspapers, cardboard and shredded
papers await recycling. The "fur salons"
have window displays of mannequins
wearing obviously fake fur coats.
For a city of its size, Basel has
remarkably few cars — most locals seem
to use bicycles or the electric tram sys
tem to get around. Even the distant
smokestacks never seem to spew smoke.
On a side street out of the plaza, a
mural of embracing interracial couples
of all ethnicities greet the many groups
taking walks — but never power-walking
(no Spandex to be seen anywhere) —
during lunch hour.
Strangely enough, despite the mural,
there seemed to be next to no people of
color living in Basel. Even more strange,
I did not make this observation until I
had been in the city and interacted with
people there for several hours — this
finally dawned upon me when I noticed
some children were casting wide-eyed
stares my way.
This realization came to me with a
certain level of self-consciousness, but
aside from a bit of innocent curiosity on
the part of these children I felt race was
less of an issue with the way people
interacted with me in Basel than any of
the other seven European cities to which
I traveled.
There really are no homeless people in
the streets, everything is in good repair

and people of all ages seem healthy and
self-satisfied. In cafes, strangers sit down
with each other even when there are other
available tables. People smile, make eye
contact and engage in conversation (most
everyone can, in three to four different
languages) — you often hear French and
German interchanged in the same sen
tence.
How do I know the Swiss are really
happy, you ask? Granted, my under
standing of the country is superficial,
but these are the people who came up
with Swiss army knives, Toblerone
chocolate and Swatch watches.
Meanwhile, Americans were invent
ing Uzis, Pop-rocks (didn't someone die
from these?) and hawking fake Rolexes
on the street.
Nevertheless, something was missing
in Basel. It was too nice, too pristine, to
the point of being sterile. Being the cynic
I am, I subconsciously distrusted it. But
perhaps what was most odd was realiz
ing that in all its perfection, it was, well,
a little dull. An uncanny resemblance to
my visions of heaven.
Well, at least the cost of living there is
probably lower than in Switzerland.

Basel, unlike Heaven, is not protected by
closed-circuit television.
