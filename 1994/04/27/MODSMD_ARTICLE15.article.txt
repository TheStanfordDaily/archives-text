## Bringing back the F (or 'NP') will discourage students 
### 
THE PROPOSED changes to the
grading system is reminiscent of
the backward policies of state
universities. The new F grade (which
would be called the "NP") will cut the
throats, dreams and ambitions of
many future doctors, professionals and
leaders alike. Failure is a part of life.
But if an F (or NP) is kept on a tran
script for a person applying to a medi
cal school, for example, suddenly the
chances for that person have dimin
ished, even if the person has the skills
of the best surgeon. By keeping an
"NP" on a transcript, it is directly
telling students they cannot learn
from their mistakes.
If the "NP" grade is passed, the Uni
versity should at least give students
the chance to retake the course and

have the old "NP" permanently erased
from the transcript.
Students here are stressed enough
without having to see a permanent
"NP" grade on a transcript that could
push them over the edge.
The other proposed policy of moving
the course-drop deadline to the end of
the third week of classes is outright
absurd. Such a policy allows professors
to abuse the system by giving
midterms, assignments and other grad
ed work after the deadline, thereby
forcing students to keep the class for
the whole term. If students do not
know how they are progressing, they
should not be trapped in any course.
This system would create more stress
for students as well as take away the
balance of power between the faculty

and student body.
There are other ways to exploit and
manipulate the proposed system. At
Oregon State University (which has
the same proposed policies already in
effect) many programs have been cut
due to a law known as Ballot Measure
5. Among other things, the law cuts
the budgets for state universities. With
the lack of funds that results from the
law, professors became "eager and will
ing" to flunk students knowing stu
dents would have to retake the course,
and therefore generate more money for
the university.
In comparison, Stanford has also
undergone budget cuts like Oregon
State. Most professors here are ethical
and generous to students, but there is
no question that the proposed system

has room for abuse.
The grading policy changes, as well
as the other proposed policies, not only
will add more stress to the students
currently enrolled, but will turn away
the "smart" students who would have
come here. The "smart" students
choose the best education, faculty, pro
grams and comparative university poli
cies available.
So, if the Faculty Senate is looking
to raise this so-called "academic excel
lence," changing the grading policy is
not the appropriate method. The sen
ate should look at universities such as
Brown (a grade-portfolio system),
instead of becoming another sheep in
the herd of universities.
