# KZSU will continue to air many speeches, but not solely for the Farm
## 
### 
I'd like to thank The Daily for
yesterday's editorial commending
KZSU's broadcasts of Jean-Bertrand
Aristide and the Dalai Lama. Not only
do we think of such broadcasts as being
of service to Stanford and Bay Area lis
teners, but they also provide valuable
experience for the students who pro
duced them.
KZSU certainly intends more broad
casts like those of speeches by Aristide,
the Dalai Lama and Mikhail Gorbachev.
In fact, the only time we don't broadcast
such talks is when we're not able to
because of staffing or technical con
straints or when we're unable to secure
permission from the speaker.
I'd also like to comment on the edito
rial board's second assertion in as many
weeks that KZSU's music programming
isn't of interest to Stanford students.

The Daily editors seem to complain
that our music programming isn't
directed exclusively at students. It isn't.
None of our programming is. It can't be.
Unlike, say, a newspaper which is con
strained only by the supply of trees and
ink, our privilege to broadcast is a rare
and valuable one. The last bit of FM
spectrum in the Bay Area was allocated
before most Stanford students were
born and the Federal Communications
Commission is rather particular about
how these resources are used.
KZSU is a licensed, non-commercial
radio station. Our license requires that
we provide educational, informational
and entertainment programming for the
communities in range of our signal. This
is virtually the entire Bay Area, a com
munity of 3 million.
KZSU can't cater exclusively to the
musical tastes of the Stanford campus
any more than we can program just for
the Law School. We are required to take
much more into account.
We try to play as wide a variety of
music as we can, paying particular
attention to what's not heard on other

radio stations. Choices about what
music to play is left to music program
mers — almost exclusively students and
alums. Obviously, the music is of inter
est to at least these students.
These very important considerations
aside, I'm left wondering how it is the
editorial board knows so much about the
music preferences of a campus as large
and diverse as Stanford's. Surveys?
Word-of-mouth? My experience in talk
ing to Stanford students is that most
have little idea of what sort of music we
play.
We're well aware of this problem and
do what we can. Publicity is a very tough
job for a small, all-volunteer staff. Other
students both love and hate different
parts of our music programming: no sur
prise, given how diverse it is.
KZSU is very much Stanford's radio
station. Not only do we provide the sort
of programming for which The Daily
praises us, but we also give Stanford stu
dents the opportunity to produce pro
grams at a radio station reaching a very
large and diverse audience. I hope Stan
ford students will continue to support

the station so they and their classmates
can continue to have this opportunity as
well as hear our music, sports and public
affairs broadcasts.
