## University introduces new computer-networking system Application designed to replace outmoded Folio program 
### Michael Slemmer Editorial staff 
Stanford students will now have
access to an enhanced version of the com
puter program Folio — used since 1983
for such applications as searching the
library's card catalog and registering for
courses.
Software engineers at the Stanford
Data Center developed the improved
application, named "Portfolio," to allow
more extensive use of the University's
networking capabilities for information
retrieval and storage, according to John
Sack, director of the Data Center.
In doing this, the University is enter
ing a new realm of computerization and
connectivity, said Ann Mueller, the cen
ter's technical manager. "Most universi
ties have campus-wide information sys
tems that are accessible on the Internet
(a global computer network).
"Using Portfolio will give students
access to literally thousands of other uni
versities' networks," she said, adding
that such data as phone directories and
course listings are often available on
these networks.
'Growing pains'
In addition to the innovations brought
about by the new networking software,
Sack said one of the University's primary
motivations for developing Portfolio was
the outmoded standard currently in use.
"Folio was experiencing growing
pains," he said, referring to the old sys
tem implemented on a mainframe com
puter which, while able to provide quick
and secure access to data, made the pro
cess of adding information difficult and
costly.
As a result, action-oriented applica
tions like Axess — which allows students
to input at their leisure such personal
information as their courses and address
es — are both difficult to implement and
are user-unfriendly.
Folio is also limited in its ability to use

certain types of data — text and multi
media files in particular, Sack said.
In addition, Sack said that "all of the
information must be located at the center
of the system." This causes problems
because the mainframe running the Folio
network then places severe limitations on
the number and types of functions which
can be built into the applications.
For example, the current system lim
its the types of searching a user might
perform on data contained within Folio,
Sack said. It also limits the students who
can use the service at a given time.
Axess, for example, can handle only 50
users at once — causing problems when
deadlines near and students need to reg
ister for classes.
Though the Data Center has improved
somewhat on the Folio application in its
10-year lifetime by connecting it to new
functions like Axess, the basic nature of
the system has limited its evolution.
A new standard
Portfolio, the newly implemented
data-retrieval system which was made
available to students over the network
just last Thursday, will improve signifi
cantly on many of the computerized func
tions made tedious and difficult by Folio.
The first major improvement included
in the new system is the fact that it main
tains databases of documents — contain
ing text or other data — and can auto
matically search for information through
the documents themselves or through
brief descriptions supplied with the data.
By including the site-licensed docu
ment viewer "Common Ground" in Port
folio, students should be able to view doc
uments created in a wide variety of for
mats.
But according to Sack, the real innova
tion here is that students and adminis
trators will be able to post documents on
the Portfolio network. "When we did
hands-on testing of the system last year,
most of the people who tried out Portfolio
told us they would like to see this feature

included," he said.
"Basically, we are making it possible
for people to publish information on-line
instead of . . . posting fliers all over cam
pus," Sack added.
Another improvement in the new soft
ware is the fact that it can be run direct
ly from the student's computer. The cen
ter is developing versions of Portfolio for
Macintoshes as well as other types of
computer.
According to Sack, this change speeds
up information access because the com
puting workload is shared between the
University's computer system, which
stores the data on the network, and the
student's computer, which acts as a
client.
Previously, he said, the computing for
Folio was done almost exclusively by the
mainframe computer.
In developing Portfolio, the data cen
ter also sought to improve the existing
software for searching through informa
tion available on the network. "It's like
going on a treasure hunt," Sack said,
referring to the difficulties involved in
searching through data without such a
software tool.
"If you know something exists, with
out knowing its location it's almost
impossible to find it,"he said, adding that
Portfolio should alleviate these difficul
ties when students want to search
through documents posted by the Uni
versity and other students.
By creating a collection of resources
that is managed in this way, Sack said the
Data Center hopes Portfolio will improve
student data access by a large margin.
Connecting to the world
The new software's usefulness does
not stop at Stanford's borders but poten
tially could provide students access to
information stored throughout the
world.
"It's absolutely amazing the variety
and wealth of information that's avail
able across the Internet," Mueller said.

"We're trying to make it easier for people
to navigate the information explosion."
Though in its current form, Portfolio
does not provide full access to worldwide
resources, Sack said that soon it will
include an interface like the one current
ly available through Mosaic — a program
which allows users to navigate the Inter
net through a series of "pages" which
contain information as well as links to
other pages.
However, the area within Portfolio
which will eventually allow students to
search for information off-campus will
never be as reliable as on-campus data

retrieval, Sack warned.
But "Portfolio should aid students in
navigating around the pitfalls in the
Internet," he added.
Currently, there are about 329 docu
ments available to students on Portfolio
— containing information such as the
administrative handbook and the Univer
sity alcohol policy.
According to Sack, the number of
documents is constantly growing, but
with the new search and retrieval
resources provided by Portfolio, "find
ing the data you need should be easier
than ever."

tem implemented on a mainframe com
puter which, while able to provide quick
and secure access to data, made the pro
cess of adding information difficult and
costly.
As a result, action-oriented applica
tions like Axess — which allows students
to input at their leisure such personal
information as their courses and address
es — are both difficult to implement and
are user-unfriendly.
Folio is also limited in its ability to use

certain types of data — text and multi
media files in particular, Sack said.
In addition, Sack said that "all of the
information must be located at the center
of the system." This causes problems
because the mainframe running the Folio
network then places severe limitations on
the number and types of functions which
can be built into the applications.
For example, the current system lim
its the types of searching a user might
perform on data contained within Folio,
Sack said. It also limits the students who
can use the service at a given time.
Axess, for example, can handle only 50
users at once — causing problems when
deadlines near and students need to reg
ister for classes.
Though the Data Center has improved
somewhat on the Folio application in its
10-year lifetime by connecting it to new
functions like Axess, the basic nature of
the system has limited its evolution.
A new standard
Portfolio, the newly implemented
data-retrieval system which was made
available to students over the network
just last Thursday, will improve signifi
cantly on many of the computerized func
tions made tedious and difficult by Folio.
The first major improvement included
in the new system is the fact that it main
tains databases of documents — contain
ing text or other data — and can auto
matically search for information through
the documents themselves or through
brief descriptions supplied with the data.
By including the site-licensed docu
ment viewer "Common Ground" in Port
folio, students should be able to view doc
uments created in a wide variety of for
mats.
But according to Sack, the real innova
tion here is that students and adminis
trators will be able to post documents on
the Portfolio network. "When we did
hands-on testing of the system last year,
most of the people who tried out Portfolio
told us they would like to see this feature

included," he said.
"Basically, we are making it possible
for people to publish information on-line
instead of . . . posting fliers all over cam
pus," Sack added.
Another improvement in the new soft
ware is the fact that it can be run direct
ly from the student's computer. The cen
ter is developing versions of Portfolio for
Macintoshes as well as other types of
computer.
According to Sack, this change speeds
up information access because the com
puting workload is shared between the
University's computer system, which
stores the data on the network, and the
student's computer, which acts as a
client.
Previously, he said, the computing for
Folio was done almost exclusively by the
mainframe computer.
In developing Portfolio, the data cen
ter also sought to improve the existing
software for searching through informa
tion available on the network. "It's like
going on a treasure hunt," Sack said,
referring to the difficulties involved in
searching through data without such a
software tool.
"If you know something exists, with
out knowing its location it's almost
impossible to find it,"he said, adding that
Portfolio should alleviate these difficul
ties when students want to search
through documents posted by the Uni
versity and other students.
By creating a collection of resources
that is managed in this way, Sack said the
Data Center hopes Portfolio will improve
student data access by a large margin.
Connecting to the world
The new software's usefulness does
not stop at Stanford's borders but poten
tially could provide students access to
information stored throughout the
world.
"It's absolutely amazing the variety
and wealth of information that's avail
able across the Internet," Mueller said.

"We're trying to make it easier for people
to navigate the information explosion."
Though in its current form, Portfolio
does not provide full access to worldwide
resources, Sack said that soon it will
include an interface like the one current
ly available through Mosaic — a program
which allows users to navigate the Inter
net through a series of "pages" which
contain information as well as links to
other pages.
However, the area within Portfolio
which will eventually allow students to
search for information off-campus will
never be as reliable as on-campus data

retrieval, Sack warned.
But "Portfolio should aid students in
navigating around the pitfalls in the
Internet," he added.
Currently, there are about 329 docu
ments available to students on Portfolio
— containing information such as the
administrative handbook and the Univer
sity alcohol policy.
According to Sack, the number of
documents is constantly growing, but
with the new search and retrieval
resources provided by Portfolio, "find
ing the data you need should be easier
than ever."
Stanford students will now have
access to an enhanced version of the com
puter program Folio — used since 1983
for such applications as searching the
library's card catalog and registering for
courses.
Software engineers at the Stanford
Data Center developed the improved
application, named "Portfolio," to allow
more extensive use of the University's
networking capabilities for information
retrieval and storage, according to John
Sack, director of the Data Center.
In doing this, the University is enter
ing a new realm of computerization and
connectivity, said Ann Mueller, the cen
ter's technical manager. "Most universi
ties have campus-wide information sys
tems that are accessible on the Internet
(a global computer network).
"Using Portfolio will give students
access to literally thousands of other uni
versities' networks," she said, adding
that such data as phone directories and
course listings are often available on
these networks.
'Growing pains'
In addition to the innovations brought
about by the new networking software,
Sack said one of the University's primary
motivations for developing Portfolio was
the outmoded standard currently in use.
"Folio was experiencing growing
pains," he said, referring to the old sys
tem implemented on a mainframe com
puter which, while able to provide quick
and secure access to data, made the pro
cess of adding information difficult and
costly.
As a result, action-oriented applica
tions like Axess — which allows students
