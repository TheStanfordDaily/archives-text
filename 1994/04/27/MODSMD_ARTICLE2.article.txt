## Pundit for the people speaks on urban America, class issues 
### Julie Makinen Senior stall writer 
Sandwiched between the likes of
loudmouth talk show host John
McLaughlin and his whipping boy,
"Mor-TAHN" Kondracke, Clarence
Page may seem a little, well, milque
toast.
Then again, the rough-and-tumble
"McLaughlin Group" may not be the
best lot against which to assess one's
personality.
Indeed, if you're from the Windy
n-i 1111 11 /-ii

City, you probably know that Clarence Page is actually
a rather feisty man, at least on paper. From crime to the
United States' policy on Haiti, the Pulitzer Prize-win
ning syndicated columnist from the Chicago Tribune
rarely fails to deliver a vigorous, left-leaning social com
mentary.
Page brings his opinions to Kresge Auditorium
tonight and plans to focus his 7:30 speech on a topic
often found in his columns, urban America.
Though he's constantly writing on the subject, "I
think the public is not as informed as they should be,"
says Page.
In an interview with The Daily, Page said such igno
rance may be in part attributable to his own profession
—to what Page calls the "pathologies of the press." For


Page
example, the media often distorts
the public's impression of urban
life, he says, by portraying poverty
and welfare as "black problems,"
when in reality more whites are
poor and on welfare.
"Black poverty tends to be con
centrated in urban centers," notes
Page, and the media tends to "cover
what happens near newsrooms,
which are typically in inner cities."
The result is a misrepresentation of
problems and people, Page says.
Another barrier which prevents
people from truly understanding
each other is what Page terms "the
other P.C."
"I think there's a 'conspiracy' in
America," Page says in only half
jest. "The politeness conspiracy."
"We're too hesitant to ask legiti
mate questions we have about each
other," says Page. If, in the name of
"politeness," whites are hesitant to
ask minorities about issues like affir
mative action, or if minorities don't
question whites on things such as

"white backlash," misunderstand
ings and misinformation can only
propagate, according to Page.
Between trading and dodging
barbs on "The McLaughlin Group"
and writing columns, Page pops up
in numerous other media outlets.
He often weighs in with commen
tary on National Public Radio or
the "MacNeil/Lehrer News Hour,"
and you may have seen him hosting
a public television documentary or
appearing on "Lead Story," a Black
Entertainment Television news
panel program.
While Page takes a liberal tack in
his columns, he hasn't shied away
from criticizing the Democrat in the
White House.
"W.C. Fields said, 'There's a
time to take the bull by the tail,' and
that's what Bill Clinton is doing,"
on issues at home, says Page. "But
I'm very disturbed about Haiti."
"The sanctions in force against
Haiti are thinner than the paper
they are written on," wrote Page in
a recent column, in which he sug
gested that the U.S. policy of turn
ing back Haitians seeking refuge is
driven by racism.
But it's rare for Page to blame

racism for problems — he's more
likely to discuss race, whether it be
in the context of the Rodney King
beating trial, relations between
Asians and blacks, or politically cor
rect language.
"Today's racial debate, almost
indistinguishable in the South from
that in the North, concerns
whether 'race' or 'class' is more
important in determining opportu
nity for black Americans," Page
wrote last year. "These days, I lean
toward 'class.' But 'race' still mat
ters, a lot."
Nevertheless, while race may
still disadvantage American blacks,
that hasn't stopped Page from criti
cizing other African-Americans —
such as Jesse Jackson or rap artist
Sister Souljah — from time to time.
"Anyone who seems to call, as
Ms. Souljah did, for black youths to
kill a few whites instead of each
other deserves to be called to
account," Page wrote during the
1992 Presidential campaigns.
Page's speech is the inaugural
Charles F. Riddell Lecture. A fund,
named for Riddell, Class of '38, will
help Residential Education bring
prominent speakers to campus.
