Q: Could a penny kill someone if I
threw it off of the Empire State
building?
— Afraid of Heights
A: Well, according to my pocket cal
culator and scale, a penny weighs
about two-tenths of an ounce, a
fact which might suggest to you that a
penny could never do damage to an object
as strong as the human skull.
But suppose that same penny were
being hurled at you by the best pitcher in
the National League. Or, better yet, it
were propelled at you by a jet moving at
twice the speed of sound.
Now that would hurt.
If you could get a penny moving that
fast, it would hurt you for two main rea
sons. First, the penny is composed (most
ly) of copper and zinc, meaning that it is
very hard in the sense that, given a
strength contest between your head and a
big penny, the penny is likely to win.
Its mass is also highly concentrated.
Unlike, for example, a pillow, the penny
can act like a bullet, imparting all of its
momentum in one location on your head
— a fact which increases the amount of
damage likely to occur.
OK, you say. By this logic, if the penny
drops of the Empire State building, then it
will continue to gain velocity until it hits
the poor, unsuspecting bystander walking
along the street below. And if the building
is high enough, the penny should be mov
ing fast enough to kill a person.
Now let's suppose the Empire State
building is about 1,000 feet tall. According
to Newton's law of gravitation, by the time
the penny reaches the ground, it should be
moving at about 1500 miles per hour.
In fact — if you remember Newton's
mythical experiment at the leaning tower
of Pisa which proved that all objects fall
with the same acceleration regardless of
their mass — you might be led to believe
that any object — even a human being —
would be speeding along at twice the
speed of sound when it hits the ground.
But before you go jumping off of tall
buildings to find out just how fast you can
get your body traveling, remember that
parachuters jumping out of airplanes can
fall distances much greater than 1,000
feet and still use a parachute to break
their fall before hitting the ground.
And I promise you that a parachute

wouldn't do much for a person moving at
speeds in excess of Mach 2.
The reason why the penny would
never reach the speed of 1,500 miles per
hour is the same force which stops your
roller-blades when you put on the brakes
after going down a steep hill — the force
of friction.
When a body moves through the air, it is
actually pushing aside billions of molecules.
Through a complex series of electromagnet
ic interactions, a force arises in the direction
opposite to the body's motion. In general,
the strength of this opposing force is
approximately proportional to the speed
with which the body is moving.
As a result, while the penny's speed
increases, the air resistance acting to slow
it down also becomes stronger. You've
experienced this same type of effect in
your car: as you drive faster, the noise
generated by the air rushing around you
becomes louder. This noise is just a
byproduct of the friction force between
your car and the air around it.
So, the penny reaches a kind of equilib
rium — where gravity can't make it go any
faster and air resistance can't slow it down
any more. This particular speed is called
terminal velocity. For the human body,
the terminal velocity occurs somewhere
between 100 and 200 miles per hour.
Because the penny is more compact
and lighter, it is difficult to determine
just how fast it will travel when it attains
equilibrium while in the sky over New
York. But even if it managed to reach 400
miles per hour, its small mass makes it
unlikely to cause any real damage.
Since the force imparted by the penny
on your head is a function of both its
mass and its speed, it turns out that an
0.2 ounce penny moving at 400 miles per
hour has roughly the same momentum as
a one-pound piece of copper moving at 5
miles per hour.
And, since momentum is always,
always conserved, your head will only
receive a small jolt when the penny hits it.
So breathe easy, Mr. Afraid of Heights,
projectile pennies are unlikely to cause
any serious harm.

between 100 and 200 miles per hour.
Because the penny is more compact
and lighter, it is difficult to determine
just how fast it will travel when it attains
equilibrium while in the sky over New
York. But even if it managed to reach 400
miles per hour, its small mass makes it
unlikely to cause any real damage.
Since the force imparted by the penny
on your head is a function of both its
mass and its speed, it turns out that an
0.2 ounce penny moving at 400 miles per
hour has roughly the same momentum as
a one-pound piece of copper moving at 5
miles per hour.
And, since momentum is always,
always conserved, your head will only
receive a small jolt when the penny hits it.
So breathe easy, Mr. Afraid of Heights,
projectile pennies are unlikely to cause
any serious harm.
