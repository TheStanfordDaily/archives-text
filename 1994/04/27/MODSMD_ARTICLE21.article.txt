# Bio prof studies viral reproduction
## Explains relationships between DNA found in bacteria, viruses

Outside the range of human eye
sight, microorganisms struggle to
survive and reproduce. Stanford Biol
ogy Prof. Allan Campbell investigates
the processes employed by viruses to
insure the transmission and continu
ity of their genetic code.
"My main interest that I've had for
most of my professional life has been
the interaction of viral DNA with
chromosomal DNA," Campbell ex
plained. His research focuses on the
reproduction of bacteriophage lamb
da, which is a virus that can attack
and kill bacteria.
He described bacteriophage lamb
da as having two "lifestyles." The
virus can kill a host bacteria cell and
produce more viruses, or it can
remain quiet and replicate in the cell.
In this state, the bacteriophage is
known as a provirus.
"If you replicate the virus in the
cells and then liberate the virus and
[the cells] die," the virus does not
need to be incorporated into the chro
mosome, Campbell said. In contrast,
if it is "going to be perpetuated as a
provirus, then you have to have some
means of ensuring that when the cell
divides, both daughters get a copy."
One of the most common methods
of securing transmission of the viral
DNA is for it to be incorporated into
the host bacteria cell's chromosome.
When the bacterial DNA replicates, or
reproduces itself, the included viral
genes are also copied. Their code is
transmitted to the bacterial daughter
cells, and in this manner the viral
genetic material survives.
When Campbell started his studies
of bacteriophage lambda in the early
19605, the association between the
DNA found in viruses and bacteria
was recognized but not understood.
Campbell's work revealed that the

viral genetic material could be com
pletely integrated into the bacterial
chromosome.
There are many methods to incor
porate viral DNA into bacterial DNA,
Campbell said. In the case of bacterio
phage lambda, a linear viral DNA
molecule is introduced into the host
bacteria chromosome.

Once the phage DNA enters the
bacterial cell, the ends of the two sets
of DNA are joined together. There is a
genetic crossover between points on
the bacterial chromosome and the
phage DNA.
Not all viruses need to enter host
cell chromosomes to reproduce. In
fact, many viruses never enter chro
mosomes, and some enter only by
accident. "There is one major group
[of viruses] where integration into
the chromosome is an integral part of
their lifecycle, and that is the retro
virus," explained Campbell.
The HIV virus responsible for
AIDS belongs to the group of retro

viruses. While this group reproduces
similarly to phage lambda, the retro
viruses employ a different method of
integration into the host's genetic
material.
Bacteriophage lambda has two
stages of life as a provirus in a bacte
rial host. The first step involves inte
gration into the cell's chromosome,
and the next process turns off the
viral genes that would otherwise kill
the host and prevent it from replicat
ing the viral DNA. Deactivating these
killer genes occurs with the help of a
protein called a repressor, which
turns off the transcription of most
phage genes.
Campbell described the procedure,
saying that "lambda has an elegant
mechanism of coordinating the turn
on of the repressor with the turn-on
of integration, so that in those cells
where integration occurs, repression
also occurs." The newly incorporated
viral DNA can then be reproduced as
part of the bacterial DNA without the
fear of killing the host cell.
The results of Campbell's research
have been applied to various organ
isms that are engineered to contain
phage proteins. The phage DNA
enters the engineered cells with the
help of enzymes. These proteins cause
site-specific DNA recombination,
which joins the viral and bacterial
genetic code as observed in phage
lambda.
Though he has researched bacteri
al and viral genetics extensively,
Campbell said his current work has
not been applied to human genes.
"Nothing we're doing now has any
immediate application to human
genes."
His lab is now working on relatives
of phage lambda to see how related
phages have evolved from common
ancestors and how they have devel
oped diversified mechanisms for the
DNA integration process.
