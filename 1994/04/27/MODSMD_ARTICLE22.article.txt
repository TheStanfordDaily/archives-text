## It's a Shaq-ful world After media blitz, what's left for Magic monolith? 
### 
He's in the air, he's in your face, he's
slamming one home at a movie the
ater near you. He's got everything —
except for the NBA scoring title. Look out,
Howard Stern. This guy may be the next
King of All Media.
Already he's the Real Deal. Orlando

Magic center Shaquille
O'Neal is a veritable For
tune 500 company. And no,
he's not looking to retire in a
few years and play baseball.
Rather, he wants to go
Hollywood. Full time. He's
made some soirees into the
entertainment world recent
ly, both as an actor and a
musician.
But Shaquille is doing

quite well in his current job as a professional
basketball player. He is an intimidating pres
ence in the middle for the Magic, tallying
many rejections throughout the course of a
game. But that virtually never happens on
the other end of the floor, where Shaq
dunks, dunks ... and dunks. It seems like
the only time I can remember Shaq himself
getting rejected was by that little kid in the
Pepsi commercial.
An NBA all-star in each of his two seasons
in the pros, Shaq has it made. He has
endorsements with Reebok and Pepsi, among
others, and will be a member of Dream Team
11. He narrowly missed capturing the first
non-Michael Jordan-won NBA scoring title
since 1985 by 0.441 to San Antonio's David
Robinson, who scored a whopping 71 points
on Sunday to Shaq's "mere" 32.

But even with the rigors of an 82-game
NBA regular season schedule, plus the play
offs, Shaq does not rest. There is fame to be
had. Consider his recent efforts:
• Shaquille O'Neal, movie star. In a true
stretch of acting talent, Shaq played the role
of a basketball player in the film "Blue

Chips. For his part,
Shaq had to say a few
lines, run, jump and
shoot. Shaq needs a little
work to become an
accomplished thespian.
• Shaquille
O'Neal, rap artist. Over
the summer, instead of
cutting up backboards,
Shaq cut a record enti
tled "Shaq Diesel." The

disc sold fairly well, and features the hit song
"I Know I Got Skillz." Evidently, Shaq,
spelling is not one of them.
Yet rhyming is an O'Neal forte. Consider
his shoe line, the "Shaq Attaq." That said,
here are some ideas I've come up with for
Shaq to keep himself busy.
• The Love Shaq. In a joint venture with
Wilt Chamberlain, O'Neal opens a chain of
"Hooters"-type establishments. Call them
sports bars with a twist.
• Caddy Shaq. In a tribute to that famed
Bill Murray cinema classic, O'Neal begins a
caddy-for-hire service that employs athletes
who attended college while playing football
or basketball but did not pick up any tangible
skills in their four years on campus.
• Shaq Mac. O'Neal starts a subsidiary of

McDonald's that caters to the 7-
foot-and-over crowd, a sort of "Big
and Tall" for fast food. The por
tions are large, and fortunately, so
are the doorways.
• The Shaquille. O'Neal creates
a theme park in Orlando adjacent
to Epcot. that commemorates the
French Revolution — with a '90s

angle. Hence, the Bastille name is
passed over, for it is considered
"too historical."
Those are just a few concepts,
but hey, O'Neal's only 21. He might
have even greater ambitions later
on. Senator Shaq, for instance.
With the income he earns, those
are not bad options to consider.

David is seeking a position as
Shaq's water boy after graduation.
Surely Shaq pays his people more
than minimum wage.
