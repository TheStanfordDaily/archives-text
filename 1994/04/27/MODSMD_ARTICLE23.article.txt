# Bring out the brooms
## Cycling crushes competition 
### Joseph Hei 
The Stanford cycling team started its
spring cleaning this past weekend with a
clean sweep of races at Chico State. The Car
dinal triumphed convincingly in Saturday's
road race and team time trials and in Sun
day's criterium.
No. 1 Cal Poly-SLO was notably absent
from the competition. However, instead of
letting up, Stanford pounced on the scoring
opportunity. Saturday's combined road race
and time trial scores were Stanford (459),
i.UGiDrvw (217), and California (357). Sun
day'a results similarly placed Stanford on top
(272), with UC-Davis (229) and Cal (143)
playing catch-up.
In Sunday's dramatic and high-velocity
criterium, the men's A squad overcame a
huge 59-point deficit against Davis to secure
a win. Stanford accomplished this comeback
and placed first through fourth. Grad stu
dent Bill Lloyd sprinted to victory, followed
by fellow grads Derek Bouchard-Hall,
Manuel Rodriguez and Takeshi Doi.
"It was the first time the As pulled it out
from a deficit," Coach Art Walker said, "We
dominated in a pressure situation, the way
it should be done. Our best guys brought it
home."
Stanford's successes at the finish line and
in the primes, or intermediate sprints, were
the result of tremendous teamwork.
"It was a team effort," Lloyd said, "There
was a lot of teamwork from Dario [Falquier]
and John [Schlesinger] to keep the race
together so that we could sprint when we
had to."

In women's A competition senior Nicole
Freedman churned to first place and again
showed why she is the number one rider in
the conference.
"She had another perfect race," Walker
said. "She won the race and all the primes."
Freedman herself more modestly empha
sized the teamwork involved in her victory.
"My teammates contributed a lot," Freed
man said. "Tracy [Timms] and Bettina
[Romerl gave me some incredible lead-outs
that helped me win."
Freedman and the Stanford women also
clinched Saturday's A level road race, with
first, second, fifth and sixth place finishes.
Timms, a junior, won with help from Freed
man, who placed second.
"The last mile or so determined the race,"
Timms said. "Nicole attacked and I followed
her wheel and we dropped the rest of the
pack."
The men's A road race again featured
titanic efforts from grads Falquier and
Bouchard-Hall, who took first and second
place, respectively. Falquier led for over an
hour and a half by himself, riding without a
draft.
"When I first attacked," Falquier said, "I
worked pretty hard to open a gap. At first I
was just trying to give my teammates a free
ride by forcing riders from other teams to
catch me. My teammates later told me that
the other teams just never quite caught me."
After Cal's John Vanheel did reach
Falquier, Bouchard-Hall made an extremely
difficult bridge from the main pack up to the
lead riders.
"The move was exceptionally
hard," Bouchard-Hall said, "those
two guys were two minutes ahead.
After I caught them, though, I
knew IVanheel] was in over his
head."
Falquier agreed with Bouchard-
Hall's assessment of their finish
and praised him.

"Derek is a veiy strong rider
and very knowledgeable tactically,"
Falquier said. "We worked togeth
er without verbal communication.
We knew what had to be done."
Later on Saturday in the team
time trials (or triple-T's), both the
Stanford men and women's cyclers
powered through torrential rain
and strong winds to victory. The
women showed why they are
National Champions in this event
by finishing more than one minute
in front of the competition.
