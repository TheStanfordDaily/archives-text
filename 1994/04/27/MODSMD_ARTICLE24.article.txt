## Crew can't get past Cal at Stanford Regatta 
### Heather Hardwick 
Amid dreary clouds and scat
tered showers, the Stanford crew
took to the waters last weekend to
face their most loathed competitor
â€” the California Golden Bears.
The Big Row was the feature
event of the Stanford Regatta, the
last home meet of the year. Along
with Cal, the meet also hosted
men's teams from Washington
State and UC-Irvine, while the
women faced WSU and UCLA.
What is now known as the Stan
ford Regatta is a smaller version of
the famed Redwood Shores Regat
ta of the mid-'Bos. In its original
form, this event showcased promi
nent teams from both coasts. How
ever, due to an increase in support
for the Opening Day races taking
place this year on May 7 in Seattle,
the meet at Redwood Shores has
been limited to a select group of top
western teams.
However, amid all this talent,
the traditional Cal-Stanford rival
ry dominated the scene. Darren
Rice, a senior member of the men's
varsity team, explained, "This is
always a big race for us. Despite
how any other races went, this is a
focal point for our season."
The Cardinal performed well,
with both the men's and women's
teams placing second in a pack of
four, but unfortunately the results
of the Big Row were very reminis
cent of Big Game. Every Stanford

boat to go up against Cal fell a bit
short in the end. However, the
focus was on improvement.
"We didn't have the greatest
race, but we were encouraged in
that we gained two seconds on Cal
(relative to the San Diego times)
and under worse conditions." said
senior Sarah Morse.
Jocelyn McCandless, the head
coach of the women's varsity team,
concurred with Morse's feelings, in
noting that the margins are
improving. Hopefully this trend will
continue, as Stanford will meet Cal
yet again at Opening Day and most
likely at Pac-lOs down the line.
Looking beyond Cal, both the
men's and women's teams
improved in the ensuing races. The
men's team went on to beat Irvine
in the afternoon, and overtook
Washington State the next morn
ing. The women's team coasted to
a 21-second victory over UCLA,
then claimed a convincing victory
over a physically stronger Wash
ington State boat.
"Over the course of the week
end the races felt better and better.
We're getting the rhythm and fig
uring things out," said Morse,
putting the results into an overall
perspective.
This weekend is free from com
petition, but the following week
marks Opening Day, as the Cardi
nal heads up to Seattle to take on
the powerful University of Wash
ington squad.
