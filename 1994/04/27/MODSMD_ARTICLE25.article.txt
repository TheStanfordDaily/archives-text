# All-Americans run for their lives
## Rodriguez, Watson pace Cardinal squad by combining speed, devotion 
### Jorge Chen Staff writer 
The first step is always the most dif
ficult, but after it is overtaken, it
becomes as simple as cruising down a
gentle hill on a nice, brand-new con
vertible.
And that is how the two Cardinal
NCAA indoor track and field All-Amer
icans felt after receiving their honors
last winter in the 1994 NCAA Indoor
Track and Field Championships held in
Indianapolis, Ind.
However, the two paths these All-
Americans have taken to reach the top
of the college ranks have been as differ
ent as the events they compete in.
Despite their differences, sprinter Rene
Rodriguez and distance runner Louise
Watson now form the nucleus of a
promising Cardinal track and field
squad.
Rodriguez, a sophomore 400-meter
specialist and the eldest of an athletic
family of two brothers and one sister,
did not start his athletic career as a run
ner but as a tennis player for his middle
school in his hometown of Edingburg,
Texas.
"After lapping many of my tennis
teammates during warm-up laps, my
tennis coach told me that track should
be my sport instead of tennis,"
Rodriguez said, who in his middle
school days dreamed of being a profes
sional tennis player.
Watson, a transfer two years ago
from Loughborough University in
Leicestershire, England, has been a
runner since she learned to tie her
shoes.
This life-long devotion to running
has given her valuable experience.
Before becoming an essential addition
to the Cardinal women's distance team,
Watson represented Great Britain in
many international cross country com
petitions as a 20-and-under athlete.

Stanford has Rodriguez's middle
school tennis coach to thank for send
ing the swift Texan to the West Coast.
Capturing a shooting star from the
Texan night sky, Rodriguez did follow
his coach's advice and clocked a nation
al record of 48.28 seconds in the 400
meters in the 14-year-old age category.
And he does not regret making that
alteration, with an NCAA indoor title in
the 400 meters under his belt and his
sights set at the outdoor title.
Stanford head coach Vin Lananna
sees the fire and enthusiasm of the
young Rodriguez as the beginning of a
bright future as a top collegiate athlete.
"Rene is a good competitor who is
developing into a very consistent, high
caliber performer," Lananna said.
Comfortable with the lack of pres
sure on him, Rodriguez feels that he
had nothing to lose and a lot to gain
from the championship experience at
Indianapolis.
"I was ranked 12th going into the
NCAAs so I was just happy to be a part
of it and not really expecting anything,"
Rodriguez said. "I also did not feel as
nervous as I would have been and I had
nothing to prove since the competitors
did not see me as a contender."
However, much to Rodriguez's sur
prise, he crossed the finish line eighth
that weekend, earning the last spot for
the All-Anierican honor. Rodriguez not
only earned that honor but he also
gained the respect of many of top colle
giate track athletes around the nation.
"Now that I am an all-American, I
feel as if 1 am not competing against the
big boys but am a big boy myself," said
Rodriguez.
Like Rodriguez, Watson has similar
goals this outdoor season.
However, after last year's disap
pointing finale to her Cardinal cross
country season where she fell one sec
ond short of an All-American title, Wat
son promised herself that she would

work assiduously to capture that title
this year in the 5,000 meter race.
"I was really frustrated since one
second means nothing in cross country
and I let such a big honor slip through
my fingers due to that one second,"
Watson said.
Before the NCAA Indoor Champi
onships, Watson was ranked ninth out
of 16 in the 5,000 meters but came out
with a surprising runner-up finish.
"Louise is more than just a great
athlete, she is an inspiration for all of us
that so many of our teammates wish to
emulate her leadership qualities and
attitudes," said junior co-captain Sarah
Truitt, who also happens to be Wat
son's roommate. "Personally, being
roommates, Louise gets me out of bed
early in the morning to work out, even
when I don't feel like it. But it definite
ly has improved my running since."
Watson's influence seems to rub off
on everyone around her. Her younger
sister Julie decided to join Watson as a
distance runner and is currently follow
ing in WatBonVfodtBteps«*by"-running
college track in England.
Lananna considers Watson to be an
excellent role model for the women's
distance team.
"Many of the ladies on the distance
team are very talented and are consid
ered to be of top collegiate caliber, and
actually having someone like Louise
pave the way for the other girls to see
how it is done is really helpful," he said.
After much thought, Truitt recalled
one especially memorable conversation
she had with Watson about her combi
nation of speed and work ethic.
"I told her 'Louise, after thinking
about it, you are so amazing running
two sub-five minute miles consecutively
while many runners cannot even run
one sub-five mile, not to say two,' " Tru
itt said. "Her answer was, 'That's why I
