# Spikers advance to Final Four with win
## BYU falls in tough four-game match 
### Kathryn Yang Senior staff writer 
Spiking, blocking and digging
with inspired confidence last
night, the young Stanford vol
leyball squad outgrew the word
potential and transformed itself
into a champion.
"We played like no Stanford
team has ever played before.
There were a couple things we
did tonight that I didn't think
we could do," said head coach
Ruben Nieves. "Our perfor
mance was definitely our best
game of the season, and it might
be one of the best matches that's
been played this year."
Facing No. 3 Brigham Young
(21-6) in the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation Title match,
second-ranked Stanford (20-9)
not only won the Newcomb Cup
as the MPSF champion, but also
kept itself in the running for an
NCAA Final Four bid.
Taming the Cougars to the
tune of a 15-13, 12-15, 16-14, 15-
6 victory, the Cardinal's fate now
rides on the decision of a three
man NCAA committee. Howev
er, with that win Stanford's fate
should be in good hands, consid
ering that the winner of the
MPSF title has gone onto secure
the last 24 Final Four wild-card
berths.
"Stanford should get that

playoff spot," said Cougars' head
coach Carl McGown. "They
played a fabulous match against
us. We fought tough, but they
deserved to win with the way
they were playing."
Firing on all six cylinders last
night, every Cardinal starter hit
above .300, with freshman Matt
Fuerbringer leading the way
with a game-high 34 kills
against only seven errors for a
.482 average.
Drawing upon that offensive
firepower, Stanford motored to a
8-4 advantage in the first game,
before stalling and eventually
falling behind 11-13. After a
quick timeout, the Cardinal
regained the momentum on a
Mike Lambert kill and an ace by
sophomore J.B. Taylor. Despite
that last-ditch effort, the
Cougars still managed to secure
its come-from-behind victory
with a smash by senior middle
blocker Ethan Watts.
After that minor setback, it
was all Stanford. The Cardinal
easily secured the second game
15-12, before breaking the
Cougars' spirit in the third
round.
Engaged in a tense tug-of-war
battle during game three, the
teams tied at two, four, five, six,
eight, 10 and 12 before BYU

finally took control with its
blocking game. The Cougars
gained an 14-12 advantage by
merit of junior Kevin Hambly's
block, which denied both Fuer
bringer and Lambert at the net.
Unwilling to let BYU go up
two games to one at that point,
Stanford regrouped and forced
two Cougar hitting errors to
send the match into overplay at
14 all.
Then, Lambert shifted the
momentum for good by crush
ing the Cougars with an ace on
point 15 and another jump serve
on game point. Sprawling on the
floor to field Lambert's final
serve, BYU's Pat Sinclair mis
passed the ball, and Stanford
middle blocker Brian Garrett
climbed the ladder to stuff it
right back in his face. Point
Stanford.
"That was the critical part of
the match," said Nieves. "BYU
was hanging its head after that
match, and the fourth game

went by quickly for us."
After battling for more than
two hours, the final game of the
match took only 30 minutes.
With senior setter Canyon
Ceman bending over backwards
and making tremendous plays
on both offense and defense,
Stanford made short work of
the Cougars in game four.
"Champions rise to the occa
sion in critical situations and
Canyon is a championship play
er playing on a championship
team," Nieves said.
Stanford has come a long way
this season, battling inexperi
ence and inconsistencies at
every corner. The Cardinal went
with two rookies at the opposite
and outside hitting positions,
and both future Ail-Americans
responded with veteran num
bers.
Ceman has battled back from
injuries to finally regain his
National Player of the Year
form from last season. And
senior swing hitter Joe
Burghardt has switched from
his natural middle blocking
position to assume the tough
passing duties.
