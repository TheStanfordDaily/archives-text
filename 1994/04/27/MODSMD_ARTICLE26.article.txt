# Spikers advance to Final Four with win
## BYU falls in tough four-game match 
### Kathryn Yang Senior staff writer 
Spiking, blocking and digging
with inspired confidence last
night, the young Stanford vol
leyball squad outgrew the word
potential and transformed itself
into a champion.
"We played like no Stanford
team has ever played before.
There were a couple things we
did tonight that I didn't think
we could do," said head coach
Ruben Nieves. "Our perfor
mance was definitely our best
game of the season, and it might
be one of the best matches that's
been played this year."
Facing No. 3 Brigham Young
(21-6) in the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation Title match,
second-ranked Stanford (20-9)
not only won the Newcomb Cup
as the MPSF champion, but also
kept itself in the running for an
NCAA Final Four bid.
Taming the Cougars to the
tune of a 15-13, 12-15, 16-14, 15-
6 victory, the Cardinal's fate now
rides on the decision of a three
man NCAA committee. Howev
er, with that win Stanford's fate
should be in good hands, consid
ering that the winner of the
MPSF title has gone onto secure
the last 24 Final Four wild-card
berths.
"Stanford should get that

playoff spot," said Cougars' head
coach Carl McGown. "They
played a fabulous match against
us. We fought tough, but they
deserved to win with the way
they were playing."
Firing on all six cylinders last
night, every Cardinal starter hit
above .300, with freshman Matt
Fuerbringer leading the way
with a game-high 34 kills
against only seven errors for a
.482 average.
Drawing upon that offensive
firepower, Stanford motored to a
8-4 advantage in the first game,
before stalling and eventually
falling behind 11-13. After a
quick timeout, the Cardinal
regained the momentum on a
Mike Lambert kill and an ace by
sophomore J.B. Taylor. Despite
that last-ditch effort, the
Cougars still managed to secure
its come-from-behind victory
with a smash by senior middle
blocker Ethan Watts.
After that minor setback, it
was all Stanford. The Cardinal
easily secured the second game
15-12, before breaking the
Cougars' spirit in the third
round.
Engaged in a tense tug-of-war
battle during game three, the
teams tied at two, four, five, six,
eight, 10 and 12 before BYU
