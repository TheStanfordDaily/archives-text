## Sorority volunteers at convalescent home 
### Mariam Maqsood Staff writer 
Looking to gain from the wis
dom and experience of old age,
members of the Alpha Kappa
Alpha sorority have initiated an
"Adopt a Grandparent" commu
nity service program in associa
tion with the Lytton Gardens Se
nior Home of Palo Alto.
According to AKA community
service chair Jamell E. Walker,
the project will bridge the genera
tion gap between students and el
ders. "There's so many lessons to
be learned. . . by not being in
volved with that generation, we're
missing a lot," she said.
Lytton Gardens Director of Ac
tivities Maureen Milligan said
that the average age of the elders
is 89. "It's just so wonderful for
the residents to have contact with
the young people," she said.
As part of the program, stu
dents will be paired up with senior
citizens in the home. Walker said
the program will consist of bi
monthly meetings with the adopt
ed grandparents, and activities

will include a movie night and
other cultural theme-based
events.
Aside from the organized bi
monthly events, students are en
couraged to meet with their adopt
ed grandparents on their own.
"Some of the elders need their
mail read to them, some people
have books that they want to read
but their eyesight is failing them,
and some people like to listen to
music and like somebody to sit and
enjoy it with them," Walker said.
Milligan said the residents
have a special affinity for young
people. "I think they touch some
thing deep inside the elders," she
said. "Younger people are not
threatening. . . they're not going
to make the residents do any
thing, take a pill, do therapy, but
they're just coming out of friend
ship and they have their hands
open."
The AKA sorority is an histori
cally African-American sorority
that was founded in 1908. Stan
