# Elderly care
## Sorority volunteers at convalescent home 
### Mariam Maqsood Staff writer 
Looking to gain from the wis
dom and experience of old age,
members of the Alpha Kappa
Alpha sorority have initiated an
"Adopt a Grandparent" commu
nity service program in associa
tion with the Lytton Gardens Se
nior Home of Palo Alto.
According to AKA community
service chair Jamell E. Walker,
the project will bridge the genera
tion gap between students and el
ders. "There's so many lessons to
be learned. . . by not being in
volved with that generation, we're
missing a lot," she said.
Lytton Gardens Director of Ac
tivities Maureen Milligan said
that the average age of the elders
is 89. "It's just so wonderful for
the residents to have contact with
the young people," she said.
As part of the program, stu
dents will be paired up with senior
citizens in the home. Walker said
the program will consist of bi
monthly meetings with the adopt
ed grandparents, and activities

will include a movie night and
other cultural theme-based
events.
Aside from the organized bi
monthly events, students are en
couraged to meet with their adopt
ed grandparents on their own.
"Some of the elders need their
mail read to them, some people
have books that they want to read
but their eyesight is failing them,
and some people like to listen to
music and like somebody to sit and
enjoy it with them," Walker said.
Milligan said the residents
have a special affinity for young
people. "I think they touch some
thing deep inside the elders," she
said. "Younger people are not
threatening. . . they're not going
to make the residents do any
thing, take a pill, do therapy, but
they're just coming out of friend
ship and they have their hands
open."
The AKA sorority is an histori
cally African-American sorority
that was founded in 1908. Stan
ford's chapter has 10 members,
said sophomore Panya Lei
Yarber, the sorority's vice-presi
dent and program chair. Yarber
added that the sorority has
"members of all races."
Walker explained that the orig
inal intent of the project was to
match up sorority sisters with
African-American elders in the
Lytton Gardens. "It was sort of
looking at it from an oral-history
perspective. . . to find out more
about ourselves through people
who had shared experiences," she
said.
However, after getting an
overwhelming student response
when the sorority put up flyers,
the program will now include var
ious ethnicities. "This will
enhance the program because it'll
give us the opportunity to learn
more about other people's cul

tures," Walker said.
Sorority sisters had an orien
tation meeting in January with
some of the Lytton Gardens resi
dents. Yarber said the senior citi
zens were happy to meet the stu
dents. "There was a definite
response to us," she said.
Walker recalled meeting one
man who expressed pride at the
fact that the women were Stan
ford students. " 'You just keep on
keeping on,' is what he said to
us," Walker said.
"It was empowering," she said.
"I know we all left there feeling
really good about ourselves and
we hoped that we had given other
people that same feeling."
Since that first orientation
meeting, the man Walker met has
died of a stroke, Milligan said.
"But the neat thing is that you
never know who you're going to
touch," she said.
According to Milligan, many
of the residents were enthusias
tic about the project when the

sorority held its orientation
meeting, but their enthusiasm
depends on their moods on any
given day.
"We're dealing with the fact
that the day we ask them about
the program they all feel good,
but then the day that we actually
have it, maybe someone's ill,
maybe it's beauty parlor day for
the ladies, or maybe they have
other friends or family coming to
visit," she said.
Walker said she first came up
with the idea for the sorority
because she missed her own
grandparents. "I don't get to
spend a lot of time with my
grandparents," she said. "I
always thought it would be neat
to adopt these elders as grandpar
ents — somebody you could just
call and maybe have dinner
with."
AKA's next scheduled orienta
tion at Lytton Gardens is today.
The bimonthly events will begin
in May, Walker said.
