# Early retirement plan announced
## Program will bring in younger talent, save University money 
### Colleen Krueger Staff writer 
In an effort to recruit younger
faculty and save much-needed
salary dollars, the University will
offer a one-time cash bonus to retir
ing faculty members between the
ages of 60 and 69 as part of its new
early retirement incentive plan.
The Faculty Retirement Incen
tive Program, which will be formal
ly announced by University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper at tomorrow's
Faculty Senate meeting, will be
available to all tenure-line profes
sors and Medical Center Line facul
ty after May 1.
But faculty members are divided
over whether the program will in

fuse energy into teaching and re
search or rob Stanford of the pre
cious contributions of senior faculty.
Although it has been called a "re
newal program" primarily designed
to revitalize the faculty, the plan
will save the University money by
replacing highly paid, tenured pro
fessors with young, starting-salary
assistant professors. Salary savings
will probably offset the cost of the
bonus payments in four to five
years.
In what Humanities and Sci
ences Dean John Shoven has called
"a grand opening sale," a single pay
ment of twice the faculty member's
final annual base salary will be
available for faculty over 60 with
15 years of Stanford service who
plan to retire between August 31,
1994 and August 31, 1995. Eligible
faculty must apply by Dec. 31.
After the expiration of this spe
cial offer, the program itself will
remain in place "for the foreseeable
future," said Kathy Gillam, associ
ate provost for faculty affairs.
Although the plan is scheduled
to be formally unveiled tomorrow, it
was already approved by the Board
of Trustees in April.
Faculty members with 15 years
service who announce their retire
ment a year in advance will be com
pensated at a sliding rate based on
age at date of retirement and base
salary in the final year of service. The
rates will be twice the salary for ages
60 to 65, 1.8 times the salary for age
66, 1.5 times the salary for age 67,
1.1 times the salary for age 68 and
0.6 times the salary for age 69.
About 200 faculty members are
currently eligible for the program,
Gillam said.
Although she admits there are

no mechanisms in place to prevent
a mass exodus of senior faculty,
Gillam added that Stanford did not
experience such a loss under its ear
lier early retirement incentive pro
gram, which had been in place for
more than 20 years until 1992.
"We just don't have a track
record of that kind of massive
departure," Gillam said.
But the University of California
system — and UC-Berkeley in par
ticular — experienced severe losses
when such a plan was implemented,
History Prof. Alexander Dallin said.
"In the case of Berkeley, it's real
ly had disastrous effects on the
quality of the faculty," Dallin said.
"They went way too far in offering
people monetary incentives to
retire, and that has had a catas
trophic effect on the quality of
teaching — although it saved them
a heap of money hire to younger
replacements at half the cost of
tenured faculty."
But Stanford's system differs
from UC-Berkeley's because it is an
"on-going program and not a series
of one-time offers," Gillam said.
The issue at Berkeley was not
teaching but research quality, as
high-paid researchers were targeted
with large bonuses, said Ron Reb

holz, chair of the English depart
ment.
"With notable exceptions,
younger teachers are better teach
ers," Rebholz said. "I would think
the quality of teaching would go up,
with more energy and new ideas in
the department."
The new program is the product
of over two years of work by the
Committee on Faculty Retirement
Plans, headed by Law Prof. Joseph
Bankman.
The committee was charged in
1992 with redesigning the Universi
ty's former program — which was
in effect from the mid-1970's to
1992 and provided incentives for
early retirement before requiring it
at age 70. As of Jan. 1 of this year,
federal legislation prohibits manda
tory retirement.
The current plan is both a reac
tion to this new legislation and a
chance to "give faculty members
and departments an effective plan
ning tool," Gillam said.
"Our program was out of date,
and we knew mandatory retire
ment was about to go," she said.
"This is not a crisis measure but an
ongoing tool, useful to individual
faculty for their own planning pur
poses."
