## Pub Board funds appropriated 
### Jim Luh Staff writer 
Working with a bare quorum,
the ASSU Senate took care of
some unfinished business last
night, voting to certify the results
of the spring election and confirm
the appointments of next year's
business project managers and as
sistant financial managers.
A bill to certify the results of
the spring election met with little
controversy, with only two of the
11 senators who voted opposing
certification.
Certification of the election in
dicates that the senate believes

the results are accurate. During
last week's meeting, the senate
had voted to validate the election,
agreeing that it had been conduct
ed in a fair and nonpartisan man
ner.
Undergraduate senator Peter
Cousins opposed the bill on the
grounds that no actions had been
taken against candidates whose
posters and flyers are still posted.
The ASSU Bylaws require that
"all candidates, slates, and spon
sors are responsible for removing
their campaign materials by 5
p.m. three days after the polls
