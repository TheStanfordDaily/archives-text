# Results of ASSU election will stand
## Pub Board funds appropriated 
### Jim Luh Staff writer 
Working with a bare quorum,
the ASSU Senate took care of
some unfinished business last
night, voting to certify the results
of the spring election and confirm
the appointments of next year's
business project managers and as
sistant financial managers.
A bill to certify the results of
the spring election met with little
controversy, with only two of the
11 senators who voted opposing
certification.
Certification of the election in
dicates that the senate believes

the results are accurate. During
last week's meeting, the senate
had voted to validate the election,
agreeing that it had been conduct
ed in a fair and nonpartisan man
ner.
Undergraduate senator Peter
Cousins opposed the bill on the
grounds that no actions had been
taken against candidates whose
posters and flyers are still posted.
The ASSU Bylaws require that
"all candidates, slates, and spon
sors are responsible for removing
their campaign materials by 5
p.m. three days after the polls
have closed."
Undergraduate senator Cecili
Sessions said she opposed certifi
cation "for the same reason I
voted against validation" —
because of the impact the loss of
special fees will have on campus
ethnic groups. Two major ethnic
groups — the Black Student
Union and MEChA, a
Chicano/Latino student group —
failed to garner enough votes to
receive funding.
The senate also resolved a tie
for the fifth graduate senator in
the district representing the
Schools of Engineering and Earth
Sciences. Donald Aingworth won
the seat by a coin toss, relegating
Sandeep Singhal to the sixth
ranked seat.
In business unrelated to the
election, the senate approved

the appointments of next year's
business project managers and
assistant financial managers.
The confirmation vote was
postponed indefinitely at last
week's meeting after protesta
tions from undergraduate sen
ator Eric Chen that senators
and Council of Presidents
members had not been involved
in the interviewing process, as
recommended by the ASSU
Bylaws. But after ASSU leaders
reviewed the applications over
the past week, the confirmation
bill was reintroduced last
night.
Graduate senator Nawwar
Kasrawi, who participated in the
second review process, admitted
that "there were a lot of problems
in the selection process, and they
started right from the begin
ning."
But ASSU Financial Manager
Brian Hillger assured the senate
that despite missteps in the selec
tion of the assistant financial

managers, "I do strongly feel that
these five people are the best peo
ple."
But Chen was still dissatisfied
with the review process, in light
of the fact that no undergraduate
senators had participated in the
review process.
"I don't think there was a sin
cere effort made to contact any
one," Chen said.
The senate also approved Pub
lications Board allocations for
spring quarter, setting aside
$4,781 to fund eight student pub
lications.
Over the objections of under
graduate senator Anietie
Ekanem, the senate voted to
postpone the allocations for the
Program Board and Community
Service Board until the next sen
ate meeting in two weeks. Sena
tors were unwilling to vote on
those allocations because copies
of the bill had not been circulat
ed in advance of last night's
meeting.
