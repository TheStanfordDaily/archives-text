# Application fees for international students rise
## 
### Kevin Wack Staff writer 
A University plan to raise the appli
cation fee for international students
has generated opposition from both
students and administrators.
Under the policy announced earlier
this month by Vice Provost and Dean of
Student Affairs Mary Edmonds, all
graduate and undergraduate interna
tional applicants would pay an addi
tional $10. Currently, international
prospective undergraduate students
pay $55 to apply to Stanford — $5 more
than American students. The addition

al fee covers air mail postage for appli
cation materials and their accompany
ing bulletin, "Stanford Today."
The extra money from the current
plan would be used primarily to avoid
cutting the budget for Bechtel Interna
tional Center and also would provide
funding for one-fifth of a new staff po
sition at the center.
International students make up 5
percent of the admitted 1994-95 fresh
man class.
I-Center Director John Pearson said
he opposes the proposal philosophical
ly. But he added that if a fee increase is
inevitable, the current proposal is

slightly more fair than those used by
some comparable institutions.
"When it was first brought up, my
sense and still my sense is [that it]
seems to be a bit unfair," Pearson said.
Pearson is currently studying the
application fees charged by other uni
versities comparable to Stanford.
"No Ivy League university charges a
discriminatory fee, except Columbia,"
he said. Columbia's fee is a $90 charge,
but only for those students who decide
to matriculate, Pearson said.
Pearson said he prefers the Stanford
plan because the burden would be
spread around among all applicants. But

he said it is up to the students to protest
the policy if they disagree with it.
"I'm trying to see what other stu
dents feel about it, " he said. "My sense
is . . students have got to empower
themselves." Pearson said he has en
couraged students who disagree with
the plan to write to administrators be
fore the University's 1994-95 budget
comes up for approval at the June
meeting of the Board of Trustees.
Nilay Banker, president of the Indi
an Students Association, said that he
plans to write to Provost Condoleezza
Rice to express his displeasure
with the proposal.
"My main concern was that
whatever the fee raise may be . . .
it may be too much for [interna
tional! students," Banker said.
But other international stu
dents, such as senior Adolfo
Chou, downplayed the signifi
cance of the increased fee. He
explained that since most interna
tional students pay full tuition
anyway, an extra $10 would be
unlikely to affect the applicant
pool.
