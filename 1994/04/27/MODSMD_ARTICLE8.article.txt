# Stanford surfers win March Internet Hunt
## 
### Nina Wasow 
Does searching for obscure
pieces of information through the
immensity of thousands of Inter
net databases sound like your idea
of a good time?
It does to a team of Stanford
students called "Sleepless at Stan
ford" who won the Internet Hunt
in March. The hunt is a list of ap
proximately 10 questions that is
put out each month by Rick Gates,
a librarian and computer re
searcher at the University of Ari
zona at Tucson. Teams and indi
viduals all over the world have
been competing since it began in
Sept. 1992.
Sleepless at Stanford's mem
bers include freshman Robert Au,
sophomores Christopher Gori and
Joanna Salgado, grad student
Jean-Pascal Crametz and Larry
Schwimmer, who has stopped out
but still competes from Ix)s Ange
les with the team.

Crametz started the team by
posting a notice about the hunt on
a newsgroup, and served as captain
before leaving for France. Before
seeing the message, none of the
team members had even heard of
the Internet Hunt.
March's contest was the first
time that Sleepless at Stanford
competed. They began by splitting
up the problems and searching for
answers individually, and then
working together on difficult ques
tions that had left the others
stumped, Salgado said.
It took the team a little more
than 24 hours to complete the con
test, and they submitted it about a
day after. "We were tying up loose
ends," said Salgado. Results were
posted a few weeks later.
Each question is assigned a
point value up to 10 based on its
difficulty, and partial credit is
awarded when the process by

which the answer was found is
shown. Sleepless at Stanford
received full points for all its
answers.
Salgado, who helps with cam
pus electronic mail accounts at
Sweet Hall, explained the steps she
took to answer the question "How
is beer made?"
"There are a lot of newsgroups
on beer," she said. "MIT has a com
puter that holds a lot of files of
F_A.Q.'s (Frequently Asked Ques
tions), so I searched for 'beer' and
found the answer." Salgado said
the process consisted of a lot of
roaming.
The team said they enjoyed the
hunt primarily because of its ele
ments of excitement and discovery.
"This sounds geeky, but I had just
started getting into computers
when I .got here in Sept. 1992 —
it's amazing to me that there was
so much out there. It's like, 'Wow,
I can't believe I found it!' You get a
rush," said Salgado.
Gori, an electrical engineering

major, said that "it gives you a
chance to demonstrate obscure,
random trivia that you can pick
up on the net. If you know where
to look, you can find anything you
want to know on the net."
Au said that he learned from the
experience. "The hunt taught me a
lot about using Internet. I hadn't
done a lot of intensive searching
before. I like the competitive
nature of it."
Au earned points for the team
by finding the other profession of
Wellington, New Zealand city
council member Sarah Lysaght.
"There is a directory of all the
gophers [information programs
accessible to any user] around
the world, in North America,
Europe, etc.," he said. "There
was only one for New Zealand,
and that was the city of Welling
ton. It had background informa
tion on all its city council mem
bers."
The hunt began as an imitation
of exams that Gates took in library
school, in which students were
given questions and given an hour
to find the answers.
The hunt's intent — explained
to participants in a file on the net
work -r- is to help novice Internet

users to understand how to move
around the system. It also gives
experienced users an opportunity
to realize the vast and varied
amounts of information and raw
material available.
Gates' idea was to avoid the
teaching of information resources
use through books and classroom
instruction, and to accomplish this
through constructive experimenta
tion and experience.
Gates personally verifies that
the answers to each question can
be found using only the net. One
extra credit question and one
"mystery" question — which
Gates could not answer with net
resources — is also included with
each contest.
Questions cover a wide range of
topics. For example, in March's
hunt Gori discovered how to order
roses over the Internet, and how
much it would cost, by searching
for an article about flowers on a
newsgroup. That led him to a
gopher server called "Internet
florist," which listed prices, avail
able arrangements, and where to e
mail the order.
Other questions from January's
hunt were: "Who is the current
Geek of the Week?" and "How

many grams of fat are contained in
100 grams of mature human
breast milk?"
Questions for each month are
usually posted on e-mail very late
at night on the last day of the pre
vious month. Players have one
week to submit answers, but com
plete responses are usually
turned in less than a day after
questions are posted. The first
person to correctly answer all the
questions or get the highest point
total wins.
Prizes include the excitement of
the chase, the glory of winning,
and a variety of goodies such as a
one-year subscription to "The
Internet Business Journal" — or
so the gopher file says. "We actual
ly never heard from the guy about
the prize," said Salgado.
April's hunt featured a difficult
sequential format, in which each
question could only be answered
using information from the previ
ous problem. The questions were
also in verse.
"We tried a few brute force
approaches, but we got stuck on
the sixth problem, so we probably
didn't win," said Gori. However,
the team does plan to keep compet
ing in the future.
