The Daily needs photo labbers.
What are labbers? They work one day a week for 2-3 hours in the afternoon developing our film.
No experience necessary. We'll train you.
We'll even pay you.
For more information, call Vincent or Rajiv at 5-2100
OR
COME TO AN INFORMATIONAL MEETING ON FRIDAY AT NOON AT THE DAILY.
(We're in the Storke Building, next to Terman.)
