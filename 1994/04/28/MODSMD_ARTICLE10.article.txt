## Alums author guide to country's 100 best internships 
### Karen E. Heywood Staff writer 
With five years at Stanford each and 10 intern
ships between them, Stanford alumni Mark Old
man and Samer Hamadeh decided to put their
cumulative learning to good use.
Two years of research and collaboration led to
the publishing of "America's Top 100 Intern
ships," currently the Princeton Review's best
seller in its 36-book series. The authors are on a
15-campus college tour, which comes to Stanford
today.
The pair — who graduated with co-terminal
degrees in 1992 — met freshman year in Branner
Hall and remained friends throughout college. In
their final quarter at Stanford, they "set out to
write the book we would have killed for while we
were at Stanford," said Oldman.
Their book, which arrived in bookstores in
February, describes and details nationwide
internships available to college students, from
The Surfrider Foundation — an environmental
activist group with a secondary emphasis on surf
ing — to Spike Lee's 40 Acres and a Mule Produc
tion Company, to governmental positions in
Washington, D.C.
Said Oldman, who himself held internships
at MTV and the U.S. Supreme Court, "While at
Stanford, [Samer and I] wanted great intern
ships — challenging work, prestige, decent
compensation, and a good quality of life.
Internships are a neglected body of career edu
cation; the [Career Planning and Placement

Center] is wonderful, but zeroing in on top
internships is hard — information is often
vague," he said.
Hamadeh's background in chemistry and
chemical engineering, complemented Oldman's
foundation in English. "We work well together;
he's very much a techie, and I'm the fuzzy ... we
each gravitated towards our interests [in compil
ing the book]," said Oldman.
The duo began their research at Stanford's
Career Planning and Placement Center, which
helped them find over 1,000 internships, and sur
veyed college students across the country.
"We compared each of the internships to their
respective vocational disciplines," said Oldman,
"and winnowed down our list to a few hundred
organizations."
From there they interviewed five to 10 repre
sentatives and interns from each organization,
and visited as many as possible. To get informa
tion on the CIA, for example, they were prohib
ited from interviewing over the phone, and had
to speak with a panel monitored by agents to
make sure nothing secret was divulged, Oldman
said.
In spite of having invested over two years into
the subject of internships, Hamadeh and Oldman
are still thriving in the internship business. Their
future plans include possible updated versions of
"America's Top 100 Internships" and an overseas
edition, Oldman said.
Hamedah and Oldman will be holding an
internship seminar at the Bookstore from 3:30 to
5:00 p.m. today.
