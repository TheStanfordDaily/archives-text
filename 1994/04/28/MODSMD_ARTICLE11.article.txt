Nixon at rest
YORBA LINDA, Calif. (AP)
Richard M. Nixon completed his
remarkable and contentious life's jour
ney yesterday, honored in death by five
other American presidents. President
Clinton said his achievements over
shadowed humiliation and added: "May
the day of judging President Nixon on
anything but his entire life come to a
close."
Twenty years after he resigned the
presidency in disgrace, Nixon was bid
den farewell by 2,800 mourners who
gathered under leaden skies at an out
door funeral 100 feet from the home
where he was born 81 years ago.
Henry Kissinger, Nixon's secretary of
state, turned to the casket and saluted
his former boss with a nod of the head
before delivering an emotional eulogy.
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole broke
into tears after praising Nixon as "the
most durable public figure of our time."
One last time, Nixon was saluted by
"Hail to the Chief," the trumpet herald
that announced him so often during his
troubled presidency.

Clinton delivered the final tribute.
"Oh yes, he knew great controversy
amid defeat as well as victory," Clinton
said, standing beside Nixon's flag
draped casket. "He made mistakes and
they, like his accomplishments, are part
of his life and record."
Boren to retire
WASHINGTON (AP) - David
Boren's decision to leave the Senate
transforms the Oklahoma Democrat's
safe seat into a toss-up and will make it
harder for his party to retain control of a
chamber they have dominated since
1987.
The 53-year-old Boren, a 16-year
Senate veteran, announced yesterday
that he will resign after this year's ses
sion to head the University of Okla
homa. He became the sixth Senate
Democrat to say he will step down,
including Majority Leader George
Mitchell of Maine, who stunned his col
leagues last month when he said he
would not seek re-election.
Democrats now control the Senate by
a 56-44 margin.
