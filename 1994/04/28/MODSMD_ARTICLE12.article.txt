JOHANNESBURG, South Africa
(AP) — Police said they crushed a right
wing bombing spree yesterday, but
South Africa's historic election came
under threat of collapse from mile-long
lines of voters and a shortage of ballots.
Police announced they had arrested
31 white extremists suspected of being
behind a bombing spree that has killed
21 in recent days. The latest bomb
exploded yesterday at Johannesburg's
Jan Smuts airport, injuring 18.
But nothing could stop the great tide
of voters on the second day of the three
day elections, nor the euphoria felt by
many blacks as they cast the first ballots
of their lives. On Tuesday, handicapped,
elderly and ex-patriate voters had their
turn.
Responding to the floods of voters,
the government began printing millions
of new ballots, saying it would have 5
million more ready by this morning. The
army said it would help print and trans
port ballots, which never arrived at some
stations. And the government was dis
cussing extending the vote by a day.
At 7 a.m., African National Congress
leader Nelson Mandela, 75, was able to
cast the first ballot of his life, declaring it

"the beginning of a new era" after drop
ping his ballot into a simple brown box in
Durban.
"We have moved from an era of pes
simism, division, and limited opportuni
ties. We are starting a new era of hope, of
reconciliation, of nation-building,"
declared the likely leader of his country
by next week.
Fifteen minutes after Mandela's vote
was broadcast live nationwide, a bomb
detonated inside a sedan parked outside
the international terminal at Johannes
burg's Jan Smuts Airport. Eighteen peo
ple were wounded.
By-now-familiar scenes of panic,
twisted metal, broken glass and bloodied
pavement repeated themselves. But this
time police were quick to announce they
had apprehended a suspect, a tall white
man wearing the khaki clothing favored
by the white right-wingers believed
behind a spate of bombs exploded this
week in an attempt to derail the election.
The bigger threat yesterday came
from the sheer numbers of voters.
Some sites ran out of invisible ink
applied to voters' hands so that they
could not vote twice. The ink is read with
an ultraviolet lamp. Other polling spots

lacked either lamps or electricity to run
them.
Some ballots never arrived. In the vio
lence-wracked East Rand near Johan
nesburg, a truck carrying ballots to vot
ing stations in Katlehong was hijacked
— not an unusual event in those parts.
With lines stretching more than a
mile in places and political parties get
ting angrier, the Independent Electoral
Commission agreed late last night to
postpone poll closings from 7 p.m. to
midnight. Today was declared a holiday
so that more people could miss work and
stand in line.
The commission pledged that polling
stations would remain open as long as
needed to accommodate everyone in line
at 7 p.m. today.
Election officials admitted that there
might simply be more South African vot
ers out there than they had estimated
based on previous censuses.
Inkatha Freedom Party leader Man
gosuthu Buthelezi threatened to pull his
party out unless officials agreed to
extend the three-day balloting. One of
the main hangups that emerged yester
day was that polling places lacked the
stickers used to add Inkatha to the ballot.
