Residential system does
not create connection to
the Stanford community
JUST IMAGINE the following
scene. After a five to 10-year
absence after graduation, you
have returned to visit the Farm in
order to reminisce about the good
times you had as an undergradu
ate. As you drop the coins into the
parking meter by the Oval, you
wonder where on campus you
should go.
Of course, you could always wan
der around the Quad like a camera
happy tourist and stare again at the
glimmering facade of Memorial
Church. If you feel a little more dar
ing, you could walk to your old aca
demic department and see if your
former professors are still teaching
or have retired.
But your tour of the Quad and
visit to your former department do
not revive the sense of belonging to
the place where you spent four years
of your life. But where else can you
go? Your frosh dorm? Kresge Audito
rium, where you vividly remember
acing the Econ 1 final? Cowell Stu
dent Health Center, where you recall
sitting aimlessly for hours on end?
This feeling could be attributed to
the residential system's failure to
create a sense of class unity or insti
tutional belonging among its stu
dents. Students typically feel a much
stronger sense of belonging to frater
nities, sororities, athletic teams, eth
nic centers and other student
groups.
Stanford's size and diversity
make it difficult to create a sense of
class unity or particular attachment
to the institution. But other compa
rable institutions, like Yale and
Dartmouth, have tried. And judging
from their alumni satisfaction rat
ings and contribution statistics, they
may have succeeded.
According to a U.S. News and
World Report survey, Dartmouth
ranked first in percentage of alumni

who gave to 1991 and 1992 fund
drives (54 percent), Yale ranked
sixth (42 percent), and Stanford
ranked a disappointing 77th (18 per
cent).
At Yale, every freshman .is
assigned to one of 12 "residential
colleges," a fancy name for a large
dormitory. However, most frosh do
not live in their residential college
until their sophomore year. Most
Yale frosh live in close proximity to
the frosh from their college within a
large quadrangle of buildings which
also houses their classmates from all
the other colleges.
While there are some problems
with Yale's residential system, there
is little doubt that it creates a more
permanent residential community
than Stanford's. Their system cre
ates a small college within a large
university, not to mention a place
that serves as every student's per
manent campus home.
At Dartmouth, which has about
1,000 students per class and oper
ates on the quarter system, all
sophomores are required to spend
the summer after their sophomore
year taking classes on campus. They
are required to stop out during one
quarter of the normal academic year.
By all accounts, Dartmouth's
sophomore summer is immensely
popular among its students. It is a
time of class bonding Dartmouth
undergraduates look forward to and
alumni remember.
The argument here is not that
Stanford should, or even could, copy
either the Yale or Dartmouth model.
But Stanford's rivals on the East
Coast provide some good guidance
for where it can start.
Stanford has also hired an expert,
Jerold Pearson, to determine why
alumni give in relatively low num
bers and to look at ways it can
improve its level of donations. It is
important that Stanford make fun
damental changes in the way the
University promotes unity and
should take the recommendations
offered by the expert seriously.
Only then will we feel we have
more to come back to than parking
tickets and academic buildings.
