## On giving and taking life 
### 
NICHOLS!" My editor bellowed at
the top of his lungs, his face crin
kled into a prune-like texture and
mouth clamped tightly around a short,
smoldering stogie.
"Nice! Nice!" He exclaimed, fist bran
dishing a copy of my last article. "Your
articles are nice! People don't want nice,
they want controversy, and I don't want to
see you again until you get some."
I looked up in dismay. He grunted.
"And don't forget to slam the door on
your way out!"
OK, think controversial.
Capitalpunishmentabortions. Now
that sounds like a winner.
Pro-choice, anti-death penalty. Pro-life,
pro-capital punishment. The right to
choose and the right of the other, the sanc
tity of life and the taking of another's life.
It's strange that these issues have become
so polarized. Isn't it inconsistent to believe
that it's appropriate to take life in one
case, yet inexcusable in another?
What is the link between capital pun
ishment and abortion? And why do people
always separate the two when they deal
with the same issue: potential and life?
Debates on abortion often center
around the question of when "life" begins.
If a living being is one that can survive
outside the womb, then abortions before
the end of the second trimester do not take
lives. But for this argument let's not talk
about life, let's talk about potential.
Capital punishment is an outright

denial of the human capacity to change,
the antithesis of rehabilitation. But if
everyone has potential for rehabilitation
or a "good life," then why kill them?
A common argument for abortion
rights is that unwanted children would
likely be born into unfavorable circum
stances. Usually the proposed solution is
putting the child up for adoption and
letting it live in a snug and cozy Chris
tian household. Extreme pro-lifers por
tray it as an issue of denying a beautiful
Beaver Cleaver life to a child, while the
extreme pro-choicers paint a picture of
saving another crack baby from a short
and painful life of inner-city crime and
poverty.
Once again the question of potential
arises. Pro-capital punishment argu
ments say the convicted murderer has no
"right" to life since he has taken the life
of another — already demonstrating that
he cannot function effectively within
society. Has he been given the same
warm and loving '50s household that the
adopted child is supposed to receive? Is he
even the same man after a decade on
death row? Unlikely.
The connection, then, between capital
punishment and abortion appears to be
quality of life. Should our judgment of
this be governed by absolutes and laws
instead of by reason, circumstance and
understanding? Can we even judge this
for others?
No one wants to have an abortion, just

as no one wants to judge someone who has
committed premeditated murder. No one
even likes to think about these things.
People don't want to wonder if there's eth
ical inconsistency in being pro-choice and
anti-capital punishment or pro-life and a
death penalty supporter. But not thinking
is what has brought us into this quandary
in the first place.
What society desires is the perfect pre
ventative medicine: money for schools,
public outreach, crime prevention, family
planning, sex education and pre-pregnan
cy birth control. But if we ain't find this
medicine, or aren't willing to spend now to
save later, is the woman who needs an
abortion the one at fault? Is it the criminal
who has wronged, or is it simply society
that has failed? Should we be more con
cerned for the people who are here now or
for those not here yet?
If we cannot rehabilitate, if we cannot
provide for the young, then perhaps these
issues are dilemmas as real for us as they
are for those facing them directly. Perhaps
we should stop pointing fingers and start
wondering what role we play in these
problems.

More than anything else, Mike wonders
why we kill people to tell people that
killing people is wrong.
