## Transfer student gives comparative perspective on 'NP' 
### 
I AM WRITING to express my dismay
at the recent proposals to overhaul
the grading system at Stanford, and
to give the "revisionists" an expert
opinion on the issue: mine.
As a transfer student here, I spent
most of my academic career at a school
in which the grading system (I shudder
to think) was very similar to that now
being advanced to measure perfor
mance at Stanford. I had to decide what
classes I wanted (and perhaps more
importantly, didn't want) in the first
few weeks of the quarter.
My peers and I were faced with the
very real prospect of receiving one of
those indelible and nasty little symbols
on our transcripts like asterisks next
to retaken courses, F's, "W" 'sand
"NP" 's.
In short: been there, done that. Dear
students, faculty and staff, before arriv
ing at a decision on this issue, lend your
ear to a few of us who have lived in
both systems, and can make a real and
effective comparison.
Upon my arrival at Stanford, I was
astounded by the flexibility and free
dom of the grading system. This was
refreshing and inspiring, not because of
a new-found capability to bail out,
wimp out, flake out or burn out with no
consequences (as the whip-crackers of
late have characterized the present sys
tem), but because of what it said about
the fundamental relationship between

the student and the school.
It seemed to convey the idea that
the students were ultimately responsi
ble for their education. It said, "Per
form and you will be rewarded. Don't
perform and you will not be reward
ed." Contrast this with the newly pro
posed voice: "Perform and you will be
rewarded. Don't perform and you will
be punished."
Stanford's system seemed to be evi
dence of a realization that students
don't need Daddy College to teach them
about failure. It conveyed an under
standing that what we need is a flexi
ble, relaxed and friendly atmosphere to
learn and that positive incentives were
more effective than negative ones â€”
that fear of failure or a "W" was not a
good motivation for staying in a class or
for studying.
I've heard it said, "If you're going to
give A's, you should give F's." Why? Is
the symmetry of this quaint duality
somehow compelling? Do these people
mean that excellence should be reward
ed and failure or even ambivalence
punished? Is this what learning is
about?
The fact is, you can reward the wor
thy, and simply not reward the unwor
thy. This is different from punish
ment, and it's very simple and fair.
Beyond that, I've heard it said by the
disciplinarians and proponents of grad
ing-system reform that students need

to be "responsible for their actions,"
and "be shown that in life, actions
have consequences."
However impressive this penetrating
insight may be, these people must real
ize that Stanford is already a collection
of people who've worked hard, who've
achieved, and who understand the
value of learning, or they simply
wouldn't be here. I dare say we've
already mastered the subtle and esoter
ic concept of cause and effect.
Also at issue here is the ability of
the present system to accommodate
class experimentation (I realize this
issue receives a great deal of attention
already, so I'll be brief). This feature
should not be underestimated.
At my previous institution, carefree
toe-dipping into the waters of other
subjects was not considered particular
ly wise. After all, why risk a "W" over
a basket-weaving course you changed
your mind about in the middle of the
quarter, when someone reading your
transcript (read: dossier) would per
ceive that as a sign of irresponsibility?
Here people can seek out classes
wholly different from their major
interest and thus familiarize them
selves with another element of the
world, people, art, literature, you
name it.
Besides that, and perhaps even
more importantly, the present system
allows people to take risks with class

es. It means you can take very chal
lenging courses without worrying
about slitting your throat.
Students can be bold and take on
personal challenges, pushing them
selves as far as they'd like, without the
daunting prospects of failing or not
being able to get out of the class with
out repercussions.
Building in disincentives to experi
mentation is contrary to the funda
mental ideals Stanford prides itself on
and clings so tightly to: those of provid
ing a broad and liberal education to its
students.
What is ultimately at stake here is
not just adding new arrows to the quiv
ers of professors, or new symbols to the
parlance of performance, but the under
lying relationship between students and
faculty, and students and the adminis
trative structure.
It supplants the principles of mutu
al respect and consideration with a
system that requires the student to
"do or else." Instituting the proposed
changes in the grading system would
mean kissing certain class experimen
tation good-bye, risk-taking and per
sonal challenges would be out the win
dow, and the open and liberal atmo
sphere that has characterized and dis
tinguished Stanford so far would be
snuffed out.
