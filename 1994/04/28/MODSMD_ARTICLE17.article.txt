# Accountability can be achieved with detailed transcripts, return of C
## 
### 
With great interest I read The
Daily's article on a plan by faculty to
bring back the F grade. One purpose in
doing so, they say, is to restore integri
ty to our transcripts.

Why not start with the obvious?
Scrap the scribble on transcripts that
masquerades as course titles and
replace it with full English words that
actually have meaning. If you can't use
it in Scrabble, it doesn't belong on the
transcript.
While we're at it, let's include the
names of instructors, especially the
handsomely-paid, turbo-powered
research deities who grace our lecture
halls every MWF or TTh. That should

jack up the prestige level and provide
some accountability. Besides, a B+
from Satan is not equivalent to the
same grade from a visiting professor
who just doesn't want to be bothered.
If the grade was assigned by a teaching
assistant, hapless or otherwise, that
should be noted, too.
Moreover, why bring back the F in
all its glory when a fine grade, the C,
doesn't get enough use as it is? Gradu
ate admissions officers must have fig

ured out by now that an A- here is
worth at least a B anywhere else, but
what if someone clues in the corporate
recruiters? And if U.S. News and
World Report gets wind of rampant
grade inflation at Stanford?
Once our academic ranking bites
the dust, maybe we'll finally find the
nerve to come out of the closet and
become a bona fide football school.
