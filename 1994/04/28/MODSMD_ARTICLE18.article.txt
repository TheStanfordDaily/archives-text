## Standout men to make final home showing 
### Mike Langford Senior staff writer 
Today is probably your last chance to see one of
the greatest tennis classes ever to attend Stan
ford.
In the men's tennis team's final weekend of
Pacific 10 Conference play, the Cardinal will
make its last Stanford Tennis Stadium appear
ance today starting at 1:30 p.m. against Washing
ton. The regular season finale will take place in
Berkeley tomorrow as Stanford travels to 0 Cali
fornia.
"These will be good matches for us," Gould
said. "We barely beat Cal when they were here,
and Washington is a pretty good team. And it will
be the last home match for our seniors."
For Stanford fans, today's match will be the
final opportunity to witness what is arguably the
best class of tennis players ever on the Farm.
Seniors Michael Flanagan, Robert Devens, Chris
Cocotos and Vimal Patel will take to the courts for
the last time as members of the Cardinal squad.
But the Stanford seniors have no intention of
letting Washington roll over them. The Huskies
did very well at the Pac-10 Indoors tournament in
mid-January, and recently beat Cal in Seattle.
"Our main job is to get through the weekend
without injury," said head coach Dick Gould. "But
we have to win those matches. It's vital if we are
to maintain our position for nationals. We'll have
our work cut out for us."
Stanford's last dual meet will likely be no easi
er when the Cardinal travels across the Bay to
face the rival Bears.
Stanford narrowly beat Cal 4-3 when the two
schools met here two months ago. Playing with
out an injured Flanagan, Stanford only won three
of six singles matches — Jeff Salzenstein at first
singles, Jim Thomas at fifth and Ricky Becker at
sixth. Stanford managed to come out on top at
first and second doubles, however, to ensure the
victory.
This time Cal will be facing a healthy Cardinal
squad, and one that is getting ready for the NCAA
Championships. Gould's main concern is to fine
tune the team in these two dual matches, and

keep everyone injury-free.
"Health is our main concern,"
Gould said. "After these two match
es, we'll take a couple of days off,
and then start gearing up for
nationals."
Stanford (20-2) held on to its
No. 2 spot when the new
Rolex/ITA rankings came out on
April 18. USC remained the top
ranked squad in the nation. How
ever, since only eight teams are
invited to the NCAA team champi
onship tournament, this week
end's Pac-10 dual play takes on
added importance. Of special inter
est will be a match between UCIJ\
and Pepperdine, which will most
likely determine the last invitee to
the tournament.
Flanagan fell to No. 6 in the
national singles rankings with a
23-11 overall record. The biggest
jump was made by Salzenstein,
who catapulted to a No. 38 ranking
with a 19-3 dual match record,
almost entirely at second singles,
and a 28-8 overall record. Devens
is ranked No. 51 with a 14-6 record
in dual matches and 18-11 overall.
And Thomas is ranked No. 52 with
an incredible 20-0 dual match
record, and a 26-3 overall record.
In doubles, Flanagan and Coco
tos comprise the No. 9-ranked
team, and Salzenstein-Patel is
ranked No. 28.
