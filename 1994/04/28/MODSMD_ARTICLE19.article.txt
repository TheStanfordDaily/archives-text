# Baseball suffers Bronco stomping

The "pin cushion" sticks one
back.
Lou Donati, Santa Clara senior
second baseman and college base
ball's all-time hit-by-pitch leader,
roped an eighth-inning double
past Stanford junior leftfielder
Steve Carver yesterday and
scored the winning run to lift the
Broncos over the No. 7 Cardinal
5-4 at Sunken Diamond.
Donati, who received his 18th
beaning of the season and 56th in
four years when plunked in the
elbow by losing starter Matt
Marenghi (2-3) in the first inning,
timed his only hit of the day per
fectly. Santa Clara (31-14) had
allowed Stanford to cut a 4-0 lead
in half in the seventh, and the
Broncos surrendered two more
runs in the eighth before closing
the door on Stanford (30-17).
"It's just a reaction. I didn't
learn it and no one taught me,"
Donati said of his ability to "take
one for the team."
The description could just as
easily have described Donati's
shot off Cardinal freshman reliev
er Tom Reimers to lead off the
eighth. Not hit particularly hard,
the line drive caught Carver run
ning in on the ball before it sailed
over his head. Bronco freshman
rightfielder Michael Frank then
advanced Donati on a ground ball
to second base, and sophomore
catcher Karl Thompson sent a fly
ball to center deep enough to
allow Donati to score.
"I was just looking to hit a fly
ball to the outfield," Thompson
said. "I knew when I got an off
speed curveball that I couldn't hit
it out of the park."
Down 5-2 with a four-game
winning streak in jeopardy, Stan

ford battled back in the bottom of
the inning. Junior first baseman
Dusty Allen played the role of
Donati, leading off the frame by
taking a Miles Kelly pitch off the
foot. Kelly, a junior reliever for
Santa Clara, then walked Carver
and saw Cardinal sophomore
rightfielder Brodie Van Wagenen
move the runners over an a slow
roller to second base.
Freshman shortstop Eric Sees
picked up an RBI on a groundout,
and sophomore centerfielder Cale
Carter followed with a line-drive
single to right-center to extend
his hitting streak to nine games
and bring Stanford to within one
run.
But Kelly recovered, inducing
sophomore third baseman Brian
Dallimore to fly out to left field to
end the Cardinal threat. Senior
Ken Lorge then came on to pitch
a perfect ninth and pick up his
fifth save, preserving the win for
Bronco freshman starter Jeff
Perry (2-0).
"This was a big win for us
because it gives us bragging
rights," said Santa Clara head
coach John Oldham, whose team
split four games with Stanford
this year. "In years past, if there
was a series of three or more
games, they would usually win."
Despite past performance
against its local rival, Oldham's
squad struck first and carried
momentum the rest of the way
through yesterday's contest.
Marenghi and Perry enjoyed
smooth sailing in a fast-paced
pitchers duel through three
innings, but a two-out single by
Bronco junior first baseman Scott
Gunther plated Donati and Frank
for the game's first two runs in
the top of the fourth.
