# Sharp increase in student borrowing
## 
### Rosalind Wang Staff writer 
Borrowing levels for Stanford stu
dents have increased greatly during the
first half of this school year because of a
relaxation in federal lending laws.
The increase reflects a nationwide rise
in student borrowing which stems main
ly from changes made to the Higher Edu
cation Act in 1992. The changes — which
took effect this year — include the estab
lishment of a higher limit on the amount
students can borrow, the exclusion of the

value of a student's house when assess
ing financial need and the creation of
Stafford Unsubsidized Loans for higher
income families.
Dana Callihan, spokesperson for Cali
fornia Student Aid Commission, report
ed a 47.6 percent overall increase in fed
eral student loans at this point in the aca
demic year.
"Last year, during the first eight
months, student borrowing came to
about $940 million This year, within the
same time period, it came to about $1.4
billion. So it is about $450 million higher

this year," he said.
Though final figures were not avail
able, he noted that Stanford
students have thus far borrowed about
$2.5 million more than last year.
According to University statistics,
Stanford students and their parents took
out 1,918 commission-guaranteed loans
for about $8 million in the first half of fis
cal year 1993-94. That exceeds the total
of 1,814 loans for $5.5 million for the last
fiscal year, and 1,611 loans for $5 million
