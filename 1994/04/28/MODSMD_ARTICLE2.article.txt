# Sharp increase in student borrowing
## 
### Rosalind Wang Staff writer 
Borrowing levels for Stanford stu
dents have increased greatly during the
first half of this school year because of a
relaxation in federal lending laws.
The increase reflects a nationwide rise
in student borrowing which stems main
ly from changes made to the Higher Edu
cation Act in 1992. The changes — which
took effect this year — include the estab
lishment of a higher limit on the amount
students can borrow, the exclusion of the

value of a student's house when assess
ing financial need and the creation of
Stafford Unsubsidized Loans for higher
income families.
Dana Callihan, spokesperson for Cali
fornia Student Aid Commission, report
ed a 47.6 percent overall increase in fed
eral student loans at this point in the aca
demic year.
"Last year, during the first eight
months, student borrowing came to
about $940 million This year, within the
same time period, it came to about $1.4
billion. So it is about $450 million higher

this year," he said.
Though final figures were not avail
able, he noted that Stanford
students have thus far borrowed about
$2.5 million more than last year.
According to University statistics,
Stanford students and their parents took
out 1,918 commission-guaranteed loans
for about $8 million in the first half of fis
cal year 1993-94. That exceeds the total
of 1,814 loans for $5.5 million for the last
fiscal year, and 1,611 loans for $5 million
in 1991-92. Commission-guaran
teed loans make up approximately
85 percent of all student borrowing
at Stanford.
Cynthia Rife, the University's
assistant director of Financial Aids,
said the new unsubsidized loans
are one of the main causes of
increased borrowing among Stan
ford students.
These loans require payment
of the interest accumulated on the
debt once the student is out of col
lege. The amount the student can
borrow is "the cost of the school
less the amount of financial aid,"

Rife said. Middle-class families
who would not have qualified for
a subsidized loan — on which the
government pays the interest —
now have access to a different
means of funding the education.
"The change in eligibility is a big
change," Rife said. "Any student
can borrow as long as they are in
good standing."
Though the Financial Aids
office "can't not process a loan,"
Rife said the office has been careful
to advise students against running
up debts they won't be able to pay
back. "We try to talk to people
about the loans," she said. "We
make sure they go through loan
counseling."
The loans have helped some
families for the time being, but
they have also increased anxieties

for a few students who will have to
pay off the debt once they enter the
job market.
Freshman Daniel Luker, an
unsubsidized loan recipient who
would not have qualified for a loan
otherwise, said the debt "will defi
nitely affect" his choice of major.
"I need to get a good job so I can
pay off the loan," he said. "I'm
more worried about the burden on
my parents than on myself."
Other students were less appre
hensive. "My parents basically told
me to do what I wanted in college,"
said freshman Scott Gerber. "If I
get into trouble later they said they
would help me out."
Gerber dismissed worries about
getting a career to pay back his
subsidized loan. "It's four years
away."
