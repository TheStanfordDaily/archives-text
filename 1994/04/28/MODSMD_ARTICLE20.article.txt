## Golf swings to 4th in Pac-10 
### Seth Goldstein Staff writer 
Cold and rainy weather prevailed throughout the
first two rounds of the three-day Pacific 10 Confer
ence Women's Golf Championship in Bel Air, Calif,
at the Brentwood Country Club. The difficult con
ditions not only disrupted action on the greens, but
also affected third-ranked Stanford's play.
The Cardinal finished fourth with a total of 935
strokes, 15 shots off the pace of No. 1 Arizona State.
The Sun Devils captured their second straight Pac
-10 title with a strong overall performance while No.

5 USC and No. 4 UCLA finished second and third,
respectively.
The golfers played Monday's first round in what
Stanford head coach Tim Baldwin called "condi
tions just short of warranting cancellation." The
wet weather only gave UCLA a more pronounced
home-course advantage, as the Bruins shot their
way into first with a round of 308. The Cardinal was
only five strokes behind at this point, but the rain
did concern Baldwin.
"Unless you have experience playing in such
weather, you're going to have trou
ble," he said. "Mhairi McKay was
at home in the cold, having played
extensively in Scotland, but
Andrea Baxter literally froze out
there and it affected her game."
The versatile McKay displayed
her ability to withstand the ele
ments, logging a first-round score
of 74, good for second place.
"It was sort of like home," said
the freshman. "Not that I like play
ing in weather like that, but I can."
Meanwhile, fellow freshman
Baxter and junior Jamille Jose had
a tough time. "It's hard to hit a golf
ball when you're shivering," Bax
ter said. "Some of my shots were
altered by the way my lx>dy was
reacting to the cold."
The rest of the team, senior
Melinda Daniels and junior Amy
Ijawrence, played well enough to
keep the team in the top half of the
competitors and within striking
distance.
However, Tuesday's second
round did not live up to the coach's
expectations. Play was halted
Tuesday afternoon due to the rain
and the teams were forced to come
out early Wednesday morning to
finish. The Cardinal did not react
well to the hiatus.
"We really stubbed our foot this
time," Baldwin said.
Stanford shot 321 strokes, drop

ping 19 behind eventual champion
ASU and 23 strokes behind USC,
which used a low-round score of
299 to slide into the lead.
The squad rebounded Wednes
day afternoon when the weather
cleared. With the help of
Lawrence's individual low of 72
strokes, Stanford fired a round of
301, the low for any team. But it
was another case of too little, too
late. The Cardinal was unable to
overcome the insurmountable
deficit and only maintained its
fourth place standing.
"We're disappointed in our fin
ish, but now we have the knowl
edge that the Sun Devils can be
beaten," said Baldwin.
Although, the team placed lower
than it had expected, the gaps
between the four top squads were
relatively narrow. The 15-stroke
difference between Stanford and
ASU was the smallest of the sea
son. In addition, the Sun Devils'
four-stroke margin of victory over
USC was its closest win of the year.
Individually, USC's Jennifer
Biehn broke a three-way tie with
Lita Lindley of Arizona and ASU's
Wendy Ward, the number one col
lege player in the nation, on the
second hole of sudden death to
become the 1994 Pac-10 champion.
Stanford's McKay finished three
strokes behind the leaders in fifth
place. Lawrence, boosted by her
excellent final round, came in tied
for sixth. Jose, Daniels and Baxter
finished 21st, 22nd and 27th
among the 44-player field.
