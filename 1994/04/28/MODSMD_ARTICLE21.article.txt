# Observations in the weight room
## 
### 
I have found the perfect place
for people-watching. Long one
of my very favorite activities,
you can plop me on a park bench,
amid the fans at a ballpark or
even in Tresidder and I'm happy
just gazing and observing.
While malls, restaurants, con
certs and ballgames rank among
my top viewing areas, one place
reigns above them all — the
weight room. For almost two
years now I have been a Roble
regular, pedaling across campus
to spend a good 45 minutes repet
itively lifting blocks of metal
clearly not meant to be suspended
in air.
Why, you may ask? Of course
there's the muscle building/
health aspect. Looking buff is
cool, feeling strong is cool, being
able to lift your bike over a rack is
not only cool but crucial if you
want to keep it for any length of
time.
Beyond the fitness benefits,
however, the gym is an enclosed
space which attracts a wide range
of Stanfordites. After finishing a
set and waiting for my muscles to
stop quivering, I have plenty of

time to observe this diverse
group. Men and women, students
and staff, gathered together with
the sole common pursuit of a
higher level of musculature.

Forgive me for stereotyping,
but after many hours of observa
tion, I have come up with certain
categories which Roble-goers
seem to fall into.
First, there are the "intense
lifters," the hard core, usually
incredibly buff folks who
approach their sessions with
utmost seriousness, almost as a
religious ritual. These people can
usually be identified by their lift
ing gloves, weight belts and looks
of intense scrutiny in front of the

mirrors as they carefully check
proper form and alignment.
I have dubbed the second
group the "devotees." While they
may not have the well developed
biceps or bulging veins of the
power lifting bunch, these are the
ones who you're guaranteed to
spot virtually every time you go
in. Faithfully sitting-up, pulling
up or pedaling away on the life
cycles, they take their workouts
seriously but also as a time to
blow-off some steam and stress,
often listening to Walkmans, or
reading a newspaper when not
lifting.
While I hesitate to call the next
category "social" lifters, as they
are usually just as motivated as
anyone else, they usually work
out with a partner or start up a
conversation with whoever is on
the machine next to them.
Other than the rapport
between lifting buddies, the
weight room is usually very quiet,
even during the busiest times.
Actually, this silence is quite
understandable, considering that

most people are busy counting
their reps or expending every
breath hefting those 50-
pounders.
Muffled only by the whirling of
the fan, the conversations that do
take place are often overheard by
everyone not plugged into head
phones. Topics range anywhere
from proper lifting techniques to
last night's Sharks game. You
might also hear people encourag
ing their partners as they struggle
to finish that last rep with "come
on, only one more," or from the
little less sympathetic, "hey you
weenie, my grandma could lift
this with one hand,"
All in all, the general atmo

sphere in the weight room is
polite as fellow lifters respect each
other's effort and space. Most
people are careful to make sure
that whoever was using the
machine or weights is finished
before they hop on.
Although it's a place where
people push their bodies to their
physical limits, the weight room
also has a strangely calming
effect. Maybe it's the unspoken
camaraderie, shared between peo
ple with a similar dedication to
getting, or staying in shape. For
me, it's a place where the only
expectations placed on me are my
own — as are my accomplish
ments.

Sarah categorizes herself as a
devotee and would like to thank
the Roble faithful for being the
unknowing subjects of her study.
