cluded its season last weekend
after capturing second place

last Friday, defeating Santa
Barbara 28-8 in the first
round.
Stanford continued its
streak on Saturday, downing
Cal Poly by an overwhelming
22-3 score to advance to the
finals.
Stanford couldn't keep up
the winning streak, however,
as it fell to California 59-17 in
Sunday's battle for the Pacific

Coast title.
"We exceeded expectations
on the first two days, but by
Sunday we were physically
worn out and were playing
against a very strong Cal
squad," said junior Jeff Fre
und.
The Cardinal had to face its
competition without the
instruction of a coach as
Frank Boivert was in Scot
land coaching the women's
U.S. National Team. Senior
captain Joe Croft took over
the leadership role at the 8-
man position while classmate
Eric Fleckten also boosted the
team as fly-half.
