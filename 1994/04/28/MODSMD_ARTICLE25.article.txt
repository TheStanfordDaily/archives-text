Lodger is on his way home
Abdelghani Attou is finally headed back to his
native Algeria, according to U.S. Border Patrol
officials.
Stanford's unwanted houseguest was unable to
pay his own way back to Algeria and was formally
deported Saturday, a senior Border Patrol official
said.
Attou pled guilty to charges of "defrauding an
innkeeper" in March for staying 12 nights in
Branner Hall and Governor's Corner. He was
sentenced to three years of probation April 6 in a
Palo Alto Municipal Court and has until June 2 to
pay the $624 he owes the University.
France was Attou's preferred destination, but
the French embassy denied him an entrance visa,
the official said.
Because he was forcibly deported, Attou will be
unable to apply for a U.S. visa for five years with
out permission from the Attorney General's
office, according to the official.
Suspected burglar nabbed
A man arrested for previous burglaries at Stan
ford has been detained again for additional
charges involving alleged theft of credit cards
from student rooms.
Police originally arrested John Douglas Gen
try, a 22-year-old Mountain View resident, on
March 2 for allegedly stealing credit cards out of
various Row houses.
Gentry could not be reached for comment last
night.
At the time of his arrest, police also speculat
ed that Gentry was connected with the illegal use
of a credit card stolen from Serra House in
February, Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer
said.
Gentry was at his residence when police arrest
ed him Sunday on a $10,000 warrant for three
felony counts of "theft of an access card," Stan
ford Police Sgt. John McMullen said.
Police have connected Gentry to the alleged use
of stolen credit cards to purchase over $1,300 in
merchandise from stores including K-mart, Cir
cuit City and Oshman's Sporting Goods, Niemey
er said.
According to the Santa Clara University Asso
ciated Students office, Gentry served as student

night

body president at the university for the 1992-93
school year.
Student arrested for alleged theft
Julie Gonzalez Luna, a 21-year-old Stanford
student, was arrested Monday when another stu
dent told police he saw her riding his bicycle,
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer said.
The student confronted Luna, who told him
that she had purchased the bicycle at a local bike
shop, Niemeyer said. Luna gave the student her
first name and phone number to call if he had any
further questions.
After the student showed Stanford Police the
receipt for the bicycle which proved his owner
ship, a deputy confronted Luna outside her
Robinson House residence, Niemeyer said.
Luna first gave the deputy the same story she
had told the student, but later recanted her state
ment when the deputy told her that the receipt
proved the bike belonged to the other student,
according to Niemeyer.
Luna could not be reached for comment last
night.

Tami Gang" from South 13th St. in San Jose, he
