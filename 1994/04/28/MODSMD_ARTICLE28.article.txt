# Comfortably numb in the '90s Joey Rosenblum

### 
The scene in the BART station was
an appropriate introduction to the
night's festivities: we stepped off
the train at the Coliseum exit, and as we
descended the escalator alarm bells began
ringing, and thousands of tightly packed
people began cheering and screaming
and clapping like mad. The anticipation
of the decade's biggest stadium spectacle
was a tangible presence in the damp
evening air.
And the crowd would not be disappoint
ed. As we found our seats in the outdoor
theater, sounds of swooping prehistoric
birds began to echo across the stadium, as if
they were and diving and screeching after
their prey. The sound was awesome; the
clarity and stereo sweeping of the noise was
unbelievable for an outdoor concert.
Look mommy, there's an airplane up in
the sky! The lights went out and the sound
of a huge low flying aircraft swept across
the stadium — Pink Floyd was about to hit
the stage. In its first American tour of the
'90s, the band that invented psychedelic

rock and roll is back and redefining the
genre once again.
I'm normally not the type to appreciate
an outdoor stadium style show, but this re
ally surpassed all my expectations. Nine out
of 10 stadium events want to show off their
decibel potential and figure that if they blast
the sound loud enough, the audience won't
hear the band screwing up. The Floyd crew
has the real concept down: the music is loud
enough to fill your head, not too loud that it
distorts, and they fill up the ambient space
with huge stereo pans and sweeping delays
to keep every ear interested.
I'll see you on the dark side of the moon. As
the evening progressed, and the moon rose
above, the experience became increasingly
more of a psychedelic one. The first songs
were framed by a projected halo of swirling,
flowing images that filled a huge screen be

hind the band. As the show progressed, the
lasers came out in force, projecting out into
the night from a variety of sources and at a
variety of angles, always attempting to move
in time to the music (not a mean feat con
sidering the amount of sound/time delay
between the band and the audience).
For the finale of the first set, the pigs that
have been around since the "Animals" tour
in '78 made an appearance, their eyes pro
jecting beams of light out at the audience as
the heads bobbed and moved and eventual
ly fell off in an explosive climax that in
volved bursts of fire, lasers and projected
imagery.
The second set was basically a set of Pink
Floyd's greatest hits, complete with stun
ning visuals, vocalists, lasers, fire, projected
movie videos and improvised psychedelic
echoes of guitar swirling between songs.

One highlight was "Time" which began
with a panoramic echo of ringing alarm
clocks and a computer graphic sequence
that took you into the inner mechanisms of
a watch.
The second set finished with a religious
raising of a giant disco ball for "Comfort
ably Numb." The whole stadium was flood
ed with psychedelic disco-style rotating
lights. As the song reached its peak, the ball
opened like a giant lotus and emitted a pil
lar of light that spun around flashed at the
audience until the band came back for an
encore.
The fact that Pink Floyd's music is still
appropriate and appreciated by so many
thousands of fans is remarkable. The show
is a true multimedia event, the first traveling
multimedia spectacle of this magnitude.
While the psychedelic ideals of the '60s and
'70s have morphed and mutated into a
smart drug, virtual world idealism, with
this tour Pink Floyd proves it is still capable
of carving new ground years after its incep
tion as a band. ■
