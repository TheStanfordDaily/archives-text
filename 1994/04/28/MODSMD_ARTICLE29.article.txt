# THE
						AFGHAN WHIGS STEPPING UP
## 
### BY ROBERT BECKER 
According to rumor, the Afghan Whigs started
the end of 1986 when vocalist/guitarist Greg
Dulli and guitarist Rick McCollum met in an
Athens, Ohio jail. Their name, which doesn't really de
scribe their sound, came along later. Says bassist John
Curley, "It doesn't really mean anything... we just kinda
thought it up. ... We had to think of something, we had
a show to play." Now, eight years and four albums later,
the Whigs are veterans of the Cincinnati music scene.
Cincinnati, famous for bands like the Ohio Players,
has not been known for its rock and roll. But Curley said
he thought the music scene was "pretty healthy for the
size town that Cincinnati is. There's a lot of people who
play in bands, there's not a lot of people that'll come
watch them. A lot of Cincinnatians are big Jimmy Buffet
fans."
The Whigs put out their own album in 1988 called
"Big Top Halloween." Then they signed to Sub-Pop.
Their experience with Sub-Pop was "great... you know,
I didn't have anything to compare it to. It had its ups and
downs ... but they're nice people, I have a lot of friends
there," Curley points out. On Sub Pop they put out two
EPs and two full length albums. Their last EP, "Uptown
Avondale," was a collection of Supremes covers. Said by
some to be a cop-out on their contract, "Avondale" was
hailed by critics. For instance, "Come See About Me" is
transformed from a tender request to a desperate com
mand. Their latest album, "Gentlemen," is on a major
label, Elektra.
LIFE IN THE MAJORS
Curley says that they weren't really looking to be on a
major label. "But when they started coming around
looking at us... then we started thinking about it. I
mean we were already on a record label that we thought
was OK. We had a good place to bargain from because it
was like if you don't like it, too bad." Asked how he felt
about being on a major label, Curley replied, "I went
along with it, didn't I?"
But, when asked if the commercialization of alterna
tive music as a whole helped bring in more money, he
said, "It doesn't really. That's a myth. I think it helps be
cause executives and people like that realize that you can
make a couple bucks off of it. So that's good for the
bands, but, it's the same as any other kind of music.
There's only going to be a fraction of the bands that ever
get signed or anything, anyway. I don't think it makes
that much of a difference." At this point, the Afghan
Whigs are a part of that lucky fraction.
The Whigs are getting ready to shoot the video for
"What Jail is Like." The shooting of their last video, of the
song "Gentlemen," went smoothly." [For] the last one we
did, we hired a director and production company and we
basically showed up. That's all we had to do."
In contrast, their previous videos had been directed
by Dulli himself. "The first ones that we made, there was
hardly any money, so like, you know, Steve Earle would
be painting the set and I would be helping build the set
which would be in my basement or something.... We
had to do everything. Greg would be writing the script
— everybody was doing stuff and you'd have to work
nonstop for three days. And then sleep."
They've been touring for "Gentlemen" since Novem
ber, when it with Love Jones opening. "Greg and Ben [a
singer from Love Jones] are friends from a bunch of years
ago. I kind of get bored at shows where I have to suffer
through a bunch of lame rock bands. And this is some
thing different. We want something different. We're
playing with the Spinanes now."
MOVIN ON UP
All the Afghan Whigs currently live in Cincinnati, al
though they may not stay there for long. "Even that
doesn't mean that much any more, cause we're never
there," Curley said. "I think we all pretty much want to
move. But, It's cheap to live there and you get caught in
this trap — you get used to living beyond your means.

times as expensive there. Greg's thinking about moving
to California."
Such a move wouldn't affect the way the band func
tions, though. "At this point it's all like chunks of time.
Instead of having a chunk of time to go on tour you just
have to have a chunk of time to practice every day, write
songs. It doesn't really matter where you do it. If we
wanted to go to where the drummer lived we could prob
ably stay at his house or something."
Right now the Whigs aren't working on anything new,
although they are on contract for two more albums.
Most of the Whigs' time since 1990 has been spent on the
road. Touring can be an essential part of making money
for a band — being on a major label isn't the cake walk
many envision it. Labels don't necessarily arrange tours.
"They don't do anything once you sign. The time to
get stuff from them is when they sign you. But once you
sign that thing it's just like a credit card. They'll loan you
money until they don't have any more. You have to pay it
all back," Curley notes.
With a major label contract and massive touring, the
Afghan Whigs have been expanding their audience. Well
received by critics and by listeners, as far as the increase
in record sales reflects, they are also well received at
home. "All of our parents are really proud of us. Steve
Earle's parents have license plates on their cars that say
'WHIGI' and 'WHIG 2.' He's the drummer. And my
mom's always cutting stuff out and sending it to me. My
dad buys Billboard magazine now. It's pretty funny, talk
ing about bands with my dad, that's something I never
thought would happen. 'Who are these guys? What are
they like?' "
COMING TOGETHER
Which comes to the sound of the Afghan Whigs
themselves. They've certainly carved their own sound on
the scene of alternative music. There's Dulli's rough vo
cals — at times desperate, other times simply blatant,
painting a bleak picture of relationships. A number of
the Whigs' songs have one "lover" feeding off the other
in reciprocal parasitism, as in the song "Tonight," off
"Congregation": "Your eyes are open, you got nothing to
do / Come outside and play with me... tonight / Follow
me down to the bushes dear / No one will know, we'll
disappear." The musical accompaniment is just as scary
and cool. Guitars limp and stagger to create a dark and
pleading atmosphere, or the drum will beat up-tempo
while the guitar whines.
In this time of bands which appear only to disappear
two albums later, we can only hope they'll stick around.
As Curley said, "You can't plan something like that.
Things can happen. It's hard when you've got to spend as
much time as you have to spend with people. Unless your
personalities click or you're willing to make sacrifices
then two albums is about all you'll be able to handle."
So take advantage while they're here. Besides being a
compelling band on record, they're a great live band. If
the Fillmore show is half as cool as their December show,
get tickets now — if there are any left. ■
The Afghan Whigs are returning to the Bay Area to play the
Fillmore Tuesday, May 3, with Redd Kross opening. For
