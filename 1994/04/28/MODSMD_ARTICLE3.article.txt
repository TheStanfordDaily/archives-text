# Endowment payout to rise half percent
## Extra $6-8 million to improve infrastructure 
### Andy Dworkin Senior staff writer 
Stanford will use millions of dollars in ad
ditional income from its investments next
year to help fund the University's infrastruc
ture.
The payout rate on Stanford's endow
ment — a $2 billion-plus pool of money the
University invests — will be raised 0.5 per
cent to 5.25 percent next year. The extra in
come will be devoted to improving the
school's physical plant, Provost Condoleezza
Rice said yesterday.
While some restrictions apply to endow
ment income, the increase will probably
translate into between $6 million and $8 mil
lion in new funds available for the infrastruc
ture next year, according to University Bud
get Director Tim Warner.
Each year, Stanford takes a percentage of
the endowment — known as the payout rate
— of the pool as income. The payout rate is

set each year by the Board of Trustees and
has been at an elevated rate of 6.75 percent
for the past two years to ease Stanford's bud
get woes. The rate was scheduled to fall back
to it's previous level of 4.75 percent this year.
But Rice said that this year University ad
ministrators "made an important. ..concep
tual breakthrough" to allow a raise in the
rate. In the past, she said, the financial health
of the endowment and physical plant have
competed with each other and more money
for one area meant less for the other.
"You sort of rob Peter to pay Paul," she
said.
To stop this, Rice said, University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper and others convinced
the trustees to raise the rate at their April
meeting. They promised to devote the extra
money to improving buildings, information
systems and other areas of the University's
physical plant.
Rice said the change "gives us a
real leg up to be able to cover some
of the debt service for restoration"
from the 1989 Loma Prieta earth
quake, renovations to and innova
tions in the physical plant.
Where did all these percentages
come from? Rice said that in the
past the endowment was pre
sumed to grow at 6.75 percent a

year, and the University's costs
were growing at about 2 percent
over inflation. Subtracting the 2
from the 6.75 yielded 4.75 percent,
the long-time payout rate.
Now, Rice said, the University
is operating under different
assumptions. Because of weaker
financial markets, the endowment
is only expected to return 6.25 per
cent. Also, she said, the University
will demonstrate its fiscal respon
sibility by holding its costs to 1 per
cent above inflation. The 6.25 esti
mate minus the 1 percent yields

the new 5.25 percent rate.
While the payout rate is set
annually and could revert to its
lower level next year, Rice said she
thinks the higher rate will contin
ue into the future "if the endow
ment maintains its rate of return
and if we stay within our 1 percent
growth."
Board of Trustees President
John Freidenrich agreed, saying
that while the rate is subject to
change any year, "I think the
intent is to keep that in place for a
while."
