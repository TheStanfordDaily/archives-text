# Endowment payout to rise half percent
## Extra $6-8 million to improve infrastructure 
### Andy Dworkin Senior staff writer 
Stanford will use millions of dollars in ad
ditional income from its investments next
year to help fund the University's infrastruc
ture.
The payout rate on Stanford's endow
ment — a $2 billion-plus pool of money the
University invests — will be raised 0.5 per
cent to 5.25 percent next year. The extra in
come will be devoted to improving the
school's physical plant, Provost Condoleezza
Rice said yesterday.
While some restrictions apply to endow
ment income, the increase will probably
translate into between $6 million and $8 mil
lion in new funds available for the infrastruc
ture next year, according to University Bud
get Director Tim Warner.
Each year, Stanford takes a percentage of
the endowment — known as the payout rate
— of the pool as income. The payout rate is

set each year by the Board of Trustees and
has been at an elevated rate of 6.75 percent
for the past two years to ease Stanford's bud
get woes. The rate was scheduled to fall back
to it's previous level of 4.75 percent this year.
But Rice said that this year University ad
ministrators "made an important. ..concep
tual breakthrough" to allow a raise in the
rate. In the past, she said, the financial health
of the endowment and physical plant have
competed with each other and more money
for one area meant less for the other.
"You sort of rob Peter to pay Paul," she
said.
To stop this, Rice said, University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper and others convinced
the trustees to raise the rate at their April
meeting. They promised to devote the extra
money to improving buildings, information
systems and other areas of the University's
physical plant.
