# Utopia days the Savoyards have came for

### Rol Roee 
the ev e of the Dead Week spring
Mquarter in 1973 almost 600 people
stood in a line that began in front of
Dinkelspiel Auditorium, wrapped around
Tresidder Union and approached the Faculty
Club. What drew this bevy of students, faculty
and community together at 10 p.m. on a Sat
urday night? Ram's 1 lead's spring show? Some
obscure Drama Department production?
Nope. It was a love of Gilbert and Sullivan.
The lucky ones in that line 20 years ago
were treated to what is perhaps W.S. Gilbert
and Arthur Sullivan's most famous operetta
— " The Pirates of Penzance." And on stage
that night, dressed in blue jeans for pirates,
black plastic wrap over tennis shoes for boots
and Stanford police uniforms for bobbies,
were the original members of the Stanford
Savoyards.
SaowpvicU, fuvit and pfiedent
This group of G&S aficionados was started
by five Stanford students, two undergraduates
and three graduate students and a small ad in
OATQ. Gradually, this small core grew to in
clude a volunteer named Rita Taylor, who took
over the chores of associate producer. Taylor
has guided this group through two decades of
"H.M.S. Pinafore," "The Yeoman of the
Guard" and other G&S classics to last week
end's staging of one of the most obscure of this
celebrated duos' collaborations, "Utopia,
Limited."
The show (which opened in Dinkelspiel
last Friday) is a satirical critique of British pol
itics in the late 19th century. But, like most dis
cussions of the distorted underbelly of poli
tics, the satire is just as applicable today as it
was a century ago.
"If you change trading in the stock market
with trading in cattle futures, you've got
Hillary Clinton right there," said Fd Glazier, a
longtime Savoyard who plays King Para
mount the First. "It's even more [applicable to
modern society] then some of Gilbert and Sul
livan's more popular shows."
Glazier's character is the ruler of Utopia but
"is an autocrat who dares not use his autocrat
ic power" for fear of being blown up by Tarara,
the Public Exploder. Impotent, the king is ma
nipulated by his two conniving wise men,
Scaphio and Phantis, into creating "The
Palace Peeper," which reports on the king's
scandalous sexual behavior, all invented by the
king himself. King Paramount then confis
cates all the copies of the tabloid which he
wrote, printed and distributed to prevent any
one else from reading them.
In typical Gilbert and Sullivan style, the
plot gets even more contorted from there, as

Princess Zara comes home from Britain and
proposes a possible solution to extract her fa
ther from his embarrassing bind. They decide
to reform Utopia by incorporating it as a com
pany, limited, under the Joint Stock Compa
nies Act of Parliament '62. With the help of
The Mowers of Progress, four British experts
in the art of company creation, the two create
a pseudo-Kngland, changing the dress, man
nerisms and culture of Utopia. Problems arise,
though, as Scaphio, Phantis and Tarara plot
the means to regain their lost positions of
stature.

The show wont win any awards for its
singing, dancing or acting; yet it is well worth
the $8 admission charge for the pure entertain
ment value of Gilbert and Sullivan. Although
this show was written late in their careers, after
several periods of intense bickering between
the two, it holds together not with a dynamic
plot, but as a humorous lambasting of politics
with melodious lyrical interjections.
And, by watching the show, one taps into
the community of the Stanford Savoyards and
their supporters. As listed in the playbill, "The

Stanford Savoyards is composed of Faculty,
Staff, Students, Alumni and Friends of Stan
ford University." The "Friends of Stanford Uni
versity" part can be read as anyone who loves
Gilbert and Sullivan and wants to become in
volved in the staging of one of their operettas,
be it acting, directing, accompanying or pro
ducing. These "Friends" are numerous, sup
porting not only the Savoyards, but two other
Gilbert and Sullivan companies in the Penin
sula as well with both bodies and dollars.
The Stanford group is entirely self-sup
ported and is made up of about 20 percent
Stanford students. The rest of the members
are from the area, with varying theatrical ex
perience. According to Taylor, the ratio of stu
dents in the Savoyards has been declining
steadily since the late '70s. This small student
membership is a slight problem.
"We do have to somehow make it clear to
present students that they are also welcome,
and indeed vital for a balanced Stanford com
munity group," she said.
One of that 20 percent is freshman Saira
Ramasastry. She plays the Princess Nekaya, a
"sexually repressed little girl," alongside her
friend and classmate Nancy Fpling, who plays
Nekaya's sister, Kalyba.
"I adore Gilbert and Sullivan," Ramasastry
said. "When I saw there was a Gilbert and Sul
livan group on campus I flipped."
According to Ramasastry, she was "wel
comed with open arms" by the Savoyards, a
group she considers not a clique but an "open
family." When asked how she finds the time
for such and activity, she countered with,
"How do I not find the time?"
Joining her in the Savoyard's ranks is fresh
man stage manager Ritesh Bhavnani, who has
enjoyed his stint working with students and
community members, but complains that "I
haven't slept in seven days." Other student
participants in "Utopia, Limited" include
chorus member Margaret Burgess and assis
tant stage director Ari Lipton.
Some students complain that there are not
enough theatrical opportunities on campus.
Perhaps, though, the problem is not casting
one's net deep enough. Groups like the Stan
ford Savoyards are eager for new Stanford
members to rejuvenate their group. As Ra
masastry suggests, "You've just got to look
harder." ■

The Stanford Savoyards' performance of
"Utopia, Limited" continues this weekend,
with shows at 8 p.m. tomorrow and Saturday
and a matinee Sunday at 2:30 p.m. All perfor
mances are at Dinkelspiel. Tickets are $10 for
the public and $6.50 for students and seniors.

man stage manager Ritesh Bhavnani, who has
enjoyed his stint working with students and
community members, but complains that "I
haven't slept in seven days." Other student
participants in "Utopia, Limited" include
chorus member Margaret Burgess and assis
tant stage director Ari Lipton.
Some students complain that there are not
enough theatrical opportunities on campus.
Perhaps, though, the problem is not casting
one's net deep enough. Groups like the Stan
ford Savoyards are eager for new Stanford
members to rejuvenate their group. As Ra
masastry suggests, "You've just got to look
harder." ■

The Stanford Savoyards' performance of
"Utopia, Limited" continues this weekend,
with shows at 8 p.m. tomorrow and Saturday
and a matinee Sunday at 2:30 p.m. All perfor
mances are at Dinkelspiel. Tickets are $10 for
the public and $6.50 for students and seniors.

the ev e of the Dead Week spring
Mquarter in 1973 almost 600 people
stood in a line that began in front of
Dinkelspiel Auditorium, wrapped around
Tresidder Union and approached the Faculty
Club. What drew this bevy of students, faculty
and community together at 10 p.m. on a Sat
urday night? Ram's 1 lead's spring show? Some
obscure Drama Department production?
Nope. It was a love of Gilbert and Sullivan.
The lucky ones in that line 20 years ago
were treated to what is perhaps W.S. Gilbert
and Arthur Sullivan's most famous operetta
— " The Pirates of Penzance." And on stage
that night, dressed in blue jeans for pirates,
black plastic wrap over tennis shoes for boots
and Stanford police uniforms for bobbies,
were the original members of the Stanford
Savoyards.
SaowpvicU, fuvit and pfiedent
This group of G&S aficionados was started
by five Stanford students, two undergraduates
and three graduate students and a small ad in
OATQ. Gradually, this small core grew to in
clude a volunteer named Rita Taylor, who took
over the chores of associate producer. Taylor
has guided this group through two decades of
"H.M.S. Pinafore," "The Yeoman of the
Guard" and other G&S classics to last week
end's staging of one of the most obscure of this
celebrated duos' collaborations, "Utopia,
Limited."
The show (which opened in Dinkelspiel
last Friday) is a satirical critique of British pol
itics in the late 19th century. But, like most dis
cussions of the distorted underbelly of poli
tics, the satire is just as applicable today as it
was a century ago.
"If you change trading in the stock market
with trading in cattle futures, you've got
Hillary Clinton right there," said Fd Glazier, a
longtime Savoyard who plays King Para
mount the First. "It's even more [applicable to
modern society] then some of Gilbert and Sul
livan's more popular shows."
Glazier's character is the ruler of Utopia but
"is an autocrat who dares not use his autocrat
ic power" for fear of being blown up by Tarara,
the Public Exploder. Impotent, the king is ma
nipulated by his two conniving wise men,
Scaphio and Phantis, into creating "The
Palace Peeper," which reports on the king's
scandalous sexual behavior, all invented by the
king himself. King Paramount then confis
cates all the copies of the tabloid which he
wrote, printed and distributed to prevent any
one else from reading them.
In typical Gilbert and Sullivan style, the
plot gets even more contorted from there, as

Princess Zara comes home from Britain and
proposes a possible solution to extract her fa
ther from his embarrassing bind. They decide
to reform Utopia by incorporating it as a com
pany, limited, under the Joint Stock Compa
nies Act of Parliament '62. With the help of
The Mowers of Progress, four British experts
in the art of company creation, the two create
a pseudo-Kngland, changing the dress, man
nerisms and culture of Utopia. Problems arise,
though, as Scaphio, Phantis and Tarara plot
the means to regain their lost positions of
stature.

The show wont win any awards for its
singing, dancing or acting; yet it is well worth
the $8 admission charge for the pure entertain
ment value of Gilbert and Sullivan. Although
this show was written late in their careers, after
several periods of intense bickering between
the two, it holds together not with a dynamic
plot, but as a humorous lambasting of politics
with melodious lyrical interjections.
And, by watching the show, one taps into
the community of the Stanford Savoyards and
their supporters. As listed in the playbill, "The

Stanford Savoyards is composed of Faculty,
Staff, Students, Alumni and Friends of Stan
ford University." The "Friends of Stanford Uni
versity" part can be read as anyone who loves
Gilbert and Sullivan and wants to become in
volved in the staging of one of their operettas,
be it acting, directing, accompanying or pro
ducing. These "Friends" are numerous, sup
porting not only the Savoyards, but two other
Gilbert and Sullivan companies in the Penin
sula as well with both bodies and dollars.
The Stanford group is entirely self-sup
ported and is made up of about 20 percent
Stanford students. The rest of the members
are from the area, with varying theatrical ex
perience. According to Taylor, the ratio of stu
dents in the Savoyards has been declining
steadily since the late '70s. This small student
membership is a slight problem.
"We do have to somehow make it clear to
present students that they are also welcome,
and indeed vital for a balanced Stanford com
munity group," she said.
One of that 20 percent is freshman Saira
Ramasastry. She plays the Princess Nekaya, a
"sexually repressed little girl," alongside her
friend and classmate Nancy Fpling, who plays
Nekaya's sister, Kalyba.
"I adore Gilbert and Sullivan," Ramasastry
said. "When I saw there was a Gilbert and Sul
livan group on campus I flipped."
According to Ramasastry, she was "wel
comed with open arms" by the Savoyards, a
group she considers not a clique but an "open
family." When asked how she finds the time
for such and activity, she countered with,
"How do I not find the time?"
Joining her in the Savoyard's ranks is fresh
