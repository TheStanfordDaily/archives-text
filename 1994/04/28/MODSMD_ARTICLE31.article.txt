It's a day just like any other day when she
calls. Her name is Shelly. Shelly Spicer. Shelly
Spicer calling for Warner Bros. With a tongue
twister of name like that, 1 know she's gonna
be trouble. But I listen anyway.
She wants to make me an offer 1 can't
refuse. She'll fly me down to Los Angeles next
Friday for in person interviews with the cast
and crew of "With Honors." Open ticket. For
free. Lunch included.
I've gotta admit, I'm skeptical. But it'll be
my first press junket ever. Face-to-face inter
views with up-and-coming Hollywood stars
and starlets, fawning publicists tending to
their every need and sycophantic college writ
ers at work straining not to miss a single word.
It's a satirist's dream. Besides, there's no way
that these freebies could possibly impair my
objectivity. None. Nada. Zip.
Not to mention the fact that I've got friends
in Los Angeles that have been on me to come
visit all year. A two-day vacation will do me
some good. I tell her that I'll talk to my editors
about it and get back to her.

Rosenweigand Alan Li circle warily around me.
John: This is the big-time, N'Gai.
Alan: This isn't Daily 101 anymore.
John: You're not a new writer.
Alan: Or a staff writer.
John: Or a senior staff
writer.
Alan: Or even

John:
You're writing
the Intermission
cover story.
Alan: This is big-time responsi

John: The biggest.
Alan: We're talking Generation Xon

John: We're talking "Reality Bites," "Three

Alan: Winona, I,ara, Moira.
John: Who, where, when, why and how.
Alan: Comprende?

Having seen the movie begs the question:
why was this made? The trite plot borders on
the offensive. A homeless man named Simon
(Joe Pesci) gets hold of Harvard student
Monty Kessler's (Brendan Fraser) senior the
sis. In a poor imitation of "The Piano," Simon
makes a deal with Monty: one page of the the
sis will be returned for one basic necessity. You
know, oatmeal, a blanket, a roof over his head,
etc.
In the process, the two men teach each
other valuable life lessons. Monty learns to be
less cynical (read: tight-assed conservative)
and more optimistic (read: teary-eyed liber
al). Simon, on the other hand, learns that it's
never too late to say you're sorry. Particularly
to the child he abandoned years ago — in a
shocking twist of fate — just like Monty's fa
ther abandoned him years ago. I guess that's,
like, symmetry.
Perhaps it's just me, but don't homeless
people have better things to do with their lives
than redeem the lives of spoiled college chil
dren? And isn't it just a tad convenient that our
spunky, wisdom-toting transient shuffles off
this mortal coil in time to avoid such unpleas
antness as meeting Monty's parents, prospec
tive employers, and so on? Only in Holly
wood.
My friend and driver suggests that it
might have been better for the
cast and crew had I
not seen the
film. I

tell her
that they have
nothing to fear. Because
when I've got a puff piece to
write, I'm damn near unstoppable.
At least "Threesome," which stars Josh
Charles, Stephen Baldwin and Lara Flynn
Boyle, appeals to my prurient interests. Here,
any pretense of academics is kicked to the curb
in favor of sex. Thinking about sex, reading
about sex, listening to sex, watching sex and,
yes, even having sex.
Three college students — two boys and a
girl — accidentally assigned to the same room.
Let's call them Straight Male, Straight Female
and Questioning Male. Straight Male wants
Straight Female, who wants Questioning
Male, who of course wants Straight Male. A
bizarre love triangle that aspires to be a "Jules
et Jim" for the '90s.
Unfortunately, the sophomoric intelli
gence of the writers turns their provocative
premise into a "Jack et Jill," as in Andrew Dice
Clay's famed nursery rhymes. They're too

busy patting themselves on the back for hav
ing the "courage" to include a gay character,
two guys sleeping with the same woman and a
three-way orgy in the same film to notice what
they've left out. Namely wit, eroticism and
originality.
Of more interest is the wildly homophobic
audience that sat around me. At even the
slightest hint of homosexual activity — Tom
Hanks got more action in "Philadelphia" —
groans and retching noises filled the theater.
One can only wonder if these people bothered
to read the reviews. Perhaps they got their
numbers confused and thought it was going to
be "Four Weddings and a Funeral." Either way,
they helped make a bad movie experience
worse.
Oh well. At least I'm getting a free trip to
L.A.

Shelly calls. Shelly Spicer. Shelly Spicer
from Warner Bros. My sixth sense goes off like
a police siren. Something is definitely rotten in
Denmark.
The only words 1 hear before I pass out are
"canceled," "not enough interest," "sorry" and
"can you do a phone interview?"
Later, I find out that my editors pried the
phone out of my hand, answered "most
definitely" for me and hung up.
They could at least
have

moved you to the lounge, my pounding head
screams. I put a sock in its mouth, call my
friend Andrew in Los Angeles, and tell him
that I won't be coming down.

I get a message from Andrew saying that

With Honors: 'Why was this made? The trite plot borders on the offensive.'

Time: 11:37 p.m.
Place: USC Film School
If I can't talk to the big boys in person, 1 fig
ure 1 might as well talk to the big boys (and
in training. Perhaps they can provide me
with some insights that a pair of 15-minute
phone interviews can't.
So here 1 am, standing in a Dickensian
sweatshop of an editing room. It's crammed
full of moviolas, reel-to-reels, splicers, strips of
developed 16 mm film and bins stuffed with
film trimmings. Oh, and about 20 students.
I say hi to Matt, another friend from Stan
ford, who is re-editing a film that he directed,
"Dead Man's Coin." On the moviola
screen, a businessman notices a coin

standing on its side, picks it up and pockets it.
It turns out that the coin belonged to a home
less man he once ignored and brings with it a
curse. This homelessness theme is everywhere,
it seems.
Andrew takes me over to his partners who
are busily editing their film. He was the cine
matographer on this project, but within min
utes, he slips effortlessly into producer mode,
making picture editing and audio suggestions.
The actual producer, Michelle, is excited
about what they've got, but the sound isn't
working. "Let him listen to the end title
music," she tells the director, Garrett.
He offers me a pair of headphones. 1 put
them on, but Michelle wants to play it through
the speakers, which she does. Out comes a
wailing saxophone solo with an ominous hint
of piano beneath it. On the small moviola
screen, the credits roll by.
"Can you hear it?" Garrett says."The key
board underneath the sax makes it evil."
The next thing 1 know, I'm in a video edit
ing suite watching a videotaped copy of their
film. An abrasive, solitary puzzle-cutter
yes, that's his job — finds himself haunted by
a saxophone player who waxes (kiltrane-esque
right under his window. When the saxophon
ist refuses to stop playing, puzzle-man beats
him over the head with the instrument, drags

the corpse away and returns to his apart
ment.
But he continues to hear the music
playing. When he hears someone at the
door, he assumes that it's the police and
runs out onto his ledge, where he falls to
his death. The twist? Standing next to his
corpse is the saxophonist, with a bandaged
head and a new tenor in his hand. He takes his
hat off and holds it to his chest. Is it pity?
Irony? Fade to black.

It's pretty well made, but it's hard for me to
be objective about film noir lighting, which I
love. I ask Garrett whether it's a metaphor for
race relations in America, given that puzzle
man is white and the saxophonist is black. "1
hadn't thought about that interpretation," he
says. While he and Andrew discuss the rest of
the editing process, I entertain myself with
permutations of their story — a black puzzle
cutter might kill a white saxophonist, shouting
"Flvis was a hero to most / but he didn't mean
shit to me." Or the two of them could play
"Ebony and Ivory."
Los Angeles is starting to get to me.
Date: Friday, April 18, 1994

Place: Sunset Boulevard
Andrew's been taking me on the grand tour
of the city of angels. So far, I've seen Mann's
Chinese Theater, The Hollywood Walk of
Fame, Beverly Hills and Rodeo Drive.
Now we're on Sunset Boulevard, and I'm
half expecting to see William Holden speeding

us on the lam, or to
hear Gloria Swanson shrieking "I'm ready tor
my close-up, Mr. DeMille" from the back of a
squad car. Or would that be Andrew Lloyd
Webber speeding away from a wild-eyed I'atti
LuFone shouting "I am big. It's the composers
that got small" from the top of her gilt-edged
staircase?
1 sit back, close my eyes and let my Tinsel
town fantasies run wild.
Date: Friday, April 18, 1994
Time: 11:28 a.m.
Place: Andrew's apartment
Alek Keshkishian, the director of "With
Honors," as well as "Truth or Dare" and
countless Madonna videos, calls me tor his in
terview. He's both affable and effusive — what
more can an aspiring writer ask tor?
We talk for 15 minutes, about why he made
the movie, Generation X, working with Joe
Pesci, working with up-and-coming actors,
working with Madonna and trying to keep
working. All-in-all, a pretty good interview.
Brendan Fraser, of "Fncino Man" fame, is a
completely different story. He doesn't seem to
want to talk and the fact that the questions are
coming off the top of my head doesn't help. 1 le
misinterprets my first question, doesn't re
spond to my casual name-dropping (an Ash
ley Judd anecdote about him and his relation
ship with the paparazzi), has little to say about
his critics and can barely muster the energy to
plug his next two movies — all in a barely au
dible whisper.
After 10 excruciating minutes, I decide to
put us both out of our mutual misery and

wrap up the interview. To make things worse,
the tape recorder I've hooked up to the phone
wasn't properly connected. The only voice I
can hear on the tape is my own.
I'll never eat lunch in this town again.

I wasn't expecting much from these inter
views, hut the Brendan Fraser fiasco is getting
to me. I had visions of writing the definitive
Fraser story. From one line in "Dogfight" to
second-billing with loe Pesci. The next Olivi
er, Brando and Cruise wrapped in one tall,
sensitive frame. I would chronicle his rise from

obscu
rity to fame and
garner a Pulitzer in the
process.
But I've been denied. Like a piece of carrion
that wakes up and escapes from the vulture
circling over head, Fraser refused to cooperate.
Good-bye, Variety. Farewell, Pulitzer. I wallow
in my despair like a lukewarm bubble bath.
To cheer me up, Andrew and Matt take me
to see "Bad Girls" on opening night at a plush
LA. theater. It works, but not in the way we'd
intended. What was billed as a "Wild Bunch"
with women turns into "Hoes on the Range;"
a pseudo-feminist camp classic in the making.
Hopefully Gus van Sant's upcoming adapta
tion of "Even Cowgirls Get the Blues" will
eradicate all traces of this from my memory.
The three of us dissect its problems over
hamburgers and shakes, then call it a night.

calls. Her name is Shelly. Shelly Spicer. Shelly
Spicer calling for Warner Bros. With a tongue
twister of name like that, 1 know she's gonna
be trouble. But I listen anyway.
She wants to make me an offer 1 can't
refuse. She'll fly me down to Los Angeles next
Friday for in person interviews with the cast
and crew of "With Honors." Open ticket. For
free. Lunch included.
I've gotta admit, I'm skeptical. But it'll be
my first press junket ever. Face-to-face inter
views with up-and-coming Hollywood stars
and starlets, fawning publicists tending to
their every need and sycophantic college writ
ers at work straining not to miss a single word.
It's a satirist's dream. Besides, there's no way
that these freebies could possibly impair my
objectivity. None. Nada. Zip.
Not to mention the fact that I've got friends
in Los Angeles that have been on me to come

some good. I tell her that I'll talk to my editors
about it and get back to her.

Having seen the movie begs the question:
why was this made? The trite plot borders on
the offensive. A homeless man named Simon
(Joe Pesci) gets hold of Harvard student
Monty Kessler's (Brendan Fraser) senior the
sis. In a poor imitation of "The Piano," Simon
makes a deal with Monty: one page of the the
sis will be returned for one basic necessity. You
know, oatmeal, a blanket, a roof over his head,
etc.
In the process, the two men teach each
other valuable life lessons. Monty learns to be
less cynical (read: tight-assed conservative)
and more optimistic (read: teary-eyed liber
al). Simon, on the other hand, learns that it's
never too late to say you're sorry. Particularly
to the child he abandoned years ago — in a
shocking twist of fate — just like Monty's fa
ther abandoned him years ago. I guess that's,
like, symmetry.
Perhaps it's just me, but don't homeless
people have better things to do with their lives
than redeem the lives of spoiled college chil
dren? And isn't it just a tad convenient that our
spunky, wisdom-toting transient shuffles off
this mortal coil in time to avoid such unpleas
antness as meeting Monty's parents, prospec
tive employers, and so on? Only in Holly
wood.
My friend and driver suggests that it
might have been better for the
cast and crew had I
not seen the
film. I

tell her
that they have
nothing to fear. Because
when I've got a puff piece to
write, I'm damn near unstoppable.
At least "Threesome," which stars Josh
Charles, Stephen Baldwin and Lara Flynn
Boyle, appeals to my prurient interests. Here,
any pretense of academics is kicked to the curb
in favor of sex. Thinking about sex, reading
about sex, listening to sex, watching sex and,
yes, even having sex.
Three college students — two boys and a
girl — accidentally assigned to the same room.
Let's call them Straight Male, Straight Female
and Questioning Male. Straight Male wants
Straight Female, who wants Questioning
Male, who of course wants Straight Male. A
bizarre love triangle that aspires to be a "Jules
et Jim" for the '90s.
Unfortunately, the sophomoric intelli
gence of the writers turns their provocative
premise into a "Jack et Jill," as in Andrew Dice
Clay's famed nursery rhymes. They're too

busy patting themselves on the back for hav
ing the "courage" to include a gay character,
two guys sleeping with the same woman and a
three-way orgy in the same film to notice what
they've left out. Namely wit, eroticism and
originality.
Of more interest is the wildly homophobic
audience that sat around me. At even the
slightest hint of homosexual activity — Tom
Hanks got more action in "Philadelphia" —
groans and retching noises filled the theater.
One can only wonder if these people bothered
to read the reviews. Perhaps they got their
numbers confused and thought it was going to
be "Four Weddings and a Funeral." Either way,
they helped make a bad movie experience
worse.
Oh well. At least I'm getting a free trip to

The only words 1 hear before I pass out are
"canceled," "not enough interest," "sorry" and
"can you do a phone interview?"
Later, I find out that my editors pried the
phone out of my hand, answered "most
definitely" for me and hung up.

With Honors: 'Why was this made? The trite plot borders on the offensive.'

Time: 11:37 p.m.
Place: USC Film School
If I can't talk to the big boys in person, 1 fig
ure 1 might as well talk to the big boys (and
in training. Perhaps they can provide me
with some insights that a pair of 15-minute
phone interviews can't.
So here 1 am, standing in a Dickensian
sweatshop of an editing room. It's crammed
full of moviolas, reel-to-reels, splicers, strips of
developed 16 mm film and bins stuffed with
film trimmings. Oh, and about 20 students.
I say hi to Matt, another friend from Stan
ford, who is re-editing a film that he directed,
"Dead Man's Coin." On the moviola
screen, a businessman notices a coin

standing on its side, picks it up and pockets it.
It turns out that the coin belonged to a home
less man he once ignored and brings with it a
curse. This homelessness theme is everywhere,
it seems.
Andrew takes me over to his partners who
are busily editing their film. He was the cine
matographer on this project, but within min
utes, he slips effortlessly into producer mode,
making picture editing and audio suggestions.
The actual producer, Michelle, is excited
about what they've got, but the sound isn't
working. "Let him listen to the end title
music," she tells the director, Garrett.
He offers me a pair of headphones. 1 put
them on, but Michelle wants to play it through
the speakers, which she does. Out comes a
wailing saxophone solo with an ominous hint
of piano beneath it. On the small moviola
screen, the credits roll by.
"Can you hear it?" Garrett says."The key
board underneath the sax makes it evil."
The next thing 1 know, I'm in a video edit
ing suite watching a videotaped copy of their
film. An abrasive, solitary puzzle-cutter
yes, that's his job — finds himself haunted by
a saxophone player who waxes (kiltrane-esque
right under his window. When the saxophon
ist refuses to stop playing, puzzle-man beats
him over the head with the instrument, drags

the corpse away and returns to his apart
ment.
But he continues to hear the music
playing. When he hears someone at the
door, he assumes that it's the police and
runs out onto his ledge, where he falls to
his death. The twist? Standing next to his
corpse is the saxophonist, with a bandaged
head and a new tenor in his hand. He takes his
hat off and holds it to his chest. Is it pity?
Irony? Fade to black.

It's pretty well made, but it's hard for me to
be objective about film noir lighting, which I
love. I ask Garrett whether it's a metaphor for
race relations in America, given that puzzle
man is white and the saxophonist is black. "1
hadn't thought about that interpretation," he
says. While he and Andrew discuss the rest of
the editing process, I entertain myself with
permutations of their story — a black puzzle
cutter might kill a white saxophonist, shouting
"Flvis was a hero to most / but he didn't mean
shit to me." Or the two of them could play
"Ebony and Ivory."
Los Angeles is starting to get to me.

Andrew's been taking me on the grand tour

Now we're on Sunset Boulevard, and I'm
half expecting to see William Holden speeding

us on the lam, or to
hear Gloria Swanson shrieking "I'm ready tor
my close-up, Mr. DeMille" from the back of a
squad car. Or would that be Andrew Lloyd
Webber speeding away from a wild-eyed I'atti
LuFone shouting "I am big. It's the composers
that got small" from the top of her gilt-edged
staircase?

Alek Keshkishian, the director of "With
Honors," as well as "Truth or Dare" and
countless Madonna videos, calls me tor his in
terview. He's both affable and effusive — what
more can an aspiring writer ask tor?
We talk for 15 minutes, about why he made
the movie, Generation X, working with Joe
Pesci, working with up-and-coming actors,
working with Madonna and trying to keep
working. All-in-all, a pretty good interview.
Brendan Fraser, of "Fncino Man" fame, is a
completely different story. He doesn't seem to
want to talk and the fact that the questions are
coming off the top of my head doesn't help. 1 le
misinterprets my first question, doesn't re
spond to my casual name-dropping (an Ash
ley Judd anecdote about him and his relation
ship with the paparazzi), has little to say about
his critics and can barely muster the energy to
plug his next two movies — all in a barely au
dible whisper.
After 10 excruciating minutes, I decide to
put us both out of our mutual misery and

wrap up the interview. To make things worse,
the tape recorder I've hooked up to the phone
wasn't properly connected. The only voice I
can hear on the tape is my own.
I'll never eat lunch in this town again.

second-billing with loe Pesci. The next Olivi
er, Brando and Cruise wrapped in one tall,
sensitive frame. I would chronicle his rise from

obscu
rity to fame and
garner a Pulitzer in the
process.
But I've been denied. Like a piece of carrion
that wakes up and escapes from the vulture
circling over head, Fraser refused to cooperate.
Good-bye, Variety. Farewell, Pulitzer. I wallow
in my despair like a lukewarm bubble bath.
To cheer me up, Andrew and Matt take me
to see "Bad Girls" on opening night at a plush
LA. theater. It works, but not in the way we'd
intended. What was billed as a "Wild Bunch"
with women turns into "Hoes on the Range;"
a pseudo-feminist camp classic in the making.
Hopefully Gus van Sant's upcoming adapta

eradicate all traces of this from my memory.
The three of us dissect its problems over

Having seen the movie begs the question:
why was this made? The trite plot borders on
the offensive. A homeless man named Simon
(Joe Pesci) gets hold of Harvard student
Monty Kessler's (Brendan Fraser) senior the
sis. In a poor imitation of "The Piano," Simon
makes a deal with Monty: one page of the the
sis will be returned for one basic necessity. You
know, oatmeal, a blanket, a roof over his head,
etc.
In the process, the two men teach each
other valuable life lessons. Monty learns to be
less cynical (read: tight-assed conservative)
and more optimistic (read: teary-eyed liber
al). Simon, on the other hand, learns that it's
never too late to say you're sorry. Particularly
to the child he abandoned years ago — in a
shocking twist of fate — just like Monty's fa
ther abandoned him years ago. I guess that's,
like, symmetry.
Perhaps it's just me, but don't homeless
people have better things to do with their lives
than redeem the lives of spoiled college chil
dren? And isn't it just a tad convenient that our
spunky, wisdom-toting transient shuffles off
this mortal coil in time to avoid such unpleas
antness as meeting Monty's parents, prospec
tive employers, and so on? Only in Holly
wood.
My friend and driver suggests that it
might have been better for the
cast and crew had I
not seen the
film. I

tell her
that they have
nothing to fear. Because
when I've got a puff piece to
write, I'm damn near unstoppable.
At least "Threesome," which stars Josh
Charles, Stephen Baldwin and Lara Flynn
Boyle, appeals to my prurient interests. Here,
any pretense of academics is kicked to the curb
in favor of sex. Thinking about sex, reading
about sex, listening to sex, watching sex and,
yes, even having sex.
Three college students — two boys and a
girl — accidentally assigned to the same room.
Let's call them Straight Male, Straight Female
and Questioning Male. Straight Male wants
Straight Female, who wants Questioning
Male, who of course wants Straight Male. A
bizarre love triangle that aspires to be a "Jules
et Jim" for the '90s.
Unfortunately, the sophomoric intelli
gence of the writers turns their provocative
premise into a "Jack et Jill," as in Andrew Dice
Clay's famed nursery rhymes. They're too

busy patting themselves on the back for hav
ing the "courage" to include a gay character,
two guys sleeping with the same woman and a
three-way orgy in the same film to notice what
they've left out. Namely wit, eroticism and
originality.
Of more interest is the wildly homophobic
audience that sat around me. At even the
slightest hint of homosexual activity — Tom
Hanks got more action in "Philadelphia" —
groans and retching noises filled the theater.
One can only wonder if these people bothered
to read the reviews. Perhaps they got their
numbers confused and thought it was going to
be "Four Weddings and a Funeral." Either way,
they helped make a bad movie experience
worse.
Oh well. At least I'm getting a free trip to

"can you do a phone interview?"
Later, I find out that my editors pried the
phone out of my hand, answered "most

With Honors: 'Why was this made? The trite plot borders on the offensive.'

Time: 11:37 p.m.
Place: USC Film School
If I can't talk to the big boys in person, 1 fig
ure 1 might as well talk to the big boys (and
in training. Perhaps they can provide me
with some insights that a pair of 15-minute
phone interviews can't.
So here 1 am, standing in a Dickensian
sweatshop of an editing room. It's crammed
full of moviolas, reel-to-reels, splicers, strips of
developed 16 mm film and bins stuffed with
film trimmings. Oh, and about 20 students.
I say hi to Matt, another friend from Stan
ford, who is re-editing a film that he directed,
"Dead Man's Coin." On the moviola
screen, a businessman notices a coin

standing on its side, picks it up and pockets it.
It turns out that the coin belonged to a home
less man he once ignored and brings with it a
curse. This homelessness theme is everywhere,
it seems.
Andrew takes me over to his partners who
are busily editing their film. He was the cine
matographer on this project, but within min
utes, he slips effortlessly into producer mode,
making picture editing and audio suggestions.
The actual producer, Michelle, is excited
about what they've got, but the sound isn't
working. "Let him listen to the end title
music," she tells the director, Garrett.
He offers me a pair of headphones. 1 put
them on, but Michelle wants to play it through
the speakers, which she does. Out comes a
wailing saxophone solo with an ominous hint
of piano beneath it. On the small moviola
screen, the credits roll by.
"Can you hear it?" Garrett says."The key
board underneath the sax makes it evil."
The next thing 1 know, I'm in a video edit
ing suite watching a videotaped copy of their
film. An abrasive, solitary puzzle-cutter
yes, that's his job — finds himself haunted by
a saxophone player who waxes (kiltrane-esque
right under his window. When the saxophon
ist refuses to stop playing, puzzle-man beats
him over the head with the instrument, drags

the corpse away and returns to his apart
ment.
But he continues to hear the music
playing. When he hears someone at the
door, he assumes that it's the police and
runs out onto his ledge, where he falls to
his death. The twist? Standing next to his
corpse is the saxophonist, with a bandaged
head and a new tenor in his hand. He takes his
hat off and holds it to his chest. Is it pity?
Irony? Fade to black.

It's pretty well made, but it's hard for me to
be objective about film noir lighting, which I
love. I ask Garrett whether it's a metaphor for
race relations in America, given that puzzle
man is white and the saxophonist is black. "1
hadn't thought about that interpretation," he
says. While he and Andrew discuss the rest of
the editing process, I entertain myself with
permutations of their story — a black puzzle
cutter might kill a white saxophonist, shouting
"Flvis was a hero to most / but he didn't mean
shit to me." Or the two of them could play
"Ebony and Ivory."

Andrew's been taking me on the grand tour

Now we're on Sunset Boulevard, and I'm
half expecting to see William Holden speeding

us on the lam, or to
hear Gloria Swanson shrieking "I'm ready tor
my close-up, Mr. DeMille" from the back of a
squad car. Or would that be Andrew Lloyd
Webber speeding away from a wild-eyed I'atti
LuFone shouting "I am big. It's the composers
that got small" from the top of her gilt-edged
staircase?

Alek Keshkishian, the director of "With
Honors," as well as "Truth or Dare" and
countless Madonna videos, calls me tor his in
terview. He's both affable and effusive — what
more can an aspiring writer ask tor?
We talk for 15 minutes, about why he made
the movie, Generation X, working with Joe
Pesci, working with up-and-coming actors,
working with Madonna and trying to keep
working. All-in-all, a pretty good interview.
Brendan Fraser, of "Fncino Man" fame, is a
completely different story. He doesn't seem to
want to talk and the fact that the questions are
coming off the top of my head doesn't help. 1 le
misinterprets my first question, doesn't re
spond to my casual name-dropping (an Ash
ley Judd anecdote about him and his relation
ship with the paparazzi), has little to say about
his critics and can barely muster the energy to
plug his next two movies — all in a barely au
dible whisper.
After 10 excruciating minutes, I decide to
put us both out of our mutual misery and

wrap up the interview. To make things worse,
the tape recorder I've hooked up to the phone
wasn't properly connected. The only voice I
can hear on the tape is my own.
I'll never eat lunch in this town again.

er, Brando and Cruise wrapped in one tall,
sensitive frame. I would chronicle his rise from

obscu
rity to fame and
garner a Pulitzer in the
process.
But I've been denied. Like a piece of carrion
that wakes up and escapes from the vulture
circling over head, Fraser refused to cooperate.
Good-bye, Variety. Farewell, Pulitzer. I wallow
in my despair like a lukewarm bubble bath.
To cheer me up, Andrew and Matt take me
to see "Bad Girls" on opening night at a plush
LA. theater. It works, but not in the way we'd
intended. What was billed as a "Wild Bunch"
with women turns into "Hoes on the Range;"
a pseudo-feminist camp classic in the making.
Hopefully Gus van Sant's upcoming adapta

eradicate all traces of this from my memory.

their every need and sycophantic college writ
ers at work straining not to miss a single word.
It's a satirist's dream. Besides, there's no way
that these freebies could possibly impair my
objectivity. None. Nada. Zip.
Not to mention the fact that I've got friends
in Los Angeles that have been on me to come
visit all year. A two-day vacation will do me
some good. I tell her that I'll talk to my editors
about it and get back to her.

I'm sitting in the offices of The Daily. A sin
gle light shines overhead as my editors, John
Rosenweigand Alan Li circle warily around me.
John: This is the big-time, N'Gai.
Alan: This isn't Daily 101 anymore.
John: You're not a new writer.
Alan: Or a staff writer.
John: Or a senior staff
writer.
Alan: Or even
an editor.

John:
You're writing
the Intermission
cover story.
Alan: This is big-time responsi
bility.
John: The biggest.
Alan: We're talking Generation Xon
screen.
John: We're talking "Reality Bites," "Three
some" and "With Honors."
Alan: Winona, I,ara, Moira.
John: Who, where, when, why and how.
Alan: Comprende?
John: 55 inches.
Alan: Solid inches.
John: Can you deliver?

Alan: Deliver, can you?
Me: Uh, yeah.

Having seen the movie begs the question:
why was this made? The trite plot borders on
the offensive. A homeless man named Simon
(Joe Pesci) gets hold of Harvard student
Monty Kessler's (Brendan Fraser) senior the
sis. In a poor imitation of "The Piano," Simon
makes a deal with Monty: one page of the the
sis will be returned for one basic necessity. You
know, oatmeal, a blanket, a roof over his head,
etc.
In the process, the two men teach each
other valuable life lessons. Monty learns to be
less cynical (read: tight-assed conservative)
and more optimistic (read: teary-eyed liber
al). Simon, on the other hand, learns that it's
never too late to say you're sorry. Particularly
to the child he abandoned years ago — in a
shocking twist of fate — just like Monty's fa
ther abandoned him years ago. I guess that's,
like, symmetry.
Perhaps it's just me, but don't homeless
people have better things to do with their lives
than redeem the lives of spoiled college chil
dren? And isn't it just a tad convenient that our
spunky, wisdom-toting transient shuffles off
this mortal coil in time to avoid such unpleas
antness as meeting Monty's parents, prospec
tive employers, and so on? Only in Holly
wood.
My friend and driver suggests that it
might have been better for the
cast and crew had I
not seen the
film. I

tell her
that they have
nothing to fear. Because
when I've got a puff piece to
write, I'm damn near unstoppable.
At least "Threesome," which stars Josh
Charles, Stephen Baldwin and Lara Flynn
Boyle, appeals to my prurient interests. Here,
any pretense of academics is kicked to the curb
in favor of sex. Thinking about sex, reading
about sex, listening to sex, watching sex and,
yes, even having sex.
Three college students — two boys and a
girl — accidentally assigned to the same room.
Let's call them Straight Male, Straight Female
and Questioning Male. Straight Male wants
Straight Female, who wants Questioning
Male, who of course wants Straight Male. A
bizarre love triangle that aspires to be a "Jules
et Jim" for the '90s.
Unfortunately, the sophomoric intelli
gence of the writers turns their provocative
premise into a "Jack et Jill," as in Andrew Dice
Clay's famed nursery rhymes. They're too

busy patting themselves on the back for hav
ing the "courage" to include a gay character,
two guys sleeping with the same woman and a
three-way orgy in the same film to notice what
they've left out. Namely wit, eroticism and
originality.
Of more interest is the wildly homophobic
audience that sat around me. At even the
slightest hint of homosexual activity — Tom
Hanks got more action in "Philadelphia" —
groans and retching noises filled the theater.
One can only wonder if these people bothered
to read the reviews. Perhaps they got their
numbers confused and thought it was going to
be "Four Weddings and a Funeral." Either way,
they helped make a bad movie experience
worse.
Oh well. At least I'm getting a free trip to
L.A.

Shelly calls. Shelly Spicer. Shelly Spicer
from Warner Bros. My sixth sense goes off like
a police siren. Something is definitely rotten in
Denmark.
The only words 1 hear before I pass out are
"canceled," "not enough interest," "sorry" and
"can you do a phone interview?"
Later, I find out that my editors pried the
phone out of my hand, answered "most
definitely" for me and hung up.
They could at least
have

moved you to the lounge, my pounding head
screams. I put a sock in its mouth, call my
friend Andrew in Los Angeles, and tell him
that I won't be coming down.

What a horrible landing. I hate this place

I get a message from Andrew saying that
he bought me a ticket on a 9 p.m. flight to
LAX out of SFO and I'd better be on it
ASAP or I'll be DEAD. I like my life. I get

Back to our story already in

With Honors: 'Why was this made? The trite plot borders on the offensive.'

Time: 11:37 p.m.
Place: USC Film School
If I can't talk to the big boys in person, 1 fig
ure 1 might as well talk to the big boys (and
in training. Perhaps they can provide me
with some insights that a pair of 15-minute
phone interviews can't.
So here 1 am, standing in a Dickensian
sweatshop of an editing room. It's crammed
full of moviolas, reel-to-reels, splicers, strips of
developed 16 mm film and bins stuffed with
film trimmings. Oh, and about 20 students.
I say hi to Matt, another friend from Stan
ford, who is re-editing a film that he directed,
"Dead Man's Coin." On the moviola
screen, a businessman notices a coin

standing on its side, picks it up and pockets it.
It turns out that the coin belonged to a home
less man he once ignored and brings with it a
curse. This homelessness theme is everywhere,
it seems.
Andrew takes me over to his partners who
are busily editing their film. He was the cine
matographer on this project, but within min
utes, he slips effortlessly into producer mode,
making picture editing and audio suggestions.
The actual producer, Michelle, is excited
about what they've got, but the sound isn't
working. "Let him listen to the end title
music," she tells the director, Garrett.
He offers me a pair of headphones. 1 put
them on, but Michelle wants to play it through
the speakers, which she does. Out comes a
wailing saxophone solo with an ominous hint
of piano beneath it. On the small moviola
screen, the credits roll by.
"Can you hear it?" Garrett says."The key
board underneath the sax makes it evil."
The next thing 1 know, I'm in a video edit
ing suite watching a videotaped copy of their
film. An abrasive, solitary puzzle-cutter
yes, that's his job — finds himself haunted by
a saxophone player who waxes (kiltrane-esque
right under his window. When the saxophon
ist refuses to stop playing, puzzle-man beats
him over the head with the instrument, drags

the corpse away and returns to his apart
ment.
But he continues to hear the music
playing. When he hears someone at the
door, he assumes that it's the police and
runs out onto his ledge, where he falls to
his death. The twist? Standing next to his
corpse is the saxophonist, with a bandaged
head and a new tenor in his hand. He takes his
hat off and holds it to his chest. Is it pity?
Irony? Fade to black.

It's pretty well made, but it's hard for me to
be objective about film noir lighting, which I
love. I ask Garrett whether it's a metaphor for
race relations in America, given that puzzle
man is white and the saxophonist is black. "1
hadn't thought about that interpretation," he
says. While he and Andrew discuss the rest of
the editing process, I entertain myself with
permutations of their story — a black puzzle
cutter might kill a white saxophonist, shouting
"Flvis was a hero to most / but he didn't mean
shit to me." Or the two of them could play
"Ebony and Ivory."
Los Angeles is starting to get to me.
Date: Friday, April 18, 1994
Time: 12:04 a.m.
Place: Sunset Boulevard
Andrew's been taking me on the grand tour
of the city of angels. So far, I've seen Mann's
Chinese Theater, The Hollywood Walk of
Fame, Beverly Hills and Rodeo Drive.
Now we're on Sunset Boulevard, and I'm
half expecting to see William Holden speeding

us on the lam, or to
hear Gloria Swanson shrieking "I'm ready tor
my close-up, Mr. DeMille" from the back of a
squad car. Or would that be Andrew Lloyd
Webber speeding away from a wild-eyed I'atti
LuFone shouting "I am big. It's the composers
that got small" from the top of her gilt-edged
staircase?
1 sit back, close my eyes and let my Tinsel
town fantasies run wild.
Date: Friday, April 18, 1994
Time: 11:28 a.m.
Place: Andrew's apartment
Alek Keshkishian, the director of "With
Honors," as well as "Truth or Dare" and
countless Madonna videos, calls me tor his in
terview. He's both affable and effusive — what
more can an aspiring writer ask tor?
We talk for 15 minutes, about why he made
the movie, Generation X, working with Joe
Pesci, working with up-and-coming actors,
working with Madonna and trying to keep
working. All-in-all, a pretty good interview.
Brendan Fraser, of "Fncino Man" fame, is a
completely different story. He doesn't seem to
want to talk and the fact that the questions are
coming off the top of my head doesn't help. 1 le
misinterprets my first question, doesn't re
spond to my casual name-dropping (an Ash
ley Judd anecdote about him and his relation
ship with the paparazzi), has little to say about
his critics and can barely muster the energy to
plug his next two movies — all in a barely au
dible whisper.
After 10 excruciating minutes, I decide to
put us both out of our mutual misery and

wrap up the interview. To make things worse,
the tape recorder I've hooked up to the phone
wasn't properly connected. The only voice I
can hear on the tape is my own.
I'll never eat lunch in this town again.

Place: Westwood, Los Angeles
I wasn't expecting much from these inter
views, hut the Brendan Fraser fiasco is getting
to me. I had visions of writing the definitive
Fraser story. From one line in "Dogfight" to
second-billing with loe Pesci. The next Olivi
er, Brando and Cruise wrapped in one tall,
sensitive frame. I would chronicle his rise from

obscu
rity to fame and
garner a Pulitzer in the
process.
But I've been denied. Like a piece of carrion
that wakes up and escapes from the vulture
circling over head, Fraser refused to cooperate.
Good-bye, Variety. Farewell, Pulitzer. I wallow
in my despair like a lukewarm bubble bath.
To cheer me up, Andrew and Matt take me
to see "Bad Girls" on opening night at a plush
LA. theater. It works, but not in the way we'd
intended. What was billed as a "Wild Bunch"
with women turns into "Hoes on the Range;"
a pseudo-feminist camp classic in the making.
Hopefully Gus van Sant's upcoming adapta
tion of "Even Cowgirls Get the Blues" will
eradicate all traces of this from my memory.
The three of us dissect its problems over
hamburgers and shakes, then call it a night.

I turn the story in to my editors, who hole
up in their offices to look it over. When they

Alan: Alan and I.
John: Whatever. This sucks.
Alan: Big time.
John: Where are the quotes?
Alan: Where is the Generation X analysis?
John: Where's the beef?
Alan: You can forget the San Francisco film
festival.

Alan: You'll never write on this campus

John: Ever.
Alan: And you can quote us on that.
Me: OK. ■
