# Until death do you part
## 'Four Weddings and a Funeral' features breezy bliss 
### 
"Four Weddings and a Funeral" shouldn't
be as satisfying as it is: it's got aimless scenes,
thin character sketches, and even an ill
placed funeral. But when writer Richard Cur
tis and director Mike Newell don't have to
worry about the meaning of it all, they find
inspired comedy in nuptial faux-pas.
Hugh Grant stars as Charles, an accused
"serial monogamist" in a circle of stereotypi
cally uptight British friends caught in a mar
ital flux. Andie MacDowell is Carrie, the
easygoing American journalist who steals his
heart. Charles and Carrie court each other
during a difficult year when everything
seems to explode: wedding receptions turn
ugly; a mysterious, perpetually cheerful
friend named Gareth dies; an apprentice
priest (played with zeal by Rowan Atkinson)
forgets his lines; Carrie weds a 70-year-old
man; Charles marries a harpy. In the end,
however, Charles and Carrie find each other.
Much of the trouble with "Four Wed
dings" is the undefined attraction between
Carrie and Charles. Many people are satisfied
with this ambiguity; one critic even wrote
that MacDowell infused her role with an "air
of mystery." It's an underwritten part which
creates this mystery.
The actual spark of the relationship be
tween Charles and Carrie is not so much de
scribed but rather suggested by way of hack
editing: in one aimless scene, Carrie mumbles
through a recollection of her 33 lovers while
Charles—apparently without a thing to do—
is left to tug at his nose and grin "quite right,"
or "excellent," in awe. The scene stretches on
unbearably. By the time Carrie reaches her
15th memory, even the music cues up. Noth
ing can provide the necessary resolution. Pre
cisely what is occupying Charles' attention?
The sketchy secondary characters provide
no answers. One is deaf, one is eccentric; many

are estranged; another
is infatuated; one is
wealthy; two are gay,
and that's it. The ex
cellent actors are left
with nothing mean
ing much. In one ex
ample, Kristin Scott
Thomas brings an
arch wit to her role as
Fifi — a woman with
an armored jeep and a
crush on Charles. But
Fifi soon disappears
— she's just another
pointless thread. The
filmmakers seem un
concerned with their
responsibilities to
these sub-plots.
And did the title
promise a funeral?
Halfway through the
film it arrives. It
seems like another
device in the screen
writer's bag of tricks:
not even a tear on
Charles' cheek or a

moving recital of W.H. Auden's "Funeral
Blues" can rescue the film from heavy-hand
ed soul-searching. A screwball comedy can't
really contain this kind of pathos, regardless
of the staging — the filmmakers would have
done better to treat death in farcical terms.
One example in recent memory, John
Cleese's "A Fish Called Wanda," skirted topics
of romance and death with great ease.
Perhaps "Four Weddings" seems patchy
because of the narrative limitations imposed
by a 90-minute romantic comedy. Screen
writer Richard Curtis is an inventive comic

stylist; his "Blackadder" television series
traced the biography of a fictitious historical
archetype — named Edmond Blackadder —
who traveled incarnate from the Dark Ages to
World War I.
These shows were especially successful be
cause they didn't require much continuity;
Curtis could write short sketches and use the
bulk of episodes to develop his characters. In
"Four Weddings" we find Curtis up to his
usual schtick — hopping between scads of
tiny plots — and then scurrying to tie things
up in the end.

For all its faults, "Four Weddings and a
Funeral" is nonetheless a breeze. The cast is a
terrific group; the supporting members, par
ticularly Thomas and John Hannah, serve
some personality, and even the chronically
flat MacDowell brings some warmth to her
narrow role. Many of the wedding vignettes
are nicely conceived, and director Mike
Newell brings a graceful silliness to the event.
I lis closing montage of marriage snapshots is
an evocative, if tried-and-true, means of stir
ring fond memory.
