### 
It's the classic love triangle with a '90s
twist: because of a bureaucratic screw-up,
college students Alex (Lara Flynn Boyle),
Eddie (Josh Charles) and Stuart (Stephen
Baldwin) find themselves living in the same
suite. Soon the sexual fireworks start flying.
Alex lusts after Eddie, Stuart is after Alex,
and Eddie, who describes himself as "sexual
ly ambivalent," is becoming attracted to Stu
art. In order to keep the situation under con
trol, the three friends make a solemn vow to
avoid any physical relationships with each
other. This established, they settle into an in
timate platonic friendship.

But theirs are un
easy friendships in
which everyone in
volved wishes the
situation were dif
ferent, where de
sires are buried in
stead of talked
about or acted on.
In short, something
has to give. And the
fun really starts
when something
does.

"Threesome" is more or less an entertain
ing movie. The complicated sexual situations
provide for lots of laughs, and the emotions
the characters feel should be familiar to
everyone. Its discussion of sex is far-reaching
and progressive, and the main characters
cheerfully and compassionately accept
Eddie's homosexuality. It's nice to see homo
sexuality discussed without stigma or fanfare.
But "Threesome" also has a disturbing
tendency to fall victim to negative and out
dated stereotypes. Alex is portrayed as a sex
starved nympho who is aroused by "big
words," experiencing an orgasm on a library
table while Eddie reads from Nathaniel
Hawthorne. It's a distasteful image, especial
ly for someone who's supposed to be an "in
tellectual."
And while the attitude towards homosex
uality is generally progressive, Eddie's sexu
ality is presented in a manner that reinforces
several stereotypes: an English major and
French cinema buff, Eddie lusts after his
avowedly straight roommate and even gets
him drunk in an attempt to seduce him.
"Threesome" is an entertaining film that
attempts to deal with big issues in a progres
sive way, but its efforts are unfortunately
hobbled by the same stereotypes it tries to es
cape.
