# Bad Girls
## 
### 
Westerns have never been a female-ori
ented film genre. If women appear at all, it is
usually to demonstrate the male protago
nist's heterosexuality or to provide a victim
in need of his help. "Bad Girls" challenges the
traditional male western by providing four
tough cowgirls who can ride, shoot and spit
with the best of them. But all the mythic he
roes of the West couldn't save this movie
from bad writing and sloppy editing.
The opening credits barely finish rolling
before our protagonists, a group of prosti
tutes played by Madeleine Stowe, Mary Stu
art Masterson, Andie MacDowell and Drew
Barrymore, flee from the law after killing one
of their saloon patrons. Lead by Cody
(Stowe), they decide to head for the Oregon
Territory to start a lumber business while
dodging the Pinkerton Detectives and Kid
Jarret and his gang of outlaws.
The film is so conscious of itself as the first
action Western featuring women protagonists
that it tries to cover every possible angle. The
characters are saddled with misplaced mono
logues on social inequality, discriminatory
property laws and the lack of economic op
portunities for women. These issues are never
thoroughly explored and they end up simply

interfering with the action. When Eileen
(MacDowcll) expounds on the role of barbed
wire fence in the taming of the West, the script
unintentionally borders on self-parody.
"Bad Girls" is director Jonathan Kaplan's
first attempt at a western and his inexperi
ence shows as he cribs scenes from all the old
classics of John Ford, Sam Peckinpah and
Sergio Leone. It's all here: laughing villains,
boozing Mexican henchmen, old vendettas
and high-noon showdowns. There is just too
much happening in this movie, and very lit
tle of it is relevant to the plot. The result is
simply a bad western.
"It was a dangerous time to be a woman,"
declare the trailers for "Bad Girls." In this
post-Oscar slump, it's also a dangerous time
to be a film-goer.
