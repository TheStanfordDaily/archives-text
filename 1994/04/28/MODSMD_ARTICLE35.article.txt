# It's a gas, gas, gas
## Helium lifts off with sterling debut, 'Pirate Prude' 
### 
If the music critics continue to hail Heli
um as the next big alternative-pop sensation,
they'll need to redefine the meaning of'pop."
Because the only thing "pop" about their
stunning six-song debut "Pirate Prude" is
that it's insanely catchy.
Well, there's also the matter of the trio's
lineage. For instance, they've emerged from
the famed Boston pop scene. Moreover, He
lium has gained a name opening for Pave
ment, Juliana Hatfield and other pop fa
vorites of the moment. Add in guitarist/vo
calist Mary Timony's previous involvement
in punk/pop outfit Autoclave and it's almost
enough evidence to implicate Helium as the
jingle-jangle stars of the near future.
Yet the real proof is in their music: while
there's no shame with the distinctions the
press has heaped upon them, the picture the
word "pop" evokes does not put together an
accurate picture of the "Helium sound."
Yes, with only one extended player and a
handful of seven inchers to their name, 1 leli
um exhibits its own unique sound. That He
lium sound centers around screeching guitar
work backed by a ponderous rhythm section.
Timony's whining guitar winds its way
around the primal percussion drummer
Shaun Devlin pounds out and the lead-heavy
grooves laid down by bassist Brian Dunton
with raw-edged intensity.
Even more striking than the beguiling in
strumental work is Timony's evocative voice.
On one hand, it allures with ethereal beauty;
on the other, it pierces with gloomy grit.
I lowever, Timony separates herself from the
ear-candy, "girlie-pop" crowd with her im
peccable delivery. Sometimes atonal, some
times arrhythmic, her voice always affect ing
ly emotes the anger and sorrow that are the
subjects of her "love songs."
I lowever, what brings these elements to-

gether and packs the
songs with punch are
Timony's powerful
lyrics. The music
compellingly repre
sents the despairing
tone Timony sets
with the words she
pens. In fact, the im
ages of vampires and
prostitution which
run through the de
structive relation
ships Timony nar
rates make Liz Phair's
empowering gender
politics seem almost
weak in comparison.
Take the excellent
first track of "Pirate
Prude," "Baby Vam
pire Made Me," as an
example of how these
pieces seamlessly fit
together. A tinkling of
guitar strings and a
heavy bass line leads

into Timony's ringing voice, calling out, "It
doesn't matter if it's wrong or right / You
won't remember after I bite." As the song picks
up with Devlin's marching drum beat, the din
thins out with a hissing guitar and pushes Ti
mony's terrifying lyricism into the spotlight;
the instrumentals move to the background
and she comes forward, chanting "You got a
skull, Baby I You got a spine / After I'm done
with you / I'll spit them out like rinds."
The dynamics continue to change as the
song progresses, going into sparse guitar in
terludes and fake endings. At the end of six
minutes, the songs grinds to a halt when Ti
mony smoothly fades away, singing, "You

can't live life if you're living death."
The rest of the HP follows the lead of
"Baby Vampire," combining chilling vocal
melodies with equally haunting instrumen
tal accompaniments. The collection's two
shortest pieces — "Wanna Be a Vampire Too,
Baby" and "I'll Get You, I Mean It" — work
as sparse change-ups to the longer epics,
compressing diffuse energy into a dense ball
of violence and pain.
Still, it's Helium's mastery of the six
minute warped-pop song which brings the
band to the forefront of the college music
scene. On "XXX" and "Lovesss," the trio as
toundingly maintains a dispirited intensity

throughout. Timony's voice floats resound
ingly over the raucous clamor of throbbing
rhythms and buzzing guitar. For instance,
when Timony dishearteningly wails, "You're
not an angel / You're just a person" on the
HP's final tune "Lx)vesss," the agony Timony
showcases through the six songs crashes lu
cently in dejection. When despair is so deli
ciously expressed, it's easy to go back over
and over again. Perhaps that's the pop power
Helium possesses.
Whatever you choose to call Helium's
craft, suffice it to say that "Pirate Prude" is
one of the best offerings of the year.
