After touring Japan and the United States
(including two stops at San Francisco's own
UNA Lounge), the Groove Collective has fi
nally released its long-awaited first album,
"Groove Collective." Three words: buy this
now. No CD, tape or vinyl (if you can find it)
collection will be complete without it.
From the album's first track, "Reritstrike," to
its final track "Saturday," "Groove Collective"
takes you on a trip back to New York, to the Me
tropolis Cafe, where the beginnings of this
group merged with Giant Step productions.

There arc no silent
spaces — "Groove
Collective" mixes one
song into the next.
You're never left high
and dry . . . only
thirsting for more of
its acid-jazz treats.
"Rahsaanasong"
and "Buddhahead"
are probably the

strongest songs on the album. The former
starts with the slow, ethereal melodies of
flutist Richard Worth, and then switches into
a fast, rhythmic drive. On a scale of one to 10,
this track scores a 10 for danceability. The lat
ter song, "Buddhahead," one of the two rap
vocals on "Groove Collective," meshes a jazz
hop style which stands out from the rest of the
hemp revival songs of the '90s. This too re
ceives a 10 for danceability.
In fact, the whole album gets accolades for
its high danceability rating. Sure, you could
sit, back, relax, perhaps toke up, masturbate
pick one, none or all of the above, it
doesn't matter. The final analysis reveals that
"Groove Collective" is designed for intimacy
— to make you feel as if you are there at l)N A
Lounge, or wherever. And that's precisely the
philosophy of the Groove Collective: to har
monize with the crowd for which it performs
and to bring its jazz straight to the people.
As the liner notes state: "The Groove Col
lective is music for the basement/stoop/ 1 iv
ing/ or dance floor, but bring grandma." I
would add: the bedroom, the bathroom, the
kitchen... just buy the album and it will take
you anywhere you want to go.
