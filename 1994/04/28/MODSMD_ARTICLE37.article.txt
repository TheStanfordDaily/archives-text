# "Riddles are abound tonight" Sausage
## 
### 
lake equal parts Primus, Charlie Hunter
Trio, gifted new Bay Area band Porch, and
throw them all into a basement with some
recording equipment. What do you get?
Sausage, naturally.
Recorded and produced by l,cs Claypool,
the virtuoso bassist of Primus fame (who also
plays on the album), Sausage's "Riddles are
Abound Tonight" is among the strangest and
yet most listenable examples of pop music
currently out there. With Claypool doing vo
cals and bass, one might expect Sausage to
sound like some pale imitation of "thrash
funk" great Primus, but Sausage has forged a
sound all its own, and it is far from pale.
A fair amount of the emphasis here is on
guitar, which is powerful despite (or maybe
because of) the fact that it isn't fortified by
12 tracks of the same part — most of the
time, just one track is enough. Todd Huth,
currently of Porch, has a particular talent
for juxtaposing bizarre sounds — a sud

den move from heavy distortion power
chords to mournful, high-pitched slide in
flections seems perfectly appropriate —
and it's Huth's uneasy but compelling lines
that bring such distinctive feel to the
record.
"Riddles" instills the listener with feelings
of creepiness and merriment, and after a lis
tening, it's hard to decide whether to laugh
out loud or check your closet. "Girls for Sin
gle Men," Sausage's poke at porn, ranks as
the most unsettling track on the disc. Huth
lays distant, hollow-sounding guitar-chords
over variations on a single, jumpy bass riff,
while Claypool chants the title in a carnival
barker's voice.
"Here's to the Man," a sly rail against guns
and those that advocate them, includes a de
scription of a game of cops and robbers,
taken to its violent extreme by Johnny, who
decides to use his father's gun to play. "Rid
dles are Abound Tonight" is beautifully un
nerving, and while Sausage's craft may never
see top-40 radio play, it certainly has the po
tential to become a cult favorite — the
"Eraserhead" of the alternative music scene,
if you will.
