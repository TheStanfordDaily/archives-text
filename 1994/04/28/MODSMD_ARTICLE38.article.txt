# Unchained salsa
## Celia's offers unique taste and individual flair 
### Alison Amend 
If you're like me, you're tired of
chains. Tired of the work that
chains you to your desk. Tired of
the U-lock that chains your bike to
the rack. And now you're hungry,
but you're fed up with the cheesy
familiarity of chain restaurants.
Well, there's always Celia's. Lo
cated right on University, Celia's of
fers real Mexican fare that's a fairly
inexpensive alternative to Miyake.
While it lacks the glamour of, say,
Compadres, the food is much bet
ter, and — dare I say it — much
more authentic.
The decor is vintage Mexican
restaurant: pictures on the wall of
the owner in a large sombrero with a
donkey, brightly colored crepe
paper streamers and occasionally, a
pinata.
The chips came quickly and

were warm, but not too salty, which
is my personal pet peeve. The salsa
was refreshingly spicy — the kind
that requires Kleenex, but not the
eye-watering, brain-splitting sort.
The menu is extensive, but, ex
cept for a few California-Mexican
concessions, has nothing for the
non-Mexican food lover, so leave
the rabbit-food eater at home. It
does, however, offer standard Mex
ican fare such as taco salad, fajitas,
enchiladas, flautas, quesadillas,
chimichangas and every combina
tion thereof you could possibly de
sire.
The waiter was attentive, if hur
ried, and seemed flattered I ordered
in Spanish. He was happy to substi
tute chicken instead of beef in my so
pita, and courteously taught me how
to say "Diet Coke" in Spanish (coca

dietetica). My companion ordered
taco salad, and we sat back to devour
chips while waiting for our entrees.
The atmosphere was certainly
less yuppie than most dining estab
lishments in Palo Alto. Happily, the
sound of Spanish wafted toward us,
which is always encouraging in a
Mexican restaurant.
But before we could finish dis
cussing this week's episode of "Mel
rose Place," the plates arrived, pip
ing hot. The sopitas, which, though
the name means literally "little
soups," turned out to be a cornmeal
shell filled with chicken and cheese,
covered in red sauce, and sprinkled
liberally with shredded lettuce. A
discouragingly skimpy amount of
guacamole crowned the dish.
My companion's salad came in a
tortilla bowl, with a great amount

of cheese, much to
her delight. The
chicken was tender,
and the cornmeal
shell gave texture to
the dish.
The bill came to $ 17
for the two of us. A little
high, but better than the
alternative restaurants
on University. Entrees
were each between $7
and $8, with Cokes
about $1 each. The meal
was quick; it took us less
than 45 minutes to eat
Celia's, then,

emerges as an interesting break
from the Compadre's/Chevy's
chain gang circuit. It's closer, indi
vidual and has a much more au
thentic flavor than its anglicized

Recommendation: If you're looking for
Mexican food with a personal touch, try
Celia's right down University. Warm chips,
an extensive menu and a laid-back atmos
phere gives Celia's a nod over the assem
bly-line fare at Chevy's.

talk over dinner, or a let-down
your-hair, giggly dining experience,
Celia's delivers the Mexican food
you've been craving. ■
