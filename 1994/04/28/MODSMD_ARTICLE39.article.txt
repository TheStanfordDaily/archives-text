Backßeat
"Backßeat" is a Beatle movie even
the most fickle fan will enjoy. De
spite a few historical inaccuracies,
director lain Softley does an ad
mirable job of reconstructing the
band's early days in Hamburg when
the Fab Four was the Fab Five. Of
note are the live music scenes
which capture what it must have
been like to see the Beatles before
they got big. R
Belle Epoque
In the tradition of critically-ac
claimed, innocuous, little-known
European movies comes Spanish
director Fernando Trueba's "Belle
Epoque." But don't let the hype of a
Best Foreign Film Oscar fool you:
the story of four farmer's daughters
and a Spanish army deserter serves
up sizzling sex scenes but little his
torical or political content. In
essence, 1993's winner proves to
be nothing more than a dressed-up
Penthouse Forum letter. R
Bitter Moon
Roman Polanski is back with a fan
tastic yet disturbing sexuality moral

ity tale that takes us into the lives of
a couple on the verge of sexual
breakdown. The setting: a cruise
ship; the purpose: restore vitality to
Oscar's (Peter Coyote) and Mimi's
(Emmanuelle Seigner) relationship.
Only Oscar and Mimi have yet to
learn that razors, urine and farm ani
mals do not a healthy sexual rela
tionship make. A powerful film that
explores the dangerous territory of
the finitude of passion and attrac
tion. R
The House of the Spirits
In a poor imitation of a fantastic, fan
tastical novel, an über-cast of Jere
my Irons, Glenn Close, Winona
Ryder and Meryl Streep can't seem
to capture any of the sentiment of
the original text, based on author Is
abelle Allende's own life and up
bringing in Chile. It's a long, some
what painful and tragic corruption of
the novel; save your $7 and buy the
book! R
The Hudsucker Proxy
The Coen brother duo who brought
you the cult hits, "Raising Arizona"
and "Barton Fink" are back with a

slightly less engaging, slightly more
corny flick. A mailroom employee of
a big toy company gets promoted to
the top when the boss dies, but his
invention of the hula-hoop proves
too promising for the main manipu
lator who wants Hudsucker Indus
tries to fail. But even though it's a
cold, simple morality tale, it's got
Tim Robbins and Paul Newman, so
it can't be all bad PG
Major League II
If you're looking for a little comedy
with your baseball fun, you won't
find it in "Major League II." The se
quel proves to be a boring rehash
ing of the original, just on a slightly
larger scale: the hapless Cleveland
Indians win an American League
pennant rather than a meie division
championship. Just about nothing
in the flick works, except maybe Bob
Uecker's reprisal of a his quick-wit
ted commentator role — if that's re
ally a plus. PG
The Paper
As they say in the newspaper biz,
"The Paper" is Page One material.
Director Ron Howard ably guides a

star-studded cast through a day at
the presses to realistic lengths. And
while some of it may seem melodra
matic or overacted, the theatrics of
the newsroom staff at the fictitious
New York Sun play true to life. R
Serial Mom
Kathleen Turner is evidently having
fun playing the part of a psycho
everything-is-not-dandy-a-la-Nor-
man-Rockwell Serial Mom in this
new, well endowed John Waters
flick. It's a parody of suburban
America (typical Waters fare) with an
added bonus of a "Basic Instinct"
style court room gag. While not alto
gether a phenomenal work, it's
worth seeing. R
Sirens
If you've walked down University in
the last couple of weeks, you've
probably seen the marquee blaring
"Sirens: Be seduced." And the movie
delivers on that promise, alluring
viewers with its surreal, witty, erotic
and original story on the life of Aus
tralian painter Norman Lindsay. In
essence, "Sirens" proves to be an
"art film" in every sense of the term R
