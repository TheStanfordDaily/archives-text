# Earthquake repairs get $5M boost from Bings

The Stanford Restoration Fund has re
ceived a $5 million gift from Helen and
Peter Bing of Los Angeles, kicking off its
campaign to raise $50 million to repair
damages caused by the 1989 Loma Prieta
earthquake.

Approved earlier this month by Stan
ford's Board of Trustees, the fund will be
used to restore campus buildings, includ
ing the West Wing of Green Library, the
Geology and Language Corners of the
Inner Quad, and the Stanford Museum of
Art. In addition, the fund will be used to
retrofit and seismically brace numerous
other buildings in preparation for future
quakes.

The Bings' donation, however, will be
specifically devoted to the repair of Green's
West Wing, which has been closed to stu
dents and faculty since the quake. Accord
ing to Dave Glen, the director of principal
gifts, the Bings' motivation was two-fold.
"The Bings realize that the University
really needs (the West Wing of Green) li
brary," he said. "But also Dr. Bingand Mr.
Green are close friends and admirers of
each other. I think Dr. Bing just wanted to
do whatever he could to help."
Since Peter Bing's graduation from
Stanford in 1955, he and his wife have
made numerous contributions to the Uni
versity. He has also served as a trustee. Ac
cording to Glen, the couple have always
hoped that their generosity would
benefit the entire community.
"If you look at the history of
their giving," he said, "you'll find
that a common thread is to make
people's lives better, often times
faculty, often times students."
The Bings' gift is the largest
donation to the West Wing pro
ject. However, former trustee
Melvin B. Lane and his wife Joan
contributed to the project last
year, as did another former
trustee who chooses to remain

anonymous. Currently, about $8
million more in funds are neces
sary to complete Green's recon
struction.
Having received approxi
mately $38.5 million from the
Federal Emergency Manage
ment Agency for restoration of
242 earthquake-damaged build
ings, Stanford is presently
attempting to make up the rest
of the projected $168 million
cost through private donations.
According to Jack Hickethier,
Stanford's acting director of
major gifts, he and his staff are
currently seeking out donors
who would be most likely to
have a particular interest in a

specific project.
"At this point it's not what you
would call a broad-based effort
where information is being sent
out to all alumni," he said. "We're
focusing on people who we think
will be most interested in help
ing."
Nonetheless, Hickethier
emphasized that the campaign
will be broadened in months to
come, so as to give all alumni "the
opportunity to help invest in their
old campus."
Although a specific date has
not been set, Hickethier expects
the fund to reach its $50 million
goal within the next 12 to 18
months.
