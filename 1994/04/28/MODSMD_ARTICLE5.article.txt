### September Trevino Staff writer 
"Stripping down" the anti-gay polity in the mili
tary was the primary focus of a lecture given in honor
of Bisexual Gay Lesbian Awareness Days (BGLAD)
1994 — a program which began last week and contin
ues through tomorrow.
Allan Berube, historian and author of the award
winning book "Coming Out Under Fire: The History
of Gay Men and Women in World War II," lectured
last night in Campbell Recital Hall, focusing on mili
tary policy concerning gays in the post-world war
era.
Berube began the talk by describing his experi
ences as he underwent a physical examination and
answered required questionnaires for the draft dur
ing the Vietnam War.
"The question that made my heart pound was this:
Have you ever had any homosexual tendencies or ex
periences?" he said. "At the time, I never questioned
why the military wanted to know .. . why didn't they
want gays in the armed forces?"
Berube now spends his time probing this very
question and "uncovering the
military's secrets, examining
them as they examined my body
and psyche so many years ago,"
he said.
Berube said he wanted to tell
the hidden stories of lesbians and
gays in the military, ultimately
exposing the myths surrounding
homosexuals in the armed
forces.
"There are many myths that I
could debunk: the myth that the
military doesn't want homosexu
als, when it has always wanted
them, but wanted them invisible,"
said Berube.
While recognizing that lifting
the ban on gays in the military is
an important civil rights struggle,
Berube said that the military's
current policy entails more than a
violation of rights.
"The military's anti-gay ban is
much worse than discrimination.
It is rather a sophisticated system
of domination based on sexual
identity," he said.
Berube added that this domi
nation is connected to the position
of heterosexual masculinity and
illustrates the lengths to which
those in power must go to retain
their position.
According to Berube, approxi
mately 100,000 gays and lesbians
have been discharged from the
military since the end of World
War 11.
He added that the Clinton
Administration's "don't ask, don't

tell" policy has not substantially
reduced the number of people dis
charged as a result of their sexual
orientation.
A sophomore attending the

speech said, "I think it was proba
bly one of the most valuable pro
grams for the queer community
on the subject of political strategy
and organization."
