## Columnist enumerates media's responsibilities 
### Emily Bazar Staff writer 
The Chicago Tribune hired its second full-time
African-American reporter in 1969. The paper
had reservations over employing a black man who
seemed too militant, but decided to give Clarence
Page a chance.
Page — a Pulitzer Prize-winning syndicated
columnist — said in a speech last night in Kresge
Auditorium that the media has changed since his
arrival at the Tribune. Although today's press
room is more integrated than before, that same
pressroom distorts media images of minorities
and the poor.
"Most often, the media distorts life for those
who matter the least — the 'poor folks,' " said
Page.
Page said he first recognized the media's
power to shape national interests during the civil
rights struggle in the 19605. As a child living in
Ohio, he said he felt far away from blatant South
ern racism.
