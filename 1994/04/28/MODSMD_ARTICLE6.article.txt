## Columnist enumerates media's responsibilities 
### Emily Bazar Staff writer 
The Chicago Tribune hired its second full-time
African-American reporter in 1969. The paper
had reservations over employing a black man who
seemed too militant, but decided to give Clarence
Page a chance.
Page — a Pulitzer Prize-winning syndicated
columnist — said in a speech last night in Kresge
Auditorium that the media has changed since his
arrival at the Tribune. Although today's press
room is more integrated than before, that same
pressroom distorts media images of minorities
and the poor.
"Most often, the media distorts life for those
who matter the least — the 'poor folks,' " said
Page.
Page said he first recognized the media's
power to shape national interests during the civil
rights struggle in the 19605. As a child living in
Ohio, he said he felt far away from blatant South
ern racism.

only people victimized by this dis
cussion. A lot of black youngsters
think that white America is pre
dominantly Jewish."
He went on to identify what he
said were other ways the media
tends to distort reality. For
instance, Page said that the media
suffers from the "Rolodex syn
drome."

Page said he initially experi
enced overt segregation during a
trip to the South. "The first time I
saw the word 'Colored' on a sign
for a water fountain, I ran to the
colored water fountain and turned
it on. I was disappointed that the
water was clear and not colored,"
he said.
The civil rights triumph over
open segregation in the South and
subtle racism in the North was
largely due to the media because it
helped people experience what they
otherwise would not, Page said.
"The media had immense power
bringing this message to people's
homes," he said. "How much
longer would it have taken to get
those kinds of changes had there
not been the media, especially the
television?"
Despite its benefits, Page said
the media also contributes to soci
ety's ills. "One problem is that we,
the media, tend to distort reality,"
he said.
Page said the media has rein
forced stereotypes rather than try
ing to block them out. For example,
he said, although only one-third of
African-Americans live below the
poverty level, people are led to
believe that the number is much
higher because of skewed media cov
erage.
But Page added, "We're not the

"The media eye is quite myopic
and only focuses itself on one
spokesman for certain subjects all
of the time," he said, adding that
constant exposure to certain points
of view, like that of Rush Lim
baugh, establishes and feeds
stereotypes.
Page also said the media is a vic
tim of the "proximity syndrome,"
which leads to a situation in which
news is what happens near the
news editor's home.
According to Page, drug stories
are good examples of the proximity
syndrome. He pointed out that 72
percent of cocaine is purchased by
whites, while most TV stations are
in or near the inner city where
blacks and Latinos are the predom
inant drug dealers. Consequently,
Americans see what TV cameras
have access to.

"Images distort our perception
of the drug problem. It's an Ameri
can problem, not a black or His
panic or urban or poverty prob
lem," said Page.
Citing other syndromes, Page
said the media can really affect
public sentiment and beliefs. He
added, "We in the media have a
great responsibility to help Ameri-

cans get along."
He said the media could achieve
this by opening and establishing
dialogues, "putting the reader onto
the scene more often than we do."
Page also suggested surpassing
what he calls the "P.C." — the
politeness conspiracy. He said that
news should be honest, put into
context, and be readable without
talking down to readers.
Page added that the media
needs to be more vigilant but that
people should take the time to
write and to care.
Page appears regularly on "The
McLaughlin Group," the "Mac-
Neil/Lehrer News Hour" and
National Public Radio. His speech
was sponsored by the Office of
Residential Education and was the
inaugural Charles F. Riddell Lec
ture.
