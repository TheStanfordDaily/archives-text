A Palo Alto resident died when his car ran

the accident. Paramedics pronounced him
dead at the scene, according to Officer Clifford
Wilkerson of the California Highway Patrol.
The Santa Clara County Coroner is still
looking for the victim's next of kin before

said. However, Stanford Police Sgt. .John
McMullen confirmed that the victim had no
known affiliation with the University.
Highway Patrol officers said the victim,
who was in his 40s, was not wearing his seat

belt at the time of the accident.

traveling north on the road at roughly 45 to
50 miles per hour before it went into the
shoulder, a witness told police. After driving
off the road near Santa Maria Avenue, the
car "struck a tree dead center," breaking
through three 8-inch tree trunks, Wilkerson
said. The car traveled another 60 feet before
coming to a stop.
The car's hood was crushed and the wind
shield shattered on impact. The victim suf
fered substantial trauma to the lower part of
his body, as well as a head injury.
The witness told police that he did not ob
serve any braking or slowing of the vehicle
when it wont off the road, Wilkerson said.
