## S. African students discuss the election in their homeland 
### Nick Kuritzky Staff' writer 
South African Stanford stu
dents, like most of their fellow citi
zens, headed to the polls this week
to vote in the country's first free
election in 342 years.
Polling stations were set up in
San Francisco, Oakland and four
other California cities to serve the
state's estimated 20,000 South
Africans. Any person over 18 who
could provide documentation of a
South African birthplace was eligi
ble to vote.
Ihron Rensburg, a doctoral stu
dent in education, was one of a
handful of Stanford students —
both black and white — who drove
to the Oakland polling station.
For Rensburg, a long-time
member of the African National
Congress, voting was an emotion
ally charged experience, a
step in the struggle for equality in
South Africa.
"This was a roller coaster week
for me," Rensburg said, "There
were moments of great excitement,
liberation and freedom, tempered
with pain and deep emotions for
the colleagues I have lost."
Rensburg, an ANC activist in
the Eastern Cape region, was de
tained and imprisoned between
1986 and 1989, although no
charges were ever filed against him.
During his three and a half years in
prison, Rensburg said, he was tor
tured by police and placed in soli
tary confinement for 11 months.
Yet in a testament to the spirit
of hope and reconciliation sweep
ing South Africa, Rensburg said he
harbors no bitterness towards his
former jailers, referring to them as
"agents of history ."
"I have no feelings of hatred,"
Rensburgsaid. "Hut apartheid must
not be forgotten, just as one would
not forget slavery or the Holocaust.
It is an icon of history that I will
invoke for self-reflection."
Also present at the Oakland
voting station were sophomores

Lungelo Nomvalo and Motlatsi
Mokoena.
Nomvalo, who declared that "I
wouldn't miss anything in the
world to vote," stressed that his
vote was not just a mechanical act
of suffrage but also "about honor
ing fallen heroes and affirming a
commitment to all South Africans
to work for a better future."
Mokoena echoed this senti
ment, but cautioned that "This is
just the beginning. The struggle

for running water, electricity and
education continues."
Rensberg, Nomvalo and Mokoe
na all said they would return to
South Africa to aid in the country's
development after they complete
their studies at Stanford.
Rensburg has already worked
closely with Nelson Mandela to for
mulate an educational policy and
said he expects to play a senior role
in the country's future educational
system.
