that, as a student, you probably dont have a whole lot of money available to spend on a new car. But
you probably need wheels. That's why we're offering a deal that's available only to soon-to-be graduates, or graduates
who have been out of school less than a year. With a low down payment, you could drive away in a 1994 Acura Integra
Sports Coupe or Sports Sedan. And it's easy to qualify. Generally, all you need is proof of employment and no adverse

income begins to catch up to what you're really worth. SOMETHINGS ARE WOMH THE PRICE ACURA
