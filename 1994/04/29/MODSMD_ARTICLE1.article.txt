## 
### Jim Luh Staff writer 
Tower Records and the Where
house may soon be battlingan un
likely competitor — the ASSU,
which has awarded a $5,970 en
trepreneurial grant to a student
who proposed a new and used
compact disc store.
Junior Jason Garoutte will
manage the CD exchange, which
will be located on the second floor
of Tresidder Union above the Cof
fee House. The ASSU will make
final preparations this quarter,
and the business is set to open in
September.
"We're very optimistic about
an exciting new project," said
ASSU Financial Manager Brian
Hillger.
The entrepreneurial grant
program was started by the
Council of Presidents and was ap
proved by the ASSU Senate last
November. The ASSU received
25 applications in all, and a board
consisting of two senators, COP
member Jason Snyder, a Gradu
ate School of Business student,
an undergraduate and others se
lected the winner.
Garoutte's CD exchange was
selected from a list of eight final
ists, which included a video-dat
ing service, a silk-screening busi
ness, a record label, an entertain
ment center and a party lighting
service.
"We did have to turn down a
lot of ideas that we . . . felt were
good," Hillger said.
Garoutte said he has high
hopes for the CD exchange. In ad
dition to carrying used CDs,
Garmitte said, the store will hope
fully stock a selection of new CDs
"at prices less than what you
would find at Tower" and also
some related products, such as
headphones and CD cleaners.
"I'd like to carry things that
would kind of round out the
store's image," Garoutte said.
"It's going to be a fun place for
students to go to."
The allocated funds will cover
startup costs, including an in
store sound system and site en
hancement.
Also included in that sum is
$2,000 to buy the inventory and
equipment of the CD XChange, a
used CD retailer that formerly
operated in front of the Book
store.
The owners of the CD
XChange, Ryan Floyd, Peter Fen
ton, Ty Olson, and Seth Spalding,
had also submitted a proposal to
the ASSU and were selected as
finalists, but the grant board
eventually decided that Garoutte
would manage the ASSU CD
exchange.
Spalding said he and his part
ners were pleased with the final
settlement and were happy to

have managed the CD XChange
for a short time.
"It was a good learning experi
ence," Spalding said. "It's good
that we . .. left our mark on Stan
ford."
Hillger said the grant board
decided to buy out the CD
XChange because it did not want
to send a discouraging message to
student entrepreneurs.
"We did not want to start a
competing business to compete

with students who are
entrepreneurs," Hillgersaid. Sny
der termed the relationship
between the new store and CI)
XChange a "partnership"
He added that the future of the
grant program "is unsure. It's
hard to start up a business every
year," he said. "My guess is that
the program will resurface a year
from now. I think it's one of the
best ways to go about starting up
a student business."
