I'LO, Israel io sign pact
CAIRO, Egypt (AP) â€” A historic
accord to launch Palestinian self-rule on
land held by Israel is due to be signed
Wednesday if a few remaining sticky dis
putes can be settled.
For the Palestinians it will be the first
step toward what many hope will be a
state. For Israel it is a chance to end
bloody conflict between two peoples who
claim the same land.
"It's the end of a long voyage and the
beginning of a new chapter in relations
between the Palestinian people and our
selves," said Israel's foreign minister,
Shimon Peres, long an advocate of concil
iation toward the Arabs on all fronts.
The date was set by Egyptian Presi
dent Hosni Mubarak, who played a piv
otal role in the breakthrough, even as

Secretary of State Warren Christopher
abandoned a passive U.S. stance to help
Peres and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat
narrow their differences.
Social Security simplified
WASHINGTON (AP) - The House
Ways and Means Committee voted yester
day to update and simplify rules on the
Social Security taxes that many household
employers have neglected to pay on their
yard workers, nannies and housekeepers.
Although the failure to pay those
taxes cost several prominent candidates
jobs in the Clinton administration,
including Zoe Baird who had been chosen
to be attorney general, many more losers
are among the thousands of domestic
workers who will not have Social Securi
ty benefits when they retire.
