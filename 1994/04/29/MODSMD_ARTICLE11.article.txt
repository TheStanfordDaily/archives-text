# Russian spy to serve life sentence
## Aldrich Ames says he received $2.5 million for U.S. secrets 
### 
ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) - Aldrich
Ames, the highest-paid and highest
ranking Russian spy ever caught
inside the CIA, was sentenced to life in
prison without parole yesterday in
what a prosecutor called "the most
damaging spy case in the history of
this country."
Ames, 52, pleaded guilty without a
trial and admitted being paid $2.5 mil
lion by the Soviet Union and then Rus
sia since April 1985 for U.S. secrets.
Once head of counterintelligence in t he
ClA's Soviet-East Europe section, Ames
admitted disclosing the identities of 10
Russian officials and one East Euro
pean who were spying for the United
States or Great Britain.
Prosecutors said at least four Soviet
KGB or GRU (military intelligence)
agents among the 11 were executed.

U.S. Attorney Helen Eahey told a news
conference, "He traded people's lives for
$2.5 million."
Ames said he never learned the fate
of those he betrayed. But reading his
first public statement since his Feb. 21
arrest, Ames expressed "deepest sympa
thy" for those "who may have suffered
from my actions."
Professing "profound shame and
guilt" for "this betrayal of trust, done
for the basest motives," money to pay
debts, Ames nevertheless said he did not
believe he had "noticeably damaged"
the United States or "noticeably aided"
Moscow.
"These spy wars are a sideshow
which have had no real impact on our
significant security interests over the
years," he told the court in a matter-of
fact tone.

But the prosecutors said in court
papers, "Ames' compromise of these
penetrations of the Soviet military and
intelligence services deprived the
United States of extremely valuable
intelligence material for years to
come."
Ames' wife, Rosario, 41, also pleaded
guilty to conspiring to commit espi
onage and evade income taxes, but the
government said she aided and support
ed her husband's treachery without
ever handling or transmitting secrets to
the Russians.
U.S. District Judge Claude Hilton
deferred her sentencing until Aug. 26 so
the government has time to see whether
Ames fulfills his agreement to tell inves
tigators everything he disclosed, how he
operated and any help he may have
received.
