## Editorials RA Draw dilemma 
### 
FOR MANY STUDENTS, the
Draw will a big source of
stress as they try to find
roommates and haggle over hous
ing preferences for the next two
weeks.
However, a select group of upper
classmen will have an added worry
as the May 11 housing lottery dead
line nears — their resident assis
tant applications.
According to the Office of Resi
dential Education, about 250 appli
cants are still in the running for the
168 RA positions in dorms and
houses. Today is the deadline for
turning in their list of preferences;
their assignments — or rejections
— will be available next Friday.
Problem is, the Draw — which is
on-line for the first time this year —
will have been open for nearly two
weeks when RA applicants find out
if they have received an appoint
ment. By that time, the open hous
es will have passed, special priori
ties will have been given out and
many students will have joined a
draw group and may have even

already entered the Draw.
For the 70 or so upperclassmen
who hoped to be RAs but were
denied, the five days before the
Draw ends May 11 will probably be
tense. Most students find it difficult
to plan ahead in anything; consider
ing the nature of the Draw itself,
finding someone to live with at the
last minute can be difficult and
emotionally draining.
Quite simply, RA applicants
should not be punished for trying,
which is the unintended conse
quence of the current system. In the
future, Res Ed should consider mov
ing deadlines up a few weeks so the
overlap between the RA application
period and the Draw is minimal.
Currently, potential RAs turn in
their applications April 1. Although
moving back the deadline would
make the last weeks of winter quar
ter even busier, it would be a nice
gesture for applicants.
Being an RA is challenging
enough once the job starts — there's
no reason to make the business of
becoming one even more difficult.
