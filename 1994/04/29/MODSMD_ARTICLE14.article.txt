# Committee power

### 
HEY STUDENTS! Do you
disagree with the proposed
changes to Stanford's grad
ing policy? Are you interested in
Tresidder changes? Do you want
your ideas on laboratory animal
care to be heard?
While writing letters, calling
meetings and rallying in White
Plaza are all perfectly good ways to
influence policy on campus, anyone
who has been at Stanford for a while
knows a great majority of power lies
in one place: committees.
The ASSU is now accepting appli
cations for student representatives
to all University committees. People
are needed to represent the opinions
of students on topics such as Resi
dential Education, financial aid and
admissions, distribution require
ments, overseas studies, graduate
housing, athletics and more.
Applying to serve on a committee
is surprisingly easy; submit your

resume along with a one-page form
and you're on your way to power
and, hopefully, a better environ
ment for all students on campus.
But hurry, the deadline is Monday.
Of course, getting students to
apply is just a start. This year the
ASSU did a poor job of using student
committee members as information
sources. The student body was never
informed properly as to who was
appointed to which committee, and
no useful system for contacting these
representatives was ever devised.
Furthermore, student represen
tatives never adequately reported to
their constituents, i.e. students, as
to what decisions were being made
within their committees.
On a campus where more deci
sions seem to be made behind closed
doors, and power seems to be
increasingly concentrated in the
hands of a few people, it's important
that students' voices be heard.
