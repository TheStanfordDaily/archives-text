## Matthew Shaggy Mizel A
						public challenge to President Casper 
### 
THE NEED for budget cuts is a
sham created by the administra
tion. It has created this myth so
University President Gerhard Casper
and Provost Condoleezza Rice can
redesign Stanford according to their
vision without involving students in deci
sion-making. Supporting evidence is sur
prisingly easy to find, even though Rice
and her staff* have denied students access
to a line-item Operating Budget.
On page i of the (Stanford University
Operating Budget Guidelines) 1993-94,
former Provost Gerald J. Lieberman stat
ed that the endowment payout rate was
raised from 4.75 percent to 6.75 percent
for the 1992-93 and the 1993-94 fiscal
years in order to help balance the Operat
ing Budget. The endowment payout rate
is the yield from endowment investments
that funds the Operating Budget.
According to the information on page
17 of the 1992-93 Stanford University
Annual Financial Report, the nominal
endowment return, or yield, for 1992-93
was 19.0 percent. Since the payout rate
was 6.75 percent, the remaining yield of
12.25 percent was added to the endow
ment. Stanford calculated inflation for
that year to be 2.6 percent, so the endow
ment actually grew by 9.65 percent after
inflation.
In the beginning of the 1992-93 fiscal
year, the university's endowment was
$2,434,584,000, and it yielded
$449,789,000. Of the yield, $141,383,000

funded the budget and $308,406,000 was
reinvested in the endowment (Annual
Financial Report, pages 16, 20).
The increase of the rate to 6.75 per
cent for 1992-93 and 1993-94 resulted in
an additional $26 million in the Operat
ing Budget during each year. For 1994-
95, Casper and Rice plan to set the
endowment payout rate at 5.25 percent.
Even though the administration can
claim victory by calling this a half-per
cent raise from the old rate (4.75 per
cent), this still results in approximately
$20 million less income for the Operating
Budget (Budget Guidelines, pages 7, 10).
Interestingly, they have stated that
between $10 and $20 million needs to be
cut from the budget because of a "lack of
funds." Thus, cuts are "necessary"
because Casper and Rice are using less of
the endowment yield to fund the Operat
ing Budget.
As much as I would like to think they
are acting in Stanford's best interests,
the numbers do not support this belief.
During the past 10 years, the average
endowment return for Stanford has been
14.4 percent. If the endowment contin
ues to perform at this same pace, which is
a reasonable prediction based on the
state of the economy and Stanford's his
tory of highly successful investment, the
endowment would still grow even if the
payout rate were higher than 5.25 per
cent.
If the payout rate were set at 6.25 per

cent, it would provide $13 million more to
the Operating Budget than the 5.25 per
cent rate, eliminating the "deficit." Stan
ford would still be able to reinvest 8.15
percent into the endowment.
Estimating inflation to be 3.6 percent
(the average for the last ten years) the
endowment would grow by 4.55 percent
after inflation. Even if the economy had a
poor year, the endowment would still
meet Stanford's goal of 2 percent growth
(Annual Financial Report, page 17).
Thus, Casper and Rice's decision to set
the payout rate at 5.25 percent does not
follow even conservative planning
because it unnecessarily sacrifices the
present well-being of Stanford.
It is obviously wiser to set the payout
rate as low as possible in order to maxi
mize endowment growth. BuM-bra cnoice"
must be cbnsidered in light df the $66
million in Operating Budget cuts since
1990 that have debilitated Stanford
(Operating Budget Guidelines, 1992-93,
page 5).
Since the endowment payout rate
could be set at 6.25 percent and gradual
ly lowered as other sources of income
increased, I believe Casper and Rice's
motivation to set the rate at 5.25 percent
is to create a budget deficit to use as jus
tification to re-design Stanford based on
their agenda alone.
