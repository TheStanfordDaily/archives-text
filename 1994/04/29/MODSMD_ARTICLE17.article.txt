## KZSU should become Stanford station, play better music 
### 
KZSU IS A non-commercial station
which must consider the varied
musical tastes of non-Stanford,
Bay Area listeners.
Fine. Stanford students have diverse
musical tastes. Surely a station popular
on campus would be acceptable to at
least as much of the Bay Area "commu
nity of 3 million" that seems to listen
to it right now. Clayton Glad, KZSU
program director, admitted in his letter
April 27 that few Stanford students
know much about KZSU's music. Judg
ing by the apparent low volume of calls
to the station, I wonder how many
non-Stanford people are listening,
either.
"We try to play as wide a variety of
music as we can, paying
particular attention to what's not
heard on other radio stations," wrote
Glad. Focusing on music that no one

else plays is not the widest possible
variety, but a considerable narrowing
of options.
And while KZSU's spring schedule
covers a (limited) range of genres, the
most common sound seems to be a loud
electric thrashing. Alternative, indus
trial, metallic, punk, "brutal," "convo
luted," "infernal," "scratchy," "trashy"
— to my ear this is variety only in
name, not in sound. Rather than blame
the small size of the student audience
entirely on a lack of publicity, Glad
should note KZSU's reputation for
playing obscure, grating noise. This
reputation has been vindicated almost
every time I've tuned in, so I don't lis
ten, and the same goes for most people
I know.
"Choices about what music to play is
left to music programmers," said Glad
— this immediately following his asser-

tion that KZSU strives for variety and
obscurity. I find it curious, if music
programmers are given free rein, that
so few of them seem to have a taste for
anything approaching "mainstream"
rock. I have heard about two or three
aspiring disc jockeys who were frus
trated in their attempts to play more
mainstream fare, partly due to a
playlist from which they were supposed
to play 10 songs per show; perhaps
Glad would like to clarify this word-of
mouth information.
KZSU is not obligated to shape its
programming to my taste. But consider
how cool it would be to have a campus
radio station that the campus actually
listened to. What if there were (com
mercial-free!) dance music for parties
instead of "Putrid Embryonic Convul
sions"?
Word-of-mouth is the most effective

publicity. If KZSU played music that
more students enjoyed listening to, it
wouldn't have to worry as much about
the fate of its special fee, because more
students would feel that they are get
ting their money's worth. Obscure
music need not be abandoned altogeth
er; a few people do listen to it. Simply
tempering it with a truer variety of
palatable sound would be great.
Yesterday I heard a disk jockey say,
"This show is brought to you by the
students of Stanford University." How
many students — all of whom fund the
station — strongly feel that KZSU is
"their" radio station? KZSU may have
a responsibility to the Bay Area. But it
should try harder to be responsive to
Stanford students, its most immediate
community.
