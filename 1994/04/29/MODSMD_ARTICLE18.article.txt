# Grading policy breaks 'contract' with students who prefer old system
## 
### 
Two years ago, I was a senior in
high school, facing college in the fall
and trying to decide which university
to attend. Looking back, I remember,
finding Stanford unique and different
because, like Brown on the East Coast,
the grading system focused on positive

reinforcement and alternative choices.
To change the grading system for those
students already enrolled in the Universi
ty is akin to breaking a contractual obliga
tion.
Each year Stanford enters into a
"contract" with its new class of fresh
men. Those who come to Stanford do
so with certain expectations: four
years of guaranteed housing, top
ranked academics and a grading sys
tem which does not include F's and
which allows students to drop classes
until the last day.

The proposed changes will funda
mentally alter the academic program,
a program that none of the students
who are now enrolled in Stanford
knew about when they decided to
come. As a tour guide, I find it ironic
and sick that the Faculty Senate
should have waited until the Pro Fros
had gone home to meet to discuss this
change to the campus. I just spent the
week lying to students about what
they can expect to find here next year.
If the senate wishes to change the
grading system at Stanford, that is

their prerogative. If they do so, howev
er, make sure those changes are made
in a responsible and legal manner.
Just as the distribution requirements
were changed for an entering class of
freshmen, these changes should be
implemented in the same manner. The
changes should be made to affect an
incoming class, and the students
entering that class should be informed
and made to understand the ramifica
tions of those changes.
