## Getting my ego worked outâ€”trial by Ford 
### 
YOU'VE GOT TO BE NUTS. I kept
striding down the sidewalk like a
woman on a mission, straining under
1 the weight of my backpack, pausing only a
nanosecond to throw a look of disbelief at
my friend Kat. "C'mon," she laughed. "It'll
be fun."
Trust me.
Kat pounced up and down the curb next
to my walkway on her mountain bike, bid
ing her time until my change of heart.
"What are you afraid of?" she asked, trying
to make it a pride thing and win me over to
her side. "It's an experience," she stressed,
sensing my weakness, waiting for the kill.
Kat had just asked me to do something
to which I was morally opposed. Some
thing which I had spent several years of my
life avidly criticizing. Something which
would ruin my standing in the eyes of fam
ily, friends and future significant others.
Something called aerobics.
Work that body.
I whined. I groaned. I cried soft, wet
tears. She was not having it. No mercy.
None at all. Afro-funk, she said. Coordina

tion optional, she said. Five-thirty and be
on time, she said, riding ofT into the dis
tance, ponytail wagging in the wind.
Et tu, Brute?
Aerobics was one of those things I'd
always associated as an exclusively female
activity. Like lending a woman two sizes
bigger than you the very best-fitting little
black dress you own. Like watching her
wear it to some formal you didn't get invit
ed to with some man who wouldn't even
brush his teeth in your direction.
Only unathletic women avoiding full
contact sports and fresh air do aerobics, to
quench their spandex fetishes in the dis
comfort of a stuffy room full of other, Fig
urine-eating ex-cheerleaders.
Tell me I'm wrong.
So the fact that this aerobics business
came from Kat made me somewhat suspi
cious. Kat and I have target-spitting con
tests. Kat and I use graphic language and
talk about men like the pieces of meat they
are. Kat and I use gratuitous body-part ref
erences in the CofTee House every Friday
at lunch, just to make those at neighboring

tables feel uncomfortable.
In good hands.
And as I lay awake at night wondering if
I would survive this estrogen episode with
my chauvinism intact, I began to slip from
my moral high ground. Looking for a little
tomboy-to-tomboy support, a friend hinted
at the fact that I was, perhaps, misled in
my opinions regarding aerobics. Never
done aerobics, she giggled. I do aerobics,
she confessed. Really, I grinned. You're
going to get your butt kicked, she cackled,
walking away laughing.
Something is rotten in Denmark.
I immediately went home and gave sev
eral offerings of free vacuuming to my
roommate, the goddess of endorphins and
exercise fiend-dom, in exchange for a div
ination. Not to worry, she comforted,
you're in good enough shape to survive.
Not to worry, she stressed, aerobics in
Ford couldn't be too intense. Not to worry,
she laughed, coordination and rhythm
aren't totally necessary.
Not to worry, she smirked, as long as
you don't need to walk the next day.

Buns of steel.
Funneled into a room mercifully devoid
of mirror as the hour of reckoning arrived,
I tried to get rid of my butterflies. Every
body stretching and analyzing the multiple
groups of burning muscles from the work
out the day before. Everybody ominously
talking about shooting hoops and running
and doing other, less-feminine forms of
working out. Everybody quieting down as
the instructor entered the room.
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
As she walked in, the angels in the heav
ens above began to sing. As she set down
her boombox and reminded those present
to pay their quarterly fees, the gods on
high nodded in admiration. As she took off
her sweatshirt, any ounce of positive body
image left over since puberty plummeted
from my psyche, crashing in a Hindenberg
esque ball of (lames.
She was a hero among women. Not one
percent of body fat. Not a muscle group left
untoned. Not a misstep of uncoordination.
An athletic marvel. A respiratory giant.
I was in big trouble.

As I danced against the flow of traffic, like
a male talk-show host shamelessly mining
for laughs by invading the aerobics realm,
my self-pride begged for a graceful exit. As I
lunged across the floor, quads cramping,
muscles that had never been used before
prayed for a reprieve. As I crunched and leg
lifted, sweat being released from pores that
had never sweat before, my abdominal wall
screamed for mercy.
End the carnage.
And as I dragged my poor, aching body
home, Womanhood scoffed at me, glorious
in her victory. A woman thing, she mim
icked, kicking me in my sore, destroyed
backside. You mock my abilities, she
jeered. You write me off as just a woman,
she mused. You'll learn, she smiled. A total
and complete, 100-percent butt-kicking.
Feel the burn.

Tish willfully acknowledges defeat and
challenges Kat to a ran as soon as she can
walk again.
