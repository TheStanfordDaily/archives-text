## Baseball to fight off sting From top of Six-Pac, Stanford to buzz with Sac St. 
### Andy Eiser Senior staff writer

The No. 7 Cardinal baseball
team receives a leave-of-absence
from the Pacific 10 Conference
Southern Division wars this week
end, getting a rare Friday off before
waging a home-and-home mini
battle with the Sacramento State
Hornets tomorrow and Sunday.
While Stanford (30-17) can
afford to let up in the middle of a
five-game stretch of non-confer
ence games, both a longing for
revenge and the lessons learned
from Wednesday's 5-4 loss to Santa
Clara should keep the Cardinal
focused when it takes to Sunken
Diamond tomorrow and Sacra
mento's Hornet Field on Sunday.
First, the revenge factor. When
Stanford hosted the unranked
Hornets (23-22) Feb. 15 at Sunken
Diamond, lefty Mathew Myers (1-
2) earned his only victory of the
season to date, shutting out the
Cardinal over six innings before
the Sacramento State bullpen pre
served a four-hit, 7-0 win.
While untested freshman Mark
Williams got the start for Stanford

head coach Mark Marquess that
day, sophomore starters Dan Reed
(9-2) and Todd Bartels (5-2) take
their regular turns in the rotation
for the Cardinal this weekend.
"Any time we play a weekend
game we see it as very important,"
said sophomore third baseman
Brian Dallimore. "Other teams
have to beat our top three starters,
and they're very good."
So good are Reed, Bartels and
freshman Jason Middlebrook (6-
1), who is expected to start when
Stanford hosts San Francisco
State Monday, that they have com
bined for a 20-5 record and 3.02
earned-run average in 200 innings
of work. Reed rides a seven-game
personal winning streak into
tomorrow's start, while Bartels
makes his first appearance Sunday
exactly one week after tossing his
second complete game of the sea
son, a 10-3 victory over Arizona.
With its pitching lined up for the
Hornets this time around, the Car
dinal hopes to revive an offense
that blew several chances to
reverse the outcome of Wednes
day's loss. After scoring five runs in
the ninth inning April 19 at St.
Mary's and teeing off on a dilapi

dated Wildcats staff over the week
end, Stanford unmasked a season
long problem in dropping a close
decision to Santa Clara's younger
pitchers.
"We didn't get any top quality
hits," Dallimore said. "We just
couldn't capitalize on our opportu
nities."
Marquess went further in
assessing his squad's lack of clutch
hitting, implying that close con
tests should decide the outcome of
the Six-Pac race, which the Cardi
nal leads by half a game with six
remaining.
"Hopefully we'll hold on and hit
well," Marquess said. "But we'll
have our hands full beating any
one if we're not playing well."
So this weekend serves as a
tune-up, with stretch-drive inten
sity even away from Stanford's
more familiar conference foes.
"I don't see this being any dif
ferent from any other weekend,"
Marquess said. "They beat us last
time, so this will be a test."
The test begins tomorrow at 1
p.m. and may be heard live on
KZSU (90.1 FM). Sunday's game
starts at the same time but may
not be heard on that channel.
