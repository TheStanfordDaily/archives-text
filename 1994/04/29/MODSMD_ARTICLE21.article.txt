# Wishing for sunny skies, tracksters off to UCLA
## 
### Jorge Chen Staff writer 
After rain canceled last weekend's
meet against California, the Cardinal
trackers are hoping for clear skies as
they head south this weekend. Stanford
will need all the solar power it can gath
er in the first California state collegiate
meet held at UCLA.
"This will be a good meet for us since
it is getting closer to the [Pacific 10
Conference Championships] and UCLA
will definitely give us a tough competi
tion because they always have a strong
track program every year," said head
coach Vin Lananna.
Not only will the Cardinal face off
against the traditional powerhouse, the
Stanford squad will also meet other
state schools including California and
use.
The Bruins have certainly displayed
their strength throughout the confer
ence as they have captured eight of the
past 10 Pac-10 titles.
Senior pole vaulter Jamie Marek
said he agrees with Lananna that
UCLA has the potential to give Stan
ford a run for its money, especially
when it comes to the vaulting squad.
"We will have a great weekend with
the top 25 athletes from California in
each and every event," Marek said.
"The track is of championship caliber
and the weather is predicted to be per
fect with a good tailwind."
After the rain led to an unexpected
weekend off, the team is looking for
ward to this meet as a way to get back
into its rhythm and refocus on its per
sonal standing in the Pac-10.
"I am really excited to compete this
weekend since this is the first Califor
nia state meet and it will give me a good
opportunity to see who is out there
before the Pac-lOs coming up in the
middle of May," said senior long
jumper Jason Robinson.
While the squad will have the oppor
tunity to size up its later-season com
petition, this weekend, the meet will
also be another chance for team bond

ing, according to junior Christy Boyd.
The co-captain hurdler sees the team
coming closer together week after
week.
"The team is improving with each
meet," she said. "We will be able to see
each other compete in different levels
but ultimately, we will unite as a team
in top shape and get ready to head to
Cal."
With its record of 1-0 in the confer
ence dual-meet standings, the team has
impressed with strong showings
throughout the middle bulk of its sea
son.
Lananna remains cautiously opti
mistic about the future outlook into the
finals as many injuries have consider
ably impacted the team's overall score
and showings.
Senior co-captain Gary Stolz, school
recordholder in the indoor 5,000-
meters, has been bothered by a strained
Achilles tendon injury sustained during
the last cross country season.
Excited to see the team in such a
good condition at this stage of the sea
son, Stolz said he was disappointed he
has been unable to contribute to the
team's efforts this season.
"Hopefully I will be well enough by
the time of Big Meet so I can help the
team out a bit and also get back into
shape," Stolz said.
Due to a two-month old heel injury,
junior triple jumper Anne Lee will race
in the 110-meter hurdles this weekend,
an event which places less stress on her
heels than jumping.
"I want to be well enough so I can get
back to my original event and score
some points for the team," Lee said.
Although the team has missed the
services of both Stolz and Lee, the Car
dinal's overall performance has not
been severely hampered.
Lananna maintains his faith in the
remainder of the squad to make up for
the absences.
"This weekend will be another great
meet for us," he said. "The competition
will be tough but both sides Imen's and
women's] are still left wide open."
