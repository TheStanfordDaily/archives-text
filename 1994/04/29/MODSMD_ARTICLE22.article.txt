## Sailing set for Pac Coast regatta 
### Jeremy Stone Staff writer 
Afler two stellar performances last
weekend, the Stanford sailing team will
be looking to end one long streak and
continue another one at the Pacific Coast
Championships, beginning today in Red
wood City.
The coed team is coming off a third
place showing in the Thompson Trophy
Intersectional last weekend, "the best big
finish in the last decade," according to
director of sailing Blake Middleton. That
regatta featured the top seven teams in
the country and 13 other schools, includ
ing four nationally-ranked squads.
Meanwhile, the women's team also
shined with an easy victory in the
Women's Dinghy Pacific Coast Champi
onships earning a berth in the Women's

Dinghy Nationals on May 26-28. The
women are ranked fourth in the nation
lor their highest mark since a brief stint
at the top spot in 1984.
First, the overall team will try to qual
ify for the Team Race National Champi
onships again, as it has every year since
Middleton arrived as head coach in 1986.
To do so, Stanford will compete against
five of the top 16 teams in the United
States: No. 9 UC-Irvine, No. 11 Long
Beach State, No. 12 California, No. 15
Hawaii and No. 16 USC. The top two
squads will advance to the Team Race
Nationals May 30-June 1 in New Lon
don, Conn.
As the No. 5 co-ed team, Stanford is
favored to qualify. Coach Steve Bourdow
said he isn't looking for just second place,
however.
"Winning's pretty critical, because

usually one team wins by a good amount,
while the competition between second
and third is much tighter," Bourdow
said.
Bourdow is hoping conditions will
allow for a double round-robin format, so
each team faces everybody else twice.
Then, the top four teams would conduct
a sail-off to determine the two berths for
nationals. "The more races we get, the
better for us," said Bourdow.
As expected, seniors Scott Sellers and
Jeremy Mclntyre and junior Charles
Meade will skipper for Stanford, and
seniors Sujata Patel and Britt Johnson
and freshmen Don Chennavasin and
Letitia Yang will rotate as their crew,
depending upon the weather.
After Friday's long day of action, most
