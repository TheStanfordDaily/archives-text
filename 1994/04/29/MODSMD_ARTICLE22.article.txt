## Sailing set for Pac Coast regatta 
### Jeremy Stone Staff writer 
Afler two stellar performances last
weekend, the Stanford sailing team will
be looking to end one long streak and
continue another one at the Pacific Coast
Championships, beginning today in Red
wood City.
The coed team is coming off a third
place showing in the Thompson Trophy
Intersectional last weekend, "the best big
finish in the last decade," according to
director of sailing Blake Middleton. That
regatta featured the top seven teams in
the country and 13 other schools, includ
ing four nationally-ranked squads.
Meanwhile, the women's team also
shined with an easy victory in the
Women's Dinghy Pacific Coast Champi
onships earning a berth in the Women's

Dinghy Nationals on May 26-28. The
women are ranked fourth in the nation
lor their highest mark since a brief stint
at the top spot in 1984.
First, the overall team will try to qual
ify for the Team Race National Champi
onships again, as it has every year since
Middleton arrived as head coach in 1986.
To do so, Stanford will compete against
five of the top 16 teams in the United
States: No. 9 UC-Irvine, No. 11 Long
Beach State, No. 12 California, No. 15
Hawaii and No. 16 USC. The top two
squads will advance to the Team Race
Nationals May 30-June 1 in New Lon
don, Conn.
As the No. 5 co-ed team, Stanford is
favored to qualify. Coach Steve Bourdow
said he isn't looking for just second place,
however.
"Winning's pretty critical, because

usually one team wins by a good amount,
while the competition between second
and third is much tighter," Bourdow
said.
Bourdow is hoping conditions will
allow for a double round-robin format, so
each team faces everybody else twice.
Then, the top four teams would conduct
a sail-off to determine the two berths for
nationals. "The more races we get, the
better for us," said Bourdow.
As expected, seniors Scott Sellers and
Jeremy Mclntyre and junior Charles
Meade will skipper for Stanford, and
seniors Sujata Patel and Britt Johnson
and freshmen Don Chennavasin and
Letitia Yang will rotate as their crew,
depending upon the weather.
After Friday's long day of action, most
of those schools will travel to
Alameda for the weekend's prima
ry attraction, the Dinghy Pacific
Coast Championships. Here, the
Cardinal will look to place in the
top two and qualify for nationals
for the first time since 1988.
"The competition should be
real tough," Bourdow said. "All

the schools in team racing are bet
ter in dinghies."
One great sailor can carry a
team in dinghy competition,
whereas depth, Stanford's forte, is
more crucial in team racing, he
explained.
Sellers will carry the load in the
A Division, with a crew of either
Johnson or Patel. In the B Divi
sion, Bourdow has not yet decided
whether Meade or Mclntyre will
handle the skippering duties.
Meade's crew would be Yang;

Mclntyre would sail with Chen
navasin.
After faring well against East
Coast competition in the Thomp
son Trophy regatta, failing to qual
ify this weekend for a sixth
straight year would be devastat
ing.
"We definitely surprised some
people lin the Thompson Trophy
regattaj," Meade said. "I'm look
ing forward to this weekend. Our
chances are better than they have
been in many years."
