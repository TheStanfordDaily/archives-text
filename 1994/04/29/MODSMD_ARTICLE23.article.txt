# Lacrosse takes shot at Final Four title
## Women face final battle, will take on UCSB in first round 
### Emery Chen Staff writer 
The Stanford women's lacrosse team
will take one more test before graduating.
A season of studying behind it, this week
end the Cardinal (8-1) will face its last
exam in the Final Four tournament, to be
held at Maloney Field.
At the beginning of the season, the Car
dinal's goal was to complete a bachelor's
degree by capturing the Final Four in front
of a home crowd in its last season as a club
sport. Next year the team will begin gradu
ate school as it switches to varsity status.
A team led by seniors, the Cardinal
earned an A on its midterm when Stanford
went to St. Petersburg, Fla. and came out
7-2 against nationally ranked Division 111
teams. Now the team hopes that it can
apply everything it learned in Florida to
this weekend's championship.

"We hope to attain the level of play we
had in Florida," said senior co-captain
Jenn Watts. "There were a couple of games
[ in Florida] that we really played well and
knocked them out of their socks."
This weekend, the Cardinal hopes to
extend this confidence as it makes a run
for the West Coast title at Stanford's field
hockey field against a group of teams
which includes UC-Santa Barbara, UC-
Davis and UC-San Diego.
Stanford begins its weekend quest at 3
p.m. tomorrow against its first round
opponent, UC-Santa Barbara. The Cardi
nal has come out victorious over UC-Santa
Barbara twice already this season, first 9-5
at the Santa Barbara Shootout and then 5-
1 at Western States, but the Cardinal will
not take the Gauchos lightly.
"We can't go in assuming anything,"
said coach Kay Cowperthwait.
"They're a good team," added coach

Cecelia Paglia. "The rivalry has been great
for so long."
In the other semi-final, UC-Davis will
play UC-San Diego. The Stanford coaches
agree that both teams will be tough to
beat. There is, however, an added incentive
against UC-Davis as the Aggies have
downed Stanford three times this year, the
latest at the Western States tournament
by a score of 6-4.
"It's really all in Stanford's head,"
Paglia said, referring to Stanford's previ
ous problems against the Aggie squad.
"I really believe there is a mental hang
up against Davis," Watts said. "We know
we can win."
According to Paglia, if Stanford is to
win, certain keys are necessary. The coach
es have been emphasizing strong midfield
play and denying passes, substituting
often to keep fresh players avail
able and scoring balanced, espe
cially from the graduating seniors.
The Cardinal has been relying
too much on one player to do the
majority of the scoring, and Paglia
would like to see a balanced week
end scoring effort from the senior
triumvirate of Betsy Bassis,
Christina Wiellette and Watts.
"When all three are having
good games then we cannot be
stopped," Paglia said.
The other senior on the team,
co-captain Kate Applewhite,
remains on day-to-day status after
suffering an injury at Western
States. If Applewhite cannot play,
sophomore Laura Dean will most
likely fill in, according to Paglia.
The Final Four constitutes the
final tournament for the year, the
club team and the seniors. When
the sport becomes varsity next
year, Stanford will be the first
women's lacrosse team on the
West Coast to do so. As a club
sport, the team has relied on self
sufficiency and a special closeness
that Paglia has enjoyed.
"One of the great things about
being a club sport is that it forms
some special friendships," she
said. "IThe players] were such a
joy to work with and they're so
dedicated to the sport.
The coaches, as well as the play
ers, will also miss Stanford's four
graduating seniors who will com
plete their college careers.
"It's more than losing seniors,
it's losing friends," Paglia said.
