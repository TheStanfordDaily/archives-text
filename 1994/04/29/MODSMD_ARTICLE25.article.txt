Men's lacrosse

the North vs. South game.

also represent Stanford.
Softball
The Stanford softball team (4-27)

will travel to Sonoma State for a double
header tomorrow.
Freshman Angela Webb and Summer
Lee are expected to start on the mound
for the Cardinal.
The rainy weather has forced the
cancellation of many of the team's
games, most recently last Tuesday's
scheduled twin bill at Santa Clara. The
Cardinal will try to tackle the Broncos
next Tuesday.
"We haven't played in a while
because of the rain," said Cardinal head
coach Sandy Pearce. "Practices have
been going well and I know that the
players are anxious to play our final
four games."

tion July 2-5 in St. Louis. Mo.
After spraining her ankle during the

man was selected as an alternate, as was
freshman forward Tara Harrington.
