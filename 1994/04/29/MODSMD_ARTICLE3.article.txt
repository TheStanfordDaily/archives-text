# No school, but lots of work
## Daughters get a chance to 'play office' 
### Colleen Krueger Staff writer 
Victoria Barry sat in her spacious of
fice in the Bowman Alumni House. As her
fingers moved quickly over the keys of the
adding machine, she yawned and looked
aimlessly around the room. It was two
o'clock in the afternoon, she was missing
Barney's show, and she really could have
used a nap.
Victoria is 6 years old, and was one of
many daughters participating yesterday
in Stanford's version of the second annu
al "Take Our Daughters to Work" day.
Sponsored by the Ms. Foundation, the
nationwide event is designed to broaden
girls' career horizons and build their self
esteem.
Here at Stanford, more than 100 girls
helped Mom and Dad do everything from

teaching engineering to making hospital
rounds.
"It was very successful," said Kathy
Seppala, assistant nurse manager at
Stanford Hospital, who organized the
Medical Center's activities. "There were
about 75 daughters here in all different
positions — every job description had
daughters here."
At the Medical Center, the girls spent
the morning with their parents, then
took a 90-minute tour of the hospital —
complete with stops at the helicopter pad,
emergency room and baby nursery.
Later in the afternoon, the girls and
their parents had a reception, with "all
the parents and daughters comparing
notes and socializing," Seppala said.
Staff nurse Merle Maclean said she
brought her 14-year-old daughter
Shawn to visit because "she's
interested in being a doctor and
this seemed like a really good
chance to be exposed to the hospi
tal."
While Shawn especially
enjoyed visiting the animal
research lab "where they
research artificial hearts," she
was happy to "have the chance to
see what Mom does."
"One of Mom's patients was
smiling, and you could tell she
thought it was a good thing,"
Shawn said.
Edie Barry, Victoria's mom
and director of media/education
for the Alumni Association,
agreed that it's "good for them to
see where Mom goes, to see what

happens after they're dropped off
at school."
After Victoria and her friend
Jennifer Farel, 6, mastered
Barry's job in the morning, they
spent the afternoon picking up a
few more skills with Jennifer's
mom, Palo Alto attorney Sheila
Reily.
And although Barry said the
girls returned phone calls, set up
some appointments, and used the
computer, Jennifer had a more
succinct answer: "we played
office."
Across campus, Mandy Mac-
Calla's daughter Caitlin, 12, was
also "playing office" — and hob
nobbing a bit with a Stanford
celebrity.
MacCalla, who works in the
President's Office as an adminis
trative assistant, said Caitlin
wanted to come to Stanford
"mostly because she didn't want
to go to school, I suspect."

Lest she abuse the privilege,
Assistant to the President Jean
Fetter gave Caitlin a few jobs to
do in the office, MacCalla said.
"My daughter is a one-finger
typist," MacCalla said. "There
she was typing labels one finger
at a time, and Mr. Casper came
walking through. He stopped and
turned and looked at her and
said, 'My, I'm just stunned by
your typing.' "
Some Stanford daughters,
however, remained nonplussed in
the presence of academic digni
taries.
Ariane Cornell, 9, daughter of
Industrial Engineering Prof. Elis
abeth Pate-Cornell, confided that
the Faculty Senate meeting her
mother brought her to was not
exactly her cup of tea.
"Well, the teaching part of
Mom's job is okay, but this is
kinda boring," Ariane whis
pered.
