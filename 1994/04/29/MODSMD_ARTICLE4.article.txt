# Faculty leaders favor revised grading rules
## Widespread praise for changes at senate meeting 
### Andy Dworkin Senior staff writer 
Moving up drop and add deadlines, tight
ening the course retake policy and record
ing failing grades won high marks in a dis
cussion of a proposed grading policy at yes
terday's Faculty Senate.
Amid widespread praise for the commit
tee that created the proposal, few funda
mental questions were raised about the
suggested changes — changes that would
record a failing grade on student tran
scripts. Some senate members indicated
that the proposed policy was still too liberal
for their tastes.
The proposal grew out of a survey con
ducted last year by the senate's Committee
on Academic Appraisal and Achievement.
Geology Prof. Gail Mahood, chair of the
committee, presented results of that survey
and other research to the senate yesterday,
along with the new proposed grading policy
and information on how the committee will
gather student input on the proposal.
The policy is scheduled for a vote at the
May 26 Faculty Senate meeting.
The new grading system would include
the failing grade "NP" (not passed) on tran
scripts, impose a stricter policy on retaking
courses and set a three-week deadline for
dropping and adding courses.
In addition, transcripts would be more
historical — recording a "W" for courses
dropped between the fourth and eight
weeks of the quarter and an asterisk to in
dicate courses that are retaken. It would
also move the deadline for declaring the
pass/no credit option to the sixth week of
the quarter.
Students will have a chance to comment
on the policy before the senate next discuss

es it. Mahood said she is meeting with the
ASSU's Student Affairs Committee on
Monday and will meet with students in dor
mitories, including a freshman dorm and a
four-class dorm. Also, she said, students
can write her or electronically mail com
ments to her.
At the meeting yesterday, Mahood said
the two main goals of the policy were to en
sure the sensible use of academic resources
— especially "the productive use of student
and faculty time" — and to report student
course histories honestly while
allowing for student mistakes.
Concerns over the use of aca
demic resources led to the propos
als to change drop deadlines, part
ly because late drops cost money,
she said.
The retake changes will also
ensure better use of academic
resources, Mahood said, because
retakes increase class sizes and
"time spent in marginal improve
ment of grades by retaking cours
es has a significant cost in lost
learning opportunities."
If the new retake policy is
passed in its present form,
Mahood added, there will be a one
year grace period in which stu
dents will be able to retake any
class with no penalty.
Much of yesterday's discussion

also centered around grade infla
tion and failing grades. Mahood
said the new policy — along with a
new commitment to accurate
grading by faculty members —
will hopefully stop a creeping
inflation of grades that has
occurred over the past years,
Mahood said.
"If one thinks of grades as a
kind of language we use to commu
nicate ... it is clear our vocabulary
has lost a lot of meaning" because
of grade inflation, she said.
Thus the creation of the NP is
not an effort to "bring back the F"
but to "save the C," she said.
The major responsibility to
counteract grade inflation falls on
the faculty, said Biology Prof.
Robert Simoni.
"It's the bottom line, it's what
it comes down to," he said.
"Where we are now is that every
body gets an A.. . . Faculty need
to recognize their responsibility
for a serious reflection of student

performance."
Truly representative grades
can't be legislated by the Faculty
Senate, Simoni said, but can be
achieved by individual faculty
members concentrating on the
issue. Simoni said he hoped the
current discussion of grading
would re-focus attention on
assigning accurate grades.
Another main intent of the NP
is to ensure students don't effec
tively drop courses by not attend
ing the final, Mahood said.
Civil Engineering Prof. Jeffrey
Koseff was one of the few profes
sors to speak out against record
ing failing grades at yesterday's
meeting. "I, for one, believe that
you don't need to record NP
grades to put teeth into the drop
policy," he said.
Koseff said he does not see a
problem with the current tran
script system because he has not
heard complaints from the main
users of the transcripts —

employers and graduate schools.

cussed making the new grading
policy more conservative. History

Prof. David Kennedy asked about
further increasing the power of
the grading system. Mahood said
the committee had considered
such steps as placing the median
grade for large classes by a stu
dent's class grade on transcripts
and publishing annual reports on
the distribution of grades, but left
those decisions for the future.
Other professors — including

English Profs. John Bender and
Ron Rebholz — suggested that the
add deadline be moved sooner
than the third week.
"I refuse to let students add up
to the third week because they'd
never catch up," Bender said.
Student members of the com
mittee had named the third week
as the time when students can
know what a class will be like and
so know whether they should drop
the class, Mahood said.
Mahood added that she is open
to suggestions to tinker with the
deadlines, but said that "what I'm
more concerned about at this
stage is the general concept,
whether we're going to make
these major changes" toward a
historical transcript and the
recording of failures.
Economics Prof. Gavin Wright
raised and responded to several
student complaints at the meeting.
One student argument is that
the new policy will discourage

risk-taking when selecting cours
es, he said. However, Wright said,
"I think the risk-taking argument
is a non-argument, a non-issue as
it relates to this report.
"The real problem here is the
problem of late drops," he said.
"Students view risk-taking as get
ting a B."
Another student argument is
that the new grading policy is too
paternalistic, Wright said. Howev
er, he said, the policy is not set up
just to regulate individual students
but to prevent harm to others.
When, for example, students drop
a class late in the quarter they hurt
other students, other faculty and
the quality of the course.
No matter their feelings on the
proposals, many faculty members
praised the work of the committee
as thorough.
"I think the committee has
done an excellent job ... a unique
ly thorough job on a difficult
topic," Simoni said.
