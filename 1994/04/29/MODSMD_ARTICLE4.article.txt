## Widespread praise for changes at senate meeting

Moving up drop and add deadlines, tight
ening the course retake policy and record
ing failing grades won high marks in a dis
cussion of a proposed grading policy at yes
terday's Faculty Senate.
Amid widespread praise for the commit
tee that created the proposal, few funda
mental questions were raised about the
suggested changes — changes that would
record a failing grade on student tran
scripts. Some senate members indicated
that the proposed policy was still too liberal
for their tastes.
The proposal grew out of a survey con
ducted last year by the senate's Committee
on Academic Appraisal and Achievement.
Geology Prof. Gail Mahood, chair of the
committee, presented results of that survey
and other research to the senate yesterday,
along with the new proposed grading policy
and information on how the committee will
gather student input on the proposal.
The policy is scheduled for a vote at the
May 26 Faculty Senate meeting.
The new grading system would include
the failing grade "NP" (not passed) on tran
scripts, impose a stricter policy on retaking
courses and set a three-week deadline for
dropping and adding courses.
In addition, transcripts would be more
historical — recording a "W" for courses
dropped between the fourth and eight
weeks of the quarter and an asterisk to in
dicate courses that are retaken. It would
also move the deadline for declaring the
pass/no credit option to the sixth week of
the quarter.
Students will have a chance to comment
on the policy before the senate next discuss

es it. Mahood said she is meeting with the
ASSU's Student Affairs Committee on
Monday and will meet with students in dor
mitories, including a freshman dorm and a
four-class dorm. Also, she said, students
can write her or electronically mail com
ments to her.
At the meeting yesterday, Mahood said
the two main goals of the policy were to en
sure the sensible use of academic resources
— especially "the productive use of student
and faculty time" — and to report student
