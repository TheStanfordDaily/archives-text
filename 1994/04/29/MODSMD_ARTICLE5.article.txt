# Casper fires back at criticism of firings
## 
### Colleen Krueger Staff writer 
A month after the controversial and
highly publicized firings of several se
nior Stanford administrators, Univer
sity President Gerhard Casper publicly
responded to faculty concerns for the
first time at yesterday's Faculty Senate
meeting.
Maintaining a sympathetic but de
termined stance, Casper defended the
decisions by saying that "we cannot
continue to live in a fantasy world
where cuts in the administration do not
lead to job losses."
In the last few months, the Univer
sity has eliminated the positions of sev-
eral top administrators — includ
ing Cecilia Burciaga, associate
vice provost for student affairs
and Casa Zapata resident fellow.
Burciaga's layoff prompted facul
ty and student protests and has
attracted considerable outside
media attention. Marlene Wine,
long-time secretary to the Board
of Trustees, has also lost her posi
tion.
The dismissals are the result
of administrative streamlining

spurred by the current budget
reduction process, which aims to
cut $18 million to $20 million
from the University's general
funds over the next three years.
Law Prof. Bill Simon opened
the matter to senate discussion
by asking Casper if the elimina
tion of several senior positions
without an attempt to place
those affected in other Stanford
jobs indicates a lack of commit
ment to long-time faculty and
staff members on the adminis
tration's part.
"(These) firings indicate that
the University feels very little
obligation to long-term employ

ees when short-term budget mat
ters are at hand," Simon said.
Simon challenged the Burcia
ga case specifically, as well as
the possibility that the Legal
Office will contract out much of
its work, perhaps leaving some
in-house counsel out on the
streets.
But as the discussion escalat
ed into a senate-wide debate,
with faculty members speaking
both for and against the firings,
Casper stood firm in his asser
tion that the growing pressure of
budget cuts means that "we do
need to make choices, some of
which are difficult."

' "After the first $43 million
cuts we have sustained, the next
$20 million will be much harder
to achieve," Casper said. "Trade
offs become necessary."
As Casper and many faculty
members found it inappropriate
to refer to individual cases on the
senate floor, Burciaga was not
directly discussed — though her
case seemed to underlie much of
the senate's debate.
In this spirit, Casper respond
ed to Simon's concern that
replacement positions were not
found for the fired administra
tors. "We will come to situations
where a position has been termi

nated and we will not be able to
find alternatives," Casper said.
"That is most regrettable, and I
can say of individual cases . . .
that we worried considerably
about them."
Casper's position was sup
ported by Political Science Prof.
Stephen Krasner, who submitted
that tenured faculty are "living
in a Never-Never Land," as their
positions are guaranteed for life.
"We have a distorted view of
what the situation is like in other
work environments," Krasner
said. "People get fired."
Krasner's sentiments were
echoed by Biology Prof. Robert

Simoni.
"If I were part of the adminis
tration, I'd feel hammered right
now for trying to get done what
we asked them to get done,"
Simoni agreed.
Economics Prof. Roger Noll
placed part of the blame for the
circumstances on "a very rigid
and inflexible personnel policy
which makes it easier to elimi
nate a position" than to fire
someone.
"People who aren't very good
stay in crucial jobs and we lose
very good people through jobs
that can be eliminated," Noll
said.
