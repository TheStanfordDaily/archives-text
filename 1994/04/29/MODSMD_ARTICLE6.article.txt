# University unveils new Sand Hill project plans
## 
### Josh Gohlke Staff writer 
Following a seven-month period of
input from Palo Alto and Menlo Park resi
dents, Stanford planning officials present
ed a revised proposal for the development
of the Sand Hill Road area in a meeting
with community members last night.
The meeting began with a presentation
which highlighted new modifications to
Stanford's original proposal, which was to
extend Sand Hill to El Camino Real, ex
pand the Stanford Shopping Center and
construct senior and multi-family housing
at what is known as the "Stanford West"
site, just west of Sand Hill.
The changes include the extension of
Quarry Road to El Camino Real in order to
alleviate Sand Hill traffic, the relocation of
some of the proposed housing to a site east
of Quarry Road and increased attention to
the nearby San Francisquito Creek and its
habitat. The controversial plans for a four
lane extension of Sand Hill remain un
changed.
Stanford officials expect to present the

new plans to the city councils of Palo Alto
and Menlo Park sometime during the next
several months. In the intervening period
they will write up a new application, hear
more comments from the public and sub
mit the proposal for review by an environ
mental impact commission.
University officials hope to gain ap
proval from both cities to begin work on the
project by next spring.
The new features were incorporated
into the project in response to suggestions
gathered from a series of workshops and
meetings with the surrounding communi
ties, said Andy Coe, Stanford's community
relations director.
"The community participation process
has truly worked," Coe said to the audience
of about 150 local residents at the First
Congregational Church in Palo Alto. "We
are extremely grateful for what you have
done."
However, the questions and comments
session after the presentation made it clear
that, although many expressed their sup
port for the project, the opposition which
has plagued the project for five
years — prompting Coe to call it
"the longest running road show
around" — has not disappeared.
Comments seemed equally
divided between those who
expressed their support for the
project, especially the long-await
ed link between Sand Hill and El
Camino Real, and those who
voiced familiar concerns, mostly
about traffic that may accompany
the new roads and new develop
ments.
"I'm very concerned by the
fact that, in my opinion, devel
opment inevitably increases
traffic," one Palo Alto resident
said.
But Jack Peers, a transporta
tion specialist working with the
University, said that models indi
cate that the increase in regional
traffic will be minimal, and that
any future changes will be a
result of the general growth of
the Bay Area, not the individual
project.

"[The development] has a very
small impact once you get any dis
tance from the project," Peers
said. "These projects are not
causing a change. What is causing
it is a generalized growth of popu
lation."
Other residents said they were
happy to see a new connector that
will ease the flow of traffic
between areas surrounding El
Camino Real and Interstate 280.
"I'm pleased to finally see an
east-west arterial that makes
sense," a Menlo Park resident
said.
Peers said the four-lane exten
sions of both Quarry and Sand
Hill to El Camino Real, along
with several new north-south
connectors, will significantly ease
the flow of traffic, although the
mention of the 11 new traffic
lights this would require along
Sand Hill yielded a groan from
the audience.
Concern was also expressed
over the proposed shopping cen
ter expansion, which has
increased from the original
140,000 to 160,000 square feet.
Curtis Feeny, vice president of
Stanford Management Company,

said the extra 20,000 square feet
were partly for greater "linkage,"
mainly through pedestrian paths
between the shopping center, the
new housing, Stanford Hospital
and Palo Alto.
Stanford officials also empha
sized new bicycle paths that have
been added to the plan, along
with pedestrian walkways, to
encourage alternate forms of
transportation, a strategy taken
from community suggestions.
"We hope we can provide an
. . . environment that will invite
people to get out of their cars and
walk or bike from place to place,"
Feeny said.
In response to outcries about
the loss of natural open space to
the Stanford West housing, the
new proposal provides for desig
nated areas of open space in front
of and behind the units, with so
called "greenways" of landscaped
paths connecting them.
Also, all new development will
take place at a minimum of 50
feet away from the banks of San
Francisquito Creek. Some of the
current "hardscaping" that is
closer than that will be removed
and the vacated land revegetated.
