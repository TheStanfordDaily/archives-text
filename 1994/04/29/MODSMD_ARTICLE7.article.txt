# Thompkins urges students to establish 'personal worth'
## 
### Jamie Taylor Staff writer 
In an inspiring speech last night to a
packed Cubberley Auditorium the Rev.
Floyd Thompkins challenged Stanford stu
dents to look closely at their relationships
and stop seeking a sense of personal worth
and beauty through the approval of others.
"God does not let us be born anything
but beautiful," said Thompkins, who went
on to say that the "diversity of skin colors,
of hair colors, of noses" all deserve God's
grace because "God said it was all good."
Thompkins, an associate dean of Memo
rial Church, began his 90-minute speech by
reading from Genesis, and said that the
book is not only about creation, as taught in
courses like Cultures, Ideas and Values. He
asserted that it tells about families, thus
launching into his main message.
"If I could go behind the doors of child
hoods, if I could go behind those closed
doors, I would stand here and I would
weep," Thompkins said. He claimed that

when people become cidults, "it is so hard to
love ourselves because in childhood, people
are belittled" and don't learn to have self
confidence.
Thompkins then challenged the audi
ence to examine their personal relation
ships. People look to other people to gain
approval and feel loved, when they should
find personal worth in their relationship
with God, he said.
However, too many people allow their
families and friends to decide whether to
appreciate their bodies, races and cultures,
Thompkins said. According to Thompkins,
we have been "bamboozled" into believing
that other people give us personal worth.
The solution, he said, is a strong faith.
Thompkins also tailored his sermon to
address the Stanford community in partic
ular, by saying that too often, college stu
dents allow universities to declare their
value. Too many students see grades as a
reflection of their personal worth, he said.
The talk began with a gospel
quintet calling on the audience to
stand, clap along, and sing with
them. Following the songs,
sophomore Toni Neal gave a tes
timony. Neal spoke of the sense of
personal worth and contentment
she has found since she began a
relationship with Christ.
Thompkins followed with his
address. As he began to conclude
the sermon, he addressed the idea
of personal problems by recalling
the strained relationship he had
with his father.
"When you run away from a

bad situation, you run to a worse
one," said Thompkins, continu
ing that to rid oneself of personal
strife, one must "build an altar"
upon which to "sacrifice" prob
lems. "When the Lord gets into
your life and pulls your heart, it's
time right then to build an altar,"
he said.
The sermon ended with the
audience holding hands and
singing songs as Thompkins said
that the "altar doesn't end when
this sermon ends. It's there,
every night of the year."
Last night's event was the
final program in a series of three
Thompkins developed by Cross
roads, a student group dedicated
to unifying the Christian fellow
ships on campus.
