# Group to address psychological illness
## Students writing training manual, planning events 
### Shirley Park Staff writer 
A new student group on
campus hopes to educate the
Stanford community about
the realities and stigmas asso
ciated with psychological ill
nesses.
The group, Psychology
Outreach, aims to combat
prejudice and ignorance
through raising awareness of
psychological illnesses.
"A little education never
did any harm," said sopho

sophomore Marisol Muhoz and
recent alumnus Ravi Bellur.
"I see psychological illness edu
cation as being like CPR training
— it never hurts to have it in case
it comes in handy," Tan said.
To accomplish the rather
abstract central aim of "educat
ing and raising awareness of
Stanford students," the group
has set some concrete goals for its
program. The first is preparing a
manual for use at residence staff
training next September, said
Bellur, a former resident assis
tant. This manual will contain
facts on psychological illnesses
and suggestions on how to
respond to them.
Secondly, the group is in the
process of establishing Speakers'
Panels, dorm outreach panel dis
cussions which stress informality
and the humanization of the
mass of statistics, symptoms and
treatment devices.
At this moment, Psychology

Outreach has a pool of about
eight or nine "contacts," students
with psychological illnesses —
such as eating and anxiety disor
ders, manic depression and
schizophrenia — who are eager to
discuss their experiences.
The first of these panel discus
sions took place in Arroyo House
about two weeks ago. The panel
consisted of three speakers: Bel
lur, who spoke on his experience
with clinical depression, sopho
more Barbara Price, a former
obsessive-compulsive, and junior
Jason Waggoner, a manic depres
sive now receiving treatment.
The panelists grabbed the
audience's attention with their
individual tales of their illnesses
and how they overcame them.
Both Waggoner and Bellur dis
cussed their difficulties with
treatment and recovery. Bellur
said he regrets having listened to
people who said, "You can do this
on your own." Waggoner agreed:
"Most of the advice I was given
[from my peers and friends] was
wrong."
In fact, it took Waggoner
"until this year to realize that

Itreatmentl is not something to
screw around with." Now he
takes lithium and considers his
experiences with manic depres
sion more positively than he did
in the past.
"I made a fool out of myself
many, many times (during my
manic episodes]," he said. "I don't
look back on it with regret
because it's produced who I am
now. I see it as an advantage,
something that marks me as dif
ferent. Now I guess you could say
I'm normal, but I've already said
it all, done it all."
Bellur said he remains incredu
lous about the fact that, as a
sophomore, he was forced to relo
cate from the Suites to a Manzani
ta Park trailer because of his
depression, a biologically-based ill
ness he could not control. "By
being moved out of housing, I was
essentially being treated like
someone who did something
wrong would be treated," Bellur
said.
The stigma of being labeled as
"crazy" often prevents people suf
fering from depression from seek
ing treatment. "You have to hit

rock-bottom before you try to get
help," Bellur said. "It just gets to
the point where it's so bad that
you don't care what people think
anymore."
The panel also addressed com
mon misconceptions about psy
chological illnesses. Waggoner
pointed out that manic depres
sion is often glorified, particular
ly in the artistic community.
However, he said, the focus on
art — the product of manic
episodes — overshadows the
often troubling lives of the artists
themselves.
For example, Waggoner's
uncle, a writer with manic
depression, has been married six
times, encountered drug prob
lems and formed no close friend
ships.
In addition to the residence
staff manual and the Speakers'
Panel, Psychology Outreach also
hopes to launch future projects,
such as coordinating a freshman
orientation program on psycho
logical illnesses, and establishing
liaisons to both the Office of Res
idential Education and to the
Bridge.
