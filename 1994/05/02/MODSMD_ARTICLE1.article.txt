## No. 2 Cardinal volleyball snubbed for NCAA wild card 
### Kathryn Yang Senior staff writer 
Pulling off one of the biggest upset decisions in
collegiate sports this year, a three-man NCAA se
lection committee awarded the volleyball Final
Four wild-card bid to No. 11 Indiana Purdue-Fort
Wayne over No. 2 Stanford yesterday.
By merit of playing in the toughest volleyball
league in the nation, the winner of the Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation Title has earned all 22 of
the last 22 wild card berths. However, this season a
harsh dose of politics reversed that trend and effec
tively created the weakest Final Four field the sport
has seen in years.
"It's a whole lot of bullshit," said sophomore
swing hitter Mike Lambert. "If you take a look at
the standings, UCLA is No. 1, Penn State is No. 5,
IPFW is No. 11 and Ball State is No. 15. With what
we've accomplished this season, I don't understand
why they didn't pick the us, the No. 2 team in the
nation."
After defeating No. 4 USC to secure the MPSF
Pacific Division Title a month ago, the Cardinal lost
the automatic NCAA bid to No. 1 UCLA on April 23.
However, last Tuesday, Stanford (20-9) rebounded
and pulled out a convincing 13-15,15-12,16-14,15-
6 victory over No. 3 Brigham Young to secure the
MPSF title and a chance at the wild card spot.
IPFW, on the other hand, lost to No. 15 Ball
State in the Midwestern Intercollegiate Volleyball
Association league tournament and finished the
year 19-6 — never having competed against top-five
teams like Brigham Young or USC.
In addition, Stanford began the season ranked
No. 6 and climbed its way into its present No. 2 spot.
IPFW, though, began the season ranked fifth, and
has drifted down to the 11th position since.
However, rankings, records and scheduling
aside, there are still two reasons why IPFW might
have edged Stanford in the voting. Besides playing
host for the NCAA Final Four this year, IPFW also
defeated the Cardinal 16-14, 9-15, 15-11, 15-
4 on March 26. Nevertheless, Stanford coach
Ruben Nieves argued that the best team
should have gone.
"The MPSF nominated Stanford because
we proved our stuff on the court," Nieves
said. "The league could have nominated BYU
or USC from our league and they would have
gotten the bid, because they didn't play IPFW
this year. But the fact is that we were the best
team, and since the MPSF didn't pick strate
gically, IPFW won the bid. Isn't it funny how
that works?"
The folks at IPFW might chuckle over the
irony, but for Stanford seniors Joe Burghardt
and Canyon Ceman, that decision squelched
their last hope for an NCAA title.
"It was definitely a shock," said Burghardt,
a team captain. "We deserved to go, but the
right thing doesn't always happen."

Ceman sarcastically commented that the
Mafia must have been involved in the selec
tion process and that the team is setting up
group support clinics to "console ourselves."

It was definitely a shock.
We deserved to go, but the
right thing doesn't always
happen.'

"This is a huge disappointment, and the
decision was incredibly political," Ceman
said. "But we know that we proved a lot to
ourselves this year. We overcame a lot of
youth and inexperience and proved that we're
a good team. I'm proud of us, I'm proud of me

and I'm proud of Joe."
As for the long-range impacts of this upset,
Nieves speculates that the MPSF will take a
look at how the league is set up next year.
Considering the fact that eight of the top 10
teams in the nation come from the MPSF,
coaches in this division will try and make sure
that the West is better represented in future
Final Fours.
"All West Coast coaches will think this is
very unfair," Nieves said. "I don't even
know what the committee's reasoning is,
and the entire thing just doesn't seem right
to me."
For now the Stanford Department of
Athletic is trying to appeal the decision.
However, with the Final Four slated to start
this Friday, the Cardinal's chances of an
overrule are slim to none.
"A lot of people are going to have things
to say about this," Lambert said. "It's so
wrong."
