## No. 2 Cardinal volleyball snubbed for NCAA wild card 
### Kathryn Yang Senior staff writer 
Pulling off one of the biggest upset decisions in
collegiate sports this year, a three-man NCAA se
lection committee awarded the volleyball Final
Four wild-card bid to No. 11 Indiana Purdue-Fort
Wayne over No. 2 Stanford yesterday.
By merit of playing in the toughest volleyball

MPSF title and a chance at the wild card spot.
IPFW, on the other hand, lost to No. 15 Ball
State in the Midwestern Intercollegiate Volleyball
Association league tournament and finished the
year 19-6 â€” never having competed against top-five
teams like Brigham Young or USC.
In addition, Stanford began the season ranked
No. 6 and climbed its way into its present No. 2 spot.
IPFW, though, began the season ranked fifth, and
has drifted down to the 11th position since.
However, rankings, records and scheduling
aside, there are still two reasons why IPFW might
have edged Stanford in the voting. Besides playing
host for the NCAA Final Four this year, IPFW also
