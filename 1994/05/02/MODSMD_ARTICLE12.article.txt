California faces a future of enormous challenges
— including population growth, an increasing cul
tural diversity, social and environmental conflicts,
and a shrinking economy — but experts at a one-day
conference Saturday agreed that the state has the
resources to survive.
For the conference, titled "The Future of Califor
nia," the Stanford Alumni Association gathered
state officials, local and Stanford economists, and
area business leaders.
Monica Seghers, director for the Continuing Edu
cation Alumni Programs, said the conference sought
"to increase awareness and to give alumni greater
insights into California's problems."
The schedule of events included keynote presen
tations by former state senators Rebecca Morgan
and Barry Keene, two panel discussions on the Cali
fornia economy and education, and commentaries bv
various experts on earthquakes, welfare reform and
crime.
In the day's first address, "Rejuvenating the Sili
con Valley," Morgan, who is currently president and
chief executive officer of Joint Venture — a coopera
tive effort among Silicon Valley business leaders —
as well as a member of the Stanford Board of
Trustees, spoke about the effects of the recent eco
nomic recession.
Citing statistics on job loss, Morgan stressed the
importance of fostering growth throughout the
state. "The real challenge for us is to build a collab

orative effort among business, government, educa
tion and community to become again the world-class
business environment that we've been known for,
and to support some emerging clusters of industries
that will create jobs," she said.
Morgan went on to explain that Joint Venture
intends to initiate job growth. "We started in eco
nomic development, in helping entrepreneurs start
businesses, expanding exports, education, regulation,
streamlining, health improvement, defense conver
sion and environmental technology," Morgan said.
She was optimistic about California's future.
"The entrepreneurial spirit is still alive and well
here in the Valley," she said. "We have world-class
manufacturing going on . . . and we have universi
ties that are still the best in the world."
In the conference's second keynote address,
Keene, president and CEO of the Association for
California Tort Reform, asked "Is the state of Cali
fornia ungovernable or merely ungoverned?"
Keene's answer was that California's government
leaders have been slow to respond to the challenges
of the 21st century. "A government which allows a
growing list of problems to accumulate, as Califor
nia's has, will not long endure," he said.
According to Keene, the global community has
picked up on California's problems. "Internationai
ly-read publications write that California is on the
skids — they say that the public schools are not edu
cating. . . . From Europe to Japan potential tourists
are told the streets are no longer safe," he said.
