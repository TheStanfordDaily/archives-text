## ANC leads in election results Early tallies show Mandela first, de Klerk second 
### 
JOHANNESBURG, South
Africa (AP) â€” The African
National Congress, taking a com
manding lead in the first election
to include South Africa's black
majority, suggested yesterday it
would include pro-apartheid
whites and Zulu nationalists in
the government despite their poor
showing.
ANC spokesman Pallo Jordan
said Nelson Mandela would not
claim victory yesterday because of
the small number of votes count
ed but added: "We'll boogie
nonetheless, because we think it's
about time we did."
A strong second-place showing
by President F.W. de Klerk's
National Party left other parties
in the dust, suggesting a post
apartheid power structure not
much different from the Man
dela-de Klerk team that led the
transition to democracy.
With about 23 percent of the
vote counted, Mandela's ANC had
55.0 percent, followed by 30.9

percent for the Nationalists. The
Zulu nationalist Inkatha Free
dom Party was a distant third
with 5.1 percent, followed by the
pro-apartheid Freedom Front at
3.5 percent.
"In spite of the proportional
voting system, we are heading for
a two-party system," said political
commentator Sampie Terre
blanche, referring to the alloca
tion of Parliament and Cabinet
seats according to each party's
vote total. With 5 percent of the
vote needed to win a Cabinet seat,
the ANC and National Party
appeared headed for a sweep.
Whatever the final tally, the
ANC was certain to be the overall
victor based on Mandela's over
whelming popularity among the
black majority. At the plush Carl
ton Hotel in downtown Johannes
burg, a grinning Mandela beamed
down from posters on the walls of
the ballroom where the ANC
planned its victory celebration.
Jordan, the ANC spokesman,

said the group's projections indi
cated it would win 58 percent of
the vote, substantially less than
the two-thirds majority needed to
write a permanent, post
apartheid constitution single
handedly.
"You go into a match to score
the highest score, so you're not
going to be happy if you don't
score as highly as you would have
liked to. We would have been hap
pier to have made it two-thirds,"
Jordan told a news conference.
The new, 400-seat Parliament
will elect a president Friday, set
ting the stage for Mandela to
replace de Klerk as head of state.
De Klerk is expected to be vice
president.
While vote-counting was
painfully slow, starting more
than 12 hours late in some places,
early results showed that despite
fierce campaigning, smaller par
ties could not compete with de
Klerk and Mandela's powerful
presence.
