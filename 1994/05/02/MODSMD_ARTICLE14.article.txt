# Tanzania overwhelmed by refugees
## Supplies scarce for 250,000 Rwandans flooding relief camps

NGARA, Tanzania (AP) — A handful
of relief workers struggled yesterday to
cope with 250,000 refugees who flooded
into a camp in Tanzania, seeking sanc
tuary from weeks of bloodletting in
Rwanda.
Refugees spent the night huddled in
the open, soaked by an intermittent rain
that doused their campfires and left
small children wailing in misery.
United Nations officials were
stunned by the number of people who
left Rwanda, Tanzania's northwestern
neighbor, in just 24 hours Thursday and
Friday to flee the ethnic slaughter.
Thousands of refugees were still trudg
ing in the rain yesterday, walking the 10
miles from the frontier to the camp.
"We went down to the border cross
ing at about 4 or 5 o'clock Thursday
afternoon on a routine check, and when
we looked across, the hills on the other

side of the river were streaming with
people," said Maureen Connolly, a U.N.
High Commissioner for Refugees emer
gency officer.
In the face of a rebel advance into
southeastern Rwanda, the Rwandan
army fled without a fight and left the
border unguarded for 24 hours — long
enough for the massive exodus. The
rebels sealed the border Saturday.
Officials fear another 250,000 people
could swarm into Tanzania if the border
reopens.
"It is quite a mess," said Dr. Etienne
Krug, the medical coordinator at the
camp. "Two hundred and fifty thousand
people is like a small city and we have
nothing organized."
Hundreds of refugees lined up in a
gray mist yesterday morning in front of
what passes for the camp clinic, a small,
concrete building with no roof. Plastic

sheeting had been spread across the top,
but it leaked rainwater.
Inside and alone, Sigisbert Bucyayu
nigura, 40, a former cameraman with
Rwanda TV and now a newly designated
U.N. medical assistant, was seeing
patients.
Many, he said, were suffering from
bronchitis and pneumonia, diarrhea,
malaria and abdominal problems. A few
had machete and bullet wounds.
At least 100,000 people have been
killed in nearly a month of savagery in
Rwanda, and more than 1.3 million
have fled their homes.
The United Nations, the Internation
al Committee of the Red Cross and some
private agencies already had between 30
and 40 staffers and supplies on hand in
this small, remote Tanzanian town,
because of an earlier crisis in Burundi.
But it wasn't enough.
