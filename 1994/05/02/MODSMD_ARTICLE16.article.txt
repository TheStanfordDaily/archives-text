## Editorial A 						fresh perspective New incentive program should improve quality of teaching, save money 
### 
JUST WHEN YOU thought the
University couldn't do any
thing right when it comes to
the budget and improving teach
ing, Stanford actually came up
with a new plan to deal with an old
problem.
The Faculty Retirement Incen
tive Program was unveiled Thurs
day as a way to save the University
money on salaries and give a youth
ful shot in the arm to an aging fac
ulty. Under the plan, faculty
between the ages of 60 and 69 are
offered a lucrative bonus to retire
from active duty on the Farm and
make way for young assistant pro
fessors to be hired.
The plan shows that the Univer
sity can be innovative in saving
money without damaging impor
tant aspects of Stanford. There has
been no incentive for faculty to
retire early since the old system
expired in 1992.
Professors between 60 and 65
who have been here more than 15
years can get a cash bonus of up to
twice their annual salary. With aver
age salaries hovering around
$94,000, that's not a bad incentive
to simply stop working and begin
getting a pension. Professors
between 65 and 69 will be offered
incentives on a sliding scale; 69-
year-olds, for example, would receive
60 percent of their regular salary for
not working. Still not a bad deal.
The plan should entice a good
number of the nearly 200 faculty
members eligible to take the money
and run. If all goes well, the plan

will save millions in salaries over
time; the initial cost should be offset
in four to five years.
The new faculty members who
will replace the early retirees should
offer Stanford more than just
increased energy, more enthusiasm
and new ideas around campus. Such
a shift in the composition of faculty
would also present a good opportu
nity for the University to shift the
teaching evaluation process away
from evaluation forms toward peer
review. New faculty should be more
open to different evaluation meth
ods if they are introduced to them as
soon as they get here.
One serious concern about the
new early retirement plan is that it
will cause a stream of valuable
senior faculty to take off. UC-Berke
ley, which has also offered large cash
bonuses to encourage professors to
retire early, had problems maintain
ing the quality of its faculty after
many professors took the offer.
Stanford should keep close watch
over the senior faculty as they take
advantage of the new program,
keeping records of the resulting
attrition as it happens, so it does not
lose too many valuable faculty
members.
The tenure system has its pros
and cons. While it gives faculty the
necessary security to commit them
selves entirely to a university, it also
keeps some older professors here
much longer than they should be.
The early retirement program
should allow instructors to move on
without losing face — and will hope
fully weed out those who may not
have a real drive to teach.
After all those professors willing
to pass up a couple hundred thou
sand dollars to teach students are
probably the same ones able to keep
sleepy students awake for a 9 a.m.
class.
