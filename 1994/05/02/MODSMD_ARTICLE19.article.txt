## Beckett: it's a tough job... 
### 
BUT SOMEBODY has to do it. Can
one compare a politician to a uni
versity administrator? I aim to do
so for a couple of reasons. For one thing,
there has been a fair amount of personnel
bashing around these parts. More specif
ically, Stanford is losing an administrator
in the Department of Athletics.
I have no scoop, I have no Checkers, I
have no tape. But with the passing of
Richard Nixon — and in the midst of
other high-profile departures — I want to
acknowledge a death of sorts here at
Stanford.
Associate Athletic Director Tom
Beckett is leaving the Farm to run the
show at Yale. That's the school where
George Bush — a Republican whose
political career recently died — played
baseball.
Yale is thinking about making the
debate club a varsity sport to increase its
number of national championships. But
aside from maybe tennis and a rower
here and there, Bulldog athletics
revolves around beating Harvard in foot
ball — and that's it. They play basketball
games on Friday nights so the boys can
study during the week. We're not even
that naive. They've got a sweet band,
though.
I Yale-bash only because it's in the Ivy
League and well, they can't hear me, so
why not? At least Harvard has hockey,
Princeton has good hoops and Columbia
can play non-American football. After
that there's not much else. I wonder if

the Yale Law School IM team can beat
ours in football, or, for that matter, in
U.S. News and World Report.
But I know Beckett very well. We
worked together for the better part of
two years — I managed the Band up until
this last Big Game. If there is anyone in
America who can make Yale a power
house in the Ivy League, it is him.
Beckett has sought this type of posi
tion for a long time. His name surfaced
for Stanford's top job when Ferdinand
("Andy") Geiger left to work his magic at
Maryland. He also interviewed at UNLV
and rumors circulated about him taking
the position at Cal, but I think he knew
better than to go work for those despica
ble hooligans. Now he has finally got his
dream job.
OK, so why all the talk about politi
cians? I've come to discover that the uni
versity administrator is really nothing
more than a politician elected by the
trustees, not the masses. How they do
their job defines them as a puppet or a
player. Gerhard, Condoleezza, Beckett et
al. — they're all politicians. Beckett,
though, always worked hard to make
sure everyone in his department was
taken care of.
I'm glad I don't have that kind of job.
Alumni call and wave money in your face
complaining about the Tree costume.
Budgets seem to shrink every year. You
spend your time reading The Daily saying
"Shoo fly, shoo!" How could anyone pos
sibly accomplish anything with so many

pieces of bread to butter?
If you ask those who worked with
Beckett, they will tell you that he was
their friend. If the ticket office needed
extra seats, he'd find a way to get them. If
the operations people needed help from
those in marketing, he would assist in
finding a solution. If KZSU wanted to
cover the women's soccer team in North
Carolina, he found the money.
In 11 years of service to Stanford,
Beckett did just about everything he pos
sibly could except what he probably
wants to do the most — run the Athletics
Department. Perhaps one day he will get
the chance. For now, he will try to build
the Yale program in the mold of the pro
gram he helped create here. I wish him
nothing but the best.
He and I didn't usually agree when it
came it to the Band. Yet many times I
saw him clapping along to "All Right
Now." I doubt he will lose the Cardinal in
his veins, but for now he bleeds Yale blue.
Stanford will sorely miss him.
I wonder if he'll be able to get used to
saying "Beat Harvard." He should try to
work it in the phone number for tickets.

Tom, if you're reading, about all that
stuff about Yale: I work in satire. Remem
ber!
