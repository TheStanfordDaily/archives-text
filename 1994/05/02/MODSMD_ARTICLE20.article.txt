## Lack of interest in KZSU reflects 'dull' musical tastes 
### 
IN HER LETTER from April 29, stu
dent Carrie King writes: "consider
how cool it would be to have a cam
pus radio station that the campus actu
ally listened to." Well, consider how cool
it would be if we had a campus that was
interested in new, creative and challeng
ing music.
For a student body that is generally
considered intelligent, free-thinking and
appreciative of cultural and artistic
diversity, the musical tastes of Stanford
students seem exceedingly dull and
closed-minded. I've seen the same CDs
in so many students' collections and it's
all music that's been fed to us from
every corner of the media — from the
retail charts in Billboard to the over
played songs on classic rock stations. Or
for the "cutting edge" listener, MTV's
"Buzz Bin" and Live 105's heavy rota
tion have created the canon of music for

students who want to be different.
KZSU attempts to offer a true alter
native to this musical rut that plagues so
much of the youth culture at Stanford. A
lot of the music that King complains is
too inaccessible is made independently by
people just like ourselves — young and
creative, and eager to express and experi
ment with their own ideas. If the product
of that expression is something that
sounds at first like "obscure, grating
noise," its because it's not what your
ears are used to. Music doesn't have to
be about conforming to our established
tastes; it can be about exploring new pos
sibilities with sounds, and defying tradi
tional conceptions of musical aesthet
ics.
Our campus station is commonly crit
icized for not playing music that caters
to a wide and mainstream audience. But
would you expect Stanford to include

paperbacks from the top of the New
York Times best-seller list in its aca
demic curricula, just because that's
what people generally like to read? Of
course not; a university is primarily
about inspiring and fostering new and
critical ideas. Why doesn't this thought
ful standard extend beyond students'
coursework to their personal interests
as well?
At KZSU, our goal is certainly not to
play music that offends you. If every
thing you hear on our station sounds
noisy and cacophonous, then you
haven't listened much, and you haven't
listened closely to what you've heard. As
a disc jockey, I'd like to think I'm part
of a group of people who care a lot about
music. We're people who have given a
lot of thought to what we like and what
we want to play for our audience.
As volunteer staff at a non-commer

cial station, our motivations are not to
promote bands that are going to sell lots
of records to an ignorant and easily
manipulated audience. Our sole drive is
to give airtime to the music that we find
the most interesting, the most innova
tive and most representative of what we
value.
Maybe I'm overestimating the Stan
ford student body by thinking its mem
bers might be interested in anything
outside of our commercial media
drenched world, where taste in music is
nothing but another way to be like
everyone else, and music itself is only a
commodity. But as a KZSU disc jockey,
I really hope that my audience is more
likely to form its own ideas, and I hope
at least some of that audience comes
from my own student body.
