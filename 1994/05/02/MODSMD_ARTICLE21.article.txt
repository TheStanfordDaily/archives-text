# Stanford community should oppose project
## 
### 
I am writing in the hope that the
Stanford community will mobilize to
fight "Stanford West." To me, Stan
ford's charter is to teach and to promote
research — not to engage in real estate
development. Why on earth should Stan
ford be in the business of building 750
rental townhouses and 388 "indepen
dent living" units, especially when this
will destroy yet another unspoiled piece
of land and threaten San Francisquito
Creek.
In the 10 years since I left Stanford's
faculty, I have become increasingly
appalled by Stanford's obsession with
real estate development. The "Stanford
Farm" atmosphere of the interior cam
pus has long disappeared; the campus
now looks like any other development
complex. Why on earth does Stanford
want to build yet another building com

plex, one which it cannot even argue has
any educational purpose?
Stanford's status as a non-profit
university gives it enormous tax and
other advantages over real estate
developers — including using charita
ble donations from alumni for clearly
commercial purposes. How does Stan
ford justify this? Is this legally defen
sible? (I am, heaven knows, not a
developer myself!)
If Stanford believes its charter
includes being a real estate developer,
then it should consider purchasing
vacant property in Palo Alto or East
Palo Alto. This would give the local
economy a boost, protect San Fran
cisquito Creek and stop worsening the
urban sprawl of the Farm.
Please — let's help Stanford re-focus
its energies back to its educational and
research purposes and wean it from its
real estate development obsession.
