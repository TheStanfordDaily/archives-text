# ASSU should do more to cut campaign litter
## 
### 
Now that the ASSU elections are two
weeks behind us, I find it hard to believe
that the campus is still littered with cam
paign signs. Having them desecrate our
campus during elections was bad enough,
but it's intolerable to see them around
now, like forgotten souls that have fallen
by the wayside. I remove them when I
see them, but it seems like the eager
beaver candidates depleted the stock of
paper in copy shops from here to Marin
County in their efforts to broadcast
insipid, meaningless slogans to students
who usually couldn't care less. I find new
campaign posters every day.
In the hopes that next year's elections
will foster more respect for both campus
issues and the students that care about
them, I propose two campaign rules for
the future:
• Centralized areas where campaign

ers can put their catchy slogans. Hope
fully, that will spare the rest of the cam
pus from inane rhymes and mindless
promises to reduce tuition and win
NCAA championships.
• More strict rules for taking down
election fliers, as in a combination of
fines and loss of office.
I realize that some students find cam
paign noise to be a necessary part of
yearly elections. Hey, ASSU senators in
your darling new sweatshirts — how
about a little consideration for the rest
of us?
