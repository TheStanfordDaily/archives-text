## Lacrosse wraps season 2nd in Final Four Davis defeats women 9-6 
### Emery Chen Staff writer 
The Stanford women's lacrosse constantly bat
tled back from behind but ultimately ended up on
the wrong end of the stick in its attempt to win the
Western Women's Lacrosse League Final Four.
Competing for the last time as a club sport yes
terday, the Cardinal erased a three-goal deficit in
the first half during the championship game
against UC-Davis before finally succumbing 9-6.
At halftime, the score was tied at four after
Stanford scored three unanswered goals, two of
them coming in the last three minutes. However,
the Aggies came out strong in the second half and
countered with three consecutive goals of its own
on the way to their second consecutive WWLL
championship.
"I honestly believed that our kids were going to
be able to keep that momentum going," said coach
Cecelia Paglia.
The Cardinal's biggest problem throughout the
game was containing the UC-Davis fastbreak.
"Davis could capitalize quickly on any kind of
mistake," said coach Kay Cowperthwait. "On the
two or three passes that we missed that they were
able to pick up, they were able to [score!.
"Davis is a good team and they were just a little
bit stronger then we were today," she added of the
team's play yesterday.
Offensively, senior Betsy Bassis led the Stanford
attack, scoring three goals despite facing heavy
opposition.
"Betsy had a really strong game," Paglia said.
"[Bassis was] really composed when she was being
double teamed."
In addition, junior Emily Chang's saves in goal
and sophomore Peppie Stephenson's contributions
on both offense and defense kept Stanford close.
