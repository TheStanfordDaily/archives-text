## Lacrosse wraps season 2nd in Final Four Davis defeats women 9-6 
### Emery Chen Staff writer 
The Stanford women's lacrosse constantly bat
tled back from behind but ultimately ended up on
the wrong end of the stick in its attempt to win the
Western Women's Lacrosse League Final Four.
Competing for the last time as a club sport yes
terday, the Cardinal erased a three-goal deficit in
the first half during the championship game
against UC-Davis before finally succumbing 9-6.
At halftime, the score was tied at four after
Stanford scored three unanswered goals, two of
them coming in the last three minutes. However,
the Aggies came out strong in the second half and
countered with three consecutive goals of its own
on the way to their second consecutive WWLL
championship.
"I honestly believed that our kids were going to
be able to keep that momentum going," said coach
Cecelia Paglia.
The Cardinal's biggest problem throughout the
game was containing the UC-Davis fastbreak.
"Davis could capitalize quickly on any kind of
mistake," said coach Kay Cowperthwait. "On the
two or three passes that we missed that they were
able to pick up, they were able to [score!.
"Davis is a good team and they were just a little
bit stronger then we were today," she added of the
team's play yesterday.
Offensively, senior Betsy Bassis led the Stanford
attack, scoring three goals despite facing heavy
opposition.
"Betsy had a really strong game," Paglia said.
"[Bassis was] really composed when she was being
double teamed."
In addition, junior Emily Chang's saves in goal
and sophomore Peppie Stephenson's contributions
on both offense and defense kept Stanford close.

Sophomore Peppie Stephenson takes a shot in Saturday's semifinal win over against UCSB. The women lost yesterday to
the UC-Davis Aggies 9-6 in the championship game of the Western Women's Lacrosse League Final Four.
"I thought Changster played
incredible and that Peppie
Stephenson played out of her
mind," Cowperthwait said.
Even though the team hoped
for a better result, the Cardinal
still displayed the same effort and
determination that carried it
throughout the season.
"I was really impressed with
our team and really proud of
them," Cowperthwait said. "I was
most glad that they never game
up and kept going for ever and
ever."
In order to make it to the
finals, Stanford had to come back
against a very tough UC-Santa
Barbara team on Saturday,
defeating the Gauchos 14-13.
Scoring her only goal of the
weekend with 1:24 left in the
game, senior Christina Wiellette
came through in the clutch.
"I tweaked my ankle in the
beginning and didn't feel in the
game," said Wiellette of her play
up to that point. "I felt that I was
running up and down without
doing anything."
After Wiellette shot the win
ning goal, however, her emotions
understandably changed.
"It's perfect. I couldn't ask for

anything better," she said.
Throughout the game, Stan
ford exhibited balanced scoring
with senior co-captain Jenn
Watts and Bassis scoring five
goals apiece and three others
chipping in.
Pleased with the shot selection
of the Cardinal offense, Cow
perthwait commented on the
attack's many high-percentage
shots and also noted the defensive
play from Stephenson and sopho
more Hannah Flatau.
"Peppie and Hannah made it
their responsibility Ito stop the
Gauchos], saying that over their
dead bodies will someone score a
goal," Cowperthwait said.
The tournament marks the
last appearance of seniors Bassis,
Watts, Wiellette and co-captain
Kate Applewhite. The team will
notice the void left by the absence
of its three leading scorers and its
top defensive player.
"[The seniors] were such a
strong chunk of our team," Cow
perthwait said.
Paglia agreed, adding
"Ithey'rel such great people,
great, leaders and were really fun
to have around."
Buoyed by the performance of
the team in this season of transi
tion, the coaches look forward to
turning varsity next year. In sum
ming up the season, Paglia said
she had "no complaints."
