What a difference a year makes.
Last season, the Stanford men's golf team fin
ished ninth in the Pacific 10 Conference Champi
onships and failed to qualify for the NCAA West
Regionals. This year, the second-ranked Cardinal
squad that will open Pac-10 Championship com
petition in Tucson, Ariz, today looks like an
entirely different team.
That's because it is.
Four of Stanford's top five golfers sat out last
season as redshirts in a typical strategy employed
by coach Wally Goodwin. All four golfers had at
least two years of collegiate golf under their belts
before spending a season on the sidelines.
"I like to have them play as soon as they get
here so they can learn the game," Goodwin said.
"We usually redshirt them sophomore or junior
year to make the most out of their eligibility."
Senior Brad Lanning and juniors Notah Begay
111 and Casey Martin both sat out last season.
Junior William Yanigisawa, a transfer from UC-
Irvine, also redshirted, leaving junior Steve Bur
dick the only current Stanford golfer to have com
peted last year.
With an impressive season, Burdick became an
All-American, joining Begay and Martin in that
category.
In 1992, with Begay, Martin, Burdick and Lan
ning all competing, the Cardinal shocked the con
ference and won the Pac-10 Championships. The
team went on to finish ninth in the NCAAs.
Now with its top players all competing, Stan
ford's success comes as a bit less of a shock. Ihe
Cardinal boasts four talented and experienced
players with two years of eligibility remaining to
make a run for the NCAA Championships. The
squad has put together one of the best seasons in
school history, winning four tournament titles
and finishing second in two more.
This week's conference championship is the
linksters' final competition before NCAA Region
al action, which begins in two weeks. As the NCAA
West Regionals will be held on the same course in
Tucson, Ariz. May 19-21, the Cardinal's perfor
mance through Wednesday could be crucial.
"We don't want anything drastic to happen,"
Goodwin said. "We don't want people to start
thinking they can beat us up and then really beat
us up in the NCAAs."
Goodwin added that, in terms of qualifying for
regional play, the Pac-10 Championships mean no
