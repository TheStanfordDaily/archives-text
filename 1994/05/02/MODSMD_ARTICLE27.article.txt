# 'We should have hit better'
## Softball falls to Sonoma St. 
### Randy Reback Staff writer 
Although the Stanford Softball team has
not managed to capture the spotlight this sea
son, it continues to quietly struggle through
its game schedule.
Most recently, the team (4-29) dropped 4-0
and 3-1 decisions to Sonoma State Saturday.
The Cardinal failed to take advantage of
solid pitching from freshman starters Angela
Webb and Summer Lee, who went the dis
tance in the first and second games, respec
tively. The Stanford offense was sluggish in
the opener, which was the first game the team
had played in two weeks.
"Mentally we slacked ofTa little, and it took
us a while to get going," said captain Lynn
Anderson. "Even when we got going, we

weren't too excited. We haven't played or
practiced in a while because of the rain, but
there's no excuse â€” we still should have hit
better."
Despite improved hitting in the second
game, the Stanford bats were unable to pro
duce with runners in scoring position. The
Cardinal loaded the bases with one out in
three different innings, yet failed to drive
home any of the runners.
"Our defense was doing fine, but we just
left too many runners on," said sophomore
Toni Morengo. "It's been really hard to keep
the morale high."
The lack of recent games might be one rea
son that the Cardinal's intensity would be low
during the final games of its season. Stanford
has had two recent contests rained out from
its limited schedule.
The Cardinal's frustrating
season would be a more obvious
explanation for low spirits. With
only three players returning
from last year, the young club
has struggled against its compe
tition.
Head coach Sandy Pearce has
repeatedly emphasized the posi
tive improvements the players
have made this season, yet even
she has recently admitted that
some of the losses have been
"disappointing."
Another frustration has been
the lack of support for the team,

especially due to the low number
of home games at El Camino
Park.
"The parents and fans that
have come to our away games
have been great, but generally
there hasn't been a lot of sup
port," Morengo said. "Our only
home games were over spring
break. Hopefully we'll have a
field on campus next year, but
the |Department of Athletics]
has been promising us one for
years."
The Cardinal hopes to end its
season on a winning note tomor
row, when it visits rival Santa
Clara for a doubleheader. Santa
Clara has handed Stanford three
defeats this season, while the
Cardinal has earned one victory
against the Broncos.
