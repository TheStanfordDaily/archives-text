# 'Responding to challenges'
## Netters take two 
### Mike Langford Senior staff writer 
And that's the season.
The Stanford men's tennis
team concluded its regular con
ference matches with two wins,
the first a 7-0 thrashing of
Washington followed by a close
4-3 edge over California. Stan
ford finished the year with a
22-2 dual match record.
"If you had told me at the
beginning of the season that
this team would finish at 22-2,
I would have told you that you
were crazy," said head coach
Dick Gould. "That's a tremen
dous tribute to the guys' com
mitment and effort."
In the final home showing of
the year on Thursday, Stan
ford sported a new-look lineup
to demolish the visiting
Huskies. While senior Michael
Flanagan and sophomore Jeff
Salzenstein won in straight
sets in their customary first
and second singles spots, third
singles saw a Cardinal not
familiar with that position.
"Chris (Cocotos) did a really
good job at three," said Gould
of the senior's 6-1, 6-1 victory.
"Of course, we're so even in the
middle of the lineup that any
one of a number of guys could
have done well there. But
Chris did a great job when
given the opportunity."
Robert Devens, still plagued
with a sore back, sat out both
singles and doubles against
Washington.

Sophomore Jim Thomas tri
umphed again at fourth singles
in straight sets, as did senior
Vimal Patel, who returned
from injury to play fifth sin
gles. Senior Billy Wright, in a
fitting conclusion to his Stan
ford career, also took sixth sin
gles in straight sets.
In doubles action, all three
teams of Flanagan-Cocotos,
Salzenstein-Patel and Thomas-
Grant Elliott handily van
quished their Husky oppo
nents.
"Our doubles did great
against Washington," Gould
said. "But they did not so great
against Cal. They did pretty
good, but we'll be taking a look
at [our doubles]."
In the top doubles slot, the
team of Flanagan-Cocotos nar
rowly downed Cal's Brian
Eagle and Casey Louie by a 9-8
score. And while Elliott and
Devens, who was available for
doubles only, turned in a 8-6
victory, Salzenstein and Patel
dropped their contest in the
Saturday competition.
Stanford was lucky to get
the doubles point, and it would
prove essential. Stanford had
beaten Cal with a close 4-3 win
when the two met at Stanford
earlier in the year, although
the Cardinal had played with
out Flanagan. With Devens out
of the singles lineup, Stanford
faced some very difficult
matches.
