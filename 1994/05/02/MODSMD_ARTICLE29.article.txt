SACRAMENTO â€” A tailspin
has the Cardinal seeing green.
Facing a headstrong swarm of
green and gold-clad Hornets, the
No. 7 Stanford baseball team this
weekend extended its losing
streak to three games by dropping
a pair of non-conference contests
to Sacramento State.
In winning 8-5 at Sunken Dia
mond Saturday and 14-3 at Hor
net Field yesterday, the Hornets
(25-22) completed a three-game
sweep of the season series and
improved their chances of receiv
ing an at-large bid to the NCAA
College World Series Regionals
later this month.
"This is unbelievable. I wish we
could play that way against every
one," said Sacramento State head
coach John Smith, whose squad
also took a single game from the
Cardinal (30-19) in February.
"That's a tribute to their ball
club."
And what a tribute it was. Play

ing above their fourth-place status
in the Western Athletic Confer
ence Western Division, the Hor
nets pounded out 22 runs on 27
hits in two days against the best
two starters for Stanford, which
sits atop the powerhouse Pacific
10 Conference Southern Division.
On the heels of a 5-4 loss to
non-conference rival Santa Clara
last Wednesday, the Cardinal dug
itself a hole Saturday and could
not escape despite a late rally.
Senior leflfielder Ray Brown got
the Hornets going in the second
inning, touching Stanford sopho
more ace Dan Reed with a leadoff
home run over Sunken Diamond's
left-field scoreboard.
Brown then added an RBI sin
gle in the third, a feat duplicated
by junior first baseman Steve
Thobe on the very next pitch to
make it 3-0 in favor of Sacramen
to State.
The Hornets doubled their
advantage in the fifth, as sopho
more shortstop Mike Carpentier
led off with a double and Beeman
