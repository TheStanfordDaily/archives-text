SACRAMENTO — A tailspin
has the Cardinal seeing green.
Facing a headstrong swarm of
green and gold-clad Hornets, the
No. 7 Stanford baseball team this
weekend extended its losing
streak to three games by dropping
a pair of non-conference contests
to Sacramento State.
In winning 8-5 at Sunken Dia
mond Saturday and 14-3 at Hor
net Field yesterday, the Hornets
(25-22) completed a three-game
sweep of the season series and
improved their chances of receiv
ing an at-large bid to the NCAA
College World Series Regionals
later this month.
"This is unbelievable. I wish we
could play that way against every
one," said Sacramento State head
coach John Smith, whose squad
also took a single game from the
Cardinal (30-19) in February.
"That's a tribute to their ball
club."
And what a tribute it was. Play

ing above their fourth-place status
in the Western Athletic Confer
ence Western Division, the Hor
nets pounded out 22 runs on 27
hits in two days against the best
two starters for Stanford, which
sits atop the powerhouse Pacific
10 Conference Southern Division.
On the heels of a 5-4 loss to
non-conference rival Santa Clara
last Wednesday, the Cardinal dug
itself a hole Saturday and could
not escape despite a late rally.
Senior leflfielder Ray Brown got
the Hornets going in the second
inning, touching Stanford sopho
more ace Dan Reed with a leadoff
home run over Sunken Diamond's
left-field scoreboard.
Brown then added an RBI sin
gle in the third, a feat duplicated
by junior first baseman Steve
Thobe on the very next pitch to
make it 3-0 in favor of Sacramen
to State.
The Hornets doubled their
advantage in the fifth, as sopho
more shortstop Mike Carpentier
led off with a double and Beeman

and junior third baseman Derek
Brown followed with back-to-back
run-scoring singles. Brown later
came around on a fielder's choice
and the lead grew to 6-0.
While Reed (9-3) did not
answer the bell for the sixth
inning and had a personal seven
game winning streak snapped, the
Cardinal could not solve Sacra
mento State junior junkballer
Willie Rivera. After surrendering
hits to the first two batters he
faced, Rivera (4-4) settled down to
retire 13 of the next 14 with an
assortment of sidearm curveballs
and darting fastballs.
"I kept them off balance and
used my sidearm curve to get
them thinking, then I used my
fastball to get them out," Rivera
said.
However, after Stanford
freshman reliever Brendan Sulli
van surrendered an unearned
run in the top of the sixth, Rivera
ran out of steam. Cardinal
sophomore centerfielder Cale
Carter and freshman shortstop
Eric Sees led off with consecutive
singles, and sophomore third
baseman Brian Dallimore fol
lowed with an RBI on a fielder's
choice. Dallimore later scored on
a single by senior designated hit
ter Nate Olmstead as the gap
closed to 7-2.
Hornets freshman catcher
Jason Quintel responded in the
top of the seventh with a solo
home run off the scoreboard, and
despite a Sees sacrifice fly in the
bottom of the inning and two
Stanford runs in the eighth,
Sacramento State had the game in
hand. Hornets senior Mike Eby
sealed the deal, relieving Rivera

and pitching the final 1-2/3 score
less innings to pick up his first
save.
No save would be necessary for
Sacramento State yesterday, as
the Hornets ripped Cardinal No. 2
starter Todd Bartels (5-3) to the
tune of 10 runs on 11 hits in 4-1/3
innings to put the game out of
reach.
A bloop single by senior first
baseman Josh Kirtlan plated two
Sacramento State runs in the bot
tom of the first, but Dallimore
grounded a single to right to score
a lone Stanford run in the second.
The Hornets used four singles,
including one RBI from Ray
Brown and two from Quintel, to
add three runs in the third.
The Cardinal mustered anoth
er run off Beeman (8-2) in the
fourth on an infield single by
junior second baseman Jed
Hansen, but Derek Brown
launched a two-run shot over the
left-field wall in the bottom of the
inning to extend the margin to 8-
2.
The carnage continued in the
fifth, as Sacramento State chased
Bartels on a run-scoring single
from senior second baseman
Robert Perry and added another
tally when Stanford freshman
reliever Ben Rada issued a bases
loaded walk to Beeman. Quintel
added a sacrifice fly in the sixth as
the lead ballooned to 11-2.
Cardinal sophomore catcher
A.J. Hinch provided the only
Stanford highlight of the day with
a solo home run in the seventh,
but Thobe crushed a Mark
Williams offering over a parking
structure 425 feet away in left for
the final three runs of the game in
the bottom of the inning.
"This wasn't a fluke," said Car
dinal head coach Mark Marquess.
"For whatever reason, they gave
us a pretty good whipping."

SACRAMENTO — A tailspin
has the Cardinal seeing green.
Facing a headstrong swarm of
green and gold-clad Hornets, the
No. 7 Stanford baseball team this
weekend extended its losing
streak to three games by dropping
a pair of non-conference contests
to Sacramento State.
In winning 8-5 at Sunken Dia
mond Saturday and 14-3 at Hor
net Field yesterday, the Hornets
(25-22) completed a three-game
sweep of the season series and
improved their chances of receiv
ing an at-large bid to the NCAA
College World Series Regionals
later this month.
"This is unbelievable. I wish we
could play that way against every
one," said Sacramento State head
coach John Smith, whose squad
also took a single game from the
Cardinal (30-19) in February.
"That's a tribute to their ball
club."
And what a tribute it was. Play

ing above their fourth-place status
in the Western Athletic Confer
ence Western Division, the Hor
nets pounded out 22 runs on 27
hits in two days against the best
two starters for Stanford, which
sits atop the powerhouse Pacific
10 Conference Southern Division.
On the heels of a 5-4 loss to
non-conference rival Santa Clara
last Wednesday, the Cardinal dug
itself a hole Saturday and could
not escape despite a late rally.
Senior leflfielder Ray Brown got
the Hornets going in the second
inning, touching Stanford sopho
more ace Dan Reed with a leadoff
home run over Sunken Diamond's
left-field scoreboard.
Brown then added an RBI sin
gle in the third, a feat duplicated
by junior first baseman Steve
Thobe on the very next pitch to
make it 3-0 in favor of Sacramen
to State.
The Hornets doubled their
advantage in the fifth, as sopho
more shortstop Mike Carpentier
led off with a double and Beeman

and junior third baseman Derek
Brown followed with back-to-back
run-scoring singles. Brown later
came around on a fielder's choice
and the lead grew to 6-0.
While Reed (9-3) did not
answer the bell for the sixth
inning and had a personal seven
game winning streak snapped, the
Cardinal could not solve Sacra
mento State junior junkballer
Willie Rivera. After surrendering
hits to the first two batters he
faced, Rivera (4-4) settled down to
retire 13 of the next 14 with an
assortment of sidearm curveballs
and darting fastballs.
"I kept them off balance and
used my sidearm curve to get
them thinking, then I used my
fastball to get them out," Rivera
said.
However, after Stanford
freshman reliever Brendan Sulli
van surrendered an unearned
run in the top of the sixth, Rivera
ran out of steam. Cardinal
sophomore centerfielder Cale
Carter and freshman shortstop
Eric Sees led off with consecutive
singles, and sophomore third
baseman Brian Dallimore fol
lowed with an RBI on a fielder's
choice. Dallimore later scored on
a single by senior designated hit
ter Nate Olmstead as the gap
closed to 7-2.
Hornets freshman catcher
Jason Quintel responded in the
top of the seventh with a solo
home run off the scoreboard, and
despite a Sees sacrifice fly in the
bottom of the inning and two
Stanford runs in the eighth,
Sacramento State had the game in
hand. Hornets senior Mike Eby
sealed the deal, relieving Rivera

and pitching the final 1-2/3 score
less innings to pick up his first
save.
No save would be necessary for
Sacramento State yesterday, as
the Hornets ripped Cardinal No. 2
starter Todd Bartels (5-3) to the
tune of 10 runs on 11 hits in 4-1/3
innings to put the game out of
reach.
A bloop single by senior first
baseman Josh Kirtlan plated two
Sacramento State runs in the bot
tom of the first, but Dallimore
grounded a single to right to score
a lone Stanford run in the second.
The Hornets used four singles,
including one RBI from Ray
Brown and two from Quintel, to
add three runs in the third.
The Cardinal mustered anoth
er run off Beeman (8-2) in the
fourth on an infield single by
junior second baseman Jed
Hansen, but Derek Brown
launched a two-run shot over the
left-field wall in the bottom of the
inning to extend the margin to 8-
2.
The carnage continued in the
fifth, as Sacramento State chased
Bartels on a run-scoring single
from senior second baseman
Robert Perry and added another
tally when Stanford freshman
reliever Ben Rada issued a bases
loaded walk to Beeman. Quintel
added a sacrifice fly in the sixth as
the lead ballooned to 11-2.

A.J. Hinch provided the only
