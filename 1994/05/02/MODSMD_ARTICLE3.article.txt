# Fraternity suspected of Rush violation
## 
### Julie Tsai Staff writer 
The Interfraternity (touncil Judicial Board
will convene this week to investigate allega
tions that members of Alpha Kpsilon Pi
schemed to move into the Kappa Alpha house,
a charge the unhoused fraternity denies.
AEPi members left telephone messages for
the KAs suggesting that their pledges pretend
to be KA pledges and live in the KA house, ac
cording to Fraternal Affairs Adviser Heather
Dunn and KA president Marshall Brickeen.

"Somebody called me and identified himself
as the president of AEPi saying, 'Can we help
with Rush or pledges?' " Brickeen said. "Now,
how are they going to do that? The implication
is that they'll pose as our pledges."
The council will also investigate whether
the 20-member fraternity promised housing to
its rushees, Dunn said. "Apparently they were
driving through the parking lot, checking out
the house."
The council, composed of students and Di
rector of Student Activities Nanci Howe, will
report its findings to Dean of Students

Michael Jackson. If AEPi is found guilty of the
charges, Dunn said they could be subject to so
cial probation or mandatory community ser
vice.
Diana Conklin, acting co-director of Residen
tial Education, also suggested AEPi members
could face penalties through the Judicial Affairs
Office. "When one fraternity tries to pass them
selves off as pledges of another fraternity, it
raises Fundamental Standard questions â€” like
questions of basic honesty," she said.
