# Fraternity suspected of Rush violation
## 
### Julie Tsai Staff writer 
The Interfraternity (touncil Judicial Board
will convene this week to investigate allega
tions that members of Alpha Kpsilon Pi
schemed to move into the Kappa Alpha house,
a charge the unhoused fraternity denies.
AEPi members left telephone messages for
the KAs suggesting that their pledges pretend
to be KA pledges and live in the KA house, ac
cording to Fraternal Affairs Adviser Heather
Dunn and KA president Marshall Brickeen.

"Somebody called me and identified himself
as the president of AEPi saying, 'Can we help
with Rush or pledges?' " Brickeen said. "Now,
how are they going to do that? The implication
is that they'll pose as our pledges."
The council will also investigate whether
the 20-member fraternity promised housing to
its rushees, Dunn said. "Apparently they were
driving through the parking lot, checking out
the house."
The council, composed of students and Di
rector of Student Activities Nanci Howe, will
report its findings to Dean of Students

Michael Jackson. If AEPi is found guilty of the
charges, Dunn said they could be subject to so
cial probation or mandatory community ser
vice.
Diana Conklin, acting co-director of Residen
tial Education, also suggested AEPi members
could face penalties through the Judicial Affairs
Office. "When one fraternity tries to pass them
selves off as pledges of another fraternity, it
raises Fundamental Standard questions â€” like
questions of basic honesty," she said.
Dunn said incidents with AEPi,
similar to the KAs' allegations,
occurred with both the Betas four
years ago and the Theta Delts in
1991, she added.
"If AEPi would direct their
energies in a little more positive
manner, they would do well,"
Dunn said.
AEPi fraternity president Ben
Bromberg denied any plan to mis
lead the University. "We are not
interested in the KA house, and
nothing questionable went on dur
ing Rush," he said. "I believe that
some of our unpreferred sopho
mores wanted to live together in
the housing, but that was it."
Bromberg also said that no one
left telephone messages suggesting
AEPi pledges pose as KA pledges.
That allegation "is so absolutely
untrue," he said. "I never called

[Brickeen] up. This is the first I've
heard of it."
However, Dunn said she had
sent Bromberg a "stern warning"
last week informing him that the
KAs' allegations would be further
investigated.
Bromberg maintained that
Dunn's letter was unrelated to the
charges. "The letter was nothing
formal, but I'd rather not talk
about it,"he said.
Dunn said efforts by an
unhoused fraternity to gain hous
ing are futile under the Universi
ty's current policy, which limits
housing of fraternities to those
"grandfathered," or previously
existing, in Stanford's early years.
"One thing I do know is that the
AEPi's are not going to get a house.
We're looking at revising the poli
cy, but until we make that change,
there's no way," she said.
According to Bromberg, the
only action taken by AEPi in pur
suing a house was submitting a
housing proposal to the University,
as the fraternity has done for the

past six years.
Bromberg also allied the accu
sation that the AEPi's promised
housing to its rushees "completely
ridiculous."
Freshman Dave Moskowitz, a
Kappa Sigma pledge who also
rushed AEPi, said he never heard
any such promises.
Brickeen said he believes the
AEPi's targeted the KA house this
year because of rumors that the fra
ternity, with fewer than five new
pledges last year and one of the
largest fraternity houses on campus,
was in danger of losing its residence.
But Brickeen said the small
pledge class was necessitated by pre
vious large pledge classes of 20 and
32 respectively. "The AEPi's were
under the impression that we were
going to lose the house, and that
they were going to get it, neither of
which materiali7,ed," he said.
Bromberg repeatedly denied
any wrongdoing by his fraternity.
"We're innocent right now," he
said. "1 don't know why this is hap
pening."
