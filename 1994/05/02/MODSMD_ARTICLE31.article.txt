# Shultz speaks on world economy
## 
### José J. Gutierrez Staff writer 
Former Secretary of State George Shultz,
remarking that he was "delighted to address the stu
dents in the world's number one business school,"
shared his insights on the economic prospects of the
United States Friday before a group of about 300 in
Bishop Auditorium.
"I have a thesis today," Shultz said, "that the eco
nomic prospects for the United States, and the world

in general, are unbelievably bright."
Although Shultz, a senior fellow'at Hoover Insti
tution, foresees a brighter future for the world, he
said "political turmoil" seriously threatens the real
ization of these prospects. Politicians are not "get
ting a hold of these problems," he added.
Shultz listed four things politicians must avoid if
they hope to alleviate the turmoil: failing to under
stand both the link between domestic and foreign
policy and between strength and diplomacy; failing
to think globally; losing their sense of direction; and
failing to maintain stability.
Politicians should adhere to their objectives and
"remain consistent," he said. Shultz added that
without stability, "no economic progress will occur."
He also went into specific detail about American
relations with Japan and commented on the "atroci
ties occurring in Bosnia."
Shultz said he believes the United States has the
issues "conceptually wrong," because leaders are not
doing anything effective to decrease and eventually
erase Japan's trade surplus or change China's
human rights practices. "We're not doing our job of
solving the problems," Shultz said.
According to Shultz, the situation in Bosnia is a
"horrible and shameful picture — shameful because
open genocide is occurring and nobody is doing any
thing about it, meaning nobody threatens the Serbs
to stop. We can take away their petroleum and arm
supplies — we can do that," he said.
Shultz concluded his speech with the image of the
"great seal of the U.S. republic," illustrating the
country's commitment to peace.
"Before [President] Truman's executive order,
the bald eagle always looked at the arrow," he said.
"But Truman decided that any rendition thereafter
was to have the eagle looking at the olive branch to
show that the U.S. always seeks peace, but it will
always hold on to the arrow, because in order to
achieve peace, one must have strength."
"He is an excellent speaker," said first-year grad
uate student Allan Piatt. "His points on Japanese
trade relations were well taken, and they helped me
crystallize my thoughts on how we're handling trade
relations with Japan."
The event was sponsored by groups including
the Latin American Student Association, the Asia
Forum and the International Business Associa
tion.
