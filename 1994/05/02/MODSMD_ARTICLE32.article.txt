# Daily beats Knight Fellows in softball
## 
### 
Debuting its new and improved
lineup, The Daily outgunned the
John S. Knight Fellows yesterday
in a 10-8 softball victory.
Behind the solid pitching of
Kyle Graham, the hitting of Jesse
Johannesen and Rob Ross and the
second-base skills of Lindsey Mar
cus, The Daily came from behind
to beat the old-timer journalists.
The Daily trailed 5-3 for most

of the game and was plagued by
fielding errors. Daily third base
man David Schwartz was ejected
by his own teammates after
numerous ridiculous fielding mis
takes. And just when things
looked like they couldn't get any
worse, a number of the Knight
Fellows' young children man
aged to hit their way onto base.
But after putting on the rally

caps and digging into the Miller
Genuine Draft, The Daily exploded
for five runs in the seventh inning.
A last-ditch, ninth-inning
effort by the Knight Fellows
failed, leaving the Daily team in
shock over its victory.
"This is great," said Grace Lee,
editor in chief of The Daily. "It was
worth it to bribe the ump. We real
ly have to thank Tish Williams."
