# Survey on Honor Code ready to be mailed
## Questionnaire to explore student attitudes toward cheating, group projects 
### Frank Guinan Staff writer 
A survey asking about topics
such as cheating, collaboration on
classwork and personal attitudes
toward the Honor Code will be
mailed to randomly chosen stu
dents within the next few days.
Sponsored by the Student Con
duct Legislative Council, the sur

vey is part of its continuing study
of the Honor Code. Graduate stu
dent Derek Miyahara, a council
member, said results are expected
by mid to late May.
Analysis of the survey will go on
through the summer and into the
next school year, according to Ju
dicial Affairs Officer Sally Cole. A
survey of the faculty is the next
step in the study and will probably

take place in the fall, she added.
One of the council's main foci is
on group projects, said SCLC
member Greg Waldorf, who also
chairs the ASSU Senate. "There is
a sense [especially ] among gradu
ate students that there are not
enough guidelines on collabora
tive work."
Waldorf also said the purpose of
the survey is to see if the Honor

Code needs to be "brought up to
date." Currently, the Honor Code
prohibits unpermitted student
collaboration on academic work
but does not provide specific rules.
Communication Prof. Steven
Chaffee, an SCLC member, said
there are not any guidelines in the
Honor Code on how to maintain
fairness in a group setting, espe
daily when an individual is graded
according to his group's perfor
mance.
"We don't really know how
much of a problem this is," Chaffee
said. The problem lies in maintain
ing academic integrity and uphold
ing the spirit of the Honor Code in

such a setting, he added.
Cole said the most frequent
kind of Honor Code violation is
unpermitted student collaboration
on academic work.
"An important part of life in the
workplace involves collaboration,"
she said. "We are trying to find the
best way to train students | to work
in a group environment! . . . but at
the same time record individual
mastery [of a subject]."

Another reason for the survey is
that "it was time to do a new study,"
Chaffee said. "Some questions |on
the survey] are carry-over or com
parable questions that other schools
and past surveys have asked."
Chaffee said the survey is
intended to show the council
whether there have been any
changes in students' attitudes
toward the Honor Code and how
these attitudes with those of stu

dents at other schools.
According to Cole, the last com
prehensive look at the Honor Code
took place in 1976. Since then,
however, there have been three
surveys asking students about aca
demic honesty. The last modifica
tion to the Honor Code was in
1985, when the SCLC gave a clear
er definition of what "proctoring
an exam" meant.
Along with some widely publi

cized cheating incidents in March
1993, more honor code violations
were reported last year than in the
previous years.
There were 40 reported viola
tions for the 1992-93 academic
year, twice the number of the year
before and the highest number of
charges since the Judicial Affairs
Office started keeping records in
1972.
This fact, Cole said, prompted

University President Gerhard
Casper to ask the council to do a
comprehensive review of the
Honor Code.
Faculty members on the SCLC
are appointed by Casper, and stu
dent members are selected during
the spring ASSU election. The
council's main job is to keep tabs
on student conduct policies and
evaluate the effectiveness of these
policies.
