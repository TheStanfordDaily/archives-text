# Few minorities in Ph.D. programs, new report finds
## Stronger H&S recruiting suggested 
### Beth Berselli Staff writer 
Stanford's professional schools
are doing well in the recruitment
of minority graduate students
while its doctoral programs are
falling behind, according to the
rough draft of a report submitted
to the provost last week.
The drafted report of the
Provost's Committee on the Re
cruitment, Retention and Gradua
tion of Minority Graduate Stu
dents recommended among other
things that the School of Humani

ties and Sciences augment its re
cruiting staff in an effort to in
crease the number of minority
doctoral candidates.
The draft echoes the annual re
port of the Faculty Senate's Com
mittee on Graduate Studies issued
in November which found that al
though the past five years have
brought significant improve
ments, the University has failed to
reach a 1989 target goal of dou
bling the number of minority
graduate students by this year.
