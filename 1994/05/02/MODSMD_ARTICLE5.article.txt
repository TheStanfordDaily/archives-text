# Few minorities in Ph.D. programs, new report finds
## Stronger H&S recruiting suggested 
### Beth Berselli Staff writer 
Stanford's professional schools
are doing well in the recruitment
of minority graduate students
while its doctoral programs are
falling behind, according to the
rough draft of a report submitted
to the provost last week.
The drafted report of the
Provost's Committee on the Re
cruitment, Retention and Gradua
tion of Minority Graduate Stu
dents recommended among other
things that the School of Humani

ties and Sciences augment its re
cruiting staff in an effort to in
crease the number of minority
doctoral candidates.
The draft echoes the annual re
port of the Faculty Senate's Com
mittee on Graduate Studies issued
in November which found that al
though the past five years have
brought significant improve
ments, the University has failed to
reach a 1989 target goal of dou
bling the number of minority
graduate students by this year.
The chair of the committee
that produced the report, George
Dekker, said members of the sen
ate committee also received copies
of the report so that they could
offer input.
"We got a very positive recep
tion from the provost and the
committee," said Dekker, associ
ate dean of graduate policy.
"Some modifications were recom
mended. The report needs some
changing of data and some
reworking of things that aren't
quite clear, but basically it's com
plete."
Dekker would not release a
copy of the 44-page report
because it is still in draft form,
but he did summarize the main
findings and recommendations,
including the suggestion of
increased recruiting efforts for
doctoral candidates.
"The focus of the report is how
well existing University policies
have been carried out over the
past 10 years," Dekker said,
adding that the final report will
probably be released next fall.
The report comes in the wake
of recent concern over minority
issues among graduate students.
At a protest held last month at
the Graduate Minority Admit
Weekend, students carried signs
reading, "We need you more than
ever," and claimed that Stan
ford's current recruitment efforts
are not sufficient.
Dekker said the report deals
with "nuts and bolts issues,"
including drop-out rates and
timetables for graduation of
minority students.
"The statistical data shows
that recruitment of minority stu
dents over the past five years has
improved significantly," Dekker
said.
However, despite these
improvements the University
"has fallen short" of a goal set by
the 1989 University Committee
on Minority Issues of doubling
the number of minority graduate
students.
The report found that "the
general problem is the recruit

ment of minority students into
Ph.D. programs," Dekker said.
"This is true at all universities
across the country. . . . We believe
that we can and should do better,
but Stanford is currently ahead of
any other private leading univer
sities."
One of the report's main rec
ommendations is that the Univer
sity strengthen the recruiting
staff in the School of Humanities
and Sciences. This may involve
hiring more staff, Dekker said.
"Our main concern is to
increase the number of Ph.D. stu
dents," Dekker said. "In the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences we have the greatest oppor
tunity to do that."
Committee member Roni
Holeton — an associate director
of graduate studies — said the
recommendation is "a good one
because Humanities and Sciences
is one of the largest schools.
There's a real need there, based
on the number of students we
admit each year."
Dekker said the report found
that the departments of English,
History and Modern Thought and
Literature have been especially
successful in their recruitment
effects. "A real effort is being
made," he said.
This success is partly due to
the fact that these departments
often allow minority students
"opportunities to work on topics
that have an ethnic basis,"
Dekker said.
The Physics Department has
also been "very active in recruit
ing" and the School of Engineer
ing has "invested a great amount
of resources" in its recruiting
effort, he added.
Other recommendations in the
report include having each school
develop a diversity plan, and ask
ing the president and provost to
"give high-profile support" to the
improvement of the recruiting
effort and "continue their com
mitment to recruiting and retain
ing minority faculty members,"
Dekker said.
Recommendations were also
made on retention. A section of
the report, titled "The Minority
Graduate Student Experience at
Stanford," focuses on ways to
improve the environment for

minority students.
"The most significant finding
is that the experiences of minori
ty graduate students are different
than those of non-minority stu
dents," said doctoral candidate
Lori White, who served on the
committee. "The general climate
is not as good or as hospitable for
minority students as it is for
other students."
Holeton said the points raised
in the report about the problems
facing minority graduate stu
dents are "very valid." She added
that not only did minority gradu
ate students sit on the committee,
they were also surveyed about
their experiences.
The report also evaluated
Stanford's professional schools.
Dekker said the committee found
that the schools of law, business
and medicine have "done very
well" in recruitment.
Part of the reason for their
success if because "they have a
bigger pool of applicants than
Ph.D. programs," Dekker added.
The recommendation to these
schools is "basically to keep up
the good work," he said.
The draft is the effort of a com
mittee of students, faculty and
staff formed last fall by Provost
Condoleezza Rice to examine the
University's performance in
recruitment, retention and grad
uation rates.
Dekker said the committee
studied "targeted groups of
minority graduate students,"
including Puerto Ricans, Mexi
can-Americans, Native Ameri
cans and African-Americans. "We
targeted students who have been
traditionally under-represented
in higher education," he said.
Committee members are "opti
mistic about the recommenda
tions and the possibility of their
implementation based on Rice's
warm reception of the report,"
Holeton said.
White said the report is
"important because it makes peo
ple take stock of what they've
done and where they need to
improve."
"The provost said it's one of
the few reports she's seen where
almost all of the recommenda
tions have a strong possibility of
being implemented," she said.

Dekker said the committee
studied "targeted groups of
minority graduate students,"
including Puerto Ricans, Mexi
can-Americans, Native Ameri
cans and African-Americans. "We
targeted students who have been
traditionally under-represented
in higher education," he said.
Committee members are "opti
mistic about the recommenda
tions and the possibility of their
implementation based on Rice's
warm reception of the report,"
Holeton said.
White said the report is
"important because it makes peo
ple take stock of what they've
done and where they need to
improve."
"The provost said it's one of
the few reports she's seen where
almost all of the recommenda
tions have a strong possibility of
being implemented," she said.
Stanford's professional schools
are doing well in the recruitment
of minority graduate students
while its doctoral programs are
falling behind, according to the
rough draft of a report submitted
to the provost last week.
The drafted report of the
Provost's Committee on the Re
cruitment, Retention and Gradua
tion of Minority Graduate Stu
dents recommended among other
things that the School of Humani

ties and Sciences augment its re
cruiting staff in an effort to in
crease the number of minority
doctoral candidates.
The draft echoes the annual re
port of the Faculty Senate's Com
mittee on Graduate Studies issued
in November which found that al
though the past five years have
brought significant improve
ments, the University has failed to
reach a 1989 target goal of dou
bling the number of minority
graduate students by this year.
The chair of the committee
that produced the report, George
Dekker, said members of the sen
ate committee also received copies
of the report so that they could
offer input.
"We got a very positive recep
tion from the provost and the
committee," said Dekker, associ
ate dean of graduate policy.
"Some modifications were recom
mended. The report needs some
changing of data and some
reworking of things that aren't
quite clear, but basically it's com
plete."
Dekker would not release a
copy of the 44-page report
because it is still in draft form,
but he did summarize the main
findings and recommendations,
including the suggestion of
increased recruiting efforts for
doctoral candidates.
"The focus of the report is how
well existing University policies
have been carried out over the
past 10 years," Dekker said,
adding that the final report will
probably be released next fall.
The report comes in the wake
of recent concern over minority
issues among graduate students.
At a protest held last month at
the Graduate Minority Admit
Weekend, students carried signs
reading, "We need you more than
ever," and claimed that Stan
ford's current recruitment efforts
are not sufficient.
Dekker said the report deals
with "nuts and bolts issues,"
including drop-out rates and
timetables for graduation of
minority students.
"The statistical data shows
that recruitment of minority stu
dents over the past five years has
improved significantly," Dekker
said.
However, despite these
improvements the University
"has fallen short" of a goal set by
the 1989 University Committee
on Minority Issues of doubling
the number of minority graduate
students.
The report found that "the
general problem is the recruit

ment of minority students into
Ph.D. programs," Dekker said.
"This is true at all universities
across the country. . . . We believe
that we can and should do better,
but Stanford is currently ahead of
any other private leading univer
sities."
One of the report's main rec
ommendations is that the Univer
sity strengthen the recruiting
staff in the School of Humanities
and Sciences. This may involve
hiring more staff, Dekker said.
"Our main concern is to
increase the number of Ph.D. stu
dents," Dekker said. "In the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences we have the greatest oppor
tunity to do that."
Committee member Roni
Holeton — an associate director
of graduate studies — said the
recommendation is "a good one
because Humanities and Sciences
is one of the largest schools.
There's a real need there, based
on the number of students we
admit each year."
Dekker said the report found
that the departments of English,
History and Modern Thought and
Literature have been especially
successful in their recruitment
effects. "A real effort is being
made," he said.
This success is partly due to
the fact that these departments
often allow minority students
"opportunities to work on topics
that have an ethnic basis,"
Dekker said.
The Physics Department has
also been "very active in recruit
ing" and the School of Engineer
ing has "invested a great amount
of resources" in its recruiting
effort, he added.
Other recommendations in the
report include having each school
develop a diversity plan, and ask
ing the president and provost to
"give high-profile support" to the
improvement of the recruiting
effort and "continue their com
mitment to recruiting and retain
ing minority faculty members,"
Dekker said.
Recommendations were also
made on retention. A section of
the report, titled "The Minority
Graduate Student Experience at
Stanford," focuses on ways to
improve the environment for

minority students.
"The most significant finding
is that the experiences of minori
ty graduate students are different
than those of non-minority stu
dents," said doctoral candidate
Lori White, who served on the
committee. "The general climate
is not as good or as hospitable for
minority students as it is for
other students."
Holeton said the points raised
in the report about the problems
facing minority graduate stu
dents are "very valid." She added
that not only did minority gradu
ate students sit on the committee,
they were also surveyed about
their experiences.
The report also evaluated
Stanford's professional schools.
Dekker said the committee found
that the schools of law, business
and medicine have "done very
well" in recruitment.
Part of the reason for their
success if because "they have a
bigger pool of applicants than
Ph.D. programs," Dekker added.
The recommendation to these
schools is "basically to keep up
the good work," he said.
The draft is the effort of a com
mittee of students, faculty and
staff formed last fall by Provost
Condoleezza Rice to examine the
University's performance in
recruitment, retention and grad
uation rates.
Dekker said the committee
studied "targeted groups of
minority graduate students,"
including Puerto Ricans, Mexi
can-Americans, Native Ameri
cans and African-Americans. "We
