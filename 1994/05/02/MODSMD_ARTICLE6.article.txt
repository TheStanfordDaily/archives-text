# COP finishes poll of undergraduates
## 240 surveyed on advising, budget cuts 
### Burt Herman Editorial staff 
Students looking for academic
advice predominantly turn to
their friends rather than Univer
sity advising resources, according
to a recent ASSU survey, and
more than one-third of under
graduates prefer the current sys
tem of distribution requirements
to suggested alternatives.
Of students polled in the
March survey, 48.5 percent said
their main source of information
when choosing their major came

from other students. Freshman
advisers were next in importance
when choosing a major, at 28.5
percent.
The survey was sponsored by
the Council of Presidents — in con
junction with the Provost's Office
and the Commission on Under
graduate Education — and
broached a wide range of topics in
cluding advising, undergraduate
education, recent budget cuts and
Tresidder Union services. Portions
of the results will be published
