# COP finishes poll of undergraduates
## 240 surveyed on advising, budget cuts 
### Burt Herman Editorial staff 
Students looking for academic
advice predominantly turn to
their friends rather than Univer
sity advising resources, according
to a recent ASSU survey, and
more than one-third of under
graduates prefer the current sys
tem of distribution requirements
to suggested alternatives.
Of students polled in the
March survey, 48.5 percent said
their main source of information
when choosing their major came

from other students. Freshman
advisers were next in importance
when choosing a major, at 28.5
percent.
The survey was sponsored by
the Council of Presidents — in con
junction with the Provost's Office
and the Commission on Under
graduate Education — and
broached a wide range of topics in
cluding advising, undergraduate
education, recent budget cuts and
Tresidder Union services. Portions
of the results will be published
in the spring issue of Campus Cur
rents available later this week.
COP member Jason Snyder said
the questions were designed to
"ensure that the information will
useful to the decision-making pro
cess. We were looking at questions
relevant to [the commission's] mis
sion and the budget-cutting process."
To gather the data, Snyder said
240 randomly selected undergradu
ates were interviewed over the tele
phone. The survey has a 6 percent
margin of error, he added.
While the commission has said it
is considering making substantial
changes to the current distribution
requirement system, 34.1 percent
of undergraduates polled said they
preferred the current system.
Students also expressed interest
in a system requiring two classes in
four subject areas, with 35 percent
choosing this option. Only 23.5 per
cent of those polled would want to

take a three-course track of inte
grated subject areas to fulfill
breadth requirements.
Student advising has been an
area that undergraduates have
expressed dissatisfaction with in
town meetings held by the commis
sion over the course of the year. In
a poll conducted by The Daily in
November, 65 percent of students
polled did not agree with the state
ment that the current academic
advising system is adequate.
The COP survey asked students
a variety of questions concerning
advising relationships. Most stu
dents polled said that they relied on
their peers for a significant portion
of their academic advice.
Only 15.1 percent said that they
used the Undergraduate Advising
Center for advice on majors, while
17.2 percent of those polled went to
the center for general advising.
One area where students turn to
someone besides their fellow stu
dents is for pre-professional advice.
The advising center was the main
source for most students, but those
surveyed still ranked other stu

dents as their second choice for
advice in this area.
On another poll question dealing

34.1 percent of under
graduates polled said
they preferred the cur
rent DR system.

with the controversy surrounding
recent budget and staffing cuts, 40
percent of students felt administra
tors are not taking their opinions
into account. Another 40 percent
believed their interests were consid
ered, and 20 percent did not know.
The Career Planning and Place
ment Center was recently able to
avoid the budget-cutting knife, and
the survey helped to bolster COP
claims to the provost of the ser
vice's usefulness, Snyder said.
Compared to various student
services, undergraduates polled felt
the CPPC was the most responsive

to student needs, ahead of Tresid
der, the Registrar's Office and the
Center for Teaching and Learning.
The letter of recommendation
services offered by the CPPC were
the most appreciated and valued by
students, with counseling appoint
ments ranking just behind.
The recently appointed Tresid
der Task Force will also be able to
use some of the information gath
ered by the survey, as Tresidder
management comes up with a plan
to deal with the forthcoming cut in
University subsidies.
The survey asked students a
variety of questions concerning the
services offered at Tresidder, as
well as students' satisfaction with
the current offerings.
While 88.7 percent of those
polled said they have used the Cof
fee House more than once, 80.7 per
cent said that they never used Stan
ford Hairstyling.
The COP is still compiling the
final survey results, and plans to
release the complete information
to University decision-making
bodies including the commission.
