# S. African election stirs hope, caution
## 
### Justin Dawe Staff writer 
When the polls closed on South Africa's first de
mocratic elections Friday, a new era of struggle
began for the nation's citizens, say a number of fac
ulty and students closely following the historic elec
tions.
Citing election mismanagement and the forced ex
tensions of voting deadlines due to logistical problems
as signs of what is to come, members of the Stanford
community point to an uncertain future.
Despite the African National Congress' strong
showing and "mandate to power forward with the re
construction and development of the country," gradu
ate student Ihron Rensburg, a native of South Africa,
said the "process of nation-building has a long way to
RO."
Political Science Prof. David Abernethy predicts it
will be difficult to unite the new government's prima
ry goals of wealth and sustained economic growth.
The practical sides of these issues, Abernethy said,
were not dealt with directly during the elections as a
result of presidential candidate Nelson Mandela's aim
of minimizing divisive tensions.
Abernethy pointed to the
underlying truth that, in order to
immediately impact the lives of
poor blacks, the rich white popula
tion will have to make sacrifices.
The fact that more than 90 percent
of whites and more than 50 per
cent of non-black coloreds voted
for F.W. de Klerk's National Party
is also evidence of continued racial
divisions, added Rensburg.
Although accurate election
results will be difficult to obtain
until the 16 million ballots are
counted by hand, the ANC is virtu
ally guaranteed to garner 55 per
cent of the vote, Rensburg said.
Desmond Latham, a South
African journalist studying at Stan
ford in the Knight Fellowship pro
gram, participated in his first elec
tion this week. Although he is

white, he abstained from past elec
tions because he opposed apartheid.
He also named the extension of
public utilities and education as
the primary tasks of the new gov
ernment. "Expectations are not
high at all — people don't expect
cars but they do expect running
water," Latham said.
If the government fails to pro
vide basic services, Abernethy pre
dicted "support for a position to the
left of the ANC will probably grow."
He added that the position of
the South African Communist
Party is a potentially powerful one,
given that many blacks identify
with it based on its repression dur
ing the years of apartheid.
Rensburg does not foresee that
the new government will struggle
to an extent that will push blacks
into supporting the Communist
Party. He believes the govern
ment's Reconstruction and Devel
opment Program will succeed in
"developing an integrated program
with short, medium and long
range goals."

The program's current goals for
the next five years include the
building of one million new homes
and the extension of roads, elec
tricity and plumbing to the town
ships — a project that could cost
more than $15 billion.
Both Rensburg and Abernethy
foresee the advent of a strong black
middle class that will grow under
the influence of international
financial support and investment.
The South African government,
constituted along democratic lines,
differs from that of the United
States in a number of significant
ways. South Africa's president, as
well as its National and Provincial
Assembly members and the major
ity of its upper-level bureaucrats,
are selected based on a system of
proportional representation.
The 200 federal representatives
are chosen by their respective
political parties instead of being
voted on individually. Each party
receives a percentage of seats in
the assembly equal to the portion
of the vote that it receives.
