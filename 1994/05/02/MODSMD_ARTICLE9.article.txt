## Cinco de Mayo festivities reflect struggles, strength 
### Allison Short Staff writer 
Colorful dresses, sombreros, tacos and festive
dancing to "La Bamba" were just some of the many
sights at Wilbur Field yesterday in celebration of
Cinco de Mayo.
Students, staff and community members spent
the day celebrating Mexican culture and reflecting
on the struggles and accomplishments of Mexico's
people.
Cinco de Mayo celebrates the victory of a small
group of Mexicans on May 5, 1862, in the battle of
Puebla. The French army they defeated was then
considered the most powerful in the world. It is a
day observed more in the United States than in
Mexico because it symbolizes the hardships and tri
umphs of Mexican-Americans.
"It's a symbol of survival," said senior Jorge
