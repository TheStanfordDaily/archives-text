### Allison Short Staff writer 
Colorful dresses, sombreros, tacos and festive
dancing to "La Bamba" were just some of the many
sights at Wilbur Field yesterday in celebration of
Cinco de Mayo.
Students, staff and community members spent
the day celebrating Mexican culture and reflecting
on the struggles and accomplishments of Mexico's
people.
Cinco de Mayo celebrates the victory of a small
group of Mexicans on May 5, 1862, in the battle of
Puebla. The French army they defeated was then
considered the most powerful in the world. It is a
day observed more in the United States than in
Mexico because it symbolizes the hardships and tri
umphs of Mexican-Americans.
"It's a symbol of survival," said senior Jorge

Solis. "It symbolizes the struggle
of the common person and the
struggle of people coming here to
the U.S."
The festivities began yester
day with a bilingual Catholic
mass and a speech on "Becoming
a Mexican-American" by George
Sanchez, a Stanford alumnus
and professor of history at
UCLA.
Following the speech was a cel
ebration in Wilbur Field spon

sored by El Centro Chicano, Casa
Zapata and MEChA — a Chi
cano/Latino student organization
— with face painting, pie-eating
contests, children's games, food
booths, dancing and an essay con
test.
One highlight of the afternoon
celebrations was the essay compe
tition for elementary, middle and
high-school students from local
schools. Students wrote about
their hardest struggle and the vic
tory they reached.
"The day is a celebration of the
fact that our culture is still flour
ishing in the U.S., and the essay

contest will focus on keeping the
serious aspect as well," said
senior Martha Cervantes, co
chair of MEChA.
Another attraction of the holi
day event was the traditional, live
Mexican music and dancing put
on by students and community
members, including Ballet Folk
lorico de Stanford. The women
were clad in bright, flowing dress
es with ribbons in their hair while
the men wore uniformed outfits
and large sombrero hats.
Yesterday's events were direct
ed not only toward students, but
also toward the outside com muni

ty in an effort to celebrate their
common culture.
"It's about sharing our tradi
tion and culture," said junior
Luz Herrera, a resident assis
tant in Casa Zapata. "We want
everyone to know that after all
these years it's still alive, and
show our presence at the Uni
versity."
Hut Herrera added that she is
depressed by commercial
exploitation of the holiday. "It's
depressing to see Mervyn's have a
Cinco de Mayo sale because that's
the only time our culture is
expressed," she said.
