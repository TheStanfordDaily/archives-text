MORE THAN JUST A GREAT J08...
Computer-Assisted Learning A business opportunity in the field of education!
At Score!, our business is providing exciting, new
learning tools to children in the Bay Area. We have had
great success and are now poised for regional and
national expansion.
We opened our flagship center in Palo Alto in
November 1992, with funding by Hewlett-Packard
founder Bill Hewlett. In our innovative environment,
cutting-edge interactive educational software helps
children enhance their critical skills in Math, Reading,
Writing, and Science. During 1993, Score! Advantage

alone. Our energetic staff and athletic theme enable
Score! members to discover a love for learning and to
build self-esteem.
We will grow dramatically during the next six to
twelve months. We seek highly motivated individuals
who would like to get in on the ground floor as
Assistant Directors, Directors, and Regional Managers.
The requirements:
• Bachelor's or Master s degree
• Charisma and high energy level
• Strong interest in education and business
• Must have a heart for kids
