# Advising the pros
## Final report by SAGUE released 
### Shirley Park Staff writer 
Completing more than six
months of work, the Student Advi
sory Group on Undergraduate Ed
ucation yesterday submitted their
final report to the Commission on
Undergraduate Education.
Created last October out of a

desire to increase
student input to
the commission,
the group pro
posed recom
mendations
spanning areas of
concern in un
dergraduate edu
cation — includ
ing the academic

calendar, academic environment,
distribution and language re
quirements, and majors.
Often pushing beyond the sta
tus quo, among the advisory
group's major suggestions were
more frequent interaction be
tween students and faculty, a re
modeling of the Cultures, Ideas
and Values tracks, and modifica
tions of the academic calendar to
include two "Dead Days" each
quarter.
"We accomplished our ultimate
goal: to create opportunities for
student voices to be heard and to
report this to the commission,"
said senior Eddie Garcia, chair of
the group's steering committee.
The report also suggested ex
pansion of discussion sections in
the Cultures, Ideas and Values
program to 60 percent of the
course despite the increased fund
ing this would entail.
"If the funding is not available,
the commission should reconsider
whether the existing course mer-


Goh
its 15 units of every freshman's
year," the report states.
In the area of distribution
requirements, the report suggest
ed requiring a two-quarter natu
ral science sequence, and two
courses each from the social sci
ences and humanities. The report
also "strongly recommended" the
creation of a minor.
The advisory group's proposal
of a two-quarter natural science
sequence differs from the three
quarter sequence proposal cur
rently under discussion by the
commission. However, according
to Garcia, the two-groups see

mostly eye-to-eye on other ques
tions of breadth.
The advisory group's steering
committee primarily culled
reports from students who were
on the commission's subcommit
tees to reach a consensus. In cases
where dissension arose, as in the
debate over semesters vs. quar
ters, the advisory group chose
neutrality.
"Our mission is to represent
the students' opinion. If there
was no clear student voice we
were not prepared to take a
stand," said Garcia.
Garcia said he was uncertain of
the advisory group's impact on
the commission's final proposals,
but he noted that the commission
"has been receptive so far."
Because students who were on

the commission subcommittees
were also members of the adviso
ry group's steering committee,
the two groups communicated
well, said Council of Presidents
liaison Ying-Ying Goh, a senior.
"The report is a summary of
the discussion which has been
continuing all year within the
subcommittees," said Goh. "[The
report] shouldn't contain many
surprises."
In the area of academic envi
ronment, the report spoke of
implementing formal advising
associate training and evaluation.
The academic environment
subcommittee report focused on
what was "most problematic,"
namely the advising system,
explained senior Diana Cardenas,
a commission subcommittee

member.
Steps toward improving sopho
more advising were suggested,
such as a spring quarter meeting
between the advising associate,
adviser and freshman to "encour
age the transition to the sopho
more year," according to Garcia.
The report leaned toward
slight modifications of the aca
demic calendar. It spoke for a
mandatory "Sophomore Sum
mer," where to-be juniors would
arrive in September and embark
on an intensive seminar within
their major.
This would provide a "timely
solution" to the problem of class
disunity, said sophomore Smeeta
Ramarathnam, a commission
subcommittee representative.
The report also proposed

establishing two "Dead Days" —
in which no classes would be held
or assignments due — and begin
ning autumn quarter one week
early to accommodate three full
weeks of winter break.
"Having a true Dead Week is
unrealistic in a quarter system,"
said Garcia. "The two Dead Days
are a compromise, and definitely
do-able."
The advisory group hopes that
its report will influence the com
mission, and possibly the Faculty
Senate in the long-term.
However, "the value is not nec
essarily in the report," said Goh.
"More importantly, it vocalizes
what students have been con
cerned about, and hopefully it will
stimulate further discussion for
the goal of improving undergrad

uate education."
The group supported a writ
ing- and research-intensive senior
project requirement within a
major. "There is no question that
people who have been involved in
one-on-one study with a faculty
member have found it to be the
highlight of a Stanford educa
tion," the report stated.
The group also recommended
creating a Dean of Undergraduate
Education "to deal solely with
improving the quality of under
graduate education," the creation
of minors and a continuing com
mitment to residential education.
The report also states that the
group does not support a three
year degree program "because edu
cation at Stanford has never been
limited to completion of a major."

the group's steering committee.
The report also suggested ex
pansion of discussion sections in
the Cultures, Ideas and Values
program to 60 percent of the
course despite the increased fund
ing this would entail.
"If the funding is not available,
the commission should reconsider
whether the existing course mer-

its 15 units of every freshman's
year," the report states.
In the area of distribution
requirements, the report suggest
ed requiring a two-quarter natu
ral science sequence, and two
courses each from the social sci
ences and humanities. The report
also "strongly recommended" the
creation of a minor.
The advisory group's proposal
of a two-quarter natural science
sequence differs from the three
quarter sequence proposal cur
rently under discussion by the
commission. However, according
to Garcia, the two-groups see

mostly eye-to-eye on other ques
tions of breadth.
The advisory group's steering
committee primarily culled
reports from students who were
on the commission's subcommit
tees to reach a consensus. In cases
where dissension arose, as in the
debate over semesters vs. quar
ters, the advisory group chose
neutrality.
"Our mission is to represent
the students' opinion. If there
was no clear student voice we
were not prepared to take a
stand," said Garcia.
Garcia said he was uncertain of
the advisory group's impact on
the commission's final proposals,
but he noted that the commission
"has been receptive so far."
Because students who were on

the commission subcommittees
were also members of the adviso
ry group's steering committee,
the two groups communicated
well, said Council of Presidents
liaison Ying-Ying Goh, a senior.
"The report is a summary of
the discussion which has been
continuing all year within the
subcommittees," said Goh. "[The
report] shouldn't contain many
surprises."
In the area of academic envi
ronment, the report spoke of
implementing formal advising
associate training and evaluation.
The academic environment
subcommittee report focused on
what was "most problematic,"
namely the advising system,
explained senior Diana Cardenas,
a commission subcommittee

member.
Steps toward improving sopho
more advising were suggested,
such as a spring quarter meeting
between the advising associate,
adviser and freshman to "encour
age the transition to the sopho
more year," according to Garcia.
The report leaned toward
slight modifications of the aca
demic calendar. It spoke for a
mandatory "Sophomore Sum
mer," where to-be juniors would
arrive in September and embark
on an intensive seminar within
their major.
This would provide a "timely
solution" to the problem of class
disunity, said sophomore Smeeta
Ramarathnam, a commission
subcommittee representative.
The report also proposed

establishing two "Dead Days" —
in which no classes would be held
or assignments due — and begin
ning autumn quarter one week
early to accommodate three full
weeks of winter break.
"Having a true Dead Week is
unrealistic in a quarter system,"
said Garcia. "The two Dead Days
are a compromise, and definitely
do-able."
The advisory group hopes that
its report will influence the com
mission, and possibly the Faculty
Senate in the long-term.
However, "the value is not nec
essarily in the report," said Goh.
"More importantly, it vocalizes
what students have been con
cerned about, and hopefully it will
stimulate further discussion for
the goal of improving undergrad

uate education."
The group supported a writ
ing- and research-intensive senior
project requirement within a
major. "There is no question that
people who have been involved in
one-on-one study with a faculty
member have found it to be the
highlight of a Stanford educa
tion," the report stated.
The group also recommended
creating a Dean of Undergraduate
Education "to deal solely with
improving the quality of under
graduate education," the creation
of minors and a continuing com
mitment to residential education.
The report also states that the
group does not support a three
year degree program "because edu
cation at Stanford has never been
limited to completion of a major."
