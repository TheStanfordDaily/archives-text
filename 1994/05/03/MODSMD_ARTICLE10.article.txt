Kevorkian acquitted
DETROIT (AP) — Dr. Jack Kevorkian
was acquitted yesterday of breaking Michi
gan s assisted suicide law after a jury con
cluded he was only trying to help a gravely
ill man end his suffering, not cause his
death.
After the verdict, the 65-year-old retired
pathologist challenged doctors who have
secretly supported his crusade to go public.
"I know there are doctors who want to
come forward," the self-styled death doctor
said. "I want this intimidation by medical
politicians to stop."
Kevorkian also said he is still receiving
letters from sick people who want his help,
but refused to say whether he would
resume his assisted suicide practice any
time soon.
"I think this opens the floodgates for
.Jack Kevorkian," said one of Kevorkian's
most vocal opponents, Lynn Mills of the
anti-abortion group Operation Rescue.
Kevorkian was charged in the Aug. 4
death of Thomas Hyde, 30, who suffered
from the degenerative nerve disorder Lou
Gehrig's disease.

By the time Kevorkian hooked Hyde up
to a canister of carbon monoxide on a mat
tress in the back of his old, rusty van, Hyde
could barely walk, talk or feed himself.
Court rules on drug testing
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Supreme
Court refused yesterday to let the Univer
sity of Colorado require random drug test
ing for its athletes, trainers, managers and
cheerleaders.
The justices, without comment, left
intact a 1986 Colorado Supreme Court rul
ing that the tests violated the right of pri
vacy under the U.S. Constitution.
The school has not conducted random
tests since an initial court ruling went
against CU. "What we've been doing right
now is what we can do through the NCAA
and the Big Eight," said CU sports infor
mation spokesman Dave Plati.
The court action, although not a deci
sion on the constitutionality of the univer
sity's invalidated drug-testing program,
could hamper other state-run schools'
efforts to keep their athletic programs
drug-free.
