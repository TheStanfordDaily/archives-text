## Nelson Mandela proclaims victory 'Free at last!' declares South Africa's first black president 
### 
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa
(AP) — Nelson Mandela proclaimed vic
tory yesterday in his lifetime crusade: a
non-racial democracy for South Africa.
As his supporters let loose in ecstatic
celebration, the nation's first black
president declared, "Free at last!"
"This is indeed a joyous night for the
human spirit. This is your victory too,"
said the beaming 75-year-old leader, his
eyes glistening.
Supporters shrieked with joy in a
hotel ballroom draped in the green
gold-and-black colors of Mandela's
African National Congress. The cele
brations spilled over into the black dis
tricts of Soweto and Alexandra, where
thousands of people poured into the
streets dancing ecstatically, laughing
and waving ANC flags.
Mandela himself joined in the jubila
tion — dancing across a hotel stage
with Coretta Scott King, widow of U.S.
civil rights leader Martin Luther King
Jr., and former Zambian President
Kenneth Kaunda in tow. In the back
ground, a choir sang the praises of

"Madiba," Mandela's traditional clan
name.
Earlier, President F.W. de Klerk of
the National Party acknowledged defeat
in South Africa's first democratic elec
tions. He praised Mandela, the onetime
political prisoner, as "a man of destiny"
and pledged to work with him in the
new government of national unity
scheduled to be installed in eight days.
Mandela in turn congratulated de
Klerk "for the many days, weeks and
months and the four years that we have
worked together, quarreled, addressed
sensitive problems, and at the end of
our heated exchanges were able to
shake hands and to drink coffee."
The two leaders navigated the coun
try through an extraordinary transition
in which an oppressive white minority
surrendered its privileges to the black
majority. Both sides promised to for
give the past and build one nation.
In a symbol of that remarkable spir
it, ANC officials stood before their new
national flag and raised their glasses in
a toast in honor of outgoing President

de Klerk, incoming President Mandela
and the "new South Africa."
"I stand before you filled with deep
pride and joy — pride in the ordinary,
humble people of this country," said
Mandela, savoring the moment. "You
have shown such a calm, patient deter
mination to reclaim this country as your
own. And joy that we can loudly pro
claim from the rooftops — free at last!"
Although ballot officials remained
less than halfway through the count
ing, an ANC landslide was indisputable.
With about 44 percent of the esti
mated 22.7 million votes counted, the
ANC had 62.6 percent to 23.7 percent
for de Klerk's National Party. The Zulu
nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party was
a distant third with 6.2 percent, fol
lowed by the pro-apartheid Freedom
Front with 2.8 percent.
The ANC was projected to win
around 240 seats in the new 400-seat
Parliament, which will select Mandela
as president Friday. On May 10, he will
be inaugurated at a ceremony attended
by world leaders.
