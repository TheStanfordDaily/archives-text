## Editorial Requiring coherence Recommendation to add writing course threatens to hurt CUE consistency 
### 
Coherence within the
major. Relevance among
other courses. More orga
nized exposure to science for
humanities majors. A progression of
courses. A capstone experience in
the senior year.
So far, so good.
Up to this point, subcommittees of
the Commission on Undergraduate
Education have followed a coherent
set of guiding principles like these.
Commission members have not
been afraid to face the hard questions
in their work: How well do the distri
bution requirements really meet
Stanford's mission? What are the real
drawbacks to the DRs? What needs to
be done to avoid mandating an inco
herent "smattering of courses"?
Unfortunately, parts of the recom
mendation of the Dean of Humani
ties and Sciences' subcommittee on
Writing and Critical Thinking are
inconsistent with the commission's
previous recommendations, and
threaten to weaken the coherence of
the commission's final report.
Although the commission "gener
ally endorsed" the report of the sub
committee last week, commission
members need to re-examine its
specifics. The report recommended
that students take a writing-inten
sive class within their major as well
as the unchanged Writing and Criti
cal Thinking class.
In The Daily's November poll on
undergraduate education, the Fresh
man English program, now known
as Writing and Critical Thinking,
was among the top six topics that
students felt the commission should
evaluate. Students often express con
cerns that the program does not
teach writing skills that are relevant
to their own fields of study.
The subcommittee, which includ
ed no student members, suggested

that the program is fine the way it is.
Geology Prof. Gail Mahood, who
serves on the subcommittee, has sug
gested that "if something isn't broke,
you don't fix it." The real question,
however, is whether the Writing and
Critical Thinking program fits with
the commission's proposals for a rel
evant and flexible curriculum.
Instead of finding ways to make
the Writing and Critical Thinking
program more relevant, the subcom
mittee only suggested that the "Writ
ing Across the Curriculum" program
— which currently works with pro
fessors and teaching assistants in
various disciplines to develop writ
ing-intensive classes — should be
expanded and required of all majors.
For the commission's purposes,
expanding the "Writing Across the
Curriculum" program is an excel
lent suggestion that merits serious
consideration. It supports the idea
that varying aspects of a student's
education should be closely inte
grated and grow from each other.
History Prof. James Sheehan, chair
of the commission, has pointed out
that "there is no abstract quality
called writing, but writing about a
particular subject for a particular
purpose." This fits with the com
mission's philosophy.
Should the change be adopted,
however, the Writing and Critical
Thinking requirement would
become a superfluous requirement
from the "old school" of incoherent
DRs. And keeping it would ignore
the extra burden that two writing
requirements would place on tech
nical majors.
Supporters of the Writing and
Critical Thinking program have
often pointed out that "composition"
should be recognized as a separate
discipline students should be exposed
to. But commission members have
seen the danger in increasing the dis
tribution requirements to cover
every new discipline without regard
for the whole educational experience.
For the sake of its own consisten
cy, the commission should review the
proposal to increase the number of
writing requirements before it issues
its report.
