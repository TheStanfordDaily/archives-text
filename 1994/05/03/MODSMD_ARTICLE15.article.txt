## A 						kid's Christmas in July 
### 
EVERY YEAR on July 3, to break the
elementary school monotony of
summer, my father and I — both
longtime Chicago residents — made an
illicit run to the Indiana border to buy fire
works. As soon as I entered the store my
eyes would glaze over, becoming as wide as
Dave Kingman's strike zone. Sensing that
I'd start grabbing enough Soviet artillery
shells to make Beavis cackle with glee, my
father began to lecture me about how he
had seen people come into his emergency
room with their arms blown off and faces
burnt to a crisp.
Undaunted, I nodded my head, thinking
to myself that those people probably ate
the damn firecrackers and, shucks, plastic
surgery had come a long way anyway. If I
began to whistle in awe, my father would
threaten me with an arranged marriage
and tell me that my wife wouldn't let me
watch the "Dukes of Hazard." Needless to
say, I stopped immediately.
But then there was the point when my
father ceased being cautious. Soon, he too
was age nine again, relishing the thought
of putting that M-80 up a cow's wazoo. He
forgot about decapitations and missing dig
its.
In my father's world, kids held fire
crackers in their hands until the last possi
ble second and then — an instant until dis
embowelment — they would chuck the
explosive into the nearest moving object. If
they were slow, of course, the thing blew
up in their hands — unless, as my dad

would point out, the firecrackers were
those pathetic Chinese ones, not the quali
ty Indian fireworks which really give you
that Russian roulette feel.
After drifting back to reality, my father
would shudder and put down that shell he
had been coveting, mumbling something
about going to the temple. In the end,
however, we always bought enough fire
power to wipe out several small Third
World nations. As we trundled our contra
band across the border, I remember look
ing out the window imagining the clouds
were battleships — until my father told
me to get my head back inside the car.
Man, if my wife wouldn't let me watch my
favorite r I"V show, she'd never let me do
anything.
When we got home, my mother would
raise an eyebrow and tell us about some
unfortunate cousin who, while playing
with fireworks, burned down his house. At
that point, my father would think "Well,
it's her side of the family." I would wonder
if my mother was cool and somehow
involved in that incident.
Eventually, she'd get over it. If she men
tioned anything to my father, he would
enter his tirade about how the U.S. was a
free country and how he sailed on a boat
for three months to escape the tyranny of
his native land. Before he broke out into
Yankee Doodle, my mother would remind
the Indian Walter Mitty that his voyage to
America was aboard a Swissair 747. And
then my mom would see the big rocket that

was labeled "Pulverizer and Demolisher of
Mars" and say, "Let's light that one first."
I finally understood what my parents
had in common: an insane desire to send
explosive projectiles in every direction.
Wow. Maybe an arranged marriage
wouldn't be so bad as long as I didn't have
to marry any of the girls in my Gujarati
language class who endlessly made fun of
my haircut.
When the barrage started, no one was
safe. After the first couple of minutes,
rockets were flying all over the place. I
would run around lighting the fuses a la
Abu Nidal. They would go on the neigh
bor's roof, sear the fur off curious squirrels
and occasionally fly through our screen
door. My father would dash as fast as pos
sible to light the next rocket, sending it
into the neighbor's tomato patch; my
mother would play with my brother and
sparklers.
When the fun ended, we'd be tucked
into bed with a full complement of limbs,
singed eyebrows and the odor of sulfur. As
I dozed off into the sleep that only nine
year-olds can have, the only worry on my
mind was when my dad was going to take
me to a Cubs game.

Atrnan hopes that his arranged bruie will
not be a Sox fan.
