## Kennedy points out importance of prudent budgeting 
### 
MATTHEW MIZEL has sur
faced an important issue in
his "Friday forum" column
last Friday — and it has a context
much broader than university endow
ments. Economists have begun to give
serious attention to a matter that has
concerned environmental scientists
for some time: when we harvest a cap
ital resource of limited renewability,
how much should we take for present
use and how much should we con
serve for the future? For the Stanford
endowment no less than for, say,
energy resources, this question is fun
damental to the entire idea of sustain
ability.
I have not recalculated Mizel's
numbers regarding payout, inflation
and reinvestment. But they look about

right; it is clear that the Stanford
endowment in the period 1980-1992
gained very substantially in real value.
As I remember the numbers, the real
worth of the endowment over this
period increased by around $800 mil
lion, and the portion directly support
ing the operating budget by about
$300 million.
Stanford's performance in this area
was very strong in comparison with
peer institutions for three reasons.
First, we held to a stern payout disci
pline. Second, our fund-raising record
was outstanding. And finally, our
investment performance was near the
top of the group of comparable private
research universities.
But alas, we cannot attribute to
these accomplishments a major role in

our success — and that brings us back
to the central issue. The last dozen
years have been marked by truly
extraordinary performance in the cap
ital markets, and this has been the
main factor in the growth of endow
ments everywhere. The payout formu
la in use at Stanford and most other
comparable places recognizes that
business is inherently cyclical, and
that there will be bad times as well as
good.
Mizel observes, quite correctly, that
in the past decade the formula has
returned to the endowment a portion
of total return that actually increases
the endowment's purchasing power.
What he fails to note is that in leaner
times — and they will surely come
again — the formula will appear to

return to little.
Stanford is thus caught in a bloom
of apparent endowment prosperity. It
is terribly tempting to conclude that
this is because we have been following
a policy that favors the future against
the present. That is a possibility;
economists have not yet devised a for
mula that will balance those interests
with precision, and further study of
that issue is something we need. But
Stanford's trustees are showing prop
er caution in sticking with a formula
that should favor the future in good
times and the present in bad — a posi
tion taken by prudent fiduciaries in
virtually every public trust known to
me.
