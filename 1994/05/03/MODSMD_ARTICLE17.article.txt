# Responses to video on grape boycott showed intolerance of campus
## 
### 
We are repulsed and appalled by the
racist reaction of our fellow students on
Sunday evening when, in honor of
Cinco de Mayo, we showed the United
Farm Workers' video "No Grapes" at
Sunday's 10 p.m. Flicks. We did this in
order to inform ourselves and the rest
of the Stanford community about the
situation facing this country's agricul
tural workers, including many of our
friends and family. For years, we have
asked Stanford Dining Service, fellow
students and the administration to sup
port the nation-wide grape boycott, all
to no avail.
It pains us that Stanford is one of
the few major universities in California
still serving grapes on campus. We had
hoped that this was merely a misunder
standing and that if our peers could be
informed about the situation they

would support us and our community
in this endeavor.
Sunday evening, we understood bet
ter than ever the racist attitudes of our
peers toward our struggles and con
cerns â€” attitudes that carry further
than a Sunday night movie. Though
some in attendance supported what
they saw, the 10-minute video short
shown before "Mrs. Doubtfire" brought
out the worst in many of the people in
the audience.
While we were hoping for open
minds, what we witnessed were callous
creatures acting out of brazen hate and
racism, quite a hypocrisy on a campus
that claims to be so tolerant and accept
ing. Such a display is seemingly quite
easy in the dark being that ignorance
moves in droves. For those who were
trying to listen, the video was inaudible
over shouts of "Fast forward!" and "Go
home, beaners!" Whenever an image of
a helicopter spraying farm workers was
shown, many students applauded,
yelling "Yes, pesticides!"
We never thought that we would
have to explain to hundreds of our fel

low students that the situation within
our farm working communities is no
laughing matter. Many of those at
Stanford are from areas like those por
trayed in the video. High levels of can
cer, miscarriage and birth defects in our
very own families are not cause for
singing or clapping.
While we understand that Flicks is a
time for fun, many of us feel that we
have no other forum for informing stu
dents of the situation. Our petitions go
unnoticed, programs are unattended,
and administrative ears turn deaf to
this grave matter.
Ten minutes on a Sunday night was
all we asked for. What we were subject
ed to was 10 minutes of intolerance and
hate. We never thought, at this institu
tion, that an image of a boy born with
no arms and no legs projected on the
Memorial Auditorium video screen
would be welcomed with shouts of
vicious laughter.
Most frighteningly, these beasts sit
ting in the balcony, who were tamed
only when the cartoon came on, are the
future leaders of this nation.
