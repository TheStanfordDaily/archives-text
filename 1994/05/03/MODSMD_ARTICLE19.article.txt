# N'Gai Croal: fly in the buttermilk
## confessions of an aspiring black hip-hop writer 
### 
I'M NOT ANGRY. If 1 really were
angry, I wouldn't be writing this col
umn.
I never smile in the line of fire / / go
wilding / but it's on bass and drums
even violins
My name is N'Gai and I am a black
hip-hop journalist.
when 1 get mad/I put it down on a
pad /give you something that you never
had
Black hip-hop journalism, like the art
it reflects, is not about open displays of
anger. MCs don't trash their micro
phones. DJs don't break their turntables
or shatter their records. Nor is hip-hop
about angst. When was the last time you
heard an MC scream "stay away" at the
top of his or her lungs?
hate me / do it again and again
Black hip-hop journalism, like the
music that spawned it, is about the rela
tionship between storyteller and listen
er, between MC and audience, between
writer and reader. Here, The Word is of
paramount importance. Neither the

word processor nor the gun, neither the
newspaper nor the record lahel can carry
the writer/MC to success. He or she lives
and dies by The Word.
schizophrenic tenant number one
when it comes to housing
arousing the intellect
with introspect
flex on me — huh?
I don't think so — yet
— Saafir "That Bullshit"
Often, this relationship is based on a
wall of cool that separates the writer
from the reader. The writer and the MC
share a certain desire to keep the read
er/listener at a distance, to not reveal too
much of themselves, to hide their weak
nesses and shortcomings behind a veil of
substance and carefully calculated style.
how can you know where I'm at / when
you haven't been where I've been? / under
stand where I'm comin' from?
At its worst, the story passes through
the listener with no noticeable effect.

This type of story may have an initial
impact on the reader/listener, but its
meager pleasures are soon forgotten.
come on baby / kick those
dazzeys / look at those girls with the
dazzey duks on
At its best, the storyteller communi
cates not only the story, but refuses to
hide behind the words. By risking a
moment or more of vulnerability, he or
she surrenders the power of The Word
and shares it with the reader/listener.
I can still hear the screams
of his mother
while my nigga
lay dead in the gutter
and it's gettin' to my temple
why's that the only time
black folks get to ride
in a limo?
—Ice Cube, "Dead Homiez"
Out of these moments of introspec
tion come hip-hop's — and by extension,
hip-hop journalism's — greatest pieces
of work. The open displays of anger one

might expect to find are turned inward,
lyrically speaking. While the music, like
Public Enemy's "wall of sound" or Dr.
Dre's insidious sirens and snares, often
retains a fiercely disturbing power, the
lyrics probe the MC's soul — much like
the finest examples of rock music.
daddy didn't notice / that mother
didn't care
For example, the following lyrics from
the Geto Boys' "My Mind's Playing
Tricks on Me" could easily have
described the final days of Nirvana lead
singer Kurt Cobain — but for the way
the four man crew kicks their rhymes.
1 often drift when I drive
having fatal thoughts of suicide
bang and get it over with
and then I'm worry-free
but that's bullshit
I got a little boy to look after
and if I die then my child'll be a bastard
Where Cobain alternated hoarse
screams with eerily soothing whispers,

Mr. Scarface et. al. deliver their night
marish verses in the flat, world-weary
style of film noir narration. Where
"Smells Like Teen Spirit" lashed out at
society, "Tricks on Me" displays a fatal
ism that can't be bothered to fight back.
But to surrender to fatalism is to sur
render the power of The Word once and
for all, which the black hip-hop writer
cannot do. He or she is born out of a ten
sion between the fighting spirit and
fatalism. And it is that tension, directed
at the self, and sublimated into The
Word, that the black hip-hop writer taps
into to create his — or her — art.
Schizophrenic Tenant Number One,
indeed.
black to the bone / my home is your
home / but welcome to the terrordome

N'Gai would like to thank Public
Enemy, Cypress Hill, Pearl Jam, Duice
and Webster's New World Dictionary for
making this piece possible.

didn't care
For example, the following lyrics from
the Geto Boys' "My Mind's Playing
Tricks on Me" could easily have
described the final days of Nirvana lead
singer Kurt Cobain — but for the way
the four man crew kicks their rhymes.
1 often drift when I drive
having fatal thoughts of suicide
bang and get it over with
and then I'm worry-free
but that's bullshit
I got a little boy to look after
and if I die then my child'll be a bastard
Where Cobain alternated hoarse
screams with eerily soothing whispers,

Mr. Scarface et. al. deliver their night
marish verses in the flat, world-weary
style of film noir narration. Where
"Smells Like Teen Spirit" lashed out at
society, "Tricks on Me" displays a fatal
ism that can't be bothered to fight back.
But to surrender to fatalism is to sur
render the power of The Word once and
for all, which the black hip-hop writer
cannot do. He or she is born out of a ten
sion between the fighting spirit and
fatalism. And it is that tension, directed
at the self, and sublimated into The
Word, that the black hip-hop writer taps
into to create his — or her — art.
Schizophrenic Tenant Number One,
indeed.
black to the bone / my home is your
home / but welcome to the terrordome

Enemy, Cypress Hill, Pearl Jam, Duice
and Webster's New World Dictionary for
