A fortuitous Sunday night
phone call by Brian Dallimore
inspired Stanford's sophomore
third baseman to a four-hit per
formance yesterday at Sunken
Diamond, as the No. 13 Cardi
nal baseball team snapped a
three-game losing streak with a
9-4 victory over the San Fran
cisco State Gators.
"I was struggling physically
and that carried over to the
mental part of my game," Dal
limore said. "I talked to my dad
and he said that there are some
things I can't control, that I
just had to go after the ball and
swing hard."
Dallimore controlled the
Stanford offense yesterday, lin
ing the first pitch thrown by
Gators senior starter Carlos
Blandino (3-4) to left field for a
single and later adding two sin
gles, a double, a stolen base and
three runs batted in to break a
personal 3-for-12 slump.
While the Cardinal (31-19)
did not push across a run in the
first inning, it nonetheless rose
to the standard established by
its leadoff hitter in winning for
the first time in four tries
against non-conference oppo
nents.
But victory did not come eas
ily for Stanford, as San Fran
cisco State (17-27) plated the
first run of the contest on a
wind-aided, fourth-inning lead
off home run by junior first
baseman Phil Kernan. The
Cardinal, just 7-16 when its
opposition scores first, knotted
the game in the bottom of the
frame when sophomore catcher
A.J. Hinch walked and came
around on a single up the mid
dle by junior leftfielder Steve
Carver.
Dallimore gave Stanford its
first lead in 4he fifth, lining an

RBI single to right and scoring
freshman shortstop Eric Sees,
who had walked and advanced
to second on a groundout. The
Cardinal continued to build a
picket fence on the scoreboard
in the sixth, extending its
advantage to 3-1 on another
RBI single by Carver.

As Stan
ford's offense
steadily
warmed up, a
surprise crew
of Cardinal
pitchers kept
Gators bats on
ice through
seven innings.
Junior Todd

Laßocca, a reserve infielder
who had not appeared on the
mound in two years, made the
start for head coach Mark Mar
quess. Yielding just one hit and
striking out two in two score
less innings, Laßocca
impressed several professional
scouts on hand who still seek
his pitching services.
"I had thought about using
him before, but we've pitched
so well that I haven't needed
him," Marquess said. "I'm sure
I'll use him again."
Sophomore Mike Robbins
(5-3) took over in the third, and
allowed only Kernan's homer
and three other hits in five
innings of work to pick up the
win.
After Robbins retired the
side in the top of the seventh,
Dallimore sparked a two-run
Stanford rally with an infield
single to deep shortstop. Junior
second baseman Jed Hansen
followed with a double down
the left field line to score Dal
limore, and Hansen later
scored when San Francisco
State failed to turn a double
play on a grounder by junior
first baseman Dusty Allen.


Dallimore
"As a leadoff hitter, I influence
the rest of my team," Dallimore
said. "I expect to get on base so
the guys behind me can drive me
home."
But Dallimore was later to
play the RBI man himself. After
Cardinal sophomore reliever
Mario Iglesias surrendered two
runs on three walks and two
hits in the top of the eighth,
Dallimore plated Sees and
sophomore centerfielder Cale
Carter with a scorching one-out
double down the left field line to
make it 7-3. Senior designated
hitter Nate Olmstead and Allen
then added two-out RBI singles
to round out the Stanford
attack.
Freshman reliever Tom
Reimers took over from there.
Having retired the final Gators
hitter in the eighth, the
righthander picked up his eighth
save in holding San Francisco
State to a run on an RBI single by
senior catcher Shawn Pagee in
the ninth.
"It's always big to stop a losing
streak," Marquess said.
The Cardinal looks to start a

modest winning streak tonight at
7 p.m. when it faces the San Jose
State Spartans at Municipal Sta
dium in San Jose. If you cannot

(5-3) took over in the third, and
allowed only Kernan's homer
and three other hits in five
innings of work to pick up the
win.
After Robbins retired the
side in the top of the seventh,
Dallimore sparked a two-run
Stanford rally with an infield
single to deep shortstop. Junior
second baseman Jed Hansen
followed with a double down
the left field line to score Dal
limore, and Hansen later
scored when San Francisco
State failed to turn a double
play on a grounder by junior
first baseman Dusty Allen.


Dallimore
"As a leadoff hitter, I influence
the rest of my team," Dallimore
said. "I expect to get on base so
the guys behind me can drive me
home."
But Dallimore was later to
play the RBI man himself. After
Cardinal sophomore reliever
Mario Iglesias surrendered two
runs on three walks and two
hits in the top of the eighth,
Dallimore plated Sees and
sophomore centerfielder Cale
Carter with a scorching one-out
double down the left field line to
make it 7-3. Senior designated
hitter Nate Olmstead and Allen
then added two-out RBI singles
to round out the Stanford
attack.
Freshman reliever Tom
Reimers took over from there.
Having retired the final Gators
hitter in the eighth, the
righthander picked up his eighth
save in holding San Francisco
State to a run on an RBI single by
senior catcher Shawn Pagee in
the ninth.
"It's always big to stop a losing
streak," Marquess said.
The Cardinal looks to start a

modest winning streak tonight at
7 p.m. when it faces the San Jose
State Spartans at Municipal Sta
dium in San Jose. If you cannot

A fortuitous Sunday night
phone call by Brian Dallimore
inspired Stanford's sophomore
third baseman to a four-hit per
formance yesterday at Sunken
Diamond, as the No. 13 Cardi
nal baseball team snapped a
three-game losing streak with a
9-4 victory over the San Fran
cisco State Gators.
"I was struggling physically
and that carried over to the
mental part of my game," Dal
limore said. "I talked to my dad
and he said that there are some
things I can't control, that I
just had to go after the ball and
swing hard."
Dallimore controlled the
Stanford offense yesterday, lin
ing the first pitch thrown by
Gators senior starter Carlos
Blandino (3-4) to left field for a
single and later adding two sin
gles, a double, a stolen base and
three runs batted in to break a
personal 3-for-12 slump.
While the Cardinal (31-19)
did not push across a run in the
first inning, it nonetheless rose
to the standard established by
its leadoff hitter in winning for
the first time in four tries
against non-conference oppo
nents.
But victory did not come eas
ily for Stanford, as San Fran
cisco State (17-27) plated the
first run of the contest on a
wind-aided, fourth-inning lead
off home run by junior first
baseman Phil Kernan. The
Cardinal, just 7-16 when its
opposition scores first, knotted
the game in the bottom of the
frame when sophomore catcher
A.J. Hinch walked and came
around on a single up the mid
dle by junior leftfielder Steve
Carver.
Dallimore gave Stanford its
first lead in 4he fifth, lining an

RBI single to right and scoring
freshman shortstop Eric Sees,
who had walked and advanced
to second on a groundout. The
Cardinal continued to build a
picket fence on the scoreboard
in the sixth, extending its
advantage to 3-1 on another
RBI single by Carver.

As Stan
ford's offense
steadily
warmed up, a
surprise crew
of Cardinal
pitchers kept
Gators bats on
ice through
seven innings.
Junior Todd

Laßocca, a reserve infielder
who had not appeared on the
mound in two years, made the
start for head coach Mark Mar
quess. Yielding just one hit and
striking out two in two score
less innings, Laßocca
impressed several professional
scouts on hand who still seek
his pitching services.
"I had thought about using
him before, but we've pitched
so well that I haven't needed
him," Marquess said. "I'm sure
I'll use him again."
Sophomore Mike Robbins
(5-3) took over in the third, and
allowed only Kernan's homer
and three other hits in five
innings of work to pick up the
win.
After Robbins retired the
side in the top of the seventh,
Dallimore sparked a two-run
Stanford rally with an infield
