Some athletes have immeasurable talent, but
never fulfill their potential because they lack any
kind of work ethic. Some athletes have the desire and
the effort, but lack the tools to scale the heights nec
essary to attain greatness.
Jeff Salzenstein has climbed the ladder of success
to join the tennis elite. Sometimes taking two, four
rungs at a time, the lanky sophomore has achieved his
success in a number of quick and tremendous jumps.
Just another face on the Stanford men's team last
year, Salzenstein is now among the best in college
tennis, no doubt leaving a number of tennis coaches
and fans to wonder where he came from. How did he
get so good so fast?
But its also been a slow, methodical march. Con
fronted with challenges and goals, Salzenstein has
stopped at nothing to fulfill his potential.
A lot of talent, and a lot of hard work. And it's
always been that way.
Salzenstein began playing tennis at age 5, and
started competing in tournaments at 9. Although ten
nis was just another sport for awhile, when Salzen
stein was 12, he began to look to the tennis racket
before his baseball bat or his basketball. But it wasn't
for another few years before it became apparent that
tennis would be more than just a recreational sport.
"At 12 I became serious about tennis, and I did
really well, but then I dropped off at 14 and 15,"
Salzenstein said. "At that point, I decided to commit
myself totally to tennis."
And his body decided to commit itself as well.
While Salzenstein had lacked size in the early years
of his tennis playing, at 17 he began to grow bigger
and stronger. I le now had the ability to go along with
the desire.
By the time that he was 18, Salzenstein had made
a big jump in his playing, vaulting from No. 21 the
previous year all the way to a No. 2 national ranking
in the 18-and-under junior circuit.
When it came time to choose a college, Salzen
stein, an excellent student, narrowed his choices to
Notre Dame and Stanford.
"The way that I decided was by asking myself, if
tennis doesn't work out, where would I like to be,"
Salzenstein said. "And the obvious answer is here."
Salzenstein added that at Stanford, the tennis
teams have a chance to win a national championship
every year. That success is a testament to the Stan
ford coaches who, not only figure out a way for their
team to win each season, but care and support their
players as individuals. With that fact in mind,
Salzenstein headed for Stanford.
