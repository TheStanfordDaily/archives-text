## Salzenstein jumps to head of class Off-season training helps sophomore make move from No. 6 to No. 2 singles spot

Some athletes have immeasurable talent, but
never fulfill their potential because they lack any
kind of work ethic. Some athletes have the desire and
the effort, but lack the tools to scale the heights nec
essary to attain greatness.
Jeff Salzenstein has climbed the ladder of success
to join the tennis elite. Sometimes taking two, four
rungs at a time, the lanky sophomore has achieved his
success in a number of quick and tremendous jumps.
Just another face on the Stanford men's team last
year, Salzenstein is now among the best in college
tennis, no doubt leaving a number of tennis coaches
and fans to wonder where he came from. How did he
get so good so fast?
But its also been a slow, methodical march. Con
fronted with challenges and goals, Salzenstein has
stopped at nothing to fulfill his potential.
A lot of talent, and a lot of hard work. And it's
always been that way.
Salzenstein began playing tennis at age 5, and
started competing in tournaments at 9. Although ten
nis was just another sport for awhile, when Salzen
stein was 12, he began to look to the tennis racket
before his baseball bat or his basketball. But it wasn't
for another few years before it became apparent that
tennis would be more than just a recreational sport.
"At 12 I became serious about tennis, and I did
really well, but then I dropped off at 14 and 15,"
Salzenstein said. "At that point, I decided to commit
myself totally to tennis."
And his body decided to commit itself as well.
While Salzenstein had lacked size in the early years
of his tennis playing, at 17 he began to grow bigger
and stronger. I le now had the ability to go along with
the desire.
By the time that he was 18, Salzenstein had made
a big jump in his playing, vaulting from No. 21 the
previous year all the way to a No. 2 national ranking
in the 18-and-under junior circuit.
When it came time to choose a college, Salzen
stein, an excellent student, narrowed his choices to
Notre Dame and Stanford.
"The way that I decided was by asking myself, if
tennis doesn't work out, where would I like to be,"
Salzenstein said. "And the obvious answer is here."
Salzenstein added that at Stanford, the tennis
teams have a chance to win a national championship
every year. That success is a testament to the Stan
ford coaches who, not only figure out a way for their
team to win each season, but care and support their
players as individuals. With that fact in mind,
Salzenstein headed for Stanford.

Battling inexperience on a senior-loaded Cardinal squad, sophomore Jeff Salzenstein
has developed into one of the top players in the country.
But with five juniors and two
other sophomores on the team,
Salzenstein was once again at the
bottom of the ladder, and his
opponents got tougher.
"Last year, I had to fight for
every point, both in my service
game and when returning serve,"
Salzenstein said. "I had no big
shot to go to."
Although he finished the year
with a team-best 20-4 record in
dual matches, mostly at fifth sin
gles, Salzenstein was not satisfied
with his game.
"I went home for the summer,
and wanted to improve my
game," Salzenstein said. "I didn't
play in many tournaments, and
decided to work to improve my
serve."
Day after day, the Englewood,
Colo, resident would serve bas
kets upon baskets of tennis balls,
and worked hard on his volley.
However, with a deficit of good
players to hit with in Colorado,
Salzenstein's overall game got a
little rusty.
To complicate matters, shortly
after returning to campus in
September, Salzenstein sprained
his ankle. With little match expe
rience over the summer, and with
the early injury, surely the sopho
more would have to wait another
year before making the next big
jump in his game.
Wrong. Salzenstein was ready.
"(Salzenstein] is in the process

of making a big jump in his game,
largely because of a vastly
improved serve," said Stanford
head tennis coach Dick Gould
before the beginning of the regu
lar season. "He is a definite
threat to move substantially
higher in this year's lineup and to
prove himself one of the top play
ers in all of college tennis."
To begin the year, the sopho
more teamed up with senior
Vimal Patel to win the Rolex Nor-
Cal doubles championship. Then,
following preseason tournaments
and practices, Salzenstein
jumped from the No. 5 singles
slot all the way up to No. 2. And
the move has benefited the team
immeasurably.
As his team has played to a 22-
2 record, Salzenstein sports an
impressive 21-3 dual match
record for the year, almost entire
ly at the difficult second spot.
"Right now, my serve and vol
ley are my strengths, and it has
been a lot easier to win matches
this year," Salzenstein said. "I've
been playing matches with a lot
of confidence. Every match, I feel
that I've been in a position to
win."
Each of the three matches that
Salzenstein has lost this year has
gone to three sets, and it is that
sort of never-say-die attitude that
has given Salzenstein the record
and success that he has attained
in 1994.
"My goal for the year has been
to be more consistent," Salzen
stein said. "Day in and day out,
I've been trying to be consistent
on every point and every game.

And I haven't gotten blown out."
Far from it. With victories
such as his two wins over UCLA's
Sebastian Leßlanc and his two
wins over USC's 14th-ranked Jon
Leach in Stanford's two team
losses, Salzenstein lias proven to
indeed be one of the top players in
college tennis. Y«'t, the rankings
haven't reflected this success.
But Salzenstein, whose No. 36
ranking is his highest of the sea
son, doesn't let the rankings
bother him too much.
"It's a little frustrating, but
the only thing it affects is getting
into [the NCAA singles champi
onship drawj," said Salzenstein,
who will most likely receive an
invitation to play for the singles
title. "The biggest goal is just to
get out there every match and do
what I can to help the team win.
All that other stuff will follow."
With his talent, his desire and
his work ethic, there is no telling
what the future can hold for
Salzenstein in tennis. A leader
ship role on next year's young
team? A national title in singles
or doubles, or for the team?
Salzenstein is certain that this
year's squad is capable of being in
position to win the title in three
weeks.
And what about after college is
over?
"I'd definitely like to play pro
fessional tennis," Salzenstein
said. "Maybe do that for a few
years, see how that goes. Who
knows?"
Perhaps the tennis world bet
ter brace itself. Jeff Salzenstein
may be getting ready for another
couple of jumps.
