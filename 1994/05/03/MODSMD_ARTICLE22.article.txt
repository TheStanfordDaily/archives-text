# Cardinal boats nab two first places
## Sailing team qualifies for all three national championships 
### Jeremy Stone Staff writer 
Stanford completed a sailing
trifecta this weekend when it
qualified for the Team Race and
Co-ed Dinghy National Champi
onships. After securing a berth
in the Women's Nationals last
weekend, the Cardinal will now
participate in all three sailing
national championships for the
first time in more than a decade.
The easier regatta was the
Pacific Coast Team Race Cham
pionship, held in Redwood City
last Friday. As the host school
and fifth-ranked team in the
nation, Stanford came in as "the
obvious favorite," according to

director of sailing Blake Middle
ton. However, the Cardinal had
to defeat five of the top 16 teams
in the country to win the PCCs
for the second year in a row.
After a preliminary round
robin among all seven teams,
the three squads with the poor
est scores were eliminated. No.
11 Long Beach State, No. 16
USC and unranked Cal Poly-
SLO watched as the other four
schools engaged in a double
round-robin for the title.
Stanford was at 5-1 after a
loss to No. 9 UC-Irvine in the
preliminaries. The Anteaters
were also 5-1 after a loss to No.
15 Hawaii and looked to be
Stanford's only major threat in

the finals.
But the Cardinal took both
races from Irvine and ended up
5-1 in the double round-robin,
losing only once to Hawaii after
two of the three Cardinal boats
started prematurely. The 10-2
overall record gave Stanford the
regatta by one race over 9-3
Irvine. No. 12 California placed
third with a 6-6 mark, and
Hawaii ended up fourth at 5-7.
"We lost a real tight race and
a mental error race [the loss
caused by premature startsl,
but basically still were the clear
class of the regatta, no question
about it," said Middleton.
Stanford's top team was led,
as usual, by senior skipper Scott

Sellers, with seniors Britt John
son and Sujata Patel serving as
his crew. Stanford's second
team was junior skipper Charles
Meade, who was coming off a
stellar performance the week
before in the Thompson Trophy
Intersectional, and his crew,
freshman Letitia Yang. Senior
Jeremy Mclntyre skippered
with freshman crew Don Chen
navasin and Alice Manard for
the Cardinal's final team.
By placing in the top two,
both UC-Irvine and Stanford
will represent the Pacific Coast
region in the Team Race
