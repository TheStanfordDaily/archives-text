# Cardinal boats nab two first places
## Sailing team qualifies for all three national championships 
### Jeremy Stone Staff writer 
Stanford completed a sailing
trifecta this weekend when it
qualified for the Team Race and
Co-ed Dinghy National Champi
onships. After securing a berth
in the Women's Nationals last
weekend, the Cardinal will now
participate in all three sailing
national championships for the
first time in more than a decade.
The easier regatta was the
Pacific Coast Team Race Cham
pionship, held in Redwood City
last Friday. As the host school
and fifth-ranked team in the
nation, Stanford came in as "the
obvious favorite," according to

director of sailing Blake Middle
ton. However, the Cardinal had
to defeat five of the top 16 teams
in the country to win the PCCs
for the second year in a row.
After a preliminary round
robin among all seven teams,
the three squads with the poor
est scores were eliminated. No.
11 Long Beach State, No. 16
USC and unranked Cal Poly-
SLO watched as the other four
schools engaged in a double
round-robin for the title.
Stanford was at 5-1 after a
loss to No. 9 UC-Irvine in the
preliminaries. The Anteaters
were also 5-1 after a loss to No.
15 Hawaii and looked to be
Stanford's only major threat in

the finals.
But the Cardinal took both
races from Irvine and ended up
5-1 in the double round-robin,
losing only once to Hawaii after
two of the three Cardinal boats
started prematurely. The 10-2
overall record gave Stanford the
regatta by one race over 9-3
Irvine. No. 12 California placed
third with a 6-6 mark, and
Hawaii ended up fourth at 5-7.
"We lost a real tight race and
a mental error race [the loss
caused by premature startsl,
but basically still were the clear
class of the regatta, no question
about it," said Middleton.
Stanford's top team was led,
as usual, by senior skipper Scott

Sellers, with seniors Britt John
son and Sujata Patel serving as
his crew. Stanford's second
team was junior skipper Charles
Meade, who was coming off a
stellar performance the week
before in the Thompson Trophy
Intersectional, and his crew,
freshman Letitia Yang. Senior
Jeremy Mclntyre skippered
with freshman crew Don Chen
navasin and Alice Manard for
the Cardinal's final team.
By placing in the top two,
both UC-Irvine and Stanford
will represent the Pacific Coast
region in the Team Race
National Championships May
30-June 1 in New London,
Conn. The Cardinal will be there
for the ninth consecutive year.
The competition was much
tighter at the Dinghy PCCs in
Alameda Saturday and Sunday.
The outcome of the regatta,
unfortunately, was not decided
on the water. Rather, a protest
committee held the fates of 11
schools in its hands.
After the actual sailing had
taken place, UC-Irvine led the
regatta with Stanford and Cal
tied for the all-important second
and final qualifying spot. Long
Beach State also had an outside
chance to move into the top two.
However, the protest commit
tee shook up the standings when
it disqualified UC-Irvine from
one race and awarded California
points for one race because of
broken equipment (the average

score, rather than the last-place
total, was awarded to Cal for
that race).
After this, the host Golden
Bears were declared the win
ners with 71 points. The Cardi
nal was a mere three points in
back with 74, and UC-Irvine
was out of the running with
75, a single notch behind Stan
ford. As a result, Stanford
earned its first trip to the
crowned jewel of collegiate
sailing, the Dinghy National
Championships, for the first
time since hosting them in
1988. They will be held June 2-
4, also in New London.
After several years of near
misses at the Dinghy PCCs,
including losing a tie-breaker in
1991, Sellers said he was
relieved to finally win a close
one. "It's a really good feeling,
especially for us seniors," said
Sellers, the team captain.
For Stanford, Sellers and
crew Patel and Johnson began
as Stanford's A Division squad.

After placing an uncharacteris
tic sixth, sixth, fifth and seventh
in the first four races, Meade
and Yang filled in the rest of the
way. They earned two firsts, two
seconds, two thirds and a fourth
and had the best score of any
school in the last seven races.
Overall, in the A Division, the
Cardinal placed third.
Sellers showed no bitterness
about being replaced.
"This really shows the
strength of our team, for
Charles to come off the bench
and take us to nationals," he
said.
In the B Division, Mclntyre
and Chennavasin also held a
close third, giving Stanford an
overall second place by the nar
rowest of margins.
Both Middleton and Sellers
have high goals for nationals.
Middleton said Stanford would
be favored to place in the top
five in each national.
"Our goal is to be in the top
five in all three," said Sellers.

ford. As a result, Stanford
earned its first trip to the
crowned jewel of collegiate
sailing, the Dinghy National
Championships, for the first
time since hosting them in
1988. They will be held June 2-
4, also in New London.
After several years of near
misses at the Dinghy PCCs,
including losing a tie-breaker in
1991, Sellers said he was
relieved to finally win a close
one. "It's a really good feeling,
especially for us seniors," said
Sellers, the team captain.
For Stanford, Sellers and
crew Patel and Johnson began
as Stanford's A Division squad.

After placing an uncharacteris
tic sixth, sixth, fifth and seventh
in the first four races, Meade
and Yang filled in the rest of the
way. They earned two firsts, two
seconds, two thirds and a fourth
and had the best score of any
school in the last seven races.
Overall, in the A Division, the
Cardinal placed third.
Sellers showed no bitterness
about being replaced.
"This really shows the
strength of our team, for
Charles to come off the bench
and take us to nationals," he
said.
In the B Division, Mclntyre
and Chennavasin also held a
close third, giving Stanford an
overall second place by the nar
rowest of margins.
Both Middleton and Sellers
have high goals for nationals.
Middleton said Stanford would
be favored to place in the top
five in each national.
"Our goal is to be in the top
five in all three," said Sellers.

After top finishes this weekend, the Stanford sailing team has now qualified in all three divisions for the
national championships. Pictured above, left to right, are seniors Scott Sellers, Britt Johnson, Jeremy
Mclntyre, freshman Don Chennavasin, junior Charles Meade and freshman Letitia Yang.
Stanford completed a sailing
trifecta this weekend when it
qualified for the Team Race and
Co-ed Dinghy National Champi
onships. After securing a berth
in the Women's Nationals last
weekend, the Cardinal will now
participate in all three sailing
national championships for the
first time in more than a decade.
The easier regatta was the
Pacific Coast Team Race Cham
pionship, held in Redwood City
last Friday. As the host school
and fifth-ranked team in the
nation, Stanford came in as "the
obvious favorite," according to

director of sailing Blake Middle
ton. However, the Cardinal had
to defeat five of the top 16 teams
in the country to win the PCCs
for the second year in a row.
After a preliminary round
robin among all seven teams,
the three squads with the poor
est scores were eliminated. No.
11 Long Beach State, No. 16
USC and unranked Cal Poly-
SLO watched as the other four
schools engaged in a double
round-robin for the title.
Stanford was at 5-1 after a
loss to No. 9 UC-Irvine in the
preliminaries. The Anteaters
were also 5-1 after a loss to No.
15 Hawaii and looked to be
Stanford's only major threat in

the finals.
But the Cardinal took both
races from Irvine and ended up
5-1 in the double round-robin,
losing only once to Hawaii after
two of the three Cardinal boats
started prematurely. The 10-2
overall record gave Stanford the
regatta by one race over 9-3
Irvine. No. 12 California placed
third with a 6-6 mark, and
Hawaii ended up fourth at 5-7.
"We lost a real tight race and
a mental error race [the loss
caused by premature startsl,
but basically still were the clear
class of the regatta, no question
about it," said Middleton.
Stanford's top team was led,
as usual, by senior skipper Scott

Sellers, with seniors Britt John
son and Sujata Patel serving as
his crew. Stanford's second
team was junior skipper Charles
Meade, who was coming off a
stellar performance the week
before in the Thompson Trophy
Intersectional, and his crew,
freshman Letitia Yang. Senior
Jeremy Mclntyre skippered
with freshman crew Don Chen
navasin and Alice Manard for
the Cardinal's final team.
By placing in the top two,
both UC-Irvine and Stanford
will represent the Pacific Coast
region in the Team Race
National Championships May
30-June 1 in New London,
Conn. The Cardinal will be there
for the ninth consecutive year.
The competition was much
tighter at the Dinghy PCCs in
Alameda Saturday and Sunday.
The outcome of the regatta,
unfortunately, was not decided
on the water. Rather, a protest
committee held the fates of 11
schools in its hands.
After the actual sailing had
taken place, UC-Irvine led the
regatta with Stanford and Cal
tied for the all-important second
and final qualifying spot. Long
Beach State also had an outside
chance to move into the top two.
However, the protest commit
tee shook up the standings when
it disqualified UC-Irvine from
one race and awarded California
points for one race because of
broken equipment (the average

score, rather than the last-place
total, was awarded to Cal for
that race).
After this, the host Golden
Bears were declared the win
ners with 71 points. The Cardi
nal was a mere three points in
back with 74, and UC-Irvine
was out of the running with
75, a single notch behind Stan
ford. As a result, Stanford
earned its first trip to the
crowned jewel of collegiate
sailing, the Dinghy National
Championships, for the first
time since hosting them in
1988. They will be held June 2-
4, also in New London.
