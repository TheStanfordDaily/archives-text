# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
Out with the old, in with the new.
Although this weekend marked the end of
a great Cardinal athletic career, another
bright star has just begun to shine. While
senior Canyon Ceman saw his collegiate
volleyball years come to a close a week
early, women's golfer Mhairi McKay has
made waves in her first year on the Farm.

For these two Cardinal's efforts at con
ference tournaments — the Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation tournament for
volleyball, and Pacific 10 Conference
Championships for golf — they have
earned the honor of Athlete of the Week.
Ceman, last year's National Player of
the Year, unfortunately ended his Cardi
nal career on a sour note, as Stanford was
denied the final at-large bid to the Final
Four. However, Ceman's brilliant career
will hold its place in Stanford record
books for years to come.
As the "quarterback" of the volleyball
team, the setter is responsible for running
the offense. And Ceman has done that bet
ter than anyone in school history. His
5,908 career assists ranks him first over
all, and his 1,917 assists this year is also
tops in the record books for a single sea
son.
At the MPSF tournament, Ceman
recorded 245 assists in guiding the Cardi
nal to victory, including 100 in the finals
against Brigham Young. For his efforts
this season, he was named to the All-
MPSF second team.

The youngster McKay paced the Cardi
nal women's golf team to a fourth place
finish last week at the Pac-10 Champi
onships with a strong first day round of
74. After the three-day tournament,

McKay's total was only three shots off the
leader for fifth place overall.
A native of Glasgow, Scotland, McKay
was accustomed to the windy conditions of
the tournament which plagued the field of
golfers. McKay was also just named to the
All-Pac-10 second team, the top honor of
any Stanford golfer.
