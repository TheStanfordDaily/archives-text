# An inside job?
## Volleyball selection serves up raw deal 
### 
It just doesn't make sense. The
decision by a three-person
selection committee to include
Indiana Fort Wayne-Purdue in the
men's volleyball Final Four this
weekend is senseless and, in a
word, pathetic.

OK, so I'm a little biased. But
let's try to look at this logically. On
Sunday this trio chose an at-large
team to fill the fourth spot in the
men's volleyball Final Four, which
begins this Friday. To join UCIiA,
Penn State and Ball State (the win
ners of the three automatic bids),
Larry, Moe and Curly tapped the
IPFW Mastodons on their collec
tive shoulders instead of the Cardi
nal, thereby ending Stanford's sea
son. According to the Stanford
Athletic Department, these stooges
used four criteria to arrive at this
silly decision — head-to-head, com
mon opponents, strength of sched
ule and overall record.
Let's pretend that we are this
three-person selection committee.
One of us is from the West, one
from the Mid-east and one from
the East. Let's compare the two
teams and come up with our own
fourth member of the Final Four.
• Head-to-Head: This category
is fairly straightforward. The Car
dinal met the Mastodons once in
the regular season, at IPFW,
where the home team pulled out a
four game victory. Here is a clear
cut check in the Mastodons' favor.
Advantage IPFW.
Yet let's understand something.
Men's volleyball is not football.
The teams play a 25 game sched
ule. Twenty-five games! This is a
men's basketball number. How
much weight can a middle-of-the
season, relatively meaningless
game carry? Can you imagine if the

Stanford baseball team missed the
College World Series because of
last weekend's loss to Sacramento
State?
• Common opponents: Again, no
real deception here. Common
opponents of the two teams include
UCLA, Penn State and Ball State.
Stanford goes 10-4 against these
teams; IPFW goes 7-6. Advantage
Stanford.
• Strength of schedule: The Car
dinal plays in the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation, easily the
strongest conference in the country.
Of the top 13 teams in the country,
ranked by Volleyball Monthly, 10
compete in the MPSF. Moreover, in
the 24-year history of NCAA men's
volleyball, the national champion
has always come from the MPSF or
its predecessors.
IPFW competes in the Midwest
ern Intercollegiate Volleyball Asso
ciation, against such powerhouses
as Quincy, Lewis and Wisconsin -
Milwaukee. This is not Manhattan
Beach. Only two teams from this
conference are ranked, IPFW and
Ball State, and this is Ball Suite's
first ranking of the year, if not in
the history of the school. Advan
tage Stanford.
• Overall record: Here's the
sticking point. Stanford ended the
season 20-9; IPFW was 20-7. Win
ning percentage points IPFW's
way. But slow down and look at the
Mastodons schedule. One of their
wins came over Tri-State Universi
ty. You've never heard of the
Thunder? Well, located in that vol
leyball Mecca of Angola, Ind., Tri
State hiis an enrollment of about
1,000 students and is an NAIA
team. And, hey, this member of the
Wolverine-Hoosier conference put
up a good fight against the
Mastodons, winning the first game
before rolling over and playinn
dead 15-0, 15-9, 15-6.
Another blemish on the IPFW
blotter is Quincy College. The
Hawks are a conference opponent,
but forfeited their second match of
the season to the Mastodons after
losing the first meeting 15-2, 15-6,
15-4.

So, a forfeit and an NAIA
school make up two of IPFW's
20 wins. And that doesn't take
into account the fact that the
Mastodons other conference
opponents include Wisconsin-
Milwaukee, Rutgers-Newark
and Lewis College. In fact all
three of these ever-so
formidable squads faced IPFW
twice. Twice. And Stanford fans
think Pacific is a gimme win.
Although all indicators seem
to point to the Cardinal, to be
non-biased let's do what the trio

of stooges did and give this cri
teria to the bad guys as well.
Advantage IPFW.
So now we stand were the
selection committee did: tied at
two all. It would seem logical to
look at other possible criteria.
Like the fact that Stanford is
ranked second in the country;
IPFW is 11th. The Cardinal has
beaten every team in the top
ten except No. 1 UCLA and
IPFW; the Mastodons have only
even faced half these top
squads.
Stanford began the season
rated sixth and has labored on
up to second; IPFW held down
the fifth spot in pre-season
rankings and actually fell out of

the top 10 after early losses to
UCLA, Penn State and Ball
State.
Now of course the selection
committee won't admit to hav
ing looked at any other criteria
besides the ones stated in the
beginning. But their decision
speaks differently — it seems
that they did check one other
criteria. That would be the dol
lar sign.
The Final Four is being held
in Fort Wayne. That fact
explains everything.
And that's pathetic.

Rob can't jump himself, so he's a
little bitter that he can't go to
Indiana to watch people who can.

the history of the school. Advan
tage Stanford.
• Overall record: Here's the
sticking point. Stanford ended the
season 20-9; IPFW was 20-7. Win
ning percentage points IPFW's
way. But slow down and look at the
Mastodons schedule. One of their
wins came over Tri-State Universi
ty. You've never heard of the
Thunder? Well, located in that vol
leyball Mecca of Angola, Ind., Tri
State hiis an enrollment of about
1,000 students and is an NAIA
team. And, hey, this member of the
Wolverine-Hoosier conference put
up a good fight against the
Mastodons, winning the first game
before rolling over and playinn
dead 15-0, 15-9, 15-6.
Another blemish on the IPFW
blotter is Quincy College. The
Hawks are a conference opponent,
but forfeited their second match of
the season to the Mastodons after
losing the first meeting 15-2, 15-6,
15-4.

So, a forfeit and an NAIA
school make up two of IPFW's
20 wins. And that doesn't take
into account the fact that the
Mastodons other conference
opponents include Wisconsin-
Milwaukee, Rutgers-Newark
and Lewis College. In fact all
three of these ever-so
formidable squads faced IPFW
twice. Twice. And Stanford fans
think Pacific is a gimme win.
Although all indicators seem
to point to the Cardinal, to be
non-biased let's do what the trio

of stooges did and give this cri
teria to the bad guys as well.
Advantage IPFW.
So now we stand were the
selection committee did: tied at
two all. It would seem logical to
look at other possible criteria.
Like the fact that Stanford is
ranked second in the country;
IPFW is 11th. The Cardinal has
beaten every team in the top
ten except No. 1 UCLA and
IPFW; the Mastodons have only
even faced half these top
squads.
Stanford began the season
rated sixth and has labored on
up to second; IPFW held down
the fifth spot in pre-season
rankings and actually fell out of

the top 10 after early losses to
UCLA, Penn State and Ball
State.
Now of course the selection
committee won't admit to hav
ing looked at any other criteria
besides the ones stated in the
beginning. But their decision
speaks differently — it seems
that they did check one other
criteria. That would be the dol
lar sign.
The Final Four is being held
in Fort Wayne. That fact
explains everything.
And that's pathetic.

Rob can't jump himself, so he's a
little bitter that he can't go to
Indiana to watch people who can.
It just doesn't make sense. The
decision by a three-person
selection committee to include
Indiana Fort Wayne-Purdue in the
men's volleyball Final Four this
weekend is senseless and, in a
word, pathetic.

OK, so I'm a little biased. But
let's try to look at this logically. On
Sunday this trio chose an at-large
team to fill the fourth spot in the
men's volleyball Final Four, which
begins this Friday. To join UCIiA,
Penn State and Ball State (the win
ners of the three automatic bids),
Larry, Moe and Curly tapped the
IPFW Mastodons on their collec
tive shoulders instead of the Cardi
nal, thereby ending Stanford's sea
son. According to the Stanford
Athletic Department, these stooges
used four criteria to arrive at this
silly decision — head-to-head, com
mon opponents, strength of sched
ule and overall record.
Let's pretend that we are this
three-person selection committee.
One of us is from the West, one
from the Mid-east and one from
the East. Let's compare the two
teams and come up with our own
fourth member of the Final Four.
• Head-to-Head: This category
is fairly straightforward. The Car
dinal met the Mastodons once in
the regular season, at IPFW,
where the home team pulled out a
four game victory. Here is a clear
cut check in the Mastodons' favor.
Advantage IPFW.
Yet let's understand something.
Men's volleyball is not football.
The teams play a 25 game sched
ule. Twenty-five games! This is a
men's basketball number. How
much weight can a middle-of-the
season, relatively meaningless
game carry? Can you imagine if the

Stanford baseball team missed the
College World Series because of
last weekend's loss to Sacramento
State?
• Common opponents: Again, no
real deception here. Common
opponents of the two teams include
UCLA, Penn State and Ball State.
Stanford goes 10-4 against these
teams; IPFW goes 7-6. Advantage
Stanford.
• Strength of schedule: The Car
dinal plays in the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation, easily the
strongest conference in the country.
Of the top 13 teams in the country,
ranked by Volleyball Monthly, 10
compete in the MPSF. Moreover, in
the 24-year history of NCAA men's
volleyball, the national champion
has always come from the MPSF or
its predecessors.
IPFW competes in the Midwest
ern Intercollegiate Volleyball Asso
ciation, against such powerhouses
as Quincy, Lewis and Wisconsin -
Milwaukee. This is not Manhattan
Beach. Only two teams from this
conference are ranked, IPFW and
Ball State, and this is Ball Suite's
first ranking of the year, if not in
the history of the school. Advan
tage Stanford.
• Overall record: Here's the
sticking point. Stanford ended the
season 20-9; IPFW was 20-7. Win
ning percentage points IPFW's
way. But slow down and look at the
Mastodons schedule. One of their
