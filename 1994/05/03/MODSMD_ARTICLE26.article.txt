# Gaidar explains Russian economic peril
## 
### Burt Herman Editorial staff 
After joking about the recent
success of the San Jose Sharks
and his fellow countrymen's role
in the victory, the former prime
minister of Russia gave a speech
on the current state of the Rus
sian economy in Palo Alto last
night.
Yegor T. Gaidar addressed a
crowd of about 400 people in a
program underwritten by the
Hoover Institution and Sun
Microsystems.
Currently the leader of the
Russia's Choice party in the Rus
sian parliament, Gaidar has
served as prime minister of Rus
sia and is considered a radical eco
nomic reformer.
His speech focused on the eco
nomic turmoil currently afflicting
the former communist state as it
makes the transition to both
democracy and capitalism.
The West is not getting the
complete picture of the situation
in Russia due to a biased press,
Gaidar said. "For the press, the
good news is not news," he said.
There have been many changes
which have made life easier in
Russia, according to Gaidar. But
the road to a market economy has
been hindered by the many rem
nants of the prior regime.
"It's terribly difficult to go

away from socialism," Gaidar
said, adding that the transition
requires radical changes and the
formation of new institutions.
And there might be a few eggs
broken in the process. "There is
no economically perfect way of
privatization — I am sure of this,"
Gaidar said.
One of the most formidable
stumbling blocks in the way of
capitalism is the huge military
industrial complex that existed
under the Soviet Union, he said.
The former superpower pro
duced more conventional weapons
than all of the other countries of
the world put together, according
to Gaidar. The military was also
the source of all technological
innovation in the Soviet Union,
he said.
There is also vast social differ
entiation between income groups,
Gaidar said Under communism,
the mass corruption enabled any
one who had proper connections
to get what they wanted, but now
people must rely on money to pur
chase goods.
"To not be able to buy some
thing because of money — it's
insulting," Gaidar said.
Gaidar said he believes that the
West can offer some help to the
Russian economy, "but victory of
this battle will be decided in Rus
_• yy
sia.
The West must not give the

people in the new developing
countries false hopes about its
intentions, however. "The worst
thing that the West has done
was create hope that it could
provide financial assistance that
would really matter," Gaidar
said.
Many of Gaidar's constituents
ask him about the economic aid
promised by President Bush in
1992. "The sense that we were
deceived does exist," he said.
Comparing life just after the
splintering of the Soviet Union to
the current economic situation in
Russia, Gaidar pointed out many
positive economic indications of
an expanding economy.
For example, he said the aver
age monthly Russian wage has
gone up from $7 a month just
after the collapse of the Soviet
Union to $100 a month.
Hard currency reserves have
also increased modestly, he said.
"The market is not developed
from the United States' stand
point, but the shelves are full,"
Gaidar said.
Gaidar spent the earlier part of
his day meeting with scholars at
Hoover and the Center for Inter
national Security and Arms Con
trol at Stanford.
Upon completion of his speech,
Gaidar was presented with a San
Jose Sharks t-shirt by the chair
man of Sun Microsystems.
