## Study shows Polly Klaas media coverage may have affected children watching on television 
### Vivien Wang Staff writer 
A study being conducted by re
searchers at the School of Medicine
shows that media coverage of the kid
napping of 12-year-old Polly Klaas had
a traumatic effect on children as far as
500 miles away.
Sarah Stein, a doctor at the Psycho-
Social Treatment Laboratory at the
Medical School, stressed that the find
ings of the study were very preliminary
and that less than half of the study has
been considered and analyzed.

Nevertheless, she added that the
analysis gives clear evidence that girls
display more trauma symptoms than
hoys; in addition, out-of-state girls
were more affected than in-state boys
by coverage of the kidnapping. Younger
children were also more symptomatic
than older children.
Symptoms were determined by a
scale measuring impact of events and
an open-ended question asking chil
dren to write what they knew of the
kidnapping. The latter method was
used to determine how many emotion
al words the children would use.

Stein said the idea for the study
arose when she "saw and heard about a
number of children of all different ages
who were very traumatized by seeing
the Polly Klaas coverage on television."
Stein spoke of a teenage girl who had
to be brought to the emergency room to
see a psychiatrist because "she had
spent the last two to three months
scanning male faces on the street, look
ing for (perpetrator) Richard Allen
Davis, actively trying to find him."
Other cases include a 4-year-old
"who would not sleep in her room, but
would only sleep in her parents' bod be

tween her parents, and never on the
edge of the bed by the window. This had
been going on for a while," Stein said.
The symptoms were not limited to
girls. Stein spoke of "an 11-year old boy
who was very hyper-vigilant of men in
cars in parking lots and on the streets."
The boy would run home if he was
scared while walking on the sidewalk,
she said.
"Every time something new hap
pened [in the Klaas investigation],
these children would have reported
symptoms; now that the trial is
coming up, I would expect the
symptoms to be reactivated,"
Stein added.
The children's responses to the
traumatic events included
emotional discomfort, distur
bance and loss of ability to con
centrate.
"What was surprising was the
level of emotional reaction was
quite strong," said Psychiatry
Prof. David Spiegel, who advised
Stein and funded the study.
"Those affected took it very per
sonally, identified with Polly and
felt a personal sense of threat."
From this observation, Stein
formulated her hypothesis that
the trauma symptoms in children
arose "not from knowing the
effects of the crime, but from
repeated representation of the
crime on radio or television. You
could know the exact crime and
not be particularly symptomatic,"
Stein said.
The study also sought to show
how trauma symptoms changed
as distance from the site of the
crime increased — and hence

media coverage decreased — in
five to six states across the coun
try.
"Clearly, children don't have a
sense of distance. It doesn't mean
anything to them that it's in
Petaluma, over 100 miles away;
it's on TV," Stein said.
Spiegel added that "proximity
to the event might be conveyed
electronically rather effectively."
Because of this, children as far as
500 miles away were also affected
by the media coverage.
The study involved sending
questionnaires to schoolchildren
in California, Oregon and Utah.
"We only called the good neigh
borhoods — low-crime, suburban
areas," Stein said.
However, the three other
states originally included in the
study dropped out after recent
violent incidents in their own dis
tricts raised concern that children
might have focused on these,
rather than on the Klaas kidnap
ping, while answering the ques
tionnaire.
"The interesting thing about
this," said Stein, "is that as far as
I know, and I'm waiting to be cor
rected, this has never been done
before . . . this kind of assessment
of the impact of television news
exposure on children."
