## Stresses need for structured multiculturalism

Woon came to Stanford almost a year ago,
but he's still dealing with the ghost of his
highly visible predecessor, Greg Ricks.
"I'm not Greg Ricks and I'm not going to
try to be Greg Ricks," said Woon, who is the
first to admit he's a "behind-the-scenes"
kind of guy. "I've been relatively low profile
this year."
Woon's low-profile role is in some sense

Reflective, but not unproductive
Although Woon's role this year hits been
"reflective," it has not been unproductive.
In the past year, he has coordinated more
than 40 dorm programs, including the pop
