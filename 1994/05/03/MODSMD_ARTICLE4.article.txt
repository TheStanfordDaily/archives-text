# Woon puts diversity first
## Stresses need for structured multiculturalism 
### Beth Berselli Staff writer 
Multicultural Educator Tommy Lee
Woon came to Stanford almost a year ago,
but he's still dealing with the ghost of his
highly visible predecessor, Greg Ricks.
"I'm not Greg Ricks and I'm not going to
try to be Greg Ricks," said Woon, who is the
first to admit he's a "behind-the-scenes"
kind of guy. "I've been relatively low profile
this year."
Woon's low-profile role is in some sense
a reflection of his personality. But it is also
the residt of his observation that the cam
pus is "somewhat fatigued" by multicultur
alism.
"When Ricks came in (in 1990) there was
excitement that there would be an opportu
nity to develop multicultural education,"
said Woon. "I think we've had a backlash
and we're in a period this year of evalua
tion."
Woon said he "stepped back this year in
order to try to understand what transpired
at Stanford before me" and therefore for
mulate an effective response. "I don't know
if I stepped back so much as I came in to

study the environment before I began to
propose any actions," he said.
"It's been a year of exploration and as
sessing what transpired before me," said
Woon, who was previously an associate
dean at Brown University. "It's been a year
of conceptualizing and testing ideas, as well
as sustaining and strengthening what al
ready existed.
"It hasn't been a year of too much exper
imentation," he added.
"The kind of behind-the-scenes and de
velopmental opportunities I've been work
ing on don't attract a whole lot of attention
or controversy."
Reflective, but not unproductive
Although Woon's role this year hits been
"reflective," it has not been unproductive.
In the past year, he has coordinated more
than 40 dorm programs, including the pop
ular "Crossing the Line" and a program ti
tled, "The Other 50 percent" in Ujamaa last
quarter.
"It's a program that examines what it's
like living in Ujamaa for the other 50 per-

cent of students who are not
African-American," Woon said.
Ujamaa residents were divided
up into two groups — African-
Americans and non-African-
Americans — and given state
ments such as, "Ujamaa exists
primarily to build African-Ameri
can identity." Facing toward the
wall, students moved to specific
areas of the room, depending on
their level of agreement or dis
agreement.
"Then they turned around and
saw if there were racial differences
involved," Woon said. "I think
what people learned is that they
couldn't predict where different
races would stand on an issue."
Working with residence staff to
develop programming has been a
top priority, Woon said. "I've tried
to create a framework that enables
resident assistants to evaluate the

level of awareness in their houses
so they can develop programs that
fit their needs," he said.
Thomas Arnold, a theme associ
ate at Ujamaa, said Woon has
"made a concerted effort to reach
out to the residence staff."
In addition to programming,
Woon has worked with two groups
this year. He organized METrO, a
multicultural education training
organization which is a group of
staff members who have volun
teered to work on diversity pro
grams.
Woon also has worked with Stu
dents Speaking About Race and
Culture (SSpARC). The group put
on a program titled "When Can I
Laugh?" last quarter, which exam
ined the cultural bases of humor
and how it can have both positive
and negative effects.
'Everyone' an educator
Woon said he is trying to estab
lish a clear framework for multi
cultural education. "I want a more
accessible, intellectual under

standing about the project and a
more inclusive process," he said.
"When I came in I wanted to
develop a program for multicultur
al education, rather than a pro
gram that's based on one person's
activities," Woon said, referring to
Ricks' approach. "I'm trying to
build a system that enables every
one to see themselves as multicul
tural educators."
He has also focused on "estab
lishing relationships" in order to
develop a community base, Woon
said.
That has been difficult at times
this year, as Woon has been forced
to adjust to a new setting in the
midst of sometimes hostile rela
tions between students and the
administration over the effects of
budget cuts on multicultural activ
ity and representation.
"I don't think the communities
knew what the administration's
intentions were towards their activ
ities. I think the recent flurry of
activities emerged to fmd out what
their intentions were," he said.

Woon admitted that the budget
cuts have affected his work by
making it "more difficult to work
proactively to promote cross-cul
tural relationships.... I didn't feel
I could ask the deans and directors
to create new programs when
they're so preoccupied developing
the strategic plans."
A different style
Students and staff agree that
Woon has a different style than
Ricks, a man of commanding phys
ical presence and often outspoken
opinions, who left Stanford last
year to accept a position in Presi
dent Clinton's national service
program. "Greg talked more and
was more of an energizing speaker.
I think that Tommy wants the
energizing speech to come from
the students," said Arnold.
"Tommy thinks a lot about the
issues," said Jim Chu, an RA at
Okada. "He's low profile in that
he's not loud and he doesn't force
his opinions on others. He's always
thinking about what ain be done

on campus."
Despite these differences, most
agree that Woon is doing a "good
job" in his role as multicultural
educator.
"Tommy has brought in a valu
able perspective and has provoked
a lot of thoughtful discussion
among people," said Chris
Gonzalez Clarke, assistant direc
tor at El Centro Chicano. "He has
encouraged us all to recommit our
selves to multiculturalism."
Woon's "soft-spoken" style may
especially appeal to "people in the
mainstream," said Denni Wood
ward, assistant director of the
American Indian Program.
"His subtle approach is a good
one," Woodward said. "Tommy
has made a good effort to reach out
to lots of different groups of peo
ple."
While Woon said some people
might view his "relative invisibili
ty" as a sign that the University is
retreating from its commitment to
multicultural education, he dis
agrees.

As for future programming,
Woon said he's considering a
"coming-out program" next year.
The purpose is not to make peo
ple objects, Woon said, but to have
people "make their commitment
public so that they can impact the
environment."
For example, a man could come
out in support of women's rights.
"It's not for the members of the
target group, it's more the people
outside the group," he said.
"I think there needs to be a
whole support program to encour
age people to be public allies. ... If
you announce your support, then
you're helping create a more
affirming environment."
In addition, Woon is trying to
create an award program for stu
dents who have made valuable
contributions to cross-cultural
relations.
In terms of his profile on aim
pus, Woon said, "I expect to take a
more visible role next year. I'll be
ready with my own program
ming," Woon said.

Woon's low-profile role is in some sense
a reflection of his personality. But it is also
the residt of his observation that the cam
pus is "somewhat fatigued" by multicultur
alism.
"When Ricks came in (in 1990) there was
excitement that there would be an opportu
nity to develop multicultural education,"
said Woon. "I think we've had a backlash
and we're in a period this year of evalua
tion."
Woon said he "stepped back this year in
order to try to understand what transpired
at Stanford before me" and therefore for
mulate an effective response. "I don't know
if I stepped back so much as I came in to

study the environment before I began to
propose any actions," he said.
"It's been a year of exploration and as
sessing what transpired before me," said
Woon, who was previously an associate
dean at Brown University. "It's been a year
of conceptualizing and testing ideas, as well
as sustaining and strengthening what al
ready existed.
"It hasn't been a year of too much exper
imentation," he added.
"The kind of behind-the-scenes and de
velopmental opportunities I've been work
ing on don't attract a whole lot of attention
or controversy."
Reflective, but not unproductive
Although Woon's role this year hits been
"reflective," it has not been unproductive.
In the past year, he has coordinated more
than 40 dorm programs, including the pop
ular "Crossing the Line" and a program ti
tled, "The Other 50 percent" in Ujamaa last
quarter.
"It's a program that examines what it's
like living in Ujamaa for the other 50 per-

cent of students who are not
African-American," Woon said.
Ujamaa residents were divided
up into two groups — African-
Americans and non-African-
Americans — and given state
ments such as, "Ujamaa exists
primarily to build African-Ameri
can identity." Facing toward the
wall, students moved to specific
areas of the room, depending on
their level of agreement or dis
agreement.
"Then they turned around and
saw if there were racial differences
involved," Woon said. "I think
what people learned is that they
couldn't predict where different
races would stand on an issue."
Working with residence staff to
develop programming has been a
top priority, Woon said. "I've tried
to create a framework that enables
resident assistants to evaluate the

level of awareness in their houses
so they can develop programs that
fit their needs," he said.
Thomas Arnold, a theme associ
ate at Ujamaa, said Woon has
"made a concerted effort to reach
out to the residence staff."
In addition to programming,
Woon has worked with two groups
this year. He organized METrO, a
multicultural education training
organization which is a group of
staff members who have volun
teered to work on diversity pro
grams.
Woon also has worked with Stu
dents Speaking About Race and
Culture (SSpARC). The group put
on a program titled "When Can I
Laugh?" last quarter, which exam
ined the cultural bases of humor
and how it can have both positive
and negative effects.
'Everyone' an educator
Woon said he is trying to estab
lish a clear framework for multi
cultural education. "I want a more
accessible, intellectual under

standing about the project and a
more inclusive process," he said.
"When I came in I wanted to
develop a program for multicultur
al education, rather than a pro
gram that's based on one person's
activities," Woon said, referring to
Ricks' approach. "I'm trying to
build a system that enables every
one to see themselves as multicul
tural educators."
He has also focused on "estab
lishing relationships" in order to
develop a community base, Woon
said.
That has been difficult at times
this year, as Woon has been forced
to adjust to a new setting in the
midst of sometimes hostile rela
tions between students and the
administration over the effects of
budget cuts on multicultural activ
ity and representation.
"I don't think the communities
knew what the administration's
intentions were towards their activ
ities. I think the recent flurry of
activities emerged to fmd out what
their intentions were," he said.

Woon admitted that the budget
cuts have affected his work by
making it "more difficult to work
proactively to promote cross-cul
tural relationships.... I didn't feel
I could ask the deans and directors
to create new programs when
they're so preoccupied developing
the strategic plans."
A different style
Students and staff agree that
Woon has a different style than
Ricks, a man of commanding phys
ical presence and often outspoken
opinions, who left Stanford last
year to accept a position in Presi
dent Clinton's national service
program. "Greg talked more and
was more of an energizing speaker.
I think that Tommy wants the
energizing speech to come from
the students," said Arnold.
"Tommy thinks a lot about the
issues," said Jim Chu, an RA at
Okada. "He's low profile in that
he's not loud and he doesn't force
his opinions on others. He's always
thinking about what ain be done

on campus."
Despite these differences, most
agree that Woon is doing a "good
job" in his role as multicultural
educator.
"Tommy has brought in a valu
able perspective and has provoked
a lot of thoughtful discussion
among people," said Chris
Gonzalez Clarke, assistant direc
tor at El Centro Chicano. "He has
encouraged us all to recommit our
selves to multiculturalism."
Woon's "soft-spoken" style may
especially appeal to "people in the
mainstream," said Denni Wood
ward, assistant director of the
American Indian Program.
"His subtle approach is a good
one," Woodward said. "Tommy
has made a good effort to reach out
to lots of different groups of peo
ple."
While Woon said some people
might view his "relative invisibili
ty" as a sign that the University is
retreating from its commitment to
multicultural education, he dis
agrees.

As for future programming,
Woon said he's considering a
"coming-out program" next year.
The purpose is not to make peo
ple objects, Woon said, but to have
people "make their commitment
public so that they can impact the
environment."
For example, a man could come
out in support of women's rights.
"It's not for the members of the
target group, it's more the people
outside the group," he said.
"I think there needs to be a
whole support program to encour
age people to be public allies. ... If
you announce your support, then
you're helping create a more
affirming environment."
In addition, Woon is trying to
create an award program for stu
dents who have made valuable
contributions to cross-cultural
relations.
In terms of his profile on aim
pus, Woon said, "I expect to take a
more visible role next year. I'll be
ready with my own program
ming," Woon said.
Multicultural Educator Tommy Lee
Woon came to Stanford almost a year ago,
but he's still dealing with the ghost of his
highly visible predecessor, Greg Ricks.
"I'm not Greg Ricks and I'm not going to
try to be Greg Ricks," said Woon, who is the
first to admit he's a "behind-the-scenes"
kind of guy. "I've been relatively low profile
this year."
