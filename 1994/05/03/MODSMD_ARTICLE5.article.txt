# Students file suit over speech code
## University must respond in 30 days 
### Scott Van Winkle Staff writer 
Initiating a constitutional and
legal challenge against a four
year-old regulation of student ex
pression on campus, nine Stanford
students filed suit against the Uni
versity yesterday, demanding the
repeal of its speech code.
The complaint, filed in the
Santa Clara County Superior
Court, claims that the Grey Inter
pretation of the Fundamental
Standard — which prohibits stu
dents from making inflammatory
statements based on race, sex,
handicap, religion or sexual orien
tation — violates both the U.S.
Constitution and California law.
The University has 30 days to

respond to the suit, either by set
tling with the plaintiffs out of
court or contesting their claim be
fore a state judge. The suit names
the University, Board of Trustees
president John Freidenrich, Uni
versity President Gerhard Casper
and Judicial Affairs Officer Sally
Cole as defendants.
Third-year law student Robert
Corry, who will serve as
spokesperson for the plaintiffs,
said he would be "open to any of
fers" from the University. Howev
er, he added that the immediate
goal of the suit is the repeal of the
Grey Interpretation.
Assoc. University Counsel Iris
Brest had no comment on the case
last night, stating that she had
received the complaint but had
not yet read it.
The speech code, authored by
Law Prof. Thomas Grey and
passed in 1990 after 18 months of
debate, has never been enforced
against any violation.
A temporary restraining order
preventing the University from
enforcing the speech code could
be issued within two weeks, Corry
said, depending on how the Uni
versity responds.
The suit is based on a California
law, known as the Leonard Law,
which extends free speech protec
tion to students at private univer
sities. The First Amendment pro
hibits only government restric
tions on free speech, and does not
generally apply to regulations
made by private universities.
The Leonard Law, adopted as
part of the California Education
Code in 1992, has never been test
ed in court, Corry said.
The law states, "Private post
secondary educational institutions
shall not make or enforce any rule
subjecting any student to disci
plinary sanctions solely on the
basis of conduct that is speech or
other communication that, when
engaged in outside the campus or
facility of a private [university], is
protected from governmental

restriction by the First Amend
ment ... or Section 2 or Article 1
of the California Constitution."
The complaint also claims that
the speech code violates the 14th
Amendment to the U.S. Constitu
tion, which guarantees equal pro
tection under the law. The com
plaint alleges that "the adminis
tration has expressed in the past
that the speech code only protects
students of certain minority
groups against insults."
"While on campus, I have been
called a 'Nazi,' a 'Fascist,' an
'Aryan Youth,' and "White
Trash" on certain occasions, but
have enjoyed no protection from
the speech code," Corry wrote in
the complaint.
Nevertheless, Stanford Review
columnist Aman Verjee, a junior
who is one of the plaintiffs in the
case, said he respects the Grey
Interpretation. "If I had to write a
speech code, this is the one I
would write," he said. "It's rea
sonable, narrow and not easily
abused by people in power." But
he rejects the interpretation on
"philosophical" grounds, he said.
"If I am to believe the truth,"
he wrote in the complaint, "I
must be able to refute all the com
mon objections to my posi
tion. . . . And I must hear the
arguments of [my opponents], so
that I may think about them, and
dispose of them. Anything less
than that diminishes my educa
tion; and I am so diminished."
No court date has been set yet,

Corry said, but a mandatory meet
ing between parties has been sched
uled for August 30. A trial would
not occur for several months.
Along with Corry and Veijee,
law students Cyrus Rea and Scott
Kupor and undergraduates Paul
Viriyapanthu, Michael Meyer, Sam
Ockman, Joshua Davis and Steve
Russell are plaintiffs in the case.
Corry emphasized the philo
sophical diversity of the group fil
ing suit and the widespread sup
port he has received. "Just about
everyone I've talked to — liberals,
conservatives and moderates —
they all pretty much agree with
me," he said. Corry has been
researching the legality of the
speech code since January.
A referendum in the 1992 ASSU
election found that two-thirds of
students opposed the speech code.
Corry's efforts against the
speech code have continued
throughout his time at Stanford,
he said, but previous attempts —
including an ASSU Senate resolu
tion — have failed.
"This is a really important
issue to a lot of people, and unfor
tunately it's come to a legal
issue," he said. "This is a last
resort."
Both Verjee and Corry say they
have been encouraged by repeals
of speech codes at universities
across the country, including the
University of Pennsylvania and
Michigan University.
"Political correctness is
already dead," Corry said.
