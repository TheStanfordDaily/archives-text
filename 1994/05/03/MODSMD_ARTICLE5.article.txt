# Students file suit over speech code
## University must respond in 30 days 
### Scott Van Winkle Staff writer 
Initiating a constitutional and
legal challenge against a four
year-old regulation of student ex
pression on campus, nine Stanford
students filed suit against the Uni
versity yesterday, demanding the
repeal of its speech code.
The complaint, filed in the
Santa Clara County Superior
Court, claims that the Grey Inter
pretation of the Fundamental
Standard — which prohibits stu
dents from making inflammatory
statements based on race, sex,
handicap, religion or sexual orien
tation — violates both the U.S.
Constitution and California law.
The University has 30 days to

respond to the suit, either by set
tling with the plaintiffs out of
court or contesting their claim be
fore a state judge. The suit names
the University, Board of Trustees
president John Freidenrich, Uni
versity President Gerhard Casper
and Judicial Affairs Officer Sally
Cole as defendants.
Third-year law student Robert
Corry, who will serve as
spokesperson for the plaintiffs,
said he would be "open to any of
fers" from the University. Howev
er, he added that the immediate
goal of the suit is the repeal of the
Grey Interpretation.

Brest had no comment on the case
