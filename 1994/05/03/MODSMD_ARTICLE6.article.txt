### Miranda Doyle Editorial staff 
Convinced that grade inflation
poses a serious threat, the Com
mission on Undergraduate Edu
cation yesterday called for a new
committee to study methods of
curbing the problem.
The group also decided to rec
ommend that three years of for
eign language study in high
school no longer meet the Univer
sity's language requirement, said
History Prof. James Sheehan, the
commission chair.
Although the commission
agreed that "the grading system
is in danger of collapsing" due to
grade inflation, Sheehan said
members did not believe they
should propose solutions.

The Faculty
Senate is cur
rently consider
ing a proposal to
change the grad
ing policy and
add/drop dead
lines, but Shee
han said commis
sion members do
not believe the

changes go far enough.
"The |senate committee's] rec
ommendation was really a fairly
narrow response to the problem,"
he added. While it might help end
abuses of the grading system, "we
don't feel it will do much for grade
inflation."
Sheehan said, however, that
the commission does not feel
