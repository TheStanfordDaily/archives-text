# CUE wants study of grade inflation
## 
### Miranda Doyle Editorial staff 
Convinced that grade inflation
poses a serious threat, the Com
mission on Undergraduate Edu
cation yesterday called for a new
committee to study methods of
curbing the problem.
The group also decided to rec
ommend that three years of for
eign language study in high
school no longer meet the Univer
sity's language requirement, said
History Prof. James Sheehan, the
commission chair.
Although the commission
agreed that "the grading system
is in danger of collapsing" due to
grade inflation, Sheehan said
members did not believe they
should propose solutions.

The Faculty
Senate is cur
rently consider
ing a proposal to
change the grad
ing policy and
add/drop dead
lines, but Shee
han said commis
sion members do
not believe the

changes go far enough.
"The |senate committee's] rec
ommendation was really a fairly
narrow response to the problem,"
he added. While it might help end
abuses of the grading system, "we
don't feel it will do much for grade
inflation."
Sheehan said, however, that
the commission does not feel


Sheehan
equipped to recommend specific
changes. Instead, they endorsed
the idea of a new group —
appointed by the president or
provost, with more student repre
sentation than the commission —
to investigate grade inflation next
year.
"Students with relatively good
[grade point averages] may suffer
because Stanford GPAs don't
mean that much," said Law Prof
Robert Weisberg, a commission
member, noting that one compa
ny even asks to see SAT scores
because they do not trust tran

scripts.
Of the letter grades given out
last year, 93 percent were A's or
B's — compared to 77 percent in
1968-69. C's make up only 9 per
cent of letter grades for under
graduate courses and 3 percent
for graduate courses.
Options a new committee
might consider include "imposing
some kind of distribution" of
grades on professors or "redefin
ing grades" from letters to some
other scale, Sheehan said.
"You can have curves, you can
have means, you can have
required distributions," Weisberg
said, while warning potential
committee members that the
debate over grading policies is "a
nightmare. Every proposal is

bad."
The commission also discussed
the possibility of printing the
median grade for a class next to
each student's grade, according to
junior Luz Herrera, the group's
undergraduate member.
She said she is worried that
Stanford might punish students
for grade inflation, an institu
tional problem also plaguing
other universities, when stu
dents are not the ones awarding
grades.
"I don't think students should
be penalized for something that's
the fault of the institution," Her
rera said.
The commission will also rec
ommend that grade distributions,
broken down by types of classes,

"be made public to the faculty on
a regular basis," Sheehan said.
In advocating a stricter for
eign-language requirement,
Spanish and Portuguese Prof.
Guadalupe Valdes said the com
mission "wanted to make a state
ment to students that we think
language is important."
Currently, students can meet
the requirement with three years
of a language in high school, a
three-quarter sequence at Stan
ford or an exam showing their
mastery equals a year of college
level study.
Under the proposed system,
"students would have to either
pass a proficiency exam or the
third quarter of a first-year class
at Stanford," said Sheehan.

"Really the only thing we're
eliminating is the high school
study," Valdes said. "What's real
ly changing is it's not just 'seat
time.' We want to see what you
can do with a language."
The required level of profi
ciency would vary from language
to language, Valdes said, and
each department would develop
its own exam. For example,
reaching an "intermediate level"
of proficiency might take three
quarters for Spanish and four for
Russian.
Students who could not test
out of the requirement could take
"no more than three or four quar
ters" of a language at Stanford or
choose to learn one somewhere
else, Valdes said. "They could go

to Berlitz or France or spend a
summer in Mexico."
Herrera said she was pleased
by the flexibility of the recom
mended changes, and believes
the stricter requirements are
positive because "Stanford does
claim to be an international uni
versity."
Compared to other leading uni
versities, Sheehan said, "our lan
guage requirements are at the
very bottom. We want to bring
ourselves into sync with other
schools."
At next week's meeting, Shee
han said the commission will dis
cuss the academic calendar —
including the possibility of
switching to semesters — and the
advising system.

committee members that the
debate over grading policies is "a
nightmare. Every proposal is

bad."
The commission also discussed
the possibility of printing the
median grade for a class next to
each student's grade, according to
junior Luz Herrera, the group's
undergraduate member.
She said she is worried that
Stanford might punish students
for grade inflation, an institu
tional problem also plaguing
other universities, when stu
dents are not the ones awarding
grades.
"I don't think students should
be penalized for something that's
the fault of the institution," Her
rera said.
The commission will also rec
ommend that grade distributions,
broken down by types of classes,

"be made public to the faculty on
a regular basis," Sheehan said.
In advocating a stricter for
eign-language requirement,
Spanish and Portuguese Prof.
Guadalupe Valdes said the com
mission "wanted to make a state
ment to students that we think
language is important."
Currently, students can meet
the requirement with three years
of a language in high school, a
three-quarter sequence at Stan
ford or an exam showing their
mastery equals a year of college
level study.
Under the proposed system,
"students would have to either
pass a proficiency exam or the
third quarter of a first-year class
at Stanford," said Sheehan.

"Really the only thing we're
eliminating is the high school
study," Valdes said. "What's real
ly changing is it's not just 'seat
time.' We want to see what you
can do with a language."
The required level of profi
ciency would vary from language
to language, Valdes said, and
each department would develop
its own exam. For example,
reaching an "intermediate level"
of proficiency might take three
quarters for Spanish and four for
Russian.
Students who could not test
out of the requirement could take
"no more than three or four quar
ters" of a language at Stanford or
choose to learn one somewhere
else, Valdes said. "They could go

to Berlitz or France or spend a
summer in Mexico."
Herrera said she was pleased
by the flexibility of the recom
mended changes, and believes
the stricter requirements are
positive because "Stanford does
claim to be an international uni
versity."
Compared to other leading uni
versities, Sheehan said, "our lan
guage requirements are at the
very bottom. We want to bring
ourselves into sync with other
schools."
At next week's meeting, Shee
han said the commission will dis
cuss the academic calendar —
including the possibility of
switching to semesters — and the
advising system.
