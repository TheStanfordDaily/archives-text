# Escaping 'the box'
## Spalding Gray on his life's work 
### Ed Yoon Senior staff writer 
Covering diverse topics such as the influence of
Freud, the cultural emptiness of Los Angeles and the
"deconstruction of narrative," Spalding Gray —
writer, actor and monologist — spoke to an enthusi
astic crowd at Kresge Auditorium yesterday evening
after a screening of his film, "Monster in a Box."
Speaking rapidly but never faltering, Gray —
dressed in a red Champion sweatshirt and sitting in
formally on the stage with his shoes off — frequently
fired questions back at the crowd as he discussed his
frustrations with traditional stage acting and the ori
gins of his interest in monologue.
Working with an experimental acting group in
1970, Gray said he crossed the traditional boundaries
between audience and actor by relating personal
tragedy to individuals in the audience. The sudden
death of his mother, who had
committed suicide while he was
out of the country, became the
source for numerous nights of
storytelling and launched his
future in monologue.
"Every night I would go into
the audience and choose a woman
to tell that story to," he said.
"And that was probably my first
monologue."
"Monster in a Box" featured
Gray in typical form, reaching
into personal anecdote and his
"cinemagraphic" memory for
material. In the film, Gray wor
ries about, among other things,
Hollywood agents, Nicaraguan
fact-finding missions, existen
tialism and AIDS. The film is
unified by his struggle to finish a
book of fiction, his "monster in a
box."
Known for his droll humor,
Gray, with expert inflections and
delivery that often reminds one of

standup comedy, drew numerous
laughs from the audience.
In the question and answer
session, Gray said that none of his
marathon-length monologues are
written beforehand. However, he
outlines the topics and carefully
refines the piece over time until
every laugh, line, pause and beat
is realized.
As an example of his extensive
preparation, "Gray's Anatomy,"
his monologue scheduled for this
Wednesday in Dinkelspiel Audito
rium, took about two years of
work before reaching its final
form.
Describing his performance as
"reinventing myself, recycling
myself, selling a part of myself,"
Gray said that he is unafraid to
discuss any topic publicly and
never pushes an agenda. "I'm
trying to get my story out," he
said. "The message is telling my
story."
Arguing that American culture
is puritanical and stifling, encour
aging "no loose conversation
except in a bar," Gray has, in pre
vious performances, interviewed

audience members to tell their
own stories, as if they and he had
only a few moments left to live.

'I'm trying to get my
story out. The mes
sage is telling my
story.'
— Spalding Gray

"People's stories and people's
oral history are a hundred times
more important," said Gray,
denying the significance of talk
show hosts and the like.
When questioned by a woman
feeling that her work on a disser
tation was perhaps too self-indul
gent — echoing Gray's frustra
tion with his book in "Monster in
a Box" — Gray immediately shot
back with a question of his own.
"What is self-indulgence?" he
demanded. "When did you last
have it?"

And to another questioner who
noted Gray's frequent mention of
alcohol in the film and wondered
whether Gray used it to release
his artistic inhibitions, Gray
asked, "What do you know about
alcohol's effect on repression? Do
you have an example?"
Gray was brought to campus
by a joint effort between The
Lively Arts at Stanford and the
Humanities Center. Charles
Junkerman, associate director of
the Humanities Center, said that
Gray "has kind of an essayist's
reflection on American culture, a
feel for life, someone like Mon
tesquieu or Montaigne. It's all
about his own life, but it's all our
own experience.
"He's somebody who is men
tally an explorer," continued
Junkerman. "He can talk about
himself and you can see yourself
reflected back from him. And the
last thing that is so attractive is
the oral medium, and I think
that's not accidental. It's the
voice of a human, telling a story.
There's something old about it,
but still so new."
