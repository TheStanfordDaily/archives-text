## 
### Diane Chen Staff writer 
Describing the influence of her father's views in
forming her own identity, Attallah Shabazz, daugh
ter of black activist Malcolm X, spoke last night of the
importance of knowing oneself in the context of eth
nicity and culture.
Speaking to an audience of more than 200 in An
nenberg Auditorium, Shabazz called her presenta
tion "bittersweet. . . sweet in that it gives me the op
portunity, as the generation before you, to fill in the
blanks of some of the good old days that you missed."
However, Shabazz spoke of bitterness as well. "I
stand before you because he [Malcolm XI is not here,"
she said.
Shabazz emphasized the value
of the individual throughout her
speech. "Dreams are so achievable;
it starts with a flicker. If it has a
vision, then it can happen," she
said.
She suggested to her listeners
that they start a list of adjectives to
describe themselves and share it
with no one else. She claimed that
doing this would help in "develop
ing your impression of yourself."
She added that it was important
to maintain your self-confidence no
matter what others say. "If some

one said something [negative]
about ethnicity ... let everyone
hear how ignorant they are," she
said.
As the daughter of Malcolm X,
Shabazz shared some of her
thoughts about growing up in the
house of a well-known and contro
versial black leader. "My father
said that the greatest tool of the
oppressor was the minds of the
oppressed," she said. She called her
father a "buddy friend" who was a
prankster at home.
Although "war and hell did exist
outside that house ... I was in a
house where I watched brown,
where I watched black being noble
ized," she said.
Shabazz called herself a "daugh

ter of a revolution" and added that
"revolution simply means change."
In order to emphasize change at
the individual level, she said there
are "all kinds of ways to be a revo
lutionary," including thanking par
ents or hugging a friend.
Another issue raised was that
individuals "become responsible
for reading between the lines,"
Shabazz said. She warned listeners
not to allow headlines to determine
their friends mid enemies and to
always "automatically assume
there's another side."
Shabazz also commented that
people could easily improve inter
personal relations by simply show
ing respect and common courtesy.
"Practice more often saying 'thank

you.' Say 'thank you' and say it
again," she suggested.
She hoped that people would
"reach into other cultures" at the
same time they tried to help others
understand their own.
Near the end of her presenta
tion, Shabazz asked the audience
to repeat after her, "From birth, I
am all right, just as I am." She also
welcomed comments and fielded
questions about her father and his
portrayal in the media and history
books.
The talk was part of nationwide
May Week celebrations of the Delta
Sigma Theta sorority. The May
Week theme for this year is
"Embracing our past to forge our
future."
