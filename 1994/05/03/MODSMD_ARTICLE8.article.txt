Describing the influence of her father's views in
forming her own identity, Attallah Shabazz, daugh
ter of black activist Malcolm X, spoke last night of the
importance of knowing oneself in the context of eth
nicity and culture.
Speaking to an audience of more than 200 in An
nenberg Auditorium, Shabazz called her presenta
tion "bittersweet. . . sweet in that it gives me the op
portunity, as the generation before you, to fill in the
blanks of some of the good old days that you missed."
However, Shabazz spoke of bitterness as well. "I
stand before you because he [Malcolm XI is not here,"
she said.
