# Israel, PLO ready to sign accord
## Despite last minute problems agreement for self-rule is planned 
### 
CAIRO, (AP) â€” Israel and the
PLO ran into last-minute potholes on
the road to peace yesterday, but
arrangements went ahead for them to
sign their historic accord on Palestinian
self-rule.
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of
Israel and PLO leader Yasser Arafat met
in an effort to settle final disputes before
today's scheduled signing. In a surprise
move, U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher joined the meeting.
The agreement covers the Gaza Strip
and West Bank town of Jericho and for
the first time gives Palestinians a mea
sure of control over their lives on part of
the land they claim as their own. It also
sets the stage for talks on a permanent
solution to the Palestinian-Israeli con
flict.
Yesterday, as more than six months of

negotiations drew to a close, Palestinian
delegates accused Israel of creating new
obstacles and quibbling over details.
"The Israelis are going back on what
was agreed upon," PLO delegate Jamil
Tarifi charged.
Arafat voiced similar complaints on
the chartered Norwegian jet that carried
him from Tunis, Tunisia. He said Nor
way's foreign minister, Bjorn Tore Godal,
had to persuade him to make the flight.
But Rabin spokesman Gad Ben-Ari
insisted the issues were "more than 98
percent" settled. Arafat and Rabin face
"substantial issues ... but issues that can
be resolved," he said.
Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres
said yesterday he considered last-minute
crises normal in negotiations.
"Tomorrow at 11 (a.m., 4 a.m. EDT)
we're going to sign an historic accord

between Palestinians and Israelis," Peres
said. "We're going to open a completely
new chapter in our relations and for our
future."
Speaking privately, some Palestinian
delegates said they expected the signing
to go ahead.
But Israeli delegate Jacques Neriah
indicated the talks could go down to the
wire. Asked when negotiators would fin
ish, Neriah replied: "Hopefully, we will
finish tomorrow morning."
Peres and the chief negotiators, the
PLO's Nabil Shaath and Israeli Maj. Gen.
Amnon Shahak, joined the Rabin-Arafat
talks. Egypt's president, Hosni
Mubarak, is to preside over the signing.
Christopher and Russian Foreign Minis
ter Andrei Kozyrev, whose countries
sponsor the Middle East peace talks, are
to speak.
