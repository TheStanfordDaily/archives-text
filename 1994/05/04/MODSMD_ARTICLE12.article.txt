## Editorial Fixing Flicks' fiasco 
### 
Short films should not
be forced upon students
not interested in viewing

IF THERE'S ANYTHING this
campus should have learned
during the last several years of
"multicultural backlash," it's that
moralizing to a captive audience
may just breed resentment of one's
cause — no matter how worthy.
But while University adminis
trators now take a more cautious
tack when it comes to moral edu
cation, students would do well to
examine their approach. A case in
point is the showing of "No
Grapes" at the 10 p.m. Flicks on
Sunday, before the scheduled film,
"Mrs. Doubtfire."
"No Grapes" is a 10-minute
United Farm Workers' video
about pesticides and agricultural
laborers. A group of students
asked the Flicks management to
show the film prior to the feature
movie, a request that has been
granted before to other groups
without incident.
Unfortunately, this time the
lights didn't dim until well past
10:15, and when they did, the
restless crowd was forced to sit
through "No Grapes" before the
feature film. While most stu
dents watched respectfully and
patiently, a few others made rude
remarks and laughed inappropri
been racist. At best, they were
downright immature. Whether
they yelled "Fast forward!"
because they didn't care about the
issues the film presented or
because they wanted to get home
and study, their behavior does not
encourage an environment of
acceptance.
Obviously, a documentary
which shows people being
sprayed with pesticides and chil
dren being born with birth

defects is no laughing matter.
Furthermore, laughing and jeer
ing at the film was disrespectful
to the students who worked to
bring "No Grapes" to Flicks and
the Chicano/Latino community
in general.
Nevertheless, it must be
remembered that audience mem
bers came to Flicks to see "Mrs.
Doubtfire," to take a quick study
break and watch Robin Williams
play dress-up. While most people
probably didn't mind watching
"No Grapes," they should have
been given the choice whether to
watch it or not.
Flicks should continue to be a
forum for students, by students,
and Flicks' management should
be commended for being open to
student requests to show shorts.
But in the future, any group that
wishes to show a short film on any
topic should show it in the begin
ning as people are coming in or a
few minutes after the feature pre
sentation ends.
That way, those who want to
watch the film can do so in peace,
and those who don't can leave
and not make others uncomfort
able with their rude comments.
While many people may choose
not to stay after the feature, stu
dent organizers shouldn't
despair — such people, if forced
to watch, would probably only
ruin it for those who are truly
interested.
It is laudable that students such
as those who brought "No Grapes"
to Flicks are trying to raise aware
ness about a cause that is impor
tant to them. And asking the
Flicks audience to watch a 10-
minute film is asking very little.
But therein lies the problem: audi
ence members weren't asked to
watch "No Grapes" — they were
told to.
Students must carefully walk
the fine line between informing
and lecturing. Informing willing
listeners is the way to win sup
porters; preaching to an uninter
ested crowd can only bring an
unwelcome response.
