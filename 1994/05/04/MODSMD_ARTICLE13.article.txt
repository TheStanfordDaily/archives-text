## Oxford blues hurt so good 
### 
OXFORD UNIVERSITY, England
— The weather is dreary, the food
worse and the people reserved,
seemingly cold, from the American point
of view. And for those very reasons, I love
it here.
How can I explain it? It's so counterin
tuitive, but if I had a choice of year-round
sunshine, great food and exuberantly
warm and outgoing people, I wouldn't take
it. It just wouldn't be Oxford.
There is a certain mood brought on by
the heart of the English winter — days
when the sun sets (or rather, daylight
ends, since the sun is rarely visible) at 4
p.m. and there is a constant not-quite-rain
mist in the air — that could not be experi
enced anywhere else in the world.
Winter is a quiet time in Oxford, when
the gloomy weather drives away the
tourists and the banks of the Thames are
relatively unpopulated and often flooded.
The city belongs to the students and resi
dents, who carry on with their lives and
studies, enjoying the rare changes in
weather.
Sun — a rare hour or so of sunshine
during an Oxford winter is reminiscent of
movie depictions of the clouds opening up
and a ray of heavenly light being sent
down.
And when spring comes, the weather,
along with the whole city, changes. Fair
weather distraction reigns supreme —
punting on the river often takes prece
dence over tutorial papers. Yet the experi

enced skeptic always carries an umbrella,
even on the warmest of days.
Meanwhile, the college food remains
stubbornly constant. Oxford's dining halls
bring to life all the negative stereotypes
about English food — everything really is
boiled or fried; grease, brussel sprouts and
particularly potatoes abound and flavor is
a luxury.
But there is something conciliatory and
even mildly amusing about suffering
through the Oxford dining experience in a
several-hundred-year-old, beautifully
wood-paneled dining hall. Really. The
experience, and — dare I say — the food,
grows on you.
After four months plus here, not only
has my tolerance for grease and potatoes
increased but I also faithfully have tea
(with milk and sugar) nearly every after
noon at 4 p.m.
Tea — both the break and the drink —
is a wonderful thing. Tea is something to
sit down and chat over. It begs for relax
ation, for scones or little triangular sand
wiches with watercress. It is a welcome
departure from the American equivalent to
the cup of coffee bolted down while run
ning to class.
But we all hear of the idiosyncrasies of
English weather and food — it is perhaps
Oxford's social dynamics that most take
American students studying abroad by
surprise. It is often said the Oxford stu
dents are less friendly than American stu
dents — but to word the difference as such

is to make a value judgment on a cultural
difference.
To attempt to sum up an indescribable
characteristic of life at Oxford, friends are
not made quickly or casually, American
style "friendliness" — openly approaching
and speaking to strangers — is often con
sidered superficial. Friendships grow natu
rally from common activities and interests,
rather than being forced by self-introduc
tions.
Of course, a few pints of cider renders
all the above moot, and suddenly, the same
people who would not make eye contact
with you at dinner even though they say
right across from you are "snogging"
(making out) on the street after a boat club
formal or throwing their naked selves off
Magdalen Bridge on May Morning. And
they say that Oxford students are
repressed.
I'm always at a loss for words when peo
ple ask me if or why I am enjoying life at
Oxford. "The weather is bad, the food is
awful and the people are "unfriendly" — I
love it," doesn't really cut it, but somehow
seems to capture the sentiment in a
bizarre, paradoxical kind of way.

Angie hopes her state of repression won't
lead her to do anything drastic like her
Oxford counterparts.
