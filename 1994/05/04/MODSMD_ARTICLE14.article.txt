## Flicks was inappropriate forum for a political film 
### 
I TOO AM "repulsed and appalled"
(as stated in yesterday's letter
"Responses to video on grape boy
cott show intolerance of campus") by
the activities which took place on Sun
day evening at the 10 p.m. showing of
Flicks. That members of the student
body, including myself, should be held
hostage and be forced to watch a politi
cally motivated and biased film is com
pletely outrageous.
There is no room in the ASSU,
which manages Flicks as a business
project, for endorsement of a film such
as "No Grapes." Make no mistake: the
showing of "No Grapes" by the Flicks
staff can only be construed to mean
that the ASSU bureaucracy and deci
sionmakers think that all Flicks-goers
should support a grape boycott, appar
ently because these Flicks-goers, most

ly Stanford students, are incapable of
making their own informed decisions
and acting on them.
Let me be the first to identify
myself as one who raised my voice in
protest over the showing of the film
"No Grapes." But lest I am quickly
branded a "racist," permit me to point
out that race was not the topic of the
film. Instead, the film attempts to per
suade people to punish farmers for fol
lowing market demand.
Observe: consumers want to buy
nutritious, attractive foods, including
fruits such as table grapes. This moti
vates farmers to produce nutritious,
attractive foods. The nutrition comes
from nature, but attractive fruit is
blemish-free, and some blemishes can
be prevented only with pesticides. The
boycott is misguided — instead of

advocating that consumers support
organic farmers, the United Farm
Workers, by way of this film, are blam
ing market-conscious producers and
are urging consumers to punish farm
ers.
The United Farm Workers and their
campus supporters are welcome to use
any of the numerous avenues available
on campus for reaching students to
share their views, just as many organi
zations do. It is completely inappropri
ate for the ASSU bureaucracy and the
Flicks management to take sides on a
clearly divisive issue which is not
related to education or the fulfillment
of the mandates of the ASSU or Flicks.
If groups claiming they "have no
other forum for informing students"
except Flicks, as yesterday's letter
states, then we can look forward to

shorts courtesy of the Ku Klux Klan,
the Communist Party of the United
States, the Know-Nothings and a host
of other such groups — all of which
should be given the opportunity to per
suade students of the validity of their
positions on various issues.
Yes, the film "No Grapes" was met
with resistance and protest. The resis
tance and protest were motivated not
by racism, intolerance, or hate, but
instead by outrage over the endorse
ment of one side of an issue where
much debate has taken place, and
where such debate is far from over. My
message to the United Farm Workers:
take your film to White Plaza, where it
belongs, and out of Flicks.
