# Timing and placement of film contributed to mistaken comedic tone
## 
### 
A bunch of students go to a movie the
ater at 10 p.m. on a Sunday night to see a
popular comedy. They're looking for some
thing light and fun to get their weekend
started — hey, let's be honest, they're
there to see Robin Williams in a dress.
Before the film, a short subject is
shown. The short is more than a few
years old and has fairly poor production
quality. It's a lot like those old National
Geographic shorts we were all subjected
to in high school. Instead of taking this as
a serious opportunity to learn something,
audience members see only the surface
events of the short in a comedic light.
They laugh. They notice funny or
incongruous shots and pick out dialogue.
They create entertainment where none
was intended.
I realize that the short was produced

to teach people about an important situ
ation facing migrant workers. I realize
that the group who made it did so sever
al years ago on a limited budget, and
that it is certainly not their fault that
some aspects of their production seem
clumsy or awkward now. They weren't
going for quality filming, but rather for
a true representation. Let's be complete
ly honest, however, and admit that old,
low-budget shorts can have some pretty
amusing faults.
Now what about the audience? When
we go to a movie theater, we see cute lit
tle short subjects — cartoons, comic
bits, and trailers for other films. These
get us ready for the movie we are about
to see, much like the overture to a musi
cal. We're all conditioned to view such
shorts as entertainment. Even the trail
ers shown before "Schindler's List" had
comic moments.
Before a film such as "Mrs. Doubt
fire," one tends to see previews for other
big-budget comedies and family films:
"The Flintstones," "3 Ninjas," etc. Not
even a drama such as "Wolf' would nor

mally be previewed before this film. Is it
so unreasonable that we expect to see
comedy before comedy?
I agree that anyone who made loud
comments or ridiculed this well-meaning
short was rude. I agree that Stanford
students should be open to this type of
information. However, the decision to
show this short was poorly carried out.
A slide explaining what was to be shown
would have set the proper tone: "In
honor of Cinco de Mayo, we are showing
the short subject "No Grapes". This
short highlights the plight of migrant
workers ..."
If some random middle-aged guy
walked up to you on the street and told
you how to live your life, you would be
insulted and walk away. When the same
thing happens in a classroom at Stan
ford, it's called an ethics class. Context
is everything.
The students who chose to show this
short should be praised for their good
intentions. The students who ridiculed it
should be ashamed for their inexcusable
behavior. The situation, however, was

one which made that kind of reaction
more likely. No one went to the movies
intending to be insulting, and most
probably would not have done the same
thing in another set of circumstances.
Let's learn from this unfortunate
incident, not use it as an excuse for fur
ther resentment.
