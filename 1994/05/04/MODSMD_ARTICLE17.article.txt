## 'Microsatellites' to carry students' projects into orbit 
### Nikhil Raghavan 
Conventional satellites cost $50 mil
lion to $250 million to build and 10 to 15
years to design, but Aeronautics and
Astronautics Prof. Robert Twiggs, direc
tor of the Satellite Systems Development
Laboratory, has made it his objective to
work with students, faculty and volun
teer engineers from industry to design,
build and launch satellites at a fraction
of the cost of those which are commer
cially built — all within one year.
A satellite can serve a variety of func
tions, including working as a carrier for
testing equipment and conducting exper
iments in outer space. They are usually
designed around the type of equipment
they are going to carry, or pay load.
Twiggs has turned conventional prac
tice on its head by creating a program in
which students place first priority on the
satellite itself, making the payload a sec
ondary consideration.
The project's primary goal is to give
students hands-on experience building a
satellite within a short period of time. In
fact, the satellites are to be built and
launched rapidly enough that the entire
process can occur within the lifetime of
most master's students — one year.
"It is very exciting to design, test and
build an actual satellite and launch it
into space," said Kevin Statenfield who
in is charge of the satellite's computer
system. "It gives me a tremendous feel
ing of achievement."
The satellite that Twiggs' class is
presently building is a Satellite Quick
Research Testbed (SQUIRT) class satel
lite, meaning that it is considered small
and inexpensive.
SQUIRTs can carry a small payload of
two or three instruments. In industry,
satellites carry a high number of larger
devices.
When building for industry, satellite
designers have access to vast resources.
Though the students in Twiggs' class do
not have the same sort of funding and
production materials, this handicap has
fostered a keen sense of innovation in
the students. When a particular compo
nent is expensive, the students attempt
to modify another cheaper part that
might not fit perfectly to suit their pur
poses.
One of the instruments designed to fit
onto the microsatellite is a camera that
will take pictures of the Earth. "If the

Department of Defense was building a
satellite, [itl would have spent $500,000
on a custom-made camera," said Will
Kim, manager of the satellite's commu
nication subsystem.
"Instead we went to an electronics
shop and bought a $500 digital camera,"
he said. "It may not work as well as an
expensive camera, but it serves its pur
pose: to send images of the Earth to any
one who wants to take pictures."
The on-board instruments will receive
their energy from solar cells mounted on
eight graphite-epoxy panels. In order to
maximize efficiency in energy consump
tion, the satellite will be covered with
solar panels all sides.
Excess energy from the solar panels
will be used to charge the satellite's bat
tery, and in case the satellite enters a
dark spot, such as an eclipse, it will uti
lize the battery energy until it re-enters
the light. If the satellite runs out of ener
gy while out of the sunlight, the electri
cal systems will enter "safe mode" and
shut down until there is sufficient solar
energy to resume operation.
On occasion, spacecraft are disturbed
from their position — a condition which,
if unchecked, would hamper communica
tion with scientists on Earth.
In order to combat this likely occur
rence, the designers will mount six mag
nets along the sides of the satellite so if it
becomes disoriented, the magnets can
reorient it according to the direction of
the Earth's magnetic field. Future pro
jects might also see the use of Arcjets —
small thrusters used to move objects
around in space, said students in the
class.
Project members are still in the pro
cess of deciding what payload to put in
the satellite. Since the project's foremost
objective is education, the students want
to use the satellite to perform inexpen
sive experiments for faculty and to
encourage youngsters to learn about
space. Present plans call for the satellite
to carry a digital camera, a voice synthe
sizer and, possibly, an infrared sensor.
The digital camera will be operable by
radio signals on frequencies available to
amateur radio operators. This will allow
operators to instruct the camera to take
a picture of any part of the Earth at a
particular time.
The students also envision a voice
synthesizer on board so that anyone with
a simple radio will be able to receive a

broadcast message which will give the
satellite's current position and other
information.
Another possibility is to include exper
iments on the satellite that test new
research. Mechanical Engineering Prof.
Thomas Kenny is developing
"micromechanisms" that can greatly
improve space instruments, and Mechan
ical Engineering Prof. Mark Capelli is
developing small thrusters that could be
tested on a SQUIRT class satellite.
The satellite, once launched into
orbit, will operate for only two or three
years. Conditions in space are exceeding
ly harsh, and some of the satellite com
ponents — such as the solar panels and
the batteries — will deteriorate and wear
out in time.
But because most Master's students
graduate after one year at Stanford, the
satellite's short lifetime should not pose

a problem. The planned procedure is for
new students to operate the previous
year's satellite and work on a new satel
lite concurrently. This will enable the
students to make changes to the present
satellite if any design or functional prob
lems are found with the one from the
previous year.
In order to build and launch the satel
lite within one year, the entire design of
the satellite occurs in just four months.
Another three months go toward acquir
ing the components and building the
subsystems, the next three months see
the integration of the subsystems with
one another and, during the last few
months, the satellite is put through a
rigorous testing process.
"In industry rarely does one get to
work on more than a small aspect of
building the satellite," said Christopher
Kitts, an engineering graduate student

who is currently involved in the project.
"Usually the satellite [designl will be
broken into small tasks with each team
member focusing on one particular
aspect of the task.
"This class gives us the opportunity to
work on multiple — or all — aspects of
the satellite and so gain more breadth of
experience rather than a narrow special
ty in a particular subsystem of the
microsatellite," he said.
"The most important aspect of the
project is that the students do all the
work," Twiggs said. "The purpose of this
exercise is to educate engineering stu
dents, not to perform groundbreaking
research which students can only watch.
"They come from different back
grounds and have learned valuable com
munication and managerial skills,
besides the technical skills they have
honed," he said
