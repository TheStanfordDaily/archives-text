# Research sheds new light on AIDS
## Theory may offer way to combat symptoms 
### Michael Slemmer Editorial staff 
When an individual develops the
AIDS virus, a wide variety of symptoms
become visible — slowly destroying the
complex network of cellular interac
tions needed to maintain an effective
immune system.
Though AIDS research focuses on
finding a vaccine to cure the virus and
HIV, the virus that causes AIDS,
researchers are also working to slow
the immune system's destruction once
AIDS symptoms begin.
Working on one such effort,
researchers at the School of Medicine
are currently testing a theory which
would both explain one of the ways in
which the immune system loses its
function and provide clues about how
to treat the condition.
In doing this, Leonore and Leonard
Herzenberg, husband and wife genetics
professors at the Medical School, who
have taken part in some of the most
recent advancements in AIDS research,
are proposing that a significant amount
of the damage done by AIDS is actually
a misplaced immune response by the
human body itself.

'In HIV infections, there
is new evidence that
more programmed cell
death occurs than in
non-infected individuals'
— Leonard Herzenberg

Their research has centered around
glutathione, an important antioxida
tion agent which performs a wide vari
ety of duties necessary to cells' survival.
They have found that reducing the
amount of glutathione can kill T cells
— which are essential components of
the body's immune system and one of
the systems harmed by AIDS.
In a healthy T cell, glutathione stops
reactive oxygen molecules loose within
cells, so-called free radicals, from
punching holes in the cell membrane.
According to Leonard Herzenberg, the
free radicals "react with DNA and may
also induce programmed cell death."
However, current research at the
Medical Center has shown that when a
T cell's glutathione level drops to below
about 75 percent of normal, the cell is
likely to die. Equipped with this knowl

edge, the Stanford researchers have
suggested that the body's response to
the invasion of the HIV virus causes a
depletion of glutathione within these
key immune-response cells.
When outside entities, such as bacte
ria or viruses, enter the body, it
responds by releasing, among other
weapons, tumor necrosis factor (TNF).
According to Leonard Herzenberg, this
response signals the immune system to
release reactive oxygen intermediaries,
such as hydrogen peroxide, which then
engulf invaders and render them harm
less.
As a side effect, this release of reac
tive oxygen molecules uses up the avail
able glutathione within the T cells.
When an individual is healthy, this is
not a problem since the release of TNF
is ended once the invader has been
destroyed. In this way, "the level of glu
tathione is well regulated by the body
and the individual cells," Leonard
Herzenberg said.
But in the case of an invasion by the
HIV virus, the researchers' theory sug
gests that the body never stops produc
ing TNF and, as a consequence, glu
tathione levels are depleted in the T
cells — a change which renders the
immune system much less effective.
According to Leonard Herzenberg,
current research has supported this
conclusion. "In HIV infections, there is
new evidence that more programmed
cell death occurs than in non-infected
individuals," he said.

In order to treat this problem associ
ated with AIDS, researchers are cur
rently conducting clinical trials of N
acetylcysteine (NAC) on 64 patients.
This compound is known both to gen
erate glutathione and to have the abili
ty to permeate cells.
Because half of the test group is
being given NAC and the other half is
receiving a placebo, researchers hope to
notice a significant difference between
the two groups' glutathione levels.
Tests of a similar compound, procys
teine, are also being conducted to deter
mine effectiveness in combating the
destructiveness of AIDS within the
human body.
Though the compounds currently
being tested will not actually cure
patients who have contracted HIV,
they may be able to slow significantly
the destructive forces which attack the
patients' immune systems.
To this end, some AIDS support
groups are already releasing NAC to
the public, despite the fact that
research has not yet proven it to have
any noticeable affect.
"We will have to wait until results of
the tests are detectable before releasing
any data," Leonard Herzenberg said,
explaining why research data is not yet
available. Because half of the group
involved in the study is taking placebos,
once the "code is broken" and people
know whether or not the pills they are
swallowing are the real thing, the study
must be concluded.
