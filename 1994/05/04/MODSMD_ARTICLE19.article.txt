Q: Why does living in Columbae make
me oh-so regular ?
— stuck in the bathroom
A: Well, I assume that your problem
results from being vegetarian and eat
ing a plant-rich, fibrous diet, rather
than from any other strange Columbae prac
tices. Given this, your frequent bathroom
visits are probably a result of the "Metamucil
effect" — more fiber in the diet causes food to
pass through your system more quickly.
The body can actually speed up the rate at
which it pushes the food through your
intestines and colon. In addition, your body
tries to ease the internal traffic on your diges
tive highway by mixing some water in with
the half-digested food. The final result: "the
runs."
Incidentally, this helps explain why it
appears a high-fiber diet helps prevent cancer
of the gut. When food sits around in your
intestine or colon for a long time, all the car
cinogens and toxins in whatever you ate have
more time to hang out and do damage to your
insides. By flushing things quickly through
your digestive system, fiber keeps that
Twinkie from sticking around long enough to
give you cancer.
But, since most carcinogens are a result of
20th century revolutions in processed food,
the body didn't evolve this capability in order
to protect you from Twinkies. In fact, the
reasons for this go back to our distant prede
cessors, the early primates.
When dinner time came around in the jun
gle, there were two choices — eat leaves,
which are readily available but have relative
ly low protein and energy content, or search
out fruits and nuts, which are harder to find
and go out of season, but have more dietary
bang for the buck.
Species that chose to eat leaves developed
dietary tracts specifically designed for diets
high in fiber but low in nutrition. Some actu
ally developed a second stomach, like a cow's,
to permit them to digest the leaves and
extract all the nutritional content they could.
Others just evolved the "Metamucil reflex,"

which allowed them to pass the leaves
through more quickly, permitting them to
consume more food in a day, and thus meet
all their RDAs.
On the other hand, species that chose to
seek out the more rare but higher quality
foods (the gourmets of the early jungle) had to
develop the brainpower to find their food.
This involved a better visual system to recog
nize more nutritional food, improved memory
to remember where the good food was, and
the social skills to cooperate with others to
gather.
This all sounds good in theory — some pri
mates develop better stomachs so they can
get the most out of the low-nutrition food
they eat, while others develop the brains that
allow them to find better food.
But even better, there is experimental evi
dence to back this up. In a study at UCLA, it
was demonstrated that primates with larger
brains actually did forage out the most nutri
tional food, while those who were content
with eating low-quality leaves had smaller
brains. I will refrain from commenting on
what this implies about Stanford students
and Food Service.
There has also been shown to be a rough
correlation between the number of molars or
roundness of the teeth, and how low a species
is on the evolutionary scale. Species that are
more advanced developed the sharp teeth
that are necessary to eat fruit, nuts, and
meat, while those that stuck to "chewing the
cud" only needed molars.
Of course these two approaches are not
mutually exclusive, and it seems that
humans have taken advantage of both. We
use our brains to get highly nutritious food,
but when we can't, our system speeds it
through quickly so we can eat more, and we
get the runs.
However, next time you are heading to
Food Service, think about the fact that the
evolution of human intelligence may have
been driven by the desire to find better food.
