# Legal Office work to go off the Farm
## 8 attorneys axed, University hopes to save $1 million by using 3 firms 
### Rajiv Chandrasekaran Senior staff writer 
In a massive restructuring effort, the
University's Legal Office will lay off eight
attorneys and send much of its work to
three outside legal firms.
The changes, which are expected to save
$1 million per year and improve the legal
services Stanford receives, were announced
to the attorneys yesterday afternoon by
General Counsel Michael Roster.
Under the plan, six of the office's 16 at
torneys will constitute a "core staff' that
will handle academic and student affairs
and general business issues. Two other at
torneys will be retained to work in specific
areas of the University.
The office's four paralegals will be laid

off and some administra
tive positions may be cut
as well.
By securing long-term
contracts with large law
firms, Roster said varied
and specialized legal re
sources that are currently
unavailable in-house will
be accessible to Stanford
for less than the nearly $8

million the University now spends for its
legal services.
"We very much want to have outside ex
pertise involved in our legal services," Ros
ter said. "Since we will have both a core stafT
and outside lawyers working for us, we're


Roster
getting the best of both worlds."
But some lawyers in the office,
reeling from yesterday's announce
ment, privately said the changes
will not improve the quality of ser
vice or save money.
"Most people in the office don't
think this will be a cost savings,"
said one University attorney who
asked not to be named. "I don't
think the outside firms or those
making the decisions really under
stand what we do here."
Firms split work
According to sources close to the
office, the six attorneys who will
remain with the office are Roster,
Deputy General Counsel Michael
Hudnall and Assoc. General Coun
sel Iris Brest, as well as University
lawyers Tom Fenner, Jennifer
Westerlind and Lee Thompson.
Brest and Fenner currently han
dle academic affairs, Westerlind
deals with student affairs and risk
management, and Thompson over
sees environmental issues. Under
the new system, they will continue
to work in those areas.
In addition, University Counsel
Rachel Howard will work exclusive
ly for the Stanford Linear Accelera
tor Center and University Counsel
Margaret Eaton will handle legal
work for Stanford Hospital.
Although the final paperwork

has not yet been worked out, the
three firms will all commit to work
ing with the University for at least
one year, Roster said. He refused to
disclose specific terms of the con
tracts or the amount Stanford will
pay the firms.
During the first year, he said the
University will only save about
$500,000. After that, the savings are
expected to reach $1 million, he said.
The three selected firms are:
McCutchen, Doyle, Brown &
Enersen of San Francisco, which
will handle employment/labor, real
estate, land use and environmental
issues; Pillsbuiy, Madison & Sutro,
the Bay Area's largest law firm,
which will be responsible for indirect
costs and other government-related
issues; and Boston-based Ropes &
Gray, which will deal with medical
affairs, tax issues, intellectual prop
erty and some academic affairs.
Before the Legal Office was
established, McCutchen, Doyle,
Brown & Enersen handled much of
the University's legal work. It has
previously handled cases for Stan
ford dealing with academic freedom
issues, student and faculty rights,
and other academic issues.
Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro,
which has more than 600 attor
neys, currently handles much of
Stanford's litigation with the feder
al government over the indirect
costs of federally sponsored
research.
Ropes & Gray represents several
colleges and universities nation
wide and has expertise in medical

issues. The firm will advise Stan
ford on the formation of Stanford
Health Services, a recently
announced merger of the Stanford
Hospital, the School of Medicine
and affiliated local physicians.
A fourth firm, San Francisco
based Graham & James, will pro
vide some "basic" international
legal services to the University on a
pro bono basis, Roster said.
Roster said he hopes the outside
lawyers will engage in "preventa
tive medicine" by addressing issues
they see at other universities before
they become problems at Stanford.
"Just as Stanford is trying to cut
back, the U.S. government and the
state are raising more issues and
creating more legal problems," he
said. "By using this inside-outside
combination, we're hoping to solve
problems before they become major
problems."
The three primary firms will
each have at least one attorney
working on campus on a regular
basis, Roster said.
Attorneys criticize process
With more than half their co
workers laid off, many attorneys
and staff members in the Legal
Office said they "are filled with sad
ness and bitterness." No attorneys
or support staff contacted by The
Daily would agree to have their
names published, but many criti
cized the way the restructuring pro
cess was handled and said they
doubted how well the changes
would work.

"It was secretive, distrusting of
staff, disdainful of our feelings as
attorneys and support staff," one
attorney said. "It was clear from
the outset that options other than
using outsiders were never given
serious consideration."
Dismissing cost savings and
improved service as reasons, some
attorneys said internal politics and
a "desire for change" motivated the
restructuring.
"Some people think it's all polit
ical, that people associated with the
previous administration are being
laid off," said another attorney.
Roster said neither political rea
sons nor a simple desire for change
are behind the changes.
"Making these changes creates
such emotional difficulties," he
said. "This has been a horrendous
process for me. There is simply no
way that I did this for the sake of
making change."
The attorneys contacted by The
Daily also doubted whether the
plan would save the University sig
nificant amounts of money in the
long run. They said firms will likely
sign cut-rate contracts with Stan
ford now and then raise their rates
in a few years when the agreements
are renegotiated. At that time, the
attorneys contended, the Universi
ty will be in a captive position
because it will not want to change
legal services again.
"1 don't think many attorneys in
the office think that it will result in
a cost savings down the road," said
one of the attorneys. "Once you add

up the expenses it's not clear that
there will be a lot of savings — and
there will be a high level of risk."
Former University General
Counsel John Schwartz — who left
Stanford last year after 11 years in
his position — said he too is skepti
cal of the restructuring plan.
"In short, they have come up
with a very complex situation that
doesn't allow for reasonable cer
tainty that it will save money and
quality," said Schwartz, who is cur
rently general counsel of Systemix,
a Palo Alto-based biotechnology
firm. "The fact that the firms will
have one or two people on campus
— it won't be sufficient to provide
the same level of quality."
Three approaches studied
Roster announced in February
that the office would examine three
different restructuring options:
having several firms handle sepa
rate portions of Stanford's work
(the option that was chosen); hav
ing one firm handle all the office's
work; or using one or more firms to
provide consulting services to the
University.
The University solicited bids
from 12 top law firms throughout
the nation, and Roster has spent the
last several months working with
Hudnall, Brest and Linda Wood
ward, the office's administrator,
choosing which firms to work with.
Initially, Roster said he was
skeptical that any of the bids would
save money, but when he received
the proposals from the interested

firms, he said he was "quite sur
prised."
The approach of giving all the
University's work to one firm was
the cheapest, but most risky choice,
Roster said.
"We decided not to use only one
firm because we didn't want to be
captive to one firm. We wanted to
see some competition between
them," he said.
Roster said he is planning to
schedule meetings with administra
tors, faculty and staff who frequent
ly use the Office to inform
them of the changes and introduce
them to the firms with whom they
will be working. The office will also
put together an informational book
let about the changes.
Some of the attorneys and par
alegals who have been laid off may
be hired by one of the firms, Roster
said. He said one of the firms told
him they plan to interview all of the
laid-off attorneys.
He acknowledged that the pro
cess has created a great deal of
"uncertainty and difficulty for
many people in the office," but he
said a large-scale restructuring was
unavoidable.
"If you let an organization go in
perpetuity without exploring
change, the organization gets rigid,"
Roster said. "An organization some
times has to push itself to renew
itself, and sometimes you can do it
internally and sometimes you have
to bring in outside stimuli.
"It's necessary, but it's a very
difficult process," he added.
In a massive restructuring effort, the
University's Legal Office will lay off eight
attorneys and send much of its work to
three outside legal firms.
The changes, which are expected to save
$1 million per year and improve the legal

Roster said he hopes the outside
lawyers will engage in "preventa
tive medicine" by addressing issues
they see at other universities before
they become problems at Stanford.
"Just as Stanford is trying to cut
back, the U.S. government and the
state are raising more issues and
creating more legal problems," he
said. "By using this inside-outside
combination, we're hoping to solve
problems before they become major
problems."
The three primary firms will
each have at least one attorney
working on campus on a regular
basis, Roster said.
Attorneys criticize process
With more than half their co
workers laid off, many attorneys
and staff members in the Legal
Office said they "are filled with sad
ness and bitterness." No attorneys
or support staff contacted by The
Daily would agree to have their
names published, but many criti
cized the way the restructuring pro
cess was handled and said they
doubted how well the changes
would work.

"It was secretive, distrusting of
staff, disdainful of our feelings as
attorneys and support staff," one
attorney said. "It was clear from
the outset that options other than
using outsiders were never given
serious consideration."
Dismissing cost savings and
improved service as reasons, some
attorneys said internal politics and
a "desire for change" motivated the
restructuring.
"Some people think it's all polit
ical, that people associated with the
previous administration are being
laid off," said another attorney.
Roster said neither political rea
sons nor a simple desire for change
are behind the changes.
"Making these changes creates
such emotional difficulties," he
said. "This has been a horrendous
process for me. There is simply no
way that I did this for the sake of
making change."
The attorneys contacted by The
Daily also doubted whether the
plan would save the University sig
nificant amounts of money in the
long run. They said firms will likely
sign cut-rate contracts with Stan
ford now and then raise their rates
in a few years when the agreements
are renegotiated. At that time, the
attorneys contended, the Universi
ty will be in a captive position
because it will not want to change
legal services again.
"1 don't think many attorneys in
the office think that it will result in
a cost savings down the road," said
one of the attorneys. "Once you add

up the expenses it's not clear that
there will be a lot of savings — and
there will be a high level of risk."
Former University General
Counsel John Schwartz — who left
Stanford last year after 11 years in
his position — said he too is skepti
cal of the restructuring plan.
"In short, they have come up
with a very complex situation that
doesn't allow for reasonable cer
tainty that it will save money and
quality," said Schwartz, who is cur
rently general counsel of Systemix,
a Palo Alto-based biotechnology
firm. "The fact that the firms will
have one or two people on campus
— it won't be sufficient to provide
the same level of quality."
Three approaches studied
Roster announced in February
that the office would examine three
different restructuring options:
having several firms handle sepa
rate portions of Stanford's work
(the option that was chosen); hav
ing one firm handle all the office's
work; or using one or more firms to
provide consulting services to the
University.
The University solicited bids
from 12 top law firms throughout
the nation, and Roster has spent the
last several months working with
Hudnall, Brest and Linda Wood
ward, the office's administrator,
choosing which firms to work with.
Initially, Roster said he was
skeptical that any of the bids would
save money, but when he received
the proposals from the interested

firms, he said he was "quite sur
prised."
The approach of giving all the
University's work to one firm was
the cheapest, but most risky choice,
Roster said.
"We decided not to use only one
firm because we didn't want to be
captive to one firm. We wanted to
see some competition between
them," he said.
Roster said he is planning to
schedule meetings with administra
tors, faculty and staff who frequent
ly use the Office to inform
them of the changes and introduce
them to the firms with whom they
will be working. The office will also
put together an informational book
let about the changes.
Some of the attorneys and par
alegals who have been laid off may
be hired by one of the firms, Roster
said. He said one of the firms told
him they plan to interview all of the
laid-off attorneys.
He acknowledged that the pro
cess has created a great deal of
"uncertainty and difficulty for
many people in the office," but he
said a large-scale restructuring was
unavoidable.
"If you let an organization go in
perpetuity without exploring
change, the organization gets rigid,"
Roster said. "An organization some
times has to push itself to renew
itself, and sometimes you can do it
internally and sometimes you have
to bring in outside stimuli.
"It's necessary, but it's a very
difficult process," he added.
In a massive restructuring effort, the
University's Legal Office will lay off eight
attorneys and send much of its work to
three outside legal firms.
The changes, which are expected to save
$1 million per year and improve the legal
services Stanford receives, were announced
to the attorneys yesterday afternoon by
General Counsel Michael Roster.
Under the plan, six of the office's 16 at
torneys will constitute a "core staff' that
will handle academic and student affairs
and general business issues. Two other at
torneys will be retained to work in specific
areas of the University.
The office's four paralegals will be laid

off and some administra
tive positions may be cut
as well.
By securing long-term
contracts with large law
firms, Roster said varied
and specialized legal re
sources that are currently
unavailable in-house will
be accessible to Stanford
for less than the nearly $8

million the University now spends for its
legal services.
"We very much want to have outside ex
pertise involved in our legal services," Ros
ter said. "Since we will have both a core stafT
and outside lawyers working for us, we're


Roster
getting the best of both worlds."
But some lawyers in the office,
reeling from yesterday's announce
ment, privately said the changes
will not improve the quality of ser
vice or save money.
"Most people in the office don't
think this will be a cost savings,"
said one University attorney who
asked not to be named. "I don't
think the outside firms or those
making the decisions really under
stand what we do here."
Firms split work
According to sources close to the
office, the six attorneys who will
remain with the office are Roster,
Deputy General Counsel Michael
Hudnall and Assoc. General Coun
sel Iris Brest, as well as University
lawyers Tom Fenner, Jennifer
Westerlind and Lee Thompson.
Brest and Fenner currently han
dle academic affairs, Westerlind
deals with student affairs and risk
management, and Thompson over
sees environmental issues. Under
the new system, they will continue
to work in those areas.
In addition, University Counsel
Rachel Howard will work exclusive
ly for the Stanford Linear Accelera
tor Center and University Counsel
Margaret Eaton will handle legal
work for Stanford Hospital.
Although the final paperwork

has not yet been worked out, the
three firms will all commit to work
ing with the University for at least
one year, Roster said. He refused to
disclose specific terms of the con
tracts or the amount Stanford will
pay the firms.
During the first year, he said the
University will only save about
$500,000. After that, the savings are
expected to reach $1 million, he said.
The three selected firms are:
McCutchen, Doyle, Brown &
Enersen of San Francisco, which
will handle employment/labor, real
estate, land use and environmental
issues; Pillsbuiy, Madison & Sutro,
the Bay Area's largest law firm,
which will be responsible for indirect
costs and other government-related
issues; and Boston-based Ropes &
Gray, which will deal with medical
affairs, tax issues, intellectual prop
erty and some academic affairs.
Before the Legal Office was
established, McCutchen, Doyle,
Brown & Enersen handled much of
the University's legal work. It has
previously handled cases for Stan
ford dealing with academic freedom
issues, student and faculty rights,
and other academic issues.
Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro,
which has more than 600 attor
neys, currently handles much of
Stanford's litigation with the feder
al government over the indirect
costs of federally sponsored
research.
Ropes & Gray represents several
colleges and universities nation
wide and has expertise in medical

issues. The firm will advise Stan
ford on the formation of Stanford
Health Services, a recently
announced merger of the Stanford
Hospital, the School of Medicine
and affiliated local physicians.
A fourth firm, San Francisco
based Graham & James, will pro
vide some "basic" international
legal services to the University on a
pro bono basis, Roster said.
Roster said he hopes the outside
lawyers will engage in "preventa
tive medicine" by addressing issues
they see at other universities before
they become problems at Stanford.
"Just as Stanford is trying to cut
back, the U.S. government and the
state are raising more issues and

them of the changes and introduce
them to the firms with whom they
will be working. The office will also
put together an informational book
let about the changes.
Some of the attorneys and par
alegals who have been laid off may
be hired by one of the firms, Roster
said. He said one of the firms told
him they plan to interview all of the
laid-off attorneys.
He acknowledged that the pro
cess has created a great deal of
"uncertainty and difficulty for
many people in the office," but he
said a large-scale restructuring was
unavoidable.
"If you let an organization go in
perpetuity without exploring
change, the organization gets rigid,"
Roster said. "An organization some
times has to push itself to renew
itself, and sometimes you can do it
internally and sometimes you have
to bring in outside stimuli.
"It's necessary, but it's a very
difficult process," he added.
