## Ace trio Pitchers Middlebrook, Bartels and Reed form key mound triumvirate 
### Andy Eiser Senior staff writer 
Imagine a baseball team that eryoys the ser
vices of an "ace," a pitcher who gives his team
a chance to win nearly every time he takes the
mound.
Next, envision a squad with two aces, a pair
of hurlers who provide a proverbial 1-2 punch
and who shut hitters down with equal ability.
Now go one step further, if you can. Dream
of a team with three aces, or even better, three
starters who utilize three different approaches
and can keep opponents guessing through an
entire weekend series.
Too good to be true? Not at Sunken Dia
mond this season, where Dan Reed, Todd Bar
tels and Jason Middlebrook have posted a
flashy 20-7 combined record and a sterling 3.52
earned-run average to lift Cardinal baseball to
the top of the Pacific 10 Conference Southern
Division and a No. 13 national ranking.
"We've got our own styles, and I guess it
works out," said Reed, a left-handed sopho
more from McLean, Va.
A standout among aces, Reed anchors the
staff with a season 9-3 record and 3.10 ERA.
Relying on a calculated mixture of fastballs,
curveballs and sliders, he gains on craftiness
what he loses on scouts' radar guns.
"I've been learning, and I'm lucky because I
can win without real good control," Reed said.
Reed had done a lot of winning heading into
Saturday's start against Sacramento State. In
fact, he had posted seven straight victories, giv
ing him a total of nine to tie for third in the
nation. But against a Sacramento State squad
with a team batting average in the .3205, Reed
surrendered six runs on nine hits in five
innings to take the loss.
"I guess my luck ran out," Reed said.
Good fortune also eluded Stanford's second
starter last weekend, as Bartels, a sophomore
right-hander from Omaha, Neb., yielded 10
runs on 11 hits in 4-1/3 horrific innings Sunday
in Sacramento. But that performance stands
as an anomaly, and even a 5-3 record and 4.79
ERA belay his effectiveness.
"Todd has real good control with four pitch
es," Middlebrook said. "He has a great fastball,
but he doesn't rely on it completely because he
can throw the changeup, curve and slider for
strikes."

While his two complete games tie him with
Reed for the team lead, Bartels' control makes
a shambles of the Six-Pac's "walks per nine
innings" statistic. Issuingjust seven free pass
es in 67-2/3 innings, his scant 0.94 average
leaves USC's Randy Flores in the dust at 2.16.
But control is definitely not the buzzword
for Middlebrook, a fireballing freshman right
hander from Grass Lake, Mich. In fact, in 48-
2/3 innings, he has walked a staggering 31
batters. But with a fastball that has been
clocked in the 90-plus mph range, Middle
brook has recorded 48 strikeouts on the sea
son while solidifying his hold on the third
starting spot.
"I attack with mv fastball every hitter,

regardless of who he is," said Middlebrook,
adding that his slider serves a mainly decora
tive purpose and is "not thrown for strikes."
Middlebrook (6-1, 2.59) owns the best win
ning percentage and P]RA of the three regulars,
not coincidental given the strategy of Cardinal
head coach Mark Marquess.
"I have the second and third guys in a series
do advanced charting before their starts,"
Marquess said.
Loosely translated, this means that Middle
brook, who starts Sunday Six-Pac games, has
the benefit of watching Reed pitch on Friday
and Bartels on Saturday before he takes on the
exact same lineup.
"I can watch what works and adapt it for
myself," Middlebrook said.
Perhaps that adaptation, the atmosphere
created when quality rubs off on other players,
makes Stanford's overachieving rotation
unique. A quick look at the Arizona series two
weekends ago speaks of this synergy: Reed
went six innings Friday to pick up his seventh
Six-Pac win without a loss, Bartels tossed a
complete-game victory in the first of a double
header Sunday and Middlebrook slammed the
door with seven solid innings in the nightcap.
Three up, three down.
Still, while the Cardinal starters clearly ben
efit from positive reinforcement, they draw a
line between adaptation and outright mimicry.
"Every pitcher has has own 'out-pitches,'
and we don't imitate each other," Reed said.
"I agree, you can't imitate," Middlebrook
said. "It's hard enough figuring out your own
style."
With six games remaining in a conference
race Stanford holds in its hand, the Cardinal
hopes the trio will continue to ride the momen
tum that has led it to a 10-2 combined record in
their last 15 Six-Pac starts.
But regardless of how the regular season
winds up, or how Stanford fares in postseason
play, fans can take comfort in knowing all three
will return next season.
"We're still thinking about this year, but
Todd and I got better from the experience of
last year and I'm sure Jason will do the same
thing," Reed said.
Can they improve upon an already success
ful campaign?
Anything can happen with three aces up
your sleeve.

Reed comprise two-thirds of the team's successful battery.
