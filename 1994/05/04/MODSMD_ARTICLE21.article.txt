# Cardinal comes up short in 10-inning battle with Spartans
## Offense continues to struggle in 2-1 loss 
### Andy Eiser Senior staff writer 
SAN JOSE â€” Bases loaded,
two outs, tied game, bottom of
the 10th inning.
San Jose State senior third
baseman Gene Bower stepped up
to the plate last night in a situa
tion many people dream about,
and came through with a single
to left field to give his Spartans a
2-1 victory over the No. 13 Cardi
nal baseball team at Municipal
Stadium.
"I wanted to come up big
because I felt that I hadn't done a
lot this year," said Bower, who
had a .252 batting average com
ing into the game and made his
only hit of the night count.
"There was not a lot of pressure
on me because the game would
still go on if I made out."
The pressure rested squarely
on Tom Reimers, the freshman
closer for Stanford (31-20) called
in when freshman Brendan Sulli
van surrendered a leadoff double
to senior reserve rightfielder
Paul Soares in the extra frame.
Reimers intentionally walked
junior shortstop Jason Boesch to
set up a force play, and saw
senior pinch hitter Chris Chiotel
lis bunt the runners to second
and third.
Throwing a steady diet of out
side pitches, Reimers then struck
out senior second baseman Mike
Carrigg and, with two outs, the
Cardinal infielders returned to
their normal depths.
Reimers proceeded to get two
strikes on senior centerfielder
Laverne Thomas, but lost him
and loaded the bases to draw the
infield in and set up Bower's
moment.
"I wanted to get that pitch in
on him, because with most guys,
if you put something good on the
pitch, something good happens,"
said Reimers of Bower's heroics.
"He just hit it into no-man's
land."
Unfortunately for Stanford,
that no-man's land between the
infield and outfield translated
into a win for San Jose State (27-
22), which sent the Cardinal to
its fourth loss in a just-conclu
ded five-game non-conference
stretch.
"This is big for us because we
want to win as many as we can
against Bay Area opponents,"
Bower said.
Meanwhile, Stanford's record
outside the Pacific 10 Conference

fell to 14-13, as the Six-Pac-lead
ing Cardinal continued to display
its split personality. Unlike two
weekend losses to Sacramento
State, however, Stanford's pitch
ing held up last night and served
to accentuate the club's ongoing

hitting woes.
"We talked
after the game,
and (Cardinal
head) coach
(Mark) Marquess
said that our
effort was great
and our ap
proach was good,
but that we just
weren't able to

put it all together," said sopho
more centerfielder Cale Carter.
Matt Marenghi started for the
Cardinal and went five innings,
allowing a run in the bottom of
the fourth when freshman first
baseman Jamey Wood walked,
advanced to second on a wild
pitch and scored on a double by
junior designated hitter Eric Pitt.
Sullivan (1-1) came on for the
long relief assignment in the
sixth, and faced the minimum
number of Spartans batters until
Soares' double four innings later.
But he harbored no ill will toward
Reimers, whose pitch to Bower
pinned Sullivan with the loss.
"That's just baseball. Nine
times out of 10, Tommy retires
that guy, but (Bower) deserves
credit for fighting that pitch off,"
Sullivan said.
The Cardinal managed to push
across its lone run in the seventh
off senior reliever Jeff Garrett,
San Jose State's fifth pitcher of
the night. Junior leftfielder Steve
Carver led off with a double to the
left-center field gap, advanced to
third on an infield single by
sophomore rightfielder BrodTe
Van Wagenen and scored on a
double-play grounder by fresh
man shortstop Eric Sees.
Carter, whose 11-game hitting
streak was snapped Monday in
Stanford's victory over San Fran
cisco State, then mustered the
first of two hits when he beat out
a grounder to second base.
Sophomore third baseman Brian
Dallimore beat out a grounder to
third and advanced Carter to
third, but junior second baseman
Jed Hansen fiied out to center to
end the Cardinal threat.
Richard Smith, normally the
Spartans' closer, pitched the
ninth and 10th innings, yielding
only two hits to improve to 3-1.
