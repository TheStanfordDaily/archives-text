# Bloopers and blunders: the ugly truth behind Daily Softball
## 
### 
I finally empathize with Rodney Dangerfield. On
Sunday, I ventured out to the softball diamond to
assist my Daily colleagues in the annual clash with
the Knight Fellows, a group of professional journalists
on one-year paid scholarships at Stanford.
Therefore, the matchup is set up as the pros against
the amateurs. Little did I know that when it comes to
soflball, wc were supposed to be the pros.
And I was out there, innocent, unassuming, taking
the sun in and enjoying the day.
I'll admit, I was not prepared to play professional
journalist softball, mentally or physically. Operating on
a mere four hours' sleep after a failed attempt to secure
Sharks playoff tickets, I was not in peak form. Far from
it. I was out there, au casual. For the love of the game.
I looked like a bidlplayer (except that I forgot my
chaw). I even soundexl like a ballplayer. And despite my
teammates' saying otherwise, I played like a ballplayer.
(Not a very good one, but who's checking? It's not as if
there were scouts out there. Then, and only then,
would I display my true talent.)
I never professed to be good at softball. I'll readily
admit, it's not my best sport. There's coordination
involved that is tough to handle when lacking shut-eye
and nursing a hangover. Nevertheless, my peers at The
Daily, based on my writing subject, assumed that I
would be a contender.
Sorry sports fans, I'm no Rob Ross.
But I was spirited and put forth an efTort. It's not an
effort I'm proud of, but if it was, I wouldn't be writing
this column, because the result would have been

expected.
My performance Sunday was all for shock value.
It all started innocently enough. I was playing third
base during alternate innings, and my first defensive
effort was a,gem. A true masterpiece. No errors. The
fact that a ball was not hit remotely in my direction is
completely irrelevant.
Then came my at bat. I slapped my shoes with my
bat (a tip from Jesse "The Body" Johannesen, a la Dave

Win field) and
fouled off the first
pitch. I then was
way in front of the
second pitch, and
whiffed on a third
pitch that was not
even in David
Robinson's strike
zone. Out on
strikes. I wasn't

concentrating. I
think the fact that there was not a P.A. announcer to
tell the crowd who I was and that I was in fact batting
threw me off. As my teammates chided my misfortune,
I vowed to redeem myself.
Yeah, and Madonna vowed to her priest she would
remain celibate.
Flash forward to the fifth inning. The Knight Fel
lows, in a conscious attempt to destroy my psyche, let
all of their little kids bat. The third batter, a 7-year-old
clad in yellow, smacked a grounder right at me. It went

right through my legs. I tell ya, thus kid's got a future.
Luckily, the shortstop was right behind me and
gunned it to first. But I wasn't phased. After all, the
kids' at-bats were not a part of the official statistics. As
far as the official book was concerned, I still was having
an error-free afternoon.
loiter that same inning, I had my one decent play of
the afternoon. I fielded a grounder and threw it to first.
5-3 for the out.
But that was the end of my glory. I played outfield
for an inning before taking a breather.
After seven and a half innings, the score was tied at
5-5. The Daily took to the plate and we rallied for
awhile. I almost was a part of it.
By the time it was my turn to bat, we had scored
another five runs to bring the tally to 10-5, a runner
was poised on second with one out.
I was determined. This was my chance. I kept
promising myself that a nap was only another hour
away.
The first pitch came, and hit me square in the left
shoulder. At last, I thought, I'm on base! Then I was
informed that the hit-by-pitch rule doesn't apply to
softball. Who came up with that one? I was ready to
brawl. This was a travesty of justice — or at least of my
pride. I reluctantly went back to the batter's box.
The next pitch came and I was way in front of it for
a strike. Someone from the Daily sidelines then yelled
at me: "Schwartz, you don't have to swing at every
pitch." OK, wiseguy, I won't. The next pitch was right
down the middle, and 1 watched it all the way, from the

pitcher's hand to the catcher's glove.
I was down to my last pitch. I let the next one go by
for a ball. Then, the pitcher served it up — and I laced
it. Deep. Yet in my disbelief after actually connecting
with the ball, I tripped over my own feet and did a face
plant in the dirt.
I never made it to first base.
After the third out was made, we took the field for
the top of the ninth. The Knights had runners at the
corners when it was my turn in the spotlight again. A
grounder was hit to me, and, instead of throwing to
first, I decided to throw home. My toss went over our
catcher's head, and another run scored.
1 was then ejected from the game — by my own team.
The Knights protested, saying that this was against
the rules. At least somebody was on my side.
Anyway, I tried to justify my place on the Daily ros
ter later in that inning, when I chest-butted Examiner
photographer Kim Komenich, who bowled over our
catcher while scoring a run. I'll admit, I did it all for the
cameras.
Anyway, even though the game ended, my experi
ence was far from over, as my teammates rehashed my
gaffes again and again. I even had to read about it in the
next days paper.
Bottom line, I lent personality to the event. I was
true to the adage, it's not whether you win or lose, it's
how you play the game. And I played it with panache.

Twenty-sewn inches of self-mockery is pretty funny, eh ?
Good job, Dave.
