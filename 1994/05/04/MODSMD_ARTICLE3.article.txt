In its first gathering last night, the 1994-
95 ASSU Senate chose graduate student
Nawwar Kasrawi as its senate chair.
Kasrawi was elected last month as a grad
uate senator to represent the Schools of
Earth Sciences and Engineering, and he has
previously served as an undergraduate and
graduate senator.
"I'm looking forward to getting a lot of
work done," Kasrawi said after his selection
as chair.
Among his plans, Kasrawi said, are im
proving communications between the sen
ate and its various committees and "utilizing
the committee structure to its maximum ef
fect."
Kasrawi also stressed the senate chair's
duties outside of the senate, such as manag
ing senate affairs and "keeping up with

events" occurring in and around the Univer
sity.
Also seeking the position of senate chair
last night were graduate senator Curtis Kin
and undergraduate senator Michelle Gee.
The three candidates offered the senate a
variety of backgrounds — Kasrawi's previ
ous senate experience, Kin's work as parlia
mentarian of the student senate at USC and
author of its constitution, and Gee's admin
istrative experience as ASSU secretary.
But all three presented similar visions of
the role of the senate chair, arguing that the
chair must be both an impartial moderator
of senate meetings and an individual who
provides leadership and assistance to less ex
perienced senators.
But the other senators — many of whom
are newcomers to the senate — questioned
that vision of the chair's role.
