# Kasrawi elected new ASSU Senate chair
## 
### Jim Luh Staff writer 
In its first gathering last night, the 1994-
95 ASSU Senate chose graduate student
Nawwar Kasrawi as its senate chair.
Kasrawi was elected last month as a grad
uate senator to represent the Schools of
Earth Sciences and Engineering, and he has
previously served as an undergraduate and
graduate senator.
"I'm looking forward to getting a lot of
work done," Kasrawi said after his selection
as chair.
Among his plans, Kasrawi said, are im
proving communications between the sen
ate and its various committees and "utilizing
the committee structure to its maximum ef
fect."
Kasrawi also stressed the senate chair's
duties outside of the senate, such as manag
ing senate affairs and "keeping up with

events" occurring in and around the Univer
sity.
Also seeking the position of senate chair
last night were graduate senator Curtis Kin
and undergraduate senator Michelle Gee.
The three candidates offered the senate a
variety of backgrounds — Kasrawi's previ
ous senate experience, Kin's work as parlia
mentarian of the student senate at USC and
author of its constitution, and Gee's admin
istrative experience as ASSU secretary.
But all three presented similar visions of
the role of the senate chair, arguing that the
chair must be both an impartial moderator
of senate meetings and an individual who
provides leadership and assistance to less ex
perienced senators.
But the other senators — many of whom
are newcomers to the senate — questioned
that vision of the chair's role.
But others saw value in a senate
chair taking on leadership respon
sibilities.
"I would like to see the senate
chair help us," said undergraduate
senator Michael Choo. "I would
like for them to offer some leader
ship."
After a question and answer
session with the three candidates
and lengthy debate, graduate sena
tor Donald Aingworth made a
motion to nominate Neil Crellin, a
graduate senator in the current
senate, but not an elected member
of next year's legislature.
As Crellin was about to begin
making an opening statement,
undergraduate senator Michael
Choo requested a recess, which

acting chair Greg Waldorf was
quick to grant.
At the close of the recess, grad
uate senator Marc Oppenheimer
moved to call the vote to question.
The senate approved the motion,
and a secret ballot named Kas
rawi the winner with 12 of 20
votes.
Crellin said he was disappointed
by the decision not to allow him to
make an opening statement and
answer questions.
"What the senate has demon
strated is that it is a closed shop,"
Crellin said, saying that the new
senate was trying to keep non-sen
ators out of meetings.
But Oppenheimer said he had
no intention of shutting Crellin out
of the race for chair, pointing out
that if Crellin had really wanted
the position, there had been
"months" for him to declare his
candidacy.
