# Lecturer's leave irks Biz students
## 150 protest popular teacher's departure at Town Hall meeting 
### Colleen Krueger Romesh Ratnesar Staff writers 
The announcement that popular
Business School lecturer Jim Collins will
not be teaching next year has unleashed
a firestorm of questions about the cur
rent Graduate School of Business ad
ministration's commitment to teaching,
culminating in an angry town hall meet
ing held Monday night.
The meeting, attended by more than
150 students, was called by Assoc. Deans
Garth Saloner and George Parker in re

sponse to student complaints about
Collins' departure. But the deans re
sponded to a question late in the session
by effectively nixing any chance that
Collins would teach next year.
Meanwhile, pockets of second-year
students are threatening to withhold fu
ture donations to the Business School if
Collins is not allowed to teach next year.
The furor surrounds the administra
tion's rejection of Collins' request to
teach one section of his course in small
business management — a class that is
regularly oversubscribed — in the spring
of next year. Collins, who graduated

from the Business School in 1983, has
been teaching the course since 1987.
Collins is voluntarily taking next year
off to promote a forthcoming book, but
he had hoped to continue a reduced
teaching schedule.
The Business School administration's
decision has galvanized student oppo
nents who fear that Collins — generally
acknowledged as among the school's
most charismatic and skillful teachers —
is-being treated unfairly and perhaps
nudged out. And some say the controver-

sy also highlights the real ques
tion of whether the Business
School favors the research done
by tenured faculty over the
teaching ability of part-time lec
turers.
"We touched a nerve here and
the nerve we touched is one relat
ing to the whole issue of teaching
quality," Saloner said, adding
that "I don't think the Business
School has had an administration
more concerned with teaching
quality than the one we have
now."
According to Saloner, the
administration offered Collins a
one-year sabbatical to finish his
book — a "highly unusual" ges
ture to a non-tenured faculty

member. "He's been here five to
six years, and on the tenure side
that would mean we'll give that
individual a break in the form of a
sabbatical," he said. "Unlike the
Duracell bunny, these people
can't just keep going."
But since Collins is a lecturer,
his contract is renewed on a one
year basis. Due to an uncertain
budget picture, Collins has not yet
been offered a contract for 1995-
96.
That has some students ques
tioning the administration's
motives in refusing to allow
Collins to teach a reduced course
load.
Second-year student Kim Tay
lor said that the administration
claims that it doesn't want
Collins' popular course to com
pete with several new
entrepreneurship courses being
offered next year, taught by

tenure-line faculty. "It is an
incredibly ironic thing for a busi
ness school to do," she said.
Aside from the sabbatical
issue, the administration report
edly wanted to make room for
these new classes, and to avoid a
massive stampede of students try
ing to use their "Silver Bullets" —
or special priority rankings — on
the single section. As it is, at least
one-third of the student who
apply lose their Silver Bullet pri
ority and are turned away from
each of Collins' two sections
annually.
"It makes me personally
angry," Taylor said, adding that
Collins' treatment "signals that
the GSB wants to be a group of
self-serving academics writing
their ponderous prose for their
peers rather than being interested
in teaching or being about real
world business practice."

Since teaching quality at the
Business School has not been as
good as she expected it to be, Tay
lor said that "wasting precious
teaching resources" further frus
trates her.
But others have questioned
both Collins' expectations of Busi
ness School officials and his diplo
macy within the school.
"A friend of mine described
him as either extremely naive or
somewhat slimy in his tactics, as
he never goes to the administra
tion directly but simply lets it be
known that he is unhappy with
their decisions," said one second
year student.
Others agreed that Collins has
gone out of his way to "burn a lot
of bridges" with tenure-line facul
ty, both personally and as an out
spoken critic of the school's
research side.
"I think it's ridiculous for him

to think that he is going to find a
home here just like a tenured
research professor," the student
added. "It's a long haul to get
from five or six years of uncer
tainty in grad school to a guar
anteed life position at the coun
try's number-one business
school."
Second-year student Leo Lin
back also pointed to the notice
ably awkward and sometimes
contentious nature of Collins'
relationship with other faculty.
"Jim is a maverick, a true believ
er. .. . He's very opinionated
and strong-willed, and a lot of
faculty disagree with him," he
said. "In the past he's been a dif
ficult type for the faculty to
warm up to.
"Neither side has really
reached out to the other," Lin
back added. "It's sort of like a
playground fight."
