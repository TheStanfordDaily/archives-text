# Interracial dating
## Students discuss cultural differences 
### Laura Shin 
Multiculturalism with a twist
— interracial relationships — was
the topic of discussion last night in
the Branner lounge.
Students Speaking About Race
and Culture (SSpARC) — a group
designed to promote campus dis
cussion of race and ethnicity —
asked four interracial couples to
talk about the difficulties and ben
efits of their dating experiences.
The event was part of the periodic
Branner Presents speaker series.
"Quite frankly, race was some
thing I didn't feel was a barrier,"
said sophomore I'ippa Scarlett.
Scarlett is an African-American
who is dating sophomore Jake
Dorman, who is Jewish. "There
were some odd times when we'd go
to a dance, like Hip Hop Night. . .

hut that's not an issue anymore."
Cultural differences were also
introduced as another obstacle in
interracial relationships. "It
didn't even cross my mind that we
were interracial. Our biggest prob
lem was more intercultural," said
senior Troy Erickson, a gay Cau
casian who is dating a Chicano.
His partner, who asked not to
be identified, said that although
the difference in cultures was at
first the largest problem, "the cul
tural difference helps keep some of
the attraction too."
The two recounted some
"seemingly culturally insignifi
cant" customs that caused snags
in their relationship, such as eat
ing slowly or quickly at meals,
reading the newspaper while eat
ing and showing affection.
These problems, which they
initially thought were a result of
a personality clash, seemed less
significant when they realized
that their differences are cultur
al. "I don't think our behaviors
have even changed that much.
But just knowing 1 the differences
are cultural I helps," said Erick
son.
SSpARC asked the gay couple
to come because they wanted to
show that interracial relation
ships pervade all communities.
Another couple, junior Muffy

Davis and sophomore Chris
Esparza, demonstrated that
interracial dating also occurs in
the disabled community.
Esparza, who described him
self as Chicano, recalled going to
Davis's hometown — Sun Valley,
Idaho — and arriving at the air
port, "where everyone is white."
"I felt unique," he said.
Davis, who is in a wheelchair
due to an accident, said, "Sure I
noticed he's of a different race,
but I thought he was good-look
ing, nice, fun." She said she feels
proud of "our generation" for
being "more accepting."
Sophomore Mailee Ferguson
and 1993 graduate James Cleve
land are both half white. Fergu
son's mother is Chinese and

Cleveland's mother is African-
American. They represent not
only couples in interracial rela
tionships but also the children of
biracial marriages.
Cleveland said that since he's
grown up with mixed cultures,
the issue never came up "until I
came to Stanford because on this
campus there is a difference
between who is black and who is
white. There's a separation."
Since Cleveland is not of a
single ethnic group, he said he
tried hanging out in the black
community, but "I thought peo
ple were judging me because I
have lighter skin or I didn't act a
certain way." He emphasized
that "the only reason I feel
uncomfortable is because other

people are making me (eel that
wav. I know who I am. I like who
I am."
Ferguson said she also experi
enced that difficulty in identify
ing with a single ethnic group.
"My best friends ... in high
school were half-Indian or half
black. I don't feel white, but I
don't feel Asian."
Ferguson also discussed the
problem of not being a single eth
nicity from the perspective of a
parent. "My mom, I guess she
wants me to date an Asian guy
but she herself married a white
guy," she said.
Although being a biracial child
creates such difficulties, "being
half gives you a view of two
worlds," she added.
