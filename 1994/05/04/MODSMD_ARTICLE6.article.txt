# Night baseball?
## $250,000 lights may be installed at 60-year-old Sunken Diamond this summer 
### Romesh Ratnesar Editorial staff 
It didn't hold out as long as Wrigley
Field did, but Stanford's Sunken Dia
mond could well be the scene of night
baseball next season for the first time
in its history.
A proposal for installation of eight
standard lights at the 60-year-old field
is currently under examination by the
provost's office, according to Assoc.
Athletic Director Tom Beckett. Stan
ford is aiming to have the lights ready
for use by the beginning of the 1995
baseball campaign, Beckett said.
"If the question is 'Do we want Sta
nford to put lights into Sunken Dia

mond?' the answer is yes," he said. "We
are currently looking at all the compo
nents of this plan and how they can
come together."
Among the issues still to be deter
mined is the cost of the lights and the
price of installation. Kathy Wolff, assis
tant to head baseball coach Mark Mar
quess, estimated the cost of the lights
to be about $250,000.
Wolff said the baseball program has
received money for the lights from for
mer players and the Diamond Club, t he
team's booster organization. Beckett
confirmed that "there have been funds
that have been pledged to this project."
However, the department is still
"trying to identify all the potential

sources of funding," Beckett said. He
added t hat even when the project is fi
nalized, the University may have to
present the plan to Palo Alto city offi
cials.
"It would be our plan to get the
lights in by the start of the next colle
giate season," Beckett said. "Whether
that's a realistic goal is hard to say at
this point."
The lights will likely not be debuted
in a game until spring quarter of next
year, during which the team will play
some Tuesday and Friday games at
night, Wolff said.
Sunken Diamond's lights would be
equivalent to those certified for use in
professional Triple-A baseball, one

level below major league baseball, ac
cording to Marquess.
Beckett said the impetus for lighting
was Stanford's desire to host post-sea
son NCAA regional competition. In the
past, the NCAA named Stanford the
site of the regionals only when it cap
tured the Pacific 10 Southern Division
championship.
"The NCAA likes to have the region
als at a facility that has the capability to
have night baseball," Beckett said.
"Stanford would like to have lights so
that we would fall under that catego
ry." With lights, Stanford officials con
tend, the University could schedule
games at times more attractive to
the NCAA.
But pushing back first-pitch
times should also benefit the pro
gram during the regular season.
"It will help attendance so that

people who work or are in school
can still come to games," Wolff
said.
"Evening baseball would be
delightful to watch under the
lights," Beckett said. "People in
the evening might like to come
out on a Friday night and enjoy
college baseball on the Stanford
campus â€” it would be an abso
lutely beautiful experience for

those people."
Team members were generally
supportive of the possibility of
playing night games at home.
"It's really super," said sopho
more pitcher Dan Reed. "I'm
looking forward to playing before
more fans of Stanford baseball."
Of the other teams in Stan
ford's conference, only California
does not have a diamond with

lights. The opportunity to prac
tice and play under Sunken Dia
mond's lights could aid the Cardi
nal's performance on the road,
players said.
Sunken Diamond also will fea
ture a new scoreboard next sea
son. The facility has made numer
ous improvements to its press
box, clubhouse and practice areas
over the last 10 years.
