Sophomores studying topics ranging from the
treatment of Crimean Tartars in the former Soviet
Union to the social evolution of Brazilian dance were
recently named Chappell-Lougee Scholars for the
1993-94 academic year.
The scholarship fund, which awards 11 sopho
mores with up to $'2,500 each for research grants,
was established in 1989 in memory of Harold Chap
pell and in honor of his daughter. History Prof. Car
olyn Lougee, who served as dean of Undergraduate
Studies from 1982-87. When the dean's office
matched the original donation, the funding for re
search grants became possible.
The annual award targets sophomores because
Chappell and Lougee wished to provide younger stu
dents with a greater opportunity to research in the
humanities and social sciences, said Laura Selznick,
director of Undergraduate Research Opportunities.
Selznick advocates research for younger students
because "many have a personal connection to their
research." For example, Selznick cited scholar
Charisse Browne, who attended high school with the
daughter of an assassinated Liberian president.
When Browne took a college course relating to the
same subject, she was able to compare her book
learning with personal memories.
This year, a record number of sophomores applied
for the award. Selznick described each candidate as
"very qualified." Five of the 11 Scholars will contin
ue with their research projects outside of Stanford.
Scholar Sonia Giordani developed a project which
focuses on the Italian media system. She describes it
as "unique" because one man owns a majority of the
private media. This same man, owner of a soccer
team and a department store chain, was also recent
ly elected Italian prime minister. Giordani said she
intends to uncover the political implications of hav
ing one individual pervade all elements of Italian
consumer culture.
