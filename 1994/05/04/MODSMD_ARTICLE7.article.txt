## Students to research jazz, Italian media, colonization 
### Jennifer Rosen Staff writer 
Sophomores studying topics ranging from the
treatment of Crimean Tartars in the former Soviet
Union to the social evolution of Brazilian dance were
recently named Chappell-Lougee Scholars for the
1993-94 academic year.
The scholarship fund, which awards 11 sopho
mores with up to $'2,500 each for research grants,
was established in 1989 in memory of Harold Chap
pell and in honor of his daughter. History Prof. Car
olyn Lougee, who served as dean of Undergraduate
Studies from 1982-87. When the dean's office
matched the original donation, the funding for re
search grants became possible.
The annual award targets sophomores because
Chappell and Lougee wished to provide younger stu
dents with a greater opportunity to research in the
humanities and social sciences, said Laura Selznick,
director of Undergraduate Research Opportunities.
Selznick advocates research for younger students
because "many have a personal connection to their
research." For example, Selznick cited scholar
Charisse Browne, who attended high school with the
daughter of an assassinated Liberian president.
When Browne took a college course relating to the
same subject, she was able to compare her book
learning with personal memories.
This year, a record number of sophomores applied
for the award. Selznick described each candidate as
"very qualified." Five of the 11 Scholars will contin
ue with their research projects outside of Stanford.
Scholar Sonia Giordani developed a project which
focuses on the Italian media system. She describes it
as "unique" because one man owns a majority of the
private media. This same man, owner of a soccer
team and a department store chain, was also recent
ly elected Italian prime minister. Giordani said she
intends to uncover the political implications of hav
ing one individual pervade all elements of Italian
consumer culture.
She will study abroad next
year in Florence and hopes to con
sult her faculty sponsor, visiting
Prof. Louis Bosshart, at his home
institution in Switzerland.
Another scholar, Henry Epino,
said he wants to improve the
post-apartheid educational sys
tem in South Africa. His research
project consists in talking to
South African students and
determining what they would like
to see in their schools as opposed
to what exists.
"I've always been interested in
the country. I've taken every
class about South Africa, " he
said.
Other scholars include Adam
Barker, an international relations
major who will research Italian
debt reduction in Florence next
year, and Chitra Deshpande, a
history major who will compare
ethnic identity to national unity
in the former Soviet Union.
Derek Isaacowitz, a psychology
major, will investigate the social

selections of elderly individuals;
Kaira Lingo will study Brazilian
culture, gender a;;d race; Michelle
Scott, a history and African and
Afro-American Studies major will
analyze the jazz tune "How High
the Moon" and history major
Chloe Sladden will investigate the
impact of New Zealand coloniza
tion on race, gender and politics.
Additional scholars are Sophia
Stone-Whyte, an international
relations major who will study
the Jamaican music of Buju Ban
ton and Gabriela Teodorescu, a
history major who will conduct
research pertaining to Romania's
King Carol and Romanian foreign
policy.
Students in the humanities
and social sciences are nominated
as Chappell-Lougee Scholars by
themselves or by faculty mem
bers during fall quarter of their
sophomore year. To be eligible for
the scholarship, one must find a
faculty sponsor to write a letter of
recommendation.
Furthermore, each student
should have a "well thought out
academic project, a good academic
record, and a supportive faculty
sponsor," Selznick said.
