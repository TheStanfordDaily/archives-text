Three more days for ANC
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP)
â€” Nelson Mandela's African National
Congress must wait three extra days to
take power because ballot counting is hik
ing so long.
Even though the winner has claimed vic
tory and the losers have conceded, almost
half the votes remained to be counted in
South Africa's first all-race election.
The 400-member National Assembly,
the main chamber of the new Parliament,
will now meet in Cape Town on Monday
rather than Friday. Its first, and somewhat
urgent, task is to formally elect Mandela as
South Africa's first black president.
His inauguration is planned for the next
day, May 10, in Pretoria.
The date changes were announced yes
terday by the Transitional Executive Coun
cil, which has been overseeing the govern

ing of the country.
Navy to recruit more women
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Navy
must recruit more women and give them
more chances to serve on combat ships,
even on submarines, the service's new chief
said yesterday.
The Navy's image, scarred by the Tail
hook sex scandal, will improve "once every
body is recognized to be equal in the work
place," Adrn. Jeremy Boorda said.
Wonjen serve on 57 of the Navy's 406
ships, but Boorda said his goal is all ships.
"The goal is everything," he said.
The new chief of naval operations
announced his plans just 10 days after tak
ing command of a service afflicted by recent
reports of sexual harassment, lackluster
leadership and cheating at the U.S. Naval
Academy.
