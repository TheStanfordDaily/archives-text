## Professor sued for sex harrassment 
### Julie Makinen Senior staff writer 
A former research assistant has filed a lawsuit
against the University and Psychiatry Prof. Sey
mour Levine, accusing him of sexual harassment and
charging that Stanford's response — a letter of rep
rimand — was inadequate.
The suit, filed Monday in Santa Clara County Su
perior Court, alleges that Levine harassed 24-year
old Helen Bae over a period of nearly a year until she
quit last May. The suit claims Levine kissed and
hugged Bae against her will, repeatedly making sug
gestive comments and sexual advances.
Levine said he could not comment on the case and
only learned of it by reading yesterday's San Jose
Mercury News.
Assoc. General Counsel Iris Brest declined to com
ment for the University until she reads the suit,
which also names the Board of Trustees, University
President Gerhard Casper, Dean of the School of
Medicine David Korn and Robert Cutler, an associate
dean at the Medical School.
According to the suit, Levine "regularly ogled and
stared at [Bae'sl breasts and thighs in a provocative
manner" and made remarks such as "Mama Mia,"
"you have such a nice body" and "God, you look ex
otic today" to Bae, who is Asian-American.
Last February, the suit charges, Levine "leered"
at Bae in the presence of several co-workers and said,
"I'll do what Opus (Levine's dog) does." He then pro
ceeded to grab Bae against her will, lick her face and
slobber on her nose with his tongue, according to the
suit.
According to the suit, Bae
tried to stop the harassment by
wearing baggy clothing to dis
guise her appearance. Levine,
the suit says, responded by
pointing to Bae's buttocks and
saying, "What are you hiding in
there?" and "I'm used to you
looking so good that like this you
look ordinary and drab — you've
spoiled me, Helen."
Bae was repeatedly discour
aged from filing a complaint, the
suit says. After receiving a hos
tile telephone call from Levine
last May 5, Bae came to her
office, gathered her belongings
and never returned to work, the
suit says.
The next day, she filed a for
mal complaint with Cutler, who
told her a committee would be
formed to investigate but that
she could not know the specifics
of the investigation, according to
the suit.
The committee found Levine
guilty of sexual harassment, but
Casper found him guilty of "pro
fessional misconduct" and decid
ed the only necessary remedial
action was a letter of censure for
Levine's personnel file and an
occasional visit from a monitor,
according to documents submit
ted to the court.
No restitution was ever made to
Bae, according to the suit, which
also reports that Bae was discour
aged from reporting the harass
ment by a co-worker who told her
Levine and Casper were friends.
"I'd like to know how we get
from a determination of sexual
harassment to the determina
tion (of professional misconduct)
by the president," said Bae's
lawyer, Jennifer Drobac.
Casper referred all questions
to the University's legal staff,

who declined to comment.
Last fall, Bae raised concerns
that the investigative committee
might have been ineffective
because it was comprised only of
faculty members who may have
been biased in Levine's favor.
But Casper, in a Feb. 4, 1994,
letter to Bae, said, "I am afraid
that no procedure is infallible
under these difficult circum
stances. . . . After considerable
thought, I have concluded that
this mechanism had the best
chance of success. Indeed, I have
some hopes that the very exis
tence of the committee will have
a good effect."
In addition to the recent inci-

dents, Bae's suit alleges that
Levine displayed inappropriate
behavior in 1977 toward at least
four female research assistants
working at the Stanford Outdoor
Primate Facility. Then-Vice
Provost and Dean of Research
Gerald Lieberman told Levine
that if he sexually harassed
women working with him again,
the University would ask him to
resign, the suit says.
Thus, Stanford was aware of
Levine's behavior but failed to
take corrective action to prevent
future incidents, the suit
asserts.
Bae — who recently found
another temporary research job
at Stanford — is seeking back
pay, additional damages and an
apology from each defendant.
"It's clear that Helen Bae will
never be made whole again,"
said Drobac. "She's seeking
some restitution and an apology

... to at least help her in part
recover from the trauma that
has occurred."
Drobac said she does not
know when the case will come
before a judge, adding that the
discovery process may be
lengthy. It has been difficult to
mount a case because Stanford
policies in place at the time of
the alleged harassment make it
hard to obtain pertinent docu
ments, she said.
Bae's action is just the latest in
a series of sexual harassment
accusations involving Medical
School faculty. In 1991, Dr.
Frances Conley's charge of sexism
against Neurosurgery Prof. Ger-

'lf s clear that Helen Bae will never be made
whole again. She's seeking some restitution
and an apology.'

aid Silverberg brought national
media attention to the school.
That same year, two students
accused Prof. Mark Perlroth, a
cardiologist, of harassment. He
was disciplined in 1992, but the
details were kept confidential.
Last year, a Medical Center
administrative assistant filed
suit against Opthalmology Prof.
Richard Sogg, charging him with
sexual harassment and claiming
that the University did not take
appropriate steps to prevent it.
Levine, who has worked at
Stanford since 1962, has been in
the news before — not for sexual
harassment but as the target of
animal rights activists, who have
attacked him for his experiments
with squirrel monkeys. Last May,
50 people from In Defense of Ani
mals held a rally in Palo Alto to
denounce his research on stress
and mother-child relationships in
monkeys as "cruel and worthless."
