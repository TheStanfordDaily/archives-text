## Professor sued for sex harrassment 
### Julie Makinen Senior staff writer 
A former research assistant has filed a lawsuit
against the University and Psychiatry Prof. Sey
mour Levine, accusing him of sexual harassment and
charging that Stanford's response — a letter of rep
rimand — was inadequate.
The suit, filed Monday in Santa Clara County Su
perior Court, alleges that Levine harassed 24-year
old Helen Bae over a period of nearly a year until she
quit last May. The suit claims Levine kissed and
hugged Bae against her will, repeatedly making sug
gestive comments and sexual advances.
Levine said he could not comment on the case and
only learned of it by reading yesterday's San Jose
Mercury News.
Assoc. General Counsel Iris Brest declined to com
ment for the University until she reads the suit,
which also names the Board of Trustees, University
President Gerhard Casper, Dean of the School of
Medicine David Korn and Robert Cutler, an associate
dean at the Medical School.
According to the suit, Levine "regularly ogled and
stared at [Bae'sl breasts and thighs in a provocative
manner" and made remarks such as "Mama Mia,"
"you have such a nice body" and "God, you look ex
otic today" to Bae, who is Asian-American.
Last February, the suit charges, Levine "leered"
at Bae in the presence of several co-workers and said,
"I'll do what Opus (Levine's dog) does." He then pro
ceeded to grab Bae against her will, lick her face and
slobber on her nose with his tongue, according to the
suit.
