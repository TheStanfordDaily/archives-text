# Palestinians celebrate self-rule pact
## PLO police move into Gaza, Jericho as Rabin signs long-awaited agreement 
### 
GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) — Palestini
ans stepped into a new era of self-rule in
Gaza and Jericho yesterday after 27 years of
Israeli occupation, cheering the arrival of
PLO police commanders and the release of
Palestinian prisoners.
The signing of the Palestinian self-rule
agreement after months of torturous negoti
ations left important issues unresolved and
the changeover was expected to be rocky. But
the prospect of autonomy and an eventual
Palestinian state produced remarkable dis
plays of goodwill in areas torn by six years of
violence.
Newly freed Palestinian prisoners posed
for pictures and shook hands with Israeli sol
diers, and some people released doves. Chil
dren in the West Bank town of Jericho show
ered an Israeli police car with flowers.
Israeli soldiers shouted "shalom" at pass
ing Palestinian cars.
"This is the beginning of the changes we
will see on the ground soon. It's the begin
ning of the translation of the historic agree
ment," said Col. Maher Fara, a spokesman
for the Palestinian police force that will
patrol the autonomous zones in the Gaza
Strip and around Jericho.
Despite the formal signing ceremony in
Cairo, Egypt, three main issues remained
unresolved: the release of non-PLO Pales
tinian prisoners from Israeli jails, the size of
the Jericho area, and Palestinian demands to
have at least a symbolic police presence at
border crossings.
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and
PLO leader Yasser Arafat, bartering even as
the ceremony unfolded, signed the 200-page
document that emerged from nearly seven
months of talks repeatedly interrupted by

violence and temporary deadlocks. An outline
of autonomy was signed Sept. 13 in Washing
ton, but this document filled in the details.
The signing itself was disrupted when
Arafat momentarily walked away in a last
minute dispute over a map. It produced an
extraordinary scene as President Hosni
Mubarak of Egypt, Secretary of State Warren
Christopher and others negotiated with
Arafat on stage as speeches continued.
Palestinians are just beginning to organize
the administrative departments needed to
assume control.
Brig. Gen. Ghazi Al-Jabali, leader of the
advance group of 19 police commanders who
arrived yesterday from Egypt, toured mili
tary camps that Israel will turn over in Gaza
City, Khan Yunis and Rafah.
"We are bringing love, optimism and hope
to the people of Gaza and Jericho," al-Jabali
said, but he indicated changes would take
time.
He told reporters the initial force of 1,500
Palestinian police officers would arrive in a
week with uniforms and arms and not today
as previously reported.
Al-Jabali also said the nightly curfew, one
of the most hated aspects of Israel's occupa
tion, would not be lifted immediately. "We
are not in control yet," he said.
Three of the police commanders traveled
in Israeli military jeeps to Jericho, expected
to be the government center for Palestinian
self-rule. The phased transfer of authority is
largely hinged on the arrival of 7,000 police
men from outside and training 2,000 locally.
Rabin said at a news conference in Cairo
that Arafat had asked for up to four weeks
for the transfer rather than the three set in
the autonomy agreement.

The PLO's senior negotiator, Nabil
Shaath, said Arafat probably would not
arrive in the autonomous areas until early
June, when the new administration was in
place.
Palestinians, still doubtful about the
degree of control Israel will have over their
lives, did not make the signing ceremony a
holiday.
Palestinians consider the agreement the
first step toward an independent state, some
thing Israel has said it would resist. Israel
seized the West Bank and Gaza Strip in the
1967 Middle East War.
The effects of the signing were immediate
ly visible in Gaza with the start of the 11 a.m.
ceremony in Cairo.
At the Rafah crossing in southern Gaza,
Palestinian officials and Israeli officers
watched television together as they waited
for the Palestinian police commanders.
An hour after the signing, the first of 600
Palestinian prisoners, including four belong
ing to factions opposed to the PLO-Israel
accord, got off buses on the outskirts of Gaza
City to the ululations of welcoming relatives.
The four, two of them members of the mil
itant Islamic group Hamas that has vowed to
continue attacking Israelis, had to sign a
statement condemning violence and terror.
As part of the PLO-Israel agreement,
Israel is to free 5,000 Palestinian inmates
over the next three weeks — about half those
held in Israeli jails.
Israel also allowed 14 Palestinian depor
tees and 10 dependents to enter Israel yester
day, bringing to about 150 the number
allowed back since negotiations started. Most
were members of Arafat's Fatah faction
expected to take on administrative roles.

Palestinians consider the agreement the
first step toward an independent state, some
thing Israel has said it would resist. Israel
seized the West Bank and Gaza Strip in the
1967 Middle East War.
The effects of the signing were immediate
ly visible in Gaza with the start of the 11 a.m.
ceremony in Cairo.
At the Rafah crossing in southern Gaza,
Palestinian officials and Israeli officers
watched television together as they waited
for the Palestinian police commanders.
An hour after the signing, the first of 600
Palestinian prisoners, including four belong
ing to factions opposed to the PLO-Israel
accord, got off buses on the outskirts of Gaza
City to the ululations of welcoming relatives.
The four, two of them members of the mil
itant Islamic group Hamas that has vowed to
continue attacking Israelis, had to sign a
statement condemning violence and terror.
As part of the PLO-Israel agreement,
Israel is to free 5,000 Palestinian inmates
over the next three weeks — about half those
held in Israeli jails.
Israel also allowed 14 Palestinian depor
tees and 10 dependents to enter Israel yester
day, bringing to about 150 the number
allowed back since negotiations started. Most
were members of Arafat's Fatah faction
expected to take on administrative roles.
