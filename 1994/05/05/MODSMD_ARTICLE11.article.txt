SARAJEVO, Bosnia-llerzegovina
(AP) â€” Officials suspended aid flights to
Sarajevo yesterday after two planes were
hit by gunfire, and U.N. troops reported
new signs that Serbs were violating the
heavy-weapons exclusion zone around
the capital.
A German plane carrying U.N. aid
supplies and Germany's new ambassador
to Bosnia, Johannes Preisinger, was hit
by five bullets at the Sarajevo airport, and
an Ilyushin-76 plane, flying for the Amer
ican Soros foundation, was hit once by

small arms fire soon afterward, said Kris
Janowski, a spokesman for a U.N. relief
agency.
The planes were not seriously dam
aged and no injuries were reported. It was
not clear who fired the shots, nor was it
certain whether the airport would reopen
today.
A two-month truce in Sarajevo has
largely held between Bosnian Serbs
around the city and troops of Bosnia's
Muslim-led government. But U.N. offi
cials have noted a recent increase in vio

lations of a U.N. ultimatum that ordered
Serbs to keep tanks and artillery at least
12.4 miles from the city center.
U.N. spokesman Maj. Dacre Holloway
said officials were investigating two deto
nations believed to be tank fire in Saraje
vo yesterday afternoon. Tank fire would
be a violation of the NATO ultimatum.
Cmdr. Eric Chaperon, another U.N.
spokesman, said late last night that two
Serb T34 tanks on low-bed carriers
moved across the exclusion zone to Trno
vo outside the zone.
