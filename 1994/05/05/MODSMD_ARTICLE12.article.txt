SINGAPORE (AP) — An American

dalism could get rich if he or his family
accepted some of the offers pouring in for
movies, story rights and television appear
ances.
Michael Fay's divorced parents say
they have both been approached by pub
licity agents but have not yet accepted
any offers or hired agents themselves.

Fay, an 18-year-old high school senior,
is currently in jail awaiting four searingly
painful strokes of a rattan cane for spray
painting cars and other acts of vandalism.
One American publicity agent claimed
that photographs or film of Fay's lashed

Fay's original sentence of six lashes was
reduced yesterday by the Singapore govern
ment, in deference to President Clinton's
interest in the case and relations between
the two countries.
