## Bureaucratic traffic

THE EXTENSION of Sand
Hill Road to El Camino Real
— a proposal which has pit
ted Stanford against local commu
nities since the 1930s — took a big
step closer to reality last week.
On Thursday night, Stanford
planning officials presented the lat
est revision of the University's
grand plan to extend the thorough
fare, expand the Stanford Shopping
Center and construct "senior and
multi-family housing" in an unde
veloped area west of Sand Hill.
Stanford officials and surround
ing communities have quibbled over
details for years, prolonging a pro
ject that should create jobs and alle
viate traffic between areas near El
Camino and Interstate 280.
Enough stalling. The University
and local communities should move
quickly to push through the project,
which has had a large amount of
community participation.
Most points of opposition appear
to have been resolved. Planners

have promised to keep development
a minimum of 50 feet away from
San Francisquito Creek, which
some worried might be environmen
tally damaged by construction.
University officials have also
addressed concerns about increased
traffic from the development by
proposing an extension of Quarry
Road to El Camino. Last week, a
transportation specialist involved in
the project said that traffic models
predicted that any future traffic
increase would be caused by general
growth in the Bay Area, not the
development project.
Two years ago, a Stanford admin
istrator called the extension of Sand
Hill a "win-win situation" because
everyone — the city of Palo Alto,
local residents and the University —
would benefit from increased tax
revenues and convenience.
Now that the major concerns
have been ironed out, Stanford and
the surrounding area should move
forward as quickly as possible.
