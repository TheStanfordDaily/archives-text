# After words, action

IT'S A CATCH-22 that the Uni
versity never seems to escape: in
order to attract more minority
Ph.D. candidates, you need more
minority faculty. To attract more
minority faculty members, you need
to show a commitment to minority
recruitment. How do you do that?
By pointing to hefty minority Ph.D.
candidate numbers, what else?
According to a draft of a Univer
sity report on minority graduate
students given to the provost last
week, Stanford just doesn't have
any numbers to point to.
The Provost's Committee on the
Recruitment, Retention and Gradu
ation of Minority Graduate Stu
dents noted the obvious: the Uni
versity has failed to reach its 1989
goal of doubling the number of
minority students within five years.
The report recommends a number
of ways to make up for that failure,
including augmenting recruiting
staff and creating a more hospitable
environment for minority graduate

students.
However, Stanford has been
more efficient so far at making "rec
ommendations" than taking action.
The new report "echoes" the annual
report of the Faculty Senate's Com
mittee on Graduate Studies
released in November. When one
report begins to say the same things
as another report, it's time to put all
the reports in a pile and get to work.
University officials maintain that
it is extremely difficult to recruit top
minority faculty because the small
and finite group of job-seekers are
courted by other elite schools such
as Harvard, Princeton or Yale. But
tough competition is no excuse for
losing.
The University must act quickly
to put some teeth into the report's
44 pages of analysis and recommen
dations, hopefully implementing
some of the new ideas by next year.
Only then will Stanford stop
playing with paper tigers and
address the heart of the problem.
