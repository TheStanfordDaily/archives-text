## Cardinal love is no red rose 
### 
IT'S SPRINGTIME, and love (sniff,
sniff) is in the air. The days are warm,
the weeks short and the activities plen
ty. It's basically paradise. Well, except for
the love part.
No, this is not going to be another one of
those dating at Stanford columns. It
couldn't be — I would have drowned in my
own vomit trying to write it. Rather, it is a
brief discourse into the beauty of home
spun amore.
My Dad always said "college is like hav
ing a selections committee sift through all
the women of the world, leaving you with
the best of the bunch." And I think he was
darn-tootin' right.
Now some of you might argue that the
potential mates at Stanford are no more
appealing than the Tequila shooting co-ed
two bar stools down, but wait. Just think
of all the shared memories fellow Stanford
grads can share for a lifetime. Just think
of how nice it will be not having to explain
what "I went to the Co Ho with my pro
fro-ho from Flo Mo and got some fro yo at
the Co Po" means over and over again.
Just think of the prospect of holding intel
ligent conversations on topics other than
fuel-injected engines for the rest of your
days.
But despite all the potential here on the
Farm, love just isn't for sale. People may
be stripped to their skivvies on Branner
lawn toasting themselves to a golden, skin
cancer bronze, but they're not out there
holding hands. Now I'm not the world's

biggest PDA fan, but I do think that there
could be a little more friendliness out
there.
These days love, traditionally a positive
concept associated with desire, happiness
and kindness, is seen as a curse. It's either
emotionalized into a source of teenage
angst or intellectualized into a time-con
suming dynamic that is at best good nook
ie and at worst a career/graduate school
conflict. Where's the romance in a "lover"
who has become a "significant other?"
Every year it happens, and every year
it's the same.
Autumn quarter: love is cool, huh-huh.
I think I'm gonna find me some.
Winter quarter: classes suck. The
weather sucks. Love sucks.
Spring quarter: love is cool, huh-huh. I
think I'm gonna find me some ... now
where are i.hose Pro Fros?
That's right, we're all out there looking
for that spring quarter love quick-fix, but
when it comes along we dread and fear all
the complications relationships bring.
My roommates, for instance, often sit
around and talk about asking women out.
They've been performing the same week
end ritual for months, but are always wor
ried that "it's too late in the year to start a
relationship," or that "I was hanging out
with her so much trying to ask her out that
we became friends — and now, well, we're
friends."
When asked why they don't just pick up
the phone and dial up some love, their

reactions are terribly typical. So typical, in
fact, that they am be categorized into sub
species of the family Lovus Lostus.
• Eric (cognitiuus dissidensus): "Ask
someone out? You don't do that anymore,
dating just sort of happens."
• Ben (cowardus biggus): "I was going
to ask this woman on a date, but before I
got up the nerve she asked me out."
• Cory (bitterus mostus): "Love sucks. It
just cost me $8 a minute to get dumped by
my woman in Moscow."
• N'Gai (beeperus carrierus): "I asked a
woman out once, but she seemed offended
when it took me two weeks to return her
ca11... some people."
Some days I think the only Stanford off
spring will come from the California Cry
obank. I mean, let's be reasonable, if
you're willing to do that sort of thing in
front of a totally impersonal TV screen into
a cup for some total stranger you might as
well do it with a friend.
So express yourself, for where there lies
expression there lies love. Run to love, not
away from it. Because if you ain't got love,
what have ya' got?

OK, so this was sort of a dating at Stanford
column. Send all complaints/date requests
