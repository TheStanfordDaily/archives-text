## Reaction to 'No Grapes' was insensitive, not racist 
### 
I believe the 34 students who were
the authors of Tuesday's letter
("Responses to video on grape boy
cott showed intolerance of campus")
are understandably dismayed at the
student response to the showing of
the video at Sunday's Flicks. To have
a worthy cause yet to attract insuffi
cient support for it, to organize activi
ties that few people attend, and worse,
to have to receive jibes and taunting
at their efforts, is a most frustrating
experience.
The students' response to the video
definitely shows a good deal of insen
sitivity, and was highly inappropriate
and disrespectful. However, I wonder
how appropriate it is for the authors
to use overarching labels such as
racism, intolerance and hatred on the
students.
These are serious charges that
shouldn't be employed lightly. Are
there alternatives to racism and intol
erance that could have explained the
students' behavior?
Could it be that timing has some
thing to do with it? The truth is, peo

ple who went to Flicks in order to see
a comedy such as "Mrs. Doubtfire"
probably did not expect or even want
to be confronted with a short that
dealt with such a serious and
depressing issue as that of agricul
ture, the use of pesticides and fetal
deformity. Stanford students can be
an irreverent group, as exemplified
by our uniquely irreverent Stanford
Band.
I suspect had the short been about
a different ethnic group, be it Cau
casian or Asian, it would probably
have been greeted with the same reac
tion.
Furthermore, the whole atmo
sphere at Flicks is really not very con
ducive to any serious topics. The truth
is, in general, films that are funny or
consist of a lot of action often work a
lot better than films that concern
itself with a serious topic. With all the
paper-throwing before the film, it's
hard to expect otherwise.
It's very hard, under the circum
stances, for the organizers' good
intentions to be realized. It is hard to

find an alternative venue that has as
wide a reach as Flicks for purposes of
showing such shorts, but it certainly
does have certain constraints in terms
of the types of topics and the presen
tation that could be effective.
As for the students' response, it
certainly showed a good deal of insen
sitivity, both to the organizers' efforts
and to the plight of some of the work
ers on the fields. The organizers' frus
tration is understandable.
However, I don't think it's appro
priate to go so far as to say it's a sign
of hate. Ignorance, maybe. Apathy,
definitely. Intolerance, one can argue
that the right of the organizers to
express their feelings and inform the
public hasn't been respected. Racism
and hatred, I doubt it.
I think it is a problem of our times
that we're faced with an apathetic
population. This is not an activist
campus, but rather a pre-professional
one. People are a lot more concerned
with their grades and applying to law
school or medical school. You can't
blame them.

There is a significant portion of the
population that feels totally disillu
sioned by the political process. Dis
trust of the government and the legis
lature is at a high. I see the apathy on
campus, both in terms of the ASSU
elections and incidents like this, both
as a reflection of the attitude of our
generation, as well as a sign of things
to come.
One might argue that young people
should have their ideals, and should
attempt to push society forward. But I
don't believe we should have any illu
sions either.
I think it's admirable the authors
of Tuesday's letter found something
that they believed in and followed
through on.
Unfortunately, we all have to work
within the limits of our time and
environment. All I can say is, don't
jump to conclusions, expect the worst,
and do the best you can. Only then
can you best serve your hopes and
dreams.
