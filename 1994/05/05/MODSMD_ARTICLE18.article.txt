# Faculty members ask for care for protesters, support their demands
## 
### 
The following is a copy of a letter sub
mitted yesterday to University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper and Provost Con
doleezza Rice.
The University central administra
tion has declared its commitment to
strengthening Stanford's excellence in
diversity of race and gender.
Yet the effects of a number of deci
sions this year, most recently the
untimely dismissal of Cecilia Burciaga,
have created a climate of indifference,

even hostility to diversity at Stanford.
We share the deep frustration of the
students on a hunger strike in the
Quad and join them in demanding:
1. A total ban on the purchase of
grapes at the University. The use of
grapes by the University has long been
a source of conflict and aggravation
among Chicanos/as on campus.
2. The creation of a Chicano/Chicana
Studies Program, with sufficient incre
mental faculty billets and administra
tive support to make such a program
viable.
3. The establishment of a committee
of representatives of East Palo Alto,
Stanford students and Stanford admin
istrators to develop a community center
in East Palo Alto.
We request that the University

Health Service monitor, on a daily
basis, the students' physical condition
on site. This would minimally include
monitoring of hydration status, blood
pressure and other vital signs, with
appropriate laboratory analysis as nec
essary. The responsibility of students
physical well being in the face of poten
tial medical deterioration belongs to
the Student Health Service.
