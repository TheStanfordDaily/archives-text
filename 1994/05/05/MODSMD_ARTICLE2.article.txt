# Dream on?
## Plans to build plaza bridging Stanford, Palo Alto progress 
### Marc Lee 
On the map, University Avenue, Alma Street and
El Camino Real appear to be simple, crisscrossing
lines. But anyone who has driven or walked through
this junction between Stanford and Palo Alto knows
it to be a nightmarish web of on-ramps and off-ramps,
overpasses and underpasses.
That is, until the Dream Team gets its way. This
collection of three architectural firms, city employ
ees, University staff and a citizens' advisory group
have proposed a plan which may finally redesign the
area.
Under their proposed plan, University Avenue
would wrap around a public garden between El
Camino and Alma, and the CalTrain tracks would be
hoisted over the garden.
The project, which has been ongoing since 1992,
moved one step closer to fruition when the Palo Alto
City Council recently approved a $5,000 fee to hire a
public-funding specialist. He or she will investigate
possible financing sources for the $28 million project.
About $300,000 will be needed to make a detailed
feasibility study with more specific cost estimates,
said Peter Walker, the San Francisco landscape ar
chitect whose firm has been instrumental in the lat
est phase of progress. As for the $28 million, the
Dream Team hopes to apply for state and federal
funding, especially under the Inter-modal Surface
Transportation Efficiency Act.
"There are a lot of projects
competing for these public funds.
That's a major obstacle," said
Carter. "Some could consider it a
cosmetic project."
The goals of the project
include creating "visual open
ness" and fostering "multi
modal" transportation, Walker
said.
Initially, the team wanted to
have the tracks go underground
but later decided that it would
not be feasible. A traffic circle
would orchestrate vehicles on the
El Camino overpass joining the
University and downtown.
"The key is to get enough light
and air down there" and to
"move everything from under
ground so that it's above
ground," said Walker. The real
estate hasn't been "getting the
best uses," he said. "It was con
sidered to be the back of a uni
versity and the back of a city; it's
really the center."
The new arrangement would
make it easier for people to walk
downtown and would also reduce
the "pattern of searching and
parking" that hassle people as

they move among the campus,
shopping center and downtown
areas, said Walker.
In addition to increased pedes
trian activity, the multi-modal
system would encourage the use
of bicycles, trains and buses in an
attempt to get people out of "sin
gle-occupant vehicles" in the
"tangle of structures, tunnels
and bridges," said Charles
Carter, a campus planner. "The
idea of multi-modal transport
bodes well."
Even more than improved
traffic, the rearrangement of
cement and pavement will "cre
ate something that will be used
at a lot of levels," Walker said,
explaining the increased social,
cultural and academic exchange
that will take place at the
improved crossroads.
"Traffic isn't the only focus."
Unlike plans for a Sand Hill
Road extension, which have
sparked opposition from Palo
Alto officials, this project has
received support from both the
city and the University. "Every
one talks about town and gown,
but the interests have been simi
lar," said Walker.
Carter agreed. "Although
Stanford owns a great deal of the
land, it's in the city of Palo Alto,"
he said. "We've been able to work
cooperatively."
