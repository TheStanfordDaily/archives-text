# Dream on?
## Plans to build plaza bridging Stanford, Palo Alto progress 
### Marc Lee 
On the map, University Avenue, Alma Street and
El Camino Real appear to be simple, crisscrossing
lines. But anyone who has driven or walked through
this junction between Stanford and Palo Alto knows
it to be a nightmarish web of on-ramps and off-ramps,
overpasses and underpasses.
That is, until the Dream Team gets its way. This
collection of three architectural firms, city employ
ees, University staff and a citizens' advisory group
have proposed a plan which may finally redesign the
area.
Under their proposed plan, University Avenue
would wrap around a public garden between El
Camino and Alma, and the CalTrain tracks would be
hoisted over the garden.
The project, which has been ongoing since 1992,
moved one step closer to fruition when the Palo Alto
City Council recently approved a $5,000 fee to hire a
public-funding specialist. He or she will investigate
possible financing sources for the $28 million project.
About $300,000 will be needed to make a detailed
feasibility study with more specific cost estimates,
said Peter Walker, the San Francisco landscape ar
chitect whose firm has been instrumental in the lat
est phase of progress. As for the $28 million, the
Dream Team hopes to apply for state and federal
funding, especially under the Inter-modal Surface
Transportation Efficiency Act.
