## Golfers take Pac-10 title 
### Andrew Blachman Staff writer 
The Stanford men's golf team, after catapult
ing from third to first place with a four-under
par third round Tuesday, held on to capture the
56th annual Pacific 10 Conference Champi
onships yesterday at the National Golf Course in
Tucson, Ariz.
Stanford, which trailed Oregon State by six
strokes half-way through the tournament, came
out on fire on Tuesday, shooting the only round
below par of the tournament. That third round
score of 356 — seven strokes better than any
other round — put the No. 3 Cardinal up by eight
strokes going into yesterday's final round.
"We had a meeting and we knew we had to do
well in round three," coach Wally Goodwin said.
"We did and then we fought off Arizona. I'm real
ly proud of that."
After the tournament, Goodwin, who led
Stanford to a school record five tournament titles
in 1993-1994, was named Pac-10 Conference
Coach of the Year. This was the second time he
has earned the honor in his seven years as Stan
ford's coach.
"I'm really honored," said Goodwin, "but the
coach doesn't win the award, the guys win it for
the coach, and I really appreciate it."
The win gave the third-ranked Cardinal its
second conference title in three years and
marked its final competition before the NCAA
Regionals May 19-21.
Stanford, with a team score of 1,459, held off
defending champ Arizona by three strokes on
the No. 11 Wildcats' home course. The second
ranked Arizona State Sun Devils finished third
with a four-round score of 1,473. Unranked
Oregon State, which surprised many with the
lead half-way through, faltered in the third
round and finished fourth.
Arizona's Jason Gore won the individual title
in a sudden-death playoff with Oregon State's
Birk Nelson and Arizona State's Chris Stutts. All
three golfers finished the 72-hole tournament at
one under-par 287.
Gore, a sophomore, now owns
two conference titles, having won
in a playoff last year as well.
Junior William Yanigisawa led
Stanford with a fourth place fin
ish in one of the tightest tourna
ments in memory, where only
seven strokes separated first place
from 20th. Junior Steve Burdick,
who finished one stroke shy of
Yanigisawa, came in seventh.
"Nobody stood out, but we
played really well as a team, and
that's what we needed to do,"
Yanigisawa said.
Two other juniors, Notah
Begay 111 and Casey Martin, fin
ished ninth and 11th, respectively.
Senior Brad Lanning rounded out
the Cardinal's championship per
formance with a score of 294, good
enough for 15th place overall.
The Pac-10 Championship for
mat, which counts the top five
individual scores as opposed to
the normal four, favored teams
such as Stanford.
"We're a very deep team," said
Goodwin. "When you have that

extra golfer it helps us a lot and
hurts some of the teams with less
depth. There's really no other vis
ible difference among the top
teams."
The NCAA Regionals and
Championships, however, will
have a traditional format, where
five golfers compete and the top
four scores count in the stand
ings.
Defending NCAA champ Todd
Demsey, who won the U.S. Inter
collegiate tournament at Stanford
a week ago, finished in a tie with
Begay in ninth place. Afterward,
the Arizona State star was named
Pac-10 Player of the Year.
Scores were unusually high on
the difficult 7,055 yard, par 72
Tucson National Golf Course, the
sight of the NCAA West Regionals
as well. Only the top three indi
viduals finished below par and
Stanford's winning team score of
1,459 was 19 strokes above par.
In a vote of the league's coach
es after the tournament, four
Stanford golfers were selected to
the All-Pac-10 team. Begay and
Martin both earned first team
honors while Burdick and Yanigi
sawa were named to the second
team.
