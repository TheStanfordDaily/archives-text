## Golfers take Pac-10 title 
### Andrew Blachman Staff writer 
The Stanford men's golf team, after catapult
ing from third to first place with a four-under
par third round Tuesday, held on to capture the
56th annual Pacific 10 Conference Champi
onships yesterday at the National Golf Course in
Tucson, Ariz.
Stanford, which trailed Oregon State by six
strokes half-way through the tournament, came
out on fire on Tuesday, shooting the only round
below par of the tournament. That third round
score of 356 — seven strokes better than any
other round — put the No. 3 Cardinal up by eight
strokes going into yesterday's final round.
"We had a meeting and we knew we had to do
well in round three," coach Wally Goodwin said.
"We did and then we fought off Arizona. I'm real
ly proud of that."
After the tournament, Goodwin, who led
Stanford to a school record five tournament titles
in 1993-1994, was named Pac-10 Conference
Coach of the Year. This was the second time he
has earned the honor in his seven years as Stan
ford's coach.
"I'm really honored," said Goodwin, "but the
coach doesn't win the award, the guys win it for
the coach, and I really appreciate it."
The win gave the third-ranked Cardinal its
second conference title in three years and
marked its final competition before the NCAA
Regionals May 19-21.
Stanford, with a team score of 1,459, held off
defending champ Arizona by three strokes on
the No. 11 Wildcats' home course. The second
ranked Arizona State Sun Devils finished third
with a four-round score of 1,473. Unranked
Oregon State, which surprised many with the
lead half-way through, faltered in the third
round and finished fourth.
Arizona's Jason Gore won the individual title
in a sudden-death playoff with Oregon State's
Birk Nelson and Arizona State's Chris Stutts. All
three golfers finished the 72-hole tournament at
one under-par 287.
