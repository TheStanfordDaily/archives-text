# 'Physical down in the trenches'
## Spring football full of promise 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
In order for the Stanford football
team to return to its winning ways in
1994, it needs improvement in the
defense. Judging by the end of spring
practice, the Cardinal is well on its way.
"We had a good spring defensively,"
said Stanford head coach Bill Walsh. "We
play a lot more intensely now. Our guys
are more poised and have a good com
mand of what they're doing."
In comparison to hist year, that cer
tainly is progress. A year ago, the Cardi
nal ranked last in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence in every major defensive category.
In the annual Cardinal/White scrim
mage played last Saturday, the defense
held its own against the potent Stanford
passing offense, as it took the offense 44
plays to score a touchdown. Walsh said if
the defense can compete with the Cardi
nal offense — one of the nation's best —
that bodes well for the future.
"Last spring, our offense could have
scored on every play," Walsh said.
In particular, Walsh praised nose
tackle Jason Eisk, inside linebacker Nate
Olsen, outside linebacker Brian Batson,
defensive back Leroy Pruitt, and inside

linebacker Justin Morabito for their
play.
But Walsh recognized that the fate of
the secondary will again depend on
youth. Eliel Swinton, the Cardinal's top
safety, will likely be moved to corner
back, leaving the safety position in the
likely hands of incoming freshmen Chris
Draft, Kailee Wong and Kadar Hamilton.
Aside from a 52-yard gain by running
back Quincy Jacobs off a screen pass
from quarterback Steve Stenstrom, big
plays were noticeably absent from this
year's scrimmage.
Absent too were Stanford's first
string running backs. Tailback Ethan
Allen and fullback Greg Cornelia sat out
the festivities due to minor injuries.
Backup Mike Mitchell also watched from
the sidelines because of a pinched nerve.
But Jacobs made the most of his
chance, carrying the ball 16 times for 22
yards and two touchdowns, while also
catching three passes for 60 yards receiv
ing. He noted that the offensive line was
doing a better job of run blocking.
"They're getting more physical down
in the trenches," Jacobs said. "It will
help give us more of an even attack."
Saturday's scrimmage also showcased
the Cardinal's depth at quarterback.

Starter Steve Stenstrom completed 8 of
11 passes for 123 yards before yielding to
the reserves. Mark Butterfield, Scott
Frost and Tim Carey then each took
turns at the helm.
But throughout the spring, Sten
strom focused on other aspects of his
game besides passing, working on his
quickness and lateral movement. In con
trast to the past two seasons, when Sten
strom would usually drop back and
remain stationary in the pocket, he's
working on his mobility.
"I've started to get a feel for moving
out of the pocket and playing that type of
game," Stenstrom said. "In the past I
would keep looking for a receiver. Now,
I'd like to be able to scramble, to tuck it
down and run. It would add another
dimension to our offense and make
defenses think."
Receiver Justin Armour, whose 1993
season was cut short by injury, appeared
to be in midseason form, catching three
passes for 77 yards. Walsh was pleased
that spring practice did not result in any
new hospital visits for his squad.
"This was a good spring," he said. "No
serious injuries."
But there was some serious work that
should pay off in September.
