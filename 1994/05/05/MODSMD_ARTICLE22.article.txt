# Softball ends with doubleheader split
## Marengo's home run, Webb's five-hit complete game highlight win 
### Randy Reback Staff writer 
Out with the old and in with the new.
On Tuesday, the Stanford Softball
team reverted to bad habits before break
ing out with an improved and promising
level of play. The Cardinal (5-30) ended
its season by splitting a doubleheader
against the Santa Clara Broncos.
For the Cardinal, the opener was a
painful reminder of its erratic early-sea
son play. Errors appeared to be conta
gious to the Cardinal infield, which com
mitted a total of six miscues during the
game. Stanford's mistakes added up to
big innings for the Broncos, who scored
three runs in the first inning and five in
the fifth.
Cardinal starting pitcher Summer

Lee, a freshman, received little offensive
support, as Santa Clara starter Jessica
Acord held the Cardinal hitless through
the first five innings.
The Stanford bats remained quiet
until the seventh inning, in which the
team rallied for two nins. The Cardinal's
message to Acord included a hard line
drive hit by Ixh) which hit the pitcher on
her knee.
"[ln the first game] we made so many
errors and nothing seemed to be working
right," said Cardinal head coach Sandy
Pearce. "The thing that turned (the dou
bleheader 1 around was in the last inning
of the first game. After that we knew we
could hit Acord, and we were more confi
dent when we faced her in the second
game."
The Stanford ofTense wasted no time

in repeating its message to Acord during
the nightcap, as it drove in two runs in
the first inning.
"Our morale was up," said Stanford
sophomore Toni Marengo. "If we were
going to win it would be in the first
inning."
It was actually not until the third
inning when the Cardinal took control of
the game. Marengo, who bats second in
the Cardinal lineup, came to the plate
with one out and promptly drove the ball
to the outfield wall for an inside-the-park
home run.
"I came up with one out and nobody
on, thinking maybe I should bunt," said
Marengo. "But I just felt really good, and
when the pitch came I was thinking about
hitting a solid line drive. I've hit the
ball hard, but never like that. The
best Ipart] was when I was round
ing third and Sandy was sending
me home, Summer was shouting
for me at home plate, and the rest
of my teammates were waiting to
congratulate me. The whole experi
ence was wonderful — it was a
great way to end the season."
Freshman Angela Webb pitched
a complete game for the Cardinal,
allowing only five hits and no walks
during the 8-2 victory.
Webb also knocked out two hits
for the Cardinal, as did Lee and
sophomore Amanda Renteria. Lee,
who led Stanford batters this sea
son with a .388 average, drove in
three runs during the game.
During their final victory of the
season, the Stanford players
showed how well they are capable
of playing. Despite its low winning
percentage, the team has tried to
stay focused on improving.
"I'm sure it's been tough for our
pitchers," said catcher Lynn
Anderson of the Cardinal's losing
season. "For me, it was easy —

they were working hard till of the
time and that makes me happy.
What I've learned playing on a
team that isn't winning a lot is that
I need to stay self-motivated and
look for motivation in other
places."
Anderson, the team's captain,
will return to the Cardinal roster
next year, along with all of her
teammates. In addition, Stanford
has already strengthened its lineup
by securing three promising
recruits.
Yet Stanford will probably
rejoin the competitive Pacific 10
Conference next season after tak
ing a one-year exemption due to its
small roster size at the beginning of
the year.
"We definitely built up our con
fidence this year so that we'll be
more prepared for the Pac-10,"
said Lee. "But we won't know what
to expect until we play."
For Pearce, expectations are
high.
"The strides that the team has
made this year have been impres
sive," she said. "A lot of that
doesn't show up in the scores — it's
been frustrating. Yet the players'
improvements have shown that we
have a lot to look forward to next
year and in the future."
