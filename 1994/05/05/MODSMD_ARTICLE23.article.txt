# Playing her way
## Kurth's hard-hitting style finally paying dividends for senior star 
### Rob Ross Senior staff writer 
Tennis is mainly a mental game
in the collegiate ranks. In terms of
skill and pure tennis talent, little
separates the top player in the
nation from the 100 th. They may
have different styles and tenden
cies, but just considering the
basics — how hard they hit, how
fast they run, how high they can
jump — one will find little overall
difference between Stanford's No.
1 and Po Dunk State's No. 6 sin
gles players.
Mentally, though, the Grand
Canyon may as well exist between
these two. Confidence, aggressive
ness and even arrogance differen
tiates Ail-Americans like Stan
ford's Laxmi Poruri from the also
rans. Thus, success is tenuous,
built upon intangible qualities like
how one player is feeling that day,
rather than how fast she can run,
jump or swing.
Kristine Kurth is a case in
point. She has experienced emo
tional highs and lows which have
led both to success and disappoint
ment in her four-year NCAA ten
nis career.
Kurth, a tennis star from Mass
apequa High in Long Island, NY,
began her collegiate career at
William and Mary College in Vir
ginia. Tennis was not her first pri
ority and she chose William and
Mary because of its proximity to
home and its rigorous academics.
But she soon regretted this decision.
"My first six months I hated it,"
she said. "The atmosphere was
very southern and it was quite a
culture shock."
On the court, though, the 6-
foot freshman excelled. Playing in
the number one singles slot, she

surpassed expectations by tearing
up all competitors. She ended the
season ranked 16th in the coun
try, thereby garnering Ail-Ameri
can status.
Kurth attributes her confidence
levels to this amazing year. With
out the immense amount of pres
sure found at more high-powered
schools like Stanford, Kurth
played without fear.
"The competition wasn't very
good and there wasn't that much
pressure so I just went out and
played," Kurth said. "It wasn't like
Stanford at all."
"At William and Mary she was
number one," said Cardinal coach
Frank Brennan. "She thrived on
that and got a lot of attention
through her tennis. ... I think it's
easier to be a top-ranked player by
playing No. 1 at William and Mary.
You're a big fish in a small pond.
You build up your ranking and
your confidence. You win every
match. Then you go to nationals
and you win some matches that
maybe you shouldn't win."
By the end of her freshman
year, Kurth had begun to enjoy
William and Mary. By then,
though, she had another option —
Stanford.
"I didn't look anywhere else,"
she said. "It was Stanford or noth
ing I liked [William and Mary] by
that time."
Brennan had some reservations
about accepting such a highly
ranked transfer. Usually transfers
to the Farm have been No. 7 or No.
8 players who would not affect the
starting lineup much. But Kurth
was going to start immediately,
which could have affected team
chemistry.
