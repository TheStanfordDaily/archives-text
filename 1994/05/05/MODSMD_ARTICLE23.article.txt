# Playing her way
## Kurth's hard-hitting style finally paying dividends for senior star 
### Rob Ross Senior staff writer 
Tennis is mainly a mental game
in the collegiate ranks. In terms of
skill and pure tennis talent, little
separates the top player in the
nation from the 100 th. They may
have different styles and tenden
cies, but just considering the
basics — how hard they hit, how
fast they run, how high they can
jump — one will find little overall
difference between Stanford's No.
1 and Po Dunk State's No. 6 sin
gles players.
Mentally, though, the Grand
Canyon may as well exist between
these two. Confidence, aggressive
ness and even arrogance differen
tiates Ail-Americans like Stan
ford's Laxmi Poruri from the also
rans. Thus, success is tenuous,
built upon intangible qualities like
how one player is feeling that day,
rather than how fast she can run,
jump or swing.
Kristine Kurth is a case in
point. She has experienced emo
tional highs and lows which have
led both to success and disappoint
ment in her four-year NCAA ten
nis career.
Kurth, a tennis star from Mass
apequa High in Long Island, NY,
began her collegiate career at
William and Mary College in Vir
ginia. Tennis was not her first pri
ority and she chose William and
Mary because of its proximity to
home and its rigorous academics.
But she soon regretted this decision.
"My first six months I hated it,"
she said. "The atmosphere was
very southern and it was quite a
culture shock."
On the court, though, the 6-
foot freshman excelled. Playing in
the number one singles slot, she

surpassed expectations by tearing
up all competitors. She ended the
season ranked 16th in the coun
try, thereby garnering Ail-Ameri
can status.
Kurth attributes her confidence
levels to this amazing year. With
out the immense amount of pres
sure found at more high-powered
schools like Stanford, Kurth
played without fear.
"The competition wasn't very
good and there wasn't that much
pressure so I just went out and
played," Kurth said. "It wasn't like
Stanford at all."
"At William and Mary she was
number one," said Cardinal coach
Frank Brennan. "She thrived on
that and got a lot of attention
through her tennis. ... I think it's
easier to be a top-ranked player by
playing No. 1 at William and Mary.
You're a big fish in a small pond.
You build up your ranking and
your confidence. You win every
match. Then you go to nationals
and you win some matches that
maybe you shouldn't win."
By the end of her freshman
year, Kurth had begun to enjoy
William and Mary. By then,
though, she had another option —
Stanford.
"I didn't look anywhere else,"
she said. "It was Stanford or noth
ing I liked [William and Mary] by
that time."
Brennan had some reservations
about accepting such a highly
ranked transfer. Usually transfers
to the Farm have been No. 7 or No.
8 players who would not affect the
starting lineup much. But Kurth
was going to start immediately,
which could have affected team
chemistry.

Senior Kristine Kurth delivers one of her patented power shots in a match from earli
er this year. Following a roller-coaster first three years in collegiate tennis, Kurth has
finally settled into the No. 2 singles slot for the Cardinal.
The time was right, though.
Two seniors were graduating
and Debbie Graham was turn
ing pro, so Brennan had the
scholarship to give. And within
two weeks of her arrival Bren
nan knew he had made the cor
rect choice.
"It was really strange having
someone that good transfer in,"
Brennan said. "But she had this
different flair to her, and in
about two weeks everyone had
fallen in love with her. . . . She
has really fit in and been a great
personality, leader and a darn
good player."
A good player, but one with a
quirk. Mainly a baseline player
when she matriculated to Stan
ford, Kurth excelled in one area
— hitting hard. When her shots
were falling, Kurth could play
with anyone in the country, but
when she was missing, there
was little recourse.
"She really likes to hit hard,"
Brennan said. "It's like her per
sonality; there's really not
much disguise in either. Unfor
tunately, she's not very good at
hitting softly. So when the hard
ones aren't going in, telling her
to hit softly doesn't do any
good. She has no other speed.
She hits it hard and it goes in or
she hits it hard and it goes out,
or she hits it softly and it
doesn't get to the net."
In her first year on the Farm,
not much went in. From the
overwhelming confidence she
had as a freshman, Kurth began
to question her abilities. And
she had a nagging pain in her
back, which would not go away.
Soon nagging became excruciat
ing as the pain forced her to
serve underhand in some
matches.
Playing in such pain and los
ing at a higher frequency then
she did as a freshman took its
toll on Kurth. Her confidence
level plummeted, as did her
ranking.
"It was really frustrating. It
was hell," she said. "I look back
on that year and I don't know
how I got through it."
After the season ended, a
bone scan told Kurth what the
various other medical tech
niques had not: she had two
broken bones in her back. With

rest, the back mended soon Her
mental state took a while
longer.
"It took me a whole year to
get through it," Kurth said.
"Psychologically, it was devas
tating."
It took Kurth until the
NCAA Championships last year
before she felt emotionally
recovered from her disastrous
sophomore campaign. At
NCAAs she played well and won
the matches which clinched
team victories against Arizona
and Georgia, winning both in
third-set tie-breakers. Although
the team lost in the champi
onship match to Texas, Kurth
ended her junior year ranked
and on an emotional upswing.
That swing has carried into
her senior year. Adding more
net approaches to her power
game, Kurth played her way to
the No. 2 spot on the singles
ladder. At that position she has
battled to a 14-5 dual match
record in what Brennan calls
"definitely her best season."
Even her losses have been
encouraging. She dropped close
matches to both Jane Chi and
Keri Phebus early in the sea
son, and in those losses Bren
nan saw encouraging signs.
"She's at No. 2 and every
week she's taking on someone
good," Brennan said. "She's
actually played best in some of
her losses.
"She's really good at figuring
things out. In her first big loss
she lost some aggressiveness at
the end. So the next time she
was in that situation she hit the
ball harder and did the right
thing. She still lost, but at least
she had the consolation of say
ing, 'Hey, I didn't back off.' "
So now Kurth approaches
the end of her roller-coaster
ride of a career. Next week she
will help lead the Cardinal back
to the NCAA Championships
and perhaps its first crown
since 1991. Moreover, it was in
this tournament last year that
Kurth was finally able to shake
off the effects of her sophomore
year and begin to regain her Ail-
American confidence. Kurth,
though, harkens all the way
back to freshman year for the
secret to success.
"I've just got to go out there
and play," she said. "The game
is about 90 percent mental, you
know."
