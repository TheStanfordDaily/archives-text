# Show some maturity, guys
## Sports, violence make dangerous combination 
### 
The Atlanta Hawks and Miami Heat
engage in a bench-clearing brawl in
the first round of the playoffs, ring
ing up a total of $125,000 in fines.
Reggie Sanders charges the mound after
Pedro Martinez hits him with a pinch,
which incidentally breaks up Martinez's bid
for a perfect game in the eighth inning.
Some Little leagues are now banning the
traditional hand-shake after a game because
of the threat of fights breaking out.
Sound ridiculous? It should. While sport
was founded on the idea of physical con
frontation and the underlying level of vio
lence was implied by that, recently this con
flict has been taken to a new level. But the
violence in sports is now out of hand, and no
explanation can justify the fighting which
highlighted last weekend's NBA playoff
action.
Sure, basketball has become a contact
sport over the past 15 years. Sure, it's the
playoffs, where the intensity can go through
the roof. I guess this gave Dennis Rodman
the latitude to undercut Tom Chambers as
he was going in for a lay-up, wildly flail a
punch at Karl Malone's head after Rodman
had already committed a foul and knock
John Stockton out of the game with a hard
knee to Stockton's calf.
Check, please.
No matter what Rodman may think
about his outlandish hair and his non-con
formist playing style, these acts of violence
have no place whatsoever in the NBA.
This behavior typifies the message many
professional athletes are sending with their
actions. Since sports are about confronta
tion, it's okay to extend that confrontation
to a personal level, to physically defeat an
opponent outside of the rules if you can't do
it within the confines of the game.
Although league officials attempt to rec
tify the problem by handing down fines and
suspensions, this does little to dissuade the
types of players who make their livelihood
with rough play, like Rodman. Will he tone
down his wild-man act on the court because
of his recent one-game suspension for a fla
grant foul and two technicals? I highly
doubt it.
More than likely, he will come out with
more fire and anger in him. He should watch
his back before Karl Malone delivers a hay
maker like Robert Parish did to Bill Laimbeer
in one of the bruising Celtic-Piston match
ups in the late '80s. However, if Malone or
any member of the Jazz does this, it will only
legitimate Rodman's original actions. An eye
for an eye, a punch for a punch?

This argument doesn't work, period.
These are professionals, they should be set
ting the example for their sport. Something
should be going off in the players' heads
when they hear stories of Little League
games being interrupted by fights because
"that's what I saw the guys in the big
leagues doing." All opinions about athletes
being role models aside, there is no justifica
tion for sports figures to think their actions
don't have repercussions in society.

Rodman claims he does everything for his
daughter, that he wants her to have every
thing possible. Wake up, Dennis. There are
millions of little boys and girls your daugh
ter's age who see your actions and then
mimic you. How would you feel if your pride
and joy came home from school with a
bloody nose because some kid got a little too
physical under the hoop like you so often do?
A few years ago, college basketball had its
hands full with fights breaking out in
games. Then the NCAA came up with a
strict policy on fights. Throw a punch,
you're out of the game. And the next one.
Leave the bench in a fight, you're gone too.
Get involved in another fight during the
year, you are suspended for the entire year.
It's that simple.
While this strict punishment may not be
applicable in professional sports, measures
beyond fines and one- or two-game suspen
sions should be examined. Maybe a sliding
scale of suspensions, with each fight or fla
grant foul increasing a player's time off
without pay, would force a change in some
players.
I'm sorry, Mr. Oakley, since this is your
eighth flagrant foul this year, you '11 be out
for 10 games.
I wonder how many people playing bas
ketball today remember the story of Rudy
Tomjanovich and Kermit Washington. Dur
ing the 1977 season, Washington, then with
the Los Angeles leakers, threw a punch at
