# Similar struggles
## Students mobilizing around Chicano issues on other campuses 
### Scott Van Winkle Staff writer 
The scene that greeted Stanford students cut
ting through the Quad yesterday morning — stu
dents marching, tents and banners blocking off
the center of campus — may have surprised
many, but it is not an isolated event.

Students at UC-Santa Barbara,
University of Colorado and
UCLA have held similar protests.

Nine students at UC-Santa Barbara will begin
their ninth day of fasting today, and a hunger
strike on the University of Colorado campus at
Boulder concluded only last week. Both events, as
well as a 14-day protest at UCLA last spring,
attempted to force recognition of Chicano/Latino
issues.
UC-Santa Barbara protesters are demanding a
moratorium on student-fee increases, a universi
ty-wide boycott of grapes, a doctoral program in
Chicano studies, a community center in neighbor
ing East La Vista and 15 more Chicano/Latino
faculty members.
The boycott, organized by campus
Chicano/Latino group El Congreso, has blocked
off the main administrative building on campus
and garnered national attention from Spanish
language television, according to UC-Santa Bar
bara spokesperson Joan McGridden.
A "negotiating team" of four high-level admin
istrators has been meeting with students over the
past four days to end the strike, said McGridden.
El Congreso chair Abel Gutierrez said that
after "feeling out" students, administrators
offered counter-proposals to meet some of their
demands, and students revised their stipulations
in later negotiations.
UC-Santa Barbara currently has the only Chi
cano studies department in the University of Cal
ifornia system. Three full-time and one half-time

faculty positions are allocated to the program.
Another fast on the University of Colorado
campus at Boulder ended last week when school
President Judith Albino agreed to striking stu
dents' goal of an ethnic studies department at the
university.
Thirty-seven students, many of them members
of the campus chapter of MEChA — a
Chicano/Latino student group — and United Mex
ican-American Students, began the strike during
a rally urging the university to grant Asst. Prof.
Estevan Flores tenure.
While Albino agreed to some of the group's
demands in principle, the decision on whether to
renew Flores' tenure has not yet been made,
according to university spokesperson Jeannine
Malmsbury.
Ethnic studies had been "in the works" for a
while before the strike began, Malmsbury added.
Last year's 14-day hunger strike on the UCLA
campus, in which nine people called for a Chicano
studies department, was perhaps the most highly
publicized of recent campus strikes.

'Without faculty support their
attempts are going to be
attempts in futility.'
— Carlos Grijalva

UCLA has since established the Cesar Chavez
Center for Chicano Studies and named UCLA
Assoc. Dean Carlos Grijalva as director.
Grijalva said he personally favors compromise
to affect change instead of the "extremist kind of
approach" represented by hunger strikes, while
admitting the strike "moved the timetable ffor the
center] forward significantly."
The success of the strike was "a matter of tim
ing" that depended on "getting people engaged in
the process" after the strike ended, he said.
"Without faculty support their attempts are going
to be attempts in futility."
