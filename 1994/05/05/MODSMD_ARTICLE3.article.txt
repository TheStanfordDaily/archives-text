# Chicano students protest, begin fast
## Casper offers limited concessions after receiving list of demands; hunger strike likely to continue Protesters' Demands 
### Andy Dworkin Senior staff writer 
Scores of students crowded
into the Inner Quad yesterday
morning, launching a hunger
strike to protest Stanford's
"open hostility to minorities"
and the University's handling of
issues affecting the campus Chi
cano/Latino community.
Claiming that "our education
is not addressing the real issues
and challenges facing society
today," the protesters presented
a list of four demands to Univer
sity administrators.
The activists are seeking a
University boycott of grapes, the
creation of a program in Chicano
studies, the establishment of a
community center in East Palo
Alto and the rehiring in some ca
pacity of Cecilia Burciaga, the
Chicana administrator laid-off
in March.
About 50 protesters, many
dressed in black shirts and red
armbands, picketed in the Quad
for much of the day. In an area
cordoned off by ropes, the ac
tivists pitched two tents, one
covered by blankets. Signs read
ing "Stanford stands 4 igno
rance," and "iNo uvas! Boycott
grapes," were hung around the
encampment.
University President Ger
hard Casper heard the protest
ers' demands yesterday morn
ing, and he and Provost Con
doleezza Rice met with the
demonstrators late in the after
noon, announcing that they
have created committees to ad
dress three of the demands — all
except finding a job for Burciaga.
Despite the new committees
and an hour-long discussion,
many protesters said they were
dissatisfied with the official re
sponse. So, into the night, the
strike continued.
The hunger strike will not
end until the demands are met, a

• High-level position
offer for Cecilia Burcia
ga.
• Community Center for
East Palo Alto commu
nity.
• A ban on grapes on
campus.
• More support for Chi
cano studies.

student spokesperson said.
"We decided that these are is
sues we really need to be out
here for and that people need to
fast for. We want what we're
asking for and we're not willing
to settle for anything else," said
Gabi Cervantes, co-chair of
MEChA, a Chicano/Latino stu
dent organization spearheading
the strike.
Forty-two Stanford students
have committed to fast for 24
hours, and a small number —
probably four yet unnamed stu
dents — say they will continue to
fast until all demands are satis
fied. Last night, dozens of stu
dents stayed huddled together in
the darkened tents of the Quad.
University called insensitive
The four demands stand
against a background of institu
tional insensitivity to the poor
and minorities in general and
specifically to the Chicano/Lati
no community at Stanford, ac
cording to a handbill that de
tailed the protesters' complaints
and requests.
The document said Stanford
has perpetuated "poverty, un
employment and homelessness

by refusing to adapt its curricu
lum to address these issues."
In recent years, the University
has shown hostility to minorities
by eliminating the Office of
Graduate Studies and a presiden
tial assistant on Mexican-Ameri
can affairs in 1991, attacking the
legitimacy of ethnic centers and
laying off Burciaga, the leaflet
said.
In response to these charges,
the activists first demanded that
the University offer "a high-level
position" to Burciaga, citing her
importance to many students,
especially working-class stu
dents, and her social activism.
The 20-year Stanford employ
ee's job as associate vice provost
for student affairs was eliminat
ed last month as part of a budget
cutting process. Since that time
significant outcry has cropped
up, with some students and fac
ulty claiming the firing was
insensitive.
The demands also include the
establishment of a community
center in East Palo Alto. While
they provided no details about
what the center would do, the
protesters asked for "a commit
tee consisting of East Palo Alto
community members, Stanford
students and University admin
istrators dedicated to bridging
the gap between academia and
society at large."
This will pay back residents of
that low-income city who, as
employees, "keep Stanford oper
ating" but "only receive the min
imum amount of respect and vir
tually no compensation," the
handbill said.
Third, the protesters asked
that the University take part in
the long-standing grape boycott
and cease serving grapes in dor
mitories, at the Faculty Club and
in other locations around cam
pus. The fact that grapes are
served "is an insult and a show of
disrespect ... to our entire com
munity and all those who believe
in human rights," the handbill
said.
Finally, the demonstrators
demanded that Stanford increase
the funding and staff support for
the Chicano Fellows Program

and offer an undergraduate
major in "Chicana/o Studies."
The program would hopefully
counteract "growing racial and
class tensions" in America as
well as "anti-immigrant atti
tudes."
Negotiations begin
Casper and Rice first respond
ed to the protesters' demands by
meeting with three student nego
tiators, Dean of Students
Michael Jackson and El Centro
Chicano Director Frances
Morales for an hour yesterday
morning. Then, in the afternoon,
Casper and Rice announced their
proposals to deal with the issues.
The administrators
announced the formation of sep
arate committees to study the
grape boycott, Chicano studies
and the creation of an East Palo
Alto community center. Rice
said students will have a chance
to serve on all three committees.
One group will examine the
possibility of expanding the Chi
cano Fellows Program, including

'I hear a lot of words,
and then I see ac
tions that are entire
ly contrary.'

Hernandez

an investigation of how much
faculty support exists for the cre
ation of a full-fledged major in
Chicano studies. The committee,
headed by incoming Assoc. Dean
of Undergraduate Studies
Ramon Saldivar, should form
within 10 days and report by the
end of next fall quarter, Casper
said. The committee will also
examine Asian-American stud
ies, he added.
Political Science Prof. Luis
Fraga will chair the committee
investigating grapes, a group
which will include Vice Provost
for Student Affairs Mary
Edmonds, who ultimately over
sees Dining Services.
Finally, a committee will
study coordinating all of Stan
ford's volunteer programs in

East Palo Alto and examine how
Stanford can effectively work in
and with the city. Haas Center
Director Tim Stanton and Mag
dalena Fittoria, a Stanford grad
uate who manages the
Ravenswood School District's
Even-Start Program, will chair
the committee.
Casper and Rice said, howev
er, that they could not search for
new jobs for Burciaga. While
apologizing for any pain the lay
off caused Burciaga or the Stan
ford community, Rice said there
are no new high level jobs into
which Burciaga could be placed
because of budget cuts.
This answer did not satisfy
many of the protesters, however.
"Right now this piece of paper
means we here don't eat," said
one woman in the crowd. "So, is
the answer (to the Burciaga
demand) no?"
Facing off
As the sun set, the two sides
faced off over the issues for an
hour. Circled by about 110
protesters and onlookers, Casper
and Rice presented their propos
als while the activists asked
questions and leveled criticisms.
The discussion was generally
orderly, but participants seldom
seemed to see eye to eye on the
issues.
Many protesters said they
believe University administra
tors have acted callously, espe
cially in laying off Burciaga, and
accused Casper and Rice of mak
ing commitments to diversity,
but not following through with
those commitments in their
actions.
"I hear a lot of words, and
then I see actions that are entire
ly contrary," said graduate stu
dent Francisca James Hernan
dez, one of the protesters. For
example, she said, Casper has
expressed a commitment to
diversity but spoke against a
statement on diversity proposed
by the Western Association of
Schools and Colleges. He also
hurt the recruitment of minority
students by cutting Burciaga's
position, she said.
Casper countered that he does
believe in diversity and has been
outspoken on the issue, and is
frustrated that students do not
seem to believe his statements.
He said he opposed the WASC
statement because it would
increase government regulation
of the University.
The elimination of Burciaga's
position was not meant to hurt
recruitment, he said. Indeed,
Rice added, a faculty member
was appointed to a new position
that deals with recruiting and
retaining minority and female
faculty earlier this year.
Casper and Rice, on their part,
said the demands had caught
them by surprise, and Casper
said the strike was like "holding
a gun to my head."
Before yesterday morning,
Casper said, no students had
approached him with requests
for a boycott of grapes or an East
Palo Alto community center.
"The point is that this is the
first that we've been asked, the
two of us, to consider this at

Stanford," Rice said.
But protester Alma Medina, a
graduate student, said that
"these are not issues that are
new," but struggles that have
been going on for a long time.
Rice said that she had planned
to address concerns of the Chi
cano/Latino community and been
waiting to hear from a task force
related to El Centro Chicano
about when she could meet with
them.
Medina said the task force is
still meeting and preparing to
talk with Rice, and the strike is a
separate process.
Casper also said the strikers
put him in a bad position by
demanding immediate answers
to questions that would take a
long time to settle. The president
said he cannot simply pass any
policy he desires by fiat.
"The way you have
approached this discussion is
indeed by creating an ultima
tum," Casper said.
Demands are complex
While student want quick
responses, it would take time to
meet many of the demands.
Expanding the Chicano Fel
lows Program, for example,
would require support from fac
ulty members. Proposals for new
academic programs must then go
through the dean of Humanities
and Sciences for approval, said A 1
Camarillo, a history professor
and associate dean of Humani
ties and Sciences.
If the new program were to
grant a degree, Camarillo added,
the Faculty Senate would have to
give its approval.
Claudia Carrillo, the adminis
trative assistant of the Chicano
Fellows Program, said that
increased funding would be quite
welcome.
The 23-year-old program
offers five classes of its own each

year and cross-lists courses with
other departments. In total, Car
rillo said, between two and seven
classes a year now go through the
program, some of which are
attended by hundreds of stu
dents.
Additional staff and a commit
ment to funding the program
would be welcome, Carrillo said.
Now, she said, the program is
budgeted on an annual basis and
so funding is uncertain from year
to year. A major is "very much
needed," she said, and is rare at
universities around the country.
Casper said the issues of
grapes and East Palo Alto are

cussion is indeed by

also complicated. Banning grapes
is tied up with questions of
whether the majority of people
on campus want to eat grapes,
legal concerns and the Universi
ty's historical policy on grapes,
he said.
As he found out this morning,
Casper said, former University
President Donald Kennedy and
Provost James Rosse approved a
policy under which Stanford does
not boycott grapes but allows
individual residence halls to vote
on whether to serve them.
Dealing with East Palo Alto is
a particularly difficult issue,
according to both Rice and
Casper. The city is a complex
community, Stanford already
has many programs there to
coordinate and questions of deal

ing with the city government are
involved, they said.
Can't happen overnight
After the administrators and
the protesters heard each other
out, both sides said they were
afraid the other would not com
promise.
By going on a hunger strike,
Casper said, the students are
asking for quick decisions to in
depth problems. And, he added,
decisions must go through chan
nels that take time.
"We can't fix the kind of edu
cational issues you want fixed
about grapes and the boycott
overnight," Rice said.
The protesters, however,
seemed less than fully satisfied
with the administrative
response, as their presence in the
cold night air of the Quad
demonstrated.
The protesters still have to
discuss the administrative
response, Hernandez said, but
for now will continue their
strike. Meanwhile, more activi
ties have been planned for tomor
row.
The long-term fasters will
hold a press conference today at
11 a.m. in the Quad. The demon
strators are also asking that stu
dents walk out of their classes at
11:25 today. A rally is planned
for 20 minutes later in White
Plaza.
Hernandez said she has "a
sense of continuing blockade and
intransigence" after hearing
Casper and Rice, and said she felt
the administrators would only
meet the protesters on their own
terms, not on the students'
terms.
But Rice said there are chan
nels that must be respected at
the University. "[The protestersl
will not get around anywhere by
trying to work around the kind of
processes we use," she said.
