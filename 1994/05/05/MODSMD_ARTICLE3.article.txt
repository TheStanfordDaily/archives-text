# Chicano students protest, begin fast
## Casper offers limited concessions after receiving list of demands; hunger strike likely to continue Protesters' Demands 
### Andy Dworkin Senior staff writer 
Scores of students crowded
into the Inner Quad yesterday
morning, launching a hunger
strike to protest Stanford's
"open hostility to minorities"
and the University's handling of
issues affecting the campus Chi
cano/Latino community.
Claiming that "our education
is not addressing the real issues
and challenges facing society
today," the protesters presented
a list of four demands to Univer
sity administrators.
The activists are seeking a
University boycott of grapes, the
creation of a program in Chicano
studies, the establishment of a
community center in East Palo
Alto and the rehiring in some ca
pacity of Cecilia Burciaga, the
Chicana administrator laid-off
in March.
About 50 protesters, many
dressed in black shirts and red
armbands, picketed in the Quad
for much of the day. In an area
cordoned off by ropes, the ac
tivists pitched two tents, one
covered by blankets. Signs read
ing "Stanford stands 4 igno
rance," and "iNo uvas! Boycott
grapes," were hung around the
encampment.
University President Ger
hard Casper heard the protest
ers' demands yesterday morn
ing, and he and Provost Con
doleezza Rice met with the
demonstrators late in the after
noon, announcing that they
have created committees to ad
dress three of the demands — all
except finding a job for Burciaga.
Despite the new committees
and an hour-long discussion,
many protesters said they were
dissatisfied with the official re
sponse. So, into the night, the
strike continued.
The hunger strike will not
end until the demands are met, a

• High-level position
offer for Cecilia Burcia
ga.
• Community Center for
East Palo Alto commu
nity.
• A ban on grapes on
campus.
• More support for Chi
cano studies.

student spokesperson said.
"We decided that these are is
sues we really need to be out
here for and that people need to
fast for. We want what we're
asking for and we're not willing
to settle for anything else," said
Gabi Cervantes, co-chair of
MEChA, a Chicano/Latino stu
dent organization spearheading
the strike.
Forty-two Stanford students
have committed to fast for 24
hours, and a small number —
probably four yet unnamed stu
dents — say they will continue to
fast until all demands are satis
fied. Last night, dozens of stu
dents stayed huddled together in
the darkened tents of the Quad.
University called insensitive
The four demands stand
against a background of institu
tional insensitivity to the poor
and minorities in general and
specifically to the Chicano/Lati
no community at Stanford, ac
cording to a handbill that de
tailed the protesters' complaints
and requests.
The document said Stanford
has perpetuated "poverty, un
employment and homelessness
