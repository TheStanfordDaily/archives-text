# Desperately seeking Madonna Allison Amend
## 
### 
Have I told you about my Madonna
obsession? It started back in junior
high, when my best friend and I
dressed up in my mom's aerobic wear to
emulate our model of feminine modernity:
Madonna.
Complete with gummy bracelets from
wrist to elbow and darkened birthmarks
that faded to black smudges after hour-long
dance sessions in my basement, we looked
the part and I have the photos to prove it.
Ahhh, youth.
But I forgot to grow out of it. Ixrng after
most "Holidays" and "Get Into the Grooves"
were just radio relics, I was still jammin' to
the sweet melodies of "Borderline." The
lyrics spoke to me, brimming with the idyl
lic romanticism of fated first love ("Lucky
Star") and the reiteration of the values my
grandmother attempted to instill in me
("Material Girl"). And, of course, my pre
teen identification with "Like a Virgin" ...
But anyway, I stuck with the prima donna
of the music world, through such cinematic
triumphs as "Who's that Girl" and "Desper
ately Seeking Susan." When "Vogue" came
out, I was right up on stage in that all-ages

dance club posing my little heart out.
Then there was a glorious summer pre
collegiate boredom, when I mounted my bi
cycle every morning to search for the Queen
of Pop, filming "A League of Their Own"
near my house in Chicago. I even consid
ered driving to Indiana when they did their
location shots.
But I never even caught a glimpse.
Though my friend Sarah saw her eating in a
shi-shi downtown restaurant, and a crucial
scene was filmed next door to Alexis, and
Danny saw her dancing in a cage in a trendy
night club, I was not among the fortunate.
Then I got that fat envelope from a cer
tain West Coast university and its proximity
to Los Angeles lit those lucky stars in my eyes
once again. I waited until spring quarter,
blindly ignoring the disparaging remarks
over the new "Erotica" album and trying to
quell my queasy stomach when my room
mate brought home the "Sex" book. I even

wrote a freshman term paper on Her Sexi
ness (and I got an A- thank you very much).
We took off down I lighway 5, the desert
landscape only enhancing my excitement in
anticipation of my arrival in Hollywood,
home to Madonna.
I held my tongue all weekend, forcing
myselfto visit Mann's Chinese theater, the I-a
Brea tar pits, Venice Beach, until I could hold
out no longer. "A pilgrimage!" I proclaimed,
"A holy vigil in front of the shrine that is
Madonna's house." When 1 promised my
companions I'd buy them lunch if they took
me, my roommate stole a map of the stars'
homes, and we headed toward the hills.
I felt as though I was coming home. As
the car huffed and puffed up the long hills,
the road became soothing, familiar, it al
most hummed a tune I knew so well: "I
made it through the wilderness..."
At last we reached a wrought iron gate
surrounding a massive pink house. Pink!

Perfect! As if in a trance, I descended from
the car and floated slowly toward the gate.
As I extended my hand to make contact with
the bars that contained my idol, a large body
guard stepped into view.
"What do you want?" he demanded. My
heart began to pound, my palms to sweat,
my vision to blur. I was unable to utter a
word. 1 turned and ran back to the car, and
we pulled away quickly.
Later that night I called my friend Mandy.
Breathlessly, I explained how close I was,
how we were almost breathing the same air.
"Who, Madonna?" she said. "I saw her last
week in a bar called the 10th Street Lounge."
I was crushed. Not only did unfeeling
Mandy get the first glimpse, but her de
scription was less than flattering. Short,
without makeup, garish hair-color, emaci
ated features, and "she was dressed like a
slob" somehow changed my perceptions.
"The Immaculate Collection" safely en
sconced in the trash can in the bathroom, I
turned my attentions to my latest find, a
retro-collection of the greatest female pop
star ever: Cyndi Lauper. After all, don't all
girls just wanna have fun? â–
