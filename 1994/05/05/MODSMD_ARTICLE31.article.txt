Punk music has been around on major labeis for a long time.
The Cure, Siouxsie and the Banshees, even U2 were all punk
bands at one point in history. The Sex Pistols themselves were
really nothing but naive kids taken advantage of by some quick-think
ing, opportunistic record producers.
In the aftermath of "grunge," record corporations are looking to the
future. Sensing the increased mainstream acceptance of loud, angry,
punk-derived music, they know the youth market will get tired of punk
influenced pop music like Nirvana, and they're seeking out its successor.
In the past few years, lots of well-known, respected punk bands from the independent
records scene have been snapped up by major labels. For example: veteran punkers Bad Reli
gion, Japanese freak-punk band The Boredoms, D.C scenesters Jawbox and Berkeley's soon
to-be buzz-band of the century Green Day.
Add to that list San Diego's Drive Like lehu.
Post barDcorc punk | '" I
Drive Like Jehu is composed of members from two well-known previous bands, Pitchfork
and Night Soil Man: lead screamer and guitarist Rick Froberg, guitarist John Reis, bassist
Mike Kennedy, and drummer Mark Trombino. Their first homonymous LP, released on San
Diego's Cargo/Headhuntcr label, made quite a stir in the indie/punk scene. Its driving inten
sity earned a lot of comparisons to Fugazi early on. But according to Kennedy, those compar
isons have faded as the band has grown in popularity.
However, Drive Like Jehu can be classified with Fugazi and Jawbox in the emerging "post
hardcore" punk genre. It must be hard to be one of the first bands in a new genre. To listeners
not intimately familiar with the music, it can all sound the same. All bands inevitably get com
pared to the first well-known band of the style. Even today, all pop-punk bands get blindly
compared to the Ramones, no matter far they have progressed.
But Drive Like Jehu doesn't stoop to imitating similar bands. It definitely has its own dis
tinct, original, unmistakable sound. Jehu songs are instantly recognizable by their unusual
rhythms, Froberg's screamed vocals, his and Reis' tortured, whining guitars, thundering bass
chords and long, complex, dynamic structures.

About a year ago, Drive Like Jehu signed with Interscope Records, a semi-independent
subsidiary of the Goliath Atlantic Records. The deal was reportedly part of Interscope's con
tract with sister band Rocket From the Crypt, fronted by Reis.
Awards for hardest working person ever must go to Reis, who both produces and records
music. He's worked with Superchunk and other popular bands, as well as both Rocket and
Jehu, and alternates between touring with the two bands ceaselessly.
Do Reis' other commitments get in the way of Drive Like Jehu's plans? "The only thing it
does hamper is keeping the momentum going ... when one band's on the road, the other
one's not, so you're not doing anything" Kennedy says.
HJe're all still staroing'
About their new album, bassist Kennedy says,"I think it's better recorded. We were able to
spend more time on it, and that's a plus. I think we've grown a little bit, and refined what we
do a little bit more than we did on the first record."
"Before, we had 'X' amount of dough to record the first record, and that only allowed us
'X' amount of time to do it. And we had more money to do it this time, so we spent some more
time in mixing and recording stuff.... It's no great amount of money. We're all still starving."
"Yank Crime" definitely sounds a little cleaner than the previous, now-classic LP. Howev
er, it avoids the super-precision, studio-overload sound of Helmet or Smashing Pumpkins,
which signals the death of punk music. The songs sound close to live cuts, with lots of grating
guitar noise and tight coordination with the rhythm section.
An advantage, however, of the better production is that lead screamer Rick Froberg's vo
cals are more audible than on their first LP. Says Kennedy, "we tried to get them up a little bit
more than we did on the first record. That's something we like though, is to have the vocals
not be so powerful that it overwhelms the music.... Music is the main thing, lyrics are kinda
secondary. 1 mean, we write all the songs and we put the songs together before Rick even
thinks of one word for the song. Rut he does some cool stuff so we brought it up more this
time."
Although the vocals are clearer, it's still pretty hard to make out words. Why didn't they fol
low the punk tradition (subtle irony?) and include lyrics? According to Kennedy, "[Rick]
doesn't like putting them in the CD.... He'd rather not include the lyrics because it's like
something for people to figure 0ut.... So it's a little bit of mystery there." However, a lyric
sheet is included on the vinyl album. And "in the CD, there's an address, and if you send an
envelope to Rick, he'll send you the lyrics."
Kennedy gives rave reviews to Interscope Records, home to big alternative acts like Primus
and Nine Inch Nails. "It's great. It just seems like a slighdy bigger independent. I don't really
see much of a difference. I really like a lot of the people there, they're cool.
"And it's a relatively small record label as it is; they've got about 25 bands, compared to
Cargo, which has hundreds. So, they still pay attention to you even though they've got these
huge other acts like Snoop and Dre. 1 don't have one bad thing to say about them."

However, the band is well aware of the dangers of major labels. Jehu has no desire to be
come the next industry buzz band. "As far as pushing the record and everything, we went up
there and talked to Interscope and said, hey, we don't want to be pushed on heavy-metal sta
tions, we don't want to be pushed on this, we don't want to be pushed at all. We wanted to stay
away from getting it one farther step away out of our hands. If we let Adantic take some [con
trol], then there's another person between us mvf the people that are doing things."
The band is also avoiding the trap of releasing a single and a video. "We don't gear our
music to writing a single," says Kenned). "We \*ritc all these songs, we like them all, we put
them all on the record, and that's it."
And for good reason. Jehu's new album, "Yank Crime " like its first one, doesn't have a bad
song on it. The album is a little more diverse than "Drive Like Jehu," with four straight-ahead
full-on rockers, four long dynamic masterpieces, and one marvelous slow instrumental piece
reminiscent of Codeine or Bitch Magnet.
The full-on, off-tempo rock songs are amazing enough by themselves, but it's the long dy
namic pieces that really show the band's full capacity. All four of these tracks are more than
seven minutes (two are more than nine). "Super Unison" is probably the best song on the
album, with its raucous first half leading into a long, quiet build-up into a short, intense, or
giastic conclusion.
The album as a whole is similar to the first, in that if you haven't realized how good it is,
you simply haven't listened to it enough. It's sort of a "creeper" album. It will grow on you,
from initial liking to simple worship.

Rocket From the Crypt has just finished their latest tour, so now it's Drive Like Jehu's turn. If you're
in the liny Area around June 27, don't miss it (location T.H.A.).
