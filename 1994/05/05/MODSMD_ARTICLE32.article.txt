# 1+26=Unity One man, many characters

Matthew Francis is having an identity
crisis. Francis, a junior, stars as not
one, but 26 characters in "She Just
Stopped Breathing," the one-person show he
wrote, directed and produced himself.
He developed the play last quarter as part
of a Drama Department class taught by ac
claimed thespian Anna Deveare Smith, who
is currently in New York performing her own
one-person show.
"She Just Stopped Breathing" chronicles
the life and death of Francis' mother, who
died of cancer when the actor was 13.
A one-person show seemed a creative way
"to get to know my mother not just as my
mother," Francis said. "The show isn't about
who I think she was. It's about who she was.
It's about all these voices saying good-bye in
their own ways."
Francis "never sat down and said 'I'm
going to do a show about my mother dying,' "
he said. "It came out because it needed to
come out."
Opening doors
In tact, Francis never expected to do a
show at all. The class was designed to help
students through the early stages of develop
ing one-person shows, and they were not re
quired to mount them. Francis credits Smith
with encouraging him to complete and per
form the piece.
"She gave me permission to create as I had
never created before," he said. "She put my
imagination on the spot."
Francis "wrote" the play with his voice and
body, rather than pen and paper. Typically,
this meant lying on the floor of the rehearsal
hall, extemporizing lines into a tape recorder.
He drew ideas and inspiration from videos of
one-person shows by Smith, Lily Tomlin and
Spalding Gray.
The experience "changed my life," Francis
said. A music major, he had planned on a ca
reer in vocal performance. Although Francis
has performed in student musicals, a cappel
la groups and the Stanford Improvisers, he's
never played a dramatic role. Now, he's hop
ing to pursue a master's degree in acting.
"Anna's whole philosophy is that you jour
ney to a character outside yourself, rather

than trying to identify with them," Francis
said. That technique "opened up so many
new doors" that he was eventually able to cre
ate 26 characters, ranging from the realistic
to the fantastic to the surreal. "Once I had
started, the voices wouldn't stop."
Telling the story
"She Just Stopped Breathing" is all about
voices — voices hoarse with grief, scared chil
dren's voices, soft maternal voices and voices
raised in anger. Francis invokes the voices of
his parents, his pre-school teacher, his twin
brother, a social worker, a clown, a deaf man
and a surgeon, I le even portrays Smith.
Francis' musical training surfaces several
times in the show. His cast of characters in
cludes Patti La belle, Ethel Merman and him
self as a teenage choir member.
Rather than having 26 costume changes,
Francis uses simple props like hats, glasses,
coats and scarves to suggest each one. Like
Smith, he performs barefoot, and in neutral
clothing, accented by meaningful acces
sories.
"I'm doing it barefoot because what am I
going to wear?" he asked. "Men's shoes?
Women's shoes? Clown shoes?"
But "She Just Stopped Breathing" is hardly
minimalist theater. All 26 characters occupy
an elaborate set that alternately serves as an of
fice, a hospital, a bedroom and a concert hall.
Like Smith, Francis prefaces each monologue
with an actual photo of the character when
possible, projected on an on-stage screen.
Although the play does not have a script, it
remains basically the same from show to
show. "The things that stuck with me were
the things that told the story," Francis said.
Rather than memorizing lines, Francis
worked to develop characters. While his
exact words may very from performance to
performance, "the message is the same each
time because the characters are the same."
Some of Francis' monologues are only a
few seconds long; others last several minutes.
"She just Stopped Breathing" contains 33
scenes spanning 21 years, but not necessarily
in chronological order.
This arrangement works, Francis said,
"because the play is about remembering.

Memory doesn't happen all at once. Particu
larly when you've lost someone, there are cer
tain memories that you're always ready to call
upon, then there are some memories that
come to you in a flash."
Framing memories
While crafting the show, Francis drew ma
terial from his mother's letters and journals
and interviewed her friends, doctors and rel
atives — "the people who were closest to her.
"Those were some of the neatest conversa
tions I've ever had," he said.
While Smith, who also interviews her char
acters, repeats their words verbatim on-stage,
Francis admits to taking some dramatic li
cense. "Because the show deals with absence, I
had to rely on my memory more than any
thing — the memory of a very young boy."
Hut certain documents — a letter, a book,
a death notice — are read in their entirety.
The play itself is a document, recording events

and feelings that have gone unspoken for too
long.
"When my mom died, a lot of her stuff
went with her," Francis said. "My dad threw
everything away. This show is my photo
album. It's a way of framing these memories
and making them concrete. And this way I
can share them with people."
"She Just Stopped Breathing" is obviously
a deeply personal work, but Francis hopes
that it will illuminate other people's lives as
well, particularly people who have lost loved
ones.
The play is not just about grief, but the ex
perience ofgrieving. Francis wants to remind
people that "it's OK to remember. It's OK to
feel alone. And it's OK to talk about it.' ■

"She Stopped Breathing"premieres tonight at 8
p.m. at the Eleanor Prosser Studio in Memorial
Hall. The show runs through Saturday. Tickets
are SJ and can only be purchased at the door.
