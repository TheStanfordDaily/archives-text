# The 						San Francisco International Film Festival From A to Z
## 
### N'Gai Croal Ed Yoon 
We've got two words for you. Film festival.
That's right. The 37th annual San Fran
cisco Film Festival is happening as we
speak. 209 films. 50 countries. 29 languages.
60,000-plus in attendance. In other words:
big, big, big.
You're probably thinking that film festivals
are events that other people attend. Visions of
Gerard Depardieu, David Lynch or Sharon
Stone strolling across the Croisette in the
Cannes summer heat are no doubt dancing
through your head. Not true.
Film festivals — they're not just for stars
anymore.
And that's doubly true of the San Francis
co Film Festival. Founded in 1957, it is the
oldest film festival in the Western Hemi
sphere. It is presented each year by the non
profit San Francisco Film Society and widely
considered to be one of the world's best.
What's more, the festival reaches beyond
its San Francisco locations — the AMC Kabu
ki 8 Theatres and the Castro — to the Pacific
Film Archive in Berkeley and the Landmark
Palo Alto Square Theatre in Palo Alto.
But enough bare facts. You're convinced,
you want to go — but you're a little nervous.
It's your first film festival and you don't know
a gaffer (electrician) from a grip (dolly-push
er). Or which Coen brother produces (Joel),
which one directs (Ethan) and which one
writes (both).
No fear.
The elves at Intermission have kindly pre
pared an A to Z guide to festival-going — tips,
tricks and the technical language that you'll
need to come off like a seasoned film fanatic.

His for Akira Kurosawa, a major deity not only in his home
land of Japan, but around the world. He burst onto the in
ternational filmmaking scene with "Rashomon," a bravu
ra meditation on truth and trust in a world without honor.
His famed and oft-remade samurai films ("Yojimbo" and
"The Seven Samurai") cemented his reputation, as did his re
interpretations of Shakespeare's plays ("Macbeth" as

"Throne of Blood" and "King Lear" as "Ran") in Japaneseset
tings. The festival's Akira Kurosawa Award is given each year
to a filmmaker nearing the end of a rich career.
Bis for Bandian, the hero of Guinean director Cheik
Doukore's second film as director. "Le Ballon D'Or" stars
Aboubacar Sidiki Sumah as Bandian, a soccer-mad youth
whose life turns upside down when a French doctor gives him
a genuine leather soccer ball. Hence the title, "Golden Ball."
The ensuing events take him from the countryside of Guinea
to the big city and its grueling soccer season all the way to
Roissy, France — with many colorful encounters along the
way. Shot in an almost documentary style, Doukore's sopho
more effort promises the drama and comedy of "The Gods
Must Be Crazy" without any of that film's Western conde
scension.
Cis for the sold-out Closing Night Film, which this year hap
pens to be Spike Lee's latest effort, "Crooklyn." This repre
sents a homecoming of sorts for Lee, whose debut smash
"She's Gotta Have It" had its world premiere at the San Fran
cisco Film Festival. "Crooklyn" finds Lee working in a minor
key (compared to the operatic "Malcolm X"), with a semi-au
tobiographical tale of a schoolteacher and an unemployed
jazz musician trying to raise their five children in 1970s
Brooklyn, New York. Given Lee's prodigious crowd-pleasing
instincts and the en vogue-ness of all things '70s, "C" might
also stand for Crashing — as in get into that bad boy any way
you can.

DWho better for D
than Gerard Depar
dieu, the man who
embodies French cine
ma. At the ripe old age
of 45, he has already
made nearly 80 movies.
From"The Return of
Martin Guerre" to Jean-
Luc Godard's latest,
"Helas Pour Moi," De
pardieu continues to
redfine the word "pro
lific." For his numerous
and important contribu

tions to film history, he is being given the Piper-Heidseck
Award, which recognizes "independence, courage, risk-tak
ing and the avoidance of the conventional."

Eis for elite, as in the people you might he sitting next to at
any one of the screenings you'll be attending. If you recog
nize someone famous, keep your cool and ask them for an
autograph after the movie is over.
Fis for film noir, which also happens to be my favorite noun
next to "Scorsese." The fact that noir can also be used as an
adjective makes it even more appealing. Often used to refer

to hard-boiled black-and-white (im)morality movies of
post-WWII America. lust say "I really enjoyed the noirish
subtext of the film," and watch everyone nod their heads vig
orously and try to back you up.
Gis for the Golden Gate Awards, which recognize excellence
and innovation in short films, documentaries, video and
television production. Basically, the kind of stuff that
should, but might not make your local multiplex — or after
this weekend, Sunday Flicks.
His for I low Can I Get To Meet Victoria Abril? A few Amer
icans might recognize her from Barry Levinson's latest
bomb, "Jimmy Hollywood." But the more savvy know her
as the bombshell in such wacky Pedro Almodovar films as
"Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown" and"Tie Me
Up! Tie Me Down!" One of the few actresses whose ability far
outsrips her considerable looks, she will be seen next in
Almodovar's "Kika" and Levinson's "Disclosure.
I is for international, as in the scope ol the festival. Where else
can you see films from Ireland and India in the same day?
J is for journalists, the vultures who will be circling over the
festival, trying to weasel interviews out of any hapless
actor/writer/director that crosses their path.
His for killing. I don't advocate it, hut many of the best
screenings are already sold-out. Instead, I recommend
that you study either the Vulcan Death grip, the dreaded
sleeper hold or a sharp uppercut. Remember, the only thing
standing between you and an Urdu film dubbed in German
with Cyrillic subtitles is a warm body and a couple of Cali
fornia statutes.
Lis for lucky. As in the lucky few who got to see the "Kika"
screening at which Almodovar himself spoke for a mere
hour and a half. As in the lucky few who might get to par
take of similar directorial indulgence at Lee's "Crooklyn"
screening.
Mis tor "Mod Fuck Explosion." San Francisco director Jon
Moritsugu dishes out more neo-punk-post-modern teen
angst for our era. Two teens — called London and M- lb
— live in a crazy world that I guess bears resemblance to our
own Bay Area. Expect violence, absurdity, punk rock and two
scoops of nihilism. I lave a nice day.
Nis for "Nina Takes a Lover." San Francisco director Alan la
cobs crafted this first film, a Sundance Film Festival winner,
which bodes well for his career. We meet Nina — the fiery
sister of Andie MacDowell in "Sex, Lies and Videotape" — a
lonely San Francisco wife who seems bored. So begins a series of
twistsand turns down the muddied road of affairs, adultery and
getting-to-know-yous. Not for the "Lethal Weapon" crowd.
Ois for Steven Okazaki. "Living on Tokyo Time" was a well
received flick by this Oscar-winning director, and his cur
rent film, " The Lisa Theory," has been highly applauded so
far. Here again, we meet twenty-something San Francisco
musicians trying to maintain girlfriends, meaningful lives
and relationships in these ironic times. Featuring local San
Francisco bands and the glorious Winona Ryder as — guess
what — an object of lust, the film centers on trying to keep
fragile love alive in this hypercool world.
Pis for " I he Puppet master." A Taiwanese film based on an
autobiography of one of Taiwan's greatest artists, "The
Puppetmaster" is a history lesson as well as the story of one
mans rise to glory in a country growing by spurts and fits it
self. Awarded the Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival, the
flick has been showered with glowing reviews about its
unique blend of drama with talk-to-the-camera style.
Ois for Qatar, which is a nice place to visit but doesn't have
any films this year at the film festival.

We've got two words for you. Film festival.
That's right. The 37th annual San Fran
cisco Film Festival is happening as we
speak. 209 films. 50 countries. 29 languages.
60,000-plus in attendance. In other words:
big, big, big.
You're probably thinking that film festivals
are events that other people attend. Visions of
Gerard Depardieu, David Lynch or Sharon
Stone strolling across the Croisette in the
Cannes summer heat are no doubt dancing
through your head. Not true.
Film festivals — they're not just for stars
anymore.
And that's doubly true of the San Francis
co Film Festival. Founded in 1957, it is the
oldest film festival in the Western Hemi
sphere. It is presented each year by the non
profit San Francisco Film Society and widely
considered to be one of the world's best.
What's more, the festival reaches beyond
its San Francisco locations — the AMC Kabu
ki 8 Theatres and the Castro — to the Pacific
Film Archive in Berkeley and the Landmark
Palo Alto Square Theatre in Palo Alto.
But enough bare facts. You're convinced,
you want to go — but you're a little nervous.
It's your first film festival and you don't know
a gaffer (electrician) from a grip (dolly-push
er). Or which Coen brother produces (Joel),
which one directs (Ethan) and which one
writes (both).
No fear.
The elves at Intermission have kindly pre
pared an A to Z guide to festival-going — tips,
tricks and the technical language that you'll
need to come off like a seasoned film fanatic.

His for Akira Kurosawa, a major deity not only in his home
land of Japan, but around the world. He burst onto the in
ternational filmmaking scene with "Rashomon," a bravu
ra meditation on truth and trust in a world without honor.
His famed and oft-remade samurai films ("Yojimbo" and
"The Seven Samurai") cemented his reputation, as did his re
interpretations of Shakespeare's plays ("Macbeth" as

"Throne of Blood" and "King Lear" as "Ran") in Japaneseset
tings. The festival's Akira Kurosawa Award is given each year
to a filmmaker nearing the end of a rich career.
Bis for Bandian, the hero of Guinean director Cheik
Doukore's second film as director. "Le Ballon D'Or" stars
Aboubacar Sidiki Sumah as Bandian, a soccer-mad youth
whose life turns upside down when a French doctor gives him
a genuine leather soccer ball. Hence the title, "Golden Ball."
The ensuing events take him from the countryside of Guinea
to the big city and its grueling soccer season all the way to
Roissy, France — with many colorful encounters along the
way. Shot in an almost documentary style, Doukore's sopho
more effort promises the drama and comedy of "The Gods
Must Be Crazy" without any of that film's Western conde
scension.
Cis for the sold-out Closing Night Film, which this year hap
pens to be Spike Lee's latest effort, "Crooklyn." This repre
sents a homecoming of sorts for Lee, whose debut smash
"She's Gotta Have It" had its world premiere at the San Fran
cisco Film Festival. "Crooklyn" finds Lee working in a minor
key (compared to the operatic "Malcolm X"), with a semi-au
tobiographical tale of a schoolteacher and an unemployed
jazz musician trying to raise their five children in 1970s
Brooklyn, New York. Given Lee's prodigious crowd-pleasing
instincts and the en vogue-ness of all things '70s, "C" might
also stand for Crashing — as in get into that bad boy any way
you can.

DWho better for D
than Gerard Depar
dieu, the man who
embodies French cine
ma. At the ripe old age
of 45, he has already
made nearly 80 movies.
From"The Return of
Martin Guerre" to Jean-
Luc Godard's latest,
"Helas Pour Moi," De
pardieu continues to
redfine the word "pro
lific." For his numerous
and important contribu

tions to film history, he is being given the Piper-Heidseck
Award, which recognizes "independence, courage, risk-tak
ing and the avoidance of the conventional."

Eis for elite, as in the people you might he sitting next to at
any one of the screenings you'll be attending. If you recog
nize someone famous, keep your cool and ask them for an
autograph after the movie is over.
Fis for film noir, which also happens to be my favorite noun
next to "Scorsese." The fact that noir can also be used as an
adjective makes it even more appealing. Often used to refer

to hard-boiled black-and-white (im)morality movies of
post-WWII America. lust say "I really enjoyed the noirish
subtext of the film," and watch everyone nod their heads vig
orously and try to back you up.
Gis for the Golden Gate Awards, which recognize excellence
and innovation in short films, documentaries, video and
television production. Basically, the kind of stuff that
should, but might not make your local multiplex — or after
this weekend, Sunday Flicks.
His for I low Can I Get To Meet Victoria Abril? A few Amer
icans might recognize her from Barry Levinson's latest
bomb, "Jimmy Hollywood." But the more savvy know her
as the bombshell in such wacky Pedro Almodovar films as
"Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown" and"Tie Me
Up! Tie Me Down!" One of the few actresses whose ability far
outsrips her considerable looks, she will be seen next in
Almodovar's "Kika" and Levinson's "Disclosure.
I is for international, as in the scope ol the festival. Where else
can you see films from Ireland and India in the same day?
J is for journalists, the vultures who will be circling over the
festival, trying to weasel interviews out of any hapless
actor/writer/director that crosses their path.
His for killing. I don't advocate it, hut many of the best
screenings are already sold-out. Instead, I recommend
that you study either the Vulcan Death grip, the dreaded
sleeper hold or a sharp uppercut. Remember, the only thing
standing between you and an Urdu film dubbed in German
with Cyrillic subtitles is a warm body and a couple of Cali
fornia statutes.
Lis for lucky. As in the lucky few who got to see the "Kika"
screening at which Almodovar himself spoke for a mere
hour and a half. As in the lucky few who might get to par
take of similar directorial indulgence at Lee's "Crooklyn"
screening.
Mis tor "Mod Fuck Explosion." San Francisco director Jon
Moritsugu dishes out more neo-punk-post-modern teen
angst for our era. Two teens — called London and M- lb
— live in a crazy world that I guess bears resemblance to our
own Bay Area. Expect violence, absurdity, punk rock and two
