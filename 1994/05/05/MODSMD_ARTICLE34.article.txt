# San Francisco in Palo Alto: Film Festival screenings at Palo Alto Square
## 
### Arnold Pan 
Ris for Molly Ringwald. Remember "Sixteen Candles,"
"Fresh Horses," "Pretty in Pink?" Apparently, Molly is
alive, because she plays an investigative reporter for a
tabloid newspaper in a short film that precedes "River of
Grass" (which also begins with an 'R'). A funny flick, "River
of Grass" features Cory, a young housewife who decides to
dump her lard-ass husband, three kids and house in Broward
County, Fla. She meets up with an appealing drifter in a local
bar, then goes on the lam as someone's pistol misfires.

Sis for "Salvation," a documentary that describes the plight
of women in traditional Indian society. Winner of a spe
cial jury award, the film examines the lives of several Ben
gali women. Said to achieve "lh.it all-too-rare balance be
tween advocacy and cinema," the film, follows the minute de
tails ol women forced into positions of servitude and finding
their only solace in simple religious devotion.
Tis for " Totally Fucked Up." Gregg Araki, the young, angry
Japanese-American LA. filmmaker who produced the tout
ed "The Living End," pulls no punches in his next project,
which he describes as "a kinda twisted cross between avant
garde experimental cinema and a queer John Hughes flick."
I he film follows six gay teenagers and their evolving relation
ships and loves, and though most of you have probably given
up on the film by this point, Araki looks like he'll be holding
onto his place as one of the most outspoken and original mem
bers of the up-and-coming generation of filmmakers.
Uis for Uruguay, which contributed no films to this year's
festival.
Vis for "Virtual Love." The plot runs something like this:
woman loves virtual-reality programmer. Plausible so far.
Woman gets virtual-reality programmer by fashioning
some sexy version of herself on the internet, or whatever
computer medium she's using.
Wis for "What Happened Was." Winner of the Grand lury
and screenplay prizes at the Sundance 112 ilm Festival, the
film features Jackie, a secretary in a New York law firm,
preparing for a dinner date with a paralegal co-worker
(played by Tom Noonan, the director). Considered to be a
true-to-life examination of pre-, intra- and post-date anxiety,
mistakes and excitement, the film becomes an unburdening
of secrets that catches both parties off guard.
If is for "Avenue X." The film, a short that won best short narra-
Itive at the film festival, is one of a collection that features,
flamong other things, Allen Ginsberg, science fiction comedy,
and haiku. The movie delves into the life of a Coney Island board
walk, especially its more odd and disturbing happenings during
the off-season. Tailored for those with short-attention spans.

Vis tor Ihe Year of the Dog." Having nothing to do with
"Lassie," the Russian film "The Year of the Dog" features
Sergei, a recently released prisoner, who meets up with
and begins a relationship with a shy woman named Vera.
Sergei returns to his criminal ways and runs off with his new
girlfriend to escape the law, but violence and horror follow.
Winner of the Silver Bear at the Berlin Film Festival, the film
is another "couple on the lam" story that addresses political
and social issues along with the fates of its characters.
