# Bring back the C
## 'With Honors' barely passes with college cheese 
### 
Imagine this movie scenario: An older man
with a flamboyant personality declines into a
lonely and depressing condition. A younger
man, poor but ambitious, is rising in acade
mics. By chance they meet and form a father
son bond as the older man teaches the younger
man about the important things in life.
Great, isn't it? This is the bare-bones plot
of "With Honors," a new movie starring Joe
Pesci and Brendan Fraser. Coincidentally it
was also the plot of "Scent of a Woman," the
Oscar vehicle piloted by Al Pacino last year.
Consider the following comparison of the
main characters played by Pesci and Pacino:
"Scent of a Woman" stars Pacino, a well
known, respected actor who carries the film.
"With Honors" stars Academy Award winner
Pesci who is expected to carry the film. Paci
no plays a retired military man. Pesci plays an
former merchant marine. Pacino gets a
standing ovation from a posh New England
prep school. Pesci gets a standing ovation
from an elite New England University. Paci
no's character is blind. Pesci's character has
asbestos poisoning. Pacino frequently punc
tuates his conversations with a loud "Hoo-
Wah!" Pesci likes to say "Boy-o-boy!" a lot.
You get the idea. "With Honors" is essen
tially a re-vamped "Scent of a Woman," with a
problem of the week (homelessness) and
slicker sound track so it can be sold to the col
lege crowd.
At the start of the movie Monty Kessler
(Fraser) is set to graduate from Harvard summa
cum laude. But his hard drive crashes, leaving
him with only a draft of this senior honors the

sis. The draft falls into the hands of Simon
Wilder (Pesci), a well-read homeless man.
Simon strikes a deal with Monty. He offers to re
turn one page of the draft for every accommo
dation Monty grants him. As expected, Simon
befriends Monty and his roommates (Moira
Kelly, Patrick Dempsey and Josh Hamilton) and
everyone's life changes as a result.
Director Alek Keshishian ("Truth or
Dare") presents the obvious comic element
and then proceeds to beat it to death. 1 he bit
ter irony of a homeless population living
alongside the future leaders of our society is
pushed aside for the usual fish-out-of-water
jokes. See Simon learn library etiquette.
Laugh as Simon deals with bathing and per
sonal hygiene. Cheer as Simon cuts down a
pompous Nobel laureate (Gore Vidal).
In all fairness, "With Honors" is not a ter
rible movie. Pesci turns in a good perfor
mance; he is certainly believable as a grungy
homeless guy. Fraser and the supporting cast,
except Dempsey as the annoying Bohemian
radio-disc jockey cool-guy, are decent.
The most compelling moments in the film
occur when Simon criticizes Monty's inabili
ty to see him as a human or confronts his past
mistakes. Such scenes hint at great possibili
ties that were sacrificed for the sake of cute
ness. In the end, the problem of Simon's
homelessness is avoided. He is picked up and
discarded once his usefulness is over. Home
less people are great, the film seems to say —
as long as they do something for you and go
away before they become a nuisance.
