# The 						Favor
## screens 
### 
Kathy, constantly slipping into sordid
flights of fancy, just can't stop fantasizing
about her high school sweetheart, Tom.
Granted, they never did do the horizontal
hula. Granted, she has no idea what he's like
now. Nevertheless, in "The Favor," this
housewife can't stop lusting after her Fabio
esque figment. These frequent fantasies
begin to diminish the appeal of her marriage
to hokey-but-lovable Peter. Eager to end
these racy reveries and to save her 15-year
marriage, she seeks her swinging-single best
friend for help:
"I can't sleep with him but you can. I am
just asking you a simple favor."
Her best friend, Emily, competes the mis
sion with ease. Without hesitation, she bumps
and grinds with Kathy's high honey, who turns
out to be a to-drool-for Adonis. However, in-

stead of extinguish
ing Kathy's infatua
tion with Tom,
Emily's "favor"
sparks a greater ob
session in Kathy for
the man. Meanwhile,
Emily is unsure of
her relationship with
Elliot, an artist 10
years her junior.
Emily's fear of com
mitment with Elliot
gets complicated
when she learns she

is pregnant.
Then the agonizing complications kick in.
Kathy tells Elliot that Emily is carrying his
baby, despite her vow of secrecy. Suspicious
of his wife's latest flip in behavior, Peter
thinks his wife is having an affair with Elliot.
Discovering that Kathy broke her vow of se
crecy, Emily angrily declares that the baby's
father is Tom. Kathy yearns to get even with
Emily and then flies to Denver to get "ac
quainted" with Tom. Elliot leaves with her
... blah blah blah. It's a mess.
After years of being primed to "Bosom
Buddies" and "Three's Company" endings,
the audience is able to pick up the tangled
ball of plot lines and wind it into a tidy spool
well before the film's characters do.
Kathy, played by Harley lane Kozak, re
minded me of an overly dramatic mom from
an All detergent commercial. Bill Pullman
does a good job playing the harmonica
blowin' dad who's always a step behind.
However, casting Brad Pitt as Elliot, a sensi
tive artist-type, must be some sort of media
prank. On the other hand, Elizabeth McGov
ern is believable as an independent and se
ductive art dealer. In fact, one of the more
memorable moments of the movie occurs
during a child's birthday party when the
hired clown bends a balloon in the shape of
male genitalia and hands it to McGovern,
who fondles it in disbelief.
"The Favor" is slow and predictable, but it
has its moments. If you don't mind parting
with seven bucks to see a filmed interpreta
tion of more Jack Tripper et al exploits, enjoy.
