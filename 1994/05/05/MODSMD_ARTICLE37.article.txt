# No Escape
## 
### 
"It is the year 2022 ..." Wait. Before you
write off "No Escape" as just another one of
those futuristic flicks, realize it is a movie
about the future but with a twist — a barbaric
twist. Starring Ray Liotta of "Goodfellas," "No
Escape" is an interesting but unexceptional
thriller about one man's experience with the
unique prison system of the 21st century.
Liotta plays Robbins, a violent criminal
tagged as "aversive to authority." After irritat
ing the evil warden (Michael Lerner), he is
dropped by helicopter on a remote island, re
ferred to unlovingly as Absolom. This in
escapable "prison" has no walls, locks or bars
but something worse — the Outsiders.
Savages with creatively colored faces and
killing habits to match, the Outsiders quickly
gather any inmate abandoned on the island —
including Robbins. Once he arrives at the filthy
dwelling of the barbarians, he meets their
leader, Marek. Stuart Wilson is amusing as the
crude head honcho who resembles a cross be
tween Kevin Costner and a Klingon Warrior
with a scar on his forehead that rivals Kimber
ly's from "Melrose Place" in makeup wizardry.
Robbins proceeds to make a fool out of
Marek before escaping, avoiding "Raiders of
the Lost Ark"-esque booby traps. Robbins
ends up in another camp inhabited by peace
ful ex-cons called the Insiders.
We learn the Insiders consider themselves
to be free in their commune and spend much
of their time defending against the Outsiders
incessant attacks. Robbins is called on to help

the group despite desperately wanting to get
off the island.
I had heard that the movie was supposed
to be disturbingly gory. In fact, some of the
killings elicited laughter from the audience.
In one, you don't even realize that a man has
been decapitated because the slice was so per
fect until his head slides off his shoulders. In
another, an arrow pierces not one, but two
necks in a row, causing the victims to fall in
perfect unison.
While "No Escape" is definitely entertain
ing, fast paced, and well filmed, it suffers
from lack of depth. We never truly come to
understand why Robbins acts in such an in
consistent manner — at times he is conscien
tious and at others he is brutal and selfish. As
the movie centers on action — not words —
it produces a shallow quality.
And don't be disappointed if the movie
lacks a key component — sex. "No Escape"
casts no females and the possibility of homo
sexuality is never addressed.
— Glynnis Roberts



= Don't even think about
missing this.


= If you have money to burn,
this is for you.


= Even a freebie is a waste of
time.
