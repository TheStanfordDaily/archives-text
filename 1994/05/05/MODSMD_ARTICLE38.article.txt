## Henry Rollins throws his 'Weight' around 
### 
Since the 1992 release of "The End of Si
lence," the Rollins Band's last album, Henry
Rollins has posed in ads for the Cap; written
for Spin, Details and Melody Maker; ap
peared in the movie The Chase with Charlie
Sheen; toured with bands including the Red
Hot Chili Peppers, the Beastie Boys, Pearl
Jam and Cypress Hill; written three books;
and put out a spoken-word album. After this
much exposure, you find yourself wondering
ii Rollins, who's been angry since his earliest
days singing for seminal California punkers
black Flag, might have mellowed out, even
just a little.
No such luck. Although Rollins actually
sings on this album (for a few bars on "Fool,"
the second track), "Weight" is dominated by
the same kind of all-out barrage that charac
terized "The Fnd of Silence." His columns
and spoken-word performances may high
light a lighter side of his character, but when
he's with his band, Rollins is, to put it lightly,
an angry guy. "I'm a bomb that I can't defuse,
a gun I can't unload," he sings in "Vol. 4."
"Weight" hits like a bomb, dissecting the
hypocrisy, weakness, and hatred Rollins feels
around him with an explosive force.
To hear Rollins tell it, modern society is an
incredibly destructive force, burying you in
weakness and failure until you can't take it
anymore, until you explode. "You reached
out / You got burned / Made tough by the
lessons you learned," he sings in "Alien Blue
print." Rollins' music is his attempt to escape
this, to take the pain and sadness inflicted on
him by modern society and turn it around in
an effort to fight back. "When you start to
doubt yourself / The real world will eat you
alive," he sings in "Shine."
Rollins attacks insecurities, tearing them
apart and examining them piece by piece, re
vealing the hatred and lies that created them.

He also turns his
sights on those who
he feels contribute to
society's evil, attack
ing gun-toting gang
stas and the rappers
who encourage them
in the quasi-rap
number "Civilized."
In addition he chas
tises the radical femi
nists who consider all
men a "rapist in wait
ing" in "Wrong Man."
Rollins by no
means believes he is
free of the demons he
describes in his lis
teners. Indeed, songs
like "Vol. 4," and
"Tired," where he
says "I'm so tired of
looking inside myself
/ Trying to find
something," suggest
that his unrelenting
anger sometimes
threatens to destroy
him.
The album is ded-

icatcd to Joe Cole, Rollins' best friend who
was murdered in front of him in 1991, and
Rollins makes it clear Cole's death still haunts
him, still provides the motivation that leads
him in his all-out assault on society's flaws.
"Vol. 4," which includes the lines "I used to
have problems / 1 used to live a lie / But then
1 saw the sidewalk bleed and I watched his
mother cry," expresses this fury most explic
itly, explaining the all-consuming obsession
that guides Rollins' lyrics.
While the focus of "Weight" is definitely

on the lyrics, the band, pumped up by the ad
dition of avant-jazz bassist Melvin Gibbs
provides a compelling backup for Rollins
drill-sergeant yell. Songs like "Liar" drop intc
a mellow guitar-driven shuffle, only to ex
plode suddenly into a full-blown sonic as
sault. The Rollins Hand covers large musical
territory, blending aspects of hardcore, jazz,
punk, hip hop and funk into a cohesive,
powerful whole.
"Weight" is not a trip for the faint-heart
ed. To some, Rollins' perpetual anger and un

relenting forcefulness may grow monoto
nous, and variety has certainly never been
one of the Rollins Band's greatest attributes.
But "Weight" is a consistent, cohesive, and
impressive work. Rollins' perpetual anger
transforms his music into an exorcism, un
covering feelings that are at once extremely
personal and familiar to everyone. Listening
to a Rollins Band album is a cleansing, in
tense experience. Let's hope he never mel
lows out.

Time and success haven't mellowed Henry Rollins out. The Rollins Band's latest, "Weight," proves to be just
as intense as his earlier work.
