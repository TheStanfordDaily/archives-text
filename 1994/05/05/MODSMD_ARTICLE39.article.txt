# "Selected Ambient Works, Volume II" Aphex Twin
## spins 
### 
For those unfamiliar with the rave scene,
Aphex Twin, also known as Polygon Window,
AFX and The Dice Man, is one of tcchno and
ambient music's most visionary geniuses.
Only a few years older than us students, the
man behind Aphex I'win, Richard I). James,
has already written hundreds of composi
tions. He's got the technical know-how to
wire his own keyboards and modify existing
ones to suit his needs. And his song names arc

cool, like "Hedphe
lym" and "Quino
phec." Sigh, Aphex
Twin — who I've
watchcd for the past
two years rise from
obscurity to the big
label star he is now.
His new double-
CD release, "Selected
Ambient Works, Vol
ume II," is very slick-

ly done. The song titles aren't even words;
they're pie charts coupled with amber-tinted
closeups of metal gratings, rock formations
and other indiscernible objects. Like the
backs of World Magazine from childhood
days. And the music? Brilliant, but not on a
normal level. Let me explain.
If you're looking forward to putting this
album in the CL) player and basking in its
melodic and rhythmic ingenuity, you'll be
sorely disappointed.
The songs are quiet and subtle, sometimes
devoid of a single identifiable note. They
float in the back of the mind, almost on the
subconscious level. It's music you don't in
gest directly; instead, you let it seep into the
air, melt into your surroundings and slowly
fuse with your senses without becoming
aware of it. You have to appreciate it on its
own level: as ambient music. And when that
happens, this album becomes an incredible
tour of soundscapes — a worm tunnel deep
in the core of lapetus. An abandoned cave
where Troglodytes used to roam. A mystical
lake that glows green by the moonlight.
Some call this music "weird mood inducing
stuff." I call it the soundtrack of dreams.
