# A 						long history of 'frustration' motivates students to strike

### Beth Berselli Staff writer 
Members of Stanford's Chi
cano/Latino community say that
a long history of disrespect and
inaction on the part of the ad
ministration motivated them to
stage a protest and begin a
hunger strike in the Main Quad
yesterday.
"It came out of the frustration
that people have experienced
over the course of several years,"
said doctoral student Francisca
James Hernandez, a spokesper
son for the protesters.

The recent layoff of a high
ranking Chicana administrator
was "the spark that initiated the
protest," Hernandez said. Cecilia
Burciaga — an associate dean of
Student Affairs and resident fel
low at Casa Zapata — was laid off
last month due to budget cuts.
"We wanted to do something
that would bring the administra
tion to the table," Hernandez
said. "We demand their attention
and action to these issues."
This year has been character
ized by a tense relationship be-

tween the administration and the
Chicano/Latino community, with
the two groups battling over
issues ranging from Webb Ilanch
to budget cuts.
Community members say they
also have sensed disrespect from
other students, citing the loss of
their special fee in the ASSU Gen
eral Election and an incident at last
Sunday's Flicks as examples. The
showing of a video short titled "No
Grapes," about the plight of agri
cultural workers, elicited laughter
and such comments as "Yes, pesti
cides!" and "Go home, beaners!"
Organizers say the Flicks inci
dent had no effect on their deci
sion to hold a protest. "The deci
sion was already made," senior
Gabi Cervantes said.
The idea for the demonstration
was hatched several weeks ago. Cer
vantes said leaders of MEChA, a
Chicano/Latino student group,
decided there were issues that still
needed to be addressed even though
community members had spoken
with Provost Condoleezza Rice and
other administrators several times.
A secret committee of MEChA
leaders decided on a hunger
strike, planned the logistics and
then presented the plan to the
rest of MEChA for vote Sunday
night, Cervantes said.
Students chose the Quad as the
site for the protest because of its
prime location. "People have to go
around us to go about their busi
ness. Students have to see us,
tourists have to go around us to
take pictures of | Memorial
ChurchJ," Cervantes said.
Protesters cited the adminis
tration's repeated use of "words,
no action" as a reason for the
protest. "This goes beyond Cecil
ia's layoff. There are a lot of issues
of disrespect and lack of account

ability," senior Jorge Solis said.
The clash over budget cuts this
year, when administrators
refused to rule out slashing fund
ing to the ethnic centers, fueled
the confrontational atmosphere
— even though the centers were
eventually left untouched.
Concerned about funding, eth
nic center leaders met with
administrators several times and
wrote a report justifying their
existence. The Students of Color
Coalition also sponsored a forum
and White Plaza rally in January.
After Burciaga was laid off at
the end of March, members of the
Chicano/Latino community staged
a protest at the Minority Admit
Weekend — an orientation for
prospective graduate students.
The demonstration served a dual
purpose — to protest Burciaga's
layoff and to stress the need for
more minority graduate students.
Following the event at Branner
Hall, several protesters headed to
the Quad where they confronted

University President Gerhard
Casper over issues ranging from
the need for a commitment to
Asian American studies to a lack of
Native American faculty members
as well as Burciaga's layoff. The
tense hour-and-a-half long interac
tion led to few concrete solutions.
Several weeks later members of
the community again met with
Rice about losing Burciaga. The
meeting did not have the desired
result, Cervantes said.
"We've been in constant commu
nication — over the strategic plan,
budget cuts to centers. It's been an
ongoing process and frankly, it's
been getting tiresome," she said.
Another source of dispute has
been Webb Ranch — a 237-acre veg
etable and berry farm the Universi
ty has leased to the Webb family
since 1922. In past years, students
have repeatedly urged the Universi
ty to intervene in the ranch's
affairs, including demanding better
living conditions for the workers.
At an ASSU Senate meeting last
October, students criticized
Casper's hands-off stance toward
the ranch. Carrying signs reading,
"Wake up and smell the injustice"
and "We are responsible for the
Webb Ranch workers," students
urged Casper to investigate the
workers' conditions.
The most recent demonstration
concerning multicultural issues
occurred last May, when about 150
protesters participated in a "teach
in," calling for the administration to
listen to student input and renew its
commitment to multiculturalism.
The last student protest of the
magnitude of yesterday's event was
the 1989 take-over of former Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy's
office, said Assoc. Dean of Humani
ties and Sciences A 1 Camarillo.
Students barricaded the presi
dent's office for over nine hours,
demanding an immediate meeting
with him to discuss multicultural
issues. About 50 protesters were
arrested.
