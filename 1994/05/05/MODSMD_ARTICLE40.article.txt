# "The Crow" soundtrack various artists
## 
### 
It remains to be seen whether the movie
"The Crow," to be released this Friday the
13th, will be plagued by the same bad luck
that followed its star, the late Brandon L ee.
One thing is certain, though: the soundtrack,
albeit dark in nature, is a sure thing. What
else would you expect from a lineup featur
ing the Cure, Stone Temple Pilots, Nine Inch
Nails, Rage Against the Machine, Violent
Femmes, Rollins Band and Helmet?
A quick glance at the titles of a few songs
— "Burn," "Big Empty," "Dead Souls,"
"Darkness" and "Ghostrider" — hardly
evokes images of raindrops on roses. Rather,
the titles hint at the main themes of the
soundtrack — gloom, death, spirits and
more gloom. Twelve of the 14 tracks are su
perbly haunting.
The opening song, "Burn" by the Cure,
sets the tone for the entire soundtrack with
its reverberating drums and depressing
lyrics, similar to those on the Cure's release
"Disintegration." "Big Empty" is an unusual

but felicitous mix of background dinner
music and the Stone Temple Pilots' "sound"
(whatever that is— Pearl lam/Nirvana/Alice
in Chains?).
With his usual checriness, Trent Reznor
(of Nine Inch Nails) covers an old Joy Divi
sion song, appropriately titled "Dead Souls."
"Darkness" by Rage Against the Machine
combines a punchy rhythm with bitter lyrics
about the greed of white men — "they say
we'll kill them off / take their land / and go
there for vacation."
Surprisingly, two of the best tracks on
"The Crow" are not products of big names.
The mesmerizing basslinc of "Golgotha
Tenement Blues" by Machines of Loving
Grace compares to Nine Inch Nails. "Slip
Slide Melting" by For Love Not Lisa is
unique and upbeat, except for the long
minute where singer Mike Lewis breaks into
a pathetic, falsely angst-ridden Bryan
Adams-esque wailing (Ohhh .. . I'd die for
you). Oh Please! But hey, that's the beauty
of fast forward.
The last two tracks aside, "The Crow" de
livers a compilation of marvelous melan
choly.
