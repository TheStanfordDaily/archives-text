# Palo Alto pizza: part one Places to avoid in the Palo Alto pizza wonderland
## 
### 
The pizza in California, for the
most part, sucks. Sorry, that's just
the way it is. But let's face facts;
we're in California, not New 1 laven
(thank goodness). And even if we
were to have a Pepe's pie shipped
out here from Wooster Street, it
would probably take a few days and
it's just not the same without the
hour wait, without the cranky,
hunchbacked waitress, without a
Foxon Park Creme Soda to wash it
down.
However, the other option, ab
stinence, is completely out of the
question. So what is the enlight
ened pizza eater who has tasted the
sweet nectar of Pepe's to do? Simple
— just look at everything relatively,
forget New Haven ever existed, pre
tend you actually grew up in Cali-

fornia, that
your whole
life has been

spent in
this

Skinner box
of good

pizza de
privation,
and enter
your own
little virtu
al reality:
the Califor-

nia Pizza
Zone.

Now I'm
sure that many midwesterners, es
pecially those in the 300-mile "I'm
from Chicago" radius, are now cry
ing foul. It's true, to this point I've

not mentioned the

pizza from
that land
locked city.

What about
Chicago

pizza?
I've had it. It's
nice.

But I di
gress. To be
r -i r •

perfectly fair,
I will say

that you
could be

braphic by Rate bagarin jp many

worse
places than the California Pizza
Zone. For example, you could be in
the Montana Pizza Zone, or worse,
the Nebraska Pizza Zone.

This week, I'll give
you the low-down on
the pizza joints you
can safely avoid.
Domino's (sadly,
everywhere)

Anything is better than this
cardboard-wrapped cardboard. So
why is Domino's so popular? It
makes cheap pizza. It cuts costs
with cheap ingredients, unskilled
labor and mass production, and
then preys on thrifty, hungry, un
enlightened pizza eaters. This prac
tice puts decent locally owned pizza
joints throughout the country out
of business. Simple dog-eat-dog
capitalism.
Pizza a Go-Go (335 University Av

enue, Palo Alto)
Of the pizzas that I did try, Go-
Go's is clearly the worst. Soggy
crust, bland sauce, and everything
on top of the sauce comes in pellets
— cheese pellets, sausage pellets,
rabbit pellets. That's why Go-Go's
has so many coupons in the direc
tory. It has to bribe you to eat its
pizza.
Round Table (263 University Av
enue, Palo Alto)
While the decor at Round Table


is almost as heinous as Go-Go's,
the pizza is only marginally better.
And it's more expensive. Skip it.
Ramona's (541 Ramona Street,
Palo Alto)
Now we finally move this review
into the non-mass produced
realm. Ramona's has a wide selec
tion of very interesting fresh top
pings that especially appeal to my

vegetarian friend. Nonetheless, I
have always been left a little disap
pointed by Ramona's.
The doughy crust is pleasant,
but not spectacular. Same for the
sauce. The toppings are spread
with wild abandon until they
cover the pie; little thought given
to the subtlety of flavor or simple
aesthetics. Also, stay away from
the mushrooms; they're dry and
flavorless. Overall, Ramona's is
like its pizza: pleasant, enjoyable
and reasonably priced, but just
not spectacular. ■
