Backßeat
"Backßeat" is a Beatle movie even
the most fickle fan will enjoy. De
spite a few historical inaccuracies,
director lain Softley does an ad
mirable job of reconstructing the
band's early days in Hamburg when
the Fab Four were the Fab Five. Of
note are the live music scenes
which capture what it must have
been like to see the Beatles before
they got big. R
Bad Girls
The title says it all: "Bad Girls" re
ally is bad. Despite vaunting itself
as the first female-centered fron
tier shoot 'em up, director
Jonathan Kaplan does nothing
more than crib scenes from clas
sic Westerns and fill the movie
with aimless action instead of plot
or relevant issues. So don't let it's
claim to the top spot at the box of
fice fool you— after all, "Ace Ven
tura" was there for multiple
weeks. R
Belle Epoque
In the tradition of critically-ac
claimed, innocuous, little-known
European movies comes Spanish
director Fernando Trueba's
"Belle Epoque." But don't let the

hype of a Best Foreign Film Oscar
fool you: the story of four farmer's
daughters and a Spanish army
deserter serves up sizzling sex
scenes but little historical or polit
ical content. In essence, 1993's
winner proves to be nothing more
than adressed-up Penthouse
Forum letter. R
Four Weddings and a Funeral
"Four Weddings and a Funeral" ac
tually lives up to the hype as a
crowd-pleasing comedy. While it
may not explore the deep meaning
of life, the flick serves up breezy fun
with inspired comedy. The delightful
cast, featuring Andie MacDowell
and the omnipresent Hugh Grant,
does a good job of moving the
movie along R
The House of the Spirits
In a poor imitation of a fantastic, fan
tastical novel, an über-cast of Jere
my Irons, Glenn Close, Winona
Ryder and Meryl Streep can't seem
to capture any of the sentiment of
the original text, based on author Is
abelle Allende's own life and up
bringing in Chile. It's a long, some
what painful and tragic corruption of
the novel; save your $7 and buy the
book! R

The Hudsucker Proxy
The Coen brother duo who brought
you the cult hits "Raising Arizona"
and "Barton Fink" are back with a
slightly less engaging, slightly more
corny flick. A mailroom employee of
a big toy company gets promoted to
the top when the boss dies, but his
invention of the hula-hoop proves
too promising for the main manipu
lator who wants Hudsucker Indus
tries to fail. But even though it's a
cold, simple morality tale, it's got
Tim Robbins and Paul Newman, so
it can't be all bad. PG
Major League II
If you're looking for a little comedy
with your baseball fun, you won't
find it in "Major League II." The se
guel proves to be a boring rehash
ing of the original, just on a slightly
larger scale: the hapless Cleveland
Indians win an American League
pennant rather than a mere division
championship. Just about nothing
in the flick works, except maybe Bob
Uecker's reprisal of a his quick-wit
ted commentator role — if that's re
ally a plus. PG
The Paper
As they say in the newspaper biz,
"The Paper" is Page One material.

Director Ron Howard ably guides a
star-studded cast through a day at
the presses to realistic lengths.
And while some of it may seem
melodramatic or overacted, the
theatrics of the newsroom staff at
the fictitious New York Sun play
true to life. R
Serial Mom
Kathleen Turner is evidently having
fun playing the part of a psycho
everything-is-not-dandy-a-la-Nor-
man-Rockwell Serial Mom in this
new, well-endowed John Waters
flick. It's a parody of suburban
America (typical Waters fare) with an
added bonus of a "Basic Instinct"
style court room gag. While not alto
gether a phenomenal work, it's
worth seeing. R
Threesome
Just as "Reality Bites" ends its run at
the theaters, 'Threesome" comes
along to fill that college movie void.
The '90s-style love triangle which
the movie revolves around does ex
plore timely issues, but, alas, falls
into some of the stereotypes it wish
es to break. Still, on the whole,
"Threesome" proves to be an enter
taining romp through ivory tower
wonderland. R

man-Rockwell Serial Mom in this
new, well-endowed John Waters
flick. It's a parody of suburban
America (typical Waters fare) with an
added bonus of a "Basic Instinct"
style court room gag. While not alto
gether a phenomenal work, it's
worth seeing. R
Threesome
Just as "Reality Bites" ends its run at
the theaters, 'Threesome" comes
along to fill that college movie void.
The '90s-style love triangle which
the movie revolves around does ex
plore timely issues, but, alas, falls
into some of the stereotypes it wish
es to break. Still, on the whole,
"Threesome" proves to be an enter
taining romp through ivory tower
wonderland. R
