### Linda Friedlieb Editorial staff 
A newly constructed economics
building lost its air of mystery and
gained a name yesterday when it
was dedicated to its previously
anonymous donor — Ralph Lan
dau of New York City and San
Francisco.
Landau, in conjunction with
his wife Claire, made a $5 mil
lion donation which kicked off
the drive for the building which
now stands on the corner of
Serra and Galvez streets, ac
cording to Economics Prof.
Gavin Wright.
The new Ralph Landau Center
for Economics and Policy Re
search cost $11 million and was
designed by the San Francisco

firm of Anshen and Allen. It will
hold both Stanford's Economics
Department and the Center for

'At Stanford, the
chemistry was right.
[Landau] felt at home.'
— Gavin Wright

Economic Policy Research.
According to Economics De
partment Chair David Starett,
there was no hidden reason be
hind the anonymity of the dona
tion. Landau just wanted to gen
erate "a little excitement," he
said.

A consulting professor of eco
nomics at Stanford and former
chairman of the Halcon SD
Group, Landau co-directs a re
search program on technology
and economic growth at Stan
ford's Center for Economic Policy
Research.
Landau, a chemical engineer
who studied at MIT and the Uni
versity of Pennsylvania, "really
has been around Stanford eco
nomics . . . for quite a number of
years," Wright said. "He made a
number of patents and his fortune
and then he retired early.
"At Stanford, the chemistry
was right," he added. Landau "felt
at home."
Landau is "concerned about
the country and long-term eco
nomic growth," said Wright, who
serves as director of the policy
center. "He wanted a place look
ing into the sort of issues that
interested him: What are the eco
nomic motives behind technologi
cal innovation?"

Starett said the building is a
blessing for the Economics
Department because "it puts us
all together in one place. Right
now we're all scattered."
"It brings us together and it
has an elegance to it which will
just make living a little more
pleasant," he said, pointing out
that the building is also close to
the Graduate School of Busi
ness and the Hoover Institu
tion.

Donald L. Lucas of Menlo
Park, an alumnus who also made
a large donation, was also hon
ored with the dedication of a con
ference center within the eco
nomics building.
Wright said the conference
center represented "a major
upgrade in our visibility" and will
bring a measured improvement
"in the kind of conferences we
hold and the kind of people we
draw."
