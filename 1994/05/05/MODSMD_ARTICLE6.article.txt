# Branner to create 50-ton sandcastle
## 
### Karen Heywood Staff writer 
In an effort to revive a tradition — and bring sum
mer to Stanford early -- Branner Hall is transforming
the Kimball parking lot into a 50-ton sandcastle.
The all-frosh dorm, which has been raising money
and constructing frames for the past month, began
work on the castle itself yesterday and plans to unveil
it tomorrow.
If all goes according to plan, the castle will be 12 feet
by 12 feet wide, stand 14 feet tall, and be "stacked like
a big wedding cake," said Emily Haynes, a resident as
sistant in Branner and the project's coordinator.
The idea originated in 1987, when former Branner
RA Wade McNary — who currently teaches in the Me
chanical Engineering Department — read an article
about Garry Kirk, founder of a group called Sand
sculptors International. McNary contacted Kirk, who
collaborated with him to bring the project to Branner
in both 1987 and 1988.
"I saw an old picture in [Resident Eellowl Kennell
[JacksonJ's office, and I just thought it would be a fun
group activity for spring quarter — so we decided to do
it," Havnes said.

The dorm received funding for the project through
grants from the ASSU Senate and Residential Educa
tion, as well as through contributions from Larkin
House and Kimball Hall, Haynes said. Branner pur
chased the 50 tons of sand for $798 and plans to donate
it to Stanford for campus sand volleyball courts when
the project is over.
Kimball residents have agreed to move their cars to
different lots while sandcastle construction is under
way, Haynes said, and the University issued special
parking permits for those residents. "IKimball has]
been very helpful," Jackson said. "They've moved their
cars, and have really been nice about the whole thing."
Said Branner RA Josh Golomb, "This time of year
things like Rush and the Draw have broken up some of
the dorm spirit. . . . [Sandcastle buildingl is the kind of
event that inspires dorm unity."
The physical work "is the hard part, but it really
makes you feel like part of thedorm," agreed freshman
resident Nancy Farghalli.
The castle will remain standing until next Monday.
"Hopefully a lot of people will come out and carve,"
Jackson said.
Said Haynes, "We're just hoping it doesn't rain on
Friday."
