# Lawyers feel cultural squeeze

### Miranda Doyle Editorial staff 
Encountering a world of opera, country clubs
and fancy eateries can shake the confidence of
minority students who join large law firms, a
panel of three Chicano/Latino alumni told a Law
School audience yesterday.
"The biggest obstacle you will face in a large
firm will not be open racism," said Armando Cas
tro, a 1992 Law School graduate. "You're going to
realize just how different your background is
from the people you work for and your clients."
Castro cited the case of a Harvard student who
"ended up ordering a corkage fee for lunch" —
the fee charged for serving wine brought in by the
patron — during an interview with a San Fran
cisco law firm.
But he urged minority lawyers not to "fall into
the trap" of worrying about an unfamiliarity with
ballet or corporate culture. "The social graces are
not a requirement for the job," he said. "It's nice
if you have them, but don't pretend to be someone
you're not."
Novice lawyers should develop their skills and
self-confidence, obtain a mentor and "nurture
your ethnicity," said '84 graduate David Madrid,
a partner in a large firm.
"The legal profession as a business is a confi
dence game," he said. "Your confidence is what is
going to carry you along."
Finding a mentor is "absolutely critical,"
according to Madrid. He advocated concentration
on writing, speaking and thinking skills as a

means for young lawyers to prove their value.
Firms will advance the careers of productive
employees "because it is in their selfish economic
interest to do so," he said.
But Madrid also warned of the downside of
striving to conform. "When you chase after those
skills as an articulator you may lose your accent,"
he said, and mimicking a mentor may mean
changing in response to subtle cues.
Pro bono work and commitments to charitable
organizations can be ways to "nurture diversity," he
added. These activities may threaten career
prospects unless lawyers are also boosting the firm's
earnings, Madrid said. "If you make money for
them, they'll do things for you. It's pure economics."
The third panelist, 1991 graduate Jose Macias,
agreed that while minority lawyers may have to
deal with the preconceptions of co-workers and
clients, the most difficult challenge is taming
"personal demons." "You have to show you
believe in yourself," he said.
Although many minority law school graduates
are subject to frantic courting from largely white
firms looking to diversify, Madrid painted a pes
simistic picture of the current situation for both
women and people of color.
Looking around a huge conference table during
a meeting recently, Madrid said, he realized that
"the only time there was a woman in the room was
when the CEO's secretary came in to serve coffee.
The reality is that it's not diversified out there."
The panel, which drew an audience of about
50, was sponsored by the Stanford Latino Law
Student Association in honor of Cinco de Mayo.
