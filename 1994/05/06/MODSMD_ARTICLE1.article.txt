Four hunger strikers entered their third day of
fasting today after negotiations between Chicano
community leaders and University administrators
ended in a standoff last night.
Activists received no concessions from the presi
dent and provost at a 75-minute meeting, said stu
dent negotiator Jorge Solis, and no further meetings
were planned.
"We've gone as far as we can go," Provost Con
doleezza Rice said after the session. "I hope people
will understand that we have done as much as we
can. We have to preserve University processes."

Hunger strikers and their supporters have spent
the past two days in tents erected in the Quad. Four
women — seniors Eva Silva and Julia Gonzalez
Luna, junior Tamara Alvarado and sophomore Elvi

versity grants their demands, and activists said 102
people fasted yesterday in solidarity.
The activists are demanding a University boycott
of grapes, the creation of a Chicano studies program,
a community center in East Palo Alto and a new
high-level job for Cecilia Burciaga, the Chicana ad
ministrator laid off in March.
