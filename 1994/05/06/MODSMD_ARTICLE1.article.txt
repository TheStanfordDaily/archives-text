# Talks reach stalemate; hunger strike continues
## 
### Miranda Doyle Editorial staff 
Four hunger strikers entered their third day of
fasting today after negotiations between Chicano
community leaders and University administrators
ended in a standoff last night.
Activists received no concessions from the presi
dent and provost at a 75-minute meeting, said stu
dent negotiator Jorge Solis, and no further meetings
were planned.
"We've gone as far as we can go," Provost Con
doleezza Rice said after the session. "I hope people
will understand that we have done as much as we
can. We have to preserve University processes."

Hunger strikers and their supporters have spent
the past two days in tents erected in the Quad. Four
women — seniors Eva Silva and Julia Gonzalez
Luna, junior Tamara Alvarado and sophomore Elvi
ra Prieto — have pledged to reject food until the Uni
versity grants their demands, and activists said 102
people fasted yesterday in solidarity.
The activists are demanding a University boycott
of grapes, the creation of a Chicano studies program,
a community center in East Palo Alto and a new
high-level job for Cecilia Burciaga, the Chicana ad
ministrator laid off in March.

impassioned speeches, chanting

Meanwhile, medical examina
tions at Cowell Student Health
Center yesterday morning
showed the four hunger strikers
were dehydrated and had lost
between three and six pounds
each, said senior Gloria
Sanchez.
The four women are drinking
water and electrolyte supple
ments that provide about 500 to
600 calories each day, she added
— a safer method of fasting
than the water-only hunger
strikes recently held at UC-
Santa Barbara and UCLA. Cow
ell has agreed to send a doctor
and nurse to the Quad to moni

Yesterday, a morning meeting
yielded a written statement from
University President Gerhard
Casper and Rice reiterating their
promise to form three committees
that will investigate the feasibility
of student demands.
Solis said there were "some
signs of progress" at last night's
meeting, but acknowledged that
Casper and Rice made no new
concessions. During the meeting,
students responded to the written
statement, which was delivered
by Dean of Students Michael
Jackson at 2 p.m. yesterday.
That statement turned out to
be a slightly altered version of the
press release the University
issued late Wednesday, drawing
criticism from senior Nicole
Sanchez. "How is this different
from the statement faxed to the
media?" she asked Jackson.
"It's a little different,"
responded Jackson, who played
the neutral mediator as he shut
tled between the Quad encamp
ment and Building 10.
During the early afternoon,
Jackson — taking no position on
either the wisdom of the hunger
strike or Casper's handling of the
conflict — said, "My hope is that
we'll have a meeting of the minds
and end the demonstration" at
the evening discussion.
But after the session in Build
ing 10 he admitted, "It seems as
though we have not reached a
meeting of the minds, and stu
dents are not accepting the pro
posals put forward by Casper and
Rice."
While the new committees will
address the grape boycott, Chi

cano studies program and com
munity center, Casper is standing
firm on Burciaga's layoff.
Casper and Rice "didn't agree
with our counter-response" to the
statement, Solis said. He declined
to comment on what specifically
the five student negotiators asked
administrators to promise beyond
what has already been offered.
During the discussion, Rice
said, "President Casper went to
lengths to explain our thinking,
but that's it. . . . We owe it to the
University as a whole to do this in
an orderly fashion."
A new kind of 'university'
Fed up with Stanford's cur
riculum, protest organizers also
announced the founding of their
own college — "Aztlan Universi
ty" — at the noon rally.
Faculty members will teach
half-hour classes on such topics as
"Flicks and Stanford Racism" and
"Chicana/o Politics" today from
9:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. in the Quad.
Speakers have also been

planned for Monday. Protesters
are committed to the long haul,
Solis said, although "we're hoping
every single time we meet with
[administrators] it will end."
Yesterday's events began with
a press conference at 11 a.m.,
where the four long-term hunger
strikers answered questions and
read from their list of demands.
"Everybody's walking around
every few minutes saying, 'Tama
ra, how are you feeling?' " said
Alvarado. "I just want to say that
I'm currently feeling OK."
Often angrily, sometimes
speaking Spanish, protesters and
their supporters denounced a per
ceived lack of respect for their
community from both students
and administrators.
"We need to be treated like
human beings," Silva said.
"That's what it comes down to."
Activists had asked students to
walk out of their classes at 11:25,
and the crowd swelled significant
ly around that time to hear a

parade of speakers from both the
Chicano community and various
student organizations pledging
their support.
"The University is interested
in resuming business as usual,"
said graduate student Daniel
Contreras.
"It is not normal for Chicanos
to occupy the Quad, and we have.
It is not normal for Chicanos to
hunger strike and we are. It is not
normal for Chicanos to win, and
we will."
Contreras also spoke of the
need for more media attention.
"Where is Ted Koppel and Night
line?" he asked. "A hunger strike
will not work until power is
shamed into negotiating."
He urged black, Asian-Ameri
can and Native American stu
dents to set up their own tents in
the Quad. "There's a lot of room
out here," he said.
Chicano Fellow Ben Olguin
called on students to support the
hunger strikers no matter what.
"We have to stay here as long as it
takes for our companeras and
companeros who are putting their
health, their lives, on the line," he
said. "If that means getting
arrested, if that means staying
here and camping out, we need to
do that."
The rally drew students from
groups ranging from Students for
Environmental Action at Stan
ford to the ASSU Senate. "We
believe that race, class, gender
and sexual orientation intersect,"
said junior Sarah Horsley, repre
senting the Women's Center Col
lective. "Disrespect for one com
munity translates into disrespect
for us all."
Senior Matthew Mizel called
on his "fellow white students" to
support the hunger strikers, and
a representative from Hillel said
the organization had canceled a
"bagel lunch" planned for noon in
the Quad.
One group, however, remained
on the sidelines. Irene Yackovlev,
president of the 200-member
Latino Students Association —
an adjunct body to MEChA,
which nominally represents all
Chicano and Latino students —
said that her group did not
endorse the strike and protest.
To her knowledge, no members of
the organization were participat
ing in the fast.
"We don't back the protest as a
principle," she said. "It's against
our philosophy, our mission in
the Stanford community." She
added that "these really aren't
issues affecting the Latino com
munity."
During the rally, students
clapped, prayed and chanted,
"The people united will never be
divided" and "Uvcis (Grapes) no!

Chicano studies, si!"
Several speakers also
expressed their rage over an inci
dent at last Sunday's Flicks
where some students laughed,
jeered and shouted racial slurs
during a movie short on the plight
of agricultural workers.
"If I am called a 'beaner' one
on-one, what can I do about it?"
Sanchez asked. "I'm glad it hap
pened. Thank God it finally hap
pened and hundreds and hun
dreds of people woke up to what
the climate is on this campus."
Students attending the rally
had varied reactions to the
protest. "It seems contrary to the
spirit of the University to use
hunger strikes in this kind of
protest," said doctoral student
lan Sobieski. "The University is
supposed to be a forum for
enlightened discussion, but you
can't have a reasonable discussion
when you've got someone holding
a gun to their own head."
Such a tactic "sets up a con
frontational situation instead of
one where you both try to work
together to reach some kind of
understanding," Sobieski said.
But freshman Rudy Delson
said he fully supports the protest.
"If Casper's solution is to set up
committees, that's unacceptable,"
he said. "That's a perfect example
of how this administration blows
off student concerns."
It is "nice to see liberal political
ideas getting support on campus
and it's wonderful to see people
passionate and taking action,
instead of just griping about
things in CIV section," Delson
added.
Faculty also concerned
In the face of uncertainty
about administrative response to
the strike, Faculty Senate mem
bers are also unclear about what
role they can play in meeting the
demands.
"The Faculty Senate has the
purview to get involved in any
range of issues it chooses, but
often only in an advisory posi
tion," said Political Science Prof.
Terry Karl. "It can discuss this
situation and urge the adminis
tration to take a set of actions —
that's the minimum it can do."
Karl said she sensed that facul
ty members were already con
cerned with issues related to the
strikers' demands, although the
senate will not meet again until
next Thursday.
"In the last meeting, people
expressed concern about the fir
ing of Burciaga," she said.
"There's a sense of concern that
people who have served the Uni
versity for 20 years be treated
with a respect their contribution
deserves."

English Prof. Ron Rebholz,
another senate member, watched
this afternoon's rally and sup
ported calls for the grape boycott
and Chicano studies program.
Rebholz said he would bring the
issues up to Casper at the next
senate meeting, but added that he
did not know how sympathetic
the faculty response to striker
demands would be.
Other members were not sure
that the senate would have power
to do anything. "Any time stu
dents feel this intensely about
something, the faculty ought to
consider it," said Business Prof.
Bill Simon. "But there's not much
action we can take except to give
serious study and consideration
to their demands."
A second day ends
After poet Raul Salinas read
from his work and Native Ameri
can drummers in town for this

weekend's Powwow performed on
drums, the group settled down for
the night.
Huddled in sleeping bags and
sweatshirts, supporters did home
work by flashlight or talked and
sang softly. In the tent, the strik
ers met to discuss their feelings —
both physical and mental — at the
close of the second day.
News of the end of the nine
day UC-Santa Barbara strike at
11 p.m. provoked applause from
protesters gathered around the
tent. "I'm ecstatic, especially
because I have a close friend that
is part of that strike," Silva said.
Other strikers said the news
gave them added hope and the
strength to continue their own
vigil. "I can wake up tomorrow and
feel better," Gonzalez Luna said.

hunger strike and we are. It is not
normal for Chicanos to win, and
we will."
Contreras also spoke of the
need for more media attention.
"Where is Ted Koppel and Night
line?" he asked. "A hunger strike
will not work until power is
shamed into negotiating."
He urged black, Asian-Ameri
can and Native American stu
dents to set up their own tents in
the Quad. "There's a lot of room
out here," he said.
Chicano Fellow Ben Olguin
called on students to support the
hunger strikers no matter what.
"We have to stay here as long as it
takes for our companeras and
companeros who are putting their
health, their lives, on the line," he
said. "If that means getting
arrested, if that means staying
here and camping out, we need to
do that."
The rally drew students from
groups ranging from Students for
Environmental Action at Stan
ford to the ASSU Senate. "We
believe that race, class, gender
and sexual orientation intersect,"
said junior Sarah Horsley, repre
senting the Women's Center Col
lective. "Disrespect for one com
munity translates into disrespect
for us all."
Senior Matthew Mizel called
on his "fellow white students" to
support the hunger strikers, and
a representative from Hillel said
the organization had canceled a
"bagel lunch" planned for noon in
the Quad.
One group, however, remained
on the sidelines. Irene Yackovlev,
president of the 200-member
Latino Students Association —
an adjunct body to MEChA,
which nominally represents all
Chicano and Latino students —
said that her group did not
endorse the strike and protest.
To her knowledge, no members of
the organization were participat
ing in the fast.
"We don't back the protest as a
principle," she said. "It's against
our philosophy, our mission in
the Stanford community." She
added that "these really aren't
issues affecting the Latino com
munity."
During the rally, students
clapped, prayed and chanted,
"The people united will never be
divided" and "Uvcis (Grapes) no!

Chicano studies, si!"
Several speakers also
expressed their rage over an inci
dent at last Sunday's Flicks
where some students laughed,
jeered and shouted racial slurs
during a movie short on the plight
of agricultural workers.
"If I am called a 'beaner' one
on-one, what can I do about it?"
Sanchez asked. "I'm glad it hap
pened. Thank God it finally hap
pened and hundreds and hun
dreds of people woke up to what
the climate is on this campus."
Students attending the rally
had varied reactions to the
protest. "It seems contrary to the
spirit of the University to use
hunger strikes in this kind of
protest," said doctoral student
lan Sobieski. "The University is
supposed to be a forum for
enlightened discussion, but you
can't have a reasonable discussion
when you've got someone holding
a gun to their own head."
Such a tactic "sets up a con
frontational situation instead of
one where you both try to work
together to reach some kind of
understanding," Sobieski said.
But freshman Rudy Delson
said he fully supports the protest.
"If Casper's solution is to set up
committees, that's unacceptable,"
he said. "That's a perfect example
of how this administration blows
off student concerns."
It is "nice to see liberal political
ideas getting support on campus
and it's wonderful to see people
passionate and taking action,
instead of just griping about
things in CIV section," Delson
added.
Faculty also concerned
In the face of uncertainty
about administrative response to
the strike, Faculty Senate mem
bers are also unclear about what
role they can play in meeting the
demands.
"The Faculty Senate has the
purview to get involved in any
range of issues it chooses, but
often only in an advisory posi
tion," said Political Science Prof.
Terry Karl. "It can discuss this
situation and urge the adminis
tration to take a set of actions —
that's the minimum it can do."
Karl said she sensed that facul
ty members were already con
cerned with issues related to the
strikers' demands, although the
senate will not meet again until
next Thursday.
"In the last meeting, people
expressed concern about the fir
ing of Burciaga," she said.
"There's a sense of concern that
people who have served the Uni
versity for 20 years be treated
with a respect their contribution
deserves."

English Prof. Ron Rebholz,
another senate member, watched
this afternoon's rally and sup
ported calls for the grape boycott
and Chicano studies program.
Rebholz said he would bring the
issues up to Casper at the next
senate meeting, but added that he
did not know how sympathetic
the faculty response to striker
demands would be.
Other members were not sure
that the senate would have power
to do anything. "Any time stu
dents feel this intensely about
something, the faculty ought to
consider it," said Business Prof.
Bill Simon. "But there's not much
action we can take except to give
serious study and consideration
to their demands."
A second day ends
After poet Raul Salinas read
from his work and Native Ameri
can drummers in town for this

weekend's Powwow performed on
drums, the group settled down for
the night.
Huddled in sleeping bags and
sweatshirts, supporters did home
work by flashlight or talked and
sang softly. In the tent, the strik
ers met to discuss their feelings —
both physical and mental — at the
close of the second day.
News of the end of the nine
day UC-Santa Barbara strike at
11 p.m. provoked applause from
protesters gathered around the
tent. "I'm ecstatic, especially
because I have a close friend that
is part of that strike," Silva said.
Other strikers said the news
gave them added hope and the
strength to continue their own
vigil. "I can wake up tomorrow and
feel better," Gonzalez Luna said.

Vincent Ho — Daily
Chicano students Victor Madrigal, Tamara Alvarado, center, and
Eva Silva rally students in the Quad yesterday.
Four hunger strikers entered their third day of
fasting today after negotiations between Chicano
community leaders and University administrators
ended in a standoff last night.
Activists received no concessions from the presi
dent and provost at a 75-minute meeting, said stu
dent negotiator Jorge Solis, and no further meetings
were planned.
"We've gone as far as we can go," Provost Con
doleezza Rice said after the session. "I hope people
will understand that we have done as much as we
can. We have to preserve University processes."

Hunger strikers and their supporters have spent
the past two days in tents erected in the Quad. Four
women — seniors Eva Silva and Julia Gonzalez
Luna, junior Tamara Alvarado and sophomore Elvi
ra Prieto — have pledged to reject food until the Uni
versity grants their demands, and activists said 102
people fasted yesterday in solidarity.
The activists are demanding a University boycott
of grapes, the creation of a Chicano studies program,
a community center in East Palo Alto and a new
high-level job for Cecilia Burciaga, the Chicana ad
ministrator laid off in March.

about 250 people listened to
impassioned speeches, chanting
and shows of support from sever

Haas Center advisory council and
HilleL
Meanwhile, medical examina
tions at Cowell Student Health
Center yesterday morning
showed the four hunger strikers
were dehydrated and had lost
between three and six pounds
each, said senior Gloria
Sanchez.
The four women are drinking
water and electrolyte supple
ments that provide about 500 to
600 calories each day, she added
— a safer method of fasting
than the water-only hunger
strikes recently held at UC-
Santa Barbara and UCLA. Cow
ell has agreed to send a doctor
and nurse to the Quad to moni
tor the fasters' health, begin
ning with blood pressure checks
tomorrow.
Yesterday, a morning meeting
yielded a written statement from
University President Gerhard
Casper and Rice reiterating their
promise to form three committees
that will investigate the feasibility
of student demands.
Solis said there were "some
signs of progress" at last night's
meeting, but acknowledged that
Casper and Rice made no new
concessions. During the meeting,
students responded to the written
statement, which was delivered
by Dean of Students Michael
Jackson at 2 p.m. yesterday.
That statement turned out to
be a slightly altered version of the
press release the University
issued late Wednesday, drawing
criticism from senior Nicole
Sanchez. "How is this different
from the statement faxed to the
media?" she asked Jackson.
"It's a little different,"
responded Jackson, who played
the neutral mediator as he shut
tled between the Quad encamp
ment and Building 10.
During the early afternoon,
Jackson — taking no position on
either the wisdom of the hunger
strike or Casper's handling of the
conflict — said, "My hope is that
we'll have a meeting of the minds
and end the demonstration" at
the evening discussion.
But after the session in Build
ing 10 he admitted, "It seems as
though we have not reached a
meeting of the minds, and stu
dents are not accepting the pro
posals put forward by Casper and
Rice."
While the new committees will
address the grape boycott, Chi

cano studies program and com
munity center, Casper is standing
firm on Burciaga's layoff.
Casper and Rice "didn't agree
with our counter-response" to the
statement, Solis said. He declined
to comment on what specifically
the five student negotiators asked
administrators to promise beyond
what has already been offered.
During the discussion, Rice
said, "President Casper went to
lengths to explain our thinking,
but that's it. . . . We owe it to the
University as a whole to do this in
an orderly fashion."
A new kind of 'university'
Fed up with Stanford's cur
riculum, protest organizers also
announced the founding of their
own college — "Aztlan Universi
ty" — at the noon rally.
Faculty members will teach
half-hour classes on such topics as
"Flicks and Stanford Racism" and
"Chicana/o Politics" today from
9:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. in the Quad.
Speakers have also been

planned for Monday. Protesters
are committed to the long haul,
Solis said, although "we're hoping
every single time we meet with
[administrators] it will end."
Yesterday's events began with
a press conference at 11 a.m.,
where the four long-term hunger
strikers answered questions and
read from their list of demands.
"Everybody's walking around
every few minutes saying, 'Tama
ra, how are you feeling?' " said
Alvarado. "I just want to say that
I'm currently feeling OK."
Often angrily, sometimes
speaking Spanish, protesters and
their supporters denounced a per
ceived lack of respect for their
community from both students
and administrators.
"We need to be treated like
human beings," Silva said.
"That's what it comes down to."
Activists had asked students to
walk out of their classes at 11:25,
and the crowd swelled significant
ly around that time to hear a

parade of speakers from both the
Chicano community and various
student organizations pledging
their support.
"The University is interested
in resuming business as usual,"
said graduate student Daniel
Contreras.
"It is not normal for Chicanos
to occupy the Quad, and we have.
It is not normal for Chicanos to
hunger strike and we are. It is not
normal for Chicanos to win, and
we will."
Contreras also spoke of the
need for more media attention.
"Where is Ted Koppel and Night
line?" he asked. "A hunger strike
will not work until power is
shamed into negotiating."
He urged black, Asian-Ameri

said. "If that means getting
arrested, if that means staying

Senior Matthew Mizel called

"bagel lunch" planned for noon in

Chicano students Victor Madrigal, Tamara Alvarado, center, and
Eva Silva rally students in the Quad yesterday.
Four hunger strikers entered their third day of
fasting today after negotiations between Chicano
community leaders and University administrators
ended in a standoff last night.
Activists received no concessions from the presi
dent and provost at a 75-minute meeting, said stu
dent negotiator Jorge Solis, and no further meetings
were planned.
"We've gone as far as we can go," Provost Con
doleezza Rice said after the session. "I hope people
will understand that we have done as much as we
can. We have to preserve University processes."

Hunger strikers and their supporters have spent
the past two days in tents erected in the Quad. Four
women — seniors Eva Silva and Julia Gonzalez
Luna, junior Tamara Alvarado and sophomore Elvi
ra Prieto — have pledged to reject food until the Uni
versity grants their demands, and activists said 102
people fasted yesterday in solidarity.
The activists are demanding a University boycott
of grapes, the creation of a Chicano studies program,
a community center in East Palo Alto and a new
high-level job for Cecilia Burciaga, the Chicana ad
ministrator laid off in March.

about 250 people listened to
impassioned speeches, chanting
and shows of support from sever
al campus organizations, includ
ing the four ethnic centers, the
Haas Center advisory council and
HilleL
Meanwhile, medical examina
tions at Cowell Student Health
Center yesterday morning
showed the four hunger strikers
were dehydrated and had lost
between three and six pounds
each, said senior Gloria
Sanchez.
The four women are drinking
water and electrolyte supple
ments that provide about 500 to
600 calories each day, she added
— a safer method of fasting
than the water-only hunger
strikes recently held at UC-
Santa Barbara and UCLA. Cow
ell has agreed to send a doctor
and nurse to the Quad to moni
tor the fasters' health, begin
ning with blood pressure checks
tomorrow.
Yesterday, a morning meeting
yielded a written statement from
University President Gerhard
Casper and Rice reiterating their
promise to form three committees
that will investigate the feasibility
of student demands.
Solis said there were "some
signs of progress" at last night's
meeting, but acknowledged that
Casper and Rice made no new
concessions. During the meeting,
students responded to the written
statement, which was delivered
by Dean of Students Michael
Jackson at 2 p.m. yesterday.
That statement turned out to
be a slightly altered version of the
press release the University
issued late Wednesday, drawing
criticism from senior Nicole
Sanchez. "How is this different
from the statement faxed to the
media?" she asked Jackson.
"It's a little different,"
responded Jackson, who played
the neutral mediator as he shut
tled between the Quad encamp
ment and Building 10.
During the early afternoon,
Jackson — taking no position on
either the wisdom of the hunger
strike or Casper's handling of the
conflict — said, "My hope is that
we'll have a meeting of the minds
and end the demonstration" at
the evening discussion.
But after the session in Build
ing 10 he admitted, "It seems as
though we have not reached a
meeting of the minds, and stu
dents are not accepting the pro
posals put forward by Casper and
Rice."
While the new committees will
address the grape boycott, Chi

cano studies program and com
munity center, Casper is standing
firm on Burciaga's layoff.
Casper and Rice "didn't agree
with our counter-response" to the
statement, Solis said. He declined
to comment on what specifically
the five student negotiators asked
administrators to promise beyond
what has already been offered.
During the discussion, Rice
said, "President Casper went to
lengths to explain our thinking,
but that's it. . . . We owe it to the
University as a whole to do this in
an orderly fashion."
A new kind of 'university'
Fed up with Stanford's cur
riculum, protest organizers also
announced the founding of their
own college — "Aztlan Universi
ty" — at the noon rally.
Faculty members will teach
half-hour classes on such topics as
"Flicks and Stanford Racism" and
"Chicana/o Politics" today from
9:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. in the Quad.
Speakers have also been

planned for Monday. Protesters
are committed to the long haul,
Solis said, although "we're hoping
every single time we meet with
[administrators] it will end."
Yesterday's events began with
a press conference at 11 a.m.,
where the four long-term hunger
strikers answered questions and
read from their list of demands.
"Everybody's walking around
every few minutes saying, 'Tama
ra, how are you feeling?' " said
Alvarado. "I just want to say that
I'm currently feeling OK."
Often angrily, sometimes
speaking Spanish, protesters and
their supporters denounced a per
ceived lack of respect for their
community from both students
and administrators.
"We need to be treated like
human beings," Silva said.
"That's what it comes down to."
Activists had asked students to
walk out of their classes at 11:25,
and the crowd swelled significant
ly around that time to hear a

parade of speakers from both the
Chicano community and various
student organizations pledging
their support.
"The University is interested
in resuming business as usual,"
said graduate student Daniel
Contreras.
"It is not normal for Chicanos
to occupy the Quad, and we have.
It is not normal for Chicanos to
hunger strike and we are. It is not
normal for Chicanos to win, and
we will."
Contreras also spoke of the
need for more media attention.
"Where is Ted Koppel and Night
line?" he asked. "A hunger strike
will not work until power is
shamed into negotiating."
He urged black, Asian-Ameri
can and Native American stu
dents to set up their own tents in
the Quad. "There's a lot of room
out here," he said.
Chicano Fellow Ben Olguin
called on students to support the
hunger strikers no matter what.
"We have to stay here as long as it
takes for our companeras and
companeros who are putting their
health, their lives, on the line," he
said. "If that means getting
arrested, if that means staying
here and camping out, we need to
do that."
The rally drew students from
groups ranging from Students for
Environmental Action at Stan
ford to the ASSU Senate. "We
believe that race, class, gender
and sexual orientation intersect,"
said junior Sarah Horsley, repre
senting the Women's Center Col
lective. "Disrespect for one com
munity translates into disrespect
for us all."
Senior Matthew Mizel called
on his "fellow white students" to
support the hunger strikers, and
a representative from Hillel said
the organization had canceled a
"bagel lunch" planned for noon in
the Quad.
One group, however, remained
on the sidelines. Irene Yackovlev,
president of the 200-member
Latino Students Association —
an adjunct body to MEChA,
which nominally represents all
Chicano and Latino students —
said that her group did not
endorse the strike and protest.
To her knowledge, no members of
the organization were participat
ing in the fast.
"We don't back the protest as a
principle," she said. "It's against
our philosophy, our mission in
the Stanford community." She
added that "these really aren't
issues affecting the Latino com
munity."
During the rally, students
clapped, prayed and chanted,
"The people united will never be
divided" and "Uvcis (Grapes) no!

Chicano studies, si!"
Several speakers also
expressed their rage over an inci
dent at last Sunday's Flicks
where some students laughed,
jeered and shouted racial slurs
during a movie short on the plight
of agricultural workers.
"If I am called a 'beaner' one
on-one, what can I do about it?"
Sanchez asked. "I'm glad it hap
pened. Thank God it finally hap
pened and hundreds and hun
dreds of people woke up to what
the climate is on this campus."
Students attending the rally
had varied reactions to the
protest. "It seems contrary to the
spirit of the University to use
hunger strikes in this kind of
protest," said doctoral student
lan Sobieski. "The University is
supposed to be a forum for
enlightened discussion, but you
can't have a reasonable discussion
when you've got someone holding
a gun to their own head."
Such a tactic "sets up a con
frontational situation instead of
one where you both try to work
together to reach some kind of
understanding," Sobieski said.
But freshman Rudy Delson
said he fully supports the protest.
"If Casper's solution is to set up
committees, that's unacceptable,"
he said. "That's a perfect example
of how this administration blows
off student concerns."
It is "nice to see liberal political
ideas getting support on campus
and it's wonderful to see people
passionate and taking action,
instead of just griping about
things in CIV section," Delson
added.
Faculty also concerned
In the face of uncertainty
about administrative response to
the strike, Faculty Senate mem
bers are also unclear about what
role they can play in meeting the
demands.
"The Faculty Senate has the
purview to get involved in any
range of issues it chooses, but
often only in an advisory posi
tion," said Political Science Prof.
Terry Karl. "It can discuss this
situation and urge the adminis
tration to take a set of actions —
that's the minimum it can do."
Karl said she sensed that facul
ty members were already con
cerned with issues related to the
strikers' demands, although the
senate will not meet again until
next Thursday.
"In the last meeting, people
expressed concern about the fir
ing of Burciaga," she said.
"There's a sense of concern that
people who have served the Uni
versity for 20 years be treated
with a respect their contribution
deserves."

English Prof. Ron Rebholz,
another senate member, watched
this afternoon's rally and sup
ported calls for the grape boycott
and Chicano studies program.
Rebholz said he would bring the
issues up to Casper at the next
senate meeting, but added that he
did not know how sympathetic
the faculty response to striker
demands would be.
Other members were not sure
that the senate would have power
to do anything. "Any time stu
dents feel this intensely about
something, the faculty ought to
consider it," said Business Prof.
Bill Simon. "But there's not much
action we can take except to give
serious study and consideration
to their demands."
A second day ends
After poet Raul Salinas read
from his work and Native Ameri
can drummers in town for this

weekend's Powwow performed on
drums, the group settled down for
the night.
Huddled in sleeping bags and
sweatshirts, supporters did home
work by flashlight or talked and
sang softly. In the tent, the strik
ers met to discuss their feelings —
both physical and mental — at the
close of the second day.
News of the end of the nine
day UC-Santa Barbara strike at
11 p.m. provoked applause from
protesters gathered around the
tent. "I'm ecstatic, especially
because I have a close friend that
is part of that strike," Silva said.
Other strikers said the news
gave them added hope and the
strength to continue their own
vigil. "I can wake up tomorrow and
feel better," Gonzalez Luna said.
