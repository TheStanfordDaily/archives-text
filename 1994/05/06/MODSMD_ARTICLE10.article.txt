# Experts to discuss global manufacturing issues
## 
### Nina Wasow 
Production decisions and partnership
issues are among several of the topics to be
debated by CEOs, government administra
tors, Stanford faculty and students at a con
ference this weekend sponsored jointly by the
Graduate School of Business and the School of
Engineering.
"Achieving Global Competitiveness
through Manufacturing Partnerships" repre
sents the first time the two schools have ever
officially worked together to bring a manufac
turing conference to the University.
The conference's topics include "outsourc
ing," the decision of a company to have certain
parts of their product made elsewhere and
shipped in, and "supply-chain management,"
involving suppliers in the design process, as
well as environmental issues, education
issues, government issues and partnerships in
general.
Workshops are organized into 10 tracks
based on their subject matter. Each of the four
sessions will contain a seminar from each
track. The conference is expected to draw
about 800 people from government, industry
and academia.
The conference is being run entirely by stu
dents from the two schools. It was organized
through a "top-down approach"— first choos
ing the title, then the sub-topics, then the
speakers — beginning last April, according to
graduate student Lon Van Geloven, a coordi

nator.
Then, a group of 20 to 25 students formed
a speakers committee, which split into groups
of two or three for each issue. Van Geloven
said the committees relied on Stanford's name
to attract speakers, who will come on a volun
teer basis.
Toni Cupal, a co-coordinator and co-presi
dent of the Business School manufacturing
club, said the groups tried to choose keynote
speakers from companies that represented the
conference's topic. "We tried to get names
that people would recognize from companies
that are making changes or having new
ideas," said Cupal.
The keynote speakers will be Craig R.
Barrett, the chief operating officer of Intel
Corporation; Percy Barnevik, the president
and chief executive officer of Asea Brown
Boveri; and John F. Smith, Jr., the presi
dent and CEO of General Motors Corpora
tion.
This is the sixth manufacturing confer
ence in 10 years at Stanford. "In the past,
this has been run by the Business School
manufacturing club. This year, the big differ
ence is that it's very much a joint program —
there are as many or more volunteers from
the Engineering School as the Biz School.
From my perspective, one of the major goals
was to try and integrate the two schools,"
said Van Geloven.
"Another thrust was having this triangle of
academia, government and industry, to talk

about the topic of manufacturing, and how the
hell you could bring the three of them togeth
er," he said. Cupal agreed, calling the confer
ence a forum for discussion between the three
groups.
The conference is also intended to benefit
students, both attendees and organizers,
and to stimulate discussion. "We as a stu
dent body would like to benefit from their
experience and expertise," said Van
Geloven.
The conference is being funded by a
$10,000 seed fund from last year's confer
ence's profits, and by loans from the schools
and other organizations that have already
been paid back.
A few Stanford faculty members will be
speaking, including Engineering School Profs.
Hau Lee and Seungjin Whang, and Dr.
Charles Holloway from the Business School.
Lee and Whang are leading a seminar entitled
"Supply Chain Management: Industry Trends
and Opportunities." Holloway is participating
in a panel discussion called "Academic and
Industry Perspectives on Manufacturing Edu
cation."
Many other faculty, staff, and students will
be attending the conference. "Historically,
about one-third of the attendees have been
students," said Cupal. "I'd really encourage
students to come — it's great access to amaz
ing people in industry. It's an opportunity to
meet people outside our school. That's the
whole purpose of it," she said.
