Fay's lashings spur debate
SINGAPORE (AP) — Singapore deliv
ered the stinging last words in a case that
provoked international debate on crime
and how to discourage it: four strokes of
a rattan rod across the buttocks of an
American teen-ager.
Michael Fay was among 10 prisoners
to be flogged yesterday at Queenstown
Prison. The 18-year-old high school
senior was completing his fifth week of a
four-month prison term also ordered for
spray-painting cars and other acts of van
dalism.
The punishment, considered torture
by many human rights groups, was car
ried out using a wetted, four-foot-long
rattan rod.
Floggings are a common form of pun
ishment in Singapore and other coun

tries, but Fay's case touched a nerve in
the United States because of its struggle
with rising crime and the failure of
efforts to deter it.
Two firefighters suspected
LOS ANGELES (AP) - Revelations
that two firefighters are under investiga
tion in the killer Malibu wildfire sent a
jolt yesterday through the scorched com
munity where the title firefighter is syn
onymous with hero.
Outrage over the allegations in the
still-developing probe mixed with anger
that the reputation of all firefighters
could be tarred by a few.
"I have a hard time imagining this is
true. Firemen have to know that people die
in fires," said Ann Brisbin, 39, whose home
burned in the firestorm started on Nov. 2.
