# Assault weapon ban OK'd by House
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The House
voted narrowly yesterday to ban 19
types of assault-style weapons, bending
to Americans' outrage over crime and
delivering a stunning victory to Presi
dent Clinton.
The vote was a crushing defeat for
the National Rifle Association. Clinton
said it marked "a sea change in the
crime debate."
The 216-214 vote had a dramatic end
ing, as one lawmaker — Rep. Andrew
Jacobs Jr., I)-Ind. — switched in favor of
the ban. Clinton said supporters of the
ban had "demonstrated extraordinary
courage in the face of extraordinary
political pressure to walk away."
The outcome showed anew that the
gun owners' group has lost some of the
clout that once brought it certain victory
against legislation to ban firearms. Last
November, Congress passed the Brady

law that requires a five-day wait and
background checks for handgun buyers.
Clinton, who lobbied lawmakers in
dozens of telephone calls, said the
House "rose to the occasion and stood
up for the national interest."
"They stood up against the madness
that we have come to see when crimi
nals and terrorists have legal access to
assault weapons and then find them
selves better armed than police, putting
more and more people in increasing
danger of their lives," Clinton said.
Both houses now have passed similar
weapons bans. The final language must
be worked out in a House-Senate con
ference.
Only last week, backers of the ban
were 15-20 votes behind. By the start of
this week, the number had dwindled to
under a dozen. And as the vote neared,
even as lawmakers confronted each

other in floor debate, a parade of ban
supporters stepped forward to
announce their new positions.
The measure would stop future pro
duction and sale of the 19 weapons, but
would not affect legally owned guns on
the list.
Clinton, who lobbied lawmakers
until midnight Wednesday and resumed
his efforts yesterday, gave convert Rep.
Stephen Neal, D-N.C., a starring role in
a joint Rose Garden appearance.
The administration lobbying did not
stop with Clinton, as Treasury Secretary
Lloyd Bentsen went to the Capitol to
buttonhole wavering House members.
"This bill ... is very different," Rep.
Tim Roomer, D-Ind., argued. "It does
not take guns away from anybody in
this country. It does not retroactively go
after the guns owned by legitimate gun
owners of this country."
