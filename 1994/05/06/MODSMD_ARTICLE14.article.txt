## Editorial Demanding respect 
### 
After several try
ing months of disillusioning
AL 1/experiences, the Chicano
community at Stanford has reached
a point of desperation that no one
here should feel forced to resort to
— a hunger strike.
Given the gravity of the situa
tion, University administration,
faculty and students should consid
er the strikers' demands very seri
ously. This is a first step to re-estab
lishing mutual trust.
While the strike is outside nor
mal University channels, the dras
tic measures taken signify that
"business as usual" will not suffice.
The protesters have four
demands: an offer of a high-level
position for Assoc. Vice Provost for
Student Affairs Cecilia Burciaga,
who was recently laid off due to
budget cuts; the establishment of a
community center in East Palo
Alto; a campus-wide ban on grapes;
and the development of a Chicano
Studies program.
The first demand, to offer Burci
aga another high-level position is
understandably difficult during a
time of budget cuts. It also would
place her in an awkward position, if
she regained a job here because her
employer received an ultimatum.
However, the University can and
should recognize her value and ded
ication to the community by allow
ing the Burciagas to stay on as Casa
Zapata's resident fellows for one
more year. This would show real
concern for the Chicano community
and help provide them with wise
leadership at an uncertain time.
The students' demand for a cam
pus-wide ban on grapes is rooted in
a very real and grave concern for
the migrant farm workers whose
health and lives are endangered by
the pesticides sprayed on grapes.
But ultimately, if Stanford
abstains from eating grapes, it
should be because students and
community members consciously
choose to do so, not because the
administration mandates it.
Students can already vote on
whether their dining halls will serve

grapes. This policy should continue.
In addition, perhaps the University
could send food service representa
tives to house meetings once a year
to ensure that each house votes.
To promote change at other
eateries, education is the most
effective vehicle. If enough patrons
of Tresidder or the Faculty Club let
managers know that they will not
eat grapes, then these places will
find them a wasteful purchase.
The establishment of a Chicano
studies program and a community
center in East Palo Alto are worthy
of further investigation. It would
inevitably take longer to meet these
demands, as strong buildings and
programs do not appear overnight.
The University has already taken a
good first step by creating commit
tees to look into both of these.
In regard to the Chicano studies
program, faculty members who
want it must make it a priority for
themselves and push for it; an inte
gral part of establishing an academ
ic program is strong faculty support.
For the health of the students
involved, it is important for the
strike to be resolved as quickly as
possible. This requires compromise
by both sides. By issuing demands
— such as the East Palo Alto com
munity center — that had not been
raised formally prior to the strike,
students cannot expect immediate
resolutions. And they must be
aware that such novel demands may
appear spontaneous and unfeasible.
Still, the administration must
give serious consideration to the
strikers' demands. It must also
ensure that the committees it has
formed are not purely ornamental.
Once the committees make recom
mendations, the University must be
willing to back them with full sup
port, financial or otherwise.
That students feel they must fast
to gain respect reflects a sense of
urgency that Stanford has not
known for a long time, and it is
something that must be addressed
with the utmost consideration,
open-mindedness, and most of all,
respect.
