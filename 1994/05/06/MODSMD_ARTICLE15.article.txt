## Institute N.H.I. 'What is wrong with our education?' 
### 
UNLIKE PRESENT-DAY discourse
on education which focuses on the
type of education that our present
world-system needs — such as a "multicul
tural" education for a "multicultural"
world, or a "back-to-basics" approach to
prepare a workforce to compete in the
technological age, or a wholesale return to
a "liberal" education — the question that
we at Institute N.H.I, pose is not what type
of education our world needs, but what
type of world does our education create ?
In answering this question, it is impor
tant to historicize our present system of
knowledge, which emerged in the 19th cent
tury to bring in the industrial revolution. As
a condition of this feat it would integrate all
European ethnic groups in America on the
basis of the theoretical fiction of "White
ness." That is why Serbs and Croats, among
other European ethnic groups, do not fight
each other here, for they have been made
kin-related by this fiction. Yet "Whiteness"
can have no value without the invention and
exclusion of "non-Whites," and, most
extremely, "Blacks."
Thus we have a system of scholarship
that was instituted to integrate what
Melville has defined as a "narrow tribe of
men [and women]," that is, representing
the Euro-American (and today, the Euro-
American immigrant) experience as if it
were the generic American experience.
The call for Black studies, which arose in
the wake of the burning of cities across the
United States, ignited by the assassination

of Martin Luther King Jr., demonstrated
the total incapability of the mainstream
order of knowledge to incorporate the expe
riences and aspirations of Blacks, as well as
of Indigenous Americans systematically
imprisoned on the reservations — that is,
of its inability to incorporate two of Ameri
ca's three founding population groups.
The call for Black studies (reinforced
with the calls for Native American, Chi
cano, and, in its own way, Women's stud
ies), was therefore about, as Sylvia Wynter
has proposed, the re-invention of the iden
tity of North America as North American
rather than as Euro-American. North
America conceived of as the "world" civi
lization Melville noted it to be, or, as Harold
Cruse accurately defines it, a "European-
African-Indian" amalgam, rather than the
"White" nation which is how our present
mainstream curriculum represents it.
Nevertheless, a generation after the
questions posed by the '60s, we still hang
on to disciplinary paradigms which are
unable to conceptualize the existential
reality of North America. (For example, a
university has a department of English,
that of Melville's "narrow tribe of men
[and women]," rather than a department
of the Literature of North America, of
Melville's "world." Or, for more exam
ples, consider the national departments of
history, political science and economics.)
The discourses of ethnic pluralism,
multiculturalism, interactive pluralism
(as well as post-modernism and decon

struction), are only the most recent
attempts to evade the fundamental issue
of the reinvention of North America from
a North American perspective, as was
implicit in the call for the "new studies" in
the wake of the '60s. These faddish t rends
have defused the original, transformative
impulse of Black studies (with the other
"new studies") to move beyond the limits
of our present organization of knowledge.
We now have non-white "self-esteem stud
ies" (including multiculturalism and Afro
centricism) to go along with what is in
effect the White "self-esteem" studies of
the liberal-humanist paradigms of the
social sciences and humanities.
This was the curriculum that, as
Carter G. Woodson defined it in 1933, law
likely functioned, and still functions, :o
motivate the "White" student with the
thought that "hef/shel is everything and
has accomplished everything worthwhile,
[and] depresses and crushes at the same
time the spark" in the Black student most
totally "by making him[/her| feel that
his[/her] race does not amount to much ."
Some 50 years afler Woodson, David
Bradley in 1982 described the unfinished
work of a transformation of our system of
scholarship, the central thrust of the call for
Black studies, due to its evasion bv counter
reformative paradigms like multicultural
ism. "As a result of rallies," he notes, "we
got courses in 'Black literature' and 'Black
