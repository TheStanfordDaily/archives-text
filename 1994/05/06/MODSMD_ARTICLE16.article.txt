## Casper: endowment, facilities must be maintained 
### 
MATTHEW MIZEL contends in his
April 29 Friday forum that Stan
ford's budget could be brought
into balance without further cuts by sim
ply raising the endowment payout rate.
While it is always tempting to turn to the
endowment to avoid making important
corrections to the budget, it would be
unwise to do so.
Endowment policies, including the
annual payout formula, are not set by the
president and provost, but by the Board of
Trustees who bear the fiduciary responsi
bility for protecting the value of the
endowment in perpetuity. The payout
rate represents an attempt to balance our
short-term needs and opportunities
against the imperative to leave an endow
ment to future generations that is at least
as strong as it is today. Sometimes the
balance shifts towards more immediate
needs. Thus, the Trustees in 1992
increased the payout rate from its tradi
tional 4.75 percent rate to 6.75 percent for
two years to give the University time to
adjust to the precipitous decline in indi
rect cost recoveries and the immediate
aftermath of the Loma Prieta Earth
quake. It was clear when this action was
taken that it was temporary, and that

other permanent solutions would have to
be found.
In order to maintain the real value of
an endowment, long-term investment
returns must be equal to or greater than
the sum of inflation and any amounts
paid out to support programs. Since uni
versity expenses tend to rise at a faster
rate than broader measures of inflation,
such as the Consumer Price Index, we
must account for "university inflation" in
order to insure that the buying power of
the endowment will remain constant.
Thus, under current assumptions, endow
ment returns must equal inflation plus 1
percent (the university inflation factor)
plus our payout rate. If general inflation is
3 percent, the university factor 1 percent
and the payout rate 5.25 percent, average
long-term returns on investments must
equal 9.25 percent if we are to "break
even." Our investment professionals and
their advisers believe this is a prudent and
achievable target over the long term, but
of course there are no guarantees.
While it is true that Stanford's invest
ment returns have been quite good during
the past several years, as former Universi
ty President Donald Kennedy pointed out
in his recent letter to The Daily, most

investment experts consider these to be
unusual times. There have been, and will
again be years in which investment
returns are negative or below the level of
inflation. The amounts that we reinvest in
the endowment during the good years will
help offset those losses. Looking back over
a 20-year period, from the early 1970s to
the early 19905, Stanford's endowment,
after subtracting the payout, remained
essentially flat in real terms. Roughly
speaking, the substantial returns of the
1980s were just enough to make up for
the weak performance of the previous
decade.
In adding .5 percent to the basic payout
rate of 4.75 percent, the Trustees explicit
ly directed us to use this new amount to
protect our other major form of endow
ment, our facilities. If we fail to attend to
our physical plant and infrastructure we
risk weakening the institution in the long
run just as surely as if we fail to protect
the endowment. The half-point increase
helps us strike a new balance among the
competing goals of maintaining the
endowment, maintaining the campus and
sustaining our academic programs.
Using more of our endowment will do
nothing to correct the fundamental eco-

nomic problem with which we are con
fronted in the budget: our expenses have
grown faster than our revenues. Unless
we are prepared to reduce our costs and
control the rate of growth, we will not
survive for long no matter how large the
endowment. Many colleges and universi
ties, and indeed many large corporations,
face the same basic need to reduce costs.
No one should expect that Stanford can be
oblivious to the economic realities of our
times.
Finally, Mizel takes the provost and
me to task for making budget decisions in
isolation, a charge which fails to take the
facts into account. The budget process
has involved the deans, the University
Cabinet and committees of the Faculty
Senate, regular consultations with stu
dent leaders such as the Council of Presi
dents, open town meetings attended by
the provost and administrative officers,
and a variety of other public discussions.
In the end, the president is responsible
for the budget of the University; it is sim
ply part of the job. However, I will contin
ue to welcome open and informed discus
sions of the issues.
