# Students show support for protesters, demand higher accountability
## 
### 
We, the Student Advisory Council at
the Haas Center for Public Service, here
by express our support of the Chicano/
Latino community in their strike for jus
tice. As concerned students, it is our hope
that more will join us in our public sup
port of the Chicano community.
While we support the specific
demands made by the Chicano communi
ty, we believe that the greater issue of
justice extends beyond ethnic and/or

racial boundaries. We will not stand by
idly as our fellow students sacrifice
themselves for causes which all of us are
affected by — racism, injustice, disre
spect and an administration that has not
responded to even the most heartfelt of
student pleas. As members of the Stan
ford community, we must all take this
opportunity to become involved and voice
our concerns. There may not be another
opportunity to positively affect this
administration for some time. We urge
everyone to join together and act now.
What could students do with a com
mon voice? Petition the campus and
voice concerns. Challenge the ASSU to
represent your views. Canvas dorms and
share your personal convictions. Bom-

bard the administration with informa
tion — letters, e-mail, phone calls.
Demand the University carry out the
recommendations of the final report of
the University Committee on Minority
Issues. Consider the upcoming reports
of the Commission on Undergraduate
Education. Step into the role of owner
ship that belongs to students who pay
for their education and the services they
receive. Take control of your University.
We encourage other student centers,
groups, faculty, administration members
and staff to open the lines of communica
tion. The Stanford community must work
toward building a common vision, invest
ing strength in broad-based coalitions and
creating a University that is accountable

to the interests of all its members.
The community has once again been
forced to take the initiative in an effort
to positively influence this University. It
is important that this moment not pass
without action. Let's all end this cycle of
having to take extreme measures in
order to be heard.
