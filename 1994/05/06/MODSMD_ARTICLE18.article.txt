## Exposing my soft underbelly at the mall 
### 
SUE WAS THE MOST beautiful
woman I'd ever seen. There she
stood, behind the counter of See's
Candies, blondish-gray hair gently fram
ing her powdered face and huge eyes. Set
against the Pine-Sol sterility of the
candy shop, smiling awkwardly and
struggling through a thick European
accent. Couched in a white and black
smock to complement the white tile and
black countertops that held white boxes
of chocolates tied with black ribbons.
As I set my bag of lollipops down in
front of the register, she fatiguedly
brushed her hair out of her face and anx
iously began searching for the price of the
candy, looking up at me in fright as she
couldn't find the tag. Anxiously watched
me nod and smile and walk across the
store to retrieve a box with a correspond
ing price tag. Anxiously punched the
number in with her index finger, relaying
the total in an apologetic tone.
Relax, we're all friends here.
With a clang of the cash drawer, her
embarrassment washed away as she
struggled to find my 60 cents. Struggled
as she exasperatedly handed me six
dimes out of the full drawer. Struggled to
find the right size bag. Struggled to avoid
the jostlings of the other late-to-middle
aged women behind the counter. Strug
gled to give me the plastic good-bye jingle

as I took my bag, told her to have a good
day and left the obscenely clean store.
Please come again.
I walked outside into the suffocating
poshness of the shopping center, with its
decadent flowers and stylishly clothed
mother-daughter patron tag teams all
sporting the latest innovation in Italian
shoe fashion. I looked around at all the
yuppie mothers, pushing their babies in
yuppie strollers. I sat down near a foun
tain to watch the teenage girls grudging
ly pacing in with their mothers, off to
buy acceptable clothing free of holes,
unflattering design and dreary colors.
And I thought about the beautiful
woman back in the candy store, well into
her 60s. Frantically working and miss
ing the sunlight. Frantically maneuver
ing the cash register, answering the tele
phone in broken English and describing
the fillings of different dark-chocolate
monstrosities. Frantically catering to
unforgiving customers looking for merci
lessly snappy service.
The show must go on.
I walked from store to store, basking
in the joys of wretched excess, but I just
couldn't get this woman off my mind.
Sad woman. Sad situation. Sad store.
She shouldn't be there, I grimaced.
She should be sitting out in front of the
fountain reading a good book. She
should be in a park watching the clouds

dance by. She should be somewhere she
is appreciated. Where people smile at her
and she is used to that. Somewhere I
would like my mother to be.
Take my hand.
I pictured my mom, sitting behind some
lousy counter, her soul crushed under the
weight of bridge mixes, toffees and hurried
orders from impatient customers. My
mom, eyes as distressed as the eyes of this
woman, hands as shaky as this woman's,
smile as strained as this woman's.
I zig-zagged my way through the foot
traffic, striding past the gold-card wield
ing throng. I quickly turned into the
shop I was looking for, as the saleswom
en looked up at me — clothed in black
from my shoes to my baseball cap.
Just let me explain.
All I needed, I asked, was a flower. No,
not a rose. I needed a flower for someone
and it had to speak for itself. No it
wasn't a secret-pal gift. It was for some
one I didn't know and wouldn't ever
know, I stammered. Someone working in
the candy store who deserved a flower.
The manager pointed out a big, pink,
waxy flower that didn't exactly spell
magic, but didn't say flower-pot-defiler.
She encased it in thick glossy plastic, tied
a pink ribbon around it, took my money
and went puzzledly back to her ferns.
A rose is a rose is a rose.
And as I neared the store, I got a little

nervous. What would she say? What
would her reaction be? What would she
think of some woman off the street
handing her a large, obtrusive flower?
I walked into the store and got in line.
I shuffled up to the counter as she asked
if she could help me, not remembering
that I had even been there moments ear
lier. I took the flower out from behind my
back, smiled and handed it to her, telling
her she reminded me of my mom and
that she seemed like a beautiful person.
As the other saleswomen stared in confu
sion and the woman flashed me a bewil
dered look, I turned and exited the store.
Don't talk to strangers.
Nearly four innocent pedestrians
were crushed as I bolted from the mall
to get away from the crowd and be
alone. Nearly two hours passed by before
I stopped pacing around the Medical
Center on my walk home and decided to
go back to the reality of my dorm room.
Nearly my entire sleeve got wet as I
wiped the tears from my eyes, knowing
that if somehow, somewhere my mom
ended up in a similar situation I would
want someone to give her a flower.
Grow up.
The woman's face floated through my
mind and I remembered all the things
my mom has done. All the free SAT
classes, college nights and financial aid
help she's given to kids from my high

school who don't have moms like mine
who know how the college application
system works. All the years she's
coached soccer there and taught English
at the community center. All the after
noons and nights spent giving time to
ungrateful teenagers like me, who never
say thank you and are rarely courteous.
And I pictured her as she is now, sit
ting on our patio, which she's converted
into a veritable coroner's office of man
nequins, limbs strewn across the
cement, waiting to be turned into
Jamaicans for our high school's Grad
Night party. A dozen papier-mache par
rots squawking to be painted. A couple
hundred hours' work for which she will
only get a "Why do you do this if your
kids are already graduated?"
Momma, didn't mean to make you
cry.
Then I pictured one of her mottos —
practice random acts of kindness and
senseless beauty — which always made
me roll my eyes. I told my dad later
about the candy-store incident, but I
couldn't tell my mom. All I could hope
was that somebody would say thank you
to my mom for me. Somebody would
show appreciation for me. Somebody
would give her a flower for me.
She likes gardenias.

As the other saleswomen stared in confu
sion and the woman flashed me a bewil
dered look, I turned and exited the store.
Don't talk to strangers.
Nearly four innocent pedestrians
were crushed as I bolted from the mall
to get away from the crowd and be
alone. Nearly two hours passed by before
I stopped pacing around the Medical
Center on my walk home and decided to
go back to the reality of my dorm room.
Nearly my entire sleeve got wet as I
wiped the tears from my eyes, knowing
that if somehow, somewhere my mom
ended up in a similar situation I would
want someone to give her a flower.
Grow up.
The woman's face floated through my
mind and I remembered all the things
my mom has done. All the free SAT
classes, college nights and financial aid
help she's given to kids from my high

school who don't have moms like mine
who know how the college application
system works. All the years she's
coached soccer there and taught English
at the community center. All the after
noons and nights spent giving time to
ungrateful teenagers like me, who never
say thank you and are rarely courteous.
And I pictured her as she is now, sit
ting on our patio, which she's converted
into a veritable coroner's office of man
nequins, limbs strewn across the
cement, waiting to be turned into
Jamaicans for our high school's Grad
Night party. A dozen papier-mache par
rots squawking to be painted. A couple
hundred hours' work for which she will
only get a "Why do you do this if your
kids are already graduated?"
Momma, didn't mean to make you
cry.
Then I pictured one of her mottos —
practice random acts of kindness and
senseless beauty — which always made
me roll my eyes. I told my dad later
about the candy-store incident, but I
couldn't tell my mom. All I could hope
was that somebody would say thank you
to my mom for me. Somebody would
show appreciation for me. Somebody
would give her a flower for me.
She likes gardenias.

SUE WAS THE MOST beautiful
woman I'd ever seen. There she
stood, behind the counter of See's
Candies, blondish-gray hair gently fram
ing her powdered face and huge eyes. Set
against the Pine-Sol sterility of the
candy shop, smiling awkwardly and
struggling through a thick European
accent. Couched in a white and black
smock to complement the white tile and
black countertops that held white boxes
of chocolates tied with black ribbons.
As I set my bag of lollipops down in
front of the register, she fatiguedly
brushed her hair out of her face and anx
iously began searching for the price of the
candy, looking up at me in fright as she
couldn't find the tag. Anxiously watched
me nod and smile and walk across the
store to retrieve a box with a correspond
ing price tag. Anxiously punched the
number in with her index finger, relaying
the total in an apologetic tone.
Relax, we're all friends here.
With a clang of the cash drawer, her
embarrassment washed away as she
struggled to find my 60 cents. Struggled
as she exasperatedly handed me six
dimes out of the full drawer. Struggled to
find the right size bag. Struggled to avoid
the jostlings of the other late-to-middle
aged women behind the counter. Strug
gled to give me the plastic good-bye jingle

as I took my bag, told her to have a good
day and left the obscenely clean store.
Please come again.
I walked outside into the suffocating
poshness of the shopping center, with its
decadent flowers and stylishly clothed
mother-daughter patron tag teams all
sporting the latest innovation in Italian
shoe fashion. I looked around at all the
yuppie mothers, pushing their babies in
yuppie strollers. I sat down near a foun
tain to watch the teenage girls grudging
ly pacing in with their mothers, off to
buy acceptable clothing free of holes,
unflattering design and dreary colors.
And I thought about the beautiful
woman back in the candy store, well into
her 60s. Frantically working and miss
ing the sunlight. Frantically maneuver
ing the cash register, answering the tele
phone in broken English and describing
the fillings of different dark-chocolate
monstrosities. Frantically catering to
unforgiving customers looking for merci
lessly snappy service.
The show must go on.
I walked from store to store, basking
in the joys of wretched excess, but I just
couldn't get this woman off my mind.
Sad woman. Sad situation. Sad store.
She shouldn't be there, I grimaced.
She should be sitting out in front of the
fountain reading a good book. She
should be in a park watching the clouds

dance by. She should be somewhere she
is appreciated. Where people smile at her
and she is used to that. Somewhere I
would like my mother to be.
Take my hand.
I pictured my mom, sitting behind some
lousy counter, her soul crushed under the
weight of bridge mixes, toffees and hurried
orders from impatient customers. My
mom, eyes as distressed as the eyes of this
woman, hands as shaky as this woman's,
smile as strained as this woman's.
I zig-zagged my way through the foot
traffic, striding past the gold-card wield
ing throng. I quickly turned into the
shop I was looking for, as the saleswom
en looked up at me — clothed in black
from my shoes to my baseball cap.
Just let me explain.
All I needed, I asked, was a flower. No,
not a rose. I needed a flower for someone
and it had to speak for itself. No it
wasn't a secret-pal gift. It was for some
one I didn't know and wouldn't ever
know, I stammered. Someone working in
the candy store who deserved a flower.
The manager pointed out a big, pink,
waxy flower that didn't exactly spell
magic, but didn't say flower-pot-defiler.
She encased it in thick glossy plastic, tied
a pink ribbon around it, took my money
and went puzzledly back to her ferns.
A rose is a rose is a rose.
And as I neared the store, I got a little

nervous. What would she say? What
would her reaction be? What would she
think of some woman off the street
handing her a large, obtrusive flower?
I walked into the store and got in line.
I shuffled up to the counter as she asked
if she could help me, not remembering
that I had even been there moments ear
lier. I took the flower out from behind my
back, smiled and handed it to her, telling
her she reminded me of my mom and
that she seemed like a beautiful person.
