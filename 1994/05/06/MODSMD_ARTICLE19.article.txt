## Baseball seeks to rebound vs. UCLA Cardinal resumes Pac-10 action with home series against Bruins 
### Andy Eiser Senior staff writer 
The No. 13 Cardinal baseball
team hopes to avoid a spoiler as it
enters this weekend's series with
UCLA at Sunken Diamond.
After a disastrous week away
from Pacific 10 Conference
Southern Division action, Stan
ford (31-20, 17-7 in the Six-Pac)
faces a Bruins team that has
already affected the conference
standings by taking a game apiece
from contenders USC and Ari
zona State in the last two weeks.
The front-running Cardinal
stands a scant one-half game
ahead of both the Trojans and
Sun Devils, while UCLA (16-31,
8-16) is playing out the string and
clinging to fifth place, nine games
off the pace.
Stanford controls its own des
tiny by virtue of being two games
ahead of its competition in the
loss column. This weekend will be
key for the Cardinal as it attempts
to rebound from four losses in five
non-conference outings over the
last nine days.
"I look for us to come out fired
up against UCLA," said freshman
reliever Tom Reimers, who sur
rendered a dramatic lOth-inning

base hit Tuesday in Stanford's 2-1
loss to San Jose State.
Having won 12 of its last 15
Six-Pac games, the Cardinal
should find motivation in its mis
sion to win the conference title
and possibly earn the right to host
College World Series regional play
later this month.
"The ball is in our court," said
sophomore third baseman Brian
Dallimore. "Every series, our goal
is to go out and sweep. If we do
that, we know that we're in a good
position no matter what anyone
else does."
Attempting to improve on a
March trip to Los Angeles in
which the Cardinal took two of
three from the Bruins in Jackie
Robinson Stadium, Stanford
stands behind a pitching staff
that rises to the occasion in con
ference games. In 24 Six-Pac deci
sions, Cardinal hurlers have com
piled a 17-7 record and an out
standing 3.18 earned-run aver
age, a vast improvement over a
14-13 mark and 4.33 ERA outside
the Six-Pac.
The same trend holds for
UCLA, but the numbers are
nowhere near as remarkable.
While Bruins pitchers own an 8-
16 conference record with an

accompanying 4.85 ERA, they are
just 8-15 in other decisions and
hold an inflated 5.30 cumulative
ERA.
With an opportunity to crank
up an offense that has been stag
nant of late, Stanford brings to
the plate senior designated hitter
Nate Olmstead, whose .400 Six-
Pac average is 36 points ahead of

his .364 overall clip. Junior sec
ond baseman Jed Hansen and
sophomore center fielder Cale
Carter show similar prowess, as
Hansen hits 24 points better (.344
to .320) and Carter 23 points bet
ter (.311 to .288) in conference
play.
"I just remember what it's like
when I'm hitting well and visual

ize that," Carter said. "We have to
put these past few games aside
now and focus on the weekend."
The weekend starts today at
2:30 p.m., when Cardinal sopho
more Dan Reed (9-3) takes the hill
against UCIJ\ freshman Nick St.
George (2-6). Action starts at 1
p.m. both tomorrow and Sunday,
with probable respective matchups

featuring Stanford sophomore
Todd Bartels (5-3) against Bruins
sophomore Brian Stephenson (3-4)
and Cardinal freshman Jason Mid
dlebrook (6-1) against UCLA
senior Dan Kramer (3-1).
All three contests may be heard
live on KZSU (90.1 KM), with
Loren Long and Steve Brown
manning the mikes.
