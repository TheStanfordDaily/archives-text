# Empty stomachs, brimming hearts
## Fasters stand firm 
### Linda Friedlieb Editorial staff 
Senior Julia Gonzalez Luna said
that when she told her dad about
the hunger strike she was plan

ning, he asked her, "Why do you
want to go through another hunger
when you went through so many
growing up?"
"I feel it in my heart," declared
the public policy major from Bur
bank, Calif. "It's a whole mess of
things I can't say in one paragraph.
... It's coming to terms with [the
fact that | because of the way I look
and the way I speak, I'm not ac
cepted."
Wrapped in blankets in the
shadowy interior of a tent in the
Quad yesterday evening, Gonzalez
Luna joined her three fellow fasters
in talking about the ups and downs
of hunger strike, which is currently
in its third day.
All four Chicana students say
they are resolved to continue fast
ing until the University adminis
tration gives in to their demands to
ban grapes, begin a Chicano studies
program, find a position for outgo
ing Casa Zapata resident fellow Ce
cilia Burciaga and create a commu
nity center in East Palo Alto.
"I've grown up with the senti
ment 'if you're not happy, change
it.' My parents came over from
Mexico. Obviously they didn't like
it and they changed it," said
junior Tamara Alvarado, a Span
ish major. "I'm not leaving. I have
every right to have the type of
education I feel I need to work in
the outside world."
All four clutched bottles of
water to combat dehydration as
they discussed the shifting emo
tions of their fast. Every once in a
while, friends and fellow fasters
poked their heads in the tent to
ask if they needed more water or
if they felt OK.
"Just breaking the news to my
parents, that was the hardest
thing I've done," said faster Eva
Silva, a senior human biology
major from Salinas, Calif., whose
parents are field workers. Silva
said her parents and siblings plan
to come to Stanford today.
The four students emphasized
the importance of their families —
both as motivators and support
ers. During yesterday's noontime
rally, sophomore human biology
major Elvira Prieto said she was
fasting in part for her younger sis
ter Linda, a freshman, as well as
other students and generations to
come. Prieto's words caused her
sister to burst into tears.
Prieto's parents are farm work
ers in the San Joaquin Valley and
she worked with them in the fields
until coming to Stanford. "It's
about justice and it's about equal
rights for people who are suffer
ing," she said of the strike.
And last night a gray-haired
woman just off the plane from
San Diego embraced Alvarado in
a bear-like hug before they each
burst into tears. Hilda Alvarado,
Tamara's mother, said she
couldn't stay away.
"It's hard. It really hurts very,
very deep in my heart," she said,
touching her heart. "My people,
my love .... they're my family
and I'm here for them."

The only reason you
feel hungry is your
stomach growls.
Even though we've
slept, we're really
fatigued.'
— Tamara Alvarado

Council of Presidents — has been
at the campsite since Wednesday,
lending support to her sister.
"I didn't want to give my mom
any more grief," said Vanessa
Alvarado, explaining why she
wasn't participating in the fast.
"If there was anything else I
could do (to help), I would," she
said. "If I could cry right now, I
would — but I don't have the

strength right now."
Despite the fast, the strikers
say they are still very concerned
about academics. According to
Tamara Alvarado, some profes
sors have brought their classes
out to the tent area while sympa
thizers are attending other class
es to provide them with notes.
The women have not returned
to their dorm since the strike began
Wednesday morning. The four said
they packed some necessities to
bring to the Quad — toothpaste,
sweaters and blankets. Gonzalez
Luna said she also packed "a lot of
psychological things, pictures of my
family and small toys."
"I brought my personal blan
kets and toys. I've had this blan
ket since I was 11," Alvarado
declared, wrapping the multicol
ored cloth closer to her. "And I
brought my mom."
Gonzalez Luna said the fasters
appreciate all of the support

they've received — even if it some
times gets tiresome being asked
how you feel every five minutes.
"The only reason you feel hun
gry is your stomach growls,"
Alvarado said. "Even though
we've slept, we're really
fatigued."
One male stuck his head in the
tent during the afternoon and
asked the fasters if they needed
anything to read or do, according
to Gonzalez Luna, who added
that they jokingly asked for copies
of "Esquire" or "Glamour" and
some cards. "Later he busted
back in here and said 'here you
go'. ... I didn't think he was
going to come back."
According to Gonzalez Luna,
the bottom line comes down to
achieving their goals of getting
the administration to fulfill their
demands.
"Then we can eat," she said.
"We're dreaming about food."

es to provide them with notes.
The women have not returned
to their dorm since the strike began
Wednesday morning. The four said
they packed some necessities to
bring to the Quad — toothpaste,
sweaters and blankets. Gonzalez
Luna said she also packed "a lot of
psychological things, pictures of my
family and small toys."
"I brought my personal blan
kets and toys. I've had this blan
ket since I was 11," Alvarado
declared, wrapping the multicol
ored cloth closer to her. "And I
brought my mom."
Gonzalez Luna said the fasters
appreciate all of the support

they've received — even if it some
times gets tiresome being asked
how you feel every five minutes.
"The only reason you feel hun
gry is your stomach growls,"
Alvarado said. "Even though
we've slept, we're really
fatigued."
One male stuck his head in the
tent during the afternoon and
asked the fasters if they needed
anything to read or do, according
to Gonzalez Luna, who added
that they jokingly asked for copies
of "Esquire" or "Glamour" and
some cards. "Later he busted
back in here and said 'here you
go'. ... I didn't think he was
going to come back."
According to Gonzalez Luna,
the bottom line comes down to
achieving their goals of getting
the administration to fulfill their
demands.
"Then we can eat," she said.
"We're dreaming about food."

Two students comfort freshman Linda Prieto after she heard her older sister Elvira dedicate her partic
ipation in the hunger strike to Linda and future generations of students.
Senior Julia Gonzalez Luna said
that when she told her dad about
the hunger strike she was plan

ning, he asked her, "Why do you
want to go through another hunger
when you went through so many
growing up?"
"I feel it in my heart," declared
the public policy major from Bur
bank, Calif. "It's a whole mess of
things I can't say in one paragraph.
... It's coming to terms with [the
fact that | because of the way I look
and the way I speak, I'm not ac
cepted."
Wrapped in blankets in the
shadowy interior of a tent in the
Quad yesterday evening, Gonzalez
Luna joined her three fellow fasters
in talking about the ups and downs
of hunger strike, which is currently
in its third day.
All four Chicana students say
they are resolved to continue fast
ing until the University adminis
tration gives in to their demands to
ban grapes, begin a Chicano studies
program, find a position for outgo
ing Casa Zapata resident fellow Ce
cilia Burciaga and create a commu
nity center in East Palo Alto.
"I've grown up with the senti
ment 'if you're not happy, change
it.' My parents came over from
Mexico. Obviously they didn't like
it and they changed it," said
junior Tamara Alvarado, a Span
ish major. "I'm not leaving. I have
every right to have the type of
education I feel I need to work in
the outside world."
All four clutched bottles of
water to combat dehydration as
they discussed the shifting emo
tions of their fast. Every once in a
while, friends and fellow fasters
poked their heads in the tent to
ask if they needed more water or
if they felt OK.
"Just breaking the news to my
parents, that was the hardest
thing I've done," said faster Eva
Silva, a senior human biology
major from Salinas, Calif., whose
parents are field workers. Silva
said her parents and siblings plan
to come to Stanford today.
The four students emphasized
the importance of their families —
both as motivators and support
ers. During yesterday's noontime
rally, sophomore human biology
major Elvira Prieto said she was
fasting in part for her younger sis
ter Linda, a freshman, as well as
other students and generations to
come. Prieto's words caused her
sister to burst into tears.
Prieto's parents are farm work
ers in the San Joaquin Valley and
she worked with them in the fields
until coming to Stanford. "It's
about justice and it's about equal
rights for people who are suffer
ing," she said of the strike.
And last night a gray-haired
woman just off the plane from
San Diego embraced Alvarado in
a bear-like hug before they each
burst into tears. Hilda Alvarado,
Tamara's mother, said she
couldn't stay away.
"It's hard. It really hurts very,
very deep in my heart," she said,
touching her heart. "My people,
my love .... they're my family
and I'm here for them."
Alvarado's sister, Vanessa —
a member of the newly elected

The only reason you
feel hungry is your
stomach growls.
Even though we've
slept, we're really
fatigued.'
— Tamara Alvarado

Council of Presidents — has been
at the campsite since Wednesday,
lending support to her sister.
"I didn't want to give my mom
any more grief," said Vanessa
Alvarado, explaining why she
wasn't participating in the fast.
"If there was anything else I
could do (to help), I would," she
said. "If I could cry right now, I
would — but I don't have the

strength right now."
Despite the fast, the strikers
say they are still very concerned
about academics. According to
Tamara Alvarado, some profes
sors have brought their classes
out to the tent area while sympa
thizers are attending other class
es to provide them with notes.
