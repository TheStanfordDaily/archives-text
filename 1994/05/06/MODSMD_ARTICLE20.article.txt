# Tracksters ready to sprint for Big Meet title

Hard work pays off.
And it sure did last weekend for the Stanford
track and field squad at the first California State Col
legiate track meet held at UCLA.
The women's team scored 75 points, placing third
behind UCLA's 168 and Fresno State's 93. On the
men's side, the Cardinal finished fifth with 64
points, behind California with 132 points and
UCLA's and Fresno State's shared-red ribbon with
124 points followed by a fourth place USC with 109.
Last weekend was packed with many Cardinal
personal bests, as well as school records. After these
strong showings, the team is prepared for its next
challenge in this weekend's Big Meet at Cal.
"Last weekend was filled with good performances
on both the [men's and women's] sides as well as
excellent individual performances," said head coach
Vin Lannana.
One of those highlight performances on the men's
side came from sophomore Rene Rodriguez, who
broke a seven-year-old record in the 400 meters. He
red-ribboned with a clocking of 45.85 seconds,

replacing Alan Sheats' 46.08 seconds.
"I was happy to be a part of that milestone," he
said. "But I knew I was capable of getting close to low
46s so it wasn't a huge surprise."
In the distance races, freshman J.J. White also
challenged one of Stanford's school records, but fell
short of the freshman mark in the 5,000 meters by a
mere second. White crossed the finish line second
with a 14:23 showing just missing James Smite's
1981 mark of 14:22.0.
"1 tried to stay focused all through the race and it
apparently worked," White said. "I just paced myself
to stay in the front pack and to never fall out of it."
White did indeed keep close to his task, and by the
last lap, the lead pack had narrowed down to just two
runners. White hung on as best as he could, knowing
that his competitor was a four-minute miler with a
powerful 400-meter kick.
"I just couldn't let him go out of my sight," he
said.
And by keeping up, White automatically earned a
spot in the Pacific 10 Conference Championships, to
be held May 20-21 at Washington State University.
Highlighting the field events, junior co-captain
Dave Popejoy finished in his typically strong manner,

earning a red ribbon with a hammer throw of 214 feet.
"Dave makes the men's team more confident as
he always begins the meet with a good throw racking
up many points," said senior hammer thrower Deb
bie Templeton.
The women's team, typically dominated by the
distance runners, experienced a pleasant shift as
senior co-captain Jen McCormick let the javelin fly
for a nation's third best landing.
"Debbie and I were fooling around the day before
the meet and we noticed that we were throwing very
far," McCormick said. "We thought that the mark
ings were wrong until much to our surprise they
were accurate. UCLA is a nice place to throw and the
competition was challenging."
Clearly not quite challenging enough, however, as
McCormick placed a comfortable first with a javelin
flight of 178 feet, 10 inches. This performance auto
matically awards McCormick with a trip to the Unit
ed States Nationals to be held this summer at
Knoxville, Tenn.
"1 was psyched," she said. "After I threw it I knew
it was going to land far."
But the distance team still
made its presence known as
senior Louise Watson glided
through the 5,000 meters in a
time of 16:37.74, good for a sec
ond place finish.
"This performance made me
realize that we (the women's dis
tance team) are pretty much in
front of things," Watson said. "I
think that we should have Cal
pretty much wrapped up."
Similar to Watson, the team is
impatiently waiting for this week
end's one-on-one showdown with
Cal.

With a 8-6 women's record ver
sus California which includes vic
tories in the teams' four most
recent meetings, Lannana is con
fident about the women's chances
to extend their winning streak.
On the men's side, the squad is
trying to overcome a 22-year los
ing streak in the Big Meet. The
team's chances look promising
this year as senior co-captain
Gary Stolz, one of the nation's top
distance runners, will finally
return to the track after a half
year absence due to a strained
Achilles tendon.
"I know I am not 100 percent
but I know I am ready to go out
there and beat Cal," Stolz said.
"Even though we are going in
with a bad record, some years we

came very close and I know that
they are afraid to lose it every sin
gle year."
Senior long jumper Jason
Robinson remembers one of those
close Big Meets.
"I remember in my freshman
year where it came down to the
final event and we let it slip
through," he said. "But this is my
senior year and we won't let them
go that easily, trust me."
Regardless of past finishes, no
one expects to emerge the victor
without a typical Stanford-Cal
fight.
"We have to have everyone
stay on top of things in order to
pull this one out," Lannana said.
"But believe me, this weekend
will be very exciting and close."

think that we should have Cal
pretty much wrapped up."
Similar to Watson, the team is
impatiently waiting for this week
end's one-on-one showdown with
Cal.

With a 8-6 women's record ver
sus California which includes vic
tories in the teams' four most
recent meetings, Lannana is con
fident about the women's chances
to extend their winning streak.
On the men's side, the squad is
trying to overcome a 22-year los
ing streak in the Big Meet. The
team's chances look promising
this year as senior co-captain
Gary Stolz, one of the nation's top
distance runners, will finally
return to the track after a half
year absence due to a strained
Achilles tendon.
"I know I am not 100 percent
but I know I am ready to go out
there and beat Cal," Stolz said.
"Even though we are going in
with a bad record, some years we

came very close and I know that
they are afraid to lose it every sin
gle year."
Senior long jumper Jason
Robinson remembers one of those
close Big Meets.
"I remember in my freshman
year where it came down to the
final event and we let it slip
through," he said. "But this is my
senior year and we won't let them
go that easily, trust me."
Regardless of past finishes, no
one expects to emerge the victor
without a typical Stanford-Cal
fight.
"We have to have everyone
stay on top of things in order to
pull this one out," Lannana said.
"But believe me, this weekend
will be very exciting and close."
Hard work pays off.
And it sure did last weekend for the Stanford
track and field squad at the first California State Col
legiate track meet held at UCLA.
The women's team scored 75 points, placing third
behind UCLA's 168 and Fresno State's 93. On the
men's side, the Cardinal finished fifth with 64
points, behind California with 132 points and
UCLA's and Fresno State's shared-red ribbon with
124 points followed by a fourth place USC with 109.
Last weekend was packed with many Cardinal
personal bests, as well as school records. After these
strong showings, the team is prepared for its next
challenge in this weekend's Big Meet at Cal.
"Last weekend was filled with good performances
on both the [men's and women's] sides as well as
excellent individual performances," said head coach
Vin Lannana.
One of those highlight performances on the men's
side came from sophomore Rene Rodriguez, who
broke a seven-year-old record in the 400 meters. He
red-ribboned with a clocking of 45.85 seconds,

replacing Alan Sheats' 46.08 seconds.
"I was happy to be a part of that milestone," he
said. "But I knew I was capable of getting close to low
46s so it wasn't a huge surprise."
In the distance races, freshman J.J. White also
challenged one of Stanford's school records, but fell
short of the freshman mark in the 5,000 meters by a
mere second. White crossed the finish line second
with a 14:23 showing just missing James Smite's
1981 mark of 14:22.0.
"1 tried to stay focused all through the race and it
apparently worked," White said. "I just paced myself
to stay in the front pack and to never fall out of it."
White did indeed keep close to his task, and by the
last lap, the lead pack had narrowed down to just two
runners. White hung on as best as he could, knowing
that his competitor was a four-minute miler with a
powerful 400-meter kick.
"I just couldn't let him go out of my sight," he
said.
And by keeping up, White automatically earned a
spot in the Pacific 10 Conference Championships, to
be held May 20-21 at Washington State University.
Highlighting the field events, junior co-captain
Dave Popejoy finished in his typically strong manner,

earning a red ribbon with a hammer throw of 214 feet.
"Dave makes the men's team more confident as
he always begins the meet with a good throw racking
up many points," said senior hammer thrower Deb
bie Templeton.
The women's team, typically dominated by the
distance runners, experienced a pleasant shift as
senior co-captain Jen McCormick let the javelin fly
for a nation's third best landing.
"Debbie and I were fooling around the day before
the meet and we noticed that we were throwing very
far," McCormick said. "We thought that the mark
ings were wrong until much to our surprise they
were accurate. UCLA is a nice place to throw and the
competition was challenging."
Clearly not quite challenging enough, however, as
McCormick placed a comfortable first with a javelin
flight of 178 feet, 10 inches. This performance auto
matically awards McCormick with a trip to the Unit
ed States Nationals to be held this summer at
Knoxville, Tenn.
"1 was psyched," she said. "After I threw it I knew
it was going to land far."
But the distance team still
made its presence known as
senior Louise Watson glided
through the 5,000 meters in a
time of 16:37.74, good for a sec
ond place finish.
"This performance made me
realize that we (the women's dis
tance team) are pretty much in
front of things," Watson said. "I
think that we should have Cal
pretty much wrapped up."
Similar to Watson, the team is
impatiently waiting for this week
