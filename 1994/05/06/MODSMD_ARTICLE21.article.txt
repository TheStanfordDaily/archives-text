# Cycling to pedal in Western championships
## Stanford's sights set on top 3 finishes 
### Joseph Hei 
The Stanford cycling team will
ride hard in an attempt to nab the
Western Collegiate Cycling Con
ference championships this week
end in Reno, Nev. Stanford is
counting on a top-three finish as
the best teams which emerge
from this conference, the
strongest in the nation, tradition
ally place in the top five or six at
nationals, held later this month.
The championships will con
sist of three races: a road race and
team time trials on Saturday and
a criterium on Sunday.
"Our goal is to pile up a lot of
points in all three races," coach
Art Walker said. "We can't afford
to neglect any of them."
Stanford must earn as many
points as possible in its bid to
unseat Cal Poly-SLO and UC-San
Diego, both of whom lead Stan
ford by a meager 14 points in the
season-long count going into the
championships.
Cal Poly-SLO is favored to stay
number one in the conference by
force of their sheer number of rid
ers. However, UC-San Diego is
more of an unknown factor. The
Tritons race in the southern divi
sion of the western conference so
Stanford has not had many
opportunities to size them up.
"I would think that we're a
better team," said co-captain
senior Mike Cummer. "They're
racing in a weaker division, so
they've gathered up a lot of
points. The one time 1 raced
against them I wasn't all that
impressed."
Grad student Dario Falquier,
who has raced more extensively
against UC-San Diego, provided a
more tempered perspective.
"They seem to have really good
sprinters," he said. "Our sprint
ers are going to have to match
them in the criterium. There's

going to be a lot of suspense there,
that's going to be a good race."
Sunday's criterium is an event
where large teams can score well
by having many riders who draft
for each other. Stanford has
proven, most recently in last
weekend's criterium, that it can
win despite numerical disadvan
tages with tremendous team
work.
The Cardinal will most likely
dominate Saturday's road race.
The road course will be a grueling
series of hills that defy team tac
tics — the riders cannot draft
climbing because they fight gravi
ty instead of wind.
"It's definitely a good weekend
for the climbers," Cummer said.
"Our good climbers are Dario,
fgradl Bill Lloyd and (junior)
John Schlesinger. I'm personally
a pretty strong climber and I hope
to do pretty well."
Falquier, who has turned in
impressive road performances all
season, described the course and
also identified it as a personal
objective.
"The road race course is going
to be a real grunt session,"
Falquier said. "It's going to be
every person for themselves. I'm
not a sprinter so my best chances
are in the road race. I'm going to
stay in front and watch the pack
disintegrate in back; hopefully
there will be more of our guys left
in front."
The Stanford women are
expected to dominate in the road
race as well, an event they have
routinely controlled all year.
"The women will do extremely
well," Walker said. "They really
should clean up."
Cummer also praised the Stan
ford women highly and credited
them as the key contributors to a
strong season.

Graduate student Bill Lloyd leans In on the turn In the team's last home race. Both the men
and women will compete in the conference championships this weekend in Reno, Nev.
"The women are the backbone
of our team," Cummer said.
"They consistently score really
well and I don't see why that
won't happen this weekend."
The competition will be on the
watch for three women in particu
lar, junior Tracy Timms, the 1992
National Collegiate Road Race
Champion, senior Nicole Freed
man, the number-one rider in the

conference and grad student Bet
tina Romer, last year's Triple
Crown winner.
Despite not having as many
riders as other teams, both the
women and the men also expect to
do well in the team time trials, or
triple-T's.
"We are the reigning National
Champions in the triple T's,"
Timms said. "We think we will
have a very good chance at doing
very well in it."
Falquier gave his evaluation of
the men's situation in the triple-
Ts.

"We hope to do really well in
the triple-T's," he said. "If we
can, then there is a strong chance
of medaling at nationals."
Above all, conference champi
onships will be a time for all the
riders to work towards personal
season-ending goals, especially
non-A level riders such as Berke
ley Burbank, Kelley Herndon and
Chris Carlson, who will not be
going to nationals.
"We want to help riders enjoy
the culmination of their season,
to have some really good races for
themselves," Walker said.
