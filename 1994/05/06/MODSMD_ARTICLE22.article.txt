# Crew to stroke with the best in Opening Day

Yachting season is right around the corner.
That's right, this weekend marks the begin
ning of yachting season in Seattle. In honor of
this event, the Stanford men's and women's
crew teams will travel to the University of
Washington to participate in the prestigious
Opening Day Races. The event is rather cere
monial, as private yachts will line the harbor
during the races, with a parade to follow.
"It's a huge spectator event, which is more
fun, but it's hard to keep focused with all of
those things going on," senior coxswain Mae
Tai said.
The regatta is an elite affair. This is the
first time the Stanford teams have been invit
ed in many years, and this honor is a reflec
tion of long term hard work and dedication.
"The University of Washington usually
invites the fastest crew in California, based on
fall and previous year racing," senior captain
Will Porteous said. "Just to be invited is a
complement."
The event is host to a diverse group of boats,
as shown by the Cardinal's competition which
includes the Dutch National Team, Washing
ton, Washington State and Orange Coast Col
lege. The competition will be stiff, and head
varsity women's coach Jocelvn McCandless
described the field as "some of the fastest crews
in the West, and probably in the nation."
The University of Washington is the shin
ing light, as it enjoys a hometown setting, and
the prestige of claiming last year's national
championship in the women's division.
After Saturday's Opening Day races, the
Cardinal will head south to Corvallis, Ore. to
meet Oregon State on Sunday before return
ing home. While Oregon State doesn't present
the same caliber team as the Cardinal will face
in Seattle, the team is not to be overlooked.
"You can't discount anyone, but we've
always been faster than them in the past," Tai
said. "It's great for racing experience and to
sharpen up our race plan. All in all it should
be a fun weekend."
A weekend filled with so many races
demands concentration and dedication from
all of its participants. The Stanford teams did
not race this past weekend, and thus have
focused on training for the upcoming events.
The women's team has been working on aer
obic conditioning and starts, according to
McCandless, whereas the men's varsity coach
Wieslaw Kudja said his team has "emphasized
the precision of the stroke and rowing together."
In his view, it's not the particulars that
matter.
"We've been working on strength, tech
nique, and endurance," Kudja said. "We put
them together and see how it fits into the
boat. Every regatta is a little bit of an
improvement. We hope that bv the most
important race things will be clicking."
While the University of Washington poses
a formidable threat, the Cardinal was able to
sweep Washington State during the Stanford
Regatta on April 24. 1 ight finishes are antici
pated this weekend and the excitement of the
events will add to the atmosphere.
We definitely took a hard loss against Cal
(at the Stanford Regatta), and it shook us up
emotionally," Porteous said. "We've put those
losses behind us however, and we're charged
up to meet Washington. In this sport we're
hitting our best speed only now, and hope to
be at our peak for the next month."
