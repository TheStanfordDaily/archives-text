# Few eateries serve grapes
## 
### Jim Luh Staff writer 
While protesters in the
Inner Quad have called for a
campus-wide grape boycott,
such an action would be for
the most part a symbolic ges
ture, as grapes are already
scarce on campus â€” both for
political and practical reasons.
"Our policy is that we pretty
much leave it up to the individu
al houses," said Melanie Jones-
Carter, operations manager for
University Dining Services.
"We will provide grapes if that
is the request of the house,"
Jones-Carter said. "We try to
stay out of the politics behind it."
In calling for the ban, the stu
dents have cited concerns about
mistreatment of migrant farm
workers, including the use of
pesticides they say are hazardous
to workers.
In response to the protest,
University President Gerhard
Casper has appointed Political
Science Prof. Luis Fraga to chair
a committee to re-examine the
current, decentralized policy on
grapes. In the late 1980s, former
University President Donald
Kennedy approved a policy
which did not order a boycott but
left the choice up to the individu
al eateries and residences.
Joline McQuillan, manager
for dining services in Florence
Moore Hall, said that grapes are
served in Flo Mo, but they come
from Chile, not California.
McQuillan said that situation
was due more to practical con
cerns than a specific policy.
"Grapes aren't in season (in
Californial when we have stu
dents," McQuillan said. "That's
the reality."
A representative of the San
Mateo County Agricultural Com
missioner's office said Califor
nia-grown grapes are available to
buyers roughly from late August
until October or November.
But even if the grapes used
are not grown in California,
other issues are at stake besides
the plight of Californian migrant
workers, according to graduate
student Rod Hernandez, a
spokesman for the protesters.
"It's a very complex issue,"
Hernandez said. "It has to do
with worker exploitation ... in
addition to health (andl environ
mental racism."
The protest and accompany
ing hunger strike have already

succeeded in driving grapes from
Xanadu and El Toro, one of the
Toyon Eating Clubs, who joined
the boycott after the protest
began on Wednesday.
Stern Dining Hall has been
unofficially grape-free for a
whilo, "out of respect" for resi
dents of Casa Zapata, said Carole
Miller, assistant manager of Din
ing Services at Stern.
Robert Kurchin, Dining Ser
vices manager for Roble Hall and
Lagunita Court, said that Roble
had been declared a grape-free
dorm by Roble residents before
the protest began. In Lagunita,
Kurchin said, grapes are served
only on rare occasions.
"1 get too much grief every
time I serve them," Kurchin
said.
Any grapes served there are
imported from Mexico or Chile,
Kurchin said. The Terrace, a
late-night cafe at the Toyon Eat
ing Clubs, also serves Chile
imported grapes.
Pat ricia Rodriguez, director of
catering for Bon Appetit, which
caters many University events,
said that she honors all requests
from event sponsors that grapes
not be served.
Rodriguez added that grapes
are sold rarely at Tresidder Cafe,
not for political reasons but due
to seasonal concerns and because
they are more difficult to sell
individually than items such as
bananas and apples.
Susan Peletta, manager of
Dining Service in Ricker Dining
Center, said that although Din
ing Service's policy dictates that
houses decide individually
whether to join the grape boy
cott, she is waiting for direction
from the central office before she
takes any action to remove
grapes from the menu at Ricker.
She said it would be unfair for
her to unilaterally ban grapes
from Ricker based on the con
cerns of a few students.
The protest against grapes
represents a rekindling of a
movement that gained promi
nence in the 1960s due to the
efforts of Cesar Chavez and the
United Farm Workers union.
The last major movement
against grapes at Stanford
occurred in the late 1980s.
