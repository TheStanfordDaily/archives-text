# Molding morals
## Stockdale discusses education's importance 
### Elizabeth Murtaugh Staff writer 
Discussing the role education plays in
shaping moral and personal character, re
tired Vice Adm. James Stockdale, a senior
research fellow at the Hoover Institution,
delivered a speech on "Character and
Conflict" last night at Memorial Church.
Sponsored by the Canterbury Episco
pal Chaplaincy at Stanford, Stockdale's
speech was the first annual Philip

Rhinelander Memorial Lecture on Educa
tion and Character.
Stockdale, 70, reflected on his "long,
deep friendship" with Rhinelander — a
former member of the Philosophy De
partment who played an integral role in
the establishment of the Chaplaincy.
Their friendship began in the 1960s
with a class Rhinelander taught titled
"The Problems of Good and Evil." The
class inspired Stockdale, then a
master's student in International
Relations, to explore many philo
sophical questions that would
prove to become his most power
ful and influential moral guides.
Over the course of the term,
Rhinelander and Stockdale devel
oped an intimate relationship
through weekly, individual tutor

ing sessions.
Among the muny lessons
Stockdale learned from
Rhinelander's "mental discipline
and incisive practicality" wjis that
"the challenge of education is not
to prepare students for success,
but rather for failure."
He went on to say that the
lessons he learned from
Rhinelander helped him endure
the most difficult period in his life
— his years as a prisoner of war in
Vietnam.
"Difficulties are what show

men's character," Stockdale
remarked.
Stockdale, perhaps best-known
as the running mate of former
presidential candidate Ross
Perot, detailed many painful
memories of the atrocities he and
his fellow prisoners were forced to
endure during their years in cap
tivity. Stockdale was a POW for
eight years, from 1965-73.
As the highest ranking naval
officer in his POW camp, Stock
dale was often called upon for
moral leadership.
"I didn't use a list of iron-clad
rules. I had to use all my inner
wits to make order out of chaos,"
he said.
Stockdale recalled several trea
tises of the ancient Greek stoic
Epictetus as powerful philosophi
cal beacons in learning how to
maintain self-respect in the face
of the degrading demands often
encountered in POW camps.
Stoicism played the most signifi
cant role in his attempts to find a
definition of good in an environ
ment of dehumanizing hate and
brutality, Stockdale said. His cur
rent research focuses on Greek phi
losophy and Stoicism in particular.
Realizing that he, like the rest of
mankind, is an actor assigned to a
role in "God's script" was an impor
tant step in Stockdale's process of
accepting the hardship, he said.
He also discussed the difficult
task of upholding a sense of self
respect while valuing the unity of
the group over the self.
"We had to become the center
of our own world. We had to
become our own heroes," Stock
dale said, drawing upon yet
another lesson he learned from
Rhinelander — that, in the face of
adversity, one must "refound
[one'sl own civilization."
His resilient reliance on will
power, Stockdale stressed, was
the ultimate key to his survival.
Stockdale's speech was
attended by about 50 people. The
Stanford Canterbury Foundation
sponsors various activities,
including student dinner discus
sions, worship services and a
speaker series.
