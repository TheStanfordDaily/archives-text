# Cohen to take job at Penn St.

### Julie Makinen Senior staff writer 
After 10 years on the Farm, Assoc. Communication
Prof. Jeremy Cohen will leave Stanford this summer
to become the associate dean for undergraduate edu
cation at Pennsylvania State University's school of
communications.
Cohen and his wife, Catherine Jordan, have been
resident fellows at Lantana House for two years. Jor
dan is the resident office coordinator at Lagunita
Court.
"I'm running away from home," joked Cohen, who
is well-known for his devotion to undergraduate edu
cation, teaching and public service. His new position,
he says, will allow him to pursue these interests to the
fullest.
"One of the problems at Stanford ... is that teach
ing undergrads does not have strong social support,"
said Cohen. "There, I'll be able to implement things
structurally that I can only do here on a personal
level."
At Penn State, Cohen will oversee a school with
more than 1,200 students and 50 faculty. "It's a place
where I can work on mentoring a fairly young facul
ty," said Cohen.
Cohen's departure leaves a gaping hole in Stan
ford's Communication Department, said Department
Chair Donald Roberts. Cohen normally carries a
heavy teaching load in the depart
ment, including Mass Media and
Society (Communication 1); Mass
Media Law, Communication and
Law; First Amendment Theory;
and a teaching seminar for doctor
al students. He also teaches a
course titled "The Process and
Practice of Public Service," which
is cross-listed in several depart
ments.
"It will certainly put a lot of
pressure on the department,"
Roberts said. "He's had a central
role in our undergraduate pro
gram."
Others in the department

expressed regret at Cohen's
departure. "It's tough to see a col
league of that caliber go," said
Communication Prof. Steven
Chaffee. "He'll be missed, particu
larly by undergraduates, but this
position is a move up for him . . .
in the past he's had offers from
other schools, but this one seems
made for him."
Acting Co-director of Residen
tial Education Ann Porteus called
the departure of Cohen and Jor
dan "a tremendous loss for Res
Ed" but added that she's happy to
see Cohen "go to a place where he
can work with issues that are close
to his heart."
Res Ed is in the process of fill
ing the resident fellow position
that will be vacated in Lantana,
said Porteus. The public service
focus will continue, she added.
