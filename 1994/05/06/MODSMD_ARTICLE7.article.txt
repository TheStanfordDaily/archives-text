### Colleen Krueger Staff writer 
Predicting a dramatic shift from inpa
tient to outpatient services, Stanford
Medical Center administrators discussed
how their facilities will deal with the
changing face of medical aire through the
year 2000 at a public meeting last night.
After being asked by the City of Palo
Alto to give the community an idea of
where the Medical Center will be heading
over the next few years in terms of facili
ties and transportation, officials present
ed an overview of their joint planning

process and facilities needs to the Palo
Alto Comprehensive Planning Advisory
Committee.
The shift toward outpatient cart* is pro
jected to place more demands on the Med
ical Center, and Stanford officials tenta
tively proposed creating new hospital
space, a new transportation system and
more ambulatory care facilities at last
night's meeting, which was attended by
about 40 people.
The Medical Center mav need to add up
to 400,000 square feet of new space to pro
vide quality health care more efficiently
with less stafi", said David Neuman, the

University's architect and director of
planning. Patient care currently occupies
1,723,000 square feet.
Neuman also introduced a proposal for
a multiple-choice circulation and trans
portation system, which would bring back
hospital shuttles as a way of linking the
Stanford arid Lucile Packard Children's
Hospitals and their parking facilities,
which may become more remote.
"We've tried to stress a cooperative,
transportation-oriented design ap
proach," he said.
