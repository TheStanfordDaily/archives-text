# Med Center plots its growth curve
## Larger building, new transportation system for Hospital 
### Colleen Krueger Staff writer 
Predicting a dramatic shift from inpa
tient to outpatient services, Stanford
Medical Center administrators discussed
how their facilities will deal with the
changing face of medical aire through the
year 2000 at a public meeting last night.
After being asked by the City of Palo
Alto to give the community an idea of
where the Medical Center will be heading
over the next few years in terms of facili
ties and transportation, officials present
ed an overview of their joint planning

process and facilities needs to the Palo
Alto Comprehensive Planning Advisory
Committee.
The shift toward outpatient cart* is pro
jected to place more demands on the Med
ical Center, and Stanford officials tenta
tively proposed creating new hospital
space, a new transportation system and
more ambulatory care facilities at last
night's meeting, which was attended by
about 40 people.
The Medical Center mav need to add up
to 400,000 square feet of new space to pro
vide quality health care more efficiently
with less stafi", said David Neuman, the

University's architect and director of
planning. Patient care currently occupies
1,723,000 square feet.
Neuman also introduced a proposal for
a multiple-choice circulation and trans
portation system, which would bring back
hospital shuttles as a way of linking the
Stanford arid Lucile Packard Children's
Hospitals and their parking facilities,
which may become more remote.
"We've tried to stress a cooperative,
transportation-oriented design ap
proach," he said.
Although staff may increase by
4 percent and outpatient care will
continue to grow, projected
increase in traffic on nearby roads
is expected to be minor, he said.
The center's projections are
being incorporated into the com
prehensive plan for Palo Alto,
which the city advisory group will
complete by September. In addi
tion, the plans will also be the
basis for a land-use entitlements
request the University plans to
submit to Palo Alto later in the
year.
While Stanford officials seemed
enthusiastic about the direction
health care may take, they
stressed that the changes the Med
ical Center has already implement
ed are taxing facilities and
resources.
"Right now, we're working to
extend our service to the commu
nity while cutting back on staff,"

said Melinda Mitchell, chief oper
ating officer for Stanford Hospital.
"So far, we haven't run into a
problem."
Mitchell emphasized that many
of the hospitals' changing strate
gies in medicine are attempts to
stay "on the cutting edge" of the
country's "health care revolu
tion."
"It's become increasingly
important for us to provide a full
spectrum of care for the communi
ty that we are becoming much
more responsible for," Mitchell
said.
Both hospitals are anticipating
an increasing need for surgical
facilities, as surgeries done on an
outpatient basis increased at Stan
ford Hospital by 15 percent last
year and are expected to increase
another 10 percent this year, said
Mitchell and Christopher Dawes,
vice president for operations at
Children's Hospital.
Also, changes in cancer and
children's care have made ambula
tory and home care much more
viable options, Mitchell said.
