An estimated 30,000 people
from around the country will be
streaming to Stanford this week
end to enjoy competition dancing,
good food, talking with old friends
and celebrating Native American
heritage.
The Stanford American Indian
Organization (SAIO) is puttingon
the 23rd annual student-run
Stanford Powwow this weekend,
with events including a five-kilo
meter run, authentic drum beats
and celebration of the event's
theme, "Honoring Indian
Women."
The Stanford Powwow is the
largest multicultural event on
campus and is one of the largest
powwows on the West Coast, at
tracting top national drummers
and dancers.
"This Powwow is unique be
cause there is more community
involvement and everyone is wel
come," said Wilson Pipesman, a
second-year law student and co
coordinator of the event."The
Stanford Powwow maintains a

small community flavor."
Powwows, which originated
among tribes of the Midwest
plains, are common celebrations
which take place weekly at differ
ent locations throughout the
country. Native Americans and
others attend powwows, mainly
for social purposes but also to
learn about the culture.
"A lot of people don't realize
what Indian culture is about,"
fifth-year senior Isabel Bourelle
said. "We want to promote our
own Indian tribe and educate peo
ple about the culture."
Powwows are often a time
when family members and old
friends unite to watch extrava
gant dance competitions, listen to
musicians and meet others. One
of the largest events at Stanford's
Powwow is a dance competition
which takes place throughout the
weekend. The contest is divided
according to age and category and
cash prizes will be awarded to the
winners.
Besides dancing and music fes
tivities, this year's Powwow will
focus on its theme "Honoring
Indian Women." Various Native
American women will be honored
Saturday morning for their
involvement and accomplish
ments.
"We want to recognize those
who have contributed to this com
munity and highlight them as
members of the community," said
Colin Hampson, a third-year law
student and co-coordinator of the
powwow.
Hampson said the main goal of
the Powwow is to ensure that
everyone has a good time. "Our
goal is to have a powwow that
people can come to and enjoy the
best dancers and music in a safe,
secure environment," Hampson
said. "For the Indians we want to
celebrate who they are, and for
the non-Indians we want to show
them an aspect of the Indian cul
ture that they haven't seen
before."
Pipesman added, "We want
people to feel it was worth it,"
especially the travelers who come
from Canada and around the
country.
Sophomore Trisha Moquino is
celebrating her second powwow
with her family from New Mexi
co. Her tribe, the Santo Domingo
Pueblo, does not celebrate pow
wows, holding their own cere
monies instead.
"For me, I get to meet a lot of

other Indian people and I get to
learn why people have powwows,"
said Moquino. "It's a social, very
warm and happy environment."
Organizers and participants
also hope to educate others about
the Native American culture.
Various school groups from
around the Bay Area will attend
the Powwow to learn about Indi
an culture from the dancers,
musicians and artisans.
Pipesman, who is from Okla
homa, said that powwows in the
Midwest are purely social events
because 95 percent of the partici
pants are Native American.
"Here (at Stanford) it has an
educational purpose not only to
the people who attend but to the
non-Indians on the committee,"
Pipesman said. "It's a learning
experience for those who haven't
been to the celebrations. We
want to give them a better
understanding of the people and
show them the beauty of the cul
ture."
For some people, this Powwow
carries a significance beyond edu
cational and social purposes.
"This is what I look forward to
every year," Bourelle said. "I put
my life on hold for this one week
end. It's when and where I feel
most comfortable at Stanford."
Others said they want to con
tinue to stress the importance of
their culture and to show that
they are still in existence.
"In the Bay Area people think
Indians are dead," Hampson said.
"The Powwow is a chance to let
people know we're still here,
growing and flourishing."
