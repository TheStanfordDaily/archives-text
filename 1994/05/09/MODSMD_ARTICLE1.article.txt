# Strike ends after three days, agreement reached
## Committees to look into possible grape boycott, Chicano Studies and EPA community center 
### Sarah Katz Editorial staff 
Ending three days of fasting and
protest, Chicano students and University
administrators hammered out an agree
ment late Friday night and hunger strikers
hauled their tents from the Quad Saturday
morning.
After hours of debate, protesters accept
ed a written statement from University
President Gerhard Casper and Provost
Condoleezza Rice that contained essential
ly the same concessions they had received
Wednesday, the first day of the strike.
"We now have a positive basis on which
to move forward," Casper told students
Saturday morning. "I should like to remind
us all that universities are very fragile in
stitutions because they are based solely on
the power of argument and reason —
though clearly, our feelings also play an im
portant role."
The settlement involves the creation of
committees to examine a possible ban on
grapes, explore the feasibility of a Chicano
Studies program and help students raise
funds for a community center in East Palo
Alto.
Casper and Rice also said they would
consider proposals for a program in Asian-
American Studies, recognized the impor
tance of Chicana administrator Cecilia
Burciaga, who was laid off in March, and
pledged to formulate a University response
to an incident at last week's Flicks where
students shouted and laughed during a
showing of "No Grapes," a short film about
migrant farm workers.
During an often tense ceremony on Sat

urday, Casper and Rice signed a copy of the
settlement. Despite the lack of new conces
sions in the final written agreement, stu
dents said they believed administrators
had made additional concrete promises.
In particular, senior Eva Silva, one of
four women who pledged to fast until all de
mands were met, told supporters that a
Chicano Studies program with three full
time faculty and a half-time director will be
up and running by fall of 1995.
"It's not exactly an oral agreement but
more like we understand the choice of
words in the document," said senior Gabi
Cervantes, one of the negotiators. But Cer
vantes admitted that Casper and Rice had
never actually committed themselves to
specific results or dates.
And Dean of Students Michael Jackson
said that "exactly on paper is what [Casper
and Ricel agreed to. . . . They didn't agree
to something in writing and then have
some sort of outside agenda. There was no
wink and nod."
While conceding that all their demands
were not granted, students said they were
pleased with what they had won. "We know
that what we came out with here is good for
our community and for the community at
Stanford," Cervantes said.
A democratic decision
At 8 p.m. Friday, members of the Chi
cano student group, MEChA, met in their
tent in the middle of the Quad to discuss
the statement they had received from
Casper and Rice earlier that day.
For an hour, strikers and supporters
