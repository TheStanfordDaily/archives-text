# Strike ends after three days, agreement reached
## Committees to look into possible grape boycott, Chicano Studies and EPA community center 
### Sarah Katz Editorial staff 
Ending three days of fasting and
protest, Chicano students and University
administrators hammered out an agree
ment late Friday night and hunger strikers
hauled their tents from the Quad Saturday
morning.
After hours of debate, protesters accept
ed a written statement from University
President Gerhard Casper and Provost
Condoleezza Rice that contained essential
ly the same concessions they had received
Wednesday, the first day of the strike.
"We now have a positive basis on which
to move forward," Casper told students
Saturday morning. "I should like to remind
us all that universities are very fragile in
stitutions because they are based solely on
the power of argument and reason —
though clearly, our feelings also play an im
portant role."
The settlement involves the creation of
committees to examine a possible ban on
grapes, explore the feasibility of a Chicano
Studies program and help students raise
funds for a community center in East Palo
Alto.
Casper and Rice also said they would
consider proposals for a program in Asian-
American Studies, recognized the impor
tance of Chicana administrator Cecilia
Burciaga, who was laid off in March, and
pledged to formulate a University response
to an incident at last week's Flicks where
students shouted and laughed during a
showing of "No Grapes," a short film about
migrant farm workers.
During an often tense ceremony on Sat

urday, Casper and Rice signed a copy of the
settlement. Despite the lack of new conces
sions in the final written agreement, stu
dents said they believed administrators
had made additional concrete promises.
In particular, senior Eva Silva, one of
four women who pledged to fast until all de
mands were met, told supporters that a
Chicano Studies program with three full
time faculty and a half-time director will be
up and running by fall of 1995.
"It's not exactly an oral agreement but
more like we understand the choice of
words in the document," said senior Gabi
Cervantes, one of the negotiators. But Cer
vantes admitted that Casper and Rice had
never actually committed themselves to
specific results or dates.
And Dean of Students Michael Jackson
said that "exactly on paper is what [Casper
and Ricel agreed to. . . . They didn't agree
to something in writing and then have
some sort of outside agenda. There was no
wink and nod."
While conceding that all their demands
were not granted, students said they were
pleased with what they had won. "We know
that what we came out with here is good for
our community and for the community at
Stanford," Cervantes said.
A democratic decision
At 8 p.m. Friday, members of the Chi
cano student group, MEChA, met in their
tent in the middle of the Quad to discuss
the statement they had received from
Casper and Rice earlier that day.
For an hour, strikers and supporters

held an emotional and often
heated debate over whether

they should accept the settle
ment that night or continue the
fast through the weekend.
"We were discussing it for a
very long time. There were
mixed feelings," Cervantes said.
Protesters said that the

demand for a ban on grapes was
the sticking point. "The grape
issue was not fully resolved,"
said Cervantes. "It was not
completely agreeable with the
way we wanted it done."
In the end, the matter was

put up to a vote. After two
results — rejected due to an
unusually high number of
abstentions and an unsure
hand count — the group of
about 35 finally voted, by a very
slim margin, to end the strike
that night.
While some may have dis
agreed with the decision to end
the strike, MEChA members
agreed to unanimously support
the result.
Though the four strikers
seemed prepared to go on if nec
essary, they also agreed to abide
by the group's decision.
"The four of us were com
mitted to do it until the com
munity decided we had done
enough," said junior Tamara
Alvarado, one of the fasters.
"We're going to put the com
munity first."
'Productive' negotiations
After reaching a decision, the
MEChA negotiations committee
took their results to Casper and
Rice. For two and a half hours,
the protesters spoke with their
faculty advisers while Casper
and Rice met together to dis
cuss wording changes.
Jackson and Sally Dickson,
director of the Office of Multi
cultural Development, acted as
go-betweens for the two
groups.
"It is the nature of intense
political events that there will
be a lot of back and forth, many,
many players, who often
change," Casper said after the
Saturday morning meeting.
"People begin to worry about
the exact wording of this phrase
or that phrase.
"We were willing from the
beginning onward to see if we
could agree on wording that
would be acceptable to both
sides."
Both administrators and fac
ulty observers said that the stu
dents handled themselves well
during negotiations.
"The students acted indepen
dently," said Civil Engineering
Prof. Jim Leckie.
"They conducted themselves
in a sophisticated manner. . . .
The faculty helped them find
words that the administration
could accept."
During that process, partici
pants said there was more dis
cussion of concrete details than
appears on the final written
statement.

"The administration is going
to take these proposals very
seriously," Law Prof. Miguel
Mendez said. "There was a
detailed exchange of views
about the meaning of these pro
posals. All sides felt it was bet
ter to have a single document,
but there was extensive discus
sion about the meaning of these
proposals."
Throughout the negotia
tions, participants said the
administration — and particu
larly Rice — took a hard-line
stance.
"Condi is one tough nut,"

With cheers of "iQue Viva!"
and "Chicano Studies now!" the
crowd received the news that a
settlement had been reached.
"The first agreement — and
the most far-reaching — is Chi
cano Studies," said senior Jorge
Solis, one of the negotiators.
"This is the first time we have
ever had the opportunity to dis
cuss it — that's a victory right
there."
Specifically, the agreement
states that "the Provost will
entertain a proposal from the
Dean of Humanities and Sci
ences to consider a Chicano

Leckie said. "You would have
thought she was negotiating
with the Russians and not with
students. She clearly received
her management training in the
Pentagon."
Though Leckie said that
there was "an awful lot of
unnecessary posturing" that
seemed to go over students'
heads, negotiators picked up on
the different styles of the presi
dent and the provost.
"Casper today was much
more open to our issues," said
law student Alma Medina, one
of the negotiators, on Friday.
"Casper has been willing to lis
ten, but Condi has closed all the
doors."
Rice, however, said she
thought the negotiations were
handled properly. "I do think
there was one bottom line: the
University's processes were
respected. [The agreement
came out of] reasoned, produc
tive consideration. This is the
way to move forward," she said.
'That's a victory right there'
At 11:30 Friday night, the
negotiators emerged from
Building 10 and took their
final agreement to the 100 sup
porters who had braved the
pouring rain to gather around
the tents in the middle of the
Quad.

Studies Program."
The committee to create this
proposal will consist of students
and faculty.
Solis said that the committee
would be formed in the next few
days and begin work next fall.
Faculty support for the pro
gram is already strong, Mendez
said.
"There have been discus
sions among Chicano faculty for
over 20 years, with different
administrations, about the need
and desirability" of such a pro
gram, he said.
"It belongs in Humanities
and Sciences and it can't hap
pen until you have a critical
mass of Chicano faculty, (which
hasn't been true] until the last
two years."
Strikers had originally asked
that a high level position be
offered to Burciaga, the Univer
sity's highest-ranking Chicana
administrator who will leave
her position as an associate
dean in the Office of Student
Affairs and as a resident fellow
in Casa Zapata Aug. 1.
Protesters settled for Uni
versity recognition of Burcia
ga's importance to the commu
nity.
The agreement states: "We
recognize that the layoff of

Cecilia Burciaga has been a
source of distress for many in
the Stanford community and
that her role at Stanford went
beyond her duties in the Vice
Provost for Student Affairs
area," adding that the Universi
ty is committed to the recruit
ment and retention of minority
graduate students.
"We didn't get them to say
'I'm sorry Cecilia, we treated
you badly,' but we did get them
to realize her value to the com
munity. She is irreplaceable,"
Cervantes said.
Casper and Rice also agreed
to help the students "explore
ways, including fundraising
assistance, to support student
initiatives to consolidate and
better coordinate their service
programs in East Palo Alto,"
according the settlement.
Specifically, Medina said,
"we're going to find an alumnus
who will donate an EPA house

which will be a MEChA house."
The protesters focused much
of their attention on the issue of
a grape ban.
Their original demands
called for a campus-wide ban on
the fruit, but the settlement
states that "Prof. Luis Eraga
will form and head a committee
that will assess and, if neces
sary, recommend changes to the

University's present policy on
grapes."
This issue had become a
defining one during the final
discussions.
"The issue of grapes was
not well understood as to why
passion was so high," Leckie
said. "That was the toughest
issue, primarily because so
many of [the protesters) come
from farm-working families —
it was not symbolic but per
sonal."
The committee "will repre
sent an appropriate range of
interests and will rely on tech
nical expertise of people in
house," Fraga said, adding that
the group would examine
"health aspects, biochemical
aspects, legal aspects —
regarding the issue generally
and the University in particular
as a consumer."
Strikers said they felt the
educational approach was, in
the long run, beneficial.
Education "is better than a
ban because it educates people
and then they can pass on the
knowledge," said senior Julia
Gonzalez Luna, one of the
fasters.
Casper and Rice also agreed
to appoint Dickson as head of
"an effort to examine the Uni
versity response to the Flicks
incident," including possible
dorm viewings and discussions
of the video.
Finally, the proposal states
that "the School of Humanities
and Sciences also will examine
the requests that have been
pending concerning Asian-
American studies."
A tense first step
Although the strike official
ly ended on Friday night — an
event celebrated by the fasters
with Cup O'Noodles soup —
supporters again gathered in
the Quad on Saturday morn
ing to hear from Casper and
Rice.
The president and provost
were greeted by a crowd of
about 100, who stood in the rain
and shouted "Uuas, no! Chicano
Studies, si!" for a full five min
utes before allowing Casper to
speak.
"I know that your strike was
importantly about respect —
respect that the provost and I
always have had for you even
though some of you may have

felt otherwise," Casper said.
"We do respect you and your
sense of commitment. I have
no respect for those who, under
cover of darkness, shout
slurs."
The new community rela
tionship received its first test
just a few minutes later, howev
er, when Casper refused to sign
a copy of the settlement — a
gesture students claimed he had
agreed to the night before.
"Yesterday, those of us pre
sent requested that Casper sign
as a symbolic gesture," said
Medina with emotion, adding
that if this action was refused,
"how can we trust that any of
our other agreements will come
true?"
But Casper, arguing that the
students had misunderstood
him, said the protesters had to
trust him to keep his word, even
without the symbolism, in order
for the settlement to work at
all.
"I thought you understood that
trust had to be the basis rather
than signatures," he told them.
Eventually, however, Casper
agreed to sign the paper. "I
decided it was an issue I was not
going to spend capital on," he

said later.
Rice, who had originally been
opposed to any sort of symbolic
signing, went along with the
president's decision and signed
the agreement as well.
"I do this as a symbolic ges
ture of my partnership with

the president," she said.
"Neither of us do anything
without the other. We'll sign
it together."
