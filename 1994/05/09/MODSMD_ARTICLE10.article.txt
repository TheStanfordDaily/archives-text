# Haiti refugees to be met halfway
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Shifting a
policy that has led to criticism that he is
insensitive to the plight of refugees,
President Clinton said yesterday the
United States will begin offshore
screening of Haitian boat people seeking
political asylum.
"I don't believe the policy we have
now is sustainable given the level of
political violence" in Haiti, Clinton said
at a news conference in the White
House Rose Garden. "We have an obli
gation to try to let the people who gen
uinely fear for their lives into this coun
try."
Clinton also named Bill Gray, the
head of the United Negro College Fund
and a former congressman from Penn
sylvania, adviser on Haiti.
Clinton said Gray, who formerly
chaired the House Budget Committee,
will act as special adviser to the president

and the secretary of state. He called Gray
a man of "vision and determination, of
real strength and real creativity."
Gray replaces Lawrence Pezzullo,
who was forced from office last month
because of differences over the direction
of the faltering Haiti policy. Pezzullo
alienated exiled Haitian President Jean-
Bertrand Aristide and some in the State
Department by calling for political rec
onciliation among the different factions
in Haiti.
Aristide, in a statement, said Clin
ton's plan for offshore processing was a
"step in the right direction" but said "it
will not protect the millions of Haitian
citizens who continue to face increased
violence in Haiti."
Clinton said the decision to process
refugees at sea will not lead to a flood of
boat people, and he urged Haitians not
to take the move as an incentive to try

to leave the country by boat.
"There may be some more people
who get in, because we'll be reviewing
even more people. But it would be a
great mistake for Haitians who want to
come here for economic reasons to just
take to the boats, because we are not
changing the standard by which we
admit people."
He said that while the policy of
returning economic refugees will con
tinue, he did not want to risk forcing
back to Haiti those refugees with bona
fide claims to political asylum.
Clinton stressed that the ultimate
solution is the departure of the military
leaders who overthrew Aristide in a
September 1991 coup.
To that end, the United Nations, at
U.S. urging, on May 21 will begin
imposing tougher sanctions on the
Haitian military government.
