## Editorial A 						delicate situation 
### 
University must stick to
agreement made, try to
restore trust and respect

THE TENTS have been dis
mantled. The Quad has been
cleared. The fasters have
eaten. What is left now is one piece
of paper that carries the weight of
all these events of the past few days
and the enormous frustrations that
prompted them.
And while it is fortunate that
the Chicano community's hunger
strike in the Quad ended quickly
and safely, their struggle now
requires vigorous follow-through
by both parties to ensure that the
victory they celebrated this week
end is a lasting one.
After members of the Chicano
community endured three days of
hunger and rain, the struggle has
hardly begun — for both the
protesters and those protested
against.
What the protest in the Quad
won was an agreement by the
administration to form three com
mittees to investigate the strikers'
demands.
The demands included an offer of
a high-level position for Assoc. Vice
Provost for Student Affairs Cecilia
Burciaga, who was recently laid off
due to budget cuts; the establish
ment of a community center in East
Palo Alto; a campus-wide ban on
grapes; and the development of a
Chicano studies program.
Committees will be formed to
examine the feasibility of the latter
three demands. On the first
demand, the administration
offered a formal statement
acknowledging Burciaga's contri
butions to the community, but no
job or apology for the layoff.
But the written statement
signed by University President
Gerhard Casper and Provost Con
doleezza Rice contains few of the
concrete details that were dis

cussed, unlike at other schools
which are having similar strikes,
and essentially asks for a leap of
faith, which students apparently
took when they ended the strike.
Whether the leap of faith was
justified remains to be seen.
For this reason, it is crucial for
students and faculty who support
ed the protest to continue showing
their support for the demands until
they are more clearly within reach,
because while the most generous
concessions — a Chicano studies
program by 1995 and a community
center in East Palo Alto — were
discussed, they were not docu
mented in specific details on paper.
Administrators, for their part,
must realize that the situation is
still delicate. It will take a long
series of positive steps to build a
comfortable relationship of mutual
trust and respect.
Though the vaguely worded doc
ument may not hold them account
able to the specifics discussed in
the negotiations, the administra
tion must realize that developing
this trust and respect largely rests
on their following through on
these specifics. Straying too far
from what's not on paper could be
as detrimental to the relationship
as simply reneging on a part of the
written document.
After all, this is much of what
the strike was about — trust and
respect, or the perceived lack there
of. Committees to examine the
issue of grapes and the others could
likely have been formed through
different channels, though perhaps
not as rapidly. The strike, however,
was also a way to mobilize the com
munity, express deeply rooted frus
trations and point out the urgency
of the situation in a way that face
to-face board room meetings proba
bly could not.
And though there may not be a
hunger strike to rally around or
respond to any more, both parties
need to understand that their indi
vidual efforts must continue as con
vincingly as ever. Because beyond
the rhetoric of desperate situations
must lie actions that will endure.
