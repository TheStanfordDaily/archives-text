## These old friends of mine 
### 
A FRIEND indeed, huh? Do you still
talk to him or her? Do you remem
ber the phone number? Do you
even think about any of your old friends?
Your thoughts needn't involve a grand
plan to re-introduce the former chum
into your life. But do you even wonder
what the old boy might be up to these
days?
I'm talking about your high school
friends. I'm talking about your freshman
roommate who went Kappa. I'm talking
about anyone who you'd once have killed
or died for, but now, a fleeting "Hey,
what's up?" is all they get. If you're like
me, there are a lot of people in your life
you wish you had more time for.
I don't have the resources to do a
demographic study, but chances are you
had to come a long way before you got to
Stanford. That is to say, there are as
many students who have a six-hour drive
to get home as those who need a six-hour
flight. More live somewhere in between.
And I can't exclude those who need a
passport to celebrate the holidays with
family, either.
I'm willing to say the distance from
my home in New York to Stanford has
been the biggest factor in my losing touch
with high school friends. While my buds
at home were hanging out for all the
autumn and spring holidays my fresh
man year, I was studying for midterms or
finals. If I just decided to get in a car and
drive home, it would have taken me four

days — with minimal sleep.
Can you see now why American
Express cards are so popular with East
Coasters here? Those travel vouchers are
a great bargain.
Distance means more money, which
consequently means less travel. Out of
sight is truly out of mind because you try
to make up for what you've lost with
what you've got. Before you know it, it
has been months since the last letter and
your phone bill is conspicuously small
because the numbers you're calling
require five numbers as opposed to 12.
The Draw allows us Stanfordites to
keep our friends close because we can live
with them. Yet, the maximum number
you can draw with is eight in your circle.
If there are more than eight, you all can
try to put the same houses on your cards,
but that's such a crap shoot. The Draw
really forces you to pick your friends. I
won't even go into that.
So what happened to the guy down the
hall? Or your roommates who you
thought were going to make the bitchin'-
est triple in Toyon with you, but then —
a couple of Mondays ago — the SAEs
came knocking and gave them an "offer
they couldn't refuse." You never thought
you'd stop talking to that RA who made
Res Ed life bearable, but you have.
What the hell happened?
You've got your best friends, though.
You never lose them You attach yourself
to them, and they to you. You are

involved in each other's daily lives.
You've probably met the family, and you
definitely did the Maui thing one spring
break.
But why haven't you kept the other
friends? They were just as important to
you, weren't they? You're supposed to
keep these friends for the rest of you life.
Maybe it's complacency that causes us
to lose friends? It's a lot easier to call
someone you talked to yesterday, than it
is to call someone from a "past life."
Besides, you called him last. He owes you.
Rationalize it as much as much as you
want, but it's all bull. Fact is, a true
friend does what ever it takes to do some
thing with you. A true friend will try
their hardest to keep the appointment. A
true friend, of any sort, will call you.
Unfortunately, it doesn't always work
that way, does it?
Clear the calendar. Summer is almost
here — and before you know it — you'll
be gone and you may have lost your final
chance, and don't you think you've had
enough?
Don't be like me. Don't be a friend in
need.

Jesse wants to tell his friend Aman Verjee
that the Sharks' winning edge is bottled
spring water.
