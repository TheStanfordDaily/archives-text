## Racial tensions leave some students 'out in the cold' 
### 
lAM A student here at Stanford, and I
am deeply disturbed about what is hap
pening on campus right now. The
strike by MEChA is not the sole reason
why I am upset, but it has brought me to a
point where I can no longer keep silent
about a problem I have been faced with all
year.
From the first day of my Stanford
experience, I have been plunged into
issues of race. During Orientation, I
attended a production at Memorial Audi
torium which introduced us to the cul
tural diversity which abounds here at
Stanford. I was excited to be exposed to it
all until a black woman came on stage
and asked us to sing the Black National
Anthem along with her, adding "If you
don't know the words then shame on
you." Since that moment I have con
stantly felt discriminated against on this
campus. I don't know why she was so
disturbed at my not knowing the words.
I am from Bulgaria and I sure don't
expect people to know the Bulgarian
national anthem. ...
This was not the only incident. Later
on in the year, I overheard two of my
Chicano dormmates, who happen to be
members of MEChA, talking about how
they wanted to "kill all the white peo-

ple!" In my opinion it is not only wrong
to say something like this, it is wrong to
even think about it.
In addition, every morning I have to
go through the Casa Zapata dining hall
to get my breakfast, and every morning I
have to see a portrait of a faceless white
woman among the murals on the wall.
My heart bleeds every single time I see it
because this picture clearly discriminates
against the white race. It is sad that the
University tolerates that.
The last straw was the present hunger
strike of MEChA. They presented a list
of demands that was, in my opinion,
unreasonable. And here is why:
• I suppose Cecilia Burciaga is a highly
respected individual here who has con
tributed a lot to the University. Howev
er, she is not the only person laid off this
year. There are a lot of other well-quali
fied white individuals who have been laid
off as well. Nobody says a word about
them, however. I have not seen an article
protesting against the layoff of white
people. Why? Because the color of their
skin is white. If we want to be fair, we
have to value people on the basis of their
qualifications, not on the color of their
skin. So Burciaga has to accept her lay
off, and that is that. Period.

• I respect the idea of building a com
munity center in East Palo Alto. It would
definitely improve Stanford's reputation;
however, the timing of this request is not
appropriate. Stanford is running in a
deficit right now. It is cutting hack on
faculty and educational programs, and
there is no money for charitable projects.
Isn't it enough that many Stanford stu
dents volunteer their time to help the
people of East Palo Alto? Not to mention
that Stanford is providing employment
for many people from this impoverished
area? In addition, my personal feeling is
that my father pays $25,000 a year to
educate me, not to help the needy.
• As far as the grapes issue, I have yet
to eat a grape at Stanford. Anyhow, most
grapes served at Stanford are imported
from Chile and are not picked by the
migrant workers which the protesters
claimed they were fighting for.
• I don't think the creation of a Chi
cano studies program will be fair to other
minorities on campus. For example,
Asian-Americans, who constitute about
25 percent of the student body, don't
have an Asian/American studies pro
gram. Why should the Chicana/os who
are about 10 percent of the student body
have their own studies program? More-

over, where will the University find
money to sponsor such a program? Or do
we have to create it just because a group
of people wants it without regards as to
whether anyone else really cares? Just
look at the feminist studies program and
the simple fact that it represents nearly
.50 percent of the population and yet has
only three majors. I would fear the same
fate for a Chicano studies program.
I start to get the impression that the
whole student body stands behind the
protesters, which is not true. Just
remember that MEChA did not even get
its special fee request this year! Further
more, I feel that decreased alumni satis
faction caused by liberalization achieved
through such extreme means as hunger
strikes might reduce the amount of
money we receive from the alumni. And
we all know that alumni contributions
pay for over half of our education!
All in all, I think that the strike was
unnecessary, although that is only a part
of a broader issue. It summarizes my
frustration that has been built up all
year because of the racial tensions on
campus that have left my race out in the
cold.
