# Latino group clarifies stance toward issues raised in MEChA fast
## 
### 
In light of the May 6 Daily article
"Talks reach stalemate," in which Irene
Yackovlev, president of the Latino Stu
dents' Association, was misquoted when
saying "It's against our philosophy, our
mission, in the Stanford community" and
was taken out context when cited as say
ing "these really aren't the issues facing
the Latino community," the Executive
Board of the LSA would like to respond

with this statement and clarify its posi
tion concerning MEChA's protest.
• Contrary to what was implied by The
Daily, the LSA at Stanford fully supports
MEChA's demands.
• We believe that the issues addressed
by MEChA are important for both the
Chicano and the Latino communities.
• Although, as a culturally-based orga
nization, the LSA has not taken political
stances in the past, we would like to
express our solidarity and support for
MEChA's cause.

Kennedy's emphasis on
caution isn't consistent
with tuition increases

Former University President Donald
Kennedy's May 3 letter to The Daily
emphasizing "caution" and "prudence" in

the management of Stanford University's
funds should strike a hollow note to
undergraduates, alumni/ae and parents.
While Stanford's endowment grew by
"around $800 million," Kennedy's admin
istration was hiking student tuition from
$6,285 per year to $16,536 per year, a rise
of 263 percent — considerably more than
inflation, which averaged 5.2 percent
annually from 1980 to 1992.
In fact, lest we forget too quickly, it
was precisely the national attention to his
lack of prudence in fiscal affairs that led
to our present parlous state and to his
change of status to president emeritus.
