## Baseball clobbers UCLA, leads Six-Pac by 2 games No. 13 Cardinal one win away from conference title 
### Andy Eiser Senior staff writer 
Jason Middlebrook outdid himself.
Middlebrook, a hard-throwing freshman right-han
der and already a starting rotation mainstay for the
No. 13 Cardinal baseball team, tossed the seventh no
hitter in school history yesterday as Stanford complet
ed a three-game sweep of the UCIA Bruins with a 3-0
victory at Sunken Diamond.
Effectively mixing curveballs and sliders with his
trademark blazing fastball, Middlebrook (7-1) record
ed a career-high 14 strikeouts while overcoming seven
walks and an error to earn his first collegiate complete
game. His effort capped a doubleheader sweep for the
Cardinal, which took yesterday's first game 14-5 and
the rain-delayed series opener 3-2 on Saturday.
"I tried not to think about it," Middlebrook said. "I
just wanted to secure the win for my team."
Middlebrook could not have picked a more dramat
ic time to make history, as first-place Stanford (34-20,
20-7 in the Pacific 10 Conference Southern Division)
extended its Six-Pac lead to two games and gained
firm control of the conference race.
With archrival California eliminating third-place
USC yesterday in a series-opening 7-6 win at Berkeley,
the Cardinal needs just one victory over second-place
Arizona State next weekend in Tempe, Ariz., to take
the title.
"It's a big thing," said Middlebrook of his team's
contention. "We've come a long way and pulled out a
lot of close games."
One of the closest Six-Pac games came Saturday,
when Stanford pulled a rabbit out of its hat to thwart
an upset bid. The Bruins (16-34, 8-19) jumped to a 1-
0 lead in the fifth inning on a solo home run by fresh
man catcher Tim DeCinces, but Cardinal sophomore
catcher A.J. Hinch responded with a two-run shot in
the sixth to put Stanford in front.

knotted affairs in top of the eighth inning when he sin
gled home freshman pinch hitter Jon Heinrichs, who
had drawn a walk from Stanford sophomore starter
Dan Reed
But the Cardinal saved a little magic for the bottom
of the eighth. Hinch led off with a double, his third hit
off Bruins sophomore starter Brian Stephenson (3-5).
Senior designated hitter Nate Olmstead, Stanford's
leading hitter with a .372 average, then laid down a
bunt to put Hinch on third with one out.
Junior first baseman Dusty Allen, the Cardinal's
biggest player at 6-feet-4, 215 pounds, followed with a
suicide squeeze, catching UCLA's defense off guard
and plating Hinch with the winning run.
"I was fairly confident I could get the ball down,"
Allen said. "It was one of the most unexpected things
we could do, and it was a great call."
Hinch praised Allen, the team's fifth-place hitter,
for giving up an at-bat when a medium-range fly ball
could have scored the run.
"We practice that play every week, and Dusty came
up huge," Hinch said. "He's a true team player."
Reed (10-3) pitched a scoreless ninth to close out
his third complete game of the season and boost his
Six-Pac record to a perfect 8-0.

"Dan's been great all year for us," Allen said. "He
had a rough start last week | against Sacramento
State] and bounced back with a quality complete
game. My hat's off to him."
Many hats in yesterday's large crowd came off for
Middlebrook, but Stanford's first conference no-hitter
in 24 years nearly overshadowed a career day at the
plate for junior second baseman Jed Hansen. Hansen
spanked three three-run homers in the two games,
giving him eight on the year as Hansen wrested the
team lead from Allen.
The Cardinal struck first in game one, as Hinch,
Olmstead and junior leftfielder Steve Carver picked up
RBI hits in a three-run fifth inning to chase Bruins
freshman starter Nick St. George (2-7). Sopho
more third baseman Brian Dallimore provided some
unusual punch the following inning, hooking a John
Mitchell offering inside the left-field foul pole and over
the fence for a two-run home run, the second of the
year for Stanford's leadoff hitter.
"Once I saw the leftfielder going after it I knew it
was out," Dallimore said. "But when I hit it I thought
there was no way the wind would blow it."
Sophomore centerfielder Cale Carter doubled home
the Cardinal's sixth run with one out in the seventh
inning. Dallimore then singled home another run

before Hansen victimized Mitchell,
a sophomore, with the first of his
blasts to put Stanford in double
digits at 10-0.
"It was a strange at-bat,"
Hansen said. "The ball went off
the end of my bat, but I knew I hit
it squarely."
Sophomore third baseman Zak
Ammirato keyed a five-run eighth
inning rally for UCLA with a
grand slam off Stanford sopho

more starter Todd Bartels (6-3),
but Hansen responded with his
second three-run shot in as many
innings, easily clearing the trees
lining the left-field wall off Bruins
freshman Scott Fitterer.
A half-hour break could not
stop Hansen, who touched UCLA
senior starter Dan Kramer (3-2)
for the only runs of the second
game with nobody out in the
third.
"I had a talk with Nate [Olm
steadl afler practice on Thursday,
and told me to allow the ball to get
deeper in the strike zone and then
use my hands to swing," said

Hansen of his sudden power burst.
Hansen's wasn't the only trib
ute to Olmstead yesterday, as he
and three others were honored in
Senior Day ceremonies before the
doubleheader. In addition to Olm
stead, outfielder Rod Meyer,
infielder Jeff DesJardins and team
manager Andy Almanzan received
a standing ovation for their four
years of service to the Cardinal
program.
But the biggest ovation of the
day was reserved for a special
freshman, as Middlebrook's no-no
stole the show. And when Cardi
nal freshman shortstop Eric Sees

threw out UCLA junior first base
man Mike Mitchell at first base for
the game's final out, the entire
Stanford roster dogpiled the man
of the hour.
Cardinal head coach Mark Mar
quess, just one year removed from
his own Stanford playing career
when Phil Keller no-hit Arizona
State 1-0 on March 23, 1970, put
Middlebrook's accomplishment in
perspective.
"You don't see many of those,
especially in the third game of a
series, or in a Six-Pac series, or by
a freshman," Marquess said. "It
can't get much bigger than that."
