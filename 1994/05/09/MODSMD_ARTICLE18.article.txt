# Middlebrook throws no-hitter in 3-0 win
## 
### Swaminatha Gurudevan Staff writer 
Now even the UCLA Bruins know that Jason
Middlebrook is a force to be reckoned with.
In possibly the biggest win of the season for the
Stanford baseball team, the freshman righthander
from Grass Lake, Mich., pitched the seventh no
hitter in Cardinal history, a decisive 3-0 victory
that capped a three-game Stanford sweep of UCLA
this weekend at Sunken Diamond.
With a fastball clocked at better than 93 miles
per hour, Middlebrook had the Bruin batters
struggling to make contact. Cardinal coach Mark
Marquess said he was amazed by his freshman
sensation.
"You don't see many [no-hitters], especially in a
third game of a league series," Marquess said.
"That's pretty impressive. I thought he was throw
ing as hard as he did all game in the ninth inning.
He's capable of doing that."
Middlebrook retired 15 of the first 16 batters he
faced, including 10 via strikeouts en route to a
career-high 14-strikeout performance. If any of
the innings he pitched could be called difficult,
they would be the seventh and eighth.
In the top of the seventh, Mid
dlebrook ran into control problems
as he walked the leadoff batter,
Bruin shortstop Gar Vallone. But a
great pickoff move bailed him out,
as Vallone was caught leaning off
first with a snap throw by Middle
brook.
After a quick conference on the
mound with Cardinal catcher A.J.
Hinch, he escaped the inning
unscathed by inducing Brett
Schafer to ground out to third.
"Any time you get in a situation
where you have the no-hitter, you
don't really talk about it but that
pressure is there for you," Hinch
said. "I was just trying to go down
there and calm him down and just
let him focus on throwing strikes to
me and let all that stuff take care of
itself.
Control problems resurfaced in
the eighth inning as Middlebrook
once again walked the leadoff bat
ter, Bruin catcher Dave Dieter.
Stanford's defense responded, as
the next batter grounded into a 3-6-
3 double play.

Middlebrook then lost the next
two batters to bases on bails, and
pitching coach Dean Stotz visited
the mound to advise his young
righthander. Apparently Stotz
issued some good advice, as Middle
brook regained his composure and
struck out Bruin leadoff hitter
David Roberts to end the inning.
"It helped when on [a] 3-2
[count], coach Stotz came out and
gave me a couple of mechanical
keys," Middlebrook said. "It was
my mechanics more than anything
that kind of gave away that I was
tired. He reminded me of a few key
things and that made a difference
since I threw a lot of strikes after
that. I owe a lot of credit to him."
In the ninth inning, with a
crowd of 1,147 at Sunken Diamond
in a frenzy, Middlebrook picked up
where he left off and struck out the
first two batters swinging. All that
stood in his way was power-hitting
Bruin first baseman Mike Mitchell,
a .337 hitter who had drawn a walk
just two innings earlier.
Middlebrook got ahead of
Mitchell one ball and two strikes,
and threw an outside fastball,
which Mitchell hit on the ground to
Cardinal shortstop Eric Sees. Sees
gobbled up the ball and made a

strong throw to first to retire the
Bruins and cap off the biggest
pitching performance of Middle
brook's career.
"I saw him hit it, but I knew that
at the angle it was going, Eric
[Sees] would be all over it," Middle
brook said. "It wasn't hit as hard so
I thought Eric would take care of it
and he did."
After the final out was recorded,
Middlebrook threw his arms up in
jubilation and was promptly
mobbed by the entire Stanford
team. Middlebrook's pitching gem
against UCLA is especially signifi
cant since just two months ago
Middlebrook was shelled by the
very same Bruin team and had his
poorest outing of the year in a 11-4
Stanford loss in Los Angeles.
"I didn't think about [the no-hit
terl during the game at all because
it was a close game," Middlebrook
said. "We were ahead by three runs,
so it wasn't out of reach. Last time I
faced them I had a good inning and
came out and they just exploded on
me. I knew how quickly things
could change. I thought more of the
win than anything else."
And win he did. Middlebrook
improved his record to 7-1 on the
season and lowered his ERA to

2.18, best in the Stanford starting
rotation, while increasing his
strikeout total to 62 in only 57-2/3
innings pitched — better than one
strikeout per inning.
Hinch said he believes Middle
brook's control and confidence has
taken leaps and bounds since the
beginning of the season.
"He's gotten a lot better with
the command of his pitches,"
Hinch said. "The kid's so talented
and he showed the types of things
he can do for our team and it's just
tremendous for him to do that —
he deserves that because of the way
he has pitched all year."
Even more significantly, Mid
dlebrook's victory drew the Cardi
nal to within one win of the Pacific
10 Conference Southern Division
title. Stanford will travel to Tempe,
Ariz., to close out its Six-Pac sched
ule against Arizona State this com
ing weekend.
"The big thing out of this whole
game is that now, it's one victory
and it's ours, and that's the key
thing to remember," Middlebrook
said. "We've gone a long way this
year, fought a lot, and pulled out
some close games. And that's just
what it's all coming down to. We
can't wait to get down there."
