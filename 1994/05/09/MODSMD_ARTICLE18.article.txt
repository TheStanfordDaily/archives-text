# Middlebrook throws no-hitter in 3-0 win

Now even the UCLA Bruins know that Jason
Middlebrook is a force to be reckoned with.
In possibly the biggest win of the season for the
Stanford baseball team, the freshman righthander
from Grass Lake, Mich., pitched the seventh no
hitter in Cardinal history, a decisive 3-0 victory
that capped a three-game Stanford sweep of UCLA
this weekend at Sunken Diamond.
With a fastball clocked at better than 93 miles
per hour, Middlebrook had the Bruin batters
struggling to make contact. Cardinal coach Mark
Marquess said he was amazed by his freshman
sensation.
"You don't see many [no-hitters], especially in a
third game of a league series," Marquess said.
"That's pretty impressive. I thought he was throw
ing as hard as he did all game in the ninth inning.
He's capable of doing that."
Middlebrook retired 15 of the first 16 batters he
faced, including 10 via strikeouts en route to a
career-high 14-strikeout performance. If any of
the innings he pitched could be called difficult,
they would be the seventh and eighth.
