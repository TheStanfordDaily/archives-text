## Track could get new home at Angell Field 
### Sarah Nagae Editorial staff 
Now a plain cinder track
dotted by the occasional weed
patch and unavoidable puddle,
plans are in the works to refur
bish Angell Field, the track
adjacent to the Stanford Tennis
Stadium. The project is still in
its beginning stages but would
likely convert the field to a per
manent home for the Stanford
track and field team starting as
early as next year.
"It's all very tentative right
now," said head coach Vin
Lananna. "It's a project we're
working on and there have
been some negotiations and
fundraising."
The primary renovations,
which are expected to run in
the neighborhood of $1.5 mil
lion, would include resurfacing
the eight-lane track with
polyurethane, making it very
similar to the team's current
home track in the Stanford Sta
dium. Other additions would
likely include jumping aprons
and runways.
"From what I've heard, I
think it's really going to be
great," said junior men's co
captain Tovi Abello. "It will be
a much more visible place and
having a track only stadium
will be nice, we won't have to
worry about stepping on the
grass and things like that."
As only grass and dirt line
the track's periphery right
now, possible plans call for the
installation of bleachers which
would seat 4,000 to 5,000 peo
ple. Once the first upgrades are
completed, permanent seating
would be considered in the
future.
"There will probably be a lit

tle bit of sentimental value lost
moving out of the Stadium,"
said junior women's co-captain
Christy Boyd. "But sometimes
it seems like there aren't any
fans there because the Stadium
is so huge. This way when we
get a standard amount of fans
it will seem full."
The possible move would
also resolve the problems
caused by the sharing of the
track with the football team. As
the surface of the Stadium
track has received 15 years of
wear and tear from both
squads, it's generally thought
of as slower than many newer
tracks, according to Abello.
"It's kind of squishy now, I
think it's slowed with age," he
said. "It's not as effective to
run on an older track."
While talk of renovation to
the field has circulated for
years, the most recent plans
have arisen as a result of Stadi
um improvements in prepara
tion for next month's World
Cup.
"Everybody wants to move it
along," Lananna said. "The
World Cup is especially pushing
it along since they're starting
to tear up certain parts of the
field and track."
Some of the Stadium con
struction, including the expan
sion of the inner field to regula
tion soccer size, will displace
the track team as such changes
require the ripping out of the
track's turns.
"It's inconvenient with the
World Cup now because we're
not going to have full access
since they're taking out the
runways," Boyd said. "Some
thing really has to be done."
