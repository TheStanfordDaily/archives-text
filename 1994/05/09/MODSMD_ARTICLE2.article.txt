# Grade policy meetings to be held
## 
### Andy Dworkin Senior staff writer 
Students raring to voice their opin
ions on proposed changes to the grading
policy will get their chance this week.
Faculty Senate members will host
meetings on the policy tonight at 6:30 in
Kimball Hall and Tuesday night at 6:30
in Roble Hall, said Geology Prof. Gail
Mahood, chair of the committee that
drew up the grading plan.
Mahood said she and some other
members of her committee will be pre
sent at each meeting. The gatherings will
give her a chance to hear student input
on the proposals and "talk about some of
the reasons, some of the rationales we
had" for making the proposals, she said.
Under the new plan, a failing grade of
NP (not passed) would be recorded on
student transcripts as well as a W nota
tion when students withdraw from class
es after the third week of the quarter.

The plan would also move drop and add
deadlines up to the third week and move
the pass/no credit deadline back to week
six.
The senate will vote on the proposal at
its May 26 meeting.
Mah(x>d urged students to read her
commission's report and recommenda
tions before coming to the meetings. Stu
dents can review copies of the report at
Meyer Library's reserve desk and the Aca
demic Secretary's Office in Building 170.
Students with access to Macintosh
computers connected to Stanford's com
puter network can read the report on
line via Apple Share. To obtain the report
electronically, enter the "Stanford" Ap
ple Talk zone and select the "Drop Off"
file server, then the "C-AAA Grading Re
port" file.
While there seems to be strong faculty
support for the plan, Mahood said, she is
open to suggestions from students, espe
cially ideas on when deadlines should be

and how to "grandfather" current stu
dents under the new plan. She added
that having the new plan only apply to
new students is not a viable option.
So far, Mahood said, she has had
about eight students contact her about
the plan. Three of those students wanted
to find out the times of this week's meet
ings, four opposed the plan and one sup
ported it, Mahood said. In general, she
said, she hopes to hear suggestions as
well as criticism from students.
"The way students am be the most
constructive, instead of saying 'Oh my
God this can't happen,'. .. is to find ways
we can change our proposals," she said.
Suggesting that the senate scrap the
whole policy will not be fruitful, she said.
"If we'd had a vote (at the last senate
meeting) it would have sailed through,"
Mahood said. "Something like this is
what the faculty wants."
In addition to the meetings and
personal contact with students,
Mahood said she had "an extended
conversation" with the ASSU Stu
dent Affairs committee last Mon
day.
ASSU Senator Phil Lin, a
sophomore, said only four sena
tors attended that meeting, which
ended up as mostly a question and
answer session.
Lin said that at the meeting

"Prof. Mahood wasn't very con
ducive to change" in major parts
of the proposal, indicating the
deadlines were the most nego
tiable items.
The Student Affairs Commit
tee is meeting tonight and hopes
to draw up a response to the pro
posal, said committee member and
ASSU Senator Vanessa Alvarado.
Students should e-mail sugges
tions to her at curuy@leland by 6
p.m. today, she said.
Students who want to contact
Mahood directly should write to
her at the Green Earth Sciences
Building or e-mail her at
gail@Pangea.
