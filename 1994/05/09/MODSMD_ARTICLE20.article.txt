Winning isn't everything.
Such was the attitude of the
Stanford track and field team after
both the men and women fell to
California in Saturday's Big Meet
at Edwards Stadium. Facing one of
the nation's top dual meet teams,
the Cardinal squad rose to the chal
lenge, emerging from Bear country
only after putting up a valiant
fight.
"Everyone did an excellent job
in filling in their spots," said head
coach Vin Lananna. "We have to
give Cal a lot of credit for their solid
performance."
Trailing by a final tally of 113-
50, the Cardinal men fell to their
rivals across the Bay for the 23rd
year in a row. Stanford's perfor
mance was not without its bright
spots, however. Senior co-captain

Dave Popejoy and freshman Pete
Swanson both secured individual
victories in the hammer and shot
put, respectively. Popejoy won with
a throw of 221 feet, 3 inches while
Swanson's toss of 56' 8" earned
him top honors.
"I did fairly good and I feel like
I'm stepping back in the right direc
tion since I was off the past few
weeks," Popejoy said of his perfor
mance. Overall, he said he thought
that the team's effort fell a little
short.
"I think that we could have
come closer competitively, even
though Cal would still have beaten
us in the end," he added.
On the track, sophomore Rene
Rodriguez ended the meet with a
first in the 400 meters with a time
of 46.37 seconds. He missed the
tape by a mere fraction of a second
in the 200 meters, however, as his
21.38 was edged out by Bear Mar
tin Proulx's 21.36.

Running for the men's third
individual victory, sophomore Rob
Reeder paced to a 14:43.7 in the
5,000 meter while teammates
Brian McCafTery, a senior, finished
with 15:01.5 for second and fresh
man Jason Perscheid followed in
third with 15:17.3.
"It was a tough race but I was
generally pleased with it since I
ran well with my teammates and
didn't have a pack to worry about,"
Reeder said.
The women fought a much clos
er battle which came down to the
last event, the mile relay. The team
lost its grip on a 72-68 advantage
when a Bears team finished at the
3:45.30 mark while the Cardinal
ended with 3:46.17. With that vic
tory, Cal secured the women's win
73-72.
"The women's team was fabu
lous," Lananna said. "I saw a seven
point underdog coming in turn out
to a battle for the last race."

Senior distance runner Louise
Watson turned in two typically
strong performances, securing the
5,000 with a time of 16:42.1 and a
3,000 crossing of 9:49.42. Junior
co-captain Christy Boyd added a
victory in the 400 hurdles with a
time of 1:02.2 as well as a first in
the 100 hurdles with 14.54.
"This meet was important for
us to concentrate on scoring,"
Boyd said. "1 was disappointed
with the loss on the 4 X 100 relay
but I was glad to come back and
give the team 10 points toward the
score."
Adding a sizable contribution of
her own, sophomore Dena Dey
dominated the middle distances
with victories in the 800 and 1,500.
Classmate Monica Hoggatt similar
ly took the 200 and 400 meter
sprints. Other individual victories
included senior Jenny McCormick
in the javelin and junior Florence
Adu in the triple jump.
