Rash of burglaries
Four burglaries from stu
dent rooms were reported last
week, according to Stanford
Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
Students have been leaving
their doors unlocked — creat
ing easy opportunities for
thieves to prey on computers
and wallets.
Two Apple Powerbooks were
stolen on April 30 from rooms
in Kimball Hall and Okada
House when students left their
doors unlocked.
The crimes could "very well
be related," Niemeyer said.
A wallet was also taken from
a room in Roble Hall on the
same day. Even though there
was a stereo and computer
equipment in the victim's
room, the wallet was the only
item reported as missing,
Niemeyer said.
A Cedro resident also had a
wallet pilfered from a dorm
room on May 2, Niemeyer said.
Sunbather falls
A student looking for a tan
fell from the second floor of Flo
rence Moore Hall April 28.
When the victim walked out
onto his second floor ledge, his
sandal somehow got stuck,
causing a fall into the bushes

which "probably broke his fall
and saved his life," Stanford
Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer
said.
Paramedics arrived at the
scene and took the student to
the emergency room at the
Stanford Medical Center,
according to Niemeyer.
A good time?
A man who earlier went to
Hewlett-Packard offices while
dressed in a women's red suit,
high heels and blonde wig look
ing for David Packard paid a
visit to the President's Office
on April 20, Stanford Police
Capt. Raoul Niemeyer said.
The suspect came to the
President's Office in the Inner
Quad wearing casual men's
clothes after his earlier visit to
the computer firm, according to
Niemeyer. He then returned
later in the day to Hewlett-
Packard looking for Packard,
co-founder of the firm and a
Stanford alumnus.
The man drove all the way
from Houston, Texas, on his
quest to see Packard, Niemeyer
said.
Police are still investigating
the case, but believe that the
suspect is from the Northern
California, Niemeyer said.
