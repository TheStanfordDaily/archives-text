# Powwow honors Indian women
## 
### Julie Tsai Staff writer 
Students and people from around the country en
joyed the sights, sounds and tastes of the 23rd annu
al student-run Stanford Powwow over a somewhat
wet weekend.
The cultural celebration, sponsored by the Stan
ford American Indian Organization, included a five
kilometer run, authentic drum music and a tradition
al dance competition to promote interaction and edu
cation. The event — the theme of which was "Honor
ing Indian Women" — also provided a veritable cor
nucopia of art, craftwork and ethnic food enjoyed in
genial atmosphere at the intramural fields by the es
timated crowd of 30,000.
"The festival treated Native Americans in their
true authentic fashion and enlightened individuals to
their culture," said Jim Donohue, a visitor from
Claremont-McKenna College. "I wish we had some
thing like this at home."
Rosalie Sigalamurillo, a resident of River City,
Calif., who is Apache and Navtyo, said she came for
the weekend to buy the Indian beads sold by many
vendors. "They have all the Apache colors — just
beautiful colors," she said. "You can't find them in
stores."
"I just love my culture," she said.
"You can learn a lot too about the costumes and
traditions," said Andres Fargas-Mendoza, a 14-year-

old from Castro Valley. "You can
see friends and family." She
added that "You don't normally
get real Indian food at a restau
rant."
Members of the Stanford com
munity also enjoyed the many
delights of the Powwow.
"I really like the Indian tacos,"
said Linh Trinh, a senior and
repeat Powwow enthusiast. "And
I also like looking at all the arts
and crafts." Trinh also said she
felt this year's theme was particu
larly good.
Spectators also appreciated the
grand entry and dances performed
by competing teams in elaborate,
brilliant dress.
As each team entered the
arena, the emcee recognized the
contributions of Indian women as
mothers, grandmothers and
guardians of the culture.
Sophomore Jonas Celebiler

said that the handling of the
theme may have sidestepped the
individual contributions of Indian
women.
"It was interesting how that
guy approached it; the emcee
didn't seem like he was from Stan
ford," he said. "I guess in the con
text of Mother's Day it's all right,
but I don't think they played into
(the theme)."
But both Trinh and Celebiler
said they enjoyed the cultural
aspects of the event.
"For me, it was a very visual
experience," Celebiler said. "I
thought it was very interest
ing.
"It was fantastic," Trinh said.
"I really enjoyed it greatly."
The event was marred by the
arrests of three people Friday
night. Stanford Police Sgt. Rick
Tipton said one arrest was made
on charges of public intoxication.
He could not verify the reasons for
the other two arrests.
