## Fee refunds high, many groups using reserves 
### Jim Luh Staff writer 
Students requested refunds on 37 percent
of the total special fees collected this quarter,
a rate high enough that some student groups
may see this quarter's figures as the latest in
a year-long series of devastating refunds.
Students requested a total of $185,721 in
refunds this quarter, which constitutes
about 37 percent of the $497,505 collected for
the spring. The Stanford Band and Stanford
in Government fared the worst, while the
Legal Counseling Office had the lowest rate
at 30 percent.
While less than the 39 percent refund rate
winter quarter, this quarter's rate will still
have a major impact on student organiza
tions that have experienced the high winter
quarter refund rate and a 32 percent refund
rate from fall quarter.
ASSU Financial Manager Brian Hillger
said that rates usually increase over the
course of the year, as students need not reap
ply each quarter to receive their refunds.

This quarter, student groups apparently
benefited from greater-than-estimated en
rollment. While the spring collection sched
ule prepared last year accounts for 12,600
students paying fees, the actual enrollment
figure was 13,165, so student organizations
collected more money than expected. Thus,
even while the volume of refunds increased,
the refunds as a proportion of the total fees
collected decreased.
The lower rate this quarter might also be
due to the departure of students who re
quested fees earlier in the year or students
who withdrew requests after seeing the neg
ative effects of high refunds on student
groups, Hillger said.
Student organizations' budgets allowed
for only 25 percent or 26 percent refund
rates, so each special-fee organization will re
ceive less funding than expected.
Seventy percent of the refunds were re
quested by graduate students, down from 78
percent fall quarter â€” a high reached in part
