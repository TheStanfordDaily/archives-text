## Fee refunds high, many groups using reserves 
### Jim Luh Staff writer 
Students requested refunds on 37 percent
of the total special fees collected this quarter,
a rate high enough that some student groups
may see this quarter's figures as the latest in
a year-long series of devastating refunds.
Students requested a total of $185,721 in
refunds this quarter, which constitutes
about 37 percent of the $497,505 collected for
the spring. The Stanford Band and Stanford
in Government fared the worst, while the
Legal Counseling Office had the lowest rate
at 30 percent.
While less than the 39 percent refund rate
winter quarter, this quarter's rate will still
have a major impact on student organiza
tions that have experienced the high winter
quarter refund rate and a 32 percent refund
rate from fall quarter.
ASSU Financial Manager Brian Hillger
said that rates usually increase over the
course of the year, as students need not reap
ply each quarter to receive their refunds.

This quarter, student groups apparently
benefited from greater-than-estimated en
rollment. While the spring collection sched
ule prepared last year accounts for 12,600
students paying fees, the actual enrollment
figure was 13,165, so student organizations
collected more money than expected. Thus,
even while the volume of refunds increased,
the refunds as a proportion of the total fees
collected decreased.
The lower rate this quarter might also be
due to the departure of students who re
quested fees earlier in the year or students
who withdrew requests after seeing the neg
ative effects of high refunds on student
groups, Hillger said.
Student organizations' budgets allowed
for only 25 percent or 26 percent refund
rates, so each special-fee organization will re
ceive less funding than expected.
Seventy percent of the refunds were re
quested by graduate students, down from 78
percent fall quarter â€” a high reached in part
l>ecause of a fee-refund drive orga
nized by the Graduate Student Tea
Party, a group of graduate stu
dents disenchanted with funding
organizations they believed catered
mainly to undergraduates.
The Stanford Band suffered a
40 percent refund rate this quarter
and will access its reserves to make
up the difference, according to its
treasurer, junior Derek Tan.
"It doesn't really affect our
funding" for this quarter, Tan
said. But as reserves are not limit
less, he said, and "that may affect
us in the future."
The Publications Board
absorbed a 40 percent refund rate

this quarter, a blow that chair Steve
Russell said will further complicate
the Board's financial problems.
"The Pub Board's been buck
ling down all year," Russell said.
Board reserves "are now begin
ning to really bottom out," Russell
said, adding that the board will
probably be unable to survive
beyond next year if its financial sit
uation does not improve.
But circumstances are not so
dire for every student organiza
tion. The Stanford Axe Committee
was hit with a 39 percent refund
rate this quarter, but according to
chair Craig Zajac, the high refunds
will not have a large negative
impact on the Axe Committee's
finances this year, as some of its
costs were less than expected.
"We're actually going to turn
out all right," Zajac said.
