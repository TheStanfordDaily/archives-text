# Women's self-defense class argues its case
## 
### Beth Berselli Staff writer 
Campaigning to get the
women's self-defense class back
on campus, sponsors of the course
presented their legal argument
Friday to Provost Condoleezza
Rice and Assoc. University Gener
al Counsel Iris Brest.
Calling the meeting "an infor
mation exchange session," sopho

more Rachel Katz, a member of
Women Defending Ourselves Col
lective, which taught the class,
said Rice and Brest listened and
asked questions but made no offi
cial response.
The class — titled "Issues in
Self-Defense for Women" and of
fered through the Program in
Feminist Studies — was canceled
last September after a complaint
that segregating sections by sex
violates Title IX, a 1972 regula
tion prohibiting sex discrimina
tion in schools receiving federal
funding.
At the meeting, Katz said
members of the collective
explained their legal premise as
to why the class should be
returned to campus. The collec
tive is preparing a legal brief to
convince the University that the
class does not violate the federal
regulation.
"We will be very interested in
seeing the brief when it's fin
ished," Brest said.
The final copy of the brief will
be released next week and the
University will make an official
written response within a few
weeks, Katz said.
"We're trying to forge a coop
eration with them. We're opti
mistic that we can work together
on this," she added.
The collective will also hold a
rally May 19 at noon in White
Plaza to convince the University
that the class is important

enough to "risk a possible law
suit from whomever made the
initial complaint or might make a
complaint in the future," Katz
said.
Last fall, the University avert
ed an investigation by the U.S.
Department of Education's Office
of Civil Rights and decided
instead to bring the class into
compliance with the federal regu
lation.
The administration suggested
two alternative forms for the
class — a co-ed class or a single
sex, strictly physical P.E. course
with no discussions or assertive
ness training. Collective mem
bers felt that neither option was
acceptable, so they moved the
class off campus.
"Even though we believe that
we're not in violation of Title IX,
there has been no ruling by the
Office of Civil Rights," Katz said.
"We have to show by way of peti
tions, letters of support and the
rally that the class is something
worth putting the time and risk
for."
Members of the collective
have been gathering letters of
support and signatures on a peti
tion calling for the class' return
to campus since last month.
More than 1,000 signatures have
been obtained, Katz said.
