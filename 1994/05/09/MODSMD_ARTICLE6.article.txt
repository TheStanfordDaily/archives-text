### September Trevino StafF writer 
The past, present and future of
literary disciplines within the con
temporary university was the
major focus of a two-day confer
ence sponsored by the University's
foreign language and literature de
partments.
The conference, "Disciplining
Literature: Pasts, Presents, and
Futures for Literary Study,"
began Friday and concluded with a
roundtable discussion Saturday
afternoon in the Humanities Cen

ter Annex.
The conference drew academics
from around the country anxious
to address some of the major issues
facing literary disciplines and the
struggle to increase support for lit
erature programs within the mod
ern university.
"I think we need distribution
requirements," said Mary Louise
Pratt, a professor in the Spanish
and Portuguese Department. "We
need spaces that are protected in
the university to make it possible
for students to study and read liter
ature. Otherwise, those spaces will
be colonized by other fields."
Pratt also emphasized that the
vision of a community of scholars is
held together by a common commit
ment to a common tradition, assert
ing that fragmentation is not the
solution.
Luigi Ballerini, chair of the Italian

Department at UCLA, added, "What
does matter is not so much the
preservation of a canon, but the pos
sibility of preserving an attitude."
The discussion also focused on
the direction scholars should lead
students in order to contribute to
the development of literary study.
It is imperative to teach students
the mechanics of language, Ballerini
said, insisting that the more stu
dents know about the history and
construction of words, the more
enjoyment they will extract from lit
erature.

Charles Bernheimer, a professor
of French and comparative litera
ture at the University of Pennsylva
nia, commented on the importance
of allowing oneself to become
enchanted by a text: "What we want
to do is teach our students the fear
ful magic that is involved in allow
ing ourselves to be haunted."
English Prof. Maijorie PerlofT,
however, reasserted the importance
of discussing the future of a disci
pline where promising Ph.D. candi
dates fail to get jobs.
But she ended the discussion on

a positive note, saying, "The prob
lem is not the students. Students
have never been more enthusiastic
about writing. There's incredible
work out there being written."
Other panelists included Jean
Marie Apostolides, a professor in
the Drama and French and Italian
Departments.
Departments of Comparative
Literature, English, French and
Italian, German Studies, Slavic
Studies, Spanish and Portuguese
and Asian Studies sponsored the
conference.
