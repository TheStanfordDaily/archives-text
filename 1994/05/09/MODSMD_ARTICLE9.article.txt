Panama vote held
PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) -
Panamanians voted for president yester
day lor the first time since Guillermo
Endara was installed during a U.S. mili
tary invasion.
Turnout appeared to be heavy as
thousands of voters lined up at scores of
voting stations around the capital. The
independent Electoral Tribunal said vot
ing was going smoothly.
The last elections, held in May 1989,
were annulled by (Jen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega when it became apparent his
hand-picked candidate would lose to
Endara.
The elections, witnessed by some
1,200 international and Panamanian
observers, are seen as a test of the Cen
tral American nation's democracy, espe

cially since Endara's Arnulfista purty is
likely to lose power.

aimed at building support for an amend
ment that Rep. Joe Kennedy, D-Mass.,
