# Grading proposal discussed
## 
### Justin Dawe Staff writer 
Debating the relative merits of
proposed changes to the grading
policy, members of the Committee
on Academic Appraisal and
Achievement solicited student
input in a town hall meeting last
night in Kimball Hall.
After explaining that the com
mittee only wants to provide a his
torical record of student perfor
mances, not to combat grade infla
tion, six committee members and
15 interested students went on to
discuss the finer points of the plan,
upon which the Faculty Senate will
vote May 26.
Citing requests from the Busi
ness and Law Schools, members of
the committee stressed the impor
tance of being more forthright on
transcripts. They also noted the
generally "laughable" reputation
of student transcripts from Brown
University — the only other top
university to use the "record of
achievement" — as support for the
adoption of the historical record.
The committee recommenda
tions propose the advent of a failing
grade of NP (not passed), as well as
a W notation when students with
draw from classes after the third
week of the quarter.
The plan would also move
add/drop deadline up to the third
week of the quarter. The deadline
for declaring the pass/no credit
option would be pushed back to
week six.
Student complaints were gener
ally directed against the proposed
withdraw notation and the squeez
ing of the add/drop deadline. One
student suggested that those in

small classes may not be able to add
a class until other class members
drop — often late in the quarter.
Faculty were more interested in
"conserving precious economic
resources," said Geology Prof. Gail
Mahood, the committee's chair.
They repeated several times that
about $85,000 was spent last year
to pay for extra chemistry teaching
assistants due to the high number
of people retaking the course.
Religious Studies Prof. Van Har
vey, a committee member, stressed

that withdraws and incremental
grade differences are not ascrucial
in graduate school and professional
acceptance as students believe.
Students also suggested making
transcripts more useful by adding
course descriptions and an official
letter grade indicator. Committee
members, though, noted that stu
dents asked for the removal of the
letter grade indicator just a few
years ago.
There will be another meeting
today at 6:30 p.m. in Roble lounge.
