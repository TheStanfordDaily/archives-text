## Mandela elected as new president South African parliament selects country's first black leader 
### 
CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) - A
new parliament as multi-colored as the
nation chose Nelson Mandela as the first
black president of South Africa yester
day. To delirious cheers, he accepted his
people's salute from the same balcony
where he spoke after emerging from
prison four years ago.
Grown men cried and white police
officers clapped as the 75-year-old who
has promised a South Africa for "all its
people black and white" stepped forth to
receive the adulation of 50,000 people
spread out on Cape Town's grand
parade.
"South Africa, we love you, our beau
tiful land," sang the crowd to the beat of
the "Peace Song," a pop tune that has
become the anthem of the country's
transition from apartheid to democracy.
A sea of arms swayed back and forth

to the music as the new multi-hued
South African flag — red, blue, black,
green, gold and white — fluttered in the
fresh sea breeze of a picture-perfect
autumn day in the Southern Hemi
sphere.
In a show of reconciliation, Mandela
and his main black rival, Zulu nationalist
leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi, hugged
and shook hands.
But all was not picture-perfect when
Mandela and his estranged wife, Winnie,
took the parliamentary oath together
with eight others as new members of the
National Assembly. He never looked at
her nor acknowledged her presence, even
when she sat next to him.
The snub showed the extent of Mrs.
Mandela's exclusion from the inner circle
of African National Congress leaders,
despite her popularity among militants.

The couple had been married for 34 years
when they separated in 1992 after Mrs.
Mandela was convicted of kidnapping
and linked to an extramarital affair.
She expressed hope recently of reunit
ing with her husband, an idea he rejected.
Departing President F.W. de Klerk,
with whom Mandela shared the 1993
Nobel Peace Prize for negotiating the end
of apartheid, was among those cheering
the man who bested him in the country's
first multiracial elections. Mandela will
assume power Tuesday at his inaugura
tion at the Union Buildings in Pretoria.
About 150,000 people are expected at
the inauguration in the country's admin
istrative capital. Foreign guests include
Hillary Rodham Clinton, Vice President
A 1 Gore, Britain's Prince Philip and
Palestine Liberation Organization chair
man Yasser Arafat.
