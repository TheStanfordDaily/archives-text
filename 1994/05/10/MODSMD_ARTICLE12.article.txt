## Editorial Students speak out Participation in Honor Code survey and grading policy forum is essential 
### 
Students often complain
about not having a say in Uni
versity policy-making. But this
week some students will have two
chances to "fight the power" and
make a statement on two important
issues that directly affect them and
the entire Stanford experience — a
survey on the Honor Code and a
forum about the proposed changes
to the grading policy.
Sometime in the next few days
you may find a curious envelope in
your mailbox. Although the Stan
ford return address may elicit a
cringe — after all, University bills
often come masked in seemingly
innocent envelopes — don't fear it.
Open it up, because you may be one
of 2,000 students randomly selected
to fill out an upcoming survey spon
sored by the Student Conduct Leg
islative Council.
This survey will ask roughly 50
questions about a variety of topics,
including cheating, attitudes toward
the Honor Code and collaboration on
assignments. The purpose of the
survey is to see shifts in Stanford's
attitudes toward the Honor Code
and academic honesty. Inevitably,
time affects changes in attitudes.
Because new questions about the
Hondfr-Clkte continually arise, it is
important that students who receive
the survey in the mail fill it out — so
the Honor Code can be adapted to
accommodate current concerns and
topics. It is an opportunity for stu
dents to voice their opinion about a
set of regulations which often seem
ambiguous. Not only will they be
able to articulate concerns, but they
may even be listened to.
According to Communication
Prof. Steven Chaffee, an SCLC
member, new questions have been
added to the survey since the last
one was conducted in 1990. Of par

ticular concern is the Honor Code's
statements on group projects and
how they should be handled in terms
of grading and dissemination of indi
vidual work. The results of the sur
vey will help the SCLC develop
guidelines so the Honor Code's rules
can be more explicit. Right now, the
Code does not outline specific rules
on student collaboration; it only pro
hibits unpermitted student partner
ship on assignments.
During the 1992-93 academic
year 40 Honor Code violations were
reported — twice as many as the pre
vious year. If this survey is to serve
as the beginning of a comprehensive
review of the Code as Mary
Edmonds, vice provost and dean for
student affairs, said last October,
then students who receive the sur
vey in the mail should take the time
to fill it out, because their answers
can make a difference.
But participation in setting policy
should not stop with the survey.
Tonight is the second of two meet
ings on the proposed changes in the
grading policy. Judging from stu
dents' responses after the policy was
announced two weeks ago, they are
upset. And rightfully so.
Many students feel that they were
not properly consulted about bring
ing back the F grade (with the new
name "NP") and moving the
drop/add deadline to the third week
of the quarter.
Today is the chance, and possibly
the last chance, for student voices to
be heard. Showing up in large num
bers may be the only way students
can send the message to the faculty
and administration that many are
unhappy with certain aspects of the
new policy — and for this message
to get across, there must be a better
turnout than last night's crowd of
only about 15 students.
Gail Mahood, the chair of the Fac
ulty Senate's Committee on Aca
demics Approval and Achievement,
said "Something like this (grading
policy) is what the faculty wants."
She may have forgotten that a few
thousand other people may want
something else. And this is their
opportunity to voice their opinions.
