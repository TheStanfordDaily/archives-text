## Was the strike worth it? 
### 
-IAM SURE going to miss eating
grapes. Or at least California grapes.
In order to assuage my conscience I
guess that I'll have to start eating
Chilean grapes, gathered by Chileans
who were sprayed by fellow Chileans
with pesticides 10 times more deadly
than the ones used here, but who have
fewer channels for complaints and treat
ment of health problems.
Well, I was convinced to give up my
beloved grapes by the students who were
fasting in the Inner Quad. I mean, a
hunger strike is a serious thing. There was
a woman who fasted for three weeks to
protest the detainment of several Irish
youths by the British in Northern Ireland.
She committed suicide a year later. Psy
chiatrists claimed that her suicide was a
result of psychological problems that arose
from the hunger fast. This most recent
campus fast was spurred, at least in part,
by that incident at Flicks last week.
Oh, yes, and how could we condemn
those who acted like imbeciles when the
film on the grape pickers was shown?
Obviously, these brilliant Stanford stu
dents were upset that their precious time
was squandered before the showing of
"Mrs. Doubtfire."
In our society the perpetrator is the
victim and these students felt that they
were being ruthlessly indoctrinated by
the Fascist Flicks Directors. So they had
no choice whatsoever but to hurl negative
comments at the screen in order to voice

their protest and protect their gelatinous
gray matter from some permanent
impression.
But the question is whether these evo
lutionary offramps would have been as
vehement in their disgruntlement if a dif
ferent type of documentary had been
shown. And it is this idea that may have
angered the fasters.
The ideological commitment behind
the hunger strike was something great. It
is the very basic act of protest — to deny
oneself food because the entire system
has become too unjust.
But in order to be taken seriously, a
protester must make others believe that
he is ready to risk death. If a ahingle of
doubt remains, it takes away from the
bargaining power. A great example is
Gandhi. The British were scared silly at
the prospect of Gandhi starving to death
inside a prison. They had to release him
lest his death provoke national outrage.
These protesters came up with a list of
demands to be met before they would
begin to eat. Some of these demands were
quite legitimate, others do not seem wor
thy of risking one's life. If these demands
do not appear practical, the impact of a
hunger strike can be lessened. Surely one
can do more toward establishing a com
munity center alive than dead.
The community center in East Palo
Alto is a great idea, it would be a Hull
House for the '90s. In the face of spend
ing cuts for education, a community cen

ter that offers classes and services would
be a boon to the community.
To what degree, however, does Ger
hard Casper bear the obligation for pro
viding a community center? Stanford is
supposedly in the business of educating
students. If the current trend of using
community service as a punishment in
civil cases is strong enough, perhaps
rather than paying the government,
Stanford could be sentenced to build the
center and everyone might be happy.
The demand for more ChicaiU) repre
sentation in the wake of Cecilia Burcia
ga's termination was somewhat Tnrnercs
sary. I mean, the "ethnically insensitive"
Casper administration did just appoint
Ramon Saldivar as the dean for under
graduate studies and spared the ethnic
centers from budget cuts.
Sure, Casper capitulated on some
points, but was it worth the hunger
strike? What will students do in the
future to protest? The students going on
hunger strike are to be commended — in
our age of apathy, they've found a cause
worth fighting for — but was the forma
tion of a couple of committees worth the
trouble?
