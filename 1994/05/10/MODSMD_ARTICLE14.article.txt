## More awareness, pressure needed for justice in Haiti 
### 
THE LAST FEW months have seen
an acute deterioration in the human
rights situation in Haiti, with mas
sive killing and mutilation of supporters of
the exiled constitutional and democratical
ly-elected president, Jean-Bertrand Aris
tide. The killings were carried out by death
squads probably acting under the auspices
of Michel Francois, the chief of police, and
perhaps other members of the Army High
Command.
This deadly repression has accompanied
a "sham" embargo implemented in such a
way that only poor people and legitimate
businesses suffer and humanitarian condi
tions worsen, while the militaiy and their
allies who have engaged in smuggling
drugs and scarce goods benefit.
Only this weekend did Clinton finally
move to overturn a racist policy of forced
repatriation which violated international
law, despite his campaign promise to do so
upon his election.
President Aristide's April 18 visit to

campus was encouraging, focusing Stan
ford's attention on the plight of a suffering
people. Students, faculty and other mem
bers of the Stanford community should fol
low up with concrete and decisive action.
A special effort must be made to inform
oneself about what is really transpiring in
the Haitian countryside, in Port-au-Prince
and in Washington policy-making circles.,
Writing to the White House, to Congress,
speaking out in the media and participating
in upcoming local events such as the rally
at Palo Alto City Hall this morning are key.
The nearly month-long hunger strike of
Randall Robinson, and other similar ges
tures at Berkeley and across the country,
demonstrated that pressure can be fruitful.
Thus, this influential sector of American
society's support is particularly crucial dur
ing this era of surviving Cold War politi
cians in government circles, fluidity in
Congress, and lack of resolve in an unde
cided, reluctant White House. We cannot
afford to be complacent.

Specifically, suspension of non-commer
cial flights used by smugglers, travel
restrictions for families of the coup leaders,
and sealing off of the Dominican border is
needed to hit the embargo's intended sec
tors. The general population must be given
a humanitarian reprieve.
Finally, it must be emphasi2ed that a
unilateral United States invasion of Haiti is
the worst possible scenario. First, whatever
the "good" intentions of an invader in
influencing internal events or ousting
"heinous" rulers in the land invaded, mili
tary invasion of a foreign country is a clear
violation of international law, be it Hun
gary, Bosnia, Tibet, Afghanistan, Grenada,
Panama or Kuwait.
Secondly, this invasion would most like
ly take place without any approval or even
consultation with President Aristide or
other representative leaders of the Haitian
people. Aristide opposes being restored to
power by a foreign army for reasons of
national sovereignty, maintaining that

were he to accept the presidency in the
aflermath of a foreign invasion, "legally, he
would have to be impeached for violating
the constitution." Contrary to his critics'
assertions, he has consistently advocated a
non-violent solution.
Finally, this invasion would likely bear
results in the interests of the invaders,
which, contrary to the naive expectation of
some, may be different, even diametrically
opposed to the true interests of the majori
ty of the Haitian people. A possible role for
the United Nations or a neutral coalition
of regional nations must be examined
within the context of a Haitian-initiated
solution.
So, the media and the public must
remember that not invading a country does
not mean turning your back on it. Histori
cally, concerted international action
between those extremes has proven the
most successful.
