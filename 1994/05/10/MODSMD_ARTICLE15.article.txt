# Edmonds and Jackson condemn insensitivity at 'No Grapes' showing
## 
### 
We are writing to express our disap
pointment and indignation with audience
members who slandered Chicano students
and denigrated the needs of farm workers
at the May 1 Flicks. Such behavior goes
against the standards of conduct at Stan
ford that the vast majority of students, fac
ulty, staff and alumni support and expect.
The offensive comments made by some
were a misguided way to express an opin
ion. While not prohibited expression, it
was certainly a cowardly way to test the
limits of free speech. These irresponsible
statements have polluted the environ
ment, created unnecessary tensions, and
injured all of us by fomenting.
We also take exception to The Daily's

May 4 editorial "Fixing Flicks' fiasco" about
the Sunday Flicks incident. We believe and
hope that the Daily editorial staff agrees
that such bigoted comments as "go home
beaners" and "yes, pesticides" and applause
after such comments are unacceptable.
As individuals who are members of dif
ferent identity groups in an educational
community, we cannot escape the impact
of social events. We must all try to learn
that off-hand comments can exacerbate
the real social and historical pain of differ
ent members of our community. Thus, in
our diverse community, it is essential that
we all accept responsibility for maintain
ing a respectful environment. A strong
learning community depends upon indi
vidual self-discipline and mutual respect
to enhance the well-being of all its mem
bers: students, faculty, and staff.
Stanford is committed to the active
promotion of racial understanding; it
works hard to create open, honest, and
equitable treatment for everyone. Most

would agree that we have been successful
in overcoming many institutional barriers
for many groups. Most would also agree
that we have a great deal of work ahead of
us. The event at the May 1 Flicks is a
reminder of how far we have yet to go and
our need for continuing discussion and
education about these issues.
