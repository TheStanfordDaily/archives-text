# Faculty Senate doesn't approve of the remarks made at Flicks incident
## 
### 
The Steering Committee of the Fac
ulty Senate wishes to express its dis
may at the abusive remarks and racial

slurs shouted during the May 1 show
ing of "No Grapes" at Flicks on the
Stanford campus.
The Stanford administration and
faculty together have a strong commit
ment to make this University hos
pitable to members of all races and eth
nic groups, where individuals from all
groups can pursue their shared com
mitments to education and scholarship
in a welcoming atmosphere. The Steer
ing Committee believes administrators
and faculty have been working diligent
ly towards this goal.
We deeply regret this recent inci
dent and hope the realization of what
has happened can serve to educate us
all in the need to continue working
together in a civil and respectful fash
ion.
Marion Lewenstein
Academic Secretary to the University
Writing on behalf of the Steering Com
mittee of the 26th Faculty Senate
