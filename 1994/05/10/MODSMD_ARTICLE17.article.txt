# N'Gai Croal: fly in the buttermilk
## Please, be very careful what you write about... 
### 
Outside, the full moon cast its
malevolent gaze upon the dank city
streets choked with a dense fog that
crept ever closer, cutting its way through
the autumn air, curling around lamp
posts, slinking below windowsills and
vaulting over rooftops; and it was this fog
that blocked my muse from view as he
rode his horse at a deliberate pace away
from my house.
It was on this night two score years ago
that I had purchased him, a wan, fright
ened youth, from an old beggar in Ijow
town. He had inspired me by day to ever
greater feats of literary achievement, and
by night, he kept me warm and gratified.
He would sit silently for hours, completely
unclad (for I never permitted him to wear
any clothes) as I wrote page upon page of
glorious prose, pausing only to dip my
quill in its inkwell or to gaze upon his
sculpted physique. It was in this manner
that I produced countless works of art,
each more acclaimed than the one that
preceded it.
And now, now that I was prepared to
create my pidce de resistance, after which I
would retire to the country with only my
muse to keep me company, he informed
me that his servitude was ended and that
he was leaving. I pleaded with him to
stay, explaining that once I had written
this last work I would release him with a
fortune in gold; still, he refused.
But 1 also knew that I did not need
him; I had been a novelist long before I

purchased him, and a novelist I would
remain. Before me sat a sheaf of blank
paper, my quill and my inkwell. I looked
at each of them, hoping that would give
me the impetus I required to begin what
was sure to be my finest work.
I took the inkwell in my free hand and
brought it to my face so that I might exam
ine its contents. It seemed ordinary
enough, but as I stared inside, its base
receded at an ever-increasing rate until it
seemed to open up a passageway straight
to the Abyss, emitting a rotting smell that
I took for sulfur. Dazed, I let the inkwell
slip from my grasp, and its contents oozed
across the virgin sheets of paper, quickly
congealing into a clotted mass.
A cold draft crawled along my legs like
a million newborn spiders. I glanced
around, and to my horror, every window
was ajar and the mist was slowly moving
across the floor from every breach, con
verging on my desk like predatory phan
tasms come to collect my soul. I fell to the
floor in a quivering heap and pulled my
robes to me as I watched the fog come clos
er and waited for it to devour me as I
knew it must.
Whoever said this Gothic stuff was
hard didn't know shit from
shoeshine. I'd been writing since
early afternoon and I was already half
done. It was time for a cigarette break.
It was my publisher's idea to try some
thing new. Something original. Even

though my "Black Mask" books were sell
ing like wildfire, he thought I should
knock out something different under
another name. So I stopped by the store,
picked up a bottle of tequila and some
paper and started banging it out.
I'd had this idea about some dame in
19th century London who was going crazy
because she couldn't write anymore. My
editor didn't think much of it, but as long
as my stuff had the right amount of sex
and violence, he didn't care if I wrote
about Jesus Christ himself.
I ground out my cigarette and took a
shot of the tequila. Just as I was about to
start up again, the phone rang. I wanted
to let it keep on ringing but I knew if I did
it wouldn't stop. Most people who called
me, like my editor or my bookie, were
pretty persistent.
I picked up the phone. "Yeah?"
"Jim?" Ginny was crying on the other
end of the line. "Is that you?"
I hung up. If she thought she was
going to trap Jimmy Burke into marrying
her, she had another thing coming.
Besides, it wasn't like I was the only guy
she was sporting. Just because I had
money and class didn't mean I was a sap.
The phone rang again.
"Yeah?"
"Jimmy, don't hang up on — "
Too late. I'd already hung up the phone.
I started typing again. If I could get this
done by morning, it would mean a bigger
payday this weekend. Samantha'd been

aller me all month to take her down the
coast. Her father didn't much like me, but
now that she was legal what could he do?
I laughed out loud, thinking back to
when the Senator caught us all stretched
out in her teddy bear collection. I remind
ed the Senator just who took care of that
business for him. I asked him if he wanted
me to discuss it with Mrs. Evans. He shut
his trap after that.
The phone rang again. I let it keep
going. After a couple of minutes, I picked
it up.
"Yeah?"
"You'll be sorry," I heard a pop, then
another "You'll be sorry," but it could have
been my imagination. The line went dead.
I guess she got the picture. I turned
back to the typewriter. The page was full.
I took it out and put in a fresh one. But I
couldn't figure out where to go with the
story. I mean, the character had just lost
all her marbles. I could have had her put a
couple of slugs in her head, but I'd already
done that in "The Pussycat Club
Killings." Poison, pills and slashed wrists
were out — the woman in "Near Dark
Past Death" had done all three.
I poured myself another shot and
stared out the window. I couldn't see
much, what with the mist and all. Then it
hit me. Random. That's what I needed:
something random to get the story mov
ing again. But what? I kept looking out
the window for inspiration, but there was
only fog as far as I could see.

/" ve just about finished this story. The
sun's starting to come up, but the fog 's
so thick I '11 bet even the sunlight can't
cut through it. I've actually been done for
a couple of hours. All I need is a last line.
When I started this workshop, the first
thing they said was, write what you know.
Well I'm a journalist, which means that
fiction isn't my thing. So I picked a couple
of people whose styles I liked and threw
them together and the class seemed to like
it better. Just like a reporter. I don't create,
I just synthesize other people's thoughts
and words into something coherent.
It isn't easy. Especially the last line,
which has to sum up my theme without
being obvious or clicked or obscure. And I
won't find any inspiration staring at the
screen of my PowerPC. I keep trying to
write but I can't; the words won't come.
Maybe if I just keep typing something
will come out something thai I can use as
the last line in my story... like he takes out
his revolver and shoots himself and his
brains splatter against the typewriter...no
it's too obvious how about the gun went off
but it didn't kill him it exploded in his
hand...still too literal maybe his head came
to rest gently against the keys of his beloved
typewriter... that's so cheesy think think
THINK if he can't WRITE what would he
do ohmygod that's it what if the very same
thing happened to my writer's block

paper, my quill and my inkwell. I looked
at each of them, hoping that would give
me the impetus I required to begin what
was sure to be my finest work.
I took the inkwell in my free hand and
brought it to my face so that I might exam
ine its contents. It seemed ordinary
enough, but as I stared inside, its base
receded at an ever-increasing rate until it
seemed to open up a passageway straight
to the Abyss, emitting a rotting smell that
I took for sulfur. Dazed, I let the inkwell
slip from my grasp, and its contents oozed
across the virgin sheets of paper, quickly
congealing into a clotted mass.
A cold draft crawled along my legs like
a million newborn spiders. I glanced
around, and to my horror, every window
was ajar and the mist was slowly moving
across the floor from every breach, con
verging on my desk like predatory phan
tasms come to collect my soul. I fell to the
floor in a quivering heap and pulled my
robes to me as I watched the fog come clos
er and waited for it to devour me as I
knew it must.
Whoever said this Gothic stuff was
hard didn't know shit from
shoeshine. I'd been writing since
early afternoon and I was already half
done. It was time for a cigarette break.
It was my publisher's idea to try some
thing new. Something original. Even

though my "Black Mask" books were sell
ing like wildfire, he thought I should
knock out something different under
another name. So I stopped by the store,
picked up a bottle of tequila and some
paper and started banging it out.
I'd had this idea about some dame in
19th century London who was going crazy
because she couldn't write anymore. My
editor didn't think much of it, but as long
as my stuff had the right amount of sex
and violence, he didn't care if I wrote
about Jesus Christ himself.
I ground out my cigarette and took a
shot of the tequila. Just as I was about to
start up again, the phone rang. I wanted
to let it keep on ringing but I knew if I did
it wouldn't stop. Most people who called
me, like my editor or my bookie, were
pretty persistent.
I picked up the phone. "Yeah?"
"Jim?" Ginny was crying on the other
end of the line. "Is that you?"
I hung up. If she thought she was
going to trap Jimmy Burke into marrying
her, she had another thing coming.
Besides, it wasn't like I was the only guy
she was sporting. Just because I had
money and class didn't mean I was a sap.
The phone rang again.
"Yeah?"
"Jimmy, don't hang up on — "
Too late. I'd already hung up the phone.
I started typing again. If I could get this
done by morning, it would mean a bigger
payday this weekend. Samantha'd been

aller me all month to take her down the
coast. Her father didn't much like me, but
now that she was legal what could he do?
I laughed out loud, thinking back to
when the Senator caught us all stretched
out in her teddy bear collection. I remind
ed the Senator just who took care of that
business for him. I asked him if he wanted
me to discuss it with Mrs. Evans. He shut
his trap after that.
The phone rang again. I let it keep
going. After a couple of minutes, I picked
it up.
"Yeah?"
"You'll be sorry," I heard a pop, then
another "You'll be sorry," but it could have
been my imagination. The line went dead.
I guess she got the picture. I turned
back to the typewriter. The page was full.
I took it out and put in a fresh one. But I
couldn't figure out where to go with the
story. I mean, the character had just lost
all her marbles. I could have had her put a
couple of slugs in her head, but I'd already
done that in "The Pussycat Club
Killings." Poison, pills and slashed wrists
were out — the woman in "Near Dark
Past Death" had done all three.
I poured myself another shot and
stared out the window. I couldn't see
much, what with the mist and all. Then it
hit me. Random. That's what I needed:
something random to get the story mov
ing again. But what? I kept looking out
the window for inspiration, but there was
only fog as far as I could see.

/" ve just about finished this story. The
sun's starting to come up, but the fog 's
so thick I '11 bet even the sunlight can't
cut through it. I've actually been done for
a couple of hours. All I need is a last line.
When I started this workshop, the first
thing they said was, write what you know.
Well I'm a journalist, which means that
fiction isn't my thing. So I picked a couple
of people whose styles I liked and threw
them together and the class seemed to like
it better. Just like a reporter. I don't create,
I just synthesize other people's thoughts
and words into something coherent.
It isn't easy. Especially the last line,
which has to sum up my theme without
being obvious or clicked or obscure. And I
won't find any inspiration staring at the
screen of my PowerPC. I keep trying to
write but I can't; the words won't come.
Maybe if I just keep typing something
will come out something thai I can use as
the last line in my story... like he takes out
his revolver and shoots himself and his
brains splatter against the typewriter...no
it's too obvious how about the gun went off
but it didn't kill him it exploded in his
hand...still too literal maybe his head came
to rest gently against the keys of his beloved
typewriter... that's so cheesy think think
THINK if he can't WRITE what would he
do ohmygod that's it what if the very same
thing happened to my writer's block

Outside, the full moon cast its
malevolent gaze upon the dank city
streets choked with a dense fog that
crept ever closer, cutting its way through
the autumn air, curling around lamp
posts, slinking below windowsills and
vaulting over rooftops; and it was this fog
that blocked my muse from view as he
rode his horse at a deliberate pace away
from my house.
It was on this night two score years ago
that I had purchased him, a wan, fright
ened youth, from an old beggar in Ijow
town. He had inspired me by day to ever
greater feats of literary achievement, and
by night, he kept me warm and gratified.
He would sit silently for hours, completely
unclad (for I never permitted him to wear
any clothes) as I wrote page upon page of
glorious prose, pausing only to dip my
quill in its inkwell or to gaze upon his
sculpted physique. It was in this manner
that I produced countless works of art,
each more acclaimed than the one that
preceded it.
And now, now that I was prepared to
create my pidce de resistance, after which I
would retire to the country with only my
muse to keep me company, he informed
me that his servitude was ended and that
he was leaving. I pleaded with him to
stay, explaining that once I had written
this last work I would release him with a
fortune in gold; still, he refused.
But 1 also knew that I did not need
him; I had been a novelist long before I

purchased him, and a novelist I would
remain. Before me sat a sheaf of blank
paper, my quill and my inkwell. I looked
at each of them, hoping that would give
