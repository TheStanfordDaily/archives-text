## Where everybody knows your name Cheers to the women's golf squad, which prides itself on team spirit, friendship 
### Seth Goldstein Staff writer 
The game of golf is a lonely one. There are not
many opportunities for companionship out on
the links. A golfer is a solitary figure, playing
against the landscape and the elements,
attempting to overcome his or her own short
comings. The few others who experience the
same types of sensations and frustrations com
pete for the same sparse rewards. This competi
tion often creates an unbridgeable gap between
golfers.
So golfers become islands, separated from
each other by an ocean of emotions and rivalries.
However, there are times when golfers play
together, not as opponents but as teammates.
NCAA competition is one of these times. While
there still are individual concerns, golfers must
take a team perspective for one of the few times
in their careers.
For the fourth-ranked Stanford women's golf
team, the change has not been difficult. In a
sport where personal considerations have the
potential to be incredibly divisive, they have
managed to foster an unusual sense of team
unity.
"It's kind of funny," said senior Melinda
Daniels. "Some of the other teams really hate
each other. They have bitter rivalries. But we're
best friends."
This is good news for head coach Tim Bald
win. He does not have to add internal strife to an
already long list of things to do.
"It's a survival thing, really," Baldwin said.
"We play difficult tournaments on difficult
courses in difficult weather. We're on the road
all the time and the women are together a lot.
It's important for them to have the support of
their teammates. There are too many other
problems to worry about."
This sense of friendship and companionship
manifests itself in different ways. Some of the
women choose to live together, but all of them do
things with each other.
"We go out together — shopping or to base
ball or basketball games," said junior Jamille
Jose. "We laugh a lot. Some of my teammates
watch 'Beverly Hills, 90210' together."
It helps that they have a lot in common,
besides just golf. One of these interests is bas
ketball. During the winter, the women play on
an intramural basketball squad and the team
managed to win its division.
"Mel(inda) and Amy (Lawrence) are the real
stars of the team," Jose said. "I'm the designat
ed point guard and I try to shoot as little as pos
sible."
While this year's squad may be a model for
unity, this was not always the case in the past.
There may not have been any discord, but there
wasn't any sense of sisterhood, either.
"When I was a freshman, I sort of felt left
out," Daniels said. "There were no sophomores
on the team and the upperclassmen sort of did
their own thing. But the next year, Amy and
Jamille came in and after them came Julie
(Bowen) and Vicky (Strada)."
Jose also saw the changes taking place.
According to her, it was not like her freshman
year at all. However, as that year went on, she
said the younger players got to know each other
better.
Team unity starts with the introduction and
acceptance of the freshman. The integration of
freshman into the team is helped by a freshman
initiation.
"It changes year to year," said Jose. "Some
times people get thrown in a pool or other things
like that. It's a team bonding sort of thing."
The freshmen do not seem to mind, as they
see it as being part of a team.
"They (the upperclassmen) order us around
and tell us do things, but at the end they tell us
they won't treat us like freshmen anymore," said
freshman Andrea Baxter. "The upperclassmen

are really good about calling us up to go out and
do stuff. And they tell us about what to expect
down the road, both on the course and off."
McKay has also found her teammates helpful,
as they gave her an introduction to the system as
well as eased the transition from high school to
college.
While the younger players look to the juniors
and seniors for guidance, the upperclassmen are
reluctant to admit they are leaders.
"I suppose they look to us for leadership, but
it's not a hierarchy," said Jose. "We all respect
each other. It's pretty even across the board."
They have managed to maintain this mutual
respect in an environment not conducive to it.
Before each and every tournament, the women
must play an intra-squad qualifier to determine
which five will compete.
"This is the worst thing we have to do,"
McKay said. "It's not a nice feeling to have to
play against your friends. But whoever misses
out has been really good about it."
Baxter agreed with this assessment.
"We don't like to talk about it," she said. "We
just all go out and do our thing. We accept the
results and move on."

Baldwin sympathizes with his players' plight,
but believes they are capable of dealing with the
hardships of the process.
Despite all the pressures conspiring to pull
them apart, this Cardinal squad has kept the
focus on the team aspect of golf — as small as it
may be. There really is no concrete reason why
this is so, just the right mix of players at the right
time.
"Our personalities just mesh together so
well," said Daniels.
Baldwin also realizes how lucky he is to have
such a cohesive unit. Other golf teams around
the nation employ a nutritionist, a trainer or a
sports psychologist to help develop what has
come naturally to Stanford's squad.
"If you push a team unity thing, it will back
fire," he said. "I don't push it. I just let them
know that I know how difficult this game is. I've
personally gone through all the agonies and
ecstasies they've gone through — I've been down
that path. I encourage them to look to each other
for support. After all, no one knows better what
they experience than they do."
The result has been team harmony. And it
makes the game of golf a little less lonely.
