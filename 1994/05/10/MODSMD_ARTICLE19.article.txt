## Baseball looks to undermine Aggies 
### Andy Eiser Senior staff writer 
Talk about a tough act to fol
low.
Still basking in the glow of
Jason Middlebrook's no-hitter,
which capped a sweep of confer
ence rival UCLA Sunday, the
No. 12 Cardinal baseball team
plays its regular-season home
finale against the UC-Davis
Aggies today at Sunken Dia
mond.
Beyond the drama and excite
ment it added to an already spec
tacular weekend, Middlebrook's
accomplishment secured a two
game Pacific 10 Conference
Southern Division lead for Stan
ford (34-20) heading into this
weekend's showdown with sec
ond-place Arizona State in
Tempe, Ariz.
"Now we only need to win one
next weekend, and that makes a
really big difference when you
play ASU," said Cardinal junior
second baseman Jed Hansen.
"We got a sweep, and we can
carry our momentum down
there."
In order to enter the Valley of
the Sun with a winning streak,
however, Stanford must solve
the Aggies today. No pushover,
Davis sports a stratospheric 38-9
overall record and ranks second
In the latest NCAA Division II
poll. The Aggies have outscored
their opponents by a ratio of
nearly 2:1 (305-155), bat for a
.296 team average and own a
scant 2.62 collective earned-run
average.

Ironically, Rich Watts, a
transfer from Arizona State,
leads Davis with a .391 average,
six home runs and 52 runs bat
ted in. Watts, a junior catcher,
anchors a hit parade for the
Aggies, as five members of the
everyday lineup stand over the
.300 mark as opposed to three
for Stanford.
Today's contest marks a mile
stone for one of the Cardinal's
top batters, as senior designated
hitter Nate Olmstead takes what
could be his final cuts on the
Sunken Diamond field against
his hometown team. Olmstead,
who attended Davis High
School, paces Stanford with a
.375 average this season. With a
6-for-12 performance against
UCLA, he boosted his career
mark to .337, ninth in the Cardi
nal record books if he can main
tain it.
But Middlebrook's brilliance
cannot be erased, as he enters
the ledgers alongside Paul
Grame, the last Stanford pitcher
to toss a solo no-hitter on Keb. 4,
1981.
"That was huge. Now we
need only one more win to
clinch," said freshman shortstop
Eric Sees, who fielded the final
out of Middlebrook's gem. "It
takes the pressure off."
The pressure is off today as
well, but the 2:30 p.m. start pro
vides Cardinal fans a final
chance to wish the team well.
For those who cannot attend,
KZSU (90.1 FM) will be on
hand, with Scott Reiss and
Angelo Puglisi calling the shots.
