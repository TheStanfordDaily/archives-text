## Final prep before nationals in 2 weeks

In spite of every obstacle
thrown in its way, the Stanford
cycling team pedaled to second
place in last weekend's Western
Collegiate Cycling Conference
Championships.
Stanford finished with a season
total of 1,605 points, managing to
edge UC-San Diego, ranked No. 2
going into the championships, by a
heart-stopping 12 points. As
expected, Cal Poly-SLO outdis
tanced the field to take first place.
Saturday's racing consisted of a
hilly road race and a windy team
time trial. These back-to-back
races did not favor the Cardinal
since, with fewer riders than the
other schools, its cyclists had to
distribute their strength and ride
in both. Nevertheless, Stanford
showed its strength in these races
with top finishes.
Junior Tracy Timms won in the
women's A division, with Stan
ford's scoring filled out by senior

Nicole Freedman (third), grad stu
dent Cynthia Ferguson (seventh),
and grad Bettina Romer (ninth).
Stanford's top three men's A
riders, though beset by difficulties,
placed 10th, 11th and 12th in the
road race.
Besides the As, all categories
contributed solid scoring in beat
ing the Tritons. Grad student Dan
Lyons raced well to finish third in
the men's Cs.
The men's B time trial squad
also proved this point by riding to
victory in their race, helping to
secure Stanford's second place fin
ish in the overall team time trial
scores.
"It was a big deal," coach Art
Walker said. "They beat very, very
good Cal Poly and Davis teams."
Grad student Dave Bailey was
the locomotive force that secured
this team time trial, or triple T,
upset.
"If I had to credit the victory to
one person, it would be Dave," said
