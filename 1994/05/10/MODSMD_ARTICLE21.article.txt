# Athletic great Taylor leaves Cardinal legacy
## 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
Chuck Taylor, one of the great
names in the history of Stanford
Athletics, died on Saturday at Stan
ford Hospital. He was 74.
Taylor was associated with Stan
ford for more than 50 years, having
served as an Ail-American football
player, head coach and Director of
Athletics. He holds the distinction
of being one of a select few persons
throughout college athletics to have
participated in a Rose Bowl in each
of those capacities.
"To me, he was the epitome of
Stanford University Athletics," said
former Associate Athletic Director
Gary Cavalli. "I don't think anyone
in college sports had as much suc
cess as a player, coach and adminis
trator."
"His entire life evolved with and
revolved around Stanford," added
Bob Murphy, the longtime voice of
Stanford football.
Taylor's ties with Stanford
began in 1939 when he enrolled as a
freshman. As a player, he was a
three-year letterman at offensive
guard for Stanford from 1940-1942,
earning First Team All-America
honors in 1942. He was also a mem
ber of Stanford's 1941 Rose Bowl

team, which defeated Nebraska 21-
13.
Following his graduation in
1942, Taylor served a three-year
stint in the United States Navy and
played a year of professional foot
ball.
In 1948, Taylor came back to the
Farm to coach the Stanford fresh
man team before becoming an assis
tant coach with the San Francisco
49ersfrom 1949-1950.
Taylor returned to Stanford in
1951 as head football coach, and
compiled a record of 40-29-2 in
seven seasons at the helm. In his
initial season as head coach, Stan
ford started the season 9-0, and the
media dubbed him the "Red
Thatched Mentor," for his bold pre
dictions each week. His predictions
ran out in week 10, as his squad lost
to Cal in the Big Game and to Illi
nois in the 1952 Rose Bowl. The
team finished with a 9-2 mark and a
number seven national ranking by
the Associated Press and United
Press International.
"He had a remarkable ability to
motivate young people," Murphy
said.
Moving from coaching to the
administrative ranks, Taylor served
as Director of Athletics from 1963-
1971. During his tenure, Stanford
won back-to-back Rose Bowls in
1971 and 1972 under head coach
John Ralston. He also was instru
mental in building the Stanford
Buck/Cardinal Club, the booster

group for Stanford Athletics, while
serving as Assistant Athletic Direc
tor from 1958-1963.
Taylor is survived by his wife
Margaret and his two children,
Susan and Doug, as well as seven
grandchildren. A memorial service
for friends and former players will
be held at, appropriately, Chuck
Taylor Grove, located adjacent to
Stanford Stadium, on Friday, May
20 at 4 p.m.
