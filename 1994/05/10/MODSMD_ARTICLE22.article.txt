# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
For many Stanford teams, the few weeks
left in the season may seem like the "dog
days of May." Waiting for regionals and
championships to start, they have to avoid
lulls which could damage postseason
chances. For Jason Middlebrook and Christy
Boyd, that hurdle was cleared this weekend,
both mentally and physically.

For their strong performances in clearing
these hurdles over the weekend, Middle
brook and Boyd have earned the honor of
Athletes of the Week.
Middlebrook, a freshman pitcher, cleared
a mental hurdle as he stunned the Sunken
Diamond crowd Sunday by tossing the sev
enth no-hitter in Cardinal history en route
to a 3-0 win over UCLA. Putting aside all the
pressure and superstition of throwing a no
hitter, he joined esteemed company in the
Stanford record books.
The Grass Lake, Mich, native, who
pushed his season record to 7-1, struck out
14 Bruin batters while walking seven. The
freshman's dominance was clear from the
beginning, as he fanned nine of the first 13
he faced. He has now struck out 62 in only 57
'2/3 innings of work. The shut-out also low
ered his ERA to 2.18, lowest of the Stanford
starters.
Middlebrook's effort on Sunday high
lights an already extraordinary first year as
a Cardinal. His hits-to-innings and strike
outs-per-innings ratios are lower than any
freshman pitcher in the last 13 years. That
span includes Major League stars Jack
McDowell, Mike Mussina and Jeff Ballard.

Across the Bay in Berkeley, Boyd left
plenty of hurdles behind her as she led Stan
ford to a near-upset of Cal's women's track
team. The junior co-captain mastered both

the 100-meter and 400-meter hurdles to
pace the Cardinal squad.
Hailing from Pleasanton, Calif., Boyd
recorded a time of 14.54 seconds in the 100-
meter hurdles, .34 seconds off her personal
best which she recorded last year. She cap
tured the 400-meter hurdle race with a time
of 1:02.2.
