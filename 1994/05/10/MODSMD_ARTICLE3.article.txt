# After the strike, a clear winner?
## News analysis 
### Romesh Ratnesar Editorial staff 
Saturday morning's press conference by
Chicano students and the administration
officially ending a three-day hunger strike
was supposed to be the easy part. Both sides
had spent most of the previous evening

pounding out the sub
stance of an agreement to
end the demonstration. On
Saturday, they were to
shake hands, read concilia-

toiy statements and resolve to move for
ward.
But things did not quite turn out as
planned. While a dreary rain fell, University
President Gerhard Casper and Provost

Condoleezza Rice squirmed uncomfortably
in their seats as the crowd of onlookers
chanted "Uvas, no! Chicano Studies, si!"
with increasing fervor. Then, in a scene that
recalled a similar meeting between Israel
and the Palestine Liberation Organization
last week, Casper refused to sign the written
agreement. For a moment, an ugly con
frontation seemed imminent; but Casper
and Rice, perhaps sensing disaster, relented.
The brief, tense ceremony was at once
extraordinaiy and fitting. While both sides
maintain their satisfaction with the agree
ment reached Friday night, the problems
the protest sought to solve — both tangible
and abstract — may still remain.
"This is a very good foundation," Casper
said after Saturday's ceremony. But the ad

ministration's reluctance to offer anything
beyond what it did — three committees that
will look into the prospects for a Chicano
Studies program, a ban on table grapes and
a community center in East Palo Alto —
demonstrates that expediency, rather than
foresight, was its utmost priority.
"I think from the administration's point
of view, they wanted this over fairly quick
ly," said graduate student Derek Miyahara,
resident fellow at Okada. "I think that the
settlement was one to get this thing to end."
From the start, Casper sought to defuse
the crisis by meeting with Chicano student
leaders on the first day of the strike and of
fering a response to their demands that
evening.
Casper's quick handling of the
strike and conciliatory style drew
praise yesterday from several
observers, including his predeces
sor, Donald Kennedy. "I know how
trying these things are," Kennedy
said. "The president and provost
made an enormous personal
involvement, and we should all
appreciate it."
And Political Science Prof.
Stephen Krasner said the strike
"came to a prudent conclusion."
Yet despite Casper's success in
bringing it to a close, the strike con
stituted the first sustained student
protest against his administration.
It is perhaps inevitable that the
strike will be examined by the pub
lic as a measure of his strength.
Kennedy, whose administration
gained publicity after 55 students
were arrested for occupying his
office in 1989, said that "the way

the administration is perceived out
side depends on how the media
choose to cover them — what kind
of spin is put on it. ... I don't know
what the coverage will be here."
So far, reviews have been mixed.
The Associated Press wrote that
Casper had conceded, "agreeing to
ask for reports on three issues
raised by the protesters." The pres
ident's news release, on the other
hand, claimed that it was instead
the protesters who ended the strike
after "accepting a statement by the
president and provost."
Indeed, exactly who conceded to
whom remains hard to discern.
After the president's statement was
announced late Friday night, strike
supporters put up posters claiming
that the president had bowed to the
protest's demands. But the agree
ment itself falls quite a ways short
of tangible concessions from the
administration.
"I would say they haven't gotten
anything in terms of some concrete
change in University policy," Krasner
said. "They have got a commitment
to look seriously at these issues."

In pure substance, Friday's
agreement differed little from the
original proposal offered by Casper
Wednesday evening: three commit
tees and a refusal to reconsider the
firing of Cecilia Burciaga, the Chi
cana administrator whose position
will be eliminated in August.
The administration's allowance
that it will "entertain" a proposal
for a Chicano Studies program next
fall seems the biggest break
through, and could well pave the
way to the ultimate establishment
of the program. But student claims
that the program will be in place by
1995 may still be premature. The
road to the creation of a new aca
demic program requires planning,
money and ultimately, faculty sup
port. None of those tasks is easy.
Former Dean of Student Affairs
Jim Lyons called Casper and Rice's
statement on Chicano Studies "a sig
nificant thing," but warned against
student overconfidence. "Over the
long haul, it's clearly in the hands of
the faculty. There was a limit to
what [the administration] could do."
Compared to strikes at other

campuses in recent months over
many of the same issues, last
week's Quad protest fell short. At
UC-Santa Barbara two weeks ago
and UCLA last year, strikes lasted
more than nine days. In both those
instances, university administra
tors made enormous concessions: at
UCLA, Chancellor Charles Young
agreed to protesters' demands for a
Chicano Studies department and
the hiring of four new faculty mem
bers within the next year. At UCSB
last week, administrators agreed to
hire 14 new Chicano faculty and to
establish a community center in
neighboring Isla Vista.
Some maintain that the conces
sions made by the Stanford adminis
tration were minimal enough that
they could have been achieved —
albeit more slowly — without the
strike. "I think there is definitely the
possibility these issues would have
been pursued (without the protest),"
said one prominent student leader.
"But how long it would have taken is
definitely up in the air."
Rather than simply aiming for
specific demands, last week's

protest was also a manifestation of
much deeper frustrations. It has
been a trying year for the Chicano
community — marked by the firing
of Burciaga, the rejection of
MEChA's special-fee request in the
ASSU election, and finally, racist
remarks at a Flicks screening of "No
Grapes" less than two weeks ago. In
last week's strike, students may
simply have wanted to be heard.
"It is quite possible, that when
something like a fast happens, the
message may be symptomatic of
more complex issues, such as 'we
don't feel good here,' " Lyons said.
"It's a climate issue — and it has to
do with a lack of respect, a lack of
support, a lack of institutional
acceptance."
Did the strike make progress in
assuaging those feelings? Both the
administration and the protesters
said the strike brought the Chicano
community one important thing —
respect. But as Saturday's signing
dispute showed, not all wounds
have healed. While Casper's open
ness to negotiations may have reha
bilitated his image in the Chicano

community, Rice's hard-line
approach won her few friends. Even
with protesters cheering "The vic
tory is ours!" Friday night, one
prominent Chicana activist, senior
Nicole Sanchez, said she was still
"upset at the administrative pro
cess — how unfeeling the adminis
tration has been throughout."
Whether Chicano students
gained more support through the
strike is also debatable. The high
ranking student leader said that the
strike may have suffered from, sim
ply, a lack of student interest. "I
don't think they had wide support
from the student body," he said.
"These issues don't resonate with
the general campus community."
The ledger of the hunger strike
remains largely incomplete. While
both sides can rightfully claim vic
tory on some fronts, it remains to
be seen if last week's triumphs, in
time, prove Pyhrric.
"Unfortunately, it is often the
case that such agreements appear
to satisfy nobody," Kennedy said.
"But that's the essential nature of a
compromise."

planned. While a dreary rain fell, University
President Gerhard Casper and Provost

Condoleezza Rice squirmed uncomfortably
in their seats as the crowd of onlookers
chanted "Uvas, no! Chicano Studies, si!"
with increasing fervor. Then, in a scene that
recalled a similar meeting between Israel
and the Palestine Liberation Organization
last week, Casper refused to sign the written
agreement. For a moment, an ugly con
frontation seemed imminent; but Casper
and Rice, perhaps sensing disaster, relented.
The brief, tense ceremony was at once
extraordinaiy and fitting. While both sides
maintain their satisfaction with the agree
ment reached Friday night, the problems
the protest sought to solve — both tangible
and abstract — may still remain.
"This is a very good foundation," Casper
said after Saturday's ceremony. But the ad

ministration's reluctance to offer anything
beyond what it did — three committees that
will look into the prospects for a Chicano
Studies program, a ban on table grapes and
a community center in East Palo Alto —
demonstrates that expediency, rather than
foresight, was its utmost priority.
"I think from the administration's point
of view, they wanted this over fairly quick
ly," said graduate student Derek Miyahara,
resident fellow at Okada. "I think that the
settlement was one to get this thing to end."
From the start, Casper sought to defuse
the crisis by meeting with Chicano student
leaders on the first day of the strike and of
fering a response to their demands that
evening.
Casper's quick handling of the
strike and conciliatory style drew
praise yesterday from several
observers, including his predeces
sor, Donald Kennedy. "I know how
trying these things are," Kennedy
said. "The president and provost
made an enormous personal
involvement, and we should all
appreciate it."
And Political Science Prof.
Stephen Krasner said the strike
"came to a prudent conclusion."
Yet despite Casper's success in
bringing it to a close, the strike con
stituted the first sustained student
protest against his administration.
It is perhaps inevitable that the
strike will be examined by the pub
lic as a measure of his strength.
Kennedy, whose administration
gained publicity after 55 students
were arrested for occupying his
office in 1989, said that "the way

the administration is perceived out
side depends on how the media
choose to cover them — what kind
of spin is put on it. ... I don't know
what the coverage will be here."
So far, reviews have been mixed.
The Associated Press wrote that
Casper had conceded, "agreeing to
ask for reports on three issues
raised by the protesters." The pres
ident's news release, on the other
hand, claimed that it was instead
the protesters who ended the strike
after "accepting a statement by the
president and provost."
Indeed, exactly who conceded to
whom remains hard to discern.
After the president's statement was
announced late Friday night, strike
supporters put up posters claiming
that the president had bowed to the
protest's demands. But the agree
ment itself falls quite a ways short
of tangible concessions from the
administration.
"I would say they haven't gotten
anything in terms of some concrete
change in University policy," Krasner
said. "They have got a commitment
to look seriously at these issues."

In pure substance, Friday's
agreement differed little from the
original proposal offered by Casper
Wednesday evening: three commit
tees and a refusal to reconsider the
firing of Cecilia Burciaga, the Chi
cana administrator whose position
will be eliminated in August.
The administration's allowance
that it will "entertain" a proposal
for a Chicano Studies program next
fall seems the biggest break
through, and could well pave the
way to the ultimate establishment
of the program. But student claims
that the program will be in place by
1995 may still be premature. The
road to the creation of a new aca
demic program requires planning,
money and ultimately, faculty sup
port. None of those tasks is easy.
Former Dean of Student Affairs
Jim Lyons called Casper and Rice's
statement on Chicano Studies "a sig
nificant thing," but warned against
student overconfidence. "Over the
long haul, it's clearly in the hands of
the faculty. There was a limit to
what [the administration] could do."
Compared to strikes at other

campuses in recent months over
many of the same issues, last
week's Quad protest fell short. At
UC-Santa Barbara two weeks ago
and UCLA last year, strikes lasted
more than nine days. In both those
instances, university administra
tors made enormous concessions: at
UCLA, Chancellor Charles Young
agreed to protesters' demands for a
Chicano Studies department and
the hiring of four new faculty mem
bers within the next year. At UCSB
last week, administrators agreed to
hire 14 new Chicano faculty and to
establish a community center in
neighboring Isla Vista.
Some maintain that the conces
sions made by the Stanford adminis
tration were minimal enough that
they could have been achieved —
albeit more slowly — without the
strike. "I think there is definitely the
possibility these issues would have
been pursued (without the protest),"
said one prominent student leader.
"But how long it would have taken is
definitely up in the air."
Rather than simply aiming for
specific demands, last week's

protest was also a manifestation of
much deeper frustrations. It has
been a trying year for the Chicano
community — marked by the firing
of Burciaga, the rejection of
MEChA's special-fee request in the
ASSU election, and finally, racist
remarks at a Flicks screening of "No
Grapes" less than two weeks ago. In
last week's strike, students may
simply have wanted to be heard.
"It is quite possible, that when
something like a fast happens, the
message may be symptomatic of
more complex issues, such as 'we
don't feel good here,' " Lyons said.
"It's a climate issue — and it has to
do with a lack of respect, a lack of
support, a lack of institutional
acceptance."
Did the strike make progress in
assuaging those feelings? Both the
administration and the protesters
said the strike brought the Chicano
community one important thing —
respect. But as Saturday's signing
dispute showed, not all wounds
have healed. While Casper's open
ness to negotiations may have reha
bilitated his image in the Chicano

community, Rice's hard-line
approach won her few friends. Even
with protesters cheering "The vic
tory is ours!" Friday night, one
prominent Chicana activist, senior
Nicole Sanchez, said she was still
"upset at the administrative pro
cess — how unfeeling the adminis
tration has been throughout."
Whether Chicano students
gained more support through the
strike is also debatable. The high
ranking student leader said that the
strike may have suffered from, sim
ply, a lack of student interest. "I
don't think they had wide support
from the student body," he said.
"These issues don't resonate with
the general campus community."
The ledger of the hunger strike
remains largely incomplete. While
both sides can rightfully claim vic
tory on some fronts, it remains to
be seen if last week's triumphs, in
time, prove Pyhrric.
"Unfortunately, it is often the
case that such agreements appear
to satisfy nobody," Kennedy said.
"But that's the essential nature of a
compromise."
Saturday morning's press conference by
Chicano students and the administration
officially ending a three-day hunger strike
was supposed to be the easy part. Both sides
had spent most of the previous evening

pounding out the sub
stance of an agreement to
end the demonstration. On
Saturday, they were to
shake hands, read concilia-

toiy statements and resolve to move for
ward.
