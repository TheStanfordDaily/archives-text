## Graduate Women's Network assigned new coordinator 
### Beth Berselli Staff writer 
For the first time since the late '80s, the Graduate
Women's Network will have a part-time coordinator
who is paid for her efforts.
The position will be funded for the year by the
School of Education, the School of Humanities and
Sciences and the Office of the Dean of Graduate Re
search. According to doctoral candidate Renee Ro
mano, the network's current volunteer coordinator,
each school will assume the coordinator expense for
one quarter.
"I was a little surprised, but very pleased that we
received the funding. The administrators were very
nice and really went out of their way to make this
happen," Romano said.
The Graduate Women's Network — which was
founded in the early 1980s — is an organization run
by and for graduate women to promote a sense of
community between women of different depart
ments. "One of its main functions is to support
women while they are in graduate school," Romano
said.
The network submitted a proposal to the Office of
the Dean of Graduate Research for the position dur
ing winter quarter. The proposal — which outlined
reasons why the position should be funded — was ap
proved in late April, Romano said.
"Renee came to us and made a very persuasive
case about how a little bit of help from us could do a
lot for the lives of many women," said Roni Holeton,
associate director of graduate studies in the School of
Humanities and Sciences.
"We weren't thinking about budget cuts at all,"
Holeton said. "We were looking at if there was a way
we could combine resources from several offices to
help the group out. It turned out
that we were able to."
The position was approved for
the 1994-95 academic year only,
and will need to be renewed in
future years, Holeton added.
The network primarily serves
students in the School of Educa
tion and the School of Humanities
and Sciences. The other graduate

schools — law, business, engineer
ing and medicine — have their
own groups for female students.
"The funding of this position is
a very efficient way for the Univer
sity to provide services to a com
munity that hasn't been receiving
those services otherwise," Romano
said. "It's going to create a place
where people can go with issues,
problems and questions."
The network's original paid
coordinator position was abol
ished in 1989 with the first round
of budget cuts, Romano said. The
position then was a "research

assistantship" — the person was
awarded tuition credits and also
received a stipend.
The coordinator — who will
work eight hours a week for $16
an hour — will be responsible for
overseeing production of the net
work's quarterly newsletter and
the planning of all events. She will
serve as an "information convey
or," Romano said, adding that her
job will be "very organizational,
but she will still have a lot of free
dom to establish programs."
"With a funded coordinator we
can do things more systematical

ly," Romano said. "By creating
this paid position it will be easier
to run existing events, as well as to
create new ones."
The network is currently look
ing for "an administrative space"
for next year, Romano said, adding
that the group is working with the
Program in Feminist Studies to
find housing for the group.
The network will begin accept
ing applications for the position
within the next few weeks. A com
mittee will then interview candi
dates. "We hope to have someone
hired by June," Romano said.
