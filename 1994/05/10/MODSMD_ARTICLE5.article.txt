# CUE suggests changes to academic calendar
## Rejects plans for more sweeping alterations 
### Linda Friedlieb Editorial staff 
After discussing such broad strokes of
change as switching to semesters and creat
ing a three-year plan, the Commission on Un-

dergraduate Education de
cided to recommend small
er variations in the Univer
sity's academic policies.
In a meeting focused
mostly on changes to the
academic calendar, the
commission proposed
maintaining two Dead
Days each quarter, start
ing the academic year early

enough to allow for three-week winter
breaks and denying academic credit for "ac
tivities courses."
In addition, the commission looked at
ways to encourage uniformity in the value of
an academic unit.
History Prof. James Sheehan, the com
mission's chair, said the group chose not to
recommend the switch to semesters because
"although many on the commission, myself
included, think the semester system would

be better, we don't think a change could be
made."
Sheehan explained that large costs in
time and money would be associated with
such a fundamental change in the academic
calendar. For example, every course would
need to be restructured to fit into a semester
rather than a quarter.
Vice Provost for Institutional Planning
Geoffrey Cox, chair of the commission's aca
demic calendar subcommittee, said the is
sues did not "seem terribly controversial."
"There was not a strong impetus to
change, despite a lot of sentiment for semes
ters on the part of faculty," he said.
The commission has not yet decided what
to recommend about the three-year plan, ac
cording to Cox. "Probably the commission
will have to return to that at the very end,"
he said. "We will look at what [the commis
sion] wants our students to accomplish and
then create a time frame to match that."
Cox pointed out that the examination of a
three-year plan was part of the commis
sion's original charter.
Junior Luz Herrera, the lone undergrad-


Cox
uate on the commission, said,
"Everybody realized it was impor
tant to have the four-year experi
ence, but they realized there will be
other considerations, financial con
siderations."
Herrera said she was "con
cerned about what students would
be missing in those three years."
"If people are going to do it, they
can do it right now," she said. "I'm
afraid their parents won't see what's
important outside of studying."
Sheehan added that the com
mission spent a lot of time going
through smaller issues.
For example, it decided to rec
ommend that "activity courses" —
such as being a Dollie or playing a
varsity sport — no longer receive
academic credit.
In addition, Sheehan said the
commission decided to recommend
that all courses taken for a letter
grade have some sort of product
which can be evaluated.
The commission was also con
cerned about the number of units
in courses, which "often do not
reflect the same amount of work,"
Sheehan said.
Cox said remedies to the prob
lem of defming units include hav
ing the registrar examine courses
that appear to be irregular in their
unit assignment and paying close
attention to student evaluations of
courses.
Sheehan said the commission
also looked at ways to increase the
academic value of the summer
quarter. For example, professors
could be encouraged to stay on
campus and teach, or tuition could
be reduced, he said.
