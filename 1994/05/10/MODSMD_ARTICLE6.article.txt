# Casper approached about Asian-American studies
## 
### Kevin Wack Staff writer 
A group of Asian-American students de
clared their support last week for the de
mands of the striking Chicano student com
munity — and used the opportunity to voice
its own concerns over the University's lack
of an Asian-American Studies program.
The students — calling themselves "Con
cerned Students for Asian-American stud
ies" — sent a letter to University President
Gerhard Casper and Provost Condoleezza
Rice last Friday listing their demands.
Karen Ho, a graduate student in education,
said that the letter's purpose was "to keep
the pressure on the administration" regard
ing Asian-American studies.
Later in the day, the administration an
nounced as part of its agreement with Chi
cano students that "the School of Humani
ties and Sciences will examine the requests
that have been pending concerning Asian-
American Studies."
Ho said she believed that the administra
tion's comment was a result of the letter.

Still, some of the students expressed con
cern that the promise was an empty one.
"We would like them to show much more
commitment because they've been consider
ing way too long," said graduate student
Stephen Chen.
Ho added that she was skeptical of the
statement's importance. "You can set up com
mittees without anything being implement
ed, " she said. "It's not even to the level of com
mittee. I think [the statement's purpose] was
just to put [Asian-American Studies] on the
list, but making no commitment to it."
John Shoven, dean of the School of Hu
manities and Sciences, said a meeting has
been scheduled for May 27 to deal with
Asian-American studies. "It will be a repre
sentative group of people interested in that
topic," he said.
In addition, Shoven hopes to form a com
mittee to study the issue that should come out
with a report by the end of fall quarter 1994.
"That committee will be similar in charge
to the one studying Chicano Studies," he
said. "It'll be a different commit
tee, but in some ways with a par
allel course."
In addition to urging the
administration to fulfill the
demands of the striking Chicano
students demands and to create a
committee to formulate and imple
ment an Asian-American studies
curriculum, the group also
demanded that the University take

all measures necessary to retain
Asian-American Studies Profs.
Gordon Chang and David Palum
bo-Liu, both of whom are consider
ing offers at other universities.
Students also requested that
the administration hire at least
two new tenure-track faculty to
teach Asian-American studies
within the next two years.
In their letter, the students
demanded a response by May 11.
Concerned the concessions already
received are not enough, Ho said
she is not optimistic that adminis
tration will respond by then.
