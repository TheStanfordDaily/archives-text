# 'Know that your hunger has fed this community for at least the coming decade'
## Students rally in celebration of strike's end 
### Sarah Katz Editorial staff 
With cheers, prayer and a little bit of humor, Chi
cano students celebrated their settlement with the
University at a rally yesterday and emphasized the im
portance of continuing vigilance even though their
hunger strike is over.
"It's very important that you understand this is
only the beginning of our struggle," said sophomore
Elvira Prieto, one of the fasters. "We have to keep
pushing the administration mid make them account
able. Ix* them know we're here and we're going to be
around for a while."
The mood at the rally — which drew about 100 stu
dents and several television cameras around the mi
crophones placed in front of El Centro Chicano — was
enthusiastic. Members of the Chicano student group,
MEChA, served a full lunch, sparking a few jokes.
"We want to start by having the four fasters come
up ... stop eating, Eva," said sophomore Nancy Salas
to senior Eva Silva, one of the fasters.
Friday night, the hunger strikers reached an
agreement with University President Gerhard Casper
and Provost Condoleezza Rice which concluded three
days of fasting and protest.
While the settlement did not fully meet any of the
protesters' demands, it established committees to look
at the possibility of a Chicano Studies program, exam
ine a possible ban on grapes and help students raise
funds for a community center in East Palo Alto.

In addition, administrators agreed to consider pro
posals for a program in Asian-American Studies, rec
ognized the importance of laid-off Chicana adminis
trator Cecilia Burciaga and promised to formulate a
University response to an incident at the May 1 Klicks
where students shouted and laughed during a showing
of "No Grapes."

Addressing the gathering in Spanish, Hilda Alvara
do — whose daughter Tamara, a junior, was one of the
fasters — told of the pride and amazing community
support she had felt for the four Chicanas who had
pledged not to eat until their demands were met.

Eva Silva, one of the four students who fasted in last week's hunger strike, speaks at a rally held in front
of El Centro Chicano yesterday.
"iVo estamos solos (We are not
alone)," she told the group shortly
before leading them in a prayer of
thanks.
Chicano activist Luis Valdez
spoke of the strike as part of a his
tory of community involvement
extending back to recently deceased
activist Cesar Chavez.
"It is encouraging, nurturing,
empowering to see young people
picking up the standard of the
movement," he said.

Valdez also told protesters that
they must not back down now,
despite what many perceive as a vic
tory. "It is essential that students
realize that you must be eternally
vigilant," he said. "Never underes
timate the power of ignorance and
bigotry and racism in our society."
Near the end of the rally, the
audience was clearly moved as Bur
ciaga stepped up to the microphone.
"Few will ever be as lucky, as fortu
nate as [husband! Tony and I. We
will always remember what you
gave us," she said.
The University's highest-rank
ing Chicana administrator, Burcia
ga will leave her position as an asso

ciate dean in the Office of Student
Affairs and as a resident fellow in
Casa Zapata Aug. 1. Her firing has
galvanized the community to action
over the last few months.
"Know that your hunger has fed
this community for at least the
coming decade. Your passion will
stand as a living monument," she
said. "We hope to come back to cel
ebrations but we never want to go
back to any kind of hunger strike,
any pain this community endures."
As a final action, Chicano stu
dents passed the torch of their
struggle to representatives of the
Asian-American community, who
last week sent a letter to Casper and

Rice voicing support for MEChA's
demands and demanding conces
sions of their own.
Asian-American community
members said they believe Friday's
settlement — which states that
"the School of Humanities and Sci
ences also will examine the requests
that have been pending concerning
Asian-American studies" — came
partly out of that letter. But they
too recognized the need for continu
ing vigilance.
"We are here in solidarity, to see
that the administration stays
accountable," said junior Lisa Lee,
an AASA co-chair and member of
the new Council of Presidents.
