# 'Know that your hunger has fed this community for at least the coming decade'
## Students rally in celebration of strike's end 
### Sarah Katz Editorial staff 
With cheers, prayer and a little bit of humor, Chi
cano students celebrated their settlement with the
University at a rally yesterday and emphasized the im
portance of continuing vigilance even though their
hunger strike is over.
"It's very important that you understand this is
only the beginning of our struggle," said sophomore
Elvira Prieto, one of the fasters. "We have to keep
pushing the administration mid make them account
able. Ix* them know we're here and we're going to be
around for a while."
The mood at the rally — which drew about 100 stu
dents and several television cameras around the mi
crophones placed in front of El Centro Chicano — was
enthusiastic. Members of the Chicano student group,
MEChA, served a full lunch, sparking a few jokes.
"We want to start by having the four fasters come
up ... stop eating, Eva," said sophomore Nancy Salas
to senior Eva Silva, one of the fasters.
Friday night, the hunger strikers reached an
agreement with University President Gerhard Casper
and Provost Condoleezza Rice which concluded three
days of fasting and protest.
While the settlement did not fully meet any of the
protesters' demands, it established committees to look
at the possibility of a Chicano Studies program, exam
ine a possible ban on grapes and help students raise
funds for a community center in East Palo Alto.

In addition, administrators agreed to consider pro
posals for a program in Asian-American Studies, rec
ognized the importance of laid-off Chicana adminis
trator Cecilia Burciaga and promised to formulate a
University response to an incident at the May 1 Klicks
where students shouted and laughed during a showing
of "No Grapes."

Addressing the gathering in Spanish, Hilda Alvara
do — whose daughter Tamara, a junior, was one of the
fasters — told of the pride and amazing community
support she had felt for the four Chicanas who had
pledged not to eat until their demands were met.
