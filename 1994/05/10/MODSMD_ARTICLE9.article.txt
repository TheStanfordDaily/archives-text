Rwanda's capital could fall
NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) â€” A rebel offen
sive for control of Rwanda's capital gained
more ground yesterday behind a punish
ing barrage of rockets, heavy art illery and
mortar fire.
A U.N. official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said it appeared Kigali could
be on the verge of falling to the insurgents
after a month of bloodshed in Rwanda
between majority Hutus and minority
Tutsis.
Heavy artillery fired by the mainly
Tutsi rebels blasted troops of the Hutu-led
government near the airport and on the
eastern edge of the city, U.N. officials
reported. Intense small arms fire indicated
the rebels followed the barrages with
infantry assaults.
One mortar round exploded inside
Kanombe camp, causing an undermined

number of casualties at the base.
U.S. military prepares aide
WASHINGTON (AP) - The U.S. mili
tary, forced to deal three years ago with
huge numbers of Haitian refugees, hopes to
avoid a repeat under President Clinton's
latest policy but stands ready to help, offi
cials said yesterday.
About a half-dozen U.S. Navy ships are
located around Haiti to ensure that U.N.
sanctions are being upheld, but no other
military craft are being sent in, a military
spokesman said.
"We are ready to do whatever is required
of us," said Capt. JefTZakem, a spokesman
for the U.S. Atlantic Command.
Some attempt was made to process the
Haitians on board, but the ships were over
whelmed and the refugees were instead
taken to Guantanamo.
