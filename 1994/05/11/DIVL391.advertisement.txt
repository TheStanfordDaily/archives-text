These women
started
a revolution.
The year was 1895. A group of women saw a need
for insurance coverage that benefited certificate
holders in more ways than ordinary insurance. They
also felt a need for community service. So they
founded ROYAL NEIGHBORS OF AMERICA Fraternal
Life Insurance Society to serve both needs. In
addition to offering lifelong insurance security, they
designed their insurance society as a nonprofit
organization to serve community needs and create
unique benefits for their members.
