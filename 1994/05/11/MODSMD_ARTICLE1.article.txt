# Harvard, Pennsylvania also concerned about excess of A's
## Universities grapple with grade inflation 
### Vivien Wang Staff writer 
While the Stanford faculty's
for tighter transcript policies to
combat reported grade inflation
has sparked campus controver
sy, many of Stanford's rivals
across the nation are concerned
with similar issues.
Harvard University's Associ
ate Registrar Thurston Smith
said that grade inflation "really
is universal. I don't know of any
college that does not face it." He
also noted that at Harvard, "the
faculty is more concerned about
it than students. If {grade infla
tion] were going down, then stu
dents would be concerned."
An article in an edition of
Harvard Magazine last year re
ported that at Harvard, 43 per
cent of all grades were A's, twice
as many as in the late '60s. In

addition, the average grade in
Harvard courses had risen from
between a Band B- in 1966-67
to about aß+ today.
By comparison, the Stanford
report issued two weeks ago by
the Faculty Senate Committee
on Academic Appraisal and
Achievement found that 51 per
cent of student grades in 1992-
93 were A's, and the median
grade for all undergraduate
courses is an A-.
Those findings and a general
sentiment of faculty support
provided the impetus for the
committee's proposed changes
to the grading policy, including
reinstatement of a failing "NP"
grade, recording of student
withdrawal from courses, earli
er add/drop deadlines and
stricter retake rules.
In a May 3 article focusing on
the grading debate at Stanford
and other schools, the Chicago
Tribune reported that A's
account for 40 percent of grades
given at Princeton University.
Meanwhile, some schools are
addressing the problem of notice
able differences in grading across
different disciplines.
At the University of Pennsyl

vania, concern about grade infla
tion is largely confined to the
humanities. The Jan. 24th edi
tion of The Daily Pennsylvanian
reported that student expecta
tions of higher grades in the
humanities rather than the sci
ences "is turning more students
toward the humanities."
Matthew Santircxo, dean of
Penn's College of Arts and Sci
ences, found enrollment in the
sciences "surprisingly low," the
article said, possibly because the
bottom line for many undergrad
uates who plan to attend gradu

ate or professional schools is
grade point average.
The Daily Pennsylvanian also
reported that grading "has
become a taboo subject among
humanities professors."
But at Northwestern Universi
ty, grade distributions between
students in the School of Arts and
Sciences and the School of Engi
neering for the fall quarter
demonstrated little disparity.
Both schools gave 38 percent of
students grades in the A range.
Thirty-nine percent of North
western engineering students

received grades in the B range
while 44 percent in arts and sci
ences received B grades.
At UC-Berkeley, grade distribu
tion Ls differentiated between lower
division classes — taken mostly by
freshmen and sophomores —
and upper division classes.
According to Director of Insti
tutional Research Bob Cox, the
last five years at Berkeley have
seen an "upward trend [in grade
inflation], although this is noth
ing compared to the up trend of
20 years ago."
Cox says that currently, the

"trend may have hit a plateau."
He refers to this as grade com
pression, rather than grade infla
tion, because the "problem is not
that grades get higher. Every
body is stuck together near the
top, but you can't tell the differ
ence. It's a self-limiting phe
nomenon. Grades can only get so
high."
At Berkeley, students in lower
division courses tend to get lower
grades. During the fall term, in
lower division classes, 30.5 percent
of students received A's and 29.5
percent received B's. In upper divi

sion classes, the numbers were
three to four percent higher.
David Yeh, University Regis
trar and Asst. Vice-President for
Academic Programs at Cornell
University, said that at his uni
versity, there were no "dramatic
changes in terms of individual
schools having inflation. Engi
neering may claim that they're
the toughest school, and that arts
and sciences are not so rigorous,
but I'm not so sure that's the
case." Yeh said that the policies of
each school are "equally tough
and stringent."
