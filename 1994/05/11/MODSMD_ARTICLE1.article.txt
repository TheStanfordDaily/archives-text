# Harvard, Pennsylvania also concerned about excess of A's
## Universities grapple with grade inflation 
### Vivien Wang Staff writer 
While the Stanford faculty's
for tighter transcript policies to
combat reported grade inflation
has sparked campus controver
sy, many of Stanford's rivals
across the nation are concerned
with similar issues.
Harvard University's Associ
ate Registrar Thurston Smith
said that grade inflation "really
is universal. I don't know of any
college that does not face it." He
also noted that at Harvard, "the
faculty is more concerned about
it than students. If {grade infla
tion] were going down, then stu
dents would be concerned."
An article in an edition of
Harvard Magazine last year re
ported that at Harvard, 43 per
cent of all grades were A's, twice
as many as in the late '60s. In

addition, the average grade in
Harvard courses had risen from
between a Band B- in 1966-67
to about a√ü+ today.
By comparison, the Stanford
report issued two weeks ago by
the Faculty Senate Committee
on Academic Appraisal and
Achievement found that 51 per
cent of student grades in 1992-
93 were A's, and the median
grade for all undergraduate
courses is an A-.
Those findings and a general
sentiment of faculty support
provided the impetus for the
committee's proposed changes
to the grading policy, including
reinstatement of a failing "NP"
grade, recording of student
withdrawal from courses, earli
er add/drop deadlines and
stricter retake rules.
