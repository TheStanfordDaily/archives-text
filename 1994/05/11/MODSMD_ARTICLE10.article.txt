YEHUD, Israel (AP) — Police attacked
an armed stronghold in suburban Tel Aviv
yesterday, killing one man and arresting a
charismatic sect leader and about 50 follow
ers.
As evening fell, hundreds of police sur
rounded the compound, where an unknown
number of armed sect members were inside.
Rabbi Uzi Meshulam and his followers
had been holed up in the one-acre compound
since a failed police raid six weeks ago.
Guards with assault rifles manned observa
tion points atop a two-story stucco house,
and oil barrels and sandbag fortifications
surrounded the area.
Meshulam's supporters, Jews of
Yemenite origin, accuse authorities of kid
napping hundreds of newborns in the 1950s
and giving them to Jewish families of Euro
pean origin. They demand an official
inquiry.
Police Commissioner Assaf Hefetz said
after Meshulam's arrest his men were then
attacked with "dozens of bullets" and had no
choice but to fire back, killing one gunman.
