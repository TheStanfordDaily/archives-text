# Mandela inaugurated as president
## Historic day draws leaders from all over the world to South Africa 
### 
PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) -
The day that millions dreamed of and
thousands died for finally arrived yes
terday when Nelson Mandela recited the
oath of office to become South Africa's
First black president.
With the words, "Never, never and
never again," the man imprisoned for 27
years under apartheid banished the sys
tem of racial oppression he fought all his
life and pledged a better future for all his
compatriots — black and white — in "a
rainbow nation at peace with itself and the
world."
The nation and a host of foreign visi
tors witnessed his swearing-in ceremony
in an atmosphere of near-euphoria, able to
forget at least for a day the social divisions
and economic inequities that Mandela
must confront.
The beginning of his administration
coincided with what many South Africans
deemed the birth of their new nation. "The
Second South African Republic," was how
one television commentator put it.
Watched by visitors including Vice
President A 1 Gore, Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat and Cuban President Fidel

Castro, Mandela spoke in deep, measured
tones as he swore allegiance to the new
republic and its constitution.
As he said, "So help me God," at 12:17
p.m., shouts of "Viva" rang out and a joy
ous roar rose from the throngs spread out
on the lawns and terraces below.
Black policeman Percy Morokane, 25,
brought his 2-month-old son, Kgotso, to
the inauguration.
"I feel very good because I'm free at
last," he said. "My kid here will have
opportunities that we never had." His
wife, Sandy, added: "He's going to be the
next president."
From a gala inaugural lunch to fire
works on the Durban beach to street par
ties in black townships, people joined in
festivities celebrating the new govern
ment. In Sebokeng, a township south of
Johannesburg, two people died and at
least 14 were injured when a crowd threw
stones at a car, causing it to careen into a
group of celebrants, police said.
Mandela was elected president Monday
in Cape Town by the first South African
parliament to include members of the
black majority.

From that triumph on the shores
where Dutch merchants first landed 352
years ago, Mandela flew to Pretoria to be
inaugurated. He formally assumed power
in this former bastion of white
supremacists and Afrikaner nationalists
who until 1989 ruthlessly enforced a sys
tem of apartheid — strict racial separation
— that treated 30 million blacks as inter
lopers in their own land.
An old resistance song declared, "We
are going to Pretoria." But when the mass
es arrived yesterday it was not a bloody
revolution but a peaceful transfer of power
engineered by Mandela and outgoing Pres
ident F.W. de Klerk during four years of
negotiation. The negotiations began in
1990, shortly afler de Klerk freed Man
dela, who had spent 27 years in prison.
Deputy Presidents de Klerk and Thabo
Mbeki, an African National Congress stal
wart considered Mandela's heir apparent,
took their oaths of office just before Man
dela.
A multiracial crowd of 50,000 people
gathered at the foot of the Union Build
ings to witness the inauguration on a
giant television screen.
