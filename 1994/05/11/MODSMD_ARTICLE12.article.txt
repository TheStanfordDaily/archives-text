## Editorials Deflating inflation 
### 
IN ITS MAY 2 meeting, the Com
mission on Undergraduate Edu
cation agreed to call for a new
committee to consider the problem
of grade inflation. The issue of grade
inflation at Stanford, where 93 per
cent of the grades received are A's
and B's, was recently the subject of
an article in the Chicago Tribune.
Many believe that the rampant
grade inflation at Stanford does not
mean Stanford students are doing
their homework and studying for
their tests, but that grades have
ceased to be an accurate reflection of
achievement. The University should
act on the commission's recommen
dation to form such a committee to
address this problem.
Despite the consensus that some
thing must be done, the committee
should first tackle several difficult
questions: Just how many A's and
B's, for instance, should the Univer
sity award? Should the University
set a mean for all classes on cam
pus? Should a class median grade be
printed alongside one's grade?

The committee to study the grade
inflation problem should make sure
to include a great deal of student
opinion in its recommendations.
Unfortunately, judging from the
recent grade change proposal rec
ommended by the Committee on
Academic Appraisal and Achieve
ment, the precedent seems to indi
cate otherwise. The fact is that
many students and student leaders
were surprised by the sweeping
nature of the changes recommended
by the C-AAA.
Although two dorm meetings
have been held this week to solicit
student opinion on the grade change
proposal, students should have had
more say before it was presented to
the Faculty Senate.
If a committee is formed to study
grade inflation, it must be sure to
incorporate adequate student opin
ion with that from other areas of the
University. Because grade inflation
is a problem which affects both stu
dents and professors, it is important
to get all sides of the issue.
