# Bring on the lights
## 
### 
After six decades of
sunny home games, the
Stanford baseball team may
be batting under the stars as early
as next year if a proposal to install
lights at Sunken Diamond is
implemented.
Most of the funding for the set of
eight lights — estimated to cost
around $250,000 — is coming from
former players and the team's,
booster organization, according to
the Department of Athletics. Stan
ford should move quickly to take
advantage of the opportunity —
and the University should be will
ing to chip in some of its own
money if more support is needed.
The advantages to the communi
ty and the team are clear. With
lights, the Athletics Department
will be able to schedule several
Tuesday and Friday night games,
which should improve attendance
by allowing students and other fans

to come to games after school and
work.
The high temperatures that
plague the Bay Area in late spring
also make more games in the
evening desirable.
Just as important, however, is
how lights would change Stan
ford's standing in college athletics.
According to: Associ Athletic Direc
tor Torn-jfegkett.jthp NCAA prefers
to play regional playoff games at
facilities with the capacity for night
baseball. Lights should give Stan
ford much more flexibility — and
will hopefully bring more postsea
son action to Sunken Diamond.
With this change and others —
including a new scoreboard for next
season — Sunken Diamond should
be a great place to spend a Friday
night next spring quarter.
Any addition to Stanford
nightlife, after all, should be wel
comed.
