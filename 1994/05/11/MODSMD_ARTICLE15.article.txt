## Can Mickey Mouse be mean?

EVEN FOR US grown-up college
students, the myth of Walt Disney
is a pervasive part of our lives, the
incarnation of childhood glee, of happy,
naive fantasies. The Disney Corporation
knows that, just as well as it knows the
unmistakable appeal of little Mickey
Mouses on their job recruitment adver
tisements.
I hardly have been immune. Between
the ages of seven and 17, I averaged at
least one trip to Disneyland every two
years, even though the southern Califor
nia theme park/fantasyland was at least a
good 300 miles from my Bay Area home.
Every time I drove past the rows of
cheap, rundown motels and entered the
gates of the Magic Kingdom, it was like
finding a more happier part r
of myself. ii i| «t
It's funny what d little journalistic
research can do to disillusion you. As part
of my job last summer, I spent a month
basically tearing down the stronghold
Disneyland had on my childhood.
I learned that many of those cheap,
roach-infested motels were actually
inhabited by lifelong Orange County res
idents, members of the middle class who
have fallen by the wayside along with
Anaheim's economy.
When Disneyland first started off in
Anaheim, a city of 15,000, the city
launched a campaign to cash in on the
city's new centerpiece and draw in new
residents. By 1960, the population was
104,000.

Anaheim became synonymous with
Disneyland. Currently, the stationery of
the city offices have the Sleeping Beauty
Castle logo on them and the Matterhorn
is one of the main landmarks of the city
skyline. Meanwhile, the population has
risen to 266,000.
Defense cuts have hit Anaheim hard,
particularly in the late 1980s. Over
20,000 aerospace jobs and nearly a third
of high-tech sector jobs have been lost
since 1988. Anaheim's suburban-par
adise atmosphere has quickly become a
model of urban decay, the areas sur
rounding Disneyland dominated by low
income housing and motels (which have
become nearly the same thing in many
cases).
Clearly, this is bptberstyne to Disney,
conoefjifd. that the urban
squalor will detract from the theme
park's fantasy-like appeal. No one wants
to walk out of the Magic Kingdom, only
to be approached by panhandlers and
drug dealers.
So what is Disney Development Cor
poration doing about this? Enter the Dis
neyland Resort, a $3 billion expansion
that will include Westcott Center (similar
to Disneyworld's Epcot Center), a resort
complex, shopping mall and two of the
largest parking lots in the world. This
expansion will boost the sagging economy
and provide needed jobs and taxes, Dis
ney claims.
What Disney doesn't openly advertise
is that this very project is going to basi

cally mow over much of the surrounding
low-income housing and motels — a
small detail that will probably not leave
Orange County's homeless count of
12,000 any lower.
And the State of California has chimed
in its support, to the tune of $60 million,
to build two freeway ramps for the resort.
It needs not be said that the state is not
exactly at a loss for places to spend its
money — if only we students all could
qualify for state "financial aid" as easily
as Disney.
Anyway, after discovering all this
in/ormatipn, my Disney bubble was com
»{jletqiy <burgfc. Disneyland, if I ever decide
to venture near it again, will never be the
same. Even the "It's a Small World" boat
ride seems grotesquely sinister now (who
knows where those evil corporate-types
are hiding subliminal messages).
Gone are my days of "Little Mermaid"
posters and Mickey-Mouse parapherna
lia. I feel as if my last illusions that pure
goodness exists have been wiped away —
but I suppose that's all part of growing
up.

Anaheim first appeared in an investiga
