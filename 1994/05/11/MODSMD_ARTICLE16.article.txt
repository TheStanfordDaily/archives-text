## Kwong's letter lacks knowledge, awareness, tolerance 
### 
THIS LETTER IS in response to
Michael Kwong's May 5 letter,
"Reaction to 'No Grapes' was
insensitive, not racist."
Kwong contends that student out
bursts and applause to "Go home bean
ers" and "Yes, Pesticides" during a
short video about the grape boycott
(prior to the showing of "Mrs. Doubt
fire") was not a racist act.
Let me start by saying that there is
a literature on racism, and before one
chooses to address the issue he should
at least be able to define the key
word(s). The educators Pine and
Hilliard ("Rx for Racism: Imperatives
For America's Schools," in Phi Delta
Kappan, 1990) give a very clear defini
tion of racism from which to depart:
"Racism describes the combination
of individual prejudice and discrimina
tion. . . . Prejudice consists of unjustifi
able negative feelings and beliefs about
a racial or ethnic group and its mem
bers. Discrimination consists of unjusti
fiable negative behavior toward a racial
or ethnic group and its members."

No, Michael, the group of 34 stu
dents whose letter appeared in The
Daily May 3 didn't just call it as they
saw it. They called it as it is â€” racism!
Now it is time for us to deal with the
issue on this campus. Usually racism is
manifested on this campus in very sub
tle ways. But when it is blatantly
expressed we refer to it as simply a
case of "insensitivity" (which it also
was).
I hope that we can all agree that
folks at Stanford are adults, however
young. And to my knowledge, Flicks is
not reserved for a particular film genre
or behavior. So, to say that a short on
the grape boycott is inappropriate
doesn't seem to follow logically.
Even if you don't agree with me on
this point, it remains that if the stu
dents at Stanford are so "apathetic"
instead of racist, as Kwong would like
us to believe, they would have simply
kept their mouths shut during the
showing of the short. As adults, they
had a choice. I think that each and
every student at the Flicks is responsi

ble for their display of discrimination
and prejudice, as well as apathy.
Kwong refers to the students as tak
ing up a "worthy cause" with "insuffi
cient support." This was just too much.
He talks about "people (who are) a lot
more concerned with their grades and
applying to law or medical school" and
says "you can't blame them." What
Kwong fails to realize is that these
Stanford students he seems to sympa
thize with are not the same ones who
had been camping out in the Quad. For
the protesters, their "cause" is for
their livelihood, it is who they are, it is
where they came from. They don't
need to be further insulted or patron
ized.
Finally, I want to end on a personal
note about Cecilia Burciaga, the sub
ject of a demand not addressed by Uni
versity President Gerhard Casper and
Provost Condoleezza Rice. I, for one,
owe a great deal of gratitude to this
woman. I am in graduate school
because a friend of mine (she happens
to be white) and I were talking to Bur

ciaga one day in 1987 about a simple
idea we had. Burciaga helped us aca
demically and financially to realize we
had a great idea. You see, students of
all colors should be rallying around
this woman, who has helped far many
more than just myself realize unseen
potential.
To close, this is not a good time for
Stanford. I think that it is time stu
dents, staff, and above all, administra
tors realize students of color are not
going to disappear; nor will their histo
ry of injustices on this campus, or the
anxieties that stem from these. Nor
will their long overdue desire for a
piece of the pie.
The administration gave a delayed
response to Flicks, and many of the stu
dents who did respond based it on their
own unchecked fears. More than ever,
we on this campus must be knowledge
able about the issues we choose to
address. We must be more aware, intro
spective, and above all, just tolerant.
