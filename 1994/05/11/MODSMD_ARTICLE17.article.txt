# Restructuring of Legal Office was necessary, Roster will do good job
## 
### 
This letter is in response to the May
4 Daily article, "Legal Office work to
go off the Farm."
It is not a new phenomenon that
law firms, corporations and profes-

sional associations throughout the
United States have been restructuring
Taking law firms as an example, since
1990 conditions have forced manage
ment to scale back and to find creative
ways to become more efficient.
As a result there have been massive
layoffs of professionals who preferred
to retain the "cradle-to-grave commit
ment," which for years dominated the
philosophy of major law firms and the
legal profession in general. This has

rapidly become a mythological concept.
Businesses must re-position themselves
to be cost-efficient and productive.
I am sure the Stanford alumni
applaud General Counsel Mike Roster
for taking steps to save $1 million and
improve Stanford's legal services. With
his background of 20 years in the prac
tice of law and management, Roster is
highly qualified to overhaul the legal
division.
Roster has served Stanford in many

capacities since his years as an under
graduate, law school student and
Dinkelspiel Award recipient. With his
record of dedication and integrity, the
students, faculty and administration
should be assured that Roster will
make the new, improved legal division
a prototype for other universities fac
ing budget challenges.
