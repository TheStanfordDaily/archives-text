## Common bacterium shown to raise stomach cancer risk Research may be applicable to other similar diseases 
### Julie Sauer Staff writer 
Researchers at the School of
Medicine have discovered what
they believe to be a link between
the incidence of infection with a
common bacterium and the
occurrence of rare form of stom
ach cancer.
Julie Parsonnet, an assistant
professor at the Medical School,
is part of a research team that
studied the Helicobacter pylori
bacterium and its association
with gastric non-Hodgkin's lym
phoma — a type of stomach can
cer.
The bacteria are very com
mon, infecting approximately
half of the world's population
and, according to the new
research, may cause cancer in
the cells that make up the lining
of the stomach.
The link between gastric can
cer and the bacteria, uncovered
in Parsonnet's recent study, will
likely add to scientists' current
knowledge about the role of
infectious agents in causing dis
eases.
"One third of the cancers in
the world are caused by infec
tion," Parsonnet said, adding
that other inflammatory disease
processes are also caused by
infection.
However, in order to conclu

sively prove a causal relationship
between the bacterial infection
and gastric non-Hodgkin's lym
phoma, researchers would need
to treat a group of infected
patients.
This group could then be com
pared with a control group com
posed of non-treated, infected
patients. If the bacteria were
indeed responsible for stomach
cancer, the incidence of the dis
ease in the treated group should
fall because they would no longer
be infected.
Such a study would take many
years. As a result, the relation
between the bacteria and cancer
has not been proven. However,
according to Parsonnet, the
research at the Medical School
has shown "a strong association"
between the bacteria and the
cancer.
She explained that many dis
eases result from infection by dif
ferent organisms. For example,
Hepatitis is caused by a virus,
and bladder cancer occurs
because of the presence of the
bladder worm. Though both of
these infections are peripheral to
the disease itself, they play an
important role in allowing dis
eases such as cancer to take hold.
Parsonnet explained that in
the U.S. infections are less of a
problem than throughout the
rest of the world due to better

health standards. In fact, the
preponderance of the cancer
cases in this country are caused
by smoking unlike the Third
World, where most cancers are
the direct result of such infec
tions.
The H. pylori bacterium is not
directly responsible for the cell
mutations that cause cancer, but
it creates conditions which are
favorable to mutations within
the cells of the stomach lining.
The presence of the foreign
bacteria in the stomach causes
inflammation — the body's natu
ral defense against foreign
invaders. The inflammatory
response "kills foreign invaders
and produces toxins," Parsonnet
said.
"The inflammatory cells
excrete things that are danger
ous to the body," she added. In
the case of H. pylori, the bacteri
al invaders are not eliminated.
"The body has no ability to get
rid of H. pylori, so you have con
stant inflammation that kills
your cells."
The inflammation also pro
duces free radicals — unstable
oxygen-based molecules that can
actually attack and alter the
internal structure of cells' DNA.
Because cells in the stomach
proliferate by dividing rapidly,
they are placed at a higher risk of
mutations which can occur dur

ing cell division — when the
DNA is replicated — and can
then lead to cancer.
Mutagens, which are the
agents that cause mutation, can
also enter the body through a
wide variety of vehicles, includ
ing a person's dietary food
intake.
"The classic example for stom
ach cancer is that mutagens can
be nitrates in food," Parsonnet
said. The nitrates themselves are
not mutagens, but they can be
converted to mutagens inside the
body. Antioxidants like vitamins
A, C, and E prevent mutations by
destroying the free radicals
which mutagens can unleash on
the cells.

Though the bacteria do infect
about half of the world's popula
tion, people can be carriers and
not be aware of the organism
inside them.
There are no symptoms of the
infection, except that 10 to 20
percent of the people in the
infected population develop
ulcers.
In performing their research,
Parsonnet and her research team
identified a sample of 33 people
with gastric non-Hodgkin's lym
phoma, and tested them for the
presence of the H. pylori bacteri
um.
When the results were com
pared to a control group without
the cancer, the group with the

disease was six times more likely
to be infected with H pylori.
Though the discovery of this
new mechanism for contracting
stomach cancer provides
researchers with more informa
tion about the relationships
between infection and cancer, it
may not offer ways to prevent
the cancer from affliction peo
ple.
But according to Parsonnet,
the current research is helping
scientists to recognize the
"importance of these interac
tions." In the future, this knowl
edge may aid in combating infec
tions which today's technology
does not provide the means to
fight.

The bacteria are very com
mon, infecting approximately
half of the world's population
and, according to the new
research, may cause cancer in
the cells that make up the lining
of the stomach.
The link between gastric can
cer and the bacteria, uncovered
in Parsonnet's recent study, will
likely add to scientists' current
knowledge about the role of
infectious agents in causing dis
eases.
"One third of the cancers in
the world are caused by infec
tion," Parsonnet said, adding
that other inflammatory disease
processes are also caused by
infection.
However, in order to conclu

sively prove a causal relationship
between the bacterial infection
and gastric non-Hodgkin's lym
phoma, researchers would need
to treat a group of infected
patients.
This group could then be com
pared with a control group com
posed of non-treated, infected
patients. If the bacteria were
indeed responsible for stomach
cancer, the incidence of the dis
ease in the treated group should
fall because they would no longer
be infected.
Such a study would take many
years. As a result, the relation
between the bacteria and cancer
has not been proven. However,
according to Parsonnet, the
research at the Medical School
has shown "a strong association"
between the bacteria and the
cancer.
She explained that many dis
eases result from infection by dif
ferent organisms. For example,
Hepatitis is caused by a virus,
and bladder cancer occurs
because of the presence of the
bladder worm. Though both of
these infections are peripheral to
the disease itself, they play an
important role in allowing dis
eases such as cancer to take hold.
Parsonnet explained that in
the U.S. infections are less of a
problem than throughout the
rest of the world due to better

health standards. In fact, the
preponderance of the cancer
cases in this country are caused
by smoking unlike the Third
World, where most cancers are
the direct result of such infec
tions.
The H. pylori bacterium is not
directly responsible for the cell
mutations that cause cancer, but
it creates conditions which are
favorable to mutations within
the cells of the stomach lining.
The presence of the foreign
bacteria in the stomach causes
inflammation — the body's natu
ral defense against foreign
invaders. The inflammatory
response "kills foreign invaders
and produces toxins," Parsonnet
said.
"The inflammatory cells
excrete things that are danger
ous to the body," she added. In
the case of H. pylori, the bacteri
al invaders are not eliminated.
"The body has no ability to get
rid of H. pylori, so you have con
stant inflammation that kills
your cells."
The inflammation also pro
duces free radicals — unstable
oxygen-based molecules that can
actually attack and alter the
internal structure of cells' DNA.
Because cells in the stomach
proliferate by dividing rapidly,
they are placed at a higher risk of
mutations which can occur dur

ing cell division — when the
DNA is replicated — and can
then lead to cancer.
Mutagens, which are the
agents that cause mutation, can
also enter the body through a
wide variety of vehicles, includ
ing a person's dietary food
intake.
"The classic example for stom
ach cancer is that mutagens can
be nitrates in food," Parsonnet
said. The nitrates themselves are
not mutagens, but they can be
converted to mutagens inside the
body. Antioxidants like vitamins
A, C, and E prevent mutations by
destroying the free radicals
which mutagens can unleash on
the cells.

Though the bacteria do infect
about half of the world's popula
tion, people can be carriers and
not be aware of the organism
inside them.
There are no symptoms of the
infection, except that 10 to 20
percent of the people in the
infected population develop
ulcers.
In performing their research,
Parsonnet and her research team
identified a sample of 33 people
with gastric non-Hodgkin's lym
phoma, and tested them for the
presence of the H. pylori bacteri
um.
When the results were com
pared to a control group without
the cancer, the group with the

disease was six times more likely
to be infected with H pylori.
Though the discovery of this
new mechanism for contracting
stomach cancer provides
researchers with more informa
tion about the relationships
between infection and cancer, it
may not offer ways to prevent
the cancer from affliction peo
ple.
But according to Parsonnet,
the current research is helping
scientists to recognize the
"importance of these interac
tions." In the future, this knowl
edge may aid in combating infec
tions which today's technology
does not provide the means to
fight.
