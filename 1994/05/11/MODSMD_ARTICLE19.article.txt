# Radio club talks to the world
## Students use ham radio to experiment, communicate with people across the globe 
### Michael Slemmer Editorial staff 
Long before many of the build
ings that currently make up Stan
ford's campus were built, students
were operating a primitive radio as
part of the on-campus amateur
radio club.
Today, a small but dedicated num
ber of students continue the tradition
that began in 1928 — participating in
competitions, preparing to support
area communications in a disaster
and teaching courses to get new peo
ple involved in amateur or "ham"
radio.

'We've talked to some
countries that don't
even exist anymore'
— John Beale

In addition, according to club
president John Beale, a graduate
student in applied physics, mem
bers also provide public service.
"We help out with a number of
events," he said, adding that mem
bers will be helping with communi
cations for the World Cup soccer
competition which will be held on
campus this summer.
The club, whose call sign W6YX
has identified it throughout its
many years of operation, also par
ticipates in an annual field-day
competition, where hams take their
radios to a location away from their
usual site, where electric power
lines are not available.
Beale said that in the past the
club has been successful in the com
petition's goal — contacting as
many stations as possible within a

given amount of time. "The method
of communication and amount of
power you use is almost a religious
issue," he said.
The competition is scored on a
national level and, within its partic
ular category, W6YX has put in
some of the best performances in
the country in past years.
"We use battery power for most
of our field-day communication,"
Beale said. "But last year I was able
to make some contacts using a solar
panel I brought along."
One of the major goals of ama
teur radio is experimentation and,
according to Beale, the radio fre
quencies set aside for hams are "the
only ones where you can really
design, build and use your own
equipment.
"All other frequencies require
radios certified by the IFederal
Communications Commissionl," he
added. Though the club regularly
experiments with new ideas for
radio communication, most of the
equipment — which is located in
two trailers on Searsville Road that
make up W6YX's home base — is
commercially bought.
Most of the radios, amplifiers
and antennas were donated by com
panies outside of Stanford, but
some of the equipment was
acquired with the club's limited
resources.
According to Beale, most of the
money comes from members' dues
and some funding from the Electri
cal Engineering Department.
However, experimentation at
W6YX in the past did produce
achievements which altered the
course of amateur radio communi
cations. For example, the first sin
gle-sideband transmission occurred
in 1947 between Oswald Villard, a

student using the equipment at the
Stanford club, and the ham club at
UCLA.
Today, this method of communi
cation — which involves stripping
the carrier tone and one sideband
from a traditional AM signal, mak
ing the signal more compact — is
now recognized worldwide as the
most popular method of communi
cation on high-frequency ham
bands.
Beyond experimenting with radio
equipment and participating in con
tests, club members try to reach, or
"work," contacts across the world
as a hobby practiced purely for its
own sake.
In its long history, the club's
radios have contacted hams in more
than 225 countries, Beale said.
"We've talked to some countries
that don't even exist anymore."
He estimated the total number of
other amateurs contacted over the
years to be in the tens of thousands.
"We have stacks of books filled with
the call signs of people we've con
tacted," Beale said. "And many of
them send us postcards confirming
the contact."
As a result, within the club's
trailers is a wide selection of these
"QSL" cards, confirming contacts
with locations as varied as Japan,
Germany and South Africa.
To put their signals on the air,
the club's base has a number of
antennas, ranging from a dish to
communicate with satellites to a
wire 160 meters long used for trans
missions at much higher wave
lengths.
Currently, there are 30 members
in the radio club, but according to
Beale, few of them are actually stu
dents — community members are
also allowed access to the club's
resources.
"We are constantly looking for
new members," he said, pointing to
two classes held earlier this quarter
to attract students.
Because ham radio operators are
licensed by the FCC, they must pass
a test before being able to use the
club's facilities.

The club also participates in satellite communications, carried out with this
dish bearing the call sign the club has owned for more than half a century.

The club's two trailers on Searsville
Road contain equipment used in
communicating with others across
the world.
