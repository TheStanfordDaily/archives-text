# Spat at Zapata
## Review raises ire of residents 
### Burt Herman Editorial staff 
A heated debate eventually re
quiring police intervention over
distribution of The Stanford Re
view erupted in Casa Zapata ear
lier this week.
The Review staff may pursue
action against Resident Fellow
Tony Burciaga through either
University or California judicial
processes, or both, if it can be de
termined that Burciaga violated
any regulations or laws, Review
staff writer Ed Malone said last
night.
The conflict first arose when
three Review staff members at
tempted to distribute copies of
the newspaper under individual
students' doors Monday evening.
But residents of the house op
posed the actions of the Review
staff members, claiming that the
distribution was against dorm
policy.
Zapata is a flier-free dorm,
meaning that all materials which
are to be distributed to students
must be given to resident assis
tants or theme associates who
then distribute them to students,
said Nancy Salas, a theme associ
ate in the house.
There is no universal policy
regarding flier distribution in
University residences, according
to Stern Residential Office Coor
dinator Janet Wright. Outside
solicitors are prohibited from dis
tributing materials, but each
house determines its own policy
for on-campus materials, she
said.
Other campus publications,
including the Stanford Cha
parral, regularly distribute mate
rial under the doors of student
rooms.
The Review has not been pre
viously distributed under doors
in Zapata. However, the Review
staff decided to distribute this
issue of the newspaper in light of
thefts of Review issues that have
occurred in the past, according to

Review Editor in Chief Adam
Ross.
The three staff members —
Malone, Business Manager Bob
Dolbow and columnist Jack
Guerrero — first entered Zapata
around 5:40 p.m., according to a
statement released last night by
The Review.

'We were both avoid
ing physical con
frontation. I think
they were trying to
avoid anything.'
— Tony Burciaga

After placing a pile of newspa
pers in the first-floor hallway,
the three attempted to place
copies under doors, Burciaga
said. At this point, Burciaga
picked up the pile and placed the
newspapers in a recycling bin. "I
was pretty angry," Burciaga said.
Burciaga told the Review dis
tributors to "get out," but they
did not comply with his request,

he said.
According to the Review staff
members, Burciaga called the
publication "trash" while mak
ing three trips to the recycling
bin with copies of the newspaper.
"1 Burciaga] became very agi
tated immediately," Dolbow said.
"We were extremely nervous,"
Guerrero added.
After trying to distribute
newspapers on the first floor,
Dolbow attempted to ascend to
the second floor of the house,
when Burciaga stood in the stair
way and spread his arms to block
Dolbow's path, Salas said.
At one point in the stairwell,
Dolbow bumped into Burciaga,
but then backed off, according to
Dolbow.
"We were both avoiding physi
cal confrontation," Burciaga
said. "I think they were trying to
avoid anything."
The two sides dispute when —
or whether — the Review was
informed about Zapata's flier
policy.
There were no signs posted
stating the house's flier policy,
according to Guerrero. "Nobody
informed me that what I was
doing was wrong," Dolbow said.

"Had Mr. Burciaga told us, we
would have gladly left."
But Salas said that she — as
well as other residents — person
ally told the Review staff mem
bers before they tried to go
upstairs that what they were
doing was against house policy.
A crowd of about students was
attracted by the commotion in
the house. Estimates of the
crowd's size range from 25 to 50
students.
Salas went to RF Cecilia Bur
ciaga and told her of the alterca
tion. "When they wouldn't leave,
Cecilia informed them of the
(flier) policy," Tony Burciaga
said. "By that time I called
police."
When police arrived, a com
promise to place copies of The
Review in the lobby was worked
out between the residents and
the Review staff members,
according to Stanford Police Sgt.
Philip Love.
The current issue of the
Review contains a news story
and an editorial entitled "El
Protesto Stupido" that address
the issue of the three-day hunger
strike held last week in the Inner
Quad.
