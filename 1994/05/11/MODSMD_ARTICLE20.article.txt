## Going without eating can harm your health 
### Cris Niell 
Q:When someone is fasting (such as
the students out in the Main Quad),
what effects does this have on the
body?
—- concerned fellow student
A: At this point, our friends in the
Quad are hopefully back on a normal
Stanford diet. However, the body
actually has a lot of safety mechanisms to
protect itself during a food deficit —
whether this means skipping lunch, fasting
for several days or extended famine. So
let's go on a guided tour of hunger.
When eating normally, you should be
getting plenty of carbohydrates and fats,
which supply energy in addition to being
the basis for many organic molecules. If
you don't need all the carbohydrates and
fat you take in, they can be converted into
other forms and stored in the liver, mus
cles or the dreaded fat tissue to be used
later.
You also need to be taking in protein,
which is broken down into amino acids.
These are used mainly to rebuild the pro
teins in the body, which are constantly
being worn down, while at the same time
helping you to grow bigger. However, the
body has no "reserves," where extra pro
tein can be kept.
When you skip lunch, your body first
notices that your blood sugar levels begin
to drop. This means you are not getting
enough energy to your cells. In addition to
sending messages to your brain telling you
to get some food, your body then releases
hormones (glucagon and epinephrine) that
start opening up the stored fat and carbo
hydrate reserves, and burning them for
energy.
But, because there is no Fort Knox for
protein, as the proteins in the body are bro
ken down from normal wear and tear, they
can not be replaced. Thus, even one day
without enough protein can be bad news.
Now, after about a day without food,
you will have finished off your carbohy
drate stores and will be using up your fat
reserves. This is what a lot of people spend
a lot of time running, Thighmastering, and
Sweating to the Oldies trying to do.
However, if you do this by not eating
enough food, rather than by simply burn
ing more energy, remember that those pro
teins are being worn down without being
replaced.
If you keep going without eating, you
eventually use up your stored fat as well.
How long this takes depends on how much
of these reserves you have (i.e. Mr.
Belvedere could probably last a while), but
is around three weeks for the average per
son.
Then you're in real trouble, because to

get fuel you go to the only thing you have
left, which is protein. So, basically, your
metabolism starts cannibalizing your own
body.
The first proteins to go are the blood
proteins — since you want to protect the
structural proteins so you don't fall apart.
As these proteins are removed, osmosis
starts pushing a corresponding amount of
water from the blood, which accumulates
in the abdomen and extremities. This
unfortunate condition, known as edema, is
what causes the swollen stomachs in pic
tures of starving Ethiopian children.
After this comes severe muscle atrophy
and brain loss. At this point, things are
looking pretty grim, so we'll stop here.
But along the way, there are also some
other nasty side effects. As proteins are
broken down, ammonia will be released
into the bloodstream. Also, many of the
toxins that get into our body are locked
away in the fat cells, where they can't do
too much harm. As the fat reserves get
used up, these toxins will be released.
Although some people say this is
healthy, in that it cleanses the body of poi
sons, the toxins could do some serious
damage before getting flushed out. Inci
dentally, this is part of the reason eating
fatty meat is bad for you — animals also
store away toxins in their fat tissues.
As bad as all of this sounds, there are
actually animals which regularly go with
out food for extended periods of times. For
example, blue whales are forced to go for
several months without eating because
their food supply is seasonal, and bears do
not eat all winter while hibernating.
The bear achieves this result by eating a
lot before going to sleep in order to build up
fat reserves, and by being able to resynthe
size amino acids. This enables them to
recycle protein building blocks so that the
bear does not suffer from protein loss over
the course of the winter because, as pro
teins deteriorate, they can be replaced
using the remains of the original compo
nents.
Many people endorse fasting as an
important technique for cleansing the body
and clearing the mind. Some Native Amer
icans used to fast before the hunt, so that
their prey would not be able to detect them
by their scent. Although most scientific
evidence would suggest that fasting is only
spiritually and psychologically beneficial,
perhaps there are some benefits to going
hungry.
But my stomach is rumbling, so I'm
going to get something to eat.
