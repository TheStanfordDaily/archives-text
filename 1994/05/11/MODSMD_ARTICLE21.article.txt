## Hinch provides powerful package at plate Catcher combines rifle arm, big bat, speed on basepaths to anchor Cardinal offense, defense 
### Swaminatha Gurudevan Staff writer 
It has been said that behind every
great pitching staff is a great catcher,
and Stanford catcher A.J. Hinch is no
exception. Hinch, a 6-foot-l, 193-pound
sophomore from Midwest City, Okla.,
has been the anchor of the Cardinal
pitching rotation, starting all 53 games
behind the plate for the Cardinal in
1994.

Entering the 1994 season, Hinch was
rated the second best catcher in the
nation by Baseball America. He is
unusually talented for his position, since
he possess both an extremely strong arm
and speed on the basepaths. So far this
season, Hinch has thrown out a phe
nomenal 57 percent of attempted bases
tealers.
"Behind the plate, he does a great
job," said Cardinal third baseman Brian
Dallimore. "I don't think anybody in the

country has more confidence in their
catcher than we do in A.J. He can catch
and throw with the best in the country."
Hinch's cannonlike arm has also con
tributed to the excellent performance
put in by the Cardinal pitching stafT this
season to create a devastating one-two
punch for opposing batters.
"One thing that a lot of people over
look is the fact that A.J. blocks a lot of
balls — he's a great defensive catcher,"
said Stanford second baseman Jed
Hansen. "That helps out a lot since it
allows the pitchers to throw a split-finger
fastball or a curveball. They're not afraid
to throw the ball in the dirt because they
know that A.J. is going to get in front of
it."
Offensively, Hinch has been one of
the Cardinal's most consistent hitters in
1994, as his batting average stands at
.330. He has also added 11 doubles, five
home runs and 32 RBI. Hinch has also
shown himself to be one of the most dis
ciplined batters on the team, drawing a
team-leading 44 walks and compiling a
.463 on-base percentage. He is also an
excellent contact hitter, and has struck
out only 26 times in 194 at-bats.
"A.J. is one of those guys who is
always going to be successful," Dallimore
said. "He's always going to be swinging
the bat well, and you know that with him
hitting behind you or him hitting in
front of you, you're going to have oppor
tunities because he's going to be involved
in all the situations you're in."
Hinch's speed and aggressiveness on
the basepaths often makes life difficult
for his counterpart on the opposing
team. So far in 1994, he has been suc
cessful on 13 of 21 stolen base attempts,
third best on the team.
"He is unusual for a catcher in that he
can run and he can steal a base," said
Cardinal coach Mark Marquess. "It's dif
ficult, because you're squatting down
the whole game and it takes away from
your leg strength. But he can steal a
base, and he's done it all year for us."

Catcher A.J. Hinch blocks the plate from a Pacific runner in a game earlier this year. Defense is but one of the sopho
more's talents, as he also sports a .330 average and 13 stolen bases.
1-0 in the bottom of the sixth
inning, Hinch gave the Cardinal a
lift with his fifth home run of the
season, a two-run shot to give the
Cardinal a 2-1 lead.
The Bruins came back to tie the
game in the top of the eighth, but
Hinch responded in the bottom of
the inning, doubling to lead off the
inning and scoring on a suicide
squeeze bunt by Stanford first
baseman Dusty Allen.
"He's valuable at both ends of
the spectrum and he's done a great
job for us," Allen said.
Hinch came to Stanford as one
of the top recruits in the nation
out of Midwest City High School in
Midwest City, Okla. During his
senior season in 1992, he hit .476
with three home runs, 43 RBI and
39 stolen bases while playing
catcher. He also pitched during the
same season, compiling a 5-0
record and 1.97 ERA while leading
his team to a 34-7 overall record.
"We played against each other
in high school," said Allen, also an
Oklahoma native. "We were on
rival high school teams and we
played against each other during

the season and in the summer
time. He's always been a quality
player."
In recognition of his outstand
ing senior season, Hinch was
named the Gatorade Circle of
Champions National High School
Baseball Player of the Year and
was drafted in the second round of
the June 1992 major league draft
by the Chicago White Sox.
However, Hinch decided to turn
down the offer to play professional
baseball early in favor of playing
for Stanford and Marquess. In
doing so, he became the first
Gatorade national winner to turn
down a professional contract to
play collegiate baseball.
"A lot of people look at Stan
ford and see their athletics and see
the academics, and they overlook
the people who are here," Hinch
said. "There are a lot of great peo
ple here and I'm just enjoying
every day here. Our being success
ful this year has made my choice to
come here definitely worth it."
Hinch made an immediate
impact for the Cardinal in 1993,
starting 50 games behind the
plate. Offensively, he had one of
the best freshman seasons ever
compiled at Stanford, leading the
team with a .350 batting average
and 71 hits to go with 4 home runs

and 38 RBI. Against Pacific 10
Conference Southern Division foes
Hinch swung an even hotter bat,
hitting .380 with 20 RHI in 30
games.
"He's a complete player," Mar
quess said. "Even when he's not
swinging the bat well, he'll con
tribute by getting a walk or getting
a bunt."
Marquess said he believes that
Hinch has tremendous potential
as a professional player. Many
scouts have already projected
Hinch as the No. 1 pick in the 1995
major league draft.
"I think that he's going to be a
first round draft pick because he
can catch," Marquess said. "Pro
fessional baseball has a shortage of
players who can catch and throw,
and he can do that."
Despite his major league aspira
tions, Hinch has kept his success
in perspective.
"Ever since I was a kid, I have
wanted to play major league base
ball and hopefully if I do what I
can do and play the game that I
can play, then that should take
care of itself and I should get a
shot," Hinch said. "But first
things first — I want to win a
national championship here and
I'm looking forward to postseason
play this year and next year."

"He is unusual for a catcher in that he
can run and he can steal a base," said
Cardinal coach Mark Marquess. "It's dif
ficult, because you're squatting down
the whole game and it takes away from
your leg strength. But he can steal a
base, and he's done it all year for us."

Catcher A.J. Hinch blocks the plate from a Pacific runner in a game earlier this year. Defense is but one of the sopho
more's talents, as he also sports a .330 average and 13 stolen bases.
1-0 in the bottom of the sixth
inning, Hinch gave the Cardinal a
lift with his fifth home run of the
season, a two-run shot to give the
Cardinal a 2-1 lead.
The Bruins came back to tie the
game in the top of the eighth, but
Hinch responded in the bottom of
the inning, doubling to lead off the
inning and scoring on a suicide
squeeze bunt by Stanford first
baseman Dusty Allen.
"He's valuable at both ends of
the spectrum and he's done a great
job for us," Allen said.
Hinch came to Stanford as one
of the top recruits in the nation
out of Midwest City High School in
Midwest City, Okla. During his
senior season in 1992, he hit .476
with three home runs, 43 RBI and
39 stolen bases while playing
catcher. He also pitched during the
same season, compiling a 5-0
record and 1.97 ERA while leading
his team to a 34-7 overall record.
"We played against each other
in high school," said Allen, also an
Oklahoma native. "We were on
rival high school teams and we
played against each other during

the season and in the summer
time. He's always been a quality
player."
In recognition of his outstand
ing senior season, Hinch was
named the Gatorade Circle of
Champions National High School
Baseball Player of the Year and
was drafted in the second round of
the June 1992 major league draft
by the Chicago White Sox.
However, Hinch decided to turn
down the offer to play professional
baseball early in favor of playing
for Stanford and Marquess. In
doing so, he became the first
Gatorade national winner to turn
down a professional contract to
play collegiate baseball.
"A lot of people look at Stan
ford and see their athletics and see
the academics, and they overlook
the people who are here," Hinch
said. "There are a lot of great peo
ple here and I'm just enjoying
every day here. Our being success
ful this year has made my choice to
come here definitely worth it."
Hinch made an immediate
impact for the Cardinal in 1993,
starting 50 games behind the
plate. Offensively, he had one of
the best freshman seasons ever
compiled at Stanford, leading the
team with a .350 batting average
and 71 hits to go with 4 home runs

and 38 RBI. Against Pacific 10
Conference Southern Division foes
Hinch swung an even hotter bat,
hitting .380 with 20 RHI in 30
games.
"He's a complete player," Mar
quess said. "Even when he's not
swinging the bat well, he'll con
tribute by getting a walk or getting
a bunt."
Marquess said he believes that
Hinch has tremendous potential
as a professional player. Many
scouts have already projected
Hinch as the No. 1 pick in the 1995
major league draft.
"I think that he's going to be a
first round draft pick because he
can catch," Marquess said. "Pro
fessional baseball has a shortage of
players who can catch and throw,
and he can do that."
Despite his major league aspira
tions, Hinch has kept his success
in perspective.
"Ever since I was a kid, I have
wanted to play major league base
ball and hopefully if I do what I
can do and play the game that I
can play, then that should take
care of itself and I should get a
shot," Hinch said. "But first
things first — I want to win a
national championship here and
I'm looking forward to postseason
play this year and next year."
It has been said that behind every
great pitching staff is a great catcher,
and Stanford catcher A.J. Hinch is no
exception. Hinch, a 6-foot-l, 193-pound
sophomore from Midwest City, Okla.,
has been the anchor of the Cardinal
pitching rotation, starting all 53 games
behind the plate for the Cardinal in
1994.

Entering the 1994 season, Hinch was
rated the second best catcher in the
nation by Baseball America. He is
unusually talented for his position, since
he possess both an extremely strong arm
and speed on the basepaths. So far this
season, Hinch has thrown out a phe
nomenal 57 percent of attempted bases
tealers.
"Behind the plate, he does a great
job," said Cardinal third baseman Brian
Dallimore. "I don't think anybody in the

country has more confidence in their
catcher than we do in A.J. He can catch
and throw with the best in the country."
Hinch's cannonlike arm has also con
tributed to the excellent performance
put in by the Cardinal pitching stafT this
season to create a devastating one-two
punch for opposing batters.
"One thing that a lot of people over
look is the fact that A.J. blocks a lot of
balls — he's a great defensive catcher,"
said Stanford second baseman Jed
Hansen. "That helps out a lot since it
allows the pitchers to throw a split-finger
fastball or a curveball. They're not afraid
to throw the ball in the dirt because they
know that A.J. is going to get in front of
it."
Offensively, Hinch has been one of
the Cardinal's most consistent hitters in
1994, as his batting average stands at
.330. He has also added 11 doubles, five
home runs and 32 RBI. Hinch has also
shown himself to be one of the most dis
ciplined batters on the team, drawing a
team-leading 44 walks and compiling a
.463 on-base percentage. He is also an
excellent contact hitter, and has struck
out only 26 times in 194 at-bats.
"A.J. is one of those guys who is
always going to be successful," Dallimore
said. "He's always going to be swinging
the bat well, and you know that with him
hitting behind you or him hitting in
front of you, you're going to have oppor
tunities because he's going to be involved
in all the situations you're in."
Hinch's speed and aggressiveness on
the basepaths often makes life difficult
for his counterpart on the opposing
team. So far in 1994, he has been suc
cessful on 13 of 21 stolen base attempts,
third best on the team.
"He is unusual for a catcher in that he
can run and he can steal a base," said
Cardinal coach Mark Marquess. "It's dif
ficult, because you're squatting down
