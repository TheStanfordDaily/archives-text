## Hinch provides powerful package at plate Catcher combines rifle arm, big bat, speed on basepaths to anchor Cardinal offense, defense 
### Swaminatha Gurudevan Staff writer 
It has been said that behind every
great pitching staff is a great catcher,
and Stanford catcher A.J. Hinch is no
exception. Hinch, a 6-foot-l, 193-pound
sophomore from Midwest City, Okla.,
has been the anchor of the Cardinal
pitching rotation, starting all 53 games
behind the plate for the Cardinal in
1994.

Entering the 1994 season, Hinch was
rated the second best catcher in the
nation by Baseball America. He is
unusually talented for his position, since
he possess both an extremely strong arm
and speed on the basepaths. So far this
season, Hinch has thrown out a phe
nomenal 57 percent of attempted bases
tealers.
"Behind the plate, he does a great
job," said Cardinal third baseman Brian
Dallimore. "I don't think anybody in the

country has more confidence in their
catcher than we do in A.J. He can catch
and throw with the best in the country."
Hinch's cannonlike arm has also con
tributed to the excellent performance
put in by the Cardinal pitching stafT this
season to create a devastating one-two
punch for opposing batters.
"One thing that a lot of people over
look is the fact that A.J. blocks a lot of
balls — he's a great defensive catcher,"
said Stanford second baseman Jed
Hansen. "That helps out a lot since it
allows the pitchers to throw a split-finger
fastball or a curveball. They're not afraid
to throw the ball in the dirt because they
know that A.J. is going to get in front of
it."
Offensively, Hinch has been one of
the Cardinal's most consistent hitters in
1994, as his batting average stands at
.330. He has also added 11 doubles, five
home runs and 32 RBI. Hinch has also
shown himself to be one of the most dis
ciplined batters on the team, drawing a
team-leading 44 walks and compiling a
.463 on-base percentage. He is also an
excellent contact hitter, and has struck
out only 26 times in 194 at-bats.
"A.J. is one of those guys who is
always going to be successful," Dallimore
said. "He's always going to be swinging
the bat well, and you know that with him
hitting behind you or him hitting in
front of you, you're going to have oppor
tunities because he's going to be involved
in all the situations you're in."
Hinch's speed and aggressiveness on
the basepaths often makes life difficult
for his counterpart on the opposing
team. So far in 1994, he has been suc
cessful on 13 of 21 stolen base attempts,
third best on the team.
"He is unusual for a catcher in that he
can run and he can steal a base," said
Cardinal coach Mark Marquess. "It's dif
ficult, because you're squatting down
the whole game and it takes away from
your leg strength. But he can steal a
base, and he's done it all year for us."
