Something wasn't right.
Varsity men's crew coach Wieslaw Kujda
had described the Opening Day Races of this
past weekend as "the last tryout to make
everything 100 percent correct before Pac
-10s."
Unfortunately, the Cardinal did not appear
to be at 100 percent. Both the men's and
women's varsity boats finished third in a
group of three, a bit of a disappointment.
"Neither of the teams felt that we had raced
up to our potential," said rower Cathy
Humphrey, a senior. "We thought we could
have raced a lot faster than we did."
It was an honor merely for the Cardinal to
participate in the Opening Day Races, as the
University of Washington distributes its invi
tations sparingly. Considered the largest spec
tator regatta in the world, the emphasis
seemed to be placed on the private yachts lin
ing the harbor, rather than on the actual
races. The competition was stiff, including the
Huskies and the Dutch National Team, yet
Stanford had hoped to present more of a
threat.
"Washington is considered the preeminent
power on the West Coast, and we had been
hoping to really challenge them," senior Dar
ren Rice explained.
Maybe it was the spectacle of the event, or
the thousands of people crowding the harbor
to join in the festivities. Whatever the case,
one thing was true â€” a change was necessary.
"Everyone was a bit confused as to why it
went so poorly, but we did our best to turn it
around on Sunday," said Rice.
Sunday landed the Cardinal in Corvallis,
Ore. facing a decent Oregon State squad. Dis
contented by the results of the previous day's
races, the Stanford teams took to the waters
with renewed intensity, determined to claim
victory.
