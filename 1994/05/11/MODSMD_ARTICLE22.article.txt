# The 						good with the bad
## Opening Day stymies crew

Something wasn't right.
Varsity men's crew coach Wieslaw Kujda
had described the Opening Day Races of this
past weekend as "the last tryout to make
everything 100 percent correct before Pac
-10s."
Unfortunately, the Cardinal did not appear
to be at 100 percent. Both the men's and
women's varsity boats finished third in a
group of three, a bit of a disappointment.
"Neither of the teams felt that we had raced
up to our potential," said rower Cathy
Humphrey, a senior. "We thought we could
have raced a lot faster than we did."
It was an honor merely for the Cardinal to
participate in the Opening Day Races, as the
University of Washington distributes its invi
tations sparingly. Considered the largest spec
tator regatta in the world, the emphasis
seemed to be placed on the private yachts lin
ing the harbor, rather than on the actual
races. The competition was stiff, including the
Huskies and the Dutch National Team, yet
Stanford had hoped to present more of a
threat.
"Washington is considered the preeminent
power on the West Coast, and we had been
hoping to really challenge them," senior Dar
ren Rice explained.
Maybe it was the spectacle of the event, or
the thousands of people crowding the harbor
to join in the festivities. Whatever the case,
one thing was true — a change was necessary.
"Everyone was a bit confused as to why it
went so poorly, but we did our best to turn it
around on Sunday," said Rice.
Sunday landed the Cardinal in Corvallis,
Ore. facing a decent Oregon State squad. Dis
contented by the results of the previous day's
races, the Stanford teams took to the waters
with renewed intensity, determined to claim
victory.
"We all went out there with
something to prove, to remind
ourselves that we are fast
boats," said Humphrey.
Those necessary changes
were made. "We pulled things
together and made some lineup
changes," said Rice. "We felt a
lot sharper, as things were
beginning to click finally."
Sunday proved to be very suc
cessful, as the Cardinal
regrouped and was able to sweep

Oregon State. In the words of
Humphrey, "we pretty much
clocked them."
Stanford is now preparing for
the last races of the season. Pac
10s are to be held next weekend
in Sacramento, and the top two
finishers go on to nationals. The
main competition is nothing
new, as Stanford is seeded third
behind Washington and Cal.
"We are looking forward to
Pac-lOs. We're hoping to peak
for that race, and challenge
Washington for the top seed,"
said Rice. "We'll definitely be
gunning for Cal as well, as a sort
of revenge after the Big Row."

All in all, the reflections on
this past weekend are mixed.
While Saturday's results did not
meet initial expectations, Sun
day demonstrated the resiliency
and determination of the Stan
ford teams, characteristics that
should prove to be very valuable
in the weeks to come. As Rice
reflected, "The weekend ended
on a good note at Oregon State
and hopefully we'll be able to
maintain that force. We have a
tough week ahead of us. We
ijeed to keep our aggression and
focus up — I think that con
tributed a lot to our success on
Sunday."
