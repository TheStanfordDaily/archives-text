## Ode to the Bay Area 
### 
Grumblings abound in the
Bay Area over this locale's
seemingly annual rite of
spring.
'Twas the middle of springtime and
Jill through the Bay
The sun was shining to celebrate
the beginning of May
But amid talk of sun tanning under
skies so clear
People began grumbling — "where
will our team be this year?"
But this time, the team was not the
Giants
Threatening to leave San Francis
cans with a bleeding heart,
But rather the A's and Warriors
Who would make a stop at the Oak
land Coliseum pointless for BART.
The A's are tired of being considered
as the Bay's "second" team
And want a home stadium that serves
more than franks and beans.
A "Camden Yards of the West" in
their eyes would be ideal
For then the fans could watch a
ballgame while enjoying a fancy
meal.
As for the Warriors, the fans still
come out in force
For when it comes to hoops, they
are the only team to hold court.
But the Warriors, in the '90s, want
to make more money each night
And need luxury boxes to cater to
the rich and erudite.
Revenue is the bottom line for the
NBA team called Golden State
So San Francisco is offering a gym
that would be first rate.
But there's no need for that option,
or the song Funky Cold Medina,
The choice for the Warriors is obvi
ous — San Jose Arena.
The Sharks of pro hockey have made
San Jose a mqjor league town
That no longer needs to play second
fiddle to the other cities around.
For the fans in the South Bay are as
wild and faithful as can be,
So much so that they come out to
the Arena to watch the away
playoff games on TV.
The Arena is meant for basketball,
and will certainly draw fans
When Cal played its season opener
there was not a space in the
stands.
People will wiLnngly travel to see the
Warriors play
They will pack their care to see Web
ber, just as they do Irbe.
While towns across the Bay want
pro basketball in their 'hood
Most could care less if the A's left
for good.
For the A's play baseball in the

American League West
Which by all methods of consensus
is far from baseball's best.
And so Oakland, learning from
lessons hard and past
Has offered to renovate the stadium
to bring it up to task,
For the last time the city failed to
listen, it was left eating its curds
and whey
As A 1 Davis took his beloved Raiders
and moved to L A.
The A's owners are selling the club
at a bargain price
They're sacrificing a potential $30
million, isn't that nice?
But there's a catch, for the $85 mil
that you will have to spend
Is contingent upon promising to
keep the A's in Oakland.
So for Oakland these are desperate
times trying to save the sports
scene in the East Bay
When all signs and signals point to
San Jose.
The East Bay would then only have
Cal, mid what a sad plight
For sans Jason Kidd and Lamond
Murray, Cal's team will be mere
ly all right.
As for the Peninsula, our area
would be a great hub
Need we forget Stanford football,
the 49ers unofficial minor league
club?
What with the Sharks, Warriors,
and Bill Walsh in tow
How could a sports fjin be anything
but aglow?
And should the Giants then rent
moving vans to leave frigid Can
dlestick Park
The entire Bay Area would drive
south after dark,
But of course this is all speculation,
nothing has happened yet
We cannot divert attention from the
Sharks, primed for another
upset.
So in this era of potential sports
musical chairs
The city of Oakland must do its best
to show it cares,
But ultimately, the decisions rest
with the Warriors and A's
For as we all know now, in the end
the owners make the plays.

Next week S<'hivartz tries haiku.
