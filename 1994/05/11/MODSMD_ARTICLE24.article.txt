### Vanessa Hua Staff writer 
The men's ultimate frisbee team
crushed the competition at the
Western Regionals last weekend at
UC-Santa Barbara where it went
undefeated, earning a berth in
nationals as the number-one seed.
On Saturday, the ultimate team,
which has dubbed itself Team
Bloodthirsty, tore UC-Davis, Ore
gon State, UC-Santa Cruz and UC-
Santa Barbara limb from limb and
entered Sunday's quarterfinals
with its No. 1 seed intact. The next
day it demolished the Oregon and
Humboldt State teams, and chal
lenged UC-Santa Barbara for the
top position. With the fmal tied at
6-6, Stanford called a time out and
then proceeded to win, 17-9.

Team member Jesse Roach, a
junior, attributed the second half
surge to crowd support.
The ultimate team has had a
successful season, posting a 19-3
record in the most difficult region
in the country.
"Five out of the top six teams in
the nation are from this area,"
team co-captain and junior Terry
Cussen said.
The ultimate team's hist trip to
nationals was five years ago. Since
then, the team saw its consistently
high ranking during the season
evaporate under the wilting May
sun at Regionals. Captain Brian
Cameros said he was happy with
the team's performance.
"It feels good," he added. "Two
years ago, I watched helplessly
from the sidelines. There was noth

ing I could do about it. Now we've
been able to get rid of the curse and
show that we won't crumble when
the pressure comes.
"In the coming weeks, we're
going to work on conditioning,
because nationals is a three-day
tournament," Cameros said.
"We're going to work on our zone
offense and defense, which was
instrumental in our victory at
regionals."
To counter the zone defenses of
top-ranked East Carolina Universi
ty and Carleton College, the team
should "just throw the upside
down," business student Volker
"Thor" Schmidt said.
Confident in its abilities, Team
Bloodthirsty plans on sucking the
competition dry at nationals, which
will be held in Louisiana at the end

of May.
"Let's just say, I've already
bought my tickets to Orlando,"
graduate student Andrei "MaGilla"
Straumanis said, hinting at the tra
ditional vacation spot of champi
ons.
Also, at Western Regionals, the
women's team made an amazing
comeback in the second day against
Humboldt State to challenge UCSC
for the second berth at nationals.
The women narrowly lost and
placed third overall in the tourna
ment.
Although the Stanford Men's B-
Team went 0-5 on the first day of
tournament play, they had nation
als-bound Las Positas College on
the ropes with a score of 7-7 at one
point in the game before losing 10-
