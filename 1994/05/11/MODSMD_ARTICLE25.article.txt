# Olmstead keys 8-1 Cardinal win with four hits
## Senior has career day in last regular-season home game 
### Andy Eiser Senior staff writer 
Jason Middlebrook's no-hitter Sunday
overshadowed Senior Day for the Cardi
nal baseball team, so the only fourth-year
Stanford regular made yesterday's home
finale his own.
Designated hitter Nate Olmstead

enjoyed a perfect 4-for
-4 afternoon at the
plate as the No. 12
Cardinal downed his
hometown UC-Davis
Aggies 8-1 in what may
have been Olmstead's
last game at Sunken
Diamond.
"I woke up this

morning thinking this was the last game I
would play here," said Olmstead, who
attended Davis High School and trained
last summer with several UC-Davis play
ers. "I've spent a lot of time on this field
and learned a lot. It's sentimental for me,
so it was nice to have success today."
The Aggies (39-10) pushed across the
game's first run in the top of the second
inning, when junior rightfielder Hayward
Cook doubled and scored on a passed ball,
but Olmstead's first success helped Stan
ford (35-20) assert control in the bottom
of the frame.
Singling off the foot of UC-Davis junior
starter Tim Stine (3-1) to lead off the
inning, Olmstead came around on a dou
ble by junior leftfielder Steve Carver that
narrowly missed clearing the right-cen
terfield fence.
"I saw the ball go straight up and
thought it might have hit a branch," said
Carver, referring to the trees lining the
stadium. "I guess it hit the very top of the
fence at an angle, because the umpire said
it was one inch away from going out."
Carver would score the go-ahead run
anyway, as sophomore rightfielder Brodie
VanWagenen singled Carver to third and
freshman shortstop Eric Sees laid a per-

feet bunt down the third-base line that
stayed fair for an RBI single.
Sophomore centerfielder Cale Carter
then landed a bloop single to right over a
drawn-in infield to give the Cardinal a 3-
1 advantage.
Olmstead knocked his second single to
right field in the third inning, but Stan
ford did not add to its lead until the fifth,

when the Cardinal
hung three more
runs on the score
board. With one out,
sophomore third
baseman Brian Dal
limore singled up the
. middle. Junior sec
ond baseman Jed
Hansen followed

with a single to left, and both runners
advanced on a Stine wild pitch.
Sophomore catcher A.J. Hinch then
plated Dallimore with a sharp grounder
to Aggies senior third baseman John
Dietz, who misplayed a potential inning
ending double play and would have picked
up an error but caught Hansen scurrying
back to second base.
Olmstead made UC-Davis pay for its
mistake, unloading his fifth home run of
the year over the trees in left-centerfield
to make it 6-1 Stanford.
"It was a fastball up, and I knew it was
out of the park when I hit it," Olmstead
said.
Olmstead exited the game in the
eighth, giving way to pinch runner Sean
Flikke after doubling to the deepest part
of center field off Aggies sophomore
reliever Bill Brelsford.
Cardinal junior first baseman Dusty
Allen drove Flikke home with a single to
left, and, after UC-Davis brought in
junior Mike Mastagni to take the bat out
of Carver's hands, advanced to second on
a wild pitch and scored Stanford's final
run on a pinch-hit single by sophomore

day's win. Carter went one for three with an RBI.
