# How the poll was conducted
## 
### 
This Stanford Daily poll was
based on telephone interviews
with 338 Stanford undergradu
ates and graduate students.
Respondents were chosen at
random from The Stanford
Directory. The poll was con
ducted by paid interviewers
between the hours of 6 p.m.
and 10 p.m. on May 2 through
May 5 and May 8.
For the questions on the
budget-cutting process and
University President Gerhard
Casper and Provost Condoleez
za Rice's approval ratings, all
students were surveyed.
Questions on the grading

policy were not asked of stu
dents in the Schools of Law,
Business and Medicine. The
Law and Business schools do
not use the University-wide
grading system, and the Medi
cal School uses it for only some
students. A total of 301 stu
dents responded to those ques
tions.
All of the questions have a
margin of error of 5.7 percent
at a 95 percent level of confi
dence. In other words, in 19
cases out of 20, the results of
this sample will differ by no
more than 5.7 percentage
points in either direction from

the answers that would have
been obtained by polling all
Stanford students.
A difference between two
results is statistically signifi
cant only if it is greater than
twice the margin of error.
In other words, if 54 percent
of the respondents answered
"yes" on a given question and
46 percent answered "no," the
difference is not statistically
significant. This is because,
with a 5 percent margin of
error, the "yes" answer could be
as low as 49 percent in the over
all population and the "no"
answer as high as 51 percent.
