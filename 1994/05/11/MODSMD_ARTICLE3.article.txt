# Low marks for new grade plan
## 64% of students oppose 'W,' 63% want drop deadline as is 
### Miranda Doyle Editorial staff 
A majority of Stanford students
favor reinstating the failing grade
but object to faculty proposals for
a third-week drop deadline and the
new "withdraw" notation, accord
ing to a poll conducted by The
Daily.
Graduate students are much
more likely to support a grading
crackdown, strongly endorsing
the "Not Passed" — which would
take the place of the F under the
changes proposed by a Faculty
Senate committee on grading —
while undergraduates oppose the
"NP" by a slim margin. Approxi
mately 300 students were inter
viewed last week for the poll,
which has a 5.7 percent margin of
error.
While 67 percent of graduate
students support the addition of
the failing grade, 48 percent of un
dergraduates oppose it. Eighty
percent of undergraduates and 45
percent of graduates believe Stan

ford should continue to allow stu
dents to drop classes up to the final
without any permanent record.
The Faculty Senate will vote on
a proposal to modify the grading
policy and add/drop deadlines May
26.
Under the plan, an "NP" or an
"NC" will be recorded on tran
scripts for failing grades. Current
ly, failing grades are not recorded
on transcripts.
The plan would also move drop
and add deadlines up to the third
week, and students who withdraw
from classes between the fourth
and eighth week of the quarter
would receive a "W" notation on
their transcript. Under the plan,
the pass/no credit deadline would
be moved from the third to the
sixth week, and a stricter policy for
retaking classes would be en
forced.
Just 17 percent of the students
polled favored switching the drop
deadline, and 63 percent said it

should remain where it is. Almost
half wanted the add deadline to
remain at the seventh week, with
27 percent supporting the pro
posed change.
Three in four undergraduates
opposed the "W" notation, but
only half of all graduate students
felt the same way. Overall, 64
percent disagreed with the nota
tion, 26 percent agreed and the
remainder had no opinion.
In addition to the failing grade,
the proposal to move the P/NC
deadline to the sixth week was the
only one to draw support from
students. More than half of those
polled said they would like to see
the change, while one in four pre
ferred leaving the deadline at the
third week.
Currently, students can peti
tion to replace an old grade with a

new one if they retake a class.
Under the proposed poliey, both
grades would appear on the tran
script unless a student had
received lower than a C-. In that
case, the new grade would replace
the old one but an asterisk would
indicate that the class had been
taken twice.
The plurality of students — 42
percent — said the retake policy
should remain the same. Another
36 percent supported the plan
before the senate, while the rest
said they would like to see the
policy change but not as pro
posed.
If senate members approve the
new policy, 36 percent of the
respondents said the new drop
deadline will have the greatest
effect on students.
The failing grade was ranked
next in importance, followed by
the retake policy and the "W"
notation.
Seventy-two percent of those
polled characterized themselves

as "somewhat familiar" with the
proposed grading changes, while
14 percent were "very familiar"
and 21 percent said they were
"not familiar." Graduate stu
dents were more likely to say they
were not familiar with the pro
posals.
The results of the student poll
differ markedly from a faculty
survey conducted last year by the
committee that formulated the
proposal before the senate. That
poll found that faculty strongly
prefer a more "historical" tran
script and a full 76 percent favor
the failing grade.
Stanford's student population
is evenly divided between gradu
ates and undergraduates. Of the
students surveyed, 47 percent
were graduate students and 53
percent were undergraduates.
Students from the schools of Law,
Business and Medicine were not
asked about the grading policy
because it will not affect their
schools.
