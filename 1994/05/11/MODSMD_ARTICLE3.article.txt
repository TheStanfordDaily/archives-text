# Low marks for new grade plan
## 64% of students oppose 'W,' 63% want drop deadline as is 
### Miranda Doyle Editorial staff 
A majority of Stanford students
favor reinstating the failing grade
but object to faculty proposals for
a third-week drop deadline and the
new "withdraw" notation, accord
ing to a poll conducted by The
Daily.
Graduate students are much
more likely to support a grading
crackdown, strongly endorsing
the "Not Passed" — which would
take the place of the F under the
changes proposed by a Faculty
Senate committee on grading —
while undergraduates oppose the
"NP" by a slim margin. Approxi
mately 300 students were inter
viewed last week for the poll,
which has a 5.7 percent margin of
error.
While 67 percent of graduate
students support the addition of
the failing grade, 48 percent of un
dergraduates oppose it. Eighty
percent of undergraduates and 45
percent of graduates believe Stan

ford should continue to allow stu
dents to drop classes up to the final
without any permanent record.
The Faculty Senate will vote on
a proposal to modify the grading
policy and add/drop deadlines May
26.
Under the plan, an "NP" or an
"NC" will be recorded on tran
scripts for failing grades. Current
ly, failing grades are not recorded
on transcripts.
The plan would also move drop
and add deadlines up to the third
week, and students who withdraw
from classes between the fourth
and eighth week of the quarter
would receive a "W" notation on
their transcript. Under the plan,
the pass/no credit deadline would
be moved from the third to the
sixth week, and a stricter policy for
retaking classes would be en
forced.
Just 17 percent of the students
polled favored switching the drop
deadline, and 63 percent said it
