# Students wary of budget cut process
## 
### Miranda Doyle Editorial staff 
Almost half of all students dis
approve of the way Stanford's
budget-cutting process has been
conducted this year, and 50 per
cent believe student input has not
been adequately considered.
In a telephone survey of 338
undergraduate and graduate stu
dents conducted last week by The
Daily, 47 percent expressed dis
pleasure over the budget process
— a University effort to trim $18
million to $20 million from the
operating budget over three
years. The poll has a 5.7 percent
margin of error.

47 percent of stu
dents expressed dis
pleasure over the
recent budget-cutting
process.

Asked whether they approved
or disapproved of the way Univer
sity President Gerhard Casper
and Provost Condoleezza Rice are
handling their jobs, most stu
dents had no opinion.
Twenty percent gave Casper
negative reviews, while 31 per
cent approved of his performance.
The number disapproving has
almost doubled from 11 percent
last June, when a poll of 403 stu
dents found that almost half
thought he was doing well.
One in five students believes
Rice is performing well, according

to last week's poll, with an equal
number disapproving and 60 per
cent saying they have no opinion.
Graduate students were more
likely to believe the budget-cut
ting process has been a good one,
with 38 percent disapproving.
Among undergraduates, that
number reached 58 percent.
Twenty-nine percent of all stu
dents had no opinion on the pro
cess.
Roughly one in four students
said student input had received
enough consideration during the
debate over what to cut, and 24
percent had no opinion.
Many student leaders have

expressed frustration this year
over a perceived lack of concern
for student opinion on the part of
the University's administration.
During the last budget-cutting
process, when $43 million was
sliced from the operating budget
two years ago, there was more
consultation with students, facul
ty and staff.
But Rice, the University's
chief budget officer, has said this
year that it is unreasonable to
undergo such a lengthy process
every time spending must be
reduced, especially when the
magnitude of the cuts is much
smaller.
