# Casper discusses protest at Senate
## ASSU condemns remarks at Flicks 
### Jim Luh Staff writer 
Issues raised during last week's
protest by Chicano students in the
Quad permeated hist night's ASSU
Senate meeting, from remarks by
University President Gerhard
Casper to a resolution condemning
some students' behavior at the May
1 Flicks.
Casper made his quarterly visit
to the senate and entertained ques
tions from senators on a range of
topics, many of which dealt with
how the University will address
concerns of the campus ethnic com
munities.
Graduate senator Sanford Dick
er! asked Casper whether the ad
ministration will adhere to recom
mendations that will eventually be
made by the committees estab
lished to examine the protesters'
demands — including a campus
wide boycott on grapes, the estab
lishment of a Chicano Studies pro
gram, and the creation of a commu
nity center in East Palo Alto.
Casper immediately reiterated
the position he has previously ex
pressed — that on issues like Asian-
American and Chicano Studies, the

president has little authority.
"Over some of these matters,"
such as Chicano Studies, "the au
thority initially lies ... with the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences," Casper said.
Casper said the administration
*11 • J x\

will consider the
committees' rec
ommendations
"as they come for
ward."
But he hesitat
ed to promise that
the committees'
recommenda
tions will be fol
lowed. "I cannot

possibly guarantee a particular
outcome if I don't even know what
the recommendation is," Casper
said.
Casper said one major obstacle
to establishing such programs is in
corporating specialized areas of
study, such as Asian-American and
Chicano Studies, into the larger
framework of undergraduate edu
cation.
"How do we come out of the cul
ture of niches?" Casper lamented.
