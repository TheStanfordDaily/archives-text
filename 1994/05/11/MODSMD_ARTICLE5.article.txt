# Casper discusses protest at Senate
## ASSU condemns remarks at Flicks 
### Jim Luh Staff writer 
Issues raised during last week's
protest by Chicano students in the
Quad permeated hist night's ASSU
Senate meeting, from remarks by
University President Gerhard
Casper to a resolution condemning
some students' behavior at the May
1 Flicks.
Casper made his quarterly visit
to the senate and entertained ques
tions from senators on a range of
topics, many of which dealt with
how the University will address
concerns of the campus ethnic com
munities.
Graduate senator Sanford Dick
er! asked Casper whether the ad
ministration will adhere to recom
mendations that will eventually be
made by the committees estab
lished to examine the protesters'
demands — including a campus
wide boycott on grapes, the estab
lishment of a Chicano Studies pro
gram, and the creation of a commu
nity center in East Palo Alto.
Casper immediately reiterated
the position he has previously ex
pressed — that on issues like Asian-
American and Chicano Studies, the

president has little authority.
"Over some of these matters,"
such as Chicano Studies, "the au
thority initially lies ... with the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences," Casper said.
Casper said the administration
*11 • J x\

will consider the
committees' rec
ommendations
"as they come for
ward."
But he hesitat
ed to promise that
the committees'
recommenda
tions will be fol
lowed. "I cannot

possibly guarantee a particular
outcome if I don't even know what
the recommendation is," Casper
said.
Casper said one major obstacle
to establishing such programs is in
corporating specialized areas of
study, such as Asian-American and
Chicano Studies, into the larger
framework of undergraduate edu
cation.
"How do we come out of the cul
ture of niches?" Casper lamented.


t Casper
He said that while he might favor a
course encompassing "all the
warts and all the positive aspects"
of American history and civiliza
tion, neither faculty nor students
would be eager to add to existing
academic requirements.
Graduate senator Nawwar Kas
rawi asked Casper whether the
administration would take any ini
tiatives to increase student
involvement in University deci
sions.
"My hope is ... that we can
build a steady interaction between
the Council of Presidents ... and
the administration," Casper said.
"This will also involve the senate
chair and ... the senate."
Casper expressed concern that
students are too quick to question
decision-making processes when
they disagree with the decisions
that they produce. "We as a coun
try have started .. . reconceptual
izing all issues into process issues,"
Casper said.
Casper also questioned tactics
students have adopted in resolving
differences, citing a challenge

issued by a student in a recent
Daily column for the administra
tion to justify the current Univer
sity endowment payout rate.
"I will say very strongly and
very emphatically that Stanford
.. . cannot survive on the politics of
ultimatum," Casper said. "That is
not a way to run anything, let
alone a university."
Later in the meeting, the senate
passed a resolution condemning
the behavior of students who
jeered at a showing of the docu
mentaiy "No Grapes" at Flicks last
week.
The resolution stated that "the
shouting of racial slurs such as 'go
home beaners' is reprehensible
and offensive conduct in the eyes of
the Student Senate. We believe
that no person should be subjected
to this type of assault and we con
demn such behavior."
Undergraduate senator Peter
Cousins made a motion to append
an amendment to the bill that
would have stated that the ASSU
must provide equal time to oppos
ing views when it allows discussion
of political issues.
Cousins' proposal was based on
a belief that students might con
strue the film's showing at Flicks
as ASSU endorsement of the polit

ical stance taken by the film's pro
ducers, and a provision in the
ASSU Constitution prohibits the
ASSU from purporting to repre
sent the student body "on matters
not directly affecting Stanford stu
dents." The definition requires
that students be affected by those
matters solely by virtue of being
students at Stanford.
While some senators agreed
with Cousins' sentiments, he
gained little support in adding the
amendment to the bill.
Graduate senator Chris Hoff
man, one of the resolution's co
authors, expressed concern that
attaching Cousins' amendment
might serve to rationalize the
behavior the resolution con
demned.
In the end, the amendment
failed and the original bill passed
by a wide margin, with only
Cousins voting no. In a rare break
with procedure, senate chair Greg
Waldorf, who ordinarily does not
exercise his right to vote, voted yes.
Cousins said his opposition to
the resolution was based solely on
the constitutional concerns that
would have been addressed in his
amendment. Cousins said he will
introduce a separate resolution
that will deal with those concerns.

involvement in University deci
sions.
"My hope is ... that we can
build a steady interaction between
the Council of Presidents ... and
the administration," Casper said.
"This will also involve the senate
chair and ... the senate."
Casper expressed concern that
students are too quick to question
decision-making processes when
they disagree with the decisions
that they produce. "We as a coun
try have started .. . reconceptual
izing all issues into process issues,"
Casper said.
Casper also questioned tactics
students have adopted in resolving
differences, citing a challenge

issued by a student in a recent
Daily column for the administra
tion to justify the current Univer
sity endowment payout rate.
"I will say very strongly and
very emphatically that Stanford
.. . cannot survive on the politics of
ultimatum," Casper said. "That is
not a way to run anything, let
alone a university."
Later in the meeting, the senate
passed a resolution condemning
the behavior of students who
jeered at a showing of the docu
mentaiy "No Grapes" at Flicks last
week.
The resolution stated that "the
shouting of racial slurs such as 'go
home beaners' is reprehensible
and offensive conduct in the eyes of
the Student Senate. We believe
that no person should be subjected
to this type of assault and we con
demn such behavior."
Undergraduate senator Peter
Cousins made a motion to append
an amendment to the bill that
would have stated that the ASSU
must provide equal time to oppos
ing views when it allows discussion
of political issues.
Cousins' proposal was based on
a belief that students might con
strue the film's showing at Flicks
as ASSU endorsement of the polit

ical stance taken by the film's pro
ducers, and a provision in the
ASSU Constitution prohibits the
ASSU from purporting to repre
sent the student body "on matters
not directly affecting Stanford stu
dents." The definition requires
that students be affected by those
matters solely by virtue of being
students at Stanford.
While some senators agreed
with Cousins' sentiments, he
gained little support in adding the
amendment to the bill.
Graduate senator Chris Hoff
man, one of the resolution's co
authors, expressed concern that
attaching Cousins' amendment
might serve to rationalize the
behavior the resolution con
demned.
In the end, the amendment
failed and the original bill passed
by a wide margin, with only
Cousins voting no. In a rare break
with procedure, senate chair Greg
Waldorf, who ordinarily does not
exercise his right to vote, voted yes.
Cousins said his opposition to
the resolution was based solely on
the constitutional concerns that
would have been addressed in his
amendment. Cousins said he will
introduce a separate resolution
that will deal with those concerns.
