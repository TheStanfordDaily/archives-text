# Hazardous fines
## Settlement with state for possible hazardous waste violations could cost Stanford $1M 
### Megan Himan Stuff writer 
A University official admitted yesterday
that Stanford could pay up to "seven digits"
as part of a settlement with the state for pos
sible hazardous waste violations.
Materials Science and Engineering Prof.
John Bravman, chair of the University
Committee on Health and Safety, an
nounced that the fine would be a part of the
settlement with the Department of Toxic
Substances Control (DTSC). The an
nouncement was made at an open commit
tee meeting last night in Tresidder Union.
Negotiations with the DTSC center not
only on the size of the fine, but also include
an agreement modifying interpretations of
existing toxic wjiste laws as they apply to
Stanford, Bravman said.
"The citations stem from taking legisla
tion made for industrial-level waste and ap
plying it to research institutions," Bravman
said.
Bravman described Stanford's situation
as very different from that of large indus
tries. "Stanford is a research environment
with a small quantity of a large number of
toxic wastes," he said.

He said he hopes to finalize an agreement
with the DTSC within a month, which
would include "excruciating detail" outlin
ing interpretations of the existing toxic
waste legislation that currently regulates
large industries. Bravman declined to com
ment on the details of the potential agree
ment due to legal reasons.
Larry Gibbs, associate vice president of
Environmental Health and Safety, said that
the state inspections focused on events dur
ing and prior to March 1992.
Subsequently, the University has made
changes in response to citations, (libbs said,
including the addition of a new program
waste manager to ensure proper documen
tation of waste inspections. He also said that
more emphasis will be put on training all
employees who handle toxic waste.
Allegations of toxic waste violations, as
well as the first reports of a possible million
dollar fine for Stanford, were reported by
the San Jose Mercury News Feb. 13.
The story included a quote from a state
department official from the Environmen
tal Protection Agency, Allan Hirsch, who
said that the allegations against Stanford
were a "major, major case. Maybe
onee a year or once every several
years we'll deal with a case of this
magnitude."
Bravman yesterday called the
article "sensationalist," claiming it
dealt with old news that included
statements from employees who
no longer work at Stanford.
Members of the community
also voiced concerns at last night's
meeting about the amount of toxic
waste generated by Stanford and
the effectiveness of the Universi
ty's oversight of the waste disposal.
One Menlo Park resident said
that he knew of people who were
allegedly sick because of toxic
waste, but were afraid to talk
because of possible repercussions.

Bravman forcefully denied
accusations that Stanford was
doing anything illegal or trying to
harm the community. "We have
absolutely nothing to hide. People
see a large research institution and
assume that something wrong is
going on there," he said.
Although educating the com
munity about the disposal of toxic
waste at Stanford is not part of the
committee's duties as outlined by
University President Gerhard
Casper, Bravman said he believes
that it would be appropriate.
"I believe that people are fearful
in their ignorance, and we seek
understanding," Bravman said.
Residents expressed specific
concern about sightings of black
smoke coming from a medical
waste incinerator on Oak Road.
John Holmes, assistant director
of Environmental Health and
Radiation Safety, said the "excur
sions" of black smoke do not show

a change in the amount of radia
tion, but rather in the amount of
carbon contained in the smoke.
He said that if these excursions
occur for more than three minutes
per month, it is reported to the
oversight agency which would
come inspect the incinerator.
In addition, the use of the incin
erator soon will be reduced, Gibbs
said. New technology reducing
waste would allow the incinerator
to be used only one day per month,
as opposed to the 25 days per
month it is currently used. The
University announced plans for
the cutback in the incinerator's
operations last month.
"The one day a month would
maintain the viability of the equip
ment," Gibbs said, adding that,
"We are not looking to close the
incinerator down completely
because there are certain waste
streams for which there is no alter
native."
