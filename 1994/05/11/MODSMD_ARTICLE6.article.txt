## Settlement with state for possible hazardous waste violations could cost Stanford $1M 
### Megan Himan Stuff writer 
A University official admitted yesterday
that Stanford could pay up to "seven digits"
as part of a settlement with the state for pos
sible hazardous waste violations.
Materials Science and Engineering Prof.
John Bravman, chair of the University
Committee on Health and Safety, an
nounced that the fine would be a part of the
settlement with the Department of Toxic
Substances Control (DTSC). The an
nouncement was made at an open commit
tee meeting last night in Tresidder Union.
Negotiations with the DTSC center not
only on the size of the fine, but also include
an agreement modifying interpretations of
existing toxic wjiste laws as they apply to
Stanford, Bravman said.
"The citations stem from taking legisla
tion made for industrial-level waste and ap
plying it to research institutions," Bravman
said.
Bravman described Stanford's situation
as very different from that of large indus
tries. "Stanford is a research environment
with a small quantity of a large number of
toxic wastes," he said.

He said he hopes to finalize an agreement
with the DTSC within a month, which
would include "excruciating detail" outlin
ing interpretations of the existing toxic
waste legislation that currently regulates
large industries. Bravman declined to com
ment on the details of the potential agree
ment due to legal reasons.
Larry Gibbs, associate vice president of
Environmental Health and Safety, said that
the state inspections focused on events dur
ing and prior to March 1992.
Subsequently, the University has made
changes in response to citations, (libbs said,
including the addition of a new program
waste manager to ensure proper documen
tation of waste inspections. He also said that
more emphasis will be put on training all
employees who handle toxic waste.
Allegations of toxic waste violations, as
well as the first reports of a possible million
dollar fine for Stanford, were reported by
the San Jose Mercury News Feb. 13.
The story included a quote from a state
department official from the Environmen
tal Protection Agency, Allan Hirsch, who
said that the allegations against Stanford
