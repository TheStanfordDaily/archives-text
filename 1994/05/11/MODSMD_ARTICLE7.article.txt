# Students film their own romantic comedy
## 
### Nina Wasow 
It's not everyday that a janitor is pos
sessed by a Tibetan monk in order to
carry out a mission of death and destruc
tion. And it's not everyday that a roman
tic comedy movie is filmed at Stanford.
Yet two Stanford students have man
aged to accomplish both of these by film
ing their new movie "Sequel*."
"That's sequel with an asterisk," says
sophomore John Salcido, the brain be
hind the production, which is almost fin
ished filming.
"It's an early Woody Allen tyjH> thing,"
said Salcido, adding that he had also been
influenced by Indiana Jones movies.
The main character is a movie-ob
sessed man named Alex, who is in love
with a Tibetan woman named Ilsa. But
when Uma, a minor character, shatters
an urn belonging to Ilsa that contains the
ashes of a Tibetan monk, all hell breaks
loose.
The plot becomes riddled with sub
plots. "Ilsa calls forth the spirit of the
monk to posses someone who will kill the
person who broke the pot," said junior
Neil Evans, who is co-directing the film
with Salcido. "So a janitor is possessed.
Hut Ilsa thinks that Alex is possessed, by
a miraculous coincidence."
Specifically, this twist of fate occurs
when another woman named Mel, who is

infatuated wit h Alex, sends him a love let
ter which he thinks is from Ilsa.
"He comes up and says, 'I got your
message,' just as she finishes calling on
the monk," said Evans, who is undeclared
but plans to major in studio art and pho
tography. Ilsa assumes Alex's appearance

to be a sign that he has been overcome by
the monk's spirit, he said.
So where did the inspiration for this
flick come from? "No single idea," said
Salcido, a creative writing major. "A

brochure about Tibet is where I
got the Tibetan references."
And as with all good writers,
embellished versions of some of Sal
cido's personal experiences made
their way into the story. "I got in
janitor's clothing and trounced
around the woods," he said, quite
seriously.
The actors are all students and
were cast by Evans and Salcido.
Playing the characters of Alex and
Ilsa are freshmen Jeremy Desmon
and Tina Goette.
"There is a lot of deep stuff in it,
if you care to look," said Goette.
"It's been really fun. I'm the evil
woman who the hero falls in love
with, but I get kind of left in the
dust. My two emotions are basically
confused and angry, which I play to
varying degrees," she said.
Mel is portrayed by sophomore
Katie Chandler, and Uma by recent
graduate Stephanie Allen. Sopho
more Darren Sedy is cast as Alex's
sidekick, Gordon, and sophomore
Cruz DeWilde as the possessed jani
tor.

And finally, in the role of "a multi
planar messiah" is senior Eric Smith.
"He's God, but also a gas station
attendant. He sort of makes every
thing happen at the end," said Evans.
Evans coyly neglected to give
explicit details about the movie's
outcome, hinting only that "it ends
in a comical, stereotypical Holly
wood way, where everyone gets a
girl and all that."
The movie is being filmed for the
most part at Stanford, since the
story is set on a college campus,
with scenes in the desert and in the
forest. "We tried not to let too much
of Stanford seep into it," Goette
said.
Salcido and Evans began their
filmmaking careers last year, with a
short movie called "Quakers Under
my Bed" which they filmed as a
dorm project.
"It was a sort of strange — as
you might imagine — horror come
dy about killer Quakers who go
around murdering innocent college
students," said Salcido.
Shooting for Sequel* began Feb.
5 and will be completed May 29. Sal
cido said that he expects the 80 to 85
minute film to be shown in early or
mid October in either Kresge Audi
torium or Memorial Auditorium.
