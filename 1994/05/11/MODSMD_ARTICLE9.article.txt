# Students attack grade plan
## 'W,' drop deadline changes draw fire at Roble meeting 
### Beth Berselli Staff writer 
In a tense meeting at Roble lounge last night,
about 60 students voiced their criticisms of the
proposed grading policy changes, specifically
focusing their disapproval on plans to move the
drop deadline to the third week of the quarter.
The meeting was held by the Faculty Senate's
Committee on Academic Appraisal and Achieve
ment to "listen to students' concerns and sugges
tions about the proposed changes," said Geology
Prof. Gail Mahood, the chair of the committee.
The proposed changes include moving the
add/drop deadline to the third week, bringing back
the failing grade and marking courses dropped
between the fourth and eighth weeks with a with
draw notation on the transcript. The proposal also
would alter the policy on retaking classes. The sen
ate will vote on the proposed changes on May 26.
But judging by the comments during last night's
two-hour meeting, many students appear to disap
prove of almost every provision of the proposal.
"You can't gauge how you're doing in a class in
just three weeks," one student said about the pro
posal to move the drop deadline. "In the first three
weeks of class I don't have an inkling about
whether or not I could actually do the class."
"Students have the right to drop a course with
out being penalized," another student said.
One student said the proposed deadline is
unreasonable because "people don't have enough
information about how the course will be evaluated
before the three-week drop deadline."
Some students advocated moving the deadline
until after the course's midterm examination, or
about the sixth week.
Freshman Rachel Mears said the absence of an
effective advising system is a problem that must be
dealt with before changing the deadline. "Because
the advising system here is inadequate you need to
move the drop deadline to the sixth week," she
said.
Students also criticized the proposed "W" nota
tion on the transcript for classes dropped between
the fourth and eighth weeks of the quarter.
But Mahood defended the proposed, saying the
withdraw option will allow students to drop a class,
but will discourage students from doing it regular
ly. "What I really need is concrete suggestions
about how you want things changed, not just hor
ror stories," she said.
The possibility of an "internal W" was suggest
ed by Mahood. This option would function similar
to how the "no credit" currently works, recording
all withdraws on an "unofficial" transcript but not
on the external transcript sent to graduate schools
and employers.
Many students reacted positively to the poten
tial modification to the committee's proposal, and
Mahood said the committee will consider that sug

gestions as well as others.
In response to the possible "return of the F,"
one student said bringing back the failing grade
will "have a bad effect on the academic atmosphere
at Stanford." Another speculated that it would
"dissuade students from exploring subjects they
may be interested in but not necessarily skilled in."
"We don't want to stop exploration but we want
to stop people from dropping a class simply because
they're doing poorly," Mahood said.
Several students said that changing the grading
policies for already enrolled students is unfair. "I
came to Stanford under one set of rules and now
you're going to change it," one student said.
One student suggested not implementing the
changes until the Class of '99 enters.
Mahood began the meeting by explaining the
committee's process and proposals.
"What we were trying to do with our proposals
was encourage sensible use of academic resources,
meaning faculty and student time and dollars,"
Mahood said.
Stressing that the proposals do not address the
problem of grade inflation, Mahood said the com
mittee looked at ways to change grading policies in
order to make transcripts more "historical."
"There's a feeling that our transcript is not
highly valued anymore," said Religious Studies
Prof. Van Harvey, a committee member. He added
that an A- is the average grade in the School of
Humanities and Sciences.
Newly elected ASSU Council of Presidents
member Anietie Ekanem disagreed. "I have never
heard an employer say, 'We can't take a Stanford
student. You're not qualified,' " Ekanem said,
adding that he wanted to see statistical data to sup
port the claim.
"The Stanford transcript is unique in that
everyone knows that perhaps a lot of information is
not reflected on it," University Registrar Roger
Printup said. "The problem is that the good stu
dents are being negatively impacted because
there's the suspicion that something else may be
there."
Several people said that student input was not
adequately considered. "One month of student con
tact is not enough," one student said.
"To say that students had no input is wrong.
Three members on the committee of nine people
were students," Harvey disagreed.
Other students asked why the committee
didn't poll students. A previous poll had been
done, indicating that "three-quarters of all stu
dents wanted to maintain the current status
quo," Mahood said.
The committee will continue accepting student
input until the senate vote on May 26, Mahood
said. She encouraged students to either contact her
directly by electronic mail or contact members of
the ASSU Student Affairs Committee, who may
meet with the committee on May 17.
