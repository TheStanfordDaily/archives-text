# Review files complaint against RF
## 
### Burt Herman Editorial staff 
The Stanford Review filed a complaint with the
Judicial Affairs Office yesterday claiming that Casa
Zapata Resident Fellow Tony Burciaga violated the
First Amendment when he stopped staff members
from placing copies of the publication under student
doors Monday evening.
Police were eventually called to mediate the dis
pute, which was sparked by a misunderstanding over
the house's flier-free policy. During the argument
Burciaga also placed a stack of Reviews in a recycling
bin and told the staff members to leave the dorm
without informing them of Zapata's rules.
The Judicial Affairs Office had not received the Re
view's complaint at the close of business yesterday,
said Judicial Affairs Officer Sally Cole, adding that
the office is not the proper place to address concerns of
this nature. "It wouldn't be my jurisdiction," she said.
According to Dean of Students Michael Jackson,
"the Judicial Affairs Office focuses solely on student
conduct or misconduct."
Nor would Burciaga necessarily fall under Univer
sity employee conduct policies. Burciaga is not a Uni
versity employee and receives no monetary compen
sation from the University for his position, said Ann
Porteus, acting co-director of Residential Education.
Burciaga is accorded RF status because his wife
Cecilia is employed by the University, she said. "Any
body who is in the system as an RF is expected to fol
low the RF job description," Porteus said. "We don't
make a distinction between RF and non-RF in a prac
tical way."
However, the University does not recognize a non-
Stanford employee as such, she added.
Neither Porteus nor Vice Provost for Student Af
fairs Mary Edmonds can remember a previous case
where action has been brought against a non-Univer
sity employed RF spouse, but both said they would
have to review the complaint before being able to de
termine where the matter should be directed.
The Review's complaint alleges that Burciaga
"willfully and violently violated the First Amend
ment rights of The Stanford Review." Burciaga also
is alleged to have "violated the property rights of the
students commissioned to distribute the paper," ac-
