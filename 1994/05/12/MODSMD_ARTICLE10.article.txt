Rensburg defended the African
National Congress' Reconstruc
tion and Development Pro
gramme during a campus address
yesterday evening, depicting it as
a project oriented toward the
nation's people.
Speaking to a gathering of
about 10 people in Ujamaa, Rens
burg emphasized that the current
"transitional phase" in South
Africa's history will be central if
enduring change is to be secured.
Noting the "tenacity of colonial
ism," Rensburg argued that
reconstruction must extend
beyond the political sphere.
"Most of the present focus is on
broad institutional change," he
said. "There is very little informa
tion on mass movements and
what has happened in the social
sector."
Rensburg, a doctoral candidate
in education here at Stanford, has
been a member of the ANC since
1980.
Referring specifically to the
United States' inability to move
beyond the "emotional transi

tion" of the civil rights movement
in the 19605, Rensburg warned of
the potential superficiality of soci
etal change. Drawing upon this
historical recognition, he raised a
hypothetical proposition where
Nelson Mandela and the ANC had
"sold out" by focusing exclusively
on symbolic political upheaval
rather than substantive social and
economic reform.
Rensburg, however, quickly
put this proposition to rest with a
thorough discussion of the Recon
struction and Development Pro
gramme. This program, compiled
primarily by members of the ANC
and various experts, is intended to
ensure that current changes in
South Africa will indeed translate
into enduring social and economic
reforms.
Differentiating between "state
driven transition" and "civilly
driven transition," Rensburg
argued that the Reconstruction
and Development Programme will
in fact induce a "joint transition,"
deriving its power by altering
both political and civil institu
tions.
The program has set out six
central goals, Rensburg said,
through which it will secure this

joint transition.
For example, the program aims
to be a citizen-driven process,
"relying primarily on the energies
of the people."
Similarly, the program will
devote itself to the notion of
"nation building," based on vari
ous efforts to overcome the divi
sions and fragmentation caused
by apartheid.
Looking beyond the formal
goals of the ANC's proposal,
Rensburg also discussed some of
the more concrete issues sur
rounding it. For instance, a cen
tral concern involves the redistri
bution of residential land, as well
the creation of approximately one
million low-cost houses over the
next five years.
Rensburg ended by addressing
the fact that some experts have
labeled the Reconstruction and
Development Programme "a
menu without prices," seriously
questioning its feasibility. Howev
er, Rensburg argued that the pro
posal's emphasis on South
Africa's people make it the best
possible solution.
"The RDP represents the most
comprehensive and forward-look
ing plan available," he said.
