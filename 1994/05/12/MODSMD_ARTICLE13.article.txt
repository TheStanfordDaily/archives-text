## Haiti names new president

PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP)
— Flouting the international com
munity, a group of legislators
backed by the army swore in an
elderly Supreme Court justice yes
terday to replace deposed Presi
dent Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
The United States condemned
the move, intended to complete
the army's 1991 ouster of Aristide.
Thirteen senators and 30
deputies supported the appoint
ment of 80-year-old Supreme
Court Justice Emil Jonassaint to
replace Aristide, Haiti's first
democratically elected president.
Jonassaint was sworn in at the
seaside Legislative Palace with
army commander Raoul Cedras
looking on.
Most of the 27-member Senate
and 79-member Chamber of
Deputies was absent.
Speaking in English to televi
sion cameras covering the ceremo
ny, Sen. Bernard Sansaricq told
the United States to "get off our
backs."
"Let Haiti be Haiti," he said.
Washington successfully
pushed for a broadening of the

U.N. embargo against Haiti and
has not ruled out military inter
vention to drive out the country's
military rulers. The Haitian army
and its allies have killed thousands
of Haitians since toppling Aristide.
In Washington, Secretary of
State Warren Christopher said the
moves to replace Aristide "seem to
us to be invalid."
White House spokesman Dee
Dee Myers called the vote "cynical,
unconstitutional and illegal."
Aristide's government-in-exile
issued a statement in Washington
saying the inauguration was
designed by backers of his over
throw "to protect their personal
interests, further increase the suf
fering of the Haitian people and
plunge the country deeper into
chaos."
Shortly after Aristide was oust
ed, military leaders pushed
through the appointment of
another Supreme Court justice,
Joseph Nerrette, as provisional
president, but they abandoned
him in July 1992 in an unsuccess
ful attempt to placate the interna
tional community.

Last year, as part of a U.N.
agreement, the military and legis
lature formally recognized Aris
tide as president. But the army
later reneged on its promise to
relinquish power and let Aristide
return.
Haiti has been without a day
to-day leader since Premier Robert
Malval, appointed by Aristide,
resigned in December. Aristide has
declined to name a new premier
until Cedras and Lt. Col. Michel
Francois, another coup leader,
step down.
Many of the army's allies have
grown impatient with the collapse
of Haiti's central administration
and the military's enrichment of
itself through extortion and black
market enterprises.
In a brief inaugural speech,
Jonassaint said Parliament turned
to him "in search of a Haitian
solution."
"We can't go on killing each
other," he said. "We are all guilty
. .. but we alone know our own
reality, our needs. .. . Today, only
one remedy can cure the ills of
Haiti — love."
