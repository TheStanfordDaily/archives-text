ANC cabinet sworn in
PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) -
Nelson Mandela's Cabinet was sworn in
with solemn dignity yesterday, but fire
works lie ahead as he tries to mold polit
ical rivals and his estranged wife into a
government.
The potentially explosive mix of person
alities and politics could hinder Mandela's
attempt to fulfill African National
Congress promises of housing, jobs, educa
tion and health care for millions of blacks
impoverished under white rule.
On the first day of government busi
ness after his festive inauguration, Man
dela completed his 27-member Cabinet
yesterday by naming the three final minis
ters â€” Zulu nationalist leader Mango
suthu Buthelezi and two of his supporters.
Buthelezi, whose followers have fought

members of Mandela's ANC for a decade,
had threatened the legitimacy of last
month's all-race election by vowing to boy
cott it until the last minute. But his place
in the Cabinet was secured by his Inkatha
Freedom Party's third-place showing in
the poll.
In a surprise move, Winnie Mandela,
the president's estranged wife, was named
deputy minister of arts, culture, science
and technology. She did not appear at the
swearing-in, an indication of just how con
troversial her appointment was.
Mrs. Mandela rose to a post just short
of Cabinet level on the strength of support
among women and militant youths. It was
a remarkable political comeback after her
1991 conviction on kidnapping charges,
allegations of an extramarital affair and
corruption, and her separation from her
husband in 1992.
