# Supreme Court nominee expected
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Nearing the
end of a suspenseful search for a
Supreme Court nominee, President Clin
ton agonized yesterday over three final
ists: Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt,
Arkansas judge Richard Arnold and
Boston jurist Stephen Breyer.
Babbitt and Arnold were considered
Clinton's last-minute favorites, with the
possibility the choice could be Breyer if
Clinton were troubled by Republican
objections to Babbitt or questions about
Arnold's health.
Babbitt, who until recently said he
wanted to stay at Interior, made clear he
was available. "I'm ready and willing to
do my part to serve this president." How
ever, he said he had not been asked to
change jobs.
With the selection believed imminent,
Clinton reached out for last-minute
advice, making telephone calls about the

pros and cons of his candidates and the
obstacles they might face winning confir
mation.
Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., chairman
of the Judiciary Committee, said "I have
no idea" whom Clinton will select. He
said he last talked with Clinton about it
Monday and"he hadn't made up his
mind."
Sens. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, the rank
ing Republican on the Senate Judiciary
Committee, and Bob Dole, R-Kan., the
Senate minority leader, signaled Breyer
would have an easier time winning con
firmation than Babbitt or Arnold.
Sen. Howell Heflin, D-Ala., a Judicia
ry Committee member, said he'd heard
rumors the decision would come today.
"Most of the rumors are down to the
three, B, Band A" — Babbitt, Breyer
and Arnold.
Breyer, a First U.S. Circuit Court of

Appeals judge since 1980, was passed
over last year for the court after he failed
to make a strong impression on Clinton
in a face-to-face meeting.
Breyer also was embarrassed last year
by the disclosure he had failed to pay
Social Security taxes for a household
worker. He subsequently paid the taxes.
While Babbitt would give Clinton a
nominee with national political stature,
he has come under heavy fire from West
ern senators for his efforts to raise graz
ing fees on ranchers. He is regarded as
the most liberal of the three finalists.
Arnold is a renowned jurist and close
friend of Clinton, but his candidacy has
raised questions about Arkansas crony
ism as well as about his health. He has
been treated for two decades for lym
phoma, though doctors have assured the
White House his condition is not life
threatening.
