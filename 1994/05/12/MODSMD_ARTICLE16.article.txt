## Editorial Speech code on trial 
### 
University should follow
through on suit to give
a weak code some teeth

Does Stanford have a
speech code? It's a good
question to ask these days.
Technically, the Grey Interpreta
tion of the Fundamental Standard
prohibits insults based on an indi
vidual's sex, race, color, disability,
religion, sexual orientation or
national and ethnic origin. Howev
er, no one has ever been charged
with violating the Fundamental
Standard under this new interpre
tation, enacted in 1990, even
though incidents of "hate" speech
have occurred on campus.
One such incident occurred in
January 1992 at Otero House. Law
student Keith Rabois made anti-gay
remarks directed at Resident Fellow
Dennis Matthies' residence. The
incident was subsequently publi
cized by University officials. Howev
er, no University charges were ever
brought against Rabois or the stu
dents accompanying him because
Dean of Students Michael Jackson
determined that the incident did not
violate the Grey Interpretation.
Interpretation author and Law
Prof. Thomas Grey, on the other
hand, said he felt the incident was a
violation of the code but was not
prosecutable because the comments
weren't directed at a student.
The legitimacy of Stanford's
speech code becomes even more
unclear when adding in the new Cal
ifornia statute know as the Leonard
Law. The law, passed as part of the
California Education Code of 1992,
says students at private universities
have the same rights to freedom of

speech as they would off campus.
Now a lawsuit filed by several stu
dents, most affiliated with The Stan
ford Review, could test the constitu
tionality of the Grey Interpretation
and the Leonard Law. It seems that
the legitimacy of the speech may not
even be determined at Stanford but
in a courtroom far away.
But that may be the only place
that can put an end to the questions
that have surrounded the code since
it was enacted.
Although the last thing Stanford
needs is another lawsuit, the Uni
versity must take this complaint
seriously. A court ruling on the Grey
Interpretation will end questions as
to whether the code can be ade
quately enforced and whether it is
constitutional. Although no one
would wish for another incident like
the one in Otero, a legal clarification
would make it easier to decisively
charge students with violating the
Fundamental Standard.
Stanford owes it to its students,
faculty and staff to take this lawsuit
seriously. It hurts the entire Stan
ford community to have a speech
code that exists on paper, but is ques
tionable in practice.
Across the country, speech codes
at schools such as the University of
Wisconsin are being struck down by
courts for violating the First
Amendment. However, Stanford's
private-university status exempts it
from laws that apply to public insti
tutions.
Stanford could also settle the suit
out of court, which would most like
ly mean abolishing the Grey Inter
pretation. By choosing a court battle
over a settlement, though, Stanford
is showing its commitment to clari
fying this issue and to showing stu
dents that the current ambiguity
will not be tolerated.
Because the question of codifying
speech cannot be solved with silence.
