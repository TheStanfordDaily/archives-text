IT HAD to happen. No, not the protest
in the Quad; me at a total loss for what
to write on.
So why not write on the protest?
Because it's a dead media event. It's
been front-paged to death and the issues
tucked away into the safe haven of Uni
versity committees. Been there, seen it,
done that.
Protests, it seems, don't have much
effect anymore. They have become a col
lege campus staple, a required course —■
Student Rallies 101.
When the Persian Gulf War broke out,
we protested. When arts programs were
under fire, we gathered. When the budget
cuts came, we shouted. When we were fed
up with the lack of Asian and Chicano
Studies programs, we jumped up and
down. And when we didn't have a pressing
current event to address, we made rallying
a tradition with events like the annual the
Take Back the Night march.
By now the administration expects
such expressions of anger and frustration.
Rallying to surprise the University and
effect change is like trying to get protests
at the Mercury Nevada nuclear weapons
testing site on the news. It just doesn't
work.
More than three years ago I traveled to
that very site for the Greenpeace Protest
for No Test. It was quite a festival. There
were Deadheads, Rainbow Warriors and
Arlo Guthrie impersonators to the left and
right. We numbered in the thousands.
We gathered at the entrance to the site,
tie-dye glowing even more vibrantly in the

radioactive atmosphere of that little city of
sin. Someone kissed mother earth, some
one wept and wailed at the sight of our
government polluting the drinking water
of the local Shoshone tribe. Then hun
dreds joined hands, said a group prayer to
whatever almighty power you believed in,
and crossed the barbed wire line.
Most of those making the illegal trek
into the site had a spotter, someone who
kept track of how far they were able to
roam in the toxic desert before being
picked up by a speedy Military Patrol dune
buggy, and shuffled into government
issue busses heading for the nearest town
with a courtroom.
Later, those arrested would be released
and the $200 fines they faced dropped
because of the immense costs of persecut
ing the trespassers.
And for all this protest, for this power
ful statement against the government pol
icy, for this assembly en masse that out
stripped the capacity of local law enforce
ment, what press did we get? Only a cou
ple of CIA agents running around taking
pictures of us for some top secret govern
ment file.
Whether rallying at a site or on cam
pus, we are told where to draw the line
before authorities will get serious. Unfor
tunately, protests have become an antici
pated reaction to injustice, and must be
supplemented with overtly public
demands or fasts to give them a backbone.
As a community, we care about fellow
students and the programs of the Univer
sity, but if Stanford doesn't care enough in

return to do more than committee us to
death, what can we do to effect real
change?
Should we steal the University budget
rather than dig up dirt on it? Or should we
just sit tight and let the University know
how unsatisfied we are when the level of
graduating senior gifts drops to an all
time low?
Both the students and the administra
tion are out of touch. One wants a Stan
ford that cares and respects the things
which create a positive learning environ
ment. The other wants U.S. News and
World Report to rank Stanford at the top,
even if it means establishing an "NP"
grade.
If there's nothing shocking in the spec
tacle of protest, why not create a template
of a self-designed major in Chicano Stud
ies and distribute it throughout the com
munity, buy up all the California grapes in
food service and drop them on Casper's
doorstep, submit a multi-major URO
grant proposal to start an East Palo Alto
community center, or send Cecilia Burcia
ga's resume to all Ivy League universities
in the country?
There's a revolution calling, so pick up
the phone.

Mike suggests the CIA replace whatever
photos they have of him in their file with
the spiffy one above.
