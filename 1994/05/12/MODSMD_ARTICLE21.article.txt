## Burciaga explains Zapata incident, is unsure of charges 
### 
ON MONDAY AFTERNOON at
approximately 5:45 p.m., I
stepped out of our resident fellow
home into the first floor Casa Zapata res
idence. At the end of the hallway were
two or three male students shoving
newspapers under each student room.
These students were later identified as
Spanish-surnamed Jack Guerrero,
Review columnist; African-American Ed
Malone, staff writer; and White Bob Dol
bow, the business manager, who also car
ried a small 35 mm camera.
We have a Zapata house policy that no
newspapers or flyers can be shoved under
students doors. Furthermore, these Stan
ford Review students set down a pile of
over 200 newspapers at the end of the
hallway, creating a fire and safety hazard.
Zapata resident Anna Arreola did trip
over them right after they were set down.
Resident Niki Wilson came out of her
room and informed these individuals that
she did not want their newspaper. Stu
dents began to open their doors when
some of the newspapers would not slide
easily.
The Stanford Review staff members

are not the only newspaper peddlers we
have had to evict from Casa Zapata. This
weekend, Resident Assistant Luz Herrera
informed a Socialist Worker person to
stop peddling and knocking on student
doors and to leave.
The Stanford Review has always been
available in our lobby. But not for three
Reviewers to start distributing them indi
vidually under each door. Why did they do
this?
Read the editorial in their May 9 edi
tion, entitled "El Protesto Stupido," sic. I
will not dignify their editorial with a
rebuttal because it is an offensive, abhor
rent, bigoted harangue against the hunger
strikers, four women and one man who
put their lives on the line for something
they believed in.
Zapata resident David Valle was a
Stanford Review staff member who
resigned the moment he read that outra
geous editorial. It's as bad as the racist
remarks made at the May 1 showing of
"No Grapes" at Flicks. Over 25 Zapata
residents, including my wife Cecilia, wit
nessed their visit, which was intended to
harass and provoke. Cecilia informed

them of our dorm policy to allow a pile in
our lobby and give students the freedom
of choice to read their diatribe.
When I saw the pile of newspapers in
the middle of the hallway, 1 picked them
up and dumped them in our recycling
dumpster and pleaded for the three indi
viduals to leave. They were ready to climb
the stairs to the second and third floors.
I blocked their advance and they began
to take flash photographs of me. Other
residents also asked them to leave but
they refused, saying it was Stanford prop
erty and they had every right. I tried to
explain to them that we had been through
enough and Ed Malone's answer was "We
had nothing to do with your getting
fired!" Fired? Me? I have never even been
hired! They even questioned our calling
Zapata a home.
I had no other choice other than to call
the Stanford police, who succeeded in ask
ing them to step outside. The police report
was filed as a "miscellaneous distur
bance." No one was physically touched or
pushed.
In the end, they were allowed to leave a
small pile in the lobby. I'm being charged

with I don't know what as I write this let
ter, but I do not care and I have no time
to deal with these issues anymore. Like so
many here at Stanford, I have been on the
verge of tears, anger and exasperation
every day. Every time we turn around
there's a fire of cruelty against Zapata,
against MEChA, against undocumented
immigrants. Yes, it's the same thing â€” we
are related.
All ethnic students have wanted is sup
port and to see their reflections in their
Stanford curriculum and life. For intoler
ant bigots to hide under the guise of free
dom of expression is pathetic.
Bigotry comes in many colors. We are
tired, we are wounded, we are pained, but
we will fight back and I will put my dear
life on the line rather than have these
beautiful hunger strikers insulted. Ya
basta! Or to quote University President
Gerhard Casper, "Too much is too much!"
The administration's actions in regard
to the ethnic centers and my wife Cecilia's
layoff have empowered the extreme right
to express their bigotry.
