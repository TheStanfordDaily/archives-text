# What's the value of an administrator versus a ride on Palm Drive?
## 
### 
A couple of questions for the Stanford
administration and community:
1. What will be the cost of the upcom
ing renovation of Palm Drive? How
much interest would this money earn
annually as part of the endowment?
2. What is the annual salary, includ
ing benefits, of Cecilia Burciaga?
3. Do we value Burciaga's contribu
tion in education, inspiration, and lead
ership less than we value smooth, level
asphalt at our campus entrance?
