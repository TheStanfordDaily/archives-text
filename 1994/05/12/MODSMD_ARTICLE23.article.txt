## Women bound for Athens Tennis joins top 20 teams in hunt for NCAA title 
### Rob Ross Senior staff writer 
Last week's Sports Illustrated cover blares, "Is
Tennis Dying?"
If cities could talk, the answer from Athens, Ga.
would be a resounding "No!" as the town, home ol
the University of Georgia, readies itself for the
NCAA Women's Tennis National Championship,
which begins tomorrow and will run for the next
nine days.
The Cardinal is one of the 20 top teams invited to
compete for the distinction of 1994 NCAA Team
Champion at Georgia's Henry Feild Stadium and
has been a contender for each of the tournament's
13 vears.

'I want to get that ring on my fin
ger first, then worry about indi
vidual titles.'

The Cardinal squad (20-2) is seeded third after
ranking fourth in the Rolex National Rankings for
the last few weeks. This placement gives Stanford
"about as good a draw as we could do," according to
head coach Frank Brennan.
His team, which had been ranked as high as No. 1
in the preseason, will take on the winner of No. 15
Notre Dame (16-8) versus No. 18 Cal State Santa
Barbara (19-3) on Saturday after a first round bye.
Stanford defeated both of these teams, 6-0 and 9-0
respectively, earlier in the season.
A win on Saturday pits the Cardinal in a Sunday
match-up against either eighth-seed Pepperdine (17-
4) or No. 11 Indiana (20-5) in the quarterfinals, fol
lowed by a probable semi-final collision with top
seeded Texas. The defending champion Lady
Longhorns (23-0) have held down the Rolex No. 1
ranking for the last half of the season.
For the last two years Texas has booted Stanford
out of the championships, accomplishing the task
last season with a 5-2 upset in the finals. Therefore,
Brennan is pleased to be facing his team's specter in

the semifinals as opposed to the last match.
"We really lucked out (in terms of the draw),"
Brennan said. "We start out and get our feet wet,
then will go in rip-roaring in the second round.
Texas is the favorite and we'd rather play them in
the semis. That way we can go into the finals unen
cumbered with self-doubt."
Texas head coach Jeff Moore doesn't necessarily
see his team as the clear favorite, pointing to the
depth of this year's field.
"I think we have the best team, but there is so
much parody this year that (seedings and rankings)
don't matter too much," he said.
A perusal of the tournament brackets supports
Brennan's earlier statement. Regardless of the par
ody (or because of it), Stanford really did luck out
in terms of the bracketing. Until the semifinals, the
Cardinal will not play a squad seeded higher than
eighth, while Texas must face either No. 9 UCLA or
fifth-seeded Florida in the quarterfinals. The
Gators (22-5) have been ranked as high as No. 1
nationally, and these two squads are responsible
for Stanford's losses.
The bottom half of the bracket is loaded with
four teams that could reach the finals. Both No. 6
Kansas (24-3) and seventh-seeded Duke (18-4)
could make waves in this slate, but the collision will
most likely be between No. 4 California and second
ranked Georgia in the semifinals. The Bears (16-3)
are the only team to come close to victory against
Texas (losing 5-4 in Austin) and have been ranked
ahead of Stanford nationally (at No. 3) for the past
two months. But both of Cal's other two losses
have been to Stanford, which explains the fourth
S6OQ.
The Bulldogs of Georgia (23-2) have had an
impressive year, including two wins over Florida
and a National Collegiate Indoor Championship in
their impressive season. Factoring in the tourna
ment's location, both Moore and Brennan expect to
see the home-standing Bulldogs in the finals. Bren
nan is optimistic about his team's chances, despite
the home-court advantage.
"I think we can beat them and 20,000 fans," he
said.
After the team tournament concludes on Tues
day (with quarterfinals on Sunday and semifinals
on Monday), the stage is set for the crowning of the

NCAA singles and doubles champions. The singles
tournament is a 64-member draw, while the dou
bles draw consists of 32 teams. Play in both begins
next Wednesday.
While the actual brackets for these two tourna
ments have not been announced, the participants
were revealed last week. With five individual play
ers in the singles tournament, the Cardinal easily
paces the nation. No other team in the country
boasts more than three, while Stanford sends Kim
Shasby, Sandra De Silva, Katie Schlukebir, Kris
tine Kurth and top-ranked Laxmi Poruri to com
pete for the individual crown. In doubles, the only

Cardinal team to make the cut is the third-ranked
duo of Schlukebir-Poruri, while the team of Kurth-
Beth Berris is the fourth alternate.
Stanford's eyes remain on the team trophy that
has eluded Brennan's teams for the past two years.
"I want to get that ring on my finger first, then
worry about individual titles," said freshman
Schlukebir.
In a somewhat unusual move, Brennan has
shuffled his singles ladder a bit in preparation for
the team championships. The head coach moved


Senior Kristine Kurth and the rest of the No. 3 Cardinal women's squad will battle the top 20 teams in
the country for the NCAA title in Athens, Ga. over the next nine days.
