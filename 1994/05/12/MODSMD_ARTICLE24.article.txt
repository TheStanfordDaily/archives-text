# Golf to take swing at NCAA berth
## Women linksters ready to tee off against the best in Western Regionals 
### Seth Goldstein Staff writer 
The fifth-ranked Stanford
women's golf team will see action
today, tomorrow and Saturday in
Albuquerque, N.M. as it partici
pates in Western Regionals at the
University of New Mexico's South
Course. Head coach Tim Baldwin
hopes the tournament will kill two
birds with one stone.
First, and most importantly,
finishing among the top 10 teams
in the 18-team field will qualify the
Cardinal squad to play in the
NCAA Championships in Port
land, Ore. two weeks from now.
This challenge does not pose much
of a problem.
"We should do well," said junior
Jamille Jose. "We'll have no trou
ble making it to the championship.
We'd have to play well below our
abilities to miss the cut."
As senior Melinda Daniels put
it, they would all have to break
their legs. It does not seem too like

ly that Daniels, Jose, junior Amy
Lawrence, sophomore Vicky Stra
da and freshman Mhairi McKay
will all fall prey to this mishap.
Despite this confidence, Stan
ford will still have its work cut out
for it. The Cardinal's competition,
all schools from west of the Missis
sippi, consists of 12 of the top 15
teams in the nation including No. 1
Arizona State, No. 2 San Jose
State and No. 3 USC. This group
compares favorably with their
eastern rivals, who will be playing
at the Eastern Regionals in East
Lansing, Mich.
"We've tried hard all year long,"
McKay said. "We've been playing
against this same group all year
long and we just have to keep our
fingers crossed."
In addition to the team goal of
qualifying for more advanced play,
Baldwin hopes McKay will use the
contest to make fools of other Pac
-10 coaches. McKay, the sixth

ranked pluyer in the nation, was
snubbed by the committee which
selected the All Pac-10 teams.
Instead of being placed on the first
team with ASU's Wendy Ward,
Emily Klein, Tracy Cone, and
Heather Bowie, USC's Jennifer
Biehn and Arizona's Lita Lindley
as Baldwin believes she deserves,
McKay was relegated to second
team status.
"I don't understand how some
one who finished fifth at the Pac
-10 Championships ahead of half
the first-teamers and who has the
fourth lowest scoring average in
the whole Western Region could
be left off," Baldwin said.
"It may be mostly my fault.
When I left the coach's meeting
after the [the Pac-10 Champi
onships] to catch the team's flight
back to Stanford, she was fourth
in the voting. But she was thrown
to the wolves in my absence. I'm
sure she'll show them where she
belongs," he added.
While the decision angers Bald
win, the Cardinal he describes as
"the best player in the Pac-10" is
less agitated than her coach.
McKay concerns herself more
with her play than recognition, at
least for now.
"I don't know about these
things," she said. "It's not up to
me, and it's not something to get
mad about. I've just got to keep
playing well."
