# Swimming nets top recruiting classes

### Cindy Buchner 
Q: What's the recipe for making Stan
ford's men's and women's championship
swimming and diving teams better next
year?
A: Take 15 fresh recruits, put them in
deGuerre Pool, mix them several hours a day
with experienced teammates, and let nation
ally renown coaches work their magic.
The Cardinal has spent part of this year
entertaining recruits in order to compensate
for the losses created by the graduating
seniors and find new swimmers to con
tribute to next year's teams. And it has paid
off as good-sized groups are entering both
the men's and women's squads, including
some of the top high school swimmers and
divers in the country.
The Stanford men's team signed three
recruits in November before the early signing
date. One of these men could be the nation's
number one freestyle recruit, according to
Stanford assistant coach Ted Knapp.

Scott Claypool merits such a title in part
due to his outstanding performance at the
Olympic Sports Festival in San Antonio last
July. Not only did Claypool qualify for the

experience-wise, but they
can help with relays immedi
ately and grow to be NCAA
finalists.'

prestigious 35 sport festival, but he won the
50-yard freestyle and took fourth in the 100
freestyle. Chris Olsen, from Scottsdale, Ariz,
and Sabir Muhammad from Atlanta, Ga.
who both specialize in the 50 and 100
freestyle and 100 fly also signed in the fall.
Jed Crowe also of Scottsdale and Carl

Eriksson from Wellesley, Mass. will bring
their expertise in the 50 and 100 freestyle.
This makes five of the incoming seven
freestylers. The two aberrations are Andre
Salles-Cunha from Atlantic Beach, Fla.,
another Sports Festival competitor who
swims the 100 and 200 breaststroke and
Tom Wilkins from Middletown, N.J. who is a
YMCA champion and specializes in the 200
and 400 individual medley.
"This is a fairly young group experience
wise," Knapp said, "but they can help with
relays immediately and grow to be NCAA
finalists."
Seven big-name seniors will be graduat
ing, including specialists in almost every
event. The team's leadership will shift next
year as the current and new athletes take
their places.
While the swimmers will lose a chunk of
their squad, the three divers on the men's
team will return next year. Diving coach
Rick Schavone called them "very
competitive" and offered such goals
as becoming the top diving team in
the west and scoring points at
NCAAs.
The women of Stanford will
have seven new athletes to help
them work towards another NCAA
crown. San Diego native Michelle

signed in the fall.
Sprint freestylers Becky Bick
nell, the Colorado High School
Swimmer of the Year from Denver,
and Lindsey Gassner of Valencia,
Calif, will also add to the team. The
group is leveled out by Mary Naber,
a butterflyer from Salinas, Calif,
(who is also John Naber's cousin),
Evi-Lyn Buyer a 200 backstroker
from Palo Alto, and breaststroker
Kristin Nyweide from Chicago, 111.
"This class is very talented, how
ever they haven't accomplished a
lot on a national level," said Stan
ford women's coach Richard Quick,
"but I think they can."
While only three Cardinal
seniors will be leaving, their loss

will lie greater than this small num
ber implies. Ix»a Loveless, a co-cap
tain, is an Olympic medalist and
multiple NCAA individual winner.
Mary Edwards and Pam Minthorn
have both been multiple finalists in
NCAA individual events.
The Cardinal women divers
gained an important year of experi
ence this season, as the four com
peting were freshmen. They will be
joined next year by Holly Hindman
of Rochester, N.Y. while Molly
Wood and Eileen Richetelli will like
ly return after a year off the board
due to injuries.
Richetelli has twice won the
honor of NCAA Diver of the Year.
According to Schavone, "She is
doing fine, and has the goal of
repeating in '95."
The strength of both these
recruiting classes puts the Cardinal
in a good position for the upcoming
season. The stage is set for two
amazing teams, as both have cap
tured the NCAA titles for the past
three years and undoubtedly will
work towards that aim once again.
Even before his first deGuerre
workout, Claypool already exempli
fies the team mentality. When
asked what his goals are for next
year, he replied, "I want to help the
team win the team title. It'll be
challenging, but if we keep working
we can pull it off."
