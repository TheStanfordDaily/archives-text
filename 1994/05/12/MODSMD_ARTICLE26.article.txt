# Levick's a pro at athletics balance

From her office on the top
floor of the Arrillaga Fam
ily Sports Center, Cheryl
Ijevick can watch the flow of peo
ple across Campus Drive as they
head into the building. Her view
is unique, however, as she takes
the perspective of someone
responsible for the center's con
struction as well as the Depart
ment of Athletics' overall suc
cess year after year.
While coaches and players are
often the ones who we hear
about and go to watch out on the
fields and courts, a whole other
team of people works behind the
scenes. As the school's senior
associate athletic director, Lev
ick is one of the captains of this
special squad.
After hearing her moderate a
women's sports panel during
Herstory Month, I was interest
ed in her "insider's" view of the
Stanford athletic department. A
recreational athlete myself, I
was also curious about her role
in the development of women's
sports programs and her experi
ences in the male-dominated
world of collegiate athletics.
In her second year as a senior
associate, Levick's main respon
sibilities lie in the overseeing of
the school's varsity programs.
Such a watch is no small task
by any means. Stanford athletics
currently incorporates 700 ath
letes, more than 100 coaches and
160 staff members. As the inter
nal manager of a department of
Stanford's caliber, Levick keeps
certain guiding principles in
mind, standards to which her
professional and personal com
mitment runs deep.
"Our primary goals are to
stay within the rules, to main
tain high academic excellence
and to be successful," she said.
"To blend those three is a con
stant balancing act — that's
really my job."
When she arrived on the
Farm in May 1988, Levick had
already earned a reputation

within the field as someone who
had mastered the balancing act.
From her beginnings as a high
school gymnastics coach and
later as a professor, gymnastics
and track coach at Slippery Rock
University, Levick's early expe
riences afforded her an inside
view of exactly what's involved
in building successful athletic
programs.
With a background in teach
ing and coaching and a graduate
degree in athletic administra
tion, Levick took her first
administrative job. One of five
women hired by the NCAA in
the early '80s to organize and
develop the women's champi
onships, she handled the TV and
marketing components of the
program.
From there she moved to the
Pac-10 offices in 1986, where
she was in charge of running
both the men's and women's
tournaments. Every day she
comes to work at Stanford, Lev
ick draws upon her training with
these organizations, particularly
her work in the advancement of
women's programs.
As a long time advocate for
the development of female
sports teams, Levick spoke excit
edly of Stanford's Women's
Enhancement Program. After
the first year of its three-year
implementation plan, the pro
gram calls for increased funding
and financial support for the
women's side.
"We're really quite proud of
it," she said. "I think the women

student athletes feel of equal
worth to the male student ath
letes. That's the kind of environ
ment we want here."
Levick and her colleagues have
indeed come a long way in foster
ing this atmosphere. The friendly
interaction between men's and
women's teams and the tight cam
pus athletic community is strong
testament to their achievement.
Not only have the number of
women's teams grown in the
recent years, but the department
has also increased from 29 to 33
total varsity teams during a time
when many schools have been
forced to downsize. In what she
called "a real accomplishment for
Stanford," Levick has played a key
role in providing a maximum

number of chances for students to
participate in some form of athlet
ics.
Whether these opportunities is
on the varsity, club, intramural or
recreational level, they certainly
do exist at Stanford. And while
there are still a fair share of frus
trated high school superstars,
most students find the outlet
they're looking for, whether it be
the varsity swim team or a session
on the stairmaster.
An athlete in her own right,
Levick makes time to mountain
bike, water ski and snow ski with
her two daughters. Heading an
athletically-oriented family, she
ties her own comfort in the world
of sports to her ease within the
typically male-dominated world of
collegiate athletics.
"There are very few women in
most of the meeting rooms I'm
in," she explained, adding that the
sentiment toward women in the

department is exceptionally posi
tive.
While Stanford may provide
optimally equal opportunities for
men and women, Levick's success
has surely also stemmed from her
own passions and beliefs. The look
of confidence and determination
in her eyes when she speaks about
her professional and individual
objectives leaves no questions
about her sincerity.
"I go after my personal goals
with the same enthusiasm," she
said. "It takes a lot of energy to be
an athletic department adminis
tr?tor. Being a female athletic
administrator takes even more —
it basically all comes down to your
level of commitment."
Levick's, and Stanford's, com
mitment to strengthening
women's programs without dete
riorating men's has built the
department into a model for other
large collegiate athletic programs.

Striking that balance between
goals of equality and financial
realities hasn't necessarily come
easily, however. Many of Stan
ford's advances are the direct
result of funding from exceptional
fan support and a large donor
base, she explained, two compo
nents which many other schools
lack.
Citing the "funding challenge"
as one of the most important
issues that Stanford and intercol
legiate athletics as a whole face in
the '90s, Levick will continue
searching for the best ways to ser
vice all components of the Stan
ford department equitably. And
just seeing the spark in her eyes, I
feel confident that the job will get
done.

turated athletes and suggests an
early morning run around Cam
pus Drive.
