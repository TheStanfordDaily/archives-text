# Levick's a pro at athletics balance

From her office on the top
floor of the Arrillaga Fam
ily Sports Center, Cheryl
Ijevick can watch the flow of peo
ple across Campus Drive as they
head into the building. Her view
is unique, however, as she takes
the perspective of someone
responsible for the center's con
struction as well as the Depart
ment of Athletics' overall suc
cess year after year.
While coaches and players are
often the ones who we hear
about and go to watch out on the
fields and courts, a whole other
team of people works behind the
scenes. As the school's senior
associate athletic director, Lev
ick is one of the captains of this
special squad.
After hearing her moderate a
women's sports panel during
Herstory Month, I was interest
ed in her "insider's" view of the
Stanford athletic department. A
recreational athlete myself, I
was also curious about her role
in the development of women's
sports programs and her experi
ences in the male-dominated
world of collegiate athletics.
In her second year as a senior
associate, Levick's main respon
sibilities lie in the overseeing of
the school's varsity programs.
Such a watch is no small task
by any means. Stanford athletics
currently incorporates 700 ath
letes, more than 100 coaches and
160 staff members. As the inter
nal manager of a department of
Stanford's caliber, Levick keeps
certain guiding principles in
mind, standards to which her
professional and personal com
mitment runs deep.
"Our primary goals are to
stay within the rules, to main
tain high academic excellence
and to be successful," she said.
"To blend those three is a con
stant balancing act â€” that's
really my job."
When she arrived on the
Farm in May 1988, Levick had
already earned a reputation

within the field as someone who
had mastered the balancing act.
From her beginnings as a high
school gymnastics coach and
later as a professor, gymnastics
and track coach at Slippery Rock
University, Levick's early expe
riences afforded her an inside
view of exactly what's involved
in building successful athletic
programs.
With a background in teach
ing and coaching and a graduate
degree in athletic administra
tion, Levick took her first
administrative job. One of five
women hired by the NCAA in
the early '80s to organize and
develop the women's champi
onships, she handled the TV and
marketing components of the
program.
From there she moved to the
Pac-10 offices in 1986, where
she was in charge of running
both the men's and women's
tournaments. Every day she
comes to work at Stanford, Lev
ick draws upon her training with
these organizations, particularly
her work in the advancement of
women's programs.
As a long time advocate for
the development of female
sports teams, Levick spoke excit
edly of Stanford's Women's
Enhancement Program. After
the first year of its three-year
implementation plan, the pro
gram calls for increased funding
and financial support for the
women's side.
"We're really quite proud of
it," she said. "I think the women
