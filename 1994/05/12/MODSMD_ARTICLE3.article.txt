# Another type of aid
## University pushes community service internships as financial alternative 
### Scott Van Winkle Staff writer 
After a year of linking students with intern
ships in an effort to take the lead in President
Clinton's community-service push, University
administrators are discovering that they may
have to play catch-up.
A Stanford program linking the Financial
Aids Office and the Haas Center for Public Ser
vice aimed to use 5 percent of the federal work

study funds available to the University this year.
The program places low-income students in
community-service internships and partially
funds those internships.
Program coordinator Sue Gray said the pro
gram will "come pretty close" to meeting its
goal, but federal regulations which take effect
next year will make "pretty close" not good
enough.
If less than 5 percent of work-study funds
are spent on community service next year, the

government could lower the amount of federal
work-study funds the following year, according
to Financial Aids Officer Mary Morrison. Cur
rently, about 200 undergraduates and 150
graduate students receive this form of aid.
This year's program placed 60 to 80 students
in community service jobs, according to Diane
Coward, a Haas Center assistant director. But
that number did not constitute a large enough
share of work-study funds because
graduate students' aid amounts,
which include teaching assistant or
research assistant salaries and
tuition remission, are larger than
those granted to undergraduates.
Gray said the program will not
change significantly, but needs a
"big publicity push" to attract
more students next year.

Another problem was the pro
gram's failure to attract students to
available off-campus jobs, Gray said.
"Students tend to go more toward
programs they know," she said,
rather than exploring the new posi
tions the program made available.
Still, Morrison said Stanford is
ahead of other schools, especially
schools in isolated regions of the
country. She cited the example of a
Bible school in rural California,
adding, "Community service is the
concept (there), but who are they
going to help do what?"

Coward said she views the pro
gram as an opportunity for stu
dents from a low-income back
ground to engage in public service.
"It is a burden and it is difficult,"
she said, "but it's also enabling stu
dents" to give something back to
their communities.
The program "did really well"
this year, Coward said, but will
have to do better in the future —
especially if a rumored proposal to
increase the federal requirement to
10 percent of funding is approved
for next year.
