# Land of the lost

Let's anthropomorphize Time. Come
on, it'll be fun. Just close your eyes
and imagine l ime as he (Time is ob
viously male) would look as one of us, a
human. Now if lightning strikes you at just
the right moment, there he is! Time is in
your dorm room.
How does he look? Well, 1 must say he's
changed. Time used to be a grungy couch
potato, idly flipping channels with the remote
control or playing Atari 2600, while I suffered
through grade school and was bored on week
ends. But what is he now? He's a conservative,
dressed in a navy suit with a certain blue-and
red striped tie that George Bush favored.
He ticks slowly away if I am so careless as
to oh, say, watch a movie. He'll be quiet if he
thinks it's worthwhile; for example, I recent
ly saw "Sirens" which he was happy to relate
to my Modernism class, and "Belle Epoque"
during which Time smiled, content that 1
was practicing my Spanish. But then he grew
angry when 1 watched the beginning of "Top
Gun," ticked loudly during "Northern Ex
posure" and absolutely screamed during
"90210" and "Melrose Place."
Time is limber too. He can stretch long

and languidly on Friday afternoons so that I
think I have all the Time in the world to play,
party and study, or he can scrunch up infu
riatingly small, hiding in a fetal ball on Sun
day nights so that even the notion of finding
Time to go to Flicks is preposterous.
Time has become such a valued commod
ity in our busy student lives that leisure time
must be justifiable to our peers. We don't cut
class to go to the beach, we "take a mental
health day." We don't waste hours strum
ming "Stairway to Heaven" on guitar, "we
develop our musical sides, and vent our frus
trations in a creative manner." The song "I'm
Much More Stressed than You" in this year's
Gaities says it all; in the poker game of work,
the winner has to turn in those three papers
and an oral presentation, and the loser plays
"NBA Jams" on the neighbor's Sega.
Catch phrases of the '90s ring emptily in
my ears now that I know Time for what he
is: a thief. Free-time is one of my most

dreaded pet peeves, a campaign to liberate
order. If those radicals only knew what he
could do if allowed to get outside of my
dorm room, allowed to shed his conserva
tive suit. Time-management, there's anoth
er implausibility. Now that 1 know Time in
timately, I realize I can never control him.
All the leadership training in the world
won't save me from his controlling grasp.
The radio mocks me: "There never seems
to be enough time..." "Ti-i-i-ime is on my
side ..." "To everything, turn turn turn,
there is a season, and a time to every pur
pose under heaven." Television is equally
cruel, "The Wonder Years," ads for "Miller
Time" and vicious NBA announcers: "Tim
ing is everything." Books, too, upset me. 1
calculate the time: if this paper is due at
noon tomorrow and the book which 1
haven't read is 500 pages (there are no Cliff's
Notes for Proust) and I read at the rate of 50
pages an hour including bathroom breaks

and glances out the window, then the book
should take me 10 hours to read, leaving me
one half-hour to write a seven-page paper,
excluding sleep. HELP!
Is this it, then? What if he is like this for
ever? Will I live in fear of him until 1 become
like my grandparents, senile beyond the no
tions of temporal limitations? For them,
Time is a golf-course, green and lush, filled
with the promise of 18 long, curvy holes,
and a cute little cart to drive them in.
But enough of this fantasy/nightmare.
Time docs not exist; he is not animated, he
has only as much control over me as I let
him. With a glance at my imaginary
weapons arsenal, 1 loose my sonic beam
sending Time screaming, writhing in pain,
back to the imaginary realm of demons
from whence he came.
I suggest you do the same. I have things
to do. I shouldn't sit around here dreaming;
I shouldn't waste . In fact, I'm late, it's
for class, and 1 barely have enough
to see my friends, although, like 1 al
ways say, there's always for the impor
tant things. Oh hell, it must be bed
somewhere, so I'm going to take a nap. â–
