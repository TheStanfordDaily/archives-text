# HAIR 'On with the groovy revolution!'

nost people probably envision nothing
but naked people when thinking of
the 1968 tribal love-rock musical
"Hair." OK, that's what I think of too. But its
themes, plots and ideas are numerous: the
show is about a pack of hippies coming to
terms with themselves, each other and the
world around them as it existed in 1968. The
play does not have a traditional linear plot,
but is composed of a collection of skits and
songs and a large ensemble cast. The audi
ence comes to recognize, know and follow
the stories of eight freaks (defined by the of
ficial "Hair" dictionary as "n. a complimen
tary term for a person who wears flowers,
beads, etc") through their trippy lives.
This production, which is celebrating the
25th anniversary of the musical, begins with
a rather slow version of "Aquarius," with the
character of Claude standing in the middle of
the stage, lit up in blue, surrounded by rolling
fog and two beautiful women. Claude, played
by Luther Creek, is the only hippie who does
not burn his draft card, which leads to dis
cussion and songs about the evils of violence,
racism and war — specifically the Vietnam
War.
Psychedelic patterns, moons, flowers, etc.
were flashed constantly on an upstage
screen, but were no more distracting nor
high tech than would have been seen in the
'60s. The stage lights created the mood for
each scene without looking like a '90s laser
light show.
The first scene takes place on Canal Street
in New York City. Underneath, a tie-dyed
rock band jams for the audience, helping to
create a low-key, groovin' atmosphere. The
music, composed by Gait MacDermot, not
only was written in the late '60s rock style,
but actually became the classic rock that all
you "I was made for Woodstock, but was
born 20 years too late" pseudo-hippies are
still listening to. Songs such as "Aquarius,"
"Easy to be Hard," "Good Morning
Starshine" and "l et the Sun Shine" became
huge hits after the show's release.
However, a few songs were lacking. Both
the music and singing of "Easy to be Hard,"
sung by Sheila (Cathy Trien) sounded more
like early '80s Tiffany-esque elevator music
than anything else.
But by the second song, "Donna," the au
dience was dancing and the energy was up.
Berger (played charismatically by Kent
Dalian), a wild, long-haired "psychedelic
teddy-bear" with a who-gives-a-damn atti
tude, sang "Donna" directly to the audience.
"Hair" was one of the first musicals writ

ten to break the traditional theatrical wall
separating the audience from the actors, be
ginning a chain of revolutionary musicals
that relate to audiences on new and bizarre
levels. The actors in typical hippie garb were
often running around the house, talking,
singing and joking with the audience. At one
point, Berger jumped down to the front row,
sat down on his "mom's" lap, and sang and
pleaded with her with all his soul. I lis "mom"
turned out to be a balding, embarrassed suit.
The use of space helped to involve the audi
ence: for instance, the aisles doubled as en
trances. Also, every main character addressed
the audience specifically with their own sto
ries, problems, jokes and songs.
"Donna" was also the song that first
demonstrated the choreography (by Joe
Donovan) of the show. Almost all the mem
bers of the ensemble are good dancers, but
the dancing was scrupulously choreo
graphed to not look choreographed. As hip
pies, they all danced freely and indepen
dently, occasionally breaking into the same
(lowing and funky movements. The chore
ography was influenced by many parts of
U.S. geography and history, from the flap
pers to the hippies, from jazz to typical
Broadway musical styles, and from African-
Caribbean to Indian to Asian to North
American rhythms.
The cast itself was also beautiful ("beauti
ful: adj. an all-purpose term of approval; can
also be used as an exclamation"). Jeannie, the
pregnant, adorably geeky hippie who is
hopelessly in love with Claude was played by
Ali Zorlas: she was perfect for the part, writ
ing of herself in the program, "[ I) was born
on Dec. 19, 1968 and have lived on this plan
et ever since," and that's all.
My two favorite actors were Woof and
Crissy. The first we see of Woof, played by
Sean Jenness, is as a long-hair on the far right
of the stage during "Aquarius," neither
singing or dancing, but simply bouncing in
his own little world. I cracked up just watch
ing him. Jenness was lovable and nutty as the
strange, spacey hippie who sings "Holy
Orgy," likes to "grow things" and is helplessly
hung up on Mick lagger.
Crissy, played Rochele Rosenberg, is also a
quieter, far out ("tar out: adj. unusual, extra
ordinary; bizarre or avant-garde") character
who sings my personal favorite song of the
show, "Frank Mills" (more recently sung by
the Lemonheads). Though she did not speak
often, when she did, it was impossible not to
laugh. For instance, at one point, everyone
begins lighting up joints. Crissy walks for

ward hazily and tells us, "As Mary Magdalene
once said, 'Jesus, I'm getting stoned.' " Both
of these characters had great stage presence
and adorable oddity.
Finally, Henry Shead, Jr. (besides being
the most beautiful man to hit a stage in my
lifetime) was intense as Hud. He performed
"Colored Spade," a song which describes the
stereotypical roles assigned to black people in
the '60s, with a powerful voice and gracefully
tough dancing. However, the scripted role of
Hud is not well-developed enough as an in
dividual, but rather was created as a symbol
of his race, which leaves the audience dissat
isfied.
The show contains a variety of ideas,
themes and morals that we, as the children
of the flower children, can relate to: war,
race, peace, justice, love, drugs, patriotism
(or lack thereof), sexuality and personal
freedom. Issues of U.S. violence from
Columbus to Vietnam were embodied by a
freaky, glowing skeleton boy who slithered
around the stage. Racial issues were dis
cussed avidly, with hopes that one day there
will be "no more Aunt Jemimas, Uncle
Toms, or Mammies." The songs "Black
Boys" (sunt; bv white women) and "White

Boys" (sung by Supreme-like black women
all in the same neon-pink dress) showed
how cool interracial dating was at the time,
and shows how different our '90s multicul
tural beliefs are.
The big "drug scene" was fascinating be
cause it was choreographed and sung to
make the audience feel it was tripping out on
a vast array of drugs, the actors telling us to
"open our eyes" to the "beauty of life." And
all of us can understand the bowing and
praising of the sacred bed scene. The song
listed all the things we can do in bed, but ad
vises "Never, ever sleep in bed." Hmm, I
wonder what else you could possibly do?
With the dramatic ending (sorry, you'll
have to see it yourself) and the spiritual en
semble singing of "Let the Sun Shine," I was
zonked out ("zonked out: adj. totally fasci
nated") with the show. Overall, it was capti
vating, funky, and outta sight, man. ■
