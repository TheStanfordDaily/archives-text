# A 						SMOKY CONCRETE JUNGLE
## STANFORD DRAMA TAKES ON THE STRANGE, ESTRANGED WORLD OF BERTOLT BRECHT 
### JULIE TSAI 
It's a cold, dark world out there, and you
are all alone. But, oddly, that man in the
pale, flowing suit keeps returning to fight
with you. You don't trust him because he's
kind of suave and devilish at the same time,
like Ricardo Montalban, yet he's the only per
son you've met with any sort of consistency.
And everybody here is so angry! So stiff
and alienated and, remarkably, all literally
wearing sheer painted masks. The masks,
though, you slowly realize, are a metaphor
for something lifelike, somewhat garish and
— most notably — some world unnatural.
lust look at the sets, perfectly sullen and
sparsely furnished and draped in black mos
quito bar and tarp.
This modern world is Bertolt Brecht's per
sonal vision of urban life as encountered by
young naif George Garga; urban life in
Chicago circa 1920, which, interestingly
enough, Brecht never actually witnessed.
And if Drama Prof. Carl Weber's staging of
former mentor Brecht's "In the Jungle of the
Cities" seems jarringly different from the
psychological realism of most American
drama, well, that's the way it's meant to be.
ACTING UNNATURALLY
"One thing [Weber] keeps telling us is not
to act naturalistically," said senior Marjorie
Crigler, who plays the part of Mary Garga,
the fallen sister of the protagonist.
While such advice may seem counter-in
tuitive to the usual aims ot theater, the play
thrives on disruption of continuity. Between
scenes, a barrage of discordant music assaults
the ears. (Characters erupt into rages without
apparent motivation. The goateed gangster
figure Shlink acts oddly detached, almost as if
he addresses the audience. This is Art born of
the same world that spawned "Saturday
Night l ive" 's "Sprockets" host Dieter.
"It's the sort of play that sticks with you
after you've watched it," Crigler said. "The
lines don't always make sense."
Indeed, the plot itself revolves around the
arbitrary forced relationship between two
strangers, Shlink and George Garga, where
Shlink insists on staging a fight with Garga.
And the links from one scene to another are,
at most, loose.
"It is very ambiguous," agreed senior Dan
Hunt, who plays Shlink. "One thing that
makes it a little more comprehensible is to
look at the scenes as independent. Carl said
that Brecht used to say, 'Don't worry about
the motivation. lust concentrate on what's
happening right now in the scene.' "
Consistent with the actors'advice, the play
is easier to absorb when each scene is consid
ered individually. The fight scene, tor in

stance, is described by both Hunt and lead
lan McCrudden as contained violence, a clin
ical examination of an actual boxing match.
"Brecht loved boxing. He saw [the play] as
a boxing match," Hunt said.
If the whole scenario sounds quite disjoint
ed by now, perhaps that's part of Brecht's vision.
"As Carl said, it's the audience's pleasure
— or pain — to figure it out," Hunt
shrugged.
IT'S ALL VERY BRECHTIAN
"You cannot reduce the play to one simple
formula," Weber said. "Actions [in the play]
are often inscrutable.... Brecht deliberately
kept it vague. He was interested in behavior
patterns and collisions between people."
Weber probably has a pretty good idea of
what brecht was interested in. He worked as
a directing assistant with the playwright's
own Berliner Ensemble in Germany in the
years 1952-1956. Weber was later promoted
to resident director of the Ensemble and
staged many of Brecht's plays before and after
moving to the United States.
"(The play] reflects the moods, aspira
tions and despairs of young German people
after the war," Weber said. "It's about people
who want to escape from the world to a more
simple happy life, but Brecht had no illusions
about escaping. He thought cities were the
future of the world."
"In the Jungle of the Cities" is one of Brecht's
earliest plays, written when he was just 23. In it,
Brecht creates a complicated, irrational picture
of isolation and corruption. Simply, George
Garga and his sister Mary arrive in (Chicago
fresh from the country only to be engulfed in
the underworld of Shlink and his gangsters. But
Brecht doesn't give any resolutions.
Weber describes his former colleague as
prophetic for seeing the problems ot modern
urbanization before many others, though he
said Brecht was influenced by artists such as
Upton Sinclair, Arthur Rimbaud and Paul
Gauguin.
And if Brecht himself was a major artistic
influence on Weber, its clear too that Weber
has a very clear vision ol what he wants and
how to achieve it.
PERFECTION ONLY
"Brecht is so fucking hard, I don't think
anybody else would do it," McCrudden said.
"Weber wants to do it, but he just has to teach
us everything."
"He's demanded a higher degree ot preci
sion than any director I've ever known,"
Hunt said relating a rehearsal incident when
Weber told him to elevate his arm to exactly
this height, no higher, no lower.

And it'sapparent tooduring rehearsals, "al
ways like Armageddon the last couple days,"
Weher jokes, that time and patience run short
and technical difficulties long. But the cast and
crew take everything in stride since they all
have their eyes on the same prize.
"Its a lot better than working on a sloppy
production," Crigler said. "And this text is so

intricate — there are a lot of things that come
up again and again." ■

"In the Jungle of the Cities" runs at X p.m.
Wednesday through Saturday both this week
end ami next at Memorial Hall's Little Theater.
Tickets are $9 general/$5 students and can he
bought both at Tresidder and at the door.

And the links from one scene to another are,
at most, loose.
"It is very ambiguous," agreed senior Dan
Hunt, who plays Shlink. "One thing that
makes it a little more comprehensible is to
look at the scenes as independent. Carl said
that Brecht used to say, 'Don't worry about
the motivation. lust concentrate on what's
happening right now in the scene.' "
Consistent with the actors'advice, the play
is easier to absorb when each scene is consid
ered individually. The fight scene, tor in

stance, is described by both Hunt and lead
lan McCrudden as contained violence, a clin
ical examination of an actual boxing match.
"Brecht loved boxing. He saw [the play] as
a boxing match," Hunt said.
If the whole scenario sounds quite disjoint
ed by now, perhaps that's part of Brecht's vision.
"As Carl said, it's the audience's pleasure
— or pain — to figure it out," Hunt
shrugged.
IT'S ALL VERY BRECHTIAN
"You cannot reduce the play to one simple
formula," Weber said. "Actions [in the play]
are often inscrutable.... Brecht deliberately
kept it vague. He was interested in behavior
patterns and collisions between people."
Weber probably has a pretty good idea of
what brecht was interested in. He worked as
a directing assistant with the playwright's
own Berliner Ensemble in Germany in the
years 1952-1956. Weber was later promoted
to resident director of the Ensemble and
staged many of Brecht's plays before and after
moving to the United States.
"(The play] reflects the moods, aspira
tions and despairs of young German people
after the war," Weber said. "It's about people
who want to escape from the world to a more
simple happy life, but Brecht had no illusions
about escaping. He thought cities were the
future of the world."
"In the Jungle of the Cities" is one of Brecht's
earliest plays, written when he was just 23. In it,
Brecht creates a complicated, irrational picture
of isolation and corruption. Simply, George
Garga and his sister Mary arrive in (Chicago
fresh from the country only to be engulfed in
the underworld of Shlink and his gangsters. But
Brecht doesn't give any resolutions.
Weber describes his former colleague as
prophetic for seeing the problems ot modern
urbanization before many others, though he
said Brecht was influenced by artists such as
Upton Sinclair, Arthur Rimbaud and Paul
Gauguin.
And if Brecht himself was a major artistic
influence on Weber, its clear too that Weber
has a very clear vision ol what he wants and
how to achieve it.
PERFECTION ONLY
"Brecht is so fucking hard, I don't think
anybody else would do it," McCrudden said.
"Weber wants to do it, but he just has to teach
us everything."
"He's demanded a higher degree ot preci
sion than any director I've ever known,"
Hunt said relating a rehearsal incident when
Weber told him to elevate his arm to exactly
this height, no higher, no lower.

Weher jokes, that time and patience run short

Vincent Ho — Daily
It's a cold, dark world out there, and you
are all alone. But, oddly, that man in the
pale, flowing suit keeps returning to fight
with you. You don't trust him because he's
kind of suave and devilish at the same time,
like Ricardo Montalban, yet he's the only per
son you've met with any sort of consistency.
And everybody here is so angry! So stiff
and alienated and, remarkably, all literally
wearing sheer painted masks. The masks,
though, you slowly realize, are a metaphor
for something lifelike, somewhat garish and
— most notably — some world unnatural.
lust look at the sets, perfectly sullen and
sparsely furnished and draped in black mos
quito bar and tarp.
This modern world is Bertolt Brecht's per
sonal vision of urban life as encountered by
young naif George Garga; urban life in
Chicago circa 1920, which, interestingly
enough, Brecht never actually witnessed.
And if Drama Prof. Carl Weber's staging of
former mentor Brecht's "In the Jungle of the
Cities" seems jarringly different from the
psychological realism of most American
drama, well, that's the way it's meant to be.
ACTING UNNATURALLY
"One thing [Weber] keeps telling us is not
to act naturalistically," said senior Marjorie
Crigler, who plays the part of Mary Garga,
the fallen sister of the protagonist.
While such advice may seem counter-in
tuitive to the usual aims ot theater, the play
thrives on disruption of continuity. Between
scenes, a barrage of discordant music assaults
the ears. (Characters erupt into rages without
apparent motivation. The goateed gangster
figure Shlink acts oddly detached, almost as if
he addresses the audience. This is Art born of
the same world that spawned "Saturday
Night l ive" 's "Sprockets" host Dieter.
"It's the sort of play that sticks with you
after you've watched it," Crigler said. "The
lines don't always make sense."
Indeed, the plot itself revolves around the
arbitrary forced relationship between two
strangers, Shlink and George Garga, where
Shlink insists on staging a fight with Garga.
And the links from one scene to another are,
at most, loose.
"It is very ambiguous," agreed senior Dan
Hunt, who plays Shlink. "One thing that
makes it a little more comprehensible is to
look at the scenes as independent. Carl said
