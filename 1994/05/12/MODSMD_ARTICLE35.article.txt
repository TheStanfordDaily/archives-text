# Two flew over the cuckop's nest
## The 						parable of They Might Be Giants 
### Colleen Krueger Mike Noren 
John Henry: He's a folkloric figure from the
19th century who was involved in a competi
tion between himself and a machine to see who
could dig the longest tunnel through some
rocks. And it was during the era when ma
chines were just beginning to appear on the
landscape and take over the jobs of human be
ings. So the story is kind of a parable about
mans place in the world of machines. What
happens in the competition is that John Henry
digs the deepest tunnel, but he then dies of a
heart attack or something, and the machine
breaks down.
—John Linnell, They Might Be Giants
They Might Be Giants have gathered a
considerable following as the quirky,
imaginative duo made up of guitarist/vo
calist/horn-player John Flansburgh and ac
cordion/keyboard/horn-player/vocalist Lin-

Nell — a duo that has created its own distinct
sound, combining human instrumental and
lyrical talents with a creative use of tapes and
technology both in the studio and on tour.
Such was the sound that produced such
hits as "Ana Ng," "Don't Let's Start," "The
Statue Got Me High" and "Birdhouse in Your
Soul." The sound made TMBG their own
musical phenomenon virtually impossible to
categorize. And the sound has brought them
wide media exposure — from guest-hosting
MTV's "120 Minutes" to being named
NASA's 1992 Musical Ambassadors for Inter
national Space Year.
The only difference
But now it appears that TMBG's musical
experimentation has brought them full cir
cle, this time away from synthesized back
ground and toward a concept they've been
toying with for the last few years: a full band.
On their upcoming album, "John Henry" —
due out in late summer — the two Johns are
accompanied for the first time in the studio
by a whole range of musicians, backing up
their usual brand of wit and energy.
"The main new direction that it's going in
is that it's a recording of our band — in a way,
that's really the only difference," Linnell said.
"In fact, most of the songs were written in
more or less the same way."
While the full band may be "the only dif
ference," it could prove to be a substantial dif
ference for those expecting the same old two
piece ensemble on the upcoming album or
current tour, which comes to Rinc-A-Delt at
Stanford's Frost Amphitheater this Sunday.
In fact, some fans have voiced concern
that in bringing outside instrumentalists into
the act, TMBG's unique songwriting style
might be lost in the shuffle.

Linnell dismisses such fears casually.
"We were writing with the idea in mind of
having the band play it, so you could say that
may have affected our songwriting in some
way," he said. "But the songwriting is the same
kind of songwriting that we've done in the past."
Their songwriting tends to wed the non
sensical to the profound, exposing and ex
ploring the peculiar, fascinating nature of the
seemingly incidental.
Take, for example, the track "Nothing's
Gonna Change My Clothes" from their 1987
debut album, which begins: "All the people
are so happy now their heads are caving
in / I'm glad they are a snowman with pro
tective rubber skin."
Or, from their second release "Lincoln,"
the song "Where Your Eyes Don't Go":
"Every jumbled pile of person has a thinking
part that wonders what the part that isn't

thinking isn't thinking of."
Linnell, however, seems far less analytical
of his songwriting.
"We try and do something interesting and
original-sounding," he said. "We're trying to
do something that we haven't done before.
"I think we feel that what we do is good,
you know?" He added. "When it's good, we
like what we do ... so that more or less de
fines it for us, we like the kind of music that
we're doing."
Linnell's simple musical pride echoes in
the title and theme of "John Henry." Inter
preting the simple folktale in terms of the
group's musical evolution, Linnell seems to
identify with the character John 1 Jenry.
"I guess one way of interpreting the story
is that John Henry is driven by pride, which
the machine lacks," Linnell said. "And there's
this kind of romance to the guy who is strug
gling to beat this machine."
I.inking the story of John Henry to their
full-band conversion, Linnell said he charac
teristically took a simple, to-the-point ap
proach.
"In the past we've always used sequencers,
and primarily we've had the whole thing dri
ven by a Macintosh computer," he explained,
"So, for us, it seems like kind of an apt para
ble about people versus machines."
The Mick IDilk effect
The balance between human sound and
technologically produced music has existed
from the very genesis of TMBG.
Although Linnell and Flansburgh knew
each other in high school, the two did not
converge musically until 1981, when they
were living in two different apartments in the
same building in Brooklyn, Linnell said.
While they occasionally wrote songs or

"made little recordings together," it wasn't until
they joined with a mutual friend from the same
building, bass player Dave Lindsey, that they
actually formed a hand. As an "oddball three
piece" without a drummer, the group faced
problems with their rhythm section.
Shortly later, Lindsey's departure left an
even more gaping hole in the fledgling group,
leaving them with no rhythm section at all. It
was the inspiration of another friend that led
TMBG in the direction that would eventual
ly make them famous.
"John had a friend who was doing a per
formance with tapes. It was just him playing
guitar by himself and tapes," Linnell said.
"This guy's name was Mick Milk, and he
seemed to actually have a following of people
who really liked what he was doing.
"It seemed like a perfectly viable way to per
form — in fact, kind of an interesting way to
perform, because you could put whatever you
wanted to on the tapes," he added. "So we pret
ty much just took our cue from that guy, and
started doing our tape show, and we did that
show for about 10 years, or almost 10 years."
A They Might Be Giants show is much
more than a Mick Milk rip-off, however. Lin
nell and Flansburgh incorporate live antics
that Milk would never have dreamed ot.
"Recently we've been doing this thing
where we ask one of the security guards what
their father or mother's favorite song is, and
we try and play that," Linnell said. "Basically,
we're just trying to refine this thing where we
play an interesting cover that we've never
played before."
On previous tours, TMBG has employed
similar random tactics, like the "Stump the
Band" and "Spin the Dial" features. While
"Stump the Band" merely asked audience
members to call out their favorite tunes,
"Spin the Dial" involved picking a radio sta
tion at random and performing whatever
song happened to be playing.
"Every time we do something random its
the most chancy part of the show because a
lot of times I think it really grinds to a halt,"
Linnell said. "Other parts of the show are
much less spontaneous, hut they're much
more dependable."
110 beards no ski caps
It's the chancy, however, and not the de
pendable that has brought I'MBG much ot
the following and critical acclaim they now
enjoy. Rather than following in the well-worn
tracks of popular and money-making alter
native bands on the scene, TMBG prides it
sell on forging its own path.
"We never really, fortunately, are able to
get a real grip on exactly what it is we're
doing, in terms ot the scene," Linnell said.
"We're just doing it to please ourselves, and I
think we have a very hard time trying to con
sider our exact position in the Pantheon, or
what have you.
"What we do is our own bag, we certainly
are not tailoring it to 'the scene."
Linnell went one step further, admitting
that he felt almost completely out ot touch
with "the scene" itself.
"We're kind of outside ol 'the scene* — I
mean, 1 don't even really know what 'the
scene' is," he said. "I feel like at some point re
cently I passed the age where I even know
what's going on anymore.
"I notice that there are a lot of bands now
with little beards, and they have this particu
lar way of dressing, you know, much more
uniform than it used to be" Linnell added,
"They wear little ski caps and things ... so I

just feel like an old man now."
Despite their move toward a more con
ventional band, Linnell has no worries that
TMBG will blend into the uniformity of
sound characteristic of much of today's "al
ternative" genre.
"We don't want to sound the same as
everyone else, but 1 think that that would be
difficult anyway," he said. "Unless for some
perverse reason we decide to sound exactly
like some specific other band, it doesn't seem
very likely that we'd end up sounding like
anyone else."
In fact, it's probable that TMBG's unusual
sound can be linked partially to Linnell'sown
varied musical influences.
"The way I picture my own interest in
music is sort of like a tree that grows," Linnell
said. "The trunk is basically the Beatles and
everything comes out of that, and that's just
because I was born in 1959. For me, that's
where it's at, so that obviously leads me to a
lot of things that are extremely far away from
the Beatles, in terms of influences, but that's
kind of where it all started."
Linnell also cites such an eclectic group of
artists as the Meat Puppets, the dß's and Phil
Ochs as influential in the development ot
TMBG's distinctive sound.
Because of TMBG's position "outside ot
the scene," their lyrics are also immune to the
confinement of collective interpretations
forced upon mass-marketed, popular alter
native hits, Linnell said.
"I think if you like it, then you understand
the point of it,"he explained. "It says syme
thingto 1 the listener]. Maybe it's not 100 per
cent obvious or easy to put into words, but it
you like it, then it must have some meaning."
TMBG's lyrical flexibility allows their
words to be interpreted philosophically, or to
simply reflect the spirit of the moment — as
in the inspiration for the title of their current
tour, "I Should Be the Loudest Thing."
" There's a song on the new record called 'I
Should Be Allowed to Think' and when we

were mixing it we started singing other ver
sions of it," Linnell remembers. "And when
you have your musicians assembled in the
control room, there's a tendency for every
body to want themselves to be the loudest."
97E-THIE
"I Should Be Allowed to Think" and other
tracks from "John Henry" can be previewed
by calling TMBG's Dial-A-Song feature, a
souped-up answering machine that plays a
different song every day. The number is (718)
387-6962 and is just the cost of a call to New
York.
A few calls to the I)ial-A-Song should
make it apparent that TMBG's shift from a
Macintosh computer to a full band does not
seem to weigh the band down at all. Instead,
it only seems to expand their already bounti
ful pool of creative possibilities.
The tension between man and machine
aside, TMBG fans can expect more of the
same odd and endearing music from "John
Henry" and at the upcoming Stanford show.
"Technically speaking, we're not really
supporting the album yet," Linnell said of the
current tour. " This is partly a pay-some-bills,
pay-for-the-gas-for-the-other-tour [which is
in September] kind of a tour."
Since "John Henry" hasn't been released
yet, Linnell said that the band plans to focus
on its older material while at Stanford. And
although a few teasing tracks from "John
Henry" will surely be in store for fans at
Frost, he offered a reflective glimpse of what
the complete album will be like.
"It's a rock album, and it's a pop album,
and it's a love album," Linnell added, mus
ingly. "It's a Thev Might Be Giants album." ■

phitheater. Brum Dwati and Frente! open. And

Shortly later, Lindsey's departure left an
even more gaping hole in the fledgling group,
leaving them with no rhythm section at all. It
was the inspiration of another friend that led
TMBG in the direction that would eventual
ly make them famous.
"John had a friend who was doing a per
formance with tapes. It was just him playing
guitar by himself and tapes," Linnell said.
"This guy's name was Mick Milk, and he
seemed to actually have a following of people
who really liked what he was doing.
"It seemed like a perfectly viable way to per
form — in fact, kind of an interesting way to
perform, because you could put whatever you
wanted to on the tapes," he added. "So we pret
ty much just took our cue from that guy, and
started doing our tape show, and we did that
show for about 10 years, or almost 10 years."
A They Might Be Giants show is much
more than a Mick Milk rip-off, however. Lin
nell and Flansburgh incorporate live antics
that Milk would never have dreamed ot.
"Recently we've been doing this thing
where we ask one of the security guards what
their father or mother's favorite song is, and
we try and play that," Linnell said. "Basically,
we're just trying to refine this thing where we
play an interesting cover that we've never
played before."
On previous tours, TMBG has employed
similar random tactics, like the "Stump the
Band" and "Spin the Dial" features. While
"Stump the Band" merely asked audience
members to call out their favorite tunes,
"Spin the Dial" involved picking a radio sta
tion at random and performing whatever
song happened to be playing.
"Every time we do something random its
the most chancy part of the show because a
lot of times I think it really grinds to a halt,"
Linnell said. "Other parts of the show are
much less spontaneous, hut they're much
more dependable."
110 beards no ski caps
It's the chancy, however, and not the de
pendable that has brought I'MBG much ot
the following and critical acclaim they now
enjoy. Rather than following in the well-worn
tracks of popular and money-making alter
native bands on the scene, TMBG prides it
sell on forging its own path.
"We never really, fortunately, are able to
get a real grip on exactly what it is we're
doing, in terms ot the scene," Linnell said.
"We're just doing it to please ourselves, and I
think we have a very hard time trying to con
sider our exact position in the Pantheon, or
what have you.
"What we do is our own bag, we certainly
are not tailoring it to 'the scene."
Linnell went one step further, admitting
that he felt almost completely out ot touch
with "the scene" itself.
"We're kind of outside ol 'the scene* — I
mean, 1 don't even really know what 'the
scene' is," he said. "I feel like at some point re
cently I passed the age where I even know
what's going on anymore.
"I notice that there are a lot of bands now
with little beards, and they have this particu
lar way of dressing, you know, much more
uniform than it used to be" Linnell added,
"They wear little ski caps and things ... so I

just feel like an old man now."
Despite their move toward a more con
ventional band, Linnell has no worries that
TMBG will blend into the uniformity of
sound characteristic of much of today's "al
ternative" genre.
"We don't want to sound the same as
everyone else, but 1 think that that would be
difficult anyway," he said. "Unless for some
perverse reason we decide to sound exactly
like some specific other band, it doesn't seem
very likely that we'd end up sounding like
anyone else."
In fact, it's probable that TMBG's unusual
sound can be linked partially to Linnell'sown
varied musical influences.
"The way I picture my own interest in
music is sort of like a tree that grows," Linnell
said. "The trunk is basically the Beatles and
everything comes out of that, and that's just
because I was born in 1959. For me, that's
where it's at, so that obviously leads me to a
lot of things that are extremely far away from
the Beatles, in terms of influences, but that's
kind of where it all started."
Linnell also cites such an eclectic group of
artists as the Meat Puppets, the dß's and Phil
Ochs as influential in the development ot
TMBG's distinctive sound.
Because of TMBG's position "outside ot
the scene," their lyrics are also immune to the
confinement of collective interpretations
forced upon mass-marketed, popular alter
native hits, Linnell said.
"I think if you like it, then you understand
the point of it,"he explained. "It says syme
thingto 1 the listener]. Maybe it's not 100 per
cent obvious or easy to put into words, but it
you like it, then it must have some meaning."
TMBG's lyrical flexibility allows their
words to be interpreted philosophically, or to
simply reflect the spirit of the moment — as
in the inspiration for the title of their current
tour, "I Should Be the Loudest Thing."
" There's a song on the new record called 'I
Should Be Allowed to Think' and when we

were mixing it we started singing other ver
sions of it," Linnell remembers. "And when
you have your musicians assembled in the
control room, there's a tendency for every
body to want themselves to be the loudest."
97E-THIE
"I Should Be Allowed to Think" and other
tracks from "John Henry" can be previewed
by calling TMBG's Dial-A-Song feature, a
souped-up answering machine that plays a
different song every day. The number is (718)
387-6962 and is just the cost of a call to New
York.
A few calls to the I)ial-A-Song should
make it apparent that TMBG's shift from a
Macintosh computer to a full band does not
seem to weigh the band down at all. Instead,
it only seems to expand their already bounti
ful pool of creative possibilities.
The tension between man and machine
aside, TMBG fans can expect more of the
same odd and endearing music from "John
Henry" and at the upcoming Stanford show.
"Technically speaking, we're not really
supporting the album yet," Linnell said of the
current tour. " This is partly a pay-some-bills,
pay-for-the-gas-for-the-other-tour [which is
in September] kind of a tour."
Since "John Henry" hasn't been released
yet, Linnell said that the band plans to focus
on its older material while at Stanford. And
although a few teasing tracks from "John
Henry" will surely be in store for fans at
Frost, he offered a reflective glimpse of what
the complete album will be like.
"It's a rock album, and it's a pop album,
and it's a love album," Linnell added, mus
ingly. "It's a Thev Might Be Giants album." ■

John Henry: He's a folkloric figure from the
19th century who was involved in a competi
tion between himself and a machine to see who
could dig the longest tunnel through some
rocks. And it was during the era when ma
chines were just beginning to appear on the
landscape and take over the jobs of human be
ings. So the story is kind of a parable about
mans place in the world of machines. What
happens in the competition is that John Henry
digs the deepest tunnel, but he then dies of a
heart attack or something, and the machine
breaks down.
—John Linnell, They Might Be Giants
They Might Be Giants have gathered a
considerable following as the quirky,
imaginative duo made up of guitarist/vo
calist/horn-player John Flansburgh and ac
cordion/keyboard/horn-player/vocalist Lin-

Nell — a duo that has created its own distinct
sound, combining human instrumental and
lyrical talents with a creative use of tapes and
technology both in the studio and on tour.
Such was the sound that produced such
hits as "Ana Ng," "Don't Let's Start," "The
Statue Got Me High" and "Birdhouse in Your
Soul." The sound made TMBG their own
musical phenomenon virtually impossible to
categorize. And the sound has brought them
wide media exposure — from guest-hosting
MTV's "120 Minutes" to being named
NASA's 1992 Musical Ambassadors for Inter
national Space Year.
The only difference
But now it appears that TMBG's musical
experimentation has brought them full cir
cle, this time away from synthesized back
ground and toward a concept they've been
toying with for the last few years: a full band.
On their upcoming album, "John Henry" —
due out in late summer — the two Johns are
accompanied for the first time in the studio
by a whole range of musicians, backing up
their usual brand of wit and energy.
"The main new direction that it's going in
is that it's a recording of our band — in a way,
that's really the only difference," Linnell said.
"In fact, most of the songs were written in
more or less the same way."
While the full band may be "the only dif
ference," it could prove to be a substantial dif
ference for those expecting the same old two
piece ensemble on the upcoming album or
current tour, which comes to Rinc-A-Delt at
Stanford's Frost Amphitheater this Sunday.
In fact, some fans have voiced concern
that in bringing outside instrumentalists into
the act, TMBG's unique songwriting style
might be lost in the shuffle.

Linnell dismisses such fears casually.
"We were writing with the idea in mind of
having the band play it, so you could say that
may have affected our songwriting in some
way," he said. "But the songwriting is the same
kind of songwriting that we've done in the past."
Their songwriting tends to wed the non
sensical to the profound, exposing and ex
ploring the peculiar, fascinating nature of the
seemingly incidental.
Take, for example, the track "Nothing's
Gonna Change My Clothes" from their 1987
debut album, which begins: "All the people
are so happy now their heads are caving
in / I'm glad they are a snowman with pro
tective rubber skin."
Or, from their second release "Lincoln,"
the song "Where Your Eyes Don't Go":
"Every jumbled pile of person has a thinking
part that wonders what the part that isn't

thinking isn't thinking of."
Linnell, however, seems far less analytical
of his songwriting.
"We try and do something interesting and
original-sounding," he said. "We're trying to
do something that we haven't done before.
"I think we feel that what we do is good,
you know?" He added. "When it's good, we
like what we do ... so that more or less de
fines it for us, we like the kind of music that
we're doing."
Linnell's simple musical pride echoes in
the title and theme of "John Henry." Inter
preting the simple folktale in terms of the
group's musical evolution, Linnell seems to
identify with the character John 1 Jenry.
"I guess one way of interpreting the story
is that John Henry is driven by pride, which
the machine lacks," Linnell said. "And there's
this kind of romance to the guy who is strug
gling to beat this machine."
I.inking the story of John Henry to their
full-band conversion, Linnell said he charac
teristically took a simple, to-the-point ap
proach.
"In the past we've always used sequencers,
and primarily we've had the whole thing dri
ven by a Macintosh computer," he explained,
"So, for us, it seems like kind of an apt para
ble about people versus machines."
The Mick IDilk effect
The balance between human sound and
technologically produced music has existed
from the very genesis of TMBG.
Although Linnell and Flansburgh knew
each other in high school, the two did not
converge musically until 1981, when they
were living in two different apartments in the
same building in Brooklyn, Linnell said.
While they occasionally wrote songs or

"made little recordings together," it wasn't until
they joined with a mutual friend from the same
building, bass player Dave Lindsey, that they
actually formed a hand. As an "oddball three
piece" without a drummer, the group faced
problems with their rhythm section.
Shortly later, Lindsey's departure left an
even more gaping hole in the fledgling group,
leaving them with no rhythm section at all. It
was the inspiration of another friend that led
TMBG in the direction that would eventual
ly make them famous.
"John had a friend who was doing a per
formance with tapes. It was just him playing
guitar by himself and tapes," Linnell said.
"This guy's name was Mick Milk, and he
seemed to actually have a following of people
who really liked what he was doing.

perform, because you could put whatever you
wanted to on the tapes," he added. "So we pret
ty much just took our cue from that guy, and
started doing our tape show, and we did that
show for about 10 years, or almost 10 years."
A They Might Be Giants show is much

nell and Flansburgh incorporate live antics
that Milk would never have dreamed ot.
"Recently we've been doing this thing
where we ask one of the security guards what
their father or mother's favorite song is, and
we try and play that," Linnell said. "Basically,
we're just trying to refine this thing where we

"I Should Be Allowed to Think" and other
tracks from "John Henry" can be previewed
by calling TMBG's Dial-A-Song feature, a
souped-up answering machine that plays a
different song every day. The number is (718)
387-6962 and is just the cost of a call to New
York.
A few calls to the I)ial-A-Song should
make it apparent that TMBG's shift from a
Macintosh computer to a full band does not
seem to weigh the band down at all. Instead,
it only seems to expand their already bounti
ful pool of creative possibilities.
The tension between man and machine
aside, TMBG fans can expect more of the
same odd and endearing music from "John
Henry" and at the upcoming Stanford show.
"Technically speaking, we're not really
supporting the album yet," Linnell said of the
current tour. " This is partly a pay-some-bills,
pay-for-the-gas-for-the-other-tour [which is
in September] kind of a tour."
Since "John Henry" hasn't been released
yet, Linnell said that the band plans to focus
on its older material while at Stanford. And
although a few teasing tracks from "John
Henry" will surely be in store for fans at
Frost, he offered a reflective glimpse of what
the complete album will be like.
"It's a rock album, and it's a pop album,

John Henry: He's a folkloric figure from the
19th century who was involved in a competi
tion between himself and a machine to see who
could dig the longest tunnel through some
rocks. And it was during the era when ma
chines were just beginning to appear on the
landscape and take over the jobs of human be
ings. So the story is kind of a parable about
mans place in the world of machines. What
happens in the competition is that John Henry
digs the deepest tunnel, but he then dies of a
heart attack or something, and the machine
breaks down.
—John Linnell, They Might Be Giants
They Might Be Giants have gathered a
considerable following as the quirky,
imaginative duo made up of guitarist/vo
calist/horn-player John Flansburgh and ac
cordion/keyboard/horn-player/vocalist Lin-

Nell — a duo that has created its own distinct
sound, combining human instrumental and
lyrical talents with a creative use of tapes and
technology both in the studio and on tour.
Such was the sound that produced such
hits as "Ana Ng," "Don't Let's Start," "The
Statue Got Me High" and "Birdhouse in Your
Soul." The sound made TMBG their own
musical phenomenon virtually impossible to
categorize. And the sound has brought them
wide media exposure — from guest-hosting
MTV's "120 Minutes" to being named
NASA's 1992 Musical Ambassadors for Inter
national Space Year.
The only difference
But now it appears that TMBG's musical
experimentation has brought them full cir
cle, this time away from synthesized back
ground and toward a concept they've been
toying with for the last few years: a full band.
On their upcoming album, "John Henry" —
due out in late summer — the two Johns are
accompanied for the first time in the studio
by a whole range of musicians, backing up
their usual brand of wit and energy.
"The main new direction that it's going in
is that it's a recording of our band — in a way,
that's really the only difference," Linnell said.
"In fact, most of the songs were written in
more or less the same way."
While the full band may be "the only dif
ference," it could prove to be a substantial dif
ference for those expecting the same old two
piece ensemble on the upcoming album or
current tour, which comes to Rinc-A-Delt at
Stanford's Frost Amphitheater this Sunday.
In fact, some fans have voiced concern
that in bringing outside instrumentalists into
the act, TMBG's unique songwriting style
might be lost in the shuffle.

Linnell dismisses such fears casually.
"We were writing with the idea in mind of
having the band play it, so you could say that
may have affected our songwriting in some
way," he said. "But the songwriting is the same
kind of songwriting that we've done in the past."
Their songwriting tends to wed the non
sensical to the profound, exposing and ex
ploring the peculiar, fascinating nature of the
seemingly incidental.
Take, for example, the track "Nothing's
Gonna Change My Clothes" from their 1987
debut album, which begins: "All the people
are so happy now their heads are caving
in / I'm glad they are a snowman with pro
tective rubber skin."
Or, from their second release "Lincoln,"
the song "Where Your Eyes Don't Go":
"Every jumbled pile of person has a thinking
part that wonders what the part that isn't

thinking isn't thinking of."
Linnell, however, seems far less analytical
of his songwriting.
"We try and do something interesting and
original-sounding," he said. "We're trying to
do something that we haven't done before.
"I think we feel that what we do is good,
you know?" He added. "When it's good, we
like what we do ... so that more or less de
fines it for us, we like the kind of music that
we're doing."
Linnell's simple musical pride echoes in
the title and theme of "John Henry." Inter
preting the simple folktale in terms of the
group's musical evolution, Linnell seems to
identify with the character John 1 Jenry.
"I guess one way of interpreting the story
is that John Henry is driven by pride, which
the machine lacks," Linnell said. "And there's
this kind of romance to the guy who is strug
gling to beat this machine."
I.inking the story of John Henry to their
full-band conversion, Linnell said he charac
teristically took a simple, to-the-point ap
proach.
"In the past we've always used sequencers,
and primarily we've had the whole thing dri
ven by a Macintosh computer," he explained,
"So, for us, it seems like kind of an apt para
ble about people versus machines."
The Mick IDilk effect
The balance between human sound and
technologically produced music has existed
from the very genesis of TMBG.
Although Linnell and Flansburgh knew
each other in high school, the two did not
converge musically until 1981, when they
were living in two different apartments in the
same building in Brooklyn, Linnell said.
While they occasionally wrote songs or

"made little recordings together," it wasn't until
they joined with a mutual friend from the same
building, bass player Dave Lindsey, that they
actually formed a hand. As an "oddball three
piece" without a drummer, the group faced
problems with their rhythm section.
Shortly later, Lindsey's departure left an
even more gaping hole in the fledgling group,
leaving them with no rhythm section at all. It
was the inspiration of another friend that led
TMBG in the direction that would eventual
ly make them famous.
"John had a friend who was doing a per
formance with tapes. It was just him playing
guitar by himself and tapes," Linnell said.
"This guy's name was Mick Milk, and he
seemed to actually have a following of people
who really liked what he was doing.
"It seemed like a perfectly viable way to per
form — in fact, kind of an interesting way to
perform, because you could put whatever you
wanted to on the tapes," he added. "So we pret
ty much just took our cue from that guy, and
started doing our tape show, and we did that
show for about 10 years, or almost 10 years."
A They Might Be Giants show is much
more than a Mick Milk rip-off, however. Lin
nell and Flansburgh incorporate live antics
that Milk would never have dreamed ot.
"Recently we've been doing this thing
where we ask one of the security guards what
their father or mother's favorite song is, and
we try and play that," Linnell said. "Basically,
we're just trying to refine this thing where we
play an interesting cover that we've never
played before."
On previous tours, TMBG has employed
similar random tactics, like the "Stump the
Band" and "Spin the Dial" features. While
"Stump the Band" merely asked audience
members to call out their favorite tunes,
"Spin the Dial" involved picking a radio sta
tion at random and performing whatever
song happened to be playing.
"Every time we do something random its
the most chancy part of the show because a
lot of times I think it really grinds to a halt,"
Linnell said. "Other parts of the show are
much less spontaneous, hut they're much
more dependable."
110 beards no ski caps
It's the chancy, however, and not the de
pendable that has brought I'MBG much ot
the following and critical acclaim they now
enjoy. Rather than following in the well-worn
tracks of popular and money-making alter
native bands on the scene, TMBG prides it
sell on forging its own path.
"We never really, fortunately, are able to
get a real grip on exactly what it is we're
doing, in terms ot the scene," Linnell said.
"We're just doing it to please ourselves, and I
think we have a very hard time trying to con
sider our exact position in the Pantheon, or
what have you.
"What we do is our own bag, we certainly
are not tailoring it to 'the scene."
Linnell went one step further, admitting
that he felt almost completely out ot touch
with "the scene" itself.
"We're kind of outside ol 'the scene* — I
mean, 1 don't even really know what 'the
scene' is," he said. "I feel like at some point re
cently I passed the age where I even know
what's going on anymore.
"I notice that there are a lot of bands now
with little beards, and they have this particu
lar way of dressing, you know, much more
uniform than it used to be" Linnell added,
"They wear little ski caps and things ... so I

just feel like an old man now."
Despite their move toward a more con
ventional band, Linnell has no worries that
TMBG will blend into the uniformity of
sound characteristic of much of today's "al
ternative" genre.
"We don't want to sound the same as
everyone else, but 1 think that that would be
difficult anyway," he said. "Unless for some
perverse reason we decide to sound exactly
like some specific other band, it doesn't seem
very likely that we'd end up sounding like
anyone else."
In fact, it's probable that TMBG's unusual
sound can be linked partially to Linnell'sown
varied musical influences.
"The way I picture my own interest in
music is sort of like a tree that grows," Linnell
said. "The trunk is basically the Beatles and
everything comes out of that, and that's just
because I was born in 1959. For me, that's
where it's at, so that obviously leads me to a
lot of things that are extremely far away from
the Beatles, in terms of influences, but that's
kind of where it all started."
Linnell also cites such an eclectic group of
artists as the Meat Puppets, the dß's and Phil
Ochs as influential in the development ot
TMBG's distinctive sound.
Because of TMBG's position "outside ot
the scene," their lyrics are also immune to the
confinement of collective interpretations
forced upon mass-marketed, popular alter
native hits, Linnell said.
"I think if you like it, then you understand
the point of it,"he explained. "It says syme
thingto 1 the listener]. Maybe it's not 100 per
cent obvious or easy to put into words, but it
you like it, then it must have some meaning."
TMBG's lyrical flexibility allows their
words to be interpreted philosophically, or to
simply reflect the spirit of the moment — as
in the inspiration for the title of their current
tour, "I Should Be the Loudest Thing."
" There's a song on the new record called 'I
Should Be Allowed to Think' and when we

were mixing it we started singing other ver
sions of it," Linnell remembers. "And when
you have your musicians assembled in the
control room, there's a tendency for every
body to want themselves to be the loudest."
