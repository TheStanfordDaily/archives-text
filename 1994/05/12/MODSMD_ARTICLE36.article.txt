# Gleaming in the gloom
## Good acting and authentic settings shine in 'Germinal' 
### 
In "Germinal," director Claude Berri ex
changes the bright Mediterranean landscapes
of Marcel Pagnol's "Jean de Florettc" and
"Manon des Sources" for the dark, bleak skies
of northern France. The film is based on Emile
Zola's epic novel of the same name about a late
19th century coal-mining community.
The film begins with a passing worker, Eti
enne Lantier (the singer Renaud, in his first
major acting role) entering a coal-mining
community and lodging with a miner, Maheu
(Gerard Depardieu), and his wife (Miou-
Miou) and family. Lantier struggles to orga
nize the miners, ground down by appalling
work conditions and rapacious management.
Ignoring the dark warnings of Souvarine,
an anarchist intellectual in the village,
Lantier enthusiastically but naively leads his
fellow workers a doomed strike for a better
deal. Their defeat and subsequent return to
work is marked by a mine disaster, engi
neered by the departing Souvarine (the
scenes of flooding tunnels had a certain,
chilling poignancy for this English viewer, at
least, in the week that the Chunnel — Chan
nel Tunnel — was opened).
The French government gave Berri a mas
sive state subsidy to make what has proved to
be the most expensive French film ever made.
Voreux, a deserted mining village in what was
the heart of France's mining community near
Lille, was used as the film set. Recent decades
have seen the closure of many of the mines
which made this region one of France's in
dustrial heartlands.
The sets and props were researched with
the meticulous care which Zola himself de
voted to his novels. Extras for the film were
largely drawn from ex-miners and their fam
ilies. In everything to do with the mine and
its workers, the film exudes authenticity.

Zola's novel is regarded as a French social
ist classic and was famous in its time for
bringing the miserable plight of the miners to
public attention. The film ends with a ringing
affirmation of the future of the labor move
ment, as better times germinate in the blood
soaked soil. Beleaguered Socialist president
Francois Mitterrand attended the French
premiere of "Germinal" last year. The open
ing of the film stimulated some lively politi
cal controversy: some conservative politi
cians attacked the film for presenting a bad
image of French industry.
Despite the controversy, the film more or
less covered its costs from box office sales in
France alone. Germinal represents a serious
effort to produce a French blockbuster of
Hollywood proportions. The attempt to
transform a work close to the heart of the
French Left into a Hollywood epic-cum-dis
aster movie takes its toll.
Thus, the film is longer on melodrama
than politics. The middle class characters
come straight out of the Karl Marx Coloring
Hook of Capitalist Villains and act with the
wooden conviction of Hollywood soap op
eras— a genre which is unaccountably, mas
sively popular on French television.
Despite its would-be message of hope, the
political outcomes depicted in the film are al
most unrelentingly depressing. The strike is a
total failure, many of the central characters
are killed and the strike action by the miners
is portrayed as mob brutality — complete
with the ritual castration of a corrupt shop
keeper. The story seems to say more about
the personal obsessions of Zola and Berri
than about socialist ideals.
The acting in the main roles rises well
above the script. Miou-Miou in particular, in
a "Mother Courage" role, is quite stunning

and Depardieu, predictably, is as good as
ever. But the main character is the mine, with
its apparently insatiable lust for human flesh.
Whether captured, as in the opened shoe,
with its pit-head fires gleaming against the
dawn sky or in the final scenes of pit flooding
and collapsing masonry, Voreux is shown
dictating the lives and hastening the deaths of
the working miners. Berri's direction, aided

by the brilliantly evocative photography of
Yves Angelo, makes the mine the star of the
show — just as it made the provincial land
scapes the most memorable feature of "Jean
de Florette" and "Manon des Sources."
The film, overall, certainly does not lack
faults. But there is more than enough talent
on display to transcend the gloom.

"Germinal" is a French movie, so it must be Gerard Depardieu. His strong performance
helps add a touch of authenticity to director Claude Berri's film adaptation of Emile
Zola's classic novel.
