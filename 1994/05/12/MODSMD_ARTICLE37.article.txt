# Being Human

### 
With some movies you need to hunt for
meaning. You look at repeated themes, vague
references, tiny clues and hidden innuendo.
You consider camera angle, narrator per
spective and dominant color. If the film
seems really obscure, you search the person
al history of the director or screen writers.
With the new Robin Williams' flick, try
looking at the title.
"Being Human" is about, well, being
human. It looks at four short stories of men
named Hector in different time periods,
from a few thousand years B.C. to about 1600
A.D. It then combines these seemingly un-

connected snipets
into a brief New
York tale of a di
vorced father
spending a week
end with his es
tranged kids.
There are no gold
nuggets here. Each
of the four pream
ble stories consid
ers rather basic
human needs —
family, freedom,

reconciliation and company. For freedom
the story is of a slave in ancient Greece, rec
onciliation takes place on the coast of Africa
with a shipwrecked crew of travelers.
The four, while sometimes both humor
ous and poignant, have no thematic connect
ing threads. Certain motifs are repeated, like
water, shoes, rocks and omens, but taken as a
group the four just sit there like lumps of
flour in an unmixed batter.
That would make the final story like some
sort of beater or whisk that blends everything
together. Within the tale of the estranged fa
ther, each of simple themes of the earlier stories
reappears, but in a more complicated setting.
The weekend at the beach house they visit
is then their somewhat awkward reconcilia
tion. The grand unification then is the end of
the last story and the film, and each tale
Williams tells his children about life rests
undisturbed within this "rope of infinity."
The movie itself, however, remains convo
luted. It inspire thoughts like, "What's the
point?" during most of the movie to "That's
a rather simplistic message," by the end.
Williams is interesting, but stripped of his
most potent weapon — his humor.
Overall, "Being Human" is a film that
makes you wonder why we humans pay so
damn much for mediocre movies.
