# When a Man Loves a Woman
## 
### 
Take two jiggers of vodka. Add the perfect
husband, two cute kids and a tipsy Meg Ryan.
Shake well. Serve with lots of Kleenex.
That's the recipe director I.uis Mandoki
used to mix "When a Man Loves a Woman," a
tear-jerking tale of alcoholism and family up
heaval starring Ryan and Andy Garcia.
When we first meet Meg, she seems to have
the perfect life: a charming San Francisco
house (complete with Amnesty International
sticker), a beamer, a caring and good-looking
husband, cute kids and a job teaching school.
She also has a little secret. Koo-koo-kachoo.
After a few too many liquid lunches, Meg
slaps her daughter and takes a trip through a
plate glass shower. Hubby Garcia bundles her
off to a sylvan rehab center. Meg dries out, and
that's when the trouble begins.
When she returns to her family, Meg can no
longer get along with the excruciatingly perfect
Garcia. After series of his-and-her AA and
Alanon meetings, the two go splitsville and
Garcia moves away to Denver.
This less-than-happy ending is one of the
strong points of the movie. Indeed, the film
manages to avoid many of the cliches one

might expect from I lolly wood — life isn't sud
denly perfect after Meg clambers on the wagon,
indeed in some ways it gets worse.
Still, the viewer too often gets the feeling of
watching an ad for residential rehab or pop
psychology. The movie bogs down when it gets
more caught up in group therapy, enabling and
eodependency than the emotional dimensions
of the family.
Ryan, in a well-performed dramatic role, is
especially convincing in the movie's post
rehab scenes. Supporting actress Lauren Tom
does a wonderful turn as housekeeper Amy.
Garcia's acting is wooden, at best.
Overall, however, the movie is only slightly
above average. While the family conflict is dra
matic and emotional, too often the film feels
like propaganda for 12-step recovery programs.

this is for you.

time.
