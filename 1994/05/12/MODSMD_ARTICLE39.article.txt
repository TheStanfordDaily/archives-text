# The
						voodoo child of blues
## 24 years after his death, Jimi Hendrix bares his soul 
### 
They say to be a bluesman you've got to
sell your soul to the devil — but whether or
not Jimi Hendrix went down to the cross
roads, he is the true voodoo child of the
blues. Hcndrix's hard-driving, spacey music
and other-world spirituality rocked America
and Britain and eventually the world before
his untimely death in 1970. His unique
fuzzed-out, phased-out guitar tone and fluid
playing has been (unsuccessfully) repeatedly
mimicked and imitated since his death. What
Hendrix wannabes often miss, and what
made Hendrix such a fantastic player was his
reverence for the traditional blues.
Before he achieved solo fame, Hendrix
played rhythm guitar for some of the greatest
R&B musicians of the time, and jammed
with many of the blues greats with whom he
was recognized as a young talent.
While his classic LPs like "Are You Experi
enced" don't highlight his obvious blues in
fluence, the latest MCA (digitally remas
tered) Hendrix re-release, "Jimi Hendrix:
Blues" is an album entirely devoted to 11 rare
studio and live tracks of I Jendrix jamming in
his best blues form.
The album opens with Hendrix mournful
ly hacking an acoustic 12-stringon "Hear My
Train A Comin' " — anticipating the stun
ning and climatic last work on the album, a
very electric version of the same song. This
cut of rare, acoustic Hendrix shows a side that
is often lost in the waves of distortion and dis
sonance that can surround his music.
The album proceeds to concentrate most
ly on Hendrix's slower blues tunes, but the
second cut is an up-tempo version of Booker
T. Jones and William Bell's "Born Under A
Bad Sign." This song is best known for the
early '70s Cream version with Eric Clapton
on guitar, which explains why this Hendrix
version wasn't released until now — it has far

more soul than any work Clapton has ever
done. Since Hendrix and Clapton shared a
common British market, it simply wouldn't
have been good public relations for the two
blues artists to compete with the same song.
The album next gives us a short but classic
version of "Red I louse," I lendrix's slow blues
masterpiece. Seven tracks later, an extended
version of the song shows up with a rare elec
tric organ addition under the title "Electric
Church Red House." The concept of an
"Electric Church Red House" — a song
whose resolving lyric is, "If my baby don't
love me /1 know her sister will" — is an in
teresting duality that can be found through
out blues tradition. Here it results in an ex
tremely powerful and religious sounding
"Red House" (and I've heard at least 10 dif
ferent versions) that highlights the church
roots of the blues.
"Voodoo Chile Blues," is a fairly tradition
al blues tune that Hendrix takes and makes
his own. Like its lyrical namesake — the epic
tune from "Electric Ladyland" — "Voodoo
Chile Blues" takes us into the mystical world
of Haitian black magic voodoo and crosses it
with a deep delta blues feel to create an eerie,
atmospheric, enveloping tune.
The rarest cuts are "Mannish Boy," and
"Jelly 292," a pair of bouncy blues takes that
I Jendrix laid down in the studio but never re
leased. While "Voodoo Chile Blues" has a
more haunting feel, the pressure of "Man
nish Boy" and the immediacy of "jelly 292"
show different rhythmic aspects of Hendrix
while varying from the deep blues.
The final cut, the electric take of "Hear My
Train A Comin' " begins with 1 Jendrix singing
traditional call and response licks in conjunc
tion with his guitar and continues into one of
the most phenomenal Hendrix jams I've ever
heard — a perfect closer to the album.

Since his death, Hendrix has been criti
cized for everything from his drug use to his
new-age spirituality, yet nobody comments
on the quality of his music — it's immortal.
Though many discount Hendrix as a true
blues player, this album will shed the light of

Hendrix's true calling on any listener's ear.
Hendrix wasn't simply about noise and feed
back and kissing the sky — he was a dedicat
ed, powerful and uncommonly magical
bluesman.
