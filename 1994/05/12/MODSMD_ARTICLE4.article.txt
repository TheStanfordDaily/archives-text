# It don't matter if you're black or white
## Dean Michael Jackson discusses diversity, life 
### Marc Lee Staff writer 
The Memorial Church Side
Chapel echoed with the candid
words of Dean of Students Michael
Jackson, who spoke informally
about his life and guiding philoso
phies with an intimate crowd yes
terday afternoon.
In the talk, Jackson shared his
experience in encountering diversi
ty and how it has shaped his ap
proach as a dean. The event was
sponsored by several graduate orga
nizations as part of a biweekly dis
cussion series in which Stanford ed
ucators discuss what is important
to them.
"I was the first black to integrate
that school," Jackson said of the all
white, upper-class boarding school
he attended on a scholarship in his
youth.
Jackson said that, at the time, he
didn't even know what a boarding
school was. His attendance not only
exposed the students there to peo
ple of other cultures, but it also al
lowed Jackson to "pave the way for
other blacks, Chicanos and Asian-
Americans."

Jackson also met diversity
through his family's religion, the
Baha'i faith, which is subscribed to
by a spectrum of ethnic groups.
Jackson cited several of its tenets,
among them the equality of men
and women and religious toler
ance.
He said, moreover, that al
though his parents were divorced,
they taught him to have "positive
relationships with people" and to
understand where others are
coming from. When on the way to
visit a family friend, his parents
would brief him on the friend's
background so that Jackson could
engage in intelligent conversa
tion.
Jackson went on to explain that
he learned activities such as
bridge, tennis and golf from his
stepfather, who emphasized the
necessity of knowing about the
arts and of being able to relate to
wealthy people through what he
called "life-long games well-to-do
people play." Meanwhile, he
learned "what the streets were
about" from his father, who
taught him how to shoot pool,
bowl and read the sports page.
"From the very beginning of
my life, I've been exposed to a wide
variety of people," Jackson said,
summing up many of his experi
ences and explaining how they
have helped him deal with people,
institutions and even with last
week's demonstration by Chicano
students.
Jackson, with Director of the
Office of Multicultural Develop
ment Sally Dickson, served as a
link between the protesting group
and the University president and
provost. Noting the way he was
characterized by one of the
protesters, Jackson said, "I'm not
the messenger boy, I'm the
bridge."

He also commented on the
vibrant dialogue that diversity cre
ates in the University as a whole.
"We're trying to redefine our
relationships with one another
from a variety of different perspec
tives. Our colleges sometimes
seem to be battlegrounds, for bet
ter or worse, as we discuss and
struggle with important ideas that
relate to improving society," he
said. "It is necessary and vital con
frontation."
Jackson said the University
brings together students of all back
grounds and says to each of them,
"This is your place." In accord with
that mission, Jackson said his goal
is twofold: to help people hear what
others are trying to tell them and to
foster mutual respect.
Asked how he can tirelessly
maintain his role as a bridge of
communication without feeling
trampled on, Jackson responded,
"I see it as my calling."
