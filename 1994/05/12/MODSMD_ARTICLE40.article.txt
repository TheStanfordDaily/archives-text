# Johnny Cash "American Recordings"

Although Johnny Cash's "American
Recordings" is not your average college rock
album, and Cash is seemingly lacking in tal
ent with guitar or voice, he puts them togeth
er, creates an image and a mood, and gives us
a strangely addicting album. His folk tunes
draw up images of a crackling camp fire, days
gone by and forgotten American hopes, fears
and morals. He captures an era when there
was hope in the West, mighty trains to take
you there, and an ever-present God to be
thankful to.

lie touches on is
sues ranging from the
appreciation of what
God has given us, the
alienation of Viet
nam veterans, and
whether men should
cry, all the way to
having shot woman
Delia just because she
was "mean."

He sings "The first time 1 shot her, I shot
her in the side /1 couldn't stand to see her suf
fer, so 1 shot her again and she died." I lis work
is filled with such basic rhymes. Cash's whole
style is one of simplicity — his plain scratchy
voice, and his simplistic guitar playing. In the
jacket liner, Cash writes some of his musical
biography. He describes his guitar vision
when he was young to "lead with the thumb
and occasionally let the fingers crash into the
strings to accent the rhythm." With "Ameri
can Recordings," he shows that he has per
fected this art to such a degree that he taps
into a beat which is quite soothing to the soul.
The best songs on the album occur when
Cash gets a little adventurous and deviates
from the formula used in 10 of his 13 songs.
There are African-American spiritual influ
ences in the song "Thirteen," and the upbeat
country song "Tennessee Stud" — where his
voice picks up a twang and he begins to sound
like a caller — is the best song of the album.
"American Recordings" not only trans
ports one back to "Good old fashioned Amer
ican Values," but the simple and heart felt
music pervades a refreshing optimism and
pride in the United States and our history.
