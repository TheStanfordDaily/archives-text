# Elastica "Line Up"
## 
### 
Just as Suede and its decadent music have
established a following here in the States,
word of the newest British glam-rock sensa
tion Elastica has made its way across the At
lantic. With the release of a four-song, eight
minute debut EP, "Line Up," we Yanks get to
hear what all the hype is about.
This time around, the easily-excitable,
monolithically powerful British music press
hits the mark with its lavish praises on Klas
tica. About the only thing disappointing
about "Line Up" is that it's so short.
And, interestingly enough, that's part of
Elastica's attraction: each of their meager
collection of tunes is short and sweet and
smutty. Take the title track "Line Up" as an
example. This paean to the groupie proves to
be a more perfect pop-song than even
Suede's "Metal Mickey." From the sparse gui
tar riffing at the introduction, Elastica
flaunts its raucous charm. Soon, a thick bass
line adds to the sound, moving the song to
the point where guitarist/vocalist/front

woman Justine Frischmann chimes in with
her Blondie-esque voice.
It's from Frischmann's voice that Elastica
attracts with cute, lewd charisma. Each lurid
lyric is delivered with a tongue-in-cheek
humor that makes for a raucous ride. For in
stance, when she sings, "Drivel head knows all
the stars / Loves to suck their shining guitars,"
Frischmann smirkingly casts a disapproving
look on groupiedom. Throw in a catchy, la-la
chorus and the listener is hooked.
The EP's three other songs turn out to be
even shorter than the first, yet they all some
how seem complete in their one to two
minute lengths. The third track, "Rockun
roll," stands out as another charming track.
Its simple guitar work proves to be the most
interesting of the four songs: a faux-harem
music guitar intro leads into a din of crunchy
guitar and crisp bass rhythm. Interspersed
are plenty of hummable "ooh-ah's" and "la
laTa's" cooed by Frischmann.
Until Elastica releases a full-length album
or at least a couple more singles, this four
song piece will do nicely. Let's hope they're
whetting our appetites for something bigger
and even better.
