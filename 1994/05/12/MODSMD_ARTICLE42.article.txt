# Pizza with pizazz: part two
## The 						good, the great, the phenomenal Story and graphic by Rafe Sagarin 
### 
So last week we established that
pizza is good, that pizza in Califor
nia is not as good as pizza in New
Haven, hut better than many places
and still good enough to be a major
part of our diets. Fortunately, it's
easy to find decent pizza in Palo
Alto and even better, this week's re
view covers only the good stuff.

(939 Fl Camino Real, Mountain
View)
Of all the joints I tried, Frankie's
definitely boasts the best atmos
phere. And good, fresh ingredients
and lots of love are put in every pie.
I eat it, I like it, but an hour later I'm
not still raving about it, and I 'm not
devising ways to get The Daily to
spring the bill for the next round.
Nonetheless, I'll highly recom

mend this place on grounds of the
overall experience.

like the crust. Very
flavorful. The sauce-

is not bad, but unfortunate

too much cheese — a minor
(law. Applewood's menu

features a variety of specialty pies
which contain interesting and unusu

and cheeses. The great majority of

these toppings are excellent, so even if
you picked one at random you'd
probably

be very
satisfied.

La Pizzeria (in La Casa Italiana, on
the Row at Stanford)
It" you want good pizza and a

good time you don't
even have to go off
campus. No, I'm not
talking about Late
Night at Stern, little
freshpersons! I'm

talking about Casa Italiana on Sat
urday nights, when the dining
room is transformed into a cheesy
Italian restaurant, complete with
red and white tablecloths and over
ly-friendly waiters. The best thing
about this place, in my mind, is
that the pizza chefs actually throw
the dough up the air, like a real,
back-east pizzeria. I highly recom
mend the garden-style pizza. La
Pizzeria is on campus so you won't
need a designated driver, but if you
want to get good and silly as you
satisfy your pizza cravings you
should brown-bag your wine, be

cause it doesn't have a liquor li
cense.
N.Y. Pizza (325 Hamilton Avenue,
Palo Alto)
In the four years since I expatri
ated to California, I have not found
better pizza than the mini pizzas at
N.Y. Pizza. The crust is pure plea
sure. Well formed and flavorful,
not too dense, not so thick that it
tastes like bread, but not so thin
that y'all from west of the Missis
sippi will complain. The sauce has
found that delicate balance be
tween spicy and sweet. The cheese


is not overdone, as is often the case
in other area joints, allowing sweet
magmatic intrusions of crust to
bubble up to the top. And the fresh
ness and quality of the toppings is
superb. I highly recommend the
fresh tomato and onion mini pizza,
which costs merely $3.00.
But, as is often the case in the
East, good pizza and elegant at
mosphere don't go hand in hand.
So while you may not want go on a
romantic first date to N.Y. Pizza, if
you want the best pizza in the area,
this is definitely the place to go. Be
sides, who needs a date when you
have good pizza? ■
