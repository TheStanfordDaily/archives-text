Backßeat
"Backßeat" is a Beatle movie even
the most fickle fan will enjoy. De
spite a few historical inaccuracies,
director lain Softley does an ad
mirable job of reconstructing the
band's early days in Hamburg when
the Fab Four were the Fab Five. Of
note are the live music scenes
which capture what it must have
been like to see the Beatles before
they got big R
Bad Girls
The title says it all: "Bad Girls" really
is bad. Despite vaunting itself as the
first female-centered frontier shoot
'em up, director Jonathan Kaplan
does nothing more than crib scenes
from classic Westerns that fill the
movie with aimless action. So don't
let its claim to the top spot at the box
office fool you — after all, "Ace Ven
tura" was there for multiple weeks. R
The Favor
What happens when you still lust after
your high school honey? That's the

question "The Favor" seeks to answer
with a convoluted Gordian knot of situ
ations. However, anyone with a work
ing knowledge of "Three's Company"
or "Bosom Buddies" can figure out
just what's going to happen. But to
give "The Favor" its proper credit, the
movie does have its moments. R
Four Weddings and a Funeral
"Four Weddings and a Funeral" ac
tually lives up to the hype as a
crowd-pleasing comedy. While it
may not explore the deep meaning
of life, the flick serves up breezy
tun with inspired comedy. The de
lightful cast, featuring Andie Mac-
Dowell and the omnipresent Hugh
Grant, does a good job of moving
the movie along. R
The House of the Spirits
In a poor imitation of a fantastic, fan
tastical novel, an über-cast of Jere
my Irons, Glenn Close, Winona
Ryder and Meryl Streep can't seem
to capture any of the sentiment of
the original text, based on author !s

abelle Allende's own life and up
bringing in Chile. It's a long, some
what painful and tragic corruption of
the novel; save your $7 and buy the
book! R
No Escape
Ray Liotta goes from mob hench
man-in-hiding in "Goodfellas" to an
"aversive to authority" criminal ex
iled on an island in the futuristic "No
Escape." OK, the premise might be
a tad hokey, but the movie does
supply some good, fast-paced ac
tion scenes. Still, if you're looking for
something brainy, stay away from
this flick. R
Serial Mom
Kathleen Turner is evidently having
fun playing the part of a psycho
everything-is-not-dandy-a-la-Nor-
man-Rockwell Serial Mom in this
new, well-endowed John Waters
flick. It's a parody of suburban
America (typical Waters fare) with an
added bonus of a "Basic Instinct"
style courtroom gag. While not alto

gether a phenomenal work, it's
worth seeing. R
Threesome
Just as "Reality Bites" ends its run at
the theaters, "Threesome" comes
along to fill that college movie void.
The '90s-style love triangle which the
movie revolves around does explore
timely issues, but falls into some of
the stereotypes it wishes to break.
But on the whole, "Threesome"
proves to be an entertaining romp
through ivory tower wonderland. R
With Honors
In a year of mediocre college
movies, "With Honors" graduates
in the middle of its class. Yes, it's
another one of those which shows
how a bookworm (Brendan Fraser)
learns lessons of life from an oh
so-wise homeless guy (Joe Pesci).
To make matters worse, director
Alek Keshishian milks as much
humor out of the relationship as he
can rather than focusing on more
evaluative situations. PG-13
