Also, catch these if you can:
✓ Go to the city and check out the ACT's production of David
Mamet's "Oleanna." The story of an encounter between a college
professor and a student which leads to sexual harrassment charges
should make for thought-provoking entertainment. Call 749-2228 for
info.
✓ Dorm theatre doesn't always have to be silly. This year's West La
gunita Hall production, "Stories of the Human Heart," should be
worth your while. Billing itself as "a musical revue about love, loss, re
lationships and life," the staff has put its own twists on popular musi
cals. Performances begin tonight and run through Saturday. All
shows are at 8 p.m. in the Lagunita dining hall and are free.
