# Task force urges language combo
## New H & S unit would include Classics and Comparative Lit. 
### Linda Friedlieb Editorial staff 
Eight language and literature
departments may be combined
into a single administrative di
vision if a proposal developed by
a University task force is imple
mented — a possibility causing
some consternation among fac
ulty.
The proposal is a compromise
between the administration and in
dividual departments in that it
"grants a considerable amount of
autonomy to each department, es
pecially with graduate studies,"
said Michael Predmore, chair of the
Department of Spanish and Por
tuguese.
Under "A Proposed Restruc
turing of the Language and Litera
ture Departments," the Asian
Language, Classics, Comparative
Literature, French, German Stud
ies, Italian, Slavic Language and
Literature, and Spanish and Por

tuguese will be combined under
one administrative unit, Pred
more said.
At the same time, each depart
ment will maintain its own chair
and significant decision-making
power, he added.
The proposal is the concluding
effort of a task force convened earli
er this year by Humanities and Sci
ences Senior Assoc. Dean John
Etchemendy in an attempt to
achieve budget reductions and in
crease interest in foreign lan
guages.
French and Italian Depart
ment Chair Ralph Hester, a
member of the task force, said
the next step for the deans of Hu
manities and Sciences is to meet
with faculty members in the de
partments before constructing a
final plan.
"I'm rather optimistic that we
can come to a final plan by the end
of the year," he said. "But I may be
overly optimistic since there are a
lot of faculty who don't know very
much about the plan."
Prof. Jeffrey Schnapp, chair of
the Department of Comparative Lit
erature, said he forsees a great deal
of concern on the part of faculty. "I
feel like I think most people do,
quite mixed about the proposal," he
said. "I think there will be a lot of
opposition within the depart
ments."
Within his own department,
Schnapp said he realizes there is
concern about "autonomy."
"Comparative Literature has
been ranked No. 1 in the country
and attracts phenomenal graduate
students," he said. "There are
some colleagues who feel that any
thing that decreases the indepen
dence of the department could
harm it. There are others who feel
that some of the language depart
ments have some problems and we
would like to play a constructive
role in helping solve them."
According to Predmore, the task
force has now disbanded. "We have
formally voted our approval to the
document as a working draft," he
said. "Now, what Dean

Etchemendy will do is go around to
the different departments and
attempt to answer questions and
gather input."
Etchemendy is out of the coun
try and could not be reached for
comment yesterday.
The last meeting of the task
force was attended by both Dean of
Humanities and Sciences John
Shoven and Provost Condoleezza
Rice. "They expressed their good
will and good feelings. They
expressed their satisfaction that
progress has been made," Pred
more said.
When the task force commenced
its examination of the language
departments fall quarter, concern
among faculty and administers in
the departments arose over the dif
ficulties in administering a large,
combined department and the pos
sible neglect of students that could
result.
"We wanted to retain our
departmental identity and we don't
know how to mix [the eight depart
ments] together," Predmore said,
pointing out that the new proposal
would allow individual depart
ments to retain control over their
graduate studies. "We think what
we have in this new division is a
structure which will allow suffi
cient decentralization."
Hester said the new structure
would allow each department "to

retain their own identity and sepa
rateness" as well as decreasing
some of the administrative burden
on faculty.
The proposal, Predmore said,
also suggests the establishment of
a language center with a director
who would "presumably be a good
advocate for languages at Stan
ford."
According to Predmore, certain
aspects of the combined adminis
tration could be in effect as soon as
next fall. However, he said the com
plete plan cannot be enacted until
the departments gain space in
which they can cohabitate.
"The key thing is that we can't
put this into place in the absence of
our building," Predmore said. The
Language Corner of the Quad,
Building 260, was damaged during
the 1989 Lomita Prieta earth
quake. Since then, the language
departments have been housed
individually in various temporary
quarters around campus.
One of the goals of the new
structure, according to Predmore,
is an "interactive undergraduate
program that will increase enroll
ment" in language courses.
However, according to Schnapp,
the intellectual goals and many of
the details of the proposal have yet
to be determined. "The devil is in
the details," he said, quoting bil
lionaire Ross Perot.

Prof. Jeffrey Schnapp, chair of
the Department of Comparative Lit
erature, said he forsees a great deal
of concern on the part of faculty. "I
feel like I think most people do,
quite mixed about the proposal," he
said. "I think there will be a lot of
opposition within the depart
ments."
Within his own department,
Schnapp said he realizes there is
concern about "autonomy."
"Comparative Literature has
been ranked No. 1 in the country
and attracts phenomenal graduate
students," he said. "There are
some colleagues who feel that any
thing that decreases the indepen
dence of the department could
harm it. There are others who feel
that some of the language depart
ments have some problems and we
would like to play a constructive
role in helping solve them."
According to Predmore, the task
force has now disbanded. "We have
formally voted our approval to the
document as a working draft," he
said. "Now, what Dean

Etchemendy will do is go around to
the different departments and
attempt to answer questions and
gather input."
Etchemendy is out of the coun
try and could not be reached for
comment yesterday.
The last meeting of the task
force was attended by both Dean of
Humanities and Sciences John
Shoven and Provost Condoleezza
Rice. "They expressed their good
will and good feelings. They
expressed their satisfaction that
progress has been made," Pred
more said.
When the task force commenced
its examination of the language
departments fall quarter, concern
among faculty and administers in
the departments arose over the dif
ficulties in administering a large,
combined department and the pos
sible neglect of students that could
result.
"We wanted to retain our
departmental identity and we don't
know how to mix [the eight depart
ments] together," Predmore said,
pointing out that the new proposal
would allow individual depart
ments to retain control over their
graduate studies. "We think what
we have in this new division is a
structure which will allow suffi
cient decentralization."
Hester said the new structure
would allow each department "to

retain their own identity and sepa
rateness" as well as decreasing
some of the administrative burden
on faculty.
The proposal, Predmore said,
also suggests the establishment of
a language center with a director
who would "presumably be a good
advocate for languages at Stan
ford."
According to Predmore, certain
aspects of the combined adminis
tration could be in effect as soon as
next fall. However, he said the com
plete plan cannot be enacted until
the departments gain space in
which they can cohabitate.
"The key thing is that we can't
put this into place in the absence of
our building," Predmore said. The
Language Corner of the Quad,
Building 260, was damaged during
the 1989 Lomita Prieta earth
quake. Since then, the language
departments have been housed
individually in various temporary
quarters around campus.
One of the goals of the new
structure, according to Predmore,
is an "interactive undergraduate
program that will increase enroll
ment" in language courses.
However, according to Schnapp,
the intellectual goals and many of
the details of the proposal have yet
to be determined. "The devil is in
the details," he said, quoting bil
lionaire Ross Perot.
