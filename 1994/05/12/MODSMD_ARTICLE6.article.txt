# 'State of the University'
## Casper will review events of the year 
### Andy Dworkin Senior staff writer 
Gerhard Casper will celebrate
his cotton anniversary as Stan
ford's president with his second
State of the University address
this afternoon at 4:15 in Kresge
Auditorium.
The president will discuss the
events of the past year and the in
fluence of politics on the Universi
ty in a speech titled "The Univer
sity in a Political Context."
The political portion of the
speech will discuss "the way that
politics can work with and in
fringe on the processes of the Uni
versity," said Director of Univer
sity Communications Terry Shep
ard. Casper will mention both
Stanford's relationship with the
federal government and last
week's hunger strike in the Quad,
he said.
Increased student activism, as
demonstrated by the strike, is
just one factor that has made
Casper's second year in office a

year of struggle and change. Over
the past three quarters, Universi
ty administrators have worked to
resolve financial disputes with
the federal government and cut
millions of dollars from the bud
get.
At the same time, the Commis
sion on Undergraduate Education
has spent the year reevaluating
undergraduate teaching and
learning.
The education commission was
announced at Casper's first State
of the University address. Shep
ard said Casper will make another
such concrete announcement this
year, although the project will be
less sweeping in scope.
Casper was chosen to be Stan
ford's ninth president March 17,
1992, replacing outgoing Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy.
He took charge Sept. 1, 1992, and
was inaugurated Oct. 5 of the
same year.
KZSU radio, 90.1 FM, will
broadcast the speech live, with
commentary.
