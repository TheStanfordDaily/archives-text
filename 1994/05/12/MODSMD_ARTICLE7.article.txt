# Ceremony kicks off Roble sculpture project

After four years of planning, a Stan
ford "first" officially got underway with a
ceremony in front of Roble Hall yester
day.
On Monday, a team of 10 artists from
Papua, New Guinea began carving a
sculpture garden of intricately designed
wooden poles — the brainchild of Stanford
graduate Jim Mason.
Said Stanford Museum of Art Director
Tom Seligman at the opening ceremony,
"This is probably the most ambitious and
complex outdoor (art) project undertaken
here — also the first non-American or
non-European one."
Mason, who did graduate work in the
Sepik River region of Papua, New Guinea,
worked to raise $170,000 dollars for the
project. He also coordinated the efforts of
the 10 master carvers from the Hamul
and Koma areas, as well as one American
and one New Guinean architect. The
group will be on campus until the begin
ning of September.
The team shipped all of their materials
for the sculpture garden, including the
wood, from Papua New Guinea, said
group translator Kowspi Marek.
"We use New Guinea mahogany, the
hardest white wood we have," he said.
"The trees came with us. We're sorry
we'll have to leave them behind — but

when we go, they won't be trees any
more."
The sculptures, which are expected to
stand for at least 50 years, tell stories
based on traditional legends, clan myths
and village history, Marek said Some
carvings tell one story; others tell up to
five on a single piece of wood.
A sculpture by artist Teddy Balangu,
for example, depicts the story of a woman
in a fishing village who would secretly don
the head of the crane so she could dive
deeper and catch more fish than any of the
other villagers. Most of the carvings in the
project portray human and animal fig
ures.
After the completion of the carving, ar
chitects Kora Korawali — an instructor at
the University of Technology in Lae, New
Guinea — and Wallace Ruff — a retired
professor from the Oregon School of Ar
chitecture — will landscape the area in
which the sculptures will stand, Seligman
said.
"This is not a project to recreate some
thing in New Guinea — we fully recognize
that [this] is a different community and it
is a different project," he said.
He added that the sculpture garden of
fers an opportunity to experiment within
the new context of western art and land
scape architecture: "This intercultural
artist exchange is something that no one
knows what the outcome will be," he
said.
