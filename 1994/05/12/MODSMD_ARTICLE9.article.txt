Car chase ends in Palo Alto
A Stanford alumnus led police on a 65 mile
per-hour car chase down Palm Drive early Sun
day morning, ending up in jail after a brief physi
cal confrontation.
Larry lam Nelson, a 24-year-old Berkeley resi
dent, was first observed speeding and running
stop signs on Campus Drive West at about 9 a.m.,
said Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
His Honda almost went airborne at the pedes
trian speed bump located in front of the Stanford
Hospital, according to Niemeyer.
When Stanford Police Sgt. Rick Tipton stopped
the car in the area of Lomita Drive, Nelson
allegedly refused to show his driver's license and
said he did not believe Tipton was a real police
officer, according to Niemeyer.
At the time of the incident, Tipton was driving
a white unmarked police vehicle equipped with
red lights and sirens. He was dressed in standard
police uniform.
After making another comment "relating to
sexual activity," Nelson sped off toward Palm
Drive — where he was reported to have reached
speeds of up to 65 mph, Niemeyer said.
Five patrol cars — from Palo Alto, East Palo
Alto and Stanford — joined the pursuit as Nelson
wove in and out of traffic on University Avenue in
downtown Palo Alto.
Nelson eventually stopped at the University
Avenue and Hale Street intersection, where he
got out of his vehicle and "fought the officers
tooth and nail," Niemeyer said.
During the skirmish and subsequent arrest,
Nelson allegedly shouted various racial and sexu
al slurs at the officers, kicking one in the knee and
threatening to kill another and her family,
Niemeyer said.
Nelson was arrested for felony and misde
meanor counts of reckless driving, as well as for
two misdemeanors: failure to yield to an officer
and failure to show his driver's license.
Currently a graduate student at UC-Berkeley,
Nelson graduated from Stanford in 1992 with a
degree in biological sciences.
Midnight caller
An unknown suspect has been trying to gain
access to student rooms by calling and pretending
to be a Stanford maintenance worker.
Two Ujamaa House residents, both female,
reported receiving calls at around 2 a.m. Tuesday
morning from a man claiming to need access to
the building so that he could fix their sinks,

Niemeyer said.
After both women toid the man there was no
problem with their sinks, the suspect said that
there could be a problem with the toilets. Both
women hung up on the caller and phoned the
police, according to Niemeyer.
One of the women was called by name,
Niemeyer said. Police are searching for suspects.
Could you spare a twenty?
A "scam artist" who has operated in the Stan
ford area for three years has been making easy
money off of the trust of the Stanford communi
ty, police said.
The suspect claims to be a University employ
ee and then asks people for money to pay for car
repairs or gas, according to Stanford Police Detec
tive Tim Schreiner.
The most recent reported incident occurred on
April 15 in Escondido Village. The suspect report
edly asked resident Heinz Pley for $10 to pay for
gasoline. "He's really convincing — otherwise I
wouldn't have given him the money," Pley said.
The man — who was wearing dark blue pants,
shirt and cap similar to the uniform worn by
Stanford maintenance workers — showed Pley a
California driver's license with the name of Alvyn
C. Butler.
After later sighting the suspect, Pley confronted
him about the money. He claimed to be on his way
to see Pley to explain why he could not pay him
back. Pley requested to see Stanford identification
from the man, who said that he had left it in the car.
Police believe the suspect to be a 5-foot 8-inch
tall black male with receding hair that is closely
cut. He is in his 40s and weighs about 190 pounds.
Grading report available
Copies of the report of the Committee on Aca
demic Appraisal and Achievement will be made
available to the public when it is published in the
May 18 edition of Campus Report, according to
committee chair Gail Mahood, a geology professor.
The report recommends the movement of both
the add and drop deadlines to the third week of
every quarter and the addition of failing grades to
the transcript, as well as a modified policy on
retakes. The report also recommends that the
deadline for declaring the pass/no credit option
each quarter shift to the sixth week.
Mahood said students who are interested in
reading the report can obtain copies of Campus
Report at their departmental offices.
