Stanford by Amy Biehl's family and friends in recognition
of her commitment to improve conditions of the people in
South Africa.

Department of History and the Haas Center for Public
Service, is offering a $3000 fellowship to a student
interested in studying South African issues either in South
Africa or the United States. The fellowship is open to all
undergraduates who will return to campus for at least one
year after the fellowship to share what they have learned
with other students.
Application Deadline: May 23, 1994
