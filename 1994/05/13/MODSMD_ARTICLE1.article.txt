# Casper: politics and academia don't mix
## 
### Andy Dworkin Senior staff writer 
University President Gerhard Casper
lamented the interference of politics with the
academic process and fiercely defended the in
dependence of higher education in yesterday's
State of the University speech.
In an address to 400 faculty, students, staff
and alumni in Kresge Auditorium, Casper
warned that political pressure from outside

and inside Stanford often hampers Stanford's
ability to choose and vigorously pursue the best
academic programs.
Stressing the academic autonomy of col
leges, Casper recalled former Supreme Court
Justice Felix Frankfurter's definition of "four
essential freedoms" for higher education. The
University, Casper said, must move to preserve
these freedoms, "to determine for itself on aca
demic grounds who may teach, what may be
taught, how it shall be taught and who may be

admitted to study."
The president's address sent a message to
the state and federal governments that recent
increases in regulation — such as stricter ac
creditation procedures and state environmen
tal regulations — increase red tape and de
crease the amount of resources spent on acade
mics, as well as the freedom to allocate those
resources as the University sees fit.

can Studies program outside the Law School. A number of demonstrators later entered and disrupted the meeting, forcing the Senate to an
early adjournment.
