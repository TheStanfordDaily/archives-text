# Casper: politics and academia don't mix
## 
### Andy Dworkin Senior staff writer 
University President Gerhard Casper
lamented the interference of politics with the
academic process and fiercely defended the in
dependence of higher education in yesterday's
State of the University speech.
In an address to 400 faculty, students, staff
and alumni in Kresge Auditorium, Casper
warned that political pressure from outside

and inside Stanford often hampers Stanford's
ability to choose and vigorously pursue the best
academic programs.
Stressing the academic autonomy of col
leges, Casper recalled former Supreme Court
Justice Felix Frankfurter's definition of "four
essential freedoms" for higher education. The
University, Casper said, must move to preserve
these freedoms, "to determine for itself on aca
demic grounds who may teach, what may be
taught, how it shall be taught and who may be

admitted to study."
The president's address sent a message to
the state and federal governments that recent
increases in regulation — such as stricter ac
creditation procedures and state environmen
tal regulations — increase red tape and de
crease the amount of resources spent on acade
mics, as well as the freedom to allocate those
resources as the University sees fit.

University President Gerhard Casper walks into yesterday's Faculty Senate meeting past a crowd of protesters demanding an Asian-Ameri
can Studies program outside the Law School. A number of demonstrators later entered and disrupted the meeting, forcing the Senate to an
early adjournment.
While the University agrees with
the ends of environmental regula
tions, Casper said California's regu
lations have been designed for
industrial pollution and create
reams of unnecessary paperwork
when applied to universities.
"It is the country that will suf
fer if the research enterprise is
smothered by red tape," he said.
The president also decried revi
sions to the Higher Education Act.
Casper said these changes could
increase government regulation of
schools with troubled student
loan programs. The act also
defines standards which accredit
ing organizations must use when
they approve colleges, he said.
"The final, joint product of the
new laws and regulations is a
greatly expanded oversight struc
ture for higher education that

draws states into new policing
roles as federal deputies, substan
tially federalizes an already
flawed accreditation system and
arrogates to federal officials sig
nificant decision-making authori
ty over the four freedoms of a
university," Casper said.
Casper also stated that internal
politics should not dictate the aca
demic policy of Stanford, referring
to last week's hunger strike by
Chicano students. The president
pointed out that he and the hunger
strikers had been able to come to
terms, but stressed that the
response to the protest came with
in "the University's constituted
processes for making decisions."
"We cannot work for Stan
ford's future in an environment
dominated by the politics of ulti
matum," Casper said. "If we
shortcut argument and reason,
we abandon the essence of the
University. If universities make
their substantive decisions for
political rather than academic

reasons, they have no claims for
untrammeled existence."
Casper used yesterday's
address to announce a new com
mittee on technology and review
the events of the University in
the past year.
The Commission on Technolo
gy in Teaching and Learning will
be a standing committee that will,
beginning in the fall, examine
educational technology — such as
"programmed computer instruc
tion, global electronic networks
[and] interactive multimedia" —
and make recommendations to
the administration on a technolo
gy policy. The committee arose
from a recommendation of the
technology subcommittee of the
Commission on Undergraduate
Education, chaired by Engineer
ing Prof. John Bravman, Casper
said.
Casper stressed, however, that
he did not want Stanford to
"become a 'virtual' university,"
drawing laughter from the audi

ence.
In reviewing the events of the
year, Casper concentrated on Uni
versity successes, detailing a bevy
of awards earned by faculty and
students and a number of major
donations to Stanford. The presi
dent also pointed to "quiet work"
on "issues of diversity," such as
the appointment of Sally Dickson
as director of the Office for Multi
cultural Development and work
on the recruitment and retention
of female and minority faculty.
Other bright spots in the past
academic year include the work of
the Commission on Undergradu
ate Education, an agreement
with the government on pay
ments for damage from the 1989
Loma Prieta earthquake, a new
faculty conflict of interest policy,
successful recruitment of new
faculty, a structural overhaul of
the Medical Center and a federal
grant to develop a $177 million
particle collider at the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center.
