# Senate votes to lift arms embargo
## Clinton opposed to acting without U.N. and NATO support 
### 
WASHINGTON (AF) - The Senate
voted to require President Clinton to lift
the arms embargo against Bosnia yes
terday, but muddied the action with a
contradictory directive to first seek the
support of other nations.
With back-to-back 50-49 votes on
competing amendments that made up a
Bosnia bill, senators first directed Clin
ton to seek a U.N. termination of the
embargo and then added language
ordering him to go it alone.
Sen. John Warner, R-Va., called the
outcome farcical.
"It shows you the ineptitude of the
United States Senate at times in giving
direction on foreign policy. . . . We
sound an uncertain trumpet in the ears
of those suffering in Bosnia," said
Warner.

Only six other senators joined Warn
er in voting against both approaches to
lifting the embargo, and Bosnia-Herze
govina's ambassador to Washington
counted the 92 senators who voted for
one or the other approach as a strong
endorsement for arming his country
against Serb aggression.
"We consider this a big step forward
to finally having our rights to defend
ourselves," said Ambassador Sven Alak
laj, who witnessed the vote from the
Senate gallery.
Senate Democrat and Republican
leaders disagreed on the vote's impact.
Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell, who faced surprising biparti
san opposition to his efforts to save the
president from the embarrassment of
having to veto a measure he supports,

said the vote "makes clear there is not
going to be unilateral action by the
United States to lift the embargo."
Clinton supports a lifting of the
embargo but is against doing it without
U.N. and NATO support.
At the White House, Press Secretary
Dee Dee Myers reiterated yesterday
that "the president does not support
unilaterally lifting the arms embargo."
"What it says it that the Senate
favors an end to the embargo . . . but is
equally divided on the question of how
to do it," Mitchell said after the votes.
He said the bill had virtually no pos
sibility of becoming law.
No Republicans voted for Mitchell's
approach, but 13 Democrats voted with
Sen. GOP leader Bob Dole of Kansas
who backed the unilateral embargo.
