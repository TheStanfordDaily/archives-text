## A
						graceful solution 
### 
IT IS SEPTEMBER 1994. You
are a member of the Class of
1998, and, like many freshmen,
you decide to enroll in Chem 31,
the introductory chemistry class.
You hike over to Braun Audito
rium on the first day, but you can't
find a place to sit — or stand —
anywhere in the room. The place is
packed with more upperclassmen
retaking the class than usual.
Welcome to the proposed one
year "grace period," which could
become part of the new grading
policy under consideration by the
Faculty Senate. Current students
would be given a year to retake
classes without the feared "repeat"
mark on their transcripts.
As the Faculty Senate's Com
mittee on Academic Appraisal and
Achievement fine tunes its pro
posed grading policy, it should con
sider extending this grace period
for the sake of all students — both

new and old.
The one-year provision would
without a doubt be a relief to many
students, who would try to cash in
as much as possible before the old
policy expires. If passed, such a
short grace period, however, would
flood "gatekeeper" classes next
year as grade-conscious upper
classmen shoot for higher grades
when they have the chance; section
sizes and the quality would suffer.
In addition, the one-year
allowance may be useless to those
who are going overseas or have
conflicting schedules.
The C-AAA should be com
mended for the proposing the
grace period, but the current sug
gestion could create more prob
lems than it solves. A two-year
period — giving students twice as
much time to retake classes taken
before the next academic year — is
a reasonable compromise.
