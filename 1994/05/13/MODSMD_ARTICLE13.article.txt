# On distributing DRs
## 
### 
AS THE COMMISSION on
Undergraduate Education
prepares to issue its find
ings on distribution requirements,
it should take care to address not
only what kinds of requirements
to have but also how courses are
certified as satisfying them.
The process as it is now is com
pletely backward. Currently, pro
fessors and departments nominate
courses which they feel may satis
fy a DR. The Faculty Senate Com
mittee on Undergraduate Studies
examines the nominations, and
then decides whether or not to cer
tify these courses.
Thus, whether a course fulfills a
DR is not simply a matter of its con
tent — it is a matter of the profes
sor's initiative and will. A course
may easily satisfy the criteria for
DR certification, but if a professor
doesn't want to submit a proposal,
then the course isn't certified.
Moreover, because certification
is not done on a yearly basis, a

course may change instructors
and content and still be certified.
It would be much more logical if,
instead of relying on a professor's
initiative, or prerogative, the com
mittee conducted a thorough review
of all classes every year to see which
ones satisfy the requirements.
While this system would give
the committee more work, it
would save many professors the
trouble of dealing with students
who petition to get a non-certified
class count toward a requirement.
Some professors may grouse
that certifying their courses as ful
filling DRs will cause them to grow
in enrollment, but this is not like
ly to be a problem. If more courses
fulfill DRs, the average enrollment
in DR courses will drop.
Instituting a certification sys
tem that judges courses strictly on
their content would go a long way
in providing students with a fair
system that truly introduces them
to a broad range of fields.
