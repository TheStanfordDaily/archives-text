## Stewart Richardson Two decades of change on the Farm 
### 
MY PARENTS were married in
the church on the corner of
Stanford Avenue and Bowdoin.
Both had attended Stanford and I practi
cally grew up on this campus. I went to
Stanford football games (after AYSO soc
cer) before John Elway's college career
had begun.
I remember the character of the stu
dent section during the late '70s and
early '80s — packed with fans who sup
ported terrible teams and appreciated the
craziest band in the country, students
who loved their school, drank beer sold at
the stadium, maintained countless ritu
als like the key jingling that still goes on,
played pranks and terrorized visiting
teams' fans. These were Stanford stu
dents. They were accomplished enough to
go to Harvard, but they wanted a real col
lege experience rather than four years of
pure academics. They were my heroes; I
wanted to be one of them.
I moved on to boarding school, where
we drank in dark, quiet rooms — some
times, literally, in the closet. We grew up
in a pressure-filled academic setting
where fear of being caught was the only
thing worse than going 10 weeks in a row
on three hours of sleep per night. I
watched friends withdraw, be expelled
and try to commit suicide, sometimes
succeeding. If you thought someone was
about to die from alcohol poisoning, you
wouldn't tell an adult, you'd tell a senior.
The adults were the enemy. I was one of
the unlucky ones who got caught; I didn't

get to go through graduation or attend
the Senior Prom — but I got my diploma
by mail and I had been accepted to Stan
ford, the place I loved, "the Farm."
The students at the Farm I knew were
fiercely individualistic and the adults
believed in the students. Academic free
dom and trust were substantial; the Uni
versity fought for the principles of per
sonal autonomy and responsibility. The
drug and alcohol policy informed stu
dents of local laws but did not impose
specific values on students. Above all, the
Farm was a friend: the residence staff
and administrators served the students
as resources, not police.
The Farm no longer exists as an insti
tution committed to these principles. I
attend Stanford, a school where individu
alism and personal freedoms are being
abolished. Administrators advocate a pol
icy by saying that it brings us "in line"
with comparable institutions; Stuart
Reges is fired for stating his beliefs on
drug use; the student who buys a keg of
beer is responsible for the student who
drinks irresponsibly; smoking is banned
in an outdoor stadium where beer is no
longer sold; fraternities are terrorized by
committees because some people don't
like them; and political convictions are
subject to community approval. Stanford
is now a school with a tolerant face and a
conformist soul.
Administrators are no longer
resources; like at the boarding school I
attended, they are becoming the enemy.

According to administrators I've spoken
to, in private meetings Vice Provost and
Dean for Student Affairs Mary Edmonds
has expressed her desire that residence
staff take on enforcement responsibili
ties, that the campus be alcohol free, and
that all of the dorms be identical in char
acter. Fraternal Affairs Adviser Heather
Dunn (when she is not serving on self
important committees which decide
whether a dorm had a water fight) fines a
dorm for chalking White Plaza. Another
administrator charges a student $500 for
keeping a dog in her room for five days.
Who cares?
From University President Gerhard
Casper on down, Stanford is being run by
administrators who were not students or
teachers here — they know nothing
about the Stanford culture which they
are destroying. They do know that people
like Cecilia Burciaga — who has been
here for two decades and is a major part
of the community — will not fit into the
new, impersonal Stanford.
However, the students bear as much
or more responsibility for the demise of
the Farm. Students of the '90s, of the
recession, of the drug war. Students who
follow. Students who are so mature and
responsible, it's hard to know whether
they're alive. The top-drawing residences
are new, antiseptic structures where the
rooms (preferably singles) and common
areas are quiet on Saturday nights; these
