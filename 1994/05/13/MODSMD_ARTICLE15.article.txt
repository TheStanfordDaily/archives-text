# Letter
## Chicana students respond to critic of racial division 
### 
WE ARE writing in response to
Anastas Hadjiev's letter that
was printed May 9 in The Daily.
Let us begin by saying that we are not
only disgusted by your letter but also
deeply saddened because we feel that
you are clearly ignorant about the issues
at hand. But rather than resort to our
first instinct, which was to dismiss you
and classify you as an ignorant individu
al, we have opted to take time to enlight
en you.
• First, we would like to express our
sorrow that you feel left "out in the
cold" and discriminated against. But
welcome to reality — that is exactly how
many of us have felt our entire lives.
• You said on your first day at Stan
ford you were exposed to the Black
National Anthem and you felt upset that
the woman was so disturbed that you
did not know the words. Frankly, we sin
cerely doubt the comment was aimed to
you.
• You also said every day you must go
through the Zapata Dining Hall and be
subjected to a faceless white woman. We
have one question for you: have you ever
read the description that lies beside the
mural? It explains the significance of
the woman, who by the way is supposed
to represent the Chicana woman, who
has given in to the white standard of
beauty, rather than accept herself for
who she is — a beautiful and intelligent
human being. The woman is faceless
because she has lost her identity.
If you cannot appreciate the aesthet
ic value behind this, then I am sad
dened by your intolerance. Further
more, it is not meant to be discrimina
tory, but rather intellectually stimulat
ing. You say your heart bleeds, well our
hearts bleed just as much when we see
students just like you making assump
tions about who we are and what we
stand for.
Our hearts bleed when people yell
"Go home beaners" and "Give grapes a

chance."
• You think that our hunger strike
was "unreasonable." Well we think it is
unreasonable for a university to lure
students with promises of "multicultur
alism" and "diversity" and then turn
around and deplete the few resources
that would help legitimize that claim.
• You "suppose" Cecilia Burciaga
was highly respected? Allow us to tell
you that she is more than highly
respected, she is loved. Furthermore, it
is not our fault that no one says any
thing about the other layoffs, if any
thing our public display of anger at her
layoff is testimony to what she has done
for us, not only Chicano/a students but
also others at this University. If you are
upset about the other layoffs, then I
suggest you do something about it.
Don't criticize others for taking
action, rather look inside yourself and
question why you so easily accept
things.
The color of Burciaga's skin had
nothing to do with why we were upset.
It had to do with what she has con
tributed for the past 20 years and also
what is in her heart, compassion and
love. Furthermore, think about why no
one said anything about the white peo
ple who were fired. Do you really think
it was because they were white? We do
not. It is just a lot more noticeable
when a Chicana woman is lost because
there are so few of them here at Stan
ford.
Our community has no other option
but to feel attacked. When a Chicana
woman is lost, the loss is felt every
where, because Chicanos are not the
majority. In addition, Cecilia did accept
her layoff, it was the students who did
not. Cecilia is more than qualified to
work anywhere in this country — a job
at Stanford is not going to make or
break her. It will, however, affect those
of us who will lose her mentoring and
guidance.

• No, it is not enough that Stanford
students volunteer. It will never be
enough. Why, you ask? Because stu
dents not only volunteer, but they also
conduct research experiments on pover
ty, homelessness and ethnicity while in
East Palo Alto. In addition many citi
zens from East Palo Alto are the same
individuals who cook your food, vacuum
your carpet and clean the restroom you
bathe in.
We are not providing these people
"with employment," but rather they are
providing us with services that you
could not live without.
We are perpetuating the attitude
that it is OK to take, take, take.
Sounds pretty selfish to us. By the way,
the money for the community center
would not come out of your father's
pocket. We are looking for ways the
University can help us identify possible
funds, perhaps through the develop
ment office.
• We are pleased, if not ecstatic, that
you have not yet eaten a grape. We
appreciate it. But that is only because
Stern is aware of the issues surround
ing grapes and is decent enough not to
serve them. However, you are complete
ly ignorant if you think that Chilean
grapes are any better.
Grapes grown in Chile are even
worse than those grown here, because
in Chile the regulations for pesticides
are at the bare minimum. Migrant farm
workers exist everywhere, even in
Chile, and we are also fighting for
them. It isn't an issue of locality, it is
an issue of humanity.
• The issue of Chicano Studies is
important to us because there are a lot
of people out there, just like you, who
make assumptions without knowing the
issues. If there were a Chicano Studies
program, perhaps you would be more
enlightened and speak intelligently and
back up your statements with facts —
not empty opinions. We never said that

there should only be a Chicano studies
program; in fact; we believe that there
also should be a Asian-American Stud
ies program. If you have been keeping
up with the events you would know
that we fully support the Asian-Ameri
cans in their endeavors.
Another point is that the classes
aren't only offered to Chicano students.
We are not discriminatory; in fact, we
would be delighted if others learned
about our culture, issues and struggles.
Perhaps then they would understand
why we feel as strongly about them as
we do.
• Of course the whole student body
doesn't stand behind us, just like the
whole student body doesn't stand
behind you. We don't expect them to. It
is also quite foolish to use the loss of
the MEChA special fee as an indicator
of whether students support us. A bet
ter indicator would be the amount and
variety of students that showed their
support while we slept and fasted out in
the Quad.
In closing we would just like to state
that we are saddened that you are
speaking out of ignorance. We are even
more distressed that you feel the
hunger strike was unnecessary. Per
haps instead of criticizing, you should
look inside yourself.
The people who went on strike did it
because they sincerely care about the
issues and believe in them so much
that they were willing to put their
lives on the line. How willing would
you be? If anything we think these
men and women should be applauded
for standing up for what they believe
rather than digging their heads in the
sand, like so many people do. Welcome
to America. It is not all stars and
stripes.
