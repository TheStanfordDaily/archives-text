## With friends like me, who needs enemies? 
### 
As far as friends go, I'm the worst. I
don't call. I don't visit. 1 don't send
sassy Bookstore cards on red-letter
days.
I don't drop by on my way to La maze
class and 1 don't cut out wacky Sunday
morning cartoons that remind me of our
unhealthy fascination with butt-crack
jokes.
Ding-dong, Avon Lady.
So when I saw him from 100 yards
away, riding his bike up the hill next to
Meyer, panic set in. I looked for the near
est manhole I could crawl down. I looked
for some nice, perky foliage to serve as
camouflage. I snapped my newspaper
open to hide my face, my shame, my
months of friend-neglect.
Would he see me? Would he stop?
Would he pretend not to see me and look
down at the ground as we passed? Would
he run me down with his nobby-tired
mountain bike, whip out a bowie knife
and feed me my steaming entrails as I
slowly lost consciousness from excessive
blood loss?
Take a Valium.
My heart raced. My muscles tensed. I

began to lose bladder control as he
neared, wondering just how far I had let
our friendship slip. I batted around the
possibilities, bracing myself for the worst.
There's nothing to fear but fear itself.
With each forceful pedal, I grew more
and more afraid. Last year we lived in the
same dorm. Last year I used to ask him
for love advice. Last year I would go to
him in terrified stupors, begging him to
tell me I never had to grow up. Last year
I used to make unfounded comments
about his penis in front of mutual friends
he expected to get a little respect from in
the future.
This year our contact has been dis
tilled to the very essence of random acts
of social terrorism. Me running into him
on the way to some class. Him running
into me on the way Dack from some inter
view. Me bumping into him at some
body's party we both managed to have
the time to hit. Him catching me taking
the walk of shame across campus from
some lust interest du jour's dorm as the
birds sang to the rising sun.
Take no prisoners.
It was never that I didn't want to talk

to him. I always thought about calling
him. Leaving the confines of my morgue
like dorm for the variety of his morgue
like dorm. Kicking my atrophied social
skills off the couch and inviting him to go
California-poppy picking and risk the
wrath of hundreds of dollars of fines for
the sake of camaraderie.
But I couldn't bring myself to do it.
Where was the time if a thesis chapter
was due in a week, a column due in an
hour and an interview was popping up
tomorrow? It was the same with all my
friends. It was always a few dinners fall
quarter. It was always a few hurried
lunches winter quarter. It was always a
few chance meetings by spring and come
the next fall, they were all missing in
action, like navy-blue power suits in the
department stores come interview time.
Call me, we'll do lunch.
A significant other here. A dorm across
campus there. Soon all the good friends
I'd made, all the nights discussing femi
nine hygiene products and the mass mur
derers in our freshman dorms were shot
to hell. If we lived in the same dorm, on
the same floor, in the same room, we

were OK. Otherwise societal norms
bodyslammed us to the ground.
Shouting in our faces that real friends
would call every day, every week. Poking
our eyes saying that real friends would
know every smile, every bad eyebrow day,
every bowel movement, every breath a
friend took. Kicking us in the ribs
screaming that real, true, important
friends knew birthdays, anniversaries,
mid-term schedules and menstrual cycles.
Is this the real life, is this just fantasy?
But we couldn't do it. We all had
places to go, people to see. Little, metal
ringed daily planners filled with meet
ings, job fairs, harmonic convergences.
We had new dorms and new schedules
and we'd never be able to keep up an inti
mate world tour to touch base with each
friend each week.
So I gave up. I decided that if they had
all forgotten me, I couldn't let them down
any more than I already had. I'd send
them a Christmas card next year. I'd give
them a sloppy, wet kiss when I saw them
at graduation. I'd read about them and
their wiener-dog farms in 10 years in the
alumni magazine.

Dogged.
When I harvest my belly button lint
late at night, I wonder how they're doing.
1 wonder if they understand that I didn't
mean to flake. I wonder what they think
of me. I wonder who will be left to be a
pen pal after college is over.
As it turns out, my friend took 20
quality minutes to walk me to the post
office, to my work and to a meeting. He
laughed at my jokes about being poor,
homeless and unemployed in a month. I
laughed at his suggestions, solutions and
nauseatingly bright future. I looked at his
face and knew he was still my friend.
We promised to call each other before
graduation, but we won't. Maybe I'll run
into him across campus. If only I had
understood senior year would be so fran
tic, I wouldn't have resigned myself to
missing him earlier.
A toast, to absent friends.

Tish would like to thank the person who
sent her mom flowers for Mother's Day.

friends knew birthdays, anniversaries,
mid-term schedules and menstrual cycles.
Is this the real life, is this just fantasy?
But we couldn't do it. We all had
places to go, people to see. Little, metal
ringed daily planners filled with meet
ings, job fairs, harmonic convergences.
We had new dorms and new schedules
and we'd never be able to keep up an inti
mate world tour to touch base with each
friend each week.
So I gave up. I decided that if they had
all forgotten me, I couldn't let them down
any more than I already had. I'd send
them a Christmas card next year. I'd give
them a sloppy, wet kiss when I saw them
at graduation. I'd read about them and
their wiener-dog farms in 10 years in the
alumni magazine.

Dogged.
When I harvest my belly button lint
late at night, I wonder how they're doing.
1 wonder if they understand that I didn't
mean to flake. I wonder what they think
of me. I wonder who will be left to be a
pen pal after college is over.
As it turns out, my friend took 20
quality minutes to walk me to the post
office, to my work and to a meeting. He
laughed at my jokes about being poor,
homeless and unemployed in a month. I
laughed at his suggestions, solutions and
nauseatingly bright future. I looked at his
face and knew he was still my friend.
We promised to call each other before
graduation, but we won't. Maybe I'll run
into him across campus. If only I had
understood senior year would be so fran
tic, I wouldn't have resigned myself to
missing him earlier.
A toast, to absent friends.

As far as friends go, I'm the worst. I
don't call. I don't visit. 1 don't send
sassy Bookstore cards on red-letter
days.
I don't drop by on my way to La maze
class and 1 don't cut out wacky Sunday
morning cartoons that remind me of our
unhealthy fascination with butt-crack
jokes.
Ding-dong, Avon Lady.
So when I saw him from 100 yards
away, riding his bike up the hill next to
Meyer, panic set in. I looked for the near
est manhole I could crawl down. I looked
for some nice, perky foliage to serve as
camouflage. I snapped my newspaper
open to hide my face, my shame, my
months of friend-neglect.
Would he see me? Would he stop?
Would he pretend not to see me and look
down at the ground as we passed? Would
he run me down with his nobby-tired
mountain bike, whip out a bowie knife
and feed me my steaming entrails as I
slowly lost consciousness from excessive
blood loss?
Take a Valium.
My heart raced. My muscles tensed. I

began to lose bladder control as he
neared, wondering just how far I had let
our friendship slip. I batted around the
possibilities, bracing myself for the worst.
There's nothing to fear but fear itself.
With each forceful pedal, I grew more
and more afraid. Last year we lived in the
same dorm. Last year I used to ask him
for love advice. Last year I would go to
him in terrified stupors, begging him to
tell me I never had to grow up. Last year
I used to make unfounded comments
about his penis in front of mutual friends
he expected to get a little respect from in
the future.
This year our contact has been dis
tilled to the very essence of random acts
of social terrorism. Me running into him
on the way to some class. Him running
into me on the way Dack from some inter
view. Me bumping into him at some
body's party we both managed to have
the time to hit. Him catching me taking
the walk of shame across campus from
some lust interest du jour's dorm as the
birds sang to the rising sun.
Take no prisoners.
It was never that I didn't want to talk

to him. I always thought about calling
him. Leaving the confines of my morgue
like dorm for the variety of his morgue
like dorm. Kicking my atrophied social
skills off the couch and inviting him to go
California-poppy picking and risk the
wrath of hundreds of dollars of fines for
the sake of camaraderie.
But I couldn't bring myself to do it.
Where was the time if a thesis chapter
was due in a week, a column due in an
hour and an interview was popping up
tomorrow? It was the same with all my
friends. It was always a few dinners fall
quarter. It was always a few hurried
lunches winter quarter. It was always a
few chance meetings by spring and come
the next fall, they were all missing in
action, like navy-blue power suits in the
department stores come interview time.
Call me, we'll do lunch.
A significant other here. A dorm across
campus there. Soon all the good friends
I'd made, all the nights discussing femi
nine hygiene products and the mass mur
derers in our freshman dorms were shot
to hell. If we lived in the same dorm, on
the same floor, in the same room, we

were OK. Otherwise societal norms
bodyslammed us to the ground.
Shouting in our faces that real friends
would call every day, every week. Poking
our eyes saying that real friends would
know every smile, every bad eyebrow day,
every bowel movement, every breath a
friend took. Kicking us in the ribs
screaming that real, true, important
friends knew birthdays, anniversaries,
mid-term schedules and menstrual cycles.
Is this the real life, is this just fantasy?
But we couldn't do it. We all had
places to go, people to see. Little, metal
