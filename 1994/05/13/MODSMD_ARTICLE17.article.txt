## Batters look to clinch Six-Pac Cardinal needs only one win over Arizona State for title 
### Andy Eiser Senior staff writer 
Three chances to win one.
Facing the final and perhaps most difficult
obstacle in its bid to capture the Pacific 10 Confer
ence Southern Division crown, the No. 12 Cardinal
baseball team travels to Tempe, Ariz, this weekend
needing one victory in a three-game series with the
llth-ranked Arizona State Sun Devils.
By virtue of a two-game lead accumulated with

15 wins in its last 18 conference
games, Stanford (35-20, 20-7 in
the Six-Pac) enters the Six-Pac
Championship showdown at
Packard Stadium with the upper
hand. The Cardinal has not been
swept in conference play this sea
son, and the Sun Devils (37-15, 18-
9) would have to win tonight,
tomorrow night and Sunday after
noon to steal the title.

But while losing two of three enables Stanford to
complete a "worst-to-first" turnaround from its 10-
20 conference record last year, Cardinal players
hope to ride the momentum of a modest four-game
winning streak and end the regular season on a
roll.
"We're just taking it as another [Six]-Pac
series," said junior leftfielder Steve Carver. "We
won't be satisfied unless we win at least two."
"Our goal is to win the series," added senior des
ignated hitter Nate Olmstead. "We can't take any
game less seriously."
Stanford has good reason to maintain playoff
like intensity, as the NCAA announces the eight
sites for this month's College World Series Region
als Monday morning. While the Six-Pac champion
has hosted one of two West Regionals for the past
several seasons, the Cardinal, with a mediocre 15-
13 non-conference record, presents a borderline
case to the selection committee.
However, two or three convincing victories over
an Arizona State squad that has spent most of the
season in the top 10 would change all that.
"I don't care if we clinch it [the championship]
in the first game, the third game or the second
game," said Stanford head coach Mark Marquess.
"We need to win as many as we can."
With winning early and often as its goal, the
well-armed Cardinal, which took two of three in
the teams' first meeting at Sunken Diamond in
February, faces a classic "great pitching versus
great hitting" matchup with sweet-swinging Ari
zona State.
Sophomore left-hander Dan Reed (10-3) toes the
rubber for Stanford tonight, and his attention will
be focused on an Arizona State lineup that leads
the conference with a lofty .335 batting average
and which dominates nearly every statistical cate
gory.
Junior centerfielder Jacob Cruz leads the hit
parade, pacing the Sun Devils and the Six-Pac with
a .407 average and 90 hits. Junior first baseman
Damon Lembi trails not too far behind, hitting
.376, good for second in the conference and one
point ahead of Olmstead.
But Cruz and Lembi merely set the table for
National Player of the Year candidate Antone
Williamson. A junior third baseman who figures to
be picked early in the first round of next month's
professional draft, Williamson hits .361 and leads
the Six-Pac in RBI (66) and doubles (19), while
appearing in the top five in home
runs, triples, hits, runs, walks
and slugging percentage.
With Arizona State's big guns
in place behind him, junior right
hander Billy Neal (6-4) starts
tonight opposite Reed, who
sports a perfect 8-0 Six-Pac
record after a complete-game win
over UCLA last Saturday.
Cardinal sophomore Todd Bar
tels (6-3), who has yielded just
nine walks in 75 innings this year,
draws Sun Devils freshman Kaipo
Spenser (9-0) tomorrow night,
while Mizuno National Player of
the Week Jason Middlebrook (7-
1) looks to continue his hitless
innings streak Sunday opposite
freshman Jason Bond (5-2).

Clara earlier this year. Reed, 10-3 on the year, can clinch a Six-Pac
title for the Cardinal if he wins on Friday.
