# He's a traveling man
## Lanning takes year off from school, looks at his life, his golf with new, unique perspective 
### Andrew Blachman Staff writer 
A year away from a sport, especially one
as precise as golf, could deteriorate an ath
lete's skills and make it nearly impossible
for that player to return to par.
But the story is different for Brad Lan
ning, a senior who spent last year travel
ing around the world. Instead of having a
detrimental effect, his hiatus from the
game of golf has given him a new sense of
perspective and taught him lessons which
he carries over onto the green.
During the 1992 season two of Lan
ning's teammates, Notah Begay 111 and
Casey Martin, then both sophomores,
came up with the idea of redshirting for a
season to improve their games and to con
centrate on academics.
Lanning, who wanted to play his last
season of collegiate golf with a good team,
decided to redshirt as well. As he started
to lean more and more towards a career in
golf, the Sarasota, Fla. native, saw an
opportunity to find out how much he real
ly loved the game.
"I could have spent the time getting a
masters or a double-major but I saw a
chance I couldn't pass up," said Lanning.
"I kept on thinking to myself that I'd
never have an opportunity like that
again."
So Lanning left with a friend, Ben
Mullins, a 1992 Stanford graduate, and
the two traveled together through Tahiti,
Fiji, New Zealand, Australia and Indone
sia. Then, in Singapore, they split up and
Lanning went on for another two months
on his own. He journeyed through
Malaysia and Thailand before returning
to Europe and then back to the United
States.
"The time on my own was hard but it
was definitely the best time," said the
senior. "You've got to learn how to get
from one place to the other without help.
It gives you a lot of personal strength."
Lanning said he considers that lesson
the most crucial one he took with him
back to the game of golf. "In golf, you're
out there by yourself with a goal in mind
of what you want to do and you only have
yourself to rely on," he said.
Lanning's trip also exposed him to the
poverty of some Third World countries
and helped him appreciate what he had in
the United States. This experience helped
him realize how much golf meant to him.

"The trip put a lot in perspective and
made me realize that golf is just a game,"
said Lanning. "I also realized, after being
away from golf for so long, that I really
loved the game. It's part of what I want to
do, but it's not everything."
Lanning's world travels, which he says
gave him a new outlook on life, helped him
cope with some early season struggles. He
had difficulty re-adjusting to playing golf
day in and day out and saw his stroke
average begin to climb. As the season has
progressed, Lanning cites his patience and
determination as the factors which have
brought him back to consistently strong
play.
"One of the nicest things that's hap
pened in my life this year has been to see
Brad Lanning develop," said men's golf
coach Wally Goodwin. "It's helped him as
a person and it's helped us as a team."
Now, with Lanning, Martin and Begay
all back, the Stanford golfers appear
poised to make last season's next-to-last
Pac-10 finish a distant memory. The trio,
along with juniors Steve Burdick, an Ail-
American, and William Yanigisawa, a
transfer from UC-Irvine, have put togeth
er one of the finest seasons in school his
tory. They have already won five tourna
ment titles — including the Pac-10 Con
ference Championships — and finished
second in two more.
"Suddenly, we're a very experienced
team," said Goodwin before the season
began. "This will be a team that, in my
judgment, will have to be reckoned with.
There are three Ail-Americans and two
more All-Conference performers. I think
we'll be tough to beat."
Among such highly talented players,
Lanning's leadership abilities stand out.
Though he'll be the first to admit that he
is not one of the best golfers on the team,
he contributes to success just as much off
the golf course as on it.
"As far as playing leadership, I leave
that up to the great players like Casey
[Martin] and Notah [Begay]," said Lan
ning, the team captain. "I try to help more
off the course. If the guys have something
to say I'm usually the one they come to
and then I go to the coach."
Lanning will graduate in June with a
degree in political science and plans to
play amateur golf this summer and turn
pro in August. He hopes to participate in
