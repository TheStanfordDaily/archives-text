# Bridgeman, Clark depart for Pac-10s
## Heptathlete, decathlete challenge for top honors 
### Jorge Chen Staff writer 
The heptathlon and decathlon —
track and field's ultimate tests of the
complete athlete. Two Stanford track
sters now have that heavy burden to
carry this weekend at the Pacific 10
Conference Championships for those
two events.
The two-day women's heptathlon

consists of the 100-meter hurdles,
high jump, shot put and the 200-meter
dash on the first day and then the long
jump, javelin, and 800-meter finale.
For the men, they must endure the
100-meter dash, long jump, shot put,
high jump and 400-meter dash on Sat
urday and the 110-meter high hurdles,
discus, pole vault, javelin and the
1,500-meters on Sunday.
Before the Stanford track and field

squad heads off to the Pac-10 Champi
onships on May 20-21, sophomore hep
tathlete Jackie Bridgeman and junior
decathlete Travis Clark will both pack
up and fly north for their own Pac-10
Championships held at Washington
State University in Pullman, Wash.
This weekend will only be Clark's
and Bridgeman's second multi-event
competition ever since their mid-April
debut at Sacramento City College.

Bridgeman is going into the week
end with much enthusiasm, as this
will be her first major showdown at
such a high level event.
"I am really excited to compete this
weekend and hopefully I will be able to
do well," Bridgeman said.
Bridgeman will be entering as the
seventh-best heptathlete in the confer-

ence with 4,330 points, which she
earned at the Sacramento compe
tition.
"In terms of places, I am
unsure of how people will do since
on any given day anything could
happen on any event," she said.
"If I put my stuff together, I
should be able to come close to
4,600 points this weekend." She
has been working hard to
strengthen her weaker field
events, the shot put and javelin.
On a more optimistic note,
assistant coach Mark Reiff, who
trained these athletes and will be
accompanying Bridgeman and
Clark this weekend, sees Bridge
man with a possibility of scoring
in a range of 4,700 to 4,800 points
this weekend and maturing into a
future top heptathlete.
"She can improve a little bit in
each event and as a sophomore,
she will gain much experience
needed for her to turn into a good
competitor in her future colle
giate years," Reiff said.

With three more events than
Bridgeman, Clark has a promis
ing chance to wear the conference
crown as an entering runner-up
with a high of 6,690 points, just
200 points shy of Ray Livingston
of Oregon.
"I'm really excited to be going
this weekend, it's basically the
most important meet of my sea
son," Clark said.
Competing in the event only
for his second time, Clark has
been especially working to
improve in two events.
"I really expect a lot out of
myself," he added. "I definitely
saw areas for improvement after
my first meet, the high jump and
the pole vault especially. I think I
can pick up a lot of points in
these."
Reiff agreed that one of the
keys for a successful weekend for
Clark will be the integration of
these areas with his stronger run
ning events.
"Travis is going against good
competition but if he puts it all
together, he will have a chance to
win this weekend," Reiff said.
Head coach Vin Lananna
shares the same feelings as Reiff.

"The scores going in are meaning
less as anything can happen in a
decathlon this weekend and we
have much confidence in Travis to
perform well."
Clark began as a strong high
jumper and sprinter and he
recently picked up the decathlon
last November.
"It was a big gamble for us
since he is such a strong jumper
and a fast sprinter, but Travis has
been a very well-rounded ath
lete," Lananna said.
The key to being a good multi
event athlete is being able to com
pete well in every event instead of
having strong and weak events,
and Reiff sees Clark as a good fit
for that description.
"Travis is a good decathlete
since he is consistently doing a
good job in all his events and
excels in the high jump, sprints
and the 1,500 meters," Reiff
said.
About this weekend coach
Lananna forsees "a culmination
of a whole year's worth of hard
work and attempts at first-time
events" coming together for both
Clark's and Bridgeman's showing
this weekend.

on any given day anything could
happen on any event," she said.
"If I put my stuff together, I
should be able to come close to
4,600 points this weekend." She
has been working hard to
strengthen her weaker field
events, the shot put and javelin.
On a more optimistic note,
assistant coach Mark Reiff, who
trained these athletes and will be
accompanying Bridgeman and
Clark this weekend, sees Bridge
man with a possibility of scoring
in a range of 4,700 to 4,800 points
this weekend and maturing into a
future top heptathlete.
"She can improve a little bit in
each event and as a sophomore,
she will gain much experience
needed for her to turn into a good
competitor in her future colle
giate years," Reiff said.

With three more events than
Bridgeman, Clark has a promis
ing chance to wear the conference
crown as an entering runner-up
with a high of 6,690 points, just
200 points shy of Ray Livingston
of Oregon.
"I'm really excited to be going
this weekend, it's basically the
most important meet of my sea
son," Clark said.
Competing in the event only
for his second time, Clark has
been especially working to
improve in two events.
"I really expect a lot out of
myself," he added. "I definitely
saw areas for improvement after
my first meet, the high jump and
the pole vault especially. I think I
can pick up a lot of points in
these."
Reiff agreed that one of the
keys for a successful weekend for
Clark will be the integration of
these areas with his stronger run
ning events.
"Travis is going against good
competition but if he puts it all
together, he will have a chance to
win this weekend," Reiff said.
Head coach Vin Lananna
shares the same feelings as Reiff.

"The scores going in are meaning
less as anything can happen in a
decathlon this weekend and we
have much confidence in Travis to
perform well."
Clark began as a strong high
jumper and sprinter and he
recently picked up the decathlon
last November.
"It was a big gamble for us
since he is such a strong jumper
and a fast sprinter, but Travis has
been a very well-rounded ath
lete," Lananna said.
The key to being a good multi
event athlete is being able to com
pete well in every event instead of
having strong and weak events,
and Reiff sees Clark as a good fit
for that description.
"Travis is a good decathlete
since he is consistently doing a
good job in all his events and
excels in the high jump, sprints
and the 1,500 meters," Reiff
said.
About this weekend coach
Lananna forsees "a culmination
of a whole year's worth of hard
work and attempts at first-time
events" coming together for both
Clark's and Bridgeman's showing
this weekend.
