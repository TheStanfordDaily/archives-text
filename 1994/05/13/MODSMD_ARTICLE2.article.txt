# Asian-American Studies protest disrupts Fac Sen
## Students want major to be created 
### Colleen Krueger Staff writer 
Just one week after the advent of
the Chicano students' hunger
strike, a group of students pushing
for the creation of an Asian-Ameri
can Studies program interrupted
yesterday's Faculty Senate meet
ing, leading senate members to call
for premature adjournment.
The protesters, members of a col
lective calling themselves "Con
cerned Students for Asian Ameri
can Studies," demanded that a pro
posed resolution concerning the cre
ation of an Asian-American Studies
major be placed on the agenda of the
senate's May 19 meeting.
Among the concessions the Chi
cano students won last week from
the University was the formation of
a committee to explore the feasibili
ty of a Chicano Studies program.
A multi-racial group of about 70
students, including many of the
same faces from last week's hunger
strike, crowded around the door to
the Ijaw School carrying banners
and signs chanting "Asian-Ameri
can Studies now/Not another 20
years" as faculty members entered
the meeting.
Citing frustration at the Univer
sity's perceived style of "passing the
buck" from the president to the fac
ulty to the School of Humanities and

Sciences, supporters of the program
were trying to make sure that their
initiatives were taken seriously and
addressed through the proper chan
nels, sophomore Jerry Chen said.
"This struggle has been going on
for almost 25 years, of course we're
frustrated," Chen said. "We keep
being told to talk to someone else,
but there comes a point where stu
dents' patience starts to fade and
they want to take things into their
own hands."
The addition of an Asian-Ameri
can Studies program has been pro
posed severai times since 1971. Fol
lowing an unsuccessful movement
last year, several prominent Asian-
American faculty members de
clared their dissatisfaction with
University's lack of commitment to
Asian-American Studies.
Although University President
Gerhard Casper did not address the
students before or during the meet
ing, he did engage in dialogue with
one protester following his State of
the University Address, delivered
shortly after the abridged senate
meeting.
After the meeting began, 25 stu
dents broke off from the main
group outside the Law School and
entered the meeting strategically
through a back door. The door was
opened by one of the 10 other stu
dents who were already inside, hav
ing gained prior authorization to
attend the meeting.
"I didn't know a student would
open a locked door and admit other
students — that's unauthorized
and inappropriate," senate chair
Pat Jones said. "The senate cannot
carry out its activities with that
kind of unauthorized discussion."
The students, who were told by
organizers to file in quietly, were
allowed to remain in the senate
meeting on the grounds that they
were not disruptive.
Once inside the meeting, the
protesters watched as English Prof.
Regenia Gagnier asked Casper if
Stanford could avoid the appear
ance of "crisis measures" by intro
ducing proactive measures to
address the issue of ethnic studies.
Casper, who has repeatedly stat
ed that the creation of a new pro
gram of study is a faculty issue and
must originate within the proper
school, passed the question on to
John Shoven, dean of the School of
Humanities and Sciences.

Shoven began to explain his
school's progress in exploring eth
nic studies at Stanford to the sen
ate, including several ideas of how
ethnic studies could be worked into
the curriculum. Before the Chicano
students' hunger strike, Shoven
had scheduled a meeting with stu
dents interested in ethnic studies
majors for May 27.
While the floor remained open
for questions and comments to
Shoven or Casper, senior Patty
Tsai rose to address the senate.
"We have over 700 signatures
here of students committed to an
Asian-American Studies program,"
she said. "We are willing to work
within the proper administrative
channels as long as we get the guar
antee that our resolution is on the
May 19 agenda."
After much gavel-banging,
Jones warned that she would move
for adjourning the senate early if
the interruption persisted. A few
moments later, the senate moved to
adjourn itself almost unanimously
after only about 20 minutes in ses
sion.
The senate has not adjourned
early because of a student protest
since 1986, during debates over
revamping the former Western Civ
ilization course.

The meeting adjourned before
the senate could hear annual
reports from the Disability
Resource Center and Cowell Stu
dent Health Center's Counseling
and Psychological Services.
Although the students later
issued a formal apology to both cen
ters, several senate members
approached protesters angrily after
the meeting to complain that their
disruption deprived those groups of
much-needed faculty attention.
Describing himself as "very,
very disappointed," Dean of Stu
dents Michael Jackson sat quietly
in the meeting room as faculty
members filed out or gathered in
small clusters to discuss the after
noon's events in hushed tones.
"This is not the way to go about
getting the University to react affir
matively to a proposal," Jackson
said.
As the meeting disintegrated,
several protesters seemed visibly
shaken, fighting back tears and
comforting one another. Others,
however, said they learned a great
deal and saw the protest as an
empowering experience.
"We didn't intend for what hap
pened to happen, and we think it
signals a real unreasonableness on
the part of Fac Sen," said coalition

member Davina Chen. "But the
rally was not at all a failure. We
demonstrated to the senate that
this is a very real, intellectually
viable issue that they are going to
have to deal with at some point."
Later, following Casper's State
of the University Address, the
group once again found a voice in
freshman Kris Hiyashi, who asked
Casper about the protests' inability
to exact a promise from the senate
steering committee.
"We tried to go through the
proper channels," she said. "How is
it possible to have a voice on this
campus?"
Emphasizing that University
process cannot be bullied, Casper
began by saying, "I think all of us
have to understand that if a group
that wants something very badly
does not get its way immediately, it
is not an indication of something
wrong with the process."
Casper also re-emphasized that
the School of Humanities and Sci
ences is the appropriate place for
the debate to take place.
Several coalition members
expressed disillusionment at the
senate process.
"They keep telling us, 'do your
homework, go through the proper
channels,' " Davina Chen said. "So

we try so hard to express ourselves
legitimately and we just get
ignored. What does that leave us
with?"
Chen and Ho also felt senate
rules were violated in refusing to
accommodate all interested stu
dents into the meeting either by
seating them in the senate or by
providing a room where debate can
be heard, as senate codes dictate.
"Students were called and told
that the issue they wanted to dis
cuss wasn't being discussed that
day just because they had Asian
last names," Chen said.
"I am disappointed they felt they
had to disrupt the senate function,"
Jones said. "It's very unfortunate
that they chose to do it this way —
I don't see how it will help their
cause. The faculty appreciates how
concerned they were."
Jones said she previously had
told coalition member Karen Ho, a
graduate student, that if the group
came to next Wednesday's steering
committee meeting, the issue
would be scheduled for one of the
senate's upcoming sessions.
But Ho said she was given no
such guarantee. The coalition was
told only that the steering commit
tee would consider placing their
resolution on one of several

remaining senate dates.
The group felt that the May 19
meeting presented the only real
option in terms of getting a com
mittee in place before the end of the
school year, as the new grading pol
icy is being debated on May 26, he
said.
"There are only four weeks left
of school," Jerry Chen said, "And a
lot of times things aren't done over
the summer and all the momentum
we have gained will be lost. We
want a committee in place with dis
tinct time line, something con
crete."
Chen, who has been working for
the creation of an Asian-American
Studies program for the last two
years, said he feels that "right now
there is a sense of urgency we'd like
to capitalize on while students are
still mobilized behind the issue."
In addition, the group wanted to
be assured of the faculty's support
when meeting with Shoven on May
27.
"We wanted to be able to walk
into the meeting with Shoven
knowing where the Faculty Senate
stood," Chen said, adding that the
group has now tried loudly and
publicly to make itself heard by the
president, the faculty and the
School of Humanities and Sciences.
