# Asian-American Studies protest disrupts Fac Sen
## Students want major to be created 
### Colleen Krueger Staff writer 
Just one week after the advent of
the Chicano students' hunger
strike, a group of students pushing
for the creation of an Asian-Ameri
can Studies program interrupted
yesterday's Faculty Senate meet
ing, leading senate members to call
for premature adjournment.
The protesters, members of a col
lective calling themselves "Con
cerned Students for Asian Ameri
can Studies," demanded that a pro
posed resolution concerning the cre

major be placed on the agenda of the
senate's May 19 meeting.
Among the concessions the Chi

Sciences, supporters of the program
were trying to make sure that their
initiatives were taken seriously and
addressed through the proper chan

"This struggle has been going on
for almost 25 years, of course we're
frustrated," Chen said. "We keep
being told to talk to someone else,
but there comes a point where stu
dents' patience starts to fade and
they want to take things into their
own hands."
The addition of an Asian-Ameri
can Studies program has been pro
posed severai times since 1971. Fol
lowing an unsuccessful movement
last year, several prominent Asian-
American faculty members de
clared their dissatisfaction with
University's lack of commitment to
Asian-American Studies.
Although University President
Gerhard Casper did not address the
students before or during the meet
ing, he did engage in dialogue with
one protester following his State of
the University Address, delivered
shortly after the abridged senate
meeting.
After the meeting began, 25 stu

group outside the Law School and
entered the meeting strategically
through a back door. The door was
