# Karate allows students to 'push the limit'
## Club provides simple exercise for some, self-defense for others

By day it is a regular basketball
Court, but every Monday and Wednes
day night Roble gym is transformed
into a room where entrants bow before
stepping in. During these times, the
gym serves as the dojo for Stanford
Kempo Karate, a club sport established
on campus more than 15 years ago.
The club, headed by fourth-degree
black belt Barbara Minneti, includes a
Cross section of Stanford students as
well as staff members. While some have
just begun their training and are work
ing to advance from white to orange
belt, others have been with the group
for as long as six years and have pro
gressed up to the brown belt level.
"[The club is] a very representative
group of the University," said medical
school student Max Kanevsky. "We
have both undergrads and graduates,
people from many different back
grounds, some who have done martial
arts before and some who haven't."
Participants are drawn to the mar
tjal art for many different reasons,
whether as a good endurance workout,
for strength building or just a time to
let out frustrations with some kicks and
punches.
; "I've liked learning to defend
myself," said chemistry graduate stu
dent Paula Rickert, a club member for
the past year and a half. "There's a lot
(if discipline involved as well as exercise.
Plus it's just fun, sparring is really
fun."
Many of the club members first
became involved with the club by
enrolling in the Department of Athlet
ips' karate class. With different visions
of what karate entails, sometimes
gained only through kung-fu and ninja

shows, the classes allow newcomers to
give the art a try.
"Ever since I was a little kid I liked
watching martial arts in movies," said
freshman Tim Kutzkey, a second-quar
ter Kempo student. "When I came here
I finally had the opportunity to do it.
It's a good workout, plus it's kind of like
an escape."

In addition to providing a good work
out, the Kempo style of karate empha
sizes four areas. It builds its foundation
on "basics," the movements them
selves. These moves are then applied in
self-defense techniques which are series
of more intricate sequences.
The kata builds upon these tech
niques, comprising a preset series of
movements performed by an individual.
Since the moves are open for some
degree of personal interpretation, Min
neti described the kata as the aspect
which, "allows students to show their
creativity, their fluidity of movement."
As Kempo students include both
men and women with various body
frames and sizes, the style's flexibility
makes it all the more interesting to per
form and watch.

"The style is different from other
martial arts. It's not as rigid or tradi
tion bound," said Linda Bickham, assis
tant instructor and first-degree black
belt. "Two people can look very differ
ent even when performing the same
techniques."
These style differences become
apparent when watching Rickert, a
small framed woman standing no more
than 5-feet-4, run through the move
ments in her kata. Working toward her
blue belt, she stands out as one of the
few women in the club comprised of 95
percent men.
"It would be nice to have more
women here but strength doesn't really
make a difference," Rickert said. "The
most advanced doesn't mean you have
to be strong, actually being smaller
forces you to do the technique correctly
because you have to be able to do it
against everyone, no matter how big."
After 25 years of study and four
years as the club's head instructor,
Minneti agrees that size does not make
much difference in the execution of the
art. Rather, she has developed the skills
and movements of Kempo over the
years as they best suit her. The training
has not only earned her distinctions as a
knowledgeable instructor, but she has
also gained a special confidence.
"As a woman, there's a self-defense
aspect to it," she said. "I've been hit
really hard sparring where I've been
knocked down but I know that I can get
up and respond with a multitude of
weapons. If I'm ever grabbed, there
won't be a question."
As part of their practice schedules,
club members split up into different lev
els to spar one-on-one and work on the
material required for their next belt
level. In preparation for tournaments,

the club also gathers as a whole
for sparring matches, which the
brown belts judge based on the
number of strikes delivered.
These contests require physical
prowess as well as full concentra
tion.
"There's an emphasis on
strength and endurance to some
extent, plus there's the purely
mental aspect," explained
Kanevsky. "It's not enough to be
the strongest or the quickest, you
have to feel it inside."
Under the guidance of Minneti
and Bickham, the students come
to view the art as more than just a
combination of blocks, kicks and

punches. After years of training
and practice, the two instructors
impart their own styles, integrat
ing aspects of both body and
mind.
"I look at it as much more men
tal now," said Ken Van Vleck, a
member of the Class of 1990 and
now an area lawyer. "If you watch
them, they both move very, very
well, it's a kinder and gentler
style as opposed to using a lot of
muscle."
Through teaching, both
instructors emphasized, they've
been challenged to examine their
own movements. Often their stu
dents will question the reasons
for performing throws at certain
angles or placing a kick in a par
ticular place.
The members Bickham dubbed
the club's "die-hards," the brown

and lower-degree black belt stu
dents also take on teaching roles.
As the self defense techniques
require a great deal of instruction,
the more experienced students
benefit from interactions with the
lower belts.
Whether still working to
advance to their orange belt or
continuing with the club long
after graduation, the Kempo stu
dents learn more from their art
than just blocks and chops.
"It's more than just coming in
here and going through the
moves, it's about personal
growth," Minneti said. "Some
people have said it's been the
highlight of their Stanford
careers because it's pushed them
to do more than they think they
can. You really push the limit."
