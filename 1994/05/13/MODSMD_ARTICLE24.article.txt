a fuller experience of the multi
faith reality here at Stanford,"
said Diana Akiyama, associate
dean of Memorial Church.
The service has been moved
this year from the Frost
Amphitheater to the West Por
tal in the Inner Quad.
Celebrations will continue at
the West Portal with the dedica
tion of the senior class plaque at
10:30. A time capsule will be
buried beneath the walkway in
front of Memorial Church, con
tinuing the 98 year-old tradi
tion. The contents of the capsule
will be chosen within the next
two or three weeks, said senior
class president Peter Liang.
"We [the presidents] will
pick a few things to put in, and
then it will be up to the seniors
to throw in what they want,"
Liang said.
The Senior Class Day Lun
cheon in Bowman Alumni
House on Saturday afternoon
will feature four main speakers
— William Stone, president of
the Alumni Association; Floyd
Thompkins, associate dean of
Memorial Church; head football
coach Bill Walsh; and Psycholo
gy Prof. Laura Carstensen. The
four senior class presidents will
introduce the speakers.
"We looked to people that
were well-known to seniors, and
who would have something
important to say. We also want
ed to represent the different
areas and interests of Stan
ford," Liang said about the

selection of speakers.
The Sterling award for service
to the University will be present
ed at the luncheon as well as the
class gift, which, Liang said,
hasn't been decided yet.
Following the luncheon,
graduates, their families, alum
ni and faculty are invited to
attend the President's Recep
tion at the gardens of the Presi
dent Gerhard Casper's house on
Mirada Avenue. Shuttle trans
portation from Tresidder
Memorial Union to the recep
tion will be provided to alleviate
parking problems.
Commencement exercises
begin at 9:15 on Sunday morn
ing in Stanford Stadium, with
an address by Yale Law Prof,
and Stanford alumnus Stephen
Carter.
Individual diplomas for all
degree candidates will be
awarded afterward at various
locations on campus. A compre
hensive list is available at the
Events and Services office.
A carillon concert by Dr.
Timothy Zerlang closes the
exercises at 11:30 a.m.
As in previous years, some of
the dorm rooms will be rented
out to serve as graduation
housing for visitors due to lim
ited hotel space. Reservations
must be made in advance
through the Branner Hall resi
dence office.
Student guides will conduct
walking tours of the campus
grounds and sculpture gardens
throughout the day on Friday
and Saturday. Bus tours of the
Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center, which require reserva
tions, will be given on Saturday.
