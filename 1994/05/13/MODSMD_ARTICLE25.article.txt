Stephen Carter, a controversial
commentator on affirmative
action and religion in public life,
will address the Class of 1994 as
this year's commencement speak
er.
A member of the Class of '76,
Carter has been described as both
a black liberal and a black conser
vative. He is widely recognized as
an expert in such legal areas as

constitutional law, contracts and intellectual prop
erty, and has authored two critically acclaimed
books, both of which fail to place him squarely in

either the liberal or conservative court.
His first work, "Reflections of an Affirmative
Action Baby," was described by the New York
Times as "a nuanced discussion" of issues raised by
affirmative action.
In the book, Carter says he has been a been a
beneficiary of such programs and says he basically
supports them. But while he defends affirmative
action for the opportunities it has created in
"spreading education and employment around,"
Carter portrays the policy as a mixed blessing which
has benefited middle-class blacks like himself but
has failed "millions of struggling blacks."
His 1993 work, "The Culture of Disbelief: How
American Law and Politics Trivialize Religious
Devotion," explores how religion has been forced
