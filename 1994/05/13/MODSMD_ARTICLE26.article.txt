# Just another day on the Farm
## Taking one last look back at Stanford's senior talents 
### Elizabeth Murtaugh Staff writer 
Extraordinary individuals are
rare most places in this world. Not
so at Stanford, which abounds
with brilliant, multi-talented,
charismatic students.
Seven of this year's typically
extraordinary seniors look back
here on their Stanford experiences
as they prepare to set foot in the

real world.
Each of them offers an insight
ful glimpse into the true meaning
of "the Stanford experience" —
what Angus Matheson, a senior
biology mi\jor calls "a lesson in
humanity, a lesson in understand
ing."
The balls-out approach
Matheson — who will be
attending UC-Davis Medical

School next year — bounded into
Stanford four years ago as a "God
fearing, hard-core, inhumane pre
med" determined to knock the
socks off anyone he encountered,
student or professor.
He bypassed the more tradition
al calculus/chemistry freshman
itinerary and dove immediately
into the biology core, a feat that
very few first-year students
attempt.
Rut he soon realized that sur

passing his peers j
in academics
lacked the sense
of accomplish
ment that is the j
reward of true
intellectual and
personal growth. j
Now, with
four years of '
such growth

behind him, he says he can appre
ciate the "beautiful complexity of
biology." What he loves most
about neurobiology, his focus, is
being able to "plunge into the
chaos of life to emerge with fluid,
real and fascinating details."
Despite his interest and success
as a researcher — Matheson
designed and built an electrode
that measures neurotransmission
— he prefers more human con
tact, which is why he plans to
focus on family practice once in
medical school.
Reflecting on a lesson in eccen
tricity he learned from a Shake
speare class, Matheson recalls his
Stanford acting debut as Mistress
Overdone, a notorious bawd in
Shakespeare's "Measure for Mea
sure":
"A balls-out approach is a won
derful thing," Angus advises.
Designing the future
When Patric McGowan isn't
hitting the slopes with the Stan
ford ski team, he's tutoring a
group of second graders in East
Palo Alto, singing in the campus
gospel choir, working on the Stan
ford Solar Car Project or slaving

away in a Terman engineering lab.
McGowan, a mechanical engi
neering major with a strong inter
est in biomedical engineering, is
currently working with two other
ME students in designing a pros
thetic leg brace for paraplegics.
The device, McGowan said, will
enable paraplegics to walk without
any arm-held support.
He explained that the leg brace
will be used to enhance therapy
for paraplegics, not to enable them
to walk unguided from place-to
place.
If it's a success, McGowan's leg
brace could be an important link
between therapeutic walking aids
and day-to-day mobility.
As a coterminal student next

year, he plans to
continue with his
interest in
biomedical engi
neering while
integrating stud
ies in robotics
and graphics.
In addition,
McGowan says
he has been able

to maintain a healthy balance
between the three most meaning
ful aspects of his life: academics,
sports and spirituality.
This balance has allowed him
to focus on and explore a wide
range of possibilities within his
major — words of wisdom for
those meandering underclassmen
out there.
To Canterbury and back
Amy Marx, a public policy and
economics major, is heauad for a
sojourn in Canterbury, England
next year.
As a recipient of the prestigious
Marshall Scholarship, which
grants funding for two years of
study at a British university, Marx
will be working toward a master's
degree in applied philosophy at the

University of Kent in Canterbury.
Marx has also been awarded a

Truman Scholar
ship — a grant
for students plan
ning to pursue
careers in public
service — which
she will apply to
her studies in law
school, where she
plans to develop
her interest in

the ethics of environmental policy.
What Marx says will add to
her experience abroad are her
previous summer fellowships in
both Washington and Sacramen
to.
"You come to appreciate Stan
ford most when you're away from
campus," she says.
Camping through Europe
In a little over a month, Dave
Toy will be facing a classroom full
of Slovakians eagerly anticipating
their first encounter with the
English language.
Toy's trek is sponsored by the

student group
Students for East
European Devel
opment. His final
destination is
Nove Zomky, Slo
vakia — a small,
slow-paced vil
lage located in a
portion of the for
mer Czechoslo-

vakia.
As an economics major who
says that he is "starved for doing
something practical and helpful,"
Toy is in for quite a feast . .. one
he believes may be among his life's
most challenging endeavors.
Toy, who currently tutors a
small group of students from
Poland, Russia, and the Ukraine
— none of whom spoke more than
a few words of English when the

sessions began — said that teach
ing the language is much more dif
ficult than he had ever imagined.
He anticipates that the difficul
ties he will encounter this summer
in Slovakia will be like these tutor
ing sessions "to the hundredth
power."
"I'll have to deal with people
who will probably want more than
anything to know about Michael
Jackson and movie stars. I'll have
to figure out a way to be honest, to
balance the negatives with the
positives, to convey that the Unit
ed states is not the end-all, beat-all
of countries and cultures in the
world" Toy said.
In addition to enabling him to
make a tangible contribution to
the world, Toy sees his upcoming
adventure as a way of living out
his philosophy of "camping
through life . . . going without
things and experiencing the feel
ing of being without life's plush
comforts" as a means of self-dis
covery.
Kiddies and computers
Marny Rush is quite an expert
on "Sesame Street."
An American Studies major

who also com
pleted the Chil
dren and Society
curriculum, Rush
wrote an honors
thesis on race
relations and
implicit cultural
pluralism in the
"Sesame Street"
series.

"Basically, what I learned from
my research is that one can't
definitively prove that ["Sesame
Street"] is changing kids' behav
ior, but it is exposing them to
something very positive," Rush
said.
"I'm thrilled about combining
an innovative educational project

with strong business training.
Just as exciting is the opportunity
to make a difference in children's
learning and attitudes about
learning," Rush noted.
Reflecting on her experiences
as a Sierra Camp counselor, a res
ident assistant, and as an intern
for the County of San Mateo Chil
dren's Services, Rush stresse how
much she was able to learn from
members of the Stanford commu
nity, both on and off campus.
Beach-bound
Stanford's record-breaking set
ter Canyon Ceman is bound for
pro beach volleyball this weekend.
He's not committing himself to
the tour, however, until he gets
his master's degree.
Stanford is one of those rarp

places where
aspiring Olympic
athletes are also
diligent and
accomplished stu
dents.
Ceman — who,
in four years,
received his
undergraduate
degree in eco-

nomics and will soon be receiving
a master's in organizational
behavior with an overall GPA of
3.6 — says of his adept juggling of
academics and athletics that "any
one can do it . . . you just have to
organize your time well."
The four-time Ail-American is
considering several more long
time possibilities: the U.S. Nation
al team, the '96 Olympics, or
maybe starting a business with his
father who is an aerospace engi
neer.
Ceman emphasized that Stan
ford has taught him that "it is
impossible to be the best at every
thing. Everyone is good at some
thing and every talent is just as
meaningful and valuable as what I

happen to enjoy doing. ... I just
think volleyball is more fun than
most other things."
A wealth of experiences
Christina Milano, along with
three other Stanford seniors, is
headed for Denver, Colo, next year
to perform long-term improvisa
tional pieces and compete in theater
sports — a "pseudo-competitive"
form of battling it out on stage.
As an American Studies major

focusing on r
Thought and L
Imagination, p
Milano has added i
to her talents as |
an actress by inte- [
grating her pas- j
sion for literature. If
After all, she says, L
"really good H
improv revolves
around a good story."

Milano managed to maintain
quite an extraordinary balance
between her love for the arts and
her interest in science. In addition
to her involvement with Stanford
Improvisers (SIMPS) and After
Hours Theater, she teaches both
improv and science to inner-city sev
enth, eighth and ninth graders in
San Francisco during her summers.
Did Stanford teach her any
important lessons she did not
expect to learn? Milano says,
"When I first came to Stanford, I
believed that success could be mea
sured by letters and numbers."
Her four years at Stanford have
tempered her confidence and
enthusiasm — qualities that char
acterize most freshmen who barge
into Stanford a little too big for
their britches — with wisdom and a
deep appreciation for the immea
surable benefits of the Stanford
experience.
"Stanford has been a wealth of
experiences and lessons that have
been unbelievably valuable to me."
