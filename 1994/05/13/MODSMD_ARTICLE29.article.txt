# Sights and sounds on the Farm
## Student tour guides gear up for the graduation crunch with a compilation of their favorite campus hot spots 
### Emily Bazar Staff writer 
They're eloquent, cordial, and they've
perfected the art of walking backwards.
To outsiders, they make Stanford look
like Utopia.
With their ready smiles and vast
knowledge of Stanford and its history,
who could these be but the student tour
guides?
With over 8,800 acres of land, 47
libraries and a 7,700-pipe organ, Stanford
is a university of enormous proportions;
everything about it is big and demanding.
It takes a special kind of person to
understand, remember and relay this
immensity.
He can be seen leading a group of sev
enth graders past "The Thinker." Some
times she is admired for successfully
directing a huge group through the noon
time chaos of White Plaza. But each tour
guide is always the epitome of patience
and poise.

With Commencement only a few
weeks away, the campus looks forward to
being inundated with parents, friends
and family of graduates. For some visi
tors, this will be their first time at Stan
ford. Others will know the campus better
than many students. Most will be looking
for something to do or see.
The requisite tour of campus not only
shows off the main campus attractions,
but presents the history of Stanford.
Among other things, the tour will high
light sites such as the Main Quad, Memo
rial Church, White Plaza, Tresidder
Union, Old Union and Memorial Audito
rium.
Guides strongly suggest a tour to get
acquainted with campus, but also recom
mend a more thorough inspection of Uni
versity grounds.
Here, they suggest a few popular cam
pus landmarks that deserve a more thor
ough investigation than the one present
ed on the tour.
For example, Memorial Church.

Sophomore Tami Jones says she loves
showing the church because "people have
a look of wonder on their faces when they
walk into the church. They don't expect it
to be as wonderful as it is."
"I like Memorial Church the best
because people just go in there and gasp,"
seconded senior MeiMei Fox.
Senior Sarah Birkeland advocates a
more complete exploration of the church.
She suggests that visitors go into the
church and look at the inscriptions on the
walls. These inscriptions were chosen by
Jane Leland, and from them "you can
learn a lot about her and her inspiration
for the school," Birkeland says.
Senior Ben Meisel suggests hearing an
organ performance in the church. He
says that the Mem Chu organ is one of
the most famous in the world and hear
ing the organ would add another dimen
sion to a visitor's Memorial Church expe
rience.


Hats off to last year's graduating seniors.
"If there's one quintessential
part of campus, it's in the mid
dle of the Quad," Sabadini says.
The Main Quad is not only the
oldest part of campus, but also
boasts the University's most
beautiful architecture.
Hoover Tower rounds off the
tour guides' suggestions of pop
ular places on campus. Most
guides encourage visitors to
take a trip up to the observation
deck.
"Hoover Tower gives the best

view of campus. When you walk
through, you really don't get an
idea of the entire campus," said
senior tour guide Karen Sondik.
According to Meisel, San
Francisco is visible from the top
of Hoover Tower on a good day.
But he adds that another
impressive view from the obser
vation deck is that of the red
tile roofs that Jane and Leland
Stanford stipulated had to be on
every building on campus.
The tour guides also suggest
visitors see other less well
known parts of campus. Birke
land especially encourages a
trip to the Rodin Sculpture Gar
den, which houses the second

largest collection of Rodin
sculptures in the world.
"It's an undiscovered thing
for students," Birkeland says.
Sabadini recommends that vis
itors take a walk to the foothills
because of the scenery and an
expansive view of campus.
He also says that students
should show their parents and
guests the area of campus
where they spent most of their
time.
"For parents to best under
stand their son or daughter's
experience here, students should
take their parents to their
department or dorm to let them
know what [they have] done

here," he says.
For the adventurous type,
Meisel recommends some of the
more unknown features of cam
pus. He advocates a trip to the
Psychology building to eat at the
Thai food restaurant. Or for the
truly bold, there is always the
campus's best drinking fountain
on the first floor of McClatchy
Hall, where, Meisel declares,
"the water always reaches your
mouth and is always cold — it's
key!"
For the more traditional tour,
Fox's best advice to parents and
visitors is "to get your child to
show you around — that's the
best tour you're going to get."

Hats off to last year's graduating seniors.
"If there's one quintessential
part of campus, it's in the mid
dle of the Quad," Sabadini says.
The Main Quad is not only the
oldest part of campus, but also
boasts the University's most
beautiful architecture.
Hoover Tower rounds off the
tour guides' suggestions of pop
ular places on campus. Most
guides encourage visitors to
take a trip up to the observation
deck.
"Hoover Tower gives the best

view of campus. When you walk
through, you really don't get an
idea of the entire campus," said
senior tour guide Karen Sondik.
According to Meisel, San
Francisco is visible from the top
of Hoover Tower on a good day.
But he adds that another
impressive view from the obser
vation deck is that of the red
tile roofs that Jane and Leland
Stanford stipulated had to be on
every building on campus.
The tour guides also suggest
visitors see other less well
known parts of campus. Birke
land especially encourages a
trip to the Rodin Sculpture Gar
den, which houses the second

largest collection of Rodin
sculptures in the world.
"It's an undiscovered thing
for students," Birkeland says.
Sabadini recommends that vis
itors take a walk to the foothills
because of the scenery and an
expansive view of campus.
He also says that students
should show their parents and
guests the area of campus
where they spent most of their
time.
"For parents to best under
stand their son or daughter's
experience here, students should
take their parents to their
department or dorm to let them
know what [they have] done

here," he says.
For the adventurous type,
Meisel recommends some of the
more unknown features of cam
pus. He advocates a trip to the
Psychology building to eat at the
Thai food restaurant. Or for the
truly bold, there is always the
campus's best drinking fountain
on the first floor of McClatchy
Hall, where, Meisel declares,
"the water always reaches your
mouth and is always cold — it's
key!"
For the more traditional tour,
Fox's best advice to parents and
visitors is "to get your child to
show you around — that's the
best tour you're going to get."
