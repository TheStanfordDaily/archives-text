# 3 seniors named Gardner fellows
## Students get $15K for public service efforts 
### Emily Bazar Staff writer 
Three graduating seniors have been selected as
John Gardner Public Service Fellows for their dedica
tion to community service and will receive $15,000
stipends next year.
Russell Calleros, Ying-Ying Goh and Rachel Mad
dow, who are currently in the process of choosing
mentors, will spend 11 months applying their policy
interests by working in the public sector.
Calleros, a political science major, said he sees the
fellowship as an opportunity to embark upon a career
in government. Calling himself a "political junkie," he
said that politics needs some fresh voices.
"A lot of our most gifted people avoid politics be
cause of the stigma and corruption associated with
it," added Calleros, saying that he feels like he is being
called to become a politician.
As a Gardner fellow, Calleros said he hopes to find
a position with a mentor either in Washington, D.C.
or in Los Angeles under County
Supervisor Gloria Molina or
Mayor Richard Riordan.
Calleros, from Whittier, Calif.,
has volunteered for local and
national elections and worked for
Congressmen Xavier Becerra and
Esteban Torres.
At Stanford, he has been an
ASSU senator, a tutor in East
Palo Alto with Stanford Offering
Alternative Realities and the
head of the Christian Life Com
munity.
After the fellowship, he will
attend the John F. Kennedy
School of Government at Harvard
for two years and then plans to go
hack into politics, either in Los
Angeles or at the national level.
Goh, a public policy major with
an emphasis in health care, said
she wants to use the fellowship to
follow her interests in public
health and health policy. Eventu
ally planning to attend medical
school, Goh said being a Gardner
fellow would help her become a

more well-rounded doctor.
The fellowship "is going to give
me the type of exposure that goes
into making a good physician,
who is not only knowledgeable
about the science behind the
medicine, but also the issues
involved in providing health care
in the community," Goh said.
She is contacting public health
foundations such as the World
Health Organization and
UNICEF to find a position.
Goh has been a volunteer with
Generation Linkage and the
Arbor Free Clinic in Palo Alto.
She was an ASSU senator for two
years and is currently a member
of the Council of Presidents. Last
summer she interned in the
Department of Health and
Human Services and had a
chance to work on the Clinton
health-care proposal.
Maddow, who is also a public
policy major with a health-care
emphasis, wants to use her year
as a Gardner fellow to work on
AIDS policy.
In current AIDS policy, Mad
dow said, "there's a need for new
energy and new life and new ideas
because the people and resources

are really strained."
She wants to provide this new
energy by working with an AIDS
organization in San Francisco
under a mentor in AIDS policy.
Hut Maddow said she wants
action mixed with policy, adding
"I want to do localized policy
work in an organization that
knows what it's doing because it
has done it."
Maddow plans on attending
graduate school in the future and
hopes her year as a Gardner fel
low will help her decide on a
focus. She said she also plans on
working on AIDS policy after
graduate school.
Here at Stanford, Maddow was
a co-director of the AIDS Educa
tion Project and Ye Olde Safer
Sex Shoppe. She has also been
involved in the Lesbian, Gay and
Bisexual Community Center,
Queerland and the Coalition for
Dignity and Justice at Webb
Ranch.
Off campus, she has done
AIDS prevention and outreach at
the London School of Economics
and has worked with ACT-UP
and Women's Health Action and
Mobilization.
