### Emily Bazar Staff writer 
Three graduating seniors have been selected as
John Gardner Public Service Fellows for their dedica
tion to community service and will receive $15,000
stipends next year.
Russell Calleros, Ying-Ying Goh and Rachel Mad
dow, who are currently in the process of choosing
mentors, will spend 11 months applying their policy
interests by working in the public sector.
Calleros, a political science major, said he sees the
fellowship as an opportunity to embark upon a career
in government. Calling himself a "political junkie," he
said that politics needs some fresh voices.
"A lot of our most gifted people avoid politics be
cause of the stigma and corruption associated with
it," added Calleros, saying that he feels like he is being
called to become a politician.
As a Gardner fellow, Calleros said he hopes to find
a position with a mentor either in Washington, D.C.
