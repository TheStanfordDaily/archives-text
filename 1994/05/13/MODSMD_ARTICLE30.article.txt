## Giving Dad his due — a tribute to my father 
### 
When I was little, late at night I
used to sing the Daddy song. It
was a simple enough tune, writ
ten for a soprano, complemented by the
infinitely catchy lyrics, "daddy, daddy,
daddy-daddy-daddy." I would never sing
it loud, and I wouldn't sing it for very
long.
It was usually prompted by a snapped
twig or galavanting fauna in the back
yard. Being a socially aware kinda kid, I
naturally mistook these sounds for the
footsteps of foul-smelling, unshaven, sto
gie-smoking kidnappers looking to steal
little girls and send them off to wash
down the camel caravans in the foreign
legion.
Father knows best.
Sure enough, in a matter of seconds
I'd hear my dad blindly stumbling down
the hall. Sure enough, he'd open my door
and ask what was wrong, sitting down on
my bed — crushing my legs because I was
too afraid to move and tip off the bad
guys as to my whereabouts. Sure enough,
he'd tuck Rocky the Wondersquirrel

under my arm, tell me stories about the
crazy neighbors until I fell asleep and
then he'd wander back to bed.
Papa's gonna sing you a lullaby.
I had firmly filed the daddy song away
into the dark recesses of my mind until
two summers ago, when I found myself in
a particularly stuffy room in scenic
Nicaragua, fighting a losing battle
against an overzealous parasite. When I
started to feel like god was giving me my
walking papers in a most unspectacular
way. When I picked up the tape recorder
I'd been using to make tapes for my par
ents, and began to make hourly updates
on my death throes.
On the tape you hear me start to joke,
describing how I'm feeling slightly ill.
Frustrated, describing how I couldn't get
out of bed without falling to the floor.
Annoyed, describing how my host family
hadn't noticed I didn't come out of my
room for five hours straight. Pathetically
whining about being too cold on a generi
cally hot, steamy Managua day.
If you can't take the heat.

In the last few seconds of the tape all
you can hear is me pressing the record
button and mumbling a few stanzas of
the daddy song. Then right before the
tape clicks to its end, I say, "But this time
daddy isn't going to come down from the
end of the hall."
Four days and 36 pills later I was a
new woman, ready to conquer the world.
Two weeks later I went home to L.A. as
my trip came to a merciful close. Two
weeks after that I headed up to school,
and as I got out at the curb of LAX, I
handed my dad the tape, with all its sar
castic rantings about the environmental
ly conscious Nicaraguan ox-cart alterna
tive, my feisty host mother's nasty
yelling habit and my yearning for a show
er with hot water.
Wait 'til your father gets home.
I'd just stepped into the barren waste
land of my naked new dorm room at Stan
ford when the phone rang. It was my mom.
In a panic, she asked me what was on the
tape. Worried, she asked me to call my dad
and talk to him. Anxious, she asked me to

please calm him down, since he wouldn't
talk and wouldn't tell her what was wrong.
Daddy's little girl.
As he watches my graduation in the
hazillion-degree heat of Stanford Stadi
um, my dad will have successfully com
pleted the last of the modern-day trials of
Hercules. My dad put two, count 'em two
kids through Stanford, without financial
aid. My dad forked over $200,000 out of
his middle-class pockets, without intri
cate tax write-offs or mafia connections.
My dad worked four jobs, 90-hour weeks,
from one side of Los Angeles to the other,
just to bring a wan smile to the faces of
his son and daughter.
Every time I sent a new tuition bill
home, Dad would say that same phrase.
Every time I asked him about the state of
the rat race, he would answer with that
same phrase. Every time I made those
jokes about him cashing in the house and
moving to a trailer park, he would say
that same phrase.
Allah will provide.
My brother once asked him how we

were ever going r.o pay him back. He said
it was our job to send our kids to any
where they wanted to go to for college. No
money, he said. Just do the same for
them that he did for us.
But how can I cancel my debt from all
the spontaneous Bach lessons meant to
ease my nerves before ulcer-busting
championship soccer games back when I
was just a pup? All the years I accompa
nied him on his yardwork trials, talking
non-stop, hour after hour, day after day,
without taking a breath in pause, as he
patiently listened to my stories.
All the therapeutic weekends we spent
cruising the mall, as he calmed me down
after I had reached the nadir of awkward
ness. All the emphasis on my duty as a
female to kick butt and take names. As
Dad would say, god in her infinite wisdom
will show me the way.
Thanks Dad, you and Allah came
through in spades.
