1993
'From Stanford to
the U.S. Senate, the
defining issue is
fundamentally the
same. You were not
educated and we
were not elected in
order to preside
over the downsizing
of the American
Dream/

1990
'You just need to be
a flea against injus
tice. Enough com
mitted fleas biting
strategically can
make even the
biggest dog uncom
fortable and trans
form even the
biggest nation. The
19905' struggle is
for America's con
science and future.'

1991
1 worry about men
and women function
ing far below the level
of their possibilities. It
need not happen. As
you settle into your
adult lives, you cannot
write off the danger of
complacency, bore
dom, growing rigidity,
imprisonment by your
own comfortable
habits and opinion.'
