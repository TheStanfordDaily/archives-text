# Invisible minority?
## Official says few Asian-Americans involved in politics 
### Laura Shin Staff writer 
Asian-Americans "are the 'model minority' when
it comes to academics or economics, but. . . we're the
invisible minority when it comes to politics," said
Dennis Hayashi, the highest-ranking Asian-Ameri
can in the Clinton administration, said yesterday in a
speech at Tresidder Union.
Hayashi, director of the U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services' Office of Civil Rights,
spoke on "The Empowerment of Asian-Americans"
and focused on the current state of Asian-American
politics and ideas for progress.
"Where we are now is where blacks were in the
'60s and '70s and Hispanics were in the '80s," said
Hayashi. Now is a "crucial time for Asian-Ameri
cans," he said.
"You are going to be the leaders of the 21st centu
ry for Asian Pacific Islanders, not just for yourselves,
but also nationally," he told the
audience of about 30, which was
mainly composed of Asian-Amer
ican undergraduates.
Hayashi urged the audience
members to take control of their
futures politically. "We have left
the role to others to determine
our political agenda," he said.
"It's you folks who will represent
the Asian-American communi
ty."
Hayashi tied his message of
activism into the renewed cam
pus campaign for an Asian-Amer
ican Studies program.

"What you're trying to do with
Asian-American Studies is what
Asian-Americans have to do in
the political scene," he said. "Age
is not a factor sometimes as to
whether you can serve in an
administration or not," he said,
citing the Clinton administration
— which is nicknamed "the kid
die corps" — as an example.
Currently, said Hayashi, one
of the reasons that Asian-Ameri
can interests are underrepresent
ed is that many Asian-Americans
don't vote, even though they give
large amounts to campaign dona
tions, even a "disproportionate
percentage."
Hayashi warned the audience
about obstacles to progress.
"One that troubles me great

ly is the backlash against diver
sity," he said. Hayashi criticized
opponents to diversity who say
including minorities leads to
"lowering standards," and who
want to "reject the melting pot."
In his position, Hayashi said
he has seen discrimination on a
national level. Hayashi recount
ed his surprise at the discrimina
tion he found in one of the three
largest Manhattan hospitals,
which had two maternity floors.
According to Hayashi, on one
floor 99 percent of the patients
were white, while on the other
99 percent were Hispanic and
black.
He worked to change this situ
ation, because "to the hospital,
this set-up was fine."
