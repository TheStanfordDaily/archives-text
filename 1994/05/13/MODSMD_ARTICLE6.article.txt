# Colors of the World
## Event to show off world cultures 
### Jo Marshall Staff writer 
Attractions from Persia to the Philippines will
transform the Bechtel International Center Satur
day into a bustling bazaar as the 14th Annual In
ternational Festival demonstrates the colors of the
world.
Throughout the afternoon there will be a feast
of international cuisines on sale, craft displays and

vendors, a lively program of international enter
tainment and free drawings for prizes donated by
local businesses.
"It's a celebration of different cultures — a lot of
international students are eager to share their cul
ture with other groups," said the I-Center's foreign
student services administrator, Lynn Kroner, the
chief organizer of the event.

Bhangra dancers practice for tomorrow's 14th Annual International Festival at the Bechtel Interna
tional Center. The dancers (from right) are Rishl Dave, Meetpaul Singh, Yesha Patel and Nisha Varia.
Those with a sweet tooth may
investigate the Hellenic student
association booth, which will be
serving baklava, a traditional treat
described by Greek graduate stu
dent Serafim Vlachos as "very
sweet, containing layers of filo pas
try and a core of caramel and
hazelnuts."
Vlachos is looking forward to
meeting people from other cul
tures at the festival, "It gets people
to know and be aware of the cul
tural diversity at Stanford," said
Vlachos. "It's also good for people
to meet others from the same cul
ture," he added.
Graduate student Harrid
Aghan and his wife Ay.am Monifee
will be busy tonight preparing tra
ditional Persian rice dishes like
adas polo — a mixture of rice,
lentils and raisins which is spiced
with saffron — for the Persian
Student Association's booth.
The booth will also include
books on different aspects of Iran
and Persian rugs. "We want to try
to present a good image of the Per
sian culture and offer some tasty

Persian food," said Aghan enthu
siastically.
"Food brings people," Kroner
said. "What keeps people here is
the entertainment."
In keeping with this thought,
sophomore Meetpaul Singh kicks
off the entertainment at midday
with an "energetic" solo perfor
mance of the "bhangra dance" — a
classical piece from Punjab in
northwestern India.
"The dance requires a lot of
spirit and is very uplifting," Singh
said.
I-Center Director John Pearson
said he hopes the festival will show
the local community that there is
a, "very large presence at Stanford
of international students."
"It is one event that brings stu
dent groups together," Pearson
said, "Also, it is an event which is
attractive to the local community."
Between the hubbub of music
and dancing there will also be time
to reflect on recent events in
South Africa when African gradu
ate student Motlatsi Mokoena
gives a tribute dedicated to Nelson
Mandela.
"I thought it would be appro
priate to say a few words about
what he has achieved from going
from prison to president. . . I don't

think the world expected that,"
Mokoena said.
In addition to food and enter
tainment, there will be free draw
ings throughout the day for
around 30 prizes donated by 14
local businesses. These donations
include six-month cinema passes
to Landmark Theaters, books
from Kepler's bookstore and din
ner for two at Mango Cafe.
The festival is subsidized by
money from the I-Center but has
received additional monetary sup
port from various departments at
Stanford. Groups outside Stanford
such as the Turkish school —
which use the rooms at the I-Cen
ter for their club activities — have
also made donations, said Sarah
Holmes, an assistant in the over
seas resource center.
The afternoon's "grand finale"
will be a Filipino fashion show,
performed by families of the Fil
ipino American Community at
Stanford.
Pearson hopes to bring interna
tional students together more in
the future with activities such as
an international "five-a-side foot
ball" game, he said.
The Bechtel International Cen
ter will host the festival from 11
a.m. to 5 p.m. on Saturday.
