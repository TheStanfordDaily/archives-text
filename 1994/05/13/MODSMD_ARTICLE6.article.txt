Attractions from Persia to the Philippines will
transform the Bechtel International Center Satur
day into a bustling bazaar as the 14th Annual In
ternational Festival demonstrates the colors of the
world.
Throughout the afternoon there will be a feast
of international cuisines on sale, craft displays and

vendors, a lively program of international enter
tainment and free drawings for prizes donated by
local businesses.
"It's a celebration of different cultures — a lot of
international students are eager to share their cul
ture with other groups," said the I-Center's foreign
student services administrator, Lynn Kroner, the
chief organizer of the event.
