plans to cut as many as 220 positions this year.
The current round of cuts, announced last month

through increased revenue.
This year, hospital administrators predict that
hospital revenue will increase by $7.5 million because
of an additional 2,000 outpatient surgeries.
Under the OI plan, cuts were proposed by teams of
physicians and employees who targeted specific areas
