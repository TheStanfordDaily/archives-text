# Hospital will cut 220 jobs
## 40 to 60 layoffs expected 
### Michael Slemmer Editorial staff 
Continuing the trend of budget cuts throughout
the University, Stanford Hospital has announced
plans to cut as many as 220 positions this year.
The current round of cuts, announced last month
by Malinda Mitchell, vice president and chief operat
ing officer of the hospital, will trim about $25 million
from the hospital's budget, which will total $440 mil
lion for 1994-95.
However, according to Mitchell, only between 40
and 60 of the positions cut will involve layoffs. The
rest of the reductions in personnel will be accom
plished through attrition and reassignment to other
parts of the hospital staff.
Although the total number of employees laid off by
the hospital in the last five years will now exceed 180,
Mike Goodkind, a spokesman for the Medical Center,
said that no problems have been encountered with
people whose positions have been cut.
"I would say these are relatively modest cuts," he
said. "We're dealing with highly trained employ
ees. . . . Even the people who are laid ofT will be able
to find other work."
The people whose positions are being cut were no
tified in the last couple of weeks, Goodkind added.
"Some people may have just heard."
The current budget cuts are part of a five-year,
budget-reduAion effort called Operations Improve
ment (OI), which is projected to save the hospital
$100 million — about one-fourth of which will come
through increased revenue.
This year, hospital administrators predict that
hospital revenue will increase by $7.5 million because
of an additional 2,000 outpatient surgeries.
Under the OI plan, cuts were proposed by teams of
physicians and employees who targeted specific areas
of the hospital's budget. Each team was also given ap
proximate amounts of money to cut and was encour-
aged to save money as aggressive
ly as possible.
For example, the teams which
examined cardiovascular medicine,
cardiovascular surgery and bone
marrow transplants proposed a

$3.7 million cut which is included
in next year's budget estimate.
From a procedural standpoint,
Goodkind said the hospital has put
a high priority on increasing effi
ciency rather than actually cutting
positions. "In some ways I feel this
mirrors the health care crisis fac
ing the entire nation," he said.
Because the cost-cutting teams
were made up of experts at the hos

pital, next year's budget will be
more efficient. But Mitchell empha
sized that patient care remains a
top priority at the hospital.
"There were a lot of instruc
tions for all the teams," Mitchell
said in a statement. "But |there
was J one hard and fast unbreak
able rule. . . . We were adamant
that no cut could in any way com
promise patient care."
