# Values shouldn't be bypassed in health care debate
## 
### Shirley Park Staff writer 
Basic changes in national values are
necessary for optimal long-term health
care reform, Daniel Callahan, presi
dent of the Hastings Center, told a
small audience in the Political Science
building yesterday.
"We have to go beyond the immedi
ate debate fin health care] to create
more fundamental change," said Calla

han, who in 1969 founded the Hastings
Center, a research and educational in
stitute in New York, to explore ethics
related to issues such as health care.
Callahan's speech, titled "Health
Care Reform — Can We Change Our
Values?" was part of the Ethics in Soci
ety program'B lecture series on medical
ethics.
Callahan suggested that a shift in
American values must emerge in
health care reform, namely the "scal

ing down of expectations."
"We must curb our appetite for
progress," said Callahan, noting that
since World War 11, America's drive to
conquer all disease and push the limits
of scientific discovery has never ceased.
While this "expansionary vision"
has brought about much new technolo
gy and improvement in health care,
Callahan stated that there has been a
tradeoff — "progress is expensive."
European countries' health care

plans have consumed a relatively
steady percentage of their gross na
tional product over the years, while
health care spending in the United
States has jumped from six percent to
15 percent of the GNP in one genera
tion, said Callahan.
According to Callahan, health care
systems in European countries gener
ally offer universal access, control costs
and are popular with the people,
while showing health outcomes
comparable to the United States'.
"If the U.S. is to solve this
[health carej dilemma, we will
have to do so by approximating
European solutions — they work,"
Callahan said.
However, Callahan conceded
that cultural differences between
the United States and European
countries may prevent the United
States from merely emulating an
already established method, since

it "has to do things our own way."
For example, he said Americas
ideals of individualism and suspi
cion of government interference,
as well as the commitment to com
petition, would make it difficult to
purely imitate European health
care systems.
As a result, the emerging U.S.
health care system "won't have any
historical models," Callahan said.
Europeans have accepted mak
ing do with less, and Americans
must do the same, said Callahan,
who advocated replacing a model
of "constant expansion" with one
of "sustainable health care."
"People may not get all they
want but they need to find a way

to tolerate this insufficiency," said
Callahan.
Although it may go against
American ideals, the country must
prioritize what is essential and
what is "dispensable," he said.
Rapidly rising costs in health
care, as well as the more subtle
incentive of "skepticism about the
benefits of medical progress,"
should provide the impetus to accept
"rationing and limits," he said.
Callahan was optimistic that a
fundamental turnabout in deeply
grounded American values could
happen, citing historical examples
such as the civil rights, feminist and
environmental movements as proof
of the United States' "malleability."
