# Values shouldn't be bypassed in health care debate
## 
### Shirley Park Staff writer 
Basic changes in national values are
necessary for optimal long-term health
care reform, Daniel Callahan, presi
dent of the Hastings Center, told a
small audience in the Political Science
building yesterday.
"We have to go beyond the immedi
ate debate fin health care] to create
more fundamental change," said Calla

han, who in 1969 founded the Hastings
Center, a research and educational in
stitute in New York, to explore ethics
related to issues such as health care.
Callahan's speech, titled "Health
Care Reform — Can We Change Our
Values?" was part of the Ethics in Soci
ety program'B lecture series on medical
ethics.
Callahan suggested that a shift in
American values must emerge in
health care reform, namely the "scal

ing down of expectations."
"We must curb our appetite for
progress," said Callahan, noting that
since World War 11, America's drive to
conquer all disease and push the limits
of scientific discovery has never ceased.
While this "expansionary vision"
has brought about much new technolo
gy and improvement in health care,
Callahan stated that there has been a
tradeoff — "progress is expensive."
European countries' health care

plans have consumed a relatively
steady percentage of their gross na
tional product over the years, while
health care spending in the United
States has jumped from six percent to
15 percent of the GNP in one genera
tion, said Callahan.
According to Callahan, health care
systems in European countries gener
ally offer universal access, control costs
