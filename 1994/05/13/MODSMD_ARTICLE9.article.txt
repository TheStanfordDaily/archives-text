Abortion coverage debated
WASHINGTON (AP) - Emotions
ran high in a House subcommittee yes
terday as lawmakers considered one of
health reform's minefields: coverage of
abortion as a basic benefit. After a heat
ed debate, the panel defeated an amend
ment that would exclude abortion from
the basic benefits package.
The amendment by Rep. Ron Klink,
D-Pa., was defeated, 16-11, in the House
Education and Labor Committee's labor
management relations subcommittee.
A particularly bitter exchange in the
debate occurred when Rep. Jolene
Unsoeld, D-Wash., said men simply
didn't understand what was at stake.
"Reproductive health is at the very core
of a woman's existence in its importance,"
Unsoeld said. "If you want to be brutally

frank what it compares (with) is if you had
health care plans that did not cover any
illness related to male testicles."
Police enter Jericho
JERICHO, West Bank (AP) - The
pace of Israel's withdrawal quickened
yesterday with the entrance of about 300
Palestinian police into Jericho, the seat
of Palestinian self-rule.
A first batch of 20 policemen drove
from Jordan across the Allenby Bridge
into the West Bank town shortly after
midday. Israelis allowed 100 others to
enter hours later.
The policemen, some of the first of
thousands to be deployed in the occupied
lands, will take up duties in Jericho and
in the Gaza Strip — two areas that will
soon come under Palestinian rule.
