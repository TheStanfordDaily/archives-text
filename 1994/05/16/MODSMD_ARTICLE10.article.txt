Handgun crime increases
WASHINGTON (AP) — The number
of crimes committed with a handgun
approached 1 million in 1992 and
occurred at a record rate, the Justice
Department reported yesterday.
Handguns were used in a growing
percentage of violent crimes, the depart
ment said.
There were 917,500 nonfatal crimes
committed with handguns in 1992, 50
percent above the average for the previ
ous live years, according to the depart
ment's Bureau of Justice Statistics. In
addition, there were 13,200 handgun
homicides that year, 24 percent more
than the five-year average, the FBI
reported.
The rate of nonfatal handgun crimes
— 4.5 crimes for every 1,000 people age
12 or over — surpassed the record set in

19H2 of 4 per 1,000, the statistics bureau
said.
Citadel trial begins
CHARLESTON, S C. <AP) — Shan
non Faulkner's battle to break the gen
der barrier at the Citadel, an all-male
state military college, marches ahead
today when U.S. District Judge C. West
on Houck begins hearing arguments in a
trial that is expected to last three weeks.
Last month, in a similar case involv
ing Virginia Military Institute, the 4th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that
states may provide single-sex education
as long as there are equal opportunities
for both sexes.
Faulkner rejected such an alternative
during a pretrial deposition, saying, "I
don't believe there is any other substi
tute" for the Citadel.
