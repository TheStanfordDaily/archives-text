# Tension mounts in Gaza, Jericho
## 
### 
JERICHO, West Bank (AM) Jewish
settlers defied PLC) authority yesterday
by carrying automat ie rifles into a Jericho
synagogue guarded by Palestinian police
men. In the (in/a Strip, Palestinian gun
men fired on Israeli troops, and four
Palestinians were wounded in the ensu
ing crossfire.
It is a time of testing in the newly
established autonomy /ones of the Gaza
Strip and West Hank region of Jericho.
Under accords between Israel and the
Palestine Liberation Organization, Pales
tinians are taking control of the two
zones, in what is to be the first stage of a
wider autonomy in lands Israel captured
in the June 19(i7 war.
The bonds of cooperation between
Israel and the Palestine Liberation Orga
nization are fragile but appeared to be
holding, despite incitement by opponents
on both sides.
Jewish settlers carrying I zi subma
chine guns or pistols were escorted b\

Israeli soldiers to the Peace Upon Israel
svnai'o ui when' they jostled past PLO
police with Kalashnikov rifles.
For the nit t part both sides avoided
eye contact but each bad complaints.

ll.mail P rat, a West Bank settler
leader and right-wing member of parlia
ment. said settlers would not show PLO
police identification or obey any of their
orders.
I or us these soldiers of Palestine are
like the air 1 don't see them. They don't
have identity," Porat said.
Poi it demanded that Palestinians be
barred from the synagogue, and com

plained that FLO police had hung uni
forms in a dining room and put up a pho
tograph ofPLO Chief Yasser Arafat.
Despite the concealed tensions, the
dozen or so PLO police made no move to
challenge the 60 Jewish settlers.
The settlers left before sunset, the
start of the Shavuot holiday marking the
day Moses received the Ten Command
ments.
Another test of the new order came in
the Gaza Strip town of Rafah, where PLO
police now control the Palestinian town
and Israeli soldiers still protect Jewish
settlements.
PLO police and Israeli soldiers jointly
investigated a shooting in which five gun
men in a van opened fire on soldiers
guarding the Morag settlement.
Four Palestinians in a car nearby were
wounded, but it was not clear whether
the bullets were fired by the gunmen or
Israeli troops who returned fire on their
assailants.
