CUE recommendations
on academics, calendar
were balanced and fair

NO RECOMMENDATION
for a three-year plan. No
endorsement of a switch to
the semester system. But it might
not be quite as appealing to be a
Dollie and you might be able to
catch up on sleep a little more over
winter vacation.
Although the Commission on
Undergraduate Education will not
suggest sweeping changes to Stan
ford's academic calendar, the rec
ommendations the commission's
subcommittee did make are sensi
ble and should be heeded.
First, the commission recom
mended the implementation of two
Dead Days every quarter. While a
full week to study for finals would
ultimately be the most beneficial
for students, this amount of time is
difficult under the quarter system,
where time is already tight. Profes
sors often say they do not have
adequate time to include all the
material they would like, and some
even introduce new information
during Dead Week.
If the commission's proposals
are implemented, the two Dead
Days would be free of classes,
allowing students extra valuable
time to study. In addition, during
autumn and winter quarters, the
two Dead Days would be on Thurs
day and Friday, allowing four con
secutive days for review.
Under another proposed
change, students may find them
selves heading back to the Farm
slightly earlier in the fall in
exchange for a three-week winter
vacation. That should resolve one

of students' biggest gripes — that
they are no longer in high school
and do not deserve a high school
length winter break.
The commission also suggested
that athletics and other non-aca
demic courses not receive credit
towards a diploma. That's a good
move that should restore some
credibility to Stanford degrees —
currently, students can earn up to
12 units toward graduation by
yell leading. The change
shouldn't lessen demand for ath
letics classes, either — students
will still be interested in staying
in shape.
Although the commission did
not recommend a shift to the
semester system, there was "a lot
of sentiment" in that direction,
according to Vice Provost for Insti
tutional Planning Geoffrey Cox.
The CUE cannot be expected to
take on such a task — but Stanford
should look into the issue more
closely.
In the past 11 years, Michigan
State, UC-Berkeley and Occidental
College, to name a few, have switched
from quarter to semester systems.
Currently, just 22 percent of colleges
are on the quarter system.
Stanford's last major study of
the pros and cons of each system
was conducted in 1982; studies
were also done the two decades
prior to that. The members of the
most recent examination found
there was "not enough unanimity"
to make a recommendation. How
ever, it seems that sentiment on
campus may signal it is time for
another close look.
The commission has done a
commendable job with this set of
recommendations by carefully
weighing lofty goals with pragma
tism. As more suggestions come in,
the administration should listen
closely and act quickly.
