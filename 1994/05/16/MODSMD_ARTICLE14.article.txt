## Board games: virtual reality 
### 
TAKE A RIDE on the Reading.
Remember going downstairs on
(fill in holiday here) morning when
— after collecting and claiming all your
presents — you looked specifically for
those slim rectangular boxes. In the toy
store, on shelf upon shelf, the boxes were
stacked so high you strained your neck
trying to eye them all. Pretty soon all the
boxes were stacked in your room, the cor
ners frayed and no more board game was
left to be played.
We never met Milton Bradley or the
Parker Brothers, but they sure were
good friends. They, of course, are the
inspirations behind the companies that
made the board games we played as kids,
our parents played as kids and probably
our children will play as kids.
I must have owned 30 different games
and played each one until the boards
warped, we lost the pieces or we were
forced to use some sort of replacement
die. All the games we played taught us
valuable lessons about life.
For example, how many of you pre
meds owned Operation as kids? What a
great introduction to major surgery,
right? Better yet, what a great introduc
tion to malpractice! Doctors all across
this great state of litigation — California
— would be ecstatic if their patient's
nose lighted up when they incorrectly
removed the wishbone.
What if a buzzer echoed throughout
the operating room if Dr. Jellyfinger's
tweezers touched the patient's side? I
guarantee Hillary will try to work this

somewhere in the new plan. Remember,
it takes a very steady hand.
Connect Four was immortalized in
that commercial. I'm sure you all
remember it. But what a great game. I
think I learned how to get out of any sit
uations because I used to drop all the
checkers out of the grid, and make my
sister clean it up. Pretty sneaky, bro.
Clue never taught me how to solve
mysteries, but it did teach me big words
like "billiard" and "conservatory." I'll
bet you didn't know Professor Plum was
an English prof, did you?
Yahtzee introduced us all to the won
derful world of gambling. I know I played
my first game with my grandparents. All
grandparents play Yahtzee. They have to
keep in shape for the trips to Laughlin.
They also don't use the cup to roll the
dice. No mortal being can endure the
noise those five dice make in that cup.
There were other greats, too. Scrabble
taught us how to spell. Candy Land
taught us the difference between a lol
lipop and a gumdrop — and how to per
severe when stuck in molasses. And
Hungry Hungry Hippos symbolized the
gluttony of the '80s.
But the one game that we all played
that taught us the most about life was
Monopoly. We'd play games that would
last for days. We'd always keep an extra
eye on the banker to make sure he wasn't
slipping a $500 bill under his quadrant of
the board. We'd fight over which piece
we'd be. I was always a thimble man
myself.

Monopoly taught the importance of
paying taxes, how to buy, sell and build
on real estate — and in case we ever
wanted to hone the Yahtzee skills, how to
get around scenic Atlantic City, N.J.
For as much practical advice
Monopoly had to offer, there were so
many other things about the game that
could lead to anarchy.
I guess the biggest problem would be
the whole "Get out of jail free" deal.
Could you imagine Richard Alan Davis
whipping out his little orange card? I
don't think so. Plus, did you play with the
"Free Parking" rule? Every time you
landed on the square, you got all the
money. First of all, there's no such thing
as free parking. Second, if you find free
parking, Officer K. Bryan slaps you with
a ticket.
And how unrealistic is all that money?
Orange $500s, yellow $l()0s, blue $50s
and purple horse shoes. Chances are you
don't land on Community Chest tomor
row, get a tax error in your favor and col
lect $200. You don't own all four rail
roads and you definitely don't have a
hotel on Boardwalk.
All that money out there and 1 don't
have any of it. Maybe 1 can enter a beau
ty contest. 1 hear second place is 10
bucks.

Jesse currently lives in an apartment on
Baltic Avenue. He's looking to move up to
the light blue neighborhood, preferably
Vermont.
