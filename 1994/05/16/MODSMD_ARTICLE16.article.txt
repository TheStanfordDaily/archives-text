## Attorney praises, defends former Bookstore managers 
### 
IN LIGHT of the renewed publicity
about a lawsuit filed against the two
former managers of the Stanford
Bookstore, I want as their lawyer to set
the record straight about their conduct.
In early 1992, The Daily ran a series
of articles about a loss of Bookstore
funds in the stock market and so-called
"perks" enjoyed by bookstore employees,
including General Manager Eldon Speed
and Assistant General Manager Philip
Chiaramonte. These included benefits
like company cars, a vacation home in
the Sierras and loans and investments to
help employees buy or remodel houses.
Following these articles, both the Cali
fornia attorney general (who supervises
non-profit corporations) and the Book
store's Board of Directors began inten
sive investigations of the entire manage
ment of the Bookstore under Speed and
Chiaramonte â€” including investments,
salaries, "perks," outside business pur
suits and charitable donations.

All the Bookstore's outside accoun
tants and lawyers concluded that no evi
dence of fraud, concealment or illegality
had taken place. Nor did the attorney
general ever come forward with any evi
dence of intentional wrongdoing. Com
pensation experts reported that the
total compensation paid to Speed and
Chiaramonte was within the appropriate
ranges for college bookstores and entire
ly justifiable.
Moreover, the investigations showed
that most of the notorious "perks"
(including the Sierra vacation home and
the loans and investments in employees'
homes) had been specifically approved
by the Bookstore's directors and duly
noted in its minutes. In addition, the
Board President for many years was a
Stanford Law School professor who met
almost daily with Speed. This professor
agrees that he knew of and encouraged
many of the "perks" which the press
and others later criticized. In short, the

Board or its key members were involved
in virtually every decision with regard
to salary and benefits and policy mat
ters over the years.
Nor has the press ever noted the
extraordinary success which Speed and
Chiaramonte enjoyed in turning the
Bookstore from a near-bankrupt busi
ness into arguably the best college book
store in the country with about $40 mil
lion in annual sales in 1992. It benefited
Stanford and other communities by
offering twice the number of titles as
any other college bookstore, with lower
prices and innovative non-book services.
Speed literally wrote the book on how to
run a college bookstore and has been
consulted by stores across the country.
With one exception, all of the accusa
tions and inquiries about Speed and
Chiaramonte have been resolved to the
satisfaction of both the attorney general
and the Bookstore. The attorney general
has released them from civil charges

and no criminal charges were ever initi
ated. The only remaining issue concerns
the loss of Bookstore funds in the stock
market decline at the time of the Gulf
War. The attorney general has sued
Speed and Chiaramonte and the Book
store's controller for negligently invest
ing in overly risky stocks, in an effort to
obtain coverage from an insurance poli
cy which the Bookstore carried. That
lawsuit is pending.
This unhappy episode demonstrates
how much time and public money can be
spent and wasted in a largely fruitless
investigation of wild charges. Two hon
est, dedicated men were singled out for
blame because they followed the guid
ance and dictates of a Board of Directors
which then washed its hands of responsi
bility for management strategies as soon
as those strategies were criticized.
