# Secretary Lewenstein explains how to bring issues before Fac Sen
## 
### 
There appears to be misunderstand
ing as to the method for students to get
an item placed on the agenda of the Fac
ulty Senate. As Prof. Pat Jones, Faculty
Senate chair, explained both verbally
and in writing to the Concerned Stu
dents for Asian American Studies before
the senate meeting on May 12, agenda
items are scheduled by the Steering
Committee of the senate one week
ahead of time, on the Wednesday before
the Thursday senate meeting of the fol
lowing week.
Although senate rules indicate that
after a regular agenda is completed at a
meeting, under new business a majority
vote of the senate can call for an item to

be placed on an agenda of a future meet
ing, this mechanism rarely has been
used. It has proved unworkable because
of time limitations.
Resolutions for action must be intro
duced by a senate member only. Stand
ing student representative guests of the
senate or ex-officio senate members
have the right to speak, but not to vote
or introduce resolutions. Non-senate
members, be they faculty, staff or stu
dents, do not have the right of the floor
unless the full senate votes to allow
them the right to speak.
Any member of Stanford University
can place a matter on the regular senate
agenda by forwarding to the Steering
Committee, through the academic secre
tary, a request supported by any of the
following methods and accepted by the
Steering Committee:
• a petition signed by 14 voting Fac
ulty Senate members;
• a resolution of the ASSU Senate;

• a student referendum;
• a petition signed by 500 or more
Stanford students;
• an item submitted by an Academic
Council Standing Committee.
Several other methods exist, where
by the full Academic Council (regular
line faculty) must pass referendums or
have Academic Council Standing Com
mittees introduce resolutions after
lengthy procedures. These are more
cumbersome mechanisms to deal with;
therefore they are seldom used. The
methods outlined above have been the
common methods for introducing reso
lutions.
In addition to the advance verbal
and written information provided by
Chair Jones to those students with
whom she talked before last Thurs
day's meeting, the senate handbook
rules were placed at the seats of stu
dents visitors to the senate, and passed
out to many students who stood out-

side the senate meeting room. The aca
demic secretary's office stands ready to
answer any procedural questions at any
time.
