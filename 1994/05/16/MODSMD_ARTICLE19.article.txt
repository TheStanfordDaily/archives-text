## Tennis advances to NCAA semis Women face top-ranked Texas today in rematch from last year 
### Rob Ross Senior staff writer 
ATHENS, Ga. — Perhaps it's the
weather. Hot sticky air has blanketed
the Magill Tennis Complex here at the
University of Georgia and may explain
the lack of upsets in the first three
rounds of the NCAA Women's Tennis
Championships. Moving itself is a
chore, so jumping over taller squads
has been impossible as the lower seeds
have fallen like dominoes in this luxu
rious tennis complex.
Number 13 beat No. 17, but lost to
No. 2. Number 8 beat No. 11, but lost
to No. 3. Number 6 beat No. 10, but
lost to No. 4. And in this numerical
shuffle, the four top seeds have
emerged unscathed, ready to do battle
in today's semifinals.
The paths these top seeds have fol
lowed are nearly identical. Stanford,
Texas, Georgia and California all won
either 5-1 or 5-2 in Saturday's second
round matches after first-round byes.
Each then turned up the tempo yes
terday and dominated the quarterfi
nals.
The Cardinal's trip has been
smooth. As the No. 3 seed, Stanford
(22-2) faced 15th-seed Notre Dame

(17-9) on Saturday and dismantled the
Fighting Irish 5-1. Uncharacteristical
ly, the Cardinal's one blemish came at
No. 1 singles, where second-ranked
Laxmi Poruri fell to 16th-ranked
Wendy Crabtree 1-6, 6-4, 6-3.
"It was definitely my biggest win,"
Crabtree said. "In the second and
third sets I just played with patience
and kept putting the ball in play."
Except for this upset, the rest of the
Stanford lineup handled Notre Dame
quickly, winning the other five ladder
positions in straight sets.
"Stanford is 100 times better now
than at the Indoors," said Irish head
coach Jay Louderback, whose team
lost to the Cardinal earlier this season
at the National Collegiate Indoor
Championships. "They have a legiti
mate chance at winning the whole
thing."
Coach Louderback saw a different
Stanford ladder on Saturday than at
the NCIC. As expected, after her Pacif
ic 10 Singles Championship two weeks
ago, freshman Sandra De Silva moved
from No. 6 singles all the way up to
No. 4, as her Rolex National Ranking
leaped up 45 spots, from 85 to 40. On
Saturday she justified this move, beat
ing Sherri Vitale 6-0, 6-2.

Sophomore Wendy Sacks also
moved into the Cardinal lineup, as
sophomore Beth Berris is sidelined
with tendinitis in her arm. At No. 6
singles Sacks dismantled Lisa Tholen
6-4, 6-0.
Listed as "day-to-day" according to
head coach Frank Brennan, Berris
rested yesterday as well, but the Car
dinal did not suffer as it snuffed out
eighth-seeded Pepperdine (18-5) 5-1.
The story was similar to Saturday's as
all the Stanford victories came in
straight sets. The only Cardinal loss
was also a two-set affair, as De Silva
dropped her first dual match of the
season to Nina Eriksson 6-3, 7-5.
The Stanford "W's" were convinc
ing. Poruri rebounded from her second
dual-match loss of the season to dis
pose of 52nd-ranked Isabela Petrov 6-
2, 6-1.
"Yesterday I played great tennis for
a set and a half, then went to outer
space," Poruri said. "I was much more
focused today from start to finish."
Kristine Kurth and Katie Schluke
bir both continued their strong play at
No. 2 and No. 3 singles for the Cardi
nal. Schlukebir, a freshman, concen-

Laxmi Poruri, a senior, powers a forehand in a match earlier this year. Over the week
end in Athens, Ga. Poruri and the rest of the Cardinal squad advanced to the semifi
nals in the NCAA Championships.
