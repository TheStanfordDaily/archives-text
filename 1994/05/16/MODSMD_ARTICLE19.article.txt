## Tennis advances to NCAA semis Women face top-ranked Texas today in rematch from last year 
### Rob Ross Senior staff writer 
ATHENS, Ga. — Perhaps it's the
weather. Hot sticky air has blanketed
the Magill Tennis Complex here at the
University of Georgia and may explain
the lack of upsets in the first three
rounds of the NCAA Women's Tennis
Championships. Moving itself is a
chore, so jumping over taller squads
has been impossible as the lower seeds
have fallen like dominoes in this luxu
rious tennis complex.
Number 13 beat No. 17, but lost to
No. 2. Number 8 beat No. 11, but lost
to No. 3. Number 6 beat No. 10, but
lost to No. 4. And in this numerical
shuffle, the four top seeds have
emerged unscathed, ready to do battle
in today's semifinals.
The paths these top seeds have fol
lowed are nearly identical. Stanford,
Texas, Georgia and California all won
either 5-1 or 5-2 in Saturday's second
round matches after first-round byes.
Each then turned up the tempo yes
terday and dominated the quarterfi
nals.
The Cardinal's trip has been
smooth. As the No. 3 seed, Stanford
(22-2) faced 15th-seed Notre Dame

(17-9) on Saturday and dismantled the
Fighting Irish 5-1. Uncharacteristical
ly, the Cardinal's one blemish came at
No. 1 singles, where second-ranked
Laxmi Poruri fell to 16th-ranked
Wendy Crabtree 1-6, 6-4, 6-3.
"It was definitely my biggest win,"
Crabtree said. "In the second and
third sets I just played with patience
and kept putting the ball in play."
Except for this upset, the rest of the
Stanford lineup handled Notre Dame
quickly, winning the other five ladder
positions in straight sets.
"Stanford is 100 times better now
than at the Indoors," said Irish head
coach Jay Louderback, whose team
lost to the Cardinal earlier this season
at the National Collegiate Indoor
Championships. "They have a legiti
mate chance at winning the whole
thing."
Coach Louderback saw a different
Stanford ladder on Saturday than at
the NCIC. As expected, after her Pacif
ic 10 Singles Championship two weeks
ago, freshman Sandra De Silva moved
from No. 6 singles all the way up to
No. 4, as her Rolex National Ranking
leaped up 45 spots, from 85 to 40. On
Saturday she justified this move, beat
ing Sherri Vitale 6-0, 6-2.

Sophomore Wendy Sacks also
moved into the Cardinal lineup, as
sophomore Beth Berris is sidelined
with tendinitis in her arm. At No. 6
singles Sacks dismantled Lisa Tholen
6-4, 6-0.
Listed as "day-to-day" according to
head coach Frank Brennan, Berris
rested yesterday as well, but the Car
dinal did not suffer as it snuffed out
eighth-seeded Pepperdine (18-5) 5-1.
The story was similar to Saturday's as
all the Stanford victories came in
straight sets. The only Cardinal loss
was also a two-set affair, as De Silva
dropped her first dual match of the
season to Nina Eriksson 6-3, 7-5.
The Stanford "W's" were convinc
ing. Poruri rebounded from her second
dual-match loss of the season to dis
pose of 52nd-ranked Isabela Petrov 6-
2, 6-1.
"Yesterday I played great tennis for
a set and a half, then went to outer
space," Poruri said. "I was much more
focused today from start to finish."
Kristine Kurth and Katie Schluke
bir both continued their strong play at
No. 2 and No. 3 singles for the Cardi
nal. Schlukebir, a freshman, concen-

nals in the NCAA Championships.
trated on "staying loose," and
in the process defeated the
Waves' Merete Stockmann 6-2,
6-2.
Natasha Pospich gave Kurth
more of a struggle. Serving
underhand to protect her
injured shoulder, Pospich
fought a back-and-forth battle
with the senior, yet lost many
of the big points and the match
7-5, 6-4.
"It took me half a set to
adjust to her serves," Kurth
said. "I came out and tried to
bash it, but then I settled down
and was able to hit out."
As Stanford blasted its way
to today's 10 a.m. (EST) semifi
nals-final showdown, its slated
opponent was equally impres
sive. The Lady Longhorns of
Texas (24-0) slipped by Arizona
(12-13) on Saturday 5-2, then
skinned the Florida Gators (23-
6) yesterday 6-0, with five of
those six victories coming in
straight sets.
"We got the stew beat out of
us," said Florida head coach
Andy Brandi.
This beating of a team Stan
ford lost to earlier in the sea
son sets up a match that has
become a tradition at the
NCAA Championships.
"We look forward to playing
Texas," Brennan said. "It

seems it wouldn't be a true
NCAA tournament for us with
out playing Texas somewhere
along the line."
This year will be somewhat
different though, as the unde
feated Longhorn squad will be
the clear favorite over the Car
dinal.
Moreover, the Longhorns
have knocked higher-ranked
Stanford squads out of this
tournament twice in the last
two years. Texas players dis
missed any idea of the added
pressure of being the favorite,
though.
"I think they should be more
nervous because they lost to us
the last two years," said Texas
freshman Farley Taylor. "If we
play great tennis we shouldn't
have too much of a problem
with them."
Pepperdine coach Gualberto
Escudero disagrees, after hav
ing played both teams this sea
son.
"I pick Stanford because I
think they have something to
prove," he said. "They believe
they are the dark horse of the
tournament and are hungry to
win."
So today's semifinals pit No.
1 Texas against No. 3 Stanford
and No. 2 Georgia (25-2)
against No. 4 Cal (18-3). And as
the wind picks up around Mag
ill Tennis Complex, the relative
quiet of the first three days
reveals a calm before a storm.

trated on "staying loose," and
in the process defeated the
Waves' Merete Stockmann 6-2,
6-2.
Natasha Pospich gave Kurth
more of a struggle. Serving
underhand to protect her
injured shoulder, Pospich
fought a back-and-forth battle
with the senior, yet lost many
of the big points and the match
7-5, 6-4.
"It took me half a set to
adjust to her serves," Kurth
said. "I came out and tried to
bash it, but then I settled down
and was able to hit out."
As Stanford blasted its way
to today's 10 a.m. (EST) semifi
nals-final showdown, its slated
opponent was equally impres
sive. The Lady Longhorns of
Texas (24-0) slipped by Arizona
(12-13) on Saturday 5-2, then
skinned the Florida Gators (23-
6) yesterday 6-0, with five of
those six victories coming in
straight sets.
"We got the stew beat out of
us," said Florida head coach
Andy Brandi.
This beating of a team Stan
ford lost to earlier in the sea
son sets up a match that has
become a tradition at the
NCAA Championships.
"We look forward to playing
Texas," Brennan said. "It

seems it wouldn't be a true
NCAA tournament for us with
out playing Texas somewhere
along the line."
This year will be somewhat
different though, as the unde
feated Longhorn squad will be
the clear favorite over the Car
dinal.
Moreover, the Longhorns
have knocked higher-ranked
Stanford squads out of this
tournament twice in the last
two years. Texas players dis
missed any idea of the added
pressure of being the favorite,
though.
"I think they should be more
nervous because they lost to us
the last two years," said Texas
freshman Farley Taylor. "If we
play great tennis we shouldn't
have too much of a problem
with them."
Pepperdine coach Gualberto
Escudero disagrees, after hav
ing played both teams this sea
son.
"I pick Stanford because I
think they have something to
prove," he said. "They believe
they are the dark horse of the
tournament and are hungry to
win."
So today's semifinals pit No.
1 Texas against No. 3 Stanford
and No. 2 Georgia (25-2)
against No. 4 Cal (18-3). And as
the wind picks up around Mag
ill Tennis Complex, the relative
quiet of the first three days
reveals a calm before a storm.

Kristine Kurth hits a shot from a match earlier this year. She won both
her singles matches in helping Stanford set up a rematch with Texas.
ATHENS, Ga. — Perhaps it's the
weather. Hot sticky air has blanketed
the Magill Tennis Complex here at the
University of Georgia and may explain
the lack of upsets in the first three
rounds of the NCAA Women's Tennis
Championships. Moving itself is a
chore, so jumping over taller squads
has been impossible as the lower seeds
have fallen like dominoes in this luxu
rious tennis complex.
Number 13 beat No. 17, but lost to
No. 2. Number 8 beat No. 11, but lost
to No. 3. Number 6 beat No. 10, but
lost to No. 4. And in this numerical
shuffle, the four top seeds have
emerged unscathed, ready to do battle
in today's semifinals.
The paths these top seeds have fol
lowed are nearly identical. Stanford,
Texas, Georgia and California all won
either 5-1 or 5-2 in Saturday's second
round matches after first-round byes.
Each then turned up the tempo yes
terday and dominated the quarterfi
nals.
The Cardinal's trip has been
smooth. As the No. 3 seed, Stanford
(22-2) faced 15th-seed Notre Dame

(17-9) on Saturday and dismantled the
Fighting Irish 5-1. Uncharacteristical
ly, the Cardinal's one blemish came at
No. 1 singles, where second-ranked
Laxmi Poruri fell to 16th-ranked
Wendy Crabtree 1-6, 6-4, 6-3.
"It was definitely my biggest win,"
Crabtree said. "In the second and
third sets I just played with patience
and kept putting the ball in play."
Except for this upset, the rest of the
Stanford lineup handled Notre Dame
quickly, winning the other five ladder
positions in straight sets.
"Stanford is 100 times better now
than at the Indoors," said Irish head
coach Jay Louderback, whose team
lost to the Cardinal earlier this season
at the National Collegiate Indoor
Championships. "They have a legiti
mate chance at winning the whole
thing."
Coach Louderback saw a different
Stanford ladder on Saturday than at
the NCIC. As expected, after her Pacif
ic 10 Singles Championship two weeks
ago, freshman Sandra De Silva moved
from No. 6 singles all the way up to
No. 4, as her Rolex National Ranking
leaped up 45 spots, from 85 to 40. On
Saturday she justified this move, beat
ing Sherri Vitale 6-0, 6-2.

Sophomore Wendy Sacks also
moved into the Cardinal lineup, as
sophomore Beth Berris is sidelined
with tendinitis in her arm. At No. 6
singles Sacks dismantled Lisa Tholen
6-4, 6-0.
Listed as "day-to-day" according to
head coach Frank Brennan, Berris
rested yesterday as well, but the Car
dinal did not suffer as it snuffed out
eighth-seeded Pepperdine (18-5) 5-1.
The story was similar to Saturday's as
all the Stanford victories came in
straight sets. The only Cardinal loss
was also a two-set affair, as De Silva
dropped her first dual match of the
season to Nina Eriksson 6-3, 7-5.
The Stanford "W's" were convinc
ing. Poruri rebounded from her second
dual-match loss of the season to dis
pose of 52nd-ranked Isabela Petrov 6-
2, 6-1.
"Yesterday I played great tennis for
a set and a half, then went to outer
space," Poruri said. "I was much more
focused today from start to finish."
