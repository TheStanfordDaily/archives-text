# Student wins deportation battle

Garcia finally won his four-year struggle
to remain in the United States Friday
when an Immigration and Naturaliza
tion Service judge ruled against deport
ing him to Mexico.
On Friday afternoon, when Molina
appeared for a "suspension of deporta
tion" hearing, Judge Bette Stockton
granted him the permanent residency
that he has sought since he crossed the
U.S.-Mexico border illegally a decade
ago. Stockton said Molina had made a
significant contribution to this country
and is likelv to continue to do so, the As

sociated Press reported.
"I think the many letters supporting
me helped to show that I would not be a
burden and that it would be hard for me
to return to Mexico after 10 years when
all of my family is here," said Molina,
who will graduate next month with a
civil engineering degree.
Molina first encountered serious
problems with the INS in 1990, when he
received a letter indicating that he
might be deported.
Molina's mother became a legal resi
dent under a 1986 INS amnesty pro
gram for illegal immigrants who arrived
before 1982, but the permanent residen
cy did not automatically include her chil
dren.

Molina's brothers and sisters, who
had crossed into the United States at dif
ferent times, each had to apply for per
manent residency on an individual
basis. But Molina could not qualify for
the program because he arrived in the
country in 1984, two years after the cut
off.
He petitioned for permanent residen
cy, but became ineligible to petition as a
child upon turning 18. The INS placed
his application in the adult category,
which would have meant an "eight-year
wait to become a permanent resident,"
Molina said. While waiting, he would not
have been able to travel freely or get
married.
After realizing how long he
would have to wait and consider
ing the chances that he would be
deported, Molina and his lawyer
decided to ask for a "suspension of
deportation hearing," with the
hope that the judge would not
force him to leave the United
States.
"It was kind of risky, hut it was
a lot quicker than waiting," Moli

na said.
Molina believes that the sup
port he received from his profes
sors, teachers and friends had a
very significant effect on the out
come of the hearing.
"I think it had a bearing on the
decision. You have to prove that
you're not going to be a burden on
society and that it would be a
hardship on you and your family
if you were deported," he said.
Prof. Jeffrey Koseff, who
taught Molina in a civil engineer
ing course, was one of the numer
ous people who wrote character
references for Molina.

He said a great deal of empha
sis was placed on what Molina's
societal role would be if he were
permitted to remain in the coun
try. "Servando proved that, as an
engineer, he would not be a drain
on the community but rather a
productive member of society,"
Koseff said.
Molina expressed his relief
that the whole ordeal has finally
ended. "I was in sort of a limbo
during those four years, but now
I'm really happy," he said, adding
that he will be eligible to apply for
citizenship in five years and is
eagerly waiting to do so.
