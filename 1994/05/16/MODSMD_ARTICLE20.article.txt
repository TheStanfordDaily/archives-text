# Cardinal placed in unusual role of dark horse due to injuries, lower seed

ATHENS, Ga. — Despite a late-season
lineup adjustment, a pre-tournament
injury and an uncharacteristically low
third seed, the Stanford women's tennis
team was able to pick up momentum this
weekend as it heads into its 10th consec
utive appearance in the NCAA Women's
Tennis Championship semifinals.
The placement of freshman sensation
Sandra De Silva into the No. 4 singles
position, an injury to No. 6 singles player
Beth Berris and the unfamiliar feeling of
being the dark horse have not prevented
Cardinal success thus far.
In a second-round match against
Notre Dame, the No. 40-ranked De Silva

served notice that she was ready to play
at her new position. By virtue of a 6-0, 6-
2 trouncing of Sherri Vitale she was the
first Stanford player to leave the court.
"De Silva is I good enough to be| at
least their No. 4 player," said Texas head
coach Jeff Moore.
Unfortunately, De Silva's dual-match
record was not to remain unblemished.
Despite witnessing the first dual-match
defeat of De Silva's career in her quar
terfinal match against Pepperdine's
Nina Eriksson, Stanford head coach
Frank Brennan was sticking with his
guns.
"I'm not worried about Sandra —
she's an unbelievable competitor," Bren
nan said.
In addition, Brennan saw little reason

for De Silva to be upset.
"I said to Sandra after the match, 'You
were 21-0 [coming into the tourney] in
dual matches, you were the Pac-10
Indoor Champion at [ flight J 4 or 5, then
you won the Pac-10 Singles Champi
onship and that takes it toll. There are
some undefeated heavyweight boxing
champions, but there are no undefeated
tennis players," Brennan said.
De Silva said she "didn't get into it
mentally enough until it was too late."
By winning all five of their matches,
however, De Silva's teammates rendered
her loss moot. This time, the first player
to leave the court was Berris' replace
ment, sophomore Wendy Sacks.
