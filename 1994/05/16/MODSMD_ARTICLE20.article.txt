# Cardinal placed in unusual role of dark horse due to injuries, lower seed
## 
### Joe Hialowitz Staff writer 
ATHENS, Ga. — Despite a late-season
lineup adjustment, a pre-tournament
injury and an uncharacteristically low
third seed, the Stanford women's tennis
team was able to pick up momentum this
weekend as it heads into its 10th consec
utive appearance in the NCAA Women's
Tennis Championship semifinals.
The placement of freshman sensation
Sandra De Silva into the No. 4 singles
position, an injury to No. 6 singles player
Beth Berris and the unfamiliar feeling of
being the dark horse have not prevented
Cardinal success thus far.
In a second-round match against
Notre Dame, the No. 40-ranked De Silva

served notice that she was ready to play
at her new position. By virtue of a 6-0, 6-
2 trouncing of Sherri Vitale she was the
first Stanford player to leave the court.
"De Silva is I good enough to be| at
least their No. 4 player," said Texas head
coach Jeff Moore.
Unfortunately, De Silva's dual-match
record was not to remain unblemished.
Despite witnessing the first dual-match
defeat of De Silva's career in her quar
terfinal match against Pepperdine's
Nina Eriksson, Stanford head coach
Frank Brennan was sticking with his
guns.
"I'm not worried about Sandra —
she's an unbelievable competitor," Bren
nan said.
In addition, Brennan saw little reason

for De Silva to be upset.
"I said to Sandra after the match, 'You
were 21-0 [coming into the tourney] in
dual matches, you were the Pac-10
Indoor Champion at [ flight J 4 or 5, then
you won the Pac-10 Singles Champi
onship and that takes it toll. There are
some undefeated heavyweight boxing
champions, but there are no undefeated
tennis players," Brennan said.
De Silva said she "didn't get into it
mentally enough until it was too late."
By winning all five of their matches,
however, De Silva's teammates rendered
her loss moot. This time, the first player
to leave the court was Berris' replace
ment, sophomore Wendy Sacks.
"I've been practicing really well
and 1 had a really good Ojai tour
nament [winning the Open Sin
gles Championship|," Sacks said.
Sacks has not played like a
replacement in her two matches
here in Athens, lipping her sea
son's dual match record to 7-1
with convincing scores of 6-4, 6-0
over Notre Dame's Lisa Tholen
and 6-2, 6-0 against Pepperdine's
Pamela Wallenfels.
"We don't seem to be dropping
off much with Wendy," Brennan
said. "Wendy lost four games yes
terday and two games today, so 1
told her 'only one game tomor
row'."

Yet with Berris "getting better
rapidly," Brennan is still consider
ing whether to call upon Sacks in
the semifinal match against
Texas.
"We're going to consider a lot of
factors — how Beth feels, how
she's hitting and if she's up to
speed," Brennan said, adding that
"Beth hasn't played a match this
week or last week so she isn't
match-tough. Wendy is."
Brennan will also have to weigh
one more factor: the last time they
played (in a junior tournament),
Sacks beat Texas' No. 6 player,
Jennifer Nasser.
Against Texas, Stanford will
play without the advantage of
what has seemed to be an impor
tant factor to their success.
Rather than playing on the isolat
ed McWhorter Hall Courts (eapac

ity seating: 400), the Cardinal will
square off in front of 4,500 people
in Henry Feild Stadium. Stan
ford's No. 3 seeding is responsible
for its early tournament place
ment into a low-pressure venue.
"Not being the top seed helps
you focus a little more," said Stan
ford's Laxmi Poruri.
Poruri's teammate, Kristine
Kurth, agreed, saying, "Last year
and the year before, everyone was
like, 'Stanford! Stanford! Stan
ford!' so it's nice to be the under
dogs this time."
Brennan has taken notice of the
effects of dark-horse status on the
team.
"Everybody's playing well,"
Brennan said. "We've been nice
and loose on and off the court."
However, Texas goes into their
match against Stanford with at

least two potential advantages.
Not only have they gained experi
ence playing in Henry Feild Stadi
um during their first two rounds,
but their doubles teams were tour
nament-tested in the second
round. On the other hand, Stan
ford has not been forced to play
doubles matches here in Athens.
Texas' Moore was well aware of
this.
"It was great for us to play dou
bles in a pressure situation, and I
think that will pay off for us later
in the tournament," Moore said.
Stanford's No. 1 doubles player,
Katie Schlukebir, does not see any
reason to question her team's
match toughness, noting all the
duos have played together
throughout the year, and have
clinched victories over California
on two separate occasions.

ATHENS, Ga. — Despite a late-season
lineup adjustment, a pre-tournament
injury and an uncharacteristically low
third seed, the Stanford women's tennis
team was able to pick up momentum this
weekend as it heads into its 10th consec
utive appearance in the NCAA Women's
Tennis Championship semifinals.
The placement of freshman sensation
Sandra De Silva into the No. 4 singles
position, an injury to No. 6 singles player
Beth Berris and the unfamiliar feeling of
being the dark horse have not prevented
Cardinal success thus far.
In a second-round match against
Notre Dame, the No. 40-ranked De Silva

served notice that she was ready to play
at her new position. By virtue of a 6-0, 6-
2 trouncing of Sherri Vitale she was the
first Stanford player to leave the court.
"De Silva is I good enough to be| at
least their No. 4 player," said Texas head
coach Jeff Moore.
Unfortunately, De Silva's dual-match
record was not to remain unblemished.
Despite witnessing the first dual-match
defeat of De Silva's career in her quar
terfinal match against Pepperdine's
Nina Eriksson, Stanford head coach
Frank Brennan was sticking with his
guns.
"I'm not worried about Sandra —
she's an unbelievable competitor," Bren
nan said.
In addition, Brennan saw little reason

for De Silva to be upset.
"I said to Sandra after the match, 'You
were 21-0 [coming into the tourney] in
dual matches, you were the Pac-10
Indoor Champion at [ flight J 4 or 5, then
you won the Pac-10 Singles Champi
onship and that takes it toll. There are
some undefeated heavyweight boxing
champions, but there are no undefeated
tennis players," Brennan said.
De Silva said she "didn't get into it
mentally enough until it was too late."
By winning all five of their matches,
however, De Silva's teammates rendered
her loss moot. This time, the first player
to leave the court was Berris' replace
ment, sophomore Wendy Sacks.
"I've been practicing really well
and 1 had a really good Ojai tour
nament [winning the Open Sin
gles Championship|," Sacks said.
Sacks has not played like a
replacement in her two matches
here in Athens, lipping her sea
son's dual match record to 7-1
with convincing scores of 6-4, 6-0
over Notre Dame's Lisa Tholen
and 6-2, 6-0 against Pepperdine's
Pamela Wallenfels.
"We don't seem to be dropping
off much with Wendy," Brennan
said. "Wendy lost four games yes
terday and two games today, so 1
told her 'only one game tomor
row'."

Yet with Berris "getting better
rapidly," Brennan is still consider
ing whether to call upon Sacks in
the semifinal match against
Texas.
"We're going to consider a lot of
factors — how Beth feels, how
she's hitting and if she's up to
speed," Brennan said, adding that
"Beth hasn't played a match this
week or last week so she isn't
match-tough. Wendy is."
Brennan will also have to weigh
one more factor: the last time they
played (in a junior tournament),
Sacks beat Texas' No. 6 player,
Jennifer Nasser.
Against Texas, Stanford will
play without the advantage of
what has seemed to be an impor
tant factor to their success.
Rather than playing on the isolat
ed McWhorter Hall Courts (eapac

ity seating: 400), the Cardinal will
square off in front of 4,500 people
in Henry Feild Stadium. Stan
ford's No. 3 seeding is responsible
for its early tournament place
ment into a low-pressure venue.
"Not being the top seed helps
you focus a little more," said Stan
ford's Laxmi Poruri.
Poruri's teammate, Kristine
Kurth, agreed, saying, "Last year
and the year before, everyone was
like, 'Stanford! Stanford! Stan
ford!' so it's nice to be the under
dogs this time."
Brennan has taken notice of the
effects of dark-horse status on the
team.
"Everybody's playing well,"
Brennan said. "We've been nice
and loose on and off the court."
However, Texas goes into their
match against Stanford with at

least two potential advantages.
Not only have they gained experi
ence playing in Henry Feild Stadi
um during their first two rounds,
but their doubles teams were tour
nament-tested in the second
round. On the other hand, Stan
ford has not been forced to play
doubles matches here in Athens.
Texas' Moore was well aware of
this.
"It was great for us to play dou
bles in a pressure situation, and I
think that will pay off for us later
in the tournament," Moore said.
Stanford's No. 1 doubles player,
Katie Schlukebir, does not see any
reason to question her team's
match toughness, noting all the
duos have played together
throughout the year, and have
clinched victories over California
on two separate occasions.
