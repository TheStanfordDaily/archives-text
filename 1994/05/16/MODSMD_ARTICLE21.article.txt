# On to the championships
## Women golfers take second in regionals 
### Seth Goldstein Staff writer 
The answer was in Albu
querque all this time.
Throughout the course of
the entire season, the fifth
ranked Stanford women's golf
team has looked for a way to
beat No. 1 Arizona State. But
the linksters could not find it
until they went to the desert
city in question to compete in
the 1994 NCAA West Regionals
at the University of New Mexi
co's Championship Golf Course
this weekend.
The Cardinal finished sec
ond in the 18-team field with
884 strokes, thereby qualifying
for the NCAA Championships
in two weeks. Second-ranked
San Jose State won the tourna
ment with a three-day total of
877 shots.
However, the big story lies
in Stanford's defeat of Arizona
State. The Sun Devils, faltering

in recent weeks, showed more
chinks in their armor with a
third-place finish, three strokes
off the Cardinal's pace.
"It was a real accomplish
ment for us," sophomore Vicky
Strada said. "We've known
they're beatable for a long time
now, and it was just a matter of
going out and doing it. Every
thing came together."
Because Thursday's first
round was postponed due to
wet grounds, the golfers were
required to play 27 holes Fri
day and 27 holes Saturday. The
Stanford squad came out
strong, finishing the first
round in second place behind
the Spartans. However, the
extended days took their toll on
the Cardinal golfers and by the
end of the second set of 18
holes, sixth-ranked Oklahoma
State passed Stanford, drop
ping the team into third.
