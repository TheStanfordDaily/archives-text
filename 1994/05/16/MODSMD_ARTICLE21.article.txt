# On to the championships
## Women golfers take second in regionals 
### Seth Goldstein Staff writer 
The answer was in Albu
querque all this time.
Throughout the course of
the entire season, the fifth
ranked Stanford women's golf
team has looked for a way to
beat No. 1 Arizona State. But
the linksters could not find it
until they went to the desert
city in question to compete in
the 1994 NCAA West Regionals
at the University of New Mexi
co's Championship Golf Course
this weekend.
The Cardinal finished sec
ond in the 18-team field with
884 strokes, thereby qualifying
for the NCAA Championships
in two weeks. Second-ranked
San Jose State won the tourna
ment with a three-day total of
877 shots.
However, the big story lies
in Stanford's defeat of Arizona
State. The Sun Devils, faltering

in recent weeks, showed more
chinks in their armor with a
third-place finish, three strokes
off the Cardinal's pace.
"It was a real accomplish
ment for us," sophomore Vicky
Strada said. "We've known
they're beatable for a long time
now, and it was just a matter of
going out and doing it. Every
thing came together."
Because Thursday's first
round was postponed due to
wet grounds, the golfers were
required to play 27 holes Fri
day and 27 holes Saturday. The
Stanford squad came out
strong, finishing the first
round in second place behind
the Spartans. However, the
extended days took their toll on
the Cardinal golfers and by the
end of the second set of 18
holes, sixth-ranked Oklahoma
State passed Stanford, drop
ping the team into third.
On Saturday, the squad played
the last six holes of the tourna
ment at eight under par. The out
standing finish enabled the Car
dinal to regain second place and
hold off a late run by the Sun
Devils and assorted other chal
lengers. This bodes well for the
NCAA Championships.
"It gives us a lot of confidence
going into the nationals," said
junior Amy Lawrence. "We've
proven we can beat everyone
now."
This performance was not the
top of the mountain, either. As
freshman Mhairi McKay pointed
out, the slightly sub-par second
round shows there still is room
for improvement.
"The second round set us
back," she said. "We might have
won if not for that."
In addition to the team's
accomplishment, McKay also dis
played her abilities to the golf
community. Snubbed by the
selection committee which picked
the All-Pac-10 first team, the

freshman finished third overall
with 216 strokes, ahead of every
other Pac-10 player. Only Okla
homa State's Charlotta Eliasson
and San Jose State's Janice
Moodie defeated the golfer, who
Stanford head coach Tim Bald
win said he considers "the best
player in the Pac-10."
"I hopes she shows them what
she's made of," said Baldwin
prior to the contest.
It appears that she has. On
Saturday, she led the team's
charge by playing out the last
four holes with three birdies and
an eagle, a finish unmatched by
any in the memories of Baldwin
and other coaches.
"Neither I nor any of the oth
ers I've checked with knows of
anything like this happening
before," he said.
The rest of the Stanford com
petitors also did extremely well,
as no player was more than 18
strokes out of first place. Junior
Jamille Jose tied for 13th with a
total of 2*21 strokes, senior Melin
da Daniels placed 19th with 223,
Strada ended the contest tied for
28th with 226 and Lawrence fin
ished tied for 51st with 232.
