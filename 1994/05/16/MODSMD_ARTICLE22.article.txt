# VanDerveer finalizes U.S. women's team
## Azzi only Cardinal on 12-member squad 
### Brian Egan Senior staff writer 
Put Sheryl Swoopes, Lisa
Lesley and Teresa Edwards on
the same squad, and you've got a
Dream Team as exciting as any
National Basketball Association
group.
Swoopes, Lesley and Edwards
lead the 12-member 1994 USA
Women's National Basketball
Team, which wraps up its sec
ond week of practice at Maples
Pavilion over the next three
days.
Roughly 2,000 fans turned
out for an intra-squad scrim
mage Saturday night at Maples,
the team's final competition
before the roster was trimmed
from 18 to 12 players yesterday.
"It gave peopie a chance to
see some pretty good basket
ball," said coach Tara Van-
Derveer. "We've gotten great
support from the Stanford
fans."
The squad will compete in

two international tournaments,
next month's FIBA World
Championship Games in Syd
ney, Australia, and the Goodwill
Games in St. Petersburg, Rus
sia, in August.
VanDerveer, who also coach
es the Stanford women's basket
ball team, brought her squad to
campus after a week of tryouts
at United States Olympic facili
ties in Colorado Springs, Colo.
"It's been a lot of fun for me,"
Swoopes said as she signed auto
graphs after the scrimmage.
"But it's been tough on me men
tally."
Swoopes, a two-time All-
America guard from Texas Tech,
won the Naismith Award last
year, an honor given to the top
women's college player in the
country. Now she's struggling to
digest VanDerveer's offensive
and defensive system, modeled
largely on plays used by Stanford
during the collegiate season.
"I'm used to it all," said Anita
Kaplan, the Cardinal's junior cen
ter, who was one of the final cuts
made yesterday."I know the
plays and the drills — that's been
a big advantage for me."
Kaplan, who garnered All-
Pacific 10 Conference honors in
1993-94, felt the effects of the try
outs in other ways, as witnessed
by the ice packs she applied to her
back after Saturday's scrimmage.
Every night, the women practice
against men brought in from the
area by VanDerveer and her staff.
It didn't get any easier for the
6-foot-5 Kaplan in Saturday's
scrimmage — she squared off
against 6-foot-7, 238-pound Kara
Wolters, the tallest person on the
USA Women's roster.
"I'm getting a little banged up,
but it's been a challenge," Kaplan
said. "I'm holding my head up out
there."
Jennifer Azzi is the only Stan
ford alum on the team's final ros

ter, as Kaplan and Val Whiting
both fell prey to cuts yesterday.
Cardinal players who were cut
earlier in the tryouts included
guards Christy Hedgpeth and
Molly Goodenbour, both members
of Stanford's 1992 NCAA Champi
onship squad, and forward Katy
Steding, a 1990 graduate.
"It was great to have three
Stanford players among the final
18," VanDerveer said. "But I
didn't favor them in the tryouts.
If anything, I was more critical of
them than the other players."
The final roster reads like a
Who's Who in U.S. women's bas
ketball today.
Azzi, the 1989-90 Naismith
Player of the Year, Edwards, a
three-time Olympian and
Swoopes are joined in the back
court by Dena Head, Dawn Staley
and Ruthie Bolton-Holifield.
Under the boards, the squad
features Lesley, Wolters, Andrea
Lloyd, Katrina McClain, Carla
McGhee and Daedra Charles.
"I don't know much about the
competition we'll face," Van-
Derveer said, "But we've got a
long way to go."
