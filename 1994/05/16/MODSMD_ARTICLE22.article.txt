## Azzi only Cardinal on 12-member squad 
### Brian Egan Senior staff writer 
Put Sheryl Swoopes, Lisa
Lesley and Teresa Edwards on
the same squad, and you've got a
Dream Team as exciting as any
National Basketball Association
group.
Swoopes, Lesley and Edwards
lead the 12-member 1994 USA
Women's National Basketball
Team, which wraps up its sec
ond week of practice at Maples
Pavilion over the next three
days.
Roughly 2,000 fans turned
out for an intra-squad scrim
mage Saturday night at Maples,
the team's final competition
before the roster was trimmed
from 18 to 12 players yesterday.
"It gave peopie a chance to
see some pretty good basket
ball," said coach Tara Van-
Derveer. "We've gotten great
support from the Stanford
fans."
The squad will compete in

two international tournaments,
next month's FIBA World
Championship Games in Syd
ney, Australia, and the Goodwill
Games in St. Petersburg, Rus
sia, in August.
VanDerveer, who also coach
es the Stanford women's basket
ball team, brought her squad to
campus after a week of tryouts
at United States Olympic facili
ties in Colorado Springs, Colo.
"It's been a lot of fun for me,"
Swoopes said as she signed auto
graphs after the scrimmage.
"But it's been tough on me men
tally."
Swoopes, a two-time All-
America guard from Texas Tech,
won the Naismith Award last
year, an honor given to the top
women's college player in the
country. Now she's struggling to
digest VanDerveer's offensive
and defensive system, modeled
largely on plays used by Stanford
during the collegiate season.
