# Baseball clinches Six-Pac
## 
### Andy Eiser Senior staff writer 
TEMPE, Ariz. — They took it
to the limit, and then some. But
when the Packard Stadium dust
finally settled in this quaint
Phoenix suburb, the Cardinal
baseball team ascended from the
ashes of last place to Pacific 10
Conference Championship glory.
After dropping an 8-4 decision
to runner-up Arizona State Fri
day and losing a 5-4 nailbiter to
the Sun Devils Saturday, No. 12
Stanford captured its sixth Six-
Pac crown in 12 seasons with a
10-inning, 7-5 victory that com
pleted one of the most dramatic
turnarounds in the division's IB
year existence.
"It's hard to explain with
words," said junior leftfielder
Steve Carver, whose two-run
home run sparked a furious 10th
inning Cardinal rally, in an inter
view with KZSU. "The way the
year ended up here, down to the
last batter, is the way it should
be."
Stanford (36-22, 21-9 in the
Six-Pac), which improved 11
games from a 10-20 conference
record of a year ago, did not make
its first Six-Pac title since 1990
look easy. The No. 11 Sun Devils
(39-18, 20-10) pulled even in the
standings after Saturday night's
win, and looked poised to hand
the Cardinal its first conference
sweep of the season by forcing
what amounted to a one-game
playoff yesterday.
"That was the most intense,
most incredible ballgame I've
ever been involved with," said
senior outfielder Rod Meyer in a
KZSU interview.
Meyer, who in the fifth
inning made his earliest appear
ance as a defensive replacement
in right field, nearly became the
hero when his solo home run
gave Stanford its second lead in
the top of the eighth.
'It was the greatest
moment of my life.
I rounded first and
I couSdn t believe
it was happening.'
— Rod Meyer
"It was the greatest moment
of my life," Meyer said. "I
rounded first and I couldn't
believe it was happening."
The Sun Devils clawed back
in the bottom of the eighth, tal
lying an unearned run off an
error by Cardinal junior left
fielder Jimmy Noriega. Noriega
entered the game in the sev
enth, when Carver filled in at
first base for junior Dusty Allen.
Allen, Stanford sophomore
third baseman Brian Dallimore,
ASU senior reliever Noah Peery
and Sun Devils coach Jim Brock
were ejected following a bench
clearing brawl touched off when
Peery taunted Allen after strik
ing him out.
The tying run negated the
performance of Cardinal fresh
man starter Jason Middlebrook,
who yielded just two earned
runs on five hits in 7-1/3
innings in the biggest start of
his collegiate career.
Sophomore catcher A.J.
Hinch then doubled a 1-0 Cardi
nal advantage in the sixth,
blasting a one-out solo home
run over the 395-foot sign in
center field.
Hut Arizona State junior cen
terfielder Jacob Cruz got the
Sun Devils even with one swing,
cranking his 12th homer over
the right-field wall to pick up
senior designated hitter Sean
Tyler in the bottom of the sixth.
Stanford manufactured two
important insurance runs off
Arizona State senior reliever
Travis Gribler (2-1) following
Carver's shot in the 10th. Meyer
reached on a passed-ball third
strike to start the Cardinal run,
which junior second baseman
Jed Hansen capped with a per
fect bunt single down the third
base line.

Yet the four runs nearly
failed to stand up for Stanford,
as junior reliever Matt
Marenghi (4-3), who had spelled
Middlebrook in the eighth,
began to tire.
Cruz singled to lead off the
bottom of the inning, and came
around to score when Hansen
fielded a ground ball from Sun
Devils junior catcher Todd Cady
and threw a potential force
relay into left field. Cady later
scored on a single and a sacrifice
fly.
Marenghi struck out Sun
Devils sophomore pinch hitter
Jake Steimkemper for the sec
ond out of the inning, but was
lifted after allowing a pinch-hit
single and walking junior short
stop Randy Betten to load the
bases.
Reimers, the Cardinal's stop
per all season, then ended the
game and picked up his ninth
save when Shores chased a full
count fastball.
"I saw him miss and the first

thing I did was exhale and give a
big sigh of relief," Reimers said.
"It was the weirdest feeling. I've
never been in a game like that."
Reimers could have experi
enced the exhilaration of win
ning Saturday if an eighth
inning Cardinal rally had not
fallen short.
Down 5-2 heading into the
frame, Stanford scored two runs
on RBI by Carver and sopho
more centerfielder Cale Carter.
However, Peery stemmed the
threat and pitched a perfect
ninth for the Sun Devils to earn
his 10th save and preserve the
win for freshman starter Kaipo
Spenser (10-0).
Friday's game did not afford
the Cardinal similar opportuni
ties, as Cady bashed a grand
slam off Stanford starter Dan
Reed (10-4) to spark a five-run
fourth that would provide all
the runs Arizona State needed.
Freshman starter Billy Neal
picked up the victory to improve
to 7-4.
