### Rosalind Wang Staff writer 
Hoping to become the new di
rector of the American Indian
Program Office next fall, five
semifinalists selected in a search
for Jim Larimore's replacement
will make presentations over the
next two weeks.
The search began in March
after Vice Provost for Student Af

fairs Mary Edmonds lifted a hir
ing freeze caused by budget con
cerns. About 70 people applied for
the position, said John Pearson,
director of Bechtel International
Center and chair of the search
committee.
"There's a pretty strong con
sensus in the search committee
that the five candidates we're
bringing in are very, very good,"
Pearson said.
The candidates will visit cam
pus beginning this week to meet
with Edmonds, the search com
mittee, Dean of Students Michael
Jackson, students and staff at the
ethnic centers. Each candidate
will give an open presentation at
4 p.m. in the Native American
Cultural Center within the next
two weeks.
The search committee, com
prised of student, staff and fac
ulty members, will then submit
an unranked list of three final

ists to Jackson. "The intent of
the committee and Dean Jack
son is to have a decision made by
the end of the quarter," Pearson
said.
He cited "strong experience
with Native American communi
ties, whether at universities or in
other aspects of their lives" as the
main criterium for the selection
of the finalists.
The first presentation will be
given tomorrow by candidate
Adrian Tanekeyowma, assistant
director of Educational Support
Programs at Northern Arizona
University.
Glenn Johnson, director of the
American Indian Graduate Cen
ter at the University of Arizona,
will present on Friday.

The former director of Native
American Student Services at
Colorado State University, Fran
cis Becenti, will speak next Mon
day.
On May 25, Dona Thompson,
interim director of the Division of
Multicultural Student Services at
Washington State University, will
meet with interested students,
faculty and staff.
The last presentation will be
given by Benny Shendo, director
of the Native American Program
in the University of New Mexi
co's college of engineering, on
May 31.
Larimore announced his resig
nation in November of last year.
He plans to continue his studies
in the School of Education.
