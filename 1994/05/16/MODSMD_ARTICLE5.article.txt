### Michael Slemmer Editorial staff with AP wire reports 
Stanford graduate Stephen Breyer was
nominated to the Supreme Court Friday,
grabbing accolades from across the country
and at Stanford, where faculty members
say he could contribute a new viewpoint
with his thoughtful style.
Breyer, currently chief judge of the Ist
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, graduated in
the top 5 percent of Stanford's class of 1959
with a major in philosophy. If confirmed by
the Senate in the upcoming weeks, he will
join Stanford graduates Justices Sandra
Day O'Connor and Anthony Kennedy as
well as Chief Justice William Rehnquist,
bringing the total number of alumni on the
high court to four.
President Clinton nominated Breyer,
who was largely considered to be his "safe-

ty" choice to replace retir
ingjustice Harry A. Black
mun, after a lengthy delib
eration process.
Although Breyer at
tended and taught at Har
vard Law School, profes
sors at Stanford who
know the nominee offer
glowing critiques of his
possibilities.

"This is someone who works well with
others, can work in the spirit of compro
mise and will get along with the moderate
centrists" on the court, said Kathleen Sul
livan, a Stanford law professor who taught
alongside Breyer at Harvard.
"His mind works at top speed," she said,
adding that Breyer could oppose the con
servative members of the court."He is
someone that Justice |Antonin| Scalia is
