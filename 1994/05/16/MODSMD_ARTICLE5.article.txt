# Breyer nominated to Supreme Court post
## Selection of Stanford alum garners praise 
### Michael Slemmer Editorial staff with AP wire reports 
Stanford graduate Stephen Breyer was
nominated to the Supreme Court Friday,
grabbing accolades from across the country
and at Stanford, where faculty members
say he could contribute a new viewpoint
with his thoughtful style.
Breyer, currently chief judge of the Ist
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, graduated in
the top 5 percent of Stanford's class of 1959
with a major in philosophy. If confirmed by
the Senate in the upcoming weeks, he will
join Stanford graduates Justices Sandra
Day O'Connor and Anthony Kennedy as
well as Chief Justice William Rehnquist,
bringing the total number of alumni on the
high court to four.
President Clinton nominated Breyer,
who was largely considered to be his "safe-

ty" choice to replace retir
ingjustice Harry A. Black
mun, after a lengthy delib
eration process.
Although Breyer at
tended and taught at Har
vard Law School, profes
sors at Stanford who
know the nominee offer
glowing critiques of his
possibilities.

"This is someone who works well with
others, can work in the spirit of compro
mise and will get along with the moderate
centrists" on the court, said Kathleen Sul
livan, a Stanford law professor who taught
alongside Breyer at Harvard.
"His mind works at top speed," she said,
adding that Breyer could oppose the con
servative members of the court."He is
someone that Justice |Antonin| Scalia is


Breyer
going to have to respect as his lib
eral counterpart on the court,"
Sullivan said.
On the whole, Breyer is consid
ered to be both moderately liberal
in his decisions and someone who
ponders legal questions at a very
deep, oflen philosophical level. For
example, he believes that judges
should consider the intent of legis
lators when interpreting laws by
examining the record of the debate.
This type of belief has led some
to criticize Breyer for rendering
decisions solely on "book law."
But Sullivan said that Breyer is
"a man who writes in a clear lan
guage that non-lawyers can
understand," and thinks about
how the issues he considers will
affect the average person.
At Stanford, even professors
who have never worked closely
with Breyer are supporting the
nomination. "From what I've read,
I think he's a good choice," said
Law School Prof. William Cohen.
Due to his centrist history, Brey
er is expected to sail through the
conformation process.
"He has a clear grasp of the
law, a boundless respect for the
constitutional and legal rights of
the American people," Clinton
said in announcing Breyer's nom
ination. "He has proven that he
can build an effective consensus
and get people of diverse views to
work together."
Breyer's son, Michael, is cur
rently a freshman at Stanford but
could not be reached for com
ment.
