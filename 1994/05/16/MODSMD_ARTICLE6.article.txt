# Intrusion criticized by Fac Sen members
## 
### Beth Berselli Staff writer 
The disruption of last
week's Faculty Senate
meeting by students sup
porting Asian-American
Studies has led several
faculty members to sug
gest that such methods
are not effective, even
though the goals may be
wort hwhile.
"It was not very per-

suasive to the senate to act in that man
ner," said Political Science Prof. David
Abernethy, a member of the senate.
About 25 members of "Concerned Stu
dents for Asian American Studies" inter
rupted Thursday's meeting to demand that
senators consider their resolution — call
ing for a committee to implement a new

major — at this week's session. As a result
of the unauthorized interruption, the sen
ate voted almost unanimously to adjourn
after only 20 minutes.
Several senate members said the inter
ruption was unnecessary because the steer
ing committee would most likely have put
the resolution on the agenda anyway.
"They were pressing for something that
they already had," said Education Prof.
Myra Strober, a senate member.
But senior Patty Tsai said the coalition
went to the meeting because "a number of
us had serious doubts about whether our
resolution would be placed on the May 19
agenda."
"We didn't go to the meeting with the in
tention of disrupting it or causing an early
adjournment," Tsai added. ''We felt th»t
our request was a very reasonable one."
Senate Chair Pat Jones said she does not

know whether the Asian-Ameri
can Studies resolution will be
placed on the agenda for this
week's meeting.
"We haven't received the res
olution from the students yet,"
Jones said. "If it has 500 signa
tures and is in the correct form
then it will presumably be
placed on the agenda." The deci
sion will be made on Wednesday
night at the steering committee
meeting.
"I don't think that screaming
and shouting will get them any
where," Civil Engineering Prof.
Jeffrey Koseff said. "They need to
work within the committee that
I Dean of Humanities and Sci
ences John] Shoven formed."
Shoven had previously sched
uled a May 27 meeting with stu
dents interested in creating
majors in race and ethnic studies.

Tsai, however, said students
were concerned that Shoven's
committee would merely review
the issue rather than act on it.
"We wanted a committee that
was actually committed to imple
menting Asian-American Stud
ies," she said.
Jones said she believes last
Thursday's events could violate
the University's Campus Disrup
tion Policy. The students could be
subject to disciplinary action for
interfering with the senate's abili
ty to function, she said, adding
that Dean of Students Michael
Jackson is looking into the matter.
Last Thursday's incident was
part of a larger movement to cre
ate programs in race and ethnic
studies. Chicano students staged
a hunger strike almost two weeks
ago, demanding among other
things the creation of a Chicano
Studies program.
The faculty is willing to work
with students to create programs,
Jones said. "Hopefully we can do
things in a constructive way and

avoid confrontational incidents
like Thursday. I'm sympathetic to
the students' feelings that they've
been pushing for this for a long
time," she said. "But they need to
realize that you can't just snap
your fingers and establish a pro
gram overnight."
Discussions about reorganiz
ing "the cultural component of
undergraduate education" have
been going on for the past year,
said Economics Prof. Roger Noll,
a senate member. "The train is
definitely on the track and rolling
in rethinking this area of under
graduate education."
Many faculty support creating
programs in race and ethnicity,
Noll said. "I'm convinced that we
want to have a multicultural,
diverse curriculum," he said. "I'm
just not sure of the best way to go
about doing it."
Abernethy said he supports
creating a program as a "compar
ative study of race and ethnicity."
A student could focus on a partic
ular group, he added.
