# Engineering Day a hit among students

How many bite-size candy bars
can you place in an aluminum foil
boat before it sinks?
About 60 freshmen and sopho
mores from three Sequoia Union
School District high schools found
out Friday at Engineering Day,
sponsored by the Stanford Society
of Chicano/Latino Engineers and
Scientists (SSCLES).
"Seventy-four! Seventv-five!
Aww," shouted SSCLES member
Rolando Zeledon as one alu
minum boat, "El Mojado," or
"The Wet One," tipped over under
the weight of its 75th candy bar.
The students grouped in trios
to construct the boats of alu
minum foil and then tested them
in the water. This hands-on expe
rience was part of the Robot
Demonstration Lab taught by
Zeledon, Art Sandoval and Jorge
Samayoa, graduate students in
mechanical engineering.

The goal of Engineering Day
was "to give I the students] a
glimpse of college life land] moti
vate them to go to college," said
freshman Ofelia San, next year's
SSCLES treasurer. Although en
gineering was emphasized, "we
told them about all majors" be
cause the main message was to
"challenge yourself more," said
San.
Garrett Vargas, the group's
outreach coordinator, added, "We
basically wanted to address the
fact that minorities are underrep
resented in college and especially
in engineering."
The students were split up into
either the "Robot Demonstration
Lab" or "Putting Together Com
puters" for the lab event, one part
of Engineering Day. Other activi
ties included a speech by Noe
Lozano, associate dean of engi
neering and minority engineering
dean, and touring the campus.

Freshmen and sophomores from three Sequoia Union School District high schools construct aluminum
foil boats for Engineering Day, an event sponsored by the Stanford Society of Chicano/Latino Engineers
and Scientists.
In the "Competitive Work
shop," the final event of the day,
the students competed to see who
could build an overpass that could
hold the greatest number of mar
bles.
SSCLES contacted three high
schools and had the counselors
there select the students that
would best benefit from Engi
neering Day, "students that

might not be considering college,"
Vargas added.
Some parts of the presenta
tion were in Spanish to make it
easier for students who might
be in English as a Second Lan
guage classes, "but we didn't
target anyone like that," said
Vargas.
In the Robot Demonstration
Lab, Sandoval explained the his
tory behind projects on which he
had worked, such as an overhead
projector that the company 3M
manufactures. Sandoval helped
design the projector in a mechan

ical engineering class.
Different types of engineers
were described and Sandoval gave
a short biography of his life,
which he told the students was "a
lot like your lives." When dis
cussing graduate school, San
doval said, "I encourage you to do
that."
He urged the students to pur
sue engineering careers, because
"all the stuff you see, someone
had to design and build. . . . We
need more minority engineers,
engineering is fun and interesting
and you can do it."
