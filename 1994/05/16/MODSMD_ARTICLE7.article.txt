How many bite-size candy bars
can you place in an aluminum foil
boat before it sinks?
About 60 freshmen and sopho
mores from three Sequoia Union
School District high schools found
out Friday at Engineering Day,
sponsored by the Stanford Society
of Chicano/Latino Engineers and
Scientists (SSCLES).
"Seventy-four! Seventv-five!
Aww," shouted SSCLES member
Rolando Zeledon as one alu
minum boat, "El Mojado," or
"The Wet One," tipped over under
the weight of its 75th candy bar.
The students grouped in trios
to construct the boats of alu
minum foil and then tested them
in the water. This hands-on expe
rience was part of the Robot
Demonstration Lab taught by
Zeledon, Art Sandoval and Jorge
Samayoa, graduate students in
mechanical engineering.

The goal of Engineering Day
was "to give I the students] a
glimpse of college life land] moti
vate them to go to college," said
freshman Ofelia San, next year's
SSCLES treasurer. Although en
gineering was emphasized, "we
told them about all majors" be
cause the main message was to
"challenge yourself more," said
San.
Garrett Vargas, the group's
outreach coordinator, added, "We
basically wanted to address the
fact that minorities are underrep
resented in college and especially
in engineering."
The students were split up into
either the "Robot Demonstration
Lab" or "Putting Together Com
puters" for the lab event, one part
of Engineering Day. Other activi
ties included a speech by Noe
Lozano, associate dean of engi
neering and minority engineering
dean, and touring the campus.
