### Elizabeth Murtaugh Staff writer 
Several of the nation's fore
most experts on Latin American
and Caribbean literature, film,
politics and culture gathered this
weekend for a two-day symposium
honoring Sylvia Wynter, an es
teemed professor of Afro-
Caribbean literature retiring at
the end of this year.
Wynter teaches in both the
African and Afro-American Stud
ies and Spanish and Portuguese
Departments, which jointly spon
sored the symposium. She is

known not only for her success as
a Stanford professor, but also for
her work as a novelist and critical
theorist.
Her multicultural perspective
on Latin America and the
Caribbean, which "recognizes and
appreciates the region as a unique
site of the rich confluence of Na
tive American, European and
African cultures," has made
meaningful contributions to
scholarship, said Prof. Michael
Predmore, chair of the Depart
ment of Spanish and Portuguese.
The symposium began Friday
with a film titled "Memories of

Underdevelopment" â€” a complex
political analysis of a detached in
tellectual in revolutionary Cuba.
"Memories," directed hv the in
ternationally acclaimed Tomas
Gutierrez Alea, has been cited as
one of the most distinguished
films in Latin American cinematic
history.
Following the viewing of the
film, a panel featuring a celebrated
Cuban novelist, a Cuban actress
and experts on Latin American
film scholarship discussed various
aspects of Alea's "Memories."
