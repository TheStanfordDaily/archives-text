## 
### Elizabeth Murtaugh Staff writer 
Several of the nation's fore
most experts on Latin American
and Caribbean literature, film,
politics and culture gathered this
weekend for a two-day symposium
honoring Sylvia Wynter, an es
teemed professor of Afro-
Caribbean literature retiring at
the end of this year.
Wynter teaches in both the
African and Afro-American Stud
ies and Spanish and Portuguese
Departments, which jointly spon
sored the symposium. She is

known not only for her success as
a Stanford professor, but also for
her work as a novelist and critical
theorist.
Her multicultural perspective
on Latin America and the
Caribbean, which "recognizes and
appreciates the region as a unique
site of the rich confluence of Na
tive American, European and
African cultures," has made
meaningful contributions to
scholarship, said Prof. Michael
Predmore, chair of the Depart
ment of Spanish and Portuguese.
The symposium began Friday
with a film titled "Memories of

Underdevelopment" â€” a complex
political analysis of a detached in
tellectual in revolutionary Cuba.
"Memories," directed hv the in
ternationally acclaimed Tomas
Gutierrez Alea, has been cited as
one of the most distinguished
films in Latin American cinematic
history.
Following the viewing of the
film, a panel featuring a celebrated
Cuban novelist, a Cuban actress
and experts on Latin American
film scholarship discussed various
aspects of Alea's "Memories."
Among the topics discussed
were the differences between Hol
lywood and the Latin American
film industry. Latin American
film "represents the relationship
of the individual to history to a
greater degree than Hollywood
does," said City University of
New York Prof. Jerry Carlson.
Following the panel discussion,
Alea himself spoke about his film,
discussing how the plethora of
scholarship on "Memories" forces
him "to explore the reasons why
the work has persisted."
He also commented on the
regional and cultural differences

between the islands of the
Caribbean, and what he considers
to be a general trend toward a
more unified Caribbean.
On the second day of the sym
posium, an assortment of aca
demics spoke about Wynter's
relationship to the Caribbean
intellectual arena.
Paget Henry, professor of soci
ology and African-American
Studies at Brown University, dis
cussed Caribbean intellectual his
tory and the contributions of
Wynter's "cultural systemic anal
ysis of patterns of domination"
within the region.
Prof. Sandra Richards of
Northwestern University talked
about the ways in which "the
compelling form" of Wynter's cre
ative works makes the complexity

of Caribbean issues "more acces
sible to a wider audience."
Other speakers discussed
French aspects of Caribbean cul
ture and the relationship between
sugar and language in Caribbean
poetry.
Among other highlights of the
symposium were a speech by
George Lamming, the Barbados'
most celebrated novelist, and a
roundtable of students whose
lives have been deeply influenced
by Wynter's teaching.
Patricia Fox, a doctoral candi
date in Spanish and Portuguese
and Comparative Literature, said
that Wynter has inspired her to
"look at things globally and tran
shistorically" in a way that has
added a meaningful dimension to
her studies.
