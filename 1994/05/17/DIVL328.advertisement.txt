Peter Robinson
Snapshots from
The Making of an MBA
Published by Warner Books
In keeping with the highly entertaining tradition of such books
as Scott Turow's OneL, Robinson began keeping a journal of his
S -to-day impressions of life at America's
premier business school — Stanford
University — that became this book,
an act of writing he came to see as "a
simple act of decency, like going back
to the last calm bend in the river and
nailing up a sign that reads 'Waterfall
Snapshots from Hell is Peter
Robinson's hilarious, enlightening,
soul-searching attempt to provide an
mswer to the paramount question every
prospective student asks and no catalog
answers: What is business school really like?
Peter Robinson is now a Research Fellow at the Hoover Institution.
