Rosy path for Breyer
WASHINGTON (AP) — With a spirited
Rose Garden sendofT from President Clin
ton, Stephen Breyer began an expected easy
trek yesterday to confirmation to the
Supreme Court. The Boston jurist
promised to pursue a pragmatic course if
confirmed and "make law work for people."
Pledging to cut through legal jargon
and write clearly, Breyer also promised:
"No footnotes — or as few as possible."
Senate confirmation of Breyer, 55, was
not in doubt. The political centrist has
been widely praised across the spectrum.
Even detractor Sen. Howard Metzen
baum, D-Ohio, predicted overwhelming
approval.
Metzenbaum contends Breyer has
betrayed consumer interests in siding
with big business in a series of antitrust
rulings.

Breyer, who as a Senate aide wrote leg
islation to deregulate the nation's airlines,
sought to avoid labels in his White House
speech, saying he was proud of just one,
"that of judge."
Haitian leader usurps power
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP)
Haiti's army-backed leader usurped the
prime minister's post and assumed near
dictatorial powers yesterday, hours after
the country's caretaker premier ordered his
Cabinet to defy the "puppet" government.
Emile Jonassaint, an 81-year-old judge
installed by a small group of lawmakers as
provisional president last Wednesday, also
appointed a clique of extreme rightists
and nationalists to his Cabinet.
The White House said it would have no
dealings with the new Cabinet, which it
called a "bogus government."
