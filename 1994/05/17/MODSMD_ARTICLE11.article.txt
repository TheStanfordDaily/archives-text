SMITHFIELD, N.C. (AP) â€” An
Amtrak train jumped the track yesterday
alter it hit a load that had shifted and was
sticking out from a passing freight train,
officials said. The engineer was killed and
at least seven people were seriously
injured.
The Silver Meteor was bound from New
York to Florida with 415 passengers and 23
crew members aboard. The lead engine of
the Amtrak train slid into a ravine. A small
fire in it was quickly extinguished. In all, 12
of the train's 13 cars demiled.
"I saw people coming through the
woods and that's when we saw the train
derailed," said Deputy Lt. R.C. Medlin.
"We started checking cars. That's when we
found people with broken legs and lacera
tions. People were sitting on top of one car
and we had to get an extension ladder to
get them off."

The train's engineer, Brooks Wood
ward, 41, of Laurinburg, was killed,
Amtrak said.
Many of the injured were in the first
passenger car, which flipped onto its side.
Most of the passengers likely were asleep
when the wreck happened.
"From the look of some of the seats in
there, the positions they were in, it was a
hell of a rude awakening," Medlin said.
"I was thrown out of my bunk and I
landed on both of my children," a passen
ger, Sue McGrath, told television station
WIVD.
Said another passenger, Dick Hutchin
son: "There was a bump and then three
short bumps. Everybody stayed relatively
calm. It was terrifying."
Amtrak President Thomas M. Downs
said in WashingUm that the train, going
about 70 mph, was struck by a big rig truck

trailer that was being carried alx>ard a
northbound CSX flatcar. The truck had
shifted and was sticking out from the side
of the freight train, he said.
Tina Seldin, Johnston Memorial Hospi
tal spokeswoman, said 75 people were
taken there with injuries such as broken
bones and back or neck pain. Seven of
them, the most seriously hurt, were airlift
ed to Duke University Medical Center in
Durham, where their conditions were not
immediately available. Most others were
treated and released.
In addition, about 285 people were
treated for minor injuries at the local
National Guard armory, where passengers
were taken, Seldin said.
The freight train was owned by CSX, a
CSX dispatcher said. The collision
occurred about 40 miles north of Fayet
teville about 4:45 a.m.
