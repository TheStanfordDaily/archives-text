THE PROPOSED revisions
to Stanford's grading policy
have been under fire by con
cerned students in dorm rooms,
classes, polls and discussion
forums since their unveiling. Yet
the Faculty Senate will not discuss
these suggestions until the day it
votes on the proposal, May 26.
This date is the final meeting of
the academic year and leaves little
time to take into account the con
cerns that students have raised.
The members of the senate, on
whose shoulders the ultimate revi
sions rest, should bring these pos
sible — and likely — changes to
the table at this Thursday's meet
ing, thus allowing for greater dis
cussion and reflection before actu
al voting takes place.

If they devote more time and
space for this issue, the senate can
create a more cohesive and
detailed plan — as well as one
which incorporates more student
input and concerns about imple
mentation from other faculty.
Of students polled by The Daily,
63 percent disagree with the sen
ate's suggestion to shorten the
deadline for dropping courses, and
64 percent do not approve of the
proposed "W" notation for
dropped classes.
Such opposition at least
deserves the senate's serious con
sideration. Likewise, the sweeping
changes of the proposed policy
deserve more than a single meet
ing for the senate to both debate
and decide its fate.
