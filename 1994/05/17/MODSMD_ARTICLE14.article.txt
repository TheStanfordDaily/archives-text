## UGLY ELECTION 
### 
ONE IS environmental.
One is supernatural. One
is coniferous. One is
blond. All are idealistic and none
seems prepared for the glorious
responsibility of becoming Stan
ford's "UGLY Man On Campus."
Civil Engineering Prof. Gil
Masters, Casper the Friendly
Ghost, the Stanford Tree and
Daily columnist Tish Williams
have each been nominated by the
coed Alpha Phi Omega service
fraternity for the dubious honor
of being voted "ugliest," in what
ever sense of the word that vot
ers feel is most appropriate.
The, contest is a fund raising
effort for the Emergency-Hous
ing Coalition — a group that
runs several transitional housing
programs for the homeless and
runaways — according to Alpha
Phi Omega's vice president for
service Mark Billian.
Among the coalition's pro
grams is a family living center in
San Jose where displaced fami
lies can stay while they receive
services to help them get back
on their feet. As well, the coali
tion runs a local winter shelter

program for
up to 100
people.
Students
can vote in
White Plaza
until Thurs
day by mak-

ing a donation of pocket change
in the name of their favored can
didate. Each day the donations
for the candidates will be tallied
and announced to the public. On
Friday, members of the service
fraternity will crown the winner,
who will benefit in title only.
But, oh, what a title.
.Unfortunately, all four candi
dates' heayV; campaigning sched
ules have prevented The Daily
from interviewing them about
their proposals for improve
ments in student services and
the University administration.
The editorial board therefore
refrains from endorsing any can
didate.
But with so much at stake,
students have a deep and binding
democratic responsibility to elect
someone who is really, really
ugly.
