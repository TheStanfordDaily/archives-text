## Futility: the tie that binds 
### 
SO WHAT IF I'm a Cubs fan? Should
it. really be a problem that I choose
to root for a team that has had three
winning seasons in the nuclear era?
Should I be subjected to derision and
mockery on behalf of a team that last won
a World Series 86 years ago?
I think not. The matter at hand is a
serious one. It's not a question of cheering
for a decidedly mediocre team while enjoy
ing the melodious voice of Harry Caray
and basking in the old-maid glory of
Wrigley Field. Rather, it is one that applies
to the very essence of humanity — and no,
this does not refer to the giving mood that
the Cubs always seem to be in.
Futile quests are no stranger to the
human predicament. History abounds
with examples: King Arthur's search for
the Holy Grail, Russia's desire for a warm
water port and committees on Asian-
American Studies. Certainly, the Cubs are
not the only sports team to be glorified for
their futility. The Hartford Whalers, the
Sacramento Kings and the Northwestern
Wildcats all conjure images of opponents
constantly engaging in pre-game victory
celebrations.
But there is a special sense of futility
associated with the Cubs. It doesn't mat
ter if they're in first place in August. They
will blow it. Heck, this team is the only one
in National League history to win the first
two games of t he National League champi
onship series and lose the series by drop
ping the next three. And, of course, the
memory of the 1969 Cubs elicits no more

tears since they've all dried up. Despite
this, no one ever gets too bitter or cynical
except for those pseudo-fans who switch
teams at the same rate as spouses. This is
not like other teams that — curse them —
win crucial games and then lose some
games the next season. Presto, the fans
head for the hills.
We cheer for the Cubs because we know
that they can't win. It is fated in the stars.
Every Cub is carrying around five equip
ment bags of bad karma. (And, unfortu
nately for other teams that trade for these
players, this karmic baggage is never lost
thanks to the ex-Cub factor.) Some canned
expression of snowballs in hell comes to
mind. Cheering for the Cubs is clamoring
for Joe Nobody against Mike Tyson. It's
like taking thousand to one odds and lov
ing it. If David were still around, the Cubs
could use his arm.
The reason for this blind faith has noth
ing to do with masochism. Nor does it have
relevance to the city. (This is in reference
to the theory advanced by eminent sociol
ogists that the quality of the city is
inversely proportional to the adoration of
the city's sports teams.) The underdog
represents the dreams of people. The
world is a terrible place; people with big
cars and money always call the shots.
That's the way of the universe. In that
sense, the Cubs represent an intergalactic
warp zone — the minute chance that
things will not always be the way they are.
The chance that you will not grow old, that

taxes and tuition will go down, that date
prospects will say "yes," that Michael will
come back. Thirty thousand men, women
and children do not visit Wrigley Field on
a Tuesday afternoon in July for the beau
ty of the ivy. They come because the Cubs
represent everything that is wrong with
the world and the infinitesimal chance
that their kids will do well in school, that
they'll be able to play catch with their
fathers. "Field of Dreams" stuff.
But when you put on that beloved and
bedraggled blue cap with the red "C" on
the front, you are carrying the cross for
whatever has happened to you and for
whatever you dream of. The caps are
passed on from one pennant-less genera
tion to the next. There is a type of poetic
beauty in this ritual.
And what would happen if they were to
win? Harry would have a massive coro
nary and all the Sox fans would suffer
identity crises with varying degrees of psy
chosis. Who would become the underdog
then? Who would carry the banner of futil
ity with flying colors? The more they lose,
the greater the adoration.
Death, taxes, and fourth-place finishes.
Wait 'til next year.

At man still believes in masochism, even if
it's not the force behind blind faith.
