## Asian-American Studies would not engender isolation 
### 
WE WHITE in response to Univer
sity President Gerhard Casper's
concern, quoted in The Daily
and expressed again during an exchange
with students after his State of the Uni
versity speech on May 12, that Asian-
American Studies might contribute to a
culture of education according to "niches."
In contrast to a situation wherein cultures
of different peoples are studied in isola
tion, President Casper indicated that he
would prefer a more integrated study of
the subject of Asian-American history and
culture, a program in which this ethnic
group would be studied in its relation to
other groups and to society as a whole.
The question behind his comments is,
how can we guard against ever greater
fragmentation and isolation?
We agree with President Casper.
In the formation of Asian-American
Studies we have held to two fundamental
beliefs. First, that Asian-American Studies
necessarily involves the study of both its
constituent terms — the histories of Asian
countries and that of the United States —
and, in particular, of the complex global
histories that have variously linked Asia

and America. The president may not know
that every major Asian-American Studies
program in the United States requires of
its undergraduates coursework in Asian
history, as well as in American history and
political institutions (the latter includes
the comparative study of the history and
politics of different ethnic groups). This in
turn has helped students and teachers
address the general issues of race and eth
nicity in both a national and international
context. In short, Asian-American Studies
as it is constituted in the U.S. academy is
concerned with precisely the questions
Casper raises.
Second, we believe that the project of
"multiculturalism," as we understand it,
is informed precisely by a rejection of a
"niche" mentality — that of eurocentrism
within the concept of America. That is,
the isolation of one culture from the con
sideration of how it is actually itself a
composite of heterogeneous cultures (e.g.
Anglo and Saxon and Latino, Asian,
African, Native American and others).
Instead of unreflectively singling out one
particular vision of culture, we would
open the discussion of "what is American

culture?" to both historically unrepresent
ed elements and new elements that are
emerging in the increasingly transnational
world of the late twentieth century, a time
when the United States witnesses an
accelerated reinvention of its own identity.
Rather than an impoverishment, in this
reconsideration of American culture we
see the potential for an enrichment of our
intellectual comprehension of the past,
present and future.
The establishment of an Asian-Ameri
can studies program will not be a substi
tute for the integration of ethnic studies
into the wider curriculum; rather, it will
be an instrument for the in-depth study of
one group (within the context of the larg
er whole) and a complement to that study
within already established departments
and programs, in much the same way
that, for instance, German Studies has
not confined the study of Germanic peo
ples to its own department, but serves
both as a place for the concentrated study
of that subject and as a resource for other
departments and programs.
But, yes, the establishment of individu
al, specialized programs can indeed lead to

greater confusion, fragmentation and
antagonism, if the enterprise is not under
girded by a sense of seriousness and open
ness, and a commitment to the goal of the
"common good." Our belief is that the
"common good," to truly be common,
must include, after *20 years of considera
tion but little action by this University —
those who have had no other choice but to
accommodate the absence of what the
University Committee on Multicultural
Issues report determined long ago should
be an integral part of Stanford's educa
tional program. Stanford is now, more
than ever, conspicuous in its lack of an
Asian-American Studies program. The
question is whether this isolation is a posi
tive or negative mark of distinction.
