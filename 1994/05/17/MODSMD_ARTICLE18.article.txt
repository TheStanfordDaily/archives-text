# Philosophy of Res Ed undermined by recent amendments to Draw
## 
### 
This letter is in response to the
undergraduate housing Draw that hap
pened this week. It has become the
Housing Center's policy this year to pro
hibit juniors who are drawing unguar
anteed to have frosh or sophomores in
their draw groups since they have guar
anteed, unpreferred housing. This poli
cy, though, seems to counter the purpos
es of Residential Education. How can
Res Ed's fabled "dorm experience" hap
pen when friends are not allowed to
draw together? When we questioned the

housing office personnel about this poli
cy, their only response seemed to be
that, "Despite considering many alter
natives, this is the only one that will
work."
Amazingly, it seems that guaranteed
housing has become more of a curse for
some students than the blessing which
the University intended it to be.
We can only hope, now that the
Draw is over, that the Housing Center
will reconsider its stance on this issue
and do something about it before the
results are announced. Perhaps some
kind of system could be devised that
would allow friends who had to draw
separately to reunite and share the
same draw number provided those
guaranteed relinquish their guaranteed
status.
