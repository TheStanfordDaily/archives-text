# Burciaga mistakenly classifies University publications as fliers
## 
### 
Stanford publications are not "fliers.'
The recent conflict between the Stan
ford Review and Casa Zapata Resident
Fellow Jose Antonio Burciaga is outra
geous and childish. Both sides are guilty
of supplanting legitimate discussion of
campus issues in favor of petty antics.

More importantly, however, the poli
cies of free distribution of campus publi
cations have once again been put in
jeopardy. Campus publications are not
fliers. The right to distribute on campus
is secured in the ASSU by-laws and the
policies of the Publication Board.
This means that even 'flier-free
dorms' should not suppress distribution
of some campus publications in favor of
others. Those same policies protect all
University publications. If Burciaga had
problems with the Review's distribution
policies then that complaint should
have been dealt with at the Publica
tions Board, not in a Casa Zapata hall
way.
