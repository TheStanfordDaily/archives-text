ATHENS, Ga. â€” Laxmi Poruri was
taken to St. Mary's Hospital yesterday
with heat exhaustion and dehydration.
But Stanford's senior captain forgot
something back at the Magill Tennis
Complex.
"She left her guts on the court," said
teammate and fellow senior Kristine
Kurth.
Poruri's guts were exposed in a

tremendous three-set victory over
Texas' Lucy Ludvigova which catapult
ed the Stanford Cardinal (23-2) over the
top-seed and nemesis Lady Longhorn's
(25-1) and into today's championship
match of the NCAA Women's Tennis
Championships.
The Cardinal won 5-2, victorious in
four of the six singles matches and
clinching at No. 2 doubles to exact retri
bution from a squad that has been re
sponsible for Stanford's last two exits
from this tournament. Two years ago

the Longhorns knocked out Stanford in
the finals, then last year repeated the
favor in the semifinals of the NCAA
Championships.
"Ifyou notice, the two seniors I Poruri
and Kurthl were the only ones with their
red shirts on. Everyone else was in
white," said Stanford head coach Frank
Brennan. "That was for all the blood
they bad shed fighting Texas the last
two years."
