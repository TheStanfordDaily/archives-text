# Women's tennis bests No. 1 in semis

### Rob Ross Senior staff writer 
ATHENS, Ga. — Laxmi Poruri was
taken to St. Mary's Hospital yesterday
with heat exhaustion and dehydration.
But Stanford's senior captain forgot
something back at the Magill Tennis
Complex.
"She left her guts on the court," said
teammate and fellow senior Kristine
Kurth.
Poruri's guts were exposed in a

tremendous three-set victory over
Texas' Lucy Ludvigova which catapult
ed the Stanford Cardinal (23-2) over the
top-seed and nemesis Lady Longhorn's
(25-1) and into today's championship
match of the NCAA Women's Tennis
Championships.
The Cardinal won 5-2, victorious in
four of the six singles matches and
clinching at No. 2 doubles to exact retri
bution from a squad that has been re
sponsible for Stanford's last two exits
from this tournament. Two years ago

the Longhorns knocked out Stanford in
the finals, then last year repeated the
favor in the semifinals of the NCAA
Championships.
"Ifyou notice, the two seniors I Poruri
and Kurthl were the only ones with their
red shirts on. Everyone else was in
white," said Stanford head coach Frank
Brennan. "That was for all the blood
they bad shed fighting Texas the last
two years."
Sophomore Kim Shasby agreed. "We
didn't want to go down to Texas again in
the NCAAs," she said. "I wouldn't say it
was so much revenge. . .Yes, it was
revenge. We wanted to get them back and
didn't care what we had to do to do it."
What they had to do was win a majority
of the singles matches. The Longhorns have
traditionally strong doubles teams (two are
ranked in the nation's top-twenty), so a 4-2
advantage going into the doubles stanza
was essential for a Cardinal victory.
This lead was never secure until Poruri
proved that she is the toughest collegiate
women's tennis player in the country, at
least at heart. The senior, currently
ranked second in the Rolex National Rank
ings, faced off against the nation's top
player, Ludvigova. In the first set, these
rankings seemed to be reversed as Poruri
won 6-3 behind an aggressive serve-and
volley game.
But Ludvigova found her stroke in the
second set and passed Poruri on both sides
and over the top with biting top-spin lobs.
Knotted at 6-6, the players went into an
emotional tie-breaker in which Poruri took
a quick 4-0 lead, then was caught at 6-6 by
a streaking Ludvigova. The junior transfer
from the Czech Republic fought off two
match points and slammed a forehand
down the line to pull out an amazing 7-6
(9-7) second-set win.
For most of the third set, Poruri barely
held on as Ludvigova threatened to run
away with the victory. LJp 2-0 and 40-15,
Ludvigova's double faulting gave Poruri

the opening she needed. She tied the
Longhorn 2-2, then slipped back again 4-5.
Ludvigova had the chance to serve out the
match, hut double faulted five times in her
next two service games. Obviously feeling
the ill-effects of the 87 degree heat, a hob
bling Poruri continued to rush the net and
nail her first serve to record her toughest
victory of the season.
"I very rarely pray during a match
because I don't think tennis is that impor
tant. For that one I did," Brennan said. "I
thought it was essential for her psycholog
ical well-being to win that match.
"When you're in the athletics business
you can't believe some of the performances
you see out there. She was simply unbe
lievable."
After the match Poruri sat in the shade
for a few minutes. "Then my whole body
started to cramp up," she said. "They took
me to an ambulance and they put two liters
I of fluid from an IV | in me." Poruri is
expected to play tomorrow.
Poruri's teammates were having mixed
success with the rest of the Longhorn sta
ble. Freshman Katie Schlukebir left the
courts first with a 6-3, 6-3 victory over
senior Jackie Moe. Two losing teammates
were quick to follow, as Sandra De Silva
dropped 10 games in a row in her 7-5, 6-0
loss to Jill Craybass at No. 4 singles and
Kurth fell to Kelly Pace 6-2, 6-3 at No. 2.
At No. 5 singles, Shasby ran into a play
er almost as hot as the climate in freshman
Farley Taylor. Taylor ran off four straight
games before Shasby had time to wipe the
sweat from her face.
"I thought I had run into a steamroller

out there," the sophomore said. "With
players who are that hot when they come
out you just have to weather them out and
hope they cool off."
Cool off she did, as Shasby won 16 of the
next 21 games to recover with a 4-6, 6-1, 6-
2 victory.
Poruii limped off next, and all eyes
focused on the No. 6 match, where sopho
more Wendy Sacks had split sets with
Texas' Jennifer Nasser.
"The cheers I from Poruri's win I gave me
a second wind at a crucial game, Sacks
said. "I got cooler with the pressure.
Sacks finished off Nasser 6-4, 3-6, 6-2,
and the Cardinal just needed one win in
doubles to clinch. With Poruri's absence,
Sacks filled in at No. 1 doubles with
Schlukebir against Texas' top squad of
Moe-Pace, who are ranked sixth nationally.
This match-up was rendered moot as
Stanford's No. 2 duo of Kurth-Beth Berris
drove a 6-1, 6-2 stake through the heart of
the higher-ranked Longhorn squad of Lud
vigova-Taylor, thereby snapping Texas' 34-
match winning streak and sending the Car
dinal to today's 1 p.m. (EST) championship
match against Georgia. The second-seeded
Lady Bulldogs (26-2) scraped by No. 4 Cal
ifornia 5-3.
Texas coach Jeff Moore thinks the Car
dinal will take home its ninth champi
onship in the 13-year history of the tour
nament.
"They were unquestionably the tough
est team we've played this year," Moore
said. "I definitely pick Stanford to win |the
finals|. It won't be a contest unless the
crowd gets into it."

me to an ambulance and they put two liters
I of fluid from an IV | in me." Poruri is
expected to play tomorrow.
Poruri's teammates were having mixed
success with the rest of the Longhorn sta
ble. Freshman Katie Schlukebir left the
courts first with a 6-3, 6-3 victory over
senior Jackie Moe. Two losing teammates
were quick to follow, as Sandra De Silva
dropped 10 games in a row in her 7-5, 6-0
loss to Jill Craybass at No. 4 singles and
Kurth fell to Kelly Pace 6-2, 6-3 at No. 2.
At No. 5 singles, Shasby ran into a play
er almost as hot as the climate in freshman
Farley Taylor. Taylor ran off four straight
games before Shasby had time to wipe the
sweat from her face.
"I thought I had run into a steamroller

out there," the sophomore said. "With
players who are that hot when they come
out you just have to weather them out and
hope they cool off."
Cool off she did, as Shasby won 16 of the
next 21 games to recover with a 4-6, 6-1, 6-
2 victory.
Poruii limped off next, and all eyes
focused on the No. 6 match, where sopho
more Wendy Sacks had split sets with
Texas' Jennifer Nasser.
"The cheers I from Poruri's win I gave me
a second wind at a crucial game, Sacks
said. "I got cooler with the pressure.
Sacks finished off Nasser 6-4, 3-6, 6-2,
and the Cardinal just needed one win in
doubles to clinch. With Poruri's absence,
Sacks filled in at No. 1 doubles with
Schlukebir against Texas' top squad of
Moe-Pace, who are ranked sixth nationally.
This match-up was rendered moot as
Stanford's No. 2 duo of Kurth-Beth Berris
drove a 6-1, 6-2 stake through the heart of
the higher-ranked Longhorn squad of Lud
vigova-Taylor, thereby snapping Texas' 34-
match winning streak and sending the Car
dinal to today's 1 p.m. (EST) championship
match against Georgia. The second-seeded
Lady Bulldogs (26-2) scraped by No. 4 Cal
ifornia 5-3.
Texas coach Jeff Moore thinks the Car
dinal will take home its ninth champi
onship in the 13-year history of the tour
nament.
"They were unquestionably the tough
est team we've played this year," Moore
said. "I definitely pick Stanford to win |the
finals|. It won't be a contest unless the
crowd gets into it."

Ludvigova, the No. 1 player in the nation. Right: Soon after her victo
ry, a dehydrated Poruri grimaces in pain before being hospitalized.
ATHENS, Ga. — Laxmi Poruri was
taken to St. Mary's Hospital yesterday
with heat exhaustion and dehydration.
But Stanford's senior captain forgot
something back at the Magill Tennis
Complex.
"She left her guts on the court," said
teammate and fellow senior Kristine
Kurth.
Poruri's guts were exposed in a

tremendous three-set victory over
Texas' Lucy Ludvigova which catapult
ed the Stanford Cardinal (23-2) over the
top-seed and nemesis Lady Longhorn's
(25-1) and into today's championship
match of the NCAA Women's Tennis
Championships.
The Cardinal won 5-2, victorious in
four of the six singles matches and
clinching at No. 2 doubles to exact retri
bution from a squad that has been re
sponsible for Stanford's last two exits
from this tournament. Two years ago

the Longhorns knocked out Stanford in
the finals, then last year repeated the
favor in the semifinals of the NCAA
Championships.
"Ifyou notice, the two seniors I Poruri
and Kurthl were the only ones with their
red shirts on. Everyone else was in
white," said Stanford head coach Frank
Brennan. "That was for all the blood
they bad shed fighting Texas the last
two years."
Sophomore Kim Shasby agreed. "We
didn't want to go down to Texas again in
the NCAAs," she said. "I wouldn't say it
was so much revenge. . .Yes, it was
revenge. We wanted to get them back and
didn't care what we had to do to do it."
What they had to do was win a majority
of the singles matches. The Longhorns have
traditionally strong doubles teams (two are
ranked in the nation's top-twenty), so a 4-2
advantage going into the doubles stanza
was essential for a Cardinal victory.
This lead was never secure until Poruri
proved that she is the toughest collegiate
women's tennis player in the country, at
least at heart. The senior, currently
ranked second in the Rolex National Rank
ings, faced off against the nation's top
player, Ludvigova. In the first set, these
rankings seemed to be reversed as Poruri
won 6-3 behind an aggressive serve-and
volley game.
But Ludvigova found her stroke in the
second set and passed Poruri on both sides
and over the top with biting top-spin lobs.
Knotted at 6-6, the players went into an
emotional tie-breaker in which Poruri took
a quick 4-0 lead, then was caught at 6-6 by
a streaking Ludvigova. The junior transfer
from the Czech Republic fought off two
match points and slammed a forehand
down the line to pull out an amazing 7-6
(9-7) second-set win.
For most of the third set, Poruri barely
held on as Ludvigova threatened to run
away with the victory. LJp 2-0 and 40-15,
Ludvigova's double faulting gave Poruri

the opening she needed. She tied the
Longhorn 2-2, then slipped back again 4-5.
Ludvigova had the chance to serve out the
match, hut double faulted five times in her
next two service games. Obviously feeling
the ill-effects of the 87 degree heat, a hob
bling Poruri continued to rush the net and
nail her first serve to record her toughest
victory of the season.
"I very rarely pray during a match
because I don't think tennis is that impor
tant. For that one I did," Brennan said. "I
thought it was essential for her psycholog
ical well-being to win that match.
"When you're in the athletics business
you can't believe some of the performances
you see out there. She was simply unbe
lievable."
After the match Poruri sat in the shade
for a few minutes. "Then my whole body
started to cramp up," she said. "They took
me to an ambulance and they put two liters
I of fluid from an IV | in me." Poruri is
expected to play tomorrow.
