# N'Gai Croal: fly in the buttermilk
## Human remains and the true nature of love 
### 
Once upon a midnight dreary, while I
pondered weak and wearyl Over many a
quaint and curious volume of forgotten
lore/ While I nodded, nearly napping, sud
denly there came a tapping/ As of someone
gently rapping, rapping at my chamber
door/ "Tis some visitor," I muttered, "tap
ping at my chamber door/ Only this and
nothing more."
—The Raven, Edgar Allan Poe
Have you ever seen a
corpse?" "Only my own," is John
ny's answer to a homeless girl's
innocent question in Mike Leigh's punk
abrasive film "Naked." That exchange is
only one of rotten Johnny's many one
sided virtuoso duets, yet it managed to
bury itself in the recesses of my mind
and remain there since I saw the film
last fall.
It came roaring back to life last week
end when I saw "The Crow" The
revenge-fantasy film — based on James
O'Barr's acclaimed graphic novel —
claimed actor Brandon Lee's life last year
Three days before the film was scheduled
to wrap, Lee found himself on the wrong

end of a .44-magnum pistol, a dummy
bullet accidentally left in its chamber.
Directors are notorious for refusing to let
actors watch their rushes, so it's highly
likely that Brandon Lee never got to see
his own corpse. What was supposed to be
his escape from the nest of adolescent
martial arts roles to the elite aerie of
action epics became his swan song
instead.
The film opens with a shot of a broken
bay window from which a man has just
taken a swan dive. On the sidewalk
below, sirens wail, police officers mill
about and paramedics cover the corpse
with a haste that suggests the actor laid
out on the gurney is not the person we've
come to see.
A title card — "One year later" — flits
across the screen and a little girl's narra
tion slips into our ears before we get our
first glimpse of the late Lee. When we do,
it's a sight to behold — he bursts out of a
coffin six feet under a graveyard's dank
soil, howling like a banshee and thrashing
about in agony. Fifteen minutes later,
he's got white make-up and black eye
liner on his face, a demonic raven at his

back and a city full of bad guys waiting to
be stopped — violently.
"Don't you ever die?"
■—Michael Wincott to Brandon Lee in
"The Crow"
For a while, director Alex Proyas
blinds us to the film's flaws with its
stylish visuals: rain-slicked streets, high
contrast film noir lighting and a "Blade
Runner"-like cityscape straight out of
Dante's inferno. Lee's performance
charismatically blends poses, powerfully
graceful moves and a pinch of genuine
acting ability. But none of this can con
ceal the paper-thin script for very long.
Every bullet that Lee absorbs, screams in
agony over, then shrugs off, reminds us of
how futile this enterprise was — that the
price of his stardom, the studio's profit
and our moviegoing pleasure was his life.
There are a lot of people who have an
interest in obscuring or excusing this
blood-soaked transaction. The producers
insist that Lee's fiancee Eliza Hutton, the
cast and crew appealed to him to finish
the film. The director dedicated the film

to "Brandon and Eliza," insisting that the
film is a testament to the enduring power
of love. Proyas concludes the film with
the little girl's words of wisdom, "People
die. Buildings burn. But true love lasts
forever."
Brandon's mother and fiancee may
find cold comfort in those very words, but
we have no way of knowing, because
they're letting Proyas and company speak
for them. They've taken their revenge in
the form of an out-of-court settlement —
no Draven-like retribution here.
The critics, for their part, dutifully
note his "untimely" death, but swear that
this middling S/M action flick is a fitting
tribute to Lee. Perhaps the worst exam
ple of this is The Washington Post's Des
son Howe, who writes "If he had to die so
soon, this movie is the best and most
appropriate sendofT Lee could have hoped
for."
What's love got to do with it? Not a
whole hell of a lot.
There is no medium with the resur
rective power of film; Steven Spielberg
brought back the dinosaurs of the Juras
sic Era and the Jews of 1940s Poland in

the game calendar year. But whether it's
the mass-merchandised theme park
thrills of "Jurassic Park," the historical
ly specious histrionics of "Schindler's
List" or the comic book callousness of
"The Crow," all leave a bad taste in the
mouth.
Their lack of humility in the face of
death hides behind the excuse "It's only
a movie," even as they ask us to believe.
The poster for "The Crow" implores all
to "Believe in angels." It isn't much of a
stretch to conclude that they're asking
the wrong people — the person who
needs to believe that platitude lies next
to his father in a Seattle cemetery.
And the Raven, never flitting, still is
sitting, still is sitting/ On the pallid bust
of Pallas just above my chamber door/
And his eyes have all the seeming of a
demon that is dreaming! And the lamp
light o 'er him streaming throws his shad
ow on the floor/ And my soul from out
that shadow that lies floating on the floor!
Shall be lifted — nevermore!

And the Raven, never flitting, still is
sitting, still is sitting/ On the pallid bust
of Pallas just above my chamber door/
And his eyes have all the seeming of a
demon that is dreaming! And the lamp
light o 'er him streaming throws his shad
ow on the floor/ And my soul from out
that shadow that lies floating on the floor!
Shall be lifted — nevermore!

Once upon a midnight dreary, while I
pondered weak and wearyl Over many a
quaint and curious volume of forgotten
lore/ While I nodded, nearly napping, sud
denly there came a tapping/ As of someone
gently rapping, rapping at my chamber
door/ "Tis some visitor," I muttered, "tap
ping at my chamber door/ Only this and
nothing more."
—The Raven, Edgar Allan Poe
Have you ever seen a
corpse?" "Only my own," is John
ny's answer to a homeless girl's
innocent question in Mike Leigh's punk
abrasive film "Naked." That exchange is
only one of rotten Johnny's many one
sided virtuoso duets, yet it managed to
bury itself in the recesses of my mind
and remain there since I saw the film
last fall.
It came roaring back to life last week
end when I saw "The Crow" The
revenge-fantasy film — based on James
O'Barr's acclaimed graphic novel —
claimed actor Brandon Lee's life last year
Three days before the film was scheduled
to wrap, Lee found himself on the wrong

end of a .44-magnum pistol, a dummy
bullet accidentally left in its chamber.
Directors are notorious for refusing to let
actors watch their rushes, so it's highly
likely that Brandon Lee never got to see
his own corpse. What was supposed to be
his escape from the nest of adolescent
martial arts roles to the elite aerie of
action epics became his swan song
instead.
The film opens with a shot of a broken
bay window from which a man has just
taken a swan dive. On the sidewalk
below, sirens wail, police officers mill
about and paramedics cover the corpse
with a haste that suggests the actor laid
out on the gurney is not the person we've
come to see.
A title card — "One year later" — flits
across the screen and a little girl's narra
tion slips into our ears before we get our
first glimpse of the late Lee. When we do,
it's a sight to behold — he bursts out of a
coffin six feet under a graveyard's dank
soil, howling like a banshee and thrashing
about in agony. Fifteen minutes later,
he's got white make-up and black eye
liner on his face, a demonic raven at his

back and a city full of bad guys waiting to
be stopped — violently.
"Don't you ever die?"
■—Michael Wincott to Brandon Lee in
"The Crow"
For a while, director Alex Proyas
blinds us to the film's flaws with its
stylish visuals: rain-slicked streets, high
contrast film noir lighting and a "Blade
Runner"-like cityscape straight out of
Dante's inferno. Lee's performance
charismatically blends poses, powerfully
graceful moves and a pinch of genuine
acting ability. But none of this can con
ceal the paper-thin script for very long.
Every bullet that Lee absorbs, screams in
agony over, then shrugs off, reminds us of
how futile this enterprise was — that the
price of his stardom, the studio's profit
and our moviegoing pleasure was his life.
There are a lot of people who have an
interest in obscuring or excusing this
blood-soaked transaction. The producers
insist that Lee's fiancee Eliza Hutton, the
cast and crew appealed to him to finish
the film. The director dedicated the film

to "Brandon and Eliza," insisting that the
film is a testament to the enduring power
of love. Proyas concludes the film with
the little girl's words of wisdom, "People
die. Buildings burn. But true love lasts
forever."
Brandon's mother and fiancee may
find cold comfort in those very words, but
we have no way of knowing, because
they're letting Proyas and company speak
for them. They've taken their revenge in
the form of an out-of-court settlement —
no Draven-like retribution here.
The critics, for their part, dutifully
note his "untimely" death, but swear that
this middling S/M action flick is a fitting
tribute to Lee. Perhaps the worst exam
ple of this is The Washington Post's Des
son Howe, who writes "If he had to die so
soon, this movie is the best and most
appropriate sendofT Lee could have hoped
for."
