# Cardinal steers past Longhorns to finals
##

ATHENS, Ga. — Various team
t-shirts worn during the 1994
NCAA Women's Tennis Champi
onships contain inspirational
mottoes characterizing the spirit
of the teams. For example,
Kansas' shirts read "Any Way U-
Kan," and the shirts worn by
Stanford's semifinal opponent,
the Texas Lady Longhorns, read
"Steer Clear." The Cardinal's
shirts merely read "Stanford
Tennis".
Rut as Stanford's performance
yesterday illustrates, there is a
reason why no catchy phrase is
written on their shirts: their

mentally tough game is expressed
where it ought to be — on the
court.
Indeed, the Cardinal's victory
over the Longhorns was personi
fied by the determined attitudes
of their top two players: seniors
Laxmi Poruri and Kristine
Kurth.
According to head coach Frank
Brennan, it all started during the
team's pre-match conference.
"I gave a 50-minute disserta
tion this morning on how to get
ready and what we were going to
do today," Brennan said. "I
hadn't really thought about how
Texas had beaten us the last two
times |in the NCAA's]. The two
seniors brought that up. They

were quite intent on making that
right today."
And with a 5-2 match victory,
they succeeded in righting that
wrong. The first contributor in
their quest was one of their disci
ples, 35th-ranked Katie Schlukebir.
The freshman, who had not
experienced the two losses at the
hands of Texas, said Poruri and
Kurth's intensity made her
"want to win for them."
Playing alongside Poruri and
Kurth on the stadium courts,
Schlukebir was involved in the
first decision of what would prove
to be an afternoon of close match
es. Her H-3, 6-3 victory over No.
