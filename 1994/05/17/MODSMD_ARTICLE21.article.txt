# Cardinal steers past Longhorns to finals
## 
### Joe Bialowitz Staff writer 
ATHENS, Ga. — Various team
t-shirts worn during the 1994
NCAA Women's Tennis Champi
onships contain inspirational
mottoes characterizing the spirit
of the teams. For example,
Kansas' shirts read "Any Way U-
Kan," and the shirts worn by
Stanford's semifinal opponent,
the Texas Lady Longhorns, read
"Steer Clear." The Cardinal's
shirts merely read "Stanford
Tennis".
Rut as Stanford's performance
yesterday illustrates, there is a
reason why no catchy phrase is
written on their shirts: their

mentally tough game is expressed
where it ought to be — on the
court.
Indeed, the Cardinal's victory
over the Longhorns was personi
fied by the determined attitudes
of their top two players: seniors
Laxmi Poruri and Kristine
Kurth.
According to head coach Frank
Brennan, it all started during the
team's pre-match conference.
"I gave a 50-minute disserta
tion this morning on how to get
ready and what we were going to
do today," Brennan said. "I
hadn't really thought about how
Texas had beaten us the last two
times |in the NCAA's]. The two
seniors brought that up. They

were quite intent on making that
right today."
And with a 5-2 match victory,
they succeeded in righting that
wrong. The first contributor in
their quest was one of their disci
ples, 35th-ranked Katie Schlukebir.
The freshman, who had not
experienced the two losses at the
hands of Texas, said Poruri and
Kurth's intensity made her
"want to win for them."
Playing alongside Poruri and
Kurth on the stadium courts,
Schlukebir was involved in the
first decision of what would prove
to be an afternoon of close match
es. Her H-3, 6-3 victory over No.

49 Jackie Moe was followed by a
display of yelling and crowd-exhort
ing arm gestures that would have
made Hulk Hogan proud.
"It's good for a team to get the
momentum going by winning the
first match," Schlukebir said. "As
soon as I won 1 just wanted to get
the crowd and the players on courts
one and two going."
Although Kurth fell to fourth
ranked Kelly Pace 6-2, 6-3, No. 2
Poruri notched a grueling 6-3, 6-7
(7), 7-5 victory over the nation's
top-ranked player, Lucie Ludvigo
va. Down 0-2, 15-40 in the third set,
Poruri staged a dramatic comeback
marked by her ability to overcome
cramping and dehydration that
forced her to serve two points
underhand and landed her in the
hospital afler the match.
"We didn't realize how big
Laxmi's match was until we real
ized she couldn't play doubles," said
Brennan.
But when faced with the assign
ment of having to sweep the Cardi
nal in doubles, the Longhorns could
not "steer clear" of Kurth — a play
er now out for redemption of all
sorts. Besides her two team losses to
Texas and her singles loss earlier in
the day, Kurth and her partner Beth
Berris were looking to atone for two
dual match defeats that decided the
outcome of matches against both
Florida and UCLA earlier this year.
"We said to each other before the
match, 'We're not going to let the
team down again,'" Kurth said.
And they didn't, as they quickly
disposed of Ludvigova and Farley
Taylor, 6-1, 6-2.
"You have to go in thinking
you're the match that's going to
clinch," Berris said.
When Shasby and Burt split
their first two sets, Kurth and
Berris got their chance. Thanks to
an aggressive style of play by both
players and what Brennan called
Kurth's "best doubles match of her
career," the tandem brought an end
to Texas' 34-match winning streak
and propelled the Cardinal into its
tenth championship appearance in
13 years.
