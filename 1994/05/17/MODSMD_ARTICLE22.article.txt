Mind over matter.
Despite the 50 mile per hour
wind, 40 degree temperature, hail
and thunderstorms, athletes com
peted this weekend during the
Pacific 10 Conference Decathlon/
Heptathlon Championships at
Washington State University.
Stanford decathlete Travis
Clark reigned Pac-10 Decathlon
champion with an impressive
showing of physical as well as men
tal endurance during his second
decathlon ever.
Clark managed to earn 6,982
points in the two-day event, beat
ing John Fekete's 6,798 points
from rival California. Fekete's
teammate, Sean Haworth, finished
third with 6,572 points.
Clark placed first in the high
jump (7' 1"), in the 400- meter

(48.69 seconds), in the 1,500-
meter (4:55.78), and in the 110-
meter high hurdles (15.38 sec
onds).
In addition, he finished second
in the javelin, with a career best
164' 9" throw. He earned third
place in both the 100- meters
(11.18 seconds) and the pole vault
(12' 9"), while placing fourth in the
shot put (37' 1").
The only event that Clark did
not place in was the discus, in
which he recorded a distance of 97'
11".
The favorite to win the
decathlon, Ray Livingston from
the University of Oregon, finished
fifth at the end of the showdown.
Livingston's chances were hurt
when he failed to score during the
pole vault, which is normally his
strongest event.
"The pole vault was the event
in which most athletes were

going to gain ground on me," said
Clark. "However, it was. . .fortu
nate for me that the weather
knocked many competitors out of
the race."
Clark also struggled with the
elements, failing to clear the bar
until his third and final attempt.
Despite capturing the Pac-10 title,
Clark's point total fell shy of the
NCAA qualifying mark of 7,100.
"The decathlon is very tough,
and the weather made it twice as
draining for us," he said. "I kept in
mind going into the showdown to
win and qualify for the NCAAs,
however, my coaches warned me of
possible bad weather conditions
which might inhibit my goals. It
was a real disappointment."
Cardinal assistant coach Mark
Reiff had an optimistic view on
Clark's championship effort.
"Considering the weather, he
did an excellent job," said Reiff.

"Travis did the right things neces
sary to win, and in weather like
this you forget about scores and
just focus on battling for highest
marks in the events."
Clark was not the only Cardinal
athlete to place during this week
end's competition. Sophomore
Jackie Bridgeman finished ninth
in the heptathlon with 4,044
points.
"Jackie just had a bad day over
all and the weather wasn't much of
a help either," Reiff said. "She
didn't perform as well as predicted
in the high jump and that was
mainly what determined her week
end's score."
Although this season has ended,
both Bridgeman and Clark will
return next year.
"I see this |weekend] as the
beginning of many great things to
come," said Cardinal head coach
Vin Lananna.
