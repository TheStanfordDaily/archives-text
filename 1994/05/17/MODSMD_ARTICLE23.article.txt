# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
During athletic events, the elements
often play a part in determining the win
ners. While many athletes wilt and fail in
the face of extreme conditions, those who
succeed not only achieve victory, they also
realize that inside of them lies the tenaci
ty to overcome obstacles.

Two from Stanford have discovered
this ability this past weekend, as Travis
Clark and Kim Shasby shone despite the
weather.
For their achievements during the pre
vious seven days, Clark and Shasby have
garnered the honor of Athletes of the
Week.
Clark, a junior, braved 40 degree tem
peratures and 50 mile per hour winds to
capture the Pacific-10 Decathlon champi
onship at Washington State University.
Competing for only his second time in the
decathlon, Clark captured first place in
four events during the two-day event.
Clark, a native of Cape Girardeau, MO,
racked up a total of 6,982 points fighting
hail, thunderstorms and a strong field.
His performance impressed many and
despite falling short of qualifying for the
NCAA, the team looks forward to Clark's
return for his senior year.

Unlike windy and cold Washington,
heat prevailed in Athens, Georgia. Kim
Shasby overcame the sun and top ranked
Texas to lead Stanford into the finals of
women's tennis.
Ranked No. 24 in the nation, the
sophomore from North Liberty, IA, bat
tled back from a one set deficit to defeat

Farley Taylor 4-6, 6-1, 6-2.
The victory raised Shashy's sterling
record to 14-5, 3-0 in the NCAA's. A high
ly recruited player out of high school,
Shasby continues to excel after recovering
from a knee injury that forced her to red
shirt her true freshman year.
