# IM softball: a league of Rinc's own
## 
### 
If intramural sports at Stan
ford attract a motley group of
athletes, the softball program
rakes in the "motliest" of the
motley.
I play on a Division II soft
ball team from Rinconada, an
all-frosh residence. Division II
is an offshoot of last season's
Great Intramural Realign
ment, where three former divi
sions of skill level (A, Band C)
were consolidated into two
groups, I and 11.
In the three-division system,
really bad C-league teams were
safely locked away from "depu
rifying" the play of more pro
fessional A-league squads. Now
we're all thrown together into
a mixed bag of several confer
ences that pit the untalented
against the ultra-talented in a
merciless version of intramural
Survival of the Fittest.
"It's blasphemous, what
they did to the C-league," said
Kevin, Rinconada's ace pitcher.
Kevin and I are the two non
freshman members of Rinc's
team. Because we are old
timers, we hate change. We
know that things were better
before the change.
To say the least, Rinconada
fields an ideal C-level softball
team.
For starters, there's Hristo.
Hristo, a native of Bulgaria,
never held a bat before the
start of the softball season.
Learning the art of swinging
has been a slow and painful
process for Hristo. He often
strikes out. In slow-pitch soft
ball. Last week, though, he got
his first base hit, a clean single
to left field.
Hristo isn't alone in his
inexperience on the diamond.
Ajai is also playing his first
organized ball for Rinc. In his
very first at-bat, Ajai got
knocked out when, after
grounding the ball to short
stop, an errant throw nailed
him in the back. He finishes his
throws from the outfield with a
crazy-armed, Kermit the Frog
flair that I suspect will soon
become the rage among left
fielders across the country.
That's because he was hitting a
perfect 1.000 through his first

three games.
Perfect is probably stretch
ing it a bit — nothing's perfect
in intramural softball, especial
ly the hitting. The official ball
is a 16-inch softball, a soft and
often-lopsided ostrich egg that
can be hit with a regular soft
ball bat and caught with bare
hands.
But there are strikeouts (see
Hristo), foulouts, groundnuts
and a plethora of popouts.
There are more creative ways
to make outs as well.
Sasha, who is also unfamil
iar with the concept of hitting a
ball with a bat, got called out
for "chopping" after dribbling
a grounder to the left side of
the infield. Chopping, which
falls somewhere between slash
ing in ice hockey and intention
al grounding in football, occurs
when, instead of squaring to
bunt, a batter swings down on
the ball to achieve a bunting
effect. It's a difficult maneuver
that requires a good eye for the
ball, expert deception and skill
at hitting. Sasha possesses
none of those qualities — he's
just a bad hitter. Hut the
umpire knows best, be it soft
ball or baseball.
The game is sexist — oppos
ing teams automatically bring
the infield in when Celina, our
lone female representative,
comes to the plate. We're talk
ingway in. One third baseman
positioned himself no more
than 10 feet from the plate
whenever Celina came to the
plate. I'm sure Celina would
have loved nothing more than
dropping a few hot soft balls
down his jockstrap. Nonethe
less, she put up with his
smirks.
Not everyone on the Rinc


Off the
Bench

Brian
Egan
squad lacks experience or talent.
Chris, our third baseman, once
won a game for his high school
team by hitting a home run in
the last inning. We all know this
because Chris has a videotaped
copy of the game that he shows
regularly on the dorm TV. While
Chris's video hasn't quite
cracked the Blockbuster Top-10,
it's a great morale boost for the
team.
Rinc needed that morale
boost after we were routed in
each of our first three games.
But we've won our last two, and

playoff talk now gets tossed
around the Rinc bench between
innings.
We'll get crushed in the play
offs — the land of Biz School and
the Betas is no place for a dorm
team. But as Chris said in an
impromptu meeting in the mid
dle of our last game, "None of
this really matters. It's only soft
ball."
It's only softball — that's
hardly an attitude the Boys of
Summer would have prided.
Somehow, we're better off that
way.
Brian, who graduates all too
soon, leaves Rinconada with
tears in his eyes. Balls to the
wall, baby.

fessional A-league squads. Now
we're all thrown together into
a mixed bag of several confer
ences that pit the untalented
against the ultra-talented in a
merciless version of intramural
Survival of the Fittest.
"It's blasphemous, what
they did to the C-league," said
Kevin, Rinconada's ace pitcher.
Kevin and I are the two non
freshman members of Rinc's
team. Because we are old
timers, we hate change. We
know that things were better
before the change.
To say the least, Rinconada
fields an ideal C-level softball
team.
For starters, there's Hristo.
Hristo, a native of Bulgaria,
never held a bat before the
start of the softball season.
Learning the art of swinging
has been a slow and painful
process for Hristo. He often
strikes out. In slow-pitch soft
ball. Last week, though, he got
his first base hit, a clean single
to left field.
Hristo isn't alone in his
inexperience on the diamond.
Ajai is also playing his first
organized ball for Rinc. In his
very first at-bat, Ajai got
knocked out when, after
grounding the ball to short
stop, an errant throw nailed
him in the back. He finishes his
throws from the outfield with a
crazy-armed, Kermit the Frog
flair that I suspect will soon
become the rage among left
fielders across the country.
That's because he was hitting a
perfect 1.000 through his first

three games.
Perfect is probably stretch
ing it a bit — nothing's perfect
in intramural softball, especial
ly the hitting. The official ball
is a 16-inch softball, a soft and
often-lopsided ostrich egg that
can be hit with a regular soft
ball bat and caught with bare
hands.
But there are strikeouts (see
Hristo), foulouts, groundnuts
and a plethora of popouts.
There are more creative ways
to make outs as well.
Sasha, who is also unfamil
iar with the concept of hitting a
ball with a bat, got called out
for "chopping" after dribbling
a grounder to the left side of
the infield. Chopping, which
falls somewhere between slash
ing in ice hockey and intention
al grounding in football, occurs
when, instead of squaring to
bunt, a batter swings down on
the ball to achieve a bunting
effect. It's a difficult maneuver
that requires a good eye for the
ball, expert deception and skill
at hitting. Sasha possesses
none of those qualities — he's
just a bad hitter. Hut the
umpire knows best, be it soft
ball or baseball.
The game is sexist — oppos
ing teams automatically bring
the infield in when Celina, our
lone female representative,
comes to the plate. We're talk
ingway in. One third baseman
positioned himself no more
than 10 feet from the plate
whenever Celina came to the
plate. I'm sure Celina would
have loved nothing more than
dropping a few hot soft balls
down his jockstrap. Nonethe
less, she put up with his
smirks.
Not everyone on the Rinc


Off the
Bench

Brian
Egan
squad lacks experience or talent.
Chris, our third baseman, once
won a game for his high school
team by hitting a home run in
the last inning. We all know this
because Chris has a videotaped
copy of the game that he shows
regularly on the dorm TV. While
Chris's video hasn't quite
cracked the Blockbuster Top-10,
it's a great morale boost for the
team.
Rinc needed that morale
boost after we were routed in
each of our first three games.
But we've won our last two, and

playoff talk now gets tossed
around the Rinc bench between
innings.
We'll get crushed in the play
offs — the land of Biz School and
the Betas is no place for a dorm
team. But as Chris said in an
impromptu meeting in the mid
dle of our last game, "None of
this really matters. It's only soft
ball."
It's only softball — that's
hardly an attitude the Boys of
Summer would have prided.
Somehow, we're better off that
way.
Brian, who graduates all too
soon, leaves Rinconada with
tears in his eyes. Balls to the
wall, baby.
