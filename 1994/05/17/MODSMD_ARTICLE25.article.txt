The Cardinal baseball team captured the
Pacific 10 Conference Southern Division title
Sunday, but did not capture the hearts of the
NCAA World Series Regional Selection Com
mittee, which passed over Stanford in naming
eight sites for the 48-team tournament that
begins May 26.
While the Cardinal (36-22, 21-9 in the Six-
Pac) clinched an automatic postseason berth
by virtue of a dramatic 7-5, 10-inning win over
Arizona State in the final game of the regular
season, a mediocre nonconference record and
its incapability to host night games prohibited
Stanford's selection as a regional site.
The Cardinal learns its postseason fate
when the NCAA announces the complete field
next Monday at noon on ESPN. Stanford will

travel to one of these locations, with host
schools in parentheses: Austin, Texas (Texas);
Clemson, SC (Clemson); Tallahassee, Fla.
(Florida State); Stillwater, Okla. (Oklahoma
State); Miami, Fla. (Miami); Shreveport, La.
(Louisiana State); Wichita, Kansas (Wichita
State); or Knoxville, Tenn. (Tennessee).
No matter where Stanford plays in the dou
ble-elimination bracket, junior first baseman
Dusty Allen and sophomore third baseman
Brian Dallimore must sit the first game as
punishment for being ejected for fighting in a
bench-clearing brawl during the seventh
inning of Sunday's contest. Arizona State's
Jason Verdugo faces similar punishment, as
the Sun Devils await the site of their next
game as well.
