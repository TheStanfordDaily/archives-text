## 
### Jo Marshall Staff writer 
Seven Stanford students were
given a "vote of confidence" last
week when they were awarded
1994 Boothe Prizes for Excellence
in Writing.
The prizes honor outstanding
essays from Writing and Critical
Thinking and Cultures, Ideas and
Values. These courses are taken
primarily by freshmen.
"The Boothe prizes are unique
in that they reward superior
scholarship early in a student's
Stanford career and also illustrate
the value we place on writing
skills for all Stanford students,"
said John Shoven, dean of
Humanities and Sciences.
Every quarter, CIV and WCT
instructors nominate 30 to 40 stu
dents who demonstrate outstand

ing work in writing. The nomina
tions are submitted to a commit
tee of four judges who choose the
winning students.
Sophomore Joshua Knobe and
freshmen Seth Katz and Andreea
Nieoara won for their CIV essays,
while sophomores Nicholas Walsh
and Bryan Sun and freshmen
Tracey Schultz and Alessia Bell
were awarded for their work in
WCT.
Honorable mention winners
were freshmen Jennifer James,
Stephanie Dittmer and Samuel
Marks for CIV and freshmen Alice
Cathcart, Karen Heywood,
Amelia Hughart, Hob Hedges and
sophomores Karen Matsuoka and
Eileen Chang for WCT.
When choosing winners the
committee looked for interesting,
well-written and well-structured
essays, said Joyce Moser, commit

tee judge and associate director
for WCT.
"I'm never surprised about
how intelligent the students are
but about how many interests
they have . . . you never know
what you're going to get next,"
Moser said.
CIV winner Nieoara said she
"tried to do her best but didn't
expect to win" when she wrote
her essay 'From Chivalric Love to
the Prostitution . . . the Break
down of Female Patronage.' "
She said she was particularly
surprised to win since her native
language is Romanian. "It gives
me the confidence that I can com
pose my writing so that people
won't recognize I'm foreign,"
Nieoara said.
Students were awarded for
their outstanding essays during a
reception at the Faculty Club last

Tuesday. All students were given
a copy of "The Riverside Shake
speare" and a calligraphed book
plate. In addition, the winners
received a calligraphed certificate
and $250.
The Boothe Prizes, first award
ed in 1983, are sponsored by Catie
and D. Power Boothe, Jr., class of
*31.
Walsh — a WCT winner — said
he was glad to meet Boothe at the
reception when he received his
prize for his original essay,
"Mechanized Guitar Solos: Is Per
fection Boring?"
Walsh plans to spend his prize
money when he goes overseas
next year. "The money was really
useful, but finding recognition at
the University was more impor
tant," he said. "It gave an excel
lent conclusion to my freshman
year."
