### Jim Luh Staff writer 
Twenty-one professional journalists have
been named to the John S. Knight Fellow
ships program at Stanford University for the
1994-95 academic year.
Started in 1965, the Knight Fellows pro
gram allows professional journalists to take
time out of their careers to attend Stanford
for a year, pursuing independent study and
attending seminars.
The John S. and James L. Knight Founda
tion will fund twelve fellowships for journal
ists hailing from the United States.
Next year's class will also include six inter
national journalists, representing Colombia,
Romania, Brazil, Korea and Japan. Those fel
lowships will be funded by the Reuter Foun
dation, the Knight Foundation and the Shiny -
oung Journalism Fund.

In addition, Shuli Hu of the China Busi
ness Times in Beijing will be the first fellow
sponsored by the Lyle M. Nelson Fund.
The fund was created last year by former
international Knight Fellows to honor Nel
son, who served as director of the Knight Fel
lows Program from 1969 to 1985 and pio
neered the inclusion of journalists from for
eign nations into the Knight Fellows pro
gram.
"ILyle Nelson 1 was always very committed
to having international fellows admitted to
this program," said Jim Bettinger, director of
the program.
Bettinger said he is pleased with next
year's class.
"We're very proud of this class," he said. "We
think it's going to be a good class of fellows."
"It's a pretty classy and high-powered
group," said Communication Prof. Jim Risser,
also a coordinator of the program.

The quality of next year's class is apparent
by the high-profile news organizations from
which the fellows come, Bettinger said. Fellow
Jane Gross is the San Francisco bureau chief
for The New York Times. In addition, The
New Yorker will be represented for the first
time ever by senior editor Kim Heron.
Gross and Heron are by no means the only
outstanding fellows selected for next year,
Bettinger noted. "They're all distinctive in
some way," he said.
"It's a diverse group, both geographically
and by the kinds of news organizations repre
sented," Risser said.
He added that the fellows span a wide vari
ety of media backgrounds, bringing experi
ence from both print and broadcast media and
from news organizations ranging in size from
local publications such as the Monterey Coun
ty Herald to global-interest publications such
as The New York Times.
