### Cindy Yu Staff writer 
A Palo Alto reserve police officer was killed Sunday during
a security training exercise for the upcoming World Cup soc
cer tournament when another officer's gun accidentally dis
charged.
Police from the Mountain View, Palo Alto, and Los Altos po
lice departments were conducting a role-playing exercise on
an out-of-service Amtrak train at the Gilroy train station
when Reserve Officer Theodore Brassinga of Redwood City
was accidentally shot by another team member.
The exercise, which required officers to take over the train

and make arrests, was intended to help officers prepare for
possible emergencies on trains that will bring fans to the
World Cup games to be held at Stanford Stadium in June and
July. The exercise involved more than 20 officers from the
three police departments.
After the accident, officials immediately halted the training
exercise and closed off the train. Brassinga was taken to South
Valley Hospital in Gilroy, where he was later pronounced
dead.
The identity of the Mountain View police officer who fired
the gun has not yet been released. The officer has been placed
on administrative leave pending
investigation by both the Gilroy
and Mountain View police depart
ments, according to Jim Enslen,
captain of administrations for the
Mountain View Police Department.
The Gilroy Police Department's
investigation will focus on why the
officer's gun was loaded with live
ammunition, according to Gilroy
Police Chief Roy Sumisaki.
While the Gilroy Police
Department will investigate the
incident, the Mountain View
Police Department is conducting
an internal investigation into
whether the police officer who
shot Brassinga "violated any safe
ty policies or procedural guide
lines" during the training exercis
es, Enslen said.
The police will also investigate
whether its "training policies are
adequate," Enslen said.
The officer involved in the
shooting will remain on adminis
trative leave "until I the possibili
ty of) criminal charges or viola
tions has been thoroughly investi
gated," probably "within the
week," Enslen said.
The police departments have
decided not to suspend security
training for the .World Cup,
Enslen said.
Rick La Plante, venue press
officer for the World Cup, said
the accident will not affect the
World Cup soccer games at Stan
ford.
"It was a terrible, unfortunate
tragedy . . . but it was an exercise
under local jurisdiction and
responsibility," La Plante said.
Peter Bridgwater, executive
director of the San Francisco
venue for World Cup USA 1994,
issued a statement saying, "We
are deeply saddened by this terri
ble accident. We have great sym
pathy for Mrs. Brassinga and
their son. . . . We all appreciate
the hard work and dedication of
the police in our community."
Brassinga, 33, was a sales rep
resentative at Crown Worldwide
Moving and Storage in San Lean
dro. He joined the police force as
a reserve officer in January 1993
and is survived by his wife and
14-month-old son. A memorial
for Brassinga is scheduled for
May 19 in Redwood City.
