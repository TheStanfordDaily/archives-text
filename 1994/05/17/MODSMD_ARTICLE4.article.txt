# Culinary cuisine on wheels
## Starving diners flock to traveling taco truck

For the wandering tribes of
Tresidder, those diners parched
of lip and grumbling of stomach,
George's Industrial Catering
truck is a culinary angel of
mercy on wheels.
Beckoning its devotees with
an ear-piercing horn trumpet
ing "Day at the Races,"the
truck bellies up to the curb in
front of Encina Hall weekdays
at 11:15 a.m., ready for busi
ness.
After a few last toots of the
horn, Rich Ramirez jumps down
from the helm of this aluminum
food freighter, and in less than
30 seconds, he transforms the
impenetrable metal mobile into
Chez George's, home of friendly
service and some of the best
breakfast and lunch fare on
campus.
Inside, Lupe Garcia readies
the grill as the first few cus
tomers straggle out of the of
fices housed in Encina Hall.
Garcia welcomes her customers

on the street with a cheery,
"Hey, hey, howya doin'?" or a
"Somethin' for ya?" as the
crowd grows.
Soon there are several people
standing at the curb, and Garcia
and Ramirez scramble to serve
them all. "The usual?" asks
Garcia, who not only knows
most of her customers by name
after 10 years catering to the
Stanford campus, but has also
memorized their favorite or

"When you've had a bad day
at work and things in the office
are getting irritating, you come
out here and have somebody
smile at you, somebody who
knows your name," says Car
men Lonergan who works in the
Contract and Grant Assisted
Sponsored Projects Office. "It
makes you feel good."
Garcia and Ramirez have
been running the Stanford
route for over a decade, serving
500 to 600 customers a day and
while there's no consensus on
George's best offering, patrons
