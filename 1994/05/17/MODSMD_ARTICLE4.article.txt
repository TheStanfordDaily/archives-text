# Culinary cuisine on wheels
## Starving diners flock to traveling taco truck 
### Julie Makinen Tish Williams Senior staff writers 
For the wandering tribes of
Tresidder, those diners parched
of lip and grumbling of stomach,
George's Industrial Catering
truck is a culinary angel of
mercy on wheels.
Beckoning its devotees with
an ear-piercing horn trumpet
ing "Day at the Races,"the
truck bellies up to the curb in
front of Encina Hall weekdays
at 11:15 a.m., ready for busi
ness.
After a few last toots of the
horn, Rich Ramirez jumps down
from the helm of this aluminum
food freighter, and in less than
30 seconds, he transforms the
impenetrable metal mobile into
Chez George's, home of friendly
service and some of the best
breakfast and lunch fare on
campus.
Inside, Lupe Garcia readies
the grill as the first few cus
tomers straggle out of the of
fices housed in Encina Hall.
Garcia welcomes her customers

on the street with a cheery,
"Hey, hey, howya doin'?" or a
"Somethin' for ya?" as the
crowd grows.
Soon there are several people
standing at the curb, and Garcia
and Ramirez scramble to serve
them all. "The usual?" asks
Garcia, who not only knows
most of her customers by name
after 10 years catering to the
Stanford campus, but has also
memorized their favorite or
ders.
"When you've had a bad day
at work and things in the office
are getting irritating, you come
out here and have somebody
smile at you, somebody who
knows your name," says Car
men Lonergan who works in the
Contract and Grant Assisted
Sponsored Projects Office. "It
makes you feel good."
Garcia and Ramirez have
been running the Stanford
route for over a decade, serving
500 to 600 customers a day and
while there's no consensus on
George's best offering, patrons


Curtis Chen — Daily
Students line up to devour the Killer' fries and other authentic Mex
ican fare served up daily by the taco truck outside Encina Hall.
overwhelmingly agree that the
truck serves the best food on
campus.
"The fries are killer," says
Connie Varwig, who works in
Accounts Payable and lunches at
the truck three out of five days of
the week.
"You can't find any better
Mexican food on campus,"
attests Lonergan as she and Vic
toria Smith of Accounts Payable
commandeer Varwig's box of
fries.
The work day begins at 6
a.m., when Garcia prepares the
food for the trip and Ramirez
stocks the truck for the day's ser
vice.
By 9:30 a.m. the two are off
and running, starting with the
Ronald McDonald House behind
the shopping center and later
moving on to selected business
and construction sites across
campus.
Each stop lasts for 10 to 15
minutes. The truck casts it
metallic glow in front of the Pro
curement Department at 10 a.m.,
at 855 Serra Street at 11 a.m., at
Encina Hall at 11:15 a.m and
near Memorial Auditorium at
11:35 a.m.
Between stops on campus, the
duo ventures off to several local
car dealerships.
At noon, Garcia and Ramirez
motor over to Arillaga Center,
and they end their day around
12:30 p.m. on Bonair Siding near
the police station.
"The whole police department
comes by," says Garcia. "But
they don't take any doughnuts at
all. They're the only people I see
who don't take any at all."
Cleaning the grill between
stops, Garcia philosophizes about

the hazards of her line of work —
the stress of dealing with people,
constantly changing locations
and reckless motorists.
"You can't describe the perils
of catering," says Garcia, who
used to work as a political assis
tant with the City of San Jose
before venturing into the food
service industry. "I always say
they should make a documentary
about it."
Munching burritos, ham
burgers, chicken sandwiches,
huevos rancheros and french
fries, customers catch up on
office gossip and swap analyses
of the current plotline on "All
My Children."
The socializing pauses only
for a second as Garcia inquires
about a sandwich order, "Ms.
Malibu, do you want everything
on that?"
"Hold the produce," the cus
tomer answers, as Ramirez extols
the virtues of their latest item, a
new brand of root beer.
Garcia and Ramirez began
running the truck independently
two years ago, when George's dis
banded its fleet of 500 catering
trucks, selling them off to indi
vidual operators.
The restaurant on wheels
comes complete with a steam
table, refrigeration unit, grill,
fryer, oven, cold box and the
unmistakable horn.
"The good and bad come with
the horn," says Ramirez. "Some
people love it, some people hate
it."
"Industrial catering is a dying
breed," says Garcia, who makes
her special meatloaf on Mondays
and potato salad on Wednesdays.
"It's a unique industry. We oper
ate just to open our doors and
say, 'Hi, are you hungry?' "
The best part of the job, they
both agree, is "making people
smile," says Garcia. "You don't
see enough people smile."

on that?"
"Hold the produce," the cus
tomer answers, as Ramirez extols
the virtues of their latest item, a
new brand of root beer.
Garcia and Ramirez began
running the truck independently
two years ago, when George's dis
banded its fleet of 500 catering
trucks, selling them off to indi
vidual operators.
The restaurant on wheels
comes complete with a steam
table, refrigeration unit, grill,
fryer, oven, cold box and the
unmistakable horn.
"The good and bad come with
the horn," says Ramirez. "Some
people love it, some people hate
it."
"Industrial catering is a dying
breed," says Garcia, who makes
her special meatloaf on Mondays
and potato salad on Wednesdays.
"It's a unique industry. We oper
ate just to open our doors and
say, 'Hi, are you hungry?' "
The best part of the job, they
both agree, is "making people
smile," says Garcia. "You don't
see enough people smile."
For the wandering tribes of
Tresidder, those diners parched
of lip and grumbling of stomach,
George's Industrial Catering
truck is a culinary angel of
mercy on wheels.
Beckoning its devotees with
an ear-piercing horn trumpet
ing "Day at the Races,"the
truck bellies up to the curb in
front of Encina Hall weekdays
at 11:15 a.m., ready for busi
ness.
After a few last toots of the
horn, Rich Ramirez jumps down
from the helm of this aluminum
food freighter, and in less than
30 seconds, he transforms the
impenetrable metal mobile into
Chez George's, home of friendly
service and some of the best
breakfast and lunch fare on
campus.
Inside, Lupe Garcia readies
the grill as the first few cus
tomers straggle out of the of
fices housed in Encina Hall.
Garcia welcomes her customers

on the street with a cheery,
"Hey, hey, howya doin'?" or a
"Somethin' for ya?" as the
crowd grows.
Soon there are several people
standing at the curb, and Garcia
and Ramirez scramble to serve
them all. "The usual?" asks
Garcia, who not only knows
most of her customers by name
after 10 years catering to the
Stanford campus, but has also
memorized their favorite or
ders.
"When you've had a bad day
at work and things in the office
are getting irritating, you come
out here and have somebody
smile at you, somebody who
knows your name," says Car
men Lonergan who works in the
Contract and Grant Assisted
Sponsored Projects Office. "It
makes you feel good."
Garcia and Ramirez have
been running the Stanford
route for over a decade, serving
500 to 600 customers a day and
while there's no consensus on
George's best offering, patrons


Curtis Chen — Daily
Students line up to devour the Killer' fries and other authentic Mex
ican fare served up daily by the taco truck outside Encina Hall.
overwhelmingly agree that the
truck serves the best food on
campus.
"The fries are killer," says
Connie Varwig, who works in
Accounts Payable and lunches at
the truck three out of five days of
the week.
"You can't find any better
Mexican food on campus,"
attests Lonergan as she and Vic
toria Smith of Accounts Payable
commandeer Varwig's box of
fries.
The work day begins at 6
a.m., when Garcia prepares the
food for the trip and Ramirez
stocks the truck for the day's ser
vice.
By 9:30 a.m. the two are off
and running, starting with the
Ronald McDonald House behind
the shopping center and later
moving on to selected business
and construction sites across
campus.
Each stop lasts for 10 to 15
minutes. The truck casts it
metallic glow in front of the Pro
curement Department at 10 a.m.,
at 855 Serra Street at 11 a.m., at
Encina Hall at 11:15 a.m and
near Memorial Auditorium at
11:35 a.m.
Between stops on campus, the
duo ventures off to several local
car dealerships.
At noon, Garcia and Ramirez
motor over to Arillaga Center,
and they end their day around
12:30 p.m. on Bonair Siding near
the police station.
"The whole police department
comes by," says Garcia. "But
they don't take any doughnuts at
all. They're the only people I see
who don't take any at all."
Cleaning the grill between
stops, Garcia philosophizes about

the hazards of her line of work —
the stress of dealing with people,
constantly changing locations
and reckless motorists.
"You can't describe the perils
of catering," says Garcia, who
used to work as a political assis
tant with the City of San Jose
before venturing into the food
service industry. "I always say
they should make a documentary
about it."
Munching burritos, ham
burgers, chicken sandwiches,
huevos rancheros and french
fries, customers catch up on
office gossip and swap analyses
of the current plotline on "All
My Children."
The socializing pauses only
for a second as Garcia inquires
about a sandwich order, "Ms.
Malibu, do you want everything
on that?"
"Hold the produce," the cus
tomer answers, as Ramirez extols
the virtues of their latest item, a
new brand of root beer.
