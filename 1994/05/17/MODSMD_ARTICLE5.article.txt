Seven Stanford varsity athletes were ar
rested early yesterday morning for alleged
ly vandalizing the white "Gay Liberation"
sculpture located on the west side of cam
pus.
Junior Dusty Allen, junior Mark Butter
field, sophomore Robert Gardner, junior
Thomas Irwin, senior Todd Laßocca, fresh
man Brendan Sullivan and sophomore
Jason White will be charged with the mis
demeanor of vandalism for allegedly dam
aging the four bronze figures, according to
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
Black liquid acrylic paint had been
poured on the figures and a nearby wooden
bench was rammed between the two stand
ing male figures in such a way that "it took
three people to get it out," said Art Prof. Al
bert Elsen, who was immediately called to
the scene to assess the damaged artwork.
Allen, Gardner, Laßocca and Sullivan
are members of the Cardinal baseball team.
Butterfield and White are members of the
Stanford football team, and Irwin is a
wrestler.
Gardner, Butterfield and White will also
be charged with resisting arrest for al
legedly running from police, Stanford
Deputy Tim Frecceri said.
Police were first alerted to the crime
when a witness called at about 2 a.m. to say
he had seen six to seven individuals van
dalizing the statue, Niemeyer said.

After arriving at the scene, police chased
down four students — who fled in a pickup
truck — while another deputy single-hand
edly pursued three on foot, Elsen said.
The pickup was stopped on Santa Tere
sa Street. Police discovered cans of black
paint in the truck, Niemeyer said.
Elsen said he began cleaning the statues
shortly after the incident and then called
the police station to have the students help.
Butterfield, Allen and White volunteered
to assist Elsen, while the remaining stu
dents arrived after police had questioned
them, when much of the work had been
completed already.
When asked if any of the students had
been drinking, Irwin said last night that "a
few of the guys had a little bit."
According to Irwin, "It was a sponta
neous deal — it just kind of happened. Pret
ty much we screwed up."
Sullivan agreed, saying, "It was a mis
take. I'm sorry. I don't think we really re
alized the implications."
Asked how he might address the gay. bi
sexual and lesbian community, Butterfield
said, "I just want to apologize and let them
know I have nothing against homosexuals
or anything. It was just a foolish act, and
I'm sorry it ever happened."
White agreed and said that the students
had no political motivation for the crime.
"It happened to be where we were. It
wasn't anything directed toward (the gay,
lesbian and bisexual community! directly."
