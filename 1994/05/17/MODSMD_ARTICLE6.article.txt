# CUE discusses advising, technology at meeting
## 
### Megan Himan Staff writer 
Increasing the use of technology in class
rooms and improving the quality of under
graduate advising were the main issues dis
cussed bv the Commission on Undergradu
ate Education at their meeting yesterday.
The Subcommittee on Techniques and
Technology in Teaching and Learning rec
ommended that the University move ahead
to encourage faculty use of innovative tech
niques in teaching, according to Gail Ma
hood, geology professor and commission
member.
"We discussed that lecturing in large
classes is not always the best way to learn,"
Mahood said.
The committee proposed increasing the
use of computers to bolster student inter
action in class, as opposed to passive note
taking. Mahood emphasized that the com
mittee did not want to completely overhaul

teaching with the use of technology, but
rather make the option of technology avail
able to faculty.
"We do not want technology for technol
ogy's sake. We recommend that the Uni
versity do things to make it easier for facul
ty to employ techniques to improve their
teaching," Mahood 9aid.
A survey conducted by the subcommit
tee revealed that few faculty members use
technology because they don't have the
knowledge or time to learn it. The commis
sion will recommend that the University
establish a "one-stop shopping" location for
faculty where they can go and learn what
technology is available and how to use it,
Mahood said.
Referring to the initial time investment,
Mahood said, "In the short term this is not
something that saves you time. The Universi
ty could help overcome the energy barrier by
providing things to make it easi
er."
Commission Chair James
Sheehan said the commission
wanted to make sure that
addressing technology issues on
campus was a part of the Univer
sity's agenda.
"The same technology that is
transforming all of our lives is
going to transform the Universi
ty," Sheehan said.
Commission members also dis
cussed concerns about the quality
of undergraduate advising. One
survey of seniors presented at the
meeting showed a dissatisfaction
with the quality of general advis
ing during freshman and sopho
more years.
One problem is that only one
third of freshman advisers are
faculty members, Mahood said,
adding that University staff, lec
turers and even some graduate

students serve as advisers.
Sheehan said the commission
is looking for ways to increase
faculty involvement in under
graduate advising as well as
improving its quality.
Commission members will not
recommend a vast overhaul of
the advising system at this point,
Mahood said, but will advocate a
variety of small pilot experiments
to "see what works."
"We are dealing with two main
issues: one, how we can establish
a culture with the expectation
that faculty will be involved with
advising, and two, how we can
provide incentives for faculty,"
Mahood said.
Commission members' recom
mendations for the advising sys
tem include the expansion of the
current sophomore seminar
series, which offers opportunities
to groups of three to five students
to explore an academic discipline
with a faculty member. Mahood
also mentioned the possibility of
freshman seminars taught dur
ing spring quarter.
