## 
### José J. Gutierrez Staff writer 
Strange things are happening
in the world of baseball. The
Texas Rangers, a team with a
winning percentage under .500,
is leading the American League
West, players have to bear $5
million salaries and the Atlanta
Braves have been moved from
the National League West divi
sion to the central.
In addressing these and other
strange phenomena surrounding
the "American past-time,"
KZSU baseball announcer Scott
Walker moderated a discussion
on the future of baseball before
an audience of 50 in Cubberley
Auditorium last night.
Panelists — who included
Economics Prof, and "baseball
economics god" Roger Noll, His
tory Prof, and "Cubs fan" Jack
Rakove, Stanford Cardinal first
baseman Dusty Allen and Asst.
Baseball Coach Dave Esker — fo

Although baseball has re

media concerning free agency,
divisional realignment, team
management and expansion
clubs, the four panelists said
they were optimistic about the
game's future.

The panel said that free
agency — which allows players
to entertain offers from any
team — directly affects fans' per
ceptions of player loyalty. Esker
said that fans respect players
who begin and end their careers
with the same team and that a
certain stigma is attached to
those who simply play for the
highest bidder, a phenomenon
he described as "mercenary
baseball."
