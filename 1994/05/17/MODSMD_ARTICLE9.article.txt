< t< <; mentors, called "master" teachers,
part of the 1994 Stanford Summer
l eaching School.

.el - Organizers say the new summer
n will be a unique opportunity for
1 i' t<> actively educate students in a
ontrolled environment.
ire absolutely delighted that this
coming together this year. This
1 live effort I between Stanford and
1 ioIsJ is the first of its kind in Cal
said Nel Noddings, acting dean of
School of Education.
sii nnner school program is designed
valuable classroom experience to
jr • : teachers as well as provide chal
nd provocative coursework to 540

middle and high school students.
The program will also allow STEP stu
dents to work with master teachers from
the local area and to "see gifted teachers in
action and learn about what is possible in a
diverse classroom," STEP Assoc. Director
Beverly Carter said in a press release.
The master teachers — who were select
ed by the San Mateo Office of Education —
are certified and generally have three
years of experience in teaching, Carter
said. Most of them are from the Bay Area
and some are recent STEP graduates.
STEP is continually looking for better
ways of educating student teachers, said
Carter.
"The program will offer student teach
ers 'hands-on experience,' " said Felton
Owens, the principal of Stanford's Sum
mer Teaching School and also of San Jose's
Independence School.
"Our vision is to prepare student teach
ers for world-class standards," Owens said.
One goal of the program is to offer stu
dent teachers a realistic picture of what it
is like to be a teacher, Carter said, adding

that efforts are being made to include in
the program students who are of diverse
ethnicities, economic backgrounds and lan
guage abilities.
"STEP students need to be exposed to . .
. this full range of students," Carter said.
Students and adults will interact quite a
bit, she added. Thirty students will be put
in each classroom, and about four student
teachers from STEP will be assigned to
each room along with one or two master
teachers.
Most of the students who will enroll in
the program are seventh, eighth and ninth
graders. They will be taking a mix of mid
dle and high school level courses in areas
such as English, social studies and Span
ish.
Students attending the summer school
will come from two types of admissions
programs. Students were either sponsored
by their school districts or paid a tuition of
$300 for six weeks of instruction.
About 10 school districts have reserved
spaces for students, including the Palo Alto
Unified School District, Redwood Citv Ele

mentary School District, Milpitas Unified
School District, Los Altos School District
and San Jose Unified School District,
Carter said.
Last September, Noddings asked the
Stanford Educational Collaborative to
establish the summer school program.
Members of the collaborative's steering
committee — half of whom are professors
and graduate students and half of whom
are teachers and administrators from local
school districts — made the idea a reality,
Carter said.
The Stanford Educational Collaborative
was created in 1986 as a public service out
reach project of the School of Education.
The collaborative aims to bring local teach
ers and administrators together with the
University in hopes of improving learning
in California.
The summer school program — which is
sponsored by the San Mateo County Office
of Education and the Stanford Educational
Collaborative — will run from June 27 to
August 5 at the Jane Lanthrop Stanford
Middle School in Palo Alto.
