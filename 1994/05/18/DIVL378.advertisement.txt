What do Milton,
Homer, and
Michelangelo have
to do with business?
Well, everything ...
History's best writers, poets, and artists would have made
great management consultants. After all, we remember them
for their deep insights and their ability to express ideas with
prose, verse, or brush, more eloquently than the common
man. These are precisely the talents that distinguish today's
truly great business thinkers.

history, art, or literature, you may have what it takes to be a
management consultant. If you're serious about your career,
we've got a serious opportunity for you.
