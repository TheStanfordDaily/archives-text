I Learned Hand: The Man and the Judge
The greatest judge never to be named to the Supreme Court, Learned

Judge Learned Hand and Chief Justice
"Gerald Gunther's masterly study Learned Hand: The Man and the Judge
gives us the life of the man integrated with the life of the judge. It is the
fullest, most sensitive, most penetrating of judicial biographies. I do not
know its equal."
