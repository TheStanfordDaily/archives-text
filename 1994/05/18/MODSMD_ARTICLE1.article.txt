# Coveted econ prof signs on with Stanford

### Romesh Ratnesar Editorial staff 
Paul Krugman, one of the world's leading author
ities on international trade, has accepted a tenured
faculty position in the Stanford Economics Depart
ment.
Krugman, a visiting professor at the Graduate
School of Business this year, is widely recognized for
his work in both trade theory and policy. He has
taught at MIT since 1979.
The 41-year-old Krugman will also have a joint ap
pointment at the Institute for International Studies.
"It's a fine department," Krugman said, "and I
was made a very nice offer." He added that "there are
no aspersions to be cast at MIT."
Krugman's appointment was hailed last week by
University President Gerhard Casper in his State of
the University address. Casper called Krugman "one
of the world's most distinguished economists."
Walter Falcon, director of lIS, said Krugman has
"spectacular credentials as a theorist and an applied
policy person."
"He's about as household a name as one gets in
economics," Falcon said.
Economics Department Chair David Starrett said
Krugman's appointment has just been submitted to
the Dean of Humanities and Sciences' office for final
authorization but said he does not expect any prob-
lems.
Starrett said that the offering
Krugman a post in the depart
ment will not mean the elimina
tion of another position. "We still
have in our department one or
two vacant billets," he said.
"He's such an eminent
economist, we would have added
him anyway," Starrett said. "He
surrounds the subject more than
anyone else. He has experience in
the real side of trade and the
financial side."
Falcon also praised Krugman's
versatility. "What is so unusual
about him is that one day he can
write the most lucid of theoretical
articles for a scholarly journal,
and the next day write an
extremely relevant, empirical pol
icy paper," he said. "There aren't
many people in the world with
that kind of dual capability."
This quarter, Krugman is
teaching a joint undergraduate
graduate level course titled "Cities,
Regions and Nations." The class
examines the role of geography
and location theory in internation

al economics, and Krugman
described it as "offbeat."
"It has been fun, and the stu
dents are very lively," he said.
"I'm afraid I don't have anything
very dramatic to say. The teach
ing has been enjoyable, and I hope
the students found it useful."
Krugman also taught a course
at the Business School in the win
ter. He said he is tentatively plan
ning on teaching an undergradu
ate course on international trade
next fall.
Falcon said Krugman will
study political economy at the
institute, and will likely partici
pate in ongoing group research
ventures on issues such as North
American Free Trade Agreement
and the international computer
industry. "In a number of these
areas, he will play a lead role in
research forms," Falcon said.
"And he will also be the star indi
vidual scholar he clearly is."
In addition to his tenure at
MIT, Krugman served on Presi
dent Reagan's Council of Econom
ic Advisers from 1982-83. He was
elected to the American Academy
of Arts and Sciences in 1992.
He has published six books,
most recently "Foreign Direct
Investment in the United States."
