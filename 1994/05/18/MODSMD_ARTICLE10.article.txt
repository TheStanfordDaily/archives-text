Flogging avoided
SINGAPORE (AP) â€” Prosecutors
struck a plea bargain yesterday with an
American teenager charged in a vandal
ism spree, sparing Singapore further fric
tion with Washington over its flogging
penalty for vandalism.
Stephen P. Freehill, 17, of Chicago
pleaded guilty to the minor charge of
possessing stolen property and was let
go with a fine of $516. Vandalism and
mischief charges were dropped in the
case, which stemmed from foreign teen
agers spray-painting cars and commit
ting other criminal acts in October.
It was a muted end to a trial that could
have reignited the furor over the caning
earlier this month of Michael Fay, an
American who pleaded guilty to vandal
ism.

Fay, 18, received four lashes with a
rattan cane on the bare buttocks May 5
and is recovering while serving a four
month term in Queenstown Prison.

tute, researchers at the Manitoba Insti
tute of Cell Biology in Winnipeg report
that cancer tumors grew faster and larg
er in mice injected with loratadine,
astemizole and hydroxyzine, three anti
histamines.
