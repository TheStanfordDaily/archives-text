HEBRON, West Bank (AP) -
Arab gunmen ambushed a car
south of Hebron yesterday,
killing two Jewish settlers and
wounding a third in the first fatal
attack on Israelis since the auton
omy accord was signed with the
PLO.
The shooting came a day after
clashes between stone-throwing
Palestinians and Jewish settlers
in Hebron. At least 18 Palestini
ans were wounded when settlers
opened fire and soldiers later shot
to disperse rioters.
It also came as Secretary of
State Warren Christopher left
Jerusalem to tour Jericho, the
West Bank town that is to be the
seat of the Palestine Liberation
Organization's administration for
the self-rule zones.
An anonymous caller to Israel
radio claimed the ambush was
staged by the Izzedine al-Qassam
brigades, the armed underground
of the radical Islamic movement
Hamas, which opposes the Israel-
PLO peace process.
The caller said the attack was a

response to the peace deal and for
the massacre of 30 Muslim wor
shipers in a Hebron mosque by a
Jewish settler in February.
The ambush was shortly
after 9 a.m. on a winding road
about 200 yards south of the
Beit Haggai settlement near
Hebron. The area is in the part
of the West Bank still occupied
by Israel.
The army said at least two
gunmen fired several bursts from
automatic weapons at the white
Fiat, and the bullet-riddled car
came to a halt near a plum
orchard. A car believed to have
been used by the assailants was
later found burned nearby.
Reuven Tal, a settler from Beit
Haggai, was the first person to get
to the scene.
"This government is not a gov
ernment of peace or of security
and it has to go as quickly as pos
sible," said Tal.
He and other settlers angrily
accused Israel's government of
abandoning them and discourag
ing the troops stationed in the

West Bank from protecting them.
Lt. Gen. Ehud Barak, the
chief of staff, rejected the criti
cism, saying there was no way
the army could be "everywhere,
all of the time." He urged Israelis
to carry their weapons to guard
against attacks by Palestinian
militants.
"We know that the attacks are
likely to continue," Barak said at
the ambush site.
Margolit Ruth Shochat, 46, an
Israeli woman from the settle
ment of Maaleh Levonah, was
killed and her daughter, Yael
Naama, 21, was seriously wound
ed, settlers said.
Rafael Yairi, 35, from the set
tlement of Kiryat Arba, died while
being treated by army medics.
Settlers said they believed he was
a Dutch convert to Judaism.
They were. the first Israelis
slain by Arabs since the autono
my agreement was signed in
Cairo, Egypt, leading to Israel's
withdrawal this week from the
Jericho area and most of the Gaza
Strip.
