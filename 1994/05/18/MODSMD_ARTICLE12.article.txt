# Federal Reserve attacks inflation
## Two key interest rates raised by half percentage point each 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Federal
Reserve launched its most aggressive
attack on inflation in more than Ave
years yesterday, boosting two key inter
est rates by a half percentage point
each.
The action triggered similar increas
es by commercial banks in their prime
lending rates, meaning that short-term
borrowing costs will be rising for mil
lions of Americans.
But it also brought cheers from Wall
Street where both stocks and bonds
posted impressive rallies — a sharp con
trast to three smaller Fed hikes earlier
this year that sent financial markets
into tailspins.
The Dow Jones industrial average
shot up 49.11 points while the Trea
sury's benchmark 30-year bond posted

an impressive price gain that sent the
yield down to 7.29 percent.
Analysts attributed the turnabout in
market sentiment to a belief that the
Fed's moves meant the central bank
was through for the time being.
"This is the decisive action that mar
kets were looking for. The Fed has
cleared the air," said David Jones, an
economist at Aubrey G. Lanston & Co.
in New York.
Analysts said the Fed's latest
increases may be a mixed blessing for
consumers, driving up short-term bor
rowing costs including home equity
loans that are tied to the prime rate but
at the same time lowering the cost for
long-term borrowing because of the
rally in bond markets.
In a brief statement, the Federal

Reserve said it was boosting the dis
count rate, the interest the central bank
charges on loans to commercial banks,
from 3 percent to 3.5 percent. It marked
the first increase in the discount rate
since 1989.
The central bank said it also was rais
ing the federal funds rate, the rate
banks charge each other, from 3.75 per
cent to 4.25 percent. Earlier this year, it
had boosted the funds rate three times
in quarter-point moves.
It marked the first time the central
bank had raised both its discount rate
and the funds rate by one-half point
since Feb. 24, 1989. The Fed said it was
making the two credit moves to "main
tain favorable trends in inflation and
thereby sustain the economic expan
sion."
