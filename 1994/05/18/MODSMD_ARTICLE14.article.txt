## Editorial Fac Sen disruption 
### 
Asian-American Studies
supporters should have
used the proper channels

The interruption of
Thursday's Faculty Senate
meeting by students protest
ing for Asian-American Studies
made it clear that many students
want a program as soon as possible.
But disrupting the meeting was
foolish; it did nothing to advance
Asian-American Studies and may
have even discouraged some facul
ty from supporting it.
About 25 members of "Concerned
Students for Asian American Stud
ies" interrupted the meeting to
demand that senators consider their
resolution — calling for a committee
to implement a new major — at the
May 19 session.
As a result of the disturbance, the
senate voted unanimously to
adjourn after only 20 minutes, caus
ing annual reports from the Disabil
ity Resource Center and Cowell Stu
dent Health Center's Counseling
and Psychological Services to be
postponed. The senate did not agree
to consider the Asian-American
Studies resolution at the May 19
meeting.
Thus, the protest did little, except
to anger faculty, show disrespect for
other groups who were on the agen
da legitimately, and portray students
who care about Asian-American
Studies as brats unwilling to follow
established rules.
Students could have worked with
in normal channels to get their reso
lution on the agenda of the May 19
meeting. According to Faculty Sen
ate rules, agenda items are sched
uled by the Steering Committee of
the senate one week ahead of time,
on the Wednesday before the Thurs
day senate meeting of the following
week.
Concerned Students for Asian
American Studies did not present a
proposal to the Steering Committee

by May 11, the deadline for the May
19 meeting said Prof. Pat Jones, the
chair of the Steering Committee
and the Faculty Senate. Why they
failed to do this is unclear, but the
fact remains that they did fail to do
it.
Was it that the protesters did not
do their homework? That seems
unlikely, because students have been
campaigning for Asian-American
Studies for 25 years.
Was it that the students distrust
ed the process? Did they think that
the Steering Committee would
ignore their agenda item or postpone
it ad infinitum? If so, the stronger
course of action would have been to
go through the process anyhow, and,
if it failed, bring that to the attention
of senators and the campus at large.
A protest lambasting the senate for
failing to accommodate the students
through the normal channels would
have had much more legitimacy
than Thursday's fiasco.
Jones said no petition had been
filed as of yesterday afternoon, but
if students submitted a proposal by
today the committee would consid
er putting it on the May 19 agenda.
But she stressed that "there real
ly isn't time for a discussion" on the
floor of the Faculty Senate, and that
other forums would be better for
getting the debate out to the public.
Whether Asian-American Studies
is discussed at the Faculty Senate
this month or not, students can con
tinue to gather faculty and student
support through other channels.
In addition, students should use
the coming week to thoroughly pre
pare for the May 27 meeting Dean of
Humanities and Sciences John
Shoven has set with students inter
ested in ethnic studies majors. To
come into this meeting hostile and
unprepared would only set their
cause back further.
After 25 years of proposals and
rhetoric, students who support
Asian-American Studies have a rea
son to be frustrated. But students
should take care that they scream
and shout at the right time for the
right reasons. Otherwise, it may just
be another 25 years.
