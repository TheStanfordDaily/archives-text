## Pigeon post loves the most 
### 
Communication, Stanford
style — telephones, answering
machines, voice mail, e-mail —
most of us probably take it for granted,
but we definitely exist in a fast-paced
realm of high technology.
Imagine a university community in
which few of the students have phones,
much less answering machines, e-mail is
unheard of — and all of these communi
cations networks were replaced by uni
formed bicyclists with big baskets.
It may sound impractical, even
absurd, to us phone dependents and e
mail junkies, but at Oxford University
the "pigeon post" routes are the life-giv
ing veins of communication, where
every day hundreds of slips of paper cir
culate through the university's 30-some
colleges.
So let us just forget for a moment our
need for utter immediacy, and consider
the advantages of relinquishing voice
mail for bicyclists. At Oxford, pigeon
post is a fast, free mail service which
allows you to send letters, club newslet
ters and papers — anything the messen
ger is willing to take in his or her bike
basket — on same-day service, delivered
several times a day, with all the added
tangibility and concreteness of written
communication.
But, as anyone who studies at Oxford
for long enough soon realizes, the true
beauty of pigeon post can be summed up
in two words — gutless wonder.

Telling your tutor you need an exten
sion on a paper, skipping out on team or
club obligations, smoothing over misun
derstandings — it's all so much easier
when you can write it down and send it
away. On paper we can all be our best
selves as we compose rough and final
drafts, with plenty of time to think
about what we write.
But perhaps most of all, pigeon post is
a blessing to the gutless wonders of dat
ing. Yeah, yeah, we all know who we are.
How many more people we would
have asked out if we didn't have to con
front potential rejection and humilia
tion as directly as over the phone or,
heaven forbid, in person? Sure, some at
Stanford have discovered the social
potential of e-mail, but the stigma of
asking somebody out via computer has
limited its scope so far.
But imagine the possibilities of being
able to ask people out on paper — your
most eloquent, unflustered self, unob
trusively tucked away in your potential
romantic interest's mailbox.
And whatever the reply, you get it by
pigeon post as well — if you get rejected,
it's discreet, tactful and you can rip the
damning evidence before anyone else
can see it. If not, you have your victory
sealed in writing, to show to your
friends, post on your wall or sleep with
under your pillow, whatever you please.
By pigeon post, you can't hear the
long silence that comes between, "Well,

I have to (excruciatingly long pause)
wash my hair, yeah, that's it. Wash my
hair."
You never have to agonize over
whether or not the dork-factor of asking
someone out over their answering
machine overrides the anxiety-factor of
direct conversation. You never wake
anybody up, or catch them at the wrong
times.
On a broader level, pigeon post versus
phone/answering machine seems to
reflect a less speed-obsessed, more
relaxed culture and university commu
nity, instead of needing the message to
be there now and demanding an answer
today.
And for all of us who have complained
about Stanford dating, the concept of
pigeon post seems to offer a solution.
Undoubtedly, there would be a lot more
asking being done by the lonely-but
scared, and more asking would lead to
more dating, and more dating. . . well, it
couldn't hurt to have less repression on
campus.

Angie would like to thank Elisa for sug
gesting this topic and apologize to her,
John and others for tactfully avoiding
their other suggestions, no last names
mentioned.
