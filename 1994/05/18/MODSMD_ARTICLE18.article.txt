## Students clarify events of May 12 Fac Sen meeting 
### 
After 23 years of struggle for an
Asian-American Studies program
at Stanford, we as Concerned Stu
dents for Asian American Studies are
frustrated with having to repeatedly val
idate our efforts. By failing to provide a
historically contextualized framework
for our action at the May 12 Faculty
Senate meeting, The Daily has unfairly
reported an incomplete picture. We feel
compelled to set the record straight.
Specifically:
• The Daily's recent articles have
failed to historicize the struggle for
Asian-American Studies at Stanford.
Efforts to establish an Asian-American
Studies program at Stanford began in
1970 when students organized the first
two Asian-American Studies courses.
The following year the first proposal for
an Asian American Studies curriculum
was submitted to the Dean of Under
graduate Studies. Subsequent proposals
to establish a formal department pro
gram (1975) and in support of hiring a
tenured track Asian-American Studies
professor (1988) garnered implicit sup
port from a 1989 University Committee
on Minority Issues (UCMI) report
asserting the need for a more fully devel
oped Asian-American Studies program.
Within the last six months, Asian-
American students have separately met
with University President Gerhard
Casper, Dean of Humanities and Sci
ences John Shoven, Professor of History
A 1 Camarillo and Associate Dean ,of
Graduate Policy George Dekker to dis-

cuss the need for Asian-American Stud
ies, faculty, student and faculty reten
tion and graduate student representa
tion. Anthropology Prof. Harumi Befu
also met with Provost Condoleezza Rice
and Shoven to express his concerns
regarding the same issues.
In a 1992 survey of more than 1,000
undergraduates, conducted by students
in the Comparative Literature 163 class,
almost 80 percent responded favorably
to the development of Asian-American
Studies, and this past February, a press
conference featuring Assistant Professor
of Comparative Literature David Palum
bo-Liu attempted to highlight the cur
rent status of Asian American issues at
Stanford.
Only through dedicated student
action were tenure-track Professors Gor
don Chang and David Palumbo-Liu
hired at all; and aside from these notable
exceptions, every proposal, every survey,
every meeting, every display of concern
and commitment by Asian-American
students and faculty has been met with
empty promises and lip service by the
administration. Not once in the past 23
years has the administration accepted a
concrete plan of action. Clearly, then,
our current push for Asian-American
Studies at Stanford has a long history of
attempted action, of sound ideology, and
of extraordinarily deep conviction in the
validity of our beliefs.
• The perception on the part of
Casper, Faculty Senate Chair Pat Jones
and other members of the senate that

we have attempted to initiate Asian-
American Studies solely on a whim dis
plays either utter ignorance or conscious
denial of the 23-year history detailed
above. Jones says we can't "just snap
our fingers and establish a program
overnight," and Casper claims that if we
"do not get our way immediately, it is
not an indication of something wrong
with the process."
Such statements serve only to deceive
the Stanford community, and to belittle,
indeed render invisible, our ongoing
attempts to work within the very pro
cesses to which both Jones and Casper
so tenaciously cling. Our present disen
chantment with those processes arises
from over two decades of disappoint
ment, frustration, and inaction, not
some irrational distrust of University
procedure or process.
• Only in light of these facts can the
incidents of the May 12 meeting be fully
and fairly evaluated. On May 4 at the
Chicana/o hunger strike, Casper told
students to take their concerns regard
ing ethnic studies programs to the Fac
ulty Senate.
Heeding his advice, we took action at
the May 12 senate meeting in order to
request that a resolution in support of
Asian-American Studies be placed on the
agenda for this Thursday's meeting (We
do not want to conflict with the May 26
meeting scheduled to address the pro
posed grading policy).
Members of the senate were informed
of the request before the meeting began.

Students filed in through the back door
of the senate meeting chamber and
silently lined the back wall. We had
hoped such actions, though unorthodox,
would secure from the senate a guaran
tee that we would be placed on the May
19 agenda; but only minutes into the
meeting, it was clear that the senate had
no intention of seriously addressing our
request.
Only then did student-designated
speaker Patty Tsai rise and respectfully
state our request. Jones pounded her
gavel the entire time telling Tsai to sit
down and come to order, and without
allowing Tsai to conclude, Jones called
for a motion to adjourn. The motion was
quickly seconded, and the meeting was
adjourned. We were never asked to
leave.
At this time, Concerned Students are
still not on the May 19 agenda. Despite a
history of marginalization, we are still
willing to work constructively to achieve
our goals. We've been here far too long
to give up now.
