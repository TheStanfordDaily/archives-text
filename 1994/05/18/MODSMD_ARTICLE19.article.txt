# A
						letter to our readers
## A
						time for re-examination; a request for input, ideas 
### 
The end of the year is a time of
chaos. However, amid the finals
and the papers, the formals and
the search for summer storage, it is
also a time of serious reflection.
For us at The Daily, reflection
comes in the form of a question: How
can we improve and put out the best,
most complete and most accurate
product we can — a newspaper which
you can trust and rely on?
We at The Daily are interested in
thoroughly re-examining ourselves and
our role on campus, and exploring con
crete ways to change to better serve
the community that we cover.
While The Daily is an award-win
ning newspaper by many accounts, we
know there are individuals who are
unhappy with The Daily. Many of you
have written letters to the editor or
called to give us feedback on a particu
lar story, and we always appreciate
your comments.
We also recognize that there are
many people whose feelings about The

Daily remain unspoken, and that some
concerns have accumulated over a
course of years.
And we understand that sometimes
you, our readers, may feel that we do
not listen to or care about what you
are thinking, that meetings with Daily
staff members are unproductive, that
editors are too defensive and unable to
take your thoughts into account.
We also comprehend that there are
some decisions we make which you do
not understand or with which you may
never agree, but that are necessary for
us to make. While these decisions may
cause tension, there are reasons for
our choices. We would like a chance to
explain to you just why we have made
some of our decisions.
Thus, we are extending to you —
students, faculty, administrators, and
staff — an open invitation. Be our mir
rors, reflect our shortcomings — and
also our strengths. As one means of
soliciting your input and hearing your
concerns, we are inviting you to a cam

pus-wide forum on Tuesday, May 24 at
4 p.m. in Tresidder Oak East.
The forum will be a chance for us to
listen to your thoughts and answer
your questions about The Daily. It is
also an opportunity for dialogue. We
hope that what we hear will help foster
a stronger relationship with you,
through explanations and examina
tions of both sides of different issues.
Not every word spoken will be trans
lated into instant Daily policy, but we
hope the forum will provide a fountain
of ideas.
The forum will be an open-micro
phone session, where Daily editors and
staff members will listen to comments
and respond to specific questions.
Communications Prof. Jeremy Cohen
has agreed to act as moderator. After
ward, we invite individuals to stay and
talk with members of the Daily staff
one-on-one. Refreshments will be pro
vided.
In the newspaper business, reflec
tion can be difficult. We at The Daily

grow very attached to the newspaper
we put out and that may make us hesi
tant to admit our faults.
The nature of the medium forces us
to leave the previous day behind and
look to filling the next day's paper.
But that does not mean we forget our
past errors. Like all individuals, we
have made mistakes. Some of them are
easily correctable — like a misspelled
word — but others have left lasting
impressions on the minds of you, our
readers.
So we feel it is important for us to
listen to the comments and criticisms
the Stanford community has concern
ing our product. We, as a staff, are
strongly committed to change, to
improving our newspaper and our rela
tionship with the community we both
cover and inform.
Why are we doing this now, with so
little time left in the academic year? '
Every single day in a newspaper is
equally important because it reflects
another issue, another chance to both

excel and err. In addition, what we do
now is the basis for the future. While a
few Daily staff members are graduat
ing, the rest of us will be here to con
tinue with the paper.
So once again, we ask your input —
both at the forum next week and on a
day-to-day basis. Call us, write us, e
mail us or come share your thoughts
and opinions in person.
