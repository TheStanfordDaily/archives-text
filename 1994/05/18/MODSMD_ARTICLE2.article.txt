## Women's self-defense not a Title IX violation, brief says 
### Beth Berselli Staff writer 
Supporters of reinstating the women's self-de
fense class submitted a legal brief to the University
Monday arguing that the course does not violate a
federal sexual discrimination law because it redress
es past and existing disadvantages to women.
Members of the Women Defending Ourselves Col
lective — who currently teach the class off campus —
prepared the brief as part of a campaign to bring the
course back to campus.
The class — titled "Issues in Self-Defense for
Women" and offered through the Program in Femi
nist Studies — was canceled last September after a
complaint that segregating sections by gender vio
lates Title IX, a 1972 regulation prohibiting sex dis
crimination in schools receiving federal funding.
The collective's 50-page document presents two
main arguments as to why the class does not violate
Title IX, said senior Jessica Cornette, a collective
member.
Authors of the brief said their intention is to con-
vince the University that the class
is legitimate on legal grounds, and
thus can, if reinstated, withstand
any future complaints.
Title IX allows women-only
courses which serve an affirma
tive action purpose, Cornette said.
"The idea of the affirmative action
clause is that if there exists limit
ed participation because of dis
crimination, it's okay to combat
that with a single-sex course," she
said.
The brief also cites the
Supreme Court's use of compen
satory purpose to support the
validity of the course. The court
has ruled that gender-based
exclusion is legal when it is neces

sary to compensate women for
past and existing discrimination,
said sophomore Rachel Katz, a
collective member.
"The frequency of sexual
assault on college campuses con
stitutes a discriminatory situa
tion which our class existed in
order to redress," Katz said.
The compensatory purpose
argument does not apply to an
organization unless several crite
ria are meet. "We had to show
that women at Stanford have suf
fered disadvantages specifically
because they are women," Cor
nette said.
The brief cites statistics from
the Women's Need Assessment
Report and a Rape Education
Project study as evidence that
"women at Stanford suffer a sex
based disadvantage in the form of
rape, domestic violence, the

threat and fear of sexual violence,
sexual harassment, institutional
ized sexism and unequal opportu
nities at Stanford."
The brief also argues that the
single-sex policy of the course was
adopted with the intention of
helping women overcome the dis
advantages they face.
"We believe that this class not
only compensates for the sex
based disadvantages Stanford
women suffer but is also an
important step in eliminating
these disadvantages," the brief
says.
The collective also claimed in
the brief that the class does not
perpetuate stereotypes about
women.
Collective members are opti
mistic about their chances of get
ting the class reinstated. "We
think we have a really strong legal

argument," Katz said. "We expect
the University to be reasonable."
Katz said the collective con
sulted with local lawyers when
preparing the brief.
She added that Provost Con
doleezza Rice and Assoc. Univer
sity General Counsel Iris Brest
should make a formal response to
the brief within the next few
weeks.
In addition to the brief, the col
lective gave Rice and Brest about
150 letters of support and 2,000
signatures on a petition calling
for the reinstatement of the class.
The collective will stage a rally
in support of the course's rein
statement at noon tomorrow in
White Plaza. Speakers will
include Sexual Assault Preven
tion Educator Angelina Cheney
and Assoc. Dean of Memorial
Church Diana Akiyama.
