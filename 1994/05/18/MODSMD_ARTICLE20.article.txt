## Sharing of blood hampered by cells' differing antigens Blood drives seek to alleviate nationwide shortages 
### Nikhil Raghavan 
Everyone on campus has had
an opportunity to donate blood,
yet few people understand the
true importance of their gift and
what happens to it after they
donate.
Recently blood banks around
the country have been suffering
a shortage of donors. Stanford
blood donations have dropped as
well although Stanford still cur
rently donates about 2,000 units
of blood per year.
According to Caryn Huber
man, an official at the Stanford
Blood Center, students at the
University have continually sup
ported the nation's blood supply,
donating blood in large quanti
ties at drives held about every
quarter.
The nationwide blood supply
has dropped at times to just a
one-day supply while the recom
mended level is a supply for
between five and seven days.
Analysts say that many more
deaths would have occurred dur
ing the Los Angeles earthquake
if the supply had been that low at
the time.
One of the major causes of
such a decrease in available blood
is the fact that people with non
matching blood types can often
only accept certain parts of the

blood from donors, if they can
accept any at all. For this reason,
there is often a shortage of a spe
cific blood type — A positive, for
example.
Blood types determine
whether or not a particular blood
sample can be used for a patient.
The determinants of a particular
person's blood type are the types
of antigens found in the blood of
the patient and donor.

Students at the Univer
sity have continually
supported the nation's
blood supply.

These antigens can be of types
A, B or D (which is commonly
referred to as the Rh factor
which can be positive or nega
tive).
There is also an additional
blood type "O" which means that
the red blood cells contain nei
ther A nor B antigens.
If a person is transfused with
blood which contains antigens
not in the patient's blood, then
the body will create antibodies to
those antigens.

Because of the different anti
gens in blood, the problem of
blood transfusions is magnified
since medics must check for com
patibility of blood types before
performing a transfusion.
Blood is comprised of four
components: red cells, white
cells, platelets and plasma. Red
cells transport oxygen and nutri
ents to the tissues and remove
carbon dioxide and other waste.
About 70 percent of blood
transfusions involve the transfer
of these cells from donor to
patient. White cells protect the
body against disease and infec
tion, and platelets help form clots
when bleeding occurs. Transfu
sions of platelets are primarily
used for treatment of cancer
patients.
Plasma, on the other hand, is
the yellow fluid portion of the
blood in which the red cells,
white cells and platelets are sus
pended, and can be useful to
transfuse by itself since 7 percent
of plasma is protein from which
derivatives are made. For exam
ple, cryoprecipitate, anti
hemophilic factor and fresh
frozen plasma are given to
hemophiliacs in order to aid their
condition.
Donated blood is very fragile
and needs to be treated carefully.
In order to do this, at a blood cen

ter it is broken into its four com
ponents using a centrifuge. Since
patients have different needs,
which component is given to peo
ple depends on what they
require.
Once the blood has been sepa
rated, each component has a dif
ferent life span and must be
stored differently.
Red cells, for example, have a
lifetime of 42 days and need to be
refrigerated, but platelets last for
only five days and are stored at
room temperature. To prevent
the platelets from clotting they

need to be constantly shaken.
Plasma, from which the cryo
precipitate is separated, can be
frozen for one year. Since blood
components vary in life span,
blood centers must constantly
look for fresh blood.
The Blood Center stresses
safety to donors. All the equip
ment used is new, disposable and
sterile and before anyone can
make a donation they must fill
out a comprehensive medical his
tory.
After the donation is made the
blood undergoes tests. Within 24

hours, blood which might infect a
patient with the hepatitis Band
C viruses, HIV (the AIDS virus),
HTLV-1 and 2, syphilis and other
viruses can be identified.
Currently, the Stanford Blood
Center is holding a blood drive to
try and alleviate the overall
shortage of blood throughout the
country. According to Huber
man, efforts on campus have
been successful in the past.
She said that the blood drive
will be coming to various resi
dences throughout the upcoming
weeks.

stored differently.
Red cells, for example, have a
lifetime of 42 days and need to be
refrigerated, but platelets last for
only five days and are stored at
room temperature. To prevent
the platelets from clotting they

need to be constantly shaken.
Plasma, from which the cryo
precipitate is separated, can be
frozen for one year. Since blood
components vary in life span,
blood centers must constantly
look for fresh blood.
The Blood Center stresses
safety to donors. All the equip
ment used is new, disposable and
sterile and before anyone can
make a donation they must fill
out a comprehensive medical his
tory.
After the donation is made the
blood undergoes tests. Within 24

hours, blood which might infect a
patient with the hepatitis Band
C viruses, HIV (the AIDS virus),
HTLV-1 and 2, syphilis and other
viruses can be identified.
Currently, the Stanford Blood
Center is holding a blood drive to
try and alleviate the overall
shortage of blood throughout the
country. According to Huber
man, efforts on campus have
been successful in the past.
She said that the blood drive
will be coming to various resi
dences throughout the upcoming
weeks.
