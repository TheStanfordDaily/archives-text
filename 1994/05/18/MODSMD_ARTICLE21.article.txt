# Counseling helps end bad habits
## Supports survivors of heart attacks after hospitalization 
### Michael Slemmer Editorial staff 
Implementation of new research
at the School of Medicine may solve
one of the major problems facing the
health of heart-attack survivors: how
to assure that they will change the
habits which put them at risk in the
first place.
According to Robert Deßusk, the
professor of medicine who led the
study, the technique relies on
encouraging patients to exercise and
lower cholesterol by keeping in con
tact with them during and after hos
pitalization — a fact which has led
researchers to name it "phone thera
py-"
By calling survivors about once
every month, nurses can actually
push them to reverse their previous
bad habits at a much lower cost than
conventional treatment and rehabili
tation programs, Deßusk said. The
estimated price tag per patient is less
than $1,000 per year.
In counseling the patients, nurses
not only speak with them about
their progress in decreasing their
risk of heart attack, but offer
encouragement and answer ques
tions about treatment and problems
the patients are experiencing,
Deßusk added.
The study also showed that the
new method is also more effective
than previous techniques of heart
attack prevention which usually rely

only on counseling while the patient
is still in the hospital. And this effec
tiveness is achieved with only, on
average, nine hours of counseling for
each patient during the year after
hospitalization.
For example, smokers who entered
the researchers' program were 17
percent more likely to have quit one
year after hospitalization, and those
in the study were also more likely to
have lower cholesterol levels.
This is partially because patients
who remain in contact with their
nurses are more likely to continue to
receive treatment, Deßusk said.
Patients in the study were 54 percent
more likely to get cholesterol-lower
ing drugs than those without coun

seling because nurses urged them to
take cholesterol tests.
Along with the cost savings, the
success of phone therapy is impor
tant because it mirrors the "kind of
program health reform advocates are
looking for," Deßusk said. In addi
tion to providing the service for a rel
atively low cost, patients are less like
ly to return to the hospital — lessen
ing the likelihood that the system will
have to "pay for that patient to be
hospitalized again."
According to Deßusk, the research
was conducted as a study of the way
patients are managed and, because of
its findings, seven of the Kaiser Per
manente medical centers are now
beginning to use the technique.
