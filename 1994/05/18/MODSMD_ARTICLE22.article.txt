When medical care is futile
Finding the point at which to call it quits is more dif
ficult for doctors than it is for professionals in other
fields because, in medicine, human lives are at stake.
But a study by Stanford and UC-San Francisco med
ical researchers has devised a method for determining
how well doctors recognize that a patient in intensive
care is unlikely to benefit from additional treatment.
Although life-saving procedures can often be per
formed in intensive-care units, there are also a number
of drawbacks which, according to Leslie Lenert, an assis
tant professor at the School of Medicine, can detract
from the usefulness of procedures.
These reasons can range from financial unfeasibility
to compassion for the patient â€” it might be undesirable
to undergo traumatic surgery, for example, when it will
most likely not improve the patient's chances of sur
vival. Sometimes people "die in the company of
machines" when in the intensive-care unit of hospitals,
Lenert said.
The researchers, who included Lenert, engineering
graduate student Jeffrey Belkora and Laura Esserman
from UC-San Francisco, looked at the records of about
400 patients who were admitted to the critical-care cen
ter at the Stanford Hospital. They found that about 11
percent of the patients who received intensive treatment
and were released from the hospital died within three
months.
Using these results, they were able to create a formu
la which identified 43 percent of the patients that would
die from a similar group.
Though the research is not intended to be used to

form medical opinions about particular patients, Lenert
said it might be used as an overall device for health-care
providers. In addition, it may aid in predicting outcomes
to "talk to the family members and get them ready for
tough times ahead," she said.
Researchers offer medical help
Often, people looking into the causes of ailments are
criticized for not implementing solutions.
But two groups, as part of their research into specific
medical problems, are offering a way for people to find
out both if they might be affected by conditions like skin
cancer and ways to avoid them.
Researchers at the School of Medicine plan to make
available such a service next Saturday, screening people
for disorders such as melanoma. And according to Susan
Swetter, Stanford's chief resident in dermatology, the
doctors will make recommendations of how people, wor
ried they might be at risk for skin cancer, should pro
ceed.
The screening, and many like it around the country,
was sparked by the more-than 4,000 people across the
country who have been alerted to their risk of develop
ing melanoma in programs like the one being scheduled
at the Medical School, Swetter said.
Another program, which is currently being carried
out by psychiatry Profs. Barr Taylor and Walton Roth,
allows people with intense fears of social situations to
seek help.
This research, also at the Medical School, will put
people into therapy groups in order to work through
their problems.
