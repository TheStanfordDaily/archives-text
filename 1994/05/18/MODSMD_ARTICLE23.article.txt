## Allowing blood to pass can be a pain in the head

Q: Why is it that I have a headache
this big?
— The Excedrin Commercial Guy
A: I don't know what you've been
doing that's giving you that
headache (except whining about
how it's got Excedrin written all over it)
but regardless of the cause, it's pretty
much the same thing that's causing the
actual pain.
When you have a headache, something
has caused the blood vessels in your skull
to widen, or dilate, allowing more blood to
flow through.
The body probably has a good reason
for doing this, but the problem is that
(hopefully) things are pretty tightly
packed in your skull. So as the blood ves
sels expand, they start pushing on other
things. This increased pressure is what
causes your head to hurt.
This also explains the "throbbing" of a
headache. As your heart beats, it sends
bursts of blood through your vessels; you
feel this when you check your pulse. If
your vessels are already dilated, each time
one of these surges goes through your
skull, it pounds on the area around it,
increasing the pain and increasing your
craving for relief.
Now, obviously your body isn't trying
to torture you for past sins or something
by giving you a headache. Usually, you get
a headache because the body is trying to
increase blood flow overall, and increased
blood flow in the skull is an annoying side
effect.
For example, when you are sick, your
immune system releases interleukins and
cytokines into the blood stream. Among
their effects is the dilation of blood vessels
throughout the body in hopes that this
will help fight the illness.
When this effect dilates the brain's
blood vessels as well, you get what you
perceive as your average Excedrin
strength headache.
When you are stressing, your body is
preparing for some kind of emergency, so
glucocorticoid hormones increase blood
flow so you can run away from whatever
the problem is.
However, if your problem is just an
upcoming final, you get a headache
instead of utilizing the increased blood
flow, but your body doesn't know this, so
you get the headache anyway.
Some people get headaches from eating
too much salt. When the amount of salt in
the blood increases, osmosis will drive
more water into the bloodstream to even
out the number of salt and water
molecules.

As a result, the blood volume increases
and causes the vessels to expand, and you
could be stuck with a brain- busting
headache.
Hangover headaches are a bit different.
Usually you have a layer of cerebrospinal
fluid that acts as a waterbed for the brain,
but if you've been drinking a bit too much,
your body gets dehydrated (another whole
story in itself).
When you wake up the next morning,
some of this fluid is gone, and the brain
doesn't have enough cushioning. This
suggests that coffee isn't a good cure for a
hangover; other than waking you up, the
caffeine will just dehydrate you more,
causing the headache to increase in inten
sity, if anything.
There are two main exceptions to this
explanation. Migraine headaches, besides
being much more intense, are also much
less understood. Currently, no one really
has much idea of what is going on when
you get a migraine, but it seems to be a
totally different process than simply the
dilation of blood vessels.
Then there is the infamous "ice-cream
headache," when you eat somethirg too
cold. There is a specific sensory nerve in
the back of the mouth (the ninth nerve,
for those of you who are neuroanatomists)
that detects foods that are excessively
cold, hot, spicy, etc.
When triggered, this nerve causes you
to have the sensation of a headache, as a
warning that something unusual is in
your mouth. Some unfortunate souls
actually suffer from a syndrome such that
all foods trigger this nerve, meaning that
anything they eat could give them a
headache.
So now that you know why you have a
headache, you want to know what to do
about it, right? Well, taking aspirin blocks
one of the steps in the prostaglandin path
way — the one that actually expands the
blood vessels.
If you choose something little, yellow,
different (like Nuprin or Advil, which con
tain ibuprofen), you are blocking a differ
ent step in the same process. This is also
why you take the same medicine for
sprains: this same pathway is involved in
swelling around an injury outside of the
brain.
Of course, it's better to try to treat the
cause of the headache than the headache
itself. In many cases, this means simply
getting rid of the stress that caused the
headache. So go ahead and let Calgon take
you away.
