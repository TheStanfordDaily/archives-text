# A 						howling crowd
## Bulldog fans provide key noise factor

ATHENS, Ga. — After his Texas
Lady Longhorns lost to Stanford in the
semifinals of the 1994 NCAA women's
tennis championships, head coach Jeff
Moore made a prediction about the
finals: "I definitely pick Stanford to
win. It won't be a contest unless the
crowd gets into it."
Perhaps Moore should write horo
scopes. Yesterday at the University of

Georgia, the crowd indeed got into its
home team's final match, thereby lift
ing the Lady Bulldogs to a 5-4 victory in
a contest all will long remember.
Much as it would have looked at
Stanford Tennis Stadium, the six sin
gles matches were played simultaneous
ly, with the top three matches played in
spacious Henry Field Stadium and the
remaining three played on the adjacent
grandstand courts.
Yet the setup in Athens differed in
two critical ways from what the Cardi
nal is used to. While Stanford's home
courts rarely fill to their maximum of
1,500 spectators, yesterday's courts
held a near capacity crowd of 3,117.

Moreover, the overwhelming majority
of these fans were Georgia boosters.
As the matches got underway, the
crowd showed signs of the factor it was
soon to become. Between points, scat
tered but ominous "woof-woof noises
could be heard coming from the mouths
of Bulldog fans.
As the day wore on, however, more
supporters piled in — most of them
Georgia students. In a stadium with
sections blocked off for individual fra
ternities, the atmosphere became decid
edly vocal and anti-Cardinal.
Katie Schlukebir silenced some of the
stadium fans with her convincing victo
ry over Michelle Anderson 6-2, 6-1.
Laxmi Poruri then did likewise, defeat
ing Angela Lettiere in the first singles
match.
"I like it when everybody is against
me," Poruri said. "The best way to shut
'em up is by winning."
Yet Schlukebir and Poruri's victory's
left Kristine Kurth as the only Cardinal
player remaining in the stadium. As
such, she was at the mercy of the Geor
gia fans. But at first many of them were
watching two neck-and-neck battles
playing out in the grandstand.
On courts five and six, the Cardinal
and the Lady Bulldogs split their two
matches, both ending within moments
of each other.
First, Bulldog Brooke Galardi tied up
the match score at 2-2 by fighting off
Wendy Sacks, 7-6 (7-5), 7-5. Seconds
later, however, Kim Shasby put the
Cardinal in the lead with a 5-7, 6-3, 6-1
victory over Anne Chauzu.
All eyes now turned to court two, and
a battle between Kurth and Stacy Shep
pard. The outcome of the victory would
determine whether Stanford would go
into singles with a 4-2 match lead —
thus needing just one victory to clinch
the title — or whether Georgia would

build momentum going into doubles by
tying the match score at three apiece.
At the time, Kurth led in the third
set, 4-1. Sheppard was serving, down 0-
30 in the game. Then things started to
turn around for Georgia. Sheppard
regrouped and held serve to make the
score 4-2.
After that game and for the remain
der of the match, the Bulldog fans con
tinuously chanted, "Go 'Dawgs, sick
'em. Woof-woof-woof-woof-woof. ..."
The crowd noise's effect on the play
ers was noticeable.
"The crowd really got behind me and
I fed off their energy," Sheppard said.
As for Kurth, she said she "tried as
hard as [she] could not to pay attention
to the crowd." Yet Kurth seemed to
have trouble blocking out the noise.
Tied at 4-4 and twice serving to go up 5-
4, Kurth first double-faulted at 40-30
and then hit into the net on her next
game point. At deuce, Kurth again dou
ble-faulted and was then passed as she
attacked the net off her last serve of the
game.
No doubt sensing its effect, the crowd
continued its frenzy. With Sheppard
serving for the match, Kurth rallied to
deuce, but could not get any further.
Sheppard closed out the match 7-6 (8-
6), 5-7, 6-4.
In doubles, the home court perhaps
played less of a role. For one thing, the
Stanford tandems were able lend each
other support on the court. And an offi
cial note from the umpires asking the
crowd not to disturb the players during
the points was read before the start of
doubles action.
Still, the home crowd's impact was
noticeable. After dropping the first set
6-1, the team of Beth Berris and Kurth
was tied at 5-5 with Tina Samara and
Sheppard.
After Berris made a line call that the

crowd at first didn't hear and then did
not like, Berris apparently felt obliged
to remind the crowd that this would
soon be the one match left on the court.
"I was angry about losing, possessed
to win, and annoyed with the crowd for
calling us cheaters," Berris said.
When the Bulldogs finally pulled off
the victory and were awarded their tro
phy, Georgia coach Jeff Wallace was
quick to thank all the supporters,
telling them they were "the greatest
tennis fans anywhere."
Stanford head coach Frank Brennan
was also impressed.
"The fans were great," Brennan said.
"It took a little bit of getting used to,

but it brings a lot of excitement to col
lege tennis."
Brennan even thought his team ben
efited from the vociferous crowd.
"I don't think anybody's going to
complain about a full set of bleachers
with 3,000 screaming people — even if
they're screaming against you." Bren
nan said.
"I was excited, the team was excited,
and I think, if anything, Ithe crowd)
helped our performance."
Interestingly, the last time a home
team won the National Championship
was in 1991, when the championships
were held at Stanford and the Cardinal
won its last of six consecutive titles.

soon be the one match left on the court.
"I was angry about losing, possessed
to win, and annoyed with the crowd for
calling us cheaters," Berris said.
When the Bulldogs finally pulled off
the victory and were awarded their tro
phy, Georgia coach Jeff Wallace was
quick to thank all the supporters,
telling them they were "the greatest
tennis fans anywhere."
Stanford head coach Frank Brennan
was also impressed.
"The fans were great," Brennan said.
"It took a little bit of getting used to,

but it brings a lot of excitement to col
lege tennis."
Brennan even thought his team ben
efited from the vociferous crowd.
"I don't think anybody's going to
complain about a full set of bleachers
with 3,000 screaming people — even if
they're screaming against you." Bren
nan said.
"I was excited, the team was excited,
and I think, if anything, Ithe crowd)
helped our performance."

team won the National Championship

were held at Stanford and the Cardinal
won its last of six consecutive titles.

Georgia, the crowd indeed got into its
home team's final match, thereby lift
ing the Lady Bulldogs to a 5-4 victory in
a contest all will long remember.
Much as it would have looked at
Stanford Tennis Stadium, the six sin
gles matches were played simultaneous
ly, with the top three matches played in
spacious Henry Field Stadium and the
remaining three played on the adjacent
grandstand courts.
Yet the setup in Athens differed in
two critical ways from what the Cardi
nal is used to. While Stanford's home
courts rarely fill to their maximum of
1,500 spectators, yesterday's courts
held a near capacity crowd of 3,117.

Moreover, the overwhelming majority
of these fans were Georgia boosters.
As the matches got underway, the
crowd showed signs of the factor it was
soon to become. Between points, scat
tered but ominous "woof-woof noises
could be heard coming from the mouths
of Bulldog fans.
As the day wore on, however, more
supporters piled in — most of them
Georgia students. In a stadium with
sections blocked off for individual fra
ternities, the atmosphere became decid
edly vocal and anti-Cardinal.
Katie Schlukebir silenced some of the
stadium fans with her convincing victo
ry over Michelle Anderson 6-2, 6-1.
Laxmi Poruri then did likewise, defeat
ing Angela Lettiere in the first singles
match.
"I like it when everybody is against
me," Poruri said. "The best way to shut
'em up is by winning."
Yet Schlukebir and Poruri's victory's
left Kristine Kurth as the only Cardinal
player remaining in the stadium. As
such, she was at the mercy of the Geor
gia fans. But at first many of them were
watching two neck-and-neck battles
playing out in the grandstand.
On courts five and six, the Cardinal
and the Lady Bulldogs split their two
matches, both ending within moments
of each other.
First, Bulldog Brooke Galardi tied up
the match score at 2-2 by fighting off
Wendy Sacks, 7-6 (7-5), 7-5. Seconds
later, however, Kim Shasby put the
Cardinal in the lead with a 5-7, 6-3, 6-1
victory over Anne Chauzu.
All eyes now turned to court two, and
a battle between Kurth and Stacy Shep
pard. The outcome of the victory would
determine whether Stanford would go
into singles with a 4-2 match lead —
thus needing just one victory to clinch
the title — or whether Georgia would

build momentum going into doubles by
tying the match score at three apiece.
At the time, Kurth led in the third
set, 4-1. Sheppard was serving, down 0-
30 in the game. Then things started to
turn around for Georgia. Sheppard
regrouped and held serve to make the
score 4-2.
After that game and for the remain
der of the match, the Bulldog fans con
tinuously chanted, "Go 'Dawgs, sick
'em. Woof-woof-woof-woof-woof. ..."
The crowd noise's effect on the play
ers was noticeable.
"The crowd really got behind me and
I fed off their energy," Sheppard said.
As for Kurth, she said she "tried as
hard as [she] could not to pay attention
to the crowd." Yet Kurth seemed to
have trouble blocking out the noise.
Tied at 4-4 and twice serving to go up 5-
4, Kurth first double-faulted at 40-30
and then hit into the net on her next
game point. At deuce, Kurth again dou
ble-faulted and was then passed as she
attacked the net off her last serve of the
game.
No doubt sensing its effect, the crowd
continued its frenzy. With Sheppard
serving for the match, Kurth rallied to
deuce, but could not get any further.
Sheppard closed out the match 7-6 (8-
6), 5-7, 6-4.
In doubles, the home court perhaps
played less of a role. For one thing, the
Stanford tandems were able lend each
other support on the court. And an offi
cial note from the umpires asking the
crowd not to disturb the players during
the points was read before the start of
doubles action.
Still, the home crowd's impact was
noticeable. After dropping the first set
6-1, the team of Beth Berris and Kurth
was tied at 5-5 with Tina Samara and
Sheppard.
After Berris made a line call that the

crowd at first didn't hear and then did
not like, Berris apparently felt obliged
to remind the crowd that this would
soon be the one match left on the court.
"I was angry about losing, possessed
to win, and annoyed with the crowd for
calling us cheaters," Berris said.
