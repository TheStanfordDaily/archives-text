# The 						four elements of Cardinal men's tennis
## 
### Mike Langford Senior staff writer 
Air. Earth. Fire. Water. The four ele
ments spoken of in ancient mythology
which are said to be the building blocks of
the universe. All veiy different, yet similar
in the power of their presence.
Patel. Cocotos. Devens. Flanagan. The
Stanford men's tennis team's four seniors
are diverse in their styles, yet have an
indelible similarity in that all have con
tributed mightily to Stanford tennis in
their four years on the Farm.
The variable but irresistible air of Vimal
Patel, whose limitless and untapped poten
tial become apparent in the way that he
matter-of-factly blows his opponents off
their feet.
The earthy consistency of Chris Cocotos,
who has quietly provided solid and depend
able leadership — not to mention wins on
the court — to a team that has at times
struggled to find initiative.
The competitive fire of Robert Devens,
who would probably rather sear out his
own eye than lose, and whose gritty never
say-die attitude usually smolders his oppo
nents into charcoal.
And the fluid versatility and adaptability
of Michael Flanagan, whose winning ways
have put him among the best players in the
nation, and among the legends of Stanford
tennis history.
"This is a special group of young men,"
said head coach Dick Gould, who recruited
the foursome, and has overseen their
progress over the past four years. "They're
different people, different individuals, all
committed to what they're doing."
"They've had their ups and downs, like
any family," added assistant head coach
John Whitlinger, who has also been instru
mental in the seniors' development. "But
like any family, they've stuck together."
Though these four seniors have main
tained a team mentality in an individual

sport, it is nevertheless impossible not to
recognize the individual styles that have
gone into the making of the team.

"Wherever Virnal plays, he can beat almost
anyone, and he leads the team in that way.
He goes out and beats the crap out of some
one. It's a boost to the team when he's the
first one off the court like that."
— Robert Devens
Consistently among the top five in the
nation in his age group, Patel began think
ing fairly early about his collegiate tennis
plans. Growing up in Kentucky, Patel had
the opportunity to see many top teams at
the National Team Indoors Tournament
held in Louisville. However, he knew from
the beginning he wanted to play at Stan
ford.
"I had been watching Stanford play for
10 years (before deciding on a college), and
I always wanted to go there," Patel said.
"Obviously for academics, and because the
Stanford tennis tradition is insane."
When Patel arrived, he played fourth
and fifth singles as a freshman, compiling a
20-6 record. However, Gould and
Whitlinger saw that Patel would need to
add variety to his game; Patel relied too
heavily on hard, penetrating ground
strokes.
And that improvement came. The next
two years Patel attained Ail-American sta
tus. His four-year record of 123-42 illus
trates his ability to blow away his oppo
nents.
Yet many see Patel's potential as even
more vast than his accomplishments would
suggest. Some inconsistency which still
lingers in his play may be whispering that
the best is yet to come.
"The development in his game has cre
ated a foundation to make a gigantic jump,"
Gould said. "And he has the tools to make
that jump. It could happen at any time."

"Chris is a quiet leader. He is the captain of
the team, but not in a 'rah rah' kind of way.
His demeanor and sportsmanship make
him one of the most respected players in col
lege tennis."
— Dick Gould
So strong was the recruiting class four
years ago that although Chris Cocotos
came in as the top recruit in the nation
after a No. 1 ranking in juniors, he did not
play much during his freshman year.
However, as a sophomore he shook the
college tennis world like an earthquake.
Cocotos compiled an incredible 22-6 dual
match record that year, mostly at third sin
gles, and won the NCAA doubles title with
teammate Alex O'Brien. The next season
he would also be named All-American,
reaching the doubles championship finals

with partner Flanagan.
"Chris is one of the best doubles players
I've ever had the privilege of coaching,"
Gould said. "And he plays his best at the
end of the year. He always does great at
NCAAs."
Cocotos' characteristic blooming at the
end of the season has become an interesting
phenomenon.
"At the beginning of the year, and even
though NCAAs are six months down the
road, it's always in the back of my mind,"
Cocotos said. "Then it's four months away,
then two. Sometimes I overlook the regular
season because I'm getting so geared up for
nationals."
Bobby D.
"Bobby is the fire of the team; he gets every
one psyched up. He's the guts of the team."
— Vimal Patel

Like Cocotos, Devens didn't play much
freshman year, despite a No. 11 ranking in
juniors. Playing in the middle of the lineup
his sophomore year, the New Yorker com
piled a respectable, if not spectacular, 17-10
record. But Devens' play jumped like a bel
lowed flame his junior year.
"Basically I came in as a baseliner who
didn't enjoy coming to the net," Devens
said. "But I learned that if I want to com
pete at this level, I have to serve and volley
and mix up my play. I have to have strategy
to break down my opponents."
Devens finished his junior year with a
No. 27 ranking in singles. But records and
rankings are not what Devens will be
remembered for.
"Bobby will be remembered for his
heart," Gould said. "He wants to beat you.
You can always depend on him doing his

best. He has no one punishing shot,
but he'll keep on grinding and grind
ing until he beats you."
Flanny
"Mike is not someone who is going to
give in. He goes out and believes that
he can beat anyone in the nation.
And he pretty much can."
— Robert Devens
When it came time for Michael
Flanagan — who was consistently
ranked in the top 10 in juniors — to
choose a college, he struggled with a
decision between Notre Dame and
Stanford. However, the much-bally
hooed combination of athletics and
academics finally convinced the Dal
las, Tex. resident to come west.
"I figured that my tennis would
improve more here, and that Stan
ford had a better tennis reputation,"
Flanagan said. "And I wanted to get
my degree from here if tennis didn't
work out."
But tennis has worked out
"unbelievably well" for Flanagan.
Playing mostly at sixth singles his
freshman year, Flanagan was thrust
into the second singles position his
sophomore year, and responded
with a 15-9 record at that spot. His
junior year, Flanagan made Ail-
American after playing every dual
match at first singles.
"Mike is one of the most adapt
able players on the team," Gould
said. "He continues to improve so
much ... it impresses me what he's
accomplished."
1992 and other memories
In 1991, Stanford failed to win the
NCAA Championship despite an
incredible lineup that included Alex

O'Brien, Jonathan Stark and Jared
Palmer. When sophomores Stark
and Palmer decided to turn profes
sional following that year, no one
gave Stanford any chance of vying
for the national title.
But no one told the Stanford
players they had no chance. So they
won it all.
All four of the seniors rank the
championship of that year among
their best memories of Stanford.
The coaches do so as well.
"That is the memory I'll have of
them," Whitlinger said. "Nobody
thought we'd win. Here we were
replacing Stark and Palmer with
Devens and Cocotos."
But win they did, beating UCLA
in the semifinals 5-1 — after losing
6-0 to them three weeks earlier —
and Notre Dame in the finals.
Other memories of their four
year careers include winning Indoors
this year and in '92 and beating
UCLA in Los Angeles this year. But
Devens described the time at Stan
ford as more than just memories.
"It's been something special to be
part of a program with 'winner'
written all over it," Devens said.
4 Fab five victory tour'
Talk of the seniors cannot go on
very long without one of the players
or coaches mentioning Billy Wright.
Although he has made his contribu
tions to the team more off the court
than on, Wright is nevertheless an
essential member of the senior class.
Together, the five seniors have
named this year the "fab five victory
tour," as a sort of last time around
for this special group of guys. But no
one expected them to do what
they've done this season.
"If you'd have told me at the
beginning of the year that we'd fin
ish 22-2, I'd have told you that you
were crazy," Gould said. "But
they're a gritty team, and they've

stayed focused."
While the team has had some ups
and downs over the years — the
players relate a lack of leadership on
last year's squad — the dedication to
the team and to winning has
remained true.
"We don't always get along,"
Patel said. "But with the match on
the line, we stick together well."
In order to win, the seniors have
found that when one of them is
down, others have to pick up the
slack. "That's one of the greatest
things — we never know who's
going to pull out the win for the
match," Cocotos said. "We've all
come to appreciate the group effort."
Four of the very top juniors in the
nation, who all grew up playing each
other in national tournaments. All
four choosing to come to the same
school. All four making leaps and
bounds in their play. All four con
tributing mightily to put their team
in a position to win a national cham
pionship every year.
In the seniors' collegiate tennis
careers, Stanford has gone an
incredible 88-15, while the foursome
compiled a 233-104 record in those
dual matches. The group's com
bined total in all singles matches is
an amazing 406-185. Yet such indi
vidual accomplishment has not been
the primary goal for the seniors.
"They put their egos aside, and
put what's best for the team ahead
of their own personal goals,"
Whitlinger said.
"I think that all the guys have
benefited from being at Stanford,"
said Gould, who is in his 28th year of
coaching. "It's been fun to watch
them develop."
And while all four plan to try the
professional circuit next year, there
is little doubt what their minds are
on right now.
"This year, we all feel that we
belong in the NCAAs," Devens said.

"The championship is definitely
within our reach. We all know that
we should be playing for it, and all
the seniors exude that.
"It's just a matter of putting it all
together."
Every match of the past four

years have been a matter of putting
the individual styles together. V
breezing through an opponent to get
the first point. Pooh providing rock
solid consistency and leadership,
quietly slow but steady. Bobby D.
perhaps yelling after an unbeliev

ably long rally to pull ofT a fiery
three-set victory. And Flanny, over
on court one, flowing from the net to
the baseline to frustrate yet another
opponent.
All individuals. All part of a team.
All winners.
