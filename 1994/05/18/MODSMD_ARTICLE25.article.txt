# The
						four elements of Cardinal men's tennis

Air. Earth. Fire. Water. The four ele
ments spoken of in ancient mythology
which are said to be the building blocks of
the universe. All veiy different, yet similar
in the power of their presence.
Patel. Cocotos. Devens. Flanagan. The
Stanford men's tennis team's four seniors
are diverse in their styles, yet have an
indelible similarity in that all have con
tributed mightily to Stanford tennis in
their four years on the Farm.
The variable but irresistible air of Vimal
Patel, whose limitless and untapped poten
tial become apparent in the way that he
matter-of-factly blows his opponents off
their feet.
The earthy consistency of Chris Cocotos,
who has quietly provided solid and depend
able leadership — not to mention wins on
the court — to a team that has at times
struggled to find initiative.
The competitive fire of Robert Devens,
who would probably rather sear out his
own eye than lose, and whose gritty never
say-die attitude usually smolders his oppo
nents into charcoal.
And the fluid versatility and adaptability
of Michael Flanagan, whose winning ways
have put him among the best players in the
nation, and among the legends of Stanford
tennis history.
"This is a special group of young men,"
said head coach Dick Gould, who recruited
the foursome, and has overseen their
progress over the past four years. "They're
different people, different individuals, all
committed to what they're doing."
"They've had their ups and downs, like
any family," added assistant head coach
John Whitlinger, who has also been instru
mental in the seniors' development. "But
like any family, they've stuck together."
Though these four seniors have main
tained a team mentality in an individual

sport, it is nevertheless impossible not to
recognize the individual styles that have
gone into the making of the team.

"Wherever Virnal plays, he can beat almost
anyone, and he leads the team in that way.
He goes out and beats the crap out of some
one. It's a boost to the team when he's the
first one off the court like that."
— Robert Devens
Consistently among the top five in the
nation in his age group, Patel began think
ing fairly early about his collegiate tennis
plans. Growing up in Kentucky, Patel had
the opportunity to see many top teams at
the National Team Indoors Tournament
held in Louisville. However, he knew from
the beginning he wanted to play at Stan
ford.
"I had been watching Stanford play for
10 years (before deciding on a college), and
I always wanted to go there," Patel said.
"Obviously for academics, and because the
Stanford tennis tradition is insane."
When Patel arrived, he played fourth
and fifth singles as a freshman, compiling a
20-6 record. However, Gould and
Whitlinger saw that Patel would need to
add variety to his game; Patel relied too
heavily on hard, penetrating ground
strokes.
And that improvement came. The next
two years Patel attained Ail-American sta
tus. His four-year record of 123-42 illus
trates his ability to blow away his oppo
nents.
Yet many see Patel's potential as even
more vast than his accomplishments would
suggest. Some inconsistency which still
lingers in his play may be whispering that
the best is yet to come.
"The development in his game has cre
ated a foundation to make a gigantic jump,"
Gould said. "And he has the tools to make
that jump. It could happen at any time."

"Chris is a quiet leader. He is the captain of
the team, but not in a 'rah rah' kind of way.
His demeanor and sportsmanship make
him one of the most respected players in col
lege tennis."
— Dick Gould
So strong was the recruiting class four
years ago that although Chris Cocotos
came in as the top recruit in the nation
after a No. 1 ranking in juniors, he did not
play much during his freshman year.
However, as a sophomore he shook the
college tennis world like an earthquake.
Cocotos compiled an incredible 22-6 dual
match record that year, mostly at third sin
gles, and won the NCAA doubles title with
teammate Alex O'Brien. The next season
he would also be named All-American,
reaching the doubles championship finals

with partner Flanagan.
"Chris is one of the best doubles players
I've ever had the privilege of coaching,"
Gould said. "And he plays his best at the
end of the year. He always does great at
NCAAs."
Cocotos' characteristic blooming at the
end of the season has become an interesting
phenomenon.
"At the beginning of the year, and even
though NCAAs are six months down the
road, it's always in the back of my mind,"
Cocotos said. "Then it's four months away,
then two. Sometimes I overlook the regular
season because I'm getting so geared up for
nationals."
Bobby D.
"Bobby is the fire of the team; he gets every
one psyched up. He's the guts of the team."
— Vimal Patel

Like Cocotos, Devens didn't play much
freshman year, despite a No. 11 ranking in
juniors. Playing in the middle of the lineup
his sophomore year, the New Yorker com
piled a respectable, if not spectacular, 17-10
record. But Devens' play jumped like a bel
lowed flame his junior year.
"Basically I came in as a baseliner who
didn't enjoy coming to the net," Devens
said. "But I learned that if I want to com
pete at this level, I have to serve and volley
and mix up my play. I have to have strategy
to break down my opponents."
Devens finished his junior year with a
No. 27 ranking in singles. But records and
rankings are not what Devens will be
remembered for.
"Bobby will be remembered for his
heart," Gould said. "He wants to beat you.
You can always depend on him doing his
