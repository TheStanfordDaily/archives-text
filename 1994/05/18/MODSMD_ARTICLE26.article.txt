# Team unity highlights men's rugby season
## 
### Brian Border Staff writer 
Looking back to the season's first
practice, it seemed that the Stanford
men's rugby squad, a team with a long
tradition of excellence, was headed for a
downfall.
"We were a little worried at the out
set because we didn't have the depth
and we didn't have the physical size,"
said senior Brian Brennan. "I remember
looking at the team and saying to
myself, if we go anywhere, it's going to
be a testament to our coaching and our
team dynamics."
Yet the Cardinal cast all doubts aside,
concluding the season with a second
place showing last month at the Pacific
Coast Playoffs, one of its top finishes in
the last 20 years.
"We exceeded everyone's expecta
tions," said senior flyhalf Eric Fleckten.
But the squad's end-of-the-season
accomplishments didn't come without a
struggle.
Early in the season, Stanford was

crushed 35-3 by Brigham Young in the
finals of the Tucson International
Rugby Tournament. St"eral gamps
later, the Cardinal suffered a humbling
34-17 defeat by Cal Poly-San Luis Obis
po, the same team which knocked off
Stanford in the first round of last year's
Pacific Coast Playoffs.
"It takes me a while to get them going
because each year we are starting over,"
said Cardinal coach Franck Boivert.
"Unlike other programs, most of our
players have never played rugby before.
Also, this year we were a really young
team."
When the playoffs came around,
however, it became readily apparent
that Stanford had benefited under the
tutelage of Boivert, who is also the coach
of the U.S. Women's National Team.
The No. 4-seeded Cardinal opened
the three-day Pacific Coast Playoffs in
convincing fashion over No. 5 UC-Santa
Barbara. Inspired by the play of junior
Jeff Freund, who scored two tries in the
match, the Stanford ruggers downed the
Gauchos 28-8.

"Jeff Freund was on fire thai game,"
Brennan said. "He led us quietly in that
game with his hustle."
The next day presented the Cardinal
with a golden opportunity for revenge as
it once squared oft against neme
sis Cal Poly in the playoff semifinals.
This time, Stanford finally ended up as
the victor, relying on excellent scrum
maging (similar to a face-off in hockey)
to maintain constant possession of the
ball and pull off a 22-3 victory.
"We had done OK against them in
the past in the scrum, but this game we
blew them off the ball," Brennan said.
Cardinal ruggers Emile Bruneau, Joe
Clayton, Terry Favazza and Fleckten
each scored one try, helping Stanford to
rout its opponent. Not only was the vic
tory significant in that it placed Stan
ford in the finals against Cal, but it also
marked the achievement of a long
awaited goal.
"That was probably the highlight of
my rugby career," said Fleckten, the
team's leading point scorer this season.
"We've had two of our worst losses

against Cal Poly. We not only beat them,
but we dominated them."
The Cardinal entered the match
against Cal with confidence, despite the
fact that it had not beaten the Bears in
over a decade, including a 28-0 loss in
this year's Big Game.
"We thought we had a chance," Bren
nan said. "We had to play our best, and
Cal had to make some mistakes."
While Stanford held things close in
the first half and trailed only 20-12 at
the intermission, the second half was a
different story. The dominant Cal
squad, which is the only rugby team on
the West Coast with Varsity status, blew
the game wide open and went on to win
57-19.
"We didn't play at their level physi
cally," Fleckten said. "They were bigger,
faster, stronger and fresher."
Still, Stanford refused to roll over,
and to the coach's delight, the squad
managed to score its first try of the year
against the Golden Bears in the final
