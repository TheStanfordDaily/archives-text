# Fuerbringer named men's volleyball All-American
## 
### Kathryn Yang Senior staff writer 
Two weeks ago the Stanford vol
leyball squad completed a near-per
fect season with a sweeping victory
over No. 3 Brigham Young for the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion Title.
A couple days later, the Cardi
nal's world came tumbling down
when the NCAA selection commit
tee chose No. 11 Indiana-Purdue
Fort Wayne over No. 2 Stanford to
fill the wildcard spot in the 1994
Final Four.
Although by no means a consola
tion for the Cardinal, three mem
bers of this year's young team were
named Ail-Americans a short while
after.
Redshirt freshman Matt Fuer
bringer hauled in the biggest Stan
ford honors of the season by gar
nering a first-team selection, while
teammates Canyon Ceman and
Mike Lambert finished on the sec
ond team.
Ironically, Fuerbringer, a 6-foot
-7 opposite hitter, earned only sec
ond team MPSF honors last month
— in addition to the MPSF Fresh
man of the Year award.
Nevertheless, the All-American
title was justified by a solid number
crunch. This year, the rookie shat
tered Stanford's single-season kill
record with 763 slams in 107 games
for a 7.131 average.
Although good for only a No. 2
showing nationwide, Fuerbringer
topped former Cardinal great Dave
Goss' 700-kill mark set two years
ago.
"Right now I'd say that Matt is a
front-runner for National Fresh
man of the Year," said head coach
Ruben Nieves. "He's had a tremen
dous season — just like we expect
ed."
Another pleasant surprise for
the Cardinal this year was the con
tribution of sophomore swing hit
ter Mike Lambert. Asked to assume
the passing duties on a young and

inexperienced team, Lambert
stepped up to the task and came out
looking like an All-American. Fin
ishing right behind Fuerbringer in
the offensive categories, the 6-foot
-6 native of Hawaii sprinkled 697
kills throughout the season, in
addition to improving his all
around volleyball skills.
"A lot of coaches came up to me
after the season and talked to me
about how Mike is the most com
plete and best player in volleyball,"
Nieves said.
None of that offense, however,
would be possible without the set
ting hands of senior Canyon
Ceman. Presently playing on the
professional beach volleyball cir
cuit, this former National Player of
the Year garnered his third All-
American title this season despite
working with an inexperienced
group of rookies and battling back
from an ofT-season injury.
Nevertheless, Nieves argues
that Ceman's performance, taken
in light of what he has had to over
come, is far more impressive than
either first-team selections Chip
McCaw or Lloyd Ball.
"I disagree with Canyon's place
ment on the second team," Nieves
said. "Canyon is as good, if not bet
ter than both those guys."
Indeed, in Stanford's two out
ings against Pepperdine, Ceman
outplayed McCaw on every occa
sion. In addition, the senior led his
team to a No. 2 ranking in overall
hitting percentage with a school
record-breaking 1,669 sets in the
regular season.
Fuerbringer recognized the
impressive skills of his teammates.
"I still think Canyon and Mike
should have been on the first
team," he said. "I still think they're
both better than I am."
Despite all these postseason
accolades, however, the Cardinal is
still smarting from the Final Four
