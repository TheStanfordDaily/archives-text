## Rules violations a sad trend for college football 
### 
As the violations in the Florida State foot
ball program continue to be disclosed,
these revelations are again a sad com
mentary on the state of college football today.
But let's face it: were these revelations shock
ing? No. Were they surprising? No.
So Florida State bought the college football

championship
last year. As if
the other
teams near the
top didn't. The
truth is that
most of the top
teams have
"arrange
ments" to
compensate

their players. Florida State, thanks to some
reporters at Sports Illustrated, just happened to
get caught.
The details are these: some agents provided
Florida State players with cash — no strings
attached — in the hopes of luring them to spe
cific sports management firms when it was time
for the players to go pro.
Among the revealed enticements was a no
holds-barred shopping spree at the Foot Locker
store in a Tallahassee mall. On that occasion,
the agents called ahead to have the store stay
open after hours so at least seven players could
outfit themselves with shoes, jackets, caps, and
apparel. The total tab for said excursion was
over $60,000.
Additionally, one of these "providers" would
simply loiter in the football dorm for days on
end, making sure all the players' needs were
met.
The players knew that these "gifts" violated
NCAA rules. But to them, the NCAA was a dis
tant organization that did not understand the
"needs" of today's college athlete. It's not
enough to get a full ride at school. These days,
more grease is needed on the skids.
"At Florida State, you work so hard to give to
the program and get nothing out of it," said cor
nerback Cory Sawyer, now a rookie with the
Cincinnati Bengals. "The most you can get out
of it is a trip to the NFL. I felt I was entitled to
money or clothing. Why couldn't I have it?"
The most you can get out of it is a trip to the
NFL. Have Sawyer and his cohorts forgotten
that this is college football? Not semi-pro or
minor-league football — even though in many
respects it functions that way — but college
football. Football played under the auspices of
an institution for higher learning. Implicit in
the idea of college football is that those who are
charged with playing it are students in college.
How about maybe "getting" a degree out of it?
Afler all, you have to spend four years of your
life there.
But who are we kidding? These guys aren't
taking classes. With courses like "elements of
football," "football conditioning" and "football
officiating," outside of practice and the weight
room, it's no wonder they're not "getting" any
thing.
At many campuses today, college football
players are exactly what Bill Walsh correctly
alluded to a year ago — "hired mercenaries" at
the University of Washington (which is right
fully on probation at present).
Going to school for these guys is a laughable
proposition. They don't go to get an education.
They have solely one purpose: to play ball.

Sawyer et. al. are not concerned
about course offerings. They want
to go to the place where playing
football will be made easiest: a free
flowing supply of spending money
on the weekends; having other stu
dents write their papers and take
their tests so they can remain eligi
ble to practice the only skill they

know on the football field.
For those who say that college
athletes should be paid, the
answer is that most of them
already are. The idealist would
point out that a college scholar
ship is payment enough. The
realist recognizes that under-the
table transactions are now part of
the game. They don't have to be,
but that is the risk involved — if
programs choose to violate the
rules, programs may be caught.
But more often than not, the

odds when breaking the rules iuo
in the violators' favor, and that is
why the rules are broken so regu
larly. The NCAA needs to beef up
enforcement but more important
ly, create a disincentive to cheat.
Something like a "three strikes,
you're out" proposal. For as it
stands right now, there exists a
disincentive not to cheat.
This year, Florida State's pro
gram came under the microscope.
Before Florida State, there was
Washington, and Nebraska, and

Oklahoma, and Miami. Who will
be next? Look atop the polls next
Jan. 1, and start investigating.
Meanwhile, don't worry about
Florida State. After a few years of
probation, things will go right back
to normal. And the players will
have the fancy cars and gold chains
to prove it.

David Schwartz, softball god,
promises not to tell the NCAA if you
take him on a late-night expedition
to Foot Ijocker.

officiating," outside of practice and the weight
room, it's no wonder they're not "getting" any
thing.
At many campuses today, college football
players are exactly what Bill Walsh correctly
alluded to a year ago — "hired mercenaries" at
the University of Washington (which is right
fully on probation at present).
Going to school for these guys is a laughable
proposition. They don't go to get an education.
They have solely one purpose: to play ball.

Sawyer et. al. are not concerned
about course offerings. They want
to go to the place where playing
football will be made easiest: a free
flowing supply of spending money
on the weekends; having other stu
dents write their papers and take
their tests so they can remain eligi
ble to practice the only skill they

know on the football field.
For those who say that college
athletes should be paid, the
answer is that most of them
already are. The idealist would
point out that a college scholar
ship is payment enough. The
realist recognizes that under-the
table transactions are now part of
the game. They don't have to be,
but that is the risk involved — if
programs choose to violate the
rules, programs may be caught.
But more often than not, the

odds when breaking the rules iuo
in the violators' favor, and that is
why the rules are broken so regu
larly. The NCAA needs to beef up
enforcement but more important
ly, create a disincentive to cheat.
Something like a "three strikes,
you're out" proposal. For as it
stands right now, there exists a
disincentive not to cheat.
This year, Florida State's pro
gram came under the microscope.
Before Florida State, there was
Washington, and Nebraska, and

Oklahoma, and Miami. Who will
be next? Look atop the polls next
Jan. 1, and start investigating.
Meanwhile, don't worry about
Florida State. After a few years of
probation, things will go right back
to normal. And the players will
have the fancy cars and gold chains
to prove it.

David Schwartz, softball god,
promises not to tell the NCAA if you
take him on a late-night expedition
to Foot Ijocker.
