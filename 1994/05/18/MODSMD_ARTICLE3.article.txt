Predicting
that ethnic stud
ies and the grad
ing policy will be
hot topics for
next year's Fac
ulty Senate,
newly-elected
Senate Chair
Robert Simoni
said he is both ex-

cited and nervous about accepting
the post for the 1994-95 session.
"I don't know what to expect,"

said Simoni, who currently chairs
the Biology Department. "I'm a
little apprehensive at the moment,
in light of last week's (Asian-
American Studies) protests, but
it's a tremendous honor and I'm
looking forward to it."
A member of this year's senate
steering committee, Simoni was
elected by a majority vote of the 55
members of next year's senate.
Simoni succeeds fellow Biology
Prof. Pat Jones, this year's senate
chair. Conveniently, Jones will
take over Simoni's job as chair of
