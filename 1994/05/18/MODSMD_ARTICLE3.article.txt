# Biology prof named '94-95 Fac Sen chair
## 
### Colleen Krueger Staff writer 
Predicting
that ethnic stud
ies and the grad
ing policy will be
hot topics for
next year's Fac
ulty Senate,
newly-elected
Senate Chair
Robert Simoni
said he is both ex-

cited and nervous about accepting
the post for the 1994-95 session.
"I don't know what to expect,"

said Simoni, who currently chairs
the Biology Department. "I'm a
little apprehensive at the moment,
in light of last week's (Asian-
American Studies) protests, but
it's a tremendous honor and I'm
looking forward to it."
A member of this year's senate
steering committee, Simoni was
elected by a majority vote of the 55
members of next year's senate.
Simoni succeeds fellow Biology
Prof. Pat Jones, this year's senate
chair. Conveniently, Jones will
take over Simoni's job as chair of


Simoni
the Biology Department in
September.
Jones called Simoni's election
"terrific."
"He will be an excellent chair,"
Jones said. "Having spent a num
ber of years on the senate, he's
very experienced and has been a
very active participant in many
senate discussions this year in
particular."
"As a colleague of mine in the
Biology Department, I also know
him to be very wise," she added.
Describing next year's senate
steering committee as a "pretty
activist group," Simoni predicted
that the committee will be a sig
nificant force in shaping the ses
sion. The committee also was
elected by next year's senate.
"With such an incredibly vocal
and active group, who knows
what will come up?" he said.
Next year's steering commit
tee consists of English Prof. John
Bender, Chemistry Prof. Steven
Boxer, Statistics Prof. Brad
Efron, Clinical Pharmacology
Prof. Phyllis Gardner, Political
Science Prof. Stephen Krasner
and Geological and Environmen

tal Sciences Prof. Gail Mahood.
The committee's Ex Officio
members are Provost Condoleezza
Rice and the new academic secre
tary, who has not yet been chosen.
"I can predict some issues I
think will characterize next
year's senate," Simoni said. "I
imagine that the ethnic studies
programs will certainly get some
senate discussion time, though I
don't know what to expect from
those discussions."

'With such an incredi
bly vocal and active
group, who knows

— Robert Simoni

The grading issue will also
warrant more senate time, as this
year's Committee on Academic
Appraisal and Achievement left a
whole list of ideas that still bear
looking into, Simoni said.
Lastly, Simoni said he thought
that the issues slated to be discussed
in this week's meeting, including the
amount of Stanford teaching done
by non-tenure line faculty, will come
up again next year.
