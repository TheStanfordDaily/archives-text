## Students hope to make UN conference 
### Elizabeth Murtaugh Staff writer 
Earlier this month, three Stan
ford undergraduates got a chance
to voice their perspectives as
young feminists at a regional con
ference held in preparation for the
upcoming Fourth United Nations
World Conference on Women in
Beijing, China.
Junior Sarah Horsely, junior
Esther Conrad and sophomore
Shama Blaney — all members of

the Women's Center Collective —
addressed problems such as chil
dren's perspectives on welfare is
sues, sexual discrimination in the
classroom, and how men Fit into
the realm of feminism.
Featuring discussions on "in
disputable progress in some areas
and backsliding in others," the
Beying conference — which will
be held in early September 1995 —
will draw thousands of men and
women from every corner of the
globe and will "assess how
women's lives have changed over
the past decade and take steps to
keep issues of concern to women
high on the international agen
da," according to a statement
about the conference.
"The thought that the views
I expressed [in Santa Monica]
might somehow be recognized
and addressed in Beijing is

really exciting to me," said
Horsley.
The regional conference, held
April 30 and May 1 in Santa Moni
ca, Calif., was one of several
preparatory conventions planned
nationwide to give women around
the country a chance "to convey
their individual concerns, priori
ties and strategies and to provide
detailed information about the
problems they face, and the suc
cesses and failures of their efforts
to improve the situation for
women," according to the state
ment.
Although their voices are only

three among thousands that will
ultimately contribute to the
issues that will be raised in '95,
Horsley, Conrad and Blaney
expressed excitement with their
involvement.
Discussing the "tremendous
emotional and intellectual
impact" attending the conference
had on her, Blaney said.
"It was a wonderful educa
tional opportunity to increase
the communication between col
lege and community.. . . College
should be about learning to
change the world. You're not
doing that when you're sitting in

class," she added.
Horsely, Conrad and Blaney
all said they plan to continue
their involvement in the prepara
tion that is taking place in antic
ipation of Beijing.
Although the UN convention
itself is open only to official dele
gates, the three are considering
another regional conference next
fall in San Francisco, and the
remote, yet — according to
Blaney — "totally viable" possi
bility of attending the Non-Gov
ernmental Organization Forum
immediately preceding the con
ference in Beijing.
