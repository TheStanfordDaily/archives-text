## University, Greek system to investigate 
### Burt Herman Editorial staff 
The seven varsity athletes arrested for
vandalizing the "Gay Liberation" sculpture
early Monday morning could now be facing
felony charges, in addition to investigations
by the University and the Greek Judicial
Board.
Junior Dusty Allen, junior Mark Butter
field, sophomore Robert Gardner, junior
Thomas Irwin, junior Todd La√üocca, fresh
man Brendan Sullivan and sophomore
Jason White were arrested for allegedly
damaging the four-person sculpture located
outside the northwest corner of the Quad.
Gardner, Butterfield, and White also will
be charged with resisting arrest for alleged
ly running from police.
If the damages to the statue exceed
$5,000, the alleged vandals would likely be
charged with a felony rather than a misde
meanor for the crime, according to Stanford
Police Sgt. John McMullen. The Santa
Clara County District Attorney will receive
the completed police report today.
An art conservator will be evaluating the
damage to the artwork over the next few
days, according to Stanford Museum Direc
tor Tom Seligman. But Seligman said he be
lieves that the damages will exceed $5,000.

Police found the figures covered with
black paint at about 2 a.m. Monday. A near
by wooden bench had also been forcibly
lodged between two of the figures.
A felony conviction for vandalism carries
sentences that could range from fines, resti
tution and community service up to jail
time, McMullen said. It would also count as
one strike under the new "three strikes and
you're out" law.
In order to repair the $150,000 sculp
ture, the figures will have to be removed
from their current location for several
weeks, Seligman said. The figures will then
be cleaned, sprayed and recoated. "We will
do it as quickly as we can," he said.
The University also will be investigating
whether the alleged vandalism can be seen
as a violation of the Fundamental Standard,
according to Judicial Affairs Officer Sally
Cole. She said she will be receiving a com
plaint regarding the alleged crime.
"There is long-standing precedent for
property damage to be viewed as a violation
of the Fundamental Standard," Cole said.
If the students are found to be in viola
tion of the Fundamental Standard, Vice
Provost for Student Affairs Mary Edmonds
will then determine what disciplinary ac
tions they would face, Cole said.
