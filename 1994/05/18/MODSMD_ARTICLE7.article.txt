# ASSU supports protest
## Endorses Asian-American Studies group's goals 
### Jim Luh Staff writer 
The newly elected ASSU Senate held its
final meeting of the year last night, receiv
ing words of wisdom from the departing
Council of Presidents and endorsing a reso
lution to allow Concerned Students for
Asian-American Studies to speak at tomor
row's Faculty Senate meeting.
The 1993-94 COP members gave a
farewell address to the senate and the new
COP, offering examples from their year's
worth of experience in student government
as a lesson to next year's student leaders.
Expressing a fundamental belief that
"Stanford students are not apathetic" and
could be motivated to action with effective
leadership, COP member Ying-Ying Goh is
sued a challenge to next year's student gov
ernment to not only make attempts to
gauge student opinion but also to shape that
opinion into action.
This can be achieved, said COP member
Jason Snyder, by buildingcoalitions involv
ing student leaders, the faculty and the ad
ministration. "The ASSU ... needs to enable
its own constituency to better serve itself,"

Snyder said.
COP member Ron Brown recounted exam
ples of how the COP has fulfilled its promises
to increase student representation, improve
student services, and boost communication
between student government and the student
body as a whole.

Finally, COP member
Delia Lopez praised the
new student government
for getting off to "a great
start" and expressed a be
lief that the COP's work
this year has helped
reestablish the executive
office, which was junked
by voters for 1992-93.
In later business, the
senate voted to elect un-

dergraduate senator Michael Choo as next
year's deputy senate chair. Also seeking the
office was undergraduate senator Smeeta
Ramarathnam.
Both candidates offered a view of the of
fice of deputy chair as more than just an oc
casional substitute for the senate chair.


Brown
"We want the deputy senate
chair to become a real job," Rama
rathnam said.
"I would like the deputy chair
to provide leadership for the sen
ate to become more of a task-ori
ented body, rather than one of
pure discussion," Choo said.
The senate also passed a resolu
tion requesting the steering commit

tee of the Facuity Senate to allow the
Concerned Students for Asian-
American Studies to speak at tomor
row's Faculty Senate meeting.
The measure initially met with
some opposition, as several sena
tors raised objections that passing
the resolution might be construed
as ASSU approval of the disrup
tion of Thursday's Faculty Senate
meeting by the student group.
Other senators were concerned
that the resolution might make it
appear that the ASSU supported
the group's political objectives.

But co-author Phillip Lin said
the bill was simply a request that
the students be heard, not an
endorsement of the organization
or its message.
"Basically, the protest's goal
was to extract some kind of guar
antee that students were going to
be heard" at the May 19 meeting,
Lin said. "Since the Faculty Sen
ate chair, Prof, fPatricia] Jones,
decided to adjourn the meeting
last week, these students have
brought to my attention that the
only way they could appear was

through a senate resolution."
Lin added that the group
would simply offer information to
the Faculty Senate concerning the
"long struggle" for Asian-Ameri
can Studies at Stanford.
In other business, the senate
selected undergraduate senator
Steve Russell as summer senate
chair. The senate does not hold
any regular meetings over the
summer, but a substitute senate
chair is appointed for the summer
in case a matter should arise that
requires senate attention.
