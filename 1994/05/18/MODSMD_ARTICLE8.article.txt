## Women's tennis team loses to Georgia by one match in NCAA team finals 
### Rob Ross Senior staff writer 
ATHENS, Ga. — Different year,
different court, different opponent,
same result.
The Stanford women's tennis
team lost to Georgia yesterday in
the finals of the NCAA Women's
Tennis Championship 5-4 at the
Magill Tennis Complex at the Uni
versity of Georgia. This finish near
ly duplicated last year's finals loss to
the University of Texas, as both
matches were tied at 3-3 going into
the doubles stanza.
The Lady Bulldogs (27-2)
claimed their first-ever Women's
Tennis Championship by garnering
another first — a victory over the
Cardinal (23-3). Going into yester
day's match Georgia was 0-6 against
coach Frank Brennan's squads,
with one of these losses coming in
the 1987 NCAA Finals. The Cardi
nal has now played inloofl3N C AA
Finals, winning eight. This was the
Bulldogs' second finals appearance.
"This is the greatest day in the
history of Georgia women's tennis,"
said Georgia head coach Jeff Wal
lace.
Yesterday was also one of the

greatest days in the history of the
Women's Finals, or at least
the most competitive. Three of the
six singles matches went into three
sets, and of the 21 total sets played
between these two squads, 13 were
decided by two games or less.
"That was one of the best, if not
the best, college matches I've ever
seen," Brennan said.
Georgia, which advanced to the
finals by virtue of a 5-2 defeat of No.
4 seed California Monday, was fa
vored as the second seed behind
Texas. But Stanford had the mo
mentum, after defeating the Lady
Longhorns 5-2 in the semifinals.
The two teams had not met this sea
son, so most viewed this showdown
as a toss-up, either team capable of
taking home the trophy.
But for the Bulldogs, the trip was
just a short walk behind the stadi
um, and that home court advantage
was a key factor in several crucial
matches. The gathering of about
3,117 screamed, yelled and ctyoled
their beloved 'Dawgs through sever
al key points to victory.
"The crowd definitely helped.
They pulled us through," said Gieor
