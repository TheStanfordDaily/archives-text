## Women's tennis team loses to Georgia by one match in NCAA team finals 
### Rob Ross Senior staff writer 
ATHENS, Ga. — Different year,
different court, different opponent,
same result.
The Stanford women's tennis
team lost to Georgia yesterday in
the finals of the NCAA Women's
Tennis Championship 5-4 at the
Magill Tennis Complex at the Uni
versity of Georgia. This finish near
ly duplicated last year's finals loss to
the University of Texas, as both
matches were tied at 3-3 going into
the doubles stanza.
The Lady Bulldogs (27-2)
claimed their first-ever Women's
Tennis Championship by garnering
another first — a victory over the
Cardinal (23-3). Going into yester
day's match Georgia was 0-6 against
coach Frank Brennan's squads,
with one of these losses coming in
the 1987 NCAA Finals. The Cardi
nal has now played inloofl3N C AA
Finals, winning eight. This was the
Bulldogs' second finals appearance.
"This is the greatest day in the
history of Georgia women's tennis,"
said Georgia head coach Jeff Wal
lace.
Yesterday was also one of the

greatest days in the history of the
Women's Finals, or at least
the most competitive. Three of the
six singles matches went into three
sets, and of the 21 total sets played
between these two squads, 13 were
decided by two games or less.
"That was one of the best, if not
the best, college matches I've ever
seen," Brennan said.
Georgia, which advanced to the
finals by virtue of a 5-2 defeat of No.
4 seed California Monday, was fa
vored as the second seed behind
Texas. But Stanford had the mo
mentum, after defeating the Lady
Longhorns 5-2 in the semifinals.
The two teams had not met this sea
son, so most viewed this showdown
as a toss-up, either team capable of
taking home the trophy.
But for the Bulldogs, the trip was
just a short walk behind the stadi
um, and that home court advantage
was a key factor in several crucial
matches. The gathering of about
3,117 screamed, yelled and ctyoled
their beloved 'Dawgs through sever
al key points to victory.
"The crowd definitely helped.
They pulled us through," said Gieor

gia's top player, Angela Lettiere.
"Many of my teammates fed off of
it."
The match itself proved one
point — momentum is a tenuous
thing. Advantage swung from one
of the teams dressed in red and
white to the other, with neither
squad able to take control until late
into doubles play.
Cardinal freshman Katie
Schlukebir strutted off the court
first, as she destroyed the higher
ranked Michelle Anderson 6-2, 6-1.
Blasting groundstrokes at sharp

angles from both wings, the Kala
mazoo, Mich, native once again
looked like a world-beater, as she
ran her NCAA tournament record
to an impressive 4-0 going into the
individual tournament.
"I crushed her, but I really didn't
play that well," Schlukebir said.
"She was really tight and made a lot
of errors."
The uncompetitive match did lit
tle to raise Cardinal spirits, though,
as other Stanford players found
themselves in trouble. Every one of
Schlukebir's teammates dropped
the first set in their singles match
es, some almost implausibly. On

court five, Cardinal sophomore
Kim Shasby took an early £ 3 lwd
over her opposing No. 5 sing>os
player, Georgia's Anne Chauzu,
only to watch it evaporate just as
quickly. Shasby fell 7-5.
But the comeback kid of the
finals was Bulldog Brooke Galardi.
At No. 6 singles Galardi started
cold, falling behind 5-1 to Stan
ford's Wendy Sacks. But Sacks,
who was taking the place of the
injured Beth Berris in the singles
ladder, could not shut the door.
Galardi, who said, "I just decided
not to lose," didn't. She stormed
back into the match and, riding a
wave of cheers, yanked a 7-6 (7-5)
first-set victory out of the fire.
The Cardinal stalwarts were fad
ing as well. Senior Kristine Kurth
lost set one 7-6 (8-6) to Stacy Shep
pard. Sandra De Silva, fresh off her
first loss of the season on Sunday,
forced a tiebreaker after being
down 3-0, but still fell to lelt-hand
ed slicer Tina Samara.
Even Cardinal captain Laxmi
Poruri, the second-ranked player in
the nation, was unable to stop the
third-ranked Le f+ 'ere from a three
game streak for * 6-4 victory in the
first set of the No. 1 singles match.
Things did not look good for the vis
itors, despite their 1-0 lead
But the Stanford veterans began
to turn things around. Even as
freshman De Sil-'a dug herself into
a 5-1 hole, the more experienced
Cardinal players controlled the sec
ond set. Peppering Lettiere's fore
hand, Poruri shot to a 4-1 crowd
quieting advantage. Kurth matched
this performance with a quick 4-2
ride ahead of the suddenly inconsis
tent Sheppard. And Shasby took
control of court five, guiding play to
a 6-3 Stanford second-set victoiy.
Right next door to Shasby, Sacks
matched Galardi groundstroke for
groundstroke and game for game,
as neither would fade. Both had
seemingly decided not to lose.
Back on court four, De Silva was
running out of gas. She made a late
run to climb back to within one
game, but couldn't pace Galardi's
first-set performance. De Silva lost
the second set to Samara 6-4, thus
tying the match score at 1-1.
"We're still trying to figure out
Sandra," Brennan said of his fresh
man who went undefeated in the
regular season at No. 6 but 1-3 in
the NCAA tournament at No. 4.
"She doesn't have much margin in
her shots, so she can either have
great days or bad days."
Just as the crowd was reacting to
Georgia's win, Poruri con
tributed the Bulldogs' second loss.
The veteran never looked back after
giving up ner lirst-set, and method
ically dismissed Lettiere 4-6, 6-2, 6-
3. Although non-demonstrative

during the match, as Poruri went to
shake hands with the vanquished
Lettiere, she pounded the net with
her racquet and screamed, "Let's go
Card!"
And the Card did, at least at No.
5 singles as Shasby had completely
figured out Chauzu. The sopho
more took the second set 6-3, then
the third 6-1. But classmate Sacks
could not figure out Galardi on the
big points, consequently losing the
match 7-6, 7-5.
So with Stanford ahead 3-2,
3,117 pairs of eyes turned to court
two, where Kurth, after winning
the second set 7-5.. held a comfort
able 4-1 advantage. But her lead
would not prove comfortable
enough.
"I was very disappointed [being
down 4-I], but on the switch the
crowd really got behind me," Shep
pard said.
This combination of a roaring
crowd, a sharp-hitting Sheppard
and a tight Kurth produced a disas
trous Stanford defeat.
"I played pretty tentatively,"
Kurth said. "I was hoping she

would miss."
Stanford was then faced with
the task of winning at least two of
three doubles matches against the
strongest doubles teams in the
country. Georgia's top two duos are
both ranked in the nation's top 10,
with the 'Dawgs No. 1 squad of Let
tiere-Anderson occupying the high
est spot.
"We've talked all year about how
maybe even a national title will
come down to doubles," Wallace
said. "We talked about it in the first
week of practice and it did."
Number three doubles took the
court first, and Shasby-Emily Burt
nabbed a 6-4 first-set victory over
Chauzu-Lisa Salvatierra. At No. 1
doubles, the third-ranked team of
Poruri-Schlukebir found early suc
cess, but soon watched a 2-0 advan
tage disintegrate into a 3-5 deficit.
Down 4-5, the Stanford duo had
five break points but could not con
vert, as Lettiere-Anderson held
strong and won 6-4. At No. 2 dou
bles the ninth-ranked team of
Samara-Sheppard blazed through
Beth Berris-Kurth 6-1.

Shasby-Burt nailed the next set
of their No. 3 doubles set 6-2, to give
Stanford its last edge at 4-3. No. 1
Stanford's top duo fell behind 0-2 in
the second set but blared back to 5-
4 after a Schlukebir overhead.
But the next game was a big one,
and the Bulldogs owned the big
games all day. On Lettiere's sewe
Georgia held to tie at 5-5, then
broke Poruri and held with Ander
son to win three straight games and
the match 7-5.
The Cardinal has its last chance
on court two, where Kurth-Berris
knotted the second set at 5-5. But
that 10th game of the second set
was the last contest this year's
Stanford women's tennis team
would win, as Samara-Sheppard
assured Georgia fans of a victory
with a two-game win streak.
During the trophy presentation,
Brennan spoke to the crowd, say
ing, "Our girls played tough but you
certainly deserved the trophy today.
Congratulations!"
But the electronic scoreboard
summed the match up better.
"How bout them 'Dawgs!"
