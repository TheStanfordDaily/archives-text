author of
The Unquiet Ghost:
Russians Remember Stalin
Published by Viking
In this book, the Russian-speaking Hochschild relates his six-month journey through the for
mer gulags and long-suppressed archives, his encounters with those who survived the Great Terror
and the children of the twenty million who did not, and the impact the dictator who died in 1953 still
has on the Russian psyche.
"...a riveting and eloquent evocation of a country still haunted by the ghost of Stalin...Many of
Hochschild's subjects open up to him with the intensity of patients confessing long-repressed secrets
to a therapist...As sensitive, subtle, and moving as Chekhov: journalism raised to the level of art."
—Kirkus Reviews (starred review}
"A book that adds greatly to our grasp of the dreadful phenomena of Stalinism—and even
gives the interrogation records of American citizens caught in the terror machine."
—Robert Conquest, author of The Great Terror
Adam Hochschild also wrote Half the Way Home: A Memoir of Father and Son and The
Mirror at Midnight: A South African Journey.
