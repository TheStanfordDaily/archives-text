# Students get senate invite
## Asian-American Studies supporters to speak at today's Fac Sen meeting 
### Sarah Katz Editorial staff 
After taking the Faculty Senate meeting by storm
last week, members of the Concerned Students for
Asian-American Studies have been invited to today's
meeting to offer a 10-minute explanation of their
cause.
The group was placed on the meeting's agenda
yesterday after it presented a 700-signature petition
to the senate's steering committee. Senate rules call
for the consideration of any resolution that has been
signed by more than 500 people.
Senate members said the group's placement on
this week's agenda was not a result of its actions last
week, when a number of students entered the meet
ing through a previously locked door and later dis
rupted the meeting by speaking out illegally, forcing
the senate to adjourn after only 20 minutes.
"Normally, we'd have put them on for next week,
but [the schedule] was too full," said Communication
Prof. Marion Lewenstein, the University's academic
secretary. "This was the only time [before the end of
the year] that we could fit them in."
In addition, the steering committee considered a
request from the ASSU Senate which supported the
students' right to speak to the Faculty Senate, said
Biology Prof. Pat Jones, the senate chair.
The group will present a resolution calling for the
implementation of an Asian-American Studies pro
gram at the end of today's meeting, leaving no time
for official discussion, Jones said, adding that she
would encourage senators to approach the group
members with questions after the meeting.
The presentation will mainly give "a history of
Asian-American Studies at Stanford and the intellec
tual rationale for why we should have it," said gradu
ate student Davina Chen, a member of the group.
Despite the short time allotted for the presenta
tion, students said their goal is mainly to educate the
senate about the importance of their cause.
"Speaking to members of the Faculty Senate, it
seems that they don't know what Asian-American
Studies is," Chen said. "When it comes before them
again, they'll know what it is."
The group's aim is not to
implement an Asian-American
Studies program right away, but
to insure that the issue receives
serious consideration, said gradu
ate student Karen Ho, who —
along with sophomore Jerry
Chen — will speak at today's
meeting.
"We can't call for a committee

to implement a new major with
out consideration," Ho said.
"We're calling for the Faculty
Senate to support any kind of
Humanities and Sciences com
mittee."
Specifically, Ho said the stu
dents are trying to direct serious
attention to the May 27 meeting
scheduled by Dean of Humanities
and Sciences John Shoven. The
meeting has been called to dis
cuss the formation of a commit
tee to look at implementing an
Asian-American Studies pro
gram.

"We want a committee to look
into things, but we want [its]
report to be tangible, to have
action come out of it," Ho said,
adding that the group did not
want Shoven's meeting to simply
be an airing of grievances.
Jones said she does not antici
pate a repetition of the type of
disruption that broke up last
week's meeting. "One student
assured me that they will be con
cise and professional," she said.
"I hope there will be no disrup
tions — it's in everyone's best
interests."
