# Students get senate invite
## Asian-American Studies supporters to speak at today's Fac Sen meeting 
### Sarah Katz Editorial staff 
After taking the Faculty Senate meeting by storm
last week, members of the Concerned Students for
Asian-American Studies have been invited to today's
meeting to offer a 10-minute explanation of their
cause.
The group was placed on the meeting's agenda
yesterday after it presented a 700-signature petition

The group will present a resolution calling for the
implementation of an Asian-American Studies pro

for official discussion, Jones said, adding that she
would encourage senators to approach the group
members with questions after the meeting.

Asian-American Studies at Stanford and the intellec

ate student Davina Chen, a member of the group.
Despite the short time allotted for the presenta

senate about the importance of their cause.

Studies is," Chen said. "When it comes before them
