# Coming together to share faiths
## Celebration of Human Spirit set for tonight in the Quad 
### Jamie Taylor Staff writer 
Students representing at least a half dozen
faiths will explore their common links by chant
ing, dancing and speaking tonight in the Inner
Quad during The Celebration of the Human Spir
it rally.
Organizers of the 7:30 p.m. rally — the first of
its kind at Stanford — hope to bring together dif
ferent religious organizations on campus "to
share with the Stanford community the things in
each of our religious traditions that inspire us,"
said graduate student Hamid Samandari, one of
the rally's student coordinators.
"We want to provide a forum for an expression
of spirituality without getting tied down in
dogma," said graduate student Eric Stout, anoth
er rally coordinator. He added that the rally
would allow different faiths on campus to exam
ine their common threads.
The rally will begin with singing by the a cap
pella group Talisman, and will continue by alter
nating readings and music from various campus
religious organizations. There will be a short
speech after the rally to explain the meaning of
each group's contribution, and Harold Breno
Brown, a professional saxophonist, will perform
two songs.

The celebration differs from past forums
regarding religious diversity because "its not a
panel where people try to present each idea of
their own," said Samandari. "The idea is to pre
sent what is beautiful about each religion.
Stout added that "it's not a celebration of
deities. It has to do with all of our yearning for
deeper meaning in our own lives that has been
lacking for a while and is now on the rise."
Diana Akiyama, an associate dean of Memorial
Church, said the celebration will bring the cam
pus together spiritually. "It is an event that may
spark one's interest in spirituality or might nur
ture one's own existing spirituality," said Akiya
ma.
Akiyama added that this event is positive for
Stanford because it will bring to the forefront the
religious diversity on campus.
The idea to develop an interfaith celebration
began about two months ago among a group of
about 10 students, who wrote every religious
groups on campus for input on the rally.
The religious groups involved include the
Baha'i Association, the Catholic Community and
Sanskriti, an Indian cultural organization. How
ever, "it's really been a collective effort," said
Samandari. "We don't want to make any special
advertisements for any group. We want to pro
mote a spirit of togetherness."
