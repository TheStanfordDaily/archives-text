Malawi ruler ousted?
BLANTYRE, Malawi (AP) — People
beheaded black roosters and drivers tooted
horns yesterday to celebrate early vote
returns that showed Africa's
ing dictator heading for defeat in Malawi's
first multiparty election.
President Kamuzu Banda, who has
ruled since independence from Britain in
1964, was far behind a former ally, Bakili
Muluzi. Labor leader Chakufwa Chihana,
a one-time political prisoner, was slightly
ahead of Banda.
Cars with horns blaring cruised the
streets of Blantyre, the commercial capital
of this southeast African nation. Small
groups of Muluzi's supporters danced joy
ously holding headless black roosters —
the symbol of Banda's ruling party — to
signify its downfall.
A source at state-run Malawi Broadcast
ing Corp., which stopped reporting results,
said the latest unofficial returns gave
Muluzi about 900,000 votes. Chihana had
400,000 and Banda 350,000, said the
source, who spoke on condition of anonymi
ty. Official results are expected today.
About 3.7 million people were eligible to

vote in the election, which was forced by
growing domestic unrest and pressure
from Western aid donors.
FDA OKs genetic tomato
WASHINGTON (AP) - The govern
ment gave its approval yesterday for the
first time to the marketing of a genetically
altered food — a tomato that will stay ripe
longer.
The tomato is called Flavr-Savr by its
developer, Calgene Inc., of Davis, Calif.
The company said the tomato will be in
grocery stores of the Western and Mid
western states within 10 days.
The tomato, said the Food and Drug
Administration "is as safe as tomatoes
bred by conventional means."
It was the first time the agency evaluat
ed a whole food produced by biotechnology,
although it gave approval in 1990 to a food
product, chymosin — a milk-clotting agent
used in making cheese.
The tomato's genetic changes will enable
the grower to "allow it to ripen on the vine
longer, let it get redder and more flavorful
and still have time to ship it longdistance,"
said Ijaura Tarantino, an FDA scientist.
