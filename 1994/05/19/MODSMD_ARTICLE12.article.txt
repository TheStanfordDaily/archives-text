## Legal questioning raises eyebrows Clinton, facing harassment suit, asks Justice Dept. if he can be sued 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Heeding a
White House request, the Justice Depart
ment is studying a question at the core of
President Clinton's sexual harassment
case: Can he be sued over something that
occurred before he was president?
Whatever the conclusion, legal schol
ars and ethics experts said yesterday the
White House has ventured in uncharted
and murky water by getting government
lawyers so involved in the president's
defense.
"Clinton is going to benefit from the
work of the Justice Department and
thereby save some of the costs," said
Stephen Gillers, professor of legal ethics
at New York University Law School.
"Nevertheless, I think it is entirely
appropriate to ask the department to do
that work," he said. "It concerns the
immunity of a sitting president, whoever
he happens to be."
Other legal minds agreed that Justice
needs to answer the question for the sake
of future presidents, even it helps the cur
rent president settle a private matter. "I
think it's a legitimate expense of govern
ment," said Yale Law School professor
Geoffrey Hazard.

But involving Justice lawyers in Clin
ton's personal legal defense could cause
him political problems.
Bill Kristol, head of the Project for a
Republican Future and the former chief
of staff for Vice President Dan Quayle,
said the Justice review is legally appropri
ate and necessary. "Politically, I would
say, though, that it will be hard for liber
als who have said for years, over and over,
that the president is not above the law to
now maintain a position that the presi
dent is above the law," he said.
White House counsel Lloyd Cutler has
asked the Justice Department to study
whether a sitting president can be sued
over activities that allegedly took place
before he took office.
Paula Jones, a former Arkansas state
employee, alleges that Clinton made a
sexual advance when he was governor of
Arkansas. The president's private attor
ney, Robert Bennett, has indicated he will
try to block the lawsuit by arguing that a
president should not be distracted while
in office by private legal action.
The issue is not whether Paula Jones
can sue; it is when can she sue. Must she
wait until Clinton leaves office?

Administration officials insisted the
request to Justice was not a conflict of
interest, even though Justice may be — in
effect — doing legal legwork for Clinton's
private attorney.
"This is done in connection with the
institutional role of the president and the
needs and the history of the office,"
department spokesman Carl Stern said.
"The White House did not ask the Justice
Department to do personal lawyering for
BUI Clinton."
White House Press Secretary Dee Dee
Myers said the information would be
made available to Bennett and the public.
"Why would they keep it secret?" she said.
However, she later backed off the
statement, telling reporters, "It's prema
ture to say. The request has gone to the
Justice Department and they're looking
into the issue."
Myers said the review is appropriate
because Clinton is being sued as presi
dent, even though the allegation is older
than his presidency.
"He is the president of the United
States. Everything that happens to him
affects his capacity as president of United
States, regardless," she said.
