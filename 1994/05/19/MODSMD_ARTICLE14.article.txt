## Editorial The 						Stanford seven Defacing of gay statues should be condemned, athletes must pay price 
### 
VANDALISM IS always an
act that leaves a black mark
on the University.
But the vandalism of the "Gay
Liberation" sculpture early Mon
day morning also points toward an
unacceptable bigotry.
When seven varsity athletes
were arrested for allegedly vandal
izing the statues on the west side
of campus, they denied any anti
gay motivation for the alleged van
dalism. Whether or not prejudice
was behind their actions remains
to be seen — but their targeting of
the sculpture gives the appearance
of a hate crime, and even an
appearance of that kind cannot be
tolerated.
Four members of the Cardinal
baseball team, two football players
and one wrestler were charged
with vandalizing the statue. Three
will be charged with resisting
arrest for allegedly running from
police once they were stopped.
The athletes' actions are irre
sponsible and morally indefensible
by any standard.
As athletes, these seven repre
sent Stanford on the field and are
supposed to carry the Cardinal
banner with pride. Only now we
can have no pride in them. The
athletes have set a horrible exam
ple for everyone, from students
who root for them to small chil
dren who might see them as
heroes.
The black paint they poured
over the figures has put a black
stain on all of Stanford. And it
shows that this institution still has
a long way to go if it's going to
completely expunge homophobia
from campus.
The athletes' sheepish explana
tions are nothing but lame and
unconvincing. According to

Thomas Irwin, the wrestler who
allegedly participated in the
defacement, "It was a spontaneous
deal — it just kind of happened."
Admitting that they "pretty much
screwed up" is not enough to
repair the damage that has already
been done.
All sorts of excuses justifying
the athletes' behavior will be
bandied around in the next few
days. Some of them have already
been voiced by Stanford wrestling
coach Chris Horpel in a San Jose
Mercury News article yesterday.
"Stanford students are almost
force-fed political correctness," he
said. "I don't think people feel too
strongly about any of these
issues."
The response to Horpel's
myopic comments is simple: if
these athletes feel restricted at a
place which gives everyone, gay or
straight, the freedom of expres
sion, then they shouldn't be at
Stanford.
Should the athletes be let off the
hook because they were drunk and
got a little carried away? No. Say
ing the athletes' action was a
dumb, drunken caper does nothing
to address the harm their actions
have caused and may cause in the
future.
Though it would be easier to
minimize the significance of this
incident, that is not the way for
Stanford to ensure this type of
fiasco never happens again. The
athletes should be prosecuted, and
additional University judicial
action should be taken.
Some coaches have already
come forward to say the athletes
will be penalized, though it has not
been specified what that penalty
will be. The coaches and the Uni
versity should disclose publicly
what the consequences of these
athletes' actions are.
Downplaying this issue would
be an egregious error. The only
way the University can make its
purported image of tolerance a
reality is to deal with issues of prej
udice swiftly and with the utmost
gravity.
