## Do the right thing — do in TV 
### 
KILL YOUR television." You've seen
the bumper stickers. The ones that
are usually affixed to the chrome
tails of lime-green '74 Volkswagen Beetles
sputtering down 101 at just over 50 mph.
Maybe the message made you think that
doing in the old Zenith Selectavision might
not be such a bad idea.
It could bring anyone some serious plea
sure under the proper circumstances.
Imagine dragging a Sony set up to the top
of Hoover Tower, plugging in an extra-long
extension cord, tuning in to "90210," and
heaving the sucker right over the railing
just as the camera pans in for a Brenda
close up — her smile spinning around as
she becomes smaller and sm— "Watch out
Admiral Stockdale!" ... smaller, and small
er until...
Ahhhh. Stressbuster.
But there's more to killing your televi
sion than simply watching Brenda, Geraldo
or Conan go up in flames. Doing away with
TV is a metaphysical act.
I never watched much television, and
restricted my viewing to "The Simpsons"
like many Stanfordites. But this year I
experienced cable. Oh great TV god, I never
knew your omnipotence until now.
True, my overall weekly Technicolor
consumption has only gone up from a half
hour to a couple of hours, but in terms of
percentages, that's pretty bad.
For my roommates it's the same story.
One of them turns on the tube when he
strolls in at 3 a.m. and promptly falls asleep

in front of it. I thought you weren't sup
posed to do that until after retirement.
Another watches anything '70s for the
sheer entertainment value of recapturing
the luster of childhood and discovering
what other roles Erik Estrada played.
A third waits fill week for the Cinemax
"Friday After Dark" specials. These are
definitely not for the faint of heart. We're
talking about the kind of movies you go to
the video store in a trenchcoat and sun
glasses to rent. The kind of stuff that the
guy behind the counter has to give you a
special key to the back room just to look at
the boxes. The kind of stuff you were
always curious about, but too afraid to rent.
Come on, enjoy it. You didn't pick it out,
it just happened to be on when you were
watching.
But the worst is my last roommate who
needs television. He is a rare case of the per
son who not only can work in front of the
tube, but his productivity actually increas
es when he watches it.
"It helps me focus. It frees me of all
those annoying distractions I find in my
quiet room."
He's got it bad. He comes into the room
and turns on cable. He leaves and I turn it
off. He comes back, works for about twenty
seconds, and then it happens. He freezes,
his skin starts to curl, he looses complete
motor control, his eyes bulge out. He gets
paranoid.
"Hey man, what happened to my TV?
You didn't take it away did you?"

"Why no, it's just on loan." (Heh, heh.)
"Permanent loan."
"Ahhhhhhh!"
He is actually crippled when I hide the
remote. He's the kind of person who will
spend an hour running around the room
looking for the thing with the television ofT,
just so he can sit on the couch and watch a
program he wasn't planning to change
channels from anyway.
"Remotes are a matter of principle."
Well that principle has turned our "fam
ily room" into a "television room," and
meal times into perfect opportunities to
catch a half-hour of movies like " 'The
Dog': one star. A Frenchman takes his dog
for a walk and runs into another man walk
ing a dog. The first in a low-budget trilogy
that we Cinemax bought exclusively to
show at on weekday afternoons when only
losers are watching TV."
The very presence of a television in a
room inspires you to start watching things
you never intend to finish and never would
have started watching if you gave it a
moment's thought.
So give in to that primal craving, suc
cumb to your violent desires, make of your
set what it can make of your mind.

Michael promises his roommates he will
never write about them again.
