## Daily editorial oversimplified arguments against Grey 
### 
I AM WRITING to clarify several
issues raised in your May 12 edito
rial on the current lawsuit over the
Grey Interpretation of the speech
code.
First, the editorial mentions the
Leonard Law, but fails to discuss
properly its ramifications. As you
note, the Leonard Law provides stu
dents at private universities with the
same rights they would enjoy outside
the university under both the Califor
nia state and U.S. Constitutions.
Hence, your distinguishing the Uni
versity of Wisconsin code from the
Stanford code on the grounds of Stan
ford being a private institution and
thus not subject to the First Amend
ment is inapposite; the Leonard Law
forces Stanford to comply with the
First Amendment as though it were a
public institution. As such, there is no
difference in the legal standard to be
applied to the two schools.
Independent of the Leonard Law,
however, the California state Consti-

tution's free speech guarantees under
Article I, Section 2, would extend cov
erage even to institutions such as
Stanford which are legally private.
The California Supreme Court has
consistently held that private shop
ping centers and other such establish
ments that have large public thor
oughfares must adhere to the free
speech guarantees under the Califor
nia Constitution.
In contrast, small private organiza
tions, such as abortion clinics, have
been exempted from being classified as
public institutions for the purposes of
free speech. Hence, the size of the
Stanford campus and the heavy public
traffic it supports would counsel in
favor of extending the California con
stitution's free speech provisions.
Second, the editorial inaccurately
characterizes the plaintiffs as mostly
affiliated with The Stanford Review.
Had the editorial staff done its home
work, it would have learned that only
three of the nine plaintiffs are current

members of The Review, hardly
accounting for most of the plaintiffs.
As we have repeatedly emphasized
at both our initial press conference
and our appearance on KZSU on Mon
day evening, each of the plaintiffs rep
resents himself only and not any of
the groups with which he may be affil
iated.
Indeed, the group of plaintiffs runs
the gamut of ideologies, encompassing
politically conservative, moderate and
liberal individuals as well as ideologi
cal libertarians. Attempting to affili
ate this group of plaintiffs with any
single ideology is not only unfair to
the individuals involved, but also
serves to deflect attention from the
more important issue at hand: is the
code consistent with the rights guar
anteed all students under the Consti
tution?
Third, we disagree that by choosing
to go to court instead of engaging in
an amicable settlement discussion the
University displays its commitment to

clarifying the code. Such an assertion
assumes that there is some inherent
benefit to going to court that cannot
be gleaned from a meeting of the
minds outside of court.
Not only is this proposition doubt
ful, but going to court will cost the
University a large amount of money.
At a time of budget cuts, we would
think that the University would seek
to maximize the use of its scarce fiscal
resources. As such, we repeat our
intention to consider carefully any set
tlement offer the University may
make available.
We applaud The Daily's decision to
endorse some clarification of the legal
status of the code. As you suggest,
free speech rights are too important to
be chilled in the wake of the vagaries
of the code; the value of every Stan
ford students' education is at stake.
