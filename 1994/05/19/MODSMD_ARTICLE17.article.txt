# Victim of gay bashing tells story, knows two very different Dustys
## 
### 
I feel deeply for junior Dusty Allen,
who describes his role in the recent
defacing of the Gay Liberation statue
on campus as that of a "a victim of cir
cumstance." ("Athletes arrested for
defacing gay statue, May 17"). He
reminds me of an ex-boyfriend of mine
(coincidentally also named Dusty) who
was likewise a victim of circumstance.
My Dusty was walking back to his
car alone late one night in the City
when a group of three men approached
him and began yelling homophobic epi
thets and shoving him. When Dusty
tried to defend himself, one of the men

wielded a baseball bat and hit Dusty on
his side and head. After knocking
Dusty to the ground the men got tired
of the defenseless faggot and moved on.
My Dusty knows what being a vic
tim of circumstance really is. He
knows that it's being in a situation
that you're not able to control, despite
your best intentions, and having some
one else take advantage of you because
of it.
Our Dusty here on campus is not
what I'd call a victim of circumstance.
He piled a group of his drunken
friends armed with paint into his car
and drove them around campus,
arranging to pick them up later.
Even if Dusty didn't know what
they were up to, he probably could
have guessed it was no good. But
thank heavens our on-campus Dusty
came out of his encounter with drunk

en bullies safely. He'll probably have a
few labels placed upon him and might
even bring his fraternity under some
sort of scrutiny. My Dusty spent two
days in the hospital, has lost some of
his mobility, and still wakes up in a
dead sweat from nightmares recount
ing his incident.
I write this letter as another victim
of gay bashing. Although I've yet to
have my head bashed in by the likes of
our well-meaning on-campus friends, I
still have to fear that it will some day
be me, and not some large pieces of
metal, they confront while looking to
share their good will. And while inci
dents like this still go on, I wish I
could think people like Dusty Allen are
thoughtful enough to lend me a hand.
