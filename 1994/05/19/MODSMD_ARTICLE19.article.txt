## Pitcher Robbins a true 'comeback kid' Despite injury and freak fall, sophomore returns to mound 
### Mike Langford Senior staff writer 
Mike Robbins is a baseball player. If anyone was
forced to limit their description of the Stanford sopho
more, they would do well to use those two words. From
his characteristic superstitions to his dugout antics and
laughter to his alternating seriousness and exuberance
on the field, Robbins is a ball player through and
through.
Though his career almost ended more than once,
there is just too much baseball in Robbins for it to be
over. At least not yet.
From the beginning, Robbins was a pitcher. Even
though he would also play field positions throughout
high school, Robbins knew that he was a pitcher first
and foremost.
"I guess it was an ego thing that got me started in
pitching, being in control and all," said Robbins with a
smile. "Playing well in the field or at the plate became
important because it was harder. I came to expect pitch
ing success. It came more easily to me."
Those expectations weren't unfounded. In Robbins'
sophomore year, his first year at Oakland's Skyline
High School and first year on the varsity, the left-han
der went 8-2 and was named first-team all-league. The
next year, Robbins had another outstanding season,
and began to consider his skill on the hill as an integral
part of his future.
During the recruiting period, Robbins didn't hear
from Stanford right away, and when he did, he didn't
feel like he was getting "good vibes." For a while, Rob
bins thought he was going to California, but after a
recruiting visit to the Farm, Robbins knew his dream of
becoming a Cardinal would come true.
Robbins would go on to play for his high school team
his senior year. For the third year, he would be an all
league pitcher. For the third year, he would hit over
.400 as an outfielder and first baseman. And at the end
of the year, he would be named All-State and get draft
ed by the New York Yankees in the 33rd round.
But that was also the year that the problems began.
Strike one
In January of his senior year, Robbins' started to feel
some pain in his left elbow after a throwing workout
with a teammate. However, Robbins was not about to
let a little pain keep him from baseball, so he decided to
"pitch through it" for the remainder of the season and
rest his elbow over the summer.
But Robbins was invited to play on the junior nation
al team in Mexico for the summer, an opportunity too
good to pass up. After a long summer season of games,
which ended in a loss in the championship game to
Cuba, it was time to start working out with his new
teammates at Stanford.
Though pitching in pain throughout the autumn
practice season, Robbins was reluctant to stop playing
after his impressive performances in competition for a
wide-open starting spot in the rotation.
"I was really eager," Robbins said. "I didn't want
anyone to get ahead of me. I wanted to pitch."

Robbins finally told the coaches about the pain at the
end of the preseason, and was advised to rest the arm
until January, which he did. But when he started pitch
ing again, the pain was even worse. That's when Rob
bins and the coaches decided to have arthroscopic
surgery on the elbow to see what the problem was.
Until that time, Robbins had been told by various
doctors that the problem was anything from torn carti
lage to tendonitis to torn ligaments. The surgery didn't
reveal much more, only that the lining of the elbow
joint was inflamed.
Robbins had tried, and would continue to try every
thing for treatment. Therapy. Anti-inflammatory med
ication. Chiropractic. Even acupuncture.
Finally the frustrated freshman decided that he

would not push and try to return to the team that year.
He canceled his summer plans to pitch in Anchorage so
that he could dedicate his summer to rest, conditioning
and getting ready for his sophomore year.
But those plans came to a crashing halt late one
June night.
Strike two
A couple of days before his finals ended and his sum
mer began, Robbins went to bed after hanging out with
friends in his second-floor dorm room. And what fol
lowed was a freak accident which Robbins still can't
