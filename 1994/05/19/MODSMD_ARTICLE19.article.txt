## Pitcher Robbins a true 'comeback kid' Despite injury and freak fall, sophomore returns to mound 
### Mike Langford Senior staff writer 
Mike Robbins is a baseball player. If anyone was
forced to limit their description of the Stanford sopho
more, they would do well to use those two words. From
his characteristic superstitions to his dugout antics and
laughter to his alternating seriousness and exuberance
on the field, Robbins is a ball player through and
through.
Though his career almost ended more than once,
there is just too much baseball in Robbins for it to be
over. At least not yet.
From the beginning, Robbins was a pitcher. Even
though he would also play field positions throughout
high school, Robbins knew that he was a pitcher first
and foremost.
"I guess it was an ego thing that got me started in
pitching, being in control and all," said Robbins with a
smile. "Playing well in the field or at the plate became
important because it was harder. I came to expect pitch
ing success. It came more easily to me."
Those expectations weren't unfounded. In Robbins'
sophomore year, his first year at Oakland's Skyline
High School and first year on the varsity, the left-han
der went 8-2 and was named first-team all-league. The
next year, Robbins had another outstanding season,
and began to consider his skill on the hill as an integral
part of his future.
During the recruiting period, Robbins didn't hear
from Stanford right away, and when he did, he didn't
feel like he was getting "good vibes." For a while, Rob
bins thought he was going to California, but after a
recruiting visit to the Farm, Robbins knew his dream of
becoming a Cardinal would come true.
Robbins would go on to play for his high school team
his senior year. For the third year, he would be an all
league pitcher. For the third year, he would hit over
.400 as an outfielder and first baseman. And at the end
of the year, he would be named All-State and get draft
ed by the New York Yankees in the 33rd round.
But that was also the year that the problems began.
Strike one
In January of his senior year, Robbins' started to feel
some pain in his left elbow after a throwing workout
with a teammate. However, Robbins was not about to
let a little pain keep him from baseball, so he decided to
"pitch through it" for the remainder of the season and
rest his elbow over the summer.
But Robbins was invited to play on the junior nation
al team in Mexico for the summer, an opportunity too
good to pass up. After a long summer season of games,
which ended in a loss in the championship game to
Cuba, it was time to start working out with his new
teammates at Stanford.
Though pitching in pain throughout the autumn
practice season, Robbins was reluctant to stop playing
after his impressive performances in competition for a
wide-open starting spot in the rotation.
"I was really eager," Robbins said. "I didn't want
anyone to get ahead of me. I wanted to pitch."

Robbins finally told the coaches about the pain at the
end of the preseason, and was advised to rest the arm
until January, which he did. But when he started pitch
ing again, the pain was even worse. That's when Rob
bins and the coaches decided to have arthroscopic
surgery on the elbow to see what the problem was.
Until that time, Robbins had been told by various
doctors that the problem was anything from torn carti
lage to tendonitis to torn ligaments. The surgery didn't
reveal much more, only that the lining of the elbow
joint was inflamed.
Robbins had tried, and would continue to try every
thing for treatment. Therapy. Anti-inflammatory med
ication. Chiropractic. Even acupuncture.
Finally the frustrated freshman decided that he

would not push and try to return to the team that year.
He canceled his summer plans to pitch in Anchorage so
that he could dedicate his summer to rest, conditioning
and getting ready for his sophomore year.
But those plans came to a crashing halt late one
June night.
Strike two
A couple of days before his finals ended and his sum
mer began, Robbins went to bed after hanging out with
friends in his second-floor dorm room. And what fol
lowed was a freak accident which Robbins still can't

remember.
Sometime after falling asleep on
his top bunk, Robbins fell out of the
open window which was situated
right next to his bed. He landed on
the concrete courtyard some 20-
plus feet below, not two feet from a
bicycle and a steel bike rack.
Robbins cracked his L-2 and L-3
vertebrae, fractured his pelvis and a
bone in his right wrist. He finally
regained consciousness in the hos
pital for the first time since going to
sleep in his dorm room. He wasn't
thinking about his arm much any
more.
"It really put the whole elbow
injury into perspective," Robbins
said. "Here I was, thinking things
were so bad for me because of my
arm, when things could have been a
hell of a lot worse than not being
able to throw a damn baseball. I
could've never been able to walk
again, or move, or even been alive."
After a few days in the hospital,
Robbins spent 12 weeks wearing a
brace and a cast. He did nothing
connected to baseball the entire
summer, aside from working as a
recreations director for a city park.

Ironically, the inactivity gave his
arm the rest it needed.
Gradually, Robbins began to
ride a stationary bike, and tried to
get back into shape. Although his
back was sore and his lx>dy wasn't
in the shape he wanted it to be in,
Robbins' recovery was nothing
short of amazing. By the fall, he
was ready to try pitching again.
But Robbins the baseball player
wasn't satisfied with the results.
"I was mediocre," Robbins said
of his performance during fall prac
tices. "My arm didn't feel like I
wanted it to feel, and my body
wasn't feeling the way I wanted it
to feel."
Hoping that he just needed to
get into better shape, Robbins
decided to lift weights and run until
winter break. But when he started
throwing right before vacation,
Robbins' arm still didn't feel right.
"I was so frustrated at that
point," Robbins said. "I was ready
to hang it up right there."
And that's when it happened.
Robbins still isn't sure why, but one
winter day, everything seemed to
look like it would be all right.
The comeback kid
"I don't really like to talk about
it — I don't want to jinx it," said

Robbins, his hand stroking a scalp
just starting to show stubble after
some members of the team shaved
their heads. "I went out to throw
with a friend of mine, and things
just sort of fell into place. Every
thing had been out of sync, but all
of a sudden, things started to click."
When Robbins returned to Stan
ford, four intra-squad games in
January showed pitching perfor
mances that harked to the Robbins
of old. The sophomore lefty put
himself in a position to pitch for the
team when the season started. And
he did.
His first appearance came in
relief against Cal-State Fullerton.
He pitched a couple of great innings
against the soon-to-be No. 1-ranked
team before getting roughed up.
But the results were immaterial.
Mike Robbins was back.
"It was pretty amazing," Rob
bins said. "So many emotions were
going through my head when I
went out there."
As the season progressed, so did
Robbins' pitching. His first six
appearances all came in relief, with
mixed results. But then, against the
University of the Pacific, Robbins
was given the chance to start, and
responded by pitching two hitless
innings to get his first collegiate
win.

That weekend, Robbins started
for an injured teammate and
pitched seven strong innings
against conference rival Arizona
State, giving up only one run for his
second win in five days. Robbins
was named Pacific 10 Conference
Southern Division Pitcher of the
Week. The following weekend Rob
bins pitched a complete game win
against UCLA
With a 5-3 record and a 3.86
ERA heading into Stanford's post
season, Robbins has established
himself as one of the Cardinal's,
and one of the Six-Pac's, best pitch
ers.
But the notoriety, the numbers
and the praise don't matter much
to Robbins. One glance at how he
receives the ball from the catcher,
or how hejokes with his teammates
or how he sprints to and from the
bullpen reveals that the goateed
southpaw simply wants to be where
he feels his home is.
"I just want to be out there
pitching," Robbins said. "Really.
The good things that have hap
pened to me could have hap
pened to a lot of other guys out
there who are more talented
than I am.
"I feel so lucky."
Mike Robbins is a baseball play
er. And he is thankful for it.
