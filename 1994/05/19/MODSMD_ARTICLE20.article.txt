# Men's golf to shoot in NCAA West Regionals
##

They can see a glimmer of light at the end of
the tunnel.
More than eight months after the season
began, the Stanford men golfers will finally be
playing where it counts â€” in the NCAA tourna
ment. The No. 2 Cardinal will attempt to claim
its first national title in more than lour decades
as NCAA Western Regional action begins today
in Tucson, Ariz.
The Cardinal, which earned the No. 1 seed in
today's regional by virtue of winning the Pacific
10 Conference title, will compete among the top
18 teams from the West at the National Golf
Course today through Saturday. In order to
qualify for the NCAA finals in Dallas, Tex., the
Cardinal must finish in the top nine.
Stanford avoided near disaster last week
when juniors Notah Begay 111 and Casey Martin
were temporarily declared ineligible by the
NCAA. Both golfers, who play in the top two
positions for the Cardinal, were re-in stilted sev

their suspension.
Men's golf coach Wally Goodwin would not
comment on the incident, though some sources
on the team report that Goodwin voluntarily
approached the Department of Athletics over
what he perceived might be NCAA infractions.
The Athletics Department, as well, declined
comment, though Senior Associate Athletic
Director Cheryl Levick did say the case had been
resolved. Both athletes involved could not be
reached for comment.
Whatever caused the incident, it icmains

bullet of the year. Begay and Martin, both All-
American performers, were among the five
Stanford golfers who left for Arizona Tuesday.
"I'm very relieved," said Goodwin. "I was
extremely concerned because they were actually
ineligible for 2-1/2 days."
Now that Stanford has survived its biggest
challenge off the golf course, it is sure to con
front a big one on it as well. Apart from perenni
al foes Arizona and Arizona State, talented
squads from Brigham Young, Texas-El Paso,
Fresno State and New Mexico are sure to chal
lenge the Cardinal for the tournament title.
Yet there is no denying that Stanford, which
comes into the regionals with five tournament
titles on the year, is the team to beat.
"If we play our game we've got a chance to
win," said Goodwin. "Unless some team gets out
