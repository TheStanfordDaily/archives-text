# Track ready to launch into Pac-10 championships
## After week of rest, men and women primed to face off in conference meet 
### Jorge Chen Staff writer 
This weekend, spectators in
Pullman, Wash, will be in for a
treat as they will get a taste of one
of the top collegiate track and field
showdowns in the country, the
Pacific 10 Conference Champi
onships. Many top national ath
letes will be competing in this
weekend's festivities held at Wash
ington State University.
After Travis Clark captured the
Pac-10 decathlon crown the previ
ous weekend, the 25 members of
the Cardinal squad are ready to
keep the tide rolling, as they're
anxious to head north and compete
after an off week.
"Travis is the catalyst for
upcoming solid individual perfor
mances," said Cardinal head coach
Vin Lananna.
The men's team is going into
this weekend's showdown with a
Cardinal in nearly every event, as
Stanford athletes qualified in
everything except the javelin and
the 400-meter hurdles.
"I am very pleased with many of
our male athletes who are really
coming around at this time of the
year," Lananna said. "Our team is
focusing much more on individual
performances than overall score
this weekend."
However, many members of the
men's team are eager to turn tables
around and score well this week
end.
Senior long jumper Jason
Robinson is one of them. "I want to
place higher in team scoring on the

men's side, and not to be at the bot
tom like last year. A top-five finish
would be great," he said.
As Robinson has high expecta
tions for the team, he plans to meet
those expectations with contribu
tions from his own event."I expect
to win. I am due for one since it has
been a long time and I know there
is a big jump waiting inside my
body somewhere ready to come out
very soon."
Similar to Robinson, freshman
sprinter Jimmie Johnson is as
determined to get things done in
the 200 meters.
"I cannot mention that I am
going in the way I wanted to but
anything can happen since I've
seen runners who weren't so hot
coming in, and taking it all in one
day,"he said. "It would be interest
ing to see how guys bounce back
this weekend from the Big Meet."
Hoping to turn their fortunes
around from the disappointing
showing at the Big Meet, the men
will have to count on youthful exu
berance, as many members of the
squad are freshmen.
"There is always a first for
everything, and hopefully I will get
my feet wet and gain much experi
ence from it as I will hopefully
embark on a journey of many more
accomplishments to come," John
son said.
As a senior, discus and shot put
thrower Matt Karsevar sees an
improved men's team over past
years' teams. "This is the best rep
resentative team in a long time and

versity over the weekend.
we will put things together to
place some damage and surprises
in the conference."
On the women's side, the team
has a lot of high expectations for
the team as well as themselves
individually.
"The women's team is set to go
and get the job done this week
end," Lananna said. "I am hoping
for big things to come from them."
Led by senior Louise Watson
and the distance team, much

work has been done to improve an
already impressive women's
squad.
"The women's team is a culmi
nation of all-out training. We are
eager and ready to go from an off
week last weekend," Watson said.
Watson foresees more than
just a weekend filled with excel
lent performances coming from
big athletes. "I know we will see
many surprises from others since
this will be such a big champi
onship meet and that usually
stimulates big performances due
to tough competition. I feel we
haven't had our races yet and the
time has come. All the arrows are

pointing in the right direction."
Junior co-captain Christy Boyd
shared Watson's optimism.
"Our team traditionally has
been young and many of us have
developed — an example is Flo
(Adu) — due to great coaching,"
Boyd said. "I am glad that I am in
both the relays so I can get the
team motivated via doing well and
being a role model for the team."
Junior triple jumper Florence
Adu feels much camaraderie in
the team going into this weekend.
"We will be a strong force and it's
really exciting since everyone will
be there for each other."
Freshman Leila Burr, who

showed an impressive perfor
mance last weekend at the
Modesto Invitational with a sec
ond-place finish in the 1,500
meters, also said she feels fortu
nate to get the conference experi
ence in her first year at Stanford.
"I am really happy to have
qualified last weekend and I am
hoping to finish in the top five in
the 3,000 meters," Burr said.
"I know that regardless of the
team scores we earn this week
end, both our teams have
improved drastically from previ
ous years and I couldn't be more
pleased about them," Lananna
said.

This weekend, spectators in
Pullman, Wash, will be in for a
treat as they will get a taste of one
of the top collegiate track and field
showdowns in the country, the
Pacific 10 Conference Champi
onships. Many top national ath
letes will be competing in this
weekend's festivities held at Wash
ington State University.
After Travis Clark captured the
Pac-10 decathlon crown the previ
ous weekend, the 25 members of
the Cardinal squad are ready to
keep the tide rolling, as they're
anxious to head north and compete
after an off week.
"Travis is the catalyst for
upcoming solid individual perfor
mances," said Cardinal head coach
Vin Lananna.
The men's team is going into
this weekend's showdown with a
Cardinal in nearly every event, as
Stanford athletes qualified in
everything except the javelin and
the 400-meter hurdles.
"I am very pleased with many of
our male athletes who are really
coming around at this time of the
year," Lananna said. "Our team is
focusing much more on individual
performances than overall score
this weekend."
However, many members of the
men's team are eager to turn tables
around and score well this week
end.
Senior long jumper Jason
Robinson is one of them. "I want to
place higher in team scoring on the

men's side, and not to be at the bot
tom like last year. A top-five finish
would be great," he said.
As Robinson has high expecta
tions for the team, he plans to meet
those expectations with contribu
tions from his own event."I expect
to win. I am due for one since it has
been a long time and I know there
is a big jump waiting inside my
body somewhere ready to come out
very soon."
Similar to Robinson, freshman
sprinter Jimmie Johnson is as
determined to get things done in
the 200 meters.
"I cannot mention that I am
going in the way I wanted to but
anything can happen since I've
seen runners who weren't so hot
coming in, and taking it all in one
day,"he said. "It would be interest
ing to see how guys bounce back
this weekend from the Big Meet."
Hoping to turn their fortunes
around from the disappointing
showing at the Big Meet, the men
will have to count on youthful exu
berance, as many members of the
squad are freshmen.
"There is always a first for
everything, and hopefully I will get
my feet wet and gain much experi
ence from it as I will hopefully
embark on a journey of many more
accomplishments to come," John
son said.
As a senior, discus and shot put
thrower Matt Karsevar sees an
improved men's team over past
years' teams. "This is the best rep
resentative team in a long time and

we will put things together to
place some damage and surprises
in the conference."
On the women's side, the team
has a lot of high expectations for
the team as well as themselves
individually.
"The women's team is set to go
and get the job done this week
end," Lananna said. "I am hoping
for big things to come from them."
Led by senior Louise Watson
and the distance team, much

work has been done to improve an
already impressive women's
squad.
"The women's team is a culmi
nation of all-out training. We are
eager and ready to go from an off
week last weekend," Watson said.
Watson foresees more than
just a weekend filled with excel
lent performances coming from
big athletes. "I know we will see
many surprises from others since
this will be such a big champi
onship meet and that usually
stimulates big performances due
to tough competition. I feel we
haven't had our races yet and the
time has come. All the arrows are

pointing in the right direction."
Junior co-captain Christy Boyd
shared Watson's optimism.
"Our team traditionally has
been young and many of us have
developed — an example is Flo
(Adu) — due to great coaching,"
Boyd said. "I am glad that I am in
both the relays so I can get the
team motivated via doing well and
being a role model for the team."
Junior triple jumper Florence
Adu feels much camaraderie in
the team going into this weekend.
"We will be a strong force and it's
really exciting since everyone will
be there for each other."
Freshman Leila Burr, who

showed an impressive perfor
mance last weekend at the
Modesto Invitational with a sec
ond-place finish in the 1,500
meters, also said she feels fortu
nate to get the conference experi
ence in her first year at Stanford.
"I am really happy to have
qualified last weekend and I am
hoping to finish in the top five in
the 3,000 meters," Burr said.
"I know that regardless of the
team scores we earn this week
end, both our teams have
improved drastically from previ
ous years and I couldn't be more
pleased about them," Lananna
said.
