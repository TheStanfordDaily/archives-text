# Inexcusable act
## Athletes should be held responsible for actions 
### 
Just what did these guys think
they were doing? When seven
varsity athletes decided to
vandalize a monument to the gay
liberation movement, they unwit
tingly pierced the near-perfect
armor of Stanford athletics, which
for so long seemed relatively safe
from the attacks against big-time
college athletics. Aside from the
basic legal consequences, the
unique nature of the crime and
those involved place Cardinal ath
letics in a difficult position, to say
the least.
Try as the University might to
downplay an athlete's place in the
Stanford community and just
make him or her one of many out
standing, unique individuals, there
can be no question that these seven
students represent the school
much more publicly than seven
average undergraduates. These
men place Stanford in the media
spotlight at least once a week dur
ing their respective seasons, a spot
light that has proven potentially
unmerciful time and time again.
While vandalism of a statue may
seem small potatoes to other uni
versities as far as athletes' mix-ups
with the law are concerned, for
something like this to happen here
puts the Department of Athletics
under intense scrutiny. It may also
do massive damage to the reputa
tion we try so hard to protect â€” a
reputation of an Athletics Depart
ment far above most other national
powerhouses.
Stanford prides itself on staying
true to the ideal of the student-ath

lete, but this incident harms that
reputation several ways. Not only
does it show the programs in ques
tion in a negative light, but it also
reinforces the stereotypes of ath
letes being inconsiderate brutes
devoid of sensitivity to other aim
pus groups. It especially perpetu
ates the stereotype of athletes
being homophobic.
Wrestling coach Chris Horpel,
quoted in yesterday's San Jose
Mercury News, said "Stanford stu
dents are almost force-fed political
correctness. I don't think people
feel too strongly about any of these
issues. I think what they did was
just sort of a reaction."
A reaction to what? While the
athletes may have been celebrating
the baseball team's Six-Pac Cham
pionship, the link between a cele
bratory reaction and dismissing
their criminal actions due to too
much political correctness has no
logic to it.
What Horpel calls "force-fed
political correctness" in this case I
would call basic human respect. I
think this respect, in the form of
