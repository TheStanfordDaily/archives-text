# Inexcusable act
## Athletes should be held responsible for actions 
### 
Just what did these guys think
they were doing? When seven
varsity athletes decided to
vandalize a monument to the gay
liberation movement, they unwit
tingly pierced the near-perfect
armor of Stanford athletics, which
for so long seemed relatively safe
from the attacks against big-time
college athletics. Aside from the
basic legal consequences, the
unique nature of the crime and
those involved place Cardinal ath
letics in a difficult position, to say
the least.
Try as the University might to
downplay an athlete's place in the
Stanford community and just
make him or her one of many out
standing, unique individuals, there
can be no question that these seven
students represent the school
much more publicly than seven
average undergraduates. These
men place Stanford in the media
spotlight at least once a week dur
ing their respective seasons, a spot
light that has proven potentially
unmerciful time and time again.
While vandalism of a statue may
seem small potatoes to other uni
versities as far as athletes' mix-ups
with the law are concerned, for
something like this to happen here
puts the Department of Athletics
under intense scrutiny. It may also
do massive damage to the reputa
tion we try so hard to protect — a
reputation of an Athletics Depart
ment far above most other national
powerhouses.
Stanford prides itself on staying
true to the ideal of the student-ath

lete, but this incident harms that
reputation several ways. Not only
does it show the programs in ques
tion in a negative light, but it also
reinforces the stereotypes of ath
letes being inconsiderate brutes
devoid of sensitivity to other aim
pus groups. It especially perpetu
ates the stereotype of athletes
being homophobic.
Wrestling coach Chris Horpel,
quoted in yesterday's San Jose
Mercury News, said "Stanford stu
dents are almost force-fed political
correctness. I don't think people
feel too strongly about any of these
issues. I think what they did was
just sort of a reaction."
A reaction to what? While the
athletes may have been celebrating
the baseball team's Six-Pac Cham
pionship, the link between a cele
bratory reaction and dismissing
their criminal actions due to too
much political correctness has no
logic to it.
What Horpel calls "force-fed
political correctness" in this case I
would call basic human respect. I
think this respect, in the form of

not damaging university property,
would take precedence over PC
dogma, hopefully keeping sensible
people from dumping paint on a
statue. I'm not sure what makes
me more upset — the actual van
dalism or Horpel's apparent ratio
nalization of the crime.
I wonder how the athletes
would feel if the outside of Arrilla

ga were vandalized and then the
culprits blamed the deed on the
disproportionate amount of
emphasis on sports at Stanford.
Would anyone in his or her right
mind accept this sort of lame
excuse?
You'd think that people would
be sensitive enough not to do
something so stupid — especially
potential role-model Stanford ath
letes. However, even by pushing
this off on the "boys will be boys"
line of reasoning insults the intelli
gence of everyone involved. Cele

brating a conference champi
onship is one thing, but acting like
complete fools and destroying art,
no matter what the content, is
quite another.
The "boys will be boys" line
pops up far too often when people
try to rationalize the actions of
their sports heroes. These are
young adults we are talking about,
not 8-year-olds who get out of
hand during recess. An athletic
scholarship, which numerous
Stanford athletes have, is a gift of
vast magnitude, and the recipients

of such an award have a responsi
bility to do everything in their
power not to tarnish the universi
ty's reputation.
Part of college life is learning
about the maturing process and
taking responsibility for one's own
actions, but it seems these seven
athletes may have had their blin
ders on the whole time. Hopefully
this event will open their eyes to
the place they hold in the Stanford
community and the power behind
what may have seemed like a
harmless prank.
