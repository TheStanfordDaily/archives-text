# Asbestos will delay Tresidder Taco Bell
##

Stanford's seniors will leave
campus before construction
begins on the long-awaited
Tresidder Union Taco Bell due
to the discovery of asbestos and
other planning problems, say
University officials in charge of
the project.
Construction on the restau
rant, originally slated to begin in
January, will likely begin in
June or July. While preliminary
blueprints have been finished,
the University has yet to obtain
a building permit from Santa
Clara County.
"Once we get the permit, it
won't take very long to build the
restaurant," said Tresidder
Asst. Director Jeannette Smith-
Laws. Construction should take
about six weeks.
"For sure, it will be open by
fall quarter of next year," said
Tresidder Director Bobbi
Braden. Despite the delay, she
maintained that there have been
no significant changes in plan.
"We said that we hoped to
start construction by spring quar
ter," said Braden. "We are still
expecting to have the major con
struction done over the summer."
Smith-Laws said asbestos
has been found in the walls and
ceiling of the future Taco Bell
site, now the Recreation Center
desk, and must be removed
before construction can begin.
"That requires that the
whole area be sealed off," she
said. "So we won't be able to
start until sometime in June,
after Commencement."
Smith-Laws also attributed
the postponement of construction
to problems with original plans
for the facility. She said that some
of the equipment units, including
an ice machine and a beverage
machine, will require an exhaust
fan system which wasn't included
in the drawings.
She explained that detailed
plans are required for each com
ponent of the restaurant, includ
ing plumbing, electrical outlets,
and lighting. In addition, each
plan must be approved separate

ly by the county.
"We recently did a walk
through with mechanical people
and electricians from the county
to get feedback on plans," said
Smith-Laws.
Based on that review, new
drawings have been ordered
that show an exhaust hood â€” a
device that draws in heat and
fumes and transports it outside,
as well as circulating fresh air
back in. In addition, a location
must be found where the
exhaust hood can ventilate.
The space directly in front of
the restaurant is a public area, so
exhaust pipes will have to be built
in the ceiling, running back
behind the restaurant. The area
under the ASSU office is "a logical
place," according to Smith-Laws.
Taco Bell originally told
Tresidder that they wouldn't
need a new exhaust system, she
said, but have since gone back
on that claim.
"We just faxed that informa
tion back to the suppliers," she
said. "We expect them to finish
the plans by early next week,
when we'll send them to the
county."
Smith-Laws also said that
new plumbing drawings have to
be made to accommodate addi
tional machines that will require
drains. "We're basically putting
a food service operation in a
[recreational] center," said
Smith-Laws.
The Rec Center bathrooms
must also be cha d to be
wheelchair accessih id up to
food service codes.
She said he expects glass and
other materials to begin arriving
during the i ext two weeks, at
which time the Rec Center desk
will move to a new location.
While she could not comment
on how long the permit process
usually takes, Smith-Laws said
the matter will soon be out of
Stanford's hands. "It depends
on what's in the county's office,
what's on their desk," she said.
"These are mainly structural
problems," said Smith-Laws. "It
shouldn't interfere with next
fall's opening."
