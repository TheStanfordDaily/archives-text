# For the record

The headline in yesterday's
Daily that read "ASSU supports
protest" was misleading in that it
implied the ASSU supported the
disruption made by Concerned
Students for Asian-American
Studies at the May 12 Faculty
Senate meeting. The ASSU Sen
ate did pass a resolution last
night which requested the steer
ing committee of Fac Sen allow
Concerned Students for Asian-
American Studies to speak at
today's Fac Sen meeting.
