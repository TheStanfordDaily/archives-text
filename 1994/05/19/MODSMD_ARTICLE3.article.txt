Despite doubts about Stanford's fund-raising
ability, the University ranks fourth in the nation
for both overall and alumni donations according
to a Council for Aid to Education report.
Dropping two places from its second-place
ranking last year, Stanford raked in a total of
$182,391,695 for the 1992-93 fiscal year — com
ing in just behind Harvard University, the Uni
versity of Pennsylvania and Cornell University.
Alumni contributed $56,700,816 of the total
amount given to Stanford, and the rest came
from corporations, foundations and "friends" or
people not directly affiliated with the University.
"Total giving is very strong," said John Ford,

vice president of the Office of Development.
"We've done well holding our own."
But some alumni are doing much more than
their share to keep Stanford's coffers filled. Only 26
percent of undergraduate alumni donate money to
the University — far behind rates of about 50 per
cent at other top universities, Ford said.
"We wish we had a higher level of participa
tion in alumni giving," he said.
While Stanford's numbers are strong, Ford
said the Office of Development is still trying to
capitalize on the campaign to donate that started
with the celebration of Stanford's Centennial in
1991.
And even though the trend seems to be look
ing up, Ford hopes for even greater progress.
"This is something you change over a decade or

over a generation," he said. "Because we've put
such a focus on this issue I think we are seeing a
positive response."
The office is also focusing efforts on current
students in order to start the giving habit early.
University Trustee Peter Bing's recent offer to
match senior gift funds was cited by Ford as an es
pecially successful program. And the office is de
vising more ways to encourage alumni to donate.
"There are a number of things in the works
over a decade that will bring strong gain in alum
ni giving," he said.
Low alumni satisfaction could be one cause of
the problem. In the annual survey published by
U.S. News and World report last September,
