When I grow up, I want to be a riot
grrl. I want to cultivate a sneer,
play loud music and snarl my
hair. If I didn't shave it, that is.
I could wear punk baby-doll clothes,
streak red lipstick across my face and stomp
across the stage in combat boots like Court
ney Love. I would start my own band, cop
an attitude and be a goddess of unusual size.
No sugar and spice here — I'd revel in being
nasty over nice, all while writing raw hair
raising songs that'd make people cry and
then feel validated. As a riot grrl, I'd become
famous through the sheer virtuosity of my
vision and then eschew fame because a riot
grrl always discards anything that hints of
currying to the masses. Of course, as a riot
grrl, one would also have to stop using
words like "eschew."
And when my manic-depressive hus
band died an early pointless death, I'd
fiercely and respectfully refuse to lionize
him. No apologies.
Then again, I always admired the stark

minimalism and honesty of the beautifully
bald Sin£ad O'Connor. While her songs
don't growl, I don't know if I could ever be
as riot grrl-esque as she in antagonizing the
repressed. Go on, girl.
If I could, I'd ask her, "How do you main
tain such ferocity after exposing softness?
How can you possibly be so cool after
singing Frank Sinatra standards? I'm not
worthy, I'm not worthy... *
Or I could go the way of fellow
Chicagoan Liz Phair and frolic in my sexual
liberation, leaving anger to my fellow riot
grrls. So what if my voice is not particularly
melodious? I'd just sing and play my guitar
really hard. Riot grrls don't have inhibitions
about that sort of thing.
But a riot grrl doesn't have to be all thun
derous, you know. I could come in all sweet

and feminine with pink makeup and a silky
silver voice like Tori Amos and then break
out into unrestrained fire like 1 was... un
inhibited. Only a riot grrl could sing about
killing a rapist with a gun on one track and
standard love-song longing on the next.
We're a complex breed.
We love our sisters, and we hate them,
and we sing about it to confuse the rest of
you. We want to be beautiful, and then curse
ourselves for the possibility of our selling
out to the beauty myth. We want to be sex
ually liberated, to make up for lost time, and
we want you there when we feed the tree.
I worship at the idols of Blondie and Joan
Jett and the dear, departed Madonna. They
taught me the gospel of dirty hair, dirty
looks and dirty minds: wear too much eye
liner, get a little nasty and do something,

anything, delicious.
I admit, Madonna's usually dead-on pop
culture sensibility missed the target a bit
with her latest ventures. But if the new riot
grrls have taught me anything, it's that falli
bility is part of the act. Screw the '80s dy
nasty shoulder-pad, Christie Brinkley-per
fect, superwoman crap. Riot grrls slip, get
scratched up and wear their scars proudly.
Yeah, actually, mutilation is part of the
deal. Why do you think all those Barbie su
permodels are going k la Jenny Shimizu, get
ting tattoos and body piercings? This is an
aesthetic with bite.
When I grow up, 1 want to be a Non-
Blonde and get red dreadlocks and be big
ger, better, faster and more. Let's be shock
ing and nice at the same time and see how
much crap our little navel-pierced selves
can dish out to the deserving. Let's be bril
liant, competent and rude. Let's rule the
world
One way or another, I'm gonna getchya,
getchya, getchya, getchya ■
