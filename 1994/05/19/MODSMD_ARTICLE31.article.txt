# Frente! Naturally a world apart
## 
### 
It's a lazy, shiny May afternoon at Frost. And Frente! is the
perfect guest for such surroundings, bringing its breezy,
sing-song pop to the ears of the what's probably the
largest crowd it has ever played in front of.
A nice chunk of folks crowd approaches the center of the
field in front of the stage, bobbing their heads as singer Angie
Hart effortlessly delivers coy vocals with her hands clasped
behind her back. The band seems flattered and happy to be
here, to bask in the California sun after weeks on the Euro
pean circuit. Oh, brilliance!
Young, fresh fellows
lor these pleasant Aussies, being perfect hosts goes hand
in-hand with being perfect guests. Moments after their
sunny performance, Hart and guitarist/occasional vocalist
Simon Austin are ready to talk about Frente!. But first things
first — they offer refreshments from their stocked refrigera
tor with a friendly Australian drawl.
While it wouldn't quite be accurate to portray this outfit
as a "gosh" band, let's just describe them as a one of those
"young bands who are just normal people," as 1 lart puts it.
l ike those other young bands, Frente! comes from hum
ble yet humorous origins. Austin and Hart first met in a not
so-auspicious situation: Hart was an underaged drinker
whom barman Austin kicked out. Their paths crossed again
when Hart's big sister suggested to Austin that her little sis
ter Angie would be a good singer for his fledgling band.
"We started it for fun," Hart states matter-of-factly.
"Where we were, everyone was in a band. It's just one of
those things. I didn't expect to be in a band, but Simon
[Austin] was starting one. So I said, 'Why not?' We just
played for fun."
What helped to give the members of Frente! that initial
push into the music world is also the fuel which drives their
approach to music now: being natural. The bands they listen
to are just that and not actual influences. After all, it's hard to
find snippets of Soundgarden or Run-DMC (favorites of
Austin and Hart, respectively) in the band's songs.
"When people ask, 'What are your influences?', |I say,l
'This is what I listen to.' But what I play, I have absolutely no
control over," Hart explains. "We get compared to bands 1
don't actually like. You can't hear your own sound."
Still, it's tempting to take a stab at describing the sound of
Frente!. One oh-so-influential British music weekly declares
the band has "an alluring disregard for conventional struc
ture and harmony which locates [it] closer to Pavement."
And, clearly, Hart's evocative singing draws comparisons to
the vocal gymnastics of Harriet Wheeler of the Sundays and
the rich tone of Kristin Hersh. Yet these tags prove only use
ful in giving a rough estimate of what Frente! is like and are,
ultimately, fruitless exercises in trying to sum up the diverse
sounds Frente! feature.
'Jazzy pop'
Take Sunday's Rinc-A-Delt performance as evidence.
After starting with a couple of chimy pop tunes, Austin,
bassist Tim O'Connor and drummer Alistair Barden break
into a jazzy interlude which proves to be an intro to the jazzy
number "See/Believe." Between then and the summery pop
bounce of the set-closing "Ordinary Angels," Frente! throws
in a couple of change-ups, from an almost raucous rocker
where Austin takes the lead vocals to their radio hit cover of
New Order's "Bizarre Love Triangle." The frenzied 45-
minute circuit of styles makes pigeonholing Frente! kind of
hard.
Then, perhaps it's best to leave it to Austin and Hart to
characterize their music.
"It's a lazy label, but we like to call it 'jazzy pop,'" Hart
says, taking a shot.
"It's'jazzy pop,' " Austin concurs. "It's kind of thoughtful.
We're happy and sad. We're kind of for dancing around a bit.
But, yeah, 'jazzy pop' is pretty close."
Close on the heels of the futile attempts to capture
Frentei's craft in word is ample acclaim and an ever-growing
base of fans. Back home in Australia, accolades — including
being selected by a Rolling Stone/Australia Readers' Poll as
Best New Band — have been accompanied by indie-chart
topping success. Over here, word is getting out, as compli
mentary reviews are hitting newsstands just as their first hit,
the "Bizarre, Love Triangle" cover, is getting loads of airplay
on modern rock radio. The two see this exposure as a step to

wards getting their un-mainstream music to the American
masses.
"I think the best part of the American scene is its vibrant
support of things that are new. Since this place is so big, you
have whole subcultures that's so into new stuff that a band
like us can come over here and feel really good. There's a vibe
over here that you can do anything you like," Austin points
out.
"It's like anything when it's new," Hart chime* in. "People
get really excited about it and then kind of miss hearing it for
a while (when it's not being played]. Then, once it becomes
a regular thing, [people) get really used to hearing it and it
gets in (their) head. So you've got to swing for a while until
.. . " she pauses and concludes, only to punctuate the unfin
ished thought with a "you know?"
P is for the growing pains
Despite the fact that Frentel's rise to the top of the alter
native scene here in the United States has been lightning
quick, the band has had its share of hardships and gone
through its share of phases. After all, the members of Frente!
have been around since 1988. While they're pleased with
what they've achieved to date, Frente! feels the same uncer
tainties and self-conscious doubts nice people in a young
band are apt to feel.
"|Winning awards and gaining acclaim| is a two-way
thing. At first, it's 'wow!' " Austin relates. "Next week, you
think, 'There's going to be a huge backlash and they're going
to hate us.' And also, [you think,) 'How are we going to equal

that?' Then there's, 'How
are you going to get that feel
ing again?' "

"People can get really funny about [suc
cess]," Hart adds. "Once you get to that
stage, they assume you get too big for your

o / / o c /
boots. It can get realiy harsh."
The vocalist explains by example, detailing
the response back home to the sugary pop song

"Accidentally Kelly Street." What was meant to be a tongue
in-cheek pop ditty drew some ire. Hart notes that "people
|demanded], 'How dare they put out something like this!' "
In some senses, such scrutiny has made Frente! cautious.
"It gets to the point that you feel guilty if you do some
thing good," Austin says. "You think, 'I don't want to have
fun.' Because if they write anything bad about you, you're
going to be shattered. If you never have fun, you can never be
disappointed."
Nothing unnatural
Still, Frente! has emerged from such obstacles stronger
and better for wear. According to Austin, focusing on the
natural joys of music making has helped the band to contin
ue and flourish.
"When you're doing the touring thing, you really lose
sight of it," Austin reflects. "You just forget what's really good
about it. Those really amazing shows or those nice moments
in the studio when something is incredible. . . . The good
things about this are those moments."
Yet perhaps Hart puts it best when she puts it simply.
"I love singing," she tells as she lights up with a chuckle. ■

For those of you who missed Frente! or really liked their set, the
Aussies willl be buck in town June 10 at Shoreline Jor the big
Live 105 shindig. They'll be touring all summer us well, both
headlining on their own and opening for Counting (".rows.

It's a lazy, shiny May afternoon at Frost. And Frente! is the
perfect guest for such surroundings, bringing its breezy,
sing-song pop to the ears of the what's probably the
largest crowd it has ever played in front of.
A nice chunk of folks crowd approaches the center of the
field in front of the stage, bobbing their heads as singer Angie
Hart effortlessly delivers coy vocals with her hands clasped
behind her back. The band seems flattered and happy to be
here, to bask in the California sun after weeks on the Euro
pean circuit. Oh, brilliance!
Young, fresh fellows
lor these pleasant Aussies, being perfect hosts goes hand
in-hand with being perfect guests. Moments after their
sunny performance, Hart and guitarist/occasional vocalist
Simon Austin are ready to talk about Frente!. But first things
first — they offer refreshments from their stocked refrigera
tor with a friendly Australian drawl.
While it wouldn't quite be accurate to portray this outfit
as a "gosh" band, let's just describe them as a one of those
"young bands who are just normal people," as 1 lart puts it.
l ike those other young bands, Frente! comes from hum
ble yet humorous origins. Austin and Hart first met in a not
so-auspicious situation: Hart was an underaged drinker
whom barman Austin kicked out. Their paths crossed again
when Hart's big sister suggested to Austin that her little sis
ter Angie would be a good singer for his fledgling band.
"We started it for fun," Hart states matter-of-factly.
"Where we were, everyone was in a band. It's just one of
those things. I didn't expect to be in a band, but Simon
[Austin] was starting one. So I said, 'Why not?' We just
played for fun."
What helped to give the members of Frente! that initial
push into the music world is also the fuel which drives their
approach to music now: being natural. The bands they listen
to are just that and not actual influences. After all, it's hard to
find snippets of Soundgarden or Run-DMC (favorites of
Austin and Hart, respectively) in the band's songs.
"When people ask, 'What are your influences?', |I say,l
'This is what I listen to.' But what I play, I have absolutely no
control over," Hart explains. "We get compared to bands 1
don't actually like. You can't hear your own sound."
Still, it's tempting to take a stab at describing the sound of
Frente!. One oh-so-influential British music weekly declares
the band has "an alluring disregard for conventional struc
ture and harmony which locates [it] closer to Pavement."
And, clearly, Hart's evocative singing draws comparisons to
the vocal gymnastics of Harriet Wheeler of the Sundays and
the rich tone of Kristin Hersh. Yet these tags prove only use
ful in giving a rough estimate of what Frente! is like and are,
ultimately, fruitless exercises in trying to sum up the diverse
sounds Frente! feature.
'Jazzy pop'
Take Sunday's Rinc-A-Delt performance as evidence.
After starting with a couple of chimy pop tunes, Austin,
bassist Tim O'Connor and drummer Alistair Barden break
into a jazzy interlude which proves to be an intro to the jazzy
number "See/Believe." Between then and the summery pop
bounce of the set-closing "Ordinary Angels," Frente! throws
in a couple of change-ups, from an almost raucous rocker
where Austin takes the lead vocals to their radio hit cover of
New Order's "Bizarre Love Triangle." The frenzied 45-
minute circuit of styles makes pigeonholing Frente! kind of
hard.
Then, perhaps it's best to leave it to Austin and Hart to
characterize their music.
"It's a lazy label, but we like to call it 'jazzy pop,'" Hart
says, taking a shot.
"It's'jazzy pop,' " Austin concurs. "It's kind of thoughtful.
We're happy and sad. We're kind of for dancing around a bit.
But, yeah, 'jazzy pop' is pretty close."
Close on the heels of the futile attempts to capture
Frentei's craft in word is ample acclaim and an ever-growing
base of fans. Back home in Australia, accolades — including
being selected by a Rolling Stone/Australia Readers' Poll as
Best New Band — have been accompanied by indie-chart
topping success. Over here, word is getting out, as compli
mentary reviews are hitting newsstands just as their first hit,
the "Bizarre, Love Triangle" cover, is getting loads of airplay
on modern rock radio. The two see this exposure as a step to

wards getting their un-mainstream music to the American
masses.
"I think the best part of the American scene is its vibrant
support of things that are new. Since this place is so big, you
have whole subcultures that's so into new stuff that a band
like us can come over here and feel really good. There's a vibe
over here that you can do anything you like," Austin points
out.
"It's like anything when it's new," Hart chime* in. "People
get really excited about it and then kind of miss hearing it for
a while (when it's not being played]. Then, once it becomes
a regular thing, [people) get really used to hearing it and it
gets in (their) head. So you've got to swing for a while until
.. . " she pauses and concludes, only to punctuate the unfin
ished thought with a "you know?"
P is for the growing pains
Despite the fact that Frentel's rise to the top of the alter
native scene here in the United States has been lightning
quick, the band has had its share of hardships and gone
through its share of phases. After all, the members of Frente!
have been around since 1988. While they're pleased with
what they've achieved to date, Frente! feels the same uncer
tainties and self-conscious doubts nice people in a young
band are apt to feel.
"|Winning awards and gaining acclaim| is a two-way
thing. At first, it's 'wow!' " Austin relates. "Next week, you
think, 'There's going to be a huge backlash and they're going
to hate us.' And also, [you think,) 'How are we going to equal

that?' Then there's, 'How
are you going to get that feel
ing again?' "

"People can get really funny about [suc
cess]," Hart adds. "Once you get to that
stage, they assume you get too big for your

o / / o c /
boots. It can get realiy harsh."
The vocalist explains by example, detailing
the response back home to the sugary pop song

"Accidentally Kelly Street." What was meant to be a tongue
in-cheek pop ditty drew some ire. Hart notes that "people
|demanded], 'How dare they put out something like this!' "
In some senses, such scrutiny has made Frente! cautious.
"It gets to the point that you feel guilty if you do some
thing good," Austin says. "You think, 'I don't want to have
fun.' Because if they write anything bad about you, you're
going to be shattered. If you never have fun, you can never be
disappointed."
Nothing unnatural
Still, Frente! has emerged from such obstacles stronger
and better for wear. According to Austin, focusing on the
natural joys of music making has helped the band to contin
ue and flourish.
"When you're doing the touring thing, you really lose
sight of it," Austin reflects. "You just forget what's really good
about it. Those really amazing shows or those nice moments
in the studio when something is incredible. . . . The good
things about this are those moments."
Yet perhaps Hart puts it best when she puts it simply.
"I love singing," she tells as she lights up with a chuckle. ■

For those of you who missed Frente! or really liked their set, the
Aussies willl be buck in town June 10 at Shoreline Jor the big
Live 105 shindig. They'll be touring all summer us well, both
headlining on their own and opening for Counting (".rows.
