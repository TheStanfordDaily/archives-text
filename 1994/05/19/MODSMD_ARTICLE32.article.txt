# Taking a stab at Shakespeare 'Othello' means senior project for threesome
## 
### Allison Amend 
Too often, the name Shakespeare con
jures up images of Englishmen danc
ing around in tights or boring classes
required for an English degree. But to seniors
Ross McCall, Tineke Van Berckelaer and
Scott Smith, Shakespeare means their senior
project, to which they've devoted the past
two months of their life.
In cooperation with the Stanford Drama
Department, the three seniors arc perform
ing "Othello," one of Shakespeare's best
known plays. In addition to portraying the
three main characters, Van Berckelaer and
Smith are co-producing the play, while Mc-
Call is the dramaturge.
The actors/producers agree that being in
volved in the production aspect of the play
adds an additional challenge to just acting in
it. It's a great experience "to look at the other
side" of play production, explains Van Berck
elaer. "You can really see it come together. We
were in on the casting, and we are part of the
artistic staff." Director and Visiting Lecturer
Winter Mead emphasizes the difficulty of
acting and producing a show. "They really

feel pulled in different directions.
It has been difficult until three
weeks ago."
But production is not the only
challenging aspect of this project.
Mead highlights the popularity of
the play as raising the expectations
of the audience. "We have to sus
tain a sense of the audience feeling
that they're not sure what will
happen, that at any moment it will
fall apart."
"Othello" is the well known
story of the Moorish-general Oth
ello who, called to action in
Venice, falls in love with Dcsde
mona, the wealthy, white daugh
ter of an influential Venetian.
They marry and run off to the
war's front in Cyprus. There, Oth
ello passes over his right-hand
man and obvious choice for the
promotion to lieutenant, lago,
awarding the position to Cassio, a
mere newcomer to the army.
Director Mead likens the event
to "a Vietnam vet getting passed
over for promotion by a smart-ass
college kid." lago, angry at his for
mer friend, begins to spread ru
mors of Desdemona's infidelity. In
true Shakespearean tragedy, the

ending is predictable, but, as always, surpris
ing and satisfying.
The play provides potential pitfalls for in
experienced actors. "The entire first half is
just lago, while the second half is Othello and
Desdemona. It has to be about real love, tran
scending race or what her parents say, yet
they're never on stage together," explains
Mead.
McCall says that the role of lago — "per
haps the greatest villain ever" — is daunting.
"I want to end my tenure at Stanford on a
high note Still, for someone with as little
experience as me to play someone like lago
(is unusual]. I hope I can find the spark that
will push me over the top."
Van Berckelaer agrees. "Desdemona is
such an interesting character. Shakespeare
didn't write a lot of parts for women. Plus,
she dared stand up to society and go with the
man she loved, even though she might be an

outcast for it."
Indeed, racial issues emerge as some of the
most powerful themes in the play, themes
which the actors suggest are equally prob
lematic today. "It's not only about relation
ships in Shakespeare's time, but about rela
tionships today," says Van Berckelaer.
McCall, too, agrees that the relationships
cast a modern light on a play that is more
than 400 years old. "They are talking about
what is a man and what is a woman. It's
amazing how much alike it is, we are having
those conversations today."
But all three would like to stress the other
ways in which the play extends, keeping its
relevancy for today's world. The militaristic
presence in the play is obvious. "The audi
ence can identify a military state. It's like the
war in Kuwait," says Mead.
To this end, Mead has costumed the army
in modern U.S. Marines uniforms. Students

from ROTC have come in to each the ensem
ble how to stand, how to move, in short
"army etiquette," Van Berckelaer explains.
In fact, the whole play is set in modern
times, with modern costumes and props. Van
Berckelaer explains this decision was partly be
cause of the space constraints on stage. It is per
formed in the Nitery, known for its intimacy.
Plus, Mead adds, "Shakespeare should never
be set in another time [other than modern]
unless you're eliminating something essential."
Otherwise, it just distracts the audience.
They have also made the play more acces
sible to the audience by adding realistic fight
scenes, which make an otherwise dry play full
of action.
Everyone involved is pleased with the way
the play has coalesced. "This is unique; the
senior project is usually a vanity piece, a one
man show. This combines three people with
great Shakespearean roles. The students are
sweating a lot more details; it's going to prove
useful to them."
Van Berckelaer calls the project "the cul
mination of my educational experience." Mc-

Call agrees. "Early on, I was not
getting good feedback, audition
ing for a lot of stuff and not get
ting it" But then he joined Stan
ford Improvisers (SIMPS) and
feels more "prepared. This is a
catharsis. This is what I love to do.
I'm stretching my artistic limbs."
For Mead, this a kind of last
hurrah. Having seen McCall and
others act since they were fresh
men, this is "a culmination of a lot
of superb work. It's great to see
how talented they are. It's
poignant, saying good-bye to
these guys. It's the last thing we get
to do with them," says Mead. As a
director at Stanford, he is interest
ed less in the success of the play,
but more in "better acting, com
munity-based theater," though he
is quick to add, "They're all so
good, it will be successful." ■
