# Livin' in 'Crooklyn' Spike's trip down memory lane

Ask Spike Lee if there's anything he
loves more than making movies and
the only thing he'll come up with is
watching basketball. He may root for Ewing
and be down with Jordan, but if he actually
played the game, he'd resemble the Tourette's
Syndrome-afflicted Denver Nuggets star
Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf — cursed with the
need to keep shooting. And making the shot
isn't what counts, either. Before they've re
leased the ball, both men are already visualiz
ing their next attempt.
Keep 'em coming, that's all that matters.
And keep 'em coming Spike does, with the
style and showmanship that befits today's
trash-talking NBA superstars as well as their
equally brash Hollywood counterparts. Oliv
er Stone may produce movies faster, Madon
na may sell herself better, but rest assured:
both icons know that if they even think about
half-steppin', Spike Lee is less than a half-step
away.
His latest film, "Crooklyn," has just gone
into wide release, but Lee's" already in pre
production on his next film, "dockers." He's
cast Harvey Keitel, John Turturro and

Delroy Lindo in key roles,
all under the executive

producing savvy of his idol, director Martin
Scorsese. Based on the best-selling book by
novelist-screenwriter Richard Price ("Sea of
Love"), its searing tale of cops-n'-crack deal
ers in the New Jersey housing projects
promises to simultaneously redefine the
'hood movie and strip away our illusions
about the state of race relations in America.
"Clockers" is far from the only iron in Lee's
fire. He now teaches two classes at Harvard —
one in African-American film, the other in
screenwriting — with an office right next to
department chair and noted African-Ameri
can scholar Dr. Henry Louis Gates. He pub
lishes a line of comic books in association
with Dark Horse Comics. His most recent
venture? Creating an advertising agency in
association with heavy-hitters BBDO World
wide. White America may not have given
Lee's ancestors their 40 acres and a mule, but
it can be damn sure that Lee is going to get his
— by any means necessary.
Of course, none of this guarantees great
filmmaking every time he steps to the plate.

Every director has had his share of spectacu
lar misfires: Martin Scorsese's "New York,
New York," Oliver Stone's "Heaven and
Earth" Steven Spielberg's "1941" and in the
case of Robert Altman, virtually every other
movie. And now, the man who once pub
lished a retrospective of his films called "l ive
for Five" may finally have to admit that he no
longer bats 1.000. Yes, Spike Lee joins the elite
with "Crooklyn," which is unarguably his
worst film to date
A screeching halt
The year 1994 finds Spike Lee at a cross
roads: once you've made your dream film,
what do you do for an encore? The anger that
so terrified white audiences hasn't been evi-

dent in his work since "Do the
Right Thing;" even the fiery
opening credit se-

quence of
"Malcolm
X" /

seems out of place given the rest of the film.
Where the '89 Lee raised his fist to the music
of Public Enemy, the '94 Lee is more apt to
bob his head to Arrested Development. Even
his off-camera personality, at interviews and
press conferences — like the one he gave at
the San Francisco International Film Festival
last week (see sidebar) — is more relaxed,
more measured, even somewhat bored. He's
even had to scare up a missionary fervor as to
why the film should be made: to show that
black people don't all live under the threat of
death in the inner city.
There seems to be the beginnings of an im
pulse to get out of the 'hood among some
black filmmakers, lohn Singleton fled the
mythical killing fields of South Central for the
equally homicidal pastures of Oakland in
"Poetic Justice, 1 " finding some measure of
peace only on the highway between the two
bloody points on his road map. Lee, like his
fellow New Yorker Matty Rich, seems to be
lieve that the only safe haven is in the past
namely the 70s. But you can't take this partic
ular city boy out of the city, so where Rich's
"The Inkwell" manages to escape the city lim
its for idyllic Martha's Vineyard, Lee stays put
on the front stoop of his beloved Brooklyn.
As a screenwriter, Lee has generally es
chewed linear, classical Hollywood structure.
But the semi-autobiographical "Crooklyn"
screenplay, which he co-wrote with sister Joie
and brother Cinque indulges this tendency
past the point of no return. It's a disjointed
compilation of the home movies playing in
Spike Lee's head, remade with a talented cast
and projected at a cineplex near you — a
compilation that never adds up into a $7 ex
perience.
A 4 crooked * direction
The story centers around a family in 1970s
Brooklyn, New York. Carolyn (Alfre
Woodard) struggles to keep her family going
while her proud musician husband Woody
(Delroy Lindo) refusestoaccept payinggigs i!
he can't play "his music." Their five children
can't seem to get with the program, speeding
around the house, refusing to eat their black
eyed peas, playing the dozens on the street
and leaving a mess in their wake.
This might seem sweetly nostalgic, but the
first 20 minutes of "Crooklyn" are hell to
watch. Carolyn's confrontations with her kids
are played at a fever pitch that makes every
one— including her — come off as abrasive
infants. Add to this a high-decibel recording
of "Love Makes the World Go Around" on
the soundtrack that competes with the dia
logue for prominence, coupled with a free
wheeling MTV/"Rcal World" shaky-cam and
you've got the making of a "Cosby Show'
episode on steroids.
Eventually, the film settles down slightly to
focus on 10-year-old Troy (newcomer Zelda
Harris), and Lee's style changes from faux-re
ality to urban magic realism. It's as if Gabriel
Garcia-Marquez or Isabel Allende snuck be
hind the camera.
Troy watches a towering RuPaul in Daz/ey
Duk shorts grind against a Puerto Rican gro
cer in the canned foods aisle — in crystal
clear slow motion — as a slinky salsa song
(Joe Cuba's "I'll Never Go Back to Georgia")
plays on the soundtrack. Troy mistakes a cor
ner of her room for the bathroom. Troy has a
nightmare in which the neighborhood glue
sniffers — one of them played by Lee — chase
her down the street and put a paper bag filled
with airplane glue over her face, then sit back
and laugh as she floats up into the clouds. It's
a lively twist on one of Lee's most famous sig
