# Spike speaks
## Sound bites from the director's seat 
### Victor Haseman N'Gai Croal 
Last week at the San Francisco Film
Festival, Spike Lee held a press con
ference in conjunction with the
world premiere of "Crooklyn." Framed
against the backdrop of an American Hag
flying from the roof of a building adjacent
to the Pan Pacific hotel, Lee waxed bored
with a variety of Bay Area journalists for
about 45 minutes. We could have written it
up as an interview, but we'd be lying if we
did that. Here are a few of the things he
said.
On the autobiographical nature of the film
"Well, you have the basic structure
where you have this family in Brooklyn in
the early '70s — the father's a musician, the
mother's a teacher, four boys, one girl —
that happened. My mother died of cancer
— that happened. But the rest of that stuff
is just fiction. No dog ever popped up out
of a sofa."
On the distorted sequence in the film
"Troy, who's never been out of Brooklyn
— probably never been off that block that
much — is now in a whole new world: trees
and grass and fresh air and crickets, she's in
a strange house down south where people
talk funny and her aunt is crazy. So the au
dience is seeing the world the way Troy sees
it down south."
On collaborating with his brother and sis
ter
"It was my sister's idea. She came to me
and said '1 got this idea,' and 1 said why
don't you write it, instead of telling me

about it. Well she got together with
my brother Cinque and they wrote
the first draft and they let me read

it — not really thinking that I
wanted to do it. And I read

and I said, 'I like this a lot
and I would like to con
tribute to this script — I
wanna make this film.' So
that's how it happened."

On whether the film could have
taken place today

" 'Crooklyn' could have taken
place today, but it would not have
been the same film. I mean
there's no Clocks and UZIs and
AK-47s in 'Crooklyn.' There's
nothing called crack in 'Crook-

lyn' — it's airplane glue. That's
the point, man. Two entirely
different childhoods, chil-

dren growing in the seven
ties and children growing
up now. So how could it

be the same film? No
way.'

On the film's message for young kids
"1 hope young people will see that there
was a time before they were born where
they could play in the streets, they could
run up and down in the streets, without
worrying about having to get struck down
by a bullet. There was a time when children
didn't have to deal with life and death mat
ters. Growing up, my big worry was the
homework I had due.
That's a very important point — some
thing they don't realize. It wasn't always like
this. A lot of them don't know that. They
think it was always like this. They think that
they always had metal detectors in schools.
Or that if you bumped into someone acci
dentally, and stepped on their brand new
sneakers you'd get shot. That stuff is new."
On Jews in America
"Well, I don't think that Jewish people
are a threat, or the reason for the position
African-Americans find themselves in
today. That might be what Khalid Muham
mad and Farrakhan say, but that's not the
way 1 see things, and 1 really think a lot of
that stuff has been blown out of propor
tion. So 1 just try to stay out of that."
On Jews in Hollywood
"1 really don't know how to answer that
question to be honest. It's not something I
subscribe to. I mean, I've never seen Jewish
people being the bogeyman. Are you here

to talk about "Crooklyn" or to try to
drag me into this whole black/Jewish
thing?

On Jews financing his movies
"She's Gotta Have It" 1 raised the money
myself. "School Daze" I got the money
from Columbia Pictures. "Do the Right
Thing," "Mo' Better Blues," "Jungle Fever,"
the money came from Universal. "Malcolm
X"— the money came from JVC and
Warner Bros. Universal has financed
"Crooklyn" and "Clockers." 1 mean if you
want to be honest about it, Universal/MCA
is owned by the Japanese. So is Colum
bia/Tri-Star.
On what the film means to him
" 'Crooklyn' just demonstrates the dif
ferent types of films that I want to make —
that I will make. That not everything's
going to deal with racism in this country. It
shows the versatility that I have in the types
of films I can make and the types of films I
will make in the future."
On working with Martin Scorsese on
"Clockers"
"Its going to be a pleasure. He's going to
exec produce the film. He's not going to be
around because he's gonna be shooting his
own film, 'Casino,' at the same time. But I
know that we'll be able to get some helpful
input from him during the post-produc
tion period." ■
