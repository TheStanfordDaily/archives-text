# Tom Robbins meets Gus Van Sant
## The 						disappointing result is still worth watching 
### 
When Tom Robbins first conceived of
"Even Cowgirls Get the Blues," he intended to
write a screenplay, but soon abandoned this
project because he didn't know anything
about script-writing. When word got out
that Gus Van Sant had approached the author
on a film version, expectations ran high.
Unfortunately, for the most part, "Even
Cowgirls Get the Blues" is a disappointment It
maybe that expectations were too high: not only
did Van Sant's "Drugstore Cowboy" and "My
Own Private Idaho" intensely impact the film
industry with their larger-than-life caricatures,
but Tom Robbins' original text "Even Cowgirls
Get the Blues" stormed the nation when it first
came out in the '70s. One would expect that to
gether, Robbins and Van Sant should have been
able to create a masterpiece.
Sadly, this is not the case. As a movie,
"Even Cowgirls Get the Blues" misses the
mark — it's seemingly disheveled and too
disconnected. While Van Sant individually
creates incredible scenes, they never com
pletely mesh or bring character and theme
development to fruition. At the beginning of
the movie, we see heroine Sissy Hankshaw
(Uma Thurman), oversized thumbs and all,
being told her fortune by Madame Zoe: yes,
Sissy will have men in her life but she will also
have women. Implication: Sissy will always
be a "freak."
By the middle of the movie, Sissy leads an
irregular lifestyle on the road, and in three,
practically consecutive scenes, goes from mas
turbating while thinking of her full-blooded
Native American beau Julian Giche, to making
love to cowgirl Bonanza Jellybean, and then to
sleeping with the wiseman-on-the-mountain,
the Chink. Wham-bam. Keep the change.
There's really no explanation as to what com
pels Sissy to these three individuals.

Arguably, the idea
of the freedom of
movement fuels
Sissy's wanderlust
and enables her to
glide through life.
And it would appear
that all fingers point
to this theme
throughout the
movie — the con
stant roadtripping by
Sissy and her ability
to see herself not as a
freak, the struggle of
the cowgirls against
the oppressive femi
nine hygiene king,
the Countess, and
their seizure of his
beauty spa, Rubber
Rose Ranch, and the
temporary captivity
of the whooping
cranes — these sto
ries center on the re
pressed/oppressed
breaking loose and
overcoming the ob-

stacks which stifle love, happiness and true
identity.
However, the theme of freedom of move
ment is on the periphery, and "Even Cowgirls
Get the Blues" merely scratches the surface.
Some of the deep philosophy of the original
never comes through in the film medium.
Only snippets of literal prose genius, or in this
case, cowgirl poetry, make it on the screen.
Dolores Del Ruby's third peyote vision, Bo
nanza Jellybean's ranch rhetoric to Sissy —
these are a few of the moments when "Even

Cowgirls Get the Blues" dives deeper than the
usual composite sketching that goes on
throughout the movie.
"Moments" is definitely the operative
word. Even if one ignores the book-to- movie
comparison, Van Sant still comes out with
mere moments of genius. Scenes of Sissy in
New York City, of the Countess drinking Red
Ripple and of Sissy in the hospital illustrate
Van Sant's film mastery. Each scene in itself is
a work of art. But this intensity simply renews
itself from time to time and not perpetually.

For this reason, "Even Cowgirls Gets the
Blues" should not be dismissed and over
looked. Admittedly, Van Sant's earlier works
are not exactly the kind of stuff you can sit
down to and devour; the digestive process goes
slowly. And perhaps, "Even Cowgirls Get the
Blues" should be viewed with the same con
sideration in mind. Yet keep in mind this is
certainly not Van Sant's finest work. Compart
mentally, "Even Cowgirls Gets the Blues" suc
ceeds, but holistically, it fails.
