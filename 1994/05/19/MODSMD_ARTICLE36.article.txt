## Cronos 
### 
Writer/director Guillermo del Toro's
debut film, Crones, is a stylistic and satisfy
ing Mexican variation of the vampire horror
story. Unlike other recent attempts in this
genre (recall Francis Ford Coppola's "Bram
Stoker's Dracula"), "Cronos" is well-paced
and consistendy intriguing. It boasts an ele
gant sense of rhythm, moving from the
hauntingly macabre to the absurdly
grotesque, while maintaining a lively and of
tentimes comic tone. Although some ele
ments of melodrama surface periodically,
they resolve themselves nicely and are only
minor blemishes in a story that overall is sur
prisingly fresh.
The tale begins in
1536, when an
aging alchemist,
fleeing the Spanish
Inquisition, travels
to Vera Cruz with a
fantastical golden
egg capable of pro
longing and regen
erating life. Around
500 years later a
white-haired an
tique store owner

discovers the cronos device in the base of a
statue. By accident, Jesus Gris (Frederico
Luppi) learns its secret and finds himself de
veloping an overwhelming craving for blood.
It seems other people would like to obtain
the cronos device as well. An ugly American
named Angel de la Guardia (Ron Perlman)
searches relentlessly for the golden egg in the
hopes of saving his dominating uncle, Dieter,
from his inevitable death. Even Jesus' grand
daughter, Aurora, has a vested interest in se
curing the artifact; for by doing so she thinks
(naiveiy) that she can save Jesus from the
progressively disturbing changes taking
place in his character.
What results is an entertaining collision of
wills and an engaging storyline that persists
up to the eerily peaceful conclusion. Del Toro
builds upon this solid foundation by his ex
otic, mysterious settings: the antiques shop,
the cremation parlor and especially Dieter's
excruciatingly sterilized apartment, which
only intensifies the film's undercurrent of
perverse compulsion. At times the perfor
mances may seem shallow, but as a whole
they balance themselves nicely between the
overwrought and the ridiculous. "Cronos" is
an intelligent and stylistic film that leaves the
audience thinking well after the final scene
has faded from the screen.
