# The 						Crow
## 
### 
"The Crow" is one of those movies that
everyone is rooting for. At least as a tribute to
the star Brandon Lee, whose tragic accidental
death delayed completion of the film, we
would hope that first time film director Alex
Proyas could somehow pull a winner out of
his hat. Not going to happen, folks.
Local rocker Eric Draven, played passion
ately by Lee, and his fianc£ (Sofia Shinas) are
ruthlessly murdered on the eve of their wed
ding day which also happens to be Devil's
Night, the eve of Halloween. One year later,
Draven is resurrected in human form, but with
superhuman powers, to set right the wrongs
that were done to him and his fianc£. Disguised
as a Robert Smith of the Cure look-alike and
under the watchful eye of a huge black crow —
his source of power and link between the living
and the realm of the dead — Draven enacts re
venge on those responsible for his pain.
Does he succeed? Yes.
Is there anything more to the movie? No.
"The Crow" was originally based on James
O'Barr's black-and-white comic book of the
same name. Maybe this explains why the
gothic, dark and gloomy unknown city looks
exactly like a set. Maybe this explains why the
crow flying through the air has a striking re

semblance to a cartoon. The film noir touch
is nice, except that you often find yourself
straining to sec what is happening.
What a waste of some intriguing charac
ters. Lee is ideal as the mysterious, sexy, witty
hero who quotes poetry as he finds creative
ways to kill the bad guys. As the repulsive
head of the villains, Michael Wincott is fan
tastically despicable. Even the rest of the bad
guy crew played by David Patrick Kelly, Angel
David, Lawrence Mason and Michael Massee
are raunchy enough to make anyone squirm.
What a waste of a perfect soundtrack. While
enchantingly dark and mood setting, the music
doesn't add that much-needed plot twist.
What a waste of money. With a plot as pre
dictable and unoriginal as "The Crow," not
even wishful thinking can save this movie.
