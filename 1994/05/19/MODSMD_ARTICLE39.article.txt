# In with the 'Experimental Jet Set'
## More haunting dissonance from Sonic Youth 
### 
"And it's out / and it's not / what you
thought it was about," intones Thurston
Moore during "Winner's Blues," the opening
number of Sonic Youth's newest album, "Ex
perimental Jet Set, Trash and No Star." The
irony of these words becomes evident upon a
first listening. Compared to the big sound of
its last release, "Dirty," "Experimental Jet
Set" is quieter, darker, reminiscent of their
earlier albums like "EVOI" and "Sister."
Where some might have expected a fur
ther mutation more suited to a commercial
audience, Sonic Youth has refused to com
promise. After more than 10 years of setting
a musical standard of dissonance, Sonic
Youth still delivers, and it's evident with this
release that it hasn't forgotten its roots.
In an interview a while back, Moore said
something to the effect that he just plays gui
tar in a punk band. In many ways "Experi
mental Jet Set" reflects this sentiment. The
latest album is suffused with references to
punk culture. "Screaming Skull," a song
about browsing in the SST Superstore, is also
a tribute to Pat Smear, former guitarist for
the Germs. Other songs, like "Waist" and
"Self-Obsessed and Sexxee," allude to differ
ent aspects of "the scene." But the image that
results is hardly salutary.
Of course, every review has taken its turn
on guessing the possible meaning of the title
— one article in Rolling Stone attributed the
words to different members of the band. Per
sonally, the title recalls the voices which pop
ulate the dark and fragmentary world evoked
by the music.
This album is Sonic Youth's most mini
malistic release yet. The wall of sound of
"Dirty" has deflated. "Winner's Blues," with
its single acoustic guitar is the most extreme
example. Even the single "Bull in the
Heather" is pretty sparse. The sound only

opens up while Kim
Gordon chants the
verse, like she's hint
ing at the repetitive
ness of a prostitute's
depressed sexuality.
Other songs, like
"Slunk" and "Quest
for the Cup," continue
this trend... but then
of course there's the
dissonant noise.
The album for the
most part alternates
between songs sung
by Moore and those
sung by Gordon. The
other guitarist, Lee
Ranaldo, doesn't
sing on this album to
the disappointment
of a number of fans.
While the songs by
Gordon tend to be
slower and quieter,
Thurston comes on
with the noise. It
kicks in with
"Starficld Road"
which sounds like it
could get alien radio
play (file under
chrome). "Scream
ing Skull" opens
with something that

sounds like a lion roaring.
But, it's the song "Androgynous Mind,"
that speaks the gospel of Sonic Youth. Tune in
on this — it's in the spirit of earlier songs
such as Sister's "Catholic Block" or EVOL's
"Star Power." Just add some plutonium to the
Len -onheads' "Big Gay Heart" and shake. I'm

already flinching at that comparison, but this
song takes sexuality to another dimension
and brings it back home. It's time to give this
some radio play.
Still, it's unlikely that this album will actu
ally get much air play. But whether this album
is popular doesn't matter. It's enough that it
exists as the next installment in the career of

one of the best bands in the alternative canon.
If you're unfamiliar with their earlier al
bums, Geffen will be re-releasing them. "Day
dream Nation," considered by many to be a
masterpiece, is already out. "Confusion is
Sex," the spooky "Bad Moon Rising" and
"EVOL" are to be re-released May 24.
