# Students, officials condemn vandalism
## 
### Burt Herman Editorial staff 
A chorus of University officials
and student leaders spoke out yes
terday about the alleged vandal
ism of the "Gay Liberation" sculp
ture that could have seven varsity
athletes facing felony charges.

"Defacing any
art is a senseless
act," University
President Ger
hard Casper said
in a statement is
sued yesterday.
"And to whatever
extent this may
have been a dis
play of intoler-

ance, it is particularly unaccept
able, and I roundly condemn it."
Junior Dusty Allen, junior
Mark Butterfield, sophomore
Robert Gardner, junior Thomas
Irwin, junior Todd Laßocca,
freshman Brendan Sullivan and
sophomore Jason White were ar
rested earlier this week for al
legedly damaging the George

Segal sculpture.
Police found the sculpture cov
ered in black paint with a bench
rammed between two of the white
coated bronze figures at around 2
a.m. Monday.
The citations issued Monday
for misdemeanor vandalism have
been canceled in light of the fact
that the athletes could now be
charged with a felony, Stanford
Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer said.
Gardner, Butterfield and
White will also be charged with re
sisting arrest for allegedly run
ning from police.
The Santa Clara District Attor
ney's office will review the com
pleted police report today and
have charges ready this morning,
according to Stanford Police Sgt.
John McMullen. Felony charges
can be filed if the damage to the
$150,000 sculpture exceeds
$5,000.
The Athletic Department has
already taken disciplinary action
against some of the athletes in

volved in the incident, according
to a statement released yesterday.
Allen, Gardner, Lallocca and
Sullivan are members of the Car
dinal baseball team. Butterfield
and White are members of the
Stanford football team, and Irwin
is a varsity wrestler.
"I will work with the coaches
involved to determine the disci
plinary action for their student
athletes," Athletic Director Ted
Leland said in the statement.
"This abhorrent behavior will
simply not be tolerated."
The athletes will be asked to
receive special counseling on "the
diversity of lifestyles," Leland

said.
Baseball coach Mark Marquess
also issued a statement yesterday
saying he will be taking disci
plinary action against the players
but is keeping the details private.
"The actions of the baseball
players involved in this incident
[are] completely unacceptable
behavior and will not be tolerat
ed," he said. "The players have
already acknowledged their mis
take, have agreed to make restitu
tion and apologized for what
they've done. .. . But, rest
assured, I will not sit back and not
respond to this situation."
One of the athlete's coaches,
however, said he believes the stu
dents' actions were merely inno
cent fooling around which does
not deserve the attention that
they have been receiving.

"I think the whole thing's been
blown out of proportion, but when
you say 'athlete' and 'gay,' you're
going to make headlines,"
wrestling coach Chris Horpel said
in yesterday's San Jose Mercury
News.
"Stanford students are almost
force-fed political correctness. I
don't think people feel too strong
ly about any of these issues," he
said. "I think what they did was
just sort of a reaction.
"The irony is that in a three
hour period in the middle of the
night, they painted the statue, got
caught and cleaned it all up," Hor
pel said. "So basically there
would've been no record of any
thing happening, but the police
felt obligated to make sure every
one knew."
But members of the Lesbian,

Gay and Bisexual Community
Center do not dismiss the action
so lightly.
"We are awaiting the Universi
ty's response to this serious hate
crime," they said yesterday. "We
expect the University to pursue
appropriate judicial action that
will make it clear that bigotry is
unacceptable and will not be toler
ated on the Stanford campus."
The University Judicial Affairs
Office will be receiving a com
plaint regarding the students'
alleged actions and will be investi
gating whether the students vio
lated the Fundamental Standard.
Because all seven athletes are
affiliated with fraternities, the
Greek judicial board will also be
investigating the alleged crime to
determine whether the fraterni
ties share any responsibility.
