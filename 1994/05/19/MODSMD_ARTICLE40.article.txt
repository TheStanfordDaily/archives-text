## "Twenty-first Century Jesus" Messiah 
### 
So Messiah recorded on White labels. Big
deal. If you're looking for some hardcore
techno stuff to listen or dance to, you will
probably not find it on Messiah's new album.
There's something fundamentally insubstan
tial about "Twenty-First Century Jesus." In
"Beyond Good and Evil," for example, Messi
ah samples the lines: "Brother, sister... open
your heart up and your mind," "Throw your
hands in the air and wiggle like you just don't
care," and"The future, the future is ours!"

Morality in a techno
tune? Arguably, Niet
zsche could have
been a raver — but
can Messiah handle
philosophy? Um, not
really.
And that's simply
the first song on the
album. The second,

"There is no law," was described by Messiah
as "the song they would not play because it
was too heavy for the radio." (Oh, the rene
gade spirit of the techno/rave scene!)
It seems that Messiah really wants to lump
all the lame, media-generated anti-establish
ment hype surrounding raves into one pack
age deal. "On this recording, music specifical
ly recorded for its pleasurable effects upon
your mind, body, and spirit is used to carry
the suggestions for change directly to your
subconscious mind. Consciously, all that you
will be aware of is beautiful music... .Let go."
Well, I admit I've come out a different person
after this aural experience. Now, I'm certain
about at least one thing: Messiah sucks.
OK, so this is harsh — but sorry, Messiah
overall fails to improve on the techno tradition
of trippy, innovative sampling. In addition to
its composition of "Let's sec how much ran
dom stuff we can throw together and call cool
techno" songs, Messiah's album features a re
make of "Temple of the Dreams." Overall,
Messiah's "Twenty-First Century Jesus" is top
-40, Live 105 techno. It's evcryman's techno —
at best, super-fast video-game music, and at
worst, simply crazy-wacked new-age music.
