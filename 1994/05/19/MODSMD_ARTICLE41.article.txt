# "The White Birch" Codeine
## 
### 
Codeine is one of those bands that com
pels you to use a lot of big adjectives. The
music on "The White Birch" just sounds
huge coming out of your stereo. With only
three members, they create enormous, ma
jestic sounds that reach directly into your
mind and command it to stop, lay back, close
your eyes, and languish in their slow, mea
sured intensity.
Codeine plays at about 45-50 bpm, which
is really, really, EXTREMELY slow. The band
is absolutely minimal, with quiet, droning
guitar, bass, sparse drumming, sometimes
words, and a lot of silence. They spend a lot
of time letting the guitars ring, quietly wait
ing for the next measure so they can play an
other note. The instruments seem calculated
to use the minimum possible number of
notes and sounds necessary to get the point
across.
Most reviewers seem to think Codeine's
music is suited for long, slow rainy days
locked up alone in a small dark room after

your girlfriend or boyfriend dumps you. In
other words, depressing. But I found it to be
sort of the opposite. The songs are slow and
dark and moody, but in a very cathartic,
cleansing way. They're beautiful and uplift
ing, with the satisfied acceptance one feels
after recovering from depression.
Musically, Codeine borrows a hell of a lot
from indie-rock's favorite influence, Slint.
Some of the songs, like "Wird," imitate their
trademark whispered vocals. Many use Slint's
sparse, minor-key guitar lines. Most notice
able, however, is Codeine's use of their revered
mega-dynamic ethic. After each long, druggy,
drowsy verse, guitarist John Engle hits the dis
tortion pedal and the guitar volume virtually
triples, while the bass and drums stoically
maintain the tranquilized rhythm.
Utterly unlike Slint, however, is the rich
production on "The White Birch." The gui
tars virtually leap out of the speakers, and
Stephen Immerwahr's sparse vocals pene
trate through the instruments despite their
quiet, almost-murmured tone. There are
some minor studio infractions, like multiple
guitar and vocal tracks, but in the end it adds
a lot to this very clean and beautiful album.
