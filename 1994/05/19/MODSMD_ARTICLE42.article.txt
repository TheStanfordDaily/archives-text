# A 						tasty Little Garden
## Far more Vietnamese flavor than meets the eye 
### Justin Pollard 
You remember the old saying,
"Don't judge a restaurant by its
outward appearance"? Well it cer
tainly applies to Little Garden, one
of the best Vietnamese and Chi
nese restaurants in the area.
Housed in a slightly run-down, ex
drive-up burger joint with a cov
ered parking lot, Little Garden
proves that what really matters is
what goes on in the kitchen.
The decor, red tassles hanging
from ornate lamps and pictures of
entries on the wall, may not be ro
mantic enough for a first date, but
when you're ready to impress that
special someone with your knowl
edge of obscure yet tasty locales,
you're ready for Little Garden.
The menu is very reasonably
priced, especially considering the
generous portions of the dishes.

In addition to the traditional of
ferings of most Szechuan restau
rants, Little Garden's Vietnamese
owners provide many delicious
and less familiar dishes from their
home country. For vegetarians,
there are 23 dishes available with
out meat.
We started off with an order of
imperial rolls (4 for $3.75), the
Vietnamese version of egg rolls
which are far superior in taste.
Served over a bed of lettuce and
stuffed with pork, cabbage, and
other vegetables, the rolls are
wrapped with paper thin dough
which turns very crispy and golden
brown when lightly fried.
Next we had a bowl of bun ga
chua ($5.50), a Vietnamese hot
and sour soup made with chicken,
rice noodles, tomatoes, and

pineapples, over a tomato base.
Watch out for the green chile pep
pers. It's a unique combination of
spicy and sweet, somewhat remi
niscent of Thai soups like torn kha
gai. Another great Vietnamese
soup is bun nuoc ken ($5.50),
which is a yellow curry and co
conut milk base with shrimp and
rice noodles. Both soups are enor
mous and fill six individual soup
bowls.
For the main dishes we had mu
shu chicken ($5.75) and squid with
curry and coconut milk ($6.95). I
have found that one can judge the
quality of a Chinese restaurant by
how good their mu shu is, and Lit
tle Garden passed this test with fly
ing colors. The chicken was tender
and succulent, and the homemade
hoisin sauce was delicious. The

squid, on the other
hand was one of the
few dishes I have had
here which left some
thing to be desired.
While the sauce was
delicious, the blend
of seasonings subtle
and very comple
mentary, the squid it
self was a bit tough
and chewy.
The experience of
dining at The Little
Garden is made even
more enjoyable by ex
cellent service. The
staff is extremely

friendly, water glasses are filled fre
quently, and the timing of delivery
was perfect. I particularly liked the
fact that even main dishes are

served as different courses and are
brought out one at a time. If you try
Little Garden once, it won't be long
before you come back for more.
