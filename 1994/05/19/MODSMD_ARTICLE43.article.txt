### 
Backßeat
"Backßeat" is a Beatle movie even
the most fickle fan will enjoy. De
spite a few historical inaccuracies,
director lain Softley does an ad
mirable job of reconstructing the
band's early days in Hamburg when
the Fab Four were the Fab Five. Of
note are the live music scenes
which capture what it must have
been like to see the Beatles before
they got big. R
Bad Girls
The title says it all: "Bad Girls" really
is bad. Despite vaunting itself as the
first female-centered frontier shoot
'em up, director Jonathan Kaplan
does nothing more than crib scenes
from classic Westerns that fill the
movie with aimless action instead of
plot or relevant issues. So don't let
its claim to the top spot at the box of
fice fool you — after all, "Ace Ventu
ra" was there for weeks. R
Being Human
"Being Human" is about, well, being
human. Despite such a metaphysi
cal subject, this convoluted flick
flops in its attempt to be deep. Al
though you might ask yourself
"What's the point?" throughout the
movie, by the end, you're saying,
"That's a rather simplistic mes
sage." Not even Robin Williams can
save this one. PG-13

Belle Epoque
In the tradition of critically-ac
claimed, innocuous, little-known Eu
ropean movies comes Spanish di
rector Fernando Trueba's "Belle
Epoque." But don't let the hype of a
Best Foreign Film Oscar fool you:
the story of four farmer's daughters
and a Spanish army deserter con
tains sizzling sex scenes but little
historical or political content R
The Favor
What happens when you still lust
after your high school honey? That's
the question "The Favor" seeks to
answer with a convoluted Gordian
knot of situations. However, anyone
with a working knowledge of
"Three's Company" or "Bosom Bud
dies" can figure out just what's
going to happen. But to give "The
Favor" its proper credit, the movie
does have its moments. R
Four Weddings and a Funeral
"Four Weddings and a Funeral" ac
tually lives up to the hype as a
crowd-pleasing comedy. While it
may not explore the deep meaning
of life, the flick serves up breezy fun
with inspired comedy. The delightful
cast, featuring Andie MacDowell
and the omnipresent Hugh Grant,
does a good job of moving the
movie along. R

Germinal
Director Claude Berri does an im
peccable job of translating 19th cen
tury French writer Emile Zola's clas
sic novel "Germinal" to film. While
the performances of Gerard Depar
dieu and Miou-Miou shine, it's the
infernal mine that steals the show.
Sure, the movie might be long on
melodrama, but it still gives a good
glimpse of French history. R
No Escape
Ray Liotta goes from mob hench
man-in-hiding in "Goodfellas" to an
"aversive to authority" criminal ex
iled on an island in the futuristic "No
Escape." OK, the premise might be
a tad hokey, but the movie does
supply some good, fast-paced ac
tion scenes. Still, if you're looking for
something brainy, stay away from
this flick. R
Serial Mom
Kathleen Turner is evidently having
fun playing the part of a psycho
everything-is-not-dandy-a-la-Nor-
man-Rockwell Serial Mom in this
new, well-endowed John Waters
flick. It's a parody of suburban
America (typical Waters fare) with an
added bonus of a "Basic Instinct"
style courtroom gag. While not alto
gether a phenomenal work, it's
worth seeing. R

Threesome
Just as "Reality Bites" ends its run at
the theaters, "Threesome" comes
along to fill that college movie void.
The '90s-style love triangle which
the movie revolves around does ex
plore timely issues, but falls into
some of the stereotypes it wishes to
break. But on the whole, "Three
some" proves to be an entertaining
romp through ivory tower wonder
land. R
When a Man Loves a Woman
Yes, "When a Man Loves a Woman"
might bring a tear to the eye of the
most jaded of us. Still, something
about this Meg Ryan/Andy Garcia
vehicle about alcoholism and fami
lies and recovery and relationships
doesn't ring true; it seems like pub
lic service announcement for rehab
and pop psychology. R
With Honors
In a year of mediocre college
movies, "With Honors" graduates in
the middle of its class. Yes, it's an
other one of those which shows how
a bookworm (Brendan Fraser)
learns lessons of life from an oh-so
wise homeless guy (Joe Pesci). To
make matters worse, director Alek
Keshishian milks as much humor
out of the relationship as he can
rather than focusing on more evalu
ative situations. PG-13

Best Foreign Film Oscar fool you:
the story of four farmer's daughters
and a Spanish army deserter con
tains sizzling sex scenes but little
historical or political content R
The Favor
What happens when you still lust
after your high school honey? That's
the question "The Favor" seeks to
answer with a convoluted Gordian
knot of situations. However, anyone
with a working knowledge of
"Three's Company" or "Bosom Bud
dies" can figure out just what's
going to happen. But to give "The
Favor" its proper credit, the movie
does have its moments. R
Four Weddings and a Funeral
"Four Weddings and a Funeral" ac
tually lives up to the hype as a
crowd-pleasing comedy. While it
may not explore the deep meaning
of life, the flick serves up breezy fun
with inspired comedy. The delightful
cast, featuring Andie MacDowell
and the omnipresent Hugh Grant,
does a good job of moving the
movie along. R

Germinal
Director Claude Berri does an im
peccable job of translating 19th cen
tury French writer Emile Zola's clas
sic novel "Germinal" to film. While
the performances of Gerard Depar
dieu and Miou-Miou shine, it's the
infernal mine that steals the show.
Sure, the movie might be long on
melodrama, but it still gives a good
glimpse of French history. R
No Escape
Ray Liotta goes from mob hench
man-in-hiding in "Goodfellas" to an
"aversive to authority" criminal ex
iled on an island in the futuristic "No
Escape." OK, the premise might be
a tad hokey, but the movie does
supply some good, fast-paced ac
tion scenes. Still, if you're looking for
something brainy, stay away from
this flick. R
Serial Mom
Kathleen Turner is evidently having
fun playing the part of a psycho
everything-is-not-dandy-a-la-Nor-
man-Rockwell Serial Mom in this
new, well-endowed John Waters
flick. It's a parody of suburban
America (typical Waters fare) with an
added bonus of a "Basic Instinct"
style courtroom gag. While not alto
gether a phenomenal work, it's
worth seeing. R

Threesome
Just as "Reality Bites" ends its run at
the theaters, "Threesome" comes
along to fill that college movie void.
The '90s-style love triangle which
the movie revolves around does ex
plore timely issues, but falls into
some of the stereotypes it wishes to
break. But on the whole, "Three
some" proves to be an entertaining
romp through ivory tower wonder
land. R
When a Man Loves a Woman
Yes, "When a Man Loves a Woman"
might bring a tear to the eye of the
most jaded of us. Still, something
about this Meg Ryan/Andy Garcia
vehicle about alcoholism and fami
lies and recovery and relationships
doesn't ring true; it seems like pub
lic service announcement for rehab
and pop psychology. R
With Honors
In a year of mediocre college
movies, "With Honors" graduates in
the middle of its class. Yes, it's an
other one of those which shows how
a bookworm (Brendan Fraser)
learns lessons of life from an oh-so
wise homeless guy (Joe Pesci). To
make matters worse, director Alek
Keshishian milks as much humor
out of the relationship as he can
rather than focusing on more evalu
ative situations. PG-13
