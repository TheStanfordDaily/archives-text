# Restructuring of Res Ed rebuked
## Fac Sen subcommitte recommends independent status, half-time dean 
### Sarah Katz Editorial staff 
A Faculty Seriate subcommit
tee has rejected a reorganization
of Residential Education pro
posed earlier this year, pushing
for a stronger emphasis on acade
mics in the draft of its final rec
ommendations.
The senate's Subcommittee on
Residential Education and Advis
ing — which reports to the Com
mittee on Undergraduate Studies
— was resurrected this year in re
sponse to Vice Provost for Stu
dent Affairs Mary Edmonds' deci
sion to push Res Ed out of its in
dependent position in Student Af
fairs and under the auspices of
Housing and Dining Services.
The subcommittee's recom
mendations would essentially re
turn Res Ed to the way it was be
fore Edmonds' reorganization, a
shift that was hotly debated by
resident fellows, administrators
and concerned faculty members
alike.
"There's been a good spirit of

cooperation between the subcom
mittee and Mary Edmonds, with
the idea that what she said some
months ago is that nothing is in
cement," said Communication

Prof. Jeremy
Cohen, the sub
committee's
chair.
Specifically,
the recommenda
tions outline
seven points
which, among
other things,
place Res Ed as a

"stand-alone unit" under Student
Affairs, call for the creation of a
half-time faculty position to over
see the department and ask the
provost to take "an increased role
in the recruitment of faculty for
service in the Residential Educa
tion community."
While currently in draft form,
the subcommittee's findings were
"essentially accepted" yesterday
by its supervising committee,


Edmonds
