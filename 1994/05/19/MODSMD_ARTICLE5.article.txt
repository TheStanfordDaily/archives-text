# Restructuring of Res Ed rebuked
## Fac Sen subcommitte recommends independent status, half-time dean 
### Sarah Katz Editorial staff 
A Faculty Seriate subcommit
tee has rejected a reorganization
of Residential Education pro
posed earlier this year, pushing
for a stronger emphasis on acade
mics in the draft of its final rec
ommendations.
The senate's Subcommittee on
Residential Education and Advis
ing — which reports to the Com
mittee on Undergraduate Studies
— was resurrected this year in re
sponse to Vice Provost for Stu
dent Affairs Mary Edmonds' deci
sion to push Res Ed out of its in
dependent position in Student Af
fairs and under the auspices of
Housing and Dining Services.
The subcommittee's recom
mendations would essentially re
turn Res Ed to the way it was be
fore Edmonds' reorganization, a
shift that was hotly debated by
resident fellows, administrators
and concerned faculty members
alike.
"There's been a good spirit of

cooperation between the subcom
mittee and Mary Edmonds, with
the idea that what she said some
months ago is that nothing is in
cement," said Communication

Prof. Jeremy
Cohen, the sub
committee's
chair.
Specifically,
the recommenda
tions outline
seven points
which, among
other things,
place Res Ed as a

"stand-alone unit" under Student
Affairs, call for the creation of a
half-time faculty position to over
see the department and ask the
provost to take "an increased role
in the recruitment of faculty for
service in the Residential Educa
tion community."
While currently in draft form,
the subcommittee's findings were
"essentially accepted" yesterday
by its supervising committee,


Edmonds
Cohen said. The recommendations
will be handed to the Commission
on Undergraduate Education,
which will examine them with its
own subcommittees' findings.
Cohen noted, however, that
the fate of Res Ed will ultimately
be decided by Edmonds. "That's
her area. My sense is that she has

heard the RFs and [the subcom
mittee]. I would be very surprised
if her report did not reflect the
voice of the RFs," he said.
Edmonds said she has been
working on her own report, which
should be ready sometime next
week. Though the subcommittee's
findings rebuke her reorganization
plan, she expressed her approval of
the process by which the recom
mendations were reached.
Edmonds — who served on
Cohen's subcommittee but said

she has not attended recent meet
ings — also noted that she has
been "flexible" since the beginning.
Though the proposed reorgani
zation does not make many
changes to the Res Ed Stanford
has known in recent years, Cohen
said there are a few differences.
The draft calls for the creation
of a half-time faculty position —
currently known as associate or
consulting dean for Residential
Education — to give "increased
attention to the relationship of

academics, non-classroom educa
tion and student services."
"There's a perception on cam
pus that the link between the aca
demic side of the house and stu
dent services is not strong
enough," Cohen said.
The dean would not be in charge
of day-to-day operations but would
serve as a liaison and could work in
a "mentoring capacity," he said.
The proposal also places grad
uate housing "within the Resi
dential Education unit" and calls

for the permanent reinstitution
of the subcommittee as "a stand
ing Academic Senate committee
or subcommittee."
Two of the group's findings
airrf for greater faculty oversight
of Res Ed. The first recommends
that a "standing committee of
unit heads within Student Affairs
be created on which Residential
Education is fully represented"
along with Dean of Undergradu
ate Studies Ramon Saldi'var, the
new consulting dean for Res Ed

and a faculty liaison from the sub
committee.
The second finding asks the
provost to help with the recruit
ment of faculty to serve Res Ed,
both as RFs and in other modes
such as seminar or program lead
ers, Cohen said.
Finally, the subcommittee rec
ommends that residence deans
should again report to the direc
tor of Res Ed instead of to the
Dean of Students only, as they
have recently.
