## Proposed grading policy altered; won't take effect until '94-95; 2 student proposals presented 
### Julie Tsai Staff writer 
The proposed grading policy
would not take effect until the
1995-96 academic year if the Facul
ty Senate passes a revised version of
the plan made public yesterday at a
student forum.
During a meeting of the senate's
Committee on Academic Appraisal
and Achievement Tuesday, the
group who authored the policy al
tered their original proposal with
regard to the drop/add deadline and
retake policy. The policy will be
voted on during next Thursday's
Faculty Senate meeting, at which
time the proposal may be amended.
The changes would allow stu
dents to drop or add a class until the
fourth week of a quarter, as op
posed to the original third week
deadline of the proposal. In addi
tion, the committee advocated not
to limit retake eligibility to classes
where students received grades
below a C-, though repeated classes

would still be marked with an "RP"
on transcripts.
According to Council of Presi
dents member-elect Vanessa Al
varado, the original proposal had
appeared unclear as to the exact na
ture of implementation but her un
derstanding was that failing grades
and other portions could be in place
as early as fall quarter next year.
The original report to the senate
did not include a timeline for imple
mentation.
However, sophomore Eric Ban
nasch, a student representative on
the academic committee, said there
was never any intention of imple
menting the policy fully next year.
Under the revised version of the
proposal, only "minor restrictions"
concerning retakes will be in place
during the 1994-95 term.
At last night's forum sponsored
by next year's COP, two student
proposals for changing the grading
policy were presented, part of a
rushed attempt to solicit student
input before the Faculty Senate's
vote next week.
Bannasch began the forum with
an explanation of the proposed
changes and faculty concerns,
which included the disruptiveness
of late adds and drops and the para
doxical situation where students
prefer NCs over Ds because they do

not appear on transcripts.
The senate will vote on the com
mittee's proposal to move the add
and drop deadlines to the fourth
week of class, implement "with
draw" notations and the failing
grade, toughen the retake policy
and push the pass/no credit dead
line back to the sixth week.
Both student-sponsored propos
als recommend more lenient
add/drop deadlines than the aca
demic committee's plan but also
suggest stricter retake policies
more in line with faculty sentiment.

"I think [my proposal] is reason
able," said Alvarado, who co
authored a proposal with ASSU
senator Philip Lin and junior Eddie
Garcia. "But I'm afraid the faculty
has closed its ears."
Alvarado said the committee did
not consult students enough.
"We'd like to express our disap
pointment with the amount of stu
dent input," Alvarado said, reading
from a rough draft of the proposal.
The proposal asks for the drop
deadline to be moved from the
fourth week to the fifth, a written

promise that the changes not be
retroactive and, to court faculty
support, that course retake eligibil
ity be limited to students receiving
lower than a B in a course.
The ASSU Senate will vote on
the proposal Tuesday, and it will go
to the Faculty Senate Steering Com
mittee the next day if it passes. The
committee will then decide if the
proposal will be presented at Thurs
day's Faculty Senate meeting.
Alvarado said that when she
approached Geology Prof. Gail
Mahood, chair of the academic com

mittee, she was given a month to
collect student feedback and told
that while minor changes could be
made, the policy would largely
stand as it is.
"For the most part, the Faculty
Senate puts a lot of trust in the C
AAA," said Lin. According to Lin's
estimate, 20 members of the senate
are in favor of the proposed changes,
14 against and 20 undecided.
In addition, junior David Cohen
presented a proposal for discussion,
to be sponsored by English Prof.
Ron Rebholz at Thursday's session.

"I saw [the grading policy] seri
ously affecting... the atmosphere
here," Cohen said. "Part of my rea
son for not going to Yale or some
other place that's all high-pres
sured is because [students] are
very self-motivated here."
Cohen's proposal advocates no
failing grade and more lenient
add/drop deadlines, but also retains
the same retake policy proposal as
the Faculty Senate's.
Alvarado and Cohen will discuss
the possibility of merging the pro
posals, Lin said.
