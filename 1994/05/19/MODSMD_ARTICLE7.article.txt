# Mapping dinosaur prints, discovering iron ore â€” halfway around the world
## Frosh explores Russian ecology

Summertime means jobs, school, or simple va
cation time to most students, but the past three
summers have taken Stanford freshman Erik
Kreider to the other side of the world.
Inspired by an "adventurous heart," Kreider
spent last summer at the Volga River in Russia,
where he conducted ecological research on water
quality, endangered species and the geology of the
area. He traveled on the river in rubber rafts,
recording information on the botany of the river
banks and surrounding lakes.
Kreider's journey to the Volga River was his
third time in the former Soviet Union. He spent
the previous two summers in the country of Tajik
istan, where he worked in the Shirkent National
Park nature preserve.
The aim of one archaeological project conducted
in Tajikistan was to "find the source of iron ore"
used by civilizat ions thousands of years ago, Krei
der said. These ancient people left kilns which had
previously been found at the archaeological site
