# Mapping dinosaur prints, discovering iron ore — halfway around the world
## Frosh explores Russian ecology 
### Diane Chen Staff writer 
Summertime means jobs, school, or simple va
cation time to most students, but the past three
summers have taken Stanford freshman Erik
Kreider to the other side of the world.
Inspired by an "adventurous heart," Kreider
spent last summer at the Volga River in Russia,
where he conducted ecological research on water
quality, endangered species and the geology of the
area. He traveled on the river in rubber rafts,
recording information on the botany of the river
banks and surrounding lakes.
Kreider's journey to the Volga River was his
third time in the former Soviet Union. He spent
the previous two summers in the country of Tajik
istan, where he worked in the Shirkent National
Park nature preserve.
The aim of one archaeological project conducted
in Tajikistan was to "find the source of iron ore"
used by civilizat ions thousands of years ago, Krei
der said. These ancient people left kilns which had
previously been found at the archaeological site

and were used to melt iron ore, he
added.
During the study, Kreider "saw a
long, V-shaped trench on top of a
ridge," he said. Thinking it unusual,
he investigated and brought back a
piece of barite mineral to the geolo
gists working with him. The barite
turned out to be related to hematite
— the source of iron the civilizations
may have used. Kreider's finding
gave clues to the location of an
ancient iron mine, he said.
As his finding shows, much of
Kreider's part in the project was
"to increase the number of eyes out
there," he said.
The difference between doing
environmental work in central Asia
and in the United States is that envi
ronmental programs in Russia are
only three to four years old and need

extensive human resources, Kreider
said. "We're doing things that
nobody has done before," he added.
In Tajikistan — one of the rich
est places in the world for dinosaur
prints — Kreider also worked sev
eral days on a project to map 180
prints found on a piece of sand
stone. He helped in constructing
grids to record locations and mea
sured the depth and diameter of
the dinosaur prints.
Kreider also helped in tree cor
ing, a process that determines the
age of trees by counting rings, he
said.
Kreider stayed five weeks in the
former Soviet Union last summer.
Two and a half weeks were spent
camping and doing field work, one
week was shared with a local fami
ly, and the remainder of the time
was reserved for touring.
During his stay, Kreider lived in
a country house called a dacha. The
dacha was located in "a tiny village
without paved roads and no run

ning water — la place] about as
rural as you can get," he said.
As a student participant, Krei
der emphasized that an important
part of the program was "getting to
know the Russian people as indi
viduals." The experience was
"much more than just looking at
Russian ecology — it was develop
ing an understanding for people,"
he added.
Kreider said that going to the
former Soviet Union changed his
image of the Russian people.
"Growing up during the Cold War,
we played army games in the base
ment, shooting imaginary Rus
sians," he said.
After his trips over there, Kreider
realized that "kids my age had the
same worries and dreams, regard
less of the fact that our countries
were at odds in the past," he said.
One of Kreider's memories was
of his first landing in the 17-thou
sand-feet mountain peaks of Tajik
istan where he worked. After step

ping off a Russian military heli
copter, Kreider was greeted by
"twelve Tajiks who just grabbed
me and threw their arms around
me when I got off."
In Russia, "it's the natural
thing to put your arms around each
other — like brothers," he added.
Kreider's trip was sponsored by
Service Adventures, Inc., a Denver
based organization which was
founded four years ago, according
to program coordinator Bridget
Bohan. The group's purpose is to
pair American scientists and stu
dents with their Russian counter
parts to do environmental work,
Bohan said.
Because Kreider can speak only
a little bit of Russian and the Rus
sian students could speak just a lit
tle more English, communication
was mainly accomplished by means
other than speech.
He added that he plans on going
back to Russia this summer "just
to visit."

istan where he worked. After step

ping off a Russian military heli
copter, Kreider was greeted by
"twelve Tajiks who just grabbed
me and threw their arms around
me when I got off."
In Russia, "it's the natural
thing to put your arms around each
other — like brothers," he added.
Kreider's trip was sponsored by
Service Adventures, Inc., a Denver
based organization which was
founded four years ago, according
to program coordinator Bridget
Bohan. The group's purpose is to
pair American scientists and stu
dents with their Russian counter
parts to do environmental work,
Bohan said.
Because Kreider can speak only
a little bit of Russian and the Rus
sian students could speak just a lit
tle more English, communication
was mainly accomplished by means
other than speech.
He added that he plans on going
back to Russia this summer "just
to visit."
