# Escondido residents air concerns
## Parking, housing for families discussed with administrators 
### Michael Slemmer Editorial staff 
Family housing and parking spots topped the list
of concerns at a meeting between the Escondido Vil
lage town council and administrators last night.
Though residents agreed that significant
improvements have been made in Escondido since
the council's January meeting, they also brought up
new issues they believe the administration should
tackle.
"It's really only over the last year we've been able
to work together with administrators to bring about
our goals," said Benson Honig, a graduate student
in the School of Education. "What we need to do
now is focus more closely on issues that affect our
quality of life."
The group of residents — most of whom are liv
ing in family housing — first said that they fear
housing policy may force students with families to
move out of their village residences before they fin
ish their degrees.
Since 1981, University policy has guaranteed
graduate families housing in the village for four
years, said Rodger Whitney, associate director of
Housing and Dining Services. Families must then
enter the housing lottery.
"Our concern is that families looking at Stanford
[as a prospective school] may not think they'll be
assured of a single place to live," Honig said,

explaining one reason for the residents' concern.
Additionally, it could be "problematic to have to
relocate in the fifth or sixth year of graduate study,"
he said, adding that most of the students in Stan
ford's doctoral programs require more than four
years to get their degrees.
However, Director of Graduate Residences Chris
Griffith said that, because demand for family hous
ing is traditionally lower than the supply, it is high
ly unlikely a family would be displaced after four
years. Even so, "as the population evolves, we are
obliged to review our policy and see if it is appropri
ate to the demographics," she said.
Whitney said that if families become likely to lose
their housing, the administration will "make sure
and look into updating the policy."
Residents also discussed the village parking poli
cy, which currently does not match up specific spots
with apartments. Though they expressed concerns
to Carole Nyholm, assistant director for graduate
residences, they could not agree on a new policy.
Though residents brought up new problems at
the meeting, they also lauded administrators for
implementing some of the solutions proposed in
January.
Among the housing improvements which have
been implemented in Escondido are a test program
for new bicycle locks, sidewalk improvements, a
plan to install upgraded playgrounds and a test pro
ject for cable television.
