# Few on wait list admitted
## 
### Romesh Ratnesar Editorial staff 
No amount of finger-crossing
or vigil-keeping will help most of
the 560 high school seniors on the
admissions waiting list this
spring, as Stanford will admit
only 32 of them, the fewest num
ber in five years.
Having accepted more stu
dents outright, the University
was able to fill most of the slots
for the Class of 1998 without re
sorting to the wait list. According
to Dean of Undergraduate Admis
sions James Montoya, 85 fresh
men were admitted from last
year's wait list.
Of those students admitted
through the regular admittance
process this year, 54.9 percent
have agreed to attend Stanford.
Montoya said his office is antici
pating that about 85 percent of
those admitted from the waiting
list will also accept, which would
bump the yield rate to about 55.3
percent.
That is only a slight increase
over the yield rate for the Class of
1997, which totaled 54.9 percent.
"Yield figures have not changed
dramatically over the last four
years," Montoya said. "We were
anticipating approximately a 55
percent yield rate (this year)."
Montoya will report more defi
nite figures on the yield rate next
week to the Faculty Senate's
Committee on Undergraduate
Admissions and Financial Aid.
On April 1, the University of
fered admission to 2,900 students
out of an applicant pool of 14,610.
In 1993, 2,840 students out of a
pool of about 13,500 were accept
ed to Stanford.
The number of students ad
mitted off the waiting list this
year is the lowest since at least
1989. In 1990, the University ad
mitted 225 students, an unusual
ly high number. Montoya said
that circumstance was largely the
result of poor yield in the after
math of the October 1989 Loma
Prieta earthquake.
"The fact that we are taking 32
students and that we came very
close to our target number re
flects Stanford's popularity
among students," Montoya said.
But he added that the decrease in
the number of students taken
from the wait list since last year is
"not all that telling."
Montoya said he is pleased
with this year's yield results,
especially in the context of more
aggressive recruiting effort by
some schools. "I think it's been a
very successful year in terms of
getting these students who most
wanted to enroll at Stanford," he
said. "The yield this year was
comparable to last year, in what I
consider to be a more highly com
petitive environment to enroll
students."
He said that admissions
offices increasingly are offering
students benefits and incentives

to woo them to their colleges.
"This year I faced many more
students having to choose
between Stanford and another
institution where they may have
received a merit award," Mon
toya said. "That's always the
most painful situation for me â€”
when students confide that Stan
ford is where they most want to
attend, but the other option is
more financially acceptable to
their parents."
Earlier this year, the Faculty
Senate discussed the possibilities
of instituting a program of aca
demic merit-based incentives to
attract top admittees. Such sug
gestions gained further support
with the disclosure that nearly
80 percent of students admitted

to both Stanford and Harvard
choose Harvard.
"We here as an institution
have to consider all these
options that are available to
enroll the most qualified stu
dents possible," Montoya said.
But he added that "the experi
ence we've had this year sug
gests there are ways other than
merit awards to attract the very
best students."
This year, those strategies
included encouraging accepted
students to examine Courses and
Degrees, contacting more stu
dents by telephone and pitching
Stanford to parents with redou
bled ardor. As a result, Montoya
said, his office will probably not
consider offering merit awards

next year.
Montoya said recruiting
efforts received a boost from
increased involvement by alum
ni, who "hosted a larger number
of receptions" not attended by
representatives from the Admis
sions Office. Alumni interest
has heightened at a fortuitous
time for the Admissions Office,
which has curtailed its own
recruiting visits because of bud
get cuts.
"There's no question, it's an
option that provides the opportu
nity of having personal contact
with admitted students," Mon
toya said. "I think we will see
more alumni involvement in the
admissions process in the
future."
