# Few on wait list admitted
## 
### Romesh Ratnesar Editorial staff 
No amount of finger-crossing
or vigil-keeping will help most of
the 560 high school seniors on the
admissions waiting list this
spring, as Stanford will admit
only 32 of them, the fewest num
ber in five years.
Having accepted more stu
dents outright, the University
was able to fill most of the slots
for the Class of 1998 without re
sorting to the wait list. According
to Dean of Undergraduate Admis
sions James Montoya, 85 fresh
men were admitted from last
year's wait list.
Of those students admitted
through the regular admittance
process this year, 54.9 percent
have agreed to attend Stanford.
Montoya said his office is antici
pating that about 85 percent of
those admitted from the waiting
list will also accept, which would
bump the yield rate to about 55.3
percent.
That is only a slight increase
over the yield rate for the Class of
1997, which totaled 54.9 percent.
"Yield figures have not changed
dramatically over the last four
years," Montoya said. "We were
anticipating approximately a 55
percent yield rate (this year)."
Montoya will report more defi
nite figures on the yield rate next
week to the Faculty Senate's
Committee on Undergraduate
Admissions and Financial Aid.
On April 1, the University of
fered admission to 2,900 students
out of an applicant pool of 14,610.
In 1993, 2,840 students out of a
pool of about 13,500 were accept
ed to Stanford.
The number of students ad
mitted off the waiting list this
year is the lowest since at least
1989. In 1990, the University ad
mitted 225 students, an unusual
ly high number. Montoya said
that circumstance was largely the
result of poor yield in the after
math of the October 1989 Loma
Prieta earthquake.
"The fact that we are taking 32
students and that we came very
close to our target number re
flects Stanford's popularity
among students," Montoya said.
But he added that the decrease in
the number of students taken
from the wait list since last year is
"not all that telling."
