NEW YORK (AP) â€” Jacqueline
Kennedy Onassis, who charmed the
nation with her style and calmed it with
her strength first as wife and then as
widow of a president, died yesterday of
cancer. She was 64.
Her children, Caroline Kennedy
Schlossberg and John F. Kennedy Jr.,
other family members, and longtime
companion Maurice Tempelsman were
with her when she died at her Fifth
Avenue apartment, said her
spokeswoman, Nancy Tuckerman.
Tuckerman said Mrs. Onassis died at
10:15 p.m. from non-Hodgkin's lym
phoma.
"Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis was a
model of courage and dignity for all
Americans and all the world," President
Clinton said in a statement. "More than
any other woman of her time, she capti
vated our nation and the world with her
intelligence, elegance and grace."
"Even in the face of impossible
tragedy, she carried the grief of her fam
ily and our entire nation with a calm
power that somehow reassured all of us
who mourned. We hope that Mrs. Onas
sis' children, John and Caroline, and

her grandchildren find solace in the
extraordinary contributions she made
to our country," he said.
The former first lady, who only Sun
day was photographed strolling in Cen
tral Park, entered the hospital Monday.
She returned to her home Wednesday
after doctors at New York Hospital-Cor
nell Medical Center said "there was
nothing more to do for her," Tucker
man said.
As Kennedy relatives filed in and out
of her co-op building, Monsignor George
Bardes of St. Thomas More Roman
Catholic Church heard her confession,
gave her communion, and administered
the sacrament of the sick, said church
spokeswoman Margaret Peet.
"She is very, very sick and it's very
sad," Rep. Joseph Kennedy 11, son of the
late Robert F. Kennedy, said after visit
ing his aunt during the day. But he
added, "There's a lot of love in her room
and in her apartment."
The New York Times reported that
the cancer had spread to Mrs. Onassis'
brain and liver. Quoting an unidentified
health care provider in Friday's edi
tions, the Times said Mrs. Onassis had

been suffering from pneumonia and had
refused antibiotics.
The newspaper said she had slipped
into a coma yesterday.
Sen. Edward Kennedy told reporters
only hours before his sister-in-law's death
that she was "enormously grateful to all
the people who have been kind enough to
send her notes wishing her well."
The Massachusetts Democrat, who
had flown back and forth between
Washington and New York on Wednes
day and yesterday, was on a plane back
to Washington when Mrs. Onassis died,
said Melody Miller, his spokeswoman.
The flag at the John F. Kennedy
Library in Boston was immediately low
ered to half-staff.
"Few women throughout history
have touched the hearts and shaped the
dreams of Americans more profoundly
than Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis," for
mer President Reagan said in a state
ment.
Mrs. Onassis disclosed she was suf
fering from cancer of the lymph nodes
in February.
Funeral arrangements would be pri
vate, Tuckerman said.
