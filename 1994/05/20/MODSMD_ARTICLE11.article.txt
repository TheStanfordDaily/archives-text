# For the record

A headline in yesterday's Daily
on the recent grading policy forum
incorrectly stated that the pro
posed grading policy was altered
so that it would take effect in the
1994-95 academic year. However,
it would not take effect until 1995-
96, as reported in the article.
In addition, yesterday's article
"Students get senate invite"
incorrectly reported that Con
cerned Students for Asian-Ameri
can Studies was placed on the
agenda of the upcoming Faculty
Senate meeting after it presented
a 700-signature petition to the
steering committee. However, the
group was placed on the agenda
through a resolution from the
ASSU Senate. The group did not
submit its petition.
