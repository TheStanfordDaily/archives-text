## Editorial A 						so-so performance COP had solid ties to administrators, but few links to students 
### 
THEY MADE a comeback —
of sorts. After being voted
into virtual non-existence
two years ago, the ASSU Council of
Presidents came back this year
hoping to re-establish themselves
as the student body's elected lead
ers and advocates.
The continued existence of a COP
next year proves that this year's
foursome were, at the very least,
mildly successful. Seniors Ron
Brown, Ying-Ying Goh, Delia Lopez
and Jason Snyder met frequently
with University administrators
throughout the year and restored the
COP's role as a link between the stu
dents and the University.
But while the re-establishment of
this link is laudable, its strength is
questionable, as many students
throughout the year have still sought
other channels of communication
and voiced frustration that they were
not being heard.
The COP's public record of activi
ties this year is also a mixed bag over
all, with a few major successes, but
still some fundamental shortcomings
that the incoming COP must prompt
ly address to keep up and increase the
momentum of the comeback.
One of the COP's major successes
came when they persuaded the
administration not to slash $50,000
from the budget of the Career Plan
ning and Placement Center next
year. Sparing the CPPC from a crip
pling cut stands out as one of the
COP's most worthwhile and praise
worthy accomplishments of this year.
The COP also deserves a pat on
the back for their creation of the Stu
dent Advisory Group on Undergrad
uate Education. This group
undoubtedly helped improve the
sometimes strained and difficult
relations between the students and
the University. The recent poll on

undergraduate education also gar
nered more student input.
The COP's recognition of the need
for more student input in various
University processes, however, did
not translate into every area. Stu
dents still felt largely out of the loop
this year, and did not often look to
the COP to be their voice.
Perhaps it was the relatively low
profile they kept among the stu
dents. While they met with adminis
trators relatively often, students
were rarely clued into what they met
about and what the outcomes were.
And when issues such as the possible
ethnic center budget cuts arose, the
COP remained on the sidelines.
Throughout the year, the COP did
try to communicate with students
through newsletters and town meet
ings, but these efforts met with min
imal success. Effective communica
tion is in dire need of improvement.
More involvement in senate meet
ings and more contact with individu
al student organizations could have
facilitated this process.
In addition, some University com
mittees were filled with student
members who were less than active
this year, leaving the rest of the stu
dent body with minimal representa
tion in such matters as an unpalat
able grading policy, among others.
The COP should have better used
their leadership role to address weak
nesses of various ASSU organiza
tions responsible for such activities.
In many ways the COP functioned
too separately from its constituents
or even from members of the very
organization over which they pre
side, the ASSU. While rebuilding a
close relationship with the adminis
tration was important — and this
involved a certain level of confiden
tiality and restraint — the COP
focused too heavily on this and too
little on maintaining a link with their
electorate, the students.
Next year's COP will have differ
ent faces but similar goals to this
year's COP The incoming group
should learn from the successes and
disappointments of this year's COP
to provide students with the most
effective leadership possible.
