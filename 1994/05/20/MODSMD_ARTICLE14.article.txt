## Caroline Kroll and April Minor NPs, Ws, RPs... enough of alphabet soup! 
### 
After attending the grading policy
"town meeting" at Kimball May 9, EYE
— two concerned students looking out
for the student body — was distressed.
No one was there.
EYE went to the meeting, despite hav
ing a research paper due the next day. It
was worse than EYE imagined. This is
not about "bringing back the F," or "sav
ing the C."
The issues that are most important to
the faculty and students are:
• Making the add/drop deadline the
fourth week of the quarter (originally it
was set at the third week).
• Adding a "W" on your transcript if
you drop a class after that deadline.
Sadly, the faculty and students are on
different sides of these issues. The Com
mittee on Academic Appraisal and
Achievement (C-AAA) also recommended
the return of the F as "NP" and changing
the "P" on your transcript that means
satisfactory to "CR." Are you getting
this? They also want to add an to
repeated class grades and the notation of
"RP" after classes that have been repeat
ed. All of this, with the "W," leaves us
swimming in an alphabet soup.
The soup will be created by what the
faculty calls the "need for a more 'histor
ical transcript'." History can say "NP,"
but it also says Columbus discovered
America. If we grant the Faculty Senate
its soup, can we have our deadlines?
Extended add/drop and P/NC deadlines
contribute to the valuable and unique

opportunities that we Stanford students
have to explore classes, and later discover
our majors. This keeps our schedule
diverse with classes outside of our majors
(not to mention DRs).
Most schools use the 'W', faculty at
the town meeting said. Stanford is not
most schools, EYE say.
"We must conserve our precious aca
demic resources," said Gail Mahood, the
chair of C-AAA. We are your precious
academic resources, EYE say.
They said that graduate schools find
our (and Brown University's) transcripts
questionable, particularly regarding the
issue of grade inflation. Then they said
their committee was not put together to
deal with the grade inflation problem, the
Commission on Undergraduate Educa
tion is for that. More letters for the soup.
EYE read the entire 26-page report
that C-AAA submitted. EYE'll just say
that the faculty opinion of the F was
divided; 50 percent wanted it, but 50 per
cent is a failing grade. According to
Mahood the faculty also strongly sup
ports the three-week deadline. Petitions,
anyone ? More paper soup.
At the end of the study, Mahood dis
cusses the method she used to collect stu
dent input: "by consulting resident fel
lows and members of the Undergraduate
Advising Center, by listening to student
members of the Committee, and by talk
ing informally with student acquain
tances." She concluded, "... student

concerns center around a small number
of issues (C-AAA Report, Mahood, p. 12)."
She solidified my belief that the facul
ty is claiming to be the only voice with the
right to speak on campus. Maybe this
issue is small, maybe it doesn't affect the
upperclassmen as much, but we had bet
ter show the administration that we are
not the apathetic blob we may have once
been.
Anyway, EYE am suspicious because
the senate is being a bit hasty in pushing
this thing through. It's quite convenient
that the senate chair voting on this issue,
Prof. Pat Jones, will be replaced in
September. How many students have
read the proposal? How many students
have gotten the chance to really think
about its ramifications?
The grading policy has undergone
seven separate modifications and
changes since 1968. As Prof. John Krum
boltz of the School Education and the
Psychology Dept. asks in the May 4 Cam
pus Report, who are these changes bene
fiting? It seems logical that the grading
policy might be changed after an exten
sive evaluation of the curriculum, the
student body and the grades reported. It
does not seem logical that we change
grading policies more often than we
change presidents.
EYE can take action, but EYE can't
cause change alone. WE students must
take action as a collective force. At the
