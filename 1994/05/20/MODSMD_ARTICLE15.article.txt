## Words skew image of Asian-American Studies advocates 
### 
IN AN INSTITUTION where stu
dents have no authority, student
actions are by definition unautho
rized.
I do not intend to get into a war of
words. But I want to make a point about
the manner in which the news media on
this campus have portrayed the latest
chapter in the struggles for Asian-Ameri
can Studies on this campus, and the
ways the structure of our language
allows for patently illogical statements,
even while closer attention to our lan
guage would reveal the illogical nature of
these statements.
I am referring to the frequent recur
rence of the words "unauthorized" and
"force" in recent coverage. I can't count
how many times it has been repeated

that unauthorized action on the part of
students forced the adjournment of the
Faculty Senate meeting on May 12. Fur
thermore, in a personal response to my
concerns with mistreatment of students
by the academic secretary's office, senate
chair Pat Jones suggested that the unau
thorized treatment of students was a
response to students' unauthorized
actions.
Of course, much of the mistreatment
of students preceded our actions on May
12; indeed, our entrance by illegal means
was a response to the academic secre
tary's refusal to seat us through the reg
ular channels. Even without this
chronology, however, the idea that
administrative mistreatment can be com
pared to students' activity is unfounded.

Students did indeed take unautho
rized action last week. In an institution
where students' access to public forums
is controlled by administrative channels
and regulations over which they have no
control, any action that they take will be
by definition "unauthorized." It is their
very lack of authority which causes their
action to be so nominated.
Likewise, unauthorized action cannot,
by definition, "force" any administrative
response. We did not "force" the senate
to adjourn; rather, they chose to adjourn
rather than listen to what Jones calls
"unauthorized discussion." Individuals
and institutions in power do not, by defi
nition, take unauthorized actions
because they have the authority to decide
what is permissible.

What is "unauthorized discussion?"
This is not simply about Asian-American
Studies. This is about a democratic edu
cation in which students have a voice.
University President Gerhard Casper,
quoting Supreme Court Justice Felix
Frankfurter, emphasized in his annual
address the importance of academic free
dom: "They are a university's freedom 'to
determine for itself on academic grounds
who may teach, what may be taught, how
it shall be taught and who may be admit
ted to study.' " My question, then, is do
the students not constitute a central com
ponent of the University, and as such
should they not have a voice?
