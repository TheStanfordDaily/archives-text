# Horpel's comments on vandalism suggest an anti-gay Athletics Dept.
## 
### 
Athletic Director Ted Leland has taken
the politically astute position of condemn
ing the vandalism of the Segal statues by
Stanford athletes, but I believe this inci
dent is emblematic of the Department of
Athletics' treatment of lesbian, gay and
bisexual students and employees. The
anti-intellectual remarks of wrestling
coach Chris Horpel are particularly trou
bling, ana only serve to encourage bigotry.
In his San Jose Mercury News interview
May 18 regarding the vandalism, Horpel
thrice defends the vandals:
1. "... a thoughtless act by some
friends who got drunk and carried away
— dumb, yes, but not sinister";
2. "Stanford students are almost force
fed political correctness ... I think what
they did was just sort of a reaction"; and
3. "... in the middle of the night, they
painted the statue, got caught and cleaned
it all up. So basically there would've been

no record of anything happening, but the
police felt obligated to make sure everyone
knew."
I think the take-home lessons that
Horpel suggests are clear:
• If you vandalize artwork or nationally
recognized symbols of gay rights, it's just
a minor foul;
• If you encounter ideas that you find
challenging and disturbing, it is only natu
ral to get drunk and do something violent
and bigoted in the middle of the night;
and
• You aren't responsible for your crimi
nal activities so long as you are a drunken
star athlete. Why were those pesky police
even involved?
After Horpel's remarks certain other
statements about the Athletics Depart
ment make more sense. Earlier this year a
lesbian student reported to a gay e-mail
list that she was harassed in a Stanford
weight room, but Athletics Department
staff couldn't be bothered to help her. A
staff member in the Office of Student
Affairs has told me that queer coaches are
expected to keep their private lives pri
vate. But we see straight coaches parade
their spouses at every game.

A student-athlete told me that, in a
recent hiring decision, the Department
actively sought out a straight coach from
a field of candidates dominated by les
bians. I guess if we got too many queers
on staff, they might not advocate drunken
bigotry in the middle of the night. And
then where would we be? I think caning
vandals is barbaric, but I'm undecided
about certain Athletics Department
employees.
