# Vandalism by athletes should not be judged as homophobic by default
## 
### 
I think it's important not to assume
that targeting the "Gay Liberation" stat
ues for vandalism implies that the van
dals are homophobic. Stanford is like a
museum with classes there's art all
over the place.
I'm not homophobic, but I have to

admit that if I were going to vandalize
any art on campus, it would be those
same statues. And the reason is purely
aesthetic. I don't like the way they
look.
I'm not referring to the gay theme;
I'm talking about four white, ugly, pasty
things that look like people. If I were
going to vandalize art at Stanford, it
wouldn't be the Thinker or that cool
looking geometric wall near the Quad. I
like those, and others like the works in
the sculpture garden, from an aesthetic
point of view.
However, the sculpture, like the cou
ple at Embarcadero and Waverley that
keeps getting decapitated, is ugly. Now, I
don't know if the students vandalized the
"Gay Liberation" statues because they
are homophobic, and the vandalism itself
must not be condoned (though felony
charges tire a bit harsh). But I won't
immediately assume that the students
are homophobic.
I'm not that judgmental, and I hope
the Stanford community is not that
quick to accuse either.
