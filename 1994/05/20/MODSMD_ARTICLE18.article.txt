## Going out with a whimper: a senior slump 
### 
THE ROAD TO HELL is paved
with good intentions. And I myself
have painstakingly laid a 24-
karat-gold carpool lane ending a foot out
of the reach of Cerberus' choke chain.
Built diamond speed bumps while
envisioning higher-education-induced
intellectual enlightenment. Platinum
center lines striving to evenly separate
an action-packed collegiate social calen
dar with work toward a diploma that
would leave future employers as limp as
rotting banana peels. Breathtaking star
sapphire left-hand-turn lanes detouring
me to my life-mate, the king of long,
flowing hair and flawless orthodontia.
She's buying the stairway to heaven.
I had the highest of hopes. The lofti
est of dreams. Double-D-cupped aspira
tions that would bouncily render skep
tics speechless. I was going to be the
next Teddy Roosevelt. I was going to be
the Mafia queen with the largest stock of
automatic weapons this side of the
Pecos. With my burning desire du jour
at the helm, I was perennially headed
toward palatial estates in Morocco, for-

eign cars with good gas mileage and
thousands of 16-year-old boy servants
without chest hair.
Dream the impossible dream.
When I was a freshman, I was dead
set on learning what a world-class insti
tution had to offer — trying to keep my
head above water as the littlest fish in a
rain-swollen pond.
Last Friday all visions of grandeur
were left to crust and flake away like
guano on a car windshield as I spent two
hours elbowing 8-year-olds with no front
teeth out of the way so I could watch my
friend chug quarters into Mortal Kom
bat for two hours, killing bit-mapped
martial artist after martial artist at Mal
ibu Grand Prix.
Hey mister, got a quarter?
As a sophomore, I toyed with the idea
of having a grade point average my
grandparents could brag about. Franti
cally drawing the blue-print for the new,
adult me while I reeled from the destruc
tion of my light-blue-Nike-high-topped,
light-blue-eye-shadowed high-school self.
Last Saturday I rode the cable cars

in San Francisco, taunting lederhosen
clad elderly Bavarian tourists with
tactless "sorry about Dresden" jokes as
I screeched to my friend that if I looked
up to the sky while on the moving car I
could almost make myself lose my clam
chowder, sourdough bread bowl and
all.
Progress, intelligently planned.
By junior year I had found my niche,
taking classes with only 20-page papers
I could put off until the last nanosec
ond, while going on double-digit blind
dates with guys who asked me out over
e-mail. I saw myself with a future in
Latin American business, or as an
author of supermarket bodice-rippers,
both of which could be easily manipu
lated to provide a priceless service to
the heads of Nielsen families nation
wide. I promised to cut the fat out of
my diet and to start training for a
marathon.
Last Sunday I missed brunch, and
devoured instead all I could find in my
room: three strawberry/banana taffy
bars, a bag of M&Ms and two warm Diet

Cokes before slipping back into hiberna
tion for another four hours. I woke up
just in time to pat my colon softly on the
head before make-your-own-nachos night
at the dining hall, after which I went
back to sleep since I decided walking to
Flicks or re-organizing the pile of phone
numbers and job leads on my desk both
would take too much karmic energy.
My body is a temple.
And last fall I figured would be able
to coast — writing a thesis in my spare
time as I waited for Fortune 500 compa
nies to promise to lick my toenails if only
I would bless them with my superior
knowledge of Socrates commands, my
ability to sneak beer into football games
and my knowledge of the Karel the
Robot programming language.
This Monday I hid like a coward from
my excruciatingly fruitless job search,
gallivanting across to the East Bay with
friends in search of a mythical hot dog
stand. Taking pictures of this Mecca of
meat by-products from across the
street. Watching overweight passengers
in cars that were obviously the product

of a Detroit / OPEC insider trading
scam bellow "Hey baby, take a picture
of this!"
A mind is a terrible thing to waste.
Now I am terrifiedly approaching the
commuter lane which will cruelly whisk
me off to lonely evenings spent trying to
tune in a black-and-white TV to catch
"Beavis and Butthead," as though the
jokes get drowned out by the din of a
nearby freeway.
I got the conferral of my degree in the
mail last week. It was a plain white
sheet of paper with a skimpy gold foil
seal like the one's on pie-eating contest
certificates back in elementary school. I
just rented my first room off-campus. I
had to rollerblade three miles to sign the
agreement.
Somehow I meant to do more. I
meant to contribute to the world. I was
going to be somebody. I was destined for
greatness.
Don't let this happen to you.
