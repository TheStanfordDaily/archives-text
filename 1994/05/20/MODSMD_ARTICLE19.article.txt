## Stadium gets World Cup renovations 
### Emery Chen Staff writer 
When the Bay Area Bid Committee entered
its application to become a host for the World
Cup soccer tournament, it knew that if accepted,
it could bank on an added influx of cash into the
local economy. It also anticipated additional ben
efits from hosting the tournament other than
monetary ones. With the tournament's com
mencement just a month away, the area already
is reaping in some of these rewards.
"It's a huge positive event for Stanford," said
women's soccer coach lan Sawyers. "Anytime
Stanford gets national exposure, it is great."
As a host site, Stanford is one of the major
beneficiaries. While Stanford Stadium under
went some changes exclusively for the World
Cup, some of the stadium improvements by the
World Cup and the University will remain long
after the tournament's completion.
The Santa Clara-based World Cup committee
set aside $5 million to pay for changes to the sta
dium and the surrounding area. One of the ren
ovations planned for inside Stanford Stadium
involves widening the football field to regulation
soccer size by adding turf on top of the running
track. Other changes the World Cup will per
form include tearing up the pole vault runway
and replacing it with sod in addition to removing
the dying grass in the middle of the field.
Stanford itself instituted changes including
the removal of the wooden benches that were
the bane of thousands of fans and replacing
them with the same type of golden aluminum
benches that service the rest of the stadium. In
addition, Stanford also added a concrete balcony
to accommodate the anticipated number of press
and media.
The majority of the changes will take place
outside of the stadium. Currently the World Cup
is installing portable buildings for the media
center, broadcast compound, security compound
and entertainment compound. Additionally, it
will add a six-foot fence that will surround the
entire stadium and compounds.
"These changes are really kind of dull," said
Valerie Veronin, the acting director of the Uni
versity Facilities Projects. "The events are the
real excitement."
Rick la Plante, the press officer for the Santa
Clara World Cup Committee, agrees.
"We're anticipating all six games to sell out,"
la Plante said. He pointed out that four of the
games are already sold out and that tickets for
the other two are becoming more scarce.
La Plante said in addition to the direct sales,
the added revenue from the hordes of visitors
will help the area. The estimated revenue is
about $338 million, he said.
As Sawyers stated, soccer's popularity
around the world has been underappreciated by
the United States.
"The Olympics is the big event for most ath
letics but the World Cup is the biggest event for
[soccer]," Sawyers said.
As droves of Americans traveled
to Norway to watch the Winter
Olympic games, so will the citizens
of visiting nations. An estimated
15,000 fans will travel to Stanford
to cheer on Diego Maradona and
the Brazilian team and an addi
tional 4,000-6,000 boosters of the
Swiss and Colombian teams are
expected to visit the area. Russia
and Cameroon, the other countries
playing at Stanford, will likely send
slightly fewer fans.
The number of journalists orga
nizers are planning for is also stag
r th r '' r 1 ound mn
'-a,OU .t ..bers of ii.
media are expected to cover the
games while the number increases
to 1,000-1,200 for the second
round matches. The estimated
number for the quarterfinals is
listed at 1,500.
