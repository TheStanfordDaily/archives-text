# Going on the offense for self-defense
## Students rally to bring back self-defense class 
### Beth Berselli Staff writer 
About 100 people gathered in White
Plaza yesterday to rally for the reinstate
ment of a women's self-defense course,
charging that the University is commit
ting "a grave error" by not offering the
class on campus.
"Issues in Self-Defense for Women,"
which was offered through the Program
in Feminist Studies, was canceled fall
quarter after an anonymous complaint
was made to the U.S. Department of Ed
ucation's Office of Civil Rights. The com
plaint asserted that segregating sections

by gender violated Title IX, a 1972 regu
lation prohibiting sex discrimination in
schools which receive federal funding.
At that time, the University refused
to let the government investigate
whether the class was truly in violation
of Title IX, and instead told the sponsors
to alter the course's format so that it was
either coed or strictly a physical educa
tion, single-sex class.
The lunchtime rally was sponsored by
the Women Defending Ourselves Collec
tive, which currently teaches the class off
campus. Collective members said the

About 100 people rallied In White Plaza yesterday for the reinstatement of a
women's self-defense class that was canceled last year.
rally served two purposes — to
demonstrate support for the
course and to educate the commu
nity about the movement to get
the class reinstated.
"I hope that the administration
interprets this rally as a visible
sign of support on campus," said
Jessie Levine, a member of the
collective.
Carrying signs reading
"Women are worth defending,"
"Self-defense not nat'l defense"
and "Title IX is for women," mem
bers of the audience listened to
several speakers.
As next year's chair of Feminist
Studies, History Prof. Estelle
Freedman said she is committed
to getting the class back on cam
pus.
"The loss of this class was very
disturbing to me as a faculty
member," Freedman said. "Stan
ford is making a grave error in dis
missing this class from campus."

Collective member Margaret
Hodder gave a historical overview
of the course's presence on cam
pus and the legal background for
why it was canceled. She dis
cussed the collective's submission
of a 50-page legal brief to Univer
sity officials on Monday, arguing
that the class does not violate
Title IX.
The brief asserts that Title IX
allows women-only courses which
serve an affirmative action pur
pose or compensate women for
past and existing discrimination.
Authors of the brief said their
intention is to convince the Uni
versity that the class is legitimate
on legal grounds, and thus can, if
reinstated, withstand future com
plaints.
Provost Condoleezza Rice has
promised to make a formal
response to the brief by the end of
the month, collective member
Rachel Katz said.
Assoc. Dean of Memorial
Church Diana Akiyama urged
members of the audience to talk to
other students about the issue.
Praising the class, Akiyama

said, "It encourages women to
stop feeling helpless and that their
only position is as a victim. It
helps women move toward being
more proactive."
ASSU Senator Nancy Salas
said she was glad to see so many
men at the rally. "It's not just a
women's issue," she said. Senior
Brian Brennan echoed the senti
ment by calling it a human con
cern. "It applies to everyone who
is a woman or cares about one," he
said.
Sexual Assault Prevention
Educator Angelina Cheney said
the University needs to demon
strate support for its female stu
dents by reinstating the class.
"The University has to embrace
this program and show women
that it cares for them and wants
them to be here," Cheney said.
Between speakers, collective
members read excerpts from let
ters written in support of reinstat
ing the course. The letters ranged
from a female student claiming
that the class "changed my life" to
a male student saying that "as a
male I don't feel discriminated

against on this issue."
The movement to reinstate the
course has gone beyond the Stan
ford campus, collective members
said. U.S. Representative Anna
Eshoo and U.S. Senator Dianne
Feinstein are considering writing
to the University, and State
Assemblyman Byron Sher has
already written a letter to the
provost urging the course's
return.
Members of the audience said
they were glad to see so many peo
ple gathered in support. "I hope
the administration is listening,"
said Rebecca Bliss, coordinator for
the Women's Center. "I under
stand the need for the administra
tion to pick and choose its battles
wisely, and I'm appalled this was
one battle they chose not to fight.
The women at Stanford deserve
more respect from the administra
tion."
Junior Abdi Soltani said that
the University has an obligation
to reinstate the class. "If the Uni
versity invests money in windsurf
ing classes, then it certainly
should for self-defense."
