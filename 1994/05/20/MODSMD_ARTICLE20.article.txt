# Men to take a swing at NCAA title
## Tennis starts NCAA play as No. 2 seed 
### Mike Langford Senior staff writer 
The Stanford men's tennis team has
played a season of eight tournaments,
24 dual matches, hundreds of doubles
sets, thousands of backhands, and
countless practice hours.
All just to be invited.
The Cardinal (22-2) is the second
seed at the men's NCAA Champi
onships which begin tomorrow in Notre
Dame, Ind. Only 16 teams are invited to
the single-elimination tournament, in
which three Pacific 10 Conference
teams are in the running: Stanford,
UCLA, and top-seeded USC.
"The tournament should be a great
championship with a field of about 10
teams which realistically have a chance
to win," said Stanford head coach Dick
Gould. "As for us, we're only thinking
about our first opponent, Fresno State."
Stanford will face the Bulldogs
tomorrow at 3 p.m. If Stanford manages
to get by Fresno State, it will face the
winner of the Duke-Texas A&M match
on Sunday.
Other teams in Stanford's half of the
draw include Florida, UCLA, Georgia
Tech and thirtf-seeded Texas Christian,
which Stanford could face Monday in
the semifinals.
However, the other half of the draw
includes USC, Texas, Georgia and
fourth-seeded Mississippi State. The
winner of Stanford's half of the draw
will have a difficult time facing any of
these teams in Tuesday's final.
"When I look at USC's bracket, I'm
just glad we're in the other half," said
assistant coach John Whitlinger. "There
are some really tough teams in there."
Stanford faced both Mississippi State
and Georgia in National Indoors, beat
ing both 4-3. Both of Stanford's two
losses this season come in 3-4 shortcom
ings to USC.
However, Gould said he feels assured
that win or lose, his team can do well
against any opponents.
"I have a lot of confidence in my
guys," said Gould, whose team sports

four starters who won the national title
in 1992. "They've been through it
before, and they're dedicated to a great
team result."
Stanford's players are also confident
of their chances.
"We're right where we want to be,"
said senior All-American Michael Flana
gan. "We have the best team record
since I've been here.
"My frosh year, we were expected to

win," Flanagan continued, referring to a
team that lost in the semifinals. "My
sophomore year (when the team won
the tournament) we just went in and
played tennis. This year is kind of the
same. We didn't know what to expect,
but in the back of our minds, now we all
know how good we are. We'll see."
Flanagan will continue his tour of
duty atop the Stanford lineup. At second
singles, sophomore Jeff Salzenstein will

finish the season at the same position
where he has seen so much success this
year.
Third singles is a bit of a mystery.
While senior Robert Devens has played
most of the season at this spot, senior
Ail-American Chris Cocotos also saw a
bit of time here at the end of the year,
and Cocotos is notorious for his out-
