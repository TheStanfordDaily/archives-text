# Poruri advances to NCAA singles semifinals
## 
### Rob Ross Senior staff writer 
The team tournament may be over, yet the best col
legiate women's tennis players are still competing for
championships at the Magill Tennis Complex in
Athens, Ga. But now the glory is individual, as both the
singles and doubles championship tournaments
approach this weekend's finals.
Of the 64-member singles bracket, Stanford was
responsible for five players, the most of any school.
With four rounds played, only one Cardinal remains —
senior Laxmi Poruri.
Poruri entered the individual tournament as the top
seed, although ranked second in the country behind

Texas' Lucy Ludvigova. Poruri has blazed her way into
the final four, while Ludvigova lost in the first round to
unseeded Jana Strnadova of Syracuse University.
On Wednesday the Stanford captain upended Flori
da's No. 1 player Divya Merchant 6-3, 6-2 in her
Wednesday morning match. Later that afternoon she
disposed of Longhorn senior Jackie Moe again in
straight sets 6-2, 6-0.
Yesterday Poruri continued her superb play as she
nears the end of her college career, snatching a 4-6, 6-4,
6-3 win from Kansas' Mindy Weiner, then destroying
California's Vera Vitels 6-2, 6-3.
"Laxmi served very well and I didn't get my serve in,
which really hurts my game," said Vitels, Cal's No. 1
player. "She was leading in points all the time and it

was hard to stick to my strategy."
Third-seeded Angela Lettiere, No. 8 Paloma Col
lantes and unseeded Keri Phebus join Poruri in today's
semifinals. Poruri squares off against UCLA's Phebus,
a familiar matchup to Pacific 10 Conference fans. The
two have met twice previously this year, with Poruri
coming away victorious both times.
"I played really gutsy against Vitels and look forward
to playing Phebus," Poruri said. "Just the fact that it is
a semifinal match means it is going to be tough. She is
not going to lay down just because she has lost to me
twice this year."
The finals of the individual singles tournament will
the singles draw all were eliminat
ed Wednesday when facing higher
ranked opponents.
"If you go by the seedings, we
won the matches we were supposed
to win and lost the matches we
were supposed to lose," said Cardi
nal head coach Frank Brennan.
"They all put up a fight against
higher-seeded players. None went
down easily."
Sophomore Kim Shasby was
Stanford's only first-round casual
ty, as the former Ail-American lost
to top-20 seed Pam Nelson of Cal
7-6 (7-2), 6-1. Shasby, who had an
undefeated NCAA tournament
record in dual matches while play
ing No. 5 singles, ends the season
with a 7-2 dual-match record (13-8
overall).
Senior Kristine Kurth and
freshmen Katie Schlukebir and
Sandra De Silva all ventured into
the second round before falling.
After handling Clemson's Janice
Durden by identical 6-2 scores,
Kurth ran into quarterfinal-bound
Vitels and lost 7-5, 6-3. Kurth, who
missed making the Ail-American
cut by one round, ends her Stan
ford career with a 16-7 dual meet
record (24-14 overall). The transfer
senior thus ends her three-year

Cardinal career with a 71-29 career
dual match ledger.
"We're going to miss Kristine,"
Brennan said. "She added a lot to
this team and we'll be sorry to see
her go."
The two Stanford freshman
both lost in the second round. De
Silva, who went undefeated in
dual-match play before the NCAA
tournament, downed Heather
Greene of South Carolina in
straight sets before being upended
by Bruin Jane Chi, who was seeded
sixth in the tournament and played
her way to the semifinals. De Silva
forced Chi into a first-set tiebreak
er, then dropped the tiebreaker and
the second set. She finishes her
first year at Stanford with a 22-3
dual match record (38-6 overall).
Schlukebir, who has recorded
several impressive victories over
the course of this year's NCAA's,
almost upset Ole Miss' Collantes in
the second round, dropping a tight
three-setter 6-7 (3-7), 6-4, 6-3. En
route, the freshman beat Arizona's
Michelle Oldham 6-4, 6-3. Schluke
bir thus ends an outstanding first
year on the Farm with a 22-3 dual
meet record, including chalking up
a 4-0 mark in NCAA team tourna
ment play.
In doubles, the second-seeded
team of Schlukebir-Poruri was
upset in the first round by Geor
gia's No. 2 duo of Samara-Shep
pard 6-1, 4-6, 6-4.

the final four, while Ludvigova lost in the first round to
unseeded Jana Strnadova of Syracuse University.
On Wednesday the Stanford captain upended Flori
da's No. 1 player Divya Merchant 6-3, 6-2 in her
Wednesday morning match. Later that afternoon she
disposed of Longhorn senior Jackie Moe again in
straight sets 6-2, 6-0.
Yesterday Poruri continued her superb play as she
nears the end of her college career, snatching a 4-6, 6-4,
6-3 win from Kansas' Mindy Weiner, then destroying
California's Vera Vitels 6-2, 6-3.
"Laxmi served very well and I didn't get my serve in,
which really hurts my game," said Vitels, Cal's No. 1
player. "She was leading in points all the time and it

was hard to stick to my strategy."
Third-seeded Angela Lettiere, No. 8 Paloma Col
lantes and unseeded Keri Phebus join Poruri in today's
semifinals. Poruri squares off against UCLA's Phebus,
a familiar matchup to Pacific 10 Conference fans. The
two have met twice previously this year, with Poruri
coming away victorious both times.
"I played really gutsy against Vitels and look forward
to playing Phebus," Poruri said. "Just the fact that it is
a semifinal match means it is going to be tough. She is
not going to lay down just because she has lost to me
twice this year."
The finals of the individual singles tournament will
the singles draw all were eliminat
ed Wednesday when facing higher
ranked opponents.
"If you go by the seedings, we
won the matches we were supposed
to win and lost the matches we
were supposed to lose," said Cardi
nal head coach Frank Brennan.
"They all put up a fight against
higher-seeded players. None went
down easily."
Sophomore Kim Shasby was
Stanford's only first-round casual
ty, as the former Ail-American lost
to top-20 seed Pam Nelson of Cal
7-6 (7-2), 6-1. Shasby, who had an
undefeated NCAA tournament
record in dual matches while play
ing No. 5 singles, ends the season
with a 7-2 dual-match record (13-8
overall).
Senior Kristine Kurth and
freshmen Katie Schlukebir and
Sandra De Silva all ventured into
the second round before falling.
After handling Clemson's Janice
Durden by identical 6-2 scores,
Kurth ran into quarterfinal-bound
Vitels and lost 7-5, 6-3. Kurth, who
missed making the Ail-American
cut by one round, ends her Stan
ford career with a 16-7 dual meet
record (24-14 overall). The transfer
senior thus ends her three-year

Cardinal career with a 71-29 career
dual match ledger.
"We're going to miss Kristine,"
Brennan said. "She added a lot to
this team and we'll be sorry to see
her go."
The two Stanford freshman
both lost in the second round. De
Silva, who went undefeated in
dual-match play before the NCAA
tournament, downed Heather
Greene of South Carolina in
straight sets before being upended
by Bruin Jane Chi, who was seeded
sixth in the tournament and played
her way to the semifinals. De Silva
forced Chi into a first-set tiebreak
er, then dropped the tiebreaker and
the second set. She finishes her
first year at Stanford with a 22-3
dual match record (38-6 overall).
Schlukebir, who has recorded
several impressive victories over
the course of this year's NCAA's,
almost upset Ole Miss' Collantes in
the second round, dropping a tight
three-setter 6-7 (3-7), 6-4, 6-3. En
route, the freshman beat Arizona's
Michelle Oldham 6-4, 6-3. Schluke
bir thus ends an outstanding first
year on the Farm with a 22-3 dual
meet record, including chalking up
a 4-0 mark in NCAA team tourna
ment play.
In doubles, the second-seeded
team of Schlukebir-Poruri was
upset in the first round by Geor
gia's No. 2 duo of Samara-Shep
pard 6-1, 4-6, 6-4.
