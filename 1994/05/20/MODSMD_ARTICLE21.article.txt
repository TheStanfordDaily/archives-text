The team tournament may be over, yet the best col
legiate women's tennis players are still competing for
championships at the Magill Tennis Complex in
Athens, Ga. But now the glory is individual, as both the
singles and doubles championship tournaments
approach this weekend's finals.
Of the 64-member singles bracket, Stanford was
responsible for five players, the most of any school.
With four rounds played, only one Cardinal remains â€”
senior Laxmi Poruri.
Poruri entered the individual tournament as the top
seed, although ranked second in the country behind

Texas' Lucy Ludvigova. Poruri has blazed her way into
the final four, while Ludvigova lost in the first round to
unseeded Jana Strnadova of Syracuse University.
On Wednesday the Stanford captain upended Flori
da's No. 1 player Divya Merchant 6-3, 6-2 in her
Wednesday morning match. Later that afternoon she
disposed of Longhorn senior Jackie Moe again in
straight sets 6-2, 6-0.
Yesterday Poruri continued her superb play as she
nears the end of her college career, snatching a 4-6, 6-4,
6-3 win from Kansas' Mindy Weiner, then destroying
California's Vera Vitels 6-2, 6-3.
"Laxmi served very well and I didn't get my serve in,
which really hurts my game," said Vitels, Cal's No. 1
player. "She was leading in points all the time and it

was hard to stick to my strategy."
Third-seeded Angela Lettiere, No. 8 Paloma Col
lantes and unseeded Keri Phebus join Poruri in today's
semifinals. Poruri squares off against UCLA's Phebus,
a familiar matchup to Pacific 10 Conference fans. The
two have met twice previously this year, with Poruri
coming away victorious both times.
"I played really gutsy against Vitels and look forward
to playing Phebus," Poruri said. "Just the fact that it is
a semifinal match means it is going to be tough. She is
not going to lay down just because she has lost to me
twice this year."
The finals of the individual singles tournament will
