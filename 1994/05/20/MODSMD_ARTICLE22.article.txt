# Crew set to stroke in Pac-10 Championships

"It's basically the reason we row
all year."
The words of senior rower Mar
tin Schwartz emphasize the impor
tance of the upcoming Pacific 10
Conference Championship Races
for the Stanford men's and
women's crews.
Seeded third behind the Univer
sity of Washington and Berkeley,
the Cardinal travels to Sacramento
this weekend to meet the best of
the West in a meet which will
determine the rest of the season.
Saturday finds both Cardinal
varsity boats paired with Cal, in a
crucial preliminary heat reminis
cent of the Big Row. According to
Schwartz, this heat helps to deter
mine the final lane assignments,
which are a significant factor in
inevitably windy course condi
tions. The top two finishers are
awarded sponsored trips to nation

als the following weekend, while
the third place team may go of its
own account.
But nationals are not the pre
sent concern, as the Cardinal faces
the immediate hurdle of the ever
competitive Pac-lOs.
"We'd love to go to nationals,
but we're not even looking that far
ahead at this point, we're just con
centrating on one race at a time,"
said senior Larissa Cochron.
This year has not proven com
pletely successful for Stanford in
head-to-head competition with its
Pac-10 rivals. Stanford dropped all
races to Cal in the Big Row and
suffered a sizable loss to Washing
ton in the Opening Day Races May
7. However, these races are a thing
of the past, and the optimism of
the teams has not faltered due to
such struggles.
"We're looking to have the best
race of our season, to pull off an
upset," said senior Chris Fleis
chner.
Such a feat is definitely within
reach, as last year the Stanford
men came seemingly out of
nowhere to grab a strong second
place finish at Pac-lOs, and later
garnered seventh place in nation
als. Another upset victory
would be especially sweet for both
the men's and women's varsity
squads, which are composed
largely of seniors who have perse
vered through four years of dedi
cation and hard work.
"It's the final thing that I will
be doing here," Cochron said.
"It's the culmination of the whole
season â€” of all of my crew experi
ences at Stanford."
However, to repeat such a suc
cessful performance as last year's,
the Cardinal must be mentally as
well as physically prepared for the
challenge and pressure of the Pac
10s. The team has spent the past
week in light training, developing
the focus and concentration nec
essary to compete with the best.
"We've just been trying to
solidify our boat, to move as a
unit. We've gotten a lot of good
racing experience this year and
we'd prepared well for those,"
said Cochron. "It's going to be
tough, but once we get out there it
will hit us. Right now I just want
to race, to just get out and do it."
Her sense of urgency is shared
by the members of all the teams,
and indicates the desire and
determination of the Stanford
squads. The Cardinal hopes to
maintain this intensity through
the weekend, and emerge a suc
cess in Sacramento.
"It's a matter of just getting
down to it, of gathering the inten
sity and aggression that this race
needs," said varsity sophomore
Barrett Adams. "We need to
decide that we're just going to
tear up the rest of the field and
that's all there is to it."
