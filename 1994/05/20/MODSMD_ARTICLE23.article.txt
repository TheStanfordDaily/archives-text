With a balanced team of some of the
best men and women riders in the nation,
the Stanford cycling team will gun for
gold this weekend at the Collegiate
National Championships in Wichita
Falls, Texas.
"Our team is definitely good enough to
win," said graduate student Derek
Bouchard-Hall.
Stanford will let slip an elite squad of
10 cyclists to chase down the national
title. The five men in this group are grad

students Bouchard-Hall, Dario Falquier,
Takeshi Doi, Bill Lloyd and Lee Fleming.
The Stanford women include grad stu
dents Bettina Romer, Cynthia Ferguson
and Megan Troxell, along with senior
Nicole Freedman and junior Tracy
Timms.
"We're all pretty excited this year,"
Bouchard-Hall said. "If things go our
way, we definitely have the men and
women to take it."
Stanford's success in Nationals will be
based on this depth of talent. Many teams
have a few stand-out individuals, but
Stanford's bid for the victory jersey will

be based on its across-the-board strength.
"We've got a nice arsenal," said coach
Art Walker.
Among the men, Bouchard-Hall is
expected to be one of the Cardinal's most
potent weapons. Bouchard-Hall is among
the strongest riders in collegiate cycling
and also races for a prestigious trade
team, Team Shaklee, outside Stanford.
This will be his fifth appearance at
Nationals.

be Timms, the 1992 National Collegiate
