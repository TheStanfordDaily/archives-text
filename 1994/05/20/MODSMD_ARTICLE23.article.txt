# Cyclers pedal into championships

### Joseph Hei Staff writer 
With a balanced team of some of the
best men and women riders in the nation,
the Stanford cycling team will gun for
gold this weekend at the Collegiate
National Championships in Wichita
Falls, Texas.
"Our team is definitely good enough to
win," said graduate student Derek
Bouchard-Hall.
Stanford will let slip an elite squad of
10 cyclists to chase down the national
title. The five men in this group are grad

students Bouchard-Hall, Dario Falquier,
Takeshi Doi, Bill Lloyd and Lee Fleming.
The Stanford women include grad stu
dents Bettina Romer, Cynthia Ferguson
and Megan Troxell, along with senior
Nicole Freedman and junior Tracy
Timms.
"We're all pretty excited this year,"
Bouchard-Hall said. "If things go our
way, we definitely have the men and
women to take it."
Stanford's success in Nationals will be
based on this depth of talent. Many teams
have a few stand-out individuals, but
Stanford's bid for the victory jersey will

be based on its across-the-board strength.
"We've got a nice arsenal," said coach
Art Walker.
Among the men, Bouchard-Hall is
expected to be one of the Cardinal's most
potent weapons. Bouchard-Hall is among
the strongest riders in collegiate cycling
and also races for a prestigious trade
team, Team Shaklee, outside Stanford.
This will be his fifth appearance at
Nationals.
The big gun for Stanford's women will
be Timms, the 1992 National Collegiate

and men will row in the Pac-10 Championships this weekend in Sacramento.
Road Race champion. Timms, one
of the key figures on last year's
National Champion team time trial
squad, also provides the Cardinal
with an extra level of performance
and experience.
"Different people will play differ
ent roles in order for us to win as a
team," Troxell said.
Indeed, every rider will play a

crucial part. On the men's squad
Doi provides strong sprinting,
Falquier anchors with his tremen
dous endurance and Lloyd and
Fleming can contribute either way.
On the women's squad Freed man
— the second best rider in the west
ern conference — provides sharp
sprinting and Ferguson and Troxell
lend endurance.
"I think we're taking one of the
strongest teams in recent years,"
Timms said.
Despite the undoubted caliber of
the team, the flat courses introduce

an element of uncertainty to the
weekend, especially in the road race.
"Flat courses focus more on team
tactics, which is good because we
work well together," Timms said.
On the other hand, because flat
races are determined less on
strength, the race could depend
more than usual on luck. Also, the
conditions are expected to be very
hot for the huge fields of riders —
more than 100 compared to 20 or so
in the regular season.
Nevertheless, other teams will
face the same hurdles without Stan

ford's running start. For instance,
UC-San Diego, third in the western
conference behind Stanford, will
field a strong men's squad but likely
will send only one woman.
Despite indefinite scouting
reports from the East and Midwest,
western rival Cal Poly-San Luis
Obispo, No. 1 in the Western Con
ference, will likely be the team Stan
ford must beat.

body else," Falquier said, "and we
would very much like to come home
with 10 stars-and-stripes jerseys."
