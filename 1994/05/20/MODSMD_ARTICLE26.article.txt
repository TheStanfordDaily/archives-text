## What planet do these people come from? Man twice amputated by train 
### 
LITTLEVILLE, Ala. (AP) â€” A man
lying alongside railroad tracks was struck
by a train that severed his left leg, a
repeat of an accident eight years earlier
that cost him his right leg.
The train's engineer spotted Terry R.
Mills along the tracks Monday with one
leg draped over a rail, but could not stop
in time, said Rick Harris, a spokesman
for the railroad company, Norfolk
Southern Corp.
"The report said the engineer blew the

horn trying to get him to move, but he
wouldn't," Assistant Police Chief David
Thomason said.
Harris said the incident took place near
the site where Mills lost his other leg in
1986. Mills, 32, lives nearby.
Mills had been drinking heavily both
times he was hit, Thomason said.
Mills, whose leg was severed just below
the knee, was in stable condition
Wednesday at Northwest Medical Center
in Russellville, in far northwest Alabama.
