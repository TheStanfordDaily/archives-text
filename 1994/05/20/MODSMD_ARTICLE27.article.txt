# No tunes for convicted molester

HOUSTON (AP) â€” A judge wanted to
punish a piano teacher for molesting two
girls in a way that affected him most. So
he ordered George Marrs to stay away
from the keyboard for 20 years.
That condition was part of the proba
tion State District Judge Ted Poe
slapped on Marrs as part of a plea
arrangement that kept the musician out
of jail for fondling 9- and 10-year-old
girls.
"I took away the most important thing
to him," Poe said. "I don't know anything
about pianos. I don't like pianos. But to
him, that piano was the most important
thing in his life."
Marrs, 66, was accused of molesting
the girls at his home during piano
lessons. Both girls eventually told their
parents, who notified authorities.
Marrs, who pleaded no contest
Wednesday, also must donate his
$12,000 piano to a children's home and
post a sign on the front door of his sub
urban Houston home that warns anyone
under 18 to stay away.
Poe conceded Thursday that Marrs

might get away with playing a piano
somewhere other than his home. The
intent of the peculiar probationary
clause, however, was to keep him from
ever owning a piano again, thus stop
ping him from giving lessons, the judge
said.
A probation officer, in periodic visits to
Marrs' home, will keep an eye out for
new pianos, Poe said.
Neil McCabe, a constitutional law pro
fessor at Houston's South Texas College
of Law, predicted the no-piano clause in
Marrs' sentence eventually would be
tested in court.
"Somebody will hear piano music com
ing out of the guy's home," McCabe said.
"There will be a piano-police raid on his
house and he'll be brought out kicking
and screaming and be put in prison."
McCabe added that, in court, Marrs'
right to play the piano probably would
outweigh the government's interest in
barring him from doing so, although forc
ing him to give away his piano was a
legitimate means of precluding any
opportunity to molest other children.
