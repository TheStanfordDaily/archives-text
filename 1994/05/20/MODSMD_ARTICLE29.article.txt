# Wolfgram elected Daily editor
## 
### Andy Dworkin Colleen Krueger Señor staff writers 
In a stunning victory over busty,
blonde, fellow-Midwesterner Allison
Parker, ravishing redhead Elise
Wolfgram was elected The Stanford
Daily's next editor in chief last night.
Walloping chief rival Courtney
Thorne-Smith by a 64-1 margin,
the Chicagoan swept into power on
a platform of "hoops and hops."
"Can I be totally candid?" the
sultry industrial engineering major
slurred, taking a healthy sip of Mai
son Deutz. "The New York Knicks
are my favorite basketball team.
Really. Just don't tell my friends in
Chicago, OK?"
Cryptically, Elsie credited her
victory to "God and Sanford — I
swear my ties to Sanny won't mar
our ever-unbiased coverage of the
ASSU."
As Wolfgram's first order of
business, she has promised to liber
ate both Henry and Jack from The
Daily's locked storage closet.
Yet Wolfgram's election was not
without controversy. Her "longtime
companion," Jake "Mr. Smiley"
Peters, is editor of the Notre Dame
paper. Naysayers accused the leggy
leader of trying to form a "media
mafia."
"I just have one thing to say to
those wine-cooler-drinking, West
or-East-Coast-living numbnuts,"
Wolfgram said. "Bring it! BRING
IT! BRING IT!"
Wolfgram's liver also applauded
her victory.
"I'm looking very much forward
to many exciting nights," the orat
ing organ said. "I've acquired a
taste for Weinhard's. Now I'll get as
much as I can hold. Ha ha ha ha!"
Supporters say Wolfgram's lead
ership potential was demonstrated
when the low-fat guru led The Daily
to its long-awaited victory against
Berkeley's Daily Californian in this
year's Ink Bowl. She also knocked
everyone's sox off in this year's
Knight Fellows softball game.
"I just thought of Michael Jor
dan and his minor-league career,"
she said. "He's the biggest name in
minor-league baseball. Now I'm the
biggest name in minor-league jour
nalism."
Other staffers could hardy con
trol their almost-orgasmic exuber
ance after Wolfgram's win.
"This is penusitile," Science Edi
tor M'ich&el Sloemmoer said. "Wel

come to the jungle. Take me down
to Paradise City. She's one in a mil
lion."
"This may be sort of a Pyrrhic
victory," News Editor Romesh
Ratnesar said. "Although I sort of
find the whole sort of conceptual
artifact of an election soporific, I do
sort of feel that the enigmatic leit
motif of an Old Northwest Territo
rialist as our sort of spiritual Sven
gali could invigorate this journalis
tic endeavor. But her hands were
shaking."
"Ever since I conducted my

ground-breaking study of ofT-the
table times, I knew this is what I
wanted," Wolfgram said. "Nipples
that can cut diamonds, free smok
ing, my love for TresEx — this is
the most exciting day of my life.
"Except for Da Bulls' NBA
Championships, of course."
Yesterday's election also select
ed three members of The Daily's
Board of Directors. Mark
Rogowsky will be the student at
large; Ann Gregg will be the busi
ness member; and Jim Bettinger
will be the faculty/staff member.
