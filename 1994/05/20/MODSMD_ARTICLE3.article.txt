# Faculty hear pitch for Asian-American major
## Senate debates roles of teaching, research 
### Andy Dworkin Colleen Krueger Staff writers 
Just one week after Concerned Students
for Asian-American Studies prompted the
Faculty Senate to adjourn early, group
members presented a report at the senate's
meeting yesterday advocating the establish
ment of a major in Asian-American Studies.
The senate's Steering Committee placed
the students' report on this week's agenda
after the ASSU Senate passed a resolution
calling for such a presentation — one "au
thorized" way students can bring their is
sues to the faculty body, Senate Chair Pat
Jones said.
Ironically, the report followed a 45-
minute discussion on teaching at Stanford,
which included debate about whether facul
ty interest or student demand should deter
mine how resources are allocated to majors
and programs.
Two students, graduate student Karen
Ho and senior Jason Pu, led a 10-minute
presentation on the intellectual legitimacy,
administrative feasibility and history of the
struggle for an Asian-American Studies
program at Stanford. Eight other students
also attended the meeting.
"If Stanford wants to remain competitive
in shaping education for the next century

then it should, nay it must, make Asian-
American Studies and the study of other
marginalized issues a priority," Pu said,
mentioning programs like Chicano Studies
and self- defense for women.
Although the presentation went smooth
ly, English Prof. Robert Polhemus chas-

tised the protesters for in
terrupting last week's
meeting, calling it a "seri
ous breach" of his academ
ic freedom.
"No matter how anyone
feels about the grapes
protest, I did not feel that
they impinged on my acad
emic freedom," Polhemus
said. "I wanted to ask the

students here if they have any second
thoughts about shutting down the rights of
others." No other discussion of the report,
which was read at the close of yesterday's
session, was permitted.
Even though last week's protesters
claimed that a slot on the May 19 senate
agenda was their goal, Jones stressed that
the steering committee's decision to sched
ule the presentation was not motivated by
their demonstration.
"The steering committee felt under no


Jones
obligation to place the item on
today's agenda," Jones said. "We
were following the ASSU's action,
but the decision to place it on
today's agenda specifically was an
administrative one."
"This is a privileged opportuni
ty," she said, adding that the sen
ate is neither the most productive
nor the most appropriate forum
for student issues.
Before hearing the student pre
sentation, senators spent about 45
minutes engaged in a broad-rang
ing and often philosophical discus
sion on teaching at Stanford.
Debate covered such topics as
whether Stanford faculty have
spread their time too thin by offer
ing too many courses; what the
proper balance is between teach
ing by senior faculty and non
tenure-track faculty; and whether
the University needs to focus
more on research or on teaching.
The importance of such ques
tions was stressed by History
Prof. James Sheehan, who also
chairs the Commission on Under
graduate Education.
"I think the question of the
relationship between obligations
and resources is the question
Sheehan said. "It is the question
from which all others flow."
The discussion grew out of a
report that asked whether too
many courses are being taught by
faculty who are not on the tenure
track. The document, prepared by

the senate's Planning and Policy
Board, also suggested that some
faculty might have over-commit
ted themselves by having to teach
both for departments and inter
disciplinary programs.
Economics Prof. Roger Noll
pointed out that of all the inter
disciplinary programs, only a few
offer many new courses. Most, he
said, just combine courses already
being taught under one new head
ing and thus don't take much
extra faculty time.
Still, Noll said, "interdisci
plinary programs should die if
there isn't a core of tenure-track
faculty" who support them.
Arthur Bienenstock, a profes
sor at the Stanford Linear Accel
erator Center who chaired the
group that created the report,
said the document results from a
"sense that the School (of
Humanities and Sciences) is over
committed in its teaching pro
grams."
Part of this over-commitment
is demonstrated by the large
number of non-tenure-track fac
ulty that teach classes, even intro
ductory courses. The report said
$13 million was spent on such
teachers in 1992.
Noll, however, pointed out that
the University might not want all
classes, especially classes in popu
lar departments, to be taught by
non-tenure-track teachers. Cul
tures, Ideas and Values and Writ
ing and Critical Thinking classes,
for example, rely very heavily on
non-tenure-track faculty, Politi
cal Science Prof. David Abernethy
said.

Anthropology Prof. Sylvia
Yanagisako pointed out that
many of the questions being
asked could be turned on their
heads.
Instead of asking whether Stan
ford should offer courses faculty
won't teach, Yanagisako said, the
University should ask itself
whether it should continue to hire
faculty who are not willing to
teach courses students want to
take.
Biology Prof. Robert Simoni
asked whether Stanford should
try to remove some of its
resources from teaching and focus
more on research if teaching over
commits the faculty.
Bienenstock, who came here
from Harvard, said he thought
two things that make Stanford
unique are the ease with which
programs and classes can be
formed outside of departmental
structures and the stress placed
on teaching here.
And University President Ger
hard Casper said that education
at Stanford "can flourish only,
and can survive only, if teaching,
learning and research are just
viewed as different aspects of the
same thing."
The senate also spent a few
minutes discussing a proposal to
alter and standardize the way
that courses are cross-listed. Cit
ing the shortage of time to discuss
the proposal, however, the senate
voted to postpone further discus
sion of the proposal indefinitely
and Jones expressed the hope
that next year's senate would
take up the issue.

then it should, nay it must, make Asian-
American Studies and the study of other
marginalized issues a priority," Pu said,
mentioning programs like Chicano Studies
and self- defense for women.
Although the presentation went smooth
ly, English Prof. Robert Polhemus chas-

tised the protesters for in
terrupting last week's
meeting, calling it a "seri
ous breach" of his academ
ic freedom.
"No matter how anyone
feels about the grapes
protest, I did not feel that
they impinged on my acad
emic freedom," Polhemus
said. "I wanted to ask the

students here if they have any second
thoughts about shutting down the rights of
others." No other discussion of the report,
which was read at the close of yesterday's
session, was permitted.
Even though last week's protesters
claimed that a slot on the May 19 senate
agenda was their goal, Jones stressed that
the steering committee's decision to sched
ule the presentation was not motivated by
their demonstration.
"The steering committee felt under no


Jones
obligation to place the item on
today's agenda," Jones said. "We
were following the ASSU's action,
but the decision to place it on
today's agenda specifically was an
administrative one."
"This is a privileged opportuni
ty," she said, adding that the sen
ate is neither the most productive
nor the most appropriate forum
for student issues.
Before hearing the student pre
sentation, senators spent about 45
minutes engaged in a broad-rang
ing and often philosophical discus
sion on teaching at Stanford.
Debate covered such topics as
whether Stanford faculty have
spread their time too thin by offer
ing too many courses; what the
proper balance is between teach
ing by senior faculty and non
tenure-track faculty; and whether
the University needs to focus
more on research or on teaching.
The importance of such ques
tions was stressed by History
Prof. James Sheehan, who also
chairs the Commission on Under
graduate Education.
"I think the question of the
relationship between obligations
and resources is the question
Sheehan said. "It is the question
from which all others flow."
The discussion grew out of a
report that asked whether too
many courses are being taught by
faculty who are not on the tenure
track. The document, prepared by

the senate's Planning and Policy
Board, also suggested that some
faculty might have over-commit
ted themselves by having to teach
both for departments and inter
disciplinary programs.
Economics Prof. Roger Noll
pointed out that of all the inter
disciplinary programs, only a few
offer many new courses. Most, he
said, just combine courses already
being taught under one new head
ing and thus don't take much
extra faculty time.
Still, Noll said, "interdisci
plinary programs should die if
there isn't a core of tenure-track
faculty" who support them.
Arthur Bienenstock, a profes
sor at the Stanford Linear Accel
erator Center who chaired the
group that created the report,
said the document results from a
"sense that the School (of
Humanities and Sciences) is over
committed in its teaching pro
grams."
Part of this over-commitment
is demonstrated by the large
number of non-tenure-track fac
ulty that teach classes, even intro
ductory courses. The report said
$13 million was spent on such
teachers in 1992.
Noll, however, pointed out that
the University might not want all
classes, especially classes in popu
lar departments, to be taught by
non-tenure-track teachers. Cul
tures, Ideas and Values and Writ
ing and Critical Thinking classes,
for example, rely very heavily on
non-tenure-track faculty, Politi
cal Science Prof. David Abernethy
said.

Anthropology Prof. Sylvia
Yanagisako pointed out that
many of the questions being
asked could be turned on their
heads.
Instead of asking whether Stan
ford should offer courses faculty
won't teach, Yanagisako said, the
University should ask itself
whether it should continue to hire
faculty who are not willing to
teach courses students want to
take.
Biology Prof. Robert Simoni
asked whether Stanford should
try to remove some of its
resources from teaching and focus
more on research if teaching over
commits the faculty.
Bienenstock, who came here
from Harvard, said he thought
two things that make Stanford
unique are the ease with which
programs and classes can be
formed outside of departmental
structures and the stress placed
on teaching here.
And University President Ger
hard Casper said that education
at Stanford "can flourish only,
and can survive only, if teaching,
learning and research are just
viewed as different aspects of the
same thing."
The senate also spent a few
minutes discussing a proposal to
alter and standardize the way
that courses are cross-listed. Cit
ing the shortage of time to discuss
the proposal, however, the senate
voted to postpone further discus
sion of the proposal indefinitely
and Jones expressed the hope
that next year's senate would
take up the issue.
Just one week after Concerned Students
for Asian-American Studies prompted the
Faculty Senate to adjourn early, group
members presented a report at the senate's
meeting yesterday advocating the establish
ment of a major in Asian-American Studies.
The senate's Steering Committee placed
the students' report on this week's agenda
after the ASSU Senate passed a resolution
calling for such a presentation — one "au
thorized" way students can bring their is
sues to the faculty body, Senate Chair Pat
Jones said.
Ironically, the report followed a 45-
minute discussion on teaching at Stanford,
which included debate about whether facul
ty interest or student demand should deter
mine how resources are allocated to majors
and programs.
Two students, graduate student Karen
Ho and senior Jason Pu, led a 10-minute
presentation on the intellectual legitimacy,
administrative feasibility and history of the
struggle for an Asian-American Studies
program at Stanford. Eight other students
also attended the meeting.
"If Stanford wants to remain competitive
in shaping education for the next century

then it should, nay it must, make Asian-
American Studies and the study of other
marginalized issues a priority," Pu said,
mentioning programs like Chicano Studies
and self- defense for women.
