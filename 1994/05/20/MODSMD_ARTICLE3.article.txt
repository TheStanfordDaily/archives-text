# Faculty hear pitch for Asian-American major
## Senate debates roles of teaching, research 
### Andy Dworkin Colleen Krueger Staff writers 
Just one week after Concerned Students
for Asian-American Studies prompted the
Faculty Senate to adjourn early, group
members presented a report at the senate's
meeting yesterday advocating the establish
ment of a major in Asian-American Studies.
The senate's Steering Committee placed
the students' report on this week's agenda
after the ASSU Senate passed a resolution
calling for such a presentation â€” one "au
thorized" way students can bring their is
sues to the faculty body, Senate Chair Pat
Jones said.
Ironically, the report followed a 45-
minute discussion on teaching at Stanford,
which included debate about whether facul
ty interest or student demand should deter
mine how resources are allocated to majors
and programs.
Two students, graduate student Karen
Ho and senior Jason Pu, led a 10-minute
presentation on the intellectual legitimacy,
administrative feasibility and history of the
struggle for an Asian-American Studies
program at Stanford. Eight other students
also attended the meeting.
"If Stanford wants to remain competitive
in shaping education for the next century

then it should, nay it must, make Asian-
American Studies and the study of other
marginalized issues a priority," Pu said,
mentioning programs like Chicano Studies
and self- defense for women.
Although the presentation went smooth
ly, English Prof. Robert Polhemus chas-

tised the protesters for in
terrupting last week's
meeting, calling it a "seri
ous breach" of his academ
ic freedom.
"No matter how anyone
feels about the grapes
protest, I did not feel that
they impinged on my acad
emic freedom," Polhemus
said. "I wanted to ask the

students here if they have any second
thoughts about shutting down the rights of
others." No other discussion of the report,
which was read at the close of yesterday's
session, was permitted.
Even though last week's protesters
claimed that a slot on the May 19 senate
agenda was their goal, Jones stressed that
the steering committee's decision to sched
ule the presentation was not motivated by
their demonstration.
"The steering committee felt under no
