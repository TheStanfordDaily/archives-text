# Athletes' vandalism of statue not a 'hate crime'

Although many have condemned the
Monday morning vandalism of the "Gay
Liberation" sculpture as a hate crime, the
Santa Clara District Attorney's office said
yesterday that the seven athletes who have
been implicated will only face charges relat
ing to property damage. Three will also be
charged with resisting arrest.
Karyn Sinunu, deputy district attorney
for Santa Clara County, will be meeting
with police for the second time today and
should have charges ready by early next
week, she said.
"There's no doubt that there was crimi
nal activity," she said. "But this is not a hate
crime."
Prosecution under hate crime statutes
can only occur when an individual's civil
rights are violated, explained Sinunu. As an
institution, Stanford University does not
have "civil rights."
"It's outrageous and it's repulsive, but
it's a property crime," Sinunu said.
Determining repair costs for the four-fig

ured artwork is the main stumbling block to
concluding the investigation, Stanford Po
lice Capt. Raoul Niemeyer said.
If damages to the artwork exceed $5,000,
the seven athletes will likely be charged
with a felony for the alleged crime. An art
conservator will be finishing the evaluation
today, according to Stanford Museum Di
rector Tom Seligman.
Penalties for a felony vandalism convic
tion can carry sentences ranging from fines,
restitution and community service to jail
time. None of the students have any prior
felony convictions, Niemeyer said.
Although the investigation has not been
completed, prominent voices continue to de
nounce the incident.
"I find this action to be very unfortu
nate," head football coach Bill Walsh said in
a statement yesterday.
"I suggest that the young men involved,
after apologizing, place themselves in an al
cohol counseling program," he said. "Let us
hope this shocking experience will teach
them a life-long lesson. These kind of acts
