# Athletes' vandalism of statue not a 'hate crime'
## 
### Burt Herman Editorial staff 
Although many have condemned the
Monday morning vandalism of the "Gay
Liberation" sculpture as a hate crime, the
Santa Clara District Attorney's office said
yesterday that the seven athletes who have
been implicated will only face charges relat
ing to property damage. Three will also be
charged with resisting arrest.
Karyn Sinunu, deputy district attorney
for Santa Clara County, will be meeting
with police for the second time today and
should have charges ready by early next
week, she said.
"There's no doubt that there was crimi
nal activity," she said. "But this is not a hate
crime."
Prosecution under hate crime statutes
can only occur when an individual's civil
rights are violated, explained Sinunu. As an
institution, Stanford University does not
have "civil rights."
"It's outrageous and it's repulsive, but
it's a property crime," Sinunu said.
Determining repair costs for the four-fig

ured artwork is the main stumbling block to
concluding the investigation, Stanford Po
lice Capt. Raoul Niemeyer said.
If damages to the artwork exceed $5,000,
the seven athletes will likely be charged
with a felony for the alleged crime. An art
conservator will be finishing the evaluation
today, according to Stanford Museum Di
rector Tom Seligman.
Penalties for a felony vandalism convic
tion can carry sentences ranging from fines,
restitution and community service to jail
time. None of the students have any prior
felony convictions, Niemeyer said.
Although the investigation has not been
completed, prominent voices continue to de
nounce the incident.
"I find this action to be very unfortu
nate," head football coach Bill Walsh said in
a statement yesterday.
"I suggest that the young men involved,
after apologizing, place themselves in an al
cohol counseling program," he said. "Let us
hope this shocking experience will teach
them a life-long lesson. These kind of acts
just cannot be tolerated and can
not be excused."
University President Gerhard
Casper read his Wednesday state
ment denouncing the alleged van
dalism at yesterday's Faculty Sen
ate meeting.
Sinunu said she has been
receiving numerous phone calls
from around the Bay Area. "I've
had the phone ringing constant
ly," she said. "There's just an out
pouring of outrage."
But Sinunu also expressed
hope that the publicity surround
ing the alleged crime will serve to

educate the community.
"I do think maybe something
good will come out of this," she
said. "Maybe we're all learning
the hard way."
George Segal, creator of the
controversial piece, expressed his
dismay at the alleged actions of
the seven athletes.
"I don't think that it makes
sense to justify this recent event
as simply boys blowing off steam,"
Segal said from his New Jersey
home. "There is no justification to
damage a sculpture like that.
"They have to be responsible
for their actions," he said. "Cele
brating the winning of a sports
championship does not give them
license to do this."
Segal — whose work is dis

played in galleries around the
world — said that only select
pieces of his work have drawn con
troversy in the past.
"The few times I've dealt with
public issues there's been this
kind of thorny reaction," he said.
The seven athletes arrested
were junior Dusty Allen, junior
Mark Butterfield, sophomore
Robert Gardner, junior Thomas
Irwin, junior Todd Laßocca,
freshman Brendan Sullivan and
sophomore Jason White.
After leaving a celebration of
the baseball team's recent Six-Pac
championship at the Delta Tau
Delta house, the seven allegedly
drove to the Quad where some
proceeded to pour black paint over
the white-coated figures. A bench

was also allegedly used to strike
the $150,000 artwork. The alleged
vandals are suspected of consum
ing alcohol before the incident.
A monument to the 1969
Stonewall riots in New York that
were the genesis of the gay libera
tion movement, the artwork has
been vandalized numerous times
in the past.
Stanford Judicial Affairs Offi
cer Sally Cole met with the stu
dents yesterday in her investiga
tion of whether University policy
was violated. More meetings are
scheduled for today.
The athletes have not yet hired
attorneys, according to Irwin, who
added that the students are taking
a "wait-and-see" approach to the
incident.
