Three years ago, Nawwar Kasrawi was
kicked out of a campaign for the ASSU Sen
ate.
Next year, he'll be senate chair.
Kasrawi's run in 1991 was cut short after
he attempted to e-mail a campaign message
to more than 2,000 students. The message
snowballed out of control, snarling Stan
ford's computer system.
Kasrawi again ran unsuccessfully in
1992.
Now, after a successful campaign last
year and three quarters as a graduate sena
tor, Kasrawi has made his way to the very

top of the ASSU.
"I want to make sure the
ASSU continues to be an
effective force at Stan
ford," Kasrawi said, citing
manifold roles for student
government, including rep
resenting the student
body, providing services
and business projects, and
offering a forum for debate
and discussion on campus.

Kasrawi, who in an interview yesterday
declined to comment on his ill-fated 1991
senate campaign, said he has high hopes
