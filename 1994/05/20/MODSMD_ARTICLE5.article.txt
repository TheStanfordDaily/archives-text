# From outcast to insider: Kasrawi's rise in ASSU
## 
### Jim Luh Staff writer 
Three years ago, Nawwar Kasrawi was
kicked out of a campaign for the ASSU Sen
ate.
Next year, he'll be senate chair.
Kasrawi's run in 1991 was cut short after
he attempted to e-mail a campaign message
to more than 2,000 students. The message
snowballed out of control, snarling Stan
ford's computer system.
Kasrawi again ran unsuccessfully in
1992.
Now, after a successful campaign last
year and three quarters as a graduate sena
tor, Kasrawi has made his way to the very

top of the ASSU.
"I want to make sure the
ASSU continues to be an
effective force at Stan
ford," Kasrawi said, citing
manifold roles for student
government, including rep
resenting the student
body, providing services
and business projects, and
offering a forum for debate
and discussion on campus.

Kasrawi, who in an interview yesterday
declined to comment on his ill-fated 1991
senate campaign, said he has high hopes


Kasrawi
that the growth of the ASSU that
he saw this year will continue next
year.
"This year, it was definitely a
rebuilding year, coming off a year
with no Council of Presidents,"
Kasrawi said. "This year has been
a very good one as far as rebuilding
contacts."
Kasrawi said the ASSU will
attempt to reach out to students in
the future and involve them in the
operations of student government.
Using senate committees to
their fullest potential is one impor
tant way the ASSU can become
more effective, Kasrawi said.
"Sometimes it's forgotten that
[the committee system] is not just
there to review things other people
bring to it,"he said. "There's defi
nitely a role for committees to . ..
generate their own issues."
Another key to improving the
ASSU's effectiveness, said Kas
rawi, is utilizing input gathered
through the newly revived dorm
representatives program.
Kasrawi said he will also work
to reinstate the senate steering
committee — which was never con
vened this year — in an altered
form. Kasrawi said he hopes the
steering committee will improve
communications between various
committees to better coordinate
the efforts of the senate as a whole.
Kasrawi, a co-terminal student
in electrical engineering, said he
will also use campus computer
resources to help link the ASSU
with the student body. He said he

will create ASSU mailing lists and
provide e-mail addresses to which
students can send questions.
In addition, Kasrawi said, stu
dents will be able to access the text
of proposed legislation through
the World Wide Web, augmenting
the on-line ASSU Constitution
and Bylaws. For those not inclined
toward computers, Kasrawi said
he will attempt to make informa
tion available on hard copy at the
ASSU office.
Kasrawi emphasized the need

'My role is basically to
represent the senate. I
don't take on specific
issues ... unless
requested to do so.'
— Nawwar Kasrawi

to ensure that publicity efforts
reach graduate students, noting
that this year's efforts to inform
students about important events
such as elections and committee
appointments only reached under
graduates.
As for representing the student
body to the administration, Kas
rawi said that the COP is better
suited as an institution for funnel
ing student opinion.
"My role is basically to repre
sent the senate," Kasrawi said. "I
don't take on specific issues ...
unless requested to do so."
Kasrawi also had ideas regard
ing his role as a leader of the sen
ate — a role that may prove espe
cially important next year, as only

a few incoming senators have pre
vious ASSU experience.
For Kasrawi, that role entails
things as simple as getting to know
all the senators to things as
involved as establishing task-ori
ented committees that allow sena
tors to follow up on areas that
interest them, Kasrawi said.
"I think it's important that
senators take on . . . individual
projects," he said. "We've seen a
model for that this year with the

entrepreneurial grants pro
gram."
The senate chair can also pro
vide leadership through another of
the chair's tasks, Kasrawi said —
that of running senate meetings
smoothly and efficiently.
"It's important that people
maintain their enthusiasm," he
said, lamenting that in previous
years, senators have lost interest
in student government early in the
year.

suited as an institution for funnel
ing student opinion.
"My role is basically to repre
sent the senate," Kasrawi said. "I
don't take on specific issues ...
unless requested to do so."
Kasrawi also had ideas regard
ing his role as a leader of the sen
ate — a role that may prove espe
cially important next year, as only

a few incoming senators have pre
vious ASSU experience.
For Kasrawi, that role entails
things as simple as getting to know
all the senators to things as
involved as establishing task-ori
ented committees that allow sena
tors to follow up on areas that
interest them, Kasrawi said.
"I think it's important that
senators take on . . . individual
projects," he said. "We've seen a
model for that this year with the

entrepreneurial grants pro
gram."
The senate chair can also pro
vide leadership through another of
the chair's tasks, Kasrawi said —
that of running senate meetings
smoothly and efficiently.
"It's important that people
maintain their enthusiasm," he
said, lamenting that in previous
years, senators have lost interest
in student government early in the
year.
