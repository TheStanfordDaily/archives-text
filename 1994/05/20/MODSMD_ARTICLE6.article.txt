# An ugly election
## Fraternity finds 'ugliest man' on campus 
### Josh Gohlke Staff writer 
It used to be subjective. Who is ugly, just
like who is not, used to be in the eye of the
beholder.
But now it is within the province of ob
jective fact. And it didn't even take a magic
mirror to decide who is the ugliest of them
all — all it took was democracy.
Yes, the votes are in, and Sigma Phi Ep

silon President Ryan Rigoli is unattractive.
Homely. Ugly, if you will.
"He is very ugly," affirmed sophomore
Kevin Burke, a member of Alpha Phi
Omega, the coed service fraternity that or
ganized the Ugly Man election. "He looks
like Screech from 'Saved by the Bell.' "
Students voted in the election by drop
ping change or bills — the amount paid sig-
nifying just how repulsive they
found the particular candidate —
in the jar of their favor. ; *e man,
woman or plant. The collected
money, which finally totaled
$258.84, was donated to the
Emergency Housing Consor
tium, a San Jose organization
which provides housing, food,
clothing and job-training to the
homeless.
The original nominees were
Civil Engineering Prof. Gil Mas

ters, the Tree, Daily columnist
Tish Williams and Casper — the
ghost, not the University presi
dent.
Rigoli, a senior, was not origi
nally a candidate, but was written
in early in the election, which ran
from Tuesday until yesterday in
White Plaza. Soon, an unstop
pable grass-roots movement had
votes as high as $10 helping to
finally declare him the most
unsightly man on campus, with
26 percent of the vote.
"I'm glad I was able to help out
the charity," said the hapless but
diplomatic Rigoli. "I guess I have
a lot of supporters."

The Tree — not any specific
man behind the costume, but the
general symbol — came in a close
second, with 25 percent of the
vote.
Favorite candidate Williams,
who had been "coming out ahead
all week" according to Alpha Phi
Omega member Mark Billian,
ended up showing a disappointing
third place with 17 percent of the
vote.
Williams was despondent.
"I'm a loser, baby," she said.
"So why don't you kill me?"
After Williams was Casper
with 12 percent, and in last place
among the original nominees was

Masters, with a scant 8 percent.
Although the Civil Engineering
170 lecturer said he had been "a
little worried" about the nomina
tion, he was relieved by the
results.
"In this case I'm honored —
happy to be last," Masters said.
Fraternity members said the
Ugly Man event is practiced in
chapters across the country, but
that they have not done it at Stan
ford since the early '80s.
Billian said Rigoli's victory will
earn him "nothing other than the
title" and that he is entitled to
"whatever fringe benefits come
with it."
