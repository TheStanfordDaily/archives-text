# An industrious student applies Econ. 1 to the world of superheroes
## New club helps fans of comics

It's 6:30 on a Thursday morning and
graduate student Mark Billian, comic
book aficionado, is fighting the rush
hour traffic on Highway 101. At 7:15
a.m. he arrives at a small warehouse in
Hayward — home to a world of fantasy
and superheroes.
Billian collects a bundle of comic
books, throws them in the back of his
Ford Taurus and returns to campus in
time for his 9 a.m. class — mission ac
complished.
An avid comic book collector, Billian
has collected between 4,000 and 5,000
comics since 1985. This year, though,
as his comic book expenditures grew to
more than $ 100 a month, Billian decid
ed to start a comic cooperative at Stan
ford.
The cooperative is made up of 10
members, all Stanford students, who
place their comic book orders through
Billian. The group saves 40 percent on

the regular price of a comic book by or
dering them from a wholesale distribu
tor in Hayward, spending a minimum
of $600 a month.
"Everyone pre-pays me for their
merchandise . . . zero risk on my part,"
said Billian.
Every week, Billian drives to Hay
ward to collect the group's weekly con

signment of comics. In the evening, co
operative members gather eagerly at
his dorm to get their new comic books.
"I generally can't get much work
done on these days," admits graduate
student Patrick Chang, a cooperative
member who goes to collect his new
batch of comics from Billian immedi-

Graduate student Mark Billian has formed a "comic book collective" to buy
