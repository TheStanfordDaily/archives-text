# An industrious student applies Econ. 1 to the world of superheroes
## New club helps fans of comics 
### Jo Marshall Staff writer 
It's 6:30 on a Thursday morning and
graduate student Mark Billian, comic
book aficionado, is fighting the rush
hour traffic on Highway 101. At 7:15
a.m. he arrives at a small warehouse in
Hayward — home to a world of fantasy
and superheroes.
Billian collects a bundle of comic
books, throws them in the back of his
Ford Taurus and returns to campus in
time for his 9 a.m. class — mission ac
complished.
An avid comic book collector, Billian
has collected between 4,000 and 5,000
comics since 1985. This year, though,
as his comic book expenditures grew to
more than $ 100 a month, Billian decid
ed to start a comic cooperative at Stan
ford.
The cooperative is made up of 10
members, all Stanford students, who
place their comic book orders through
Billian. The group saves 40 percent on

the regular price of a comic book by or
dering them from a wholesale distribu
tor in Hayward, spending a minimum
of $600 a month.
"Everyone pre-pays me for their
merchandise . . . zero risk on my part,"
said Billian.
Every week, Billian drives to Hay
ward to collect the group's weekly con

signment of comics. In the evening, co
operative members gather eagerly at
his dorm to get their new comic books.
"I generally can't get much work
done on these days," admits graduate
student Patrick Chang, a cooperative
member who goes to collect his new
batch of comics from Billian immedi-

tales of his favorite superheroes at lower prices.
ately after class.
Chang joined the cooperative
to cut back on his monthly spend
ing of $70 to $100 a month on
comic books. "Hey, if I'm getting
the same goods for a 40 percent
discount, why not?" he said.
Chang started reading
Japanese comics at an early age
while growing up in Taiwan. "Mj'
parents encouraged me to read
anything," he said. "They said
that I used to take comic books
and read them upside-down."
His favorite Japanese comic is
"Nausicaa of the Valley of Wind,"
which tells the story of a girl try
ing to save human civilization
from an ecological disaster and an
invasion of giant insects because
"she cares about living things,"
said Chang.
Compared to American super
hero comics such as "X-men" and
"Superman", Chang said he
believes that Japanese comics
have more women heroes, which
he prefers.
"When you see a strong
woman it's different than reading
about Arnold Schwarzenegger
types," Chang explained. "[Men]
are strong because of their large
biceps — with girls, they are
strong because they are coura
geous."
According to Billian, one out of
every 100 people in America reads

comic books, and the issue of
"Death of Superman" alone sold 4
million copies, he said.
"Stereotypically a person who
reads comics is between 13 and 21
and male," said Billian, adding
that "techies are more interested
in comics and so are people that
might like fantasy games."
Billian's enterprise is success
ful enough to get his competitors
worried. Lee Hester, president of
Lee's Comics in Palo Alto, said he
believes that the cooperative is
"an effort to bypass doing legiti
mate business.
"If you want to do it, open a
store and pay the taxes," said
Hester.
However, Billian maintains
that he does pay sales tax and
that he also has a resale permit. "I
understand his [Hester's] con
cern but I don't think it's realistic
that groups of 10 people will band
together and put the comic stores
out of business," Billian said.
Although Billian started the
cooperative to save money for
himself, he said he also enjoys the
logistics of it and the ability to
meet like-minded people. "I have
a great deal of fun and I have a lot
more interaction with people who
read comics," he said.
So is Billian considering open
ing a real comic shop when he
leaves Stanford? "Getting my
own comic shop is a great idea —
but from a business point, not so
good," he said, adding that he
hopes to get a better-paying job
after graduation.
