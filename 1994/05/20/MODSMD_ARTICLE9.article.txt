# After 4 dry years, Hoop to flow again
## 
### Nick Kuritzky Staff writer 
Fountain hoppers will soon
be able to add another venue to
their merry run, as the Hoop —
the fountain in front of Green
Library — will shortly run for
the first time in almost four
years.
The fountain, said Grounds
Supervisor Herb Fong, was
never fully operational because
it was poorly designed and built
with cheap materials. Corro
sion and the clogging of an inef
fective nozzle system kept the
Hoop dry when the rest of the
fountains on campus were re
activated last year.
The fountain last flowed in
1990, when it was shut off due
to California's water shortage.
Stanford was required to hold
its water use below 1987 levels
for the duration of the drought.
A rainy winter last year
allowed the University to
install new water pumps in

other campus fountains and
turn them on last spring.
Work on the Hoop began
earlier this week, and the foun
tain is currently enclosed in a
massive, black canvas tent. To
get the fountain up and run
ning, workers are installing a
newly designed nozzle system
that can better resist clogging.
In addition, they are replacing
the fountain's sand and gravel
filters and giving it a new coat
of paint.
The improvements, esti
mated to cost between $20,000
and $30,000, will allow hun
dreds of jets to spew forch a
sheet of water, as the fountain
was originally intended to do.
The repairs should be complet
ed in time for graduation,
Fong said.
Although the restoration
has been noisy, officials at
Green Library said they have
received no complaints con
cerning the nearby construc
tion.
