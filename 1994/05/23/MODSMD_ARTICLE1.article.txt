# COP to oppose grade plan
## Will support more lenient policy 
### September Trevino Staff writer 
The ASSU Council of Presidents

meeting by English Prof. Ron
Rebholz, would not bring back a

Vanessa Alvarado, along with
ASSU senator Phillip Lin and se

the proposal on the Faculty Sen
ate agenda.
But Alvarado said yesterday
those plans are on hold for the
time being, and that the COP's en

The COP will support Cohen's
plan because the members "want
to present a united front so as not
to split the vote," Alvarado said.
Cohen and three COP mem
bers met with a handful of stu
dents last night at Tresidder
Union to iron out the details of the
alternate plan. COP member Ani

saying it had been convened to
come up with a strategy for oppos
ing the conservative grading
model currently on the senate's
