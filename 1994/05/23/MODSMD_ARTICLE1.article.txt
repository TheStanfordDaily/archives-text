# COP to oppose grade plan
## Will support more lenient policy 
### September Trevino Staff writer 
The ASSU Council of Presidents
plans to speak out against proposed
changes to the grading policy at
Thursday's Faculty Senate meet
ing in hopes of delaying the sched
uled vote on the plan, COP mem
bers announced last night.
The COP will also informally
back a proposal authored by junior
David Cohen that calls for more
moderate changes to the current
policy than the changes now be
fore the senate.
The Cohen plan, which is
scheduled to be presented at the
meeting by English Prof. Ron
Rebholz, would not bring back a
failing grade and would move the
drop deadline to the seventh week
of the quarter.
Last week, COP member
Vanessa Alvarado, along with
ASSU senator Phillip Lin and se
nior Eddie Garcia, said they would

offer their own alternative plan at
the ASSU Senate meeting tomor
row, with the intention of getting
the proposal on the Faculty Sen
ate agenda.
But Alvarado said yesterday
those plans are on hold for the
time being, and that the COP's en
ergies will focus primarily on pre
venting approval of the plan be
fore the senate.
The COP will support Cohen's
plan because the members "want
to present a united front so as not
to split the vote," Alvarado said.
Cohen and three COP mem
bers met with a handful of stu
dents last night at Tresidder
Union to iron out the details of the
alternate plan. COP member Ani
etie Ekanem began the meeting by
saying it had been convened to
come up with a strategy for oppos
ing the conservative grading
model currently on the senate's
agenda.
The provisions now before the
senate, written and revised by the
Committee on Academic
Appraisal and Achievement, state
that courses may be added and
dropped until the end of the
fourth week and a "W" for "with
draw" will appear on the tran
script from the fifth to eighth
weeks. If a student has not with
drawn by the eighth week, a
grade will appear on the tran
script.
A notation of "NP" or "NC"

would be instituted to indicate
failure, and a student may retake
a class for a third time only if he
or she has received a failing grade
in the course. Students may
retake any class a second time,
but an asterisk would appear

next to the new grade to indicate
that it had been repeated. Most of
the changes would take effect
during the 1995-96 academic
year.
Ekanem outlined a COP com
pilation of student arguments
against the proposal before the
senate. The comments countered
claims that the new policy would
curb grade inflation, save
money, increase the value of a
Stanford transcript or teach
responsibility.
Cohen said the committee's
proposal punishes students for
having tried and ultimately
failed. "That is not the spirit we
want to encourage," Cohen said.
"Our main priority is to persuade
the Faculty Senate not to enact
what the C-AAA has proposed.
We feel there are bad points with
the plan."
Cohen's proposal extends the
drop deadline and deadline for
declaring the pass/no credit grad

ing option to the seventh week of
classes and would have a "W"
appear on the transcript if the
class is dropped after the seventh
week.
Under the Cohen proposal
there would be no mark to indi
cate failure. Instead, a "W" will
appear on the transcript to indi
cate either a dropped course or a
class where sufficient work had
not been completed to earn a let
ter grade.
Also, under the Cohen plan,
students may retake a course for
a third time even if they receive a
passing grade the first and second
times.
Ekanem attempted to rally
student support by recruiting vol
unteers to lobby individual mem
bers of the senate via e-mail and
by attending their office hours.
