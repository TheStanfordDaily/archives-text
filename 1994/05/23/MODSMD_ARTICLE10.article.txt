In the article "Taking a stab
at Shakespeare" in last week's
Intermission, Visiting Lecturer
Winter Mead was misquoted as
saying, "Shakespeare should

never be set in another time . . .
unless you're eliminating some
thing essential."
The last part of the quote
should have read, . . unless
you're illuminating something
essential."
