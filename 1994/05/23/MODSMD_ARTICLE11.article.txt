Korean subs missile-ready?
LONDON (AP) — North Korea has pur
chased Russian submarines that could be
adapted to fire ballistic missiles, the editor
of an influential military publication said in
an article published today in Britain.
North Korea, which has aroused inter
national concern over its suspected nuclear
arms program, says it bought 40 Russian
submarines for scrap.
But some of the new submarines could
be used to enhance the threat of North
Korea's navy, according to Richard Sharpe,
a former British Royal Navy captain.
He wrote in the foreword of Jane's
Fighting Ships, 1994-95, that some of the
submarines bought by North Korea were
Golf class submarines decommissioned
only four years ago.
"It is therefore possible that the missile
tubes may be adaptable for other

weapons," including ballistic missiles, the
editor wrote.
Israelis raid militants
JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli troops
using anti-tank missiles raided a hideout of
Islamic militants in the West Bank town of
Hebron yesterday, demolishing several
homes and killing at least one Palestinian,
radio reports and witnesses said.
Two other Palestinians were captured,
and troops searched the rubble for a fourth
suspect who was presumed dead, radio
reports said.
The army later confirmed that soldiers
killed a Palestinian fugitive identified as
Jihad Ibrahim Mohammed Asfour, 28,
who it said was active with the militant
Islamic Jihad. The radio report linked the
militants to the drive-by slaying of two
Israeli soldiers near Hebron last week.
