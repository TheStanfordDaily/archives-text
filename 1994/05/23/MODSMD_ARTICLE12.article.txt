# Stricter Haiti oil embargo flouted
## 
### 
MALPASSE, Haiti (AP) — Smugglers
made a mockery of a toughened U.N.
embargo on Haiti yesterday, shipping in
hundreds of gallons of gas and diesel oil
from the Dominican Republic. Armed
Haitian soldiers stood by and watched.
Eight hours after new world sanctions
took effect, boats loaded down with fuel
crossed Saumatre Lake from the Domini
can Republic to Haiti. Boats docked every
five minutes, with the four or five people
aboard unloading the fuel in five- and 10-
gallon jugs to black marketeers on the
Haitian side.
Haitian border guards and armed civil
ian auxiliaries, remnants of the brutal
Tonton Macoute private militia of the
Duvalier dictatorship, allowed the gas to
be loaded onto vehicles headed to the cap
ital, Port-au-Prince.
The armed men forced a carload of for
eign journalists in this border town to
leave after about a half-hour.

Haiti and the Dominican Republic
share the Caribbean island of Hispaniola,
and the embattled Dominican adminis
tration of Joaquin Balaguer has failed to
stop widespread embargo-busting along
the overland border.
In Port-au-Prince, cargo ships were still
being unloaded Saturday night hours before
the tougher embargo went into effect.
The embargo was imposed to force
Haiti's army to return power to the coun
try's first freely elected government,
ousted in a 1991 coup.
Gas that sells for $1.60 a gallon in the
Dominican Republic goes for $8 a gallon
in Port-au-Prince, with the Dominican
and Haitian militaries pocketing much of
the difference.
In the northern Dominican border
town of Dajabon, motorcyclists carrying
jugs of all sizes filled up with gas Satur
day — just hours ahead of the broadened
embargo — to smuggle across the border.

"Dominican and Haitian soldiers con
trol the flow on both sides of the border,"
said Ramon Ignacio Rodriguez, a local
trader there who depends on Haitian ped
dlers for his living. "Their officers are get
ting rich from it."
Vehicles get past checkpoints on the
road and riverside patrols by bribing low
ranking Dominican soldiers, whose pay is
about $64 a month, he said.
The Clinton administration and U.N.
officials had expressed hope that the
blind, 87-year-old Balaguer would honor
his pledges to maintain this toughened
embargo, which took effect at 11:59 p.m.
EDT Saturday. But the shipments yes
terday show that the Dominican govern
ment so far has not.
A worldwide oil embargo began last
October, after the military reneged on a
U.N. plan to restore democracy and place
elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide
back in power.
