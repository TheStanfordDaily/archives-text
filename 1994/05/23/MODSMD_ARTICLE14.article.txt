## Editorials COP: a new agenda 
### 
AS THE MAIN link between
the student body and Stan
ford administrators, the
Council of Presidents has a great
opportunity to effect constructive
change.
Although the previous COP —
whose term ended last Tuesday —
did a decent job with issues like
undergraduate education reform,
the new members need to be more
involved in areas that directly
affect the entire community. With
out such action, the institution of
the Council of Presidents could
lose whatever respect it has.
Before the end of the school
year, the new COP needs to identi
fy — and start working on — sev
eral major issues that will improve
student life at Stanford.
• Perennial dissatisfaction with
Dining Service points to one prob
lem that has traditionally been
neglected by student government.
Food service has been getting
more and more expensive as
options have been restricted.

Without a unified front to repre
sent students, this trend will con
tinue.
• The new COP also needs to
address problems with the special
fee system, which failed to catch
errors this year and has not
encouraged thrifty budgeting.
• Student representation on
University Committees — an
underused method of effecting
change at Stanford — could bene
fit from better supervision to
ensure representatives are doing
their jobs.
• Finally, two-way communica
tion with the community must be
improved. A quarterly newsletter
is not enough; next year, the COP
should look into more direct ways
of staying in touch, like a weekly
broadcast before Wednesday house
meetings on the student cable
channel.
Change, after all, is easier with
more support — and the COP
must work to improve the level of
support it has from students.
