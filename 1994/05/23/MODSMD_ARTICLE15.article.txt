# Flowing once more
## 
### 
Students walking by a
strange, curved metal figure
in the past couple of years
may have wondered what it is — a
bent paper clip, a half pretzel, a
strange, curving piece of metal
that seems to merely take up space
in front of Green Library?
Actually, that object is the Hoop,
and its return as a water-spewing
fountain is imminent.
Repairs to the Hoop — estimat
ed to cost between $20,000 and
$30,000 — began last week and
should be completed by Com
mencement.
Hopefully the renovations,
which include a newly designed
nozzle system, replacement of the
fountain's sand and gravel filters
and a new coat of paint, will be
completed before family members
of the Class of '94 arrive. Stan
ford's fountains help spice up the
appearance of the campus, and

every effort should be made to help
the Hoop spew its best water
stream possible.
Although it would be beneficial
for the improvements to the Hoop
to be completed by Commence
ment, the Hoop should continue to
flow during the school year, when
more students are on campus. It is
a fountain many people on campus
pass and an area where some like
to take a break when studying at
Green or Meyer.
The Hoop has not been opera
tional since 1990. At least half the
students on campus have never
seen the Hoop in all its wet glory. As
long as California's drought trou
bles are under control, the Univer
sity should keep the Hoop an active,
attractive campus feature.
Besides, graduating fountain
hoppers wouldn't complete their
trail without being able to make a
splash in the Hoop.
