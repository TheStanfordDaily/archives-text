## Graduation: don't look back 
### 
HOW MANY last chances have you
had? Who remembers when they
opened up the admissions files? I
never went to see why Dean Jean said I
was "splendid." I didn't want to find out I
was a statistic. I didn't want to spoil any
thing. I was doing tolerably well in my
classes, and I was drunk — nearly drown
ing — in the best years of my life. That
could've been the biggest buzzkill ever.
Not only did I never check the records,
but I never went overseas. I never slept
out for Viennese Ball tickets or for fiction
writing. I never got kissed under a full
moon in the Quad. I never went to the
Exotic Erotic. I never played Frisbee golf.
I never had my ass shaved. I never did
anything about those hundred or so
crushes I had. Hell, I never even saw Jen
nifer Connelly on campus.
I never insulted almost half of a fresh
men class with a speech at their convoca
tion. I never refused to open my backpack
for the government or the Larry "Bud"
Melman guy at Green. I never spent $400
on pillowcases — but then again, I also
never raised $1.1 billion for the Universi
ty. I never suspended the Band, or did I?
I never went on a hunger strike. I never
stormed the President's office. I never
got to drive the company Lexus. And I
definitely never poured paint on anything
in my life.
I never went to the Final Four — three
years in a row. I never won the NIT. I
never no-hit UCLA. I never kicked a field

goal to beat those bastards from UC-
Berkeley. I never set Kristin Klein for a
kill, but I got set up with her. I never
went to the hospital after a tennis match
I'd won. I have never known what it's like
to not win a swimming championship.
The Band has been involved three sepa
rate half-time fights — and Johannesen
never got to land a punch.
Then what the hell did I do exactly? I
guess it's over. The big check every three
months, the free tickets, the inflated
grades — they're going to disappear real
soon. Then what the hell will I do, exact
ly?
I suppose I should have an answer to
that question. Not having an answer is
not all that big a deal. I have set modest
goals that with a smidgen of hard work,
and truckloads of luck, can be easily
attained. What I don't want to do is
worry about all those "I nevers."
We shower everyday — hopefully. We
dress everyday — unfortunately. We also
make choices everyday. It took me a long
time to come up with all that stuff I never
did. I was sitting for even longer when I
challenged myself to come up with things
that I had done. I'm not a big believer of
selective recall, but the"I never" list is
bigger than the"I have" list. But I just
don't care.
I wrote for The Daily. I broadcast
Stanford games on KZSU. I had a hand in
selecting the last 20 Dollies and three
Trees. I changed my major once. On the

night of Oct. 17, 1989, I slept outside my
dorm with 15 other Brannerites wonder
ing if the next time we would be allowed
inside the building would be to collect our
valuables.
I saw Gorby in the Quad. I paid $12 to
play on the golf course. I lived in the Deke
house and loved it. I watched "Twin
Peaks" with the crowd as religiously as I
watch "90210" and "Melrose Place." I
can say "Hi" to Piper Hahn and she'd say
hello back. Guy Tucker, Joel Stein and
Pete Huyck are my friends — and my
idols.
Now I realize there is no reason to
worry about all those "I nevers" — I've
had quite a ride. If you start to think
about all the things you never did — even
for reasons as silly as insecurity — then
everything good gets tainted. The word of
course is regret. Whether you're just
going home for the summer, or for the
hot meals and low rent, don't regret any
thing.
On second thought, I have one regret.
There is one "I never" I'd like to change.
I never walked through with my class,
the Class of '93. However, in 20 days, I
get a reprieve.
After all, that's the ultimate "I have."
I have one last chance.

Jesse never wanted to stop writing
columns for The Daily. Good luck, guy.

course is regret. Whether you're just
going home for the summer, or for the
hot meals and low rent, don't regret any
thing.
On second thought, I have one regret.
There is one "I never" I'd like to change.
I never walked through with my class,
the Class of '93. However, in 20 days, I
get a reprieve.
After all, that's the ultimate "I have."
I have one last chance.

Jesse never wanted to stop writing
columns for The Daily. Good luck, guy.
