## Statue incident has adverse effect on entire community 
### 
WHEN I FIRST read the May 17
article in The Daily about the
vandalism of the "Gay Libera
tion" sculpture perpetrated by seven
Stanford students, I was immediately
hit by the key words "gay" and "ath
lete," then later, the word "fraternity."
Thus, the article seemed to connect
homophobia with athletes and fraterni
ty brothers. I tried to give the perpetra
tors the benefit of the doubt by attribut
ing their actions to alcohol and the irre
pressible urge to destroy public property
because "homophobia" is a very loaded
term.
I would like to think that this was an
isolated incident, that their being ath-

letes/fraternity members was purely
coincidental, and therefore the rest of
Stanford's varsity athletes and fraterni
ty brothers do not have to be burdened
with guilt by association. If what moti
vated them to deface the sculpture is
what they claim, then the police should
slap them with fines and punishment
tantamount to their utter lack of
respect for public monuments.
But the effect of their vandalism is to
raise the issue of homophobia and to
reinforce the stereotypes that people
have of athletes and fraternity boys as
gay bashers. The Daily is partly culpable
in portraying the story in such a man
ner. Those of us who immediately link

homophobia with athletes and fraterni
ties should think more carefully before
we judge. But since homophobia has
been raised as an issue, neither can we
ignore its existence. The evils of homo
phobia need not be discussed here, but
if the seven vandals acted even partly
out of hatred for gays, then I want to
offer them a different perspective.
I challenge them to look around and
examine their peers and the man in the
mirror before they pull another stunt
like this one again. When the "enemy"
might be among those closest to you,
you never know whom you will hurt by
shooting blindly at them.
Who are the victims of the vandal-

ism? Everyone. The seven perpetrators
need to apologize to the whole Stanford
community. Obviously, gays who look to
the monument for support and affirma
tion are affected. Athletic teams and
fraternities will suffer because their
image as a bastion for gay bashers will
be even more distorted. Ultimately,
Stanford is affected adversely by the
tainting of a valuable work of art. The
only good thing that has resulted from
this ugly incident is that it provokes us
to re-examine and re-direct our preju
dices and misconceptions before we
judge, hate and blame.
