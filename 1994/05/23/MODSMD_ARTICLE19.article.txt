# Dean of students says vandalism was wrong, summarizes response
## 
### 
I write to strongly condemn the van
dalism of the George Segal "Gay Libera
tion" sculpture. Such an act against an
important work of art is wholly unac
ceptable in a University that is commit
ted to artistic expression and which fully
supports and embraces all its members.
It is the responsibility of all members of
our community to speak out, both indi
vidually and collectively, to such egre
gious displays of intolerance.
The University has initiated a formal
individual review process by the Judicial
Affairs Office. Its purpose will be to
determine if the individuals involved
violated the Fundamental Standard,
which expects all students "to show both
within and without the University such
respect for order, morality, personal
honor and the rights of others as is
demanded by good citizens."
Second, in keeping with University
policy, the Greek Judicial Board will

review the case from the perspective of
the two fraternities whose members
were involved. The Judicial Board's role
will be to consider whether these actions
fall within collective chapter responsibil
ity for the actions of their members. If
collective responsibility is found, the
Board can recommend appropriate sanc
tions for the chapter(s) involved.
It is important to understand the sig
nificance of this work of art. The statue
was commissioned for the 10th anniver
sary of the 1969 Stonewall riots, which
marked the beginning of the modern
gay liberation movement. It represents
the struggle of lesbian, gay and bisexual
people throughout history, and it is an
important public art work for Stanford.
In addition, staff in the Office of Stu
dent Affairs is talking with the members
of the lesbian, gay, bisexual community,
the Athletics Department, the Interfra
ternity Council and others about ways
we can effectively address both the hurt
caused and the type of ignorance repre
sented by the vandalism of the statue.
Educational programs are already taking
place in the residences. I expect more
programs designed to provide greater
opportunities for discussion and learning

to take place next fall quarter. The goals
of these programs will be to help mem
bers of the community learn more about
diversity, to talk about the responsibility
each of us has to make our community
work well and to help faculty, staff, and
students feel safer and supported.
