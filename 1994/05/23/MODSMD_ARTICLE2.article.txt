# Policy revised; vote looms on Thursday
## 
### Andy Dworkin Senior staff writer 
The Faculty Senate is scheduled
to vote Thursday on a grading policy
that haa drawn kudos from many
professors and concern from many
students.
If approved as it now stands, the
policy would bring back a failing
grade, change the policy on retaking
classes and move up the deadline for
dropping and adding classes. The
bulk of the policy would go into effect
the academic year after next.
The policy was first presented to
the Faculty Senate on April 28. At
that meeting, many faculty members
praised the proposals and the com
mittee that created them. A few even
indicated that the proposed policy
was too liberal for their tastes,
and few raised fundamental ques
tions about the suggested
changes.
While the faculty senate
seemed to support the plan, how
ever, many students have been
troubled by the possible changes
in grading and deadlines. These
student concerns have led to sev
eral changes in the policy since it
was first presented to the senate.
Geology Prof. Gail Mahood,
who chairs the committee that
drafted the policy, said a number
of students have complained
about the policy — especially the
earlier drop/add deadline — both
in private communications to her
and at open meetings about the
proposal.
In addition, students have
drafted two different alternative
proposals that they hope to get

the senate to consider. Both stu
dent plans would have more
lenient drop/add deadlines than
the current proposal.
The proposal that the senate
will consider Thursday already
has a less strict drop/add deadline
than the original plan because of
student comment, Mahood said.
Initially the suggested drop/add
deadline was after three, not four,
weeks.
"It was quite clear from the
town meetings and the e-mail I
received that the main sticking
point (for students) is the drop
deadline," she said. "Students
seem to believe or feel that they're
going to drop a course after they
have determined how they're
going to do in it."
While that may sound "crass"
and many faculty do not find bad
grades a compelling reason to
drop a course, Mahood said some
students seem not to be able to
enjoy a class in which they are far
ing poorly.
In addition, Mahood said, in

some courses it may unfortunately
take four weeks until students can
figure out what the course is like
and what exactly will be covered.
So, Mahood said, her commit
tee pushed the deadline back a
week, although some committee
members opposed the shift.
The decision not to implement
most of the policy until the 1995-
96 academic year was also a
response to student concerns, she
said. One concern was that some
students had planned their class
schedules this year under the
assumption that the old grading
policy would stand.
The second student concern
was that next year's freshmen
had committed to attend Stanford
under the old grading policy.
While Mahood said she hopes the
grading policy was not a large con
cern for the members of the Class
of 1998, she said "it might have
been an issue."
The format of the retake policy
has also been changed slightly,
Mahood said. The first proposal

had different retake policies for
students who did and did not get
above a D+ the first time they
took the class. The current pro
posal treats all retakes the same.
So the revised grading proposal
that the senate will consider
Thursday stands as follows. The
guidelines would record an "NP"
grade (not passed) on a student's
transcript any time a student takes
a class for a letter grade and fails.
The plan also moves the dead
line for when students can drop
classes with no record of the drop
on their transcripts. Now a stu
dent can drop a class up to the
time of the final examination. The
proposal would move the drop
deadline to the end of the fourth
week of class.
Students will, under the plan,
be allowed to drop courses
between the end of the fourth and
eighth full weeks of classes, but a
"W" for withdrawal will appear on
their transcripts.
The deadline for adding classes
will be moved from week seven of

the quarter to week four, the
same time as the deadline for
dropping classes.
The proposal would move the
pass/no credit deadline from the
third to the end of the sixth week
of the quarter. Furthermore, stu
dents would have to arrange a
notation of "I" (incomplete) with
professors by the last day of class
and clear the incomplete within a
year. Incompletes not cleared
within a year would change auto
matically to NPs or NCs.
Finally, the policy would alter
the course retake system. Stu
dents would be allowed to retake
any course once, but must retake
the course for the same number of
units they selected the first time
they enrolled.
The first grade received in the
course would then be replaced on
the transcript by "RP" for
"repeated course," and the units
would be listed as zero. The sec
ond listing of the course on the
transcript would include the units
and the new grade, which would

have an asterisk next to it to show
that the course was taken twice.
Students could take a course a
third time only if they received an
NP or NC during their first retake
of the course. Currently students
can retake a course any number of
times and petition to have their
previous performances in that
course wiped from their records.
The new policy, if passed as is,
would go into effect at the start of
the 1995-96 academic year. The
retake policy, however, would
apply to courses starting fall quar
ter. In addition, students could
only petition to have incomplete
notations removed from their
transcripts if those marks were
obtained in classes taken this
school year or earlier.
This grading policy is the prod
uct of a year's worth of work by
the Academic Council's Commit
tee on Academic Appraisal and
Achievement. The project started
with surveys of faculty opinions
on grading conducted in March
and May of 1993.

has a less strict drop/add deadline
than the original plan because of
student comment, Mahood said.
Initially the suggested drop/add
deadline was after three, not four,
weeks.
"It was quite clear from the
town meetings and the e-mail I
received that the main sticking
point (for students) is the drop
deadline," she said. "Students
seem to believe or feel that they're
going to drop a course after they
have determined how they're
going to do in it."
While that may sound "crass"
and many faculty do not find bad
grades a compelling reason to
drop a course, Mahood said some
students seem not to be able to
enjoy a class in which they are far
ing poorly.
In addition, Mahood said, in

some courses it may unfortunately
take four weeks until students can
figure out what the course is like
and what exactly will be covered.
So, Mahood said, her commit
tee pushed the deadline back a
week, although some committee
members opposed the shift.
The decision not to implement
most of the policy until the 1995-
96 academic year was also a
response to student concerns, she
said. One concern was that some
students had planned their class
schedules this year under the
assumption that the old grading
policy would stand.
The second student concern
was that next year's freshmen
had committed to attend Stanford
under the old grading policy.
While Mahood said she hopes the
grading policy was not a large con
cern for the members of the Class
of 1998, she said "it might have
been an issue."
The format of the retake policy
has also been changed slightly,
Mahood said. The first proposal

had different retake policies for
students who did and did not get
above a D+ the first time they
took the class. The current pro
posal treats all retakes the same.
So the revised grading proposal
that the senate will consider
Thursday stands as follows. The
guidelines would record an "NP"
grade (not passed) on a student's
transcript any time a student takes
a class for a letter grade and fails.
The plan also moves the dead
line for when students can drop
classes with no record of the drop
on their transcripts. Now a stu
dent can drop a class up to the
time of the final examination. The
proposal would move the drop
deadline to the end of the fourth
week of class.
Students will, under the plan,
be allowed to drop courses
between the end of the fourth and
eighth full weeks of classes, but a
"W" for withdrawal will appear on
their transcripts.
The deadline for adding classes
will be moved from week seven of

the quarter to week four, the
same time as the deadline for
dropping classes.
The proposal would move the
pass/no credit deadline from the
third to the end of the sixth week
of the quarter. Furthermore, stu
dents would have to arrange a
notation of "I" (incomplete) with
professors by the last day of class
and clear the incomplete within a
year. Incompletes not cleared
within a year would change auto
matically to NPs or NCs.
Finally, the policy would alter
the course retake system. Stu
dents would be allowed to retake
any course once, but must retake
the course for the same number of
units they selected the first time
they enrolled.
The first grade received in the
course would then be replaced on
the transcript by "RP" for
"repeated course," and the units
would be listed as zero. The sec
ond listing of the course on the
transcript would include the units
and the new grade, which would

have an asterisk next to it to show
that the course was taken twice.
Students could take a course a
third time only if they received an
NP or NC during their first retake
of the course. Currently students
can retake a course any number of
times and petition to have their
previous performances in that
course wiped from their records.
The new policy, if passed as is,
would go into effect at the start of
the 1995-96 academic year. The
retake policy, however, would
apply to courses starting fall quar
ter. In addition, students could
only petition to have incomplete
notations removed from their
transcripts if those marks were
obtained in classes taken this
school year or earlier.
This grading policy is the prod
uct of a year's worth of work by
the Academic Council's Commit
tee on Academic Appraisal and
Achievement. The project started
with surveys of faculty opinions
on grading conducted in March
and May of 1993.
The Faculty Senate is scheduled
to vote Thursday on a grading policy
that haa drawn kudos from many
professors and concern from many
students.
If approved as it now stands, the
policy would bring back a failing
grade, change the policy on retaking
classes and move up the deadline for
dropping and adding classes. The
bulk of the policy would go into effect
the academic year after next.
The policy was first presented to
the Faculty Senate on April 28. At
that meeting, many faculty members
praised the proposals and the com
mittee that created them. A few even
indicated that the proposed policy
was too liberal for their tastes,
and few raised fundamental ques
tions about the suggested
changes.
While the faculty senate
seemed to support the plan, how
ever, many students have been
troubled by the possible changes
in grading and deadlines. These
student concerns have led to sev
eral changes in the policy since it
was first presented to the senate.
Geology Prof. Gail Mahood,
who chairs the committee that
drafted the policy, said a number
of students have complained
about the policy — especially the
earlier drop/add deadline — both
in private communications to her
and at open meetings about the
proposal.
In addition, students have
drafted two different alternative
proposals that they hope to get

the senate to consider. Both stu
dent plans would have more
lenient drop/add deadlines than
the current proposal.
The proposal that the senate
will consider Thursday already
has a less strict drop/add deadline
than the original plan because of
student comment, Mahood said.

deadline was after three, not four,
