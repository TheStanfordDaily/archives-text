# Head wrestling coach explains remarks and condemns vandalism
## 
### 
I am sorry if my quotes in the May 18
issue of the San Jose Mercury News
gave the impression that I condoned the
vandalism of the "Gay Liberation" sculp
ture. I do not condone these activities
nor do I condone getting drunk.
This behavior is not representative of
the Stanford wrestling program. I will
comply fully with the University's judi
cial process.
Chris Horpel
Head coach, wrestling
