# Weekend wins advance men to NCAA semis
## Downing Fresno St., Duke, tennis moves on to UCLA 
### Mike Langford Senior staff writer 
SOUTH BEND, Ind. — In matches of increasing diffi
culty and importance, the Stanford men's tennis team
scored two quick wins over the weekend to advance to the
semifinals of the NCAA Men's Tennis Championships.
And Stanford (24-2) also increased its level of play on
the way to the Final Four of college tennis. Stanford's
beating of Fresno State (20-8) by a 4-2 score in Saturday's
first round featured a Cardinal squad that was superior in
talent, yet one that struggled at times.
These troubles were not evident on Sunday, however.
Facing the Duke Blue Devils (21-6), who had defeated
Texas A&M, on Saturday, Stanford played like a team pos
sessed, downing the Blue Devils 4-0.
"We really came out focused," said senior Michael
Flanagan. "For probably the first time all year, we took the
talent that we have and used it."
Stanford came out on fire in doubles. In a slight adjust
ment of doubles teams, third doubles saw freshman Grant
Elliott paired up with senior Vimal Patel — and the move
paid off against Duke.
In what Elliott termed "my best doubles match of the
year," the duo beat Duke's Jordan Murray and Philippe
Moggio by a lopsided 8-1 score. With that win, Stanford
needed just one more doubles victory to get the first point
of the match — but it wouldn't come that easily.
Both of the other Blue Devils were down a break, 4-5.
While the second doubles team of Jeff Salzenstein and
Robert Devens eventually lost 6-8, the first team of Flana
gan and Chris Cocotos came back and broke their oppo
nents once again to take the set 8-6 — and doubles point.
"We had a gut feeling that it was time to change the
doubles teams," said head coach Dick Gould. "But the
same thing could have happened the other way around."
Stanford's intensity only increased in singles. In five of
the six matches, Stanford took the first set. Devens was
the first off the court with a material 6-1, 6-2 win over
Adam Gusky in the No. 4 match. Next, Cocotos, playing in
the No. 3 spot, finished off No. 88-ranked Peter Ayers 6-1,
6-3. Finally, Salzenstein at No. 2 singles defeated a demor
alized No. 41-ranked Rob Chess 6-1, 7-5.
"There is no team in the tournament I have more
respect for than Duke," Gould said. "I was astounded at
the first-set scores. There weren't any momentum shifts

— the guys kept the pressure up."
"We came out mentally prepared for a top-five team,"
Salzenstein said. "We knew what we had to do and took
care of business."
"You can't wait around for the other guy to lose," Gould
said, and then added after motioning to the football field,
"it happened here in a football game a couple of years ago,
if I remember right (when Stanford defeated Notre Dame
in 1992)."
When Salzenstein clinched the win all other play ceased.
However, Flanagan was beating No. 6-ranked Chris Press
ley 6-2, 3-3. Sophomore Jim Thomas was also in the lead

at fifth singles. Sixth singles was played by sophomore
Ricky Becker, who was near defeat when play stopped. But
it was far too little far too late.
"We really thought we had a realistic chance coming in,
but obviously we were never in it," said Duke head coach
Jay Lapidus. "Those teams from the West Coast, they win
so much they come in almost expecting to win."
Against Fresno State on Saturday, Stanford also
secured the doubles point with first and third doubles scor
ing powerful 8-3 wins. But it would take Stanford some
