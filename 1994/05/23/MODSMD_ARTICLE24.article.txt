# Poruri eliminated in NCAA semifinals
## 
### Rob Ross Senior staff writer 
After 84 dual-match wins and four All-Amer
ican awards, Laxmi Poruri's Stanford tennis
career is over. The senior captain lost to
UCLA's Keri Phebus in the semifinals of the
NCAA Women's Tennis Championships, there
by ending one of the most successful tenures in
Cardinal women's tennis history.
At the Magill Tennis Complex in Athens,
Ga., Poruri defeated the second and third-seed
ed players in the team competition, thus estab

lishing herself as the No. 1 seed and the clear
favorite in the 64-member singles champi
onships held last Wednesday through Saturday.
But, after winning four straight matches to
reach the semifinals, Stanford's senior captain
lost to the unseeded Phebus, ending her bid to
become the first Stanford singles champion
since Sandra Birch nabbed the title in 1991.
"I thought I played really well," Poruri said.
"But I lacked intensity on a few points and it
cost me the match."
Poruri lost 6-3 in the first set to conference
rival Phebus, who is ranked No. 12 nationally.

But the senior came back with a vengeance
against the sophomore Bruin, ripping off a 6-1
second-set win. In a tightly fought third set,
Phebus ran out to a 4-0 lead, then Poruri won
the next three games to pull within 6-3. But the
Bruin broke Poruri in the next game then held
serve to win 6-3 and record her first victory
against Poruri in three tries this season.
Poruri's last shot was a volley into the net.
"She was more psyched for this one," Poruri
said of her opponent. "I would describe her play
as a counterpuncher... this is the
best she has played against me
this year." Poruri ended her final
Stanford season with a 29-4 over
all record.
Phebus became only the second
unseeded player to reach the
finals of this tournament as she
faced hometown favorite Angela
Lettiere of Georgia. Lettiere,
whom Poruri had overcome in the
finals of the team tournament
four days earlier, knocked off Phe
bus in straight sets 7-6 (7-4), 6-2.

By virtue of this victory the senior
became the Lady Bulldogs' second
NCAA Singles Champion (after
Lisa Spain) and gains a wild-card
entry into the main draw of the
U.S. Open.
"It's a chance to get started and
see what I can do," Lettiere said.
Poruri's route to the semifinals
involved the downings of several
top-ranked players. In the first
round she beat Divya Merchant of
Florida 6-3, 6-2 and blew by
Texas' Jackie Moe 6-2, 6-0 on the
same day.
Thursday Poruri added another
couple of wins, slipping by Kansas'
Mindy Weiner 4-6, 6-4, 6-3 and
destroying fifth-seeded Vera Vitels

of California 6-2, 6-3. Despite her
successes, ultimately the Cardi
nal's run was cut short by Phebus,
whom she met on Friday.
Including singles and doubles,
Poruri played 11 matches during
her eight-day campaign in the
NCAA Women's Tennis Champi
onship. On Monday she needed to
be hospitalized after her victory
over Longhorn Lucy Ludvigova,
as she suffered from heat exhaus
tion. As Poruri mentioned after
her wins Thursday, fatigue played
a role in her performance.
"In this tournament, it is not
necessarily the best player who
wins, but the one who is able to
grind it out," she said.
