# Modest Johnson a top-notch sailor
## All-American leads as top crew 
### Jeremy Stone Staff writer 
For two consecutive years, Britt
Johnson has been the top crew on
the nationally-ranked Stanford
sailing team. Don't expect her to
shout it from the rooftops, howev
er.
"Are you sure you don't want to
do a feature on someone else?" she
asked politely.
Behind her modest front, John
son's achievements tell quite a dif
ferent story. The Murrells Inlet,
S.C., native ranks as the top crew
for both the women's and coed
teams this year, and was also
named an All-American crew for
her efforts last season.
After a freak accident in practice
sidelined teammate Katherine
Chen in the winter, Johnson
stepped in at the top position. In
April, Johnson helped the Cardinal
to victories in the women's Pacific
Coast Championships and to
berths in the women's coed Team
Racing and coed Dinghy National
Championships.
A fifth-year student coterming
in history, Johnson began her for
mal training with the Stanford sail
ing team during her sophomore
year. I ler first introduction to sail
ing, and to the water, came much
earlier, however.
"That's how I learned to swim,"
Johnson said. "When I was two, my
dad threw me off our sailboat."
After growing up in and around
sailboats, Johnson didn't sail that
much in high school. She joined
Stanford's team in her sophomore
year because she wanted to get
back into it."And I definitely got
back into it," she added with a
laugh.
She earned All-America honors
last year serving as crew for Scott
Sellers on Stanford's number-one
duo. This year, she took some time
off from sailing in the fall. "I actu
ally wasn't that committed to the
team," she said. "I just basically
subbed when they needed people."
She said that coterming took her
away from the team at the begin
ning of this season. "I was tiying to
be a student," she said. "I got

sucked back in."
While it might have taken a
nudge to get Johnson back in the
boat, she wasted little time picking
up where she had left off. She
immediately was reunited with her
skipper from last year, team cap
tain Sellers. On the all-women's
side, she rejoined sophomore
Gretchen Uznis, her partner last
year, and a slew of other skippers as
well.
"We're jumping around a lot
more this year than in previous
years," she said. "You learn a lot by
dealing with lots of different peo
ple. You learn to be more adaptable
to different styles."
While the skippers Johnson sails
with work with styles of their own,
the team as a whole has also taken
on a new tone this year under first
year coach Steve Bourdow. Accord
ing to Johnson (and the standings)
his influence has contributed a
mqjor boost to the team.
"This year I think our goals
have been clearer, we're definitely a
more focused team," Johnson said.
"I think we've worked harder, and
that's partially why we've done bet
ter this year than we have any
other year. Steve has enforced
physical training and things we had
never done before.
"The team's still a social outlet,
but we've just become a little more
serious this year," she said.
Johnson also credits the current
squad's unity as a mqjor asset. "It's
really unusual, because college is
pretty much the only place where
sailing is a team sport," she said.
"You figure that most of the people
have grown up with sailing as an
individual sport, just out for them
selves. I think it's hard when some
people come in as freshmen and
realize that the good of the team is
what's at stake."
Johnson certainly qualifies as
someone who has grown up with
sailing. She lived in Connecticut
until age 11, where her father
remains active in sailing.
"At age 7, you're allowed to start
taking sailing lessons at our yacht
club, and then every summer
