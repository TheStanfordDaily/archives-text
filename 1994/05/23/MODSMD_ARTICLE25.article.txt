# Modest Johnson a top-notch sailor
## All-American leads as top crew 
### Jeremy Stone Staff writer 
For two consecutive years, Britt
Johnson has been the top crew on
the nationally-ranked Stanford
sailing team. Don't expect her to
shout it from the rooftops, howev
er.
"Are you sure you don't want to
do a feature on someone else?" she
asked politely.
Behind her modest front, John
son's achievements tell quite a dif
ferent story. The Murrells Inlet,
S.C., native ranks as the top crew
for both the women's and coed
teams this year, and was also
named an All-American crew for
her efforts last season.
After a freak accident in practice
sidelined teammate Katherine
Chen in the winter, Johnson
stepped in at the top position. In
April, Johnson helped the Cardinal
to victories in the women's Pacific
Coast Championships and to
berths in the women's coed Team
Racing and coed Dinghy National
Championships.
A fifth-year student coterming
in history, Johnson began her for
mal training with the Stanford sail
ing team during her sophomore
year. I ler first introduction to sail
ing, and to the water, came much
earlier, however.
"That's how I learned to swim,"
Johnson said. "When I was two, my
dad threw me off our sailboat."
After growing up in and around
sailboats, Johnson didn't sail that
much in high school. She joined
Stanford's team in her sophomore
year because she wanted to get
back into it."And I definitely got
back into it," she added with a
laugh.
She earned All-America honors
last year serving as crew for Scott
Sellers on Stanford's number-one
duo. This year, she took some time
off from sailing in the fall. "I actu
ally wasn't that committed to the
team," she said. "I just basically
subbed when they needed people."
She said that coterming took her
away from the team at the begin
ning of this season. "I was tiying to
be a student," she said. "I got

sucked back in."
While it might have taken a
nudge to get Johnson back in the
boat, she wasted little time picking
up where she had left off. She
immediately was reunited with her
skipper from last year, team cap
tain Sellers. On the all-women's
side, she rejoined sophomore
Gretchen Uznis, her partner last
year, and a slew of other skippers as
well.
"We're jumping around a lot
more this year than in previous
years," she said. "You learn a lot by
dealing with lots of different peo
ple. You learn to be more adaptable
to different styles."
While the skippers Johnson sails
with work with styles of their own,
the team as a whole has also taken
on a new tone this year under first
year coach Steve Bourdow. Accord
ing to Johnson (and the standings)
his influence has contributed a
mqjor boost to the team.
"This year I think our goals
have been clearer, we're definitely a
more focused team," Johnson said.
"I think we've worked harder, and
that's partially why we've done bet
ter this year than we have any
other year. Steve has enforced
physical training and things we had
never done before.
"The team's still a social outlet,
but we've just become a little more
serious this year," she said.
Johnson also credits the current
squad's unity as a mqjor asset. "It's
really unusual, because college is
pretty much the only place where
sailing is a team sport," she said.
"You figure that most of the people
have grown up with sailing as an
individual sport, just out for them
selves. I think it's hard when some
people come in as freshmen and
realize that the good of the team is
what's at stake."
Johnson certainly qualifies as
someone who has grown up with
sailing. She lived in Connecticut
until age 11, where her father
remains active in sailing.
"At age 7, you're allowed to start
taking sailing lessons at our yacht
club, and then every summer

you're at the yacht club, all day, all
summer, and on weekends, you'd
go to regattas," she said.
The nationals will serve as a
homecoming of sorts for Johnson,
as the women's race will be hosted
by Yale while the Coast Guard
Academy will host the team and
coed dinghy races.
In the women's regatta, Johnson
expects to sail with freshman Alice
Manard. Clearly the class of the
Pacific Coast Championships last
month, the Cardinal women won by
a commanding 51-point margin.
Entering the nationals No. 3 in the
polls, the Cardinal women hold
lofty aspirations.
"Our women should either prob

ably win nationals or at least get top
three," Johnson predicted.
True to her selfless nature,
Johnson prefers team racing, the
second of the three national cham
pionship races.
"It's so much more mentally
challenging," she explained. "It's
still as physically challenging as
fleet racing, but you're worried
about not how you're doing but
how your other two boats are
doing."
Johnson said the Cardinal will
make an impact at the team racing
nationals. "We have a deep team
with a lot of resources," she said.
"Meanwhile, there are a lot of
teams that we'll be competing
against that will only have two pairs
of people that are really strong."
Stanford will need this depth of
talent in the third event, the coed

Dinghy National Championships.
The Cardinal will sail in the race for
its first time in six years.
Stanford will face the challenge
of the new of the race on top of the
additional stresses of finals week
while the competing universities
will have completed their academic
year by that first weekend of June.
Johnson pointed out that different
boats will also be used.
"One challenging thing about
nationals this year is that parts of it
are going to be in 4205, which are
boats that we only get to sail when
we're actually on the coast. We'll
have to be adapting to the different
boats," she said. "That will be a
challenge, but hopefully it won't
hurt us at all. We've sailed enough
in them to where we can definitely
compete on everyone else's level."
Hoping to do more than just

compete, Stanford is looking to
improve its No. 6 standing in the
polls, especially after placing fifth in
dinghies and third overall in the
Thompson Trophy Intersectional
at the same site last month.
"Our goal is definitely to finish
top five, and hopefully prove our
selves a little bit better than what
we have so far," she said. "Hopeful
ly, we'll just peak."
Johnson plans to stay in the Bay
Area next year and hopes to teach
U.S. history. She'll continue to sail
from time to time, and she and Sell
ers have already spent some week
ends sailing with graduates.
Characteristically, one thing she
won't do is let the whole world
know she starred as a collegiate
sailor at Stanford. "I don't neces
sarily put my face forward," she
said.
