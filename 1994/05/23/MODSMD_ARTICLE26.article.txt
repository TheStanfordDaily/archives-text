Despite the double win by
powerhouse UCLA, which cap
tured both the men's and
women's Pacific 10 Conference
crowns this weekend, the Cardi
nal squad pieced things together
to come up with a strong and
much-improved finish for this
season.
While UCLA men's team
wrapped up the weekend with
135 points, the Cardinal fin
ished a respectable fifth at 51.5
points, a hefty boost over last
season's last-place finish at 26
points.
On the women's side, the
Cardinal came in seventh, one
place ahead of last year's mark,
with a total of 42 points to near
ly double last year's score of 23
points. The Bruin women fin
ished with 127 points.
"The success the team
enjoyed during the Pac-10
Championships represents hard
work in all phases," said head
coach Vin Lananna.
After the win by junior Travis
Clark in the Pac-10 decathlon

championships the previous
weekend, the men's squad kept
the ball rolling. According to
men's captain Dave Popejoy, one
difference from Pac-10 champi
onships of past years was the
feeling of legitimacy as a team,
not just as individuals.
"The meet was fun because
we felt like we were actually
competing as a team," Popejoy
said. "I thought the team's per
formance was outstanding since
we doubled our points from last
year."
As one of the main factors
contributing to this competitive
ness, the junior turned in a red
ribbon landing of the hammer at
a career-best mark of 229 feet
and 2 inches. Popejoy's throw
was recorded in the Pac-10
books as the eighth all-time best
in the conference and also a cur
rent fifth-best collegiate throw
in the nation this year.
"I was really happy with how
well I threw," he said. "I felt like
I really got over the hump as far
as my improvement, but I know
that there's still a lot left to work
99
on.
While Popejoy was setting
strong marks for the throwers,
sophomore Rob Reeder provided a
matching performance on the track
with back-to-back distance placing.
He double-scored for the Cardinal
with a third in the 10,000 meters at
31:03.38 followed by a fourth in the
5,000 meters with a career-best
time of 14:32.24.
"The 5K was really slow so I just
focused on placing on that race
while the 10K I was really pleased
with the fast pace which led me to a
[personal record]," Reeder said.
Reeder wasn't only pleased with his
own performance but with the
team's as well.
"Many predicted us to be last
again this year but we proved them
wrong," he said. "After a disap
pointing Big Meet, much intensity
had been lost but we just hung in
there and tried our best â€” that was
illustrated at the scoreboard at the
end of the weekend."
Another Cardinal sophomore
who surprised many people in the
conference this weekend was triple
jumper Jami Webb, who leapt for a
career-best and a NCAA-provision

al qualifying mark of 51 feet, good
for second place.
"Everything came together
today," he said. "I know it was a
good jump but I had no idea I had
jumped 51 feet."
Sophomore Rene Rodriguez
rounded out the men's showings by
capturing third in the 400 meters
with a clocking of 46.52 seconds.
On the women's side, the dis
tance squad contributed the major
ity of the Cardinal's points, much
due to the efforts of senior Louise
Watson. In her first time running
the 10,000 meters, Watson cap
tured the conference crown in that
event with a time of 34:44.72, a
NCAA provisional qualifying mark.
"I was lapping at favorable times
and feeling very comfortable until
the last mile," she said. "However, I
maintained my concentration and
continued forward to hang in
there." Watson also finished third
in the 5,000 meters clocking a
16:53.43.
Another solid distance perfor
mance came from junior co-captain
Sarah Truitt, who finished behind
Watson in the 5,000 meters with a
17:20.69 mark.
"I never scored for the team in a
conference meet, so I was really
excited and happy to score this year
since that was my main goal coming
in," Truitt said.

Truitt was also pleased with the
Cardinal's overall performance as
she foresees a team which can make
a strong impact in the future.
"Everyone did a great job even
though the score wasn't that high
but that showed us that we are
twice as good," Truitt said of the
Cardinal women's doubling of last
year's score.
As the distance team placed in
eveiy event from the 800 meters to
the 10,000 meters, senior co-cap
tain Jen McCormick let her javelin
fly for a career-best of 179' 5" and
the Pac-10 title.
"I felt a little pressure going into
the finals after throwing 155 feet in
the prelims," McCormick said.
Despite the harsh, wet condi
tions, McCormick still came
through with the clutch throw. "I
didn't think I threw it that far, but
when they announced 179' 5" I was
extremely happy," she said.
To place a cap on an already solid
day for the women's squad, the
1,600-meter relay team (Jackie
Bridgeman, Christy Boyd, Dena
Dey and Tyra Holt) finished sev
enth with a time of 3:44.06, break
ing a school record in the process.
"The women's team performed
remarkably well," Lananna said.
"They left a clear calling card for
the future with this weekend's
showing."
