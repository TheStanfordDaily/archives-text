Despite the double win by
powerhouse UCLA, which cap
tured both the men's and
women's Pacific 10 Conference
crowns this weekend, the Cardi
nal squad pieced things together
to come up with a strong and
much-improved finish for this
season.
While UCLA men's team
wrapped up the weekend with
135 points, the Cardinal fin
ished a respectable fifth at 51.5
points, a hefty boost over last
season's last-place finish at 26
points.
On the women's side, the
Cardinal came in seventh, one
place ahead of last year's mark,
with a total of 42 points to near
ly double last year's score of 23
points. The Bruin women fin
ished with 127 points.
"The success the team
enjoyed during the Pac-10
Championships represents hard
work in all phases," said head
coach Vin Lananna.
After the win by junior Travis
Clark in the Pac-10 decathlon

championships the previous
weekend, the men's squad kept
the ball rolling. According to
men's captain Dave Popejoy, one
difference from Pac-10 champi
onships of past years was the
feeling of legitimacy as a team,
not just as individuals.
"The meet was fun because
we felt like we were actually
competing as a team," Popejoy
said. "I thought the team's per
formance was outstanding since
we doubled our points from last
year."
As one of the main factors
contributing to this competitive
ness, the junior turned in a red
ribbon landing of the hammer at
a career-best mark of 229 feet
and 2 inches. Popejoy's throw
was recorded in the Pac-10
books as the eighth all-time best
in the conference and also a cur
rent fifth-best collegiate throw
in the nation this year.
"I was really happy with how
well I threw," he said. "I felt like
I really got over the hump as far
as my improvement, but I know
that there's still a lot left to work
