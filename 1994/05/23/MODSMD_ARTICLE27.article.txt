# Golf fifth in regionals
## Team earns NCAA berth after slow start 
### Andrew Blachman Staff writer 
It wasn't pretty, but it was
good enough to advance the Stan
ford men's golf team to the NCAA
finals.
Behind strong performances
from juniors William Yanigisawa
and Casey Martin, the fourth
ranked Cardinal overcame an
unusually mediocre first round to
finish fifth at the NCAA West
Regionals in Tucson, Ariz. Thurs
day through Saturday. The top
nine teams from the tournament
qualified for the NCAA Champi
onships in Dallas, Texas, June 1-
4.
"We didn't play really well, but
we qualified for nationals," senior
Brad Lanning said. "That was our
goal going in and we accom
plished it. In the long run, [our
performancel is not going to hurt
our chances at all."
The Cardinal, who owns the
nation's second-lowest team
stroke average, was the favorite
to win the West Regional. A dis
appointing five-over-par first
round, however, left Stanford in a
three-way tie for ninth place.

"We were never worried," said
Yanigisawa, a junior who trans
ferred last year from UC-Irvine.
"The field was really tough and
we knew that if we stayed focused
we'd qualify [for the finals]."
Stanford did remain focused,
bouncing back in the second
round by firing a team total of
285 — three strokes under par —
to move up to fourth place. The
Cardinal golfers then held on in
the third and final round to put
them in the position they have
been longing for.
"Our goal all year has been to
win the national championship,"
said Lanning. "Now that the
nationals are all we have left we
can really start zeroing in on that
goal."
Yanigisawa finished in eighth
place overall with a three-under
par score of 213 to lead all Stan
ford scorers. Martin came in one
stroke back at 214 after three
rounds on the par-72, 7,087-yard
Tucson National Golf Course.
UNLV senior Edward Fryatt
came from five strokes back on
the final day to surpass Fresno
State junior Joe Acosta and capture
the individual title. Fryatt led the
Rebels to the team title as well, as
the Big West Conference champi
ons blew away the West Regional
field. After posting a nine-under
par first round, UNLV cruised
ahead to finish 15 strokes better
than any other school.
"This is great," said UNLV head
coach Dwaine Knight. "But Dallas
is our objective. We want to get
ready for that and this win helps in
our preparation."
Arizona State, Fresno State and
tournament host Arizona placed

ahead of the Cardinal as well. UC-
Santa Barbara, San Jose State,
Oregon State and New Mexico also
qualified for the NCAA Finals. In
jail, four teams will represent the
Pac-10 in Dallas.
The tournament proved the bet
ter teams in collegiate golf are virtu
ally indistinguishable. Less than
two weeks ago, Stanford claimed
the Pac-10 Championships on the
Tucson National Golf Course. This
weekend, on the same course, the
Cardinal finished behind conference
foes Arizona State and Arizona.
"On this level of collegiate golf
there's no [visible] difference
between the good teams," said
Goodwin. "What matters most is
mental stamina and desire."
The order of finish in the region

als will have no bearing on the
finals, according to Goodwin. "The
top nine teams in the West qualify
and then they just start all over
again," he said.
Those nine teams will meet 10
from the Midwest and 11 more
from the East in the finals, held just
outside of Dallas at the Stoneridge
Country Club in McKinley, Texas.
The course is known for its windy
conditions and the Cardinal, who
will practice this week on windy
courses by the Bay, should be pre
pared.
"This time of year is gut-check
time," said Yanigisawa. "All we're
doing right now is getting ready for
Dallas."
So, too, is the rest of the colle
giate golf world.
