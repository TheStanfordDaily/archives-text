# Damage to statue could exceed $8K
## Felony charges likely to be filed today

Damage to the recently vandalized "Gay Lib
eration" statue will cost between $7,900 and
$8,900 to repair, a price tag which may lead to
felony charges today against the seven athletes
arrested for the crime.
Although California state law allows authori
ties to bring felony vandalism charges in cases
where damages exceed $5,000, Santa Clara
County Deputy District Attorney Karyn Sinunu
said she is still waiting for more information be
fore making her decision.
Sinunu said she wants to see a breakdown of
the repair estimate in order to determine how
much of the costs arise from the actual damage
and how much from shipping costs.
She also hopes to differentiate between dam
age caused by the blows from the bench as op
posed to the black acrylic paint splattered onto
the white figures. Police are meeting for the third
time with Sinunu today.

The repair evaluation was completed Friday,
according to Stanford Museum Director Tom
Seligman. The statue must be removed for sever
al weeks to be repaired, he said.
The bronze sculpture's current market value
has been estimated at $400,000 by artist George
Segal, who created the controversial piece.
Stanford Judicial Affairs Officer Sally Cole
said she has talked to all seven students implicat
ed in the incident, and is continuing her investi
gation to determine whether the Fundamental
Standard was violated when the sculpture was
damaged last Monday.
In a vast outpouring of public dismay, many
have called for the University to take strong ac
tion against the seven students. Cole said she
hopes to publicize the charges being brought
against the athletes if she can do so without com
ing into conflict with the University's Judicial
Charter.
The charter dictates that facts which identify
students be kept private. But this mandate can

conflict with the University's
interests in letting the communi
ty know what actions are taken
against the students.
"I have to fmd a line to walk
and I'm not sure where it's going
to be at this moment," Cole said.
In the past, the "Gay Libera
tion" sculpture has been removed
immediately after being marred
by vandals. The four-figured
sculpture was hit more than 40
times with a ball-peen hammer in
March, 1984, and had the word
"AIDS" spray-painted on its sur
face in August, 1987.
But officials are taking a differ
ent approach in the most recent
case of vandalism. To educate the
larger campus community, the stat
ue will not be removed for another
five or six weeks, Seligman said.
Teach-ins and other education
al events addressing the incident
are currently being planned in
conjunction with the Art Muse
um, the Dean of Students Office
and members of the lesbian, gay

and bisexual community, accord
ing to Troy Gilbert, University
adviser to the Lesbian, Gay, and
Bisexual Community Center.
"I think this is a wonderful
educational opportunity for all of
us to learn more about the Segal
sculpture and what it means," he
said. "I hope people walk by the
statue and think about what it
means to them."
Members of the gay and lesbian

community feel a strong attach
ment to the sculpture and theme
represented by the artwork, which
represents two gay couples.
"A lot of people have failed to
make the connection between the
sculpture and the community,"
sophomore David Barba said. "I
don't think they understand why

[the incident! makes us feel less
safe.
"If they do something to a sym
bol that represents us, what does
that say about safety on campus?"
he asked.
After the 1984 incident, mem
bers of the lesbian and gay com
munity placed flowers at the loca
tion of the removed artwork.
Flowers also returned to the site
of the sculpture on Friday and
over the weekend, along with a
sign reading "Hate Crime."
Baseball players Dusty Allen,
Robert Gardner, Todd Laßocca
and Brendan Sullivan, football
team members Mark Butterfield
and Jason White, and wrestler
Thomas Irwin were arrested and
later released for the alleged
crime last week.
Gardner, Butterfield and
White also were also cited for
resisting arrest for allegedly run
ning from police.
A meeting is being held at 5 p.m.
today in the LGBCC to discuss the
incident. Dean of Students Michael
Jackson and Assoc. Athletics Direc
tor Tom Beckett are expected to
attend, along with representatives
from the Judicial Affairs Office.
