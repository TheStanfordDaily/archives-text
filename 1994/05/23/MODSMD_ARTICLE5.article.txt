# 'No Grapes' decal target of vandals
## Burciaga car egged 
### Romesh Ratnesar Editorial staff 
A raw egg was broken on the
rear windshield of the car of Casa
Zapata Resident Fellow Tony
Burciaga late Friday night, ap
parently aimed at a bumper stick
er on the inside of the glass that
read "No Grapes."
Burciaga called Stanford police
to the scene shortly after discov
ering the vandalism at about 9
a.m. Saturday. Police investigat
ed the incident, but would not re
lease any details on whether they
had discovered the perpetrators
or the motive of the egging.
The gray Dodge Caravan was
parked in a space in the Stern
parking lot marked for the Casa
Zapata resident fellow, Burciaga
said. Portions of the egg were
also found on the sign denoting
the reserved space, Burciaga
said, adding that he suspects the
act was deliberately aimed at
him.
Burciaga cleaned the egg
residue from the windshield later
in the day. He said a small spot re
mains over the "No Grapes"
sticker, which is stuck to the in
side of the windshield to prevent
removal.
The embattled Burciaga, who
was recently charged by The
Stanford Review with impeding
free speech for allegedly preventing
door-to-door distribution of the
paper in his dormitory, said that
the egging has brought him to "the
end of my patience."
Earlier this year, Burciaga's
wife, associate vice provost for Stu
dent Affairs Cecilia Burciaga, was
notified that her position had been
eliminated, effective in August.
The administration turned down
the Burciagas' offer to remain as
resident fellows at Zapata for an
additional year.
"I wish I could leave right now,"
he said Saturday. This weekend's
incident was the third time a car
owned by the Burciagas has been
egged at Stanford, Burciaga said.
"It's almost unbelievable that
there could be so much bigotry
here," he said. "It is sad, painful
and embarrassing to be associated
with this University. It seems that
a lot of the work that has been done
has rolled down the hill."
"It's just a sad way to go," said
Burciaga, who does not expect that
those responsible for the recent
attack will be caught. "Twenty
years and you get driven out like
this."
