# Engineers, in a shift, enjoy day in sun

Taking a break from project-planning and
number-crunching, graduate students in engi
neering spent Saturday afternoon welcoming
new admits and mixing with faculty and alum
ni, part of the field's shift in focus from purely
technical training to education with a social

emphasis.
In an effort to show the importance of person
al interaction in the areas of industrial engineer
ing and engineering management, the Stanford
Technology Management Society (STEMS)
hosted its second annual "Spring Fling," attend
ed by 85 people at Bowman Alumni House.
Stressing the human aspect of an engineering
education, Thomas Kosnik, a consulting profes

sor in industrial engineering, welcomed this
fall's incoming graduate students.
"What you learn here," he said, "is much less
important than who you learn it from."
Gary Frank, a student in engineering man
agement and co-president of STEMS, said that
the event was "a good chance for students, facul-
ty, alumni, administrators and new
admits to hang out and have a
relaxing time."
The event featured entertainers
such as a fire juggler, balloon artist,
and a music and dance show by a
Polynesian band. Throughout the
reception and luncheon, students
had the opportunity to mingle with
alumni and faculty.
STEMS was founded four years
ago to give graduate students in
engineering management the
chance to interact with department
alumni to discuss their careers and
projects. It has since expanded to
include people involved in technolo
gy management, engineering-eco
nomic systems, operations
research and manufacturing sys
tems engineering, Frank said.
Tom Vander Weide and Romain
Agostini, graduates of Stanford's
engineering management program
and former presidents of STEMS,
emphasized the important role that
the organization has played for stu
dents in the department as they
enter the job market.
"What it all boils down to is net

working and building connections,"
Vander Weide said. "Three years
ago, we didn't even know who the
alumni were. The department
didn't have the resources to develop
this aspect of our education, so the
students did it themselves."
Agostini said the organization
has taken on a social focus to
account for the growing impor
tance of networking in the engi
neering industry. "Basically,
STEMS is a grass-roots movement
to make the engineering studies
not only technical but more
social," he said.
Vander Weide added that "engi
neers have to know how to interact
with other people and deal with
personal issues."
Leaders of the group feel that
the Graduate School of Business
has served as a model for the per
sonal qualities that STEMS and
activities like Saturday's mixer
strive to promote.
"The Business School has a
robust alumni network, while our
program and alumni base are rela
tively smaller," said David Framp
ton, a graduate student in engi
neering management who is co
president of STEMS.
Frank added that a primary goal
of events like the Spring Fling is "to

develop students' social and net
working skills by helping them get
together with faculty and alumni in
a relaxed social environment."
Vander Weide and Agostini
agree that the department has been
increasingly supportive of STEMS
since the group's inception,
attributing more importance to
personal interactions in the engi
neering field as a result of the orga
nization's work.
The department now holds a
mini-course in interpersonal
dynamics as part of the move
toward "getting engineers to inter
act and find out more about each
other," Vander Weide said.
"This kind of communication
helps jump-start projects," Agosti
ni said.
Charles Banfe, a lecturer in
industrial engineering, believes
that STEMS has exerted a signifi
cant influence in terms of changing
the highly technical training for
which engineering educations have
been notorious.
"The goal of a motivating and
stimulating program like STEMS
is getting engineers away from
highly-structured math and sci
ence and teaching them how to
manage technology and the people
in technology," Banfe said.
