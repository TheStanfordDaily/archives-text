# Students to attack slow mail
## 
### Laura Shin Staff writer 
One student accepted a job not
knowing another offer would be
delivered two weeks late. Another
never received misaddressed credit
card bills. A third found Christmas
cards in her box four months after
they were postmarked.
Frustrated with erratic service
at the Stanford post office, a new
student group is campaigning to
prevent such mishaps.
"If 500 people would write post
cards to the postmaster general, he
would do something about it," said
music graduate student Beth Har
rison, a founder of Stop Cursing
the Dark, or SCuD.
Harrison has posted fliers
around campus that provide the
address of Postmaster General
Marvin Runyan, and remind writ
ers to include Stanford's zip code.
Charlene Jurian, a supervisor
at the post office, defended service
there. "Students need to be more
educated about what we do here,"
she said, adding that the post office
has 10,000 P.O. boxes and serves
students during busy times like
lunch hour.
Harrison, however, wants
faster delivery. "It doesn't matter
to me that there are long lines at
the post office," she said.
The group's co-founder, music
graduate student Paul von Hippel,
notified people of the movement
through the electronic mail sys
tem. A week after the e-mail post
ings first went out, von Hippel said
he received "about half a dozen" e
mail responses.
"I've received several letters 14
to 18 days late (after the postmark)
and ... one of these was a job offer,
and in the interim I accepted
another job," said senior David
Andre in an e-mail reply.
Von Hippel said his credit card
account was closed down after the
company addressed the bills to Box
8499, which is non-existent,
instead of Box 8449. "If mail for
me is even slightly misaddressed, it
does not arrive," he said.
For Harrison, the "breaking
point" that led her to begin the
campaign was hearing that "this
post office is notorious in the Palo
Alto community" for needing
improvement. "Because no one
reports it, the status quo contin

ues," she said, adding that post
offices on larger campuses have
given her no problems.
Jurian suggested that students
fill out the "complaint or compli
ment cards" available in the post
office lobby. "We answer all of
them," she said, either through a
phone call or a letter.
But Harrison said she has
already tried that route. She filled
out three or four cards several
years ago about the slow mail
delivery and gave up after getting
no response.
The basic point of her campaign
is to make people aware that they
can bring about a change. "There's
no reason why the postal service at
Stanford can't do a good job," she
said.
Another e-mail respondent,
who wished to remain anonymous
to safeguard her mail, said she did
"experiments on the post office."
She mailed herself letters at her
P.O. box and at her home address
on campus to see which would
arrive first.
"The mail to my house comes
three days faster," she said. "I don't
know if they don't have time. Maybe
they should hire more personnel."
