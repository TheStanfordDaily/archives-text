# Students to attack slow mail
## 
### Laura Shin Staff writer 
One student accepted a job not
knowing another offer would be
delivered two weeks late. Another
never received misaddressed credit
card bills. A third found Christmas
cards in her box four months after
they were postmarked.
Frustrated with erratic service
at the Stanford post office, a new
student group is campaigning to
prevent such mishaps.
"If 500 people would write post
cards to the postmaster general, he
would do something about it," said
music graduate student Beth Har
rison, a founder of Stop Cursing
the Dark, or SCuD.
Harrison has posted fliers
around campus that provide the
address of Postmaster General
Marvin Runyan, and remind writ
ers to include Stanford's zip code.
Charlene Jurian, a supervisor
at the post office, defended service
there. "Students need to be more
educated about what we do here,"
she said, adding that the post office
has 10,000 P.O. boxes and serves
students during busy times like
lunch hour.
Harrison, however, wants
faster delivery. "It doesn't matter
to me that there are long lines at
the post office," she said.
