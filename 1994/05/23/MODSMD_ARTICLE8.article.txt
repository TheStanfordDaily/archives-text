# Creating a mosaic of culture
## Stained-glass project unites Chicano, Jewish youths 
### Piers Henwood Staff writer 
Eleven-year-old Yeugeniy Sterenzat,
whose family left Russia one year ago to
begin a new life in the Bay Area, looked
closely at the words he had written: "I pic
ture a world in which there is no war."
The phrase, which he proceeded to
carve into a square piece of cardboard,
was then transformed into a small
stained-glass window, all thanks to a com
munity outreach program organized by
the Jewish Students Association and
MEChA, a Chicano/Latino student orga
nization.
Yeugeniy, along with about 25 other
Russian-Jewish and Chicano students
from local communities, gathered yester
day in Tresidder Union's Oak Lounge to
participate in the one-day event. According
to sophomore Natalie Grunfeld, a co-orga
nizer of the program, it was intended to
bridge the gap between two very different
communities.
"We wanted to find a fun way to bring
two groups together, something that
wouldn't just involve sitting and talking,"

she said.
Michael Latz, the program director at
Stanford's Hillel Foundation, echoed this
perspective, adding that recent events on
campus demonstrate the program's
value.
"The program is especially important in
the wake of the art that's been destroyed
here," he said, referring to the vandaliza
tion of the "Gay Liberation" sculpture last
week.
Each of the students developed his or
her own individual design, which in turn
will be combined into one large mosaic dur
ing the coming month. Grunfeld empha
sized the need to give the students an indi
vidual project that would also be seen as a
collective activity.
"We figured it was the best thing to do,
because the students could visualize their
own design and then have it incorporated
into one big one," she said.
The students were encouraged to think
of three themes in planning their individual
segments — their cultural heritage, per
sonal identity and vision of the future.

Armando Avina, a 13-year-old
from East Palo Alto, knew imme
diately how to express his her
itage.
"My family is from Mexico, so I
put on a picture of a Mayan plate,"
he said.
Overseeing the technical
aspects of the stained-glass pro
duction were local artists Michelle
and David Plachte-Zuieback, each
of whom do professional stained
glass work for local synagogues
and churches. David Plachte-
Zuieback was quick to emphasize
art's unifying potential.
"Art is a wonderful way for peo
ple to interact with each other and
express themselves," he said.
The program was made possible
by funding from the North Ameri
can Jewish Studies Appeal, a nation
al organization that has established
a grant "for art and social action,"
according to Grunfeld.
The final conglomeration of
stained glass will be on display in
Tresidder late next month.
