# Athletes respond to stereotype supported by vandals' 'bad mistake'
## 
### Shirley Park Staff writer 
The publicity resulting from last week's van
dalism of the "Gay Liberation" statue is perpetu
ating a stereotype that is generally untrue, say
many athletes and fraternity members who were
not involved in the incident.
On May 16, seven students allegedly defaced
the George Segal sculpture located outside the
Quad. The students were all members of the base
ball, football or wrestling teams — as well as
members or pledges of the Delta Tau Delta or
Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternities.
"What [the seven athletes] did was definitely
wrong," said junior David Carder, a football play
er and a Delt. "But the fact that they had some
thing in common — that they were frat members
£uid athletes — made them easy to attack."
The interviewed athletes said the incident rep
resented unacceptable behavior, and they realize
that the alleged vandals need to be held account
able for their behavior because of the close scruti
ny that comes with being a varsity athlete.
"When you're an athlete, you have to know
that you're in the limelight and realize that people
are going to look at you differently," said junior
Jimmy Aguirre, a wrestler and a Delt.
"The seriousness and publicity increase was
due to the fact that they were athletes," said
sophomore pitcher Mike Robbins, a Delt member.
"That's a part of what comes with being an ath
lete."
Several athletes agreed that the arrested seven
exercised "bad judgment."
But, said Robbins, "all the guys involved
understand [their mistakes] in a big way."
The publicity generated by the incident is
unfortunate in reinforcing a stereotype of athletic

organizations which is "98 percent not true," said
freshman Brian Batson, a football player.
"We accept the responsibility of being in a
high-profile, publicized position. We respect that
very much," Batson said. "Most guys do their best
to uphold [this responsibility]."
Robbins added that the publicity surrounding
the incident has furthered "detrimental" stereo
types. "They happened to be members of high
profile groups, but it's not fair to link all the mem
bers," he said.
Although the Greek judicial board is now inves
tigating to determine if the Delts and the SAEs
should share responsibility for the incident, inter
viewed members said their fraternities have no
connection in the affair.
"They did it as individuals, and they'll have to
accept the consequences as individuals," said
sophomore Cale Carter, a baseball player and a
Delt. "The organizations really have nothing to do
with it."
Carter added that the Delt house does not con
done the students' action and should not be held
responsible.
"It's not fair ... to judge all the members of a
frat by a few members' actions," Aguirre said.
The incident, which is now receiving national
attention, could possibly give the teams and fra
ternities bad reputations by linking them to the
vandalism. However, most athletes appeared
more concerned about the welfare of their impli
cated friends.
"Most of us aren't worried so much about [the
impact on the programs' national reputations] as
much as saving [the athletes'] dignity, the guys
who are getting the worst of it," Batson said.
Carter also said he felt "distressed," not for the
reputation of himself and his team, but for the
arrested students who are his friends.
