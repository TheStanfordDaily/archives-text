## Onassis laid to rest with grace 
### 
ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) - Jacque
line Kennedy Onassis was buried with
simple grace yesterday beside her slain
husband's eternal flame, overlooking
the capital she once enchanted,
mourned by a country that knew her as
part of a time now gone.
Under brilliant sun on a summerlike
day, at the place where she had won a
world's admiration for her dignity at a
time of grieving, the widow of John F.
Kennedy and Aristotle Onassis was
laid to rest.
Her daughter and her son, the
White House children long-since
grown, knelt before the coffin and
kissed it.
"God gave her very great gifts and
imposed upon her great burdens," said
President Clinton. "She bore them all
with dignity and grace and uncommon
common sense."
From Washington Cathedral in the
distance, a bell tolled 64 times, once for
each year of her life.
"We say goodbye to Jackie," Clinton
said. "May the flame she lit so long ago
burn ever brighter here and always
brighter in our hearts."
It had been more than 10,000 days
since Jacqueline Kennedy had stood at
this place in a widow's black veil, car
rying the nation's grief, accepting the

folded coffin flag of a martyred presi
dent killed as she sat beside him in an
open limousine.
Now she joined him, a victim of can
cer. She had been "a lesson to the
world," her brother-in-law, Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy, said at her funer
al in New York, "on how to do things
right, how to be a mother, how to
appreciate history, how to be coura
geous."
In keeping with the privacy she
cherished in life, the burial ceremony
was reserved, lasting only 11 minutes.
It brought together about 100 mem
bers of the Kennedy, Auchincloss and
Radziwill families, including Lee
Radziwill Ross, Mrs. Onassis' sister.
The people at the service were all
family except for a few, including
Providencia Paredes, who was Jackie's
personal maid in the White House; her
son, Gustavo, who grew up together
with John and is still a close friend;
and Mrs. Kennedy's companion for the
last 12 years or so, Maurice Tempels
man.
The Rev. Philip Hannan presided
over the burial service, just as he had
for Mrs. Kennedy's husband. He was
auxiliary bishop of Washington then;
he is the retired archbishop of New
Orleans now.

He prayed for consolation for those
"who have suffered the loss of her mor
tal presence."
The service was carried by television
to a world that knew Mrs. Kennedy as
perhaps the world's most famous
woman, unquestionably among its
most admired. She died Thursday,
before her admirers could grasp how ill
she was.
Buried alongside are the couple's
first child, an unnamed daughter still
born in 1956, and an infant son,
Patrick, who died three days after his
birth in August 1963. A few paces away
lie the remains of Robert F. Kennedy,
slain in 1968.
In a steady voice, John Kennedy Jr.
delivered a eulogy, paying tribute to his
mother's "love of words, bonds of home
and family and her spirit of adven
ture."
Said his uncle, Senator Kennedy:
"She graced our history. And for those
of us who knew and loved her, she
graced our lives."
Hundreds of people gathered in the
streets, representative of people every
where who treasured memories of her
as an enchanting young wife in the
White House; as a dignified widow
marching behind her husband's horse
drawn funeral caisson.
