# Judges can't overrule base closings
## Federal judges will be unable to intervene with government decisions 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Federal
judges cannot second-guess government
decisions to close military bases, the
Supreme Court ruled yesterday in a vic
tory for the Clinton administration in
its effort to shrink the post-Cold War
armed services.
The court unanimously threw out a
challenge by Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa.,
to the planned closing of a shipyard in
his home state.
Federal law gives judges no authority
to intervene, the court said. The admin
istration had argued that letting judges
step in would make it impossible to
quickly trim the military.
A decision in Specter's favor could

have led to a flood of lawsuits over the
government's decisions since 1991 to
shut down 164 military installations
and realign 93 others. Additional base
closings were ordered in 1989.
The federal base-closing law does not
bar the president from approving closing
recommendations even if they were pro
cedurally flawed, Chief Justice William
H. Rehnquist wrote for the court.
"Indeed, nothing in . . . (the law) pre
vents the president from approving or
disapproving the recommendations for
whatever reason he sees fit," Rehnquist
said. "How the president chooses to
exercise the discretion Congress has
granted him is not a matter for our

review.
"There is just no reason why the
courts of America should not review
this kind of evidence of fraud, deception
and cheating and lying by the Depart
ment of the Navy," Specter told
reporters in Philadelphia.
The base-closing decision reversed a
3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling
that had let Specter challenge the gov
ernment's decision to close the Philadel
phia Naval Shipyard.
Philadelphia Mayor Edward G. Ren
dell said yesterday's ruling "wipes away
something that we were trying to fight
for. We have to get new jobs to replace
that asset."
