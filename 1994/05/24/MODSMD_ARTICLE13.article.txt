Biehl's murderers released
CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) -
Three men accused of murdering Ameri
can student Amy Biehl, a 1989 Stanford
graduate, were released after posting a
small amount of bail yesterday and left
the courthouse to be cheered by their
supporters outside.
Prosecutor Nollie Niehaus did not
oppose the bail request and asked that it
be set at 250 rand (about $70) each.
The three blacks accused of killing
Biehl, a 26-year-old white Fulbright
scholar from Newport Beach, Calif., all
belonged to the militant Pan Africanist
Congress. A crowd chanting racial slurs

surrounded her last August after she
drove friends to their homes in the black
township of Guguletu, and beat and
stabbed her to death.
Biehl had been helping with voter edu
cation projects in black communities
near Cape Town.
Supporters of defendants Mongezi
Manqina, Mzikhona Nofemela and
Vusumzi Ntamo taunted white passersby
outside the courthouse Monday. The
hearings have been marked by such con
frontations since the trial began last
year.
The men were embraced by relatives
and cheered by a few supporters yester
day.
