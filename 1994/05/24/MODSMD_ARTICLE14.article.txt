THERE ARE lessons to be
learned from the recent inci
dent of vandalism here at
Stanford. That is why the "Gay
Liberation" sculpture — defaced
and with open wounds — is being
left in place for a few weeks before
it is repaired.
In previous cases of vandalism,
it had been taken away for repair
almost immediately. But this last
case has prompted a different
response. For educational purpos
es, the damaged sculpture will be
left out for public viewing for a
few weeks. Teach-ins and other
educational activities to address
the incident will be planned by the
Art Museum, the Dean of Stu
dents Office and members of the
lesbian, gay and bisexual commu
nity.
Fortunately, the community
has recognized that the repetition
of events must be stopped — and
though it may be a meager step in
the face of perhaps deeply

ingrained values, education is
nonetheless a step in the right
direction.
Everyone can stand to benefit
by learning about the sculpture as
a work of art and as a unique and
cherished symbol for the gay com
munity.
Education might not convert
everyone into tolerant lovers of
art, but it could at least give peo
ple a chance to reflect — on art,
diversity, violence and the linger
ing consequences of this particu
lar incident.
Because whether it was vio
lence against gays, violence
against art or just violence for vio
lence's sake, the vandalism of the
sculpture is undeniably
deplorable.
Offering chances for the entire
community to learn more about
the incident and the issues sur
rounding it is a laudable way to
highlight the positive aspects out
of such a sobering situation.
