# Recruiting students
## 
### 
COMPETITION for the best
high-school students has
always been tough, even for
top schools like Stanford. As a
result, the Office of Undergradu
ate Admissions, according to Dean
James Montoya, is looking into
other ways to lure prospective stu
dents, including merit-based schol
arships^
However, a cheaper — and per
haps more effective — solution is
already available: current Stan
ford students.
The Admissions Office already
has a program that trains about
50 students to go back to schools
near their home and plug Stan
ford to potential applicants.
But this program is not well
known — in the future, it would
benefit greatly from increased
publicity, which often involves
little more than fliers and RA
announcements.

If the Admissions Office is
seriously looking at merit-based
scholarships to lure students, it
could probably afford to expand
the program's recruitment and
training programs — and per
haps even provide a small com
pensation to students for their
service.
It's impossible for Stanford
admissions officers to cover every
possible school; Stanford stu
dents could easily fill in more of
the cracks — and provide per
spectives no one else can give.
It's a safe bet that a lot of Stan
ford students visit their old high
schools over breaks or before fall
quarter starts. At minimal cost,
the Admissions Office could make
more of these visits effective ways
to advertise Stanford.
After all, someone needs to tell
East Coast students that earth
quakes don't happen every day.
