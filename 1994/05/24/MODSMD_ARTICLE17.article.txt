## A 						four-year instant replay 
### 
SO IT'S FINALLY over. I think that
I finally realized that my under
graduate life ended during Sunday's
game seven of the Knicks-Bulls series. As
the Bulls were spiraling toward defeat, I
understood it was an omen for me as
well. It seemed as if the end of every year
at Stanford was punctuated by a Bulls
championship. And now with the Bulls
gone, like an errant pass out of bounds, I
would follow.
What a ride. Quarter after quarter
whizzed by my head. Frosh year was
blurred at a zillion miles an hour. Late
night chats with the RA who became
everything you want to be in life, that
blind date for a dance, crazy parties with
roommates and friends and that first col
lege relationship. It seemed like it would
never end. I used to tell myself that I had
three more years at Stanford and, hey,
that was more than enough time. Shoot,
that class would be offered again next
year and there would always be tomor
row to do whatever you planned to do
yesterday. Nothing would change.
Sophomore year was a rude awaken
ing. No one seemed to care for you any
more. Gone were the old RAs, AAs and
seniors that befriended you. The social
web that you had worked so hard to
weave was mercilessly torn asunder. No
more CIV or frosh English. Classes were
full of people who began to care about
their grades and of upperclassmen doing
that retake thing.
Even when I was riding over the man

icured grass of Oak Creek apartments
during my junior year, I failed to realize
that time was running out. However, this
was followed by a severe bout of apathy
soon accompanied by that terrible afflic
tion that causes you to forget names
entirely. A cappella concerts, special con
ferences and career fairs came and went.
And senior year, it's not as if I got any
smarter. I still went on bike rides in the
foothills braving life, limb and good tires
during a full moon frolic. I've just become
weathered. Since turning in my thesis, I
feel as if I'm on the outside looking in. I
find myself scheduling my free time to
spend with people who have been a big
part of my life.
Who am I going to remember? It's
hard to tell. Sometimes you think when
you meet someone that you'll keep in
touch with them forever. You imagine
long distance calls in the middle of the
night to that special someone in your
frosh dorm. But in reality, so many of
those faces will become just that — faces.
Just like your buddies from high school
they'll go off in their separate directions.
Yet I can still see the people that I want
in my Dockers commercials.
I had always imagined some future
scene in my life where I was going
through my old drawers in my house and
would come across my old college stuff.
Crinkled pictures at sunny football
games with people that had long since
vanished from my world, old letters full
of emotion and the myriad of knick

knacks that I had accumulated. I would
sigh and try to piece together the pictures
that weren't there; the scenes that I
never had the camera for and were now
fading from my mind's eye. I would imag
ine myself without wrinkles and with a
full head of hair.
As time passed, I would try to paint
the events that should have taken place
but never did for one reason or another.
Those are the hardest to remember and
impossible to forget. My sojourn to the
past would then be interrupted by the
kids clamoring for ice cream, the wife
asking for a new dress and the sound of
the past whistling away — taking with it
a part of my life that was once without
much responsibility or worry.
But am I getting too nostalgic? Who
knows. I'll ask myself that question when I
wake up with a mid-life crisis nightmare.
In a strange way, I'm also excited at
leaving. It must be like the fetus saying,
"Well, life's been good so far, but hey,
where's that light coming from? Hey
buster, stop pulling my head!" And
wham, reality. The whole world is out
there and I've only experienced a small
part of it. No room for cliches here.
That's all folks.

Atman is still complaining about the offi
ciating in the Dulls-Knicks series.
