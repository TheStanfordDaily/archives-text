## Speech code lawsuit is 'frivolous,' plaintiffs will not win 
### 
HAS ANYONE else noticed the
news lately? Stanford is being
challenged to abandon its great
tradition of tolerance: right-wing
fanatics are suing the University over
the Grey interpretation of the Funda
mental Standard, and hardly a word in
its defense is heard in Crown Quad.
Where is the oppressive liberal majori
ty the plaintiffs have been whining
about? They've been rather quiet for
"thought police," I think.
Maybe the majority sentiment is
that the law suit is flawed and
frivolous and doomed to failure. That
would explain the runny-nosed, mil
quetoast response from our career
minded community. Why get branded a
liberal for no reason, eh?
You never know what public state
ments they'll dredge up at your confir
mation hearing.
Fair enough. But lest silence resem
ble approval, let it not go unsaid that
the Grey lawsuit is flawed, frivolous
and nasty. It has nothing to do with
the First Amendment and everything
to do with our attitudes toward harass
ment.
From their suit, the plaintiffs will
get the press attention they want and

some loud expressions of sympathy
from other straight men and closet
cases. But they won't win their case
because they don't have a legal leg to
stand on.
The First Amendment does not pro
tect every vile act cloaked in words. It
doesn't protect the co-worker whose
lewd jokes create a "hostile work envi
ronment." It doesn't protect the doctor
who tells you to take the wrong
medicine. It doesn't protect the person
who says "Boo!" when you're standing
on a ledge. It doesn't protect libel or
slander. And it doesn't protect "fight
ing words."
Fighting words are taunts, insults,
epithets or provocations, words that
"by their very utterance inflict injury."
Their exclusion from the First Amend
ment has been well-settled for 50
years, since the Supreme Court upheld
the conviction of a man named Chap
linsky under a New Hampshire law
prohibiting face-to-face hate speech.
This is exactly what the Grey interpre
tation does.
Law school aspirants read on: there
is one very technical requirement in
addition that the Grey interpretation
either meets or with minor amendment

can be made to meet. The Court has
said you can ban fighting words alto
gether, but you can't ban racist fight
ing words and no others. The Grey
interpretation does set out selective
categories of fighting words to ban, but
it does not make its list exhaustive, so
there probably is no problem. But even
if there is a problem, the Grey inter
pretation can easily be saved by
rephrasing its "fighting words" formu
lation to read "harassment" or
"harassing conduct." This is what the
Civil Rights Act does, and a harass
ment clause would serve the same pur
pose as the Grey interpretation in its
present form.
Enough lawyer's games. What I've
said is nothing new or original, and the
plaintiffs know it. If they really cared
about keeping the Grey interpretation
within the four corners of the First
Amendment they would have proposed
this themselves. And here, friends and
colleagues, we have the crux of the
matter before us — and free speech has
nothing to do with it. For behind their
platitudes about the First Amendment,
buried deep in the premises of their
arguments, the plaintiffs have hidden
their real gripe: Stanford's attempt to

give "special treatment" — in other
words, protection and support — to col
oreds and perverts and girls.
Would they, I wonder, really be any
happier with a new, "First Amend
ment-cautious," Grey "harassment"
interpretation that still mentioned
racial and sexual minorities and
women explicitly? Alternatively, if the
interpretation is repealed, and Stan
ford is again safe for verbal harass
ment, what will be the plaintiffs' next
demand? Let me offer them a sugges
tion in the spirit of their present pro
ject: how about an endowed chair in
White Studies?
After all, the principle of fairness is
at stake, and no good American could
oppose fairness, right? (Say, and here's
a slogan for you: "Equality is color
blind!" What do you think?)
"Oh yawn," thinks the reader. "So
the suit is an anti-tolerance, anti
"diversity" campaign in the face of
which we, especially those of us at the
law school, have seemed apathetic. We
knew this already. We're just busy."
How tedious of me to bring it up.
Tennis anyone?
