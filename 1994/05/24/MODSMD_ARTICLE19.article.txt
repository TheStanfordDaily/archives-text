# Fraternity apologizes for flier that offended Caribbean community
## 
### 
As concerned men of the African-
American community and the larger
Stanford community, the members of
Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity feel that it
is not only our duty but also our obli
gation to apologize for being culturally
insensitive to other members of the
African Diaspora. We are referring to
a flier for our Reggae Night which

offended students of Caribbean
descent.
This flier featured Bob Marley
smoking marijuana.
It was neither our intent nor our
desire to offend anyone with this flier.
We carelessly presented an image
which not only promotes ignorance in
our community but also in the larger
Stanford community. As men of dis
tinction we feel it is necessary to rec
ognize our mistakes and make amends
for them. Therefore we have taken the
following actions:
• removing all fliers;
• submitting an apology to the

Caribbean Student Association (CSA);
• and submitting a letter of apology
to the entire Stanford community.
We hope this will be instrumental
in opening the lines of communication
among all students in this microcosm
of the world.
