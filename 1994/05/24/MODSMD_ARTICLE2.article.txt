# Tennis advances to NCAA finals
## 
### Mike Langford Senior staff writer 
SOUTH BEND, Ind. — Playing per
haps its best tennis of the year, the Stan
ford men's tennis team (25-2, ranked
second nationally) rolled over UCLA (22-
6, ninth) in yesterday's semifinal at the
NCAA Championships and earned the
right to play USC (21-3, first) in today's
final match.
Stanford won the doubles point and
three straight-set singles matches en
route to the 4-0 win, and did it in con
vincing fashion.
"This feels great," said Stanford se
nior Michael Flanagan. "Not just be
cause we're in the finals, but also be-

cause of how we've got
ten there."
Yesterday's match
featured the second 4-0
win over a top-10 oppo
nent in as many days.
And for the third con
secutive match, Stan
ford's new-look doubles
teams dominated.
This time, Stan-

ford's second doubles team, now com
prised of sophomore JefTSalzenstein and
senior Robert Devens, walked off the
court with the first win. Facing the
Bruin freshman combo of Erics — Lin
and Taino — Salzenstein and Devens
looked confident and consistent in their

third doubles match as partners this
year.
Third doubles, featuring freshman
Grant Elliott and senior Vimal Patel,
also playing together for the just the
third time this year, lost a break early.
But the duo broke back at 5-5 to even
things up with UCLA's Heath Mont
gomery and Loren Peters. Both teams
Btayed on serve until, with UCLA serving
at 7-8, Stanford broke serve to win the
match 9-7, earning the Cardinal the first
point of the day.
Stanford's first doubles team of
Flanagan and Chris Cocotos, which was
also down a break early, had fought back


Patel
and was beating Robert Janecek and
Sebastien Leßlanc 8-7 when doubles
play ended.
"The last time we played they won all
three doubles matches," said Stanford
head coach Dick Gould. "I didn't know if
we could win [the doubles point]."
With point in hand, Stanford once
again exploded in singles, winning five
of the first six sets. Such early domina
tion has been one of the reasons for
Stanford's success at NCAAs.
"Winning all those first sets is such a
momentum boost for us," Flanagan
said. "It helps going into singles to get
the doubles point. And then when the
guys on the other team see that they've
lost all those first sets in singles, and it
makes them lose resolve."
The first to lose resolve was probably
UCLA's Rae Cho, who was demolished
at sixth singles after playing for an
injured Lin. Patel played at sixth singles
for Stanford after giving sophomore
Ricky Becker a shot at the position on
Sunday. But after Becker's less than
consistent showing, the position was
given back to the senior Patel, who
responded with a 6-3, 6-1 thumping of
the Bruin Cho.
The next win for Stanford came at
second singles, where Salzenstein
defeated the Bruin sophomore and
Canadian Davis Cupper Leßlanc for the
third time this season. Salzenstein used
powerful groundstrokes and a great ser
vice game on the way to his 6-2, 7-6 (7-
4) win.
Shortly thereafter, Devens pulled out
a characteristically hard-nosed tie-break
victory at fourth singles, defeating
Loren Peters 6-4, 7-6 (7-1) after a bevy
of service breaks on both sides. Devens
showed no signs of the sore back which
held him out of singles action in Satur
day's first round match against Fresno
State.
Devens' win gave Stanford three sin
gles wins and the necessary four points
needed for the victory.

When play ceased, No. 8-ranked
Flanagan was on the verge of winning
his match against No. 6-ranked Janecek
7-5, 5-4.
Sophomore Jim Thomas was leading
Montgomery 6-4, 6-6 at fifth singles
when play stopped. Cocotos continued
his typically strong play at NCAAs, and
was tied with Taino 4-6, 6-1 at third sin
gles.
"The whole match was a little closer
than the score shows, but we did pretty
much get handed a whoopin'," said
UCLA head coach Billy Martin. "It was
a good tournament for UCLA. We have
a really young team. We'll be back."
USC, which beat Mississippi State 4-
0 in the other semifinal, will be Stan
ford's opponent today at 2 p.m. In both
meetings this year, Stanford has lost 4-
3 in tight matches.
"The teams are very comparable,"
said Martin, who has faced both Stan
ford and USC this year. "They are defi
nitely the best two teams in college ten
nis. It will be a good match, and will
probably come down to who really
wants it."
Stanford will have to continue its
inspired doubles play — USC has not
lost the doubles portion of a dual meet
all year.
"We are playing great doubles,"
Gould said. "But if we are to beat USC
in doubles, we're really going to have to
earn it."
"I think we match up well," Flana
gan said of the two lineups. "It seems
that we've beat them at every position,
just not at the right times."
Today's match will be a meeting of
the powerhouses of college men's ten
nis. Both teams have been ranked either
first or second in the nation all year.
Aside from UCLA with 15, no team has
won as many national championships as
USC or Stanford, which have 14 and 12
titles, respectively.
Stanford has appeared in the finals
for the 11 times since the team format of
the championships was instituted in
1977. And in those 11 chances, Stanford

has won an incredible 10 titles.
But Gould remains cautious when
evaluating his teams chances for anoth
er championship.
"We've put ourselves in a position to
win," Gould said. "Now we have to see if
we can rise up and take advantage of the
opportunity we've made for ourselves."
However, Flanagan, who along with

Cocotos, Devens and Patel will all be
playing their last dual match for Stan
ford, thinks that the team is exactly
where they want to be.
"We have tremendous chemistry,
which has been a key to our success all
year," Flanagan said. "I think we're
playing our best tennis of the year right
now."
