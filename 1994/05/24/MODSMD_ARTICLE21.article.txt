## Personal cowardice: the new PC at Stanford 
### 
I think the whole thing's been blown
out of proportion Stanford students
are almost force-fed political correctness. 1
don t think people feel too strongly about
any of these issues. I think what they did
was just sort of a reaction.
— Chris Horpel, Stanford men's wrestling
coach
I was thinking of [the Chicano/a] protest
in the context of how honest it was and
how committed the individuals were. My
own reaction in seeing this (defacement) is
it's a complete act of cowardice. There's no
honesty in it. If they weren't caught, they'd
still be hiding.
— Thomas Seligman, Stanford Art Muse
um Director
SHOUTING SLURS at Sunday
Flicks. Bashing statues and pouring
paint on them. Egging a staff
spouse's car. These last few weeks have
done little to polish Stanford's already tar
nished image — and the official responses
to them promise to do even less.
But even more troubling than the
actions themselves is the tangled web of
excuses and explanations woven by those
who seek to avoid the issues that those
actions raise. Indeed, a willingness to take
responsibility for one's actions seems to
be in short supply at Stanford. Think
about it as the Menendez-ation of the

campus: everyone has a reason why peo
ple shouldn't be held accountable for his
or her behavior.
Take the screening of "No Grapes"
before "Mrs. Doubtfire" at Sunday Flicks,
where some students shouted such things
as "Yes, pesticides" and "Go home, bean
er." No one who said those things came
forward and admitted having done so. But
their defenders were out in force, saying
the catcalls and slurs weren't racist. We
came to see a comedy, but they forced us
to watch this propaganda, they said.
It reflects poorly on this institution
that shouting slurs could be considered a
legitimate form of dissent. Leaving the
theater, yes. Talking to the sponsors of
the short, yes. Yelling "Go home, beaner?"
But the defenders of those unidentified
cowards would rather explain away their
words than confront them head-on.
This same mentality was in evidence
last week when seven Stanford athletes
splashed paint on the University's famed
"Gay Liberation" statues, bashed them
with a nearby bench and rammed a bench
between the two male statues.
In the San Jose Mercury News,
wrestling coach Horpel tried to explain
their actions as a protest against the
tyranny of political correctness on campus
as well as a celebration of the baseball
team's victory in the Pac-10 Champi
onships. As Stanford Art History Prof.

Albert Elsen said, "If they were celebrat
ing a baseball victory, heaven help us if
they win the national championship."
Horpel's creativity in the face of the
athletes' bigotry is admirable, but I don't
know of many protests that consist of
vandalism at 2 a.m. followed by an
attempt to escape the police both by car
and foot. The recent protests on campus
by members of the Chicano and Asian-
American communities, in which every
one stood up to be counted, bear little
resemblance to the craven acts of vandal
ism that he would have us excuse.
Still, Horpel is almost correct when he
identifies the villain as PC. But it isn't
political correctness. It's personal cow
ardice — a trait Horpel shares with the
seven athletes and their apologists.
He sent a letter to The Daily in which
he said that he didn't mean to imply that
he condoned the athletes' actions, but
expounded on what he considered the
protest aspect of their motivation and the
chilling effect that political correctness
has on speech at Stanford.
Within 24 hours, he pulled the letter
and replaced it with a short statement
that apologized for his quotes in the Mer
cury News and that he would comply fully
with the University's judicial process. Pre
sumably, this switch will now be blamed
on political correctness.
Again, the culprit is actually personal

cowardice. If Horpel'sjob as coach pre
cludes him from honestly sharing his
views in The Daily, that is a matter
between him and Ted Leland, athletics
director. If Horpel thinks that his opinion
was egregiously mistaken, he should want
to correct it. But to blame political cor
rectness for the athletes' behavior and to
retract what he has written doesn't say
much for their courage — a trait that has
always been part of the athletic ideal.
True courage means that your views
and opinions are not dictated by what oth
ers might think. It means that you
express yourself openly and accept the
consequences. Because the right of free
speech doesn't protect you from others
disagreeing with you, even vehemently.
But it's obvious that this was not about
political correctness or free speech. The
athletes struck under the cover of dark
ness and, upon being discovered by the
police, scurried into the night — certainly
not the actions of courageous individuals.
If they hadn't been caught, would they
have come forward and confessed? Or
would they have remained anonymous,
like the coward(s) who egged Casa Zapata
Resident Fellow Tony Burciaga's car?
The administration's response to these
events has been both predictable and
futile. Step 1: University President Ger
hard Casper makes an official statement
denouncing the event. Step 2: Dean of

Students Michael Jackson and/or Vice
Provost for Student Affairs Mary
Edmonds write an indignant letter of con
demnation. Step 3: The University holds
or makes plans to hold some sort of cam
pus forum/discussion/meeting on the sub
ject. Step 4: Satisfied, they return to their
daily affairs .. . until something similar
happens. Step 5: Return to Step 1.
Nowhere in this vicious circle does the
University question the role it plays in
these displays of bigotry. The Stanford
Review viciously attacks black, Chicano,
gay, lesbian and bisexual students week
after week, yet University officials contin
ue to grant them interviews for news sto
ries and features without ever questioning
or responding to those attacks. Again, per
sonal cowardice.
The net effect of this silence is to give
such ideas as The Review's a veneer of
legitimacy. It's not far from a Review
headline like "Sodomy and the Academy"
to vandalizing a pair of statues to assault
ing a human being. It's not far from cal
lously firing Cecilia Burciaga to egging her
husband's car. But given the personal
cowardice that infects the highest levels of
Stanford's administration, can we really
expect more from its student body?
As above, so below.
