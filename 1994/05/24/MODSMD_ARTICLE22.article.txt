# A 						fond farewell
## Looking back at a dream career

The ball sailed through the uprights, and as
my eyes followed its trajectory and Berke
ley's Memorial Stadium clock ticked down
to :00, the red-and-white mob bearing down on
the field overcame me.
I guess I have John Hopkins to blame.
Hopkins, and pardon me if it dates anyone

that I have to
explain this,
kicked five
field goals in
Big Game
1990 to lift
the Cardinal
football team
to a 27-25 vic
tory in what is
still the most

incredible sporting event I have witnessed first
hand. He also got me hooked on Stanford sports.
Consider the circumstances: a sports nut
since 1979 with two USC alumni for parents, I
grew up a Trojan fan. Needless to say, my first
love of college athletics was football. From Mar
cus Allen to Rodney Peete to Todd Marinovich,
the Men of Troy became heroes in my eyes.
Alas, a "Bravo!" from Dean Fetter and two
months away from home hardened me into a
cynic by Nov. 17, 1990. As a collegian, and a
Stanford student at that, my critical thinking
skills supposedly made me see sports for what
they were — revenue-generating leisure activi
ties fallible people engaged in.
But John Hopkins changed all that. In cap
ping a crazy sequence that allowed the Cardinal
to retain the Axe my freshman year, he made me
realize that Stanford sports stood for pride, ded
ication and integrity — virtues sometimes lost, I
have discovered, by students at prestigious insti
tutions of higher learning.
My interest in our athletic program swelled to
the point where attending games alone no longer
satisfied me. I wanted to be in the thick of the
action, up close and personal with competitors
who could make history with every touchdown,
basket, base hit, qualifying heat, kill or volley.
Yet with a short, slender build and a knack for
the clich6,l had no choice but to be a sportswrit
er.
Sure, I dabbled in the field my senior year of
high school with a local paper back home. I even
wrote what now seem like amateur pieces on
cornerback Darrien Gordon and punter Paul
Stonehouse for the Cardinal Today football pub
lication upon my arrival here. But I wanted
more.
Trying to get my bearings on campus while
realizing that my status at The Daily ranked
somewhere between ameba and protozoa, I sat
out the remainder of my freshman year. I paid to
see the men's basketball team make its run at an
eventual NIT Championship, the women's bas
ketball team work toward a Final Four, both vol
leyball teams fall short in NCAA title quests and
the baseball team make beautiful days at
Sunken Diamond even better.
By sophomore year I began to explore the
depth of Cardinal athletic excellence. As Stan
ford squads tied an all-time record with five
national titles, I re-established ties with The


Off the
Bench

Andy
Eiser
Daily and covered women's gymnas
tics and men's golf as those teams
advanced to NCAA competition for
the first time in a while.
When asked to edit the sports
page my junior year, I jumped at the
chance. What a high — keeping up
with all Stanford teams while run
ning the show and making the
sports page look exactly how I want
ed. Despite the long hours and
sweatshop pay, I took a second
term, putting me on an understand
ably short list in the Daily annals (if
any exist).
While editing last year made me
frantic at times, my return to full
time writing as a senior has been
more like a dream. Stopped one step
shy of my fantasy of covering the
football beat, I wrote the Greek foot

ball column, experiencing the plea
sure/daunting task of following in
the footsteps of my journalistic
hero, Joel Stein. I then took two-of
three marquee sports in the winter
and spring, watching women's bas
ketball and now baseball games and
reporting the action to the student
body.
I loved this job. I loved the con
sistency of Jene Elzie, Kerri Kanu
ka, Notah Begay 111, Casey Martin,
Christy Hedgpeth, Rachel Hemmer,
Dan Reed, A.J. Hinch, Dusty Allen
and Nate Olmstead. I loved the per
formances: Christian Cevaer win
ning the 1992 Pacific 10 Conference
individual golf championship, Anita
Kaplan showing up Lisa Leslie to
the tune of 34 points, Jason Middle
brook throwing the first solo no-hit
ter by a Cardinal pitcher in more
than 13 years.
With the baseball postseason still
to come, my job is not quite com
plete. But I can tell a good thing

coming to an end when I see it.
Soon, "Staff writer," "Editorial
staff" or "Senior staff writer" will
no longer appear below my name, as
if titles matter anyway.
For if one thing I have learned
in the line of duty sticks out, it is
the true definition of "media." I
strive only to serve as your desig
nated hitchhiker on this mini
"information superhighway," not
to stand in the way of Cardinal ath
letes that are the true stars. I hope
I have done well; even better, I
hope you didn't notice that I have
done well.
So long, and as another wave of
red-and-white overcomes me, I step
aside.
"Please clear the field, the game
is not over."

Andy Eiser thinks John Hopkins
and Kirk Gibson should pool their
miracle-making abilities and work
together on a cure for cancer.

The ball sailed through the uprights, and as
my eyes followed its trajectory and Berke
ley's Memorial Stadium clock ticked down
to :00, the red-and-white mob bearing down on
the field overcame me.
I guess I have John Hopkins to blame.
Hopkins, and pardon me if it dates anyone

that I have to
explain this,
kicked five
field goals in
Big Game
1990 to lift
the Cardinal
football team
to a 27-25 vic
tory in what is
still the most

incredible sporting event I have witnessed first
hand. He also got me hooked on Stanford sports.
Consider the circumstances: a sports nut
since 1979 with two USC alumni for parents, I
grew up a Trojan fan. Needless to say, my first
love of college athletics was football. From Mar
cus Allen to Rodney Peete to Todd Marinovich,
the Men of Troy became heroes in my eyes.
Alas, a "Bravo!" from Dean Fetter and two
months away from home hardened me into a
cynic by Nov. 17, 1990. As a collegian, and a
Stanford student at that, my critical thinking
skills supposedly made me see sports for what
they were — revenue-generating leisure activi
ties fallible people engaged in.
But John Hopkins changed all that. In cap
ping a crazy sequence that allowed the Cardinal
to retain the Axe my freshman year, he made me
realize that Stanford sports stood for pride, ded
ication and integrity — virtues sometimes lost, I
have discovered, by students at prestigious insti
tutions of higher learning.
My interest in our athletic program swelled to
the point where attending games alone no longer
satisfied me. I wanted to be in the thick of the
action, up close and personal with competitors
who could make history with every touchdown,
basket, base hit, qualifying heat, kill or volley.
Yet with a short, slender build and a knack for
the clich6,l had no choice but to be a sportswrit
er.
Sure, I dabbled in the field my senior year of
high school with a local paper back home. I even
wrote what now seem like amateur pieces on
cornerback Darrien Gordon and punter Paul
Stonehouse for the Cardinal Today football pub
lication upon my arrival here. But I wanted
more.
Trying to get my bearings on campus while
realizing that my status at The Daily ranked
somewhere between ameba and protozoa, I sat
out the remainder of my freshman year. I paid to
see the men's basketball team make its run at an
eventual NIT Championship, the women's bas
ketball team work toward a Final Four, both vol
leyball teams fall short in NCAA title quests and
the baseball team make beautiful days at
Sunken Diamond even better.
By sophomore year I began to explore the
depth of Cardinal athletic excellence. As Stan
ford squads tied an all-time record with five
national titles, I re-established ties with The

Daily and covered women's gymnas
tics and men's golf as those teams
advanced to NCAA competition for
the first time in a while.
When asked to edit the sports
page my junior year, I jumped at the
chance. What a high — keeping up
with all Stanford teams while run
ning the show and making the
sports page look exactly how I want
ed. Despite the long hours and
sweatshop pay, I took a second
term, putting me on an understand
ably short list in the Daily annals (if
any exist).
While editing last year made me
frantic at times, my return to full
time writing as a senior has been
more like a dream. Stopped one step
shy of my fantasy of covering the
football beat, I wrote the Greek foot

ball column, experiencing the plea
sure/daunting task of following in
the footsteps of my journalistic
hero, Joel Stein. I then took two-of
three marquee sports in the winter
and spring, watching women's bas
ketball and now baseball games and
reporting the action to the student
body.
