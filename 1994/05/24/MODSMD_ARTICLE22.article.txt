The ball sailed through the uprights, and as
my eyes followed its trajectory and Berke
ley's Memorial Stadium clock ticked down
to :00, the red-and-white mob bearing down on
the field overcame me.
I guess I have John Hopkins to blame.
Hopkins, and pardon me if it dates anyone

that I have to
explain this,
kicked five
field goals in
Big Game
1990 to lift
the Cardinal
football team
to a 27-25 vic
tory in what is
still the most

incredible sporting event I have witnessed first
hand. He also got me hooked on Stanford sports.
Consider the circumstances: a sports nut
since 1979 with two USC alumni for parents, I
grew up a Trojan fan. Needless to say, my first
love of college athletics was football. From Mar
cus Allen to Rodney Peete to Todd Marinovich,
the Men of Troy became heroes in my eyes.
Alas, a "Bravo!" from Dean Fetter and two
months away from home hardened me into a
cynic by Nov. 17, 1990. As a collegian, and a
Stanford student at that, my critical thinking
skills supposedly made me see sports for what
they were — revenue-generating leisure activi
ties fallible people engaged in.
But John Hopkins changed all that. In cap
ping a crazy sequence that allowed the Cardinal
to retain the Axe my freshman year, he made me
realize that Stanford sports stood for pride, ded
ication and integrity — virtues sometimes lost, I
have discovered, by students at prestigious insti
tutions of higher learning.
My interest in our athletic program swelled to
the point where attending games alone no longer
satisfied me. I wanted to be in the thick of the
action, up close and personal with competitors
who could make history with every touchdown,
basket, base hit, qualifying heat, kill or volley.
Yet with a short, slender build and a knack for
the clich6,l had no choice but to be a sportswrit
er.
Sure, I dabbled in the field my senior year of
high school with a local paper back home. I even
wrote what now seem like amateur pieces on
cornerback Darrien Gordon and punter Paul
Stonehouse for the Cardinal Today football pub
lication upon my arrival here. But I wanted
more.
Trying to get my bearings on campus while
realizing that my status at The Daily ranked
somewhere between ameba and protozoa, I sat
out the remainder of my freshman year. I paid to
see the men's basketball team make its run at an
eventual NIT Championship, the women's bas
ketball team work toward a Final Four, both vol
leyball teams fall short in NCAA title quests and
the baseball team make beautiful days at
Sunken Diamond even better.
By sophomore year I began to explore the
depth of Cardinal athletic excellence. As Stan
ford squads tied an all-time record with five
national titles, I re-established ties with The
