# On to Texas for baseball
## Stanford earns fourth seed in Central Region

Next stop: the Lone Star State.
The No. 11 Cardinal baseball team opens
postseason play Friday in Austin, Texas, as the
fourth seed in the Central Regional, the NCAA
announced yesterday.
In what figures to be a tough test to start the
six-team, double-elimination tournament for
the right to advance to next month's College
World Series, Stanford (36-22) draws the host
Texas Longhorns, seeded third despite being
the host school.
"This is my first time experiencing this
draw," said Cardinal freshman pitcher Brendan
Sullivan, one of three Stanford players whose
eligibility status is unsure pending the investi
gation of an alleged incident of vandalism on
campus last week. "But being a fourth seed and
playing Texas at their park is as tough as you
can get."
"It's consistent, because nothing has come
easy for us all year," added assistant coach Dave
Esquer.
As if playing on Texas' own Disch-Falk Field
were not difficult enough, the Cardinal finds
itself at an even greater disadvantage in prepar
ing to take on the Longhorns (40-19). Two
starters, junior first baseman Dusty Allen and
sophomore third baseman Brian Dallimore,
were suspended for one game after being eject
ed for fighting in Stanford's Six-Pac-clinching
victory over Arizona State May 15.
But Esquer downplayed the impact of the
players' absences.
"We won without them [Dusty and Brian] in
our biggest game of the year," Esquer said. "It
takes the best team to win, not just the best
nine players."
