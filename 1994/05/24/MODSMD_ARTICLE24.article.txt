# Crew can't get past rivals Washington, Cal
## Unfavorable conditions add to frustrating weekend as women place third, men fourth at Pac-10s 
### Heather Hardwick Staff writer 
An upset had been hoped for but it
was not to be, at least not at the Pacific
10 Conference Championship Races
held this past weekend in Sacramento.
The Stanford varsity women's and
men's crews finished third and fourth,
respectively, behind long-time confer
ence rivals Washington and Cal. Hoping
to overcome losses suffered to these
teams earlier in the year and repeat last
year's remarkable Pac-10 performance,
the Cardinal headed out with determi
nation and aggression but returned
with a bit of frustration.
In describing his frustration with
this apparent trend, varsity captain Will

Porteous had remarked last week that
"we've come so close to a performance
worthy of being called superb and then
fallen a bit short." Pac-lOs were meant
to put an end to this tendency, and yet
they proved to be no exception, as the
varsity men's boat missed second place
by a 1.5 seconds and lost third by a mere
half second.
Men's coach Wieslaw Kudja cited
unfair conditions as a contributing fac
tor to the outcome of the race. With
such a close pack of boats, any variance
in circumstance can affect the results.
"I have mixed feelings about the race.
It was a great race but we kind of antic
ipated what was going to happen," he
said. "Sacramento is not a fair course.
The lanes closest to shore have a bit of

an advantage."
Stanford found itself in lane four
afler a second-place showing in a pre
liminary heat against Cal on Saturday.
In describing the influence of this
dimension on the race, Kudja comment
ed that, "Washington is on another
level. But five seconds behind them is a
bunch of very good schools, including
Stanford. All of our boats were in a con
test for second place up until the last
300 meters, and that's when the lane
assignment took its toll."
Amid this frustration was a bright
spot, however. While both the men's
and women's junior varsity squads post
ed fifth place finishes, the up-and-com
ing freshman men's boat powered its
way to a reputable second-place finish,

only a second behind CaL
"We had two solid weeks* ofqweetice â– 
heading into Pac-lOs. I felt we were real
ly focused over the weekend, and that
was reflected in our racing performance
on both Saturday and Sunday," said
freshman oarsman lan Rhodes. Such a
performance has good implications for
Stanford, as much of the future of Stan
ford men's crew sits in that boat.
The final results of the Pac-10 Cham
pionships are ultimately significant in
that they determine the course of the
rest of the season for the Stanford
crews. The season is over for the
women, as a second place finish was nec
essary to continue in the upcoming
