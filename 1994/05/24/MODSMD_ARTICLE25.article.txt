# Poruri closes the book on a legendary four-year run
## Senior now looks to do her talking on pro circuit 
### Rob Ross Senior staff writer 
Laxmi Poruri is an artist. A painter per
haps; a Rembrandt with a racket. Her canvas
is the tennis court; her shows are her compe
titions where the end result is not primarily a
win or loss, but a piece of work, a complete
tennis match.
Perhaps this artistry was most evident at
the NCAA Championships last week, where
after a winning volley or forehand, the com
ments in the press room weren't "What a
great shot!" but "What a beautiful shot!" It is
this difference between the great shots and
the beautiful ones, the ones that seem both
impossible and perfect, that separate Poruri
from most of the rest of the collegiate tennis
world.
Poruri began making her first strokes at
age five. Her family left, their native India
when this future Stanford tennis star was
just a toddler. Their first destination was
Chicago, and from there they traveled to
Northern California. They finally settled fur
ther south, in Claremont, where Poruri
began to make waves in the tennis world.
"I had a fair amount of success [on the
junior level]," she said.
That statement goes beyond modesty to
the realm of sarcasm. Her "fair amount of
success" is like saying Shaquille O'Neal had a
"fair amount of success" his rookie year in
the NBA. At age 14 she was the Girls' 14-and
under singles champion. At 15 she was
named the "Most Promising Junior Player"
by Seventeen Magazine. A year later she was
the National Juniors Singles Champion and
advanced to the second round of the U.S.
Open's main draw.
She returned to the U.S. Open the next
year and, as a senior in high school, posted
wins over Aranxta Sanchez and Monica Seles
on the junior tour. Her artistry was evident,
and she harbored thoughts about turning pro
even before college.
But the Bucoess was premature. "My last
two years as a junior were miserable," she
said. "I had too much success, too much
attention and too much pressure early ... I
like to think of myself as a purist — I love the

game for the game itself. But there were a lot
of distractions that kept me from playing . ..
I realized that the world sucks. Not life, but
the world."
So instead of the road of Steffi Graf and
Jennifer Capriati, Poruri took Route 1 north
to Stanford, her "dream school."
"This was the Julliard of tennis and aca
demics both," she said. "I never considered
another place."
What better place to practice one's art of
tennis than at the Julliard of the sport? It
seemed like the perfect match until she got to
the Farm and realized the distractions that
plagued her toward the end of her junior
career did not disappear, they just took dif
ferent forms.
A self-described "introvert" in high school,
Poruri found the freedom and openness of
her new environment to be an unsettling
experience, to put it mildly.
"I was the biggest headcase" is her more
blunt way of describing a turbulent freshman
year that saw her take over a month off from
tennis, the first such sojourn of her career.
The break did wonders, as she had an "amaz
ing NCAAs" playing No. 5 singles for the Car
dinal. Teamed with then sophomore Heather
Willens, she made it to the semifinals of the
NCAA doubles tournament, thereby garner
ing her first All-American award, the first of
seven she was to win in her four-year career.
Her next three years were ones of constant
improvement. Poruri continued working on
her aggressive style of play, which paid large
dividends. As a sophomore she rose in the
rankings from No. 75 to No. 2, losing to Geor
gia's Shannon McCarthy in the semifinals of
the NCAA singles tournament. Last season
she also finished the season ranked second,
this time behind Florida's Lisa Raymond.
This year, while ranked No. 1 most of the sea
son, Poruri lost in the semifinals of the
NCAA singles tournament, so she will most
likely end her Cardinal career ranked No. 2
behind NCAA Singles Champion Angela Let
tiere.
