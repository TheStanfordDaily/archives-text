# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
Hidden behind the glitz and glamour of
baseball and tennis in Stanford's spring
sports season, track and field has quietly
assembled some of the top competitors in the
nation. Never was this more evident than at
last weekend's Pacific 10 Conference Cham
pionships in Pullman, Wash. Leading the
way were team captains Dave Popejoy and

Louise Watson.
Both the men's and women's teams near
ly doubled their scores from last year's
championships, with the men jumping five
places to fifth and the women's team climb
ing up one spot to seventh. For their efforts
in leading the Cardinal tracksters to such an
improvement, Popejoy and Watson have
been named The Daily's Athletes of the
Week.
Popejoy, a junior, stunned the field in
Pullman over the weekend with a second
place throw. Hurling the hammer a career
best 229 feet, 2 inches, Popejoy tallied the
eighth longest throw in conference history
and the fifth best throw in the collegiate
ranks this year.
His throw also qualified him outright for
the NCAAs, as he surpassed the qualifying
mark by 10 feet.

Watson spearheaded the women's squad
with strong showings in two distance events.
Claiming first place in the 10,000 meters
with a time of 34 minutes, 44.72 seconds, she
earned an NCAA provisional qualifying
mark. She also recorded a third-place finish
in the 5,000 meters with a time of 16:53.43.
Jumping the pond from England to Stan
ford, Watson has been a consistent place
winner for the women's distance runners
this season. The senior proved her versatili
ty by winning the 10,000 meters in her first

time running the event.
"I was a little apprehensive at running the
race," Watson said, "but I sat down with
Gary Stolz (Cardinal distance runner) and
we talked about the strategy of this race.
With a mile to go, the going got tough, but I
maintained my concentration and continued
forward."
