# Furious finish falls short for Cardinal
## Seven points separate cycling from top prize 
### Joseph Hei Staff writer 
Seven points fewer out of a
total of 400: less than a two per
cent margin of defeat. That's
how close the Stanford cycling
team came to winning the
National Collegiate Champi
onship over the weekend.
UC-Davis placed first (394
points), followed by Stanford
(387) and Cal (322). The Cardi
nal's silver medal, its best show
ing ever at nationals, came after
a weekend of both elation and
frustration. Stanford led in the
point totals until the very last
seconds of the race, when a deci
sive sprint by Davis rider Ben
Bourne narrowly snatched away
the gold.
"It came down to the final
sprint of the final event," said
coach Art Walker.
In this last sprint of the
men's criterium on Sunday, grad
student Derek Bouchard-Hall
was the sole Stanford rider left
in front to contend with
Bourne's challenge.
"Bourne took a suicide gam
ble move, which nine times out
of 10 doesn't work," Bouchard-
Hall said. "It worked. I was
boxed in and I couldn't afford to
be the one who pulled the rest of
the pack up to him. The whole
weekend came down to one
rider. There have been six colle
giate nationals, and I've raced in
five of them, but this was one of
the most dramatic finishes
ever."
Bouchard-Hall went on to fin
ish third in the criterium and
scored as the second best men's
rider in the country, narrowly
missing first place by a single
point. The entire weekend
matched the feverish drama of
the last seconds which denied
him that one point. The criteri
um also saw grad student
Takeshi Doi, at the front of the
pack, crash out in the final laps;
Doi's finish might have sealed
Stanford's victory.
Sunday morning before the
criterium the Stanford women

successfully defended their
national championship jersey in
the triple-Ts.
"They not only won, they did
it in a huge way," Walker said.
"The margin of victory was
gigantic."
The dominating women's
squad won on teamwork honed
from months of hard practice.
"I don't think we could have
done any better," senior Nicole
Freedman said. "We worked
great together."
The men pedaled to second
place in their triple-T, a solid
finish for a squad that did not
really specialize in this event.
Besides these triumphs, Stan
ford also suffered other
tragedies this weekend, includ
ing Freedman'B 13th place finish
on Saturday's road race.
"She was in an extremely
good position at the front,"
Walker said, "but she was
knocked off the course by anoth
er rider. The officials denied the
protest we filed over this foul."
Stanford lost 17 points on
this officiating decision alone.
"It was really unfortunate."
Freedman said. "Who knows
what could have happened in the
end with those 17 points."
Other women's finishes on
Saturday were grad student
Cynthia Ferguson at 11th place,
junior Tracy Timms at 15th and
grad Bettina Romer with 21st.
Grad student Lee Fleming
finished eighth in the men's
road race in a break-away
group he instigated. Despite
this strong finish and
Bouchard-Hall's sprint in front
of the pack to take 11th, the
Cardinal men also suffered
their share of mishaps. Doi
crashed late in the race and fel
low grad Dario Falquier left
with a flat tire.
"We were oh so close,"
Bouchard-Hall said. "I think
everyone is looking at what they
could have done better to get us
the victory, but I think we defi
nitely have some things to be
very proud of. It was a great fin
ish for us."
