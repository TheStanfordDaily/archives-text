# Alumna funds house renovation
## Historic location to become center for study of female European authors 
### Karen E. Heywood Staff writer 
Most people probably read Jane
Austen's Pride and Prejudice in high
school or in college, but Stanford alum
na Sandy Lerner has taken her love for
the British author to new heights.
Since selling her $100 million soft
ware company Cisco Systems — a prod
uct of the Stanford University Network,
which she worked to create — Lerner
has devoted a substantial chunk of her
assets to the purchase and renovation of
an English mansion that was once home
to Austen's brother.
She plans to turn the 51-room Chaw
ton House, which is just down the road
from Austen's own residence, into a
center for Jhe study of early European
female authoresses, but the dream is
still far from "being realized, Lerner
said.
"The house is a huge, crumbling
heap. The idea is to restore the house
and grounds to a period of about 1800 —
to a working manor farm, [with] the
study center in the house," she said. "It
is my hope that [scholars] will be able to
come and stay for small numbers of
months at a time and immerse them

selves. There is a certain amount of
karmic attraction there; it's sort of a
shrine."
Lerner graduated from Stanford in
1981 with a master's degree in comput
er science. Her love for Jane Austen was
kindled at Stanford when she saw a BBC
adaptation of Austen's famous novel,
Pride and Prejudice, on television.
The interest soon spread to include
the more than 1,000 female authoresses
published before Austen. "The genre
has been pretty roundly ignored, which
made me mad as hell," she said, "And
there's no real locust of the women's
writing movement other than Jane
Austen."
Part of her plan for the study center
at Chawton House includes computeriz
ing for preservation many of the 1000-
plus volumes in her collection of female
authors of the era, since "in a couple
years they will basically be dust," she
said.
Lerner is quick to point out that the
genre is bigger than most people think:
"In the early 18th century, writing was
the first recognized career for women
other than prostitution; writing was the
only real road to financial indepen
dence," she said.

As a result of her studies, her collec
tion grows by a few books a month and a
few newly discovered authoresses a
year. "It is kind of like finding fossils in
Africa," she said. "It makes me tingle."
Her attempts to secure the property
and begin the project, however, have
been ridden with roadblocks and are still
incomplete.
Almost two years after agreeing to a
buying price for the rundown mansion,
Lerner said, legal bureaucracy is still
getting in the way of her plans. Neither,
she said, were her intentions eagerly
met by Chawton locals: "In England,
feminism is equated with lesbianism;
people shy away from the term."
She has been accused of trying to use
the property to "create a lesbian com
mune," she said, adding that people
there have considered her threatening
because she is "female, young, an Amer
ican, and in [the computer field]. . . .
There's just not a hacker mentality over
there," Lerner said.
Currently, Chawton House is on the
back burner until the deal is finalized,
she said. Her primary focus, with the
Animal Welfare Project, includes build
ing a computer network of animal shel
ters to help people find their pets, and to

place homeless animals, said Lerner.
"I'm very animal oriented," she said.
"The animal thing is a labor of love;
[Chawton House] is a labor of labor."
In any case, Lerner does not down
play the importance of the prospective

study center, nor of the women who
inspired it."It had to be done," she said.
Borrowing from author Virginia Woolf,
another Austen admirer, she added,
"the idea is to finally give women a
'room of their own.' "
