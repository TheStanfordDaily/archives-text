# Concern mounting over loss of billets
## Foreign lit. departments lose four faculty slots 
### Andy Dworkin Senior staff writer 
The recent loss of four slots for foreign
language and literature faculty has raised
grave concerns about the future of foreign

language education at
Stanford.
The School of Humani
ties and Sciences recently
recalled 12 tenure-track
faculty billets, four each
from the humanities, the
social sciences and the nat
ural sciences, said John
Etchemendy, senior asso
ciate dean for Humanities
and Sciences.

The four humanities billets were all
taken from foreign literature departments
— one each from the French and Italian,
Spanish and Portuguese, German Studies
and Slavic Languages and Literatures de
partments.

Foreign literature departments — some
of Stanford's smallest with only 42 billets
including the Asian Languages Depart
ment — had their billets recalled because of
low student enrollment in foreign litera
ture classes, Etchemendy said.
But some professors say this year's billet
cuts are just the most recent expression of
a slow erosion of University support for for
eign language study. These professors
point out that foreign literature classes are
likely to be small, and perhaps should be.
And they cite past faculty cuts, recent
changes in overseas studies programs and a
pro-English climate at Stanford as other
components of the same large problem: a
lack of commitment to the study of foreign
cultures at Stanford.
Few students, few teachers

we would get that billet back are
minute."
While they admit that their
enrollments are low, many for
eign literature professors say that
their enrollments should be lower
than those in, say, history classes
and add that their enrollments
also compare well with foreign
language departments at other
schools.
For example, Spanish and Por

ences the ability to reallocate the
slots to exceptional or much
needed faculty when they become
available.
"What we are trying to do in
the dean's office ... is to increase
the flexibility of resources within
the school," said John Shoven,
dean of the School of Humanities
and Sciences. "The willingness to
make cuts and reallocate those
billets was quite important and
effective in doing as well as we
did in this budgetary environ
ment."
Shoven pointed out that,
despite current University-wide
budget cuts, the total size of the
H&S faculty is not shrinking. The
recall, he said, will give him 12
discretionary billets. When he
took over as H&S dean last year,
Shoven said he had no discre
tionary billets.
That all four humanities bil
lets were recalled from foreign lit
erature departments is not a coin
cidence, Etchemendy said.
Indeed, he said, the departments
which lost billets in the social and
natural sciences were also care
fully chosen.
"In each of those clusters, the
cuts were not across the board.
They were targeted. In the case of
the humanities, they were
focused on the languages," he
said.
The decision about which
departments to target was based
"on the strengths of the various
departments," including how
many students enroll in the
departments' classes, he said.
Student/faculty ratios are
small in foreign literature classes,
especially when compared with
larger departments such as
English or history.
"We wouldn't be doing our
duty to you, the students, to keep
a full professor who teaches
maybe eight students throughout
the year," Etchemendy said. "If
we didn't do this kind of cutting,
the students at Stanford would be
justified to revolt."
Shoven added that the
removed billets will be available
to any H&S departments which
need them, including language
departments. But, he pointed out,
the "primary determinant" for
getting one of the recalled billets
"will be enrollments, especially
undergraduate enrollments."
German Studies Department
Chair Theodore Andersson, how
ever, said that the possibility of
reclaiming his lost billet is "high
ly theoretical. . . the chances that

tuguese Department Chair
Michael Predmore said his
"undergraduate enrollments are
just as good and our Ph.D. pro
duction is just as good" as other
top-10 Spanish programs.
Comparing foreign language
departments with humanities
giants like history and English "is
such an unfair comparison," said
Lazar Fleishman, chair of the
Slavic Department.
Students raised in North
America, such as most Stanford
students, are more interested in
history and English than foreign
literature, Predmore said.
Etchemendy said that the
dean's office tries to compare
departments with their counter
parts at other universities, but
said that it is hard to obtain and
interpret figures i enrollment
and faculty from c er schools.
But Ralph Heste*, chair of the
French and Italian Department,
said the very nature of many of
the classes his department offers
leads to small enrollments.
"How many students do you
expect to take Russian literature
in Russian? One hundred?" Hes
ter asked. "It's perfectly normal,
in an upper-division literature
course, that they're small."
Etchemendy agreed that some
classes — especially language
classes — should be small. But, he
said, that's no excuse for tiny
enrollments across the board.
Classes with 200 students "are
not any more impossible in Ger
man studies than they are in psy
chology," he said.
On the brink
This year's billet cuts are only
a portion of what has foreign lit
erature professors worried. Over
the past decade, professors say,

the University has slowly chipped
away the support it provides for
eign language and literature
departments, pushing the pro
grams close to the edge of aca
demic disaster.
Over the past five to 10 years,
for example, the Departments of
French and Italian, German,
Spanish and Portuguese and
Slavic Languages have lost a com
bined eight billets for tenure-

students, to keep a full professor who
teaches maybe eight students throughout
the year.'

track faculty — an approximate
20-percent drop in the number of
faculty billets.
Go back 14 years, Predmore
said, and the number of Spanish
and Portuguese billets drops two
more, from 10 to seven.
Since these are some of Stan
ford's smallest departments any
way, professors say, the cuts are
very severe as a proportion of
their total size.
"We're continually cutting
back," Hester said. "We're all
being mowed under by these
depletions in billets, these elimi
nations in billets."
Etchemendy agreed that there
is "some justification for the com
plaint" that departmental sup
port has been slowly eroded.
Several department chairs said
they fear any further cuts would
hurt their ability to recruit top
graduate students or faculty
members.
Class sizes could also be fur
ther hurt by the cuts, which
might start a dangerous cycle.
"If you want to increase enroll
ment, which the dean wants us to
do, you have to have a critical
mass of professors," Predmore
said. "We're just teetering on the
brink."
Dropping numbers of faculty
can also be a real concern if there
are too few professors in a depart
ment to offer all the classes neces
sary for majors or graduate
degree programs, Etchemendy
said.
"We're right at the edge in
some cases," Etchemendy said. "I
think Italian is an example. There
are currently three Italianists,
and at a certain point — we may
be there, I don't know — you
can't offer a full Ph.D. in Italian
or a bachelor's degree.

Now, most chairs said, Stan
ford's foreign literature depart
ments are smaller than the
departments at other schools
with which Stanford competes.
And, Hester said, with most uni
versities "there's a clear relation
ship between the size of the facul
ty and the quality of the pro
gram."
Even the Asian Languages
Department — which has not had
any billets cut recently — is
smaller than its counterparts at
Harvard, Yale, UC-Berkeley and
University of Chicago, according
to Asian Languages Department
Chair Makoto Ueda.
"We have been operating on
very limited human resources for
a long time now. I believe we are
one of the smallest departments
in terms of faculty," Ueda said.
"We have been trying to impress
the administration of this fact,
but this is not a very opportune
time."
Etchemendy, however, pointed
out that Stanford is "a very spe
cial institution" in that all its
departments tend to be smaller
than their counterparts. The Psy
chology Department, for example,
is half the size of its peer at UC-
Berkeley, he said.
"We do more with less
resources and we have been for 20

department.
"Salamanca offered programs
that so well complemented our
own," he said. "It was a small pro
gram — it averaged 15 a year —
but it was very valuable."
Hester said an overseas pro
gram in Tours, France, that
allowed students to attend for
three quarters was replaced with
a program in Paris that only lets a
few students stay all year. The
campus in Florence, Italy, that
used to run three quarters has
become a "shoestring program"
that runs for two quarters only,
he said.
Since study abroad can both
attract new students and supply
returning students to the foreign
literature departments, weaker
overseas campuses mean less stu
dents in foreign language and lit
erature classes at Stanford, pro
fessors say.
Russell Berman, director of
overseas studies, told the last
Faculty Senate meeting that the
process also works in reverse: low
foreign literature enrollments
mean low attendance at foreign
campuses.
"Less teaching about Russia
(means) less students going to
Moscow," Berman said. "So there
is a kind of foreshortening, I
think, of the horizon of higher

years," Etchemendy said. "My
reaction has to be that if Wiscon
sin has 50,000 students ... we
have to have better faculty. . . .
We're never going to be able to
hire the number of bodies that a
Wisconsin can hire."
And, despite their small faculty
size, Etchemendy said, Stanford's
foreign literature departments
are now among the top in the
country in quality.
Further headaches
Other trends in foreign lan
guage education at Stanford also
disturb some professors. For
example, recent changes in the
foreign literature departments
and overseas studies program
may have weakened both.
Predmore complained that the
closure of Stanford's popular pro
gram in Salamanca, Spain about
three years ago has damaged his

education."
Both Predmore and Hester
also complained about the recent
administrative merger between
the French and Italian and Span
ish and Portuguese Departments.
The merger, Predmore said, has
left too few staff members bur
dened with too much work.
Also, several professors said
English — not any foreign tongue
— seems to be the only acceptable
language at Stanford. Hester
pointed out that students com
pleting dissertations in foreign
language departments cannot
write their papers in the foreign
language but must write them in
English.
"At universities or colleges
where languages really work . . .
you have people who speak up and
protect them," Hester said. "We
proclaim our internationalism
but we are very parochial."

A stronger future?
Despite the eroding resources
of the foreign language depart
ments, there are a few trends that
provide hope for a stronger
future.
One potential boon is a move to
combine all the departments
under one administrative struc
ture. Many hope the combination
will give the languages more
power as a unit to increase enroll
ments and fight cuts.
"We're hoping the reorganiza
tion will revitalize the languages
and the study of literature and
culture at Stanford,"
Etchemendy said. "There's noth
ing I would like to see more than
enrollments that are so large that
the classes are bursting at the
seams."
Many of the chairs, too,
expressed hope that the merger
would improve their collective lot,
although some warned that the
individual departments must be
sure to keep their individuality or
disaster could follow.
"We have a lot of apprehension
about the prog "am," Ueda said,
explaining that there are differ
ences in languages and cultures
— especially between Western
and Eastern languages — that
must be respected for the combi
nation to succeed.
Several professors also men
tioned the possibility of branch
ing out into new subject areas.
Hester, for example, said that
"foreign languages thrive when
they are connected to the social
sciences," and suggested combin
ing the study of foreign languages
and literatures with classes in
political science, history and
other subjects to increase enroll
ments.
Etchemendy said he hopes the
larger, combined department
could raise enrollments by offer
ing new Cultures, Ideas and Val
ues classes or courses that fulfill
distribution requirements.
And Shoven mentioned two
newly designed undergraduate
majors in comparative literature
as likely sources for increased
enrollments.
Finally, the Commission on
Undergraduate Education has
shown great interest in
strengthening the foreign lan
guage requirement and Univer
sity President Gerhard Casper
has spoken publicly in favor of
studying another culture in
depth.
"I hope the Commission on
Undergraduate Education comes
out with a recommendation for an
increased language requirement,"
Etchemendy said. "I think that's
an important part of an under
graduate education."

language and literature faculty has raised
grave concerns about the future of foreign

language education at
Stanford.

Comparing foreign language
departments with humanities
giants like history and English "is
such an unfair comparison," said
Lazar Fleishman, chair of the
Slavic Department.
Students raised in North
America, such as most Stanford
students, are more interested in
history and English than foreign
literature, Predmore said.
Etchemendy said that the
dean's office tries to compare
departments with their counter
parts at other universities, but
said that it is hard to obtain and
interpret figures i enrollment
and faculty from c er schools.
But Ralph Heste*, chair of the
French and Italian Department,
said the very nature of many of
the classes his department offers
leads to small enrollments.
"How many students do you
expect to take Russian literature
in Russian? One hundred?" Hes
ter asked. "It's perfectly normal,
in an upper-division literature
course, that they're small."
Etchemendy agreed that some
classes — especially language
classes — should be small. But, he
said, that's no excuse for tiny
enrollments across the board.
Classes with 200 students "are
not any more impossible in Ger
man studies than they are in psy
chology," he said.
On the brink
This year's billet cuts are only
a portion of what has foreign lit
erature professors worried. Over
the past decade, professors say,

the University has slowly chipped
away the support it provides for
eign language and literature
departments, pushing the pro
grams close to the edge of aca
demic disaster.
Over the past five to 10 years,
for example, the Departments of
French and Italian, German,
Spanish and Portuguese and
Slavic Languages have lost a com
bined eight billets for tenure-

'We wouldn't be doing our duty to you, the
students, to keep a full professor who
teaches maybe eight students throughout
the year.'

track faculty — an approximate
20-percent drop in the number of
faculty billets.
Go back 14 years, Predmore
said, and the number of Spanish
and Portuguese billets drops two
more, from 10 to seven.
Since these are some of Stan
ford's smallest departments any
way, professors say, the cuts are
very severe as a proportion of
their total size.
"We're continually cutting
back," Hester said. "We're all
being mowed under by these
depletions in billets, these elimi
nations in billets."
Etchemendy agreed that there
is "some justification for the com
plaint" that departmental sup
port has been slowly eroded.
Several department chairs said
they fear any further cuts would
hurt their ability to recruit top
graduate students or faculty
members.
Class sizes could also be fur
ther hurt by the cuts, which
might start a dangerous cycle.
"If you want to increase enroll
ment, which the dean wants us to
do, you have to have a critical
mass of professors," Predmore
said. "We're just teetering on the
brink."
Dropping numbers of faculty
can also be a real concern if there
are too few professors in a depart
ment to offer all the classes neces
sary for majors or graduate
degree programs, Etchemendy
said.
"We're right at the edge in
some cases," Etchemendy said. "I
think Italian is an example. There
are currently three Italianists,
and at a certain point — we may
be there, I don't know — you
can't offer a full Ph.D. in Italian
or a bachelor's degree.

Now, most chairs said, Stan
ford's foreign literature depart
ments are smaller than the
departments at other schools
with which Stanford competes.
And, Hester said, with most uni
versities "there's a clear relation
ship between the size of the facul
ty and the quality of the pro
gram."
Even the Asian Languages
Department — which has not had
any billets cut recently — is
smaller than its counterparts at
Harvard, Yale, UC-Berkeley and
University of Chicago, according
to Asian Languages Department
Chair Makoto Ueda.
"We have been operating on
very limited human resources for
a long time now. I believe we are
one of the smallest departments
in terms of faculty," Ueda said.
"We have been trying to impress
the administration of this fact,
but this is not a very opportune
time."
Etchemendy, however, pointed
out that Stanford is "a very spe
cial institution" in that all its
departments tend to be smaller
than their counterparts. The Psy
chology Department, for example,
is half the size of its peer at UC-
Berkeley, he said.
"We do more with less
resources and we have been for 20

department.
"Salamanca offered programs
that so well complemented our
own," he said. "It was a small pro
gram — it averaged 15 a year —
but it was very valuable."
Hester said an overseas pro
gram in Tours, France, that
allowed students to attend for
three quarters was replaced with
a program in Paris that only lets a
few students stay all year. The
campus in Florence, Italy, that
used to run three quarters has
become a "shoestring program"
that runs for two quarters only,
he said.
Since study abroad can both
attract new students and supply
returning students to the foreign
literature departments, weaker
overseas campuses mean less stu
dents in foreign language and lit
erature classes at Stanford, pro
fessors say.
Russell Berman, director of
overseas studies, told the last
Faculty Senate meeting that the
process also works in reverse: low
foreign literature enrollments
mean low attendance at foreign
campuses.
"Less teaching about Russia
(means) less students going to
Moscow," Berman said. "So there
is a kind of foreshortening, I
think, of the horizon of higher

years," Etchemendy said. "My
reaction has to be that if Wiscon
sin has 50,000 students ... we
have to have better faculty. . . .
We're never going to be able to
hire the number of bodies that a
Wisconsin can hire."
And, despite their small faculty
size, Etchemendy said, Stanford's
foreign literature departments
are now among the top in the
country in quality.
Further headaches
Other trends in foreign lan
guage education at Stanford also
disturb some professors. For
example, recent changes in the
foreign literature departments
and overseas studies program
may have weakened both.
Predmore complained that the
closure of Stanford's popular pro
gram in Salamanca, Spain about
three years ago has damaged his

education."
Both Predmore and Hester
also complained about the recent
administrative merger between
the French and Italian and Span
ish and Portuguese Departments.
The merger, Predmore said, has
left too few staff members bur
dened with too much work.
Also, several professors said
English — not any foreign tongue
— seems to be the only acceptable
language at Stanford. Hester
pointed out that students com
pleting dissertations in foreign
language departments cannot
write their papers in the foreign
language but must write them in
English.
"At universities or colleges
where languages really work . . .
you have people who speak up and
protect them," Hester said. "We
proclaim our internationalism
but we are very parochial."

A stronger future?
Despite the eroding resources
of the foreign language depart
ments, there are a few trends that
provide hope for a stronger
future.
One potential boon is a move to
combine all the departments
under one administrative struc
ture. Many hope the combination
will give the languages more
power as a unit to increase enroll
ments and fight cuts.
"We're hoping the reorganiza
tion will revitalize the languages
and the study of literature and
culture at Stanford,"
Etchemendy said. "There's noth
ing I would like to see more than
enrollments that are so large that
the classes are bursting at the
seams."
Many of the chairs, too,
expressed hope that the merger
would improve their collective lot,
although some warned that the
individual departments must be
sure to keep their individuality or
disaster could follow.
"We have a lot of apprehension
about the prog "am," Ueda said,
explaining that there are differ
ences in languages and cultures
— especially between Western
and Eastern languages — that
must be respected for the combi
nation to succeed.
Several professors also men
tioned the possibility of branch
ing out into new subject areas.
Hester, for example, said that
"foreign languages thrive when
they are connected to the social
sciences," and suggested combin
ing the study of foreign languages
and literatures with classes in
political science, history and
other subjects to increase enroll
ments.
Etchemendy said he hopes the
larger, combined department
could raise enrollments by offer
ing new Cultures, Ideas and Val
ues classes or courses that fulfill
distribution requirements.
And Shoven mentioned two
newly designed undergraduate
majors in comparative literature
as likely sources for increased
enrollments.
Finally, the Commission on
Undergraduate Education has
shown great interest in
strengthening the foreign lan
guage requirement and Univer
sity President Gerhard Casper
has spoken publicly in favor of
studying another culture in
depth.
"I hope the Commission on
Undergraduate Education comes
out with a recommendation for an
increased language requirement,"
Etchemendy said. "I think that's
an important part of an under
graduate education."
The recent loss of four slots for foreign
language and literature faculty has raised
grave concerns about the future of foreign

language education at
Stanford.
The School of Humani
ties and Sciences recently
recalled 12 tenure-track
faculty billets, four each
from the humanities, the
social sciences and the nat
ural sciences, said John
Etchemendy, senior asso
ciate dean for Humanities
and Sciences.

The four humanities billets were all
taken from foreign literature departments
— one each from the French and Italian,
Spanish and Portuguese, German Studies
and Slavic Languages and Literatures de
partments.

Foreign literature departments — some
of Stanford's smallest with only 42 billets
including the Asian Languages Depart
ment — had their billets recalled because of
low student enrollment in foreign litera
ture classes, Etchemendy said.
But some professors say this year's billet
cuts are just the most recent expression of
a slow erosion of University support for for
eign language study. These professors
point out that foreign literature classes are
likely to be small, and perhaps should be.
And they cite past faculty cuts, recent
changes in overseas studies programs and a
pro-English climate at Stanford as other
components of the same large problem: a
lack of commitment to the study of foreign
cultures at Stanford.
Few students, few teachers
The recall of billets about three weeks
ago gives the dean of Humanities and Sci-

we would get that billet back are
minute."
While they admit that their
enrollments are low, many for
eign literature professors say that
their enrollments should be lower
than those in, say, history classes
and add that their enrollments
also compare well with foreign
language departments at other
schools.
For example, Spanish and Por

ences the ability to reallocate the
slots to exceptional or much
needed faculty when they become
available.
"What we are trying to do in
the dean's office ... is to increase
the flexibility of resources within
the school," said John Shoven,
dean of the School of Humanities
and Sciences. "The willingness to
make cuts and reallocate those
billets was quite important and
effective in doing as well as we
did in this budgetary environ
ment."
Shoven pointed out that,
despite current University-wide
budget cuts, the total size of the
H&S faculty is not shrinking. The
recall, he said, will give him 12
discretionary billets. When he
took over as H&S dean last year,
Shoven said he had no discre
tionary billets.
That all four humanities bil
lets were recalled from foreign lit
erature departments is not a coin
cidence, Etchemendy said.
Indeed, he said, the departments
which lost billets in the social and
natural sciences were also care
fully chosen.
"In each of those clusters, the
cuts were not across the board.
They were targeted. In the case of
the humanities, they were
focused on the languages," he
said.
The decision about which
departments to target was based
"on the strengths of the various
departments," including how
many students enroll in the
departments' classes, he said.
Student/faculty ratios are
small in foreign literature classes,
especially when compared with
larger departments such as
English or history.
"We wouldn't be doing our
duty to you, the students, to keep
a full professor who teaches
maybe eight students throughout
the year," Etchemendy said. "If
we didn't do this kind of cutting,
the students at Stanford would be
justified to revolt."
Shoven added that the
removed billets will be available
to any H&S departments which
need them, including language
departments. But, he pointed out,
the "primary determinant" for
getting one of the recalled billets
"will be enrollments, especially
undergraduate enrollments."

be there, I don't know — you
can't offer a full Ph.D. in Italian
or a bachelor's degree.

Now, most chairs said, Stan
ford's foreign literature depart
ments are smaller than the
departments at other schools
with which Stanford competes.
And, Hester said, with most uni
versities "there's a clear relation
ship between the size of the facul
ty and the quality of the pro
gram."
Even the Asian Languages
Department — which has not had
any billets cut recently — is
smaller than its counterparts at
Harvard, Yale, UC-Berkeley and
University of Chicago, according
to Asian Languages Department
Chair Makoto Ueda.
"We have been operating on
very limited human resources for
a long time now. I believe we are
one of the smallest departments
in terms of faculty," Ueda said.
"We have been trying to impress
the administration of this fact,
but this is not a very opportune
time."
Etchemendy, however, pointed
out that Stanford is "a very spe
cial institution" in that all its
departments tend to be smaller
than their counterparts. The Psy
chology Department, for example,
is half the size of its peer at UC-
Berkeley, he said.
"We do more with less
resources and we have been for 20

department.
"Salamanca offered programs
that so well complemented our
own," he said. "It was a small pro
gram — it averaged 15 a year —
but it was very valuable."
Hester said an overseas pro
gram in Tours, France, that
allowed students to attend for
three quarters was replaced with
a program in Paris that only lets a
few students stay all year. The
campus in Florence, Italy, that
used to run three quarters has
become a "shoestring program"
that runs for two quarters only,
he said.
Since study abroad can both
attract new students and supply
returning students to the foreign
literature departments, weaker
overseas campuses mean less stu
dents in foreign language and lit
erature classes at Stanford, pro
fessors say.
Russell Berman, director of
overseas studies, told the last
Faculty Senate meeting that the
process also works in reverse: low
foreign literature enrollments
mean low attendance at foreign
campuses.
"Less teaching about Russia
(means) less students going to
Moscow," Berman said. "So there

years," Etchemendy said. "My
reaction has to be that if Wiscon
sin has 50,000 students ... we
have to have better faculty. . . .
We're never going to be able to
hire the number of bodies that a
Wisconsin can hire."
And, despite their small faculty
size, Etchemendy said, Stanford's
foreign literature departments
are now among the top in the
country in quality.
Further headaches
Other trends in foreign lan
guage education at Stanford also
disturb some professors. For
example, recent changes in the
foreign literature departments
and overseas studies program
may have weakened both.
Predmore complained that the
closure of Stanford's popular pro
gram in Salamanca, Spain about
three years ago has damaged his

education."
Both Predmore and Hester
also complained about the recent
administrative merger between
the French and Italian and Span
ish and Portuguese Departments.
The merger, Predmore said, has
left too few staff members bur
dened with too much work.
Also, several professors said
English — not any foreign tongue
— seems to be the only acceptable
language at Stanford. Hester
pointed out that students com
pleting dissertations in foreign
language departments cannot
write their papers in the foreign
language but must write them in
English.
"At universities or colleges
where languages really work . . .
you have people who speak up and
protect them," Hester said. "We
proclaim our internationalism
but we are very parochial."

A stronger future?
Despite the eroding resources
of the foreign language depart
ments, there are a few trends that
provide hope for a stronger
future.
One potential boon is a move to
combine all the departments
under one administrative struc
ture. Many hope the combination
will give the languages more
power as a unit to increase enroll
ments and fight cuts.
"We're hoping the reorganiza
tion will revitalize the languages
and the study of literature and
culture at Stanford,"
Etchemendy said. "There's noth
ing I would like to see more than
enrollments that are so large that
the classes are bursting at the
seams."
Many of the chairs, too,
expressed hope that the merger
would improve their collective lot,
although some warned that the
individual departments must be
sure to keep their individuality or
disaster could follow.
"We have a lot of apprehension
about the prog "am," Ueda said,
explaining that there are differ
ences in languages and cultures
— especially between Western
and Eastern languages — that
must be respected for the combi
nation to succeed.
Several professors also men
tioned the possibility of branch
ing out into new subject areas.
Hester, for example, said that
"foreign languages thrive when
they are connected to the social
sciences," and suggested combin
ing the study of foreign languages
and literatures with classes in
political science, history and
other subjects to increase enroll
ments.
Etchemendy said he hopes the
larger, combined department
could raise enrollments by offer
ing new Cultures, Ideas and Val
ues classes or courses that fulfill
distribution requirements.
And Shoven mentioned two
newly designed undergraduate
majors in comparative literature
as likely sources for increased
enrollments.
Finally, the Commission on
Undergraduate Education has
shown great interest in
strengthening the foreign lan
guage requirement and Univer
sity President Gerhard Casper
has spoken publicly in favor of
studying another culture in
depth.
"I hope the Commission on
Undergraduate Education comes
out with a recommendation for an
increased language requirement,"
Etchemendy said. "I think that's
an important part of an under
graduate education."
The recent loss of four slots for foreign
language and literature faculty has raised
grave concerns about the future of foreign

language education at
Stanford.
The School of Humani
ties and Sciences recently
recalled 12 tenure-track
faculty billets, four each
from the humanities, the
social sciences and the nat
ural sciences, said John
Etchemendy, senior asso
ciate dean for Humanities
and Sciences.

The four humanities billets were all
taken from foreign literature departments
— one each from the French and Italian,
Spanish and Portuguese, German Studies
and Slavic Languages and Literatures de
partments.

Foreign literature departments — some
of Stanford's smallest with only 42 billets
including the Asian Languages Depart
ment — had their billets recalled because of
low student enrollment in foreign litera
ture classes, Etchemendy said.
But some professors say this year's billet
cuts are just the most recent expression of
a slow erosion of University support for for
eign language study. These professors
point out that foreign literature classes are
likely to be small, and perhaps should be.
And they cite past faculty cuts, recent
changes in overseas studies programs and a
pro-English climate at Stanford as other
components of the same large problem: a
lack of commitment to the study of foreign
cultures at Stanford.
Few students, few teachers
The recall of billets about three weeks
ago gives the dean of Humanities and Sci-


Shoven
we would get that billet back are
minute."
While they admit that their
enrollments are low, many for
eign literature professors say that
their enrollments should be lower
than those in, say, history classes
and add that their enrollments
also compare well with foreign
language departments at other
schools.
For example, Spanish and Por

ences the ability to reallocate the
slots to exceptional or much
needed faculty when they become
available.
"What we are trying to do in
the dean's office ... is to increase
the flexibility of resources within
the school," said John Shoven,
dean of the School of Humanities
and Sciences. "The willingness to
make cuts and reallocate those
billets was quite important and
effective in doing as well as we
did in this budgetary environ
ment."
Shoven pointed out that,
despite current University-wide
budget cuts, the total size of the
H&S faculty is not shrinking. The
recall, he said, will give him 12
discretionary billets. When he
took over as H&S dean last year,
Shoven said he had no discre
tionary billets.
That all four humanities bil
lets were recalled from foreign lit
erature departments is not a coin
cidence, Etchemendy said.
Indeed, he said, the departments
which lost billets in the social and
natural sciences were also care
fully chosen.
"In each of those clusters, the
cuts were not across the board.
They were targeted. In the case of
the humanities, they were
focused on the languages," he
said.
The decision about which
departments to target was based
"on the strengths of the various
departments," including how
many students enroll in the
departments' classes, he said.
Student/faculty ratios are
small in foreign literature classes,
especially when compared with
larger departments such as
English or history.
"We wouldn't be doing our
duty to you, the students, to keep
a full professor who teaches
maybe eight students throughout
the year," Etchemendy said. "If
we didn't do this kind of cutting,
the students at Stanford would be
justified to revolt."
Shoven added that the
removed billets will be available
to any H&S departments which
need them, including language
departments. But, he pointed out,
the "primary determinant" for
getting one of the recalled billets
"will be enrollments, especially
undergraduate enrollments."
German Studies Department
Chair Theodore Andersson, how
ever, said that the possibility of
reclaiming his lost billet is "high
ly theoretical. . . the chances that

tuguese Department Chair
Michael Predmore said his
"undergraduate enrollments are
just as good and our Ph.D. pro
duction is just as good" as other
top-10 Spanish programs.
Comparing foreign language
departments with humanities
giants like history and English "is
such an unfair comparison," said
Lazar Fleishman, chair of the
Slavic Department.
Students raised in North
America, such as most Stanford
students, are more interested in
history and English than foreign
literature, Predmore said.
Etchemendy said that the
dean's office tries to compare
departments with their counter
parts at other universities, but
said that it is hard to obtain and
interpret figures i enrollment
and faculty from c er schools.
But Ralph Heste*, chair of the
French and Italian Department,
said the very nature of many of
the classes his department offers
leads to small enrollments.
"How many students do you
expect to take Russian literature
in Russian? One hundred?" Hes
ter asked. "It's perfectly normal,
in an upper-division literature
course, that they're small."
Etchemendy agreed that some
classes — especially language
classes — should be small. But, he
said, that's no excuse for tiny
enrollments across the board.
Classes with 200 students "are
not any more impossible in Ger
man studies than they are in psy
chology," he said.
On the brink
This year's billet cuts are only
a portion of what has foreign lit
erature professors worried. Over
the past decade, professors say,

the University has slowly chipped
away the support it provides for
eign language and literature
departments, pushing the pro
grams close to the edge of aca
demic disaster.
Over the past five to 10 years,
for example, the Departments of
French and Italian, German,
Spanish and Portuguese and
Slavic Languages have lost a com
bined eight billets for tenure-

'We wouldn't be doing our duty to you, the
students, to keep a full professor who
teaches maybe eight students throughout
the year.'

track faculty — an approximate
20-percent drop in the number of
faculty billets.
Go back 14 years, Predmore
said, and the number of Spanish
and Portuguese billets drops two
more, from 10 to seven.
Since these are some of Stan
ford's smallest departments any
way, professors say, the cuts are
very severe as a proportion of
their total size.
"We're continually cutting
back," Hester said. "We're all
being mowed under by these
depletions in billets, these elimi
nations in billets."
Etchemendy agreed that there
is "some justification for the com
plaint" that departmental sup
port has been slowly eroded.
Several department chairs said
they fear any further cuts would
hurt their ability to recruit top
graduate students or faculty
members.
Class sizes could also be fur
ther hurt by the cuts, which
might start a dangerous cycle.
"If you want to increase enroll
ment, which the dean wants us to
do, you have to have a critical
mass of professors," Predmore
said. "We're just teetering on the
brink."
Dropping numbers of faculty
can also be a real concern if there
are too few professors in a depart
ment to offer all the classes neces
sary for majors or graduate
degree programs, Etchemendy
said.
"We're right at the edge in
some cases," Etchemendy said. "I
think Italian is an example. There
are currently three Italianists,
and at a certain point — we may
be there, I don't know — you
can't offer a full Ph.D. in Italian

language departments cannot
write their papers in the foreign
language but must write them in
English.
"At universities or colleges
where languages really work . . .
you have people who speak up and
protect them," Hester said. "We
proclaim our internationalism
but we are very parochial."

A stronger future?
Despite the eroding resources
of the foreign language depart
ments, there are a few trends that
provide hope for a stronger
future.
One potential boon is a move to
combine all the departments
under one administrative struc
ture. Many hope the combination
will give the languages more
power as a unit to increase enroll
ments and fight cuts.
"We're hoping the reorganiza
tion will revitalize the languages
and the study of literature and
culture at Stanford,"
Etchemendy said. "There's noth
ing I would like to see more than
enrollments that are so large that
the classes are bursting at the
seams."
Many of the chairs, too,
expressed hope that the merger
would improve their collective lot,
although some warned that the
individual departments must be
sure to keep their individuality or
disaster could follow.
"We have a lot of apprehension
about the prog "am," Ueda said,
explaining that there are differ
ences in languages and cultures
— especially between Western
and Eastern languages — that
must be respected for the combi
nation to succeed.
Several professors also men
tioned the possibility of branch
ing out into new subject areas.
Hester, for example, said that
"foreign languages thrive when
they are connected to the social
sciences," and suggested combin
ing the study of foreign languages
and literatures with classes in
political science, history and
other subjects to increase enroll
ments.
Etchemendy said he hopes the
larger, combined department
could raise enrollments by offer
ing new Cultures, Ideas and Val
ues classes or courses that fulfill
distribution requirements.
And Shoven mentioned two
newly designed undergraduate
majors in comparative literature
as likely sources for increased
enrollments.
Finally, the Commission on
Undergraduate Education has
shown great interest in
strengthening the foreign lan
guage requirement and Univer
sity President Gerhard Casper
has spoken publicly in favor of
studying another culture in
depth.
"I hope the Commission on
Undergraduate Education comes
out with a recommendation for an
increased language requirement,"
Etchemendy said. "I think that's
an important part of an under
graduate education."
