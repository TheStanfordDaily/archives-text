# Concern mounting over loss of billets
## Foreign lit. departments lose four faculty slots 
### Andy Dworkin Senior staff writer 
The recent loss of four slots for foreign
language and literature faculty has raised
grave concerns about the future of foreign

language education at
Stanford.
The School of Humani
ties and Sciences recently
recalled 12 tenure-track
faculty billets, four each
from the humanities, the
social sciences and the nat
ural sciences, said John
Etchemendy, senior asso
ciate dean for Humanities
and Sciences.

The four humanities billets were all
taken from foreign literature departments
— one each from the French and Italian,
Spanish and Portuguese, German Studies
and Slavic Languages and Literatures de
partments.

Foreign literature departments — some
of Stanford's smallest with only 42 billets
including the Asian Languages Depart
ment — had their billets recalled because of
low student enrollment in foreign litera
ture classes, Etchemendy said.
But some professors say this year's billet
cuts are just the most recent expression of
a slow erosion of University support for for
eign language study. These professors
point out that foreign literature classes are
likely to be small, and perhaps should be.
And they cite past faculty cuts, recent
changes in overseas studies programs and a
pro-English climate at Stanford as other
components of the same large problem: a
lack of commitment to the study of foreign
cultures at Stanford.
Few students, few teachers
