# Communities demand action against vandals
## 8th student involved 
### Burt Herman Editorial Staff 
As the investigation into last week's van
dalism of the "Gay Liberation" sculpture
revealed yesterday an eighth student's in
volvement, members of the Stanford com
munity voiced their concerns and called for
swift action against students involved.
Judicial Affairs Officer Sally Cole con
firmed that she has now met with eight stu
dents involved in the incident, but would
not disclose the identity of the newly impli
cated individual.
Charges are still pending in the case
against the athletes, Santa Clara County
Deputy District Attorney Kaiyn Sinunu
said. Police said last week that charges
would be filed yesterday, but are
now continuing to "tie up some
loose ends," Stanford Police Capt.
Raoul Niemeyer said.
The University is also working
to conclude its investigation. "We
are working incredibly hard to fig
ure out exactly what happened,"
Dean of Students Michael Jackson
said at yesterday's meeting. "I have
a sense there is more to this than
meets the eye."
The marathon meeting in the
Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Commu
nity Center focused on the continu
ing concerns of the gay community.
Over 60 people packed the swel
tering Fire Truck House for three
hours to discuss the incident with
an audience which included Jack
son and Assoc. Director of Athletics
Tom Beckett.
While some have dismissed the
incident as a college prank, those
who assembled for the emotionally
draining meeting strongly felt that
deeper homophobic motivation lay
behind the vandalism.
"It was not a mistake, and call
ing it a mistake is offensive," grad
uate student Tracy Schmidt said to
applause. "It's a real issue about
our life and our community."

"I just want to feel safe — that's
all," one student said.
And harsh measures were
demanded by the crowd. "The Uni
versity needs to take action against
these students," senior Troy Erick
son said. "I don't feel a stern
enough statement has been said."
Beckett said, "We're wrong if
we're creating a climate that makes
you afraid to be a member of this
community."
Some said they feel that the
recent incident is only an indicator
of deeper systemic problems within
the Stanford community. "Is the
administration going to make the
leap between this act and what hap
pened 22 days ago at Flicks?" senior
Nicole Sanchez said, drawing the
loudest applause in referring to an
incident last month when students
allegedly shouted racial slurs at a
screening of "No Grapes."
The hurt to the gay, lesbian and
bisexual community runs far deep
er than the gouges in the white
coating of the bronze figures, said
many who attended the meeting.
"This is not about the statue —
it's about what effect this has on
our lives," one student said.
Baseball players Dusty Allen,
Robert Gardner, Todd Laßocca
and Brendan Sullivan, football
team members Mark Butterfield
and Jason White and wrestler
Thomas Irwin were arrested and

later released last week.
The baseball players arrested are
not practicing for NCAA regionals
which start Friday, Beckett said.
Many at the meeting were disap
pointed that the Santa Clara Dis
trict Attorney's office will not be
charging the athletes under hate
crime statutes.
The California penal code states
that a person can be charged with a
hate crime when they "knowingly
deface, damage or destroy the real
or personal property of any other
person for the purpose of intimidat
ing or interfering with the free
exercise or enjoyment of [individu
al rights secured by] the constitu
tion or laws of this state."
Because Stanford is an institu
tion, it does not have "civil rights."
Throughout the meeting, Uni
versity officials tried to emphasize
that Stanford as a whole has been
hurt by the incident.
"We're in this together," Beck
ett said. "It's Stanford University
— it's this community."
The Athletics Department may
take further disciplinary action,
but Beckett said he cannot publi
cize these due to University policy.
The Judicial Affairs Office is
also pursuing action against the
students.
"We're working as fast as we
possibly can — [the students]
deserve due process," Jackson said.
