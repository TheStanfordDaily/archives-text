# LGBCC presents needs to Jackson
## 
### Beth Berselli Staff writer 
Student members of the lesbian, gay
and bisexual community presented a list
of their community's needs to Dean of
Students Michael Jackson at a meeting
last night.
The list includes recommendations
for a full-time staff member for the Les
bian, Gay and Bisexual Community Cen
ter, a part-time paid student coordinat
ing position for the Lesbian, Gay and Bi
sexual Speakers Bureau and education
for resident assistants, said center
staff member Natasha Iskander, a
senior. The list also calls for the
creation of a task force to evaluate
lesbian and gay issues and inci
dents of discrimination in the Ath
letics Department.
"The full-time staff member has
to be an administrator," Iskander
said. "An administrator would pro
vide the continuity year after year
that a student could not." It is dif
ficult to meet all the needs of the
community on the center's current
operating budget of $7,000 per
year, she added.
A full-time staff member would

"be identifiable to the community
as someone who can help address
their needs," Iskander said.
Among the needs the staff
member would address is the
prevalence of harassment inci
dents. She cited an incident in the
weight room at Arrillaga Gym last
quarter and last week's deface
ment of the "Gay Liberation" stat
ue as examples of harassment,
pointing out that such incidents
often go unreported.
Community members present
ed the list to administrators,
including Jackson, late last quar
ter, Iskander said. "None of those
needs have been met so far. So
we're re-presenting our needs
now," she said.
Although community members
informally presented their needs at

last night's meeting, they have
been working on an in-depth
report examining the needs of les
bian and gay students for the past
three years.
Administrators and a "working
group" of students from the com
munity have recently been work
ing together to finalize the report,
she said. The final copy of the
report will probably not be released
this year, Iskander added.
Students questioned Jackson
about his commitment to imple
menting the report's recommenda
tions. Iskander urged Jackson "to
put your money where your mouth
is or everything is for naught."
"I'm putting my money where
my mouth is by spending thou
sands of dollars in developing this
report," Jackson responded.

Alumnus Mike Guthrie said
that "we've been giving you sug
gestions for years," but nothing
has ever come of them. He asked
why it is necessary to wait for the
report's completion and why
immediate action cannot be
taken.
Jackson said he is committed
to lesbian and gay issues. He
pointed out that over the past
years part-time adviser Troy
Gilbert has "shifted his time" so
that he is spending more time at
the center.
Special efforts were made this
year to obtain resident assistants
who are lesbian and gay students,
Jackson said. RA training next
year will focus on lesbian and gay
issues, as will various orientation
activities.
