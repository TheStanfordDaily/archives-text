# New literary journal highlights imagination
## 
### Elizabeth Murtaugh Staff writer 
Art lovers at Stanford now
have a literary magazine of a dif
ferent sort on which to focus
their imaginative pleasures.
August — a collection of poet
ry, photography and painting
arranged by three Stanford un
dergraduates — "explores the
artistic journey and process" as
well as the art itself, said junior
Khiem Truong, editor in chief,
who first envisioned the new
journal.
Unlike other literary journals
on campus — which generally
print only a few selections from
each artist — August displays a
series of several works by each
student, offering a richer under
standing of the essence of the
artists' creations and providing a

portrait not only of the art, but of
the artist as well.
Sophomore editor Nicole
Krauss noted that such a format
conveys "more of a feeling of the
artist's entire body of work."
Presenting a series of works
shows the developmental
processes the artists go through,
said junior Carly Berwick,
Krauss's co-editor. "Each per
son's body of work represents a
distinct period of time in his or
her artistic production," she
added.
Raina Bajpai — a graduate
student in the studio art pro
gram whose paintings are fea
tured in August — commented
on the tendency of some literary
journals to "force relationships"
between various works.

Contributors to the August literary journal enjoy their work at the Cummings Art
Building on Thursday.
"It's nice to have a selection of
your pieces shown instead of just
one." When bodies of work are
presented, Bajpai added, they
"coexist rather than being
forced."
After considering "lists and
lists" of possible titles for their
journal, the editors eventually
decided on August because it is, as
Krauss put it,"the Bermuda Tri
angle of the calendar. ... In a
strange way, everything seems to
stop in August. It's a long sort of
magical slumber."
Culminating eight months of
preparation, August's three edi
tors — all creative writing majors
whose poetry appears in the jour
nal — introduced their new cre
ation last Thursday at Cummings
Art Building. Each poet featured
in the journal read selections of
their work to a gathering of about
30 people.
In a recruiting process remark
ably different from the process
most artistic journals use,
Truong, Krauss and Berwick did
not ask for submissions.

Instead, they approached vari
ous artists whose work they had
already encountered, artists who
"have sought out enticing subject
matter," they said.
This method of collaboration
gave each artist a chance to play a
very active role in deciding which
of their works would be included
in the series.
Lending praise for The
Mind's Eye — another Stanford
literary journal — the editors
expressed the importance of hav
ing a diversity of literary voices
on campus.
"There needs to be a sharing of
artistic goals," Truong said.
August's poetry, paintings and
photography offer a diversity of
themes, form, style and location,
featuring snapshots from Manila,
Eastern Europe, Japan and the
San Francisco Underground.
August is funded primarily by
the English, Creative Writing and
Art Departments, but the editors
said they are asking for contribu
tions from the community as well.
The 500 copies of the journal that
are now in print will be on sale
this week in White Plaza, as well
as at the Stanford Bookstore,
Kepler's and Printer's Inc. in
Palo Alto.
