# New literary journal highlights imagination
## 
### Elizabeth Murtaugh Staff writer 
Art lovers at Stanford now
have a literary magazine of a dif
ferent sort on which to focus
their imaginative pleasures.
August — a collection of poet
ry, photography and painting
arranged by three Stanford un
dergraduates — "explores the
artistic journey and process" as
well as the art itself, said junior
Khiem Truong, editor in chief,
who first envisioned the new
journal.
Unlike other literary journals
on campus — which generally
print only a few selections from
each artist — August displays a
series of several works by each
student, offering a richer under
standing of the essence of the
artists' creations and providing a

portrait not only of the art, but of
the artist as well.
Sophomore editor Nicole
Krauss noted that such a format
conveys "more of a feeling of the
artist's entire body of work."
Presenting a series of works
shows the developmental
processes the artists go through,
said junior Carly Berwick,
Krauss's co-editor. "Each per
son's body of work represents a
distinct period of time in his or
her artistic production," she
added.
Raina Bajpai — a graduate
student in the studio art pro
gram whose paintings are fea
tured in August — commented
on the tendency of some literary
journals to "force relationships"
between various works.
