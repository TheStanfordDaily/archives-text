# Journalist sympathizes with anti-media sentiments

### Piers Henwood Staff writer 
Arguing that the transition to a tele
vision-dominated media has corrupted
many of the values once held sacred by
America's press, journalist Daniel
Schorr sympathized with the current
"anti-media cult" developing in the
United States, during a campus ad
dress last night.
"The media assaults and, in a very
general way, insults the whole notion
of individuality," he said to an audi
ence of about 500 people in Kresge Au
ditorium.

His witty speech, titled "Forgive Us
Our Press Passes: Why All the Media
Bashing?" was the 29th annual Carlos
McClatchy Memorial Lecture, present
ed by the Department of Communica
tion.
Schorr, who is presently a senior
news analyst at National Public
Radio, gained national attention
when he opened the first CBS news
bureau in Moscow during the
Khrushchev era.
He is most famous, however, for
his role as CBS's chief correspon
dent during the 1972 Watergate af
fair.

Lamenting the days when expres
sions such as "the power of the
press" referred to the ability of the
written press to do good, Schorr
noted that today's media conjures up
images of "people who are manipu
lating us."
With the television industry domi
nating the media, the press has been
reduced to occupying a "small corner
of the vast entertainment stage," he
said.
The new emphasis on television has
had numerous harmful effects, Schorr
said, each of which contributes to the
current public discontent with the

media.
For example, Schorr recalled one of
his first memorable experiences with
the medium as an illustration of the
way television has destroyed the no
tion of individual privacy.
Having been assigned a story on
the newly initiated Medicare program
in 1966, Schorr was surprised when
he was sent to retrieve "pictures of old
people in hospitals."
Greeted by an understandably in
dignant reception, he realized that
"you can't go and treat people ... as
some generic species."
Schorr also criticized the "diet
of violence" that television cur
rently feeds its viewers.
"Television today has
increased the use of violence as a
way of getting ratings and, in
fact, lives on violence," he said.
This phenomenon has been
especially harmful to today's chil
dren, according to Schorr, so that
"it is no surprise after a while
that you get kids killing kids."
Finally, arguing that the
media ultimately engenders an
"assault on the whole notion of
reality," Schorr criticized televi
sion's tendency to blur the
parameters of everyday life.
"You can't tell anymore what
is real and what is simply a televi

sion program," he said.
Schorr said these develop
ments are the result of a general
change in the media's emphasis,
which tends to "reduce the
denominator and go for poorer
and poorer tastes."
This emphasis, caused in part
by the proliferation of television
companies and subsequent com
petition, has no goal but to maxi
mize entertainment value and
profits, according to Schorr.
"The bottom line is where the
ratings are . . . and ratings are
where the most entertainment
is," he said.
Schorr ended by characteriz
ing the media as "an industry,"
whose nature is so deeply
ingrained that it may be difficult
to rectify in the near future.
"But in the meantime," he
concluded, "forgive us our press
passes because we know not what
we do."
