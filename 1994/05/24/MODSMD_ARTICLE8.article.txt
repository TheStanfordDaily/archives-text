# Stymied by CIV
## CUE ponders combination of three requirements 
### Linda Friedlieb Editorial staff 
Discussion of the culture requirements stymied the
Commission on Undergraduate Education yesterday
as it searched for a way to combine Cultures, Ideas and
Values with the American Cultures and World Cul
tures distribution requirements.
The commission also formally agreed duringyester
day's meeting to propose a three-quarter science core
and a three-class requirement for the humanities and
social sciences, said History Prof. James Sheehan, the
commission's chair. The commission discussed both
proposals at previous meetings.
In addition, the commission touched on the gender
studies requirement, but did not definitively decide on
a course of action during their discussion yesterday.
Commission members concurred that the World
Cultures and American Cultures distribution require
ments should somehow be combined with Cultures,
Ideas and Values to form a single three-course require
ment covering culture, Sheehan said.
The majority of the discussion was dominated by the
question of how to structure the culture requirements.
Although the original proposal before the group in
volved integrating the World Cultures and American
Cultures requirements into individual CIV tracks,
some members of the commission expressed concern
over a possible "tokenist" approach to integration.
According to Art Prof. Wanda Corn, a commission
member, the group agreed that there are currently too
many culture requirements but also felt that CIV is a
valuable unifying experience which should be pre
served.
"Many students, as do faculty who work with fresh
men, feel passionately that CIV is an excellent fresh
man experience ... one that's intense, one that's con
tinuous, one that makes certain that every freshman
has a small class all year," Corn said.
However, she added that many commission mem
bers still feel that the CIV curriculum could be im
proved.
Junior Luz Herrera, the lone undergraduate on the
commission, said she was concerned that CIV fulfill
auricular necessities. "I am skep
tical about incorporating World
Cultures and American Cultures
into CIV. I think they will be over
looked and treated in a tokenist
way like they are now," she said.
"It's hard because CIV is a veiy
complex subject and it's something
people have very strong emotions
about," Corn said. She added that
the commission had discussed the
possibility of a task force "whose
job it would be to rethink CIV
based on many years of experi
ence."
In formulating a three-course
approach to the social sciences and
humanities requirements, the
commission decided that each stu
dent should choose courses related
to a particular theme, Herrera
said.
Sheehan said the concentration
would help students "to begin to
work on a minor or to connect the

classes to studies on an overseas
campus."
He added that while students
could take all humanities or all
social sciences courses, "we're will
ing to take that risk to promote
more flexibility and more cohe
sion."
The science requirements
would be fulfilled by a three-quar
ter course which would ground all
students in the basic sciences,
Sheehan said.
Although the gender require
ment was not extensively dis
cussed, Corn said it will probably
continue to be a prerequisite that
can be fulfilled simultaneously
with another requirement.
"It would be premature in the
history of the school to eliminate
the gender requirement," Corn
said.
The commission is not sched
uled to meet next week during
Memorial Day, but it will discuss
breadth requirements again as
well as issues of governance and
faculty responsibilities at its June
4 meeting.
