For the second straight year, Stanford's average
faculty salaries increased about four percent in
1993-94, keeping the University's average faculty
compensation level far above the national averages
for comparable institutions.
Despite budget cuts, faculty salaries have man
aged to remain among the nation's highest, histori
cally due to attempts to lure prominent professors to
Stanford.
For example, a full professor at Stanford makes
$95,200 on average, as compared with the national
average of $82,520. Similarly, Stanford associate
professors and assistant professors average $65,800
and $51,900 respectively, as compared with nation
al averages of $54,880 and $46,230.
In 1992-93, the average salary for a full professor
at Stanford was $91,200.
Average salaries for professors, associate profes
sors and assistant professors remained well above
the 95th percentile for doctoral institutions, accord
ing to a study conducted by the American Associa
tion of University Professors. Average salaries for
non-tenure track instructors were not released.
On the average, faculty salaries across the coun
try rose 3 percent this academic year, slightly above
the rate of inflation.
The four percent increase in 1993-94 kept Stan
ford faculty salary hikes above inflation by just over
one percent. In 1992-93, average salaries also rose
by four percent.
Ann Fletcher, administrative associate for facul
ty affairs with the Provost's Office, was quick to
mention that the quoted salary increases are only
averages, and that individual schools and depart
ments are free to adjust increases based on criteria

"The numbers reflect a very
broad segment of the faculty,"
Fletcher said.
"They're really 'across the
board' figures, and should be
taken as such."
In the 1993-94 school year,
salaries for full professors aver
aged $100,900 at Harvard Univer
sity, $92,800 at Yale University
and $96,300 at Princeton Univer
sity. UC-Berkeley professors
receive a salary of $76,400, on
average.
