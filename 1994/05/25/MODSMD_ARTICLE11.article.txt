Bombers get life in prison
NEW YORK (AP) — Defiant to the end,
four men convicted in the World Trade
Center bombing were sentenced yesterday
to life behind bars by a judge who said the
attack stole something precious from
Americans: their sense of security.
"Prior to February 26th, 1993, this
country was a much freer place," U.S. Dis
trict Judge Kevin Duffy said as he passed
out 240-year sentences to each of the Mus
lim fundamentalists. "Now we have
guards. Now we have an identification
card mentality. It's not quite as free."
Duffy pronounced the sentences after
hearing Ed Smith tell how his life was
ruined when his pregnant wife, Monica,
was killed in the bombing that left five
others dead and injured more than 1,000.
As he spoke, some of the 10 other fami

ly members seated in the front row wiped
away tears.
"We lost all this because the four men
you are to sentence today wanted to terror
ize the people of the United States," he said.
Duffy said he arrived at the 240-year
sentences for Mohammad Salameh, Nidal
Ayyad, Mahmud Abouhalima and Ahmad
Ajaj by calculating the life expectancy of
the six killed in the blast — 180 years —
and adding 30 years each on two other
counts.
He also fined the men $250,000 each
and told them that if they ever sold their
story, the money would go to the victims.
But, he added with icy disgust when
sentencing Ayyad, "I can't imagine anyone
wanting to give you anything."
The hearing stretched for more than
seven hours because each defendant was
permitted to speak.
