## Rostenkowski may plead guilty 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Rep. Dan
Rostenkowski would plead guilty to a
felony under an agreement being dis
cussed with prosecutors, said congres
sional and legal sources yesterday. That
would cost him his House Ways and
Means Committee chairmanship and
probably lead to his resignation, they
said.
Plea negotiations resumed yesterday
between Rostenkowski lawyer, Robert S.
Bennett, and the U.S. attorney's office.
Nothing was resolved and chances for an
agreement were described as "fifty-fifty."
"In the event of a plea agreement, it
is inconceivable that Congressman Ros
tenkowski could remain as chairman of
the committee and his continued repre
sentation in Congress is most unlikely,"
said a source close to the negotiations,
who spoke only on condition of
anonymity.
Sources close to the discussions said

the negotiations are stuck over "the
wording" of an agreement, "how the
alleged wrongdoing is described."
The sources said Bennett is not push
ing for a misdemeanor plea, and U.S.
Attorney Eric Holder is not making such
an offer. Sources said that Bennett would
not even accept a misdemeanor plea that
lacked an agreement on prison time.
Rather, the sources added, Bennett
would have Rostenkowski plea to a felony
and work out an "acceptable amount of
time."
A misdemeanor carries a maximum
one-year prison term and the U.S. district
judge assigned to the case, Norma John
son, is known as a tough sentencer. Ben
nett likely would agree to a felony plea
along with less than a year of prison time,
the sources added.
The U.S. attorney's office has been
investigating the Illinois Democrat's use
of office and campaign accounts, includ

ing the possibility that he received money
improperly from the House Post Office,
hired ghost employees and made improp
er furniture and gift purchases from his
official funds.
While there has been much specula
tion on Capitol Hill about a Rostenkows
ki resignation as part of a plea agreement,
prosecutors generally consider such an
outcome secondary to obtaining a felony
plea from a public official.
House Democratic Caucus rules would
force Rostenkowski to step aside as chair
man of the Ways and Means Committee
— a crucial panel in the consideration of
President Clinton's health care legisla
tion — if he were indicted for a felony that
carried a prison term of at least two years.
If he were to plead guilty or be convict
ed in a trial, House rules say he should —
but would not be required to — refrain
from participating in committee business
or floor votes.
