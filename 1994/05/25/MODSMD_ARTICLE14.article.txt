## Editorial Only halfway there Changing the grading policy ought to mirror a new advising system 
### 
Faculty members who are
in favor of passing the Com
mittee on Academic Appraisal
and Achievement's proposed
changes to the grading policy at
tomorrow's Faculty Senate meeting
are sending undergraduate stu
dents, whom the policy will most
strongly affect, a very clear mes
sage:
Yes, we recognize that the under
graduate advising system is grossly
inadequate. So, yes, if the commit
tee's proposal passes now, you will
have to guess about which classes
you are best prepared for, and
which would be the best use of your
time.
To get some feedback about
whether you guessed correctly,
you'll have to wait until after a
midterm is returned to you. By that
time it will probably be too late to
switch into another class without
being marked by a "W" on your
transcript.
Of course, it would probably be a
much more efficient use of the Uni
versity's precious academic
resources to help students choose
the most appropriate classes in the
first place. So it's probably true that
a better advising system needs to go
hand-in-hand with our proposal.
But advising isn't really within
the charge of our committee . . .
sorry.
This attitude of compartmental
ized decision-making is precisely
what Stanford has been trying to
move away from in recent years.
Astute students, scholars and poli
cy-makers in every discipline from
earth sciences to economics are dis
covering that the best policy deci
sions take into account the ways in
which seemingly different issues,
like course drop policies and the
advising system, are intimately

related.
They need to be discussed and
worked out together.
Failing to take this holistic
approach results in lots of little poli
cies that lack a cohesive philosophy
and grow chaotically as time goes
on. Witness the explosion of dis
parate distribution requirements
over the past decade.
Just this year, University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper instituted the
Commission on Undergraduate
Education to evaluate all aspects of
the undergraduate experience, and
to recommend ways to address
some of the problems the past's dis
jointed decision-making has caused.
Ironically, the commission has
not evaluated the grading system in
part because the C-AAA study was
already underway, but it has put
significant effort into studying the
advising system and will suggest
potential improvements in its
report next year.
It would be schizophrenic for the
senate to ignore entirely the philos
ophy of the commission's work and
pass a sweeping grading proposal
without so much as a nod to how
advising changes would be imple
mented.
The senate should postpone
passing the proposed changes in the
C-AAA's grading policy until they
can be evaluated next to the advis
ing improvements suggested in the
commission's report. The grading
policy changes would not take effect
until the 1995-96 academic year.
For the proposal to be pushed
through at tomorrow's meeting
would be a waste — the changes
will have to be re-evaluated in light
of the advising proposals.
To quote Geology Prof. Gail
Mahood, who is spearheading the
proposed grading changes: "What
we were trying to do with our pro
posals was encourage sensible use
of academic resources, meaning fac
ulty and student time and dollars."
The most sensible and effective
proposal can come only through a
unified improvement in both the
grading system and the advising
system.
