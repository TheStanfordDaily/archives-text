## When mail becomes your life 
### 
AT STANFORD, it's probably fair
to say that our post office box is a
fairly significant part of our lives.
We may check it a few times a day and
obviously, a full P.O. box is good and an
empty one may leave us disappointed for
a little while.
However, as anyone who is or has been
abroad for any significant period of time
knows, mail takes on an entirely new
meaning outside the United States. The
obsession is inexplicable, but the symp
toms are clear. . . .
Ten universal truths about receiving
(or not receiving) mail overseas:
1. Resist though you may try, mail will
take on absurd importance in your life.
Sooner or later, you will get that strange
and pathetic feeling that somehow your
life revolves around your mailbox.
2. The frequency and timing of your
mailbox-checking has absolutely no con
nection with reality. Once again on the
pathos theme — although mail only
comes in twice a day to Stanford's Oxford
campus, mailbox-checking here occurs far
more frequently. Mail dependency has
truly taken its hold on you when checking
the mailbox becomes an involuntary
reflex reaction. "I'm just like Pavlov's
dog," one student said regarding her com
pulsive mail-checking.
3. An empty mailbox always deserves
double- and triple-checking. You never
know when those sneaky letters might be
hiding in the back of the mailbox, just out

of your reach.
4. The likelihood that you will receive
mail is inversely related to the amount of
time you are away from home. It's not
really that people forget about you, but
laziness is like entropy — it can only
increase as time goes on.
5. If you share a mailbox with other
people, all of them will get more mail than
you do. Let's take Stanford in Oxford as
an example. The mailboxes here are by
the first letter of your last name. So I, for
example, use the "C" box. Even though I
am positive that Bayliss Camp, Tasneem
Campwala, Judy Chi and Chris Chow all
get more mail than I do (since I have to
rifle through it every day looking for my
own non-existent letters), they will all
complain that they are the ones who get
the least mail. It's like when Stanford stu
dents get together and argue about who
has the most work to do.
6. And you will resent them for it. So the
other "C"s get more mail than I do. I'm not
bitter at all. (Really, that bonfire I lit in the
Stanford Centre's back garden the other
night was just made from scrap paper.)
7. Not all mail is created equal. The
basic hierarchy, lowest to highest: admin
istrative mail (Registrar's Office notices,
financial aid notices), postcards, parental
mail, friend mail and significant-other
mail. Care packages reign supreme —
particularly ones that are so big that the
UPS workers have to wheel it in on a dolly
and charge the recipient value-added-tax

into the double-digit pounds (yes, some
one at the Stanford in Oxford really got
one of these). Receiving large empty boxes
doesn't count (yes, someone got one of
these too).
8. Mail of any kind is better than none.
That reminder from the Registrar's
Office to file your registration commit
ments may not be highly warm or person
al, but it's in your mailbox and it has your
name on it.
9. Sending yourself letters may pacify
the immediate physical need for mail, hut
it is only an empty joy.
10. Ultimately, mail is not just commu
nication from friends and family, it is an
affirmation of your very existence. In a
post-modernist world where relativists
have forced us to ask questions like, "Am
I really alive, or do I just think I am?"
there is nothing more reassuring than
seeing an envelope with your name writ
ten on it.
So, as Hallmark might say, "Go ahead,
show a loved one they exist in the world
today."

This public service announcement is
brought to you on the behalf of all students
at Stanford's overseas campuses. All of
you at home should get off your lazy butts
and write.
