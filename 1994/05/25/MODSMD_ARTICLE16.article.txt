## Alumnus outraged by defacement of gay sculpture 
### 
AS AN ALUMNUS arid a gay rights
lawyer, I am outraged by the recent
vandalism of the "Gay Liberation"
sculpture. I am further outraged by the
blase comments of wrestling coach Chris
Horpel which appeared May 18 in the San
Jose Mercury News. Horpel apparently
considers the whole thing to be "blown
out of proportion," and the desecration to
be an understandable "reaction to being
force-fed political correctness" by the Uni
versity.
Just like some men don't understand

sexual harassment the way women do,
and whites view the state of race relations
differently than blacks, so too Horpel, a
presumably straight man, just simply
doesn't get it.
He doesn't understand that the dese
cration is analogous to Nazis pushing over
grave stones in Jewish cemeteries. It is an
attack on an entire community because of
who they are.
The statue is a symbol of liberation to
gays, an affirmation of who they are, an
assurance that it is OK to come out of the

closet and be oneself. An attack on the
statue tells every gay person that it is still
dangerous to be out and open about one's
orientation — that there are persons out
there who may very well bash him as well.
The state of California has recognized
that certain crimes are much worse if moti
vated by hatred of certain classes of people.
The penal code calls for extra penalties if
an assault is motivated by racial, gender,
ethnic or orientation hatred.
Thus this desecration is a hate crime,
pure and simple. It wasn't a building, wall

or lamp post that was vandalized. It was a
statue that symbolizes hope, freedom and
the right to exist to gay and lesbian people
everywhere.
The University should insist that Hor
pel take sensitivity training along with the
bigoted athletes who participated in this
outrage; the University should not
attempt to keep this matter in-house, but
should let the law decide the appropriate
penalty.
