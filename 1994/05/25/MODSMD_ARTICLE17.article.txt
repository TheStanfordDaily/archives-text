# Croal's cowardice label on Horpel and others is misapplied, says athlete
## 
### 
N'Gai Croal wrote about cowardice in
his column yesterday. He labeled several
people as cowards. These included Chris
Horpel, writers for The Stanford Review
and various administrators.
Croal then wrote:
"True courage means that your views
and opinions are not dictated by what oth
ers might think. It means that you
express yourself openly and accept the
consequences. Because the right of free
speech doesn't protect you from others
disagreeing with you, even vehemently."
Croal labels Horpel as a coward
because he stated his opinion and then
clarified it after several days of hate mail
and threatening phone calls. The staff of
The Review is guilty of cowardice because
it publishes heretical opinions.
University President Gerhard Casper,
Dean of Students Michael Jackson and
Vice Provost for Student Affairs Mary
Edmonds are alleged cowards because
they don't censor The Review and punish
those people who voice heretical opinions.
Croal continued:
"The Stanford Review viciously attacks
black, Chicano, gay, lesbian and bisexual

students week after week, yet University
officials continue to grant [The Review!
interviews and features without ever
questioning or responding to those
attacks. Again, personal cowardice."
These people are not cowards. It is
admirable that Horpel and writers for The
Review voice any opinion, considering the
censoring, politically correct attitudes on
campus which Croal apparently supports.
I would like to offer my own definition
of a coward. A coward is afraid to hear
opinions of others. A coward refuses to
accept another's ideas as legitimate opin
ions and dismisses them as ignorant and
intolerant. A coward throws away hun
dreds of newspapers to keep others from
reading the heretical words within.
Who are the real cowards? Those who
dare to have an opinion other than your
own? I know Chris Horpel. He is no coward.
