# LGBCC adviser thanks supporters for helping to deal with vandalism

### 
I would like to offer a sincere and heart
felt thanks to countless lesbian, gay and
bisexual students and their supporters for

their tireless work to educate the Stanford
community about the meaning of George
Segal's sculpture "Gay Liberation." I have
seen students commit to literally hun
dreds of hours of work in writing state
ments, documenting information, leading
discussions, taking hundreds of phone
calls from the press and meeting with
administrators.
They have done this while personally
feeling victimized by the statues' recent
defacement and while being under the
pressures of full course loads and
approaching finals. The advertisement
and guidance of organizations like Out
at Stanford (gay and lesbian faculty and
staff) and the Stanford Gay and Lesbian
Alumni have been invaluable to their
efforts. The support of concerned het
erosexuals has been deeply felt.
It is fitting to note that we are merely
a month away from the 25th anniversary
of the Stonewall Rebellion, where gay
patrons of a New York City bar violently
fought for three days against continued
police brutality and harassment. This
rebellion resulted in the formation of
new, vocal an politically active "gay liber
ation" organizations. It is this very rebel
lion against brutality and harassment
the Segal sculpture commemorates.
Gay, lesbian and bisexual Stanford
students continue to raise issues and
awareness to individuals and groups
about how an attack on this symbol is

an attack on our very presence here.
They are heroes.
