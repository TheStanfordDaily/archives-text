# Daily used faulty logic in article to account for low alumni satisfaction
## 
### 
In the May 15 article "Stanford
ranks fourth in fund raising," The
Daily said, "Low alumni satisfaction
could be one cause of the problem [of a
low level of alumni participation!."
The source cited is the U.S. News
and World Report listing that ranks
Stanford 77th in alumni satisfaction.
However, the U.S. News and World
Report arrives at this statistic by
counting the percentage of alumni who
donate.
Therefore, Stanford, with a 26 per
cent participation level, would natural
ly rank low.
By The Daily's logic, the reason that
the percentage of alumni donating is
low is that a small percentage of alumni
donate.
