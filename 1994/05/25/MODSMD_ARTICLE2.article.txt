# Tennis falls to USC in NCAAs
## Captures second place 
### Mike Langford Senior staff writer 
SOUTH BEND, Ind. — Close. So very close.
But unfortunately for the Stanford men's tennis
team, close is still the distance between first and
second place.
In what coaches and long-time tennis afi
cionados termed as perhaps the most exciting
final ever, USC beat Stanford 4-3 in the finals of
the NCAA Men's Tennis Championships yester
day at Notre Dame to claim the national title.
After a long season of points and predictions,
preparation and expectation, it came down to
one dual match. Even to the third set of the last
match. And the proverbial Promised Land was
just inches away at times.
The Cardinal had its chances for the win —
the match was as close as one point, at times. But
USC survived many close calls, supporting the
No. 1 ranking it has held since the middle of the
season.
"We were fortunate to win today," said USC
head coach Dick Leach. "Don't think I don't
know that."
Stanford finishes the year with a 25-3 record,
ranked No. 2 in the nation.
USC won two of three dou
bles matches to gain the initial
team point, then won three of
six singles matches to earn the
necessary four points for their
15th national title in tennis, and
third in the last four years.
For Stanford, the third time
wasn't a charm. The Cardinal
previously faced the Trojans
twice this year, once at Stanford
and once at USC, with the Tro
jans coming out on top both
times by a 4-3 score.
"We split singles every time
we met them," said Stanford
head coach Dick Gould after the
match, then added laughingly,
"we never could figure out how
to get that damn doubles point."
Although the Cardinal had
been playing probably its best
doubles of the year, it was not
enough to take down the Tro
jans. USC finishes the year with
unquestionably the best doubles
in the country. In every one of
their dual matches this year, the
Trojans won the doubles point.
And yesterday was no excep
tion, though Stanford was
poised within a few inches of
breaking that streak.
Stanford's third doubles
team scored the first win of the
day. Freshman Grant Elliott
and senior Vimal Patel captured
their match for the fourth con
secutive day at NCAAs. After

both Stanford and the USC
team of Brett Hansen and Chad
Rosser held their service games
throughout, Elliott and Patel
broke Rosser's serve for the 8-6
victory.
However, soon after, Stan
fDrd's first doubles team of
Michael Flanagan and Chris
Cocotos fell to USC's Wayne
Black and Jon Leach, 5-8.
Though the teams had split in
their two meetings during the
year, the duo from USC was in
control yesterday. Using
Leach's powerful serve and
Black's pin-point shot selection,
Flanagan and Cocotos were no
match on this occasion.
All eyes then focused on court
two, where Stanford's Jeff
Salzenstein and Bobby Devens
were engaged in heated battle
with USC's Lukas Hovorka and
Adam Peterson. With Stanford
up 7-5, Hovorka was on the
verge of being broken to lose the
match and doubles point. After
reaching deuce and ad out —
each a match point for Stanford
— a number of times, Hovorka
and Peterson managed to hold
on to the serve, and set the
match score at 7-6
"That was one key to the
match," Gould said. "Hovorka
was having a little bit of trouble
and I thought that the last three
or four games of that second
doubles match he really rose up
and took charge. That made a
big difference. Up to that point,

we had things going a little bit
our way."
With the score 7-6 and
Salzenstein serving, Stanford
only needed to hold the serve to
secure the doubles point. Again,
the game went to deuce several
times, and again Stanford had a
few match points. But again
also, USC would survive the
scare time after time, rise to the
occasion and come away with
the break.
At 7-7 and momentum
securely on its side, USC held
serve — despite a break point
for Stanford — and then, at 8-7,
broke Devens' serve for the 9-7
win and the critical doubles
point.
"Bobby and I jusi didn't come
up with the shots when we need
ed to," Salzenstein said. "We
had a lot of chances, but we just
didn't come through.
"After that, we were emotion
ally, mentally and* physically
drained."
"We put ourselves in a posi
tion to win," Gould said. "We
just weren't quite good enough
at that time to take advantage of
it. We had five match points.
That certainly puts us in a good
position. You just have to make
those things count."
Stanford faced a formidable
task at that point: win four of
the six singles matches from the
top-ranked team in the country.
And while the Cardinal came
close, USC's talent and experi
ence prevailed.
Characteristically saving his
best tennis for the end of the
year, Cocotos was the first off
the courts, demolishing Peter
son 6-2, 6-2. In their previous
two meetings this season,
Peterson had won in straight
sets, but the senior Cocotos
saved a victory for his final col
legiate match.
Soon after, Brett Hansen fin
ished off Devens at third sin
gles, 6-2, 6-2. Devens, no doubt
feeling the effects of the hour
and-a-half doubles match, suc
cumbed quickly to Hansen, who
had beaten Devens in both of
their previous meetings this
year.
But Stanford responded at
sixth singles, where Patel
secured a 6-2, 6-3 pounding of
Phil Whitesell. Patel's typically
fast victory was also the last
match of his collegiate tennis
career.
At first singles, USC's Black
showed the collegiate tennis
world why he is ranked No. 1 in
the nation. Although Black and
Flanagan split the honors in
their two meetings this year,
there was little doubt in yester
day's match as to who would
take the third. Black methodi
cally and powerfully used
incredibly precise ground
strokes to beat Flanagan by a 6-
3, 6-2 score.
With the team score 3-2 in
USC's favor, Stanford needed to
win both of the remaining sin
gles matches to take the match
and title.
For a while, it looked like
that would happen.
First, sophomore Jim
Thomas completed his assign
ment against Lukas Hovorka at
fourth singles.
Though none of Thomas'
contests in the NCAAs had
counted — all had been sus
pended when the team clinched
the matches — Thomas showed
that he could get a win, beating
Hovorka 6-4, 7-6 (7-2).
Which left second singles as
the deciding match. When
Thomas won his tie-break,
Salzenstein and Leach were tied
up at one set apiece. Salzenstein
had taken the first set in a tie
breaker, and Leach had won the
second.
For the second time, every
one tuned in to court two. In
both of their previous meetings,
Salzenstein had beaten Leach,
though both times, it had been
after the match had been decid
ed.
But this time, one set
between the two would deter
mine the national champion.
Both held serve until, at 3-3

with Salzenstein serving, a
game went to deuce for the first
time in the set. Then, after los
ing a point and going to ad out,
rhythm was broken at perhaps
the most critical point of the
championships.
Salzenstein's cardinal-red
shoelace broke.
"I knew if I could stop his
rhythm, I could get back in it,"
Leach said. "But he stopped it
for me."
"The bad timing of it really
didn't bother me," Salzenstein
said. "But it did happen at a
critical time of the match."
After the delay where Salzen
stein laced up his shoe with a
new, white lace, play resumed.
Eleven more points would be
played. Leach would win nine of
them.
He won the first point to win
the deuce, and to break Salzen
stein and go up 4-3.
Then, after holding serve,
Leach feasted on Salzenstein's
serve, not allowing the Stanford
sophomore a single point.
Breaking him at love, Leach
won the set, match, and cham
pionship for his coach/dad and
his team.
"It was like a Hollywood fin
ish out there," coach Leach
said. "You couldn't ask for a
better script, to watch your son
play for a national champi
onship."
"Coming in, I knew he was
tough," said Jon Leach, whose
1-2 record against Salzenstein
is the best losing record in ten
nis. "Fortunately for me, here
(at NCAAs) it's not the records
that matter. It's who is ready to
step up."
"Today, I knew it was going
to be a hell of a match," Salzen
stein said. "I was going to fight
my butt off to win, but it just
didn't work out.
"It's kind of a blur right
now."
But Gould stood firmly
behind Salzenstein, who will
now take the reins as the leader
of Stanford tennis with the
departure of Flanagan, Cocotos,
Devens and Patel.
"I'll tell you what, Jeff has
done a great job all year," Gould
said. "He's had the best year,
match in and match out of any
one on our team. I couldn't be
prouder. If there's anyone on
the line right there at the end,
he's the guy I want there."
For Stanford, it was only the
second loss in NCAA champi
onship finals.
With team competition
ended, individual and doubles
competition will begin. Today
12th-seeded Flanagan will face
Drake's Ross Nwachukwu,
unseeded Devens will encounter
Miami's Srdjan Muskotirovic
and unseeded Salzenstein will
play fifth-seed Mark Merklein
of Florida.
Doubles play begins tomor
row.

SOUTH BEND, Ind. — Close. So very close.
But unfortunately for the Stanford men's tennis
team, close is still the distance between first and
second place.
In what coaches and long-time tennis afi
cionados termed as perhaps the most exciting
final ever, USC beat Stanford 4-3 in the finals of
the NCAA Men's Tennis Championships yester
day at Notre Dame to claim the national title.
After a long season of points and predictions,
preparation and expectation, it came down to
one dual match. Even to the third set of the last
match. And the proverbial Promised Land was
just inches away at times.
The Cardinal had its chances for the win —
the match was as close as one point, at times. But
USC survived many close calls, supporting the
No. 1 ranking it has held since the middle of the
season.
"We were fortunate to win today," said USC
head coach Dick Leach. "Don't think I don't
know that."
Stanford finishes the year with a 25-3 record,
ranked No. 2 in the nation.
USC won two of three dou
bles matches to gain the initial
team point, then won three of
six singles matches to earn the
necessary four points for their
15th national title in tennis, and
third in the last four years.
For Stanford, the third time
wasn't a charm. The Cardinal
previously faced the Trojans
twice this year, once at Stanford
and once at USC, with the Tro
jans coming out on top both
times by a 4-3 score.
"We split singles every time
we met them," said Stanford
head coach Dick Gould after the
match, then added laughingly,
"we never could figure out how
to get that damn doubles point."
Although the Cardinal had
been playing probably its best
doubles of the year, it was not
enough to take down the Tro
jans. USC finishes the year with
unquestionably the best doubles
in the country. In every one of
their dual matches this year, the
Trojans won the doubles point.
And yesterday was no excep
tion, though Stanford was
poised within a few inches of
breaking that streak.
Stanford's third doubles
team scored the first win of the
day. Freshman Grant Elliott
and senior Vimal Patel captured
their match for the fourth con
secutive day at NCAAs. After

both Stanford and the USC
team of Brett Hansen and Chad
Rosser held their service games
throughout, Elliott and Patel
broke Rosser's serve for the 8-6
victory.
However, soon after, Stan
fDrd's first doubles team of
Michael Flanagan and Chris
Cocotos fell to USC's Wayne
Black and Jon Leach, 5-8.
Though the teams had split in
their two meetings during the
year, the duo from USC was in
control yesterday. Using
Leach's powerful serve and
Black's pin-point shot selection,
Flanagan and Cocotos were no
match on this occasion.
All eyes then focused on court
two, where Stanford's Jeff
Salzenstein and Bobby Devens
were engaged in heated battle
with USC's Lukas Hovorka and
Adam Peterson. With Stanford
up 7-5, Hovorka was on the
verge of being broken to lose the
match and doubles point. After
reaching deuce and ad out —
each a match point for Stanford
— a number of times, Hovorka
and Peterson managed to hold
on to the serve, and set the
match score at 7-6
"That was one key to the
match," Gould said. "Hovorka
was having a little bit of trouble
and I thought that the last three
or four games of that second
doubles match he really rose up
and took charge. That made a
big difference. Up to that point,

we had things going a little bit
our way."
With the score 7-6 and
Salzenstein serving, Stanford
only needed to hold the serve to
secure the doubles point. Again,
the game went to deuce several
times, and again Stanford had a
few match points. But again
also, USC would survive the
scare time after time, rise to the
occasion and come away with
the break.
At 7-7 and momentum
securely on its side, USC held
serve — despite a break point
for Stanford — and then, at 8-7,
broke Devens' serve for the 9-7
win and the critical doubles
point.
"Bobby and I jusi didn't come
up with the shots when we need
ed to," Salzenstein said. "We
had a lot of chances, but we just
didn't come through.
"After that, we were emotion
ally, mentally and* physically
drained."
"We put ourselves in a posi
tion to win," Gould said. "We
just weren't quite good enough
at that time to take advantage of
it. We had five match points.
That certainly puts us in a good
position. You just have to make
those things count."
Stanford faced a formidable
task at that point: win four of
the six singles matches from the
top-ranked team in the country.
And while the Cardinal came
close, USC's talent and experi
ence prevailed.
Characteristically saving his
best tennis for the end of the
year, Cocotos was the first off
the courts, demolishing Peter
son 6-2, 6-2. In their previous
two meetings this season,
Peterson had won in straight
sets, but the senior Cocotos
saved a victory for his final col
legiate match.
Soon after, Brett Hansen fin
ished off Devens at third sin
gles, 6-2, 6-2. Devens, no doubt
feeling the effects of the hour
and-a-half doubles match, suc
cumbed quickly to Hansen, who
had beaten Devens in both of
their previous meetings this
year.
But Stanford responded at
sixth singles, where Patel
secured a 6-2, 6-3 pounding of
Phil Whitesell. Patel's typically
fast victory was also the last
match of his collegiate tennis
career.
At first singles, USC's Black
showed the collegiate tennis
world why he is ranked No. 1 in
the nation. Although Black and
Flanagan split the honors in
their two meetings this year,
there was little doubt in yester
day's match as to who would
take the third. Black methodi
cally and powerfully used
incredibly precise ground
strokes to beat Flanagan by a 6-
3, 6-2 score.
With the team score 3-2 in
USC's favor, Stanford needed to
win both of the remaining sin
gles matches to take the match
and title.
For a while, it looked like
that would happen.
First, sophomore Jim
Thomas completed his assign
ment against Lukas Hovorka at
fourth singles.
Though none of Thomas'
contests in the NCAAs had
counted — all had been sus
pended when the team clinched
the matches — Thomas showed
that he could get a win, beating
Hovorka 6-4, 7-6 (7-2).
Which left second singles as
the deciding match. When
Thomas won his tie-break,
Salzenstein and Leach were tied
up at one set apiece. Salzenstein
had taken the first set in a tie
breaker, and Leach had won the
second.
For the second time, every
one tuned in to court two. In
both of their previous meetings,
Salzenstein had beaten Leach,
though both times, it had been
after the match had been decid
ed.
But this time, one set
between the two would deter
mine the national champion.
Both held serve until, at 3-3

with Salzenstein serving, a
game went to deuce for the first
time in the set. Then, after los
ing a point and going to ad out,
rhythm was broken at perhaps
the most critical point of the
championships.
Salzenstein's cardinal-red
shoelace broke.
"I knew if I could stop his
rhythm, I could get back in it,"
Leach said. "But he stopped it
for me."
"The bad timing of it really
didn't bother me," Salzenstein
said. "But it did happen at a
critical time of the match."
After the delay where Salzen
stein laced up his shoe with a
new, white lace, play resumed.
Eleven more points would be
played. Leach would win nine of
them.
He won the first point to win
the deuce, and to break Salzen
stein and go up 4-3.
Then, after holding serve,
Leach feasted on Salzenstein's
serve, not allowing the Stanford
sophomore a single point.
Breaking him at love, Leach
won the set, match, and cham
pionship for his coach/dad and
his team.
"It was like a Hollywood fin
ish out there," coach Leach
said. "You couldn't ask for a
better script, to watch your son
play for a national champi
onship."
"Coming in, I knew he was
tough," said Jon Leach, whose
1-2 record against Salzenstein
is the best losing record in ten
nis. "Fortunately for me, here
(at NCAAs) it's not the records
that matter. It's who is ready to
step up."
"Today, I knew it was going
to be a hell of a match," Salzen
stein said. "I was going to fight
my butt off to win, but it just
didn't work out.
"It's kind of a blur right
now."
But Gould stood firmly
behind Salzenstein, who will
now take the reins as the leader
of Stanford tennis with the
departure of Flanagan, Cocotos,
Devens and Patel.
"I'll tell you what, Jeff has
done a great job all year," Gould
said. "He's had the best year,
match in and match out of any
one on our team. I couldn't be
prouder. If there's anyone on
the line right there at the end,
he's the guy I want there."
For Stanford, it was only the
second loss in NCAA champi
onship finals.
With team competition
ended, individual and doubles
competition will begin. Today
12th-seeded Flanagan will face
Drake's Ross Nwachukwu,
unseeded Devens will encounter
Miami's Srdjan Muskotirovic
and unseeded Salzenstein will
play fifth-seed Mark Merklein
of Florida.

SOUTH BEND, Ind. — Close. So very close.
But unfortunately for the Stanford men's tennis
team, close is still the distance between first and
second place.
In what coaches and long-time tennis afi
cionados termed as perhaps the most exciting
final ever, USC beat Stanford 4-3 in the finals of
the NCAA Men's Tennis Championships yester
day at Notre Dame to claim the national title.
After a long season of points and predictions,
preparation and expectation, it came down to
one dual match. Even to the third set of the last
match. And the proverbial Promised Land was
just inches away at times.
The Cardinal had its chances for the win —
the match was as close as one point, at times. But
USC survived many close calls, supporting the
No. 1 ranking it has held since the middle of the
season.
"We were fortunate to win today," said USC
head coach Dick Leach. "Don't think I don't
know that."
Stanford finishes the year with a 25-3 record,
ranked No. 2 in the nation.
USC won two of three dou
bles matches to gain the initial
team point, then won three of
six singles matches to earn the
necessary four points for their
15th national title in tennis, and
third in the last four years.
For Stanford, the third time
wasn't a charm. The Cardinal
previously faced the Trojans
twice this year, once at Stanford
and once at USC, with the Tro
jans coming out on top both
times by a 4-3 score.
"We split singles every time
we met them," said Stanford
head coach Dick Gould after the
match, then added laughingly,
"we never could figure out how
to get that damn doubles point."
Although the Cardinal had
been playing probably its best
doubles of the year, it was not
enough to take down the Tro
jans. USC finishes the year with
unquestionably the best doubles
in the country. In every one of
their dual matches this year, the
Trojans won the doubles point.
And yesterday was no excep
tion, though Stanford was
poised within a few inches of
breaking that streak.
Stanford's third doubles
team scored the first win of the
day. Freshman Grant Elliott
and senior Vimal Patel captured
their match for the fourth con
secutive day at NCAAs. After

both Stanford and the USC
team of Brett Hansen and Chad
Rosser held their service games
throughout, Elliott and Patel
broke Rosser's serve for the 8-6
victory.
However, soon after, Stan
fDrd's first doubles team of
Michael Flanagan and Chris
Cocotos fell to USC's Wayne
Black and Jon Leach, 5-8.
Though the teams had split in
their two meetings during the
year, the duo from USC was in
control yesterday. Using
Leach's powerful serve and
Black's pin-point shot selection,
Flanagan and Cocotos were no
match on this occasion.
All eyes then focused on court
two, where Stanford's Jeff
Salzenstein and Bobby Devens
were engaged in heated battle
with USC's Lukas Hovorka and
Adam Peterson. With Stanford
up 7-5, Hovorka was on the
verge of being broken to lose the
match and doubles point. After
reaching deuce and ad out —
each a match point for Stanford
— a number of times, Hovorka
and Peterson managed to hold
on to the serve, and set the
match score at 7-6
"That was one key to the
match," Gould said. "Hovorka
was having a little bit of trouble
and I thought that the last three
or four games of that second
doubles match he really rose up
and took charge. That made a
big difference. Up to that point,

we had things going a little bit
our way."
With the score 7-6 and
Salzenstein serving, Stanford
only needed to hold the serve to
secure the doubles point. Again,
the game went to deuce several
times, and again Stanford had a
few match points. But again
also, USC would survive the
scare time after time, rise to the
occasion and come away with
the break.
At 7-7 and momentum
securely on its side, USC held
serve — despite a break point
for Stanford — and then, at 8-7,
broke Devens' serve for the 9-7
win and the critical doubles
point.
"Bobby and I jusi didn't come
up with the shots when we need
ed to," Salzenstein said. "We
had a lot of chances, but we just
didn't come through.
"After that, we were emotion
ally, mentally and* physically
drained."
"We put ourselves in a posi
tion to win," Gould said. "We
just weren't quite good enough
at that time to take advantage of
it. We had five match points.
That certainly puts us in a good
position. You just have to make
those things count."
Stanford faced a formidable
task at that point: win four of
the six singles matches from the
top-ranked team in the country.
And while the Cardinal came
close, USC's talent and experi
ence prevailed.
Characteristically saving his
best tennis for the end of the
year, Cocotos was the first off
the courts, demolishing Peter
son 6-2, 6-2. In their previous
two meetings this season,
Peterson had won in straight
sets, but the senior Cocotos
saved a victory for his final col
legiate match.
Soon after, Brett Hansen fin
ished off Devens at third sin
gles, 6-2, 6-2. Devens, no doubt
feeling the effects of the hour
and-a-half doubles match, suc
cumbed quickly to Hansen, who
had beaten Devens in both of
their previous meetings this
year.
But Stanford responded at
sixth singles, where Patel
secured a 6-2, 6-3 pounding of
Phil Whitesell. Patel's typically
fast victory was also the last
match of his collegiate tennis
career.
At first singles, USC's Black
showed the collegiate tennis
world why he is ranked No. 1 in
the nation. Although Black and
Flanagan split the honors in
their two meetings this year,
there was little doubt in yester
day's match as to who would
take the third. Black methodi
cally and powerfully used
incredibly precise ground
strokes to beat Flanagan by a 6-
3, 6-2 score.
With the team score 3-2 in
USC's favor, Stanford needed to
win both of the remaining sin
gles matches to take the match
and title.
For a while, it looked like
that would happen.
First, sophomore Jim
Thomas completed his assign
ment against Lukas Hovorka at
fourth singles.
Though none of Thomas'
contests in the NCAAs had
counted — all had been sus
pended when the team clinched
the matches — Thomas showed
that he could get a win, beating
Hovorka 6-4, 7-6 (7-2).
Which left second singles as
the deciding match. When
Thomas won his tie-break,
Salzenstein and Leach were tied
up at one set apiece. Salzenstein
had taken the first set in a tie
breaker, and Leach had won the
second.
For the second time, every
one tuned in to court two. In
both of their previous meetings,
Salzenstein had beaten Leach,
though both times, it had been
after the match had been decid
ed.
But this time, one set
between the two would deter
mine the national champion.
Both held serve until, at 3-3

with Salzenstein serving, a
game went to deuce for the first
time in the set. Then, after los
ing a point and going to ad out,
rhythm was broken at perhaps
the most critical point of the
championships.
Salzenstein's cardinal-red
shoelace broke.
"I knew if I could stop his
rhythm, I could get back in it,"
Leach said. "But he stopped it
for me."
"The bad timing of it really
didn't bother me," Salzenstein
said. "But it did happen at a
critical time of the match."
After the delay where Salzen
stein laced up his shoe with a
new, white lace, play resumed.
Eleven more points would be
played. Leach would win nine of
them.
He won the first point to win
the deuce, and to break Salzen
stein and go up 4-3.
Then, after holding serve,
Leach feasted on Salzenstein's
serve, not allowing the Stanford
sophomore a single point.
Breaking him at love, Leach
won the set, match, and cham
pionship for his coach/dad and
his team.
"It was like a Hollywood fin
ish out there," coach Leach
said. "You couldn't ask for a
better script, to watch your son
play for a national champi
onship."
"Coming in, I knew he was
tough," said Jon Leach, whose
1-2 record against Salzenstein
is the best losing record in ten
nis. "Fortunately for me, here
(at NCAAs) it's not the records
that matter. It's who is ready to
step up."
"Today, I knew it was going
to be a hell of a match," Salzen
stein said. "I was going to fight
my butt off to win, but it just
didn't work out.
"It's kind of a blur right
now."
But Gould stood firmly
behind Salzenstein, who will
now take the reins as the leader
of Stanford tennis with the
departure of Flanagan, Cocotos,
Devens and Patel.
"I'll tell you what, Jeff has
done a great job all year," Gould
said. "He's had the best year,
match in and match out of any
one on our team. I couldn't be
prouder. If there's anyone on
the line right there at the end,
he's the guy I want there."
For Stanford, it was only the
second loss in NCAA champi
onship finals.
With team competition
ended, individual and doubles
competition will begin. Today
12th-seeded Flanagan will face
Drake's Ross Nwachukwu,
unseeded Devens will encounter
Miami's Srdjan Muskotirovic
and unseeded Salzenstein will
play fifth-seed Mark Merklein
of Florida.
Doubles play begins tomor
