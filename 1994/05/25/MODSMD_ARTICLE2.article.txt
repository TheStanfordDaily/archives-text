# Tennis falls to USC in NCAAs
## Captures second place 
### Mike Langford Senior staff writer 
SOUTH BEND, Ind. — Close. So very close.
But unfortunately for the Stanford men's tennis
team, close is still the distance between first and
second place.
In what coaches and long-time tennis afi
cionados termed as perhaps the most exciting
final ever, USC beat Stanford 4-3 in the finals of
the NCAA Men's Tennis Championships yester
day at Notre Dame to claim the national title.
After a long season of points and predictions,
preparation and expectation, it came down to
one dual match. Even to the third set of the last
match. And the proverbial Promised Land was
just inches away at times.
The Cardinal had its chances for the win —
the match was as close as one point, at times. But
USC survived many close calls, supporting the
No. 1 ranking it has held since the middle of the
season.
"We were fortunate to win today," said USC
head coach Dick Leach. "Don't think I don't
know that."
Stanford finishes the year with a 25-3 record,
