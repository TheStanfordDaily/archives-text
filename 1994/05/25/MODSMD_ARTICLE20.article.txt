## Skip Schwartz Experiencing Germany creates a whole new perspective 
### 
HAMBURG, Germany — The Neo-
Nazis are everywhere.
You can't escape them. They are in the
subways, on the radio, their slogans are
plastered on the walls. They have even
taken over Burger King.
It is as if time has rewound itself 50
years and the Jews and every other minor
ity are once again being singled out and
are the objects of numerous racist attacks.
At least that was what many friends
and relatives of mine feared. Heard.
Assumed. When I told them that I was
planning on spending winter and spring
quarters in Germany, I was often asked if
I was scared. They had seen so much on
TV about the Germans' hatred of foreign
ers. And, of course, being a Jewish foreign
er myself, I was doubly at risk.
Why in the world would I want to go to
Germany?
I have to admit, I was a little nervous —
though more about being completely lost in
a new city and country, while still trying to
get a good grasp on the language, than
about confronting Neo-Nazism. But I knew
the possibility over here was present, just
like the possibility is there walking down
the street at home; the United States cer
tainly still has its share of problems with
the KKK, Aryan Nation and the like.
On the other hand, I also had seen the
news and heard the stories about the anti
foreigner violence over here. I knew that
those incidents were somewhat over-publi
cized, but this was Germany and there was
always that possibility
Well, after spending almost six months
here, I am happy (and not too surprised)
to say that I have made it through Ger
many Neo-Nazi free. I haven't personally
seen them or anything from them. In fact,

the advertisement last fall that was sent to
The Daily questioning the existence of the
Holocaust was the most striking example
of anti-Semitism I've seen in a long time.
There is even a wide-spread and strong
"gegen Nazis" campaign across Germany
and Europe, which has seemed to diminish
their presence and strength. It is also very
nice to see some of the abundant graffiti
taking political overtones: "Nazi raus" or
the popular stick figure placing a swastika
in a trash can. There are even Guardian
Angels here to do what they can to end the
racial tolerance.
"Schindler's List" played here with as
much critical acclaim and success as at
home. There were no protests or riots, as
Germans sat for five minutes in stunned
silence after the film was over. In fact, the
only negative comment I heard about the
film was the complaint from some that it
was just another attempt to not let the
Germans forget their past, while a few
others felt that Liam Neeson's portrayal of
Schindler was actually far nicer than the
typical businessman.
But just because I haven't seen any
problems doesn't mean all Germans are
able to totally live peacefully: a synagogue
was fire-bombed about two months ago
and there have been a couple of reports of
violence by radicals toward Turkish immi
grants, the people most often looked down
upon in German society.
It's incidents like the latter against for
eigners that make one realize some places
in Germany, especially in the East, still
have very narrow-minded ways of think
ing. In these places where unemployment
is still a big problem, many have found for
eigners a convenient scapegoat. Luckily for
the majority of Germans, these people are

an embarrassment to their country, as
shown when anti-Neo-Nazi demonstra
tions take place.
But the strongest racism here, unfortu
nately like anywhere, seems to have taken
a hidden form. It is certainly not confined
just to people with shaved heads who wear
all black leather and steel-toed combat
boots. In a few conversations I have had
with educated Germans, I have sometimes
heard comments regarding the Turks the
same way people talked about blacks 30
years ago. Or the way some people still,
without really thinking, degrade minori
ties today. Fortunately, these Germans are
the exception rather than the rule.
On the whole, things really are quite
normal over here. The situations I men
tioned have been unique. It is nice to rec
ognize that the acts of a few do not repre
sent the opinions on the whole. While the
racist words or incidents I did hear about
have been very far apart, I was quite sur
prised at something I saw in an advertise
ment for a special at McDonald's.
It had to do with the chain's "China
Weeks" that took place a couple of months
ago — allowing the hungry customer to
get their McNuggets with special Oriental
sauce or even get fried shrimp instead of
chicken. But what shocked me, as well as
many other Stanford students here, was
the fact that the center of the advertising
campaign was a caricature of the old,
"stereotypical" Chinaman. A yellow face
with long, slanted eyes and big buck teeth.
When some co-workers of mine and I
were talking about it, they did not really
see the problem with it. I was even more
surprised that it was a U.S. company
famous for "food, folks and fun" that ran
this ad. Maybe it is because at Stanford we

become super-aware of what is and what is
not politically correct. Or maybe some
times outsiders can have a better perspec
tive. Or maybe it is just another difference
in the thinking of our cultures that makes
the overseas experience so interesting.
So, that's one reason why I came to
Germany — to get beyond all the stories in
the news and find out what the Germans
were really like.
Things like the fact that all stores close
here by 6:30 p.m. on weekdays, 2 p.m. on
Saturdays and all day Sunday. The strong
belief the Germans have regarding the
sanctity of their abundance of bicycle
paths. The way they ring their little bell if
you violate that sacred space. The peculiar
habit Germans have to take their small
dogs with them everywhere.
And one never reallz appreciates how
often we use words with the letters "z" or
"y" until one tzpes on a German kezboard,
which has them switched.
And I never saw any "Entertainment
Tonight" or "MTV News" programs at
home on why David Hasselhoff has such a
large number of fans among the pre
pubescent female population as a singer.
All of these things one cannot learn in a
lecture or see on television. But that's not
to say the Germans don't know what we
are watching, as many shows from the
United States, including infomercials, are
dubbed for regular viewing. And many of
these shows are not doing the best for our
image either, as I was recently asked — in
all seriousness by a 17-year-old — if I had
my own gun, assuming that TV told the
truth about our way of life.
The fact that TV has such an impact on
lives and international opinions is fright
ening. Hasty generalizations are so easy

and simple to believe — for everyone.
It really is a shame that so many people
today, when they hear about Germany,
still think instantly about Nazism. Just as
it is a shame that when many Germans
hear about the United States, they think
of drugs and guns. If we could just find
some way to set the record straight, to
really come to understand our differences
and many similarities and get to know the
cultures and people. If everyone could
spend time abroad ...
I have been asked many times by Ger
mans why I took the time to study and
work here in Germany. I have a myriad of
reasons, one being so I could hopefully put
to rest my own misgivings and generalized
opinions. I am very glad that I can say
racism here as I saw it — or didn't see it
— is grossly exaggerated, but it exists, just
as misunderstandings, intolerance and
hatred of others exists at Stanford, in Ten
nessee and all over the United States.
Now, if we can just convince the Germans
that "Beavis and Butthead" is a bad repre
sentation of American adolescence and
that soccer really is popular in the U.S.
Studying abroad definitely gives some
one the chance to learn about a different
people and culture, but, at the same time
— and just as important — also gain a
new insight and understanding of our
own. It has been really nice to step back
from all the problems at home for a while
and to get to know the real Germany.
Besides, who needs good weather all the
time anyway?
