## Clinic posts strong results Helps in beginning 'miracle of life' in the laboratory 
### Mike Payne 
Fifteen percent of American
adults are unable to naturally con
ceive children, meaning that each
of us has a one in seven chance of
being infertile.
Fortunately, those select indi
viduals don't have to give up,
because hope is right around the
corner. Actually, it's right across
the street.
The Nova In Vitro Fertilization
Clinic in Palo Alto is the only
office-based in vitro fertilization
(IVF) clinic in Northern California
— the remaining 11 are affiliated
with major hospitals.
According to former Stanford
faculty member Dr. Francis Polan
sky who founded the clinic, Nova is
a very special place wrapped up in
a drab gray paint job. "We have the
miracle of life beginning in our
lab," said Polansky, who was also a
co-founder of Stanford's IVF pro
gram in 1985.
While the average national suc
cess rate for IVF procedures is 15.5
percent, Polansky and his staff of
five have maintained an average of
approximately 33 percent, placing
them in the top 12 among the
about 250 programs in the coun
try.
Despite Nova's head start on
the competition, Polansky admits
that there is room for improve
ment in any procedure with a 67
percent failure rate — a pressing
concern for all involved.
"This business is very stressful
for both the patient and the staff,"

Polansky said. "What other line of
medical work expects you to do a
perfect job and then have two
thirds of the subjects die?"
A single cycle of IVF treatment
at Nova costs in excess of $10,000
and, despite their relatively superi
or success rate, Polansky's staff
makes it clear to patients that
there are no guarantees for their
money. If it doesn't work the first
time, however, additional cycles
can increase the chance of becom
ing pregnant, he said. Out of 100
women, 76 are likely to achieve live
birth by the fourth procedure.
The costs are not defrayed by
most existing health plans, nor by
the proposed Clinton plan — a sore
point with Polansky. He prompts
his patients to write their con
gressmen requesting the inclusion
of "all infertility services, includ
ing In Vitro Fertilization," in any
health-care proposal.
In vitro fertilization is a multi
step process, and it is the medical
uncertainty associated with each
step that makes the outcome so
hard to predict. Stumbling blocks
include low-quality eggs or sperm,
biological reaction to increased
hormone levels, rejection of
implanted embryos and innumer
able other inexplicable causes.
In fact, mystery plays a surpris
ingly large part in IVF, accounting
for both failures and successes.
"IVF is a mixture of science and a
black box," Polansky said. "There
are factors we simply can't account
for."
He stressed that the laboratory

work involved in the procedure is
"very difficult," and is carried out
by trained specialists called
gamete embryologists.
Eve Shen, who has been work
ing with Polansky since 1985 at
Stanford, is the head embryologist
at Nova. She is responsible for the
manipulation and evaluation of
eggs, sperm and embryos under
the microscope. Polansky recog
nizes that the biggest bottleneck to
the success of IVF clinics is "a lack
of gamete embryologists."
"There is no school for them," he
said. "They must simply join a team
and learn." Polansky indicated that
cell culturing experience is an ideal
prerequisite for those wishing to
train as gamete embryologists.
The IVF procedure which
Polansky, Shen, biologist Marcia
Coyne and their associates carry
out begins two weeks prior to the
onset of the patient's menstrual
period. A variety of hormone-sim
ulating drugs are injected twice
daily for approximately five weeks,
serving to stimulate the matura
tion of multiple eggs and to pre
vent premature release of the eggs
from the ovaries.
Ultrasound scans and blood
tests are given frequently to deter
mine when the ovarian follicles
containing the ovum are mature.
At this time, an injection of the
hormone human chorionic
gonadotropin(hCG) is given to
stimulate the final maturation of
the eggs, which are subsequently
removed. The removal process,
which takes 5-20 minutes and is

non-surgical, involves aspiration of
the eggs from the follicles, much
like sucking them out with a straw.
The retrieved eggs are placed in
a petri dish and mixed with about
100,000 of the "highest quality"
sperm from a chosen donor. After
spending a night incubating in the
dish, each embryo is examined by
a gamete embryologist to deter
mine its health.
If everything has gone well to
this point, an average of 4-6 high
grade embryos will be transferred
with a catheter into the top of the
uterus. All that remains is to con
duct blood tests and ultrasound

scans to determine if one or more
of the embryos has implanted in
the uterine lining. If so, and a
heartbeat is discerned in the devel
oping embryo(s), there is a 90 per
cent chance live birth will result.
Despite the many pitfalls which
threaten the success of each IVF
procedure, the chances are
improving. Most of this improve
ment may be attributed to the fact
that more infertile women are
turning to IVF for help, and the
practice is becoming more refined.
"IVF has become more of a main
stream treatment for infertility,"
Polansky said.

However, ethical issues still
lurk, even in the minds of IVF pio
neers like Polansky. Citing the
world population problem as a per
tinent concern, he recognizes that
IVF "is not a clear-cut positive
thing."
"I don't know if what I do is the
right thing," he said. "But there's
the possibility that I could be
wrong if I tell couples that they
should not try IVF" as a last
resort.
But he added that "it's the pos
sibility that I could be wrong in
any doubts that I have which
makes it okay."

While the average national suc
cess rate for IVF procedures is 15.5
percent, Polansky and his staff of
five have maintained an average of
approximately 33 percent, placing
them in the top 12 among the
about 250 programs in the coun
try.
Despite Nova's head start on
the competition, Polansky admits
that there is room for improve
ment in any procedure with a 67
percent failure rate — a pressing
concern for all involved.
"This business is very stressful
for both the patient and the staff,"

Polansky said. "What other line of
medical work expects you to do a
perfect job and then have two
thirds of the subjects die?"
A single cycle of IVF treatment
at Nova costs in excess of $10,000
and, despite their relatively superi
or success rate, Polansky's staff
makes it clear to patients that
there are no guarantees for their
money. If it doesn't work the first
time, however, additional cycles
can increase the chance of becom
ing pregnant, he said. Out of 100
women, 76 are likely to achieve live
birth by the fourth procedure.
The costs are not defrayed by
most existing health plans, nor by
the proposed Clinton plan — a sore
point with Polansky. He prompts
his patients to write their con
gressmen requesting the inclusion
of "all infertility services, includ
ing In Vitro Fertilization," in any
health-care proposal.
In vitro fertilization is a multi
step process, and it is the medical
uncertainty associated with each
step that makes the outcome so
hard to predict. Stumbling blocks
include low-quality eggs or sperm,
biological reaction to increased
hormone levels, rejection of
implanted embryos and innumer
able other inexplicable causes.
In fact, mystery plays a surpris
ingly large part in IVF, accounting
for both failures and successes.
"IVF is a mixture of science and a
black box," Polansky said. "There
are factors we simply can't account
for."
He stressed that the laboratory

work involved in the procedure is
"very difficult," and is carried out
by trained specialists called
gamete embryologists.
Eve Shen, who has been work
ing with Polansky since 1985 at
Stanford, is the head embryologist
at Nova. She is responsible for the
manipulation and evaluation of
eggs, sperm and embryos under
the microscope. Polansky recog
nizes that the biggest bottleneck to
the success of IVF clinics is "a lack
of gamete embryologists."
"There is no school for them," he
said. "They must simply join a team
and learn." Polansky indicated that
cell culturing experience is an ideal
prerequisite for those wishing to
train as gamete embryologists.
The IVF procedure which
Polansky, Shen, biologist Marcia
Coyne and their associates carry
out begins two weeks prior to the
onset of the patient's menstrual
period. A variety of hormone-sim
ulating drugs are injected twice
daily for approximately five weeks,
serving to stimulate the matura
tion of multiple eggs and to pre
vent premature release of the eggs
from the ovaries.
Ultrasound scans and blood
tests are given frequently to deter
mine when the ovarian follicles
containing the ovum are mature.
At this time, an injection of the
hormone human chorionic
gonadotropin(hCG) is given to
stimulate the final maturation of
the eggs, which are subsequently
removed. The removal process,
which takes 5-20 minutes and is

non-surgical, involves aspiration of
the eggs from the follicles, much
like sucking them out with a straw.
The retrieved eggs are placed in
a petri dish and mixed with about
100,000 of the "highest quality"
sperm from a chosen donor. After
spending a night incubating in the
dish, each embryo is examined by
a gamete embryologist to deter
mine its health.
If everything has gone well to
this point, an average of 4-6 high
grade embryos will be transferred
with a catheter into the top of the
uterus. All that remains is to con
duct blood tests and ultrasound

scans to determine if one or more
of the embryos has implanted in
the uterine lining. If so, and a
heartbeat is discerned in the devel
oping embryo(s), there is a 90 per
cent chance live birth will result.
Despite the many pitfalls which
threaten the success of each IVF
procedure, the chances are
improving. Most of this improve
ment may be attributed to the fact
that more infertile women are
turning to IVF for help, and the
practice is becoming more refined.
"IVF has become more of a main
stream treatment for infertility,"
Polansky said.

However, ethical issues still
lurk, even in the minds of IVF pio
neers like Polansky. Citing the
world population problem as a per
tinent concern, he recognizes that
IVF "is not a clear-cut positive
thing."
"I don't know if what I do is the
right thing," he said. "But there's
the possibility that I could be
wrong if I tell couples that they
should not try IVF" as a last
resort.
But he added that "it's the pos
sibility that I could be wrong in
any doubts that I have which
makes it okay."

Fifteen percent of American
adults are unable to naturally con
ceive children, meaning that each
of us has a one in seven chance of
being infertile.
Fortunately, those select indi
viduals don't have to give up,
because hope is right around the
corner. Actually, it's right across
the street.
The Nova In Vitro Fertilization
Clinic in Palo Alto is the only
office-based in vitro fertilization
(IVF) clinic in Northern California
— the remaining 11 are affiliated
with major hospitals.
According to former Stanford
faculty member Dr. Francis Polan
sky who founded the clinic, Nova is
a very special place wrapped up in
a drab gray paint job. "We have the
miracle of life beginning in our
lab," said Polansky, who was also a
co-founder of Stanford's IVF pro
gram in 1985.

cess rate for IVF procedures is 15.5
