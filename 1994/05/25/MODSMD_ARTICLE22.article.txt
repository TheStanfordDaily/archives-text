# Prof studies environmental dangers
## Population growth one of many factors 
### Corinna Wu 
The destruction of the environment
has been closely linked to the rapid
increase of the world's population in
recent years, but population growth does
not tell the whole story, according to
scholars who participated in a conference
on environmental rights, human rights
and economic issues held at Stanford this
month.
"Population growth is certainly embed
ded in a social, economic and political con
text," said anthropology professor
William Durham. "No one questions the
contributions of population growth to the
world's dilemmas, but what we're trying
to point out is that there are other things
that are more important and growing at a
faster rate."
According to Durham, population
growth needs to be examined in the con
text of other trends — per capita energy
consumption, for example. "In a lot of the
developed world, there's an inverse rela
tionship between rates of population
increase and rates of resource consump
tion and general impact on the world envi
ronment," he said.
One of the many reasons for the
overemphasis on population growth as
the cause of environmental problems may
be a simple case of "finger-pointing." Cit
ing per-capita energy consumption as the
cause "points the finger at us" while citing
population increase focuses on countries
mainly in the Third World.
"The problems don't come home as
quickly, but of course they still come
home," Durham said.
Also, when less-tangible social factors
affecting population increase such as
poverty and distribution of wealth are not
well understood, it is often easier to study
the demography than the more complex
issues influencing fertility rates.
The conference highlighted the need
for more multi-disciplinary, coordinated
work to be done. At Stanford, several

working groups have crystallized through
the Institute for International Studies.
Durham, who is the Bing Professor in
Human Biology, is part of a team that has
research interests in the tropical rain
forests in Chiapas, in the southern part of
Mexico. Durham focuses on the migration
patterns of the local people andon map
ping them to deforestation in the area.
The people of the region traditionally
have lived in los altos, or the highlands,
Durham said. Over the past 20 to 30
years, they have migrated out of the high
lands into the rain forest areas known as
"El Ocote" and "El Triumfo."
"The movement of migrants out of
Chiapas does not appear to be a direct
response to population increase or compe
tition for land," said Durham. In contrast,
the reasons for this migration are a com
plex blend of religious, economic and
social pressures.
Religious differences between people in
the area have been known for a long time
but have only recently manifested them
selves in migration out of the highlands.
"One can never say that population
growth is unrelated to this," Durham

said. "But what is most important is that
the religious dynamics are the most
salient ones in the hearts and minds of the
migrants."
El Ocote is a biosphere reserve — an
area set aside by government agencies and
other organizations based on its "eco
tourism" and biodiversity value. A buffer
zone, which has been designated around
the reserve, is supposed to be an area of
mixed utilization where limited human
use is permitted.
On a brief reconnaissance flight, how
ever, the buffer looked like "pure pas
ture," according to Durham, with many
square miles of cleared forest.
El Triumfo is a different kind of forest
known as a cloud forest. It is the north
ernmost habitat of the quetzal, a tropical
bird. "It is my impression that the whole
scheme — the core and the buffer zone —
is laid out administratively with little or
no representation of local folks," Durham
said.
"One of the great challenges of the
region, if not the world, is to solve two


Jeff Sorrentino — Daily
equations at once," he said.
"How can you conserve the bio
diversity of these remaining for
est areas — crucial in terms of

their genetic resources, crucial
in terms of their ecosystem ser
vices for the planet — and meet
the demands of the human pop
ulations, realizing they have
rights and entitlements to eco
nomic developments and pur
suit of a decent standard of liv
ing?"

Though his research is still in
its early stages, Durham sug
gests one short-term solution —
channeling revenue from eco
tourism to help the local com
munity, and creating systems of
sustainable agriculture and tim
bering such as the buffer zones
in the biosphere reserves today.
