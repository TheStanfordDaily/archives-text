# Stopping cancer's advance
## Protein inhibits tumors from spreading 
### Michael Slemmer Editorial staff 
Usually, when a person or animal is
afflicted with cancer, the diseased cells
eventually circulate throughout the blood
stream — causing widespread damage to
the body.
And once this condition is reached,
there is little that doctors can do locally to
stop cancer's devastating effects. This
fact has led researchers to look for solu
tions involving limiting the spread of
infected cells and thereby allowing effec
tive, localized treatment.
In a recently released study on mice,
Irving Weissman, a professor of patholo
gy at the School of Medicine, said that a
protein has been found on the surface of
cells that might just achieve the desired
effect — stifling the spread of tumors.

Specifically, Weissman's research
group looked at how the protein affects
the spread of melanoma, a type of skin
cancer, but they believe the results may be
applicable to other forms of solid tumors.
According to Weissman, they also hope
that the experiment will eventually aid in
finding ways to stop the vast proliferation of
cancerous cells — a prime factor in killing
patients with various forms of the disease.
Certain characteristics of the proteins
led the researchers to consider it as a can
didate for entrapping tumors in this man
ner. Ordinarily, within the body, it can be
found on white blood cells, allowing them
to grab hold of inflamed blood ves ols.
Seeing this, they tried using the pro
teins to attach the tumors to each other in
order to prevent them from moving into
the bloodstream and spreading through
out the body. To test their theory, they

injected tumor cells engineered to produce
the proteins into the skin of the mice.
Because the proteins exhibited this
"sticking" property, Weissman said the
mobility of the tumors which grew in
mice injected with the protein-laden
melanoma was much lower than that in a
control group — carrying the tumor cells
without the protein.
Though this approach seemed to help
prevent the cancer's spread in mice, post
doctoral fellow Fang Qian said that they
"still have a long waj' to go . . . several
years, at least" before preventative
approaches may be available for humans.
The research may not be imrn ihfoly
applicable to fighting cancer in humans,
but Weissman said it marks one of the
first steps in developing ways to find
drugs which "stop invasive behavior of
tumor cells."
