## Dispersion of light turns the sky blue

✓""V: Why is the sky blue?
— Anonymous
A: Although most preschoolers
probably ask their teachers this
question in between playing in
the sandbox and eating the paste, the
answer is not that simple.
In fact, the answer wasn't really
known until the 1800s, when Lord
John William Rayleigh explained
"Rayleigh scattering" (what a coinci
dence).
So what exactly is Rayleigh scatter
ing? Well, the simplest way to think
about it is that when a beam of light
passes through a bunch of particles
(such as molecules in the air), some of
the light passes straight through.
Some of the light, however, bounces
off the molecules and starts heading
in all different, pretty much random
directions.
Rayleigh showed that the higher
the frequency of light (the closer it is
to the blue end of the spectrum) the
more likely it is to get scattered
rather than passing straight
through.
Actually, this is a somewhat simpli
fied explanation. A more precise
description has to do with the fact
that light is actually made up of elec
tromagnetic waves — oscillating elec
tric and magnetic fields.
When these waves run into a
molecule, they start shaking the elec
trons in the molecule up and down.
These wiggling electrons in turn start
putting out electromagnetic waves of
their own.
However, this light isn't neces
sarily in the same direction as the
original incoming wave. Presto! The
light has been scattered into all
directions.
If you care to do out the mathe
matics behind this (which I assume
Rayleigh was willing to do), you find
that higher frequencies are better at
wiggling the electrons up and down.
So blue light is indeed scattered
more.
So now that you know all you care
to about Rayleigh and his scattering,
what does this have to do with the
sky? Wei l , if we had no atmosphere,
the sky would be black, except where
the sun is (you notice this in pictures
taken from the moon).
This is because light travels in

straight lines, so light won't come
from a point in the sky unless there is
something there sending out light.
However, we do have an atmo
sphere, so as light comes in from the
sun, it is scattered by air molecules.
Some of this light bounces off differ
ent parts of the sky, and then comes
into your eye. So you end up seeing
light at points other than where the
sun is. And since blue light is scat
tered more than other colors, we end
up seeing blue all over the sky.
This same process helps explain
why we get those rosy sunsets you
take your date up to the Dish to see.
When you look near the horizon, you
are looking through a lot more of the
atmosphere.
So when the sun is low, the light
coming at you has had a lot of oppor
tunities to be scattered. Because blue
light is scattered more easily, it isn't
as likely to have made it through as
red or orange light. So near the sun
you are much more likely to see beau
tiful reddish hues.
Clouds higher up in the sky appear
red around sunset because they are
reflecting the reddish light from down
closer to the horizon. They may even
appear purple, due to the combination
of this red light with the usual blue
color of the sky.
All kinds of dust and pollutants in
the air also cause scattering. If the
particles are small enough, they will
follow the same rules as Rayleigh
scattering, whereas larger particles
will scatter other colors or may even
absorb certain colors, producing
unpredictable effects in terms of sky
color.
Thus, after forest fires or volca
noes, sunsets can be even more spec
tacular with different, and more
brilliant, colors.
So during the day we see the scat
tered light from the sun, which looks
blue, while at sunset we are looking
at the light from the sun minus the
light that is scattered, so it looks red
dish.
Of course, if you want to under
stand this more fully, it may help to
spend some time during finals week
lying out on the grass and staring up
at the sky. I 11 see you out there.
