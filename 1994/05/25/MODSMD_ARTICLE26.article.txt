# No. 4 linksters set sights on NCAA title
## Women's golf heads to Oregon to tee off against nation's top 18 teams 
### Seth Goldstein Staff writer 
Despite its No. 4 national ranking, the
Stanford women's golf team still has one
blemish on its record — the lack of a tourna
ment title.
Second and third place finishes abound,
but the squad has been unable to capture a
definitive win. It has one last chance to do so
at the NCAA Women's Golf Championships
at the Oregon Golf Club in West Linn, Ore.
tomorrow through Saturday. And there
couldn't be a better time to erase the blem
ish.
No. 1 Arizona State and second-ranked
San Jose State lead the field of the top 18
teams in the nation. Pac-10 rivals like No. 5
USC and No. 6 UCLA, as well as eastern
powerhouses including regional champion
Wake Forest and No. 3 Duke, will battle with
the Cardinal for the national title.

Stanford head coach Tim Baldwin says
that it will be business as usual for Stanford.
The contest's importance will not affect the
team's preparation.
"He (Baldwin) has us going to this tour
nament just like any other — to play the
very best we can," said junior Jamille Jose.
But will this be good enough to win?
While Baldwin feels that this team is "the
best [Stanford has] ever had," he knows that
there are more powerful squads out there.
"It's a tough year to have your best team
ever, because both ASU and San Jose have
their best teams ever as well," he said.
"They've proven throughout the season that
they're in a league of their own. Both of
these teams have inspired us to better play."
This does not cause the golfers to lose
faith. As freshman Andrea Baxter pointed
out, no opponent is invincible.
"We've beaten both of them (Arizona
State and San Jose State)," she said. "As the

year went along, we narrowed the gap. Now
we have a final opportunity to pass them
by."
The Cardinal may be helped in its quest
by the golf course itself. Located in a suburb
of Portland and designed by golfer Peter
Jacobsen, the Oregon Golf Club is built
around the base of a mountain. The result is
a hilly, up-and-down course with extremely
long holes.
"It's the longest course we've played all
year in terms of yards," said Baldwin. "This
will help us. All of our women can really hit
the ball. It should not cause us as much trou
ble as some of the other teams."
Another factor will be fatigue. The four
day, 72-hole tournament is also the longest
in terms of time and holes that Stanford has
played in. Baldwin believes that the champi
onships are a test of strength and endurance
as well as ability and that a key to
winning is to keep the golfers well
rested.
The golfers themselves are not
too worried about endurance. The
intense pressure of the competition
is their mayor concern.
'It's more a question
of nerves. Can we
deal with the stress
of four rounds?'
— Vicky Strada
"I don't think physical exhaus
tion should be much of a problem,"
sophomore Vicky Strada said. "It's
more a question of nerves. Can we
deal with the stress of four rounds?"
For Melinda Daniels, it will be the
last time she has to cope with this
stress in a Stanford uniform. The
senior will play her final college
holes on Saturday.
"It's a sad thing. I really enjoyed
my career here," she said. "But at
the same time I know I have to move
on. I just hope that I can help the
team as much as possible this last
time out."
Freshman Mhairi McKay will
join Daniels, Jose, Strada and Baxter
to complete Stanford's five-player
entry into the championships.
McKay, the sixth-ranked player in
the nation, will be expected to lead
the team on the greens.
"She has the potential to be the
greatest player in the history of
Stanford," Baldwin said. "And she
also has the support of a high-caliber
group of women. She has the chance
to be a great individual on a great
team."
