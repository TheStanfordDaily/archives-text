# Throwers deliver triple power punch to track
## Popejoy, McCormick and Templeton lead Cardinal 
### Jorge Chen Staff writer 
The power displayed by the Stanford track
and field's top three throwers runs deeper than
do their performances on the field. This
strength is matched by personal leadership,
which has guided the Cardinal to impressive
conference finishes at the conclusion of this
year's outdoor season.
"The throwers this year have been the back
bone for our team," said Stanford head coach
Vin Lananna.
Junior co-captain Dave Popejoy is a main
part of that backbone, as he holds the 1992
Pacific 10 Conference title in the hammer.
Hailing from Monte Sereno, a suburb of San
Jose, Popejoy began his hammer career at the
end of eighth grade under the guidance of Ed
Burke, the director of a summer track camp and
a three-time Olympian in the hammer.
Burke kept his student under his wing
throughout Popejoy's time at Beilarmine High
School, where the thrower earned two All-
American honors in the event.
"If it wasn't for Ed Burke, I would probably
wouldn't be throwing today," Popejoy said.
However, Popejoy didn't begin his sports
career as a track athlete. "I had wrestled since I
was seven but I decided to stick to track since
wrestling and football were too intense and
track is at a nice time of the year," he said.
Popejoy decided to make his crucial switch
once at Stanford due to the high physical
demands of wrestling and football, which led to
three knee surgeries in high school.
Despite Popejoy's impressive accomplish
ments during his first three years at Stanford,
he knows there are many personal goals as well
as higher levels of competition he has yet to
achieve.
Popejoy is currently sixth in the United
States, and is hoping to be in the top two for the
Pan American Games, in the World University
Games and maybe on the 1996 Olympic team,
he said.
Fulfilling these aims means overcoming sev
eral unsatisfactory showings this year, as Pope
joy's longest mark before Pac-lOs was only 225
feet 1 inch. He feels he has not yet reached his
full potential and hopes to surpass the 230'
mark by the end of the season.

Last weekend's showing of 229'5" in the Pac
-10 Championships indicate that he is closing in
on this goal. He helped lead the team to fifth
place, a vast improvement from a last-place fin
ish the previous season. His contributions to the
team include more than just this solid athleti
cism, however.

"To maintain a strong track program, one
must have outstanding leadership, and both
Dave and Jenn (McCormick) have provided that
for the team as captains and as national leaders
in their individual events," Lananna said.
