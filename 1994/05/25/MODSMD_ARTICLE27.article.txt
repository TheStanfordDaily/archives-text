# Throwers deliver triple power punch to track
## Popejoy, McCormick and Templeton lead Cardinal 
### Jorge Chen Staff writer 
The power displayed by the Stanford track
and field's top three throwers runs deeper than
do their performances on the field. This
strength is matched by personal leadership,
which has guided the Cardinal to impressive
conference finishes at the conclusion of this
year's outdoor season.
"The throwers this year have been the back
bone for our team," said Stanford head coach
Vin Lananna.
Junior co-captain Dave Popejoy is a main
part of that backbone, as he holds the 1992
Pacific 10 Conference title in the hammer.
Hailing from Monte Sereno, a suburb of San
Jose, Popejoy began his hammer career at the
end of eighth grade under the guidance of Ed
Burke, the director of a summer track camp and
a three-time Olympian in the hammer.
Burke kept his student under his wing
throughout Popejoy's time at Beilarmine High
School, where the thrower earned two All-
American honors in the event.
"If it wasn't for Ed Burke, I would probably
wouldn't be throwing today," Popejoy said.
However, Popejoy didn't begin his sports
career as a track athlete. "I had wrestled since I
was seven but I decided to stick to track since
wrestling and football were too intense and
track is at a nice time of the year," he said.
Popejoy decided to make his crucial switch
once at Stanford due to the high physical
demands of wrestling and football, which led to
three knee surgeries in high school.
Despite Popejoy's impressive accomplish
ments during his first three years at Stanford,
he knows there are many personal goals as well
as higher levels of competition he has yet to
achieve.
Popejoy is currently sixth in the United
States, and is hoping to be in the top two for the
Pan American Games, in the World University
Games and maybe on the 1996 Olympic team,
he said.
Fulfilling these aims means overcoming sev
eral unsatisfactory showings this year, as Pope
joy's longest mark before Pac-lOs was only 225
feet 1 inch. He feels he has not yet reached his
full potential and hopes to surpass the 230'
mark by the end of the season.

Last weekend's showing of 229'5" in the Pac
-10 Championships indicate that he is closing in
on this goal. He helped lead the team to fifth
place, a vast improvement from a last-place fin
ish the previous season. His contributions to the
team include more than just this solid athleti
cism, however.

"To maintain a strong track program, one
must have outstanding leadership, and both
Dave and Jenn (McCormick) have provided that
for the team as captains and as national leaders
in their individual events," Lananna said.

Hammer throwers Dave Popejoy and Debbie Templeton and javelin thrower Jenn
McCormick clown around on the Stanford Stadium field.
Senior hammer thrower Debbie
Templeton recalls a memorable
incident demonstrating Popejoy's
leadership.
"One day the bus broke down
and Dave stepped up to lead every
one out of the bus by shouting like
a general in the military, 'OK,
everyone line up in a straight line
and slowly walk out of the bus.' We
all gave him the nickname Papa
Popejoy from then on," Templeton
said.
While Papa Popejoy has directed
the men's team this season, senior
javelin thrower McCormick has
done the same for the women.
Another local athlete from Hillsbor
ough, Calif., the senior is currently
ranked second in the United States
with a landing of 179' 5" which
earned her the conference crown
this past weekend at the champi
onships.
"She is a dynamic athlete," said
Lananna.
During her days at San Mateo
High School, McCormick began her
track career in the shot put, discus
and sprints. "I swam, ran and
threw; however, I wasn't a conspic
uous athlete in high school," she
said.
Before coming to Stanford, she
spent her first two collegiate sea
sons at College of San Mateo, where

she placed fourth in her freshman
year and second in the following
year at the California Junior Col
lege State Meet. McCormick still
holds College of San Mateo's record
of 154' 10".
In her fourth year as a thrower,
McCormick credits her javelin suc
cess to pure hard work.
"I think I'm interesting since
here at Stanford there are so many
stellar athletes with natural innate
talents, except for me — I worked at
it," McCormick said.
Fueled by this determination,
McCormick, like Popejoy, hopes to
participate in the Pan American
Games and in the World University
Games held in Japan in '95.
However, she sees the NCAA
Championships as the first rung of
the ladder as she is entering this
year's competition with an Ail-
American honor already under her
belt. "I would like to win NCAAs or
at least come in the top three and
move on from there," she said.
While these goals may seem
lofty, Templeton said she has com
plete faith in her teammate, as
McCormick has proven herself to be
someone who is able to accomplish
whatever she sets her mind to.
"The season began and many
new athletes had to write down
their personal collegiate goals,"
Templeton said. "I remembered
Jenn writing down 172' for the
hammer and I began to laugh.
However, after a couple of months I

saw her accomplishing it, so I will
never doubt her abilities."
In the future, besides training
locally, McCormick plans to head
off to physical therapy school.
Another female thrower who
also provides support as part cf the
team's backbone is Templeton, the
current national leader in the ham
mer with a throw of 178' 3" at the
Mt. Sac Invitational earlier this
year. This showing is the fourth all
time best collegiate throw in the
United States.
As Templeton's first coach in the
hammer last summer, Popejoy said,
"Deb picked up the hammer faster
than anyone I've ever seen. She is
extremely powerful."
Hailing from Redway, Calif.,
Templeton was the only athlete
coming out of Southfork High
School to succeed in collegiate
sports.
Before picking up the hammer
from Popejoy, Templeton was
recruited by many colleges to
become a heptathlete due to her
multi-talents in almost all events in
high school track.
"My town has about 1,200 peo
ple and only 300 high schoolers, so
sports weren't a big thing for any
one there," Templeton said.
"Therefore, I did almost all the
events for my high school track
team to pick up points."
Similar to McCormick, Temple
ton also credits her talents to her
hard work at Stanford.

"When I got to Stanford, I didn't
expect anything except for doing
OK by my senior year," she said.
"But I have to put lots of effort and
time to improve in my new event."
Templeton also hopes to take
part in the same international
meets as Popejoy and McCormick
but she is focusing first on another
goal.
"I want to break the American
record in the hammer held by Stan
ford alumnus Carol Cady, which
stands at 193' 4"," Templeton said.
Ironically, it was Cady who recruit
ed Templeton to join the Cardinal
track squad four years ago.
Popejoy foresees Templeton
reaching that milestone earlier
than she might expect.
"There is a lot of room for
improvement for Deb since she is a
novice in the event,"he said. "If she
works hard to perfect her throws,
she will break that record very
soon."
Broken records seem the norm
for these three. For Popejoy and
McCormick, the next opportunity
will arise at the NCAA Champi
onships, to be held June 1-4 in
Boise, Idaho. Templeton will join
them at the U.S. Nationals held
June 16-18 in Knoxville, Tenn., as
the NCAAs do not include her
event.
As each thrower approaches the
meets with his or her own goals in
mind, the power which character
izes them all will surely be felt.

stands at 193' 4"," Templeton said.
Ironically, it was Cady who recruit
ed Templeton to join the Cardinal
track squad four years ago.
Popejoy foresees Templeton
reaching that milestone earlier
than she might expect.
"There is a lot of room for
improvement for Deb since she is a
novice in the event,"he said. "If she
works hard to perfect her throws,
she will break that record very
soon."
Broken records seem the norm
for these three. For Popejoy and
McCormick, the next opportunity
will arise at the NCAA Champi
onships, to be held June 1-4 in
Boise, Idaho. Templeton will join
them at the U.S. Nationals held
June 16-18 in Knoxville, Tenn., as
the NCAAs do not include her
event.
As each thrower approaches the
meets with his or her own goals in
mind, the power which character
izes them all will surely be felt.
The power displayed by the Stanford track
and field's top three throwers runs deeper than
do their performances on the field. This
strength is matched by personal leadership,
which has guided the Cardinal to impressive
conference finishes at the conclusion of this
year's outdoor season.
"The throwers this year have been the back
bone for our team," said Stanford head coach
Vin Lananna.
Junior co-captain Dave Popejoy is a main
part of that backbone, as he holds the 1992
Pacific 10 Conference title in the hammer.
Hailing from Monte Sereno, a suburb of San
Jose, Popejoy began his hammer career at the
end of eighth grade under the guidance of Ed
Burke, the director of a summer track camp and
a three-time Olympian in the hammer.
Burke kept his student under his wing
throughout Popejoy's time at Beilarmine High
School, where the thrower earned two All-
American honors in the event.
"If it wasn't for Ed Burke, I would probably
wouldn't be throwing today," Popejoy said.
However, Popejoy didn't begin his sports
career as a track athlete. "I had wrestled since I
was seven but I decided to stick to track since
wrestling and football were too intense and
track is at a nice time of the year," he said.
Popejoy decided to make his crucial switch
once at Stanford due to the high physical
demands of wrestling and football, which led to
three knee surgeries in high school.
Despite Popejoy's impressive accomplish
ments during his first three years at Stanford,
he knows there are many personal goals as well
as higher levels of competition he has yet to
achieve.
Popejoy is currently sixth in the United
States, and is hoping to be in the top two for the
Pan American Games, in the World University
Games and maybe on the 1996 Olympic team,
he said.
Fulfilling these aims means overcoming sev
eral unsatisfactory showings this year, as Pope
joy's longest mark before Pac-lOs was only 225
feet 1 inch. He feels he has not yet reached his
full potential and hopes to surpass the 230'
mark by the end of the season.

Last weekend's showing of 229'5" in the Pac
-10 Championships indicate that he is closing in
on this goal. He helped lead the team to fifth
place, a vast improvement from a last-place fin
ish the previous season. His contributions to the
team include more than just this solid athleti
cism, however.

"To maintain a strong track program, one
must have outstanding leadership, and both
Dave and Jenn (McCormick) have provided that
for the team as captains and as national leaders
in their individual events," Lananna said.

Hammer throwers Dave Popejoy and Debbie Templeton and javelin thrower Jenn
McCormick clown around on the Stanford Stadium field.
Senior hammer thrower Debbie
Templeton recalls a memorable
incident demonstrating Popejoy's
leadership.
"One day the bus broke down
and Dave stepped up to lead every
one out of the bus by shouting like
a general in the military, 'OK,
everyone line up in a straight line
and slowly walk out of the bus.' We
all gave him the nickname Papa
Popejoy from then on," Templeton
said.
While Papa Popejoy has directed
the men's team this season, senior
javelin thrower McCormick has
done the same for the women.
Another local athlete from Hillsbor
ough, Calif., the senior is currently
ranked second in the United States
with a landing of 179' 5" which
earned her the conference crown
this past weekend at the champi
onships.
"She is a dynamic athlete," said
Lananna.
During her days at San Mateo
High School, McCormick began her
track career in the shot put, discus
and sprints. "I swam, ran and
threw; however, I wasn't a conspic
uous athlete in high school," she
said.
Before coming to Stanford, she
spent her first two collegiate sea
sons at College of San Mateo, where

she placed fourth in her freshman
year and second in the following
year at the California Junior Col
lege State Meet. McCormick still
holds College of San Mateo's record
of 154' 10".
In her fourth year as a thrower,
McCormick credits her javelin suc
cess to pure hard work.
"I think I'm interesting since
here at Stanford there are so many
stellar athletes with natural innate
talents, except for me — I worked at
it," McCormick said.
Fueled by this determination,
McCormick, like Popejoy, hopes to
participate in the Pan American
Games and in the World University
Games held in Japan in '95.
However, she sees the NCAA
Championships as the first rung of
the ladder as she is entering this
year's competition with an Ail-
American honor already under her
belt. "I would like to win NCAAs or
at least come in the top three and
move on from there," she said.
While these goals may seem
lofty, Templeton said she has com
plete faith in her teammate, as
McCormick has proven herself to be
someone who is able to accomplish
whatever she sets her mind to.
"The season began and many
new athletes had to write down
their personal collegiate goals,"
Templeton said. "I remembered
Jenn writing down 172' for the
hammer and I began to laugh.
However, after a couple of months I

saw her accomplishing it, so I will
never doubt her abilities."
In the future, besides training
locally, McCormick plans to head
off to physical therapy school.
Another female thrower who
also provides support as part cf the
team's backbone is Templeton, the
current national leader in the ham
mer with a throw of 178' 3" at the
Mt. Sac Invitational earlier this
year. This showing is the fourth all
time best collegiate throw in the
United States.
As Templeton's first coach in the
hammer last summer, Popejoy said,
"Deb picked up the hammer faster
than anyone I've ever seen. She is
extremely powerful."
Hailing from Redway, Calif.,
Templeton was the only athlete
coming out of Southfork High
School to succeed in collegiate
sports.
Before picking up the hammer
from Popejoy, Templeton was
recruited by many colleges to
become a heptathlete due to her
multi-talents in almost all events in
high school track.
"My town has about 1,200 peo
ple and only 300 high schoolers, so
sports weren't a big thing for any
one there," Templeton said.
"Therefore, I did almost all the
events for my high school track
team to pick up points."
Similar to McCormick, Temple
ton also credits her talents to her
hard work at Stanford.

"When I got to Stanford, I didn't
expect anything except for doing
OK by my senior year," she said.
"But I have to put lots of effort and
time to improve in my new event."
Templeton also hopes to take
part in the same international
meets as Popejoy and McCormick
but she is focusing first on another
goal.
"I want to break the American
record in the hammer held by Stan
ford alumnus Carol Cady, which
stands at 193' 4"," Templeton said.
Ironically, it was Cady who recruit
ed Templeton to join the Cardinal
track squad four years ago.
