# Enough already
## Media sensationalism should be constrained 
### 
Ever since Watergate, the
media have considered
scandal their meat and
potatoes. Sometimes there is
legitimate wrongdoing. Other
times minor events become
transformed into trials of epic
proportions, with the press serv
ing as witness, jury, judge and
executioner. Always, it seems,
the negative focus overshadows
the reporting of positive
achievements. Many accom
plishments go unnoticed alto
gether.
And so it was with last week's
events on this campus. Eight
varsity athletes, in the midst of
drunken revelry, allegedly ven
tured near the Quad and dam
aged a fixture.
On any other campus, this
would hardly be big news.
Maybe a paragraph, nothing
more. Even at Stanford, if the
intoxicated people had not been
athletes, there probably would
not be such a fuss. But since the
offenders were athletes, it was,
if I may say so, a whole different
ballgame. For this incident pro
vided a chance to complain
about one of this campus' last
bastions of veritable tradition
which had heretofore been rela
tively untainted by the vicissi
tudes of campus politics: the
Department of Athletics.
Journalists, especially at this
newspaper, foamed at the
mouth to peg the athletes with
banner headlines — on the front
page — in their self-anointed
role as crusaders for "justice."
For seven days now the story
has been hashed and rehashed
below the masthead.
So some athletes got carried
away celebrating the baseball
team's Six-Pac Championship.
Big deal. Perhaps, in their ine
briated state, the athletes mis
took the figures for Bill Walsh
and Mark Marquess and decided
to give them what they thought
was a Gatorade bath.
Now that the senseless act
has been committed, have some
one clean off the statue. Have
the individuals pay for the dam
ages. Maybe even have them
take an "Art Appreciation"
class.
Damaging property is wrong.
It was a sophomoric act commit
ted by some sophomores. Noth
ing more.
But press felony charges?
Please.
The fact is, had it been any
other fixture, this story would
not be a big deal. This past fall,
Cal students damaged other
campus fixtures and were not
charged. Where were the
reporters when athletic facilities
were vandalized this year? Ask

the artist who did the billboard
on El Camino how he felt when
his painting of Bill Walsh's head
was chopped off. And what about
the large red Stanford "S," the
veritable symbol of Stanford ath
letics, that was stolen from the
Sunken Diamond scoreboard
two months ago?
However, as the thinking
goes, because this fixture in par
ticular was involved, an uproar
was not only justified but
expected. It was another chance
for the tiring rhetoric of victim
ization to be invoked.
It is interesting that no one
bothered to report on the many
positive things Stanford ath
letes have done recently. Just
last week, several dozen athletes
participated in the "Youth
Olympics" for impoverished
children from East Palo Alto.
Obviously, that story was too
positive to be newsworthy.
Not surprisingly, the fact
that swimmer Jenny Thompson
was nominated for the Sullivan
Award, presented to the
nation's outstanding amateur
athlete, continues to escape the
front page. Likewise for the
news that Stanford again leads
the nation in NCAA team titles
(three so far in 1993-94). Or
how about a story revealing that
in the past 15 years, the Cardi
nal has racked up 39 NCAA
team titles, more than any other
school in the country?
Instead, the story that was
deemed worthy of coverage was
made out to be far worse than it
actually was. And it was this
sensationalism that catapulted
the story into USA Today, CNN,
ESPN's Sports Center, and the
Associated Press dispatch.
Reporters are hoping to
transfer outrage at these indi
viduals into outrage towards the
groups with which they are
associated. Some people are
using individual wrongs to blud
geon a group they dislike. Con
stantly, the fact that the individ
uals are athletes is mentioned.
Ask yourself: If the individuals
were members of the string sec
tion of the orchestra, would they
be receiving the same scrutiny?
Would their extracurricular
activity be relevant?

What really puts a black eye on
our athletic program are the stu
dents who are so busy complaining
about everything "that is wrong"
with the University that they fail
to support Stanford's teams, leav
ing the bleachers empty at many a
home game. Maybe if people

stopped protesting long enough to
emphasize Stanford's collective
achievements rather than search
ing for collective shame, this insti
tution would prosper.
As it stands right now, depart
ing athletic administrators Tom
Beckett (to Yale), Gene Washing
ton (to the NFL) and Keith Sparks
(to the corporate world) must be
smiling because they are leaving
this place and the ridiculousness of
many of its inhabitants.

It is time for Stanford students
to concentrate on beating Cal
rather than beating on each other.
Then maybe people won't scowl as
much each day when they pick up
The Daily to read.
Report the good once in a while.
That's all I ask.

What really puts a black eye on
our athletic program are the stu
dents who are so busy complaining
about everything "that is wrong"
with the University that they fail
to support Stanford's teams, leav
ing the bleachers empty at many a
home game. Maybe if people

stopped protesting long enough to
emphasize Stanford's collective
achievements rather than search
ing for collective shame, this insti
tution would prosper.
As it stands right now, depart
ing athletic administrators Tom
Beckett (to Yale), Gene Washing
ton (to the NFL) and Keith Sparks
(to the corporate world) must be
smiling because they are leaving
this place and the ridiculousness of
many of its inhabitants.

It is time for Stanford students
to concentrate on beating Cal
rather than beating on each other.
Then maybe people won't scowl as
much each day when they pick up
The Daily to read.
Report the good once in a while.
That's all I ask.

David Schwartz got annoyed with
the coverage of the statue incident
by day two and decided to watch
the NBA playoffs instead.
Ever since Watergate, the
media have considered
scandal their meat and
potatoes. Sometimes there is
legitimate wrongdoing. Other
times minor events become
transformed into trials of epic
proportions, with the press serv
ing as witness, jury, judge and
executioner. Always, it seems,
the negative focus overshadows
the reporting of positive
achievements. Many accom
plishments go unnoticed alto
gether.
And so it was with last week's
events on this campus. Eight
varsity athletes, in the midst of
drunken revelry, allegedly ven
tured near the Quad and dam
aged a fixture.
On any other campus, this
would hardly be big news.
Maybe a paragraph, nothing
more. Even at Stanford, if the
intoxicated people had not been
athletes, there probably would
not be such a fuss. But since the
offenders were athletes, it was,
if I may say so, a whole different
ballgame. For this incident pro
vided a chance to complain
about one of this campus' last
bastions of veritable tradition
which had heretofore been rela
tively untainted by the vicissi
tudes of campus politics: the
Department of Athletics.
Journalists, especially at this
newspaper, foamed at the
mouth to peg the athletes with
banner headlines — on the front
page — in their self-anointed
role as crusaders for "justice."
For seven days now the story
has been hashed and rehashed
below the masthead.
So some athletes got carried
away celebrating the baseball
team's Six-Pac Championship.
Big deal. Perhaps, in their ine
briated state, the athletes mis
took the figures for Bill Walsh
and Mark Marquess and decided
to give them what they thought
was a Gatorade bath.
Now that the senseless act
has been committed, have some
one clean off the statue. Have
the individuals pay for the dam
ages. Maybe even have them
take an "Art Appreciation"
class.
Damaging property is wrong.
It was a sophomoric act commit
ted by some sophomores. Noth
ing more.
But press felony charges?
Please.
The fact is, had it been any
other fixture, this story would
not be a big deal. This past fall,
Cal students damaged other
campus fixtures and were not
charged. Where were the
reporters when athletic facilities
were vandalized this year? Ask

the artist who did the billboard
on El Camino how he felt when
his painting of Bill Walsh's head
was chopped off. And what about
the large red Stanford "S," the
veritable symbol of Stanford ath
letics, that was stolen from the
Sunken Diamond scoreboard
two months ago?
However, as the thinking
goes, because this fixture in par
ticular was involved, an uproar
was not only justified but
expected. It was another chance
for the tiring rhetoric of victim
ization to be invoked.
It is interesting that no one
bothered to report on the many
positive things Stanford ath
letes have done recently. Just
last week, several dozen athletes
participated in the "Youth
Olympics" for impoverished
children from East Palo Alto.
Obviously, that story was too
positive to be newsworthy.
Not surprisingly, the fact
that swimmer Jenny Thompson
was nominated for the Sullivan
Award, presented to the
nation's outstanding amateur
athlete, continues to escape the
front page. Likewise for the
news that Stanford again leads
the nation in NCAA team titles
(three so far in 1993-94). Or
how about a story revealing that
in the past 15 years, the Cardi
nal has racked up 39 NCAA
team titles, more than any other
school in the country?
Instead, the story that was
deemed worthy of coverage was
made out to be far worse than it
actually was. And it was this
sensationalism that catapulted
the story into USA Today, CNN,
ESPN's Sports Center, and the
Associated Press dispatch.
Reporters are hoping to
transfer outrage at these indi
viduals into outrage towards the
groups with which they are
associated. Some people are
using individual wrongs to blud
geon a group they dislike. Con
stantly, the fact that the individ
uals are athletes is mentioned.
Ask yourself: If the individuals
were members of the string sec
tion of the orchestra, would they
be receiving the same scrutiny?
Would their extracurricular
activity be relevant?
