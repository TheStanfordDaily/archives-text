Yesterday's article about the
Pacific 10 Conference Rowing
Championships neglected to
include the placement of the
novice women's boat.
Although the Cardinal
women failed to qualify for the

top final, the rowers improved
their time on Saturday to finish
with the second fastest clocking
overall. In addition, the novice
women were the only Stanford
rowers to beat California all
year.
