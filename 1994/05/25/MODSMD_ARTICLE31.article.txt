# Division between church and state debated
## 
### Frank Guinan Staff writer 
Prayer in public schools, original intent in
the Constitution and views about a "con
structionist" versus an "activist" Supreme
Court were among the topics discussed at a
debate last night on the relationship
between church and state in Kresge Audito
rium.
The debate — sponsored by the ASSU
Speakers Bureau — featured New York
University Law Prof. Nadine Strossen,
who is president of the American Civil
Liberties Union, and Bruce Herschen
sohn, a conservative Southern California
political commentator and 1992 Senate
candidate.
Although two broad questions were
originally posed, the two speakers concen
trated their remarks on a few specific top
ics.
Herschensohn began the debate by prais
ing the Constitution as "the greatest single
legislative document written since civiliza
tion began." He commended the original
intent of the founders, saying, "The premise
of the founders was based on a simple idea . .
. that the individual is responsible for him or
herself."
Strossen later argued that, although she
respects the original Constitution, she dis
agrees with parts of the founders' intent,
citing the fact that the Constitution permit
ted slavery and that slaves, women and
Native Americans could not vote. "Nobody
had equality of rights" under the original
Constitution, she said.

In attacking the original intent of the
founders, Strossen said that there was
"much to be praised, but also much to be
condemned."
On the topic of religion, Herschensohn
said that the First Amendment originally
intended that "official religion" was the
business of the state, not of the federal gov
ernment.
In the past three decades, however, he
said that the First Amendment had been
turned upside down by what he termed an
"activist court," citing the Supreme Court's
decisions outlawing prayer in public
schools.
"Anti-religion has become a religion of its
own," Herschensohn said. In a hypothetical
example, he said that if a building were to
publicly display a crucifix with its lights dur
ing Christmas time, then the ACLU would
take them to court. On the other hand, if the
lights were to display a swastika, then it
would go unchallenged by the ACLU and be
cited as an example of free speech.
But Strossen argued that "the appropri
ate role of government concerning religion is
one of neutrality. . . . Government can nei
ther favor nor disfavor religion," according
to the First Amendment.
Strossen also disagreed with Herschen
sohn's notion of the "anti-religion religion"
and stated that prohibiting school-spon
sored prayer is a form of holding neutrality.
She said that government interference in
religious matters could endanger the gov
ernment if division among religious lines
were to occur.
"When government gets involved, it

sends a message. It makes some people leel
like outsiders," Strossen added.
In addition, she stated that government
interference "dilutes religion" because, in
some cases, consenting justices are forced to
state that Christmas is not a religious holi
day, thereby insulting those who value their
religion deeply.
"All religions and non-religions should
stand equal to the government," she said.
An amendment that Herschensohn said
he would like to see is one which prohibits
either state or federal governments from
forbidding prayer in schools.
Herschensohn talked about his own
school experiences before the Supreme
Court outlawed prayer in public schools. He
said that he went to a public school which
allowed prayer and said that the school was
"absolutely superb."
He said that he was Jewish and did not
mind it when prayers included the name of
Jesus Christ. "The important thing was that
I received a good education," Herschensohn
said.
Strossen attacked Herschensohn's
premise, however, stating that he "cannot
trivialize the situation of people who are
excluded by religious prayers." She also
stated that government must protect
against "subtle" as well as "blatant" reli
gious coercion.
She said that students are still free to
pray in school as long as it is a private indi
vidual action rather than a school-led or
government sponsored action. She also
joked, "As long as there are final exams,
there will be prayer in schools."
