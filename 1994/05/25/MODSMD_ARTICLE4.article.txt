# All it takes is a little renovation
## Results of Draw in, Flo Mo skyrockets 
### Marc Lee Staff writer 
The Draw numbers are in, and
Florence Moore Hall hasn't looked
this good in years.
Flo Mo's surge in popularity con
tinues last year's trend of resi
dences scheduled for refurbish
ment faring well. In addition, co-op
eratives maintained their strong
appeal and the focus houses gener
ally declined again.
Chi Theta Chi was the top choice
among men, at 142, while Storey
was the most popular residence
among women, with a cutoff of 167.

Cardenal, Faisan, Loro and
Mirlo — the four-class houses in
Flo Mo — rocketed in popularity, as
all will be occupied by students
drawing with preferred status next
year. In past years, unguaranteed
students were able to draw into
many of these houses.
All four drew 2,524 or better,
while the lowest cutoff number to
get into Flo Mo in 1993's Draw was
2,925. Faisan, for example, vaulted
from 4,002 for men last year to
1,635, and from 2,701 for women
last year to 1,594.
Flo Mo will undergo massive
renovation this summer under the
capital improvement program
begun in 1993. The four Row hous
es scheduled for to benefit from the
program this summer — Phi Sig,
Hammarskjold, 553 Mayfield and
the Grove Houses — experienced a
tamer, though marked, increase in
popularity.
Last year, Wilbur Hall's populari
ty increased dramatically in the
Draw in anticipation of the renova
tions completed last summer.
Wilbur's five four-class houses main
tained their high appeal this year.

Other residences built on last
year's successes. "The co-ops were
really strong again this year," said
Bill Georges, the director of the
Housing Center.
Last year, the co-ops organized
an outreach campaign that suc
cessfully encouraged more stu
dents to seek to live in their hous
es, and they again organized an
informational faire in White Plaza
this year.
Indeed, Theta Chi is the top pick
for men at a slim 142 with Priority
1, compared to 1,567 last year. But,
according to resident assistant
David Fischer, this result may
reflect the fact that five of the six
staff members for next year will be

males, leaving few spaces available
for men trying to draw into the
house.
Ninety-five percent of the 3,910
undergraduates who entered the
Draw received a housing assign
ment, leaving 215 unassigned. "We
strongly encourage unassigned
undergraduates to join the waiting
list," said Georges, who explained
that they can expect an assignment
by the first week of classes next fall.
With the exception of Lantana
and Castano, the focus dormitories
saw a dip in demand. The cutoff
number for assignment to Adams,
for example, rose from 2,898 for
men and 2,462 for women to 4,672
and 3,000, respectively.

Roth — a single-sex house —
replaced Alpha Sig as the least pop
ular choice for women at 4,995,
while Robinson was the least popu
lar for men at 4,937. Last year,
Burbank garnered that dubious
honor for men.
In what Georges described as an
"unusual" occurrence, the six-per
son Suites were not filled with indi
viduals having priority.
The popularity of Muwekma
tah-ruk and La Casa Italiana
improved considerably among
women, while La Maison Francaise
dramatically improved for both
men and women. The cutoff there
for women was 1,827, down from
4,327, while the number for men

fell from 4,250 to 2,526.
For graduate students, "the
results were very positive,"
Georges said. All couples without
children and all students with chil
dren were assigned housing, as
were all single graduates willing to
live at any residence. He added that
a few vacancies among graduate
housing remain.
Only 285 graduate students
were unassigned because they limit
ed their choices to specific resi
dences. This is the lowest number of
unassigned students since the
Rains Houses opened, Georges said.
The best Draw number was
0006, while Lady Luck handed one
unfortunate group a hefty 4,996.
