Stanford baseball team member
Brian Dallimore has been connect
ed to the May 16 alleged vandalism
of the "Gay Liberation" statue,
bringing the total number of
named students allegedly involved
in the incident to eight.
Sources have confirmed that
Dallimore met with Judicial Affairs
Officer Sally Cole on Monday to dis
cuss the case.
Baseball players Dusty Allen,
Robert Gardner, Todd Laßocca
and Brendan Sullivan, football
team members Mark Butterfield
and Jason White and wrestler
Thomas Irwin were arrested last
week at the time of the incident for
allegedly vandalizing the four-fig
ured bronze sculpture.
Dallimore has not yet been
placed under arrest for his alleged
actions, Stanford Police Capt.
Raoul Niemeyer said yesterday.
But Niemeyer said that he has spo
ken with an additional student in
volved in the incident whose identi
ty he could not disclose.

"I don't know how he got away,"
Niemeyer said.
Dallimore — a sophomore who
is the starting third-baseman and a

member of Delta
Tau Delta frater
nity — was unable
to be reached and
did not respond to
£hone messages
yesterday.
The Santa Clara
County District
Attorney's Office
is still determin-

Lng what charges will be brought
against the athletes involved in the
incident, according to Niemeyer.
The University is also continu
ing its investigation and has not yet
filed charges against any of the stu
dents involved, Cole said.
The white sculpture was found
splattered with black paint by po
lice at 2 a.m. last Monday. An iron
bench that is part of the installa
tion was also wedged between the
two standing figures.
