Brian Dallimore has been connect
ed to the May 16 alleged vandalism
of the "Gay Liberation" statue,
bringing the total number of
named students allegedly involved
in the incident to eight.
Sources have confirmed that
Dallimore met with Judicial Affairs
Officer Sally Cole on Monday to dis
cuss the case.
Baseball players Dusty Allen,
Robert Gardner, Todd Laßocca
and Brendan Sullivan, football
team members Mark Butterfield
and Jason White and wrestler
Thomas Irwin were arrested last
week at the time of the incident for
allegedly vandalizing the four-fig
ured bronze sculpture.
Dallimore has not yet been
placed under arrest for his alleged
actions, Stanford Police Capt.
Raoul Niemeyer said yesterday.
But Niemeyer said that he has spo
ken with an additional student in
volved in the incident whose identi
ty he could not disclose.

"I don't know how he got away,"
Niemeyer said.
Dallimore — a sophomore who
is the starting third-baseman and a

member of Delta
Tau Delta frater
nity — was unable
to be reached and
did not respond to
£hone messages
yesterday.
The Santa Clara
County District
Attorney's Office
is still determin-

Lng what charges will be brought
against the athletes involved in the
incident, according to Niemeyer.
The University is also continu
ing its investigation and has not yet
filed charges against any of the stu
dents involved, Cole said.
The white sculpture was found
splattered with black paint by po
lice at 2 a.m. last Monday. An iron
bench that is part of the installa
tion was also wedged between the
two standing figures.
Assoc. Athletic Director Tom


Dallimore
Beckett said yesterday that he was
incorrect in an earlier statement
that the baseball players involved
in the incident would be suspended
from practice.
The players did not attend prac
tice on Monday due to a meeting

with Cole, Beckett said. But all four
of the team members implicated in
the incident attended regular prac
tice yesterday.
"There have been no sanctions
against their practice opportunity
at this point," Beckett said.
In a gesture of sympathy, Stan
ford football coach Bill Walsh visit
ed the Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual
Community Center yesterday and
penned a letter on the spot to mem
bers of the community.

Walsh wrote that he apologized
for not being able to meet with the
community sooner because of
Stanford-related travel.
"Some people have a very sick
intensive value structure," he
wrote. "Somehow we have to co
exist with them.
"Let's look at how we can effec
tively deal with the sinister act
that has hurt and damaged a lot of
very nice and sincere people. There
are three distinct issues — I'd like

to address them with you. The
sculptures — the act — and the
general lack of sensitivity," Walsh
wrote.
Adding that he wanted to "get
together very soon," Walsh
signed the letter "With sincere
disgust!"
The note was met with praise
and circulated in an electronic mail
transcription across campus. "I
can't tell you how pleased I am,"
graduate student Tracy Schmidt

said.
"[Walsh's] gesture was a mark
er of how serious the nature of this
crime is," senior Albert Liu said.
"His concern for the issue should
set an example for the Athletics
Department and the University
community."
The alleged vandals will be
meeting with Director of Athletics
Ted Leland today, according to
Beckett, who added that Leland
will also issue a public statement

regarding the incident.
The Cardinal baseball team —
for which both Allen and Dallimore
are starters — is leaving for the
NCAA regional championships in
Texas tonight.
Allen and Dallimore will
already be serving a one-game
suspension at the tournament
because of their participation in a
bench-clearing brawl which
occurred during a May 15 game at
Arizona State.
