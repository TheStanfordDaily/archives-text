# Food service prices draw fire from ASSU
## 
### Jim Luh Staff writer 
The ASSU Senate tied up some
loose ends and closed up shop last
night, approving ASSU budgets for
this quarter and next year and host
ing a visit from two Housing and
Dining Services administrators in
its final meeting of the year.
At the beginning of the question
and-answer session on housing,
food services and facilities, Housing
and Dining Services Director Keith
Guy announced that his depart
ment will propose two new con
struction projects at the Board of
Trustees meeting in June.
One proposal will be for a 226-
apartment complex for graduate
students to be constructed near
Governor's Corner, and the other
will be for housing at the site of the
Manzanita Park trailers for stu
dents in the summer executive edu
cation program of the Graduate
School of Business and other stu
dents during the academic year.
In other questions, graduate
senator Sanford Dickert — noting
the "fire sales" in which students

attempt to use up their remaining a
la carte points by purchasing bulk
foods at the end of every quarter —
asked why food service points are
non-refundable and can be bought
only in blocks.
"One of the things that happens
... is that we have to cost out our
program for the entire year" based
on estimates of student use, Guy
explained.
Guy said the situation with the a
la carte plan is similar to the situa
tion with the full board plan. Guy
said that food service sets board
plan prices based on an assumption
that students who purchase 19
meals a week do not actually eat all
19 meals every week.
"We factor that into the pricing,"
Guy said. If students did eat all the
meals they paid for, he added, Food
Service would have to raise board
plan prices. Likewise, Guy said, a la
carte prices are set on the assump
tion that not all students will even
tually use all their points.
"It's a problem we continue to
struggle with," Guy said. "I think if
someone could come to us with a
proposal to cover our costs" and
meet student needs at the same
time, "we would certainly consider
it."
"We can't get money back that's
enough to meet our expenses,"
Guy said. "That's the trick."
In a related question, graduate
senator Nawwar Kasrawi asked
why Snapple — which he said is
priced at $1.00 in Tresidder —
costs $1.60 in food service.
Guy said he was not familiar
with Kasrawi's specific example.
But Guy added that food service
attempts to set credible price lev
els, and that if Kasrawi's price
figures are accurate, "I don't
think that's right."
In other business, the senate
passed next year's operating bud
get and fee collection schedule,
after some fiddling with some of
the line items in the bill.
For the first time next year,
the ASSU operating budget

includes no financial contribution
from the University as the gradu
al process of eliminating Univer
sity funding of the ASSU con
cludes.
"Over four years, we've had a
$150,000 budget cut from the
University," said Kasrawi, who
will be chair of next year's senate.
But Dickert noted that despite
the lack of University funding,
the ASSU is still funding opera
tions that might be paid for by
the University, including the
Nominations Committee, which
appoints student representatives
to University committees.
"A lot of services provided by
the ASSU could be provided by
the University," said ASSU
Financial Manager Brian Hillger.
Hillger said he has raised ques
tions with administrators as to
who should pay for those ser
vices, but has received little
response.
The senate also considered a
resolution opposing the Faculty
Senate's Committee on Academic
Appraisal and Achievement's
grading policy proposal, which
would reinstate the failing grade

and toughen add/drop and retake
policies.
The resolution attempted to
refute several arguments made in
favor of the C-AAA proposal,
notably that the proposal would
decrease grade inflation and
increase the value of University
transcripts. The resolution also
claimed that the proposal would
introduce several problems.
But several senators objected
to the bill on the grounds that it
lent the endorsement of the
ASSU to what was a highly con
tentious position that may not
have been based in fact and may
not have represented the views of
the student body.
Undergraduate senator Eric
Chen — an author of the resolu
tion — argued that it was neces
sary for the ASSU to express its
opinion on the matter because it
is scheduled to come to a vote by
the Faculty Senate tomorrow.
"Something has to be done. I just
think that as a responsible senate
we have to act somehow," Chen
said.
After a lengthy debate, Kas
rawi introduced an amendment

that simply asked the Faculty
Senate to examine the arguments
made in the resolution — but
emphasized that the points made
in Chen's bill are the arguments
of concerned students and not
necessarily of the ASSU.
In other business, the senate:
• passed a bill authored by
Senate Chair Greg Waldorf that
will require Council of Presidents
slates to designate a slate chair
before the election. Previously,
COP slates did not have to choose
a chair until after the election;
• passed a resolution reinforc
ing a belief that the ASSU should
attempt to maintain a neutral
stance on matters that do not
affect Stanford students solely by
virtue of their status as Stanford
students; and
• approved spring quarter allo
cations, setting aside $11,285 for
the Community Service Board
and $11,981 for the Program
Board, and approved next year's
annual allocations, granting
$45,383 to the Community Ser
vice Board, $65,967 to the Pro
gram Board and $13,543 to the
Publications Board.

someone could come to us with a
proposal to cover our costs" and
meet student needs at the same
time, "we would certainly consider
it."
"We can't get money back that's
enough to meet our expenses,"
Guy said. "That's the trick."
In a related question, graduate
senator Nawwar Kasrawi asked
why Snapple — which he said is
priced at $1.00 in Tresidder —
costs $1.60 in food service.
Guy said he was not familiar
with Kasrawi's specific example.
But Guy added that food service
attempts to set credible price lev
els, and that if Kasrawi's price
figures are accurate, "I don't
think that's right."
In other business, the senate
passed next year's operating bud
get and fee collection schedule,
after some fiddling with some of
the line items in the bill.
For the first time next year,
the ASSU operating budget

includes no financial contribution
from the University as the gradu
al process of eliminating Univer
sity funding of the ASSU con
cludes.
"Over four years, we've had a
$150,000 budget cut from the
University," said Kasrawi, who
will be chair of next year's senate.
But Dickert noted that despite
the lack of University funding,
the ASSU is still funding opera
tions that might be paid for by
the University, including the
Nominations Committee, which
appoints student representatives
to University committees.
"A lot of services provided by
the ASSU could be provided by
the University," said ASSU
Financial Manager Brian Hillger.
Hillger said he has raised ques
tions with administrators as to
who should pay for those ser
vices, but has received little
response.
The senate also considered a
resolution opposing the Faculty
Senate's Committee on Academic
Appraisal and Achievement's
grading policy proposal, which
would reinstate the failing grade

and toughen add/drop and retake
policies.
The resolution attempted to
refute several arguments made in
favor of the C-AAA proposal,
notably that the proposal would
decrease grade inflation and
increase the value of University
transcripts. The resolution also
claimed that the proposal would
introduce several problems.
But several senators objected
to the bill on the grounds that it
lent the endorsement of the
ASSU to what was a highly con
tentious position that may not
have been based in fact and may
not have represented the views of
the student body.
Undergraduate senator Eric
Chen — an author of the resolu
tion — argued that it was neces
sary for the ASSU to express its
opinion on the matter because it
is scheduled to come to a vote by
the Faculty Senate tomorrow.
"Something has to be done. I just
think that as a responsible senate
we have to act somehow," Chen
said.
After a lengthy debate, Kas
rawi introduced an amendment

that simply asked the Faculty
Senate to examine the arguments
made in the resolution — but
emphasized that the points made
in Chen's bill are the arguments
of concerned students and not
necessarily of the ASSU.
In other business, the senate:
• passed a bill authored by
Senate Chair Greg Waldorf that
will require Council of Presidents
slates to designate a slate chair
before the election. Previously,
COP slates did not have to choose
a chair until after the election;
• passed a resolution reinforc
ing a belief that the ASSU should
attempt to maintain a neutral
stance on matters that do not
affect Stanford students solely by
virtue of their status as Stanford
students; and
• approved spring quarter allo
cations, setting aside $11,285 for
the Community Service Board
and $11,981 for the Program
Board, and approved next year's
annual allocations, granting
$45,383 to the Community Ser
vice Board, $65,967 to the Pro
gram Board and $13,543 to the
Publications Board.
The ASSU Senate tied up some
loose ends and closed up shop last
night, approving ASSU budgets for
this quarter and next year and host
ing a visit from two Housing and
Dining Services administrators in
its final meeting of the year.
At the beginning of the question
and-answer session on housing,
food services and facilities, Housing
and Dining Services Director Keith
Guy announced that his depart
ment will propose two new con
struction projects at the Board of
Trustees meeting in June.
One proposal will be for a 226-
apartment complex for graduate
students to be constructed near
Governor's Corner, and the other
will be for housing at the site of the
Manzanita Park trailers for stu
dents in the summer executive edu
cation program of the Graduate
School of Business and other stu
dents during the academic year.
In other questions, graduate
senator Sanford Dickert — noting
the "fire sales" in which students

attempt to use up their remaining a
la carte points by purchasing bulk
foods at the end of every quarter —
asked why food service points are
non-refundable and can be bought
only in blocks.
"One of the things that happens
... is that we have to cost out our
program for the entire year" based
on estimates of student use, Guy
explained.
Guy said the situation with the a
la carte plan is similar to the situa
tion with the full board plan. Guy
said that food service sets board
plan prices based on an assumption
that students who purchase 19
meals a week do not actually eat all
19 meals every week.
"We factor that into the pricing,"
Guy said. If students did eat all the
meals they paid for, he added, Food
Service would have to raise board
plan prices. Likewise, Guy said, a la
carte prices are set on the assump
tion that not all students will even
tually use all their points.
"It's a problem we continue to
struggle with," Guy said. "I think if
someone could come to us with a
proposal to cover our costs" and
meet student needs at the same
time, "we would certainly consider
it."
"We can't get money back that's
enough to meet our expenses,"
Guy said. "That's the trick."
