The ASSU Senate tied up some
loose ends and closed up shop last
night, approving ASSU budgets for
this quarter and next year and host

Dining Services administrators in
its final meeting of the year.

"We factor that into the pricing,"
Guy said. If students did eat all the
meals they paid for, he added, Food
Service would have to raise board
plan prices. Likewise, Guy said, a la

"It's a problem we continue to
struggle with," Guy said. "I think if
