# Med Center chaplain fosters climate of comfort and care
## 
### Ed Yoon Senior staff writer 
After spending seven years of silence in an
isolated Trappist monastery, Father John
Hester felt compelled to leave his life of con
templation and return to the hurly burly world
he had once rejected — as chaplain of the Stan
ford University Medical Center.
Hester became a man of the cloth in 1959,
initially "one of these pray, pay and obey kind
of people." As a young priest, he had been po
litically active, marching with Dr. Martin
Luther King, Jr. for 50 miles from Selma, Ala.
to Montgomery, Ala., and working with strik
ing field workers in California.
Throwing himself into the struggle for civil

rights, he witnessed "hatred, injustice and big
otry," and"the violence the human heart is ca
pable of." Twice he was held at gunpoint.
Overwhelmed by this experience, he en
tered the monastery, seeking to develop a
sense of peace and reflection. He recalls those
days fondly, and feels they instilled within him
the ability to find peace during the solitary mo
ments he spends walking the corridors of the
hospital.
But he realized his place was outside the
cloister. Now, after 20 years as chaplain, with
his trademark V-neck sweater and hair flecked
with white, he's become a familiar and com
forting presence to the hospital's doctors,
nurses and patients.
Drowned out by the beating roar
of the Life Flight helicopter while
speaking in his small office, the
softspoken chaplain now works
mainly on E2, intensive care,
though as a Roman Catholic priest
he remains available to patients
throughout the hospital.
Today he's spent most of the day
with family members who decided
to withdraw life support from their
elderly mother, visited a patient in
psychiatry, and tried to find an
interpreter to explain procedures to
a woman who speaks only Tagalog.
Constantly exposed to the arbi
trariness and violence of human
suffering — he has witnessed the
death of children, the sudden loss of
lives to violence and accidents —
Hester said his belief structure and
close friends sustain him during
difficult times.
"I think you really need to be
grounded in some kind of faith or
belief system," he said. "No ques
tion about it. You have to be very,
veiy strong and it has to be inter
nalized. It can't be something out of
a book or something that you've
read. You have to realize that
you're going to be exposed to the
absolute edge of human existence."
At the same time, he firmly
believes that chaplains have no
business trying to press their

beliefs on others, especially on
patients from different cultures.
"It's absolutely imperative that
someone who works in a setting
like this realize that our job is to be
with people where they are, and not
try to bring them to where we think
they should be," he said, "to make
it right for people to feel angry, or
isolated, or disappointed, or fright
ened; to allow people to babble, or
go into a rage, or cry."
Indeed, Hester feels that if there
are lessons learned, it is he, the
other chaplains and the volunteers
who learn them. "You find the
human spirit is absolutely incredi
ble," he said.
Patients are often uncomfort
able at the first encounter with the
him, he says."The first thing
they'll say is, 'Oh, I don't go to
church or I don't attend syna
gogue,'" he said with a grin and a
dismissive wave of the hand. "And I
say, 'Well, that's all right, we're just
here to be of support, in whatever
way.' Just to be there for someone
is itself a spiritual experience."
He recalled a quote from one
patient he met, who later said of
him, "The best thing about that
guy — he came by and visited me
and the whole time he was here —
there wasn't one bit of religion said
or spoken."
Hester's devotion to others can
be seen in his bedside manner.
Even with patients who might be
fazed by medication or seized with
anxiety about routine surgery, he
seems to possess an infinite

patience, always ready to hold a
hand, fetch a pillow, or talk about
anything.
Nevertheless, there are difficult
moments. Sometimes viewed by
patients or family members as an
adversaiy, in league with physi
cians seeking to limit care, he's
been threatened with lawsuits, and
at other times, he has called securi
ty to separate family members
divided over a loved one's course of
care.
"We can't work magic to make
that all go away," he said. Still, he
feels called to his work.
"Our job is to put the pebble in
the pond. I think we owe it to peo
ple to build a climate of compas
sionate care," he emphasized. "If
there's some way I can let people
know in a moment of trauma or
tragedy that we care about you, the
profound thing that you're not
alone, the profound thing that we
do understand what you might be
going through, in some ways — by
the fact we'll stay here with you, I
think that's a profound moment to
share."
Hester maintains, however, that
his stories are not always ones of
pain or sorrow. "I think we are real
ly blessed in what we see," he said.
"The power of the human spirit,
the language of the human heart —
you would be amazed the wisdom
people have pondered by looking at
the ceiling, with the little dots, of
hospital rooms — I wish more peo
ple could hear. In this ghetto you
will hear it."

dismissive wave of the hand. "And I
say, 'Well, that's all right, we're just
here to be of support, in whatever
way.' Just to be there for someone
is itself a spiritual experience."
He recalled a quote from one
patient he met, who later said of
him, "The best thing about that
guy — he came by and visited me
and the whole time he was here —
there wasn't one bit of religion said
or spoken."
Hester's devotion to others can
be seen in his bedside manner.
Even with patients who might be
fazed by medication or seized with
anxiety about routine surgery, he
seems to possess an infinite

patience, always ready to hold a
hand, fetch a pillow, or talk about
anything.
Nevertheless, there are difficult
moments. Sometimes viewed by
patients or family members as an
adversaiy, in league with physi
cians seeking to limit care, he's
been threatened with lawsuits, and
at other times, he has called securi
ty to separate family members
divided over a loved one's course of
care.
"We can't work magic to make
that all go away," he said. Still, he
feels called to his work.
"Our job is to put the pebble in
the pond. I think we owe it to peo
ple to build a climate of compas
sionate care," he emphasized. "If
there's some way I can let people
know in a moment of trauma or
tragedy that we care about you, the
profound thing that you're not
alone, the profound thing that we
do understand what you might be
going through, in some ways — by
the fact we'll stay here with you, I
think that's a profound moment to
share."
Hester maintains, however, that
his stories are not always ones of
pain or sorrow. "I think we are real
ly blessed in what we see," he said.
"The power of the human spirit,
the language of the human heart —
you would be amazed the wisdom
people have pondered by looking at
the ceiling, with the little dots, of
hospital rooms — I wish more peo
ple could hear. In this ghetto you
will hear it."
After spending seven years of silence in an
isolated Trappist monastery, Father John
Hester felt compelled to leave his life of con
templation and return to the hurly burly world
he had once rejected — as chaplain of the Stan
ford University Medical Center.
Hester became a man of the cloth in 1959,
initially "one of these pray, pay and obey kind
of people." As a young priest, he had been po
litically active, marching with Dr. Martin
Luther King, Jr. for 50 miles from Selma, Ala.
to Montgomery, Ala., and working with strik
ing field workers in California.
Throwing himself into the struggle for civil

rights, he witnessed "hatred, injustice and big
otry," and"the violence the human heart is ca
pable of." Twice he was held at gunpoint.
Overwhelmed by this experience, he en
tered the monastery, seeking to develop a
sense of peace and reflection. He recalls those
days fondly, and feels they instilled within him
the ability to find peace during the solitary mo
ments he spends walking the corridors of the
hospital.
But he realized his place was outside the
cloister. Now, after 20 years as chaplain, with
his trademark V-neck sweater and hair flecked
with white, he's become a familiar and com
forting presence to the hospital's doctors,
nurses and patients.
Drowned out by the beating roar
of the Life Flight helicopter while
speaking in his small office, the
softspoken chaplain now works
mainly on E2, intensive care,
though as a Roman Catholic priest
he remains available to patients
throughout the hospital.
Today he's spent most of the day
with family members who decided
to withdraw life support from their
elderly mother, visited a patient in
psychiatry, and tried to find an
interpreter to explain procedures to
a woman who speaks only Tagalog.
Constantly exposed to the arbi
trariness and violence of human
suffering — he has witnessed the
death of children, the sudden loss of
lives to violence and accidents —
Hester said his belief structure and
close friends sustain him during
difficult times.
"I think you really need to be
grounded in some kind of faith or
belief system," he said. "No ques
tion about it. You have to be very,
veiy strong and it has to be inter
nalized. It can't be something out of
a book or something that you've
read. You have to realize that
you're going to be exposed to the
absolute edge of human existence."
At the same time, he firmly
believes that chaplains have no
business trying to press their

beliefs on others, especially on
patients from different cultures.
"It's absolutely imperative that
someone who works in a setting
like this realize that our job is to be
with people where they are, and not
try to bring them to where we think
they should be," he said, "to make
it right for people to feel angry, or
isolated, or disappointed, or fright
ened; to allow people to babble, or
go into a rage, or cry."
Indeed, Hester feels that if there
are lessons learned, it is he, the
other chaplains and the volunteers
who learn them. "You find the
human spirit is absolutely incredi
ble," he said.
Patients are often uncomfort
able at the first encounter with the
him, he says."The first thing
they'll say is, 'Oh, I don't go to
church or I don't attend syna
gogue,'" he said with a grin and a
dismissive wave of the hand. "And I
say, 'Well, that's all right, we're just
here to be of support, in whatever
way.' Just to be there for someone
is itself a spiritual experience."
He recalled a quote from one
patient he met, who later said of
him, "The best thing about that

and the whole time he was here —

or spoken."
