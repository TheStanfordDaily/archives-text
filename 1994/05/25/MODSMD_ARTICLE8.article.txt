Despite heavy hearts, angry feelings
and a feeling of emptiness over the de
parture of Casa Zapata resident fellows
Tony and Cecilia Burciaga, a strong
spirit of inspiration and gratitude re
mains within the Chicano community.
A surprise farewell reception

arranged by students, faculty and com
munity members was held yesterday at
the Bechtel International Center to
thank the Burciagas for their contribu
tions to Stanford.
"It was a beautiful tribute from our
extended family throughout the Stan
ford community," said Tony Burciaga.
"It was a celebration of joy and heal

Cecilia Burciaga, who as the associ
ate vice provost for Student Affairs had
been the highest-ranking Chicana at
the University, had her position elimi
nated due to budget cuts at the end of
last quarter, and both Burciagas will be
leaving Stanford in August.
Their forced departure from the
University and as RFs at Casa Zapata
has provoked widespread criticism of

the administration from the Chicano
community and others.
Various groups — including staff
members at El Centro Chicano, Casa
Zapata residents and MEChA, a Chi
cano/Latino student group — present

ship the Burciagas have provided
to the community.
El Centro will be arranging a
new library dedicated to the Bur
ciagas that will be filled with
papers, dissertations and books
from students and faculty mem
bers. The Casa Zapata lounge
will also be named after the Bur
ciagas and a plaque will be hung
in recognition of their contribu
tions.
In addition to the gifts and
dedications left behind, almost
everyone who attended the
reception said they will try to
continue the energy, friendship
and strength that the Burciagas
have given the Stanford commu
nity.
"This is the most hostile envi
ronment in 20 years and we need

to call on the moral vision and
strength they've given us," said
Anthropology Prof. Renato Ros
aldo. "We need to find ways to
honor what they've given us. We
will always cherish their endur
ing love and friendship."
The hostility and anger over
the firing of Cecilia Burciaga was
apparent in many of the farewell
speeches yesterday.
"We're very angry and that
anger hasn't gone away," said
senior Veronica de La Cruz, a
chair member of El Centro. "It's
a big loss to us and the Universi
ty doesn't understand our com
munity. They are the heart of
our community."
"It was wrong what [the Uni
versity] did. A lot of people in the
long run will regret the deci
sion," said junior Luz Herrera,
resident assistant in Casa Zapa
ta. "Tony and Cecilia will be wel
come everywhere and it will be a
big loss to Stanford. They're tak

ing a special part of our commu
nity."
However, many said yester
day's reception helped to ease the
sense of anger and enabled the
community to unite and cele
brate the important contribu
tions of the Burciagas.
"I am eternally grateful and
overwhelmed," Cecilia Burciaga
said. "I was very enriched and it
eases the sense of pain. The com
munity is so strong and loving."
Several students and faculty
said that wherever the Burciagas
decide to reside, they will always
be remembered and cherished by
the Stanford community.
"I don't know enough people
like Cecilia. She told me I mat
tered and made me feel like I
belonged," first-year graduate
student Susana Galiardo said. "I
know she's going to kick ass
wherever she goes, and we're
going to continue her vision and
the goals she instilled in us."
