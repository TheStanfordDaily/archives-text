Last year's disasters were the most
devastating in the history of Red Cross
disaster relief. Our disaster relief funds
are gone. And we still haven't faced the
spring floods or tornadoes we know are
coming. We must raise millions
immediately. To make sure we're able
to provide the relief victims count on.
To expect less of the Ked Cross is
unthinkable. Please help.
