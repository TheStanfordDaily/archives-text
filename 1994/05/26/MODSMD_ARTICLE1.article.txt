# Stanford's transcripts well-respected by peers

While restoring the legitimacy of Stan
ford transcripts in the "outside" world has
been cited by many as a compelling reason
for tightening the grading policy, graduate
schools across the country generally regard
University academic records quite highly.
Admissions officers from several presti
gious law, business and medical schools na
tionwide said that issues like grade infla
tion and the elimination of failing grades

from official Stanford academic records
have little or no negative bearing on their
decisions.
In fact, some graduate schools even give
a small numerical boost to Stanford letter
grade indicators to account for what they
consider the University's challenging acad
emic atmosphere.
"Stanford students are very highly re
garded here, and we take their undergradu
ate academic performance very seriously,"
said Jean Webb, director of admis
sions at Yale Law School. "We take
the Stanford transcript as a very
accurate indicator of academic per
formance. Period."
"It's not as if we take them with
a grain of salt at all," she added.
In addition to transcript evalua
tion, Yale — like most law schools
— has a system of ranking appli
cants in relation to all students
from the applicants' undergradu
ate school who applied to law school
over the last three years. Some
medical schools also use a similar
system.
Thus the applicants' transcript is
compared to those of students with
in the same undergraduate con
text. The issue of inflation becomes
moot, Webb said, as index results
are relative, and adjusted to each
applicant's particular institution.
The same faith that academic
transcripts accurately reflect the
performance of a Stanford students
was echoed by Patricia Faro, an
admissions officer at the University
of Washington's Medical School.
"Stanford's grades are not seen
as inflated," Faro said. "A high
GPA from Stanford is, in fact, seen
as an even stronger indication of
undergraduate academic perfor
mance. Historically, the feeling has
been that a strong academic record
at Stanford is very meaningful."
The same feeling was reflected

among many business schools.
"Stanford transcripts are both
highly attractive and very competi
tive," said Ilene Haniotis, director
of admissions at the John E. Ander
son Graduate School of Manage
ment at UCLA. "We put a great
deal of weight in them, and see
them more as a positive."
While Haniotis conceded that
"making the grading system more
rigorous might make undergradu
ates work a little harder," she said
other factors, like faculty and
course reputation, support that
Stanford is a fine academic envi
ronment.
"Obviously if a student has done
well at Stanford he or she is a
strong and academically competent
student," she added.
At UC-Berkeley's Boalt Law
School, transcripts of Stanford
applicants are even given a small
advantage.
"There is a very slight boost
given to Stanford transcripts — for
example a student who has earned
a 3.7 might be boosted to a 3.76,"
said Edward Pom, director of
admissions and financial aid at
Boalt.
"It's a slight advantage, but we
try to take into account the caliber
of the course of study a Stanford
student has had," he said. "It's a
very respected education in the
admissions process."
In addition to reviewing individ
ual transcripts, Boalt also uses an
indexing system.
While this system ensures that
admissions officers have a com

pletely relative, "deflated" method
of assessing grades, it could hurt
students from schools with "tradi
tionally higher" grade distribution
under certain circumstances, said
Richard Badger, dean of students
at the University of Chicago's Law
School.
Badger said applicants from
such institutions with high grades
but low standardized test scores
may have a harder time convinc
ing admissions officers of their
ability, because "we may have very
little to differentiate their perfor
mance from that of many other
strong students."
However, Badger — who was
quoted in a Chicago Tribune story
as supporting tougher grading at
Stanford — said his opinions could
easily have been misinterpreted
from the comments in the article.
"I didn't mean to say that we are
biased against Stanford in admis
sions," Badger said, "just that the
system (of indexing) may not
always help those students."
Even at Stanford, where appli
cants sometimes feel the odds are
stacked against them, the tran
script is regarded as complete and
accurate.
"I'd say if anything there's a
positive bias, in that we're very
familiar with both the caliber of
student accepted to Stanford and
the rigor of courses taught here,"
said Marie Mookini, director of
admissions at the Graduate School
of Business. "There certainly aren't
any negatives attached to coming
from Stanford."
