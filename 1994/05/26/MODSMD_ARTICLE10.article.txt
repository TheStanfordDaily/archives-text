FBI to move into Moscow
WASHINGTON (AP) - The growth of
Russian organized crime and its interest in
stealing and selling nuclear weapons and
materials from the former Soviet Union
present "the greatest long-term threat to
the security of the United States," FBI
Director Louis J. Freeh said yesterday.
To establish "a police bridge and cop-to
cop contact" to deal with the problem,
Freeh announced that he would visit East
ern Europe and Russia next month and
open the FBl's first permanent office in
Moscow. The bureau now has 22 foreign
offices.
Discussions have begun to devise a U.S.-
Russian treaty that would ease extradition
and the exchange of evidence and witness
es, Freeh said.
Russian organized crime is spreading
in the United States and Europe and

"may have already attained or will attain
the capability to steal nuclear weapons,"
Freeh told a Senate subcommittee.
TB cases decrease
BOSTON (AP) — The number of new
tuberculosis cases dropped significantly
last year for the first time since 1985,
perhaps signaling control of the resurg
ing infection, officials reported yesterday.
The 1993 total was down by 1,360 cases,
a 5 percent reduction from 1992 when the
number of cases went up 2 percent.
Experts from the U.S. Centers for Dis
ease Control and Prevention, which com
piled the statistics, said the decline may be
a payoff of the nationwide effort to track
down people infected with TB and get
them treated. However, they cautioned
that a one-year reduction doesn't mean the
problem is licked.
