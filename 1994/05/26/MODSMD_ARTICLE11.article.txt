# Clinton to renew trade with China
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Clinton has decided to renew trade privi
leges for China and is considering
whether to end their linkage to Beijing's
human rights practices, an administra
tion official said yesterday.
"The question is to what degree do you
continue to apply sanctions in pursuit of
human rights goals," said the official,
speaking only on condition he not be iden
tified.
Secretary of State Warren Christopher
was preparing a recommendation for
Clinton that would couple renewal of
Most Favored Nation trade status with a
ban on U.S. imports of Chinese weapons
and ammunition.
Not linking trade privileges to human
rights would represent a clear retreat
from Clinton's position of a year ago
when he issued an executive order milk
ing progress on human rights the sole
condition for renewal of MFN, under

which Chinese products enter the United
States at the most favorable tariff rates.
Clinton discussed the China issue with
Christopher and national security adviser
Anthony Lake earlier in the day and
asked for more information on the ques
tion of using sanctions.
Alternative proposals discussed were
creation of a presidential commission to
monitor human rights progress in China,
pressing the issue in international
forums, and asking U.S. companies doing
business in China to come up with volun
tary standards of conduct.
Clinton was expected to announce his
decision today, but that timing was no
longer certain.
"The president has been shaping a
decision to his satisfaction and he's given
some very clear instruction to people and
they need to come up with more informa
tion," said the senior official.
Christopher had planned to discuss

China policy in a speech Friday to the
Asia Society but if Clinton's announce
ment goes beyond today, that speech
would be put off.
Administration and congressional offi
cials said Christopher would recommend
establishment of a commission to study
Chinese progress toward improving
human rights practices.
"There will be some human rights fac
tors" attached to the extension, said
White House press secretary Dee Dee
Myers. "We're not giving up on human
rights in China by any stretch."
Even a decision to renew MFN with
only a ban on imports of Chinese guns
and ammunition would face a challenge
from human rights activists in Congress
as inadequate.
At stake is billions of dollars in trade
between the two countries as well as
access for U.S. firms to the rapidly
expanding Chinese market.
