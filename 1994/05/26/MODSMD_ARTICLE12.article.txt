### 
Self-defense course only
for women should not be
made available for credit

Last Friday's rally to bring
back a women's self-defense
course as a for-credit Stan
ford class had everything necessary
to grab front-page news coverage:
100 people in White Plaza, a vocal
group sponsoring the event
(Women Defending Ourselves Col
lective) and faculty members who
support the idea.
It's unfortunate, then, that the
cause lacks constitutional legitima
cy, offers no compelling reasons for
why the class should be taken for
credit and is completely inconsis
tent with the University's commit
ment to a policy of open classes.
The class was canceled fall quar
ter after an anonymous complaint
was filed with the U.S. Department
of Education's Office of Civil Rights.
The University, always eager to
shrink from a fight, called for the
course to change its format to coed
or a single-sex physical education
class rather than deal with a govern
ment investigation into the charges.
Very little about the case has
changed except that time has
passed. Perhaps the class' support
ers believe that the lull after the ini
tial canceling of the class and an
aggressive campaign for reinstate
ment will force the University to
open itself to a possible lawsuit. But
it will take more than forgetfulness
to get the class back on campus.
One new development is the
legal brief submitted by the collec
tive last week to University offi
cials. Provost Condoleezza Rice has
promised to respond to the brief by
the end of the month.
The briefs arguments hinge on
the class' legitimacy based on affir
mative action as a compensation for
past and existing discrimination.
What the brief ignores is that
affirmative action is inherently an
inclusive policy calling for a certain

number of one disadvantaged
group to be included in something
it has traditionally not been a part
of. In no way is affirmative action
an exclusionary policy, which calls
for the barring of one gender or
other group from an activity as a
compensation for past wrongs.
Keeping men out of a self
defense class on these grounds is as
ridiculous as excluding all non
blacks from an Afro-American
Studies course.
There is no question that the
aims of the course — to empower
women physically and emotionally
— are valid and should be a part of
campus life. But there is no reason
why the class cannot be given as an
extracurricular activity supported
by a student group. Since the can
cellation, the class has been held
off-campus at the University
Lutheran Church on the corner of
Bowdoin and Stanford Avenues.
Assigning credit for the class
would be one way for the Universi
ty to show it cares about women's
issues such as rape on campus. But
it would do so at the risk of seri
ously compromising the Universi
ty's policy that all classes be open
to all people qualified to take the
course. For a self-defense class,
anyone wishing to learn more
about self-defense is qualified, not
just women.
There is no way the University
can let the class back on campus
without suspending a long-stand
ing tradition of open classes. It
would also set a very dangerous
precedent. Should certain ethnic
studies classes be open only to cer
tain ethnicities because those peo
ple feel more comfortable talking
with people within their group
about group-specific problems?
Stanford admits people to its
freshman class who vary widely in
background. They come to Stan
ford with the understanding that
they can take any class sponsored
by the University, no matter who
they are.
The self-defense class may seem
like a small exception to such a
rule. But it's an exception the Uni
versity can't afford to let slip by.
