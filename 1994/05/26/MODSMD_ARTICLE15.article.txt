## Generation schmeneration 
### 
I THINK I know where our generation
gap rests. It lies somewhere between
our expectations and our questions.
It's been said that we are part of an
unsatisfied generation, an age of discon
tent and angst. The '60s were the era of
change, the '70s of self-absorption and
the '80s of greed and "just saying no."
Which leaves us at the '90s â€” the age of
recession.
We can all pretty much relate to the
themes of all these decades, with the
exception of our own. The '60s were
great, they must have been, any libera
tion from the stale homogeneity of the
'50s had to be good.
During the '70s we all felt a little self
indulgent. Hell, we were kids, and who
doesn't want their own way before the age
of 10? In the '80s the media filled our
heads with the idea that there were quick
roads to riches (like a Stanford degree),
and we could probably get there as long as
we just said "no."
But the '90s are hard to dig. I mean,
who wants to accept the fact that four
years of hard labor (like a Stanford
degree) no equals a lifetime of job
security?
No one. So what do we do? We ques
tion. We are coming of age in a decade
that doesn't make any sense to us. Our
grandparents promised their children
that their lives would be better when they
grew up. Since our grandparents lived
through the Depression, promising the

kids a better life wasn't too hard. But
while we were milk-fed on the same
promise and told of great things to look
forward to, while great expectations were
growing in our minds, the world around
us was doing an about-face, both econom
ically and culturally.
We were brought up with great antici
pation and let down hard.
So where do we go from here? We start
to realize that the gap between hope and
reality causes doubt, and doubt causes
more questioning. Sure, our parents, like
every generation, went through the same
thing, but they went through it differently.
Mom and Dad had the luxury of
answering all the easy questions. How
hard can it be to decide whether or not a
class of people should be oppressed? How
difficult can it be to protest an unjustified
war? How could you not be inspired by
the lyrics to "Turn! Turn! Turn!"?
But when it came to us, the mental
exams were no longer multiple choice.
Today it is not a question of yes-and-no
ethics, it is a question of answerable or
unanswerable dilemmas.
Our parents were told that having a
job that put food on the table for the fam
ily was good enough. But I can never feel
that way. If I end up in a self-referential
life of production, I'll hit a mid-life crisis
by age 30. We can't just be satisfied any
more. The world has been made too big,
too real for us, and we've taken on
responsibility for the state of things

because what we were told to expect isn't
out there.
This is not some story of a self-pitying,
teenage angst-inflicted Generation X-er,
it is the tale of why we aren't satisfied.
Why is it that what used to be considered
"good" or at least "good enough" no
longer suffices?
What we desire is a world with well
defined roles, with places to land when we
accomplish, and not just empty space to
float around in. We want to be told it's
OK to indulge ourselves. That having sex
won't kill you, that eating creme brul6
isn't bad for your health, that 50 percent
of our marriages won't end in divorce,
that having kids isn't going to over-popu
late the world, that there really is some
higher power to latch on to.
We want to step back in time, into the
world of Cary Grant where we can drink
whisky sours and smoke unfiltereds all
day without thinking twice. We want to
live in a world one step closer to ignorance
and one leap further from all the prob
lems we are force-fed every day.
Too bad that in order to get all that we
have to go to the movies.

For all those people who I promised I would
mention in my column, place your name
here: . Thanks for reading.
