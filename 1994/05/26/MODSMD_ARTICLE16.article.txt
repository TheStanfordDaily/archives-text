## Schwartz misses the point on student-athlete coverage 
### 
IN YESTERDAY'S Daily, David
Schwartz attempts to minimize
the actions of the Stanford stu
dents involved in the assault on the
George Segal statue "Gay Libera
tion," and to vilify the media and the
community hurt by the assault for
sensationalizing the event way out of
proportion.
He writes that the media have
become lost in the fact that these were
athletes and the "story" has blinded
the media (and again the community)
to the many wonderful things that the
student-athletes have achieved.
To say Stanford does not support
its student-athletes, and that we do
not recognize their positive achieve
ments is ridiculous. In the most obvi
ous example, The Daily devotes sever
al pages of each issue to the accom
plishments of the Department of Ath-

letics. The Daily picks a male and
female "Athlete of the Week" while I
have yet to see them pick a "Student
of the Week" or "Community Member
of the Week."
National championships, as well as
national issues surrounding our ath
letes (such as the drug testing law
suit) typically garner front-page head
lines not only in The Daily, but also in
the Campus Report, Stanford Observ
er and Stanford Magazine.
It strikes me as ironic that the only
time Schwartz complains of the
amount of press is now that it is bad
press. Why should we recognize our
athletes only when they have done
good, but suddenly disassociate them
from their environments when they
have done bad?
I will say that neither the media
nor the community should take recent

events to understand that everything
about the athletic
community, or the Greek community,
is negative. I was the manager
for the women's tennis team for two
years. I know countless athletes and
Greek members, and have been
involved in athletics as a participant
and a fan since I was a child.
I know from experience that there
are many positive qualities fostered in
these community environments,
including camaraderie and teamwork,
the value of community service and
the motivation to succeed.
But to judge them fairly, we must
also look closely at the problems that
these communities can present. These
include the suppression of individual
ism and difference, idolization (by
themselves and the community) and
extreme peer pressure. Many of these

things can lead members to view indi
viduals different from themselves as
"others" and not as people, to act on
whims while drunk and to think they
are above reproach. But by the time
you go to college, you are no longer a
child, and sophomoric behavior of the
sort which destroys University proper
ty and which alienates and threatens
an entire community cannot simply be
attributed to youth.
We need to be as vigilant in our
criticism as in our praise if we
hope to make Stanford, the Greek sys
tem and the Athletics Department
(which mind you should be for all stu
dents and not just varsity athletes) a
better place for the entire Stanford
community.
