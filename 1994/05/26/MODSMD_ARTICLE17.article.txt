# Disruption of Fac Sen should be condemned like statue vandalism
## 
### 
It is good to know that many voic
es, including the Daily's, are being
raised against tolerating the recent
vandalism against public statuary on
campus. Once upon a time, acts of
boorish malevolence, cruelty and
destructiveness were too often
excused on the specious argument
from immaturity: "Boys will be boys,"
especially when drunk. That time has
clearly passed, and we can only say
good riddance.
But where are the voices of con
demnation and demands for effective
action when the offense is violence of
a less immediately tangible but never
theless menacing kind, violence
against the deliberative and decision

making processes of the Stanford fac
ulty? Are we about to see the clearest
breach of the policy on campus dis
ruption for some years, the shouting
down of the Faculty Senate on May
12, go unprosecuted, much less pun
ished? If so, a precedent will be set
that will surely return to haunt us.
There are clearly established chan
nels for getting an item on the sen
ate's agenda â€” so clear and so well
established that they were used by
these same demonstrators and their
supporters one week later. On May
12, however, such a tame approach
was scorned in favor of a remarkable
display of sheer contempt for the fac
ulty and its workings.
If faculty members do not rise to
their own defense in these circum
stances, they will be entitled to feel
neither surprised nor aggrieved the
next time a zealous group decides to
break up a senate meeting as a way of
making its presence felt in a hurry.
