# Horpel's critics do not know that he is honest, loyal, not homophobic
## 
### 
Just a thought: those who condemn
Chris Horpel do not know the man.
His character is unassailable. Unlike
other Stanford coaches who will give
the wink and nod of their disapproval
of alcohol use by athletes and then
retire to the bar for a gin and tonic,
Horpel practices what he preaches.
I attended the season-ending
wrestling party in Santa Cruz the
first weekend in May and much to my
surprise (OK, frustration) there was
not an alcoholic drink to be had.
On another occasion several years
ago, Horpel admonished his athletes

to ignore, not challenge the man who
made it his practice to always shower
at the same time as the wrestling
team.
I have known Horpel for nearly 20
years, and his outspokenness is not a
flaw, but a refreshing change from
the blah-blah party line. He is most
certainly not homophobic, for he
fears no man, beast or reporter.
Obviously he is under a gag order
from University administrators, or
he would meet his accusers head-on.
Horpel is not one to back down from
a confrontation. He is intolerant only
of physical or intellectual laziness.
In showing loyalty to his athlete by
condemning the act and not the man,
Horpel has shown his true character
to be a shining example for the weak
kneed conformists who now populate
this once-great campus.
He should be praised, not buried.
