# 7 athletes suspended from teams
## Allen avoids sanctions in vandalism case 
### Burt Herman Editorial staff 
Seven varsity athletes have had their
"privileges to participate in intercollegiate
sports at Stanford revoked" for varying
lengths of time as a penalty for allegedly
vandalizing the "Gay Liberation" sculp
ture last week, Athletic Director Ted Le
land said in a statement yesterday.
First baseman Dusty Allen said he will
not be facing Department of Athletics
sanctions at this time. Allen left early yes
terday morning with the rest of the base
ball team for Texas, where they are com
peting in the NCAA regional tournament.

But baseball players Brian Dallimore,
Robert Gardner, Todd Laßocca and Bren
dan Sullivan, football team members
Mark Butterfield and Jason White and
wrestler Thomas Irwin attended a morn
ing meeting with Leland yesterday where
the sanctions were discussed, Irwin said.
Allen, Butterfield, Gardner, Irwin,
Laßocca, Sullivan and White were arrest
ed last week at the time of the incident for
allegedly vandalizing the four-figured
bronze sculpture.
Dallimore, a sophomore, has also been
questioned by Judicial Affairs Officer
Sally Cole in connection with the incident
but has not been placed under arrest.

Each of the students' cases will be
looked at separately in order to determine
disciplinary actions related to the alleged
crime, according to Leland. "Pending fur
ther investigation through normal Uni
versity process, additional restrictions
may result," Leland said in his statement.


'We've taken the
steps we think
are reasonable
and fair in this
situation
— Ted Leland
Last week, Allen said that he
had driven the students to the
Quad at the time of the alleged van
dalism "not knowing what they
were going to do."
"I'm happy about what has hap
pened," Allen said yesterday from
his Austin, Texas, hotel room. "I'm
trying to put [the incident] behind
me.
Allen will be serving a one-game
suspension from the tournament
as required by NCAA rules because
of his involvement in a May 15
fight at Arizona State.
Right-handed pitcher Sullivan
also traveled to Texas yesterday.
But he will be sitting out for one
game due to sanctions from the
Athletics Department related to
the alleged vandalism incident, a
source within the department
said.
Third baseman Dallimore,

pitcher Gardner and reserve
infielder Laßocca did not travel
with the team and are not expected
to make the trip to Texas, accord
ing to Gary Migdol, director of
media relations for the Athletics
Department.
Gardner would not normally
have been scheduled to travel to the
tournament, Migdol said.
"We've taken the steps that we
think are reasonable and fair in
this situation," Leland said.
Irwin said he is unsure of the
length of his suspension. "The sus
pension is indefinite," he said, but
added that he hopes to compete
next year. The wrestling team prac
tices throughout the year, and the
season starts at the end of fall quar
ter.
"I would hope we could get it all
cleared up as soon as possible,"
Irwin said.
The measures against the ath
letes were the result of their confes
sions, a source said, and Gardner
and Sullivan are expected to be sub
jected to lesser penalties.

Charges should be filed by the
Santa Clara County District Attor
ney's Office tomorrow, Deputy Dis
trict Attorney Karyn Sinunu said.
The many complexities in the
case have delayed the process,
according to Sinunu. "I'm being
cautious about my charging," she
said.
A continuing flood of phone calls
has also distracted Sinunu from
her work. "It's kind of like the pub
lic has a lynch-mob mentality about
this case," she said.
And wrestling coach Chris Hor
pel's comments last week only
increased the public's outrage.
Much criticism has been leveled at
Horpel for his comments about
Stanford students being "force-fed
political correctness" and the inci
dent being "blown out of propor
tion."
Asked yesterday about the
recent actions by the Athletics
Department, Horpel said, "I'm not
allowed to talk on the record. It's
not that I don't want to give you my
opinion — I can't by policy now."
