# 7 athletes suspended from teams
## Allen avoids sanctions in vandalism case 
### Burt Herman Editorial staff 
Seven varsity athletes have had their
"privileges to participate in intercollegiate
sports at Stanford revoked" for varying
lengths of time as a penalty for allegedly
vandalizing the "Gay Liberation" sculp
ture last week, Athletic Director Ted Le
land said in a statement yesterday.
First baseman Dusty Allen said he will
not be facing Department of Athletics
sanctions at this time. Allen left early yes
terday morning with the rest of the base
ball team for Texas, where they are com
peting in the NCAA regional tournament.

But baseball players Brian Dallimore,
Robert Gardner, Todd Laßocca and Bren
dan Sullivan, football team members
Mark Butterfield and Jason White and
wrestler Thomas Irwin attended a morn
ing meeting with Leland yesterday where
the sanctions were discussed, Irwin said.
Allen, Butterfield, Gardner, Irwin,
Laßocca, Sullivan and White were arrest
ed last week at the time of the incident for
allegedly vandalizing the four-figured
bronze sculpture.
Dallimore, a sophomore, has also been
questioned by Judicial Affairs Officer
Sally Cole in connection with the incident
but has not been placed under arrest.

Each of the students' cases will be
looked at separately in order to determine
disciplinary actions related to the alleged
crime, according to Leland. "Pending fur
ther investigation through normal Uni
versity process, additional restrictions
may result," Leland said in his statement.


'We've taken the
steps we think
are reasonable
and fair in this
situation
