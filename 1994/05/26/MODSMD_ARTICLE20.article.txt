## Josh Green The 						forgotten graduates: master's students still hiding 
### 
LOOK AROUND at graduation.
You may see some curious-look
ing graduates, shifty-eyed as
they march, nervously picking at their
hoods, wondering if someone's going to
catch them for some heinous crime.
Their crime is stealing a degree in
one year — they are the thousands of
one-year master's students who go in
and out of the Farm every year, barely
stopping to look at the palm trees. And
I'll be the first to admit that I'm one
of them.
We are a different breed from the
rest of you. We are the fish outside of
the fishbowl, the people who feel
sheepish buying a cap and gown. We
are the ugly sister of Stanford.
So ugly that we get left out of fami
ly affairs. When campus issues are dis
cussed, campus activists often talk
about the sentiment "on campus" or
refer to a generic "student." Most of
them probably have their friends from
Stern, Roble, or Flo Mo in mind, not
graduate students. Only when we can
speak of Stanford students as encom
passing the entire student body will
there be a true discussion on impor
tant issues that affect everyone.
Fortunately for me, I decided to try

to get a taste for Stanford even if I had
only one year to do it. I juggled work
ing at The Daily with being a grad stu
dent, and it worked. Forced to read the
Opinions page every day, I couldn't
help but feel Stanfordish. Hut I know
from experience that Stanford is really
only half of a community — a collec
tion of undergrads who are scared to
traverse the haunted grounds of Rains
or Escondido Village, where the wild
things are.
The fear goes both ways. Master's
students, bewildered about how they
managed to get in here and equally
confused by silly undergrad abbrevia
tions (hey, I can eat Fro Yo at the Co
Ho before going to Mem Chu with the
best of them), never get involved in
campus activities, and never really feel
like they were a part of the Stanford
community.
It's just a lack of time many might
say. You can't expect people to bond
with Stanford in one year when every
one else has four or more.
Wrong. The amount of time spent in
a place has very little to do with how
much you like it. It all has to do with
bikes — stay with me on this one.
Riding a bike at Stanford is one of

the great and unique parts of the expe
rience here. Everyone's amazed (and
usually pretty annoyed) at the army of
bikes that can be found near any cam
pus building at any time of the day.
At no other place in the world can
you whip around a corner on your
bike, speed down Escondido Road, and
look up at an early rising moon to see
the mountains on the other side of the
Bay. Thank God for the clear skies of
California. You feel part of something
when you pass the other Stanfordites
riding their bikes, feel the breeze in
your hair, then notice that a stranger
of the opposite sex is smiling warmly
at you {no one at my frigid East Coast
undergraduate school smiles — the
spit on your teeth might freeze).
But most of the 2,772 master's stu
dents are here for only one year, and
have a car to got them to class and
back. That's all they need. No big
errands to run on campus (unless they
need to get to the library), no meetings
to attend, no rallies to protest at. The
Daily is supplanted by The New York
Times. What gay sculpture vandalism?
What do you mean, hunger strike?
Their social life is almost equally as
in-touch with Stanford tradition. They're

hanging out at the Blue Chalk with all
the other Paly yuppies when undergrads
are dancing in their underwear on the
Stanfords' tombs during the Halloween
bash. They think Exotic Erotic has some
thing to do with Adam & Eve catalogs.
They would rather sit in their condo-fied
apartments and watch CNN with the
fifth bowl of pasta they've eaten that
week than check out the Spring Faire or
the Powwow.
These people are not total duds
(well, perhaps some of them are — and
we won't mention the 4,657 doctoral
students). They have been shut out,
unwittingly or not, by the Stanford
undergrads. This artificial dividing line
between the master's students, the
often-milked cash cows of the Universi
ty, and the undergrads leave the grads
in the dark politically and socially.
Maybe it's a bit like the snobs at
Oxford University who look down on
anyone studying overseas for only a
few months. Apparently many Ameri
can students not attending for a full
year aren't invited to the much-vaunt
ed faculty teas and other erudite wine
affairs, and lack certain library privi
leges.
Well, master's students haven't yet

been invited to tea. Stanford has had
to face the possibility of internal
disharmony this year. The protests
and backlashes after the "No Grapes"
and "Gay Liberation" sculpture van
dalism incidents have shown that
Stanford may be more splintered than
we would like to think.
But everyone's inclusion to the
Stanford community is essential before
talking about coming to an agreement
on campus issues. You can't agree on
something when half of the people
involved go back to the grad ghetto
(Escondido) every day at five and for
get that they're Stanford students,
that they even have a say in what's
going on.
Without getting too misty-eyed, I
have to say that I loved it here. I wish
I could have stayed longer, in fact. I
wish that I didn't have to try so hard
to feel like I knew what Stanford was
about. I wish I had attended a few
more Stanford events. But most of all,
I wish my friend, another one-year
master's student, knew where the
front door of the Co Ho was.

The fear goes both ways. Master's
students, bewildered about how they
managed to get in here and equally
confused by silly undergrad abbrevia
tions (hey, I can eat Fro Yo at the Co
Ho before going to Mem Chu with the
best of them), never get involved in
campus activities, and never really feel
like they were a part of the Stanford
community.
It's just a lack of time many might
say. You can't expect people to bond
with Stanford in one year when every
one else has four or more.
Wrong. The amount of time spent in
a place has very little to do with how
much you like it. It all has to do with
bikes — stay with me on this one.
Riding a bike at Stanford is one of

the great and unique parts of the expe
rience here. Everyone's amazed (and
usually pretty annoyed) at the army of
bikes that can be found near any cam
pus building at any time of the day.
At no other place in the world can
you whip around a corner on your
bike, speed down Escondido Road, and
look up at an early rising moon to see
the mountains on the other side of the
Bay. Thank God for the clear skies of
California. You feel part of something
when you pass the other Stanfordites
riding their bikes, feel the breeze in
your hair, then notice that a stranger
of the opposite sex is smiling warmly
at you {no one at my frigid East Coast
undergraduate school smiles — the
spit on your teeth might freeze).
But most of the 2,772 master's stu
dents are here for only one year, and
have a car to got them to class and
back. That's all they need. No big
errands to run on campus (unless they
need to get to the library), no meetings
to attend, no rallies to protest at. The
Daily is supplanted by The New York
Times. What gay sculpture vandalism?
What do you mean, hunger strike?
Their social life is almost equally as
in-touch with Stanford tradition. They're

hanging out at the Blue Chalk with all
the other Paly yuppies when undergrads
are dancing in their underwear on the
Stanfords' tombs during the Halloween
bash. They think Exotic Erotic has some
thing to do with Adam & Eve catalogs.
They would rather sit in their condo-fied
apartments and watch CNN with the
fifth bowl of pasta they've eaten that
week than check out the Spring Faire or
the Powwow.
These people are not total duds
(well, perhaps some of them are — and
we won't mention the 4,657 doctoral
students). They have been shut out,
unwittingly or not, by the Stanford
undergrads. This artificial dividing line
between the master's students, the
often-milked cash cows of the Universi
ty, and the undergrads leave the grads
in the dark politically and socially.
Maybe it's a bit like the snobs at
Oxford University who look down on
anyone studying overseas for only a
few months. Apparently many Ameri
can students not attending for a full
year aren't invited to the much-vaunt
ed faculty teas and other erudite wine
affairs, and lack certain library privi
leges.
Well, master's students haven't yet

been invited to tea. Stanford has had
to face the possibility of internal
disharmony this year. The protests
and backlashes after the "No Grapes"
and "Gay Liberation" sculpture van
dalism incidents have shown that
Stanford may be more splintered than
we would like to think.
But everyone's inclusion to the
Stanford community is essential before
talking about coming to an agreement
on campus issues. You can't agree on
something when half of the people
involved go back to the grad ghetto
(Escondido) every day at five and for
get that they're Stanford students,
that they even have a say in what's
going on.
Without getting too misty-eyed, I
have to say that I loved it here. I wish
I could have stayed longer, in fact. I
wish that I didn't have to try so hard
to feel like I knew what Stanford was
about. I wish I had attended a few
more Stanford events. But most of all,
I wish my friend, another one-year
master's student, knew where the
front door of the Co Ho was.

LOOK AROUND at graduation.
You may see some curious-look
ing graduates, shifty-eyed as
they march, nervously picking at their
hoods, wondering if someone's going to
catch them for some heinous crime.
Their crime is stealing a degree in
one year — they are the thousands of
one-year master's students who go in
and out of the Farm every year, barely
stopping to look at the palm trees. And
I'll be the first to admit that I'm one
of them.
We are a different breed from the
rest of you. We are the fish outside of
the fishbowl, the people who feel
sheepish buying a cap and gown. We
are the ugly sister of Stanford.
So ugly that we get left out of fami
ly affairs. When campus issues are dis
cussed, campus activists often talk
about the sentiment "on campus" or
refer to a generic "student." Most of
them probably have their friends from
Stern, Roble, or Flo Mo in mind, not
graduate students. Only when we can
speak of Stanford students as encom
passing the entire student body will
there be a true discussion on impor
tant issues that affect everyone.
Fortunately for me, I decided to try

to get a taste for Stanford even if I had
only one year to do it. I juggled work
ing at The Daily with being a grad stu
dent, and it worked. Forced to read the
Opinions page every day, I couldn't
help but feel Stanfordish. Hut I know
from experience that Stanford is really
only half of a community — a collec
tion of undergrads who are scared to
traverse the haunted grounds of Rains
or Escondido Village, where the wild
things are.
The fear goes both ways. Master's
students, bewildered about how they
managed to get in here and equally
confused by silly undergrad abbrevia
tions (hey, I can eat Fro Yo at the Co
Ho before going to Mem Chu with the
best of them), never get involved in
campus activities, and never really feel
