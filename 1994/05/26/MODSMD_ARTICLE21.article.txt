## Olmstead steady amid whirlwind Senior designated hitter provides leadership with consistent bat 
### Andy Eiser Senior staff writer 
If one word could summarize the
1994 Cardinal baseball season, from
the unexpected surge of the pitching
staff to occasional lapses in offensive
production to the recent incident
involving alleged campus vandalism, it
would be "inconsistency."
Where does Nate Olmstead, Stan
ford's senior designated hitter, fit into
that summary?
He doesn't.
Olmstead, a Davis, Calif., native,
rises above the everyday trials of both
his teammates and the program. The
Cardinal's only senior regular in a
sport that encourages eligible juniors
to bolt for the professional draft, Olm
stead provides undisputed leadership
and remains the most reliable compo
nent of head coach Mark Marquess'
lineup.
"He's years ahead of his age," Mar
quess said. "He almost knows the com
ments I'm going to make before I make
them."
Not that Marquess has had to direct
many comments toward his switch-hit
ting cleanup man this season. Heading
into Austin, Texas, for this weekend's
Central Regional College World Series
qualifier, Olmstead sports a remark

able .388 average and a nine-game hit
ting streak, his fifth run of five or more
games in the year.
But just as the Cardinal improved
from an average team (15-13) in non
conference play to a superb one (21-9)
in Pacific 10 Conference Southern
Division action, Olmstead took his
game up yet another notch in crunch
time. Batting over .400 in Six-Pac
games, he led Stanford to its first con
ference crown since 1990.
"I just try to stay relaxed and see the
ball," said Olmstead, whose .345 career
average currently ranks in the Cardi
nal's top-10 all-time. "I break every
thing down and keep it simple."
With a studious approach that leads
to what Marquess calls a "grasp of the
game," Olmstead can simply take con
trol of a contest despite getting only a
few minutes of playing time each game.
Take, for example, a 4-for-4 showing
May 10 in his final game at Sunken
Diamond, when Olmstead keyed an 8-1
Stanford victory over his hometown
UC-Davis Aggies. After the Aggies
scored the game's first run in the top of
the second inning, Olmstead sparked a
three-run bottom half for the Cardinal
by beating out a leadoff infield single.
He then lined a third-inning single
to right, and followed with a three-run
homer in the fifth to double Stanford's
advantage. Then, for good measure,
Olmstead landed a double in the left
centerfield gap during his eighth
inning appearance before giving way to
a pinch-runner and a standing ovation.
"I couldn't have been happier for
him," said junior leftfielder Steve
Carver. "There was no better way to go
out, and it was a reflection of his
effort."
After cracking the lineup just 42
times in his first three years in a Car
dinal uniform, Olmstead's efforts have
earned him 54 starts in Stanford's 58
games in 1994. Aside from getting a
base-hit in all but nine of his appear
ances, Olmstead has kept his spot by
demonstrating a versatility rarely seen
in collegiate designated hitters.
To boot: Olmstead's run production
(46 RBI) makes him the second-most
productive Cardinal hitter behind
junior first baseman Dusty Allen, while

his power (five home runs) ranks
behind only Allen and junior second
baseman Jed Hansen. Olmstead has
even been known to flash some speed,
stealing seven bases in nine attempts
as the team has enjoyed its most suc
cessful season on the basepaths since
1988, when Stanford last won the
World Series.
"I projected him to play, but not the
role he has," Marquess said. "He was
not penciled into the four-spot, but he
just settled in there. Although he's not
a 'rah-rah' kind of guy, he goes out and
does everything right."
By setting an example for his team
mates on the field, Olmstead has also
accepted a quiet leadership role in the
Cardinal clubhouse. Among other acts,
he helped Carver out of a late-season
slump, and offered motivation to fresh
man pitcher Jason Middlebrook before
Middlebrook threw a no-hitter against
UCLA May 8.
But at no time has Olmstead's
seniority been tested more severely
than during the current vandalism
controversy, which left sophomore
third baseman Brian Dallimore and
junior reserve infielder Todd Laßocca
out of regional play and put freshman
pitcher Brendan Sullivan on a one
game suspension. Add to that Allen's
one-game mandated absence stemming
from a fighting ejection at Arizona
State May 15, and Stanford has
endured an off-the-field circus in the
last two weeks.
"We've had distractions all year,
and this is just something else we have
to try to block out and concentrate,"
Olmstead said. "I think the team
knows how to do it."
Olmstead stressed to teammates
that their concern for the alleged van
dals should run beyond eligibility
issues.
"I told them that we should keep
together and be good friends to our
teammates," Olmstead said. "But then
we also have to go about baseball as it
always is, and the more we can block
out when we're on the field, the better
we'll be."
