# Sailing prepares for triple threat of nationals
## Stanford heads back east for women's, team and coed dinghy championships 
### Jeremy Stone Staff writer 
While other students are
immersed in studying for Finals,
Stanford's sailing team will be in
Connecticut, competing in finals
of its own.
The national sailing champi
onships will occur in three sec
tions beginning today in Con
necticut. The highly ranked Stan
ford team has outside shots at
titles in each competition. The
first title up for grabs is the
women's. Between today and Sat
urday, the No. 3 Cardinal women
will seek their first No. 1 ranking
since the middle of 1984. Then,
from May 30-June 1, the Team
Race National Championship is at
stake. Finally, the Coed Dinghy
National Championships will
round out the 10-day journey
June 2-4.
The women have the best
opportunity for a victory in the
regatta hosted by Yale. The Car
dinal women will have to show
their versatility, as both 420 sand
Flying Juniors will be sailed.
After a 51-point rout at the Pacif
ic Coast Championships, they are
poised to dethrone No. 1 St.
Mary's (Md.), No. 2 Tufts and 13
other universities. Stanford fared
well in recent competition against
the powerhouses at the St. Mary's
Invitational on March 19-20,
defeating the home team and los
ing to Tufts by a mere two points.
Stanford will need strong per
formances from its A division
team of skipper Gretchen Uznis
and crew Sibyl Diver. The sopho
mores won the A division at the
St. Mary's Invitational two
months ago. If the weather calls
for a heavier crew, freshman Alice
Manard will step in, as she did
occasionally at St. Mary's.
The B division group, sophomore
skipper Cinnamon Hampikian and

crew Michelle Derbenwick, also a
sophomore, struggled at St. Mary's,
placing fourth. If they start off
poorly, Manard could return to her
customary role of skipper, and
junior Polly Brown could serve as
crew. Coach Steve Bourdow also
wouldn't rule out the possibility of
using potential All-America crew
Senior Britt Johnson in either divi
sion, but he hopes to save her for
the remaining two nationals.
Bourdow said the team's goal
is to finish in the top three. How
ever, Johnson said last week that
"we should either probably win
nationals or at least get top
three."
Regardless of the outcome of
the women's regatta, the team
will regroup Sunday and prepare
for the Team Race Nationals
beginning Memorial Day in New
London. The Coast Guard Acade
my will host this event, which is
sailed in Flying Juniors. A total of
12 teams will be there, including
Tufts, Old Dominion, Navy, Col
lege of Charleston and UC-Irvine,
whom Stanford defeated in the
Team Race PCCs last month.
Stanford has not participated
against most of the East Coast
schools in team race action this
season.
Stanford's three teams will
come as no surprise. The skipper
crew combos will be junior
Charles Meade and freshman
Letitia Yang, senior Scott Sellers
and a revolving crew of Johnson
and Sujata Patel, also seniors,
and senior Jeremy Mclntyre and
Don Chennavasin, a freshman.
Senior Rolf Kaiser, sophomore
Catherine Adams-Simmons,
senior Jeremy Hinman and Man
ard will be standing by and will
step in if needed.
Bourdow said the goal there is
to be top four, meaning that Stan

ford would qualify for the final
round of racing, since after the
first rounds of racing the other
eight teams are eliminated.
"We hope to continue on and
finish top three. We can definite
ly do that," he added. "We've got
a good, solid team racing team.
To win the regatta, we would
have to sail very well against the
tougher teams and not lose to
any of the teams that we expect
to beat. Then some other teams
that are really high quality
would have to make some mis
takes."
The same will hold true for
the Coed Dinghy National Cham
pionships that will be held on the
same waters. Stanford will put
its No. 4 ranking to the ultimate

test against 15 other squads.
Much of the competition will be
similar to the Thompson Trophy
Intersectional held last month,
where Stanford placed third,
behind Old Dominion and Col
lege of Charleston. Tufts, Navy,
St. Mary's and California will
also be teams to watch for.
Bovirdow will surprise some
observers by shaking up the
alignment Stanford has used all
year. Meade and Yang will make
their debut as Stanford's A-divi
sion team after spending much of
the year in C or B divisions.
Meade has been Stanford's top
sailor for the past couple
months, while Sellers, the team
captain, has struggled at times.
"[Meade] has pretty much
earned it," Bourdow said. "The
team kind of expects it. It won't
be a big surprise, really."
Sellers and his crew of Patel
and Johnson will instead sail in

the B division, and Mclntyre and
Chennavasin will hope they
won't be needed as back-ups.
Kaiser, Adams-Simmons, Man
ard and Hinman could all see
action, depending on conditions.
"Our goal is top five," Bour
dow said. "We'd like to finish top
three; that would be really good,
but we'll be happy with top five."
Bourdow also expressed con
cern about recent poor starts by
Stanford. "If we can make the
top three, we really need our
starting skippers to start doing
the job right away and stay with
it,"he said.
However, he will not be afraid
to make changes, if necessary.
"We've got three really good
skippers, and Mclntyre has some
expertise in the 420s that the
other two may not necessarily
have," he said. "If we need him
to take care of business, that's
where it will be."

from May 30-June 1, the Team
Race National Championship is at
stake. Finally, the Coed Dinghy
National Championships will
round out the 10-day journey
June 2-4.
The women have the best
opportunity for a victory in the
regatta hosted by Yale. The Car
dinal women will have to show
their versatility, as both 420 sand
Flying Juniors will be sailed.
After a 51-point rout at the Pacif
ic Coast Championships, they are
poised to dethrone No. 1 St.
Mary's (Md.), No. 2 Tufts and 13
other universities. Stanford fared
well in recent competition against
the powerhouses at the St. Mary's
Invitational on March 19-20,
defeating the home team and los
ing to Tufts by a mere two points.
Stanford will need strong per
formances from its A division
team of skipper Gretchen Uznis
and crew Sibyl Diver. The sopho
mores won the A division at the
St. Mary's Invitational two
months ago. If the weather calls
for a heavier crew, freshman Alice
Manard will step in, as she did
occasionally at St. Mary's.
The B division group, sophomore
skipper Cinnamon Hampikian and

crew Michelle Derbenwick, also a
sophomore, struggled at St. Mary's,
placing fourth. If they start off
poorly, Manard could return to her
customary role of skipper, and
junior Polly Brown could serve as
crew. Coach Steve Bourdow also
wouldn't rule out the possibility of
using potential All-America crew
Senior Britt Johnson in either divi
sion, but he hopes to save her for
the remaining two nationals.
Bourdow said the team's goal
is to finish in the top three. How
ever, Johnson said last week that
"we should either probably win
nationals or at least get top
three."
Regardless of the outcome of
the women's regatta, the team
will regroup Sunday and prepare
for the Team Race Nationals
beginning Memorial Day in New
London. The Coast Guard Acade
my will host this event, which is
sailed in Flying Juniors. A total of
12 teams will be there, including
Tufts, Old Dominion, Navy, Col
lege of Charleston and UC-Irvine,
whom Stanford defeated in the
Team Race PCCs last month.
Stanford has not participated
against most of the East Coast
schools in team race action this
season.
Stanford's three teams will
come as no surprise. The skipper
crew combos will be junior
Charles Meade and freshman
Letitia Yang, senior Scott Sellers
and a revolving crew of Johnson
and Sujata Patel, also seniors,
and senior Jeremy Mclntyre and
Don Chennavasin, a freshman.
Senior Rolf Kaiser, sophomore
Catherine Adams-Simmons,
senior Jeremy Hinman and Man
ard will be standing by and will
step in if needed.
Bourdow said the goal there is
to be top four, meaning that Stan

ford would qualify for the final
round of racing, since after the
first rounds of racing the other
eight teams are eliminated.
"We hope to continue on and
finish top three. We can definite
ly do that," he added. "We've got
a good, solid team racing team.
To win the regatta, we would
have to sail very well against the
tougher teams and not lose to
any of the teams that we expect
to beat. Then some other teams
that are really high quality
would have to make some mis
takes."
The same will hold true for
the Coed Dinghy National Cham
pionships that will be held on the
same waters. Stanford will put
its No. 4 ranking to the ultimate

test against 15 other squads.
Much of the competition will be
similar to the Thompson Trophy
Intersectional held last month,
where Stanford placed third,
behind Old Dominion and Col
lege of Charleston. Tufts, Navy,
St. Mary's and California will
also be teams to watch for.
Bovirdow will surprise some
observers by shaking up the
alignment Stanford has used all
year. Meade and Yang will make
their debut as Stanford's A-divi
sion team after spending much of
the year in C or B divisions.
Meade has been Stanford's top
sailor for the past couple
months, while Sellers, the team
captain, has struggled at times.
"[Meade] has pretty much
earned it," Bourdow said. "The
team kind of expects it. It won't
be a big surprise, really."
Sellers and his crew of Patel
and Johnson will instead sail in

the B division, and Mclntyre and
Chennavasin will hope they
won't be needed as back-ups.
Kaiser, Adams-Simmons, Man
ard and Hinman could all see
action, depending on conditions.
"Our goal is top five," Bour
dow said. "We'd like to finish top
three; that would be really good,
but we'll be happy with top five."
Bourdow also expressed con
cern about recent poor starts by
Stanford. "If we can make the
top three, we really need our
starting skippers to start doing
the job right away and stay with
it,"he said.
However, he will not be afraid
to make changes, if necessary.
"We've got three really good
skippers, and Mclntyre has some
expertise in the 420s that the
other two may not necessarily
have," he said. "If we need him
to take care of business, that's
where it will be."
While other students are
immersed in studying for Finals,
Stanford's sailing team will be in
Connecticut, competing in finals
of its own.
The national sailing champi
onships will occur in three sec
tions beginning today in Con
necticut. The highly ranked Stan
ford team has outside shots at
titles in each competition. The
first title up for grabs is the
women's. Between today and Sat
urday, the No. 3 Cardinal women
will seek their first No. 1 ranking
since the middle of 1984. Then,
from May 30-June 1, the Team
