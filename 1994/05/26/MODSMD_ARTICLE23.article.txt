# A 						runner's high?
## Marathon training: just a typical summer 
### 
When asked about my
summer plans, my
answer is pretty stan
dard — living at home, taking
classes, volunteering at a hospi
tal, going on weekend camping
trips with friends, training for a
marathon. Wait a sec, did you
say marathon? You mean like
the 26-mile kind? Actually, 26.4.
At this point, some people
have told me that it sounds like
an ambitious but cool goal,
maybe something they've
thought about also. Most have
just raised their eyebrows and
given me a look like I'm com
pletely insane.
Maybe I am, but that's what
running will do to you. Coming
to Stanford as high school ath
letes, some choose to take up
club sports or IMs. Instead I
opted for the Campus Drive loop
as a way to stay in shape and
relieve the stresses of freshman
life.
Little did I know that over
the next two years, running
would become so important to
me, not just as a way of blowing
off steam but as a time to myself
to think or just zone out,
depending on my state of mind.
Last summer my training part
ner (also my mom) and I decided
to enter some local races, partly
out of curiosity, partly just to get
some good-looking t-shirts.
We started out pretty mod
estly. Our first race was a
Fourth of July 5K Fun Run, an
all-out sprint for some, more of a
medium-paced introduction to
the whole racing concept.
Spurred by our blue ribbon in

the mother-daughter category
(in which, admittedly, we were
the only entrants), we moved up
to the next level, the 10K.
This distance, about 6.5
miles, proved much more chal
lenging, especially around mile
five. At this point, the well
trained runners with that hard
core, steely look in their eyes and
the calves to match, were "kick
ing in" their reserve energy. I, on
the other hand, was just concen
trating on not losing my break
fast. After running two more
IOKs and improving our times to
around the 45-minute mark, we
decided to up the mileage even
farther and set our goal on the
Seattle Half Marathon the day
after Thanksgiving.
After two months of formal
training, long runs and speed
workouts included, I felt well
prepared yet still nervous
because I had never done the
whole 13.2 miles. On that blus
tery November day, my body
definitely felt each one of what
seemed more like 30 miles as my
mom and I huffed along the nar
row trail running through north
Seattle.

While I think my legs went
numb around mile 10, we both
made it under our goal time of
two hours. When I crossed the
finish line, I couldn't even con
ceive of turning around and cov
ering the course again. Why
then am I going to do a
marathon? Good question.
My only answer would be for
the pure challenge of the race. It
sounds ridiculously corny but
after running half the distance
and seeing the marathoners
come in beaming smiles of
accomplishment, I'm inspired
toward the same goal. The next
step — training.
Dozens of books have been
written on the marathon. They
cover everything from running

form to training schedules to
injuries. While many hold their
own theories about the total
optimal training mileage, the
authors agree that the "long
run" is key to finishing the race.
Whether one trains by time or
mileage, this run should be
increased every two weeks, even
tually to the full 26 miles and
even beyond to a longest of 28.
At our pace, that means a
good four hours-plus of pound
ing the pavement. Is this really
how I want to spend my sum
mer weekends? Strangely
enough, yes. Maybe it's a run
ner's high of sorts, maybe it's
just knowing that come Octo
ber, I'm going to be glad I put in
the extra miles.

Sarah welcomes any advice or
marathon stories to inspire her
during the next 19 weeks before
the Portland Marathon.
