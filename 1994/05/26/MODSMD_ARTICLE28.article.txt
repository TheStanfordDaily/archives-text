"Dave" is an anthropology major, class of
2094, who recently unearthed previously
undiscovered footage of Stanford University
in the 19905. Here are the results of his ex
haustive research.
I'm afraid you wouldn't recognize the
Stanford of today in the footage I've
unearthed. First of all, the concept of
fashion was entirely different. Students
enjoy wearing wheels of all kinds; the more
adventuresome sport foot-extensions of
three-wheels on each foot, while others live
on top of two bigger wheels. As far as my re
search can tell, this seems to be a sort of as
cetic masochism, as students routinely run
into walls, trees and, more frequently, each
other, creating a bloody mess of undergrad
uate limbs.
Apparently, once a student has achieved
the appropriate number of accidents, he or
she is promoted to graduate status and
awarded a "helmet," a colorful plastic hat
which serves to keep out the rain.
There are also a number of interesting
rituals connected with the contraption

called bicycle. There is a fascinating dance
done in celebration upon leaving class: I call
it the "bike-360-wail." It consists of leaving
the History Corner, spinning around sever
al times as if searching for a lost bike, and
wailing, beating the chest loudly, when un
able to locate it. Invariably, the dance ends
when the student's friend points to a de
crepit piece of metal and asks, "Isn't that
your bike?" The student leaves off wailing
and smilingly drives away, getting into a cer
emonious accident.
There appears to be a plethora of similar
dances. For example, the students are anx
ious to perform a May Day dance every
spring. Our typical student arrives at a
group of friends, ducking and skirting
around every tree. When she gets to her
friends, they pull at her hair and clothes as
she squirms and cries, until they find a little
worm and throw it away. The movements

involve convulsions and contortions,
squeals and shivers until the offending
worm is gone.
The students' conception of fun was rad
ically different in the 19905. They attend
movie festivals called Flicks. The entire
campus piles into one auditorium and
throws little white balls at people on a
screen. This practice was discontinued
when it was discovered that a well-timed
bomb could destroy the future of the Unit
ed States.
Other weekend activities, before the new
grading plan went into effect, include
"party-hopping." In this activity, women get
dressed early in the evening and proceed to
drink as much barley juice as is humanly
possible. Then they stumble down the street
to where men are performing the same hy
dration techniques and they begin to do a
version of the worm-dance. Amazingly,

once the students consider the action bor
ing, they scamper off to another party,
where the exact same music is playing. Occa
sionally a band, in which 90 percent of the
members played guitar, strummed those
same tunes.
They attempt to saunter to the third
party when the overwhelming desire to
link arms and tongues overcomes them.
The ritual is complete on Monday morn
ing, when they have to face their TMR (to
tally meaningless relationship) in CIV sec
tion.
And, of course, you can always find a few
clueless students performing pointless ac
tivities in their free time. They run around
in large circles, climb stairs to nowhere and
lift heavy metal bars high, only to put them
back down again. Go figure!
So we should all be thankful we live in the
21st century, without all these pointless
campus rituals. As I watch my CIV class on
TV with my multicultural Martian-Ameri
can friends, I am continuously reminded of
the hilarity of hindsight and the sobering
power of self-ridicule. ■
