# Warren's G funk era: Where life is rhythm
## 
### Cheo H. Coker 
Rs Casey Siemask/o explains six minutes
and 36 seconds into "Young Guns," regu
lation is no occupation for the squea
mish. "You can't be just any geek off the
street," he says with a haughty air of defiance
now immortalized by a Warren G sample.
"You gotta be handy with the steel, if you
know what 1 mean, to earn your keep."
Forces of regulation don't change a bit
when applied to the "Lickshot/Dollar, dollar
bill, y'all" world of hip-hop. You have to be
handy with the "steel" — youknowwhutum
sayin — to maintain the rep that's so hard to
earn. The "steel" in question could be the
"Sword-like" tongue of Wu-Tang Clan lore,
two Technics 1200MKII turntables or one's
quickness with a Tec-9 on these "Dodge
City"-like streets. Lucky thing that as a pro
ducer, D.J. and artist, Warren CI has always
sustained the necessary regulation skills to
make a name for himself. Whether the "G" in
his "G-Funk Era" stands for "Clock,"
"Gangsta," "Coin' For Broke" or "Griffin," it
all describes exactly who he is.
"That's all there was was drama," Dr. Dre's
half brother and Snoop Doggy Dogg's best
friend says about the East Long Beach area
where he grew up. His single from the "Above
The Rim" soundtrack, "Regulate," has domi
nated the radio and retail charts, and his
album is perhaps the most eagerly anticipat
ed release of the summer. Tall, lanky and
more charming than a prom date trying to
impress someone's father, Warren Griffin 111
comfortably spreads out his slender f>' 3"
frame on a pastel couch while answering
questions about the geographic area that has
caused the greatest stir in pop sales since the
Seattle scene exploded like Kurt Cobain's
fragile head.
"We just be sitting in the park and the big
guys, say like when 1 was 13 or 16 and we'd try
to be cool by hanging around them and
someone would eventually say 'Let's put this
little nigga on.' So they'd come up, and we'd
squab, you would have to fight three people
and get beat up. It's just crazy. I don't think
shit is going to kick back until these OGs get
these young niggas' head straight."
1 always find it interesting, I tell him, how
the artists with the most real street reputa
tions are always the ones that are the most
laid back and soft-spoken when you meet
them in person, and that it's the baldheaded
ex-club dancers-turned-roughnecks shout
ing boasts to convince themselves of their va
lidity that are co-opting the "real" as a way to
sell records, ruining the genre. Not that it
phases him or anything.
"You don't hear me talking about killing
anybody," he sings with that distinctive Cali
fornia drawl. "Like I said, I'm laid back, but if
somebody press up on me, they'll get pressed
up upon. I don't start nothing with nobody. I
used to be where I started stuff, but I done
gained my sense of humor. My definition of

'Regulate' means that if someone tries to do
something wrong to you, and you get away
from it, then you got to go back and do what
you gotta do. That's as real as I can come with
that.
"A nigga tried to shoot me, it wasn't too
long ago," he explains with the same casual
manner someone else might mention losing
a Super Bowl wager. His personal manager
Mel and I sit up as he relates the story barber
shop style.
"This was the summer that just passed. It
was over this girl, I was bustin' first. I got
with her, we kicked it, so I left her alone.
Then this guy gets with her, and she was still
trying to get at me, he sees her, and he gets
mad and shit. I'm like if she got to do all that,
then she wasn't mine in the first place. Go on
and take it.
"So one day I was driving down the street
and as I turned, a gang of niggas standing on
the side yelled, 'Warren, Warren,' then I heard
the first shots. Bat bat. So I said, OK. I came
back around the corner, I was getting ready to
start dumping, and this sucka meets me.
BOP BOP BOP BOP BOP BOP. He didn't hit
me one time, although he hit the car a whole
bunch of times. I felt that shit," he says as he
shows how bullets narrowly passed his head
and impacted in other areas of the dash
board.
"So 1 was like, 'Fuck that.' Dude thought
he was getting away, so he drove up the street.
And I knew what he was going to do, cause I
always know what those muthafuckas are
going to do. I drove up this next street and
met him right there. YATA YATA YATA YATA
YATA." Warren motions with his longer fin
gers in the shape of two guns, lighting up the
scene "hard boiled"-style. "Let him have it,"
he continues, "lust to let him know, 'Don't
try to get at me like that. Over no skirt *
"And the same dude later came over to me
at a car wash to apologize. I had my shit in my
right hand walking up to him like 'whazzup'
and he's looking at me like he wants to do
something. Then the brother that owns the
car wash said to me, 'Man, you need to chill
with that. Give me the gun.' So I did and I said
to the dude, 'We can handle this from the
shoulder, whazzup!? What you wanna do?'
And he was 'Ah man, it ain't even like that,
some dude was telling me that you was going
to try to kill me and all this, do this and
that.... 1 ain't gonna never try to shoot at
you again. But I still don't trust him.
"I swear I felt 'em," he says of the bullets,
shaking his head. His face loses its boyish
quality and looks quite serious. "Fuck this!
Them bullets is serious. Muthafuckas be tak
ing that shit as a joke. That shit is real."
"Strings, chords, we brings .. . Melody. Ci-
Funk. Where rhythm is life and life is rhythm."
— Front "Regulate"

There's so much drama in the LBC
sometimes it's easy to forget about the
music. But the funk permeates every part of
the Long Beach experience. Bass lines that
undulate like the nearby Pacific waves,
organ hits that might bring even Bernie
Worrell to tears of joy and melodies so
catchy, you wouldn't be surprised to catch
mom crooning them in the shower. New
Jack Swing was dying a slow, antagonizing
death, and the Gangsta Funk Era finally put
a 9mm to its weary temple.
Instead of wasting so much time using the
music as means to beg for the punanny, War
ren's funk re-introduces the genre's complex
ity. Rhythm and blues can come smooth and
brutal, nasty yet delicate as it did when peo
ple like Al Green, Sly Stone, Parliament-
Funkadelic and War held the reigns. It can
even manage in its lyrics, as the work of Ste
vie Wonder and Marvin Gaye proved, to in
troduce political and sociological themes, as
well as contextualize the true feelings of a lost
generation.
His music comes with the gangsta themes
and messages to wannabe players to raise the
level of the game, linking it to Snoop, yet
comes with a profound deepness to his feel
good ambience that Domino could only
dream about.
"Regulate ... The G Funk Fra" comes

with such a variety of styles, it isn't the same
old tunk that ruins so many records that push
for this next level and fall by the wayside.
From the smooth "Hot Fun In The Summer
time" retro-groove of "This Is The Shack," to
the straight up funk kick of "So Many Ways,"
the LP lulls with stylish verve. But with the vi
sually introspective "Do You See" and the
West Coast jazz funker, "And Ya Don't Stop,"
it becomes readily apparent that there is a lot
more to Warren's talents that haven't even
come to fruition yet.
"While other people just have simple bass
loops, I come with live bass and make the
music over again," he says, when asked
about his secret. "While everybody does
this," moving his finger in a straight line, "I
do this," he demonstrates, moving his hands
and pursing his lips into the shape of a
polyrhythmic bassline. "I let the music
ride."
Regulation is about controlling flow. Reg
ulators like Warren G protect their own and
always show and prove.
"We're trying to come up like anybody else
and it's time for us to get paid. We've been
down for too lone.' ■

and take it.
"So one day I was driving down the street
and as I turned, a gang of niggas standing on
the side yelled, 'Warren, Warren,' then I heard
the first shots. Bat bat. So I said, OK. I came
back around the corner, I was getting ready to
start dumping, and this sucka meets me.
BOP BOP BOP BOP BOP BOP. He didn't hit
me one time, although he hit the car a whole
bunch of times. I felt that shit," he says as he
shows how bullets narrowly passed his head
and impacted in other areas of the dash
board.
"So 1 was like, 'Fuck that.' Dude thought
he was getting away, so he drove up the street.
And I knew what he was going to do, cause I
always know what those muthafuckas are
going to do. I drove up this next street and
met him right there. YATA YATA YATA YATA
YATA." Warren motions with his longer fin
gers in the shape of two guns, lighting up the
scene "hard boiled"-style. "Let him have it,"
he continues, "lust to let him know, 'Don't
try to get at me like that. Over no skirt *
"And the same dude later came over to me
at a car wash to apologize. I had my shit in my
right hand walking up to him like 'whazzup'
and he's looking at me like he wants to do
something. Then the brother that owns the
car wash said to me, 'Man, you need to chill
with that. Give me the gun.' So I did and I said
to the dude, 'We can handle this from the
shoulder, whazzup!? What you wanna do?'
And he was 'Ah man, it ain't even like that,
some dude was telling me that you was going
to try to kill me and all this, do this and
that.... 1 ain't gonna never try to shoot at
you again. But I still don't trust him.
"I swear I felt 'em," he says of the bullets,
shaking his head. His face loses its boyish
quality and looks quite serious. "Fuck this!
Them bullets is serious. Muthafuckas be tak
ing that shit as a joke. That shit is real."
"Strings, chords, we brings .. . Melody. Ci-
Funk. Where rhythm is life and life is rhythm."
— Front "Regulate"

There's so much drama in the LBC
sometimes it's easy to forget about the
music. But the funk permeates every part of
the Long Beach experience. Bass lines that
undulate like the nearby Pacific waves,
organ hits that might bring even Bernie
Worrell to tears of joy and melodies so
catchy, you wouldn't be surprised to catch
mom crooning them in the shower. New
Jack Swing was dying a slow, antagonizing
death, and the Gangsta Funk Era finally put
a 9mm to its weary temple.
Instead of wasting so much time using the
music as means to beg for the punanny, War
ren's funk re-introduces the genre's complex
ity. Rhythm and blues can come smooth and
brutal, nasty yet delicate as it did when peo
ple like Al Green, Sly Stone, Parliament-
Funkadelic and War held the reigns. It can
even manage in its lyrics, as the work of Ste
vie Wonder and Marvin Gaye proved, to in
troduce political and sociological themes, as
well as contextualize the true feelings of a lost
generation.
His music comes with the gangsta themes
and messages to wannabe players to raise the
level of the game, linking it to Snoop, yet
comes with a profound deepness to his feel
good ambience that Domino could only
dream about.
"Regulate ... The G Funk Fra" comes

with such a variety of styles, it isn't the same
old tunk that ruins so many records that push
for this next level and fall by the wayside.
From the smooth "Hot Fun In The Summer
time" retro-groove of "This Is The Shack," to
the straight up funk kick of "So Many Ways,"
the LP lulls with stylish verve. But with the vi
sually introspective "Do You See" and the
West Coast jazz funker, "And Ya Don't Stop,"
it becomes readily apparent that there is a lot
more to Warren's talents that haven't even
come to fruition yet.
"While other people just have simple bass
loops, I come with live bass and make the
music over again," he says, when asked
about his secret. "While everybody does
this," moving his finger in a straight line, "I
do this," he demonstrates, moving his hands
and pursing his lips into the shape of a
polyrhythmic bassline. "I let the music
ride."
Regulation is about controlling flow. Reg
ulators like Warren G protect their own and
always show and prove.
"We're trying to come up like anybody else
and it's time for us to get paid. We've been
down for too lone.' ■

Rs Casey Siemask/o explains six minutes
and 36 seconds into "Young Guns," regu
lation is no occupation for the squea
mish. "You can't be just any geek off the
street," he says with a haughty air of defiance
now immortalized by a Warren G sample.
"You gotta be handy with the steel, if you
know what 1 mean, to earn your keep."
Forces of regulation don't change a bit
when applied to the "Lickshot/Dollar, dollar
bill, y'all" world of hip-hop. You have to be
handy with the "steel" — youknowwhutum
sayin — to maintain the rep that's so hard to
earn. The "steel" in question could be the
"Sword-like" tongue of Wu-Tang Clan lore,
two Technics 1200MKII turntables or one's
quickness with a Tec-9 on these "Dodge
City"-like streets. Lucky thing that as a pro
ducer, D.J. and artist, Warren CI has always
sustained the necessary regulation skills to
make a name for himself. Whether the "G" in
his "G-Funk Era" stands for "Clock,"
"Gangsta," "Coin' For Broke" or "Griffin," it
all describes exactly who he is.
"That's all there was was drama," Dr. Dre's
half brother and Snoop Doggy Dogg's best
friend says about the East Long Beach area
where he grew up. His single from the "Above
The Rim" soundtrack, "Regulate," has domi
nated the radio and retail charts, and his
album is perhaps the most eagerly anticipat
ed release of the summer. Tall, lanky and
more charming than a prom date trying to
impress someone's father, Warren Griffin 111
comfortably spreads out his slender f>' 3"
frame on a pastel couch while answering
questions about the geographic area that has
caused the greatest stir in pop sales since the
Seattle scene exploded like Kurt Cobain's
fragile head.
"We just be sitting in the park and the big
guys, say like when 1 was 13 or 16 and we'd try
to be cool by hanging around them and
someone would eventually say 'Let's put this
little nigga on.' So they'd come up, and we'd
squab, you would have to fight three people
and get beat up. It's just crazy. I don't think
shit is going to kick back until these OGs get
these young niggas' head straight."
1 always find it interesting, I tell him, how
the artists with the most real street reputa
tions are always the ones that are the most
laid back and soft-spoken when you meet
them in person, and that it's the baldheaded
ex-club dancers-turned-roughnecks shout
ing boasts to convince themselves of their va
lidity that are co-opting the "real" as a way to
sell records, ruining the genre. Not that it
phases him or anything.
"You don't hear me talking about killing
anybody," he sings with that distinctive Cali
fornia drawl. "Like I said, I'm laid back, but if
somebody press up on me, they'll get pressed
up upon. I don't start nothing with nobody. I
used to be where I started stuff, but I done
gained my sense of humor. My definition of

'Regulate' means that if someone tries to do
something wrong to you, and you get away
from it, then you got to go back and do what
you gotta do. That's as real as I can come with
that.
"A nigga tried to shoot me, it wasn't too
long ago," he explains with the same casual
manner someone else might mention losing
a Super Bowl wager. His personal manager
Mel and I sit up as he relates the story barber
shop style.
"This was the summer that just passed. It
was over this girl, I was bustin' first. I got
with her, we kicked it, so I left her alone.
Then this guy gets with her, and she was still
trying to get at me, he sees her, and he gets
mad and shit. I'm like if she got to do all that,

"While other people just have simple bass
loops, I come with live bass and make the
music over again," he says, when asked
about his secret. "While everybody does
this," moving his finger in a straight line, "I

and pursing his lips into the shape of a
polyrhythmic bassline. "I let the music
ride."

ulators like Warren G protect their own and
always show and prove.
"We're trying to come up like anybody else
and it's time for us to get paid. We've been
down for too lone.' ■
