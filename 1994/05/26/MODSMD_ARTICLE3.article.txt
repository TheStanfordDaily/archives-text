# Proposed grad residences to ease demands

Two proposed graduate residences unveiled by
administrators at Tuesday's ASSU Senate meeting
may help curb complaints by graduate students that
they have not received enough attention in recent
years.
Under the plan, one residence would be located
near Governor's Corner and the other would replace
the trailers currently at Manzanita Park.
"The last three housing projects on campus have
been for undergraduates," said Director of Housing
and Dining Services Keith Guy. Though the projects
still must be approved in concept by the Board of
Trustees this summer, he said it could provide hous
ing for most of the unassigned single graduate stu
dents.
"We're looking at a net total of 350 added units,"
Guy said. This number approximately equals the de
mand which could not be met this year although, ac
cording to Guy, "we think demands can be variable."
Under the plan, the first development, which is
located on the western edge of campus and would
create about 250 new graduate spots, would be
ready by the fall of 1996, according to Guy.
The proposed Manzanita Park development,
meanwhile, is a project sponsored by the Graduate
School of Business. The new residence, which will
replace the portable trailers that currently occupy
the site, will serve as the host facility for the Busi-
ness School's Executive Educa
tion program.
The program brings corporate
executives to Stanford each sum
mer for conferences that run
from two weeks to a month. Par
ticipants are currently housed in
Lagunita Court, Florence Moore
Hall and other residences, Guy
said.
"The GSB is needing a more
upscale and modern facility," Guy
said. If approved by the Board of
Trustees, the new residence will
also provide some graduate stu
dent housing during the academic
year, he added.
"The beauty of this project is

that it meets both needs," he said.
The dorm is scheduled to be com
pleted by 1997.
The erection of the new resi
dence will also signal the final
elimination of the trailers, which
have housed students for several
decades.
"The trailers have been there
for a long time," Guy said. "It's
been a long-standing objective
to replace those temporary trail
ers with more permanent hous
â€¢ M n
ing.
The issue of housing has tradi
tionally been a sore one for many
graduate students. Guy said the
new developments will bolster the
University's efforts to provide
improved and expanded graduate
housing. "We're confident there
is enough demand to fill these
existing projects," he said.
