These characters are the creations of
Outside In, a 10-member summer reperto
ry group here on campus. Soon, the group
will be providing yet another season of free
outdoor theater to the Stanford community.
THEATER IN THE HOOP
The origins of the group can be traced back
to a two-quarter advanced acting workshop
offered two years ago. Winter Mead, a visiting
lecturer in the Drama Department, directed
the workshop. Under Reed's guidance, acting
talents were nurtured. And during those two
quarters, strong alliances were formed.
Upon completion of the workshop, the 12
students involved were eager to exercise their
skills collectively. They synergized their ef
forts to present the play "Cloud Nine." Un
able to find an indoor space to stage their
play, they made use of the red Hoop fountain
in front of Green Library. As the self-pro
claimed Red Hoop Players, the actors of
"Cloud Nine" replenished the long barren
fountain with flowing monologues and

rushing theatrics.
Ross McCall and Paco Farias, two
Outside In players, are thankful for
Mead's presence during the primordial
era of their acting troupe: "A lot of us
owe allegiance to Winter because he
brought us together and gave us a rea
son to believe in ourselves... as being
able to produce really high quality
work... and have a good time."
REKINDLING SUMMER DRAMA
The following year, Winter and the
student actors met once again. They
noticed that Stanford was lacking a
summer drama program. Years ago,
the MIA program and a summer con
servatory program delighted the Stan
ford community during the season;
however, both programs were elimi
nated. Willing to rekindle a lost Stan
ford feature, Mead et al formed Inside
Out, a non-profit summer repertory
group.
Last summer, the group presented
"Equus," "Twelfth Night" and "A Mid
summer Night's 1 )ream," a production
that attracted more than 400 people
and a thumbs-up review from the San

lose
Mercury
News.

SUMMER BETTER THAN OTHERS

This year, due to a copyright infringement,
the players have been renamed Outside In. Al
though the name may be different, the nature
of the group is still the same.
Outside In consists of five men and five
women, all of whom are diverse in age and
background. The female players include fresh
man Sarah Cathcart, junior Carolyn Laskow,
senior Tineke Van Berckalaer, senior Erin
Noble and post-grad Kira Snyder. The male
players are freshmen Geoff Sobelle and Jordan
Gelber, and seniors Farias, McCall and Zander
Teller. Teller and Noble are the producers of
Outside In, and the entire clan is directed by
Reed.
This summer, they plan to present Shake
speare's "The Tempest" and "Comedy of Er
rors," as well as "Our Country's Good," a con-

tem
porary work

about a group of Australian con
victs attempting to stage a play.
ANDROGYNY AND' CROSS-CASTMG
Besides providing an opportunity for sum
mer drama, Outside In also provides equal op
portunity in student theater.
McCall describes the group's desire to com
bat gender inequality in drama: "Normally
when you go to the call board at the Drama De
partment, you'll see that they'll say, 'We are to
do XY play, we need 19 men and five women.'
And what we wanted to say was that we're tired
of that."
Outside In, equally representative of the
sexes, ensures that all members will play a role.
If a certain work tends to have more characters
of a certain sex than the other, the group will
"cross-cast" — women will play "male" roles

and men will play "female" roles. According to
the Outside In members, sexual equality can
also he achieved via making some characters
more androgynous. "Androgynizing"
characters creates more acting opportu-
A nities for both men and women, they say.
W BRING A PICNIC BASKET
Outside In prides itself on being a
gender-neutral repertory troupe. The
troupe especially prides itself on the interesting
locales of its productions. Audience members
from past productions from have followed the
group from the wasteland of the barren Hoop
fountain for "Cloud Nine" to the lush foilage of
Frost Amphitheater for "A Midsummer's
Night Dream."
According to Farias, the group is always
searching for new locales: "We are looking for
new places ... possibly the Knoll, possibly the
new Earth Sciences building. There are so
many great places to have [outdoor] theater
here at Stanford."
Outside In was planning on staging this
summer's production of "The Tempest" on
one of the islands in the Inner Quad. However,
the university claims that it is illegal to use the
space. Instead of the "island," the group may
very well return to the Hoop.
To fully enjoy an Outside Inexperience, au
dience members should tote some lounge
chairs, blankets and even a picnic basket to the
show. The shows are free, although the group

always welcomes donations to sup
port its efforts. In addition, audience
members should prepare to observe
the occasional squirrel or other out
door theater intruders hamming it up
on stage. Members of the audience
should also prepare to suspend hear
ing the performance when a 747 roars
overhead.
By performing outdoors, the sound
proof walls, sound systems and barri
ers are stripped away. Incorporating
equal opportunity for casting, gender
no longer keeps actors away from ex
ploring new roles. The result? Simple,
straightforward, acoustic theater that
dares to turn the concepts of theater in
side out. ■

Outside In will start the 1994 summer
season with Shakespeare's "Comedy of
Errors." The show will premiere June 29
at 6 p.m. and will continue through July
2, as well as running from July (>-10. Lo
cation? To be announced. For more in
formation call 497-5469.

the workshop. Under Reed's guidance, acting
talents were nurtured. And during those two
quarters, strong alliances were formed.
Upon completion of the workshop, the 12
students involved were eager to exercise their
skills collectively. They synergized their ef
forts to present the play "Cloud Nine." Un
able to find an indoor space to stage their
play, they made use of the red Hoop fountain
in front of Green Library. As the self-pro
claimed Red Hoop Players, the actors of
"Cloud Nine" replenished the long barren
fountain with flowing monologues and

rushing theatrics.
Ross McCall and Paco Farias, two
Outside In players, are thankful for
Mead's presence during the primordial
era of their acting troupe: "A lot of us
owe allegiance to Winter because he
brought us together and gave us a rea
son to believe in ourselves... as being
able to produce really high quality
work... and have a good time."
REKINDLING SUMMER DRAMA
The following year, Winter and the
student actors met once again. They
noticed that Stanford was lacking a
summer drama program. Years ago,
the MIA program and a summer con
servatory program delighted the Stan
ford community during the season;
however, both programs were elimi
nated. Willing to rekindle a lost Stan
ford feature, Mead et al formed Inside
Out, a non-profit summer repertory
group.
Last summer, the group presented
"Equus," "Twelfth Night" and "A Mid
summer Night's 1 )ream," a production
that attracted more than 400 people
and a thumbs-up review from the San

lose
Mercury
News.

SUMMER BETTER THAN OTHERS

This year, due to a copyright infringement,
the players have been renamed Outside In. Al
though the name may be different, the nature
of the group is still the same.
Outside In consists of five men and five
women, all of whom are diverse in age and
background. The female players include fresh
man Sarah Cathcart, junior Carolyn Laskow,
senior Tineke Van Berckalaer, senior Erin
Noble and post-grad Kira Snyder. The male
players are freshmen Geoff Sobelle and Jordan
Gelber, and seniors Farias, McCall and Zander
Teller. Teller and Noble are the producers of
Outside In, and the entire clan is directed by
Reed.
This summer, they plan to present Shake
speare's "The Tempest" and "Comedy of Er
rors," as well as "Our Country's Good," a con-

tem
porary work

about a group of Australian con
victs attempting to stage a play.
ANDROGYNY AND' CROSS-CASTMG
Besides providing an opportunity for sum
mer drama, Outside In also provides equal op
portunity in student theater.
McCall describes the group's desire to com
bat gender inequality in drama: "Normally
when you go to the call board at the Drama De
partment, you'll see that they'll say, 'We are to
do XY play, we need 19 men and five women.'
And what we wanted to say was that we're tired
of that."
Outside In, equally representative of the
sexes, ensures that all members will play a role.
If a certain work tends to have more characters
of a certain sex than the other, the group will
"cross-cast" — women will play "male" roles

and men will play "female" roles. According to
the Outside In members, sexual equality can
also he achieved via making some characters
more androgynous. "Androgynizing"
characters creates more acting opportu-
A nities for both men and women, they say.
W BRING A PICNIC BASKET
Outside In prides itself on being a
gender-neutral repertory troupe. The
troupe especially prides itself on the interesting
locales of its productions. Audience members
from past productions from have followed the
group from the wasteland of the barren Hoop
fountain for "Cloud Nine" to the lush foilage of
Frost Amphitheater for "A Midsummer's
Night Dream."
According to Farias, the group is always
searching for new locales: "We are looking for
new places ... possibly the Knoll, possibly the
new Earth Sciences building. There are so
many great places to have [outdoor] theater
here at Stanford."
Outside In was planning on staging this
summer's production of "The Tempest" on
one of the islands in the Inner Quad. However,
the university claims that it is illegal to use the
space. Instead of the "island," the group may
very well return to the Hoop.
To fully enjoy an Outside Inexperience, au
dience members should tote some lounge
chairs, blankets and even a picnic basket to the
show. The shows are free, although the group

always welcomes donations to sup
port its efforts. In addition, audience
members should prepare to observe
the occasional squirrel or other out
door theater intruders hamming it up
on stage. Members of the audience
should also prepare to suspend hear
ing the performance when a 747 roars
overhead.
By performing outdoors, the sound
proof walls, sound systems and barri
ers are stripped away. Incorporating
equal opportunity for casting, gender
no longer keeps actors away from ex
ploring new roles. The result? Simple,
straightforward, acoustic theater that
dares to turn the concepts of theater in
side out. ■

Outside In will start the 1994 summer
season with Shakespeare's "Comedy of
Errors." The show will premiere June 29
at 6 p.m. and will continue through July
2, as well as running from July (>-10. Lo
cation? To be announced. For more in
formation call 497-5469.

Besides a handful of New Guinea master
carvers, a litter or two of hopeful high
school seniors and a mob of interna
tional soccer enthusiasts, prepare to en- a
counter fairies, shipwrecked souls and even A
some Aussie convicts decorating the Stan-fl
ford landscape this summer. V
These characters are the creations of
Outside In, a 10-member summer reperto
ry group here on campus. Soon, the group
will be providing yet another season of free
outdoor theater to the Stanford community.
THEATER IN THE HOOP
The origins of the group can be traced back
to a two-quarter advanced acting workshop
offered two years ago. Winter Mead, a visiting
lecturer in the Drama Department, directed
the workshop. Under Reed's guidance, acting
talents were nurtured. And during those two
quarters, strong alliances were formed.
Upon completion of the workshop, the 12
students involved were eager to exercise their
skills collectively. They synergized their ef
forts to present the play "Cloud Nine." Un
able to find an indoor space to stage their
