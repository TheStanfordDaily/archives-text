story by Joey Roseriblum

Trey smiles at Mike, nods his head and
mouths "Stash" — a huge cheer rises in
the 13,000-person capacity audience at
Berkeley's Greek Theater as the flaming red
headed guitarist Trey Anastasio mutely strikes
the first notes of Phish's epic space odyssey.
Eight months and a new album later, I'm
talking with lon Fishman, the rhythmic force
behind Phish's music: "Music is like nutri
tion, it's a staple. Like rice." And it must be to
endure 200-plus shows a year and still enjoy
playing. After selling out Massachusetts'
16,000-seat Centrum on New Year's Eve and
making its debut appearance in Newsweek,
Phish is back on the road, playing its new ma
terial, and taking its old music to new and un
charted places.
Through 11 years of playing together, the
members of Phish have developed an intu
itive ability to communicate musical inten
tions to each other in their live shows: the
songs change direction, intensity and key as
per the whim of whichever player decides to
take the music in his own hands.
Maybe its bassist Mike Gordon, bobbing
his head of unbrushed curls, pulling out enve
lope-filtered chunks of funk. Maybe it's Page
McConnell on the keys, blending a Herbie
Hancock-melodic jazz sense with |ohn
McLaughlin's unrelenting push toward outer
space on his Hammond B3 electric organ.
Anastasio is in fine form, his chromatic runs
and arpeggios leading the band through funk,
soul, jazz and rock improvisational journeys.
"Stash" is particularly groovin' tonight and
the audience, entranced, sings the chorus:
"Was it for this my life I sought?", echoing:
"maybe so and maybe not (the solar garlic
starts to rot)." Five albums after they first
jammed together at a small liberal arts college
in Vermont, the members of Phish continue
to expand conventional notions of music.
Breeding the jams
While the '80s were the breeding ground
for such straight and narrow pop acts as
Whitney Houston, Paula Abdul, George
Michael and the like, the '90s may well be the
decade for a cultural (particularly musical)
change. A plethora of jam-oriented bands —
in the tradition of the Grateful Dead and the
Allman Brothers — that make their living by
touring instead of album sales and MTV ro
tation has sprung up, among the best known
of which are Blues Traveler, The Spin 1 )octors
and Widespread Panic: yet Phish is galaxies
ahead even of these already fantastic bands.
Until its most recent album, Phish's music
was a complete rejection or parody of pop
sensibility. From a cappella, barber-shop
type jams, to intense jazz explorations, to
bone-crunching guitar rock, to greasy funk,
Phish grooves and twists and turns their
music as if it were Play Doh.
"Reba pressa razor to a slide cross a needle
with a prune," Anastasio intones behind a de
scending progression of major chords at
Berkeley, as the audience members whirl and
dance and bob to a song they all know is
about to explode into a fantastic jam.
Evolving and changing year to year, its lat
est album is a dark ride through tailed rela
tionships and existential despair while the
tunes on the second release, "Lawn Boy" are
more composed of haphazard poetry and
more fantastical occurrences. (The second set
explodes with a disco jam of the theme music
from 2001, leading into an up-tempo version
of "Rift.") When I ask Fishman about the
change in lyrics tone and quality, and tell him


Courtesy ol Eleklra Records
that I simply don't understand some of the
songs, he confides in me that "Reba is a song
about a mad scientist who makes meat in a
bathtub." I should have guessed.
Of their older material, Fishman explains
that, "the other songs were more distant, fan
tasy fiction oriented, like reading 'The Hob
bit'." As Phish's fans are surely composed of
some of the same people who read and love
Tolkien, the fantastical lyrics appealed to
their sensibilities. In fact, Anastasio's senior
thesis project at Goddard College was a fan
tasy rock musical that takes places in the
mythical world of Gamehenge ("there have
been rumors floating for a while of an inter
active Gamehenge CD-ROM"), and these
songs often appear in their live sets. In fact, if
you were lucky enough to be in Sacramento
for the March 1993 Phish show, you would
have seen a live performance of nearly the en
tire rock musical complete with Anastasio's
narration.
A picture of Trey
Hut as Fishman says, "that shit just gets
old." Phish has moved on, and its lyrics have
become more personal, less fantastical. "1
know that Trey was sick of singing lyrics that
didn't have some specific meaning to him
like you know when you listen to 8.8. King
and he sings, 'I gave you seven kids and now
you want to give them back,' I mean the guy
actually had 14 kids — he's singing about
something in his life that really means some
thing. I think the best singing of lyrics comes
from when the person who's singing is at
tached to what they're saying in a real way. 1
know that for Trey that's a problem."

In this vein, the
new album is def
initely more soul

searching and more personally revealing.
"Like in 'Axilla I part II |,' Trey kept changing
the lyrics until they were about something
specific in his life," Fishman continues. "I
think that would he the main goal in the
change in lyrics was for people to be singing
about things in their life and that they were
specifically attached to, and therefore when
you sing them, your going to sing them with
more meaning, and they're going to ring out
more."
Enter Jon the Fisherman
"You know Primus? You know that song,
"Jon the Fisherman"? LesClaypool (Primus*
bass player and singer/songwriter) is really
into fishing. All that stuff about the stur
geons, on one hand it's totally funny stuff,
but on the other hand the gut really loves
fishing. He's singing about real stuff— he's
singing about things in his life; you can say
'what a weird guy,' or whatever you want to
say, but when you hear him sing these things,
the guy's into it, because it's real."
Yet not all the new material is straightfor
ward by any means. The songs still retain a
mystical Gertrude Stein-esque poetic quali
ty, and some of the lyrics baffle even I ish
man. The album's first single, "Down With
The Diesease," leaves the listener somewhat
stupefied. When I first heard it, I was con
vinced that maybe it was a mourning song
for Phish's growing popularity; I was totally
confused. Apparently Fishman was too.
"For me, personally, I always kind of won
der what the hell those lyrics are about." But
he has his own interpretation ot his friend
and bandmate's lyrics: "I think it has to do
with our own life, traveling around, and sort
of the relentlessness of it; the people that we
meet. Sometimes it's the greatest thing,
sometimes it's overwhelming. There a

lot of different emotional things

that occur as a result of traveling
around and performing. 1 didn't
write any of those lyrics in that

song, but there are certain

lines that have their
own meaning tor

me."

I Maybe
it's a trend:
Fish m a n

never likes
I'hish singles.
"When 'I A

tucking
hated that

song too. Now I re
ally like it. But the
thing about 'Chalk-

dust Torture' was that
I always really liked
the lyrics. The lyrics
are about being bored
in school, basically.
They're great lyrics. In
'Down With The
Diesease,' the only
meanings I've ever
construed from the
song have always been
negative for me." Not
only that, but it's Fish
man's least favorite
tune on the album. "I
imagined it as a steam
ing bluegrass tune, but
on the album it
sounds kind of lunky
to me," he says. No,
definitely no Flatt and
Scruggs jam here.
Radio daze
While the album
following "A Picture
of Nectar," "Rift," was
a fantastic, cohesive
story of a man losing a
woman and lament
ing about it (but with
a very sardonic tone to
the whole opus) there
were no radio-re
leasable singles. In
contrast, the new
album "Hoist" con-

centrates more on indi
vidual song crafting; there is no jamming
out of songs Phish has been playing for
years, but in return, there are songs that are
played on the radio.
"When we made 'Rift' [the record com
pany people] were saying, This is a great
album, but you're really tying our hands
here. What do you want us for? There are no
singles on this, there's nothing we can play
on the radio.' There was stuff you could play
on the radio, but the radio is so narrow
minded. [They said) 'we don't have a single,
we don't have a video, there's no way to push
this, it's very cerebral, it's 67 minutes long
— this is not your standard album.' We were
like, 'Too bad, this is the album we made.' "
Although not necessarily because ot
record company pressure (In spite ot l ish
man's admitting "It'd be nice to have a
record that the company liked"), I've been
hearing the new, radio-friendly Phish on
the Bay Area air waves. "For this album, no
doubt, there was a conscious element ot
having there be songs that could be played
on the radio. 'Sample in a Jar,' for example,
or 'Down With The Piesease,' could have
gone on forever, except, for the album, we
made the versions four or five minutes
long, where if we made them like fucking
'Freebird' they'd never play them on the
radio."
Also, most of the new tunes were written
right before the recording dates. "We wrote
everything in two weeks, and songs only got
developed as far as they were, not like if you
play the song on the road for a year." 1 lowev
er, this process, different from, say, the jams
on "Rift," allows the band to work with the
songs live. "This gives us the chance to go out
on the road and stretch them out like they
should be stretched out." So for fans who
were sad about the lack of extended jams on

"Hoist," — never fear, these songs will defi
nitely be kicking when played live.
The album is already a classic and features
such amazing musical guests as Bela Fleck
and the Tower of Power horns. "We wanted
the album to be more of an album that peo
ple would listen to, that people would want
to listen to, that people would want to clean
their house and listen to."
Miles to go
Phish is on tour through the summer and
is already looking towards their next two al
bums. The band is recording this whole tour
in order to pick and choose cuts for a live
album (the next release) and Fishman myste
riously relates that plans are in the works for
the following release. As Phish allows record
ing at all of their shows, and 'here are hun
dreds of high quality bootlegs in circulation,
fans who want to get their ears on the live
sound are easily accommodated.
The most important thing for the mem
bers of Phish is they keep on growing. They
are constantly improving in musicianship,
and their material changes from tour to tour,
maintaining their own and their listeners' in
terest through the years.
Says Fishman, appropriately in conclu
sion as he gets off the phone to shower before
tonight's show: "The main agenda of this
band is to keep doing things that are different
from what we've done before. ■

Cheek out the Phish.net newsgroup heated at
rec.tnusie.phish — 40,000 people conversing
about their favorite Phish happenings, songs,
experiences, etc.... Also, Phish brings the cos
mic energy of the Milky Way to the Warfield

Daze (LSD) this Saturday and Sunday. Tickets
for Laguna Seca are on sale at all Pass loca

bass player and singer/songwriter) is really
into fishing. All that stuff about the stur
geons, on one hand it's totally funny stuff,
but on the other hand the gut really loves
fishing. He's singing about real stuff— he's
singing about things in his life; you can say
'what a weird guy,' or whatever you want to
say, but when you hear him sing these things,
the guy's into it, because it's real."
Yet not all the new material is straightfor
ward by any means. The songs still retain a
mystical Gertrude Stein-esque poetic quali

man. The album's first single, "Down With
The Diesease," leaves the listener somewhat
stupefied. When I first heard it, I was con
vinced that maybe it was a mourning song
for Phish's growing popularity; I was totally
confused. Apparently Fishman was too.
"For me, personally, I always kind of won
der what the hell those lyrics are about." But
he has his own interpretation ot his friend
and bandmate's lyrics: "I think it has to do
with our own life, traveling around, and sort
of the relentlessness of it; the people that we
meet. Sometimes it's the greatest thing,
sometimes it's overwhelming. There a

lot of different emotional things

They're great lyrics. In
'Down With The

imagined it as a steam

on the album it

to me," he says. No,
definitely no Flatt and
Scruggs jam here.
Radio daze
While the album
following "A Picture
of Nectar," "Rift," was
a fantastic, cohesive
story of a man losing a
woman and lament
ing about it (but with
a very sardonic tone to
the whole opus) there
were no radio-re
leasable singles. In
contrast, the new
album "Hoist" con-

centrates more on indi
vidual song crafting; there is no jamming
out of songs Phish has been playing for
years, but in return, there are songs that are
played on the radio.
"When we made 'Rift' [the record com
pany people] were saying, This is a great
album, but you're really tying our hands
here. What do you want us for? There are no
singles on this, there's nothing we can play
on the radio.' There was stuff you could play
on the radio, but the radio is so narrow
minded. [They said) 'we don't have a single,
we don't have a video, there's no way to push
this, it's very cerebral, it's 67 minutes long
— this is not your standard album.' We were
like, 'Too bad, this is the album we made.' "
Although not necessarily because ot
record company pressure (In spite ot l ish
man's admitting "It'd be nice to have a
record that the company liked"), I've been
hearing the new, radio-friendly Phish on
the Bay Area air waves. "For this album, no
doubt, there was a conscious element ot
having there be songs that could be played
on the radio. 'Sample in a Jar,' for example,
or 'Down With The Piesease,' could have
gone on forever, except, for the album, we
made the versions four or five minutes
long, where if we made them like fucking
'Freebird' they'd never play them on the
radio."
Also, most of the new tunes were written
right before the recording dates. "We wrote
everything in two weeks, and songs only got
developed as far as they were, not like if you
play the song on the road for a year." 1 lowev
er, this process, different from, say, the jams
on "Rift," allows the band to work with the
songs live. "This gives us the chance to go out
on the road and stretch them out like they
should be stretched out." So for fans who
were sad about the lack of extended jams on

"Hoist," — never fear, these songs will defi
nitely be kicking when played live.
The album is already a classic and features
such amazing musical guests as Bela Fleck
and the Tower of Power horns. "We wanted
the album to be more of an album that peo
ple would listen to, that people would want
to listen to, that people would want to clean
their house and listen to."
Miles to go
Phish is on tour through the summer and
is already looking towards their next two al
bums. The band is recording this whole tour
in order to pick and choose cuts for a live
album (the next release) and Fishman myste
riously relates that plans are in the works for
the following release. As Phish allows record
ing at all of their shows, and 'here are hun
dreds of high quality bootlegs in circulation,
fans who want to get their ears on the live
sound are easily accommodated.
The most important thing for the mem
bers of Phish is they keep on growing. They
are constantly improving in musicianship,
and their material changes from tour to tour,
maintaining their own and their listeners' in
terest through the years.
Says Fishman, appropriately in conclu
sion as he gets off the phone to shower before
tonight's show: "The main agenda of this
band is to keep doing things that are different
from what we've done before. ■

Jason Colton — Special to The Daily
\

story by Joey Roseriblum

Trey smiles at Mike, nods his head and
mouths "Stash" — a huge cheer rises in
the 13,000-person capacity audience at
Berkeley's Greek Theater as the flaming red
headed guitarist Trey Anastasio mutely strikes
the first notes of Phish's epic space odyssey.
Eight months and a new album later, I'm
talking with lon Fishman, the rhythmic force
behind Phish's music: "Music is like nutri
tion, it's a staple. Like rice." And it must be to
endure 200-plus shows a year and still enjoy
playing. After selling out Massachusetts'
16,000-seat Centrum on New Year's Eve and
making its debut appearance in Newsweek,
Phish is back on the road, playing its new ma
terial, and taking its old music to new and un
charted places.
Through 11 years of playing together, the
members of Phish have developed an intu
itive ability to communicate musical inten
tions to each other in their live shows: the
songs change direction, intensity and key as
per the whim of whichever player decides to
take the music in his own hands.
Maybe its bassist Mike Gordon, bobbing
his head of unbrushed curls, pulling out enve
lope-filtered chunks of funk. Maybe it's Page
McConnell on the keys, blending a Herbie
Hancock-melodic jazz sense with |ohn
McLaughlin's unrelenting push toward outer
space on his Hammond B3 electric organ.
Anastasio is in fine form, his chromatic runs
and arpeggios leading the band through funk,
soul, jazz and rock improvisational journeys.
"Stash" is particularly groovin' tonight and
the audience, entranced, sings the chorus:
"Was it for this my life I sought?", echoing:
"maybe so and maybe not (the solar garlic
starts to rot)." Five albums after they first
jammed together at a small liberal arts college
in Vermont, the members of Phish continue
to expand conventional notions of music.
Breeding the jams
While the '80s were the breeding ground
for such straight and narrow pop acts as
Whitney Houston, Paula Abdul, George
Michael and the like, the '90s may well be the
decade for a cultural (particularly musical)
change. A plethora of jam-oriented bands —
in the tradition of the Grateful Dead and the
Allman Brothers — that make their living by
touring instead of album sales and MTV ro
tation has sprung up, among the best known
of which are Blues Traveler, The Spin 1 )octors
and Widespread Panic: yet Phish is galaxies
ahead even of these already fantastic bands.
Until its most recent album, Phish's music
was a complete rejection or parody of pop
sensibility. From a cappella, barber-shop
type jams, to intense jazz explorations, to
bone-crunching guitar rock, to greasy funk,
Phish grooves and twists and turns their
music as if it were Play Doh.
"Reba pressa razor to a slide cross a needle
with a prune," Anastasio intones behind a de
scending progression of major chords at
Berkeley, as the audience members whirl and
dance and bob to a song they all know is
about to explode into a fantastic jam.
Evolving and changing year to year, its lat
est album is a dark ride through tailed rela
tionships and existential despair while the
tunes on the second release, "Lawn Boy" are
more composed of haphazard poetry and
more fantastical occurrences. (The second set
explodes with a disco jam of the theme music
from 2001, leading into an up-tempo version
of "Rift.") When I ask Fishman about the
change in lyrics tone and quality, and tell him


Courtesy ol Eleklra Records
that I simply don't understand some of the
songs, he confides in me that "Reba is a song
about a mad scientist who makes meat in a
bathtub." I should have guessed.
Of their older material, Fishman explains
that, "the other songs were more distant, fan
tasy fiction oriented, like reading 'The Hob
bit'." As Phish's fans are surely composed of
some of the same people who read and love
Tolkien, the fantastical lyrics appealed to
their sensibilities. In fact, Anastasio's senior
thesis project at Goddard College was a fan
tasy rock musical that takes places in the
mythical world of Gamehenge ("there have
been rumors floating for a while of an inter
active Gamehenge CD-ROM"), and these
songs often appear in their live sets. In fact, if
you were lucky enough to be in Sacramento
for the March 1993 Phish show, you would
have seen a live performance of nearly the en
tire rock musical complete with Anastasio's
narration.
A picture of Trey
Hut as Fishman says, "that shit just gets
old." Phish has moved on, and its lyrics have
become more personal, less fantastical. "1
know that Trey was sick of singing lyrics that
didn't have some specific meaning to him
like you know when you listen to 8.8. King
and he sings, 'I gave you seven kids and now
you want to give them back,' I mean the guy
actually had 14 kids — he's singing about
something in his life that really means some
thing. I think the best singing of lyrics comes
from when the person who's singing is at
tached to what they're saying in a real way. 1
know that for Trey that's a problem."

In this vein, the
new album is def
initely more soul

searching and more personally revealing.
"Like in 'Axilla I part II |,' Trey kept changing
the lyrics until they were about something
specific in his life," Fishman continues. "I
think that would he the main goal in the
change in lyrics was for people to be singing
about things in their life and that they were
specifically attached to, and therefore when
you sing them, your going to sing them with
more meaning, and they're going to ring out
more."
Enter Jon the Fisherman
"You know Primus? You know that song,
"Jon the Fisherman"? LesClaypool (Primus*
bass player and singer/songwriter) is really
into fishing. All that stuff about the stur
geons, on one hand it's totally funny stuff,
but on the other hand the gut really loves
fishing. He's singing about real stuff— he's
singing about things in his life; you can say
'what a weird guy,' or whatever you want to
say, but when you hear him sing these things,
the guy's into it, because it's real."

story by Joey Roseriblum

Trey smiles at Mike, nods his head and
mouths "Stash" — a huge cheer rises in
the 13,000-person capacity audience at
Berkeley's Greek Theater as the flaming red
headed guitarist Trey Anastasio mutely strikes
the first notes of Phish's epic space odyssey.
Eight months and a new album later, I'm
talking with lon Fishman, the rhythmic force
behind Phish's music: "Music is like nutri
tion, it's a staple. Like rice." And it must be to
endure 200-plus shows a year and still enjoy
playing. After selling out Massachusetts'
16,000-seat Centrum on New Year's Eve and
making its debut appearance in Newsweek,
Phish is back on the road, playing its new ma
terial, and taking its old music to new and un
charted places.
Through 11 years of playing together, the
members of Phish have developed an intu
itive ability to communicate musical inten
tions to each other in their live shows: the
songs change direction, intensity and key as
per the whim of whichever player decides to
take the music in his own hands.
Maybe its bassist Mike Gordon, bobbing
his head of unbrushed curls, pulling out enve
lope-filtered chunks of funk. Maybe it's Page
McConnell on the keys, blending a Herbie
Hancock-melodic jazz sense with |ohn
McLaughlin's unrelenting push toward outer
space on his Hammond B3 electric organ.
Anastasio is in fine form, his chromatic runs
and arpeggios leading the band through funk,
soul, jazz and rock improvisational journeys.
"Stash" is particularly groovin' tonight and
the audience, entranced, sings the chorus:
"Was it for this my life I sought?", echoing:
"maybe so and maybe not (the solar garlic
starts to rot)." Five albums after they first
jammed together at a small liberal arts college
in Vermont, the members of Phish continue
to expand conventional notions of music.
Breeding the jams
While the '80s were the breeding ground
for such straight and narrow pop acts as
Whitney Houston, Paula Abdul, George
Michael and the like, the '90s may well be the
decade for a cultural (particularly musical)
change. A plethora of jam-oriented bands —
in the tradition of the Grateful Dead and the
Allman Brothers — that make their living by
touring instead of album sales and MTV ro
tation has sprung up, among the best known
of which are Blues Traveler, The Spin 1 )octors
and Widespread Panic: yet Phish is galaxies
ahead even of these already fantastic bands.
Until its most recent album, Phish's music
was a complete rejection or parody of pop
sensibility. From a cappella, barber-shop
type jams, to intense jazz explorations, to
bone-crunching guitar rock, to greasy funk,
Phish grooves and twists and turns their
music as if it were Play Doh.
"Reba pressa razor to a slide cross a needle
with a prune," Anastasio intones behind a de
scending progression of major chords at
Berkeley, as the audience members whirl and
dance and bob to a song they all know is
about to explode into a fantastic jam.
Evolving and changing year to year, its lat
est album is a dark ride through tailed rela
tionships and existential despair while the
tunes on the second release, "Lawn Boy" are
more composed of haphazard poetry and
more fantastical occurrences. (The second set
explodes with a disco jam of the theme music
from 2001, leading into an up-tempo version
of "Rift.") When I ask Fishman about the
change in lyrics tone and quality, and tell him


Courtesy ol Eleklra Records
that I simply don't understand some of the
songs, he confides in me that "Reba is a song
about a mad scientist who makes meat in a
bathtub." I should have guessed.
Of their older material, Fishman explains
that, "the other songs were more distant, fan
tasy fiction oriented, like reading 'The Hob
bit'." As Phish's fans are surely composed of
some of the same people who read and love
Tolkien, the fantastical lyrics appealed to
their sensibilities. In fact, Anastasio's senior
thesis project at Goddard College was a fan
tasy rock musical that takes places in the
mythical world of Gamehenge ("there have
been rumors floating for a while of an inter
active Gamehenge CD-ROM"), and these
songs often appear in their live sets. In fact, if
you were lucky enough to be in Sacramento
for the March 1993 Phish show, you would
have seen a live performance of nearly the en
tire rock musical complete with Anastasio's
narration.
A picture of Trey
Hut as Fishman says, "that shit just gets
old." Phish has moved on, and its lyrics have
become more personal, less fantastical. "1
know that Trey was sick of singing lyrics that
didn't have some specific meaning to him
like you know when you listen to 8.8. King
and he sings, 'I gave you seven kids and now
you want to give them back,' I mean the guy
actually had 14 kids — he's singing about
something in his life that really means some
thing. I think the best singing of lyrics comes
from when the person who's singing is at
tached to what they're saying in a real way. 1
know that for Trey that's a problem."

In this vein, the
new album is def
initely more soul

searching and more personally revealing.
"Like in 'Axilla I part II |,' Trey kept changing
the lyrics until they were about something
specific in his life," Fishman continues. "I
think that would he the main goal in the
change in lyrics was for people to be singing
about things in their life and that they were
specifically attached to, and therefore when
you sing them, your going to sing them with
more meaning, and they're going to ring out
more."
Enter Jon the Fisherman
"You know Primus? You know that song,
"Jon the Fisherman"? LesClaypool (Primus*
bass player and singer/songwriter) is really
into fishing. All that stuff about the stur
geons, on one hand it's totally funny stuff,
but on the other hand the gut really loves
fishing. He's singing about real stuff— he's
singing about things in his life; you can say
'what a weird guy,' or whatever you want to
say, but when you hear him sing these things,
the guy's into it, because it's real."
Yet not all the new material is straightfor
ward by any means. The songs still retain a
mystical Gertrude Stein-esque poetic quali
ty, and some of the lyrics baffle even I ish
man. The album's first single, "Down With
The Diesease," leaves the listener somewhat
stupefied. When I first heard it, I was con
vinced that maybe it was a mourning song
for Phish's growing popularity; I was totally
confused. Apparently Fishman was too.
"For me, personally, I always kind of won
der what the hell those lyrics are about." But
he has his own interpretation ot his friend
and bandmate's lyrics: "I think it has to do
with our own life, traveling around, and sort
of the relentlessness of it; the people that we
meet. Sometimes it's the greatest thing,
sometimes it's overwhelming. There a

lot of different emotional things

that occur as a result of traveling
around and performing. 1 didn't
write any of those lyrics in that

song, but there are certain

lines that have their
own meaning tor

me."

I Maybe
it's a trend:
Fish m a n

never likes
I'hish singles.
"When 'I A

Nectar

came out

t u re

tucking
hated that

song too. Now I re
ally like it. But the
thing about 'Chalk-

dust Torture' was that
I always really liked
the lyrics. The lyrics
are about being bored
in school, basically.
They're great lyrics. In
'Down With The
Diesease,' the only
meanings I've ever
construed from the
song have always been
negative for me." Not
only that, but it's Fish
man's least favorite
tune on the album. "I
imagined it as a steam
ing bluegrass tune, but
on the album it
sounds kind of lunky
to me," he says. No,
definitely no Flatt and
Scruggs jam here.
Radio daze
While the album
following "A Picture
of Nectar," "Rift," was
a fantastic, cohesive
story of a man losing a
woman and lament
ing about it (but with
a very sardonic tone to
the whole opus) there
were no radio-re
leasable singles. In
contrast, the new
album "Hoist" con-

centrates more on indi
vidual song crafting; there is no jamming
out of songs Phish has been playing for
years, but in return, there are songs that are
played on the radio.
"When we made 'Rift' [the record com
pany people] were saying, This is a great
album, but you're really tying our hands
here. What do you want us for? There are no
singles on this, there's nothing we can play
on the radio.' There was stuff you could play
on the radio, but the radio is so narrow
minded. [They said) 'we don't have a single,
we don't have a video, there's no way to push
this, it's very cerebral, it's 67 minutes long
— this is not your standard album.' We were
like, 'Too bad, this is the album we made.' "
Although not necessarily because ot
record company pressure (In spite ot l ish
man's admitting "It'd be nice to have a
record that the company liked"), I've been
hearing the new, radio-friendly Phish on
the Bay Area air waves. "For this album, no
doubt, there was a conscious element ot
having there be songs that could be played
on the radio. 'Sample in a Jar,' for example,
or 'Down With The Piesease,' could have
gone on forever, except, for the album, we
made the versions four or five minutes
long, where if we made them like fucking
'Freebird' they'd never play them on the
radio."
Also, most of the new tunes were written
right before the recording dates. "We wrote
everything in two weeks, and songs only got
developed as far as they were, not like if you
play the song on the road for a year." 1 lowev
er, this process, different from, say, the jams
on "Rift," allows the band to work with the
songs live. "This gives us the chance to go out
on the road and stretch them out like they
should be stretched out." So for fans who
were sad about the lack of extended jams on

"Hoist," — never fear, these songs will defi
nitely be kicking when played live.
The album is already a classic and features
such amazing musical guests as Bela Fleck
and the Tower of Power horns. "We wanted
the album to be more of an album that peo
ple would listen to, that people would want
to listen to, that people would want to clean
their house and listen to."
Miles to go
Phish is on tour through the summer and
is already looking towards their next two al
bums. The band is recording this whole tour
in order to pick and choose cuts for a live
album (the next release) and Fishman myste
riously relates that plans are in the works for
the following release. As Phish allows record
ing at all of their shows, and 'here are hun
dreds of high quality bootlegs in circulation,
fans who want to get their ears on the live
sound are easily accommodated.
The most important thing for the mem
bers of Phish is they keep on growing. They
are constantly improving in musicianship,
and their material changes from tour to tour,
maintaining their own and their listeners' in
terest through the years.
Says Fishman, appropriately in conclu
sion as he gets off the phone to shower before
tonight's show: "The main agenda of this
band is to keep doing things that are different
from what we've done before. ■
