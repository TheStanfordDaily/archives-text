Trey smiles at Mike, nods his head and
mouths "Stash" — a huge cheer rises in
the 13,000-person capacity audience at
Berkeley's Greek Theater as the flaming red
headed guitarist Trey Anastasio mutely strikes
the first notes of Phish's epic space odyssey.
Eight months and a new album later, I'm
talking with lon Fishman, the rhythmic force
behind Phish's music: "Music is like nutri
tion, it's a staple. Like rice." And it must be to
endure 200-plus shows a year and still enjoy
playing. After selling out Massachusetts'
16,000-seat Centrum on New Year's Eve and
making its debut appearance in Newsweek,
Phish is back on the road, playing its new ma
terial, and taking its old music to new and un
charted places.
Through 11 years of playing together, the
members of Phish have developed an intu
itive ability to communicate musical inten
tions to each other in their live shows: the
songs change direction, intensity and key as
per the whim of whichever player decides to
take the music in his own hands.
Maybe its bassist Mike Gordon, bobbing
his head of unbrushed curls, pulling out enve
lope-filtered chunks of funk. Maybe it's Page
McConnell on the keys, blending a Herbie
Hancock-melodic jazz sense with |ohn
McLaughlin's unrelenting push toward outer
space on his Hammond B3 electric organ.
Anastasio is in fine form, his chromatic runs
and arpeggios leading the band through funk,
soul, jazz and rock improvisational journeys.
"Stash" is particularly groovin' tonight and
the audience, entranced, sings the chorus:
"Was it for this my life I sought?", echoing:
"maybe so and maybe not (the solar garlic
starts to rot)." Five albums after they first
jammed together at a small liberal arts college
in Vermont, the members of Phish continue
to expand conventional notions of music.
Breeding the jams
While the '80s were the breeding ground
for such straight and narrow pop acts as
Whitney Houston, Paula Abdul, George
Michael and the like, the '90s may well be the
decade for a cultural (particularly musical)
change. A plethora of jam-oriented bands —
in the tradition of the Grateful Dead and the
Allman Brothers — that make their living by
touring instead of album sales and MTV ro
tation has sprung up, among the best known
of which are Blues Traveler, The Spin 1 )octors
and Widespread Panic: yet Phish is galaxies
ahead even of these already fantastic bands.
Until its most recent album, Phish's music
was a complete rejection or parody of pop
sensibility. From a cappella, barber-shop
type jams, to intense jazz explorations, to
bone-crunching guitar rock, to greasy funk,
Phish grooves and twists and turns their
music as if it were Play Doh.
"Reba pressa razor to a slide cross a needle
with a prune," Anastasio intones behind a de
scending progression of major chords at
Berkeley, as the audience members whirl and
dance and bob to a song they all know is
about to explode into a fantastic jam.
Evolving and changing year to year, its lat
est album is a dark ride through tailed rela
tionships and existential despair while the
tunes on the second release, "Lawn Boy" are
more composed of haphazard poetry and
more fantastical occurrences. (The second set
explodes with a disco jam of the theme music
from 2001, leading into an up-tempo version
of "Rift.") When I ask Fishman about the
change in lyrics tone and quality, and tell him
