## 'Thirty Two Short Films' long on details 
### 
Recently, director Francois Girard ob
served that "after 100 years of filmmak
ing, form and rules are ready to be bro
ken." His newest work, "Thirty Two
Short Films About Glenn Gould," should
meet the challenge. Viewers will find
these eccentric collages mesmerizingly
appropriate to their subject.
Although the film borrows its 32
modes from the mathematical symmetry
of Bach's "Goldberg Variations," this sort
of multifaceted portrait seems just right
for writer/director Girard, a veteran of
music videos and advertising.
His last film, an adaptation of Gilles
Maheu's "Le Dortoir," was a heady, frag
mented mix of pantomime, poetry and
music; it seems right that he should
adapt his collage work to the biography
of Gould. His taste for MTV-pacing and
leaps in chronology and locales should
make the life of this composer seem fresh
even to knowing fans.
The subjects of the films are diverse
and subtle. In a short entitled "45 Sec
onds and a Chair," Gould as a young man
stares unflinchingly at the camera while
Bach's "Two Part Invention No. J3" un
ravels on the soundtrack; in another ti
tled "Gould Meets Gould," the per
former literally interviews himself as a
middle-aged man; in "Passion According
to Gould," CBS recording engineers
argue about the consistency of their cof
fee while Gould dances in the piano
booth; in "Pills" hundreds of Gould's fa
vorite tranquilizers drift across the
screen; "Voyager" stops the show with
footage of the spacecraft — and Gould's
recordings onboard — traveling into
space.

Girard's technique sometimes turns
magic out of details. In a short entitled
"Truck Stop," Gould tunes his car-radio
to Petula Clark's "Downtown" and
hums along merrily; when he arrives at a
diner he orders breakfast with extra
ketchup and then sits contemplating the
voices around him. Girard packs a sur
prising degree of characterization into
this short glimpse of the character. Not
only does he allude to Gould's inconsis
tent taste (the performer was fond of
Barbra Streisand and fast food) but he
manipulates the sound recording so that
we hear with selective, talented ears, fo
cusing from one individual to another.
These purely cinematic techniques af
ford us a unique vantage of Gould's
mind.
At the center of this film is the mag
netic performance of Canadian actor
Colm Feore, who plays Gould from the
ages of 20 to 50. The task of resembling a
musical prodigy seems easy for Feore,
who projects a ready intelligence and a
weirdly unperturbed balance. Girard
never features Feore at the piano — some
purists appreciate this — but focuses
upon Feore's pantomimed inspiration:
Feore clutching his head in intense con
centration, Feore staring, Alex-the-
Droog-style, into the camera, Feore
looking like a senile old man. It's a gim
micky, synthetic performance, but it's
endearingly bold; it is revisionist and just
as inscrutable as its subject.
The ingenuity of "Thirty Two Films
About Glenn Gould" is its juxtaposition
of literal documentary material with
what Girard terms "biofiction," an in
vented, embellished account. Actual ac

quaintances of Gould address the cam
era and relate their trials; actual Gould
recording experiments, like the Dadaist,
Beatles-esque "The Idea of North," score
the impersonation of the recordings.
Then all semblance of biography disap
pears and we encounter Gould in
strangely intimate, ordinary surround
ings.
The actors pose in contrived, defiant
ly synthetic accounts of how, for exam
ple, Gould might have performed alone.
This juxtaposition of documentary with
artificial, uniquely interpretative ac
count, is an expert portrait by screen
writers Francois Girard and Don
McKellar (McKellar wrote and per
formed last year's excellent "Highway
61").
Ultimately, a film about Gould
should escape our grasp. "Thirty Two
Films About Glenn Gould" succeeds in
these terms. The actor, Feore, and direc
tor, Girard, never sever their tie with the
audience; they sustain an imperson
ation of a synthetic account; they
promise us something which is formally
artificial, parceled in tiny subtitled
mini-movies, and deliberately in
scrutable. This treatment suits its eccen
tric subject. Feore, indistinguishable
from his character, barely mumbles that
"Glenn Gould, musical genius, died
today at the age of 50. Thank you for
tuning in."
In the end Glenn Gould leaves us and
crosses the Canada tundra, departing
contact, content to elude our under
standing. His aria from the "Goldberg
Variations" wafts back across the cold.
