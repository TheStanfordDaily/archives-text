# Closing Numbers
## screens 
### 
To touch a chord at the darkest of myster
ies, the human heart, is what cinema aspires
to, but rarely realizes — at least not with the
searing honesty evident in this British entry
at the 18th San Francisco Lesbian and Gay
Film Festival.
On the surface, "Closing Numbers,"
under the helm of unheralded TV director
Stephen Whittaker, treads precariously on
over-familiar grounds: wife finds out about
closeted husband, a gay friend dies of AIDS,
suburbia reels in venomous horror as HIV
walks into the local supermarket. Yet its bold
reliance on unspectacular but poignant nu-

ances brought out
by the epidemic
pays handsome div
idends.
A sequence in
point has the father
Keith (Tim Wood
ward) calmly re
count to his 18-
year-old son how
he had fallen in love
with an older boy in
high school. The
son, who had react-

Ed violently to the revelation only two scenes
back, now studies his fathers face intently,
and begins to hear the words: "In the end, it
doesn't matter who you love; what's impor
tant is the capacity to."
In the hands of screenwriter David Cook,
each spoken sentence is built upon quiet
pathos and grounded in believability. The
plot is seamless, yet one might at first ques
tion the plausibility of Steve (Patrick Pear
son) agreeing to meet his lover's wife, Anna
(a sublime performance by Jane Asher). It
soon becomes clear though: Steve has no
other choice once he understands he may be
able to prevent another red-ribboned entry
on the obituary page.
When a film's most dramatic moment is
caused by a thoughtless act of insensitivity on
the part of its AIDS-suffering character, one
cannot but marvel at the courage of Cook
and Whittaker to recognize the humanness
of their characters.
While the "Angels in America" soars into
celestial realms of post-modern mythology,
"Closing Numbers" portrays simple lives as
complex transformations. And it shows why
you do not need $25 million to do that: if
"Philadelphia" was a safe appetizer for better
things, "Closing Numbers" might be what
we have been waiting for.
