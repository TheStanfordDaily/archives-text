# Maverick
## 
### 
Just what the world needed: another
shoot-'em-up western. I can just picture the
Hollywood executives sitting around the im
ported marble table. "Only this one will be
funny," says one. "Yes, and with a social con
science," chimes in another.
Thus "Maverick" was probably born, a
feeble comedy set in the old West. Mel Gib
son stars as the movie's cocky gambler name
sake, trying to make it cross country to the
biggest poker game of his life. There are only
three obstacles in his way: he's $2,000 short,
Jodie Foster's trying to bamboozle him, and
someone's trying to kill him.
Amazingly, this does nothing to dampen
his spirits. He talks, shoots and schmoozes
his way out of more sticky situations than a
bumblebee.
So what's wrong with this movie? It's fair
ly entertaining except for one small flaw, a
fatal one in a comedy — it's just not funny.
Most of the jokes fall flatter than Gibson's
klutzy character. Foster, James Garner and
Gibson are set up as a three stooges comedy
team a la Jackie Gleason and friends, but are
unsuccessful. A particularly trying example is
the extended joke that no one can remember
Brett Maverick's name (or was it Brad?). Ha.

Another involves the three getting into a loud
argument while attempting to ambush
thieves. Hee-haw.
Some of the only funny situations arise
when Graham Greene enters the movie.
Maverick's use of him to scare Foster's and
Garner's characters is hilarious, but even here
the jokes border on the edge of bad taste.
The movie is entertaining. The action
scenes are exciting and the plot has enough
twists to keep the viewer guessing.
Cameos by Clint Black and Danny Glover
provide the most humorous scenes, which
should clue the potential viewer into the fact
that "Maverick" is a fluff flick. It's lots of good
actors parading around a two-hour situation
comedy that contains only mild, if entertain
ing, chuckles.
