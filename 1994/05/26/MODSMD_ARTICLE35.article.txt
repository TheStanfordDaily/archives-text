# Rite of passage
## Indigo Girls move to big sound with mixed results 
### 
The Indigo Girls are moving on to new
ground with their latest album, "Swamp
Ophelia." For this album, the Amy Ray and
Fmily Saliers use a much larger band than
they've used on their earlier releases — nearly
all of the songs on "Swamp Ophelia" have at
least 10 instruments on them, and some have
14 or 15, giving the album a rich, textured feel.
On the albums first track, "Fugitive," we
hear everything from a flugel horn to a vibra
chime to an electric guitar (gasp) that Amy
Ray cranks up halfway through the song. On
"touch me fall," the closest thing this album
has to a title track, the Girls bring together
two electric guitars, a horn section and a
string quartet.
"Swamp Ophelia" is a musically compli
cated album. It has several bright spots, like
Saliers' acoustic throwback "Fare Thee Well"
and the quirky song "touch me fall."
Unfortunately, on the whole, "Swamp
Ophelia" is not a very good album, not by In
digo Girls standards at least. Although the
Girls have moved on to a different format
than their earlier albums and have produced
a solid piece of work, Ray and Saliers show a
hesitance they haven't shown before. They're
not quite as energetic.
"Fugitive," for example, is a quality song,
but it doesn't hook you like "Closer to Fine"
(from 1989's "Indigo Girls"). "This Train Re
visited" is a catchy anthem but doesn't rock
nearly as hard as "Chickenman" (1992's
"Rites of Passage"). And nowhere is there the
rural, haunted sound of "Jonas and Ezekiel,"
also off "Rites." (Ah. Who else but the Indigo
Girls can make six lanes of Vermont blacktop
seem ethereal?) "Swamp Ophelia" is definite
ly moving, but it isn't entirely sure where it's
moving to.
As a whole, the album is a little mired.
Which brings us oh so subtly to the title and

from there to the album cover. Usually covers
are too distanced from the actual music, too
influenced by extraneous factors.
But "Swamp Ophelia" practically demands
that you look at the cover. It shows a skewed,
choppy pseudo-photo of Ray and Saliers
lounging on a stage (we see stage lights and a
drawn-back stage curtain) that is also a
swamp (mushrooms grow on the wood
around Ray, and ducks swim through murky
water at Saliers' feet). The Girls themselves are
dressed up in costumes, posing (Saliers actu
ally smiles, although it's a Mona-Lisa smile),
acutely self-conscious and obviously on stage.
Oh the imagery! Take a moment and make
all the numerous connections yourself. In
case you need help, think: Ophelia, swamp,
stage, musician, female musician, persona,
self, recording industry....
The cover of "Swamp Ophelia" appears to
signal the Indigo Girls' defiance of the threat
ening musical/recording industry swamp.
But the funny thing is, the music on the
album itself is a bit over self-conscious, a bit
restrained — a bit swamped.
The striking exception to this is the afore
mentioned "touch me fall," a scorching six
minute-plus hate song — complete with
Chris Isaak-like electric guitar and a minute
long near-Sonic Youth coda. Yes, I mean
Sonic Youth — which draws its strength from
the fact that the Indigo Girls arc acutely con
scious of the swamp they are falling into.
They sing slowly, mournfully, "Touch me I'm
so beautiful / rub your hands across my head
/ just like this ... swamp Ophelia / I'm torn
down / let your waters let me drown."
And then, in classic Indigo Girls style, they
flip their own misery around and make it a
reason to rejoice. They end the song by
singing, "If I stumble I will stumble / if I fall I
will fall / I'm trying to hold it like rain in a

river / everything is getting bigger
better / this won't last forever / touch me
fall." Now that's the Indigo Girls at their best,
whether they're singing with a 14-piece band
or with two acoustic guitars.
So if you're an Indigo Girls fan and you've

already got their other albums, buy this one,
you won't be disappointed. But if you don't
have any of their stuff and you're thinking of
getting some, try one of their earlier releases
like "Indigo Girls" or "Rites of Passage."

Why change when things are going good? The Indigo Girls feature a new, bigger sound
on their latest album, "Swamp Ophelia," that doesn't quite match up to their best work.

better / this won't last forever / touch me
fall." Now that's the Indigo Girls at their best,
whether they're singing with a 14-piece band
or with two acoustic guitars.
So if you're an Indigo Girls fan and you've

already got their other albums, buy this one,
you won't be disappointed. But if you don't
have any of their stuff and you're thinking of
getting some, try one of their earlier releases
like "Indigo Girls" or "Rites of Passage."

Why change when things are going good? The Indigo Girls feature a new, bigger sound
on their latest album, "Swamp Ophelia," that doesn't quite match up to their best work.
