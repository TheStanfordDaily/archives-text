# "I say, I say, I say" Erasure
## spins 
### 
I have traveled across the sky to the king
dom at the end of the rainbow. I have rolled
in meadows of soft candy and feasted upon
the sweetest of delights. And now I'm back.
But why a frown on my face? Because I still
can't get this bubble gum off my skin.
Reminiscent of Anything Box and Gin
dyflip, Erasure, with its new album, "I Say, 1
Say, I Say," is going for that 100 percent pure
electronic pop image. Those who raise an eye
brow and reply, "Erasure is totally electronic,"
should note that I said "image." Not only does

Erasure sound like it
came straight out of a
Macintosh, but its
members now also
act cute. They write
in simple, marsh
mallowy verses.
The album's first
song, "Take Me Back,"
is Absolut Erasure: a
gentle, swaying key-

board solo which opens into that unmistakable
synth bass and catchy melody. The song's title
announces the album's theme, as it tries to carry
you to its pastel, saccharine Utopia.
It tries. Really hard. But the world Erasure
paints is still a little transparent because of its
lack of melancholy. It has more than enough
happiness, but no sober moments that make
the joy all the more convincing.
Even so, there are plenty of gems in Era
sure's wonderland. In "So the Story Goes,"
Andy Bell's dramatic crooning and wavering
vibratos reminds us of Michael Crawford's
Phantom, a silhouette sweeping furtively
across the background. The song is complete
with a spoken soliloquy and haunting chants.
The cheesy yet pretty "Always" begs you to sing
along, while the bouncy, relentless beat of
"Run to the Sun" makes it an instant dance hit.
The best part of the album is the cover art
— a cool blue peek from the woods at a far
away castle under a smiling moon. Next to a
reflecting lake is a glimpse of the Erasure duo,
Bell and Vince Clark, drawn as cute super
deformed cartoon characters. "What a lovely
world / waxing lyrical." Indeed ... but rec
ommended for ages 17 and under.
