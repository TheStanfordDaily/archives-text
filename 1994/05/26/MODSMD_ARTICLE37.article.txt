# "hints, allegations & things left unsaid" Collective Soul
## 
### 
Ah. Collective Soul. Songs for the college
crowd. I mean really, with the title like Collective
Soul, we're headed for some really deep stuff.
Not convinced? What? This sounds like
cotton-mouth philosophy? Yeah, yeah, yeah,
my sentiments exactly — and my sentiments
of newcomers Collective Soul too. Listening
to its first album "hints, allegations, and
things left unsaid" leaves me feeling blah —
like everyone's wearing the brand new J.
Crew outfit I just bought. Nothing about this
get-up is new.
Oh well. Not that this album is a waste of
time (funny, that's even the name of one of
the songs). There are moments — teasing
moments — when Collective Soul bares its
own alternative rock, granola-grunge char
acter. Take "Scream" for instance: it's urgent,
nihilistic and self-possessed. singer Ed
Roland belts out, "There you go with all your
might / Giving promises by decree ... I

don't want to live in false reality / See I'm the
one obsessed with truth and honesty."
In another song, "Love Lifted Me," Col
lective Soul juxtaposes hard-edged playing
and aggressive vocals with optimistic lyrics:
"Once I was down and couldn't see I be
lieve that love lifted me."
Undoubtedly, Collective Soul takes this
peace, love, and happiness stuff a little too
far. (Sensie-boy gone rampant, perhaps?)
About two-thirds of the album centers on
being uplifted through love or self-aware
ness (and so, a collective sigh of resentment
may result from listening to Collective Soul's
preachy-keen lyrics).
Suffice it to say that "hints, allegations,
and things left unsaid" carries its own — pre
cariously. Tepid vocals and an overall over
produced sound fail to resonate at that ever
so-plcasing frequency which stimulates the
frontal lobe. Even "Sister Don't Cry," which
has some of the strongest singing on the
album, sounds too much like some U2 song
with a taste of Pink Floyd. Or maybe it's the
Cure. Or maybe, you'll never know, because
Collective Soul cannot completely compel its
listener to sit still, concentrate and enjoy.
