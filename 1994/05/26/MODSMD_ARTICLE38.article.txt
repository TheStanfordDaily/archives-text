## Late, for the Jrain has miles and miles of style 
### Julie Tsai 
Ah, ambiance. It's what lifts the
spirits after endless evenings study
ing in pasty study rooms. It's what
delights the ladies who lunch. It's
what Taco Bell doesn't have. And it's
what you pay for at I>ate for the Train.
A sweet little breakfast-specialty
alternative to Hobee's, Late for the
Train is so precious and comfy, I
could eat it up. It's beautiful inside
and out, and if the weather permits,
cat at the tables out on the porch.
With the sun shining down, a but
tered scone, a slice of kiwi and some
fresh orange juice are just so perfect
ly Nice. Indeed, the declaration on
the dinner menu even promises "to
create nurturing and nourishing
dishes." I'm not sure if my omelet was
very nurturing, but it's a nice idea.
It's a little pricey, though, and the
food on the second visit was incon

sistent.
The omelets, offered with avoca
do, cheese, liver, turkey or various
veggies, run from $5.75-$7.25 and
are served with a scone and potatoes
or fruit. The mushroom omelet I had
on the first visit was quite good, nice
ly cooked with just the right amount
of cheese. But the spinach one I en
countered on the second visit had
runny eggs and about two spinach
shreds in the whole thing. It could
have been an aberration, though,
since the "Big Bill" turkey special my
friend enjoyed seemed fine.
Given the choice between fruit or
potatoes, take the fruit. The fruit was
pretty, delicious and just ripe while
the potatoes were greasy and hinted
darkly of being doused in soy sauce.
Beside omelets, there's also fish,
other versions of eggs and a turkey

hash that won raves. These range
from $4.65-$7.50. Pancakes and
French toast are a relative deal for $6
or less with fruit or other accouter
ments. Granola and fruit salad are
also offered for the light eater.
Fresh squeezed orange juice is lus
cious and although $2.50 is steep for a
nice sized glass, it's worth it
For lunchers, there are sandwich
es, soups, salads and other hot dish
es available. From the hot dishes, one
could choose from turkey, cheese,
fish or crab salads, tofu, smoked
chicken or fresh fish priced from
$6.75-$9.95. There's also a nice vari
ety of salads including tabbouli, fish,
chutney chicken or a "salad sand
wich," ranging from $6.50-$9.25.
The Light dinner selection covers
things from good old hamburgers
and salads to the uniquely Californ-

ian. I must admit, I'm
very curious about the
ginger/pineapple tofu
stir-fry. Another
night, perhaps. You'll
shell out anywhere
from $6.50-59.75 for
those entrees and $4-
$9.25 for the salads.
There are also some
serious dinners like
ribeye steak and pasta
specialties which
range from $9.25-
$ 15.50. There are even
some "first course"
sopes (gourmet piz
zas) offered for about
$6.

Tax, tip and brunch for two came
out to roughly $22. And the break
fast food seems to be better early in
