Bad Girls
The title says it all: "Bad Girls" really
is bad. Despite vaunting itself as the
first female-centered frontier shoot
'em up, director Jonathan Kaplan
does nothing more than crib scenes
from classic Westerns that fill the
movie with aimless action instead of
plot or relevant issues. So don't let
it's claim to the top spot at the box
office fool you — after all, "Ace Ven
tura" was there for multiple weeks. R
Being Human
"Being Human" is about, well, being
human. Despite such a metaphysi
cal subject, this convoluted flick
flops in its attempt to be deep. Al
though you might ask yourself
"What's the point?" throughout the
movie, by the end, you're saying,
"That's a rather simplistic mes
sage." Not even Robin Williams can
save this one. PG-13
Belle Epoque
In the tradition of critically-ac
claimed, innocuous, little-known
European movies comes Spanish
director Fernando Trueba's "Belle
Epoque." But don't let the hype of a
Best Foreign Film Oscar fool you:
the story of four farmer's daughters
and a Spanish army deserter con
tains sizzling sex scenes but little
historical or political content. In
essence, 1993's winner proves to

be nothing more than a dressed-up
Penthouse Forum letter. R
Cronos
Writer/director Guillermo del Toro's
stylish vampire flick "Cronos" proves
to be well-paced and constantly in
triguing. Mysterious, exotic settings
add a nice backdrop for the engag
ing Mexican version of the standard
horror tale. Unlike its ilk in this genre,
"Cronos" gives you something to
think about after it's over. Unrated
The Crow
Although "The Crow" is the sort of
movie everyone's hoping will be
good, the movie just isn't. The story
of a resurrected rocker who exacts
his own kind of justice gets boring
and predictable. Too bad a strong
performance by the late Brandon
Lee had to be wasted on an unorigi
nal flick like this one. R
Even Cowgirls Get the Blues
Expectations were high for "Even
Cowgirls Get the Blues": after all,
what could go wrong with the cre
ative dynamic duo of author Tom
Robbins and director Gus Van Sant
at the helm? Yet even with these
high hopes, the movie turns out to
be a tad disappointing — incredible
scenes don't mesh and characters
and themes aren't developed. Still,
it's probably worth your while to

catch this film. R
Four Weddings and a Funeral
"Four Weddings and a Funeral" ac
tually lives up to the hype as a
crowd-pleasing comedy. While it
may not explore the deep meaning
of life, the flick serves up breezy fun
with inspired comedy. The delightful
cast, featuring Andie MacDowell
and the omnipresent Hugh Grant,
does a good job of moving the
movie along. R
Germinal
Director Claude Berri does an im
peccable job of translating 19th cen
tury French writer Emile Zola's clas
sic novel "Germinal" to film. While
the performances of Gerard Depar
dieu and Miou-Miou shine, it's the
infernal mine that steals the show.
Sure, the movie might be long on
melodrama, but it still gives a good
glimpse of French history. R
No Escape
Ray Liotta goes from mob henchman
in-hiding in "Goodfellas" to an "aver
sive to authority" criminal exiled on an
island in the futuristic "No Escape."
OK, the premise might be a tad
hokey, but the movie does supply
some good, fast-paced action
scenes. Still, if you're looking for
something brainy, stay away from this
flick. R

Serial Mom
Kathleen Turner is evidently having
fun playing the part of a psycho
everything-is-not-dandy-a-la-Nor-
man-Rockwell Serial Mom in this
new, well-endowed John Waters
flick. It's a parody of suburban
America (typical Waters fare) with an
added bonus of a "Basic Instinct"
style courtroom gag. While not alto
gether a phenomenal work, it's
worth seeing. R
When a Man Loves a Woman
Yes, "When a Man Loves a Woman"
might bring a tear to the eye of the
most jaded of us. Still, something
about this Meg Ryan/Andy Garcia
vehicle about alcoholism and fami
lies and recovery and relationships
doesn't ring true; it seems like pub
lic service announcement for rehab
and pop psychology. R
With Honors
In a year of mediocre college
movies, "With Honors" graduates in
the middle of its class. Yes, it's an
other one of those which shows how
a bookworm (Brendan Fraser)
learns lessons of life from an oh-so
wise homeless guy (Joe Pesci). To
make matters worse, director Alek
Keshishian milks as much humor
out of the relationship as he can
rather than focusing on more evalu
ative situations. PG-13
