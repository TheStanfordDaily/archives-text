# More aid?
## Self-help portion of financial aid dips despite tight purse 
### Piers Henwood Staff writer 
Stanford has reduced the self
help component of its financial aid
policy by 4 percent over the past
two years, despite the crunch of
the University's budget problems.
The self-help component of fi
nancial aid packages refers to aid
awarded in the form of a long-term
loan and student employment. As
opposed to scholarship aid, it re
quires that the student repay the
loan in the future and hold down a
job.
In 1991-92, the amount of self
help aid given to freshman com
prised 25 percent of the total esti
mated cost for one year at Stan
ford. In 1993-94, by contrast, the
self-help component for the fresh
man class was reduced to 21 per
cent.
In other words, students on fi
nancial aid are required to pay for
less of their tuition through loans
or jobs.
Cynthia Rife, assistant director
of financial aids, said this change is
representative of Stanford's phi
losophy in general.
"The University is continuing
its commitment to meeting finan
cial need, and that's why we've
tried to make it easier on the stu
dents," she said.
Part of the stimulus for reduc
ing the self-help component of
financial aid was to realign Stan
ford's policy with that of other
major U.S. universities. Rife
remarked that the financial aid
office "does hear from many stu
dents . . . about those schools
which have more generous finan
cial aid policies."
In 1990-91, for example, Har
vard's self-help component added
up to $4,100. Stanford, on the
other hand, designated $5,450 for

self-help that year, making their
financial aid packages less attrac
tive in comparison.
Since that time, however,
Stanford's self-help component
has only increased by 6 percent,
while Harvard's has increased by
30 percent. When considered in
conjunction with increasing
tuition costs, these figures mean
that both universities are now on
even terms, with the self-help
component representing 21 per
cent of the estimated cost of
attending either one.
Despite the reduction in per
centage, the actual dollar amount
of the self-help component at
Stanford has not decreased, due
to tuition inflation.
Rife said the reduction in the
self-help component has been
funded by three main sources:

Stanford general funds, alumni
gifts and endowment income.
The total amount of money gen
erated by these sources this past
year was $30,800,000, a
$3,444,608 increase over last
year's figure.
The reduction has been well
received among the undergradu
ates it affects. Clark Bailey, a
sophomore, noted that a reduc
tion in self-help means greater
security in the future.
"It's just nice to know I'm not
going to have to pay off loans for
the next five years," he said.
Ralf Davis, a senior, concluded
that a reduction in the self-help
component is simply a relief for
students. "Too much work can be
difficult. The last thing I want to
be doing is working when I've got
studying to do," he said.
