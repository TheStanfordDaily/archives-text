# Easing culture shock
## Program matches Bosnian immigrants with student tutors 
### Emily Bazar Staff writer 
A tutoring program aimed at helping recent Bosn
ian immigrants improve their English and adapt to a
new way of life kicked off at a meeting yesterday that
brought together volunteers and Emigres.
Sheri Fink, co-director of the group coordinating
the effort, Students Against Genocide, said the pro
gram is both educational and social.
"I'm hoping that the program will start with tutor
ing once a week and it will progress to friendships and
more," Fink said.
The tutoring program, financed by the ASSU's com
munity development fund, will link refugees from the
surrounding area with Stanford students who are in
terested in teaching English and helping the newly ar
rived Bosnians adapt to American life.
"It's culture shock," Fink said. "These Bosnians
just got here. The idea is to have them meet students to
welcome them and to practice their English. We want
to help them get used to their new environment."
For 18-year-old Lejla Izetbegovic, the program will
allow her to meet some Americans and learn about
American culture.
Izetbegovic, whose uncle is the president of Bosnia-
Herzegovina, arrived in the United States five months
ago. She said that back home, she feared for her life.
"I left Bosnia because I was scared. If the Serbs
came, they would kill me because I'm related to [the
president]," she said.
Izetbegovic said it has been difficult meeting Amer
icans, noting differences between American and Bosn
ian society.
"People here are scared to meet new people. They
are always in their cars or homes," she said. "In Bosnia,
the connection between people is very close. People are
always outside in cafes and in the streets meeting peo
ple. People in Bosnia eryoy life more than here."
Zrinka Bakovic, who is learning English at an adult
school, also hopes to meet new people in the process of
working with a Stanford student.
"You can study very well if you're in contact with
other American people," Bakovic said. "When I come
home from my school, we speak Bosnian. ... If you're
not in a university and if you don't speak English very

well, it's very hard to speak and go out with American
people."
But Selma Vukotic wants the tutoring program to
be a mutual learning experience. "I'm here to meet peo
ple from Stanford and people who want to learn more
about Bosnia and the war," she said.

wants to become informed about
their culture.
"I like the idea of actually hav
ing contact with the Bosnians
rather than just hearing about
them on the news. I really want to
hear their point of view and hear

what they're feeling as refugees,"
Terrazas said.
But Terrazas added that she is
volunteering primarily to help the
Bosnians feel more comfortable in
their new environment.
"Being in contact with someone
who cares will help them, it will
make them feel more comfort
able," she said. "Knowing that
there is someone who will take the
time to talk in English, they won't
feel like strangers."

Fink said yesterday's meeting
in Bechtel International Center
initiated the program and
allowed interested students and
about 10 Bosnians to trade phone
numbers and set up times when
they could begin the tutoring ses
sions.
SAGE, a student group formed
last fall, wishes to raise awareness
about the war in Bosnia through
community outreach, fund raising
and political activism.
