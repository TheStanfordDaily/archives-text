# Grading policy debate, budget discussion:
## Packed agenda for Faculty Senate 
### Andy Dworkin Senior staff writer 
The Faculty Senate will sink its
teeth into both money and marks
tomorrow as they hear a presenta
tion on Stanford's budget for the
next school year and debate a con
troversial proposal to change the
grading policy.
Provost Condoleezza Rice will
present the senators with an
overview of Stanford's $1.2 billion
budget, a document that includes
just under $500 million in expendi
tures of unrestricted funds. The
budget also contains more than $6
million in budget cuts, part of a
University effort to trim $18 mil
lion over the next three years.
This marks the first year that the
University has compiled a consoli
dated budget — a budget that lists
both restricted and unrestricted in
come and expenditures as well as the

University's capital budget. That ex
plains why this year's total budget
weighs in at $ 1.2 billion, about three
times its level in past years when
only the operating budget has been
presented to the senate.
Accompanying the capital bud
get information, the University has
included a five-year, $660 million

plan for Stanford's capital expendi
tures. The blueprint includes pro
posals for seismic repairs, new
buildings and renovation.
After the faculty hears about
Stanford's financial future, they
will debate the future of grading on
