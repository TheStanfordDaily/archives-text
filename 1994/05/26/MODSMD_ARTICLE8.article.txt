# Hoover fellows address urban issues
## 
### Kyle Graham Staff writer 
Last night, the Hoover Institu
tion issued a strong anti-war state
ment. However the wars in ques
tion were the war on poverty and
the war on drugs, both cited as fail
ure-laden struggles by panelists
discussing "The Future of the
American City."
The year's third and final install
ment of the Hoover Series on Public
Policy, the panel discussion focused
upon "problems which tend to show
up in cities, though they might not

solely be urban problems," accord
ing to moderator and Senior Hoover
Fellow Edward Lazear.
As such, the subjects of school
choice, welfare and crime took cen
ter stage in Annenberg Auditori
um. Concerning these issues,
Hoover Fellows Terry Moe,
Thomas MaCurdy and Joseph Mc-
Namara agreed, in the words of Mc-
Namara, "the federal government
really is part of the problem."
Speaking first, Lazear presented
a broad overview of the difficulties
inherent in any attempt to resolve
the problems facing inner cities.

"It's very difficult to eliminate a
problem at a local level when
there's always the possibility of
spillover to neighboring areas,"
said Lazear, also a professor at the
Graduate School of Business.
MaCurdy, speaking next, em
phasized this point while discussing
the workings of the welfare system.
The economics professor attacked
the concept of an ever-growing wel
fare class, buttressing his argu
ment with charts displaying a level
rate of welfare funding over the
past two decades.
Later, the professor argued
that welfare had grown less,
rather than more, ingrained with
in the national fabric. "Welfare is
becoming less generous in this
nation; in addition, there is no evi
dence of long-term dependency on
the welfare system," MaCurdy
said.
However, MaCurdy also told the
audience of approximately 175 that
the current welfare system pos
sesses several inherent flaws.
"We've made it much better for the
extremely low-income recipients,"
he said, "but we've increased the
tax rate for people just over the
poverty level."

police for San Jose, discussed the
growing association of crime with
the inner city.
Even though crime statistics
have leveled off in recent years, he
said, "there has been a change in
the perception of crime, because
television brings the tragedies of
crime into our homes every
night."
In addition, McNamara said

increasing access to lethal weapon
ry among inner-city youths is
responsible for high crime rates in
the central cities, and decried what
he saw as the failure of the war on
drugs.
"We've waged a $150 billion war
on drugs, and now it's time to look
at the report card," he said. "What
have we accomplished? Not all that
much."
Moe echoed McNamara's dissat
isfaction with government efforts
to solve inner-city problems.
In the course of calling for less
bureaucracy and more local
empowerment over schools, Moe
questioned the ability of the feder
al government to resolve any press
ing problems.
"The war on poverty didn't
work. None of our wars, invoking
any of our problems, have
worked," he said.
