# Hoover fellows address urban issues
## 
### Kyle Graham Staff writer 
Last night, the Hoover Institu
tion issued a strong anti-war state
ment. However the wars in ques
tion were the war on poverty and
the war on drugs, both cited as fail
ure-laden struggles by panelists
discussing "The Future of the
American City."
The year's third and final install
ment of the Hoover Series on Public
Policy, the panel discussion focused
upon "problems which tend to show
up in cities, though they might not

solely be urban problems," accord
ing to moderator and Senior Hoover
Fellow Edward Lazear.
As such, the subjects of school
choice, welfare and crime took cen
ter stage in Annenberg Auditori
um. Concerning these issues,
Hoover Fellows Terry Moe,
Thomas MaCurdy and Joseph Mc-
Namara agreed, in the words of Mc-
Namara, "the federal government
really is part of the problem."
Speaking first, Lazear presented
a broad overview of the difficulties
inherent in any attempt to resolve
the problems facing inner cities.

"It's very difficult to eliminate a
problem at a local level when
there's always the possibility of
spillover to neighboring areas,"
said Lazear, also a professor at the
Graduate School of Business.
MaCurdy, speaking next, em
phasized this point while discussing
the workings of the welfare system.
The economics professor attacked
the concept of an ever-growing wel
fare class, buttressing his argu
ment with charts displaying a level
rate of welfare funding over the
past two decades.
