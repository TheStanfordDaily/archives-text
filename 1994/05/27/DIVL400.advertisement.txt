The career that you
knew was out there
Ask any of the many Stanford grads who have found a home at
Infinity International Financial Technology Inc. They'll tell you
that at Infinity you won't be just another cog in an aimless
machine. You won't be competing with thirteen fellow Class Six
Junior Assistant Account Executives. You won't be tortured by an
overbearing boss. You won't have your ideas fall on deaf ears.
You'll be helping to build state-of-the-art object-oriented trading
systems for the world's leading financial institutions. You'll have
responsibility for major projects from conception to completion.
You'll gain international business experience by helping to
capture market share in major financial centers like New York,
London, Tokyo, and Toronto.
If you're a self-starter looking for an opportunity to join a young,
intense, successful, and growing team, send a cover letter,
resume and unofficial transcript to the address below.
