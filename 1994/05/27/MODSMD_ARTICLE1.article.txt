# Res Ed to report to Edmonds directly
## 
### Marc Lee Staff writer 
Vice Provost and Dean for Stu
dent Affairs Mary Edmonds recom
mended yesterday that the Office
of Residential Education should re
main in direct report to her rather
than falling under the umbrella of
Housing and Dining Services.
In addition, she said that dia
logue about increased academic
oversight of Res Ed will resume in
the fall. Possible changes include
creating a half-time faculty dean of
Residential Education and enhanc
ing the Faculty Senate's Commit
tee on Undergraduate Studies by
assigning the associate dean of un
dergraduate education and one
other faculty member "to provide
needed oversight of academic com
ponents of Res Ed," Edmonds said.
Edmonds created controversy
in January through a plan to move
Res Ed from its current position so
that it would be headed by Keith
Guy, director of Housing and Din
ing Services.
Resident fellows, administra
tors and faculty members contest
ed the proposed change, fearing
that the move would compromise
the educational aspects of Res Ed.
The move was part of a larger
scheme to reorganize and stream
line the "unwieldy" structure of
Student Affairs.
But yesterday, several RFs who
had previously challenged this deci
sion expressed renewed optimism
in response to Edmonds' an
nouncements.
"I think that's a very healthful
move," said Larkin RF Sue Har
vey. "What we're seeing now is a
much more promising direction for
Res Ed to move in than what we
saw (before)."
Edmonds emphasized the col
laborative effort that has since
evolved. "We've seen a collegial
coming together that's been very
positive, and that will continue,"
she said.
She has been working closely
with an advisory group — the Rep
resentative Committee — that she
called together in response to the
original controversy.
Edmonds said yesterday that
she and the group have "agreed in
principle" with the recommenda
tions proposed by the Faculty Sen
ate's Subcommittee on Residential
Education and Advising, which
reconvened last November and,
earlier this month, presented an
initial draft of seven recommenda

tions responding to Edmonds' pro
posed restructuring plan.
"On the fundamental principles,
there's real agreement between
RFs, Mary and the [subcommit
tee]," said Communication Prof.
Jeremy Cohen, who chairs the
group. "She has not only listened,
she has acted on the advice of RFs
and [the subcommittee]."
Guy said that he personally felt
the plan to merge Res Ed and Hous
ing and Dining Services was a
workable one. "It was my con
tention that it could have been
done," he said. However, he empha
sized that Housing and Dining Ser
vices is "prepared to support"
Edmonds' latest decision. "We will
work hard to support it,"he added.
Edmonds said there had been lit
tle controversy over the need to
have greater oversight on academic
matters in Res Ed.

Indeed, Cohen said that "there's
a lot of misunderstanding among
faculty" as to what takes place in
the residential communities.
He cited a feeling by some that it
is "non-intellectual," saying that
students actually want to partici
pate in intellectual activity. "We
need to engage students in creative
ways in the dorms."
Edmonds and the Representa
tive Committee have also agreed in
principle with the five other
changes recommended by the sen
ate subcommittee — among them,
that graduate housing be placed
within the Res Ed unit, that resi
dence deans again report to the
director of Res Ed instead of report
ing to the Dean of Students as they
do now, and that the subcommittee
itself be permanently reinstated as
a standing senate committee or
subcommittee.

The remaining two recommen
dations asked for improved faculty
oversight of Res Ed, by having the
provost take an increased role in
recruiting faculty members to serve
in the residential community, and
by creating a standing committee of
unit heads within Student Affairs.
Res Ed would be fully represented
on the committee in conjunction
with the dean of undergraduate
studies in the School of Humanities
and Sciences, and a faculty liaison.
Edmonds said several "serendip
itous" outcomes have resulted from
the reorganization — among them
that "Res Ed faculty, staff and stu
dents began affirming what they
do, identifying problem areas and
defining their role and mission."
"I am real pleased that the pro
cess worked," Edmonds said.
"Everyone who has worked in this
area should be applauded."
