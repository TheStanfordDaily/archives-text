# Stanford's wish list: a $600 million price tag
## 
### Andy Dworkin Senior staff writer 
As part of an effort to compile all of
Stanford's costs and expenses, the Univer
sity has planned a list of all the capital
improvements it wants to make over the
next five years.
Now all Stanford needs is a few hundred
million dollars to make those dreams come
true.
The five-year, $600 million-plus capital
plan was included with the consolidated
budget for next year — a budget that lists
all the costs the University expects to
incur, including money spent on the physi
cal plant.
Presenting the budget to the Faculty
Senate yesterday, Provost Condoleezza
Rice said that the capital plan represents
"an effort to put together all of our various
buildings and other projects," decide which
are priorities and see where money must go
— and how some money can be saved — in
coming years.
The plan will cover everything "from the
Athletics Department to the Medical Cen
ter and everything in-between," said Uni
versity Budget Director Tim Warner.
The plan calls for Stanford to spend
$661.4 million on capital projects over the
next five years. Of the total, $148.1 million

will have to come from donations the Uni
versity has yet to raise, and $258.1 million
will be covered by debt financing. Stanford
has already issued bonds covering about
$100 million of that debt, Warner said.
The broad areas covered by the faculty
plan are fivefold: construction dealing with
earthquakes, development of University
programs, campus restoration, complying
with health and safety codes, and mainte
nance projects.
If everything proceeds as planned, by
1999 Stanford should have fixed almost all
the damage from 1989's Loma Prieta
earthquake.
That means over the next five years,
Green Library West, the Language Corner
and the Geology Corner of the Quad should
all be open. Workers will also strengthen
some unreinforced masonry buildings —
including, Rice said, Building 10, which
contains her office as well as that of Uni
versity President Gerhard Casper.
New construction projects scheduled
include a project to extend Sand Hill Road,
improvements in Housing and Dining Ser
vices and new buildings including the
Gates Information Science Building, a
Cancer and Neurosciences Building for the
School of Medicine and an expansion of the
Stanford Museum.
Health and safety improvements include

construction to bring Stanford in line with
the Americans with Disabilities Act. Much
of that work is slated for student resi
d 6 n cos
Money will also go to rejuvenating parts
of campus.
The Pasteur Drive entrance to the Med
ical Center will be spruced up, and parts of
the Main Quad will be restored, including
the balustrade at the front of the Quad and
the (now missing) west gate. Portions of
Serra Street along the front edge of cam
pus will also be developed to align them
with an old design drawn by architect
Frederick Law Olmsted, including a pedes
trian mall.
Warner said the most important thing
about the capital plan is that "over the
next five years we think we can make some
significant improvements in the capital
stock of the campus." He stressed that the
University would become much safer from
earthquake damage, reduce a backlog of
maintenance and support the academic
program.
''It's probably at least a dozen years
since we've done this kind of forward-look
ing capital plan," Warner said.
But, he pointed out the plan is just a
"forecast" and said completion of the
plan's various facets depends to a large
extent on future fund raising.
