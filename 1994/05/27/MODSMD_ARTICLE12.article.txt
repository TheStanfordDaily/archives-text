# China's trade privileges renewed
## Clinton severs link between trade status and human rights issues

WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Clinton renewed trade privileges for
China yesterday, but acknowledged that
Beijing did not meet his demand for sig
nificant overall progress in human
rights.
In a major retreat, Clinton said he
was severing the link between China's
trade status and human rights issues.
"We have reached the end of the use
fulness of that policy," the president said
at a news conference.
Still, Clinton coupled his announce
ment with a ban on imports of guns and
ammunition from China.
Clinton said China had made
progress in important areas of human
rights but did not achieve "overall signif
icant progress," the condition he placed
on continued trade privileges a year ago.
He said that serious human rights abus

es continue.
The president said extending trade
privileges "will avoid isolating China and
will permit us to engage the Chinese."
His statement echoed the position of for
mer President Bush, whose policies
toward China were sharply criticized by
Clinton during the presidential cam
paign.
"I think we have to see our relations
with China within the broader context of
our policies within the Pacific-Asian
region," the president said.
Clinton had been under heavy pres
sure from business interests to extend
trade privileges to China, the world's
fastest growing economy. American
businesses export $8 billion in goods to
China, underwriting more than 150,000
jobs in the United States.
Human rights groups had pressed

Clinton to stick with the goal he set last
year of insisting that China's trade priv
ileges be tied directly to progress on
human rights.
Addressing those concerns, Clinton
said, "Let me ask you the same question
I have asked myself. . . Will we do more
to advance the cause of human rights if
China is isolated?
"I am persuaded that the best path
for advancing freedom in China is for
the United States to intensify and broad
en its relations (with Beijing)," he said.
Clinton argued that China should not
be treated differently from other trading
partners.
"The United States has pursued the
cause of human rights around the world
in many, many ways without tying it to
most-favored-nation (trade status) in
those countries," he said.
