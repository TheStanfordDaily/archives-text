# Law bans blockade of abortion clinics
## Opponents call law a 'blow to free speech,' go to court to block it 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Clinton signed legislation yesterday
subjecting abortion protesters to jail
time and stiff fines if they block
access to clinics. Enraged opponents
called the law a blow to free speech,
and went to court to block it.
As he signed the bill, Clinton's
remarks alternated between repudia
tion of "extremism and vigilante con
duct," and a soothing call for peace.
"No person seeking medical care —
no physician providing that care —
should have to endure harassments
or threats or obstruction or intimida
tion or even murder from vigilantes
who take the law into their own
hands because they think they know
what the law ought to be," Clinton
said.
The National Right to Life Com
mittee accused the president of
empowering abortion-rights activists
to "crush peaceful protesters' free
speech with federal lawsuits." Two
anti-abortion groups Filed suit to void
the law; others vowed to ignore it.
The legislation, which took effect

immediately, was a major victory for
abortion-rights groups. People who
block access to women's health clinics
or use force or threats against
patients and employees face prison
terms from six months to life and
fines of up to $250,000.
The Senate approved the bill 69-30
this month, following a 241-174
House vote.
Clinton's approval was expected,
as was the fervent opposition, but the
bill's easy journey through Congress
and into law marks a shift under a
Democratic administration.
An American Civil Liberties Union
statement called the legislation "a
milestone in congressional protection
for reproductive freedom."
Citing the recent agreement under
which the RU-486 abortion pill would
be tested in the United States,
Eleanor Smeal of The Fund for the
Feminist Majority said, "With a one
two punch, the Clinton administra
tion has increased abortion access
dramatically."
Early in his term, Clinton kept

campaign promises to abortion-rights
groups, a powerful constituency in
the Democratic Party. One executive
order allowed abortions in military
hospitals; another overturned a Bush
administration policy forbidding
abortion counseling in federally fund
ed clinics.
Legal papers were filed against the
clinic law even before Clinton signed
it.
The American Life League based in
Stafford, Va., sought an injunction in
an Alexandria, Va., federal court to
prevent the new law from taking
effect.
A second challenge was filed within
an hour by the American Center for
Law and Justice, an anti-abortion
public interest law firm, on behalf of
Operation Rescue and Randall Terry.
It was filed in federal court in Wash
ington.
Jim Henderson, an American Cen
ter attorney, said the lawsuit con
tends the law is "a violation of the
religious freedom rights of the clients
that we're representing in the case."
