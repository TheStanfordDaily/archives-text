## Editorial The 						un-Dead Week 
### 
Policy must be changed
to provide a real break
between classes, finals

According to university
policy, "Dead Week is a peri
od of reduced social and
extracurricular activity preceding
final examinations. Its purpose is
to permit students to concentrate
on academic work and prepare for
final examinations."
According to everyone else,
Dead Week is a time when profes
sors cram in more material than
usual, term papers are due and
students have to prepare for finals.
All in a period of just a few days.
But, as Stanford heads into the
last Dead Week of the academic
year, students should feel relieved
— and not just because summer is
just days away. This quarter may
be the last time students have just
a day between their last class and
first final.
The Commission on Undergrad
uate Education has heard the
complaints about Dead Week and
is planning to propose a fair solu
tion: creation of two "Dead Days"
per quarter.
These days, which cannot fall
on weekends, will be truly "dead":
there will be no classes and no
papers will be due.
Although the proposed two
days off would still fall short of
the policies at other schools,
Stanford students should be con
tent. The constraints of the quar
ter system make a week-long
study period — common at some

semester schools — unfeasible.
If implemented, students would
have four days for uninterrupted
study for their exams during
autumn and winter quarters —
the two Dead Days plus the week
end. That should be a marked
improvement over the current sys
tem as long as Stanford can dis
courage professors from making
the other three days of Dead Week
even more hellish.
Understandably, professors
want to spend as much time as
possible presenting new material
— 10 weeks is hardly enough time
to properly read and discuss
Homer's "Iliad," let alone the
entire contents of a typical Cul
tures, Ideas and Values syllabus.
Still, the tight constraints of the
quarter system cannot be used to
justify heavy work loads during
Dead Week.
Under the current policy, stu
dents don't have that luxury. Only
a weekend separates the last class
of the quarter — often the due
date for final papers — and the
start of exams. As a result, many
students try to cram 10 weeks of
material the night before the test
— only to forget it a week later.
With a couple extra free days to
study, students should be able to
absorb better the information pre
sented during the quarter for the
long-term. Lax enforcement of
and little respect for the current
policy has made Dead Week just
another week of the quarter —
and a hectic one at that.
The current policy drains life
from students and kills intellectu
alism. The new one should fix
those problems, as long as it is
specifically laid out in University
policy.
