On May 27, 1932, The Daily reported that the "warring frosh" of Encina
attacked Breakers and El Toro to continue the water fights that had broken out
between Encina and Toyon Halls. A "vigilant eating club man" apparently sound
ed the alarm, allowing the Toyon residents to retreat, regroup and eventually win
the battle. "Another raid is rumored around noon tomorrow," The Daily wrote,
"with both halls at fever excitement and a wild frosh desire for revenge."
