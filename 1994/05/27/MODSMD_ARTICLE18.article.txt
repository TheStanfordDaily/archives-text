## Jeffrey Au The 						myth of white affirmative action 
### 
IN ADDITION TO providing students
with opportunities to research and
understand their own history and roots
in this country, Stanford's faculty and
administration, by their own actions, have
demonstrated a broader need for scholar
ship in Asian-American Studies.
They have demonstrated an urgent
need for non-Asian-Americans, particular
ly policy makers, to gain a greater under
standing of Asian-American history, demo
graphics and their implications for our
society as a whole. This is clearly shown by
Stanford's handling of allegations of racial
discrimination against Asian-Americans in
undergraduate admissions in the mid
1980s, and the recent responses by some
Stanford faculty to increased Asian-Amer
ican enrollment. With Asian-Americans, as
with any other racial group, those who fail
to learn from history are condemned to
repeat it.
As a member of Stanford's 1985-86 Fac
ulty Committee on Undergraduate Admis
sions and Financial Aids (CUAFA) and as
the concerned student who instigated
CUAFA's internal investigation of Stan
ford's admissions practices toward Asian
Americans almost a decade ago, I was
intrigued by Political Science Prof.
Stephen Krasner's comments to Stan
ford's Faculty Senate this past January
(San Francisco Chronicle, Jan. 26, 1994).
Krasner estimated that white Christian
students at Stanford are half their repre
sentation in the general population, and

that Asians and Jews are "way overrepre
sented." Krasner further asked Dean of
Admissions James Montoya to explain why
in the decade between 1983 and 1993,
white student enrollment had dropped by
17 percent, while Asian-American enroll
ment increased by 17 percent, and percent
ages of other minorities essentially have
been stable. Montoya attributed these
numbers primarily to demographic
changes.
Unfortunately, the answer may not be
that simple. First, Krasner's perceived
problem of growing Asian-American
enrollment is much more significant than
it first appears. Asian-American freshmen
at Stanford have increased from about 7
percent in 1983 to about 24 percent in
1993 — an increase of about 17 percent of
all freshmen, as Krasner properly notes.
But relative to Asian-Americans alone,
these numbers indicate that Asian-Ameri
can freshmen at Stanford today constitute
more than 340 percent of their representa
tion in 1983.
Attributing this surge to demographics
is problematic because the rise in Asian-
American enrollment at no other compara
ble school has been as dramatic, or has cor
responded in timing to Stanford.
It is also problematic to attribute the
surge in Stanford's Asian-American enroll
ment to improved racial "sensitivity train
ing" was implemented among admissions
officers. The first dramatic increase in
1986 occurred the year before "sensitivity

training." Nor can rising Asian-American
enrollment be attributed to affirmative
action preferences because Asian-Ameri
can applicants to Stanford have not
receivcxl such preferences since the 19705.
Finally, it is critical to note that recent
"white underrepresentation" at Stanford
cannot be attributed to affirmative action
preferences given to other racial minori
ties, because their enrollment, as Krasner
acknowledges, has remained relatively
constant.
After investigating all criteria for
admission, CUAFA's Subcommittee on
Asian American Admissions in 1986 con
cluded, "No factor we considered can
explain completely the discrepancy in
admission rates between Asian Americans
and whites." Holding qualifications con
stant, in every grouping of academic, non
academic and extracurricular ratings, and
for every intended major, Asian-Americans
had significantly lower admission rates
than whites.
The subcommittee concluded that
numerical caps had not been placed on
Asian-American admissions, although in
my opinion, as I stated for the record at the
time, this hypothesis was not investigated
thoroughly enough. In an April 9, 1986 let
ter to the subcommittee's chairman, I stat
ed, "My primary objection to the subcom
mittee's conclusions ... is that they fail to
resolve several key questions.... In the

absence of conclusive data, to
surmise or even imply that
Asian-Americans, as a group,
are somehow significantly and
systematically deficient in terms
of "subjective" criteria, merely
because some alternative
hypotheses for low Asian admit
rates have been disproven,
seems to exacerbate rather than
alleviate problems of inaccurate
racial stereotyping."
Notwithstanding, these
objections, Stanford's adminis
tration and Faculty Senate
apparently enjoyed the subcom
mittee's conclusions. Then-
Provost James Rosse stated,
"This is an extraordinary report
from an extraordinary commit
tee. . . . Its study of Asian-
American admissions is one of
the most careful pieces of aca

demic analysis and statesman
ship I've seen in quite a while.
This is an example of academic
administration working
through a faculty committee at
its best." The then-Faculty Sen
ate Chair Kenneth Arrow called
the report "superb."
So how should CUAFA and
Stanford's Admissions Office
respond to Krasner's questions?
First, opponents of affirmative
action should stop scapegoating
affirmative action for recent
"white underrepresentation,"
perceived "academic decline" and
low enrollment yields. Because
the representation of targeted
minorities has remained relative
ly constant, affirmative action
can account for none of the above.
Those who oppose affirmative
action on "meritocratic" grounds
should applaud Asian-American
"overrepresentation" based on
merit. Indeed, among affirmative
action critics, this issue truly sep
arates the meritocrats from the

racists.
Second, Stanford should con
tinue, and not reverse, the
progress it has made on Asian-
American admissions. Specifi
cally, it should follow the rule
that all racial groups not target
ed for affirmative action prefer
ences (i.e., Asian-Americans
and whites) should be treated
equally on a color-blind basis. If
the applicant pools of these
groups are about equally quali
fied, they should have approxi
mately equal admit rates —
regardless of whether this may
result in the "overrepresenta
tion" of one group relative to
the general population.
If CUAFA's new Affirmative
Action Subcommittee is in any
way contemplating imposing
new limits on Asian-American
admissions, or put more
euphemistically, intends to
grant affirmative action prefer
ences to whites, CUAFA should
seriously re-examine its objec

tives and consult Stanford's
legal counsel, soon. Such a poli
cy would be not only unfair, but
also in violation of existing law.
Regarding the new crusaders
for "diversity" through reduc
ing Asian-American "overrepre
sentation," we must ask, where
were they for nearly a century
when whites were significantly
"overrepresented" among Stan
ford undergraduates? And
where are they today in criticiz
ing white "overrepresentation"
among Stanford graduate stu
dents and faculty? Even with
increased Asian-American
enrollment, whites remain by
far the largest racial group on
campus. It therefore defies logic
to contend that white represen
tation must be increased for the
sake of promoting racial "diver
sity."
Finally, beyond the statistics,
laws and logic, we must examine
the irrational, indeed racist, ele
ment that appears to be at the

core of this controversy. Why
would we, as individuals, or
Stanford, as an institution, even
perceive Asian-American "over
representation" to be a "prob
lem." Perhaps it is that deep
down, somewhere in the Ameri
can psyche, we still do not per
ceive Asian-Americans, or a uni
versity with "too many" of them,
as being fully "American."
But is this perception justified?
Is San Francisco, with 30 percent
of its population Asian-American,
or any other major American city,
such as Washington D.C., Los
Angeles or New York City, any
less "American" because people of
color are "overrepresented" in
their respective populations rela
tive to the national average? Is
affirmative action for whites liv
ing and working in these cities
needed to promote racial "diversi
ty?" I think not.
Perhaps, for some, the dis
turbing difference is that at
Stanford, people of color are

much more integrated into the
mainstream of college life,
rather than being segregated
into ethnic enclaves at the bot
tom of the socio-economic hier
archy. This difference, however,
should be cause for celebration,
and not regret.
Almost a decade after advo
cating for increased Asian-
American representation at
Stanford, I am dismayed that
some may still be concerned that
we, as Asian-Americans, are
"invading" "their" University.
We are not. We, as Asian-Ameri
cans, are simply insisting upen
fair and equal access to a very
fine institution, that belongs to
us, just as much as "them."

because some alternative
hypotheses for low Asian admit
rates have been disproven,
seems to exacerbate rather than
alleviate problems of inaccurate
racial stereotyping."
Notwithstanding, these
objections, Stanford's adminis
tration and Faculty Senate
apparently enjoyed the subcom
mittee's conclusions. Then-
Provost James Rosse stated,
"This is an extraordinary report
from an extraordinary commit
tee. . . . Its study of Asian-
American admissions is one of
the most careful pieces of aca

demic analysis and statesman
ship I've seen in quite a while.
This is an example of academic
administration working
through a faculty committee at
its best." The then-Faculty Sen
ate Chair Kenneth Arrow called
the report "superb."
So how should CUAFA and
Stanford's Admissions Office
respond to Krasner's questions?
First, opponents of affirmative
action should stop scapegoating
affirmative action for recent
"white underrepresentation,"
perceived "academic decline" and
low enrollment yields. Because
the representation of targeted
minorities has remained relative
ly constant, affirmative action
can account for none of the above.
Those who oppose affirmative
action on "meritocratic" grounds
should applaud Asian-American
"overrepresentation" based on
merit. Indeed, among affirmative
action critics, this issue truly sep
arates the meritocrats from the

racists.
Second, Stanford should con
tinue, and not reverse, the
progress it has made on Asian-
American admissions. Specifi
cally, it should follow the rule
that all racial groups not target
ed for affirmative action prefer
ences (i.e., Asian-Americans
and whites) should be treated
equally on a color-blind basis. If
the applicant pools of these
groups are about equally quali
fied, they should have approxi
mately equal admit rates —
regardless of whether this may
result in the "overrepresenta
tion" of one group relative to
the general population.
If CUAFA's new Affirmative
Action Subcommittee is in any
way contemplating imposing
new limits on Asian-American
admissions, or put more
euphemistically, intends to
grant affirmative action prefer
ences to whites, CUAFA should
seriously re-examine its objec

tives and consult Stanford's
legal counsel, soon. Such a poli
cy would be not only unfair, but
also in violation of existing law.
Regarding the new crusaders
for "diversity" through reduc
ing Asian-American "overrepre
sentation," we must ask, where
were they for nearly a century
when whites were significantly
"overrepresented" among Stan
ford undergraduates? And
where are they today in criticiz
ing white "overrepresentation"
among Stanford graduate stu
dents and faculty? Even with
increased Asian-American
enrollment, whites remain by
far the largest racial group on
campus. It therefore defies logic
to contend that white represen
tation must be increased for the
sake of promoting racial "diver
sity."
Finally, beyond the statistics,
laws and logic, we must examine
the irrational, indeed racist, ele
ment that appears to be at the

core of this controversy. Why
would we, as individuals, or
Stanford, as an institution, even
perceive Asian-American "over
representation" to be a "prob
lem." Perhaps it is that deep
down, somewhere in the Ameri
can psyche, we still do not per
ceive Asian-Americans, or a uni
versity with "too many" of them,
as being fully "American."
But is this perception justified?
Is San Francisco, with 30 percent
of its population Asian-American,
or any other major American city,
such as Washington D.C., Los
Angeles or New York City, any
less "American" because people of
color are "overrepresented" in
their respective populations rela
tive to the national average? Is
affirmative action for whites liv
ing and working in these cities
needed to promote racial "diversi
ty?" I think not.
Perhaps, for some, the dis
turbing difference is that at
Stanford, people of color are

much more integrated into the
mainstream of college life,
rather than being segregated
into ethnic enclaves at the bot
tom of the socio-economic hier
archy. This difference, however,
should be cause for celebration,
and not regret.
Almost a decade after advo
cating for increased Asian-
American representation at
Stanford, I am dismayed that
some may still be concerned that
we, as Asian-Americans, are
"invading" "their" University.
We are not. We, as Asian-Ameri
cans, are simply insisting upen
fair and equal access to a very
fine institution, that belongs to
us, just as much as "them."

IN ADDITION TO providing students
with opportunities to research and
understand their own history and roots
in this country, Stanford's faculty and
administration, by their own actions, have
demonstrated a broader need for scholar
ship in Asian-American Studies.
They have demonstrated an urgent
need for non-Asian-Americans, particular
ly policy makers, to gain a greater under
standing of Asian-American history, demo
graphics and their implications for our
society as a whole. This is clearly shown by
Stanford's handling of allegations of racial
discrimination against Asian-Americans in
undergraduate admissions in the mid
1980s, and the recent responses by some
Stanford faculty to increased Asian-Amer
ican enrollment. With Asian-Americans, as
with any other racial group, those who fail
to learn from history are condemned to
repeat it.
As a member of Stanford's 1985-86 Fac
ulty Committee on Undergraduate Admis
sions and Financial Aids (CUAFA) and as
the concerned student who instigated
CUAFA's internal investigation of Stan
ford's admissions practices toward Asian
Americans almost a decade ago, I was
intrigued by Political Science Prof.
Stephen Krasner's comments to Stan
ford's Faculty Senate this past January
(San Francisco Chronicle, Jan. 26, 1994).
Krasner estimated that white Christian
students at Stanford are half their repre
sentation in the general population, and

that Asians and Jews are "way overrepre
sented." Krasner further asked Dean of
Admissions James Montoya to explain why
in the decade between 1983 and 1993,
white student enrollment had dropped by
17 percent, while Asian-American enroll
ment increased by 17 percent, and percent
ages of other minorities essentially have
been stable. Montoya attributed these
numbers primarily to demographic
changes.
Unfortunately, the answer may not be
that simple. First, Krasner's perceived
problem of growing Asian-American
enrollment is much more significant than
it first appears. Asian-American freshmen
at Stanford have increased from about 7
percent in 1983 to about 24 percent in
1993 — an increase of about 17 percent of
all freshmen, as Krasner properly notes.
But relative to Asian-Americans alone,
these numbers indicate that Asian-Ameri
can freshmen at Stanford today constitute
more than 340 percent of their representa
tion in 1983.
Attributing this surge to demographics
is problematic because the rise in Asian-
American enrollment at no other compara
ble school has been as dramatic, or has cor
responded in timing to Stanford.
It is also problematic to attribute the
surge in Stanford's Asian-American enroll
ment to improved racial "sensitivity train
ing" was implemented among admissions
officers. The first dramatic increase in
1986 occurred the year before "sensitivity

training." Nor can rising Asian-American
enrollment be attributed to affirmative
action preferences because Asian-Ameri
can applicants to Stanford have not
receivcxl such preferences since the 19705.
Finally, it is critical to note that recent
"white underrepresentation" at Stanford
cannot be attributed to affirmative action
preferences given to other racial minori
ties, because their enrollment, as Krasner
acknowledges, has remained relatively
constant.
After investigating all criteria for
admission, CUAFA's Subcommittee on
Asian American Admissions in 1986 con
cluded, "No factor we considered can
explain completely the discrepancy in
admission rates between Asian Americans
and whites." Holding qualifications con
stant, in every grouping of academic, non
academic and extracurricular ratings, and
for every intended major, Asian-Americans
had significantly lower admission rates
than whites.
The subcommittee concluded that
numerical caps had not been placed on
Asian-American admissions, although in
my opinion, as I stated for the record at the
time, this hypothesis was not investigated
thoroughly enough. In an April 9, 1986 let
ter to the subcommittee's chairman, I stat
ed, "My primary objection to the subcom
mittee's conclusions ... is that they fail to
resolve several key questions.... In the

absence of conclusive data, to
surmise or even imply that
Asian-Americans, as a group,
are somehow significantly and
systematically deficient in terms
of "subjective" criteria, merely
because some alternative
hypotheses for low Asian admit
rates have been disproven,
seems to exacerbate rather than
alleviate problems of inaccurate
racial stereotyping."
Notwithstanding, these
objections, Stanford's adminis

apparently enjoyed the subcom

us, just as much as "them."

Jeffrey Au graduated from

and master's degree in interna

currently a practicing attorney
in San Francisco.
