## Jeffrey Au The
						myth of white affirmative action 
### 
IN ADDITION TO providing students
with opportunities to research and
understand their own history and roots
in this country, Stanford's faculty and
administration, by their own actions, have
demonstrated a broader need for scholar
ship in Asian-American Studies.
They have demonstrated an urgent
need for non-Asian-Americans, particular
ly policy makers, to gain a greater under
standing of Asian-American history, demo
graphics and their implications for our
society as a whole. This is clearly shown by
Stanford's handling of allegations of racial
discrimination against Asian-Americans in
undergraduate admissions in the mid
1980s, and the recent responses by some
Stanford faculty to increased Asian-Amer
ican enrollment. With Asian-Americans, as
with any other racial group, those who fail
to learn from history are condemned to
repeat it.
As a member of Stanford's 1985-86 Fac
ulty Committee on Undergraduate Admis
sions and Financial Aids (CUAFA) and as
the concerned student who instigated
CUAFA's internal investigation of Stan
ford's admissions practices toward Asian
Americans almost a decade ago, I was
intrigued by Political Science Prof.
Stephen Krasner's comments to Stan
ford's Faculty Senate this past January
(San Francisco Chronicle, Jan. 26, 1994).
Krasner estimated that white Christian
students at Stanford are half their repre
sentation in the general population, and

that Asians and Jews are "way overrepre
sented." Krasner further asked Dean of
Admissions James Montoya to explain why
in the decade between 1983 and 1993,
white student enrollment had dropped by
17 percent, while Asian-American enroll
ment increased by 17 percent, and percent
ages of other minorities essentially have
been stable. Montoya attributed these
numbers primarily to demographic
changes.
Unfortunately, the answer may not be
that simple. First, Krasner's perceived
problem of growing Asian-American
enrollment is much more significant than
it first appears. Asian-American freshmen
at Stanford have increased from about 7
percent in 1983 to about 24 percent in
1993 â€” an increase of about 17 percent of
all freshmen, as Krasner properly notes.
But relative to Asian-Americans alone,
these numbers indicate that Asian-Ameri
can freshmen at Stanford today constitute
more than 340 percent of their representa
tion in 1983.
Attributing this surge to demographics
is problematic because the rise in Asian-
American enrollment at no other compara
ble school has been as dramatic, or has cor
responded in timing to Stanford.
It is also problematic to attribute the
surge in Stanford's Asian-American enroll
ment to improved racial "sensitivity train
ing" was implemented among admissions
officers. The first dramatic increase in
1986 occurred the year before "sensitivity

training." Nor can rising Asian-American
enrollment be attributed to affirmative
action preferences because Asian-Ameri
can applicants to Stanford have not
receivcxl such preferences since the 19705.
Finally, it is critical to note that recent
"white underrepresentation" at Stanford
cannot be attributed to affirmative action
preferences given to other racial minori
ties, because their enrollment, as Krasner
acknowledges, has remained relatively
constant.
After investigating all criteria for
admission, CUAFA's Subcommittee on
Asian American Admissions in 1986 con
cluded, "No factor we considered can
explain completely the discrepancy in
admission rates between Asian Americans
and whites." Holding qualifications con
stant, in every grouping of academic, non
academic and extracurricular ratings, and
for every intended major, Asian-Americans
had significantly lower admission rates
than whites.
The subcommittee concluded that
numerical caps had not been placed on
Asian-American admissions, although in
my opinion, as I stated for the record at the
time, this hypothesis was not investigated
thoroughly enough. In an April 9, 1986 let
ter to the subcommittee's chairman, I stat
ed, "My primary objection to the subcom
mittee's conclusions ... is that they fail to
resolve several key questions.... In the
