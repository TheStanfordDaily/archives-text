## Editorial on self-defense class had errors, bad arguments 
### 
Reading yesterday's editori
al, "A defenseless class," we were
appalled by its glaring inaccura
cies and poorly constructed arguments.
We think the first line sums it up: "Last
Friday's rally ..." As anyone who read
The Daily last week or happened to read
any of the numerous fliers around cam
pus knows, the rally was on Thursday.
However, this mistake is trivial com
pared to the carelessness demonstrated
in the remainder of the editorial.
The major factual error in the editori
al is the complete misrepresentation of
the affirmative action clause of Title DC.
As stated in sections 106.3(a), (b) and
106.31 of Title DC, "[Title DC] does not
prohibit affirmative action and requires
affirmative steps to overcome discrimi
nation at the institution, so that some
all-female programs and courses may be
allowed." Furthermore, "[iln some
instances, all-female courses or pro
grams may be justified when they exist
to remedy the effects of past discrimina
tion and are appropriately tailored to
justify the all-female program or course
[compensatory purpose]."
It is clear to us that the editorial
board did not do sufficient research and
does not understand the legal issues
involved or even the basis of the original
complaint.
The editorial begins by stating that
"the cause lacks constitutional legitima

cy." Not only is this not a constitutional
issue, as was explained in a Daily article
last fall, our point is that the class has
never been found to be in violation of
any law. In fact over the past months,
we have prepared, in conjunction with
lawyers, a strong legal argument that
explains how the class is in full compli
ance with Title IX.
The editorial went on to state that
"[the cause] offers no compelling reasons
for why the class should be taken for
credit." The academic rigor has never
been called into question. It has already
satisfied the University's criteria for a
credited class. The Title DC complaint
has nothing to do with the class being
offered for credit.
Next it is written the class is "incon
sistent with the University's commit
ment to a policy of open classes." The
"Statements of Nondiscriminatory Poli
cy" asserts that "[i]t is the policy of
Stanford University to comply with Title
IX of the Education Amendments of
1972 and its regulations. ..." In light of
our research and legal advice, we believe
we are not in violation of Title IX and
that the Office of Civil Rights would
agree if given the opportunity. In fact,
we believe we further the purpose of
Title IX.
The editorial also claims that "[v]ery
little about the case has changed except
that time has passed. Perhaps the class'

supporters believe that the lull after the
initial canceling of the class and an
aggressive campaign for reinstatement
will force the University to open itself to
a possible lawsuit." It is true the facts of
the case have not changed.
However, what has changed is our
understanding of Title IX and of our
options. Over the time that has passed,
we have responsibly gathered informa
tion and legal advice. Only after we
understood the situation completely did
we choose to act. It is then that we pre
pared a thorough legal brief and started
our campaign to educate the Stanford
community and build a broad base of
support. With the legal brief we pre
pared, Stanford can withstand any
future challenges.
Our argument is not just based upon
the affirmative action clause of Title IX,
as the editorial claims, but also on prior
Supreme Court rulings, which estab
lished that gender-based exclusion is
legal to compensate women for past and
existing discrimination (compensatory
purpose doctrine).
The editorial continued, "there is no
reason why the class cannot be given as
an extracurricular activity supported by
a student group." If the class violates
the law, as the editorial assumed, then
the class could not be offered anywhere
on campus or with University funding.
"For a self-defense class, anyone

wishing to loarn about self-defense is
qualified, not just women," the editorial
said. There is a coed self-defense class
as well as many martial arts classes
offered through the Department of Ath
letics. "Issues in Self-Defense for
Women" is specially designed to address
the ways in which women are attacked
and the strengths they can utilize to
defend themselves. Men would learn few
practical skills from the class but would
inhibit the learning of the female stu
dents.
Finally, the editorial stated that
reinstating the class would "set a very
dangerous precedent." The class was
offered at Stanford as a single-sex class
since 1986. We believe that the Univer
sity would be setting a very dangerous
precedent if it does not reinstate a class
which both is legal and has demon
strated its benefits to the Stanford
community. Stanford should reinstate
"Issues in Self-Defense for Women"
not only because "it cares about
women's issues," but because it
respects the law.

The editorial begins by stating that
"the cause lacks constitutional legitima

cy." Not only is this not a constitutional
issue, as was explained in a Daily article
last fall, our point is that the class has
never been found to be in violation of
any law. In fact over the past months,
we have prepared, in conjunction with
lawyers, a strong legal argument that
explains how the class is in full compli
ance with Title IX.
The editorial went on to state that
"[the cause] offers no compelling reasons
for why the class should be taken for
credit." The academic rigor has never
been called into question. It has already
satisfied the University's criteria for a
credited class. The Title DC complaint
has nothing to do with the class being
offered for credit.
Next it is written the class is "incon
sistent with the University's commit
ment to a policy of open classes." The
"Statements of Nondiscriminatory Poli
cy" asserts that "[i]t is the policy of
Stanford University to comply with Title
IX of the Education Amendments of
1972 and its regulations. ..." In light of
our research and legal advice, we believe
we are not in violation of Title IX and
that the Office of Civil Rights would
agree if given the opportunity. In fact,
we believe we further the purpose of
Title IX.
The editorial also claims that "[v]ery
little about the case has changed except
that time has passed. Perhaps the class'

supporters believe that the lull after the
initial canceling of the class and an
aggressive campaign for reinstatement
will force the University to open itself to
a possible lawsuit." It is true the facts of
the case have not changed.
However, what has changed is our
understanding of Title IX and of our
options. Over the time that has passed,
we have responsibly gathered informa
tion and legal advice. Only after we
understood the situation completely did
we choose to act. It is then that we pre
pared a thorough legal brief and started
our campaign to educate the Stanford
community and build a broad base of
support. With the legal brief we pre
pared, Stanford can withstand any
future challenges.
Our argument is not just based upon
the affirmative action clause of Title IX,
as the editorial claims, but also on prior
Supreme Court rulings, which estab
lished that gender-based exclusion is
legal to compensate women for past and
existing discrimination (compensatory
purpose doctrine).
The editorial continued, "there is no
reason why the class cannot be given as
an extracurricular activity supported by
a student group." If the class violates
the law, as the editorial assumed, then
the class could not be offered anywhere
on campus or with University funding.
"For a self-defense class, anyone

wishing to loarn about self-defense is
qualified, not just women," the editorial
said. There is a coed self-defense class
as well as many martial arts classes
offered through the Department of Ath
letics. "Issues in Self-Defense for
Women" is specially designed to address
the ways in which women are attacked
and the strengths they can utilize to
defend themselves. Men would learn few
practical skills from the class but would
inhibit the learning of the female stu
dents.
Finally, the editorial stated that
reinstating the class would "set a very
dangerous precedent." The class was
offered at Stanford as a single-sex class
since 1986. We believe that the Univer
sity would be setting a very dangerous
precedent if it does not reinstate a class
which both is legal and has demon
strated its benefits to the Stanford
community. Stanford should reinstate
"Issues in Self-Defense for Women"
not only because "it cares about
women's issues," but because it
respects the law.
