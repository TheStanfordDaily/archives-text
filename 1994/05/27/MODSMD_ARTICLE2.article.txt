Sarah Morse had to find a date to the crew formal
like the rest of the people in her boat, so when her
teammates asked her who she was bringing to the
dance, Morse replied, "I'm taking my girlfriend."
"It was great to have that as a vehicle by which I
could bring it up," she said.
Morse, a senior, is now in her fourth year as a
rower for the Cardinal. She had come out to herself
at the beginning of last year, but was only out to a
few close friends by the time of the crew formal ear
lier this year.
"I wanted to come out to them because I felt I
couldn't be myself to them," Morse said. "It's defi
nitely been a positive thing."
