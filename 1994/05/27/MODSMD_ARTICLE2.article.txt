# Homophobia on the team
## Hurdles confront gay athletes

Sarah Morse had to find a date to the crew formal
like the rest of the people in her boat, so when her
teammates asked her who she was bringing to the
dance, Morse replied, "I'm taking my girlfriend."
"It was great to have that as a vehicle by which I
could bring it up," she said.
Morse, a senior, is now in her fourth year as a
rower for the Cardinal. She had come out to herself
at the beginning of last year, but was only out to a
few close friends by the time of the crew formal ear
lier this year.
"I wanted to come out to them because I felt I
couldn't be myself to them," Morse said. "It's defi
nitely been a positive thing."
But when asked about experi
ences with their sexuality and for
mer teammates, past members of
Stanford men's athletic teams
said their experiences were not so
positive.
"I couldn't imagine coming out
when I was at school," said Brian
Marshall, a Class of '89 alumnus
and former Olympian.
After his four years as a mem
ber of the Stanford track team,
Marshall, a two-time All-Ameri
can, had come out to himself but
did not want to risk the conse
quences of what his teammates
and coach would think if he was
openly gay.
"If you think that you're not
going to be accepted in your sport,
you [can't] train," Marshall said.
"I'm lucky I guess, because I
could pass" as straight.
Michael Halaas quit the men's
crew team after two years, in part
because of the isolation he felt for

being gay. "Part of the reason I
quit was because of homophobic
attitudes," said Halaas, a 1993
graduate.
"When the people you respect
most — your coach and your
teammates — are driving you
more into the closet it's really
damaging," he said.
Halaas said he had not come
out to his teammates or to himself
during his tenure in crew, but he
still felt that many things that
were said among members of the
squad drove him further into the
closet.
And Halaas said he felt he
would not be treated the same by
his teammates if they knew he
was gay. "If I were to acknowl
edge and come out — it would
have changed my whole life," he
said.
According to Halaas, his coach
would often tell the team stories
of how he picked up women, but
would say subtle things like,
"unless you're like Johnny," a
comment which Halaas took as
homophobic.
"One of the things a group of
guys can relate to is dating —

nobody realized that it was push
ing me farther and farther away,"
Halaas said. "When you're in a
setting like that, the guilt you feel
for any homoerotic thoughts is
huge."
But Halaas said he does not
believe that his coach and team
mates were aware of what they
were doing to a fellow rower. "I
don't think it was out of hate or
intended to be vicious," Halaas
said. "It's not that the people
are aggressively homophobic,
but the overall attitude of ath
letics in general is very homo
phobic."
When Morse made the decision
that she was going to come out to
the rest of her team, she wasn't
sure how her teammates would
react. But had there been more
outreach from above, she said her
decision might have been a lot
easier.
"Since it doesn't come up
there's no temperature gauge,"
Morse said. "The Athletics
Department does nothing to bring
up stuff like this. I had to bring up
something that wasn't on their
minds."

There are no speakers bureaus
or counselors dealing with gay,
lesbian or bisexual issues within
the Athletics Department, she
said.
"There's sort of a macho atti
tude that goes along with a lot of
athletics — I think homophobia is
one of the things that goes along
with that," Halaas said. "You get
all these male-bonding moments,
so people kind of over-compensate
to prove they're not fags."
And according to Marshall,
some of the peer pressure that
comes with athletics might also
have played a part in last week's
alleged vandalism of the "Gay
Liberation" sculpture by varsity
athletes.
"There could have been a
member of the group that did this
that was gay, but he wouldn't
have said anything with the pres
sure to conform," Marshall said.
But he also believed that hate
was not the motivation behind
the incident as many have alleged.
"I don't see it as a big deal," he
said. "I see it as a prank — I don't
think it should be blown up into
this huge issue."
