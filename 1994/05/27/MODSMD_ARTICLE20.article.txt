# Gay alumnus defends Horpel's right to voice his uncensored opinion
## 
### 
The first principle of any university
must be a commitment to the free
exchange of ideas. Yet in a May 26 Daily
story regarding vandalism of the "Gay
Liberation" sculpture, Stanford
wrestling coach Chris Horpel stated,

"I'm not allowed to talk on the record.
It's not that I don't want to give you my
opinion — I can't by policy now."
As a gay man, I find this remark as
chilling as the original act of vandalism.
Presumably Horpel has been silenced,
because people don't like what he has to
say. I don't like what he has to say. I
think his remarks were anti-intellectual
and condoned homophobic bigotry.
It is, however, critical to keep some
perspective. Horpel has harassed no one.
His ideas are certainly threatening and

hurtful to some, but they must not be
censored. If the Stanford community is
to learn anything from this painful
event, ideas like those of Horpel must be
heard and confronted.
Should the administration deem his
remarks offensive, as I do, then he
should be required to say that they rep
resent his opinion and not the policies of
Stanford or the Athletics Department.
Members of the administration who
don't agree with him should be encour
aged to publicly reject his arguments.

This man has a right to defend, clarify,
or withdraw his statements about the
vandalism. By censoring Horpel, Stan
ford's administration demonstrates that
his remarks about "force-feeding politi
cal correctness" are dead right.
From what are we being protected?
There are plenty of lesbian, gay and bisexu
al people (perhaps even a few straights)
who could thrash Horpel in this argument.
Give the man rope. I jet him hang himself.
