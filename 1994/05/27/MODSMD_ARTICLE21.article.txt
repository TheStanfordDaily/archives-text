## Driving to find the end of the long college road 
### 
WASHINGTON — Life doesn't get
any better than this.
I calmly concentrated on inhaling and
exhaling the smoke of my cigarette with
out coughing up a lung. Listened intently
as my friend invented thousands of fool
proof plans to steal the Super 8 Motel
shower curtain. Bobbed my head up and
down to the kidney-bumping beats of
MTV, frolicked in the best musty-smelling
room North Platte, Nebraska has to offer
for $41.66.
I'd never planned on smoking, but my
partner in teenage rebellion said I looked
like a pro. Never planned on being in
Nebraska by choice, but the bouncy, clean
bed and its brick-hard, puffy pillows felt
just like home. Never planned to drive
cross-country, but there I was at the end
of day two of our journey, my butt well on
its way to being as flat and vast as Inter
state 80, our gracious highway.
Lord, I was born a ramblin' man.
It till started so innocently. I'm driving
across country, my friend told me two
weeks ago. You aren't taking any classes,
she added. Just think, she tempted, you

and me, like Thelma and Louise. You
have no life, and I have no driving part
ner. You get raped and I'll shoot him dead
in the parking lot.
A match made in heaven.
Naturally, I ate up the chance to tool
across country in a 1985 Oldsmobile sta
tion wagon. Licked my chops as we head
ed up 280, leaving campus and all its wor
ries behind for what I dreamed would be a
full week of stress-less bliss. Scarfed up
bag afler unfulfilling bag of Mini Chips
Alioy cookies from Food Service.
I sat in the passenger seat, hypnotized
by the verdant forests, rolling hills, deso
late mountainsides. Gripped the wheel,
lulled to sleep by the pot-holed pavement,
decrepit rest stops, wheezing campers
headed for Wisconsin.
And it was good.
Everyone told me my faithful guide
would inflict a terrible death upon me
afler a day or two of my hyperactivity.
Told me I would go crazy watching the
nuclear-winter-esque scenery of southern
Wyoming and Nebraska. Told me I would
beg my atrophied legs for mercy in a mat

ter of hours, yearning to run free like a
bloated buffalo.
But they were wrong. I loved it. Every
minute of it. I loved making a list a of
state license plates — trying to get all 52,
until my friend reminded me there were
only 50. Loved racing to the car and div
ing in its open passenger-side door as she
tried to ditch me 30 miles from Ronald
Reagan's birthplace in Illinois. Loved eat
ing watery refried beans in Lincoln,
Nebraska as we watched the fire squadron
execute flawless fire drills.
It's the little joys in life.
Yeah, so I cried when we lost our keys
at the multi-acre convenience store in Lit
tle America, Wyoming. But it was not
because I had grown weary of our blister
ing, 12-hour-per-day pace, the cat calls
from rednecks evaluating my little butt
shorts or the live Rush tape that had
become our salvation.
I was merely gripped by the fear of
spending the rest of my life eking out a
living handing over soft serve cones to fat
butted ladies with receding hairlines and
men with sweat-ringed t-shirts straining

to keep their guts from overlapping their
monogrammed belt buckles.
I'm proud to be an American.
Two weeks to go until graduation, I'm
supposed to be carving my name into a
wooden booth seat at the Oasis. Supposed
to be visiting the CPPC in a last-ditch
attempt to find a job.
Supposed to be sending out graduation
announcements, so I can open my own
Cross pens vending site. So I can dodge
the scorn of friends and relatives. So I can
avoid the annihilation of any and all hopes
to become independently wealthy via the
inheritance game.
Oops.
Before I left, I cringed in fear of gradu
ation. But after a few minutes of swap
ping family stories, sultry tides of lust and
yearning, scandal-ridden secrets and mys
terious fetishes, things seemed to clear up.
Reality patted me on the head, and I
found what I set out looking for like the
gold at the end of the rainbow in What
Cheer, lowa.
I couldn't sing. Neither could she. I
couldn't drink anything but Diet Coke in

the morning. Neither could she. I couldn't
figure out what direction the world would
be kicking me next year. Neither could she.
I couldn't understand why my Jewish
grandmother ofTered us pork chops as we
stopped for a visit in Davenport, lowa.
Neither could she.
Details, details.
I didn't need to hear all the hotels in
the greater Salt Lake City area were filled
by a women's bowling convention. Didn't
need to lie on the ground to get a picture
of my friend with the Sears Tower.
Didn't need to burn every tastebud
off my tongue after eating four packs of
Tic-Tacs, which were not labeled for
individual sale, at one sitting.
But it'll give me something to relive
in two weeks, when I'm sitting alone in a
Palo Alto apartment five minutes away
from my glory days.
Sniff, sniff.
California, here I come. Right back
where I started from.

be kicking me next year. Neither could she.
I couldn't understand why my Jewish
grandmother ofTered us pork chops as we
stopped for a visit in Davenport, lowa.
Neither could she.
Details, details.
I didn't need to hear all the hotels in
the greater Salt Lake City area were filled
by a women's bowling convention. Didn't
need to lie on the ground to get a picture
of my friend with the Sears Tower.
Didn't need to burn every tastebud
off my tongue after eating four packs of
Tic-Tacs, which were not labeled for
individual sale, at one sitting.
But it'll give me something to relive
in two weeks, when I'm sitting alone in a
Palo Alto apartment five minutes away
from my glory days.
Sniff, sniff.
California, here I come. Right back
where I started from.

WASHINGTON — Life doesn't get
any better than this.
I calmly concentrated on inhaling and
exhaling the smoke of my cigarette with
out coughing up a lung. Listened intently
as my friend invented thousands of fool
proof plans to steal the Super 8 Motel
shower curtain. Bobbed my head up and
down to the kidney-bumping beats of
MTV, frolicked in the best musty-smelling
room North Platte, Nebraska has to offer
for $41.66.
I'd never planned on smoking, but my
partner in teenage rebellion said I looked
like a pro. Never planned on being in
Nebraska by choice, but the bouncy, clean
bed and its brick-hard, puffy pillows felt
just like home. Never planned to drive
cross-country, but there I was at the end
of day two of our journey, my butt well on
its way to being as flat and vast as Inter
state 80, our gracious highway.
Lord, I was born a ramblin' man.
It till started so innocently. I'm driving
across country, my friend told me two
weeks ago. You aren't taking any classes,
she added. Just think, she tempted, you

and me, like Thelma and Louise. You
have no life, and I have no driving part
ner. You get raped and I'll shoot him dead
in the parking lot.
A match made in heaven.
Naturally, I ate up the chance to tool
across country in a 1985 Oldsmobile sta
tion wagon. Licked my chops as we head
ed up 280, leaving campus and all its wor
ries behind for what I dreamed would be a
full week of stress-less bliss. Scarfed up
bag afler unfulfilling bag of Mini Chips
Alioy cookies from Food Service.
I sat in the passenger seat, hypnotized
by the verdant forests, rolling hills, deso
late mountainsides. Gripped the wheel,
lulled to sleep by the pot-holed pavement,
decrepit rest stops, wheezing campers
headed for Wisconsin.
And it was good.
Everyone told me my faithful guide
would inflict a terrible death upon me
afler a day or two of my hyperactivity.
Told me I would go crazy watching the
nuclear-winter-esque scenery of southern
Wyoming and Nebraska. Told me I would
beg my atrophied legs for mercy in a mat

ter of hours, yearning to run free like a
bloated buffalo.
But they were wrong. I loved it. Every
minute of it. I loved making a list a of
state license plates — trying to get all 52,
until my friend reminded me there were
only 50. Loved racing to the car and div
ing in its open passenger-side door as she
tried to ditch me 30 miles from Ronald
Reagan's birthplace in Illinois. Loved eat
ing watery refried beans in Lincoln,
Nebraska as we watched the fire squadron
execute flawless fire drills.
It's the little joys in life.
Yeah, so I cried when we lost our keys
at the multi-acre convenience store in Lit
tle America, Wyoming. But it was not
because I had grown weary of our blister
ing, 12-hour-per-day pace, the cat calls
from rednecks evaluating my little butt
shorts or the live Rush tape that had
become our salvation.
I was merely gripped by the fear of
spending the rest of my life eking out a
living handing over soft serve cones to fat
butted ladies with receding hairlines and
men with sweat-ringed t-shirts straining

to keep their guts from overlapping their
monogrammed belt buckles.
I'm proud to be an American.
Two weeks to go until graduation, I'm
supposed to be carving my name into a
wooden booth seat at the Oasis. Supposed
to be visiting the CPPC in a last-ditch
attempt to find a job.
Supposed to be sending out graduation
announcements, so I can open my own
Cross pens vending site. So I can dodge
the scorn of friends and relatives. So I can
avoid the annihilation of any and all hopes
to become independently wealthy via the
inheritance game.
Oops.
Before I left, I cringed in fear of gradu
ation. But after a few minutes of swap
ping family stories, sultry tides of lust and
yearning, scandal-ridden secrets and mys
terious fetishes, things seemed to clear up.
Reality patted me on the head, and I
found what I set out looking for like the
gold at the end of the rainbow in What
Cheer, lowa.
I couldn't sing. Neither could she. I
couldn't drink anything but Diet Coke in

the morning. Neither could she. I couldn't
figure out what direction the world would
be kicking me next year. Neither could she.
I couldn't understand why my Jewish
grandmother ofTered us pork chops as we
stopped for a visit in Davenport, lowa.
Neither could she.
