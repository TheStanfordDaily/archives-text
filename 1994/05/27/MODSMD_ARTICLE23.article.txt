## Wheels across America Cyclists prepare to cross country in 2,915-mile race 
### Joseph Hei Staff writer 
This summer, four Stanford women will ride
their bicycles across the entire United States in the
Race Across America (RAAM). Starting July 31, the
team will ride 2,915 miles non-stop from Irvine,
Calif, to Savannah, Ga.
Senior Nicole Freedman, sophomore Kelley
Herndon and medical students Megan Troxell and
Cynthia Ferguson comprise Team Kaiser/Mountain
High. These four women were all members of the
Stanford Cycling Team this season, which took the
silver at both the Western Conference and National
Championships this year. The team will also
include a vital support group of eight people, rang
ing from mechanics to a masseuse.
RAAM is an extremely competitive and elite
cycling event held by the Ultra-Marathon Cycling
Federation. Team Kaiser/Mountain High is com
peting in the first year that RAAM has had a sepa
rate women's team category.
"We're up to winning it, at least to doing very
well," Freedman said.
While agreeing with Freedman, Troxell offered a
more tempered sentiment.
"If we don't win, but we ride well, we won't be
disappointed at all," Troxell said.
The team will tackle RAAM relay-fashion with
each cyclist riding daily shifts of approximately six
to eight hours. For the expected six- to eight-day
duration of the race, at least one rider will always be
pedaling.
"This is a really big challenge, not just some
thing we're doing for fun," Herndon said. "It's a
huge thing to undertake, you can't just pick up your
bikes and go. There's a lot of preparation and plan
ning."
One of the biggest hurdles that the team will
have to prepare for is the enormous distance.
"We will be riding for over 700 miles a week
each," Troxell said.
Also, there will be extreme heat and extreme
hills to contend with. The California desert and
Rocky Mountains loom right at the start of the
course.
However, these are all conditions that the riders
have had experience dealing with by racing on the
Stanford team, albeit on a smaller scale. Riding
non-stop across the country will pit Team
Kaiser/Mountain High against new and unique dif
ficulties.
"It will be really scary to deal with riding and
descending at night," Troxell said. "We'll be riding
right in front of a car, to see the road by its head
lights. So the car can't be too far behind, and this is
potentially dangerous."
The team will also have to deal with seemingly
mundane matters such as eating, sleeping and
showering during the race. To accomplish any of
these functions without stopping, the team will
have two vans and one car so that one of the vehi
cles can detour and drive into towns while the main
group keeps riding. Also, mechanical difficulties
will have to be dealt with in this way.
Putting together the vans and resources neces
sary to attempt RAAM has perhaps been a greater
challenge than any racing. At the beginning of this
