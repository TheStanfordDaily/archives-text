# Flanagan still alive in NCAA singles action

### Mike Langford Senior staff writer 
And then there were two.
After two rounds of singles and one
round of doubles, two Stanford players
remain at the NCAA tennis champi
onships for singles and doubles.
Michael Flanagan, Robert Devens
and Jeff Salzenstein were all entrants
in the singles championships, a 64-
player single-elimination tournament.
However, only one wou'.'i survive Day
One of the tournament, as each of the
three entrants lost his singles matches
in the team championship on Tuesday.
Flanagan, the No. 12 seed, defeated
Drake's Ross Nwachukwu 6-2, 6-3 on

Wednesday to advance to the round of
32. However, the unseeded sophomore

Salzenstein, drawing a
very difficult first
round opponent, lost
to sixth-seeded and
fourth-ranked Mark
Merklein of Florida, 1-
6, 6-7 (6-8).
Devens, playing the
last tennis match of
his Stanford career,
also went down, drop-

ping a 2-6, 4-6 match to No. 24-ranked
Miami's Srdjan Muskatirovic.
On Day Two of singles, Flanagan
survived. Thursday's round of 32 pit
ted the Stanford senior against No. 47-

ranked Pepperdine's Ari Nathan. But
Flanagan tamed the Wave's No. 2 sin
gles player, 6-4, 6-1.
In today's Sweet Sixteen, Flanagan
will face Mississippi State's Laurent
Orsini, who also advanced to the third
day with two straight-set wins. Orsini,
the tournament's No. 7-seeded player,
is currently ranked No. 2 in the coun
try by the ITA.
Both Merklein and Muskatirovic
also won their second-round matches.
Besides Flanagan, the only other Pac
-10 player still alive in the third round
is USC's No. 1-ranked and -seeded
Wayne Black. In a tournament full of
upsets, UCLA's No. 3-seeded Robert
Janecek lost in the second round and

Arizona State's No. 4-seeded Sargis
Sargsian lost in the first.
In doubles, Stanford won one and
lost one. The fifth-seeded team of
Flanagan and Chris Cocotos won yes
terday's first-round match against
Georgia's Jamie Laschinger and Albin
Polonyi, 7-6 (8-6), 6-3.
As the first alternates, Stanford's
team of Salzenstein and Vimal Patel
needed only one team to default from
the first round — and that's exactly
what happened when the second seed
ed team from Arizona State —
Sargsian and Peter Jeschke — bowed
out of the tournament. However,


Flanagan
Salzenstein and Patel were not
able to capitalize on their opportu
nity, losing to Arkansas' Hilpert
and partner Evan McGinn, 5-7, 3-
6.

Today, Flanagan-Cocotos will
face the winner of the match
between Florida's Merklein and
Dyllan Fitzgerald and Texas
Christian's Paul Robinson and
David Roditi.
In order to gain Ail-American
status in either singles or dou
bles, players must fulfill any one

of three necessities: if they make
it to the quarterfinals (round of
16), if they are seeded in the tour
nament, or if they appear in the
top 20 of the final ITA rankings.
By these criteria, Flanagan
and Cocotos have already earned
Ail-American honors by appear
ing as seeds.
