# Baseball to tangle with Texas at regionals
## Allen, Sullivan only out opening game of double-elimination tournament 
### Andy Eiser Senior staff writer 
After an eventful 11-day layoff,
the llth-ranked Cardinal baseball
team finally gets back to business at
hand today in Austin, Texas, where
it faces the host Texas Longhorns
in the first game of Central Region
al College World Series qualifying
action.
But even when Stanford (36-22)

takes to the field
for the first time
since clinching its
first Pacific 10
Conference
Southern Divi
sion title in four
years on May 15,
it cannot escape
the wake of
recent off-the
field turbulence.
Gone for the
duration of the
four-day, six
team, double-

elimination tournament are start
ing third baseman and leadoff hitter
Brian Dallimore, a sophomore, and
junior reserve infielder Todd Laßoc
ca, both of whom face indefinite sus
pension pending University and dis
trict attorney investigation of last
week's incident of campus vandal
ism. Freshman pitcher Brendan
Sullivan and junior first baseman
Dusty Allen, who also faced allega
tions stemming from that episode,
must also sit today, but Allen's sus
pension results only from a fighting
ejection in the seventh inning of the
Cardinal's last game.
"We have to treat it like a regular
game, but take our emotional level

to that of a big game and rise to the
moment," said senior designated
hitter Nate Olmstead.
But with a new-look lineup that
will most likely move junior left
fielder Steve Carver to first base
and insert sophomores Troy Kent
at third and Rich Crowe in left,
fourth-seeded Stanford would be
happy just to avoid the loser's
bracket.
The third-seeded Longhorns (40-

19), who boast a
34-13 home
record and won
the Southwest
Conference tour
nament at Disch-
Falk Field.
Despite finishing
fourth in the reg
ular-season
standings, the
Longhorns stand
as a formidable
challenge to the
short-handed
Cardinal squad.

"There is no easy way out in a
tough 48-team field," said assistant
coach Dave Esquer, referring to the
eight regional sites this weekend
that will send one team each to next
month's College World Series in
Omaha, Neb. "But we'll get a taste
of how tough it can be right away."
With a well-armed pitching staff
led by sophomore starter Dan Reed
(10-4, 3.38 ERA), however, Stan
ford should benefit from Disch-
Falk's artificial playing surface.
Though used to Sunken Diamond
grass, Reed and his makeshift
defense should be ready to engage
Texas junior ace Ryan Kjos (8-6,
2.76) in a low-scoring duel.

"With turf, the ball scoots in the
outfield, so you're rewarded for
good defensive speed in the outfield
and a solid infield," Esquer said.
"Home run-hitting teams don't nec
essarily benefit."
That's good news for both clubs,
as both the Cardinal's 42 homers on
the season and the Longhorns' 39
stand among the lowest power
numbers in the tournament field.

Texas sophomore outfielder Shea
Morenz and Stanford junior second
baseman Jed Hansen lead their
respective squads with eight apiece.
Win or lose, the Cardinal draws a
winner of one of today's two other
games tomorrow. Should Stanford
lasso the Longhorns at 2:30 p.m.
Pacific today, it gets the survivor of

and fifth seeded Texas-San
Antonio (39-15), both of whom
are making their first postsea
son appearance.
The 15th-ranked Wolfpack
won the Big West Conference
title, while the unranked Road
runners stormed through the
Southland Conference tourna
ment after finishing third in
the regular season. That win

ner's bracket game would make
up the second half of a double
header and start at around
5:30 p.m. tomorrow.
If the Cardinal drops today's
decision, it gets the winner of
today's first game, a match
between top-seeded Oklahoma
(42-17) and sixth-seeded
Arkansas State (37-23). The
Sooners received an at-large
bid after dropping the Big
Eight tournament champi
onship game to Oklahoma
State, while the Indians cap
tured the Sun Belt crown by
taking two-of-three from

Lamar in conference tourna
ment play. That loser's bracket
game would get underway at 2
p.m. tomorrow.
The six teams play until five
have two losses, with the
regional final scheduled for
either 11 a.m. or 5 p.m. Mon
day. For more detailed bracket

After an eventful 11-day layoff,
the llth-ranked Cardinal baseball
team finally gets back to business at
hand today in Austin, Texas, where
it faces the host Texas Longhorns
in the first game of Central Region
al College World Series qualifying
action.
But even when Stanford (36-22)

takes to the field
for the first time
since clinching its
first Pacific 10
Conference
Southern Divi
sion title in four
years on May 15,
it cannot escape
the wake of
recent off-the
field turbulence.
Gone for the
duration of the
four-day, six
team, double-

elimination tournament are start
ing third baseman and leadoff hitter
Brian Dallimore, a sophomore, and
junior reserve infielder Todd Laßoc
ca, both of whom face indefinite sus
pension pending University and dis
trict attorney investigation of last
week's incident of campus vandal
ism. Freshman pitcher Brendan
Sullivan and junior first baseman
Dusty Allen, who also faced allega
tions stemming from that episode,
must also sit today, but Allen's sus
pension results only from a fighting
ejection in the seventh inning of the
Cardinal's last game.

game, but take our emotional level

to that of a big game and rise to the
moment," said senior designated
hitter Nate Olmstead.
But with a new-look lineup that
will most likely move junior left
fielder Steve Carver to first base
and insert sophomores Troy Kent
at third and Rich Crowe in left,
fourth-seeded Stanford would be
happy just to avoid the loser's
bracket.
The third-seeded Longhorns (40-

19), who boast a
34-13 home
record and won
the Southwest
Conference tour
nament at Disch-
Falk Field.
Despite finishing
fourth in the reg
ular-season
standings, the
Longhorns stand
as a formidable
challenge to the
short-handed
Cardinal squad.

"There is no easy way out in a
tough 48-team field," said assistant
coach Dave Esquer, referring to the
eight regional sites this weekend
that will send one team each to next
month's College World Series in
Omaha, Neb. "But we'll get a taste
of how tough it can be right away."
With a well-armed pitching staff
led by sophomore starter Dan Reed
(10-4, 3.38 ERA), however, Stan
ford should benefit from Disch-
Falk's artificial playing surface.
Though used to Sunken Diamond
grass, Reed and his makeshift
defense should be ready to engage
Texas junior ace Ryan Kjos (8-6,
2.76) in a low-scoring duel.

"With turf, the ball scoots in the
outfield, so you're rewarded for
good defensive speed in the outfield
and a solid infield," Esquer said.
"Home run-hitting teams don't nec
essarily benefit."
That's good news for both clubs,
as both the Cardinal's 42 homers on
the season and the Longhorns' 39
stand among the lowest power
numbers in the tournament field.

Texas sophomore outfielder Shea
Morenz and Stanford junior second
baseman Jed Hansen lead their
respective squads with eight apiece.
Win or lose, the Cardinal draws a
winner of one of today's two other
games tomorrow. Should Stanford
lasso the Longhorns at 2:30 p.m.
Pacific today, it gets the survivor of
