# Men's crew learning on the water
## Different backgrounds come together to form devoted team 
### Heather Hardwick Staff writer 
"Most of the people here didn't
get into Stanford because they're
athletes but because they are ter
rific people. It's the people that
have kept me going," said men's
varsity crew captain Will Porte
ous.
What makes every team
unique is not only the talent and
skill it shows in the field of com
petition but the people who
devote themselves to it.
The Stanford varsity men's top
boat is no exception. Coming from
a variety of backgrounds and skill
levels, these eight individuals
have joined together in a commit
ment to a difficult and often over
looked sport here on the west
coast.
There is no typical background
for a Stanford rower. Of the top
eight, prior experience was limit
ed, and recruits were few. Several
turned to rowing during their
freshman year, as an alternative
or supplement to such sports as
track, football and skiing. More
than just an alternative however,
it's the challenge of bringing
together this mix of pure individ
uals to create a unified whole that
has kept these eight in the pro
gram.
"You have to be willing to sub
mit your ego, to know how to bal
ance. There are no superstars out
there, just a lot of solid rowers,"
said senior Martin Schwartz.
"There can be no egos, as every
one has different strengths and
weaknesses which enhance the
crew."
The sport demands total com
mitment, and from that devotion
there are many lessons to be
learned about dependence and
interaction. The experience

gained is certainly invaluable, and
goes far beyond the years spent
on the water.

'Crew is working
together. It has this
added dimension,
unlike any other ath
letic team at Stan
ford, the crew is
something we create
to a large extent as
students.'

"I know how to push myself,
I've learned a lot about long term
goals mid keeping the faith," said
senior Chris Fleischner. "I can
take anything, as crew definitely
prepares you for the worst. I have
some friends in investment bank
ing and they say it's easier than
rowing."
The seeming torture of rowing
has bonded these eight men in a
remarkable way. To keep them
selves going there has to be the
element of pleasure, and each is
drawn to crew for their own indi
vidual reasons.
Schwartz disclosed that during
his sophomore year he faced diffi
culties in consistency and had
doubts about his participation in
crew, but upon consideration, he
felt compelled to continue.
"I realized I loved being out
there, just rowing on the water.
It's a very sensual experience —
you see, you feel . . . when you

feel the 'swing', the boat just flies
and you don't even know what
you're doing. It's a mental rush,"
Schwartz said.
Crew has been such a signifi
cant part of the senior's life that
he's decided to move to Boston
after college and pursue his train
ing in the hopes of gaining a spot
on the Olympic team.
Fleischner also focuses on the
notion of the "swing."
"It's the feeling of eight people
moving as one, that the whole is
greater than the sum of the
parts," he said. "It's as if you're
unleashing this monster and it's
taking off — I row for those few
moments."
As the captain of the squad,
Will Porteous has a wealth of
responsibilities. He is in charge of
the administrative and financial
duties and is also called upon to
be the emotional leader of the
team. To him, crew is unique not
so much because of the indescrib
able feelings it generates but
because of the cooperation it fos
ters.
"Crew is working together. It
has this added dimension, unlike
any other athletic team at Stan
ford, the crew is something we
create to a large extent as stu
dents," Porteous said. "It's more
than just following in the foot
steps, it has given me a real loyal
ty to it. We don't get a lot of stuff
handed to us."
Such toil only serves to bring
the team closer together, howev
er, he added. "What makes a team
is the spirit of the individual and a
commitment to each other, and
no amount of money, financing,
or tradition will take the place of
that spirit."
The Stanford rowing program

Despite early mornings and torturous practices, the men's crew has become a tight-knit group. Over
coming lack of exposure and experience, the rowers have developed an intense devotion to the sport.
can be distinguished from any
other athletic program in that
the rowers are pushed to fend for
themselves. This breeds a fierce
loyalty among the members of
the crew and its alumni, as
described by Porteous, the crew
becomes a family.
Stanford crew faces many
other obstacles as well, Fleischn
er added. "Unlike other schools,
academics take first priority, so
we don't have the same consis
tency."
This focus in academics is
reflected in the varied intellectu
al ambitions and pursuits of the
crew, which are as diverse as
their backgrounds. This year's
top boat will lose six seniors to
graduation, sending them in all
directions.
Next year will find rower Dar
ren Rice in law school in south
ern California, Porteous will be
working in Washington out of the
U.S. Supreme Court, and the
coxswain, Mae Tai will be testing
her international relations skills
in Japan. Fleischner keeps his
post-graduation plans a bit sim
pler, saying, "I'm just looking
forward to sleeping in, actually."
However, no matter what

their future plans may hold, crew
has definitely been an integral
part of each of these individual's
Stanford experience. Porteous
expressed this sentiment clearly.
"I want the Stanford crew and
program to go as fast and as far
as we can. I'm almost not looking
much beyond this season and
year, as these days are passing
quickly enough," he said.
With those six seniors depart
ing, the future of Stanford men's
crew is uncertain. However, the
younger teams have shown much
potential throughout the course
of this season. Schwartz is opti
mistic that Stanford crew will
continue to be a force in the
future.
"Next year will definitely not
be a rebuilding year. This year's
boat is technique- and finesse
oriented, whereas the freshman
are huge. They will be a power
crew, each year is different," he
said.
Barrett Adams, the only
returning varsity sophomore, will
accompany the only junior, Josh
Burgel, in leading next year's
young team.
"It's going to be a challenge
but I'm looking forward to it,"
Adams said. "With the process of
rebuilding there are less expecta
tions, whatever you do is some
thing. You prove yourselves for
who you are not what you're built

up to be."
Although he looks to the
future with excitement, he also
laments the loss of the seniors.
"They're the friendliest group of
guys you're ever going to meet.
I'm going to miss them a lot,
that's for sure. You just can't
replace each one of their personal
ities."
That brings us back to the peo
ple. Individuals are often over
looked in this sport defined by
crews and boats. However, it is
just that sense of the individual
within the whole that makes row
ing so special. Not all of the expec
tations for this season have been
met, but as Schwartz explains,
results aren't everything.
"Winning races is fine but the
whole process of getting there is
what I value most. A race I'm
proud of — that's a success," he
said.
Thus it is clear at least to the
seniors why they awaken early
every morning and push their
bodies to the limit. To them, row
ing is no longer merely an alter
native sport, but a full devotion.
What they will take away from
this experience has made all of
the effort put into it worthwhile.
"These guys aren't rowing
because they're masochistic or
crazy but because they love a very
beautiful sport, and they love to
compete," Porteous reflected.
"Most of the people here didn't
get into Stanford because they're
athletes but because they are ter

crew, each year is different," he
said.
Barrett Adams, the only
returning varsity sophomore, will
accompany the only junior, Josh
Burgel, in leading next year's
young team.
"It's going to be a challenge
but I'm looking forward to it,"
Adams said. "With the process of
rebuilding there are less expecta
tions, whatever you do is some
thing. You prove yourselves for
who you are not what you're built

up to be."
Although he looks to the
future with excitement, he also
laments the loss of the seniors.
"They're the friendliest group of
guys you're ever going to meet.
I'm going to miss them a lot,
that's for sure. You just can't
replace each one of their personal
ities."
That brings us back to the peo
ple. Individuals are often over
looked in this sport defined by
crews and boats. However, it is
just that sense of the individual
within the whole that makes row
ing so special. Not all of the expec
tations for this season have been
met, but as Schwartz explains,
results aren't everything.
"Winning races is fine but the
whole process of getting there is
what I value most. A race I'm
proud of — that's a success," he
said.
Thus it is clear at least to the
seniors why they awaken early
every morning and push their
bodies to the limit. To them, row
ing is no longer merely an alter
native sport, but a full devotion.
What they will take away from
this experience has made all of
the effort put into it worthwhile.
"These guys aren't rowing
because they're masochistic or
crazy but because they love a very
beautiful sport, and they love to
compete," Porteous reflected.
"Most of the people here didn't
get into Stanford because they're
athletes but because they are ter
rific people. It's the people that
have kept me going," said men's
varsity crew captain Will Porte
ous.
What makes every team
unique is not only the talent and
skill it shows in the field of com
petition but the people who
devote themselves to it.
The Stanford varsity men's top
boat is no exception. Coming from
a variety of backgrounds and skill
levels, these eight individuals
have joined together in a commit
ment to a difficult and often over
looked sport here on the west
coast.
There is no typical background
for a Stanford rower. Of the top
eight, prior experience was limit
ed, and recruits were few. Several
turned to rowing during their
freshman year, as an alternative
or supplement to such sports as
track, football and skiing. More
than just an alternative however,
it's the challenge of bringing
together this mix of pure individ
uals to create a unified whole that
has kept these eight in the pro
gram.
"You have to be willing to sub
mit your ego, to know how to bal
ance. There are no superstars out
there, just a lot of solid rowers,"
said senior Martin Schwartz.
"There can be no egos, as every
one has different strengths and
weaknesses which enhance the
crew."
The sport demands total com
mitment, and from that devotion
there are many lessons to be
learned about dependence and
interaction. The experience

gained is certainly invaluable, and
goes far beyond the years spent
on the water.

'Crew is working
together. It has this
added dimension,
unlike any other ath
letic team at Stan
ford, the crew is
something we create
to a large extent as
students.'

— Will Porteous

"I know how to push myself,
I've learned a lot about long term
goals mid keeping the faith," said
senior Chris Fleischner. "I can
take anything, as crew definitely
prepares you for the worst. I have
some friends in investment bank
ing and they say it's easier than
rowing."
The seeming torture of rowing
has bonded these eight men in a
remarkable way. To keep them
selves going there has to be the
element of pleasure, and each is
drawn to crew for their own indi
vidual reasons.
Schwartz disclosed that during
his sophomore year he faced diffi
culties in consistency and had
doubts about his participation in
crew, but upon consideration, he
felt compelled to continue.
"I realized I loved being out
there, just rowing on the water.
It's a very sensual experience —
you see, you feel . . . when you

feel the 'swing', the boat just flies
and you don't even know what
you're doing. It's a mental rush,"
Schwartz said.
Crew has been such a signifi
cant part of the senior's life that
he's decided to move to Boston
after college and pursue his train
ing in the hopes of gaining a spot
on the Olympic team.
Fleischner also focuses on the
notion of the "swing."
"It's the feeling of eight people
moving as one, that the whole is
greater than the sum of the
parts," he said. "It's as if you're
unleashing this monster and it's
taking off — I row for those few
moments."
As the captain of the squad,
Will Porteous has a wealth of
responsibilities. He is in charge of
the administrative and financial
duties and is also called upon to
be the emotional leader of the
team. To him, crew is unique not
so much because of the indescrib
able feelings it generates but
because of the cooperation it fos
ters.
"Crew is working together. It
has this added dimension, unlike
any other athletic team at Stan
ford, the crew is something we
create to a large extent as stu
dents," Porteous said. "It's more
than just following in the foot
steps, it has given me a real loyal
ty to it. We don't get a lot of stuff
handed to us."
Such toil only serves to bring
the team closer together, howev
er, he added. "What makes a team
is the spirit of the individual and a
commitment to each other, and
no amount of money, financing,
or tradition will take the place of
that spirit."
The Stanford rowing program

can be distinguished from any
other athletic program in that
the rowers are pushed to fend for
themselves. This breeds a fierce
loyalty among the members of
the crew and its alumni, as
described by Porteous, the crew
becomes a family.
Stanford crew faces many
other obstacles as well, Fleischn
er added. "Unlike other schools,
academics take first priority, so
we don't have the same consis
tency."
This focus in academics is
reflected in the varied intellectu
al ambitions and pursuits of the
crew, which are as diverse as
their backgrounds. This year's
top boat will lose six seniors to
graduation, sending them in all
directions.
Next year will find rower Dar
ren Rice in law school in south
ern California, Porteous will be
working in Washington out of the
U.S. Supreme Court, and the
coxswain, Mae Tai will be testing
her international relations skills
in Japan. Fleischner keeps his
post-graduation plans a bit sim
pler, saying, "I'm just looking
forward to sleeping in, actually."
However, no matter what

their future plans may hold, crew
has definitely been an integral
part of each of these individual's
Stanford experience. Porteous
expressed this sentiment clearly.
"I want the Stanford crew and
program to go as fast and as far
as we can. I'm almost not looking
much beyond this season and
year, as these days are passing
quickly enough," he said.
With those six seniors depart
ing, the future of Stanford men's
crew is uncertain. However, the
younger teams have shown much
potential throughout the course
of this season. Schwartz is opti
mistic that Stanford crew will
continue to be a force in the
future.
