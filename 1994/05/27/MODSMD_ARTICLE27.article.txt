# Men's ultimate heads to nationals
## Top-ranked squad journeys to Baton Rouge with high spirits 
### Vanessa Hua Staff writer 
The men's ultimate frisbee
team is off to Baton Rouge, La.
for adventure, partying and the
National Tournament.
"We're laughing a lot more,
now that we're going to Nation
als. The atmosphere in practice
is more upbeat," senior Jorah
Wyer said.
The three-day competition at
Louisiana State University,
held May 28-30, fields the 12
best men's teams from around
the country. Each of the five
regions — West, Central,
North, East and Mid-Atlantic —
sends two teams, while the best
two regions get to send to a
third. Stanford, UC-Santa Bar
bara and Las Positas College
represent the Western region,
the toughest in the country this
year. And Stanford's ultimate
team, the top-ranked in the
nation, has high expectations.
"Being in the West, you have
to live up to something. That
kind of tradition and heritage
gives us a goal," said team
member Chris Davies, a first
year law student.
"We're going in as the first
seed. It's a real advantage to be
considered the best," team co

captain Brian Cameros said.
The first two days of the
tournament feature pool play,
with two pools of six teams.
After five games, the top two
teams in each pool advance to
the quarterfinals.
Stanford's team hopes to
make it through to finals, which
will be held Monday, and cap
ture top honors there.
"I made Nationals before,
when I was an undergrad at
Wesleyan," Davies said. "It's a
very different feeling to be on a
team that has a chance to go all
the way."
Davies' teammates echo his
sentiments. Wyer, a four-year
veteran of the team, has never
been to Nationals.
"I'm happy. Last year I sat
on the sidelines at Regionals.
Over the summer, I worked
really hard to improve my
game. It means a lot to me that
we're going to Nationals," Wyer
said.
Stanford's toughest compe
tition is from East Carolina
University, which has the top
two players in the country.
"Hopefully, we'll meet them
in finals," Cameros said.
The team has been concen
trating on strategy in practice.
"A lot of teams in the East have

just a few stars. Zone defense
neutralizes them, shows the big
deficiencies in a team,"
Cameros said. "Our team has a
lot depth."
"Whoever wins is whoever
survives," Wyer said. "They'll
either cramp or puke. They'll be
ineffective."
The team is also using some
rather non-traditional strate
gies, or good luck charms.
"We're going to stay in
Howard Johnson's, and eat a lot
of Powerbars," Cameros said.
"On the second day, maybe
I'll wear a skirt. It's ugly and
polyester, lime green and rasp
berry," Wyer said, noting the
sport's unique way of display
ing a player's prowess. "I found
it in a dump."
The men's ultimate team has
not lost the energy that was
instrumental in its crushing
victories throughout the sea
son, and they bring that energy
with them to this weekend's
competition.
"At Nationals, everyone is
fighting for every point and
we're not going to assume any
thing," Cameros said. "It's sat
isfying to me that we even got
to Nationals. But when I get
there, I'm sure I'm going to
want to win all."
