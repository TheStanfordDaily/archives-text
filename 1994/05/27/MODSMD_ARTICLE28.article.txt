# For the record
## 
### 
The women's sailing team will
only sail in the 420s race in the
national sailing championships,
and will not take part in the Fly
ing Juniors as reported in yester
day's Daily. Participation in the
national championships is not
related to final team rankings
but is determined by qualifica
tion. Also, the sailors in the
photo were incorrectly identified;
they are senior Rolf Kaiser and
sophomore Catherine Adams-
Simmons.
