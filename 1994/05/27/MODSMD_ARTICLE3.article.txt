Three Stanford undergraduates have received pres
tigious Harry S. Truman Scholarships and a Winston
Churchill Scholarship which will help pay for their
graduate-school expenses.
Juniors Amanda Merryman and Michael Zwibel
man each earned a Truman Scholarship for achieve
ments in public service, and senior Edmund Yeh was
selected for the Churchill Scholarship for accomplish
ments in mathematics, engineering and sciences.
The Truman Scholarship recognizes recipients'
leadership qualities, volunteer service and political ac
tivities. The Churchill Scholarship is based on GRE
scores, academic record, research experience and a per
sonal statement.
