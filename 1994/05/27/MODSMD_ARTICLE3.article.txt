### Diane Chen Staff writer 
Three Stanford undergraduates have received pres
tigious Harry S. Truman Scholarships and a Winston
Churchill Scholarship which will help pay for their
graduate-school expenses.
Juniors Amanda Merryman and Michael Zwibel
man each earned a Truman Scholarship for achieve
ments in public service, and senior Edmund Yeh was
selected for the Churchill Scholarship for accomplish
ments in mathematics, engineering and sciences.
The Truman Scholarship recognizes recipients'
leadership qualities, volunteer service and political ac
tivities. The Churchill Scholarship is based on GRE
scores, academic record, research experience and a per
sonal statement.
Merryman, an economics
major from Cedar Rapids, lowa,
called the application process
"rigorous" and said that the
scholarship foundation was
"grilling you with interviews."
With her scholarship money, she
plans to pursue a doctorate in eco
nomics and then work in health
policy analysis.
Merryman has held internships
with the Office of Management and
Budget and the office of Sen. Tom
Harkin. At Stanford in Washington
during fall quarter, she worked
with the Health Policy Task Force
at the White House, she said.
"My experience in Washington
is something that caught [the schol
arship foundation's] eye," Merry
man said.
Last year, Merryman also acted
as assistant director of the Sacra
mento Stanford-in-Government
fellowship program. She currently
is an Upward Bound tutor and
works with the ASSU Speakers
Bureau.
Zwibelman, a public policy major
from St. Louis, Mo., is interested in
working "in local government, on
urban issues such as housing and
poverty," he said. With his scholar
ship money, he plans to pursue a
joint graduate degree in public poli
cy and law.
Zwibelman has held internships
in the office of Congressman
Richard A. Gephardt on Capitol
Hill and in the U.S. General
Accounting Office. During fall
quarter, he worked in the Office of
Management and Budget while a
student at Stanford in Washington.
The scholarship committee was
looking for "evidence that I'm going
into the public sector," he said.
During the 1992 presidential

campaign, Zwibelman served as
chairperson for the Stanford
Democrats. He also volunteered as
a coach for a Palo Alto little-league
team.
He received notification of his
scholarship by phone over spring
break. "My family was there when I
received the phone call, and they
were jumping up and down behind
me," he said.
The Harry S. Truman Scholar
ship program was created by
Congress and looks for "a firm com
mitment to a career in public ser
vice," according to Political Science
Prof. Hubert Marshall.
A panel of three Stanford profes
sors selects the top Stanford appli
cants to continue in the national
competition, Marshall said. Out of
1,300 nominees nationally, only 80
students eventually receive the
$30,000 award.
In the past 10 years, 21 out of 29
Stanford nominees have won Tru
man scholarships, he said.
"If we go back to year one, I
think we've got the best record in
the nation," Marshall added.
Yeh, a senior majoring in electri
cal engineering, received a $20,000
scholarship which will fund a one
year fellowship at Cambridge Uni
versity in England. He will do
research with a graduate adviser in
the field of image processing, he
said.
After his fellowship, Yeh will
attend MIT to pursue a doctorate in
a field related to electrical engineer
ing.
Yeh has interned at Hughes Air
craft Company in Los Angeles and
at AT&T Bell Laboratories in New
Jersey, doing research in image
processing.
The Churchill Scholarship,
funded by the Winston Churchill
Foundation in New York, is award
ed annually to 10 American stu
dents to study science and engi
neering in England.
