This year, Undergraduate Research Oppor
tunities has awarded a record number of stu
dents with major grants for research in
humanities, engineering, and social and natu
ral sciences.
Out of the 236 students who submitted
research proposals, 148 were awarded up to
$2,500 for research toward an honors thesis in
their chosen field, said Laura Selznick, direc
tor of the grant program.
Selznick said the number of major grants
awarded has steadily increased from 55, when
the program began in 1985, to this year's
total. Last year, 128 grants were awarded.
She attributes this year's high number of

grants to students' increased awareness of the
grants' availability and the faculty's encour
agement of work in honors programs.
"There were more applications [this year]
and the quality was terrific," Selznick added.
To apply for a grant, students submit pro
posals which are evaluated first by the faculty
in their department and then by an interdisci
plinary faculty panel.
Panel member A 1 Camarillo, associate dean
in the School of Humanities and Sciences, said
that the quality of the research design has
been outstanding in the two years he has been
involved with the program.
"I'm impressed with the depth of the stu
dents' interest and their depth of commit
ment," he said. "It speaks well for the under
graduate research at Stanford."

Selznick said she believes the research
grants are a very important part of under
graduate education at Stanford.
They help "undergraduates to personalize
their education and to study something that
they can take ownership of instead of just tak
ing classes," she said. "To have to figure
things out and meet intellectual challenges
prepares them for the real world."
On Sunday, major grant award winner,
junior Jeffrey Johnson, flies to Ecuador where
he will spend four months researching "Vol
canic Stratification in the Ecuadorian Andes."
He said he likes the ability to design his
own project and was relieved to receive the
funding. "I'm pretty excited. I wouldn't have
been able to do the research without having
access to the grant," he said.
