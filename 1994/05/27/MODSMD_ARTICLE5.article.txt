# Fac Sen delays vote on grading changes
## Debate to continue at next week's meeting 
### Colleen Krueger Staff writer 
Although yesterday's Faculty Senate
meeting was filled with students, reporters
and an astounding turnout of senators an
ticipating the grand finale of Stanford's
grading-policy struggle, many left disap
pointed.
Due to time constraints, no vote was
called on the proposed grading-policy
changes. The vote was postponed until next
Thursday's senate meeting.
Instead, the senate continued to debate
both the motives behind the policy and the
specific changes proposed.
But the discussion took a slightly differ
ent turn yesterday, dominated by issues
like faculty irresponsibility and their "mis
conceptions" about student abuse of the
current system.

Part of a report researched and written
by the senate Committee on Academic Ap
praisal and Achievement, the much-publi
cized changes will tighten the present grad
ing system considerably, moving up the
deadline to drop classes, limiting retakes of
courses and reinstating a failing grade.
The faculty body made it through only
three of the proposed policy's 12 points,
with English Prof. Ron Rebholz suggesting
changes for each point. His amendments
were taken from an alternative proposal au
thored by junior David Cohen and infor
mally endorsed by the Council of Presi
dents.
As a result of his amendments, the policy
now states that courses can only be added
up to the end of the third week of classes, as
opposed to the fourth-week deadline previ-
ously included in the plan.
Two other Cohen-plan pro
posals failed — amendments
which would have moved the
drop deadline from the fourth to
the seventh week of the quarter
and would have adjusted the
deadline after which a "W" (for
"withdraw") notation would
appear.
Although both Senate Chair
Pat Jones and committee chair
Gail Mahood acknowledged that
they have heard "loud and clear"
from a large number of students
through phone calls, meetings
and electronic mail, both
stressed that the decision ulti
mately rests in the faculty's
hands.
"If we do not entirely heed
your advice it is not because we

didn't listen," said Mahood, a
geology professor. "As faculty
members, we keep in mind the
larger perspective of University
goals . . . not merely student
preferences."
Mahood went on to say that
she did not feel the student pro
posals met the standards set
forth by the committee or solved
any of the current grading sys
tem's "real problems."
The issue of faculty account
ability was first taken up by
Political Science Prof. David
Abernethy, who said he worried
that the plan contained nothing
about "faculty irresponsibility,"
which can account for students
having no indication in a given
course of the work involved or
how well they will do until near
ly the end of the quarter.
A number of senators followed
up on Abernethy's question —
among them English and Lin
guistics Prof. Elizabeth Traugott

who asked Mahood how the sen
ate can "be sure that the faculty
will indeed behave in such a
manner so as to ensure that stu
dents will not be in jeopardy?"
"We cannot guarantee that,"
Mahood said, adding that she
hopes students will exert their
rights and alert individual deans
and schools about irresponsible
teachers.
Discussing the drop deadline,
she said the common complaint
— especially among students in
the social sciences — that they
do not receive a graded test or
paper until far after the new
drop deadline is not a valid objec
tion.
"We don't want students
making drop decisions based on
what their grades will be,"
Mahood said.
But several ex-officio student
members of the senate ques
tioned the basis of Mahood's
assertion, saying that tests and

papers mean more than grades
to students.
"Evaluation is an integral
part of the classroom experi
ence," said graduate student
Derek Miyahara, "What is the
educational value of interacting
with a professor through evalua
tion? It seems to me quite high.
That's where a great deal of the
learning comes from."
COP member Anietie Ekanem
agreed that evaluation has been
an essential part of his educa
tion, but questioned the charac
terizations of Stanford students
he felt was reflected in much of
the senate's discussion.
"I'm surprised and saddened
by the conception here of stu
dents as cold-hearted . . . and
grade-grubbing," Ekanem said.
"All students have gotten here
because they do have academic
responsibility — they don't lose
it when they drive up Palm
Drive."
