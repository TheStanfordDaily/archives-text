# The 						bottom line: Rice unveils $1.28 budget
## 
### Andy Dworkin Senior staff writer 
Provost Condoleezza Rice presented
Stanford's billion-dollar, 1994-95 budget to
the Faculty Senate yesterday, stressing a fu
ture of tight financial times and the compre
hensive nature of the budget.
The budget plans for $ 1.287 billion in rev
enues and $1.27 billion in expenses next
year. Over half the money spent will go to
academic areas, and about 46 percent will go
to paying faculty and staff salaries and bene
fits.
The document also includes $6 million
worth of budget cuts Stanford made this
year — $1 million taken from academic areas
and $5 million sliced from administrative de
partments.
The academic cuts were made by holding
non-salary expenses at low levels and replac
ing outgoing full professors with assistant
professors.

For the first time, the budget also includ
ed some extra money — over $700 million.
The costs and income existed in years past,
but were never listed. However, this year the
University prepared a consolidated budget, a
document that lists all revenue and expenses
including both restricted and unrestricted
monies and capital expenditures. In previous
years only an operating budget comprised
largely of unrestricted funds was presented.
Rice said the consolidated budget "gives
us a chance, I think for the first time in the
University," to appreciate all the financial
commitments made for the next year at a
glance, and thus make more informed deci
sions.
"The ability to budget and understand
where costs are coming from . . . cannot rest
on an analysis of 40 percent of the school's
resources," Rice said, referring to the old for
mat of the budget.
The consolidated statement
"was built by the schools from
the bottom up," as well as other
areas, and represents the hard
work of many people, Rice said.
Rice also outlined the tight
budgetary times facing Stan

ford for the next few years. The
$6 million cut this year, she
said, will need to be followed by
$12 million in cuts over the next
two years. Those cuts will have
to come largely from restructur
ing the ways areas of the Uni
versity conduct their business,
especially administrative areas.
In addition, Rice said she has
committed to holding future
spending increases to no more

than 1 percent above the rate of
inflation. Because of this, she
said, "we have a challenge
before us."
Both the unrestricted por
tions of Stanford's budget and
growth in research, she said,
are under "considerable pres
sure."
This year, Rice said, people
worked hard to hold down
spending. There was an effort

to keep salaries competitive,
and faculty salaries will rise an
average of 3.5 percent next year
while staff salaries will increase
an average 2.5 percent. But
budget planners went line-by
line through other areas and
tried to keep costs as low as pos
sible, not necessarily assuming
costs had to rise by the same
amount as inflation.
Rice said the overall philoso

phy of the budgeting process
has changed so that in the
future the University's expendi
tures will be dictated by its
income — a process sometimes
called "revenue-driven" budget
ing.
University President Ger
hard Casper "hates this word,"
Rice said to laughter. "He says
it makes us sound like spend
thrifts. So now we call it rev

enue-constrained."
In short, she said, "we will
operate under budget con
straints for some time."
"We're not cutting the bud
get because we like cutting bud
gets. We're also not doing this
because we like having a zero
bottom line," Rice said. "The
fact is that what we want to do
is increase our budget flexibility
to invest in future progress."
