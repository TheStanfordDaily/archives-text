# The
						bottom line: Rice unveils $1.28 budget
## 
### Andy Dworkin Senior staff writer 
Provost Condoleezza Rice presented
Stanford's billion-dollar, 1994-95 budget to
the Faculty Senate yesterday, stressing a fu
ture of tight financial times and the compre
hensive nature of the budget.
The budget plans for $ 1.287 billion in rev
enues and $1.27 billion in expenses next
year. Over half the money spent will go to
academic areas, and about 46 percent will go
to paying faculty and staff salaries and bene
fits.
The document also includes $6 million
worth of budget cuts Stanford made this
year — $1 million taken from academic areas
and $5 million sliced from administrative de
partments.
The academic cuts were made by holding
non-salary expenses at low levels and replac
ing outgoing full professors with assistant
professors.

For the first time, the budget also includ
ed some extra money — over $700 million.
The costs and income existed in years past,
but were never listed. However, this year the
University prepared a consolidated budget, a
document that lists all revenue and expenses
including both restricted and unrestricted
monies and capital expenditures. In previous
years only an operating budget comprised
largely of unrestricted funds was presented.
Rice said the consolidated budget "gives
us a chance, I think for the first time in the
University," to appreciate all the financial
commitments made for the next year at a
glance, and thus make more informed deci
sions.
"The ability to budget and understand
where costs are coming from . . . cannot rest
on an analysis of 40 percent of the school's
resources," Rice said, referring to the old for
mat of the budget.
