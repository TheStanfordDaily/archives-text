# For minorities, J.D.s and MB As, but few Ph.D.s
## University struggles to diversify its doctoral programs, meet UCMI goals 
### Beth Berselli Staff writer 
Alma Medina was determined to get
a Ph.D. in Spanish. So, how did she end
up in law school?
"I decided to go to law school be
cause it's much more flexible," she
said. "You can do anything with a law
degree. You can teach, you can go into
politics, you can get involved in the
community. Plus, it takes less time to
get a law degree than to get a Ph.D."

Medina's is not a rare case. A recent
report by the Provost's Committee on
the Recruitment, Retention and Grad
uation of Minority Graduate Students
found that Stanford's professional
schools are doing well in the recruit
ment of minority students, but its doc
toral programs are falling behind.
"Our main concern now is to in
crease the number of Ph.D. students,"
said Assoc. Dean of Graduate Policy
George Dekker, who chaired the com
mittee that produced the report.

Although some schools — such as
Engineering and Law — have made sig
nificant improvements, overall Stan
ford has fallen short of a goal set by the
1989 University Committee on Minori
ty Issues of doubling the number of mi
nority graduate students by this year.
Not enough Ph.D.s
What accounts for the low number
of minorities in doctoral programs? Fi
nancial security is a big factor in deter

mining what kind of program a student
attends, students and administrators
say.
"If your general level of education
and income is below the majority, then
you might be inclined to go into profes
sions that have more financial security
and status in the community," Dekker
said.
"Being a doctor or lawyer is consid
ered a more traditional money-making
field," said Jackie Olvera, a doctoral
student in sociology who served on
Dekker's committee. "People
haven't traditionally looked at
Ph.D. programs as a way to advance
yourself and your family. Let's face
it, there's not a whole lot of money
to be made as a professor."
Another factor contributing to
this trend is that the "rites of pas
sage" are much clearer for students
in professional schools, said Noe
Lozano, the associate dean for stu
dents and minority programs in the
School of Engineering.
"There is a set period of time
you're in school. If you go to law
school, you'll be done in three years.
Compare this to a Ph.D. program
where it can take anywhere from
three to nine years to get your
degree."
Another factor that might deter
some students from entering doc
toral programs is a very high drop
out rate. "Nationwide, there's
something like a 50 percent drop
out rate for Ph.D. programs,"

Lozano said, adding that in profes
sional schools the rate is "in the sin
gle digits."
'Just apply CPR'
Lozano has the perfect solution
for increasing the recruitment,
retention and graduation of minori
ty graduate students. "Just apply
CPR," he says.
By 'CPR,' he isn't referring to
the life-saving rescue technique, but
to his personal philosophy of "com
mitment, planning and resources"
that has transformed the School of
Engineering into the University's
most successful program in terms of
recruitment, retention and gradua
tion of minority graduate students.
The school has doubled the num
ber of enrolled minority doctoral
students in the last six years.
According to Lozano, there were 16
minority students in 1988; there are
now 40. Next fall, the school will
enroll 71 new minority graduate
students — the highest number in
the school's history and also
throughout the nation. "Stanford
ranks first nationally in all cate
gories of engineering," Dekker said.
The school's success is the result
of a commitment to increasing the

number of targeted minority gradu
ate students, and the careful plan
ning and allocation of resources to
achieve the goal.
"The dean's office has shown
their commitment to this goal by
funding fellowships and assis
tantships for minority students,"
Lozano said.
The School of Engineering will
"fund every targeted minority
that's admissible," Lozano said. The
school will also fund up to an addi
tional five quarters of study if a
minority student is "Ph. D.-bound,"
he said.
This is not normal University
practice. Dekker said Stanford does
not have a policy of offering special
deals for minority students. "By and
large Stanford tries to keep the
financial aid packages equitable," he
said.
As part of its planning effort, the
school has worked to establish a
"pipeline" in recent years. By expos
ing pre-college and college students
to the field of engineering, Lozano
hopes to convince more people to
apply to graduate school.
The school hosts several summer
programs for elementary school stu
dents as a way of encouraging their

interest, and engineering students
tutor in local schools throughout
the year, Lozano said.
The school also carefully plans its
recruiting efforts such as its Gradu
ate Minority Admit Weekend. It has
key faculty members personally
contact accepted applicants and
helps students obtain additional
outside funding.
A different experience
The School of Engineering recog
nizes that the experiences of minor
ity students are different than those
of non-minority students and has
taken steps to address this concern,
Lozano said.
In an effort to "create an envi
ronment of support," the school
offers a seminar fall quarter focused
on minority concerns. "We're play
ing catch-up and we can't afford to
lose minority students to the nor
mal vigor of graduate study," he
said. "
But graduate students in other
schools don't always benefit from
the kind of supportive environment
the School of Engineering tries to
foster.
"The general climate at Stanford
is not as good or as hospitable for

minority students as it is for other
students," said Lori White, a doctor
al student in the School of Educa
tion who served on Dekker's com
mittee.
"It's subtle little things like when
someone looks at you and wonders
if you're here on some sort of special
program, or you can't find someone
to sponsor your research on minori
ty issues because it's not considered
a study of academic inquiry. It's
those kinds of things that make it
more difficult," she said.
Rod Hernandez, a doctoral stu
dent in English, said that he has
encountered difficulties in his study
of Chicano literature. "One of the
problems I face is that my particular
field is not taken seriously," he said.
"There are enough individuals who
have expressed that sentiment
through either insinuation or other
kinds of indirect language that has
caused doubt about my position in
my field or department," he
explained. "You have to justify what
you're doing."
Student and faculty expectations
for minorities are often lower,
Olvera said. "In general there's the
feeling that minority students get
special breaks," she said. "For me,

that just means that you have to
work a little harder to downgrade
those sort of attitudes."
She added that being one of only
three Chicano graduate students in
her department can lead to feelings
of isolation, as does a lack of role
models. "It would be nice to have
someone who has the same perspec
tive," Olvera said, noting that there
are only 16 Chicano professors at
Stanford, and none in the Sociology
Department.
Minority faculty members are
helpful because "they've probably
been in the same position as the
only minority in the department.
They can really help you learn the
ropes," she said. "Hiring additional
minority faculty would attract
more minority graduate students. I
urge the president and provost to
carefully consider Dekker's
report."
The report — which was submit
ted to the provost late last month —
recommended that "the president
and provost to continue their com
mitment to recruiting and retaining
minority faculty members," Dekker
said. It also called for the School of
Humanities and Sciences to aug
ment its recruiting staff.

minority faculty would attract
more minority graduate students. I
urge the president and provost to
carefully consider Dekker's
report."
The report — which was submit
ted to the provost late last month —
recommended that "the president
and provost to continue their com
mitment to recruiting and retaining
minority faculty members," Dekker
said. It also called for the School of
Humanities and Sciences to aug

Alma Medina was determined to get
a Ph.D. in Spanish. So, how did she end
up in law school?
"I decided to go to law school be
cause it's much more flexible," she
said. "You can do anything with a law
degree. You can teach, you can go into
politics, you can get involved in the
community. Plus, it takes less time to
get a law degree than to get a Ph.D."

Medina's is not a rare case. A recent
report by the Provost's Committee on
the Recruitment, Retention and Grad
uation of Minority Graduate Students
found that Stanford's professional
schools are doing well in the recruit
ment of minority students, but its doc
toral programs are falling behind.
"Our main concern now is to in
crease the number of Ph.D. students,"
said Assoc. Dean of Graduate Policy
George Dekker, who chaired the com
mittee that produced the report.

Although some schools — such as
Engineering and Law — have made sig
nificant improvements, overall Stan
ford has fallen short of a goal set by the
1989 University Committee on Minori
ty Issues of doubling the number of mi
nority graduate students by this year.
Not enough Ph.D.s
What accounts for the low number
of minorities in doctoral programs? Fi
nancial security is a big factor in deter

mining what kind of program a student
attends, students and administrators
say.
"If your general level of education
and income is below the majority, then
you might be inclined to go into profes
sions that have more financial security
and status in the community," Dekker
said.
"Being a doctor or lawyer is consid
ered a more traditional money-making
field," said Jackie Olvera, a doctoral
student in sociology who served on
Dekker's committee. "People
haven't traditionally looked at
Ph.D. programs as a way to advance
yourself and your family. Let's face
it, there's not a whole lot of money
to be made as a professor."
Another factor contributing to
this trend is that the "rites of pas
sage" are much clearer for students
in professional schools, said Noe
Lozano, the associate dean for stu
dents and minority programs in the
School of Engineering.
"There is a set period of time
you're in school. If you go to law
school, you'll be done in three years.
Compare this to a Ph.D. program
where it can take anywhere from
three to nine years to get your
degree."
Another factor that might deter
some students from entering doc
toral programs is a very high drop
out rate. "Nationwide, there's
something like a 50 percent drop
out rate for Ph.D. programs,"

Lozano said, adding that in profes
sional schools the rate is "in the sin
gle digits."
'Just apply CPR'
Lozano has the perfect solution
for increasing the recruitment,
retention and graduation of minori
ty graduate students. "Just apply
CPR," he says.
By 'CPR,' he isn't referring to
the life-saving rescue technique, but
to his personal philosophy of "com
mitment, planning and resources"
that has transformed the School of
Engineering into the University's
most successful program in terms of
recruitment, retention and gradua
tion of minority graduate students.
The school has doubled the num
ber of enrolled minority doctoral
students in the last six years.
According to Lozano, there were 16
minority students in 1988; there are
now 40. Next fall, the school will
enroll 71 new minority graduate
students — the highest number in
the school's history and also
throughout the nation. "Stanford
ranks first nationally in all cate
gories of engineering," Dekker said.
The school's success is the result
of a commitment to increasing the

number of targeted minority gradu
ate students, and the careful plan
ning and allocation of resources to
achieve the goal.
"The dean's office has shown
their commitment to this goal by
funding fellowships and assis
tantships for minority students,"
Lozano said.
The School of Engineering will
"fund every targeted minority
that's admissible," Lozano said. The
school will also fund up to an addi
tional five quarters of study if a
minority student is "Ph. D.-bound,"
he said.
This is not normal University
practice. Dekker said Stanford does
not have a policy of offering special
deals for minority students. "By and
large Stanford tries to keep the
financial aid packages equitable," he
said.
As part of its planning effort, the
school has worked to establish a
"pipeline" in recent years. By expos
ing pre-college and college students
to the field of engineering, Lozano
hopes to convince more people to
apply to graduate school.
The school hosts several summer
programs for elementary school stu
dents as a way of encouraging their

interest, and engineering students
tutor in local schools throughout
the year, Lozano said.
The school also carefully plans its
recruiting efforts such as its Gradu
ate Minority Admit Weekend. It has
key faculty members personally
contact accepted applicants and
helps students obtain additional
outside funding.
A different experience
The School of Engineering recog
nizes that the experiences of minor
ity students are different than those
of non-minority students and has
taken steps to address this concern,
Lozano said.
In an effort to "create an envi
ronment of support," the school
offers a seminar fall quarter focused
on minority concerns. "We're play
ing catch-up and we can't afford to
lose minority students to the nor
mal vigor of graduate study," he
said. "
But graduate students in other
schools don't always benefit from
the kind of supportive environment
the School of Engineering tries to
foster.
"The general climate at Stanford
is not as good or as hospitable for

minority students as it is for other
students," said Lori White, a doctor
al student in the School of Educa
tion who served on Dekker's com
mittee.
"It's subtle little things like when
someone looks at you and wonders
if you're here on some sort of special
program, or you can't find someone
to sponsor your research on minori
ty issues because it's not considered
a study of academic inquiry. It's
those kinds of things that make it
more difficult," she said.
Rod Hernandez, a doctoral stu
dent in English, said that he has
encountered difficulties in his study
of Chicano literature. "One of the
problems I face is that my particular
field is not taken seriously," he said.
"There are enough individuals who
have expressed that sentiment
through either insinuation or other
kinds of indirect language that has
caused doubt about my position in
my field or department," he
explained. "You have to justify what
you're doing."
Student and faculty expectations
for minorities are often lower,
Olvera said. "In general there's the
feeling that minority students get
special breaks," she said. "For me,

that just means that you have to
work a little harder to downgrade
those sort of attitudes."
She added that being one of only
three Chicano graduate students in
her department can lead to feelings
of isolation, as does a lack of role
models. "It would be nice to have
someone who has the same perspec
tive," Olvera said, noting that there
are only 16 Chicano professors at
Stanford, and none in the Sociology
Department.
Minority faculty members are
helpful because "they've probably
been in the same position as the
only minority in the department.
They can really help you learn the
ropes," she said. "Hiring additional
minority faculty would attract
more minority graduate students. I
urge the president and provost to
carefully consider Dekker's
report."
