Alma Medina was determined to get
a Ph.D. in Spanish. So, how did she end
up in law school?

"Our main concern now is to in

said Assoc. Dean of Graduate Policy
George Dekker, who chaired the com
mittee that produced the report.

Although some schools — such as
Engineering and Law — have made sig
nificant improvements, overall Stan
ford has fallen short of a goal set by the
1989 University Committee on Minori
ty Issues of doubling the number of mi
nority graduate students by this year.
Not enough Ph.D.s
What accounts for the low number
of minorities in doctoral programs? Fi
nancial security is a big factor in deter

mining what kind of program a student
attends, students and administrators
say.
"If your general level of education
and income is below the majority, then
you might be inclined to go into profes
sions that have more financial security
and status in the community," Dekker
said.
"Being a doctor or lawyer is consid
