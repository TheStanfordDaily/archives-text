# Town and Gown: Stanford's role in P.A. growth
## University's expansion yields windfall, worries 
### Jamie Taylor Staff writer 
Just three years after Stanford's centennial celebra
tion, Palo Alto is celebrating its 100 th birthday — re
membering both the ties and tensions that have existed
between itself and this University through the years.
"Stanford has had a very important role" in the
town's development, said Susan Frank, the executive
director of Palo Alto's Chamber of Commerce, who
graduated from the University in 1988. "We wouldn't
be here if it wasn't for Stanford University."
Palo Alto was founded in the late 1800s, not as a
town, but as an area to serve the budding Stanford Uni
versity, with student and faculty housing and a number
of small bars and restaurants to cater to the students.
As the University grew in size and reputation, so did
Palo Alto; the town became increasingly settled with
families and businesspeople. In the 19505, Stanford
built a research park on the outskirts of its campus, be
ginning a close business relationship between the two
communities.

Palo Alto, celebrating its 100 th anniversary, has been linked with Stanford since its beginning. Although
the town and the University have squabbled at times, most characterize the relationship as amicable.
"Palo Alto, as Stanford grew,
continued to become a very com
munity-minded gathering of
diverse people," said Mary Davey,
executive director of the Palo Alto
Centennial Committee.
However, the relationship
between Stanford and Palo Alto
has not always been tranquil. Most

sources of tension stem from land
use issues.
"Some in Palo Alto view Stan
ford as a major developer interest
ed in gobbling up land and develop
ing to its heart's content," said
Andy Coe, the director of the Office
of Public Affairs at Stanford. He
added that "this has never been
Stanford's intention or goal."
"Palo Alto respects the educa
tional excellence of Stanford, but at
the same time, we don't want the
University to overwhelm us with

its commitment to expansion," said
Davey.
However, Davey added that
though the relationship has had
some times of strain, "Stanford
and Palo Alto are like very good
friends. Every now and then, you
get into a fight, but then it gets
resolved."
Frank said communication is
the most important vehicle to avoid
such tension. "The Chamber is in a
unique position in that is can help
bridge the communication gap

between Stanford and Palo Alto,"
she said.
Currently, Stanford is working
with the Palo Alto Comprehensive
Planning Process to "ensure that
future University projects, such as
the Sand Hill Road project, are in
concert with long term planning
goals of the city of Palo Alto," said
Coe. "This has been a marvelous
partnership to date."
Coe also said that both Palo Alto
and Stanford "are separate entities
yet so very intrinsically tied togeth-

er. Both see how positively they are
bound together, how they mutually
reinforce each other and how they
bring benefit to each other."
Palo Alto benefits from its prox
imity to a first-rate educational
institution, Coe said. "Stanford
provides Palo Alto with intellectual
opportunity that is unmatched on
this end of the country," agreed
Davey. The diversity and intellec
tual status of the students "keep us
thinking young," she added.
Palo Alto, however, is not just a

"college town," said Davey. "It's
more than that. It's an area of
progress, of openness and a really
diverse community."
Coe agreed that Palo Alto bene
fits the Stanford community. "Palo
Alto offers a community rich in
quality community services, good
schools and a great place to live for
many of [our] faculty, staff and stu
dents," he said.
"Stanford University draws
from what Palo Alto has to offer,"
said Frank.
