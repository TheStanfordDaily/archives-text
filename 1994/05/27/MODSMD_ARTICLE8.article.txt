# Town and Gown: Stanford's role in P.A. growth
## University's expansion yields windfall, worries 
### Jamie Taylor Staff writer 
Just three years after Stanford's centennial celebra
tion, Palo Alto is celebrating its 100 th birthday — re
membering both the ties and tensions that have existed
between itself and this University through the years.
"Stanford has had a very important role" in the
town's development, said Susan Frank, the executive
director of Palo Alto's Chamber of Commerce, who
graduated from the University in 1988. "We wouldn't
be here if it wasn't for Stanford University."
Palo Alto was founded in the late 1800s, not as a
town, but as an area to serve the budding Stanford Uni
versity, with student and faculty housing and a number
of small bars and restaurants to cater to the students.
As the University grew in size and reputation, so did
Palo Alto; the town became increasingly settled with
families and businesspeople. In the 19505, Stanford
built a research park on the outskirts of its campus, be
ginning a close business relationship between the two
communities.

Palo Alto, celebrating its 100 th anniversary, has been linked with Stanford since its beginning. Although
the town and the University have squabbled at times, most characterize the relationship as amicable.
