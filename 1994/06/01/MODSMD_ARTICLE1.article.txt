# Three who shaped a decade
## Student activists of a generation ago look back, forward 
### Kyle Graham Staff writer 
A generation ago, three Stanford students led the campus
through perhaps the most turbulent era in University his
tory.
Representing different ideals and striving toward differ
ent goals, David Harris, Harvey Hukari and Leo Bazile in
troduced student activism to Stanford while shaping the
tone and tenor of campus debate on issues ranging from the
Vietnam War to students' rights to race relations.
In turn, these experiences would help transform the
three activists' lives, guiding them along their respective

paths through today.
More than two decades later, Harris, Hukari and Bazile
agreed to discuss their experiences — both at Stanford and
beyond — with The Daily.
Ideals
It was the year of change. It was the year of David Harris.
— 1967 Stanford Quad
In many ways, the story of student activism at Stanford
begins with David Harris.

The story of David Harris is
not a short one, nor one easily
understood. But it is a tale with a
clear and certain beginning: Mis
sissippi, Freedom Summer, 1964.
"Mississippi was one of the for
mative experiences in my life,"
says Harris, now a 48-year-old
Mill Valley writer who was a
Stanford student body president
and later a convicted felon as a
result of his anti-Vietnam War
activities.
"I was a kid who grew up believ
ing in what they told us in high
school civics. Then, on mv third dav

(canvassing for voters) in Lambert,

" m giving you five minutes to
get out of town.' It made me realize
that there were tremendous ii\jus
tices in our system, injustices which
were going on with the collusion of
the powers-that-be."
Harris applied these revela
tions on his return to Stanford,
where as a radical, anti-war can
didate he won a surprise victory
for student body president in

r — —
1966. "I ran a campaign that was
antithetical to that of my prede
cessors," says Harris. "I had a
beard, Levi's and long hair."
Once in office, he spoke against
military involvement in Vietnam
and lobbied for fundamental
change in the relationship among
Stanford students, administra
tion and faculty.
"Basically, we were asking for
simple things — for example, the
right for students to govern
themselves, to be equal members

of the community along
r with faculty

and adminis
tration, as well as the
right among women to be treated
the same as men. These goals
have, by today, all largely been
achieved. People taken them as a
given, now," says Harris.
Despite his activist record
while in office, Harris resigned
from the presidency before his
term ended. He said at the time,
"All the motivations for me being
student body president, all the
things I had hoped to say, I've
said." And with that, he disap
peared from campus notoriety —
for a time.
The war
However, later that year Har
ris' ongoing anti-Vietnam War
protests would again cast him
into the public eye. In 1966, while
student body president, he had
refused his 11-S student classifica
tion. As he recalls, "I didn't feel
that student deferments were
appropriate. I felt that if America
was going to fight the war, then
all Americans should go." Soon
after, he was reclassified I-A.
Again, though, Harris declined
to cooperate with the draft
authorities and instead followed
the tenets of the Resistance anti-

draft group he helped found.
"I felt that the only way to stop
the war was to refuse to partici
pate; if everyone were to refuse,
there was no way that the govern
ment could continue to prosecute
the war," he says.
Thus began a series of battles
between Harris and the draft
authorities. After he refused to
report on his January 1968 induc
tion date, Harris was hit with
felony counts of draft evasion and
sentenced to three years in
prison.
After a year of appeals, he was
committed to a series of prisons
for 20 months, including four in

tion near El Paso. He was
paroled in 1971.
Although he did not frequently

return to campus iouowing nis
parole, he did observe the often
violent anti-war protests which
consumed the campus during the
early 1970s. "I thought it was an
inappropriate strategy," he
relates. "I found it very uncom
fortable; bad actions to serve a
good cause aren't necessarily
worthwhile."

nizer, then as a contributing edi
tor to such publications as Rolling
Stone. He has also written a num
ber of books in the previous two
decades, including a study of the
NFL titled "The League" and
"Dreams Die Hard," which dis
cussed the 1980 murder of liberal
politician/activist Allard Lowen
stein by Dennis Sweeney, both of
whom were close associates of
Harris in the 19605.
Now, 27 years after leaving
Stanford, Harris still sees many
of the same issues he faced as
important to students today.
"The fundamental tension that

we were addressing at

Stanford is

still

on campus," he
says. " 'What do I

want out of my education?'
— that is still the question that
students must ask themselves."
Life has progressed for Harris,
yet by his admission it has been a
life shaped by his years at the
Farm. "I still feel intimately con
nected to the person I was then;
I'm not the same person, because
you either grow or you die. . ..
But I am proud of what I attempt
ed."
Struggle
Two students were shot, at
least three persons were briefly
hospitalized with injuries and
eight persons arrested last night
as 200 radicals clashed with
police and Free Campus Move
ment members near the Under
graduate Library.

"I have only one regret about
my time at Stanford. I regret that
I didn't get an education because
of all the distractions."

This is the lament of Republi
can political consultant Harvey
Hukari, former leader of the
Stanford chapters of the Free
Campus Movement (FCM) and
Young Americans for Freedom
(YAF). While at the helm of these
organizations, he was a first-hand
participant in many of the on
campus political struggles of the
early 19705.
Yet Hukari, unlike many of his
more-publicized political counter
parts, was a conservative, one
attempting to halt what he saw as
the University's "accomodation
ist view toward the radical left."

lot vit;w wjwtxiu. i/iic xauivai iwi.
Under Hukari, who earned his
undergraduate degree from Stan-

ford in 1968 and his master's in
1973, the YAF and FCM

took pho

tographs
of rioters in

anti-ROTC protests,
physically opposed takeovers of
campus buildings and urged the
recruitment of conservative pro
fessors and the granting of aca
demic credit for ROTC courses —
all at a time when the balance of
campus opinion was shifting
heavily toward the left.
The struggles in which he was
a participant would culminate in

the events of February 10,
1971. On that evening, a
group of students, having
declared a "people's war" on
campus, clashed with FCM
members, bystanders and
police. The result was the
most violent night in Stanford
history.

"The fact that we disagreed
with the takeovers and the need
for property destruction and vio
lence and were militant about our

opposition aroused a lot of hostili
ty," Hukari says.
This hostility also manifested
itself in the three firebombings
inflicted on FCM headquarters,
including one attempt with
Hukari himself inside the build
ing.
Hukari traces much of the con
flict between campus conserva-

tives and radicals at the time to

differences in background

as well as ideology.
"[Conservatives!
were mostly middle
class or lower-mid-

uaoo v/i vjl uiiu
die-class kids to whom
going to Stanford was a
nrivileoe " he savs. "The

pilViicgc, lie oayo.
radicals came mostly from""
other social groups."

Still, the San Francisco resi
dent does not deny that much of
the conflict was linked to differing
political ideologies. "We objected
to the arrogant presumption that
all students should think alike.
We wanted to demonstrate to the
campus and the outside world
that radicalism was hardly uni
versal at Stanford."
The struggle continues to this
day for Hukari, who still attempts
to contain what he sees as much
of the damage of 1960s and '70s
radicalism. A political consultant
who describes himself as a Barry
Goldwater-esque "fusionist,"
combining libertarianism with
traditional values, Hukari views
the social and political aftermath
of the fight in which he partici
pated in a mixed light.

"The radicals lost the political

battle,

but they may
have won the cultural fight," he
says."I think that the prevalent
permissiveness in society, the

continuing attack on standards
and other social ills are a result of
what happened in the 19605."
Politics
At the time, the Black Student
Union had 12 seats out of 40 in
the ASSU Senate, so we were the
swing bloc between the radicals
and conservatives.

The radicals in
the senate wanted funding for a
graduate student day-care center;
the conservatives for pom-poms
and athletic equipment and stuff
like that. Sometimes we'd support
the conservatives and piss off the
radicals, and sometimes the other
way around, depending on
whether they supported our objec
tives.
— Leo Bazile
In the 19605, many student
activists denounced the political
system as too corrupted by the
evils of materialism and class divi
sion to be a worthwhile avenue of
reform.
Not Leo Bazile. And since his
experiences at Stanford, where he
learned to "play politics in a sand-

box," Bazile has

gone on to

o —
play in much larger sandboxes,
including a 10-year tenure as an
Oakland City Councilman.
Bazile now views his involve
ment in Bay Area government as

the natural extension of his activ
ities on campus. While at Stan
ford, his two-year stretch as the
activist chairman of the Black
Student Union and term as an
ASSU Senator during a period of
unprecedented campus activism
allowed him to pursue an agenda
"focused on immediate concerns,
trying to set a tone for our times."
"The context of the time was
one of student empowerment;
students wanted to have some
thing to say about faculty, cur
riculum and other issues, and we
attempted to achieve these goals,"
he adds.
While at Stanford, Bazile par
ticipated in Vietnam Moratorium
protests and other anti-war activ
ities. Yet many contemporary on
campus white radical groups
attacked what they saw as the
BSU's quiescence under Bazile,
charging that the group was more
concerned with on-campus affairs
than defending the rights of
Third-World peoples.
Bazile admits that fighting
institutional racism, not the Viet
nam War, was the primary con
cern of the BSU. "Vietnam was
only a concern for us because a
disproportionate number of sol
diers in Vietnam, and especially
those dying in Vietnam, were
black. So we didn't really focus on
it as an issue."
Instead, "The priorities of the
black power movement were
political empowerment and an
attack on institutional racism,
rather than individual racism,"
he says. "After all, the institution

we were looking at, the Universi
ty, wasn't the most integrated
place in the world."
In 1967, when Bazile entered
the University, there were 70
African-American students at
Stanford, a situation Bazile found
alarming. "Dr. King was killed in
'68, so Stanford let a few black
kids like me through the door. My

first priority I got here, then,

was to open the doors
i*iii • J ... ft r*_.

a little wider. By
Bazile's final year at
Stanford, the number
of African-American stu-

dents on the Farm had
doubled.
Bazile also believes that

the BSU's focus on empow
erment also led to a greater
in

self-awareness among
African-American students and a
greater determination among stu
dents to apply the skills acquired
at Stanford within their home
communities.
"We tried to first help black stu
dents realize that they were black,"
he says, "then helped students
learn so that they could eventually
help their communities."
After graduating from Stan
ford, Bazile attended law school,
served as an administrative assis
tant for then-state Sen. George
Moscone, then went on to found
the law firm of Harrison, Taylor
and Bazile in 1978, the same year
as his first effort to obtain elected
office. He currently serves as a
partner in the Oakland-based
firm.

Looking back-
Iward, Bazile reads

the story of late
19605-early '70s
protests as one of
success, not fail
ure. "In 1968,
there were two

black mayors in the United
States ... but now, I think that the

New York mayoral race, the fact
that there's been a black governor
and other events proves that we
have moved successfully into the
political arena."

of the community along
r with faculty

and adminis
tration, as well as the
right among women to be treated
the same as men. These goals
have, by today, all largely been
achieved. People taken them as a
given, now," says Harris.
Despite his activist record
while in office, Harris resigned
from the presidency before his
term ended. He said at the time,
"All the motivations for me being
student body president, all the
things I had hoped to say, I've
said." And with that, he disap
peared from campus notoriety —
for a time.
The war
However, later that year Har
ris' ongoing anti-Vietnam War
protests would again cast him
into the public eye. In 1966, while
student body president, he had
refused his 11-S student classifica
tion. As he recalls, "I didn't feel
that student deferments were
appropriate. I felt that if America
was going to fight the war, then
all Americans should go." Soon
after, he was reclassified I-A.
Again, though, Harris declined
to cooperate with the draft
authorities and instead followed
the tenets of the Resistance anti-

draft group he helped found.
"I felt that the only way to stop
the war was to refuse to partici
pate; if everyone were to refuse,
there was no way that the govern
ment could continue to prosecute
the war," he says.
Thus began a series of battles
between Harris and the draft
authorities. After he refused to
report on his January 1968 induc
tion date, Harris was hit with
felony counts of draft evasion and
sentenced to three years in
prison.
After a year of appeals, he was
committed to a series of prisons
for 20 months, including four in

violent anti-war protests which
consumed the campus during the

decades, including a study of the
NFL titled "The League" and
"Dreams Die Hard," which dis
cussed the 1980 murder of liberal
politician/activist Allard Lowen
stein by Dennis Sweeney, both of
whom were close associates of
Harris in the 19605.
Now, 27 years after leaving
Stanford, Harris still sees many
of the same issues he faced as
important to students today.
"The fundamental tension that

we were addressing at

Stanford is

still

on campus," he
says. " 'What do I

want out of my education?'
— that is still the question that
students must ask themselves."
Life has progressed for Harris,
yet by his admission it has been a
life shaped by his years at the
Farm. "I still feel intimately con
nected to the person I was then;
I'm not the same person, because
you either grow or you die. . ..
But I am proud of what I attempt
ed."

"I have only one regret about
my time at Stanford. I regret that
I didn't get an education because
of all the distractions."

This is the lament of Republi
can political consultant Harvey
Hukari, former leader of the
Stanford chapters of the Free
Campus Movement (FCM) and
Young Americans for Freedom
(YAF). While at the helm of these
organizations, he was a first-hand
participant in many of the on
campus political struggles of the
early 19705.
Yet Hukari, unlike many of his
more-publicized political counter
parts, was a conservative, one
attempting to halt what he saw as
the University's "accomodation
ist view toward the radical left."

Under Hukari, who earned his
undergraduate degree from Stan-

ford in 1968 and his master's in
1973, the YAF and FCM

took pho

tographs
of rioters in

anti-ROTC protests,
physically opposed takeovers of
campus buildings and urged the
recruitment of conservative pro
fessors and the granting of aca
demic credit for ROTC courses —
all at a time when the balance of
campus opinion was shifting
heavily toward the left.
The struggles in which he was
a participant would culminate in

the events of February 10,
1971. On that evening, a
group of students, having
declared a "people's war" on
campus, clashed with FCM
members, bystanders and
police. The result was the
most violent night in Stanford
history.

"The fact that we disagreed
with the takeovers and the need
for property destruction and vio
lence and were militant about our

opposition aroused a lot of hostili
ty," Hukari says.
This hostility also manifested
itself in the three firebombings
inflicted on FCM headquarters,
including one attempt with
Hukari himself inside the build
ing.
Hukari traces much of the con
flict between campus conserva-

tives and radicals at the time to

differences in background

as well as ideology.
"[Conservatives!

other social groups."

Still, the San Francisco resi
dent does not deny that much of
the conflict was linked to differing
political ideologies. "We objected
to the arrogant presumption that
all students should think alike.
We wanted to demonstrate to the
campus and the outside world
that radicalism was hardly uni
versal at Stanford."
The struggle continues to this
day for Hukari, who still attempts
to contain what he sees as much
of the damage of 1960s and '70s
radicalism. A political consultant
who describes himself as a Barry
Goldwater-esque "fusionist,"
combining libertarianism with
traditional values, Hukari views
the social and political aftermath
of the fight in which he partici
pated in a mixed light.

"The radicals lost the political

battle,

but they may
have won the cultural fight," he
says."I think that the prevalent
permissiveness in society, the

continuing attack on standards
and other social ills are a result of
what happened in the 19605."
Politics
At the time, the Black Student
Union had 12 seats out of 40 in
the ASSU Senate, so we were the
swing bloc between the radicals
and conservatives.

The radicals in
the senate wanted funding for a
graduate student day-care center;
the conservatives for pom-poms
and athletic equipment and stuff
like that. Sometimes we'd support
the conservatives and piss off the
radicals, and sometimes the other
way around, depending on
whether they supported our objec
tives.
— Leo Bazile
In the 19605, many student
activists denounced the political
system as too corrupted by the
evils of materialism and class divi
sion to be a worthwhile avenue of
reform.
Not Leo Bazile. And since his
experiences at Stanford, where he
learned to "play politics in a sand-

box," Bazile has

gone on to

o —
play in much larger sandboxes,
including a 10-year tenure as an
Oakland City Councilman.
Bazile now views his involve
ment in Bay Area government as

the natural extension of his activ
ities on campus. While at Stan
ford, his two-year stretch as the
activist chairman of the Black
Student Union and term as an
ASSU Senator during a period of
unprecedented campus activism
allowed him to pursue an agenda
"focused on immediate concerns,
trying to set a tone for our times."
"The context of the time was
one of student empowerment;
students wanted to have some
thing to say about faculty, cur
riculum and other issues, and we
attempted to achieve these goals,"
he adds.
While at Stanford, Bazile par
ticipated in Vietnam Moratorium
protests and other anti-war activ
ities. Yet many contemporary on
campus white radical groups
attacked what they saw as the
BSU's quiescence under Bazile,
charging that the group was more
concerned with on-campus affairs
than defending the rights of
Third-World peoples.
Bazile admits that fighting
institutional racism, not the Viet
nam War, was the primary con
cern of the BSU. "Vietnam was
only a concern for us because a
disproportionate number of sol
diers in Vietnam, and especially
those dying in Vietnam, were
black. So we didn't really focus on
it as an issue."
Instead, "The priorities of the
black power movement were
political empowerment and an
attack on institutional racism,
rather than individual racism,"
he says. "After all, the institution

we were looking at, the Universi
ty, wasn't the most integrated
place in the world."
In 1967, when Bazile entered
the University, there were 70
African-American students at
Stanford, a situation Bazile found
alarming. "Dr. King was killed in
'68, so Stanford let a few black
kids like me through the door. My

first priority I got here, then,

was to open the doors
i*iii • J ... ft r*_.

a little wider. By
Bazile's final year at
Stanford, the number
of African-American stu-

dents on the Farm had
doubled.
Bazile also believes that

the BSU's focus on empow
erment also led to a greater
in

self-awareness among
African-American students and a
greater determination among stu
dents to apply the skills acquired
at Stanford within their home
communities.
"We tried to first help black stu
dents realize that they were black,"
he says, "then helped students
learn so that they could eventually
help their communities."
After graduating from Stan
ford, Bazile attended law school,
served as an administrative assis
tant for then-state Sen. George
Moscone, then went on to found
the law firm of Harrison, Taylor
and Bazile in 1978, the same year
as his first effort to obtain elected
office. He currently serves as a
partner in the Oakland-based
firm.

Looking back-
Iward, Bazile reads

the story of late
19605-early '70s
protests as one of
success, not fail
ure. "In 1968,
there were two

black mayors in the United
States ... but now, I think that the

New York mayoral race, the fact
that there's been a black governor
and other events proves that we
have moved successfully into the
political arena."

A generation ago, three Stanford students led the campus
through perhaps the most turbulent era in University his
tory.
Representing different ideals and striving toward differ
ent goals, David Harris, Harvey Hukari and Leo Bazile in
troduced student activism to Stanford while shaping the
tone and tenor of campus debate on issues ranging from the
Vietnam War to students' rights to race relations.
In turn, these experiences would help transform the
three activists' lives, guiding them along their respective

paths through today.
More than two decades later, Harris, Hukari and Bazile
agreed to discuss their experiences — both at Stanford and
beyond — with The Daily.

It was the year of change. It was the year of David Harris.
— 1967 Stanford Quad
In many ways, the story of student activism at Stanford
begins with David Harris.

The story of David Harris is
not a short one, nor one easily
understood. But it is a tale with a
clear and certain beginning: Mis
sissippi, Freedom Summer, 1964.
"Mississippi was one of the for
mative experiences in my life,"
says Harris, now a 48-year-old
Mill Valley writer who was a
Stanford student body president
and later a convicted felon as a
result of his anti-Vietnam War
activities.
"I was a kid who grew up believ
ing in what they told us in high
school civics. Then, on mv third dav

that there were tremendous ii\jus

were going on with the collusion of
the powers-that-be."
Harris applied these revela
tions on his return to Stanford,
where as a radical, anti-war can
didate he won a surprise victory
for student body president in

r — —
1966. "I ran a campaign that was
antithetical to that of my prede
cessors," says Harris. "I had a
beard, Levi's and long hair."
Once in office, he spoke against
military involvement in Vietnam
and lobbied for fundamental
change in the relationship among
Stanford students, administra
tion and faculty.
"Basically, we were asking for

want out of my education?'
— that is still the question that

yet by his admission it has been a
life shaped by his years at the

"I have only one regret about
my time at Stanford. I regret that
I didn't get an education because
of all the distractions."

This is the lament of Republi
can political consultant Harvey
Hukari, former leader of the
Stanford chapters of the Free
Campus Movement (FCM) and
Young Americans for Freedom
(YAF). While at the helm of these
organizations, he was a first-hand
participant in many of the on
campus political struggles of the
early 19705.
Yet Hukari, unlike many of his
more-publicized political counter
parts, was a conservative, one
attempting to halt what he saw as
the University's "accomodation
ist view toward the radical left."

Under Hukari, who earned his
undergraduate degree from Stan-

ford in 1968 and his master's in
1973, the YAF and FCM

took pho

tographs
of rioters in

anti-ROTC protests,
physically opposed takeovers of
campus buildings and urged the
recruitment of conservative pro
fessors and the granting of aca
demic credit for ROTC courses —
all at a time when the balance of
campus opinion was shifting
heavily toward the left.
The struggles in which he was
a participant would culminate in

the events of February 10,
1971. On that evening, a
group of students, having
declared a "people's war" on
campus, clashed with FCM
members, bystanders and
police. The result was the
most violent night in Stanford
history.

"The fact that we disagreed
with the takeovers and the need
for property destruction and vio
lence and were militant about our

opposition aroused a lot of hostili
ty," Hukari says.
This hostility also manifested
itself in the three firebombings
inflicted on FCM headquarters,
including one attempt with
Hukari himself inside the build
ing.
Hukari traces much of the con
flict between campus conserva-

tives and radicals at the time to

differences in background

as well as ideology.
"[Conservatives!

other social groups."

Still, the San Francisco resi
dent does not deny that much of
the conflict was linked to differing
political ideologies. "We objected
to the arrogant presumption that
all students should think alike.
We wanted to demonstrate to the
campus and the outside world
that radicalism was hardly uni
versal at Stanford."
The struggle continues to this
day for Hukari, who still attempts
to contain what he sees as much
of the damage of 1960s and '70s
radicalism. A political consultant
who describes himself as a Barry
Goldwater-esque "fusionist,"
combining libertarianism with
traditional values, Hukari views
the social and political aftermath
of the fight in which he partici
pated in a mixed light.

"The radicals lost the political

battle,

but they may
have won the cultural fight," he
says."I think that the prevalent
permissiveness in society, the

continuing attack on standards
and other social ills are a result of
what happened in the 19605."
Politics
At the time, the Black Student
Union had 12 seats out of 40 in
the ASSU Senate, so we were the
swing bloc between the radicals
and conservatives.

The radicals in
the senate wanted funding for a
graduate student day-care center;
the conservatives for pom-poms
and athletic equipment and stuff
like that. Sometimes we'd support
the conservatives and piss off the
radicals, and sometimes the other
way around, depending on
whether they supported our objec
tives.
— Leo Bazile
In the 19605, many student
activists denounced the political
system as too corrupted by the
evils of materialism and class divi
sion to be a worthwhile avenue of
reform.
Not Leo Bazile. And since his
experiences at Stanford, where he
learned to "play politics in a sand-

box," Bazile has

gone on to

o —
play in much larger sandboxes,
including a 10-year tenure as an
Oakland City Councilman.
Bazile now views his involve
ment in Bay Area government as

the natural extension of his activ
ities on campus. While at Stan
ford, his two-year stretch as the
activist chairman of the Black
Student Union and term as an
ASSU Senator during a period of
unprecedented campus activism
allowed him to pursue an agenda
"focused on immediate concerns,
trying to set a tone for our times."
"The context of the time was
one of student empowerment;
students wanted to have some
thing to say about faculty, cur
riculum and other issues, and we
attempted to achieve these goals,"
he adds.
While at Stanford, Bazile par
ticipated in Vietnam Moratorium
protests and other anti-war activ
ities. Yet many contemporary on
campus white radical groups
attacked what they saw as the
BSU's quiescence under Bazile,
charging that the group was more
concerned with on-campus affairs
than defending the rights of
Third-World peoples.
Bazile admits that fighting
institutional racism, not the Viet
nam War, was the primary con
cern of the BSU. "Vietnam was
only a concern for us because a
disproportionate number of sol
diers in Vietnam, and especially
those dying in Vietnam, were
black. So we didn't really focus on
it as an issue."
Instead, "The priorities of the
black power movement were
political empowerment and an
attack on institutional racism,
rather than individual racism,"
he says. "After all, the institution

we were looking at, the Universi
ty, wasn't the most integrated
place in the world."
In 1967, when Bazile entered
the University, there were 70
African-American students at
Stanford, a situation Bazile found
alarming. "Dr. King was killed in
'68, so Stanford let a few black
kids like me through the door. My

first priority I got here, then,

was to open the doors
i*iii • J ... ft r*_.

a little wider. By
Bazile's final year at
Stanford, the number
of African-American stu-

dents on the Farm had
doubled.
Bazile also believes that

the BSU's focus on empow
erment also led to a greater
in

self-awareness among
African-American students and a
greater determination among stu
dents to apply the skills acquired
at Stanford within their home
communities.
"We tried to first help black stu
dents realize that they were black,"
he says, "then helped students
learn so that they could eventually
help their communities."
After graduating from Stan
ford, Bazile attended law school,
served as an administrative assis
tant for then-state Sen. George
Moscone, then went on to found
the law firm of Harrison, Taylor
and Bazile in 1978, the same year
as his first effort to obtain elected
office. He currently serves as a
partner in the Oakland-based
firm.

Looking back-
Iward, Bazile reads

the story of late
19605-early '70s
protests as one of
success, not fail
ure. "In 1968,
there were two

black mayors in the United
States ... but now, I think that the

New York mayoral race, the fact
that there's been a black governor
and other events proves that we
have moved successfully into the
political arena."

A generation ago, three Stanford students led the campus
through perhaps the most turbulent era in University his
tory.
Representing different ideals and striving toward differ
ent goals, David Harris, Harvey Hukari and Leo Bazile in
troduced student activism to Stanford while shaping the
tone and tenor of campus debate on issues ranging from the
Vietnam War to students' rights to race relations.
In turn, these experiences would help transform the
three activists' lives, guiding them along their respective

paths through today.
More than two decades later, Harris, Hukari and Bazile
agreed to discuss their experiences — both at Stanford and
beyond — with The Daily.
Ideals
It was the year of change. It was the year of David Harris.
— 1967 Stanford Quad
In many ways, the story of student activism at Stanford
begins with David Harris.

The story of David Harris is
not a short one, nor one easily
understood. But it is a tale with a
clear and certain beginning: Mis
sissippi, Freedom Summer, 1964.
"Mississippi was one of the for
mative experiences in my life,"
says Harris, now a 48-year-old
Mill Valley writer who was a
Stanford student body president
and later a convicted felon as a
result of his anti-Vietnam War
activities.
"I was a kid who grew up believ
ing in what they told us in high
school civics. Then, on mv third dav

VI 112 AMI* A IiVII, Vll * A fllU V*
(canvassing for voters) in Lambert,
Mississippi, someone stuck a shot

gun in my face and said,
'Nigger-lover, I'm

" m giving you five minutes to
get out of town.' It made me realize
that there were tremendous ii\jus
tices in our system, injustices which
were going on with the collusion of
the powers-that-be."
Harris applied these revela
tions on his return to Stanford,
where as a radical, anti-war can
didate he won a surprise victory
for student body president in

r — —
1966. "I ran a campaign that was
antithetical to that of my prede
cessors," says Harris. "I had a
beard, Levi's and long hair."
Once in office, he spoke against
military involvement in Vietnam
and lobbied for fundamental
change in the relationship among
Stanford students, administra
tion and faculty.
"Basically, we were asking for
simple things — for example, the
right for students to govern
themselves, to be equal members

of the community along
r with faculty

and adminis
tration, as well as the
right among women to be treated
the same as men. These goals
have, by today, all largely been
achieved. People taken them as a
given, now," says Harris.
Despite his activist record
while in office, Harris resigned
from the presidency before his
term ended. He said at the time,
"All the motivations for me being
student body president, all the
things I had hoped to say, I've
said." And with that, he disap
peared from campus notoriety —
for a time.
The war
However, later that year Har
ris' ongoing anti-Vietnam War
protests would again cast him
into the public eye. In 1966, while
student body president, he had
refused his 11-S student classifica
tion. As he recalls, "I didn't feel
that student deferments were
appropriate. I felt that if America
was going to fight the war, then
all Americans should go." Soon
after, he was reclassified I-A.
Again, though, Harris declined
to cooperate with the draft
authorities and instead followed
the tenets of the Resistance anti-

draft group he helped found.
"I felt that the only way to stop
the war was to refuse to partici
pate; if everyone were to refuse,
there was no way that the govern
ment could continue to prosecute
the war," he says.
Thus began a series of battles
between Harris and the draft
authorities. After he refused to
report on his January 1968 induc
tion date, Harris was hit with
felony counts of draft evasion and
sentenced to three years in
prison.
After a year of appeals, he was
committed to a series of prisons
for 20 months, including four in

consumed the campus during the

fessors and the granting of aca
demic credit for ROTC courses —
all at a time when the balance of
campus opinion was shifting
heavily toward the left.
The struggles in which he was
a participant would culminate in

the events of February 10,
1971. On that evening, a
group of students, having
declared a "people's war" on
campus, clashed with FCM
members, bystanders and
police. The result was the
most violent night in Stanford
history.

"The fact that we disagreed
with the takeovers and the need
for property destruction and vio
lence and were militant about our

opposition aroused a lot of hostili
ty," Hukari says.
This hostility also manifested
itself in the three firebombings
inflicted on FCM headquarters,
including one attempt with
Hukari himself inside the build
ing.
Hukari traces much of the con
flict between campus conserva-

tives and radicals at the time to

differences in background

as well as ideology.
"[Conservatives!
were mostly middle
class or lower-mid-

uaoo v/i vjl uiiu

radicals came mostly from""
other social groups."

Still, the San Francisco resi
dent does not deny that much of
the conflict was linked to differing
political ideologies. "We objected
to the arrogant presumption that
all students should think alike.
We wanted to demonstrate to the
campus and the outside world
that radicalism was hardly uni
versal at Stanford."
The struggle continues to this
day for Hukari, who still attempts
to contain what he sees as much
of the damage of 1960s and '70s
radicalism. A political consultant
who describes himself as a Barry
Goldwater-esque "fusionist,"
combining libertarianism with
traditional values, Hukari views
the social and political aftermath
of the fight in which he partici
pated in a mixed light.

"The radicals lost the political

battle,

but they may
have won the cultural fight," he
says."I think that the prevalent
permissiveness in society, the

continuing attack on standards
and other social ills are a result of
what happened in the 19605."
Politics
At the time, the Black Student
Union had 12 seats out of 40 in
the ASSU Senate, so we were the
swing bloc between the radicals
and conservatives.

The radicals in
the senate wanted funding for a
graduate student day-care center;
the conservatives for pom-poms
and athletic equipment and stuff
like that. Sometimes we'd support
the conservatives and piss off the
radicals, and sometimes the other
way around, depending on
whether they supported our objec
tives.
— Leo Bazile
In the 19605, many student
activists denounced the political
system as too corrupted by the
evils of materialism and class divi
sion to be a worthwhile avenue of
reform.
Not Leo Bazile. And since his
experiences at Stanford, where he
learned to "play politics in a sand-

box," Bazile has

gone on to

o —
play in much larger sandboxes,
including a 10-year tenure as an
Oakland City Councilman.
Bazile now views his involve
ment in Bay Area government as

the natural extension of his activ
ities on campus. While at Stan
ford, his two-year stretch as the
activist chairman of the Black
Student Union and term as an
ASSU Senator during a period of
unprecedented campus activism
allowed him to pursue an agenda
"focused on immediate concerns,
trying to set a tone for our times."
"The context of the time was
one of student empowerment;
students wanted to have some
thing to say about faculty, cur
riculum and other issues, and we
attempted to achieve these goals,"
he adds.
While at Stanford, Bazile par
ticipated in Vietnam Moratorium
protests and other anti-war activ
ities. Yet many contemporary on
campus white radical groups
attacked what they saw as the
BSU's quiescence under Bazile,
charging that the group was more
concerned with on-campus affairs
than defending the rights of
Third-World peoples.
Bazile admits that fighting
institutional racism, not the Viet
nam War, was the primary con
cern of the BSU. "Vietnam was
only a concern for us because a
disproportionate number of sol
diers in Vietnam, and especially
those dying in Vietnam, were
black. So we didn't really focus on
it as an issue."
Instead, "The priorities of the
black power movement were
political empowerment and an
attack on institutional racism,
rather than individual racism,"
he says. "After all, the institution

we were looking at, the Universi
ty, wasn't the most integrated
place in the world."
In 1967, when Bazile entered
the University, there were 70
African-American students at
Stanford, a situation Bazile found
alarming. "Dr. King was killed in
'68, so Stanford let a few black
kids like me through the door. My

first priority I got here, then,

was to open the doors
i*iii • J ... ft r*_.

a little wider. By
Bazile's final year at
Stanford, the number
of African-American stu-

dents on the Farm had
doubled.
Bazile also believes that

the BSU's focus on empow
erment also led to a greater
in

self-awareness among
African-American students and a
greater determination among stu
dents to apply the skills acquired
at Stanford within their home
communities.
"We tried to first help black stu
dents realize that they were black,"
he says, "then helped students
learn so that they could eventually
help their communities."
After graduating from Stan
ford, Bazile attended law school,
served as an administrative assis
tant for then-state Sen. George
Moscone, then went on to found
the law firm of Harrison, Taylor
and Bazile in 1978, the same year
as his first effort to obtain elected
office. He currently serves as a
partner in the Oakland-based
firm.

Looking back-
Iward, Bazile reads

the story of late
19605-early '70s
protests as one of
success, not fail
ure. "In 1968,
there were two

black mayors in the United
States ... but now, I think that the

New York mayoral race, the fact
that there's been a black governor
and other events proves that we
have moved successfully into the
political arena."
