# Three who shaped a decade
## Student activists of a generation ago look back, forward 
### Kyle Graham Staff writer 
A generation ago, three Stanford students led the campus
through perhaps the most turbulent era in University his
tory.
Representing different ideals and striving toward differ
ent goals, David Harris, Harvey Hukari and Leo Bazile in
troduced student activism to Stanford while shaping the
tone and tenor of campus debate on issues ranging from the
Vietnam War to students' rights to race relations.
In turn, these experiences would help transform the
three activists' lives, guiding them along their respective

paths through today.
More than two decades later, Harris, Hukari and Bazile
agreed to discuss their experiences — both at Stanford and
beyond — with The Daily.

It was the year of change. It was the year of David Harris.

In many ways, the story of student activism at Stanford
begins with David Harris.
