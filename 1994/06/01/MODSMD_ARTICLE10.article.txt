# Rostenkowski indicted on 17 counts
## His conduct called a 'betrayal of the public trust for personal gain' 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Rep. Dan Ros
tenkowski was indicted yesterday on 17
felony counts alleging he plundered nearly
$700,000 from the government, using
public funds for personal gain, lavishing
gifts on friends and having ghost employ
ees kick back paychecks to his office.
The 49-page indictment portrayed a
greedy Rostenkowski, not the influen
tial deal-maker generally described.
U.S. Attorney Eric H. Holder Jr.
described his conduct as a "betrayal of
the public trust for personal gain."
Rostenkowski lost his chairmanship
of the House and Ways Committee the
moment the indictment was returned, a
blow to President Clinton, whose health
care and other programs he has pushed.
According to the charges, the Illinois
Democrat placed workers on the public
payroll to take pictures at his daugh

ters' weddings, remodel his Chicago
home, keep the books for the family
insurance company and mow the lawn
at his vacation home.
He bought custom-painted chairs,
crystal sculptures and fine china for his
pals, paying with public funds, the
indictment said. And he obstructed jus
tice, it added, by telling a witness to
withhold evidence from the grand jury.
As he was replaced by Rep. Sam Gib
bons, D-Fla., under House Democratic
Caucus rules, Holder was telling a news
conference that Rostenkowski engaged in
a "very reprehensible, very offensive" pat
tern of corruption for more than 20 years.
Anticipating the indictment, Ros
tenkowski issued a statement Monday
night pledging to fight the charges and
remain in Congress. "I did not commit
any crimes," he said.

Clinton issued a statement saying,
"Like all Americans, Chairman Ros
tenkowski has the right to contest the
charges made against him and to have his
day in court. Chairman Rostenkowski and
others have helped create real momentum
for health care reform, and I am confident
that legislation will pass this year."
Meanwhile, there were reports that
Rostenkowski was considering replac
ing his defense attorney, Robert S. Ben
nett, who also is a private lawyer for
President Clinton. But Holder said Ben
nett still represented the congressman
as of the time of the indictment. Ben
nett did not return telephone calls.
Holder said the two-year investiga
tion, which began as an embezzle
ment and drug probe of low-level
employees at the House Post Office,
would continue.
