## Editor's farewell 
### 
The best of times?
A sentimental look at
turmoil and discovery

FOR FOUR months now, I
have observed campus from
within the walls of the war
room. I call it"the war room" —
the name for Bill Clinton's hectic
campaign quarters — out of senti
ment and cynicism.
This office too operated on lofty
goals, insufficient sleep, and a
fast-food diet to rival that of the
president. More importantly, it
was a place that once brimmed
with idealistic young staffers,
myself included, who have since
traded some of the idealism for
hard-learned experience.
What we saw from the war
room was a quiet campus as it
gradually grew disquieted and
began to vent its anger, frustra
tion and fear. It was a newspa
per's joy (at having real news) and
a community's anguish. But
often, the lines were blurred —
and despite the media's goal of
objectivity, much of what we cov
ered touched us too.
Budget cuts. Hostile layoffs.
Racial tensions. A hunger strike.
Vandalism. Courage, cowardice
and passion strike you no matter
which side of the newspaper
you're on. In meeting the indi
viduals who shaped these head
lines, each of us learned a little
more — and grew. And, through
all the turmoil, it was still exhil
arating.
The intensity outside these
walls resonated inside as well,
kicking up the typically com
bustible stress-level of a news
room by a few more notches. And
there were plenty of times when I
didn't know how much more we
could take.
As editor, I've observed a cam
pus struggle with change as it
came alive from a "hibernation
period." And I've felt the burst of
energy that comes with such a
reawakening. I have dealt with

my fair share of irate readers and
staff members. And I've been
proud, disappointed, angered,
saddened, and sometimes ready to
throw my hands up in the air in
defeat.
My most important lesson
from all this: Just keep talking.
It was when people stopped talk
ing (and listening) that conflicts
became magnified or suddenly
urgent, turning this campus into
a battle zone, and this over
stressed office into a different
sort of war room.
Overall, what's happened these
last four months has been an
interesting and intense experi
ence for the entire community.
What's left is a broader perspec
tive and a more focused energy. Is
the idealism still there? Yes, but
it's likely more tempered.
I am still amazed at how quick
ly time has passed, how drastical
ly our goals shifted in the after
math of each crisis, and how easi
ly we regrouped. Just in time for
the next crisis.
While I catch my breath for a
moment, I am in awe that we —
both the campus and the news
room — have survived.
Thanks to all my co-workers —
especially the demanding ones.
Late nights, high stress, explosive
arguments and even the cheap
take-out Chinese food have taken
their toll.
Still, I wouldn't trade my days
in the war room for anything.
When I return to student life next
year, I'll be bringing back with me
a wealth of experience and a stom
ach of steel, and hopefully leaving
behind just as much.
As backwardly optimistic as it
may seem, it's the hardships that
have made my experience as edi
tor so invaluable — I'm now thor
oughly convinced that what
doesn't kill you only makes you
stronger.
