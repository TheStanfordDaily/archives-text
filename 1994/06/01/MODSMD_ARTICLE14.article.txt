## Finally homeward bound 
### 
CALIFORNIA, HERE I come.
Though I can hardly believe it, my
plane ticket tells me that in two
weeks I will be in the Bay Area and
Oxford and England will soon be distant
memory of a short six-month span of my
life.
No more greasy smells wafting from
Doner Kebab Vans (the British equiva
lent to a hot-dog stand from hell, road
kill-like meat and "garlic mayonnaise"
included) as I walk down High Street.
The sun will seem obscenely bright and
people will be wearing colors. I'll proba
bly get hit by a car because I'll cross the
street looking the wrong way.
How strange it will be to return to
Stanford and sit in a large lecture class
again after Oxford's weekly one-on-one
tutorials. While the diversity of opinions
that discussion sections offer and lighter
paper-writing load will be refreshing, I
will sorely miss the independent think
ing and individual attention tutorials
allow.
While Stanford certainly is not
imposingly gargantuan on a relative
scale of major universities, faculty and
students alike often do not realize how
easy it is to slip into anonymity in lec
ture or even large seminar classes. Now
that I have experienced and benefited
from an alternative system of teaching, I
hope I will find the time and motivation
to pursue avenues beyond mass-pro
duced education, and that the faculty I

encounter will reciprocate the effort.
On the extracurricular side of things,
I am convinced that I will never find an
American equivalent to the athletic and
social institution of rowing at Oxford.
There are many hard-working, talented
athletes in the boat clubs of the univer
sity and its 30-some colleges, but at a
school where, at my estimation, over
1,000 students are involved in rowing at
some level, the sport really becomes a
formidable social medium as well.
The Thames serves as the Oxford
equivalent to Stanford's frosh book — a
veritable traffic-jam of crews, where
rowers try to scope out the other boats
passing by while avoiding the coach or
coxswain's reprimand of, "Eyes on the
boat!"
Of course, rowing at Oxford provides
excuses to drink and boat club formal
dinners seem to epitomize the dichotomy
of Oxford students' reserved, sober
demeanor and crazy, unrestrained drunk
selves. In America there seems to be a
separation between gentility and drunk
enness — at Stanford, students may go
to a formal and get drunk afterwards.
However, Oxford's multiple-course
black-tie dinners, complete with four
fork/three-knife place settings, are
marked by food fights, paper airplanes,
drinking contests and other revelry
induced by the free-flowing sherry and
port. It's quite a departure from the
usual Stanford kegger, and the novelty

of Oxford-style carousing is tinged by
the somewhat unhealthy mentality that
drunkenness is both an aid and an
excuse for more social and/or more
stupid-than-normal behavior.
Nevertheless, what I may miss the
most is the relaxed, warm and friendly
atmosphere of English pubs — not just
the places themselves, but their reflec
tion of some of the most positive aspects
of life in this country, and in Oxford.
American bars have that seedy, dimly
lit, meat-market feel to them, while
pubs are plush and well-lit with plenty
of places to sit and talk, where parents
have no qualms about bringing young
children.
So in the fall, I will return to my
unfamiliarly familiar existence as a
Stanford student, and things will proba
bly not be that different from the way I
remember them. Nevertheless, in ways
that I have tried but never succeeded in
describing, I feel as if Oxford — the tuto
rials, the river, pubs and yes, in their
own unique way, the Doner Kebab Vans
— will be with me long after these six
months.

Although she won't admit it, Angie is
looking forward to frequenting those
Stanford keggers once again.
