## Foreign language cuts only making the weak weaker 
### 
LAST WEEK THE Daily reported how
the School of Humanities and Sci
ences recently eliminated 12 tenure
track faculty billets from its departments.
All four billets lost from the humanities
were taken from foreign language depart
ments. Senior associate dean for Humani
ties and Sciences John Etchemendy said
the decision as to which departments were
to be targeted for cuts was based "on the
strengths of the various departments,"
meaning that weaker departments were
targeted for the loss of billets.
Now look at it this way: income taxes in
North America are determined by a sys
tem in which those with the highest
incomes pay the highest taxes. Although
there are some people who might argue
that taxes should be the same for every
one, there is no one who argues that taxes
should be highest for those with the low
est incomes. However, this is precisely the
philosophy behind the removal of billets
from the French and Italian, Spanish and
Portuguese, German Studies and Slavic
Languages and Literatures Departments.
Stanford is not a liberal arts college,
nor is it an engineering institution. It is
my impression that the philosophy of this
University is to promote diversity and
breadth of knowledge. In order to make
this possible, Stanford must strive to
maintain strength across its full range of
departments instead of strengthening the
strong and weakening the weak. I chose to
come to Stanford because I did not want to

be forced onto a narrow path. I wanted to
explore a variety of academic areas. Now I
am majoring in German, and every quar
ter I am faced with the challenge of find
ing enough classes to complete my major.
There are a lot of ways to strengthen
the foreign language departments without
in any way increasing the financial drain
on the University. For instance, at a
recent dinner for undergraduate German
majors, members of the department dis
cussed strategies such as the scheduling of
German Studies classes during lunch and
in the afternoon so as to avoid scheduling
conflicts with the large number of classes
offered at 10 and 11 a.m. and 1:15 p.m.
Other suggestions included a proposal to
offer upper-division classes every other
year to maximize the variety of course
offerings from an ever more limited facul
ty and staff.
Support for strengthening the foreign
language departments must also come
from outside the departments themselves.
Such support could take the form of
increased foreign language and culture
requirements by the University. Foreign
language departments also have the
potential to serve majors from many other
departments. •
As Ralph Hester, chairman of the
French and Italian Department, suggests,
courses offered by the foreign language
departments are complementary to majors
such as history, philosophy, political sci
ence, international relations, etc. These

other departments could show their sup
port for the foreign language departments
by implementing or increasing the foreign
language and culture requirements for
their students. Hopefully, if students are
exposed to foreign language departments
through fulfilling requirements, they will
become interested in exploring those
departments further.
Perhaps what is most desperately need
ed is an understanding of the nature of
foreign language departments.
Etchemendy claims that classes of 200
"are not any more impossible in German
Studies than they are in psychology."
This is a flippant statement which
reflects an ignorance of the nature of for
eign language instruction. Psychology class
es are mostly lecture classes designed to
provide students with facts and mental
skills. Language classes are designed to pro
vide students with mental but also physical
skills, such as those involved in language
comprehension and production. The acqui
sition of these skills requires practice and
individual guidance from the instructor. In
a 50-minute class with 200 students, each
student would have 15 seconds of language
practice and instructor attention.
The proposal to combine Stanford's for
eign language departments (including clas
sics) into a single unit is further evidence
of ignorance concerning the nature of the
study of foreign languages.
Currently, the French and Italian and
the Spanish and Portuguese Departments

are combined. The basis for the combina
tion of these departments is very tenuous.
Although foreign languages often share
origins and some cultural roots, each is
unique, with its own literary and social tra
ditions. Especially in the case of the Clas
sics and Asian Language Departments, the
commonalties are virtually non-existent.
Anyone who does not recognize this does
not understand the first thing about the
study of foreign languages and cultures.
Thus the proposal to combine the foreign
language departments seems only an
excuse to further weaken them.
The only positive result of combining
the foreign language departments would
be to eliminate some administrative staff
and costs. As the already combined depart
ments demonstrate, however, the savings
are only apparent. Eliminating a position
does not eliminate the work that needs to
be done; the remaining staff is simply
forced to work harder.
I am not unaware that Stanford's
resources are limited, and that cuts of
some sort are inevitable. I believe, howev
er, that the decision to remove billets from
Stanford's foreign language departments
was an ill-informed and short-sighted
move reflecting a dangerous and narrow
minded philosophy contrary to the goals of
breadth and diversity which this Universi
ty claims to represent.

University is to promote diversity and
breadth of knowledge. In order to make
this possible, Stanford must strive to
maintain strength across its full range of
departments instead of strengthening the
strong and weakening the weak. I chose to
come to Stanford because I did not want to

be forced onto a narrow path. I wanted to
explore a variety of academic areas. Now I
am majoring in German, and every quar
ter I am faced with the challenge of find
ing enough classes to complete my major.
There are a lot of ways to strengthen
the foreign language departments without
in any way increasing the financial drain
on the University. For instance, at a
recent dinner for undergraduate German
majors, members of the department dis
cussed strategies such as the scheduling of
German Studies classes during lunch and
in the afternoon so as to avoid scheduling
conflicts with the large number of classes
offered at 10 and 11 a.m. and 1:15 p.m.
Other suggestions included a proposal to
offer upper-division classes every other
year to maximize the variety of course
offerings from an ever more limited facul
ty and staff.
Support for strengthening the foreign
language departments must also come
from outside the departments themselves.
Such support could take the form of
increased foreign language and culture
requirements by the University. Foreign
language departments also have the
potential to serve majors from many other
departments. •
As Ralph Hester, chairman of the
French and Italian Department, suggests,
courses offered by the foreign language
departments are complementary to majors
such as history, philosophy, political sci
ence, international relations, etc. These

other departments could show their sup
port for the foreign language departments
by implementing or increasing the foreign
language and culture requirements for
their students. Hopefully, if students are
exposed to foreign language departments
through fulfilling requirements, they will
become interested in exploring those
departments further.
Perhaps what is most desperately need
ed is an understanding of the nature of
foreign language departments.
Etchemendy claims that classes of 200
"are not any more impossible in German
Studies than they are in psychology."
This is a flippant statement which
reflects an ignorance of the nature of for
eign language instruction. Psychology class
es are mostly lecture classes designed to
provide students with facts and mental
skills. Language classes are designed to pro
vide students with mental but also physical
skills, such as those involved in language
comprehension and production. The acqui
sition of these skills requires practice and
individual guidance from the instructor. In
a 50-minute class with 200 students, each
student would have 15 seconds of language
practice and instructor attention.
The proposal to combine Stanford's for
eign language departments (including clas
sics) into a single unit is further evidence
of ignorance concerning the nature of the
study of foreign languages.
Currently, the French and Italian and
the Spanish and Portuguese Departments

are combined. The basis for the combina
tion of these departments is very tenuous.
Although foreign languages often share
origins and some cultural roots, each is
unique, with its own literary and social tra
ditions. Especially in the case of the Clas
sics and Asian Language Departments, the
commonalties are virtually non-existent.
Anyone who does not recognize this does
not understand the first thing about the
study of foreign languages and cultures.
Thus the proposal to combine the foreign
language departments seems only an
excuse to further weaken them.
The only positive result of combining
the foreign language departments would
be to eliminate some administrative staff
and costs. As the already combined depart
ments demonstrate, however, the savings
are only apparent. Eliminating a position
does not eliminate the work that needs to
be done; the remaining staff is simply
forced to work harder.
I am not unaware that Stanford's
resources are limited, and that cuts of
some sort are inevitable. I believe, howev
er, that the decision to remove billets from
Stanford's foreign language departments
was an ill-informed and short-sighted
move reflecting a dangerous and narrow
minded philosophy contrary to the goals of
breadth and diversity which this Universi
ty claims to represent.
