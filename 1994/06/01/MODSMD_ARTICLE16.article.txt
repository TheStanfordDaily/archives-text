# Horpel clarifies stance on vandalism of statues
## 
### 
To say the least, the "Gay Liberation"
sculpture ordeal has been an interesting
experience. I would like to set the record
straight once and for all.
Who am I and what are my values?
Am I homophobic? A bigot? Do I pro
mote these concepts as a teacher and

coach? No!
I am not the person the press has
been describing for the last two and a
half weeks. While I admit I grew up with
some prejudices, I have made a concert
ed effort in the last 20-odd years not to
be prejudiced. However, I will continue
to work on any remaining idiosyn
crasies.
I understand why some members of
the gay community feel like an attack on
these statues was an attack on them. All

the symbolism was there. What I didn't
realize was that if you didn't agree that
this crime was motivated by hate, you
would be considered a bigot. I don't
think this act was that simple.
Even though Jon Ann Steinmetz (San
Jose Mercury News reporter) took my
comments out of context and has since
apologized, I had no idea these com
ments would be perceived as condoning
this vandalism. I do not.
There have been over 20 newspaper

articles that have vilified me. However,
not one of these subsequent reporters
ever called to see if I really said these
things, and if I did, what I meant by
them. I am proud of who I am and what
I stand for. I invite anyone or any group
to get to know me. I like communication
and I mean no harm to anyone. My
office is in the basement of the Arrillaga
Family Sports Center. Please come by.
