# N'Gai Croal: fly in the buttermilk
## Buzzing into the sunset: a fly's sappy good-bye 
### 
The year according to me.
Notes of a non-native son
SEPTEMBER. 9123: "Michael and
Mel: Men without faces." Michael
Jackson legal troubles are paralleled
with the Mel Gibson film "Man Without a
Face." Media, bad. Society's prurient
interest, bad. 9/28: "Please don't waste
your time reading this column." Hype is
dead ... not. Media, bad. Society's gullibil
ity, bad.
October. 10/5: "Goodfeilas, The Joy Luck
Club and thou." An open letter to women
describing my confusion over girl movies
and guy movies. Joy Luck, bad. Gender
gap, undecided. 10/12: "Singing the prais
es of a noble Nobel prize-winner." Con
gratulates Toni Morrison; disses her
detractors, particularly the house Negroes
who run to the New York Times rather
than criticize her to her face. Morrison,
good. Stanley Crouch, bad.
10/19: "Do you know what white
racists call black Ph.D.s?" Addresses the
etymology of the word "nigger" and its
variants, "shvartze" and "jungle bunny,"
as used by Ted Danson, Whoopi Goldberg,
Jackie Mason and an NBC News produc
er. Political incorrectness, bad. Racism
disguised as political incorrectness, worse.
10/26: "How Spike and Stanford wasted
their time." Spike Lee regurgitates the
contents of his books. Stanford students
ask silly questions. ASSU pays Spike

$12,500. Spike's speech, bad. Spike's busi
ness acumen, good.
November. 11/2: "Night of the dawn of
the day of the living whiteboy." Young
white boys become the rage in Hollywood
movies as old white boys try to embrace
their inner children. Whiteboy cinema,
bad. Column on whiteboy cinema, bad.
11/9: "Men on the verge of a nervous
breakdown." Women pine over repressed
men at the cineplex; men struggle to keep
up the latest trend. Repressed cinema,
bad. Column on repressed cinema, worse.
11/16: "Jolly good horrorshow, '90s
droog-style." My explanation for having
screened "Man Bites Dog" at Flicks, a
satire of our obsession with serial killers
and reality TV. Media fixation on violence,
bad. Media fixation with media fixation on
violence, good. Interlude: N'Gai falls in
love with Ashley Judd; alas, the two are
fated to never meet again. 11/23: "Blowing
a breeze of freedom — or just breaking
wind?" Campus conservatives hold their
intelligence-free version of Woodstock to
announce the formation of "Winds of
Freedom." Winds' odor, foul. University's
anemic response to Winds, putrid.
11/30: "1-8-7 on the mass media-gangs
ta rap." Newsweek demonizes Snoop
Doggy Dogg and his fellow "gangsta rap
pers" in a vacuum, without ever address
ing the bitch-ho mentality that American
society is built on. Gangsta rap, bad. Mass

media, worse.
January. 1/4: "Spielberg's Oskar: perver
sion of the word hero?" A dissent from the
popular opinion about "Schindler's List,"
which makes a hero out of a self-serving
Nazi, turns concentration camp-Jews into
extras and fails to spark any action in
cowardly word leaders. Oskar, bad. Oscar,
inevitable. 1/11: "How to create panic in
our very own Building 10." An imaginary
open letter to Provost Rice from the Stu
dents of Color Coalition, exposing the eth
nic center budget cut charade. Budget cri
sis, false. Line-item budgets, unavailable.
1/18: "How to speak to a deaf adminis
tration." Suggests various tactics to force
the University to act on student concerns.
An unnamed, high-ranking University
official (Casper) uses a common expletive
(shit) to refer to the column. President's
verbal creativity, bad. Line-item budgets,
unavailable. 1/25: "Could lack of r-e-s-p-e
-c-t lead to a m-u-t-i-n-y?" Examines the
extreme lack of respect the administration
has for students, staff and faculty. Official
decision-making process, bad. Line-item
budgets, unavailable.
Fly in the buttermilk
February. 2/1: "Worse than food service:
a rancid media meal." Media salivates
over dollar figures in Michael Jackson set
tlement. Child's parents, greedy. Jackson,
canny. 2/8: "Farm labor: shoveling the
administration's bull." Rice plans to hold

town meetings in an attempt to pacify the
Stanford community. Administration,
slick. Line-item budgets, unavailable.
2/15: "Sleepless at Stanford: a president's
nightmare." Satire of Casper's tenure to
date in the form of a play. Fictional line
item budgets, unavailable. 2/22: "Anarchy
in the U.K. better than Made in the
U.S.A.?" Laments the decline in American
screen acting. Tom Cruise, bad. David
Thewlis, good.
March. 3/1: "A Nation of scapegoats to
hold black people back?" All black people
have to answer for Farrakhan, while all
white people aren't held accountable for
David Duke. 3/8: "Kick out white stu
dents? Aman Veijee thinks so." Verjee
goes to Ujarnaa to defend his "From the
back of the bus to the back of the class"
column. His shoddy scholarship is exposed
even as administrators remain silent. 3/29:
"History as Hollywood's victim: a post-
Oskar wrap-up." American media laud
"Schindler's List" as a "historical docu
ment" even as serious questions about its
historical accuracy are raised. Scorecard
for the month: Media, bad, bad, bad.
April. 4/5: "Drive-by firing: goodfeilas in
Bldg. 10 take aim." Cecilia Burciaga is
fired over spring break, ostensibly to save
money — yeah, right. Administration,
worse. Line-item budgets, unavailable.
4/12: Kurt Cobain dies, media spew Gen
eration X inanities in search of mo'

money. Media, bad. Cobain, R.I.P.
4119: "Pro Fros* guide to getting the scoop
on Stanford." Self-explanatory. Rice, still
black. Pro Fros, confused. 4/26: "Back to
the cradle: infantilization on the Farm."
Letter to mom about a Faculty Senate
that can't treat students, let alone fellow
faculty, like adults when it comes to
grades. Faculty, goo-goo. Students, ga-ga.
May. 5/3: "confessions of an aspiring hip
hop writer." Philosophical inquiry into
the relationship between the hip-hop aes
thetic and my writing. 5/10: "Please, be
very careful what you write about." Philo
sophical inquiry into the relationship
between writers' block and my writing.
5117: "Human remains and the true
nature of love." Philosophical inquiry into
the relationship between Brandon Lee's
death, "The Crow," and my writing. 5/24:
"Personal cowardice: the new PC at Stan
ford." Philosophical inquiry into the rela
tionship between cowardice and everyone
else's writing, after the attack on the
"Gay Liberation" statues. Philosophy,
good. Too much philosophy, Excedrin.
June. 6/1 "Buzzing into the sunset: a
fly's sappy good-bye." Mood, reflective.
Job, done. Last words, peace.
