# Tish Williams
## To the Offensivemobile—making a quick escape 
### 
I'VE CREATED A MONSTER. I was
looking to rent a room from a lovely,
white-haired woman with long-stand
ing connections to Stanford. It was a quiet
house in a quiet neighborhood, and we
would be sharing a wall for a minimum of
three quiet months. The room was pre
cious. The house was divine. Any hope of
stereo usage was shot to hell.
She politely pointed out the amenities
of the room, with its wood floors and
antique rug, linens and curtains. Politely
introduced me to the current boarder,
who had taken the code of silence to
heart, watching TV with the volume on
"mute." Politely turned to me as we
toured the back yard and looked at me
with big, gentle eyes.
"Wait, did you say 'Tish?' You're not
the Tish Williams who writes for The
Daily, are you?" I returned her kind gaze,
and quietly answered, "Me? No. Can't say
that I am."
"Oh good," she sighed.
Forgive me father, for I have sinned.
I can't believe I lied to a woman who
still uses a 1960s refrigerator. Listening to
music at an offensive level later that night,
I lamented my plight. I decided that if I

were a superhero, my mystical superpower
would be the ability to say anything, any
where, to anyone, without shame and
without regard for social norms.
Unfortunately, I could not decide
whether such powers would guarantee me
a swivel chair in front of the big-ass
telecommunications monitor in the Hall
of Justice or instead lump me with the
greasy-haired villains. Would I be a ruddy
complexioned champion of truth, justice
and the American way, cracking up Aqua
man with jokes about Wonder Woman's
cottage-cheese thighs pressing against the
seat of her invisible jet? Or would I be rap
ing and pillaging with the help of rny
wafer-thin waist and abnormally huge
breasts, casually wardrobed in a cast-iron
bra and kryptonite panties?
Holy nipple references, Batman.
Periodically taking cheap shots at the
Wonder Twins' flimsy ice bridges, I have
struggled to hone my superskills in my
human form as a Daily columnist. Geni
talia, feminine hygiene, current lust inter
ests — no subject was too base. At first
my mom complained, sobbing about the
family name. Then I started mentioning
her in all my columns. Her dissent waned.

And now as the curtain falls, I have to
look back and think what it got me. How
did it encourage my personal growth?
What did I learn?
Please hold your vomit until the end of
the ceremony.
Over the past year-and-a-half, I have
received 1,000 e-mail messages congratulat
ing me, annihilating any shred of self
esteem puberty left me and exposing the
connection between my breast fetish and
the spelling of my real name, Letitia. Over
e-mail, I willingly volunteered for 25 blind
dates, complete with Coffee House
formaldehyde pickles. Over e-mail, I rubbed
elbows with the wild and crazy guys up at
SLAC, writing on government time.
To my surprise, on Valentine's Day
"God" sent me pink carnations, with a
card announcing, "among my children,
you remain beloved." To my great for
tune, on Mother's Day, a man sent my
mom flowers, when my own intentions
had fallen short. To my chagrin, an
anonymous grad student sent me poems
written to the tune of Billy Joel songs,
condensing my columns into Top-40 form.
You had to be a big shot, din'cha?
Since the printed premier of my toothy

grin, I've given up the hope of making
good first impressions on campus, since
peoples' minds were usually solidly made
up. Given up hope of relaxing and not
playing the joker at the dinner table, in a
boring seminar class, while having sex.
Given up hope of looking over my shoul
der and finding "the Tish Williams."
Moi?
I got into the library once without
showing I.D. because the checker recog
nized me. The thrill was soon over, how
ever, as I sat down at a desk in a remote
corner of Green and the adjacent wall had
a triumphant "Tish Williams is a slut"
scrawled lovingly in permanent marker.
But I got to know the nice boys at
SURE, riding home after receiving partic
ularly ominous hate mail. After reading
one anonymous reader proclaim, "I'm
glad you're not my daughter. You certain
ly don't contribute to higher moral and
family values.... You really are scum."
Stop, you are too kind.
After admiring a computer-graphics
self-portrait from a man artfully diagram
ming how he is "hung like a horse," with
ample space-bar hyperbole. After reading
e-mail messages from men who confess

that they know where I live and have been
watching me in the dorm shower, failing
to note that I, too, know where they live
based on their e-mail addresses.
But it's the thought that counts.
And my personal favorite, the Xeroxed
scrotums sent through campus mail from
a man who is obviously bold and unoccu
pied enough to mount a poor, unsuspect
ing copy machine late at night to express
his undying devotion.
It was the very least he could do.
People honestly telling me they liked my
stuiT. People honestly asking my opinion
on things. People honestly noting, "From
the picture that goes with your column I
thought you were fat."
Flattery will get you nowhere.
It didn't get me dates. It didn't get me a
job. A little fame. A stark lack of fortune. I
don't quite know where to go from here.
This looks like job for Clitoriswoman.

Tish thanks you for your time and offers
you one last chance to get in your pot shots
before she flits away from campus forever.
