# Students question administration's commitment
## Committees created to look at ethnic studies get underway 
### Michael Slemmer Editorial staff 
The administration is well on
its way to forming two committees
created in response to the out
pouring of student support for in
terdisciplinary programs in Asian-
American and Chicano Studies.
But the quick response has left
some students wondering
whether their opinions will be lost
in the rush to implement what
they believe to be much-needed
additions to the curriculum.
In particular, students who
met with Dean of Humanities and
Sciences John Shoven last Friday
and yesterday to discuss the

prospects for an Asian-American
Studies program say they felt he
wanted to retain full control over
the process.
"[Shoven] wants to select the
people for the committee. . . . It's
his advisory body," said Lok Siu, a
graduate student in anthropology
who was present at both meetings.
"He wants to be in control of all
levels of decision making."
Shoven could not be reached
last night for comment on the
method of the committee's forma
tion.
According to Siu, the commit
tee's final makeup is still tenta
tive, but it should contain 10
members â€” at least one of whom

will be a representative of the stu
dent group supporting the pro
gram's creation.
Currently, she said, the group
is planning on nominating three
undergraduates and three gradu
ate students for the available posi
tions. Although they have already
considered some applicants for the
committee openings, "we're open
ing up the process again to get
more candidates," Siu said. "We
will provide the list of names, a
short description for [Shoven] to
make the final selection."
But it is this very process that
Siu said worries the students
