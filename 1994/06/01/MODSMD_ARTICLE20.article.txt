## Gay-bashing incident cannot not be ignored 
### 
While driving on Campus Drive on
May 6, three youths riding alongside me
harassed me and repeatedly threw
objects at my windshield. They clearly
sought to intimidate me, and I feared
the possibility of a car crash involving
me, them and other motorists. I have no
doubt that I was singled out because I
was perceived to be gay, and that homo
phobic hatred fueled these youths'
actions.
The Stanford administration has
acted inadequately to protect my physi
cal safety on campus. I called the Stan
ford police on May 7, and informed the
president's office and much of the Stan
ford administration in a letter on May
11. Stanford Police Deputy Sharon Mar
tinez and Detective Mark Swineford
have shown great responsibility and
thoroughness in investigating my case. I
find their actions remarkable, given my
previous experience with violently
homophobic police officers elsewhere.
I have repeatedly gone to the presi
dent's office and the sexual harassment
coordinator to seek University condem
nation of what occurred. Instead of
releasing a short public statement,
administrators have preferred to lecture

me about "due process," "pre-judging,"
etc. I do not understand why these
administrators cannot publicly recog
nize that anti-queer violence occurs on
Stanford campus and threatens Stan
ford students and employees. What pre
vents the Stanford administration from
taking action to stop hate-motivated
violence?
The administration's inaction con
tributes to an already hostile environ
ment on campus. The administration
would like to treat what happened to me
as an aberration and one which is the
sole responsibility of the police. The
University's negligence follows the
administration's and The Daily's insis
tence that the recent attack on the "Gay
Liberation" sculpture constituted "van
dalism" of University property. Why
can't these authorities tell the truth
about anti-queer violence and intimida
tion?
Several administrators seemed very
relieved when the police informed them
last week that the suspects in my case
may be non-students. While this may be
good news for Stanford's public rela
tions, the affiliation or non-affiliation of
my assailants in no way changes my sit
uation: I remain a Stanford student and
employee who has serious doubts about
physical safety on Stanford property.
Stanford must recognize that anti
queer violence on campus, if condoned

by the University, violates their
rhetoric of "diversity and multicultural
ism," not to mention basic civil rights. I
hope the University will end its silence
and join me in my efforts to prosecute
my assailants to the fullest extent pos
sible under state and federal law. The
University administration has the
power to:
• release public statements condemn
ing anti-queer violence, signed by the
highest administrators, including Uni
versity President Gerhard Casper;
• allocate financial resources to edu
cate Stanford students and staff about
anti-queer violence;
• notify every member of Stanford
about specific procedures to follow if
they are assaulted on campus;
• punish students, faculty and staff
who physically assault and intimidate
queers on campus;
• make available its fine lawyers to
aggressively pursue all judicial actions
against perpetrators of homophobic vio
lence and intimidation on campus.
I trust the University will change its
position and make themselves responsi
ble to queer as well as straight students
and employees. If not, I will join many
other queer graduate students in seek
ing future employment off Stanford
campus while completing my degree.
