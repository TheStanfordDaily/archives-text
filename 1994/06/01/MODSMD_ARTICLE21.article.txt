# Gay sculpture vandals should be re-integrated
## 
### 
The recent irresponsible action of a
handful of undergraduates who vandal
ized the "Gay Liberation" sculpture has
caused great anguish to the entire
Stanford community, but particularly
to gays and lesbians, for whom the
symbolism of the event was even more
important than the physical damage.
In consequence there have been calls
for stern action and retribution. Yet
there remains uncertainty as to the
appropriate response by the University.
Two different courses present them
selves. One would treat the students as
criminals, whose lives and actions are
utterly alien to us. If so, they deserve the
severest punishment: criminal indict
ments, arrest, fines and expulsion. How
ever, such vehemence in response to a
first offense would further polarize the
Stanford community, angering many and
attracting unwelcome national media
attention. Witness the San Francisco
State-Malcolm X mural controversy.
An alternative option would identify
the action as a rude, hostile and painful
intrusion into the civility owed by all
students to their college, community
and neighbors. But it would retain the
opportunity of reconciliation. After all,

if we cheer these youths as athletes, sit
next to them in class and eat with them
in dining halls, should we withhold the
opportunity from them to express
remorse and to take responsibility for
their actions? If, in fact, they are us,
then they should each be given the
chance to rejoin the community.
This course would be entirely consis
tent with the benevolence exercised by
Stanford's previous administration,
which moved as swiftly and privately as
possible to rehabilitate administrators
and faculty charged with far more scan
dalous violations.
My own suggestion is that we accept
from these students: 1) a sincere public
apology; 2) an offer to make financial resti
tution for damage done; and 3) commit
ment to accept responsibility for the
integrity of the sculpture for the next year.
All this in return for a moratorium on
sensationalism, unnecessary publicity,
scapegoating of the associations to which
these individuals belong, and a withdrawal
of civil charges against them. If they don't
make amends, they mark themselves as
yahoos who have no place in the University.
We gain far more by demonstrating
how promptly and successfully Stan
ford re-integrates these members of our
community than we do by ostracizing
and demonizing them.
