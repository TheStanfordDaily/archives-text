# Technology: Toward the virtual classroom
## Growing trend in courses on Farm 
### 
IT MIGHT not have been obvious until recently, but
changing technology has always played a significant
role in teaching. And although most lecture halls and
seminar rooms at Stanford still sport chalkboards, desks
and living, breathing professors, the University remains
on the leading edge of use of technology in the classroom.

Some so-called "techie" classes — like introductory
computer science courses — are broadcast live to dor
mitories and even student rooms via the Stanford
Instructional Television Network (SITN), which com
prises several channels on Stanford cable. Even if stu
dents attend the class, they can record the lecture for
later review of areas that they may not have
understood the first time around.

Classroom use of technology isn't neces
sarily so complicated — or so obvious.
More and more classes require students
to have electronic mail accounts for
better communication among
instructors and students outside of

class meetings. And some classes
are starting to take advantage
of the Stanford computer net
work (SUNet) in homework
assignments and other forms of
study.
As Stanford moves toward
wiring the entire campus with
video and digital communica
tions, more and more classes
are sure to follow the trend of
taking advantage of the
advanced technology
offered. The Commission
on Undergraduate Educa
tion has realized the issue's
significance, creating the
Techniques and Technology
in Teaching and Learning
subcommittee to examine its
future role.
Although some remain
wary of the intrusion of
technology into the class
room, few will deny that it
will inevitably play a bigger
role in education in the
future.
