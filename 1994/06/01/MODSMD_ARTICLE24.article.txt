						mixed bag: possibilities and concerns

INFORMATION technologies
— computers, video, telecom
munications — seem to pop up
everywhere at Stanford. As
incoming frosh, you register at a
terminal and take placement tests
on-line. You check your grades on
Axess, find library materials on

Socrates, buy and sell things on
Folio and keep in touch using elec
tronic mail. You write papers with
a word processor and solve math
problems with a computer or cal
culator. Your residence has a com
puting cluster and you may have a
high speed network connection in
your room. Public computing
clusters spring up on the campus
like mushrooms after a rain, and
new classrooms sprout video mon
itors from their ceilings and
microphones from their seat
backs.
Now, University President
Gerhard Casper has announced a
new Committee on Techniques
and Technology in Teaching and
Learning. Where will it all end?
With students and faculty hud

died over their machines, mouse
potatoes zoning in a virtual uni
versity? As a Stanford student and
prospective alum, should you
worry about how technology may
affect the quality of education at
Stanford?
Information technology is sure
ly one of the momentous develop
ments of our era and a big reason
why the next few decades are like
ly to be interesting times for high
er education. Although it can't
compete with war, famine, pesti
lence and disease — or even hate,
crime and drugs — the prolifera
tion of technology in education is
at least as likely to shake up Stan
ford as the Big One. I'm not clair
voyant, but some of the possibili
ties for good and ill technology
presents seem pretty clear. Here
are a few that intrigue me:
First, I wouldn't lower my
endorphins worrying about the
possibility of facing computers
instead of humans in your Stan
ford courses. Yes, you will be able
to take some highly technical
courses on-line, but you would
have had little human contact
with that professor anyway, and

you'd probably rather watch such
lectures on tape, lying down,
remote in hand. . . .
Courses where you meet and
talk with the professor and where
the professor's style and personal
ity are important will continue to
be offered because they will still be
in demand. A rock star's record
ings do not drive down fans'
demand for live concerts, and
whatever a professor may do elec
tronically will not drive down the
demand for live teaching, either.
On the contrary, those who have
played the professor's simulation
game will be all the more eager to
study with him or her here on
campus.
Don't worry about regimenta
tion, either. If it were possible to
use this technology to regiment
people, totalitarian regimes would
be doling it out instead of arresting
people for having it.
Here's something I would
worry about: overwork. You spent
a good deal of your childhood
learning to use letters and num
bers. Now, using information
technology, you can represent
knowledge in many more forms —

sounds, images, movies, models of
anything, computer programs, to
mention only a few. And you can
rearrange and re-represent these
things in any possible way as fast
as your body or mind will go.
So now you're not only writing
papers and solving math prob
lems, you're also analyzing data;
making videos; using, developing,
and testing computer models; and
designing things. You've got more
channels to express yourself, but
it takes more time and effort to
develop fluency with more symbol
systems.
Here's another worry worth
your time: burn-out from con
fronting too much reality too
soon. With the help of technology
you can apply powerful symbolic
forms of analysis to more complex
situations than the toy problems
in textbooks. Thus, professors will
be more able to bring into your
courses the real problems of
research, scholarship and creative
invention that make them leaders
in their fields, and you will be able
to study more significant and
