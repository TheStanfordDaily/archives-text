# A 						mixed bag: possibilities and concerns
## Technology won't cut demand for top profs—but may drown students with work 
### 
INFORMATION technologies
— computers, video, telecom
munications — seem to pop up
everywhere at Stanford. As
incoming frosh, you register at a
terminal and take placement tests
on-line. You check your grades on
Axess, find library materials on

Decker Walker

Socrates, buy and sell things on
Folio and keep in touch using elec
tronic mail. You write papers with
a word processor and solve math
problems with a computer or cal
culator. Your residence has a com
puting cluster and you may have a
high speed network connection in
your room. Public computing
clusters spring up on the campus
like mushrooms after a rain, and
new classrooms sprout video mon
itors from their ceilings and
microphones from their seat
backs.
Now, University President
Gerhard Casper has announced a
new Committee on Techniques
and Technology in Teaching and
Learning. Where will it all end?
With students and faculty hud

died over their machines, mouse
potatoes zoning in a virtual uni
versity? As a Stanford student and
prospective alum, should you
worry about how technology may
affect the quality of education at
Stanford?
Information technology is sure
ly one of the momentous develop
ments of our era and a big reason
why the next few decades are like
ly to be interesting times for high
er education. Although it can't
compete with war, famine, pesti
lence and disease — or even hate,
crime and drugs — the prolifera
tion of technology in education is
at least as likely to shake up Stan
ford as the Big One. I'm not clair
voyant, but some of the possibili
ties for good and ill technology
presents seem pretty clear. Here
are a few that intrigue me:
First, I wouldn't lower my
endorphins worrying about the
possibility of facing computers
instead of humans in your Stan
ford courses. Yes, you will be able
to take some highly technical
courses on-line, but you would
have had little human contact
with that professor anyway, and

you'd probably rather watch such
lectures on tape, lying down,
remote in hand. . . .
Courses where you meet and
talk with the professor and where
the professor's style and personal
ity are important will continue to
be offered because they will still be
in demand. A rock star's record
ings do not drive down fans'
demand for live concerts, and
whatever a professor may do elec
tronically will not drive down the
demand for live teaching, either.
On the contrary, those who have
played the professor's simulation
game will be all the more eager to
study with him or her here on
campus.
Don't worry about regimenta
tion, either. If it were possible to
use this technology to regiment
people, totalitarian regimes would
be doling it out instead of arresting
people for having it.
Here's something I would
worry about: overwork. You spent
a good deal of your childhood
learning to use letters and num
bers. Now, using information
technology, you can represent
knowledge in many more forms —

sounds, images, movies, models of
anything, computer programs, to
mention only a few. And you can
rearrange and re-represent these
things in any possible way as fast
as your body or mind will go.
So now you're not only writing
papers and solving math prob
lems, you're also analyzing data;
making videos; using, developing,
and testing computer models; and
designing things. You've got more
channels to express yourself, but
it takes more time and effort to
develop fluency with more symbol
systems.
Here's another worry worth
your time: burn-out from con
fronting too much reality too
soon. With the help of technology
you can apply powerful symbolic
forms of analysis to more complex
situations than the toy problems
in textbooks. Thus, professors will
be more able to bring into your
courses the real problems of
research, scholarship and creative
invention that make them leaders
in their fields, and you will be able
to study more significant and
timely issues in more depth and
detail. An exciting prospect, but
also a daunting one.
Future generations of Stan
ford students may envy you what
may seem to them the luxury you
have of time for reading, disin
terested reflection, and discus
sion about abstract ideas at a
human pace in the tranquillity of
the ivory tower while they will be
immersed in the murky, unstable
complexities, moral ambiguities,
brutal pace and rude surprises of
life outside the Farm.
Worry a little about dragging
professors down off their

pedestals. You may find that you
know more than the professor
about how to use the latest pow
erful application. You may even
find that you pick up this kind of
knowledge and skill faster than
the professor. It is hard enough
for the professor to face this fact,
but the results can be devastat
ing if either of you concludes that
this failure to be omniscient or
omnicompetent somehow
demeans or devalues the profes
sor's knowledge or expertise. You
and the professor must figure
out how to combine your
strengths to advance everyone's
knowledge. You may well find
yourself playing the role of com
puter expert in a class project or
on the professor's research team.
(Don't look back, though. Some

high school kid may be gaining
on you.)
I'd worry about the possibility
that Stanford may not be able to
keep up with the accelerating
pace in many fields where infor
mation technology is central.
The time could come when the
faculty at Motorola U. are ahead
of the Stanford faculty in signifi
cant areas of research. They pay
better and they have better facil
ities.
I'd worry, too, about drowning
in knowledge and information.
Stanford students are accus
tomed to having ready access to
the world's storehouse of knowl
edge by way of the Stanford
libraries. If we all play our cards
right, you and your successors
should have ever wider and more

complete access to an expanding
universe of knowledge and infor
mation accessible via a global
network. Omniscience will still
be far out of reach, however, as
you struggle to navigate that
universe, find the needle you
need, and cope with error, uncer
tainty and rapid obsolescence in
the knowledge base.
If we don't play our cards
right, you'll be able to worry
about even more interesting
problems, like knowledge cartels,
intellectual espionage, a perma
nent underclass of the knowl
edge-deprived and knowledge
serving as the chief weapon in
war, both the bloody kind and
the "merely" economic war.
My own worst worry is that
the widespread use of informa

tion technology in education may
encourage a narrowly technical
attitude toward people and edu
cation, the attitude that Lewis
Mumford called "the
mechanomorphism of man." But
even here I am encouraged by
the triumph of human qualities
over the technical in such earlier
communications technologies as
the telephone and TV. (I didn't
say the best human qualities.)
Is it worth it, then? There is
room for debate. I am confident,
perhaps unrealistically so, that
we in higher education can wrest
more good than ill from the pos
sibilities presented by this tech
nology. Even if we succeed,
though, information technology
will still pose serious challenges
to the centuries-old traditions of

higher education, and these chal
lenges are sure to lead to contro
versy and probably to institu
tional conflict and instability.
Is it worth it for you? Here's a
litmus test: If your use of tech
nology at Stanford does not
enhance your powers of under
standing and creation, if you
don't experience from using it
the same kinds of exhilaration
you've gotten from reading great
literature, putting a subtle
thought in writing, solving a dif
ficult problem, or understanding
a powerful idea, then you should
worry about the effect of technol
ogy on the quality of education at
Stanford.

Is it worth it for you? Here's a
litmus test: If your use of tech
nology at Stanford does not
enhance your powers of under
standing and creation, if you
don't experience from using it
the same kinds of exhilaration
you've gotten from reading great
literature, putting a subtle
thought in writing, solving a dif

a powerful idea, then you should
worry about the effect of technol

Stanford.

INFORMATION technologies
— computers, video, telecom
munications — seem to pop up
everywhere at Stanford. As
incoming frosh, you register at a
terminal and take placement tests
on-line. You check your grades on
Axess, find library materials on

Decker Walker

Socrates, buy and sell things on
Folio and keep in touch using elec
tronic mail. You write papers with
a word processor and solve math
problems with a computer or cal
culator. Your residence has a com
puting cluster and you may have a
high speed network connection in
your room. Public computing
clusters spring up on the campus
like mushrooms after a rain, and
new classrooms sprout video mon
itors from their ceilings and
microphones from their seat
backs.
Now, University President
Gerhard Casper has announced a
new Committee on Techniques
and Technology in Teaching and
Learning. Where will it all end?
With students and faculty hud

died over their machines, mouse
potatoes zoning in a virtual uni
versity? As a Stanford student and
prospective alum, should you
worry about how technology may
affect the quality of education at
Stanford?
Information technology is sure
ly one of the momentous develop
ments of our era and a big reason
why the next few decades are like
ly to be interesting times for high
er education. Although it can't
compete with war, famine, pesti
lence and disease — or even hate,
crime and drugs — the prolifera
tion of technology in education is
at least as likely to shake up Stan
ford as the Big One. I'm not clair
voyant, but some of the possibili
ties for good and ill technology
presents seem pretty clear. Here
are a few that intrigue me:
First, I wouldn't lower my
endorphins worrying about the
possibility of facing computers
instead of humans in your Stan
ford courses. Yes, you will be able
to take some highly technical
courses on-line, but you would
have had little human contact
with that professor anyway, and

you'd probably rather watch such
lectures on tape, lying down,
remote in hand. . . .
Courses where you meet and
talk with the professor and where
the professor's style and personal
ity are important will continue to
be offered because they will still be
in demand. A rock star's record
ings do not drive down fans'
demand for live concerts, and
whatever a professor may do elec
tronically will not drive down the
demand for live teaching, either.
On the contrary, those who have
played the professor's simulation
game will be all the more eager to
study with him or her here on
campus.
Don't worry about regimenta
tion, either. If it were possible to
use this technology to regiment
people, totalitarian regimes would
be doling it out instead of arresting
people for having it.
Here's something I would
worry about: overwork. You spent
a good deal of your childhood
learning to use letters and num
bers. Now, using information
technology, you can represent
knowledge in many more forms —

sounds, images, movies, models of
anything, computer programs, to
mention only a few. And you can
rearrange and re-represent these
things in any possible way as fast
as your body or mind will go.
So now you're not only writing
papers and solving math prob
lems, you're also analyzing data;
making videos; using, developing,
and testing computer models; and
designing things. You've got more
channels to express yourself, but
it takes more time and effort to
develop fluency with more symbol
systems.
Here's another worry worth
your time: burn-out from con
fronting too much reality too
soon. With the help of technology
you can apply powerful symbolic
forms of analysis to more complex
situations than the toy problems
in textbooks. Thus, professors will
be more able to bring into your
courses the real problems of
research, scholarship and creative
invention that make them leaders
in their fields, and you will be able
to study more significant and
timely issues in more depth and
detail. An exciting prospect, but
also a daunting one.
Future generations of Stan
ford students may envy you what
may seem to them the luxury you
have of time for reading, disin
terested reflection, and discus
sion about abstract ideas at a
human pace in the tranquillity of
the ivory tower while they will be
immersed in the murky, unstable
complexities, moral ambiguities,
brutal pace and rude surprises of
life outside the Farm.
Worry a little about dragging
professors down off their

pedestals. You may find that you
know more than the professor
about how to use the latest pow
erful application. You may even
find that you pick up this kind of
knowledge and skill faster than
the professor. It is hard enough
for the professor to face this fact,
but the results can be devastat
ing if either of you concludes that
this failure to be omniscient or
omnicompetent somehow
demeans or devalues the profes
sor's knowledge or expertise. You
and the professor must figure
out how to combine your
strengths to advance everyone's
knowledge. You may well find
yourself playing the role of com
puter expert in a class project or
on the professor's research team.
(Don't look back, though. Some

high school kid may be gaining
on you.)
I'd worry about the possibility
that Stanford may not be able to
keep up with the accelerating
pace in many fields where infor
mation technology is central.
The time could come when the
faculty at Motorola U. are ahead
of the Stanford faculty in signifi
cant areas of research. They pay
better and they have better facil
ities.
I'd worry, too, about drowning
in knowledge and information.
Stanford students are accus
tomed to having ready access to
the world's storehouse of knowl
edge by way of the Stanford
libraries. If we all play our cards
right, you and your successors
should have ever wider and more

complete access to an expanding
universe of knowledge and infor
mation accessible via a global
network. Omniscience will still
be far out of reach, however, as
you struggle to navigate that
universe, find the needle you
need, and cope with error, uncer
tainty and rapid obsolescence in
the knowledge base.
If we don't play our cards
right, you'll be able to worry
about even more interesting
problems, like knowledge cartels,
intellectual espionage, a perma
nent underclass of the knowl
edge-deprived and knowledge
serving as the chief weapon in
war, both the bloody kind and
the "merely" economic war.
My own worst worry is that
the widespread use of informa

tion technology in education may
encourage a narrowly technical
attitude toward people and edu
cation, the attitude that Lewis
Mumford called "the
mechanomorphism of man." But
even here I am encouraged by
the triumph of human qualities
over the technical in such earlier
communications technologies as
the telephone and TV. (I didn't
say the best human qualities.)
Is it worth it, then? There is
room for debate. I am confident,
perhaps unrealistically so, that
we in higher education can wrest
more good than ill from the pos
sibilities presented by this tech
nology. Even if we succeed,
though, information technology
will still pose serious challenges
to the centuries-old traditions of

higher education, and these chal
lenges are sure to lead to contro
versy and probably to institu
tional conflict and instability.
Is it worth it for you? Here's a
litmus test: If your use of tech
