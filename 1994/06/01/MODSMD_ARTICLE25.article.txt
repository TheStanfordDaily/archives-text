# Transforming the lecture, improving teaching
## 
### 
OF THE MANY supposed promises
technology holds for education, the one
most often cited is the potential for
increase in efficiency. I hold that it is not effi
ciency that is the true promise, but the poten
tial for a significant increase in meaningful
student/teacher contact. And technology shall
accomplish this by bringing about a funda
mental transformation of that archaic,
though eminently efficient, form of instruc
tion: the lecture.
The reason the lecture has been the domi
nant form of instruction has not been because

of its pedagogic merits (one would be hard
pressed to list them) but from its sheer effi
ciency, motivated by the simple realization
that if one talks louder, more people can hear.
Technology has hitherto just reinforced this
point. The microphone allows one to talk
louder still, without straining the voice. The
overhead projector allows one to give the same
lecture again and again without having to
write the board anew each time. And, ulti
mately, the televised classroom (that favorite
tool of the School of Engineering) prevents
one from having to build larger rooms to
accommodate more students.
No one would call any of these advances
pedagogically significant. In fact, if one exam
ines the history of the lecture one finds it born
out of demands for efficiency. Lectures histor
ically involved the reading out of books so that
students could copy them down. It occupies

more the role of printing than of pedagogy.
It is only now, with the development of
multimedia computers, that technology can
transform the lecture in an educationally sig
nificant way: by eliminating the lecturer. The
lecturer is the weakest aspect of the form
because the lecturer, having only one voice,
must speak to the class as a whole, and there
fore must necessarily be unresponsive to the
individual concerns of the students. The lec
turer must surmise what the class knows and
make a decision concerning the depth and con
tent that will be enforced on everyone, even if
this choice is optimal for no one. How much
better if the lecturer could address each stu
dent individually, find out what that student
does or does not know, and proceed appropri
ately in each cacc to maximize the benefits
derived by that student.
But this is exactly what is possible today
using standard computer technology. For a
given subject, one can produce different lec
tures presenting the material at different lev
els of abstraction. One can also produce sup
plementary lectures which present outside
material as needed and follow-up lectures
which represent material in more detail. The
actual segments a student sees will depend on
what that student knows already and how
quickly he or she can master the material.
By replacing the human lecturer with a
carefully constructed set of computer-based,
interactive recorded lectures, one is able to
pitch the level of the material and the pace of
the class to the individual level of each stu
dent. In this way. all students in a class are

able to work at the level of their ability and
thereby gain the most from the class. In addi
tion to this sensitivity to differences in level
and pace, computer-based lectures also allow
for the recognition of differences in learning
styles and preferences. The technology allows
students to modify parameters such as the
gender of the lecturer, the language spoken or
even the speed at which the lecturer speaks,
easily accommodating different learning
styles.
Another advantage of computer-based lec
tures is one inherent in recorded media. One
can hear lectures given by someone who has a
talent for lecturing, and does not have to make
do with the local talent. One of the least pleas
ant experiences I have had during my time at
Stanford is watching a professor — who clear
ly knows his subject as well as anyone else in
the world — panic when confronted with a
large lecture hall. More often than not, the
result is not a brilliant lecture but rather an
almost inaudible hum. By reducing the
instructor-student ratio during the time of
recording and by taking advantage of tech
nology when producing the lecture, one can
ensure that those who are ultimately in
attendance do not suffer through a bad
lecture.
The most important pedagogic benefit
derived from replacing the human-deliv
ered lecture with its adaptive comput
erized counterpart is that by freeing
instructors from having to spend so I
much time lecturing (and, in
some cases, preparing for lec
tures), it becomes possible for
them to actually spend their time
actively teaching students. Once
lecturing is automated, teaching
replaces lecturing as the natural
activity of professors.
For example, take a lecture class
that meets three times a week with
50 students, and to which the
instructor devotes one hour per
week to preparation. If the lectures
were put on-line, the instructor
could use the four hours to meet
with students in small groups. This

would give students who needed
extra attention — or students who
were particularly interested in the
material — significantly more
meaningful interaction with the
instructor without any extra work
having to be done.
There is one problem that doing
away with lectures poses to instruc
tors, however: they will no longer
be able to lean on prepared lectures
and say the same thing year in and
year out, expecting the pieces to be
picked up by course assistants or by
prepared answer material supplied
by textbook authors. By automat
ing the elementary aspects of a
course, one leaves the human
instructor to deal with the difficult
aspects, providing answers that the
computer can not.

Eliminating lectures will force
instructors to be ready to talk to
students, to diagnose specific
areas of misunderstanding and to
help students overcome them. In
other words, technology would
help them to actually teach.
Whether or not the instructors of
today are ready for this constant
work remains to be seen.
Nor will the students escape
the burden of having to work. The
elimination of the static lecture
structure will, if anything, require
that students assume more
responsibility for their education
and for wise budgeting of time
than they currently do. If lectures
are interactive and adaptive, one
cannot show up to one's 9 a.m.
with the intention of sleeping

until 9:50 and hope to get through
the course. (In fact one will not
need to show up to one's 9 a.m. at
all, since the lectures would be
available on-line at any time.)
But the lecture must be lis
tened to eventually, and evidence
of understanding must be given
before one is permitted to proceed
in the course. Students who leave
their work until the last week of
classes will find the task of catch
ing up at the last minute far more
daunting than before, and, in this
way, yet another college tradition
may come to an end.
