# Opening up more learning methods
## Students can take over their education 
### 
UNTIL THE early 1980s the
chalk board reigned
supreme in the foreign lan
guage classroom along with lec
ture notes and textbooks — a
happy and sometimes question
able trio dedicated to the impart
ing and assimilating of knowl
edge, with teachers vigorously in
control of their subject matter
and of students as well. Careful
division of textbooks and syllabi
into manageable chunks per
semester or quarter produced
courses with well-defined con-

John Barson

tent. Final exams were construct
ed to ensure that material was
absorbed. In the field of foreign
language teaching, succeeding
waves of methodologies — rang
ing from grammar-translation to
behaviorist approaches, skill-get
ting/skill-using methods to more
communication-centered models
of recent years washed over the
country, leaving in their wake the
resurgent hope of significant
innovation, capable of helping
students to accomplish that
rarest of feats — to don, reptilian
like, the linguistic skin of a lan
guage and culture foreign to their
own.
Learning as process
Becoming "other" is not easily
achieved. Understanding and
assimilating "foreigness"
requires relinquishing, often with
considerable discomfort, the
notion that one's native language
perception of reality — for lan
guage does in fact create reality —
is not an absolute but a system
among others. Acquiring another
language and culture results in a
heightened level of self-percep
tion — mind-bending activity tak
ing place over time and not neces
sarily related to the myriad gram
mar and vocabulary "practice
routines" of traditional language
learning.
More to the point is engaging
students, working either individ
ually or collaboratively, in goal
oriented activities — an approach
applicable to many disciplines.
This enables students to discover
their aims and grow into a sense
of their social identity. When
accomplished in foreign language,
these transactions become an
instrument of management and
of self-discovery.
The role of technology
By placing tools at our dispos
al, technology is prodigious in its
ability to support humanistic and
scientific endeavor. Network
access to information and its sup
port of interpersonal exchange
are making a quantum leap in the
delivery of education in America.
The dissemination of word, pic
ture and sound in all of their
hypertext and multimedia dimen
sions is literally creating a new
reality — a reality that will be
shaped by the current and future
generations of students. Since
these powerful tools have enor
mous potential for delivery of
information — in many way rival
ing the invention of the printing
press — teachers will have to re
think the delivery of subject spe
cific information. The instrumen
tality of computer tools when
placed in the hands of creative
users is primary. A quick glance
at Portfolio at Stanford or the
World Wide Web (via Mosaic) con
firms that needed information is
likely to be found either on a local
or global network somewhere.
Students in charge
When students take over and
assume responsibility for their
education, in collaboration with
teacher-mentors, exhilarating
happenings occur. In language
classes, news magazines can be
written and illustrated either
locally or in collaboration with
other universities as in the Har
vard-Stanford e-mail and newspa
per writing experiments in
French (1988 to present). Video
documentaries can be made, plays
scripted, costumed fl
and 111

filmed, songs composed and per
formed, food prepared and
enjoyed, music played or sung,
ideas and interpretations of poli
tics, economics, and literature
shared. Letters can be written to
a prisoner of conscience in Moroc
co, serving a 10-year term for his
political beliefs. Could any simu
lation rival the wave of empathy
and sympathy triggered by such
an exchange when the prisoner's
answer arrives — months later
— a hand-penned letter in an
envelope bearing stamps from
"Le Royaume du Maroc"?
In a lighter vein, but no less
educational, game shows such as
"Jeopardie Francaise" can be cre
ated and played. Or, using tele
conferencing studios, classes
thousands of miles apart can talk
to each other. Just this quarter,
in a collaboration with Carnegie
Mellon, students prepared and,
after an initial getting-acquainted
teleconferencing session, present
ed documentary videos of their
respective campuses. The CMU
students took delight in watching,
on their screens, the Stanford
students viewing the televised
CMU videos and then engaging in
comments and questions. The
documentary film made by the
Stanford French class, digitized
and spliced using Adobe Pre
miere, will be available for its
grande premiere on final exam
day.
In a project-oriented perspec
tive such as this, even exams are
redefined, becoming a community
viewing of work accomplished,
such as student video presenta
tions, talks, performance of
music, recitation of poetry and
discussion of selected readings,
world problems, or even local
issues. This quarter, some stu
dents opted to write a newspaper.
With the assistance of PageMak
er, a formatting tool, they will dis
tribute their publication — titled
"La folle salamandre" — to their
Stanford classmates and mail
copies to CMU to complete the
long-distance exchange between
students initially having made
acquaintance using e-mail.
Endless variety becomes the
norm. No two courses can be
alike, and the agenda of a class
hour is frequently unpredictable.
A grammar review session can
turn into a discussion about
preparing a dramatic reading of
excerpts from "Le Petit Prince,"
another example of student enter
prise manifesting itself this
spring. If a teacher — prepared to
go with the flow — simply states
"Surprise me," unpredictable cre
ative energy will animate a group
of motivated students.
Students have access to video
segmenting tools, digitizing
equipment, QuickTime movies,
and multimedia display software
in their efforts to achieve new
forms of thought. These generic
tools can as easily be adapted to
language learning purposes as to
other fields. Students' infinitely
varied productions — using appli
cations such as Adobe Premiere,
HyperCard, PageMaker, Photo
shop, Stay Tooned for the manip
ulation of text, sound, graphics,
and video — are conducted in the
foreign language under study and
inevitably attract the requisite
language skills for their realiza
tion.
E-mail, without encroaching
on the value of face-to-face con
tact through lectures, discus
sions, and individual conferences,
constantly provides communica
tion between students and teach
er. Instructors espousing this
new configuration must consider
relinquishing some of their
prominence in front of the class in
order to support, as coaches, stu
dent-driven projects. On the edu
cational stage of collective
endeavor, everyone is a team
player.
The electronic classroom
With overhead projection of

computer terminals, a beginning
language class can literally talk
and write itself into existence, its
daily evolution captured and
turned into narrative, displayed
in front of the class as infinitely
malleable text or hypertext. Stu
dents produce language both in
the real classroom and in private
electronic space of their virtual

classroom (Meyer 260 Classroom
Server). Here reside the necessary
tools for communication — word
processors and e-mail applica
tions. During the quarter, stu
dents' work is generated, submit
ted electronically, corrected on
line and returned before taking
its printed place in student maga
zines or individual portfolios. The
subjects to be treated, unknown
in advance, emerge from class
room discussion.
Embedded in this shared nar
rative adventure is a cultural
dimension, inextricably bound up

with language, leading to the
enlightening discovery that we do
not live in one world alone but in
many others. One could, for
example, envisage the entire over
seas campus enterprise engaged
in bringing Stanford's far-flung,
international campuses together
with articulated links enabling
students to stay in touch with the
home campus and share with
classmates the insights accruing
from their stay abroad.
To learn a discipline — be it
language, math, history, physics
— should, to a considerable

extent, be an effort directed at
understanding the specific men
tal and personal gratification
practitioners of a discipline expe
rience in the exercise of their pro
fession. To understand others is
to understand oneself. And that
applies as much to ways of
thought as to feelings, as Jerome
Bruner points out in a fascinat
ing book titled "Actual Minds,
Possible Worlds":
"The language of education is
the language of culture creating,
not of knowledge consuming or
knowledge acquisition alone. In a

time when our educational estab
lishment has produced alienation
from the process of education,
nothing could be more practical
than to look afresh in the light of
modern ideas in linguistics and
the philosophy of language at the
consequences of our present
school talk and at its possible
transformations."
If the goal of a Stanford educa
tion is the training of flexible, cre
ative minds, then this is surely the
road to be traveled as we move
towards the year 2000 and beyond.
In the words of the psychologist

Mihaly Csikszentmilhalyi in his
recent book "The Evolving Self':
. . [T]he task of a good soci
ety is not to enshrine the creative
solutions of the past into perma
nent institutions; it is, rather, to
make it possible for creativity to
keep asserting itself."
Technology has a vital role to
play in all of this, but only if it
remains firmly in the controlling
hands of enlightened human
beings.

Students in charge
When students take over and
assume responsibility for their
education, in collaboration with
teacher-mentors, exhilarating
happenings occur. In language
classes, news magazines can be
written and illustrated either
locally or in collaboration with
other universities as in the Har
vard-Stanford e-mail and newspa
per writing experiments in
French (1988 to present). Video
documentaries can be made, plays
scripted, costumed fl
and 111

filmed, songs composed and per
formed, food prepared and
enjoyed, music played or sung,
ideas and interpretations of poli
tics, economics, and literature
shared. Letters can be written to
a prisoner of conscience in Moroc
co, serving a 10-year term for his
political beliefs. Could any simu
lation rival the wave of empathy
and sympathy triggered by such
an exchange when the prisoner's
answer arrives — months later
— a hand-penned letter in an
envelope bearing stamps from
"Le Royaume du Maroc"?
In a lighter vein, but no less
educational, game shows such as
"Jeopardie Francaise" can be cre
ated and played. Or, using tele
conferencing studios, classes
thousands of miles apart can talk
to each other. Just this quarter,
in a collaboration with Carnegie
Mellon, students prepared and,
after an initial getting-acquainted
teleconferencing session, present
ed documentary videos of their
respective campuses. The CMU
students took delight in watching,
on their screens, the Stanford
students viewing the televised
CMU videos and then engaging in
comments and questions. The
documentary film made by the
Stanford French class, digitized
and spliced using Adobe Pre
miere, will be available for its
grande premiere on final exam
day.
In a project-oriented perspec
tive such as this, even exams are
redefined, becoming a community
viewing of work accomplished,
such as student video presenta
tions, talks, performance of
music, recitation of poetry and
discussion of selected readings,
world problems, or even local
issues. This quarter, some stu
dents opted to write a newspaper.
With the assistance of PageMak
er, a formatting tool, they will dis
tribute their publication — titled
"La folle salamandre" — to their
Stanford classmates and mail
copies to CMU to complete the
long-distance exchange between
students initially having made
acquaintance using e-mail.
Endless variety becomes the
norm. No two courses can be
alike, and the agenda of a class
hour is frequently unpredictable.
A grammar review session can
turn into a discussion about
preparing a dramatic reading of
excerpts from "Le Petit Prince,"
another example of student enter
prise manifesting itself this
spring. If a teacher — prepared to
go with the flow — simply states
"Surprise me," unpredictable cre
ative energy will animate a group
of motivated students.
Students have access to video
segmenting tools, digitizing
equipment, QuickTime movies,
and multimedia display software
in their efforts to achieve new
forms of thought. These generic
tools can as easily be adapted to
language learning purposes as to
other fields. Students' infinitely
varied productions — using appli
cations such as Adobe Premiere,
HyperCard, PageMaker, Photo
shop, Stay Tooned for the manip
ulation of text, sound, graphics,
and video — are conducted in the
foreign language under study and
inevitably attract the requisite
language skills for their realiza
tion.
E-mail, without encroaching
on the value of face-to-face con
tact through lectures, discus
sions, and individual conferences,
constantly provides communica
tion between students and teach
er. Instructors espousing this
new configuration must consider
relinquishing some of their
prominence in front of the class in
order to support, as coaches, stu
dent-driven projects. On the edu
cational stage of collective
endeavor, everyone is a team
player.
The electronic classroom
With overhead projection of

computer terminals, a beginning
language class can literally talk
and write itself into existence, its
daily evolution captured and
turned into narrative, displayed
in front of the class as infinitely
malleable text or hypertext. Stu
dents produce language both in
the real classroom and in private
electronic space of their virtual

classroom (Meyer 260 Classroom
Server). Here reside the necessary
tools for communication — word
processors and e-mail applica
tions. During the quarter, stu
dents' work is generated, submit
ted electronically, corrected on
line and returned before taking
its printed place in student maga
zines or individual portfolios. The
subjects to be treated, unknown
in advance, emerge from class
room discussion.
Embedded in this shared nar
rative adventure is a cultural
dimension, inextricably bound up

with language, leading to the
enlightening discovery that we do
not live in one world alone but in
many others. One could, for
example, envisage the entire over
seas campus enterprise engaged
in bringing Stanford's far-flung,
international campuses together
with articulated links enabling
students to stay in touch with the
home campus and share with
classmates the insights accruing
from their stay abroad.
To learn a discipline — be it
language, math, history, physics
— should, to a considerable

extent, be an effort directed at
understanding the specific men
tal and personal gratification
practitioners of a discipline expe
rience in the exercise of their pro
fession. To understand others is
to understand oneself. And that
applies as much to ways of
thought as to feelings, as Jerome
Bruner points out in a fascinat
ing book titled "Actual Minds,
Possible Worlds":
"The language of education is
the language of culture creating,
not of knowledge consuming or
knowledge acquisition alone. In a

time when our educational estab
lishment has produced alienation
from the process of education,
nothing could be more practical
than to look afresh in the light of
modern ideas in linguistics and
the philosophy of language at the
consequences of our present
school talk and at its possible
transformations."
If the goal of a Stanford educa
tion is the training of flexible, cre
ative minds, then this is surely the
road to be traveled as we move
towards the year 2000 and beyond.
In the words of the psychologist

Mihaly Csikszentmilhalyi in his
recent book "The Evolving Self':
. . [T]he task of a good soci
ety is not to enshrine the creative
solutions of the past into perma
nent institutions; it is, rather, to
make it possible for creativity to
keep asserting itself."
Technology has a vital role to
play in all of this, but only if it
remains firmly in the controlling
hands of enlightened human
beings.

John Barson is a professor of
French.
UNTIL THE early 1980s the
chalk board reigned
supreme in the foreign lan
guage classroom along with lec
ture notes and textbooks — a
happy and sometimes question
able trio dedicated to the impart
ing and assimilating of knowl
edge, with teachers vigorously in
control of their subject matter
and of students as well. Careful
division of textbooks and syllabi
into manageable chunks per
semester or quarter produced
courses with well-defined con-

John Barson

tent. Final exams were construct
ed to ensure that material was
absorbed. In the field of foreign
language teaching, succeeding
waves of methodologies — rang
ing from grammar-translation to
behaviorist approaches, skill-get
ting/skill-using methods to more
communication-centered models
of recent years washed over the
country, leaving in their wake the
resurgent hope of significant
innovation, capable of helping
students to accomplish that
rarest of feats — to don, reptilian
like, the linguistic skin of a lan
guage and culture foreign to their
own.
Learning as process
Becoming "other" is not easily
achieved. Understanding and
assimilating "foreigness"
requires relinquishing, often with
considerable discomfort, the
notion that one's native language
perception of reality — for lan
guage does in fact create reality —
is not an absolute but a system
among others. Acquiring another
language and culture results in a
heightened level of self-percep
tion — mind-bending activity tak
ing place over time and not neces
sarily related to the myriad gram
mar and vocabulary "practice
routines" of traditional language
learning.
More to the point is engaging
students, working either individ
ually or collaboratively, in goal
oriented activities — an approach
applicable to many disciplines.
This enables students to discover
their aims and grow into a sense
of their social identity. When
accomplished in foreign language,
these transactions become an
instrument of management and
of self-discovery.
The role of technology
By placing tools at our dispos
al, technology is prodigious in its
ability to support humanistic and
scientific endeavor. Network
access to information and its sup
port of interpersonal exchange
are making a quantum leap in the
delivery of education in America.
The dissemination of word, pic
ture and sound in all of their
hypertext and multimedia dimen
sions is literally creating a new
reality — a reality that will be
shaped by the current and future
generations of students. Since
these powerful tools have enor
mous potential for delivery of
information — in many way rival
ing the invention of the printing
press — teachers will have to re
think the delivery of subject spe
cific information. The instrumen
tality of computer tools when
placed in the hands of creative
users is primary. A quick glance
at Portfolio at Stanford or the
World Wide Web (via Mosaic) con
firms that needed information is
likely to be found either on a local
or global network somewhere.

and multimedia display software
in their efforts to achieve new
forms of thought. These generic
tools can as easily be adapted to
language learning purposes as to
other fields. Students' infinitely
varied productions — using appli
cations such as Adobe Premiere,
HyperCard, PageMaker, Photo
shop, Stay Tooned for the manip
ulation of text, sound, graphics,
and video — are conducted in the
foreign language under study and
inevitably attract the requisite
language skills for their realiza
tion.
E-mail, without encroaching
on the value of face-to-face con
tact through lectures, discus
sions, and individual conferences,
constantly provides communica
tion between students and teach
er. Instructors espousing this
new configuration must consider
relinquishing some of their
prominence in front of the class in
order to support, as coaches, stu
dent-driven projects. On the edu
cational stage of collective
endeavor, everyone is a team
player.
The electronic classroom
With overhead projection of

computer terminals, a beginning
language class can literally talk
and write itself into existence, its
daily evolution captured and
turned into narrative, displayed
in front of the class as infinitely
malleable text or hypertext. Stu
dents produce language both in
the real classroom and in private
electronic space of their virtual

classroom (Meyer 260 Classroom
Server). Here reside the necessary
tools for communication — word
processors and e-mail applica
tions. During the quarter, stu
dents' work is generated, submit
ted electronically, corrected on
line and returned before taking
its printed place in student maga
zines or individual portfolios. The
subjects to be treated, unknown
in advance, emerge from class
room discussion.
Embedded in this shared nar
rative adventure is a cultural
dimension, inextricably bound up

with language, leading to the
enlightening discovery that we do
not live in one world alone but in
many others. One could, for
example, envisage the entire over
seas campus enterprise engaged
in bringing Stanford's far-flung,
international campuses together
with articulated links enabling
students to stay in touch with the
home campus and share with
classmates the insights accruing
from their stay abroad.
To learn a discipline — be it
language, math, history, physics
— should, to a considerable

extent, be an effort directed at
understanding the specific men
tal and personal gratification
practitioners of a discipline expe
rience in the exercise of their pro
fession. To understand others is
to understand oneself. And that
applies as much to ways of
thought as to feelings, as Jerome
Bruner points out in a fascinat
ing book titled "Actual Minds,
Possible Worlds":
"The language of education is
the language of culture creating,
not of knowledge consuming or
knowledge acquisition alone. In a

time when our educational estab
lishment has produced alienation
from the process of education,
nothing could be more practical
than to look afresh in the light of
modern ideas in linguistics and
the philosophy of language at the
consequences of our present
school talk and at its possible
transformations."
If the goal of a Stanford educa
tion is the training of flexible, cre
ative minds, then this is surely the
road to be traveled as we move
towards the year 2000 and beyond.
In the words of the psychologist

Mihaly Csikszentmilhalyi in his
recent book "The Evolving Self':
. . [T]he task of a good soci
ety is not to enshrine the creative
solutions of the past into perma
nent institutions; it is, rather, to
make it possible for creativity to
keep asserting itself."
Technology has a vital role to
play in all of this, but only if it
remains firmly in the controlling
hands of enlightened human
beings.
