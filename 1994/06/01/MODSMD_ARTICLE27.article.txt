# Its info gathered, CUE poised to hash out final report
## Undergrad education committee calls year of research successful; recommendations due in fall 
### Sarah Katz Editorial staff 
Although its recommendations
may not be radical, the Commis
sion on Undergraduate Education
has met its charge and spent a
valuable year gathering informa
tion about almost every facet of
undergraduate education, mem
bers said.
"I'm fairly confident there's
not a serious question about
undergraduate education that
didn't get discussed," said Law
Prof. Robert Weisberg, a commis
sion member. "If people expect
revolutionary propositions and
don't see them and therefore con
clude fundamental issues were
not explored, that would be false."
Charged with conducting a
year-long comprehensive study of
Stanford's undergraduate pro
gram, the commission was first
announced by University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper during his
April 1993 "State of the Universi
ty" address.
Along the way, the group has
come up with several proposals
for educational reform. But its
most important achievement,
commission members say, is the
amount of information it has
compiled since it began its work
last October.
"Up until now, while we've had
opinion on individual courses and
the senior survey, we haven't had
systematic input about distribu
tion requirements and a whole
range of issues," said History
Prof. James Sheehan, the com
mission's chair. "By talking to
students and focus groups, we
have found out a great deal —
that's invaluable."
And their efforts have rubbed
off on other members of the Uni
versity community, members
said. "Having departments ques
tion their commitment to under
graduate education hasn't been
done before," said junior Luz Her
rera, the lone underp-aduate on
the commission, adding that the
commission hopes to "increase
faculty accountability."
During the year, the commis
sion split into subcommittees to

study various issues in greater
depth. It has spent most of this
quarter compiling those reports
and hashing out proposals, most
of which are likely to appear in its
final report.

'If people expect
revolutionary propo
sitions and don't
see them and there
fore conclude fun
damental issues
were not explored,
that would be false.'
— Robert Weisberg

Perhaps the most radical of
these recommendations is the
proposal to reform the Universi
ty's system of distribution
requirements. In its present form,
the proposal would require that
each student take a three-quarter

science core and
three classes in
the humanities
and social sci
ences.
Although the
system of
requirements
was last revised
as recently as
1991, Sheehan

said he believes the commission's
proposal presents something new.
"If our principles are accepted,
I hope it will encourage a new
attitude towards distribution
requirements," he said. "I hope it
will get us away from categorical
thinking and get students to
think more strategically."
But Weisberg said that,
although the proposed require
ments are new, they "neither
drastically undermine or enhance
the concept of the DR."
Weisberg said the commission
was reluctant to change the
requirements too drastically,
especially considering the debate

that ensued several years ago
when the University switched
from Western Civilization to Cul
tures, Ideas and Values.
"The real issue is what should
be the common denominator. We

didn't have the
stomach to take
on that whole
issue again," he
said.
The commis
sion is still debat
ing where the
CIV requirement
will fit into the
system. "We're

not going to abandon it, but one
problem is that CIV as it now
exists doesn't fulfill the stated
objectives and I think that quite
naturally leads to disappointment
and dissatisfaction," Sheehan
said.
In other areas, the commis
sion has failed to be as extreme as
it could have been, often because
of feasibility constraints. In its
consideration of the academic cal
endar, for example, the commis
sion decided against a proposal
which called for a switch to
semesters, even though many
commission members supported
the idea.
"It's easier to stay with quar
ters. I'm not sure it's the best out
come, but it would have cost a lot
[to switchl. Every course would
have had to be revisited and
rethought, while the benefits can
only be guessed at," said graduate
student David Lowell, another
commission member.
Although the commission was
told to think without budget
restraints, practical issues did
play a role in the group's deci
sions, Weisberg said. "We were
not supposed to be constrained
but it didn't seem fruitful to work
on an ideological level."
Because the University's sys
tem of undergraduate education
could not be examined in a vacu
um, the commission also had to
consider other issues that arose
during the year, including the
grading policy scheduled to be
voted on tomorrow by the Faculty
Senate as well as a rejected pro

posal to move Residential Educa
tion under the auspices of Hous
ing and Dining Services.
Sheehan said that, for the most
part, the commission was reluc
tant to make recommendations
about grading issues, especially
since their student input — with
only one undergraduate on the
commission — was limited.
However, he added, the com
mission will probably "recom
mend that a group be set up to
think further about grades."
The commission also agreed
with and deferred to the Faculty
Senate Subcommittee on Resi
dential Education and Advising,
which recently released a draft
report rejecting any change in Res
Ed oversight, Sheehan said.
Although they feel the commis
sion has done an admirable job
with the time it was given, some

members said
there were issues
they felt were
ignored.
"I'm not sure
we have taken
the look at Res
Ed that we
should have,"
Weisberg said. "I
don't think any-

one wants to look at it, and I
think that's a problem."
Herrera said she felt the com
mission had not had enough dis
cussion about how the University
treats issues of diversity within
the student body.
"Recognizing the role that eth
nic centers play and [talking
aboutl retaining students of color
would have been worthwhile,"
she said.
Herrera also said there should
have been another undergraduate
on the commission, although she
recognized the value of the ASSU
sponsored Student Advisory
Group on Undergraduate Educa
tion.
The commission's final report
will be presented to the president,
and some of the academic propos
als will also have to be approved
by the Faculty Senate, Sheehan
said.
Whether these recommenda

tions will pass is hard to predict,
members said. "The commission
itself is very large — if we could
get a consensus among our
selves, hopefully we could get
one in the larger group," Shee
han said.
Weisberg said he feels the pro
cess of revision will continue even

after the final report is delivered.
"It's not as if the commission can
present perfect mathematical,
logical bases for the recommenda
tions," he said. "The danger is
that the Faculty Senate will say,
'It's not as if they proved any
thing definitely — it's just opin
ions.' "
