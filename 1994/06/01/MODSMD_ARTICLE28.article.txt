# Some of CUE's recommendations
## 
### 
Although the final report of
the Commission on Under
graduate Education is not due
until October, the group has
spent spring quarter formulat
ing the following recommenda
tions which, in some form, are
likely to appear in its final pro
posal.
In large part, the recommen
dations represent the work of
the eight commission subcom
mittees which met during win
ter quarter.
Distribution requirements
• A three-quarter science core
and three classes in humanities
and social sciences.
• Possible combination of Cul
tures, Ideas and Values with
World and American Cultures
requirements to form a single
three-quarter course covering
culture.
Technology in teaching
• A call for more innovative
techniques in classes and lec
tures.
• Increased use of computers, in
some cases a substitute for
classroom notetaking.
• The establishment of a "one
stop shopping" location to
teach faculty about available
technology.
Advising
• A push for increased faculty
involvement in undergraduate
advising programs.
• Expansion of sophomore sem
inars.
• Potential creation of fresh
men seminars to be held during

spring quarter.
Academic calendar
• Two full Dead Days each
quarter.
• Pushing back the start of
each academic year to allow for
three weeks of winter vaca
tion.
• Denial of academic credit for
"activities courses," including
dance and athletic classes.
•The commission is still unsure
about its recommendations for
a three-year plan.
Language requirements
• Passage of a proficiency test,
the third quarter of a first-year
class or study abroad required;
no exemption simply for high
school study.
Majors
• Inclusion of a writing-inten
sive course as part of all majors,
possibly by expanding the Writ
ing Across the Curriculum pro
gram to all majors.
• A call for more coherent, pro
gressive majors.
• Regular evaluation for all
majors, not just interdisci
plinary programs.
• A synthesizing feature in each
major, such as a thesis.
• Establishment of minors.
Grading
• A call for a new committee to
study ways to curb grade infla
tion.
• Public availability to faculty
of grade distribution, broken
down by classes, on a regular
basis.
