## Theory relates magnetic monopoles to expanding universe Perspective a result of earlier research 
### Michael Slemmer Editorial staff 
In addition to providing a better
understanding of how the universe
works, scientific theories can also predict
phenomena which are difficult to demon
strate in reality.
Such is the case with magnetic
monopoles — subatomic anomalies, by
our current understanding of physics,
which only contain one magnetic pole.
According to classical notions of
physics, these particles can not even exist
because for each object's north pole there
should be a corresponding south pole.
However, modern theories about how the
universe began 15 billion years ago pre
dict that monopoles should exist. The
trouble is that no one has ever been able
to actually detect one.
As an offshoot of previous work into
particle physics, Physics Prof. Andrei
Linde has proposed that these
monopoles may actually play an integral
role in explaining the inflation of the uni
verse by acting as centers for new
regions of expansion. In this manner,
they could work to create "eternal infla
tion."
The theory would then predict that
an observer could be either inside of the
region expanding from the monopole at
its center or outside the monopole
entirely. From the outside, Linde argues
that the monopole would look as it has
in previous physical conceptions — as a
tiny object containing a magnetic
charge.
In this way, from the outside the
monopole would appear in some ways like
a black hole because of its small size and
the invisible expanding region which
lurks inside it.
On the other hand, from the inside, it
might not even be apparent that the
observer was within a monopole because

the expanding region would seem to
encompass the entire universe.
According to Linde, the theory can be
seen as bubbles forming on the outside of
bubbles, creating a potentially infinite
number of inflationary regions.
He said that this "amazing new twist"
can also explain the rarity of monopoles
in the observable universe. Because the
monopoles themselves are actively being
thrust away from each other by the
inflating region, the likelihood of finding
one long after our universe began
becomes very small.
Though Linde's new theory may aid in
distinguishing which picture of the cos
mos is correct, he emphasized that it is a
"direct result of earlier work" which he
and other scientists have put into the
field of theoretical physics.
The vast majority of models for uni
versal expansion begin with the assump
tion that the cosmos began long ago with
an initial explosion or "big bang." It is the
intense heat and pressure of this event
that would even permit the creation of
the exotic monopoles.
In order to explain exactly what hap
pened in this primordial blast, scientists
have developed a number of refinements
to the original inflationary theory devised
by Alan Guth from the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology. However, this
initial theory created problems because it
could not predict the high degree of
homogeneity which is now visible in the
observable universe.
Instead, Linde proposed in 1982 a
"new inflationary scenario" which pre
dicted that the differences between
objects with and without mass could be
described by a scalar field — which per
vades all of space, giving readings at each
individual point like a temperature field.
In this way, if a particle can interact with
the field, then it is said to have mass; oth
erwise it is massless.
