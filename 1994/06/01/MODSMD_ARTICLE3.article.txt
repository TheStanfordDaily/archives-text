## '86 Chevy serves as Caspermobile

You would think that, as University presi
dent, you could drive whatever car you wanted.
You picture Gerhard Casper cruising in a luxu
ry car — probably German-made — and defi
nitely his own, right?
Wrong. In fact, Casper drives a University
owned vehicle for business purposes. This ve
hicle, a 1986 gray Chevrolet Caprice sedan, is
the "official president's car," and also was dri
ven by former University President Donald
Kennedy.
However, Casper said, he isn't forced to
drive it. And he also has a private car which he
uses for personal matters.
"My own car is a 1988 Toyota Camry. My
wife needs it,"he said. "In any event, mostly I
walk. I use the car only if I have to schlep a lot
of files or go to several places in the course of
one day."
Driving a university car is a uniquely Stan
ford experience for Casper, who acknowledged,

"I did not drive a university-owned car when I
worked at the University of Chicago."
Apparently, the car — which was new in
Kennedy's day — is now something of a clunk
er. "The car runs slowly ... I don't like it. One
of its quirks is that it sometimes doesn't run at

all," said Casper, admitting that "I would pre
fer driving another car."
Kennedy, now a biology professor, said he
believes there has been a special presidential

car "forever."
"I seem to remember that
there was a car before 1986, and
that it was basically the same
thing. I think they're kept for a

long time, because we're a frugal
institution," he said.
So frugal, in fact, that Kennedy
often had to share the vehicle
with other staff members in his
office. "It wasn't just a president's
car, it was more of a Building 10
car," he said. "The provost drove
it, and Mrs. Sterling [wife of for
mer Stanford president Wallace

Sterling] drove it. It was just part
of the University fleet."
Like Casper, Kennedy had a
private car and rarely used the
official vehicle, instead choosing
to walk when doing business
around campus. "I would take it
to the airport and leave it there
when I traveled, or take it to the
city. But I had it for about six

years," he said.
Casper summed up his feelings
for the car in a few words: "I'd
really rather walk."
Kennedy, however, had slight
ly fonder recollections of the
Chevy. "I thought it was just fine,
it served a purpose," he said. "It
went backwards and forwards. I
found it very satisfactory."
