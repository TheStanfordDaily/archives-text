# A revised theory of universal expansion
## 
### 
It was because the original model pro
posed by Guth relied on a complicated
version of this sort of scalar field that it
predicted large inhomogeneities in the
present-day universe.
However, Linde again revised his the
ory because, even under the new infla
tionaiy scenario, it seemed unlikely that
a region of inflation would ever be gener

ated. But by using chaos theory, he
showed that certain regions of the uni
verse could begin inflating of their own
accord â€” augmenting the probability
that expansion would occur.
It was this proposal which led him to
suggest that monopoles could act as the
centers for new inflation although he
admitted that, as with any theory, it

could still be proven wrong.
However, if the predictions made in
Linde's theory can be borne out with
experimental evidence, he will have
answered a question which has perplexed
physicists for many years by explaining
what happens to the monopoles which
should exist according to each of the
inflationary theories.
