# Drugs to improve transplant safety
## Help in reducing chances of rejection by recipients' immune systems 
### Sara Bhargava 
A team of researchers at the Medi
cal Center recently unveiled a set of
three drugs which should alleviate the
problems of organ rejection after
transplant surgery.
The drugs also aid in preventing the
formation of scar tissue following
angioplasties — procedures which
involve inserting an inflatable "bal
loon" into a blood vessel and inflating
it to push back unwanted buildups,
thereby opening up the artery to
greater blood flow.
The three compounds —
rapamycin, mycophenolate mofetil
(MPA) and leflunomide — are unique
in that they seem to prevent scarring
after both transplants and angioplas
ties without the crippling side affects
seen in most drugs used today.
The drugs seem to work most effec
tively when used in conjunction.
According to Dr. Randall Morris,
Director of the Laboratory of Trans
plantation Immunology at Stanford,
"The body is very redundant."
"Simply shutting off one circuit is
not enough," he said. "You need a drug
that will shut off circuit one, two, and
three, which is why it is better to use
more than one drug."
Each of the drugs also has special
ized individual effects. Rapamycin and
leflunomide seem to prevent the nar
rowing of lung airways in transplant
organs — an effect not seen in
immunosuppressive drugs currently
used.
The compounds should be useful for
treatment in all types of transplant

cases since the immune system works
in the same way against all types of
foreign organs.
"The mechanisms by which tissue is
rejected is similar [in all cases]," said
Dr. Richard Pratt, an assistant profes
sor of cardiovascular medicine who
assisted Morris in discovering the new

we are very lucky we can
just turn It down a few
notches.'

uses for the drugs.
Anti-rejection drugs in use today
act to inhibit immune-cell prolifera
tion — thereby halting rejection, but
fail to prevent narrowing of arteries
and airways by scarring, he said. This
leads to rejection of the foreign tissue.
The new drugs are also more effec
tive than those currently in use
because they differ in their physiologi
cal mechanisms. Whereas cyclo
sporine, a common drug today, works
by preventing the formation of growth
factors which go on to stimulate
immune-cell division, the new discov
eries intercept these factors before
they can carry their signals to the

cells. In this way, if the factors have
already been produced, cyclosporine
can't ao anything.
"For many years we have had pow
erful drugs — admittedly often with
powerful side effects — which have
been able to halt or at least control the
full-tilt battle, the immune response,
that erupts shortly after the new
organ is implanted," Morris said in a
statement. "But often months or years
later, a transplanted organ may be
seriously damaged, and successful
treatment using existing drugs is
rarely achieved [in those casesl."
The drugs are also useful in angio
plasty patients because they control
the narrowing of the arteries after the
procedure. Scarring following the pro
cedure reduces its effectiveness. "This
is the first demonstration of a therapy
that allows 're-lining' of vessels after
angioplasty," Morris said.
Because the new drugs inhibit
growth factors specifically in the
immune system's B-cells and T-cells,
they have fewer side effects than more
generally acting drugs used today
including cyclosporine, as well as
steroids and azthioprine — the other
common forms of immunosuppres
sives. Due to this greater specificity,
damage by the immune system to
healthy organs will be less common.
Cyclosporine, on the other hand, often
causes damage to organs such as the
patient's kidneys.
However, even the new drugs are
not completely specific to immune
agents acting only against the foreign
organ. "Fortunately we don't have to
turn the immune system all the way
off — we are very lucky we can just
turn it down a few notches," said Mor
ris.
The three anti-rejection drugs are
not exactly new. They were com
pounds that had "failed in the thera
peutic uses for which they were devel
oped by drug companies-they were
drugs in search of a disease," accord
ing to Morris.
He first chose rapamycin and MPA
to study as immunosuppressives six
years ago. In mid-May of this year he
presented his findings to the American
Society of Transplant Physicians and
the American Society of Transplant
Surgeons.
Exactly when the drugs will be
released into the common market is
still not certain. It "is up to the FDA,"
Morris said. We "estimate roughly
that MPA is most advanced. It may be
on the market in the next couple of
years."
The drugs have already been used
by many patients and seem to be quite
effective, he said. When MPA is
released, it will most likely replace
azthioprine, which is currently in use.
Lefiunomide will actually never be
released for use as an immunosuppres
sive because its original use was for
rheumatoid arthritis. A chemical
cousin will be developed for use in
transplantation cases.
