# The 						Science Bug
## From UFOs to stray hairs Quirks of the human body can give you a 'wooden leg'

Wfiy do I wake up in the mornings
Kir with this two-inch long mutant arm
hair? Am I normal?"
— Hairy Harris
A: Well, you managed to stump the
Bug, along with the entire dermatolo
gy department at the School of Medicine,
with this one. You definitely are normal
(at least in terms of hair growth), but the
reason for these abnormal follicular
extrusions is unknown. Perhaps a URO
grant is needed for this one.
Q, What causes my leg to fall asleep
when I'm sitting in class? And why
aoes it hurt so much when I then stand on
it?
— Asleep in class
A:What's actually happening when
your leg falls asleep is that you've
somehow pressed on the main nerve car
rying messages to and from your foot,
along with the blood vessel that feeds this
nerve. This often happens when you cross
your legs, since this nerve crosses your
fibula right below the knee.
By cutting off the flow of oxygen to the
nerve, you basically put it out of commis
sion, so no signals can get back and forth.
You can't feel or move your foot — the
wooden leg symptom^.
When you relieve this pressure (i.e. you
wake up at the end of class), blood How
resumes and the nerve starts to regain
activity. However, it takes a little while for
the nerve to start functioning properly
again, and during this recovery time the
nerve cell sends strange messages that
don't make much sense to the rest of the
nervous system. You perceive these faulty
communications as that pins and needles
sensation.
You may wonder if it's dangerous to be
cutting off the blood flow and shutting
down nerves like this. For one thing, you
are not shutting off all blood to your leg, so
your foot is not going to fall off. And sur
prisingly, your extremities can actually go
for an hour or two without blood flow and
recover when normal activity is resumed
(although I wouldn't try this at home). This
is what allows severed hands or other limbs
to be surgically reattached even after lying
in the grass for a couple of hours. (Talk to
John Wayne Bobbitt about this one.)

Q: Why do I always see this floating UFO
in my left eye?"
— I can't see so good
A: Well, those little UFOs actually have a
(somewhat) more scientific name; oph
thalmologists call them "floaters." For those
of you who have never experienced these
ocular invaders, they look like tiny diffuse
spots floating in your view, especially when
looking at the sky or another bright surface.
Floaters are actually the shadows cast by
bits of pigment or cells that are floating
around in the vitreum — the jello-like stuff
that fills the inside of your eye. These bits
usually come off the back of the retina as a
result of normal wear and tear, particularly
in old age.
However, sometimes they can be signs of
serious damage to the eye. In particular,
floaters may indicate retinal detachment,
wherein the retina starts coming off the back
of the eye — which is not very much fun.
Thus, Dr. Kuldev Singh at the Medical
Center suggests that any time new UFOs
start landing in your vitreum, you might
want to get them checked out. Incidentally,
people who are nearsighted are more likely
to become retinally detached due to the mis
shape of their eyes. Just wanted to give you
another obscure syndrome to worry about.
Q: Why do I get little twitches in one tiny
muscle, like my cheek or my arm ?
— Anonymous
A: This too has a scientific name, and this
one actually sounds scientific —
myokymia. From your spinal cord, each
motor nerve cell projects to approximately
10 to 100 muscles fibers, while an entire
muscle is made up of thousands of muscle
fibers. So what happens in myokymia is one
particular nerve cell starts firing over and
over again. This firing causes a particular
subset of muscle fibers (rather than the
entire muscle) to start repeatedly contract
ing. Thus, you get this annoying tiny twitch
that won't go away.
It's not certain what causes this one
nerve cell to start firing away. However, caf
feine is often partly responsible, since it
causes increased activity in the nerve cells
which bind it. In addition, both stress and
fatigue can bring on these twitches. So, if
you really need an extension on that paper,
tell your professor you've been working so
hard that you've become myokymiatic. It
just might work.
