Enthoven honored
A pioneer in the economics of health care,
Graduate School of Business Prof. Alain C.
Enthoven, will be awarded the 1994 Baxter
Health Care Services Research Prize July 11 at
the annual meeting of the Association for Univer
sity Programs in Health Administration.
Enthoven, the Marriner S. Eccles Professor of
Public and Private Management, has been a mem
ber of the Business School faculty since 1973. He
originated the theory of managed competition,
which suggest that managed competition among
health care organizations can lead to lower costs
and high-quality care.
Enthoven, one of 40 nominees for the annual
award, is a former assistant secretary of defense
who served under Presidents Kennedy and John
son.
Grape committee picked
Ten students, faculty and staff members
appointed to examine the University's policy on
purchasing grapes will deliver recommendations
to the president and provost by the end of fall
quarter.
The committee will meet at least once this
quarter before undertaking much of its work in
the fall, committee chair Luis Fraga, an associate
professor of political science, said in a statement.
The committee's formation was announced in

May, following a three-day hunger strike during
which protesters demanded a ban on serving
grapes on campus. University policy currently
allows each dining hall to decide whether to buy
grapes.
Fraga, who also serves as director of the center
for Chicano Research, said the other committee
members are: Coit Blacker, deputy director, Insti
tute for International Studies; History Prof.
Judith Brown; Law Prof. Henry T. Greely; Dean
of Undergraduate Admissions James Montoya;
Shirley Everett, associate director of Dining Ser
vices; doctoral candidates Valerie Zartarian and
Alicia Schmidt-Camacho; sophomore Elvira Pri
eto and senior Jay Won Lee.
Fraga, on his honeymoon, was unavailable for
comment.
