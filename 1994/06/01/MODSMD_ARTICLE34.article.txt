# A
						year of rebuilding, with limited success, for ASSU
## 
### Jim Luh Staff writer 
As the year comes to a close, the
ASSU is looking back on a transition
period in which it attempted to
reestablish itself as an influential
voice in the University community.
However, many fear that the
ASSU continued to lack a clearly
defined vision of the proper role of
student government and how it can
work with students to both deter
mine and advocate their needs.
This year marked the return of
the Council of Presidents after the
reign of "I Prefer Not to Have a
COP," a slate which promised to do
nothing during its term in office
except take steps to abolish the
office. During the tenure of I Prefer
Not, the ASSU Senate and senate
chair attempted to fill the various
representative roles of the executive
branch.
And when a new COP arrived at
the beginning of the year, it found
that much had changed. The Uni
versity was adjusting to a new
administration — some members of
which, according to graduate sena
tor Nawwar Kasrawi, did not know
what a COP was.
"I think this year has been a
rebuilding year for all of us," said
COP member Jason Snyder. "Our
goal was to build up the student gov
ernment."
Dean of Students Michael Jack

son said the newly revived COP
served to bring about "a higher level
of student advocacy."
"The main difference is you have
a regular group of people you can
count on working with," Jackson
said. "There's been a much better
focus in terms of expressing student
opinion."
"I think they [student leaders)
engaged the process very effective
ly," added Provost Condoleezza
Rice, who has worked with the COP
on matters such as budget cuts in

student services.
Rice noted that
the COP was actu
ally responsible for
altering one of her
budget decisions;
they persuaded
her to cancel a
$50,000 cut from
the Career Plan
ning and Place-

ment Center in April.
University President Gerhard
Casper has also lauded student gov
ernment efforts such as the Student
Advisory Group on Undergraduate
Education, a group formed by the
COP to parallel the work of the
Commission on Undergraduate
Education. The group delivered a
report to the commission last
month.
With some exceptions, most stu
dent government leaders agreed
that mechanically, the ASSU

worked much better than it had in
previous years in fulfilling its day-to
day duties, particularly concerning
financial oversight of student orga
nizations.
"I would say that I thought, oper
ationally, the senate ran fine," said
senate chair Greg Waldorf.
Financial Manager Brian Hillger
"basically has done an amazing job
managing the finances of the
ASSU," graduate senator Neil
Crellin said.
But while ASSU senators were
pleased with the group's handling of
managerial roles, many expressed
regret that the ASSU failed to take
on a greater leadership role outside
its specific constitutional mandate.
"It was a good year of getting
what we had to do done," said
undergraduate senator Vanessa
Alvarado, who will serve as a mem
ber of the COP next year. "It wasn't
very innovative.
"We really needed to have more
people doing things outside meet
ings," she added.
While she lauded some efforts
such as the entrepreneurial grants
program, a joint project between the
COP, senate and financial manager
that set aside money for a student
run CD exchange store set to open
next fall.
But Alvarado said the ASSU
failed to take on a strong role in
advocating student issues in other
areas such as ethnic centers and

studies. She and other student lead
ers did most of their work on those
issues as members of ethnic commu
nities, not as ASSU leaders, she
added.
"The ASSU could've had a
stronger role" in terms of student
advocacy, Alvarado said. "You didn't
really see the COP getting involved
with the ethnic center issue."
"The COP was not at the fore
front," said graduate senator San
ford Dickert, noting issues of peak

student interest
such as the recent
protest by Chicano
students in the
Quad. "The ASSU
should be there."
COP member
Ron Brown coun
tered that the
COP did provide
leadership, but
simply decided to

adopt a less visible style. Instead of
leading protests and attending ral
lies, Brown said, the COP chose to
work behind the scenes, advocating
student interests in meetings with
administration leaders.
"My thoughts are that it's very
important for student leaders ... to
represent student interests," Brown
said. "I think we did that."
Dickert praised the COP for
maintaining a close relationship
with the University, but said their
failure to stimulate student interest

and mobilize student action served
to decrease student representation
overall.
"The COP feels it accomplished
something," Dickert said, but "it did
not effectively utilize the student
population."
"The COP, I don't think, had
much to crow about," Crellin said,
describing several successful COP
initiatives as "hollow victories," cit
ing their tuition increase proposal as
an example.
Instead of fighting for a smaller
tuition increase, as some senators,
including Crellin, would have pre
ferred, the COP proposed earlier
this year that the Board of Trustees
increase tuition by 2 percent plus
inflation, or about 5 percent. The
trustees approved a 5 percent
increase in February.
Snyder said at the time that the
COP wanted to propose a "realistic
number" that was compatible with
the administration's model of rev
enue-driven budget planning.
The COP also faced — and
denied — allegations that their pro
posal was based on advance infor
mation that the board was moving
toward a 5 percent increase.
While senators were quick to crit
icize the COP, they were also willing
to subject their own branch of stu
dent government to scrutiny,
acknowledging that much responsi
bility for getting students involved
resides with the senate.

"I really believe that most people
in the senate and COP don't spend
a lot of time thinking about ... 'Is
this in the interest of 14,000 stu
dents or is this in the interest of peo
ple that I identify with?' " Waldorf
said. "There just isn't a sense that
the broader community is repre
sented."
"I think that's one of the contin
uing challenges — to keep
with ways to communicate with the
student body," he said.
But one obstacle student govern
ment apparently could not overcome
was general apathy. One former
undergraduate senator, Gabe Lucas,
who will serve as financial manager
next year, said that student govern
ment performed well given the stu
dent body's lack of interest.
"The way [the COFJ responded
to a lot of student apathy was very
good," Lucas said.
But without complete communi
cation with the student body, the
senate was often reluctant to take
decisive actions on student issues,
given the burden placed on it by the
ASSU Constitution as the sole rep
resentative of the entire student
body.
"I was pretty disappointed that so
little got done in the senate," said
Waldorf, adding that his job was
often frustrating because he had to
remain impartial even if he was not
pleased with the direction the senate
was taking.
