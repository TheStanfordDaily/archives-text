## Two losses bounce baseball from regionals Texas, Oklahoma take advantage of Cardinal errors in worst postseason in Stanford history 
### Andy Eiser Senior staff writer 
Playing with patchwork lineups
resulting from on- and off-the-field
troubles and seeded fourth in the Col
lege World Series Central Regional qual
ifier in Austin, Texas, No. 11 Stanford
erased early deficits to the homestand
ing Texas Longhorns and top-seeded
Oklahoma Sooners Friday and Satur
day. Both leads slipped away, however,
and the Cardinal saw its season end
with 8-4 and 10-4 losses and its only
winless postseason in school history.
As if dealing with the absence of two
suspended starters were not enough,
Stanford (36-24) took to the artificial
turf at Disch-Falk Field Friday facing
7,812 vocal partisans of the third-seeded
Longhorns. Perhaps too eager to get
something started for the Cardinal in
the top of the first inning, sophomore
centerfielder Cale Carter, standing in
for Brian Dallimore at leadoff, beat out
an infield single but got thrown out
attempting to steal second base.
Texas (43-21) then seized its oppor
tunity in the bottom of the inning, scor
ing the game's first run as shortstop
Jose Flores singled with one away and
came around on a two-out infield single
by designated hitter Danny Peoples.
After double plays erased leadoff hits
in each of the next two innings, Stanford
finally broke through with two outs in
the third as junior second baseman Jed
Hansen doubled home Carter and fresh
man shortstop Eric Sees.
But Flores ignited a two-run rally in
the fifth that put the Longhorns ahead
to stay. Stroking a one-out single to
right off Cardinal sophomore starter
Dan Reed (10-5), Flores advanced to sec
ond on an infield hit by first baseman
Stephen Larkin. Peoples then collected
two more of his five RBI on the day and
put his squad up 3-2 with a double down

the left-field line.
With Texas starter J.D. Smart (11-3)
retiring 14 of 15 Stanford batters after
Hansen's hit, Reed enjoyed little margin
for error, which is exactly what Cardinal
senior leftfielder Rod Meyer committed
on a Larkin fly ball to lead off the sev
enth. Head coach Mark Marquess decid
ed immediately to pull Reed, who trailed
by only one run but had made well over
100 pitches in the humid 95-degree
heat.
"Coach Marquess just decided that
someone else could do a better job in
that situation," Reed said. "If things
had gone well for us up to then, maybe

he would have needed me to stay in
there."
What ensued was a pitching carousel,
as junior Matt Marenghi and sopho
more Mike Robbins retired one batter
apiece before freshman Tom Reimers
allowed a run-scoring single to
Longhorns second baseman Steve Hein
rich that put Texas up 4-2.
"We needed to use all those guys the
next day, so Coach wanted to see who
was getting the job done," Reed said.
"In that situation, we just keep each
other calmed down on the field," added
junior first baseman Steve Carver, who
moved from left field to replace Dusty

Allen that day."The only way we would
have a chance was not to let ourselves
get panicked."
Reimers panicked, yielding four
insurance runs before being pulled in
the eighth, but sophomore catcher A.J.
Hinch and Carver came through with
solo home runs off a tiring Smart in the
ninth. Stanford put two more runners
aboard off reliever Jay Vaught, but
Vaught mowed down the final two Car
dinal batters for the final 8-4 margin.

from postseason action last Saturday in a 10-4 loss to Oklahoma.
