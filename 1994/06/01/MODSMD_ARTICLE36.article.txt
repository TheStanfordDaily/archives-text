# One last look
## Seeing the stars from press row 
### 
It is with sadness that I put fingers to keyboard
this week. For as I write, I realize this may be the
last time my words are part of the public record
via the printed page. Or at least the last time my
words will be printed in The Stanford Daily.
It all began innocently enough. After enjoying
writing for the paper in high school, I decided to con
tinue in college. Little did I know that a potential
career could result.
But countless articles and columns later, that's
where I stand. It's only fitting that my last piece for
The Daily be a column under the title I created in
ninth grade, "Schwartz on Sports."
That column title to me is so appropriate. In a

sense, it defmes
me. Sports are
such an integral
part of my life.
The only prob
lem with my col
umn title is that
while catchy,
I've found it
causes people to
forget my first

name. Thankfully, my parents and sister talk to me
at least once a week to remind me what it is.
I think the reason I er\joy sports so much is that
while the stage may be the same, the play is always
different. The actors constantly change, and the
script is an open-ended revision that fluctuates from
moment to moment.
When I walked into The Daily, I was excited just
for the opportunity to write. But The Daily easily
exceeded my expectations. My job: I go to all the
games (which I would do anyway), get to sit in the
best seats in the house, and get paid for doing so!
What better job is there? I immediately said count me
in.
Over four years, I have seen some great games.
The most memorable was from the stands in 1990,
when John Hopkins kicked a field goal as time
expired to give Stanford a 27-25 victory over Cal in
one of the greatest Big Games ever. If nothing else,
all who were in Berkeley that day will never forget
these nine words: "Please clear the field. The game is
not over."
Almost as exciting were the two times the Stan
ford basketball team nearly beat Arizona in Maples in
1991 and 1992. Referee Richie Ballesteros killed the
Cardinal's hopes in the waning seconds in both con
tests.
From my participation in The Daily, I have
learned more than I could have ever possibly imag
ined — how to write a lead, how to interview, how to
edit, how to work with others. These skills are valu
able for anything.
It's amazing the things you can do with a press
pass. I gained courtside admittance to the basketball
events at the 1991 U.S. Olympic Festival in Los
Angeles, and watched a raw Glenn Robinson domi
nate the competition. I covered the 1992 Women's
Basketball Final Four and saw Stanford win the
championship. In 1993, I watched a Warriors game
from press row to report on Adam Keefe's first
appearance in the Bay Area as a professional basket
ball player.
I have had a chance to interview some outstanding
collegiate sports personalities, both coaches and play
ers. I have questioned football coaches Bill Walsh,
Terry Donahue, John Robinson, Lou Holtz, Dennis
Green, and others as well as players Tommy Maddox,
Glyn Milburn, Willie McGinest, Steve Stenstrom,
Rob Johnson, Tommy Vardell, Russell White, Justin


Schwartz
on
Sports
David
Schwartz
Armour, Bob Whitfield and
Charles Johnson. Basketball
coaches Mike Montgomery, Mike
Krzyzewski, George Raveling,
Lute Olson, Bill Frieder, John
MacLeod, Jim Harrick, Lou Cam
panelli and Todd Bozeman have
answered my queries, as have
players Harold Miner, Don
Mac Lean, Adam Keefe, Khalid
Reeves, Damon Stoudamire,
Jason Kidd, Lamond Murray and
the brothers O'Bannon.
But by far moments I will
remember most from my Stan
ford career revolve around two
special teams: the 1992-93 Stan
ford basketball team and the 1993
Cardinal football team. I was for
tunate to be able to cover the two
marquee sports at Stanford, with
the bonus of traveling on the road
with both clubs. I am proud to say
that I have seen a basketball
game in every gymnasium in the
Pacific 10 Conference and a foot
ball game at six of the 10 Pac-10
schools. While both teams had
less than successful seasons while
I was the beat writer — basket
ball was 7-23 and football was 4-7
— let me assure those who would
postulate: there is no correlation
between these factors.
With basketball, every other
week during winter quarter last
year I packed my bags for a
Wednesday to Sunday excursion.
I caught several flights and rode
many a bus. But with the Cardi
nal hoopsters as company, travel
was always enjoyable. Yet I think
it's safe to say that I'll never
return to Pullman, Wash. As for

football, it will be hard to adjust
to normal travel after experienc
ing a football charter. There's no
other way to describe it other
than first class.
To the players on those teams,
and to coaches Montgomery and
Walsh, I thank you. A special
thank you to most quote-able bas
ketball member Darren Allaway
and football member Armour,
and to the most quote-able coach,
football defensive coordinator
Fred vonAppen.
I must also thank the Sports
Information Directors Steve
Raczynski and Gary Migdol for
their help in the past four years,
and an extra special thanks to
SID Bob Vasquez for his assis
tance and more importantly for
his friendship.
Also within the Athletic
Department, I tip my pen to
Assistant Marketing Director
Michael Izzi for his guidance, to
longtime volunteer Sam Goldman
for his energy and Snoopy mint
box, and to announcer Bob Mur
phy, whose historical mental data
bank of Stanford sports is
unmatched by anyone.
I also extend my gratitude to
the Examiner's Mark Soltau for
giving me a shot at the big time.
As for my colleagues at The
Daily, I value your camaraderie.
Significant among this group is
Howard Libit, who has served as
my de facto editor, collaborator,
counselor, co-columnist and
friend.
Now I must say goodbye, Stan
ford. And say hello to the adven
tures that come.

David Schwartz is graduating
with a Bachelor of Arts degree in
political science and history.
