# One last look
## Seeing the stars from press row 
### 
It is with sadness that I put fingers to keyboard
this week. For as I write, I realize this may be the
last time my words are part of the public record
via the printed page. Or at least the last time my
words will be printed in The Stanford Daily.
It all began innocently enough. After enjoying
writing for the paper in high school, I decided to con
tinue in college. Little did I know that a potential
career could result.
But countless articles and columns later, that's
where I stand. It's only fitting that my last piece for
The Daily be a column under the title I created in
ninth grade, "Schwartz on Sports."
That column title to me is so appropriate. In a

sense, it defmes
me. Sports are
such an integral
part of my life.
The only prob
lem with my col
umn title is that
while catchy,
I've found it
causes people to
forget my first

name. Thankfully, my parents and sister talk to me
at least once a week to remind me what it is.
I think the reason I er\joy sports so much is that
while the stage may be the same, the play is always
different. The actors constantly change, and the
script is an open-ended revision that fluctuates from
moment to moment.
When I walked into The Daily, I was excited just
for the opportunity to write. But The Daily easily
exceeded my expectations. My job: I go to all the
games (which I would do anyway), get to sit in the
best seats in the house, and get paid for doing so!
What better job is there? I immediately said count me
in.
Over four years, I have seen some great games.
The most memorable was from the stands in 1990,
when John Hopkins kicked a field goal as time
expired to give Stanford a 27-25 victory over Cal in
one of the greatest Big Games ever. If nothing else,
all who were in Berkeley that day will never forget
these nine words: "Please clear the field. The game is
not over."
Almost as exciting were the two times the Stan
ford basketball team nearly beat Arizona in Maples in
1991 and 1992. Referee Richie Ballesteros killed the
Cardinal's hopes in the waning seconds in both con
tests.
From my participation in The Daily, I have
learned more than I could have ever possibly imag
ined â€” how to write a lead, how to interview, how to
edit, how to work with others. These skills are valu
able for anything.
It's amazing the things you can do with a press
pass. I gained courtside admittance to the basketball
events at the 1991 U.S. Olympic Festival in Los
Angeles, and watched a raw Glenn Robinson domi
nate the competition. I covered the 1992 Women's
Basketball Final Four and saw Stanford win the
championship. In 1993, I watched a Warriors game
from press row to report on Adam Keefe's first
appearance in the Bay Area as a professional basket
ball player.
I have had a chance to interview some outstanding
collegiate sports personalities, both coaches and play
ers. I have questioned football coaches Bill Walsh,
Terry Donahue, John Robinson, Lou Holtz, Dennis
Green, and others as well as players Tommy Maddox,
Glyn Milburn, Willie McGinest, Steve Stenstrom,
Rob Johnson, Tommy Vardell, Russell White, Justin
