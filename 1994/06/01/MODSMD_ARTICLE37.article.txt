# Men's crew may get nationals bid
## 
### Heather Hardwick Staff writer 
It has been a season of mixed
emotions for Stanford crew. All
boats exhibited great improve
ments in both technique and
times throughout the course of
the season. However, the result of
the recent Pacific 10 Conference
Championship Races has left the
crews with uncertain futures.
The women's varsity crew
placed third behind Washington
and California, a fine showing but
one place short of qualifying for
the upcoming National Champi
onships. All of the junior varsity
and novice boats completed their
seasons at Pac-lOs as well.
That leaves the varsity men,

who also fell one position short of
placing into the National Champi
onships with a fourth-place show
ing behind Washington, Cal and
Long Beach State. However, their
training has not come to an end.
There is still hope the men's boat
will be allowed to compete in
national competition, but that
decision is out of their hands.
"We are in contention to
receive a bid for nationals, it's
pretty much up to the top eight
coaches to decide whether or not
we are allowed to compete,"
senior captain Will Porteous said.
That decision should be final
ized by the middle of this week. It
had been thought that, in place of
the nationals, the men's boat
would compete in the smaller

Intercollegiate Rowing Associa
tion National Championships, to
take place this weekend in Syra
cuse, N.Y. However, given the cir
cumstances, the team has elected
not to attend these races for aca
demic reasons.
Looking beyond national com
petition, the varsity men will be
traveling to Europe this summer
to test their skills in the realm of
international competition. On the
weekend of June 25-26, they will
race against a number of Euro
pean colleges in a regatta in Ams
terdam. Following those races,
they will participate in the Henley
Royal Regatta which will take
place in England from June 29-
July 3. This will be Stanford
crew's first ever competition
overseas and there is the added
excitement of the unexpected. It
will definitely be a memorable
experience, and a fitting one to

end the season.
The varsity boat will lose slx
seniors after this season and
this will be their last opportuni
ty to represent the Cardinal in
competition.
Porteous expressed the
enthusiasm of the team at the
opportunity to compete over
seas, concluding, "It's a nice
way to graduate."
