# When it rains...
## Women's golf finishes 7th 
### Seth Goldstein Staff writer 
Rain and cold weather plagued the Stanford
women's golf team for the entire season. No mat
ter how good the conditions were during practice,
storms always seemed to roll in just in time to dis
rupt tournament play.
Officials canceled two entire rounds of the
Hawaii Invitational in March because of monsoon
like weather. Two weeks ago at the Western
Regionals teams were forced to play two rounds on
one day because thunderstorms had disrupted golf
the previous day. And when play wasn't canceled
or moved, the golfers had to push on through
drips, drizzles and downpours.
So while the powers that be blessed the first
three rounds of the NCAA Championships with
warm sunshine, it seems fitting that cold rains
saw out the final day of the season. The Oregon
Golf Club in West Linn, Ore. was buried under
neath a blanket of gray clouds on Saturday.
The dreary conditions also symbolized the
mood of the previously fourth-ranked Cardinal.
Despite high hopes prior to the contest, Stanford
managed only a seventh-place finish among the
field of the top 18 squads in the nation. The plac
ing, while not disastrous, was somewhat disap
pointing.
"We definitely didn't do so hot," senior Melinda
Daniels. "We could've done a lot better. It didn't
turn out as expected. Things didn't happen for
us."
Despite showing signs of weakness late in the
season, No. 1 Arizona State cap
tured the title of national cham
pion with a convincing four-day
total of 1,189 strokes.

"We thought that we had
closed the gap towards the end,"
head coach Tim Baldwin said.
"But they played best when it
counted most."
Third-ranked USC placed sec
ond, 16 shots off the lead, while
No. 2 San Jose State took third
with 1,220 shots, 31 behind the

Sun Devils. The Cardinal was 49
strokes behind the leader.
The Stanford women came
out onto the greens for last
Wednesday's first round and put
together one of their worst days
this season. The end of the day
found the Cardinal 14th among
the 18 teams.
"I can't say there was any spe
cific reason for our poor play,"
said Daniels. "We just had a real
ly bad first round."
The Cardinal definitely had
some ground to make up. And it
wasn't going to be easy.
"It's hard to keep your head
up after a day like that," said
freshman Mhairi McKay. "It
drains your confidence. We knew
we had to improve."
And they did. Stanford played
an excellent second round,
enabling the squad to move into
sixth last Thursday. Friday left
them in the same position.
But on Saturday the team
slipped a bit, allowing both
UCLA and Texas to climb past
them, although they did manage
to get by Eastern Regional cham
pion Wake Forest to place sev
enth.
Individually, Emily Klein and
Wendy Ward of Arizona State
placed first and second respec
tively with shot totals of 286 and
288. Stanford's most successful
competitor was McKay, who tied
for eighth overall with 299
strokes. Junior Jamille Jose,
freshman Andrea Baxter,
Daniels and sophomore Vicky
Strada finished with totals of
312, 317, 319 and 320, respec
tively.
Baxter said the course was not
a problem for the team. The long,
hilly Oregon Golf Club was
expected to pose difficulties for
some teams.
"It wasn't as intimidating as it
was in the fall (at the NCAA Pre
view Championships)," she said.
"It really tests your skills, but if
you are playing well, you can
score well."
Academic pressure was cited
as a possible explanation for the
finish. Stanford was one of only
three schools to still be in session
at the time.

"I don't know if it's an excuse
or not," said McKay, "but it was
on our minds. Other teams were
able to practice all the time."
Baxter, who pulled some all
nighters prior to the contest in
order to stay on top of her work
load, also alluded to this prob
lem.
"We were hoping the other
teams would be burned out from
practicing all the time," she
added, "But they were well
tuned and ready to go."
As a result, the season ended
on a sour note. But the golfers
maintain that it does not take
away from this year's accom
plishments.
"We had our high points,"
said Baxter. "We proved our
selves to people who doubted
that a team as young as ours
could be competitive. We beat
the eventual champion during
the course of the season — I
think we were one of only three
teams to do so — and gained a
lot of experience.
"But we also had our low
points, like the championships.
It just shows you that you have
to keep trying to improve."
While this season may not
have lived up to expectations,
there is still great hope for the
future. Daniels is the only mem
ber of the squad graduating and
Baldwin said he expects his solid
core of players to continue their
good play.
"They are no longer lacking
experience," he said. "They know
what it takes to play at this level
now and will be a force to be
reckoned with."
The Pacific 10 Conference's
growth may also help the Cardi
nal. California, the only school in
the conference without a
women's golf team, has
announced it will add one for the
1994-95 season. Perhaps the
Cardinal can gain a few easy vic
tories over the rookie squad of its
archrival.
"I think it's fantastic," said
Baldwin. "We'll finally be a real
Pac-10 instead of the Pac-9.
We'll be able to play a few NorCal
tournaments with Cal and San
Francisco State, among others."

season over the weekend with a seventh-place finish at NCAAs.
