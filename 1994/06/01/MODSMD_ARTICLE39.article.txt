# Men's golf set to challenge for top NCAA spot
## 
### Andrew Blachman Staff writer 
Though the Stanford men's golf team has already
recorded perhaps the greatest golf season in school
history, one more challenge remains before the year
is through.
Today through Saturday, the third-ranked Cardi
nal, as one of the country's top 30 teams, will tee off
just outside Dallas at the Stoneridge Country Club in
McKinley, Texas in the NCAA Finals. The Pacific 10
Conference champion Stanford will attempt to cap
ture its first national title in more than four decades.
"We've been practicing as a team since early
September," said coach Wally Goodwin. "The guys
have put in a lot of work this year and I feel that the
sport of golf owes them a spectacular finish."
The hard work has paid off for the experienced
Cardinal team which turned last season's next-to
last-place finish in the Pac-10 into a conference title.
Four of the Cardinal's top five players redshirted last
season and returned this year to help guide Stanford
to a school-record five tournament
titles.
"Our goal all season has been to
win the national championship,"
said senior Brad Lanning, one of
last year's redshirts. "Now that the
finals are all we have left we can
really start zeroing in on that goal."
William Yanigisawa, who trans
ferred from UC-Irvine last year,
agreed. "This time of year is gut
check time," said the junior, who led

all Stanford scorers in last week's
West Regional. "All we're doing
right now is getting ready for (the
finals]."
Yanigisawa and Lanning com
prise only half of last year's crop of
redshirts. Juniors Casey Martin and
Notah Begay 111, the Cardinal's top
two golfers, also sat out last season
to improve their games and to con
centrate on academics. The four
redshirts join junior Steve Burdick
to complete the Stanford team.
The Stanford squad, which
boasts four Ail-Americans and one
more All-Conference performer, has
been one of the most consistent

teams in collegiate golf this year.
The Cardinal has competed in 15
tournaments and finished third or
higher in all but three.
"Regardless of how we do in the
NCAA Finals, this has been a great
year," said Goodwin. "It's certainly
been the best year of my career
here."
Goodwin has done his share to
turn the Cardinal into a consistent
winner. He spent his first three
years on the Farm building a solid
team, an effort he saw pay off in the
1991 season.
That year the Cardinal earned a
trip to the NCAA Finals and sur

prised the field by finishing 15th.
The next year Stanford returned,
this time capturing ninth place in
the nation. This season — Good
win's seventh at the helm — the
Cardinal finally appears to possess
the talent and stamina to make a
run for the title.
"We're right where we want to
be among the top teams," said
Goodwin. "In this level of collegiate
golf there's really no [visible] differ
ence between the nation's best
teams. What matters most is men
tal stamina and desire."
The future looks even brighter
for Stanford golf. In November,

junior golf phenom Tiger Woods
announced he would play college
golf at Stanford, a move that solidi
fied the Cardinal as the favorite to
capture next year's NCAA title.
But most who follow the Stan
ford team don't feel they have to
wait until next year to see a nation
al championship.
"We've already won more tour
naments than any Stanford team in
history," said Goodwin. "I have
great hopes for a high NCAA finish
for this team."
Goodwin says that part of those
hopes come from the Cardinal's per
formance in the Golf Week Preview,

held in October on the same course
as this week's NCAA Finals.
Though the Cardinal opened that
tournament with its worst round of
the year, a stellar third round gave
Goodwin cause for optimism.
"It's a tough course with lots of
water and narrow fairways," he
said. "But in that third round in
October we played it better than any
team in the nation. That certainly
gives me a lot of confidence going
into the finals."
Stanford will be paired up with
Wake Forest and Oklahoma for the
first two days of competition, after
which the field of 30 will be cut to 18.
