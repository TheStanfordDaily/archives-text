# Two facing felony vandalism charges
## Misdemeanors for four others 
### Burt Herman Editorial staff 
Two Stanford varsity athletes will face
felony charges and four others have been
charged with misdemeanors for allegedly
vandalizing the "Gay Liberation" sculpture
— an act police reports reveal might have
been more than just a prank.
"I do not agree with the ideas presented
forth with the statue," junior Todd Laßocca
said in a statement to police immediately
after the May 16 incident. Questioned fur
ther, he said that he felt offended when he
looked at the sculpture.
The Santa Clara County District Attor
ney's Office has filed felony charges against
Laßocca and junior Thomas Irwin because
they were responsible for the majority of the
damage to the bronze sculpture, Stanford

Police Detective Tim Schreiner said.
Sophomores Robert Gardner and Jason
White and junior Mark Butterfield will be
charged with misdemeanors for vandalism
and resisting arrest. The three athletes al
legedly jumped from a pickup truck and ran
from police after the vehicle had been
stopped.
A $500 warrant has been issued for the
arrest of sophomore Brian Dallimore —
who avoided police the night of the incident
— on charges of misdemeanor vandalism.
Police were still trying to locate Dal
limore to place him under arrest last night,
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer said,
adding that Dallimore may have left Cali
fornia for his Nevada home. Police would be
unable to extradite Dallimore under a mis-
demeanor charge, Niemeyer said.
The maximum sentence for a
felony vandalism conviction is jail
or prison and up to a $10,000 fine
along with an order to pay restitu
tion. Misdemeanor vandalism
charges can carry up to a $10,000
fine with jail time.
Junior Dusty Allen and fresh
man Brendan Sullivan — both
arrested the night of the alleged
vandalism — were not charged
with any crimes. "There is no evi
dence those two conspired, aided
or participated in the vandalism,"
Deputy District Attorney Karyn
Sinunu said in a statement.
Sullivan has already served a
one-game suspension imposed by
the Athletics Department at the
NCAA regionals in Austin, Texas,
according to Athletic Director Ted
Leland. With the exception of
Allen, the other athletes are cur
rently serving indefinite suspen
sions from their teams.
Police reports released last
week revealed that Gardner, Irwin
and Laßocca all had black paint on
their hands at the time of their
arrest.
The witness who first called in
about the vandalism reported
hearing one of the students shout,
"Something's gotta give," a com
ment Dallimore attributed to
Laßocca in his statement to police.
Dallimore added that Laßocca was
bent over by the base of one of the
standing figures rocking it and
trying to see if it was loose, the
report said.
Police found the white-coated
sculpture splattered with black
paint with a bench wedged
between two of the figures — dam
age which has been estimated at
more than $8,000.
Gardner also made comments
to police regarding his personal
views about the statue's theme.
Asked if he thought what hap
pened was wrong, Gardner
replied, "I am a homophobic. But I
am not destructive. ... I don't
have a destructive will against
homosexuals."
The district attorney cannot
prosecute the athletes for a hate
crime because Stanford is an insti

tution and not an individual with
civil rights.
The police report also mentions
that a baseball bat may have been
used to damage the statue, but
conflicting statements from the
athletes make it hard to ascertain
exactly who wielded it.
All the athletes except Allen
admitted to drinking alcohol prior
to the alleged crime, according to
the report.
Laßocca paid a visit to the Les
bian, Gay and Bisexual Community
Center on Thursday, where he told
students he was trying to make a
connection with the community,
sophomore David Barba said.

1 am a
But I am not destruc
tive I don't have a
destructive will against
homosexuals.'
— Robert Gardner

After seeing copies of the police
report, however, some students
now question Laßocca's sincerity.
"It seems that so many things
weren't brought out in the open,"
Barba said.
And students fear that the
statements made in the report
might indicate deeper problems
within the Stanford community.
"It's an endemic problem — we
need to address it with education,
but the administration needs to do
something," Barba said. "This is
our University as well. We need to
feel safe in it."
"It was a frightening thing to
see happen at Stanford," graduate
student Tracy Schmidt said. "[The
police reportl does confirm a sense
of outrage that this was a bigoted
act."
The University will be continu
ing its investigation into the inci
dent over the summer, Judicial
Affairs Officer Sally Cole said.
Information from the police report
will be factored into any decision
regarding action to be taken
against the students, Cole added.
The six students charged with
crimes are scheduled for their first
hearing on June 22 at the Palo
Alto Municipal Court.
