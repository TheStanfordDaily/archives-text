# Flanagan ousted in round of 16 at NCAA singles
## Cocotos, Flanagan lose in doubles semifinals 
### Mike Langford Senior staff writer 
After a season in which it fin
ished 25-3 and NCAA runners
up, the Stanford men's tennis
team is sadly saying good-bye to
the old and eagerly welcoming
the new.
Two of the old — seniors
Michael Flanagan and Chris
Cocotos — were named to the
All-America team for their
efforts this season. At the NCAA
Singles Championships, the
12th-seeded Flanagan made it all
the way to the round of 16 before
bowing out to seventh-seeded
Laurent Orsini of Mississippi
State by a 3-6, 6-7 (4-7) tally.
Flanagan gained the All-
American title both by earning
his top-16 seed and by getting to
the third round of the tourna
ment.
In doubles, the fifth-seeded
team of Flanagan and Cocotos
advanced all the way to the quar
terfinals, finally losing to Ten
nessee's unseeded duo of Chris
Mahony and Pablo Montana 3-6,
6-4, 4-6. Although the seed and
the finish earned both All-Amer
ican honors for doubles play,
head coach Dick Gould said that
Flanagan and Cocotos played
flat, and that a majority of the
time, they would have beaten
Mahony/Montana.
"The guys didn't play as well
as they could have," said Gould.
"The team competition really
took the heart out of them."
Stanford's other entrants in
the individual competition —
sophomore Jeff Salzenstein and
senior Robert Devens in singles,
and the twosome of Salzenstein
and senior Vimal Patel in dou
bles — all fell in the first round
of play.

However, Gould added that
the phenomenal record and the
team's daily improvement illus
trate what a great year it was for
Stanford tennis.
"I can't say enough about
these guys, how they played, and
how they represented Stanford,"
Gould said. "They were always
pulling together, and they had a
great season. I'm just sorry they
don't go home with a ring. They
are probably the highest achiev
ing team I've ever had."
However, if Gould is with one
hand waving farewell to one of
his greatest classes, he is with
the other undoubtedly greeting
another foursome that may
equal or even surpass the
achievements of the Class of '94.
And while just about every col
lege tennis team in the nation is
loading its roster with foreign
players, Gould seems to have
remained true to his commit
ment to developing home-grown
talent, as all four are from the
United States.
The Cardinal had yet another
fantastic recruiting year by snar
ing what are arguably the No. 1
and No. 2 recruits in the nation.
Scott Humphries and Paul Gold
stein, ranked No. 6 and No. 8 in
the world junior rankings, are
both ranked in the top two or
three in the junior national polls.
Humphries, from Alamo,
Calif., attended school in Florida
at the Palmer Academy — run by
the father of former Cardinal
standout Jared Palmer. Recent
ly, Humphries made it to the
semifinals of the junior edition
of the Italian Open.
Goldstein, of Rockville, Md.,
attended the Sidwell Friends
school in Washington, D.C. In

Michael Flanagan smashes a serve from a match earlier this year. Althought the Cardinal will
lose four seniors, including Flanagan, a top recruiting class is poised to step in next year.
-1992, Goldstein was the
national 16-and-under champi
on, and the next year, as a 17-
year-old, won the national 18-
and-under championship.
Both Humphries and Gold
stein made it to the semis in
the singles competition of the
junior Australian Open, and
playing together as a doubles

team, made it to the semis in
doubles as well.
In addition to these two,
who will contribute immediate
ly in both singles and doubles,
two other players from north
ern California will also join the
Cardinal as freshmen next sea
son. Misha Palecek from near
by Atherton and Charles
Hoeveler from Ross will both
compete for playing time as
freshmen.
A starting six in singles
could possibly read Salzen

stein, Jim Thomas,
Humphries, Goldstein, Ricky
Becker and Grant Elliott, with
Palecek, Hoeveler, and juniors
Paul Galichia and Robert
Franklin possibly contributing
in doubles. And although the
team may not have tremendous
depth, Stanford will undoubt
edly once again be a force in the
collegiate tennis world.
"We'll have the nucleus for a
very fine team," Gould said.
"Even the makings of a con
tending team."
