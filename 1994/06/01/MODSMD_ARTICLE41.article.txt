# Sailing team washes up empty at nationals
## Dinghy races give Cardinal another shot at top prize 
### Jeremy Stone Staff writer 
After a season of climbing
steadily in the national rankings,
the Stanford sailing team
embarked on its trip to the national
championships with high hopes. So
far, however, the Connecticut
waters have been unforgiving.
The women's team was a dark
horse candidate for the title. Its
goal was to place in the top three,
and if St. Mary's or Tufts, the two
favorites, faltered, the experts fig
ured Stanford might be in the win
ner's circle. A poor opening day last
Thursday, however, dashed those
aspirations, and the team staggered
to a ninth-place finish.

back east — the women's Pacific
Coast Championships — Stanford's
A division team of skipper Gretchen
Uznis and crew Sibyl Diver, both
sophomores, cruised to wins in 12 of
16 races, in mostly heavy winds. On
Thursday, however, the winds were
extremely light and the competition
was much tougher.
"We didn't do really well," said
first-year coach Steve Bourdow.
"(The weatherl was kind of tricky,
and we made some big mistakes.
We were kind of down after the first
day."
On Friday, the winds were heav
ier, and junior Polly Brown, who
sailed with Uznis in a few races at
the PCCs and the day before,
replaced Diver as crew for a majori
ty of the races. However, the switch
of personnel and conditions didn't
improve the results.
"Our A division team never real
ly got rolling," said Bourdow.
"Poor starts were our biggest prob
lem."
Meanwhile, the B division group
also struggled. Sophomores Cinna
mon Hampikian and Michelle Der
benwick were languishing in the
middle of the pack after Thursday,
so freshman Alice Manard stepped
in as skipper for Hampikian on Fri
day. Manard guided the B division
boat to several top-five finishes, and
after two days of action, the Cardi
nal had placed fourth in B division

and ninth in A among 16 schools.
On Saturday the teams sailed on
the sound, where Uznis and the A
division crew continued to struggle.
Hampikian returned to skipper
with Manard crewing in the B divi
sion, and they picked up one victory
and a few finishes near the top of
the pack. However, it was for the
most part a disappointing, anticli
mactic finish for the Cardinal. For

the first time all year, the A division
team ended in the bottom half of
the field, the 11th boat out of 16. B
division fared somewhat better by
grabbing 6th place, only one point
from the top five. The ninth-place
finish was also Stanford's lowest of
the year, but Stanford had not
faced such a contingent of top
ranked schools before.
Cardinal sailors offered no

excuses for the lackluster showing.
Though the regatta was sailed in
4205, not Flying Juniors, as Stan
ford usually sails, Derbenwick said
she didn't feel that was a valid rea
son.
"We were in a different boat, but
I don't think that makes that much
of a difference," she said. "Sailing is

sailing; they're both boats. I just
think we kind of choked a little bit."
Stanford didn't choke in the

onships Monday and Tuesday, but
it fell just short of qualifying for
today's final round of four.
Stanford moved from Yale,
where the women's regatta was
held, to the Coast Guard Academy

for team racing, and switched from
420s to FJs. The Cardinal celebrat

Charleston and St. Mary's for first
among 12 schools.
The Cardinal fell to Boston Uni
versity and the Midshipmen yester
day, but defeated its other competi
tion to complete the round-robin
with an 8-3 mark. Unfortunately
for Stanford, the leader board was
congested. Tufts went undefeated
yesterday to move to 9-2, along
with Navy and St. Mary's.

Charleston and Boston joined Stan
ford at 8-3 in a three-way stalemate
for the final qualifying spot.
Neither team defeated each of
the others, so the teams engaged in
a sail-off. After Charleston defeated
Boston in the first segment of the
race-off, the Cougars edged Stan
ford to earn the final qualifying
spot. Stanford and Boston finished
tied for fifth.
"We weren't too bummed," said
Bourdow. "We were definitely in it.
Because the breeze was so heavy,
there were really no surprises."
