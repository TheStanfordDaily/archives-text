# Stenstrom breaks passing records
## 
### 
In what was a disappointing
season for the Stanford football
team, the bright spot for the
Cardinal was the play of senior
quarterback Steve Stenstrom.
Carrying the burden of the
entire offense on his shoulders,
Stenstrom established himself
as one of the nation's premier
passers. While the Cardinal
compiled a 4-7 overall record (2-
5 in the Pacific 10 Conference),
individually Stenstrom compiled
records of a different kind. The
El Toro, Calif., native broke
school and Pac-10 records for
most passing yards in a season
(3,627), most yards in total
offense (3,398), and pass com

pletions (300). He also set a
school record for pass attempts
(455) and tied a Stanford record
for season touchdown passes
(27).
Stenstrom's 1993 accom
plishments caused him to con
sider the National Football
League draft at season's end.
But he decided to return to
improve his chances in the pros,
and to make one final run at the
Rose Bowl.
"Steve is further along than
two out of three NFL quarter
backs in technique, mechanical
ly, and in the decision-making
process," head coach Bill Walsh
said. "It's not hard to note that
as you watch the NFL games.
Mechanically and technically,
he's superior, and he's going to
build on that."
Depending on the Cardinal's
1994 record, Stenstrom's abili
ties could lead to a Heisman
Trophy.
