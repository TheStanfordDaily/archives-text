# Women's soccer loses on penalty kicks
## 
### 
Starting the season with a
new coach after a turbulent off
season, the women's soccer team
quickly showed it would not be
slowed by distractions.
Led by senior forward Sarah
Rafanelli's record-setting sea
son, first-year coach lan
Sawyers' team made short work
of the regular season. Heading
into postseason play with a 16-2-
1 record, the No. 2 Cardinal dis
patched West Coast rivals Santa
Clara and Portland to gain a
berth in the Final Four.
Matching up against 10th
ranked George Mason in the
national semifinal, Stanford
took a 1-0 lead into the closing
minutes of the game before the
Patriots broke through to knot
the score with nine minutes left
in regulation. After four score
less overtime periods, the bal
ance of the game was left to
penalty which doomed the
Cardinal's fate as George Mason
outscored Stanford 3-1.
However, the season was any
thing but a failure. Rafanelli's
20 goals and 8 assists set the
career scoring mark of 148
points, while freshman Erin
Martin burst onto the scene, set
ting a freshman record with 14
goals and 38 points. Senior goal
keeper Leslie Garrard anchored
the near-impenetrable defense
which allowed only eight goals
the entire year and chalked up
17 shutouts.
