# Men's volleyball snubbed for Final Four
## 
### 
Luck definitely was not a lady
on the night of the NCAA wild
card selections, as the Stanford
volleyball squad fell victim to a
brutal game of politics.
Despite winning the Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation title,
the No. 2 Stanford squad (20-9
overall) lost its NCAA Final Four
bid to a relatively unheralded vol
leyball school from Indiana-Pur
due Fort Wayne. To add injury to
insult, IPFW was ranked 11th
nationally and had lost its league
title to the even lowlier Ball State
(No. 15th).
Regardless of this postseason
snubbing, the Cardinal did put
together a season worthy of
national recognition. Rookie
opposite hitter Matt Fuerbringer
exploded onto the scene this year
with a tremendous 763-kill per
formance to shatter the school
record. Coupled with sophomore
swing hitter Mike Lambert's 679
kills, this Ail-American duo
joined forces to lead Stanford to
an overall .370 hitting percentage
— second nationwide to only
UCLA.
Feeding the sets to the Cardi
nal big guns was three-time All-
American Canyon Ceman.
Ceman, who has now hung up his
court shoes in favor of the pro
beach tour, racked up 1,669 regu
lar season sets to claim yet anoth
er Stanford record as his own.
With that kind of talent, the
Cardinal is hoping to look past
this year's disappointments.
Coach Ruben Nieves and compa
ny already have their sights set
on next year's automatic NCAA
Final Four bid.
