# Triple crown for women's swimming
## 
### 
With expectations soaring
high, the Stanford women swim
mers had their opponents across
the country shaking in their gog
gles from day one of Stanford's
stellar season.
The Cardinal, which finished
the year undefeated and unchal
lenged, was crowned NCAA
Champions in March after blow
ing by the talented but out
gunned field.
Coach Richard Quick, who
has not lost a dual meet at
deGuerre Pool, guided this
year's team as it extended its
unbeaten string in head-to-head
competition to 44 straight victo
ries.
Quick nabbed his fourth
championship with the Cardinal
and has a terrific crop of swim
mers who are set to remain and
compete for him next year.
Led by a slew of nation-lead
ing swimmers in almost all

events, Stanford showed excep
tional strength in the freestyle,
backstroke and relay events.
Senior Lea Loveless and junior
Jenny Thompson garnered the
most points for the team at the
NCAA tourney, but this squad
was made up of a number of
quality athletes who all con
tributed to the final goal.
Sophomore Jessica Tong also
made the top-10 list of point
scorers at the NCAA Champi
onships, while Stanford's
freestylists and backstrokers
also contributed heavily to the
Cardinal's drowning of its closest
opponents, Texas and Florida.
Perhaps the greatest part of
the Stanford squad was the suc
cess of its relay teams at the
NCAA Championships. Those
teams, who lived in the shadow
of the lightning-fast relay
squads from Florida, came
through when it counted by
knocking off the favored Gators
in several big relay events.
In the end, however, it was a
total team effort that helped the
Cardinal nab its third straight
NCAA title and fourth in six
years under Quick.
