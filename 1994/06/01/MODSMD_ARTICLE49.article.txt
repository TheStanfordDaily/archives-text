# Men's gymnastics NCAA runner-up
## 
### 
For the two-time defending
national champion Stanford men's
gymnastics team, the 1994 season
was supposed to proceed as simply
as one, two, three. As it turned
out, however, one and two were
easy enough, but three — a third
consecutive NCAA crown —
proved just slightly out of reach.
Initially living up to its expecta
tions, the Cardinal began its quest
for a threepeat by posting an unde
feated regular season record at the
expense of such teams as two-time
NCAA runner-up Nebraska, then-
No. 7 Michigan and then-No. 9
UCLA. To many, it appeared Stan-

ford's highly-touted freshmen
Jamie Ellis, Keith Wiley and lan
Bachrach had quickly melded their
skills with senior tri-captains
Mark Booth and Chris Sey, junior
tri-captain Josh Stein and junior
Jing-Wei Liang to form what
appeared to be another No. 1
team.
However, "two" became the
story of the mighty Cardinal. It
placed second in the Mountain
Pacific Conference Champi
onships to UCLA, second in the
NCAA Western Regional Champi
onships to new-No. 1 Nebraska,
and eventually found itself the
runner-up at NCAAs to the Corn
huskers.
Nonetheless, although "three"
for threepeat never came to pass
for Stanford, the Cardinal posted a
season-high score of 285.925
points during NCAAs and walked
away a proud team.
