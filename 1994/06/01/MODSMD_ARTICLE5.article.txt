# University to absorb $700,000 loss
## Stanford readies for World Cup bonanza 
### Rob Ross Senior staff writer 
"To the rest of the world, it's the biggest
sporting event around. Even bigger than
the Olympics."
That is how Stanford head men's soccer
coach Colin Lindores describes World Cup,
the championship soccer tournament that
will be invading the Stanford campus begin
ning June 20.
The month-long event will be played in
nine cities across the country, including De
troit, Los Angeles, Boston, Dallas, Orlando,

New York, Chicago and Washington, D.C.
Six games are scheduled to be held at Stan
ford Stadium, featuring squads from Rus
sia, Brazil, Cameroon and Switzerland, as
well as matchups in the round-of-16 and
quarterfinals.
While the World Cup is expected to gen
erate $337 million for the Bay Area, it ap
pears that Stanford will absorb a $700,000
loss after the games are over. According to
Director of University Communications
Terry Shepard, Stanford expects to take in
$1.8 million as revenue, while
expenses will total in excess of
$2.5 million.
"IThis shortfall] is approxi
mately the cost of the aluminum
benches, which Stanford consid
ers a capital improvement" to
Stanford Stadium, he said.
About $800,000 of the pro
jected revenue will come from
parking alone, with another
$900,000 coming from World
Cup USA and about $100,000
from concession sales.
Stanford officials expect to
sell out all six games, and are
bracing themselves for crowds
in excess of 86,000. Such large
crowds have called for extraordi
nary security measures.
"We've been working on secu
rity for these games for the past
two years," said Stanford Police
Chief Marvin Herrington.
Herrington, who has traveled
to soccer games around the
world to see how other stadiums
handle large crowds, is in charge
of the security for the games.
His normal Stanford police
force will be augmented by
police from Santa Clara County
and the sheriffs office for the
month surrounding the event.
In addition, the Stanford police
will receive help from the "non
sworn security" who normally
work football and basketball
games and security personnel
hired from Contemporary Ser
vices. The overall force on
games days will total close to
700 people.
This security effort also
includes larger nightly patrols
on non-game nights and person
nel on duty full-time at Stanford
Stadium.
One of the most contentious
aspects of the security effort is
not personnel-related but a
physical object — the fence sep
arating the field from the
stands.
"I feel confident that there
will be no fences in D.C. or Dal
las," said Alan Rothenberg,
chairman and chief executive
officer of World Cup USA 1994.
"So then the only stadium with
a fence will be Stanford, which

has always had one."
The purpose of the fence is to
prevent overzealous fans from
entering the playing area, par
ticularly during large football
games such as Big Game.
But in highly publicized dis
asters at soccer matches in
other countries, enormous num
bers of fans have stormed the
field simultaneously, resulting
in injuries and deaths to people
pressed up against fences.
These events have prompted
World Cup USA officials to
strongly recommend against
having fences in the venues.
Their recommendations have
been heeded in six of the nine
stadiums, and, with negotia
tions still continuing in Dallas
and Washington, it is likely that
Stanford Stadium will be the
only venue with a fence.
"The fence is there to prevent
problems," Herrington said.
"Ours won't even work like a
fence. It has 18 gates to the field
which will break open under
pressure."
Another security feature
which is unique to Stanford Sta
dium is the alcohol policy. While
World Cup officials are urging
other stadiums to halt the sale
of alcoholic beverages at half
time, at Stanford it is not even a
question.
"There will be no alcohol sold
at all in the Stanford Stadium.
That's part of the original stadi
um contract," Herrington said.
"This ban should reduce our
problems significantly."
For the rest of the Stanford
community, traffic is expected to
be one of the major upsets from
the World Cup games. Two of the
games are scheduled for week
days with 12:30 p.m. starting
times, which means headaches
for anyone trying to maneuver
their car around campus.
To lessen the impact, World
Cup has been selling parking
passes in advance which come
with maps of campus. Also, the
fans' cars will be confined to two
parking lots — the Track House
and the Maples lots — and
World Cup officials are offering
discount rates for fans choosing
to arrive via public transit.
Soccer is notorious for having
violence-filled stands, but peo
ple familiar with international

soccer, including Herrington
and Lindores, downplay the
likelihood of excessive difficul
ties at Stanford. The teams com
peting at Stanford have fans
who traditionally are excitable
and demonstrative, but not par
ticularly violent. In addition,
most of the crowd will be Amer
ican, which should dilute poten
tial problems.
"I don't think that we will see
fans clash and run out on the
field," Lindores said. "It will be
a very colorful crowd, but not a
very violent one."
In preparation for the games,
Stanford Stadium has been sig
nificantly renovated. Turf has
been laid on top of the running
track and the pole vault runway
has been torn up. In addition,
World Cup USA paid $500,000
for modifications to the press
box and other structural
changes.
Outside the stadium, more
changes have taken place. World
Cup has installed portable
buildings to be used for enter
tainment, media, broadcasting
and security. In addition, the
Department of Defense has paid
for a six-foot fence to be built
that will ring the entire stadium
complex.
Stanford itself has improved
the inside of the stadium by
tearing out all the wooden
benches and replacing them
with aluminum ones at a cost of
over $600,000.
The other controversy sur
rounding the preparation for
the event has concerned the sod
in Stanford Stadium. Com
mencement will be held next
weekend on the same sod that
the teams will play on only two
weeks later, and World Cup offi
cials have worried that the
placement of the stages neces
sary for graduation may kill the
grass.
But Shepard dismissed those
fears. "I think the sod is a non
issue," he said, pointing out that
the stages have never affected
the grass underneath. More
over, Events and Services staff
will take extra precautions to
keep the grass alive, including
setting the stages on tiles and
working double crews in order
to put them up and remove
them faster, he said.

sporting event around. Even bigger than
the Olympics."

"Ours won't even work like a
fence. It has 18 gates to the field
which will break open under
pressure."
Another security feature
which is unique to Stanford Sta
dium is the alcohol policy. While
World Cup officials are urging
other stadiums to halt the sale
of alcoholic beverages at half
time, at Stanford it is not even a
question.
"There will be no alcohol sold
at all in the Stanford Stadium.
That's part of the original stadi
um contract," Herrington said.
"This ban should reduce our
problems significantly."
For the rest of the Stanford
community, traffic is expected to
be one of the major upsets from
the World Cup games. Two of the
games are scheduled for week
days with 12:30 p.m. starting
times, which means headaches
for anyone trying to maneuver
their car around campus.
To lessen the impact, World
Cup has been selling parking
passes in advance which come
with maps of campus. Also, the
fans' cars will be confined to two
parking lots — the Track House
and the Maples lots — and
World Cup officials are offering
discount rates for fans choosing
to arrive via public transit.
Soccer is notorious for having
violence-filled stands, but peo
ple familiar with international

soccer, including Herrington
and Lindores, downplay the
likelihood of excessive difficul
ties at Stanford. The teams com
peting at Stanford have fans
who traditionally are excitable
and demonstrative, but not par
ticularly violent. In addition,
most of the crowd will be Amer
ican, which should dilute poten
tial problems.
"I don't think that we will see
fans clash and run out on the
field," Lindores said. "It will be
a very colorful crowd, but not a
very violent one."
In preparation for the games,
Stanford Stadium has been sig
nificantly renovated. Turf has
been laid on top of the running
track and the pole vault runway
has been torn up. In addition,
World Cup USA paid $500,000
for modifications to the press
box and other structural
changes.
Outside the stadium, more
changes have taken place. World
Cup has installed portable
buildings to be used for enter
tainment, media, broadcasting
and security. In addition, the
Department of Defense has paid
for a six-foot fence to be built
that will ring the entire stadium
complex.
Stanford itself has improved
the inside of the stadium by
tearing out all the wooden
benches and replacing them
with aluminum ones at a cost of
over $600,000.
The other controversy sur
rounding the preparation for
the event has concerned the sod
in Stanford Stadium. Com
mencement will be held next
weekend on the same sod that
the teams will play on only two
weeks later, and World Cup offi
cials have worried that the
placement of the stages neces
sary for graduation may kill the
grass.
But Shepard dismissed those
fears. "I think the sod is a non
issue," he said, pointing out that
the stages have never affected
the grass underneath. More
over, Events and Services staff
will take extra precautions to
keep the grass alive, including
setting the stages on tiles and
working double crews in order
to put them up and remove
them faster, he said.
"To the rest of the world, it's the biggest
sporting event around. Even bigger than
the Olympics."
That is how Stanford head men's soccer
coach Colin Lindores describes World Cup,
the championship soccer tournament that
will be invading the Stanford campus begin
ning June 20.
The month-long event will be played in
nine cities across the country, including De
troit, Los Angeles, Boston, Dallas, Orlando,

New York, Chicago and Washington, D.C.
Six games are scheduled to be held at Stan
ford Stadium, featuring squads from Rus
sia, Brazil, Cameroon and Switzerland, as
well as matchups in the round-of-16 and
quarterfinals.
While the World Cup is expected to gen
erate $337 million for the Bay Area, it ap
pears that Stanford will absorb a $700,000
loss after the games are over. According to
Director of University Communications
Terry Shepard, Stanford expects to take in
$1.8 million as revenue, while
expenses will total in excess of
$2.5 million.
"IThis shortfall] is approxi
mately the cost of the aluminum
benches, which Stanford consid
ers a capital improvement" to
Stanford Stadium, he said.
About $800,000 of the pro
jected revenue will come from
parking alone, with another
$900,000 coming from World
Cup USA and about $100,000
from concession sales.
Stanford officials expect to
sell out all six games, and are
bracing themselves for crowds
in excess of 86,000. Such large
crowds have called for extraordi
nary security measures.
"We've been working on secu
rity for these games for the past
two years," said Stanford Police
Chief Marvin Herrington.
Herrington, who has traveled
to soccer games around the
world to see how other stadiums
handle large crowds, is in charge
of the security for the games.
His normal Stanford police
force will be augmented by
police from Santa Clara County
and the sheriffs office for the
month surrounding the event.
In addition, the Stanford police
will receive help from the "non
sworn security" who normally
work football and basketball
games and security personnel
hired from Contemporary Ser
vices. The overall force on
games days will total close to
700 people.
This security effort also
includes larger nightly patrols
on non-game nights and person
nel on duty full-time at Stanford
Stadium.
One of the most contentious
aspects of the security effort is
not personnel-related but a
physical object — the fence sep
arating the field from the
stands.
"I feel confident that there
will be no fences in D.C. or Dal
las," said Alan Rothenberg,
chairman and chief executive
officer of World Cup USA 1994.
"So then the only stadium with
a fence will be Stanford, which

has always had one."
The purpose of the fence is to
prevent overzealous fans from
entering the playing area, par
ticularly during large football
games such as Big Game.
But in highly publicized dis
asters at soccer matches in
other countries, enormous num
bers of fans have stormed the
field simultaneously, resulting
in injuries and deaths to people
pressed up against fences.
These events have prompted
World Cup USA officials to
strongly recommend against
having fences in the venues.
Their recommendations have
been heeded in six of the nine
stadiums, and, with negotia
tions still continuing in Dallas
and Washington, it is likely that
Stanford Stadium will be the
only venue with a fence.
"The fence is there to prevent
problems," Herrington said.
"Ours won't even work like a
fence. It has 18 gates to the field
which will break open under
pressure."
