# Athletes charged with statue vandalism
## 
### 
The image of Stanford athlet
ics was tarnished off the field
when eight Stanford varsity ath
letes were allegedly involved in
the vandalism of the "Gay Libera
tion" statue. While the story was
featured on the front page rather
than the sports page, the effects
have just begun to be felt in the
Stanford athletic community.
After a lengthy investigation,
six of the eight students were
charged. Wrestler Tom Irwin and

baseball player Todd La Rocca
were both charged with felony
vandalism. Football players Jason
White and Mark Butterfield and
baseball player Rob Gardner were
charged with misdemeanor van
dalism and resisting arrest, while
baseball player Brian Dallimore
was charged with misdemeanor
vandalism. Dusty Allen and Bren
dan Sullivan, both members of
the baseball team who were origi
nally implicated in the crime,
were not charged with any crimi
nal acts.
All the baseball players except
Allen received at least a one-game
suspension, while Irwin, White
and Butterfield have not received
punishment yet from their
respective teams.
