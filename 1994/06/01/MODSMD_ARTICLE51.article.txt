In its ascendance from worst to
first in the Pacific 10 Conference
Southern Division in 1994, the
Cardinal baseball team relied on a
resurgent pitching staff. Filling the
void created by the loss of Willie
Adams and Andrew Lorraine to the
professional draft, three Stanford
hurlers earned all-conference hon
ors, with Six-Pac Co-Pitcher of the
Year Dan Reed (10-4, 3.38 earned
run average) becoming the Cardi
nal's first-ever player to be so hon
ored. Reed, a crafty sophomore left
hander, posted an 8-1 conference
record in leading Stanford (36-22,
21-9 in the Six-Pac) to a berth in
the NCAA College World Series
Central Regional qualifier.
Freshman righty Jason Middle

brook (7-1, 2.22), also a first-team
all-conference selection, made an
immediate impact on the Stanford
program in his initial campaign.
With a blazing fastball timed in the
high 90 mph range, Middlebrook
made history May 8 when he
became the first Cardinal pitcher
in 13 years to toss a complete-game
no-hitter, blanking the UCLA Bru
ins at Sunken Diamond.
Tom Reimers, a freshman
right-hander, received All-Six-Pac
honorable mention as he paced the
staff with nine saves and a 2.04
ERA. Junior Matt Marenghi,
sophomore Todd Bartels and
freshman Brendan Sullivan also
made significant contributions and
provided head coach Mark Mar
quess with surprising pitching
depth.
Among Stanford's position play
ers, senior designated hitter Nate
Olmstead, junior second baseman
Jed Hansen and sophomore catch
er A.J. Hinch received first-team
All-Conference honors.
