# Tennis swings to 2nd in NCAAs
## 
### 
After seasons in which both were
at times ranked No. 1 in the coun
try, both the men's and women's
tennis teams finished the season as
NCAA runners-up.
The men's team was ranked tops
in the nation for the first half of the
season, and won the National Team
Indoors in Louisville, Ky. at the end
of February. After finishing the
year with a gaudy 22-2 record, with
both losses coming at the hands of
USC, Stanford was seeded second at
the NCAA Championships.

Stanford and the top-seeded Tro
jans were on a crash course, des
tined to meet for a third time in the
finals to decide the national champi
on. After a close and seesaw battle,
the Trojans triumphed 4-3 in the
last set of the last match.
The women's season was similar
in many ways. After a No. 1 ranking
in the preseason, Stanford main
tained a No. 2 ranking until
Indoors, where it lost in the semifi
nals to Florida.
In a season where they finished
23-3, the Stanford women beat a
strong Cal team twice and were
seeded third at the NCAA Champi
onships. Despite beating Texas in
the semis — a team that coaches
called the "best ever" from the Lone
Star state — Stanford lost in the
finals to Georgia, 5-4.
