# Everything Grant-ed Kimberly Chrisman

As I leave Stanford and my career as
a Daily writer for the big bad world
of professional journalism, I'm
tempted to wax nostalgic over the late nights
and the last-minute coups of the past four
years. But, like most journalists, I remember
most vividly the story that got away.
It was about this time last quarter —
Dead Week, that is — that I was offered the
chance to interview Hugh Grant. In person.
One-on-one. In his hotel room. Wearing
only a monogrammed toweL
Of course, I'm speculating. I'll never
know what Hugh was wearing, because I
turned down the interview. Much as I'd en
joyed Hugh's performance in "The Remains
of the Day,"and his work in "Maurice," I had
a thesis to write. Who outside the Merchant-
Ivory crowd had ever heard of Hugh Grant?
It was the mistake of a lifetime. Where
were my journalistic instincts when I needed
them? How was I to know that this pasty lit
tle Brit—best known stateside for wearing a
terrible wig in "Impromptu" and a kilt in
"The Lair of the White Worm" — would
turn out to be the actor of the year, and pos

sibly the decade? Who could have foreseen
the glowing reviews, the late-night talk show
appearances, the highly-ranked place on
People Magazine's "50 Most Beautiful" list?
Even now, I partially attribute Hugh's
success to the general dearth of modern
matinee idols. Consider his cinematic com
petition. Reigning British screen stud
Daniel Day-Lewis donned unsightly bell
bottoms and platform shoes for "In the
Name of the Father." While morally edify
ing, "Schindler's List" and "Philadelphia"
were not exactly lust-inducing, despite the
best efforts of Liam Neeson and Antonio
Banderas, respectively.
The rest of the year's major films were
dominated by unlikely geri-hunks: Tommy
Lee Jones in "The Fugitive," Harvey Keitel in
"The Piano," Clint Eastwood in "In the Line
of Fire" and Anthony Hopkins in every
thing else. No wonder we all stayed home

from the movies to watch "Melrose Place."
Hugh Grant gave us a reason to go back
— three reasons, in fact. First, he lured
"Sirens" audiences away from costar Elle
MacPherson — not an easy task, consider
ing that the Sports Illustrated cover model
spent most of the film in the nude. In "Bit
ter Moon," Hugh played another repressed
Brit — named Nigel, no less — and made
audiences all hot and bothered just by act
ing all hot and bothered himself.
And his oh-so-charming performance as
a perpetual groomsman in the wildly suc
cessful "Four Weddings and a Funeral" sin
gle-handedly revived the romantic comedy
and got us all looking forward to the in
evitable round of June nuptials. I, for one,
have already purchased a large, flowery hat.
Why Hugh Grant? It's a question a lot of
people (guys, mostly) have asked them
selves lately. What is it about this übiquitous

leading man that causes grown women to
squeal at a pitch usually reserved for baby
seals and linen separates?
On dose examination (and I do mean
dose) Hugh is not even all that beautiful. He's
as susceptible as the rest of us to Bad Hair
Days. His face is kind of squinty and tight
lipped, and then there's that problematic chin.
But somehow one senses that, unlike real
British guys, Hugh is much more than a
clipped accent and a boyish grin. He's not
afraid of four-letter words or Bermuda
shorts. He's got the Oxford pedigree without
the pretensions. He recently turned down the
role of James Bond, and I don't think he'll be
doing Shakespeare anytime soon, either.
Indeed, one of the joys any Hugh Grant
film is watching Hugh squirm — with re
vulsion, embarrassment and, finally, guilty
pleasure. He's suave, but not smarmy; at
tractive, but not intimidating; witty, but not
cruel. Tall, dark and befuddled, he's like a
sexy Seinfeld or a young Hopkins.
Let's hope he stays that way. If Hugh
keeps making movies like he has, I may get
that interview yet. ■
