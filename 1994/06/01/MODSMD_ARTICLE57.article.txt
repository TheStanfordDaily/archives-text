6 p.m. The members of Blues Traveler
are late for their soundcheck. "They're
always late," says the woman who
pokes her head out of the tour bus to pla
cate me. "They had some unexpected busi
ness to take care of today in the city." Later,
drummer Brendan Hill will tell me that due
its hectic tour schedule — booked through
the summer, with tentative dates until
Christmas — the band decided at the last
minute to mix its new disc in the S.F. won
derland.
Traveler, the sole self-described "psyche
delic hardcore" band around, has built up a
following around the country from years of
touring — a slow but appropriate maturing
process. "A lot of groups grow up too quick.
We've really built this from when we were
kids in high school. And every year we got a
little by little bigger. Now we can tour the
country and sell out venues like the Fill
more."
But the road is sometimes rough on the
band: "You get kind of wigged in the head
some times. You have to focus and just have
a good time."
6:45 p.m. Blues Traveler is really late for its
soundcheck. A line for tickets is snaking back
from the window next to the line of people
with tickets, and four buff guards are herding
people around. "They ought to be here soon,"
says the familiar woman in the tour bus.
The new album, says Hill in his Irish ac
cent, "has got the general vibe of when we're
playing live. It's our fourth album; we're toy
ing with the idea of calling it 'BT4'." While
Traveler hasn't had a breakthrough record, it
can lay claim to having recorded at least two
undisputed masterpieces, the eponymously
titled first album and the steaming second
platter, "Travelers and Thieves" Hill smiles.
"Hopefully the |new) record will hit and
something will trigger a major response, but
that's not what it's all about."
7:15 p.m. Blues Traveler has altogether
missed any possibility of a soundcheck.
"They always miss soundcheck," Tourbus
Woman complains.
7:45 p.m. "Um, 1 don't think Blues Trav
eler is here yet." That's the official word from
the top. No problem — the band isn't going
on for two more hours because there are two
openers. 1 check with willcall for my passes
— "no Blues Traveler, no tickets," says the
woman at the door. But just then, in a swirl
of sidewalk trash, Mike from the tour bus
runs up to me out of breath: "Brendan's
here, man, if you want to chill with him."
7:46 p.m. The "on the road forever" tour
bus. A plush number with flower print
couches, a stereo, TV, beds, kitchen and a
Powerbook: everything a band needs to keep
up mental health on the road. I question the
lonliness of leaving home for such long
stretches of time and Hill tells me without a
trace of sadness, "We all pretty much stay
single. Once you start marrying and stuff,
it's tougher to get that enthusiasm to go out
on the road for six months." Hill talks with
me about San Francisco, Blues Traveler and
tattoos.
The BT outfit is fronted by lon Popper,
America's preeminent harmonica player,
and an accomplished blues singer and lyri
cist. And he's not limited to songs of lost love
and broken relationships, says Hill: "Jon's
lyrics are really profound sometimes (even

though sometimes people say he's a little long
winded); I think to tell a story well you do
have to expand it. A lot of the songs talk
about history and warfare. There's generally
an optimistic point of view that even though
things are down and out, that eventually
there's a light at the end of the tunnel."
8:30 p.m. Inside the Fillmore. An in
credible club, the walls veritably

dripping with history — from a
photo of Janis and lerry and Bill
Graham smilin' on the late '60s
Haight to one of Perry Farrell
with died red dreads bolting
out Jane's Addiction style j
slam rock. The upstairs bal- (
cony is lined with promo
posters from the '60s and '70s
— Floyd, The Dead, The Who,
Jimi Hendrix — all the legends

played here. And the room vibe
is hot; people are warming up

to opening act Soul

Hat. The room is smoky with pot and an
ticipation.
9:55 p.m. The lights go down and Travel
er's members hit the stage. The energy is ex
ceptional, the crowd is going wild. They open
with some tunes from their first album, then
play some older, unreleased material. Their
relentless onslaught whips the capacity
crowd of just over 1,000 raving fans into a
frenzy.
Blues Traveler didn't get to do a full 220
shows last year because of a motorcycle wreck
that left Popper in a wheelchair for six
months. "We're focused right now on re-es
tablishing ourselves after so much time off,"

Hill

explains.
BT's music

continues to
speak for itself, and
the crowd's reaction

proves it: Blues Traveler
is permanently estab-

lished in the hearts
of these fans.

From soft
< ballads

plucked out on a 12-string guitar by Popper
to tunes that crescendo into driving-rock
classics, Blues Traveler's music is suffused
with an indomitable energy.
Guitarist Chan Kinchla and bassist Bobby
Sheenan get into a groove, mixing up fast
picking and fantastic blues runs on guitar
with super-solid, melodic bass lines. They
jam for over an hour, take a quick break which
Popper ends to an applauding crowd by say
ing, "Thanks, but we're still just warming up."
12:30 a.m. Popper looks over at Kinchla
in surprise and smiles: "A late-breaking
news-flash: Warren Haynes from the All
man Brothers is going to sit in." In a musi
cal moment which proves the lasting im
pact of Blues Traveler, the 15-minute jam
with Haynes on Traveler's classic blues bal
lad "Crystal Flame" leaves the crowd
breathless.
After churning through rocked-out ver
sions of classic tunes like "Gloria" and "Low
Rider," the sweet melody of "Crystal Flame"
would be an appropriate end to a super
charged evening: but no, the band's ready for
at least three more of their signature extend
ed jams before the night is complete.
"People just don't sit and listen to music as
much as they used to — to lie back and listen
to a record is one of the greatest things of my
growing up — just to play with the music and
feel where it goes without visual stimulation,
and going out to see concerts just gives you
new strength in a way — it's a like swimming
in the ocean, making your body move — it's
a different kind of language." As a typical BT
show proves.
Late July, 1994. Blues Traveler will be back
in the Bay Area in July with the LollapaJooza
rivaling Florde Tour (which may well make it

to your home
town too),
headlined by
the Allman
Brothers Band.
Other bands
that will be on
the tour in
clude Big Head
Todd and the
Monsters (a
word from Hill:
"Big Head
Todd did last
year: he's got a
really good gui
tar-driven rock
band, and he
got all the
girls!"), the
Dave Mathews
band, and on
the second
stage, the
Aquarium Res
cue Unit
("They're just
so integral to
making some-

thing happen — they've just karma coming
out their ears"). Making special appearances
throughout the summer will be The Black
Crowes and Cypress Hill — watch for special
jams with the Traveler. It will he a funked up,
rocked out spectacle not to miss. ■
