# Welcome to funky S.F.
## Your guide the who, where, why, when and what of the scene

Just when you thought the scene was
cashed, techno was dead and all you had to
look forward to was the club scene in
"Basic Instinct," funky San Francisco makes a
revival ot the most righteous kind. Take the
hardest techno, lay on the liquid beats of acid
jazz, tweak out the trance to full dopadelics
and slow-cook in the flavors of funk, disco
and soul until you have a city under one
house groove called San FranDisco.
In the aftermath of Toon Town, Love
Garage and Groove Kitchen, San Francisco
has managed to reconstruct the house and
techno community into a small and dedicat
ed subculture. Gone are the massives of '92,
when it seemed everyone and their rabbi was
kicking L.A. style at sites all across the coun
try. What you'll fond now are more intimate
gatherings — renegades, if you will — where
the vibe is always good and the scene is all
about the get down.

It is Saturday, and we are waiting for the
word on Wicked, the leader in the new school
ot raves. The Wicked ones (a posse coonposed
of Garth, Markie, Jeno and Thomas) consis
tently fuel the scene with their onad energy
and wikkid-style. The party goes off every
few weeks, rotating between King Street
garage, Townsend, and 1015.
Tonight the party is in the basement of
1015, and at 2 a.m., the room is filled with
sweating bodies dancing to the techno infer
no. I swallow ony energy-packed Vitamin E
pill, close my eyes, and dive into the sea of free
love and cheap sex. It is maybe 120 degrees
down here, but no one shows any signs of let
ting up on the agro pace. A woman comes up
behind me and starts rubbing ony back. "This
is insane," she whispers into my ear.
On the first Wednesday of every month,
something very special happens at 1015 Fol
som. TheComeUnity family comes together to
produce the purest vibe in San Francisco. The
house DJs, Garth, Jeno and Simon, spin the
slickest acid tunes for the funk junkies and the
seriously hardcore. Simon is up when we get

there, spinning Brooklyn-style breakbeats that
oio one seems to be able to get into. The main
room is packed with familiar faces, big smiles
and rave-fashionable hugs in full supply.
Simon carries us through for two hours
without a miss, until Jeno, technoshaman ex
traordinaire, comes on and sends the party
into outer space. Keoki, Dmitry, Johnny
Dynell and Derrick Carter should prepare to
step off. Jeno is undoubtedly the hottest DJ
on the West Coast, redefining the house
scene as we know it. His rare grooves are just
beginning to come back to the stratosphere
when the police pull the plugs and shut down
the party. About 100 people stay around after
the music had stopped, still in a daze and
hoping that somehow the music would come
back on.
After a solid weekend of the scene, the oc
casional Basics party, thrown by Martin, one
ot the saints of the rave world, will bring you
back down to Earth. I chased down the last

one (via an old-style map point) and
found myself in an old warehouse in
Berkeley. It was cold with lots of

cement, as ware
houses

tend to be,

but once
the Basics
crew got on
the tables,

heat wasn't
the issue.
These parties
make you

realize why San Francisco is one of the best
scenes around nowadays. In the morning,
Martin brings out muffins and orange juice
and everyone collapses on blankets.
We split Basics for a friend's pad, do the
freshen-up-and-shower thing, and then walk
over to Light-n-Up (1015 Folsom, 9 a.m.-5
p.m. Sundays, 267-7615). Light-n-Up, the
mutant offspring of the now-defunct Boogie
Buffet, seems to be the feeding grounds for
the burnt and tweaked. I found a big bean bag
and reclined under the skylights while Ernie
Munson let the needle hit slow wax. Rick Pre
ston, the man behind the curtains for this
whole affair, has added some Dali-esque sky
and clouds to the walls since the Boogie Buf
fet days, putting a surreal spin to the after
hours scene.
After a while the rest of the entourage gets
anxious, so off we head to the End-Up (6th &
Harrison 543-7770). Within walking dis
tance from Light-n-Up, it's worth paying the
minimal cover at both parties and just wan
dering back and forth between them. The
End-Up is a mixed club for the hardcore Sun
day afternoon partier. It's kind of like taking
a Sunday afternoon drive at 100 mph while
Aaron O and Swing Kid do it up your ear
hole. Of course you can always pull over and
mellow it in the outdoor patio, or hitch back
to Light-n-Up to watch the girls dance on the
skylights.

We are waiting at the pier
by the Flood Building

C 7
for the barge to
arrive for

th e

monthly Bulletproof boat Party (5-9 p.m ,
Pier 1. Tickets and info at Bulletproof, 629
Haight, 255-7168.) Along with Stone
Groove, which goes on every Wednesday at
Miss Pearl's Jam House, the folks at Bullet
proof throw the boat party on the last Sunday
of every month. On the top deck, where
everyone who's anyone is drinking their
French beer and smoking their French ciga
rettes, the tastiest acid jazz in town is being
spun by the likes of Aaron O and lulius Papp.
After the boat party, some of us head over
to Spundae (21 and over, $5 before midnight,
55 Natoma, 974-9389), the slammingest
thing happening on Sunday nights, in the
basement of L)VB. Spundae is a club that in
sists on style over substance (but not sub
stance abuse). These are the fabulous hyp
ocrites who work out all day and then smoke
and do drugs all night. These are the people
who somehow find it socially-acceptable to
remove their shirts on the dance floor and
spray us all with their Armani-soaked sweat.
These are the people who wake up at two in
the afternoon, make themselves a martini,
drop acid and wait for the party to start. Love
them or hate them — they're here, they drink
expensive beer, get used to it.
Spundae is the everyman's club, where
drugs, sex and Evian can all be found for the
right price. The sound is usually tribal and
techno, but Carlos, Henrik and Markie Mark
have dropped the bomb tonight with their
own brand of acid house. On the car ride
home, I chant to myself, "Activator ... Acti
vator ... You need some Activator..."
Monday night finally comes around and
we're back at it again. We get our best, kool
kat-acid-jazz-threads on and cab it over to
Jazid Up (1190 Folsom, Monday, 10 p.m.-4
a.m., 905-8811). This is where the "I'm beau
tiful and I have the luxury to party on a Mon
day night" crowd hangs out. Unphased, 1
make my way over to the bar feeling like I was
running the fashion 500, roller-derby style.
It's worth the effort though. At the bar a smil
ing, dreadlocked girl is waiting with compli
mentary hors d'oeuvres and cigarettes.
The back room is cooler than Kerouac as
the likes of Thomas, Julius Papp and Mark
Farina let it all hang out with their sly and
smooth sounds. We sweat it out on the
dance-floor and wander home to bed with
dreams of Tuesday night at Together (1015
Folsom, 10 p.m.-3:30 a.m., 979-8825), one of
those parties that is the bread and butter of
the San Francisco scene. If Together is the
bread and butter, 1015 Folsom is definitely
