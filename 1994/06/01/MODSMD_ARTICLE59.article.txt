# Another Year in Review

Before you bury yourself in a huge heap of books
for that class you haven't been to all quarter long,
indulge yourself in some entertainment. Well, if you
really can't, at least take the time to glance at yet an
other entertainment year in review. It's easy and pain
less. You don't need to use your dazed brain to stroll
through the topsy-turvy year — a year marked by
steady falls and spectacular rises on the silver screen, a
year where the biggest music story really had nothing
to do with music and a year punctuated with a flour
ish of performing arts on campus.

Twelve months ago, Tommy Lee Jones was
a mere mortal, Sylvester Stallone was in the
doghouse and Arnold Schwarzenegger could
do no wrong. Tom Hanks was straight and
sleepless in Seattle. Holly Hunter could talk
and play the piano. Gerry Conlon was an un
known. Auschwitz was the province of histo
rians. And Vietnam enjoyed a brief respite
from the filmic assaults of Oliver Stone.
What a difference a year makes.
Jones is well on his way to stardom, Stallone
has graduated to the outhouse and
Schwarzenegger's shooting star is now on a
downward spiral. Hanks played a straight man
passing for gay and picked up an Oscar in the
process. Hunter stopped talking, kept playing
and earned a well-deserved statuette ot her own.
Conlon, looking an awful lot like Daniel Day-
Lewis, became every housewife's wet dream.
Auschwitz s infamous showers, known for their
poisonous vapor jined harmless waters on
concentration camp Jews in Steven Spielbergs
Nazi redemption story. And the Vietnamese,
who have certainly suffered enough, were invad
ed once more — historically speaking — by
Oliver Stone's worst film to date.
The last 12 months in film have been like
any other period — a mixture of good ("In
the Line of Lire'), bad ("The Firm") and ugly
("True Romance"). 1993-1994 was the year
the screenplay nearly became extinct. "Juras

sic Park," "The Fugitive," "What's l ove Got
lb Do With It and I he Age of Innocence"
were all examples of films that succeeded de
spite scripts that ranged from 'not good
enough' to stinks to high heaven.' On the
other end of the spectrum, Quentin Taranti
nos savage white trash wit barely escaped
lony Scott s toothless, MTV-slick direction
in "True Romance."
I he budgets kept getting bigger, but imag
inations continued to shrink in almost direct
proportions. Wesley Snipes was a melancholy
drug dealer in "Sugar Hill" and"The 21st
Century's Most Ruthless Criminal" in the fu

turistic "Demolition Man," proving crirrn
still wears a black face no matter what tim<
you're in. The compelling, self-referentia
premise of "Last Action Hero" foil victim to .
Schwarzenegger-size ego that dumbed i
down so much that even the audience caugh
on. Film versions of "The Firm" and"The Pel
ican Brief" exposed the essential mediocrity
of John Grisham's writing, but the megawatl
smiles of Tom (Tuise and Julia Roberts blind
ed viewers enough to fork over $7 a head.
Even geniuses couldn't deliver what they
promised. Martin Scorsese proved that New
York — whether 1890 or 1990— was his turf.

But his adap
tation of "The
Age of Inno
cence" failed
to touch the
heart even as
it dazzled the
eye. David
Cronenberg's
ruthless intel
ligence pared
away the
sm oke-and
mirrors of
David Henry
Hwang's "M.
Butterfly,"
only to find

that there was nothing left. The result was a
perverse look at obsession that bored — until
the final, kick-in-the-gut 15 minutes. And
Jonathan Demme's courage failed him when
he needed the most, turning Hollywood's
first AIDS film into a cowardly, dramatically
inert piece of work.
Only those who walked where Hollywood
feared to tread redeemed '93-'94 in film. Jane
Campion created an accessible masterpiece
without shedding her quirky sensibility in
I he Piano. Zhang Yimou shed his formally

precise style and tragic sensibility for a looser,
comic approach in "The Story of Qiu )u" a
biting satire of contemporary China.
His countryman Chen Kaige picked up the
tragic slack with "Farewell My Concubine," an
epic whose melodrama never overwhelmed
its humanity. Belgium, for its part, showed
that ultra-violence can be found outside the
States, evidenced by its faux-documentary,
serial killer comedy "Man Bites Dog."
Finally, it was actors that made '93-'94
worthwhile. Even as Robert De Niro and Al
Facino continued their decline, Ralph Fiennes

("Schindler's List") and Laurence Fishburne
("What's Love Got to Do With It") stepped up
to the plate and swung for the fences. Ashle\
Judd ("Ruby in Paradise") put the IJollywootl
ingenue club on notice, as did Leonardo Di
Caprio ("What's Eating Gilbert Grape"). John
Malkovich and Jones proved that the hero's
opponent can be far more compelling than
the hero himself. But it was two career-mak
ing performances — Hunter in "The Piano"
and David Thewlis in "Naked" — that showed
that acting, an art almost as extinct as Spiel
berg's dinosaurs, still had a spark of life left.

And the award for hardest working hip
hop producer goes to Andre Young (a.k.a. Dr.
Dre) of Death Row Records.
While not the first rap covered on the
pages of Intermission this school year (that
honor goes to so-so grunge/rap experiment
Judgment Night"), his contributions to the
jeep-beat smorgasbord were perhaps the
most eagerly anticipated of the year's releases.
And what's more, the funk in his trunk sin

first came Snoop Doggy Dogg's solid but
over-hyped "Doggystyle." Nipping at its heels
was the la/y funk of Domino's "Ghetto Jam,"
as if to suggest that the Dre's patented sound
isn t as air-tight as one might suspect. But
with the prominent contributions of Snoop,
Warren (i and Nate Dogg — all of Dogg
I'ound affiliation — on the recently released
Above the Rim" soundtrack, it seems clear
that the ganusta funk continuum becins and

ends with I )re and his homies.
Of course, it wouldn't be much of a year
without at least a couple of blatant disap
pointments. At the top of the list this time are
the less than-radiant Cypress Hill follow-up
Black Sunday" and Ice Cube's dull "Lethal
Injection," which collectively proved that
even important rappers with nothing to say
musically or lyrically can still get the finger.
Up the coast, in another hip-hop enclave,
Del the Funky Homosapien's Hieroglyphic
homies, the Souls of Mischief, made tracks of
a different kind with their release " '93 'til In
finity" and a national tour with Do La Soul
("Buhloone Mindstate") and A Tribe Called
Quest ("Midnight Marauders"), who along
with KRS One ("Return of the Boom Bap"),
and relative new comer Nas ("Illmatic") re
mind us how the East Coast rocks.
Other notable releases include Digital Un
derground's "The Body Hat Syndrome," the
lungle Brothers' "JBeez Wit the Remedy,"
Gang Starr's "Hard to Earn," Casual's "Fear
Itself" and Leaders of the New School to
name just a few. But as interesting as the it is
to look back over the past year, it's clear that
with the pending releases of the Black Sheep,
Arrested Development, Digable Planets,
Nice n' Smooth, Public Enemy and the Beast
ie Boys, if for no other reason than sheer
album volume, the summer is likely to be too
hot to handle.
On the rock scene, Nirvana and Pearl Jam
ushered in the new school year with two of
the biggest albums of the year. "In Utero"and
"Vs." paralleled one another in a couple of re
spects: both albums changed names several
times, debuted at number one on the Bill
board charts and left mainstream media call
ing one or the other or both the "voice of
Generation X." In fact, Pearl Jam even hit the
cover of Time — and we call it "alternative"
music.
As for Nirvana, everyone knows what
happened and everyone has an opinion —
and we don't have anything new to add. Still,
it's a shame that musically and emotionally
powerful band won't be making any dynam
ic tunes in the future.
Smashing Pumpkins joined the Seattle
duo in the rock stratosphere with their pop
ular sophomore efort, "Siamese Dream.'
They'll be playing up that popularity this
summer as Lollapalooza headliners. New fa

garnering album-of-1993 nods from a num
ber of oh-so-influential publications. The
powerful Portland duo the Spinanes left its
mark, being the first Sub-Pop band to hit
number one on the college charts.
Concert-goers had a nice selection of
shows this year. An energetic warm-up show
by Nine Inch Nails at the Edge attracted
loads of Stanford students during Dead
Week last quarter. Yet perhaps the most dy
namic performances occurred just a week
ago when touring favorites Phish passed

On the rock scene, Nirvana and Pearl Jam

Before you bury yourself in a huge heap of books

that acting, an art almost as extinct as Spiel

even important rappers with nothing to say

Up the coast, in another hip-hop enclave,

On the rock scene, Nirvana and Pearl Jam

As for Nirvana, everyone knows what

Before you bury yourself in a huge heap of books
for that class you haven't been to all quarter long,
indulge yourself in some entertainment. Well, if you
really can't, at least take the time to glance at yet an
other entertainment year in review. It's easy and pain
less. You don't need to use your dazed brain to stroll
through the topsy-turvy year — a year marked by
steady falls and spectacular rises on the silver screen, a
year where the biggest music story really had nothing
to do with music and a year punctuated with a flour
ish of performing arts on campus.

Twelve months ago, Tommy Lee Jones was
a mere mortal, Sylvester Stallone was in the
doghouse and Arnold Schwarzenegger could
do no wrong. Tom Hanks was straight and
sleepless in Seattle. Holly Hunter could talk
and play the piano. Gerry Conlon was an un
known. Auschwitz was the province of histo
rians. And Vietnam enjoyed a brief respite
from the filmic assaults of Oliver Stone.
What a difference a year makes.
Jones is well on his way to stardom, Stallone
has graduated to the outhouse and
Schwarzenegger's shooting star is now on a
downward spiral. Hanks played a straight man
passing for gay and picked up an Oscar in the
process. Hunter stopped talking, kept playing
and earned a well-deserved statuette ot her own.
Conlon, looking an awful lot like Daniel Day-
Lewis, became every housewife's wet dream.
Auschwitz s infamous showers, known for their
poisonous vapor jined harmless waters on
concentration camp Jews in Steven Spielbergs
Nazi redemption story. And the Vietnamese,
who have certainly suffered enough, were invad
ed once more — historically speaking — by
Oliver Stone's worst film to date.
The last 12 months in film have been like
any other period — a mixture of good ("In
the Line of Lire'), bad ("The Firm") and ugly
("True Romance"). 1993-1994 was the year
the screenplay nearly became extinct. "Juras

sic Park," "The Fugitive," "What's l ove Got

enough' to stinks to high heaven.' On the

the final, kick-in-the-gut 15 minutes. And
Jonathan Demme's courage failed him when
he needed the most, turning Hollywood's
first AIDS film into a cowardly, dramatically
inert piece of work.
Only those who walked where Hollywood
feared to tread redeemed '93-'94 in film. Jane
Campion created an accessible masterpiece
without shedding her quirky sensibility in
I he Piano. Zhang Yimou shed his formally

precise style and tragic sensibility for a looser,
comic approach in "The Story of Qiu )u" a
biting satire of contemporary China.
His countryman Chen Kaige picked up the
tragic slack with "Farewell My Concubine," an
epic whose melodrama never overwhelmed
its humanity. Belgium, for its part, showed
that ultra-violence can be found outside the
States, evidenced by its faux-documentary,
serial killer comedy "Man Bites Dog."
Finally, it was actors that made '93-'94
worthwhile. Even as Robert De Niro and Al
Facino continued their decline, Ralph Fiennes

("Schindler's List") and Laurence Fishburne
("What's Love Got to Do With It") stepped up
to the plate and swung for the fences. Ashle\
Judd ("Ruby in Paradise") put the IJollywootl
ingenue club on notice, as did Leonardo Di
Caprio ("What's Eating Gilbert Grape"). John
Malkovich and Jones proved that the hero's
opponent can be far more compelling than
the hero himself. But it was two career-mak
ing performances — Hunter in "The Piano"
and David Thewlis in "Naked" — that showed
that acting, an art almost as extinct as Spiel
berg's dinosaurs, still had a spark of life left.

And the award for hardest working hip
hop producer goes to Andre Young (a.k.a. Dr.
Dre) of Death Row Records.
While not the first rap covered on the
pages of Intermission this school year (that
honor goes to so-so grunge/rap experiment
Judgment Night"), his contributions to the
jeep-beat smorgasbord were perhaps the
most eagerly anticipated of the year's releases.

first came Snoop Doggy Dogg's solid but
over-hyped "Doggystyle." Nipping at its heels
was the la/y funk of Domino's "Ghetto Jam,"
as if to suggest that the Dre's patented sound
isn t as air-tight as one might suspect. But
with the prominent contributions of Snoop,
Warren (i and Nate Dogg — all of Dogg
I'ound affiliation — on the recently released
Above the Rim" soundtrack, it seems clear
that the ganusta funk continuum becins and

ends with I )re and his homies.
Of course, it wouldn't be much of a year
without at least a couple of blatant disap
pointments. At the top of the list this time are
the less than-radiant Cypress Hill follow-up
Black Sunday" and Ice Cube's dull "Lethal
Injection," which collectively proved that
even important rappers with nothing to say
musically or lyrically can still get the finger.
Up the coast, in another hip-hop enclave,
Del the Funky Homosapien's Hieroglyphic
homies, the Souls of Mischief, made tracks of
a different kind with their release " '93 'til In
finity" and a national tour with Do La Soul
("Buhloone Mindstate") and A Tribe Called
Quest ("Midnight Marauders"), who along
with KRS One ("Return of the Boom Bap"),
and relative new comer Nas ("Illmatic") re
mind us how the East Coast rocks.
Other notable releases include Digital Un
derground's "The Body Hat Syndrome," the
lungle Brothers' "JBeez Wit the Remedy,"
Gang Starr's "Hard to Earn," Casual's "Fear
Itself" and Leaders of the New School to
name just a few. But as interesting as the it is
to look back over the past year, it's clear that
with the pending releases of the Black Sheep,
Arrested Development, Digable Planets,
Nice n' Smooth, Public Enemy and the Beast
ie Boys, if for no other reason than sheer
album volume, the summer is likely to be too
hot to handle.
On the rock scene, Nirvana and Pearl Jam
ushered in the new school year with two of
the biggest albums of the year. "In Utero"and
"Vs." paralleled one another in a couple of re
spects: both albums changed names several
times, debuted at number one on the Bill
board charts and left mainstream media call
ing one or the other or both the "voice of
Generation X." In fact, Pearl Jam even hit the
cover of Time — and we call it "alternative"
music.
As for Nirvana, everyone knows what
happened and everyone has an opinion —
and we don't have anything new to add. Still,
it's a shame that musically and emotionally
powerful band won't be making any dynam
ic tunes in the future.
Smashing Pumpkins joined the Seattle
duo in the rock stratosphere with their pop
ular sophomore efort, "Siamese Dream.'
They'll be playing up that popularity this
summer as Lollapalooza headliners. New fa

the alternative scene. Counting Crows and

Seminal new artists made '93-'94 an inter
esting year for college rock. Liz Phair's daz
zling debut "F.xile in Guyville" turned many
a head with its unabashed sexual politics,
garnering album-of-1993 nods from a num
ber of oh-so-influential publications. The
powerful Portland duo the Spinanes left its
mark, being the first Sub-Pop band to hit
number one on the college charts.
Concert-goers had a nice selection of
shows this year. An energetic warm-up show
by Nine Inch Nails at the Edge attracted
loads of Stanford students during Dead
Week last quarter. Yet perhaps the most dy
namic performances occurred just a week
ago when touring favorites Phish passed

The Stanford Chamber Chorale flour

Broadway showtune revue, the group made
a welcome venture into musical theater with
an elegant, enchanting production of "A Lit

donym Stanford Light Opera Workshop.
On the musicals scene, the Stanford Savo

up this spring with "Guys and Dolls," but

Stanford drama icon Babak Ebrahimian and
his Experimental Theatre Laboratory made
their swan song with a self-written, self-di
rected "Three Blind Mice," an experimental
piece that explored what can happen in a

Meanwhile, the Drama Department got
serious, tackling the Romanian Revolution
drama "Mad Forest," Sartre and the life of
George Sand, with varying degrees of suc
cess but constant innovation. Of note was
Bertolt Brecht's "In the Jungle of the Cities."
Under the expert direction of Brecht disciple
Max Weber, the play dissected the alienation
of American urban lite in '2()s with psycho
logical realism.
