# Self-defense class in limbo
## University to ask government to clarify rules 
### Beth Berselli Staff writer 
The University decided yesterday to ask the U.S.
Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights for
"technical assistance" to determine whether the
women's self-defense class violates a federal gender
discrimination law.
As a result of a meeting yesterday between top
Stanford administrators and supporters of the
course, the federal government will be requested to
provide a legal assessment as to whether Title IX pro
hibits segregating self-defense sections by gender.
"We are going to ask the Office of Civil Rights for
technical assistance to determine what the lawful
configuration is for a course like this," said Assoc.
General Counsel Iris Brest.
"Issues in Self-Defense for Women," which was of
fered through the Program in Feminist Studies, was

canceled fall quarter after an anonymous complaint
was made to the Office of Civil Rights. The complaint
asserted that segregating sections by gender violated
Title IX, a 1972 regulation prohibiting sex discrimi
nation in schools which receive federal funding.
At that time, the University refused to let the gov
ernment investigate whether the class was truly in vi
olation of Title IX, and instead told the sponsors to
alter the course's format so that it was either coed or
strictly a physical education, single-sex class.
Members of the Women Defending Ourselves Col
lective — who currently teach the class off campus —
submitted a 50-page legal brief to Provost Condoleez
za Rice and Brest last month.
The brief asserts that the class does not violate
Title IX because the regulation allows women-only
courses which serve an affirmative-action purpose or
compensate women for past and
existing discrimination.
Authors of the brief said their
intention is to convince the Univer
sity that the class is legitimate on
legal grounds, and thus can, if rein
stated, withstand future com
plaints.
At yesterday's meeting, Univer
sity officials agreed to reinstate the
class if the Office of Civil Rights
finds it does not violate Title IX,
said Margaret Hodder, a collective
member. "We're very happy that
Stanford has declared its support
for the class. We're all working
toward the same objective — get
ting the class back on campus," she
said.
The Office of Civil Rights will
issue a finding, which will essential
ly be a verdict as to whether the
class violates Title EX, said Kirsten

Daehler, a member of the collective.
The finding will protect against
future complaints because "com
plaining to a body that has already
said a class is okay is a moot point,"
Daehler said.
Collective members and Univer
sity officials will jointly submit per
tinent information to the San Fran
cisco branch of the Office of Civil
Rights within the next 30 days. The
office will issue a finding within the
next few months, Hodder said.
Members of the collective are
optimistic that the office will "issue
a finding in our favor," Hodder
said.
What form the class takes will
"depend on what the Office of Civil
Rights says," Brest said. "The
material in the course is clearly
valuable, and I would regret if it
was lost to the Stanford communi
ty."
Collective members are explor
ing changing the format of the
class, but say that it will remain
"single-sex only," Daehler said.
