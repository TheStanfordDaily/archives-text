# Self-defense class in limbo
## University to ask government to clarify rules

The University decided yesterday to ask the U.S.
Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights for
"technical assistance" to determine whether the
women's self-defense class violates a federal gender
discrimination law.
As a result of a meeting yesterday between top
Stanford administrators and supporters of the
course, the federal government will be requested to
provide a legal assessment as to whether Title IX pro

technical assistance to determine what the lawful
configuration is for a course like this," said Assoc.
General Counsel Iris Brest.
"Issues in Self-Defense for Women," which was of

was made to the Office of Civil Rights. The complaint
asserted that segregating sections by gender violated
Title IX, a 1972 regulation prohibiting sex discrimi
nation in schools which receive federal funding.
At that time, the University refused to let the gov
ernment investigate whether the class was truly in vi
olation of Title IX, and instead told the sponsors to
alter the course's format so that it was either coed or
strictly a physical education, single-sex class.
Members of the Women Defending Ourselves Col
lective — who currently teach the class off campus —
submitted a 50-page legal brief to Provost Condoleez
za Rice and Brest last month.
The brief asserts that the class does not violate
Title IX because the regulation allows women-only
courses which serve an affirmative-action purpose or
