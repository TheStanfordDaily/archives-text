## 'Little Buddha' tastes bad and less filling 
### 
A shockingly slow, simple-minded film,
"Little Buddha" doesn't venture below the sur
face trappings of Buddhism or suggest how it
might be relevant to the needs of modern life.
It's a showy setpiece — complete with ele
phants, gold trinkets, saffron robes and kalei
doscopic mandalas — but ultimately the film
falls apart from a limp script that's simply dead
on arrival.
This is disappointing news, considering
Bernardo Bertolucci's previous work, which
includes "Last Tango in Paris," "1900" and
"The Last Emperor," films no less ambitious in
scale than "Little Buddha," but that neverthe
less managed to avoid fumbling around a
wilderness of ineffectual plotting and stale
characters.
Initially, it appears that Bridget Fonda and
Chris Isaak play a handsome yuppie couple in
Seattle with a cute son who might be a reincar
nated Tibetan lama. However, as Tibetan
monks begin to infiltrate this happy home, in
tending to bring the kid back to Bhutan, we re
alize that the whole Seattle story is merely a
cover for Bertolucci to tell the story of Sid
dhartha's enlightenment.
Fonda's and Isaak's sketchily drawn charac
ters probably explain their embalmed perfor
mances — they seem resigned to the fact that
half the film is set sometime before the birth of
Christ As parents, they don't seem bothered by
strange Tibetan monks talking about reincarna
tion, who want to pull their kid from grade
school and perform strange rites on him in
Bhutan.
Those unfamiliar with the story of Sid
dhartha might find Bertolucci's eye for spectac
ular detail and Vittorio Storaro's give-it-a-gold
sheen cinematography ravishing for several
minutes. But the stilted dialogue and acting —
people stand with their legs apart as though they

were calling fire from heaven
—are wincingly painful and
leave the audience shrug
ging their shoulders and
staring at the ceiling.
Keanu Reeves' Sid
dhartha bumbles around,
alternately growing his hair
out and cutting it back, a ju
venile, clueless warrior
prince whose spiritual quest
seems more kooky than
compelling.
And some of Bertolucci's
direction, which leans to
wards the exotic and the lav
ish, falters at times. Sid
dhartha's agonizing deci
sion to abandon his cozy life
and loving family is glossed
over, while other moments
seem unnecessarily long or
infused with lame special ef
fects like time lapse photos
of migrating clouds.
It seems that Bertolucci,
thinking that Siddhartha's
story ended with his en
lightenment under the
bodhi tree, found himself
staring at 45 minutes of cel
luloid and thought that a
white, well-to-do American

family exposing itself to Buddhism could be
grafted to the Siddhartha story.
But it's after the bodhi tree episode that Sid
dhartha delivered his discovery to others, ex
pounding on fundamental concepts such as
emptiness and compassion with inquisitive
disciples. "Little Buddha" could have used
more of this kind of explication and fewer

homilies.
Like so many other films on Asian culture,
"Little Buddha" seems more interested in mys
tical accouterments and trinkets, special effects
and Oriental mysteries, not the ideas that Bud
dhists carry with them throughout the world.
This romanticism is dangerous: rather than
approaching Buddhism as a highly developed,

though clearly foreign, system of religious
thought, it cloaks it in a fuzzy-wuzzy veil that
makes it appear overly mysterious — depen
dent on hazy states of mind rather than firm
understanding, on simple-minded platitudes,
rather than a clear examination of those uni
versal problems that religion seeks to answer.

In perhaps the casting oversight of the century, Keanu Reeves "portrays" Siddhartha In Bernardo
Bertolucci's disapponting "Little Buddha."
