# "Kika"

Those who loved Roberto Almodovar's
most recent flicks like "High Heels" for their
outlandish pop feel will surely love his
newest piece of Spanish surreal-pop, "Kika."
However, while maintaining an in-your-face
portrayal of Spain's sub-and-pop cultures,
the movie fails to deliver a fully rendered
plot, leaving the viewer looking for meaning
where there really is none.

The movie focuses on the life of cosme
tologist Kika, who, unhappy in her mar
riage, seeks the love of her husband's suave,
widower step-father who lives in the up
stairs apartment. A writer scrounging for a

living, he was the
sole witness to the
suicide of Kika's
mother-in-law's
suicide. Kika's hus
band, of course,
harbors well
placed resentment
against him, both
for his relationship
with his mother
and his new affair
with his wife.
Enter Andrea,

a.k.a. "Scarface," mistress/anchorwoman of
the hit TV show "Today's Worst" — an
"Emergency 911" type of exploitative show
that airs video-taped murders, rapes and
the like — who also lusts after the
writer/widower. In fact, all the movie's
women seem to be lusting after him. Sadly,
their love is highly misplaced as the climac
tic end reveals.
If the tangle of relationships so far men
tioned sounds confusing, it is. Add a dash of
spice when Kika's lesbian maid's semi-re
tarded brother escapes from prison (for a
crime that Andrea fortunately captured on
film) and searches out Kika's home. Throw in
a serial killer or two, and that sums up
Almodovar's latest that could have benefited
from either a tighter, more cohesive plot, or
the addition of a transvestite detective/pop
singer similar to the one we all loved in "High
Heels."
Overlooking the scattered nature of the
film, it is a pure visual delight. From Almod
ovar's characteristic use of bright plastics and
vinyls to the phenomenal costumes (espe
cially Andrea's fantastic easy-rider/camera
woman costume), the movie is delightful
post-modern eye-candy to the viewer.
It's unmistakably Almodovar, but defi
nitely not his best to date.
