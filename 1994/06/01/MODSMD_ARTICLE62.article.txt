# "Babyfever"

### 
Like his previous "Eating," Henry Jaglom's
new film "Babyfever" revolves around a large
group of women talking about a particular
subject. And boy, do they talk — over half the
film is devoted to a running conversation at a
baby shower where giving birth is explored in
all its complexity.
"Babyfever" has a rudimentary plot, fo
cusing on Jenna (Victoria Foyt), who may or
may not be pregnant by a man who may or
may not be the man she wants to have chil
dren with. But this plot only acts as a frame
for the conversation that makes up the
"meat" of the story.
"Babyfever" attempts to deal with the
complex issues surrounding modern preg
nancy. Its characters, all affluent women in
their 30s and 40s, discuss fertility, mates who
don't want children, the best sexual positions
during pregnancy, the effect of a child on
your career, choosing a sperm donor and a
host of other topics.
If any theme unites these disparate sub
jects it is a sense of desperation, a fear engen
dered by seeing your friends get pregnant and
have children as your biological clock keeps
ticking away. Most of Jaglom's characters
seem to view having a baby as an integral part

of female experience, and as they reach the
end of what is normally seen as "childbearing
age," many of them seem painfully resigned
to the idea that they will never experience
motherhood. "Babyfever" might have been
more effective if it had been shorter — many
of the same themes are rehashed over and
over and as the film dragged on I began to feel
a little antsy. I was also surprised by the
sketchiness of Jaglom's male characters — the
film generally considers men only as people
to have babies with, and doesn't seem to con
sider their feelings in any significant way.
Jenna's boyfriend, for example, although
warm, funny and supportive, gets dumped
because he's not "perfect for her," thus keep
ing with the "nice guys finish last" clichd that
seems so dominant in today's movies.
