## Velocity Girl speeds to alternative pop heights 
### 
It's been written that college radio fave Ve
locity Girl put the "pop" in indie music
monolith Sub-Pop. If its sublime 1993 debut
"Copacetic" didn't prove that point clearly
enough, the D.C. quintet's splendid, soon
to-be-released, sophomore effort "jSimpati
co!" makes it clear for everyone to hear.
In fact, "jSimpatico!" might be almost too
poppy — the band strips the cacophonous
din of "Copacetic" down to the bare essen
tials of pop. Rather than heaping on layer
upon layer of densely ethereal guitar work as
it did before, the band shows off a chimy, al
most giddy, instrumental sound this time
around. If anything, "jSimpatico!" will put
the not-so-accurate comparisons between
them and Brit shoegazer outfits like My
Bloody Valentine to a timely death.
While hundreds of other good pop bands
have such credentials, vocalist Sarah Shan
non's singularly spectacular voice makes the
band stand out from the crowd. The opera
trained Shannon's creamy smooth voice
rings effortlessly above the music, effusing a
natural charm. At times, she'll take her voice
out of cruise control and hit a spine-tingling
high, only to bring it down to a murmur on a
second's notice. Curtly put, she's got a voice
that makes a soul swoon.
Although it's satisfying enough to hear
Shannon "ooh" and "ah," the clean produc
tion on ";Simpatico!" highlights all the sub
tleties of her impeccable delivery. Whereas
the fuzzy haze of "Copacetic" buried her lead
vocals in the blurring mass of sound, Shan
non's mellifluous voice moves to the fore on
the polished new record, evoking colorful
images and clear emotion.
What's more, the clarity of "jSimpatico!"
points out just how well the instrumental
work helps the shining vocals stand out: gui
tarists Archie Moore and Brian Nelson and

bassist Kelly Riles know when to break out of
the mix and reach for the right note to accom
pany Shannon's singing. And while Velocity
Girl may have lost some of its explosive dy
namism in the move from noisy pop to noise
pop, the meticulously honed "jSimpatico!" is
to the band's craft. Instead of indulging in its
flavor-of-the-month status, Velocity Girl con
tinues to progress, shaping the old-fashioned
pop formula with intricate substance.
The album's lead-off track and first single,
"Sorry Again," drives this point home. A sim
ple burst of drumming by drummer Jim
Spellman leads into Shannon's apologetic yet
non-committal lyrics. A perfectly paced gui
tar thread keeps the song together while di
recting the listener to Shannon, hitting a high
note just as she lifts her voice. Shannon
moves the song along, slowing it down and
speeding it up with lilting intonation. Both
give way to another crash of instruments, sig
naling the chorus where the deadpan voice of
Moore serves as a nice foil to Shannon's lead.
"Sorry Again" is just one example of a skill
fully shaped Velocity Girl pop tune in a collec
tion of many on "jSimpatico!" For instance,
when Moore and Shannon share the lead on
"The All-Consumer," it's more than a cheesy
duet. Their voices wind their way around one
another, each moving between the foreground
and the background at the right instances. In
"Drug Girls," Shannon's smirking humor
peeks through, seemingly parodying the pub
lic's obsession with Riot Grrls in coyly stinging
verses like "They are deceiving nice / Please
check their alibis / Timing is the key / Just like
in comedy."
The centerpiece of the album is the two
minute charmer "Medio Core." The song
starts off with Spcllman's propulsive drum
ming and Riles' buzzing bass groove, soon
joined by quickly paced guitars and Shan

non's image-rich crooning about TV and
take-out Chinese. Her meandering voice rev
els in slacking off, calling out, "Sometimes
I'm lazy / My nature betrays me / Don't try
to change me / You can't even wake me."
The future for Velocity Girl and its boun

cy pop looks bright—the band has signed on
to make five more albums for Sub-Pop. If
they're anything like "iSimpatico!" the label
should start looking for someone to put the
"sub" back in its name.
