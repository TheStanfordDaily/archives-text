# "Nowhere" San Francisco Seals
## 
### 
If the compilation "No Alternative" served
any musical purpose, it was to bring Ba/ Area
scene icon Barbara Manning and her band
the San Francisco Seals into the national
spotlight. Amidst a galaxy of stars, Manning's
smooth vocals and the Seals' twangy instru
mental work shone brightest. With the re
lease of its debut LP "Nowhere," the band sat
isfies even more fully than that tasty tidbit.
On the surface, "Nowhere" seems to be
nothing more than one of the catchiest al
bums released in recent memory. Almost

very one of the Seals'
originals on the
album is nothing
short of a pop classic,
each a blend of Man
ning's sweetly evoca
tive voice, melan
choly/love song
esque lyrics and
hooky guitar work.
Yet don't let their

c ite, alluring appearance fool you: behind
the sugary melodies lies a ferocious charm
which makes the Seals all the more attractive.
Manning takes the standard pop formula and
puts different twists to it, mixing in a little
folk-laced guitar here and a few grunge riffs
there. The Seals also throw in an occasional
string accompaniment and even a horn
arrangement to make it interesting while
keeping it catchy.
Take the fierce ditty "Day 12". A sparse
guitar intro leads into Manning chanting "1
hate today," which triggers a spiraling mass of
relentless bass rhythm and screeching guitar
work. Manning showcases the grumpy
humor which pervades much of the album.
On the album closer "Missing," the clang
ing and reverberating instrumentals perfect
ly back Manning's paranoid vocals. However,
the mess clears up a bit when a short horn
piece heralds the chorus where Manning af
fcctingly sets things straight, singing "Tie a
string to my heart / Before it bursts
apart / Floating in the atmosphere."
With such a batch of quirky pop songs,
the San Francisco Seals undoubtedly prove
on "Nowhere" that they are now here.
