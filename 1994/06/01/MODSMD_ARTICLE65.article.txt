# "Tokyo Live" Free Spirits featuring John McLaughlin
## 
### 
Janus-faced guitarist John McLaughlin
has always evaded pigeonholing.
At one point in the mid-'7os, this emi
nence gris of guitarists became a loyal follow
er of the guru Sri Chinmoy, changed his
name to Mahavishnu, shaved his head and
abstained from alcohol and sex. His song ti
tles rang with mystic tones and he made for
ays into the worlds of classical Indian music,
hard rock and flamenco with The Mahavish
nu Orchestra, which created a heady electric
brew.
But now the musician is back to plain old
John and has embraced his origins in Amer
ican jazz, as always with a singular sting. On
his latest release with the Free Spirits, "Tokyo
Live," possibly the most traditional release of
his entire career, McLaughlin feints with the
well-oiled virtuosity of organist Joey De-
Francesco and jazz-funk drummer Dennis
Chambers.

No words to this mix. Just endless lines,
punched out with frenetic abandon. A bar
rage here, a barrage there. Machine-gunning
post-bop tracks like "Hijacked" are butted
up against the sultry bedside coos of "When
Love is Far Away" and the pugnacious funk
of "JuJu at the Crossroads." Some of it hear
kens back to McLaughlin's days working
with Miles Davis on proto-fusion jazz exper
iments like "Bitches' Brew," which led to the
wide-pantlegged music of the '70s.
His playing has been, and is, the model for
an entire generation of would-be guitar
wunderkinds: brutally angular, flowing,
shimmering, stuttering at times. With ease
he plays in difficult time signatures that the
less rhythmically inclined would gnash their
teeth at All of it comes across, however, not
as unapproachable experimentalism, but
graceful avanf-musicality.
After a 10-year hiatus in the bowels of
synth-jazz invisibility, it's nice to welcome
McLaughlin back into the realm of intense,
blowing music. "Tokyo Live" hits like — to
quote another of his song titles smacking of
'60s vibe-ology —MA Sapphire Bullet of Pure
Love."
