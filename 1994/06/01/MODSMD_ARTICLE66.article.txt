# I'm a crêpe, I'm a winner Ti Couz's French fare a tasty delight
## 
### Allison Amend 
So how about it? You're pre
med, you're afraid of flying, you
just don't have time to go abroad.
Yet you crave the ambiance of a
French Crfiperie, the excitement of
ordering in a foreign language, the
taste of a fine meal the way only the
French can prepare it.
Ti Couz, a small restaurant on
San Francisco's 16th Street, is the
perfect solution. The name, Breton
for "old house," delivers on its
promise, convincingly creating the
image of a mansion on France's
coast. Although the view of sketchy
16th Street is not stunning, the
windows are decorated with sand,
driftwood and anchors. The small
tables are sanded to look weath
ered. In short, it's adorable.
The menu has something for
everyone, though nothing is low

fat, so hit the Stairmaster before
driving in. It works almost as a
pizza menu, the standard being the
buckwheat flower pancake crfipe
shell. From there, you may choose
as many ingredients as you like.
Cheese is practically mandatory,
while mushrooms, spinach,
onions, ham and shrimp are a few
of the other extras.
The filler of the cr£pe becomes
the sauce, liberally and gracefully
resting on top of the plate-sized
meal. My grilled onions were a per
fect consistency, and the cr£pe was
as much fun to look at as to eat.
Whatever you do, save room for
dessert: it is not to be missed. The
crapes are sweeter now, and mine
was piled high with ice cream,
apple glaze and caramel — and oh
yeah, crime fraiche. Wow. Others in

my group mixed chocolate mousse,
butterscotch, whipped cream,
strawberries, etc.
As long as you're there, do it up
the right way, with a nice vin rouge
(red wine), or a Kir, a red currant
and-wine mixture that make you
wonder why you ever drink water or
cider. Hey, you're in France! The cof
fees, too, have typical European
thickness, and a corresponding
taste.
So what are the drawbacks?
Well, as you may have guessed, it's
not inexpensive. Dinner crapes are
$4-$7, and dessert crapes run about
the same. If it's not a special occa
sion, sharing dessert or buying
bread helps keep the cost down.
Also, the kitchen is open —
therefore the grill is small. Crapes
come out in one or twos, which is

cute until you're the
only one at your table
with nothing to eat
and the first people
have finished by the
time yours arrives.
It's also a small
restaurant, and much
of the seating is at the
counters around the
bar, which makes for
a laid-back atmos
phere. Disappoint
ingly American, the
restaurant also at
tracts slumming yup
pies and Haight walk-

overs. Our waitress had a great tat
too above her eyebrow, but was
from Tennessee.
All in all, the restaurant was ex
cellent, the food hot and the service

friendly. Its location, though a trek
from campus, makes it a great place
to stop for a snack after a day in the
city before driving back to campus,
or a pre-formal treat. ■
