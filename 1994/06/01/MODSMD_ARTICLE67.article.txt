Bad Girls
The title says it all: "Bad Girls" really
is bad. Despite vaunting itself as the
first female-centered frontier shoot
"em up, director Jonathan Kaplan
does nothing more than crib scenes
from classic Westerns that fill the
movie with aimless action instead of
plot or relevant issues. So don't let
it's claim to the top spot at the box
office fool you — after all, "Ace Ven
tura" was there for multiple weeks. R
Being Human
"Being Human" is about, well, being
human. Despite such a metaphysi
cal subject, this convoluted flick
flops in its attempt to be deep. Al
though you might ask yourself
"What's the point?" throughout the
movie, by the end, you're saying,
"That's a rather simplistic mes
sage." Not even Robin Williams can
save this one. PG-13
Belle Epoque
In the tradition of criticaliy-ac
claimed, innocuous, little-known
European movies comes Spanish
director Fernando Trueba's "Belle
Epoque." But don't let the hype of a
Best Foreign Film Oscar fool you:
the story of four farmer's daughters
and a Spanish army deserter con
tains sizzling sex scenes but little
historical or political content. In
essence, 1993's winner proves to

be nothing more than a dressed-up
Penthouse Forum letter. R
Cronos
Writer/director Guillermo del Toro's
stylish vampire flick "Cronos"
proves to be well-paced and con
stantly intriguing. Mysterious, exotic
settings add a nice backdrop for the
engaging Mexican version of the
standard horror tale. Unlike its ilk in
this genre, "Cronos" gives you
something to think about after it's
over. Unrated
The Crow
Although "The Crow" is the sort of
movie everyone's hoping will be
good, the movie just isn't good. The
story of a resurrected rocker who ex
acts his own kind of justice gets bor
ing and predictable. Too bad a
strong performance by the de
ceased Brandon Lee had to be
wasted on an unoriginal flick like this
one. R
Even Cowgirls Get the Blues
Expectations were high for "Even
Cowgirls Get the Blues": after all,
what could go wrong with the cre
ative dynamic duo of author Tom
Robbins and director Gus Van Sant
at the helm? Yet even with these
high hopes, the movie turns out to
be a tad disappointing — incredible
scenes don't mesh and characters

and themes aren't developed. Still,
it's probably worth your while to
catch this film. R
Four Weddings and a Funeral
"Four Weddings and a Funeral" ac
tually lives up to the hype as a
crowd-pleasing comedy. While it
may not explore the deep meaning
of life, the flick serves up breezy fun
with inspired comedy. The delightful
cast, featuring Andie MacDowell
and the omnipresent Hugh Grant,
does a good job of moving the
movie along. R
Germinal
Director Claude Berri does an im
peccable job of translating 19th
century French writer Emile Zola's
classic i iovel "Germinal" to film.
While the performances of Gerard
Depardieu and Miou-Miou shine, it's
the infernal mine that steals the
show. Sure, the movie might be
long on melodrama, but it still gives
a good glimpse of French history. R
Maverick
Just what the world needed: another
shoot-'em-up western. Well, at least
"Maverick" has some of good actors
and some exciting action se
quences. Still, something doesn't
quite click: it's not quite fitting to see
Mel Gibson, James Garner and
Academy Award-winning Jodie Fos

ter prance about in a what amounts
to a two-hour situation comedy. PG
No Escape
Ray Liotta goes from mob hench
man-in-hiding in "Goodfellas" to an
"aversive to authority" criminal ex
iled on an island in the futuristic "No
Escape." OK, the premise might be
a tad hokey, but the movie does
supply some good, fast-paced ac
tion scenes. Still, if you're looking for
something brainy, stay away from
this flick. R
Thirty Two Short Films about
Glenn Gould
Director Francois Girard breaks the
forms and rules of filmmaking with
his hypnotizing collage of short films
on the life of music prodigy Glenn
Gould in this appropriately titled
flick. Actor Colm Feore does an im
peccable job of portraying Gould,
exuding an air of intelligence and
off-kilter balance. Unrated
When a Man Loves a Woman
Yes, "When a Man Loves a Woman"
might bring a tear to the eye of the
most jaded of us. Still, something
about this Meg Ryan/Andy Garcia
vehicle about alcoholism and fami
lies and recovery and relationships
doesn't ring true; it seems like pub
lic service announcement for rehab
and pop psychology. R
