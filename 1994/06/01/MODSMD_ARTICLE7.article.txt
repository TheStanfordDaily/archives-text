# Budget cutting: a never-ending story?
## 
### Andy Dworkin Senior staff writer 
It just doesn't seem fair.
After trimming about $65 mil
lion from its budget over the past
five years, Stanford should be sit
ting pretty. Instead, the Universi
ty is now trying to cut another $ 18
million and sweating through its
third round of cuts this decade.
The 1994-95 budget managed to
include $6 million of these cuts.
Many questions surround the
current round of cuts: Why are
these cuts necessary? Why make
them now? Why didn't the last two
rounds take care of our problems?
Two separate but related fac
tors help answer these questions
and drive the current budget-cut
ting process: one-time financial
crises and a long-term structural
problem with Stanford's budget.
Administrators are counting on

this round of cuts to deal with the
budget problems and make the
University stronger in the future.
But, with the uncertainties sur
rounding the University budget,
this round may just be one more
volley in a long match.
From boom to bust
Stanford, like much of Ameri
ca, fared well in the economic
boom years of the mid-1980s.
Like much of America, Stan
ford has been hurt economically
by the turn-of-the-decade bust
that followed.
But Stanford has also had
unique problems that hurt it more
than corporations or other univer
sities. The two biggest financial
blows to the University, which
struck around the same time as
the national economic slowdown,
were 1989's Loma Prieta earth
quake and the indirect-cost con
troversy that followed shortly
after.
The temblor struck at 5:04
p.m. on Oct. 17, 1989. It regis
tered a whopping 7.1 on the
Richter scale and caused an esti
mated $170 million in damage to
the campus. Much of that damage
is still not repaired, and the Uni
versity plans to spend millions
over the next five years to com
plete repairs.
A year later, another shock hit
campus. The U.S. Navy, which
oversees portions of the funding
Stanford gets from the federal
government, announced that it
was investigating the amount of
indirect-cost reimbursement the
University receives — basically
how much money the govern
ment pays for overhead costs con
nected to research projects, such
as staff benefits,
Naval officials accused Stan
ford of billing improper items —
such as depreciation on the Uni
versity's 72-foot yacht, Victoria
— to the government along with
indirect costs. In April, 1991, the
government slashed the amount
of money Stanford was reim
bursed.
Provost Condoleezza Rice esti
mated earlier this year that the
indirect cost controversy might
have cost Stanford a couple hun
dred million dollars, including
expenses and lost income. Many
people both at Stanford and in the
government are still trying to
work out that crisis and set up a
new system to figure how much
money Stanford should get.
The University's Chief Finan
cial Officer, Peter Van Etten, says
the quake and indirect-cost prob
lems are two of the "four seismic
shocks" that damaged Stanford's
financial position. The other pair
are changes in the health-care
market that have hurt the Medi
cal Center's budget and national
pressures to economize.
The University reacted to
these shocks by cutting its bud
get. The $22 million "reposition
ing" cuts announced in 1990

responded, in part to the earth
quake. The $43 million cuts
announced in 1992 responded to
the indirect-cost problems.
While the last of those cuts are
finishing this year, the financial
problems caused by the "four
seismic shocks" — especially the
indirect-cost controversy — were
so serious that, Van Etten said,
"we always knew that we were
facing a deficit in 1995."
The $43 million effort "did not
get the job done and was not
designed to get the job completely
done," Van Etten said. "The $43
million was what we felt the insti
tution could ingest over three
years."
So, even while planning and
executing the last cuts, officials
knew more cuts would likely be
necessary.
Other factors combined to
make this year's budget woes
more serious than had been pro
jected, said University Budget
Director Tim Warner. Recent
changes in regulations governing
some of the money Stanford gets
from the government and a study
of future campus capital expenses
revealed less income and more
spending than estimated — to the
tune of about $10 million. Warner
said.
These budget problems needed
to be addressed soon, he said, or
they would have persisted and
worsened.
Many officials stress one more
very important reason to cut the
budget: to place Stanford in a
position where the University can
be financially sound and not
worry about constant deficits.
The 2 percent problem
One-time fiscal problems, like
the earthquake or the indirect
cost controversy, are only one
side of Stanford's budget woes.
These events did force many of
the cuts in recent years. However,
just before the quake struck, the
University was planning to
address a structural flaw that
administrators refer to as "the 2
percent problem" — a problem
that the new round of cuts also
hopes to address.
James Rosse, University
provost from 1984 to 1992, said
the 2 percent problem is "a name
for a persistent tendency for the

budget to go out of control."
Basically, the concern is that
over a period of years, Stanford's
expenses tended to grow with
salaries, at a rate about 2 percent
above inflation. Stanford's
income, however, has tended to
grow 2 percent less than its
expenses, Van Etten said.
Several factors contributed to
this difference, said University
President Emeritus Donald
Kennedy. Those factors include
academic programs that tend to
"improve" and get more expen
sive year after year, increasing
student demand for services such
as those offered by the Career
Placement and Planning Center,
and growth in staff which places
stress other areas, such as the
benefits budget.
In addition, Rosse said, teach
ing technology is expensive. And,
because universities get reim
bursed from the government for
their costs, figuring out ways to
decrease costs can also lower rev
enues.
During the late 1980s, this 2
percent problem could be covered
by one-time revenue sources and
the strong business environment,
Van Etten said. Now, however,
the money to cover that shortfall
has dried up.
Rosse said that he recognized
the structural problem when he
first took office in 1984. So why
didn't Stanford address it until
this year?
The University did. The $22
million "repositioning" effort
aimed not only at dealing with
earthquake issues, but also at the
2 percent problem. Administra
tors, Rosse said, hoped those cuts
would create budget surpluses for
a few years and rearrange the way
Stanford did business so that
income would dictate costs.
But then the indirect-cost woes
began and, Rice said, "everything
was taken off the table just to sur
vive." The 2 percent problem was
overshadowed.
Now Stanford is starting to put
its disagreements with the gov
ernment behind and is again try
ing to address this structural
problem.
Rice and many other adminis
trators have said that, in the
future, budget decisions will have
to be "revenue driven" — the

amount of income will dictate
how much Stanford spends.
Earlier in the year, in fact, Rice
and University President Ger
hard Casper made a deal with the
Board of Trustees that will hold
spending down. The administra
tors promised to hold cost
increases at or below 1 percent
above inflation in return for a .5
percent increase in the amount of
money paid out from the Univer
sity's endowment.
Rice has said she is committed
to holding costs low and battling
the 2 percent problem. "If we
can't address it," Rice said, "it's
our long-term academic and
financial standing at stake."
Future shocks?
So, administrators say, this
round of budget cuts has two sep
arate but related aims. One is to
take care of deficits left from the
four seismic shocks. The other, to
deal with the 2 percent problem.
Both aim to make Stanford more
efficient and flexible, so that
future expansion and innovation
can be funded.
But there is no guarantee that
this round of cuts will be the last
in the long run, or even in the
short run. Several problems could
pop up in the future.
The sources of Stanford's
income, for example, may not
prosper, Van Etten said. The
future flow of money from the
government for research is
"cloudy;" indirect cost reimburse
ments may be cut some for all
universities; the local economy
has been weak; tuition increases
can not continue to be as high as
in years past; and investment
income can always change, Van
Etten said.
Kennedy pointed out that the
fact that Stanford has decided on
budget cuts now does not guaran
tee that the cuts will go as
planned.
Perhaps most importantly,
several administrators said that if
they have learned anything from
the budget ups and downs of
recent years it is that disaster —
or windfalls — can come at any
time.
"What we know most is that
we can't be certain," Van Etten
said. "We are much less certain of
the future than we used to be."
It just doesn't seem fair.
After trimming about $65 mil

— to the government along with
indirect costs. In April, 1991, the
government slashed the amount
of money Stanford was reim
bursed.
Provost Condoleezza Rice esti
mated earlier this year that the
indirect cost controversy might
have cost Stanford a couple hun
dred million dollars, including
expenses and lost income. Many
people both at Stanford and in the
government are still trying to
work out that crisis and set up a
new system to figure how much
money Stanford should get.
The University's Chief Finan
cial Officer, Peter Van Etten, says
the quake and indirect-cost prob
lems are two of the "four seismic
shocks" that damaged Stanford's
financial position. The other pair
are changes in the health-care
market that have hurt the Medi
cal Center's budget and national
pressures to economize.
The University reacted to
these shocks by cutting its bud
get. The $22 million "reposition
ing" cuts announced in 1990

responded, in part to the earth
quake. The $43 million cuts
announced in 1992 responded to
the indirect-cost problems.
While the last of those cuts are
finishing this year, the financial
problems caused by the "four
seismic shocks" — especially the
indirect-cost controversy — were
so serious that, Van Etten said,
"we always knew that we were
facing a deficit in 1995."
The $43 million effort "did not
get the job done and was not
designed to get the job completely
done," Van Etten said. "The $43
million was what we felt the insti
tution could ingest over three
years."
So, even while planning and
executing the last cuts, officials
knew more cuts would likely be
necessary.
Other factors combined to
make this year's budget woes
more serious than had been pro
jected, said University Budget
Director Tim Warner. Recent
changes in regulations governing
some of the money Stanford gets
from the government and a study
of future campus capital expenses
revealed less income and more
spending than estimated — to the
tune of about $10 million. Warner
said.
These budget problems needed
to be addressed soon, he said, or
they would have persisted and
worsened.
Many officials stress one more
very important reason to cut the
budget: to place Stanford in a
position where the University can
be financially sound and not
worry about constant deficits.
The 2 percent problem
One-time fiscal problems, like
the earthquake or the indirect
cost controversy, are only one
side of Stanford's budget woes.
These events did force many of
the cuts in recent years. However,
just before the quake struck, the
University was planning to
address a structural flaw that
administrators refer to as "the 2
percent problem" — a problem
that the new round of cuts also
hopes to address.
James Rosse, University
provost from 1984 to 1992, said
the 2 percent problem is "a name
for a persistent tendency for the

budget to go out of control."
Basically, the concern is that
over a period of years, Stanford's
expenses tended to grow with
salaries, at a rate about 2 percent
above inflation. Stanford's
income, however, has tended to
grow 2 percent less than its
expenses, Van Etten said.
Several factors contributed to
this difference, said University
President Emeritus Donald
Kennedy. Those factors include
academic programs that tend to
"improve" and get more expen
sive year after year, increasing
student demand for services such
as those offered by the Career
Placement and Planning Center,
and growth in staff which places
stress other areas, such as the
benefits budget.
In addition, Rosse said, teach
ing technology is expensive. And,
because universities get reim
bursed from the government for
their costs, figuring out ways to
decrease costs can also lower rev
enues.
During the late 1980s, this 2
percent problem could be covered
by one-time revenue sources and
the strong business environment,
Van Etten said. Now, however,
the money to cover that shortfall
has dried up.
Rosse said that he recognized
the structural problem when he
first took office in 1984. So why
didn't Stanford address it until
this year?
The University did. The $22
million "repositioning" effort
aimed not only at dealing with
earthquake issues, but also at the
2 percent problem. Administra
tors, Rosse said, hoped those cuts
would create budget surpluses for
a few years and rearrange the way
Stanford did business so that
income would dictate costs.
But then the indirect-cost woes
began and, Rice said, "everything
was taken off the table just to sur
vive." The 2 percent problem was
overshadowed.
Now Stanford is starting to put
its disagreements with the gov
ernment behind and is again try
ing to address this structural
problem.
Rice and many other adminis
trators have said that, in the
future, budget decisions will have
to be "revenue driven" — the

amount of income will dictate
how much Stanford spends.
Earlier in the year, in fact, Rice
and University President Ger
hard Casper made a deal with the
Board of Trustees that will hold
spending down. The administra
tors promised to hold cost
increases at or below 1 percent
above inflation in return for a .5
percent increase in the amount of
money paid out from the Univer
sity's endowment.
Rice has said she is committed
to holding costs low and battling
the 2 percent problem. "If we
can't address it," Rice said, "it's
our long-term academic and
financial standing at stake."
Future shocks?
So, administrators say, this
round of budget cuts has two sep
arate but related aims. One is to
take care of deficits left from the
four seismic shocks. The other, to
deal with the 2 percent problem.
Both aim to make Stanford more
efficient and flexible, so that
future expansion and innovation
can be funded.
But there is no guarantee that
this round of cuts will be the last
in the long run, or even in the
short run. Several problems could
pop up in the future.
The sources of Stanford's
income, for example, may not
prosper, Van Etten said. The
future flow of money from the
government for research is
"cloudy;" indirect cost reimburse
ments may be cut some for all
universities; the local economy
has been weak; tuition increases
can not continue to be as high as
in years past; and investment
income can always change, Van
Etten said.
Kennedy pointed out that the
fact that Stanford has decided on
budget cuts now does not guaran
tee that the cuts will go as
planned.
Perhaps most importantly,
several administrators said that if
they have learned anything from
the budget ups and downs of
recent years it is that disaster —
or windfalls — can come at any
time.
"What we know most is that
we can't be certain," Van Etten
said. "We are much less certain of
the future than we used to be."
It just doesn't seem fair.
After trimming about $65 mil
lion from its budget over the past
five years, Stanford should be sit
ting pretty. Instead, the Universi
ty is now trying to cut another $ 18
million and sweating through its
third round of cuts this decade.
The 1994-95 budget managed to
include $6 million of these cuts.
Many questions surround the
current round of cuts: Why are
these cuts necessary? Why make
them now? Why didn't the last two
rounds take care of our problems?
Two separate but related fac
tors help answer these questions
and drive the current budget-cut
ting process: one-time financial
crises and a long-term structural
problem with Stanford's budget.
Administrators are counting on

this round of cuts to deal with the
budget problems and make the
University stronger in the future.
But, with the uncertainties sur
rounding the University budget,
this round may just be one more
volley in a long match.
From boom to bust
Stanford, like much of Ameri
ca, fared well in the economic
boom years of the mid-1980s.
Like much of America, Stan
ford has been hurt economically
by the turn-of-the-decade bust
that followed.
But Stanford has also had
unique problems that hurt it more
than corporations or other univer
sities. The two biggest financial
blows to the University, which
struck around the same time as
the national economic slowdown,
were 1989's Loma Prieta earth
quake and the indirect-cost con
troversy that followed shortly
after.
The temblor struck at 5:04
p.m. on Oct. 17, 1989. It regis
tered a whopping 7.1 on the
Richter scale and caused an esti
mated $170 million in damage to
the campus. Much of that damage
is still not repaired, and the Uni
versity plans to spend millions
over the next five years to com
plete repairs.
A year later, another shock hit
campus. The U.S. Navy, which
oversees portions of the funding
Stanford gets from the federal
government, announced that it
was investigating the amount of
indirect-cost reimbursement the
University receives — basically
how much money the govern
ment pays for overhead costs con
nected to research projects, such
as staff benefits,
Naval officials accused Stan
ford of billing improper items —
such as depreciation on the Uni
versity's 72-foot yacht, Victoria
— to the government along with
indirect costs. In April, 1991, the
government slashed the amount
of money Stanford was reim
bursed.

cost controversy, are only one
side of Stanford's budget woes.
These events did force many of
the cuts in recent years. However,
just before the quake struck, the
University was planning to
address a structural flaw that
administrators refer to as "the 2
percent problem" — a problem
that the new round of cuts also
hopes to address.
James Rosse, University
provost from 1984 to 1992, said
the 2 percent problem is "a name
for a persistent tendency for the

budget to go out of control."
Basically, the concern is that
over a period of years, Stanford's
expenses tended to grow with
salaries, at a rate about 2 percent
above inflation. Stanford's
income, however, has tended to
grow 2 percent less than its
expenses, Van Etten said.
Several factors contributed to
this difference, said University
President Emeritus Donald
Kennedy. Those factors include
academic programs that tend to
"improve" and get more expen
sive year after year, increasing
student demand for services such
as those offered by the Career
Placement and Planning Center,
and growth in staff which places
stress other areas, such as the
benefits budget.
In addition, Rosse said, teach
ing technology is expensive. And,
because universities get reim
bursed from the government for
their costs, figuring out ways to
decrease costs can also lower rev
enues.
During the late 1980s, this 2
percent problem could be covered
by one-time revenue sources and
the strong business environment,
Van Etten said. Now, however,
the money to cover that shortfall
has dried up.
Rosse said that he recognized
the structural problem when he
first took office in 1984. So why
didn't Stanford address it until
this year?
The University did. The $22
million "repositioning" effort
aimed not only at dealing with
earthquake issues, but also at the
2 percent problem. Administra
tors, Rosse said, hoped those cuts
would create budget surpluses for
a few years and rearrange the way
Stanford did business so that
income would dictate costs.
But then the indirect-cost woes
began and, Rice said, "everything
was taken off the table just to sur
vive." The 2 percent problem was
overshadowed.
Now Stanford is starting to put
its disagreements with the gov
ernment behind and is again try
ing to address this structural
problem.
Rice and many other adminis
trators have said that, in the
future, budget decisions will have
to be "revenue driven" — the

amount of income will dictate
how much Stanford spends.
Earlier in the year, in fact, Rice
and University President Ger
hard Casper made a deal with the
Board of Trustees that will hold
spending down. The administra
tors promised to hold cost
increases at or below 1 percent
above inflation in return for a .5
percent increase in the amount of
money paid out from the Univer
sity's endowment.
Rice has said she is committed
to holding costs low and battling
the 2 percent problem. "If we
can't address it," Rice said, "it's
our long-term academic and
financial standing at stake."
Future shocks?
So, administrators say, this
round of budget cuts has two sep
arate but related aims. One is to
take care of deficits left from the
four seismic shocks. The other, to
deal with the 2 percent problem.
Both aim to make Stanford more
efficient and flexible, so that
future expansion and innovation
can be funded.
But there is no guarantee that
this round of cuts will be the last
in the long run, or even in the
short run. Several problems could
pop up in the future.
The sources of Stanford's
income, for example, may not
prosper, Van Etten said. The
future flow of money from the
government for research is
"cloudy;" indirect cost reimburse
ments may be cut some for all
universities; the local economy
has been weak; tuition increases
can not continue to be as high as
in years past; and investment
income can always change, Van
Etten said.
Kennedy pointed out that the
fact that Stanford has decided on
budget cuts now does not guaran
tee that the cuts will go as
planned.
Perhaps most importantly,
several administrators said that if
they have learned anything from
the budget ups and downs of
recent years it is that disaster —
or windfalls — can come at any
time.
"What we know most is that
we can't be certain," Van Etten
said. "We are much less certain of
the future than we used to be."
