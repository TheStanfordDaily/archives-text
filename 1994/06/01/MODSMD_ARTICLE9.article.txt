Korean settlement?
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Clinton
administration is concerned about the
speed with which North Korea has been
removing fuel rods from a nuclear reactor,
but still hopes for a diplomatic settlement,
a Pentagon spokeswoman said yesterday.
"We are not pleased with the actions
of North Korea in the last 48 hours.
We're attempting to bring international
pressure to bear," Pentagon spokeswom
an Kathleen deLaski told reporters at a
briefing.
"The pace of removal is a concern, but
we are hopeful we can find a diplomatic
settlement," she said.
The focus of the dispute is North
Korea's refueling of its five megawatt
reactor at Yongbyon, which U.S. officials
say could produce enough plutonium to

make several atomic bombs.
Inspectors want to sample the spent
fuel rods that are being removed from
the reactor, to see whether plutonium
has been diverted. North Korea has
refused to allow them to do so.
Economic growth slows
WASHINGTON (AP) — Americans
made slightly more money in April but
spent less, while new home sales fell for
the first time in three months — signs
that economic growth may be slowing.
The Commerce Department said yes
terday that income was up a modest 0.4
percent after rising 0.6 percent in March,
while spending declined 0.1 percent fol
lowing a healthy 0.7 percent gain. The
April drop in spending was only the sec
ond in the last 13 months.
