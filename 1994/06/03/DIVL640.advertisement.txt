We believe
in gi\ing
something
back.
ROYAL NEIGHBORS OF AMERICA was
founded as a fraternal benefit society — an
organization that takes care of its members
with life insurance coverage and family
benefits, as well as offers services to com
munities in need. Yes, we're an insurance
organization. But we're so much more.
We're not-for-profit. We offer annuities and
IRA's and noncontractual programs like a
newborn benefit and a college scholarship
competition for RNA graduating high school
seniors who are members.
ROYAL NEIGHBORS OF AMERICA IS
GIVING SOMETHING BACK! Let JOHN
ROWDEN DAVIS tell you how many ways
you can benefit.
