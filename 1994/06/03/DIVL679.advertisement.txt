I am because we are; and since we are, therefore I am.

We arc not solely individuals but part of a community. Our concentric
circles begin with our family, then move outward to include our
neighborhood, the African-American community, the American
community, and the global community
When we make ourselves stronger, we make our African-American
community stronger. When our African-American community is stronger,
it makes every individual in it stronger by providing more power, more
opportunities, more role models, and more hope.
On this day, I will take five minutes to remember that one of the results oj
working so hard to attain my goals is that in attaining my goals I help
empower and advance not only myself, but my family and the entire
African-American community.
Excerpt from Black Pearls: Dal(v Meditations. Affirmations, and Inspirations for
African-Americans by Eric V Copage, Quill, 1993.
