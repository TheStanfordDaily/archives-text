"Congratulations! We're so proud of you!"
Mom, Dad, Hope, Heather, Nathan & Andrew
Who we are begins as mystery, so we seek clues.
Each triumph, each false hope discovered, seem large.
IN TIME OUR BECOMING BRINGS REFLECTION NOT ANTICIPATION,
Pride and Compassion the twin virtues of success;
At last we are ourselves, enabled to do things
Both Great and Small, as self, so born to be.
