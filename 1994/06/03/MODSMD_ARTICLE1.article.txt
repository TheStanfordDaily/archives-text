# Faculty Senate passes new grading policy
## 38-3 vote in favor of failing grade and stricter add/drop deadlines; policy will take effect in 1995-96 
### Andy Dworkin Senior staff writer 
Stanford students will face
stricter add/drop deadlines,
stringent rules on retaking
courses, and failing grades,
thanks to a new grading policy
passed by the Facuity Senate yes
terday.
The new plan passed by a 38-3
vote, despite grumbling from
student onlookers and attempts
to make sweeping, last-minute
amendments.
The policy — most of which
will take effect in the 1995-96
academic year — will record an
"NP" for "not passed" on stu
dents' academic transcripts
when they fail classes.
Students will have to add
courses by the third week of the
quarter, and must drop classes
by the fourth week of the quarter
if they do not want the dropped
course to appear on their tran
script.
Classes dropped between the
fifth and eighth weeks of the
quarter will show up on tran
scripts with a "W" notation for
"withdrew." Courses can only be
retaken one time for units, and
the fact that the class was retak
en will be noted.
Students in all non-profes
sional schools, as well as Ph.D.
candidates in the School of Medi
cine, will be affected by the poli
cy.
The policy will "send a clear
message to students to take the
life of the mind seriously," ac
cording to Geology Prof. Gail Ma
hood, who chaired the committee
that created the proposal. "What
we're trying to do is come up with
a grading policy that establishes
the right incentives."
"I see (this policy) as a series
of steps upping the ante, encour
aging the students to take com
mitments seriously," said
Physics Prof. Steve Chu.
Commitment and responsibil
ity were the themes of the
discussion, as many senators
said they hoped the policy would
encourage students to choose
courses wisely and early in the

quarter, and devote enough time
to their studies so they can learn
subjects in depth.
Now, some senators said, the
grading system encourages stu
dents to take many units and
drop classes if the load gets too
heavy. That can spread some stu
dents thin, they said.
Many proponents of the policy
also liked the fact that it moves
toward a "historical" transcript
that records students' failures as
well as their successes.
"I think it really is going to
benefit our undergrads to have
this," said Medicine Prof. Ed
ward Harris. "I really think a his
torical transcript .. . can be a
kind of adrenaline, really, that
catalyzes an undergraduate."
Finally, some senators ex
pressed hope that the policy
would have a moderating effect
on grade inflation. The majority
of grades given at Stanford are
A's and B's.
But not every senator favored
the proposal. Three faculty mem
