# Faculty Senate passes new grading policy
## 38-3 vote in favor of failing grade and stricter add/drop deadlines; policy will take effect in 1995-96 
### Andy Dworkin Senior staff writer 
Stanford students will face
stricter add/drop deadlines,
stringent rules on retaking
courses, and failing grades,
thanks to a new grading policy
passed by the Facuity Senate yes
terday.
The new plan passed by a 38-3
vote, despite grumbling from
student onlookers and attempts
to make sweeping, last-minute
amendments.
The policy — most of which
will take effect in the 1995-96
academic year — will record an
"NP" for "not passed" on stu
dents' academic transcripts
when they fail classes.
Students will have to add
courses by the third week of the
quarter, and must drop classes
by the fourth week of the quarter
if they do not want the dropped
course to appear on their tran
script.
Classes dropped between the
fifth and eighth weeks of the
quarter will show up on tran
scripts with a "W" notation for
"withdrew." Courses can only be
retaken one time for units, and
the fact that the class was retak
en will be noted.
Students in all non-profes
sional schools, as well as Ph.D.
candidates in the School of Medi
cine, will be affected by the poli
cy.
The policy will "send a clear
message to students to take the
life of the mind seriously," ac
cording to Geology Prof. Gail Ma
hood, who chaired the committee
that created the proposal. "What
we're trying to do is come up with
a grading policy that establishes
the right incentives."
"I see (this policy) as a series
of steps upping the ante, encour
aging the students to take com
mitments seriously," said
Physics Prof. Steve Chu.
Commitment and responsibil
ity were the themes of the
discussion, as many senators
said they hoped the policy would
encourage students to choose
courses wisely and early in the

quarter, and devote enough time
to their studies so they can learn
subjects in depth.
Now, some senators said, the
grading system encourages stu
dents to take many units and
drop classes if the load gets too
heavy. That can spread some stu
dents thin, they said.
Many proponents of the policy
also liked the fact that it moves
toward a "historical" transcript
that records students' failures as
well as their successes.
"I think it really is going to
benefit our undergrads to have
this," said Medicine Prof. Ed
ward Harris. "I really think a his
torical transcript .. . can be a
kind of adrenaline, really, that
catalyzes an undergraduate."
Finally, some senators ex
pressed hope that the policy
would have a moderating effect
on grade inflation. The majority
of grades given at Stanford are
A's and B's.
But not every senator favored
the proposal. Three faculty mem

against the grading proposal.

1 see no reason why
we should be in this
pun itive mode, which
is essentially what
most of this body is
in. We are branding
our students.'
— Ron Rebholz

"The underlying philosophy of
that proposal is the record of
achievement is not adequate and
we must have a historical record.
I must express my profound dis
agreement with that philoso
phy," Rebholz said. "I see no rea
son why we should be in this
punitive mode, which is essen
tially what the (committee that
created the plan) is in and appar
ently what most of this body is in.
"We are branding our stu
dents," Rebholz said.
Some senators protested that
it is not the intention of the poli
cy to punish students.
But, according to Council of
Presidents member Anietie
Ekanem, a junior, "punishment
is not the object, but believe it or
not it is a strong side effect."
Several senators said they did
not think the plan would make a
significant difference in the acad
emic lives of most students.
"Students who are not . . .
'scamming the system' will not
be affected much by this," Ma
hood said.
However, ASSU Senate Chair
Nawwar Kasrawi said, "I think a
large number of people who don't
actually use the provisions will be
hurt because they'll be afraid to

take risks."
Rebholz and Koseff made last
minute attempts to alter the pol
icy. Koseff proposed a new grade
system that would have allowed
students to drop a course without
note until week eight and would
not have recorded failing grades.
However, Koseffs plan was
tabled just after it was suggested
so that the senate could discuss
and vote on the other proposal
first.
Rebholz then tried to inject
these ideas via one-at-a-time
amendments instead of as a
whole, and the ideas were dis
cussed for a time. However, all of
the individual amendments
failed.
And, as Senate Chair Patricia
Jones said, in the end it was "very
clear that the senate has voted
quite convincingly in favor of the
motion."
Now that the policy has been
passed, however, several people
present pointed out that students
and faculty still have much work
to do to ensure the policy is well
executed.
Several times, senators
stressed the fact that faculty
have responsibilities they must
meet under the new plan, such as
a duty to provide good syllabi
that tell students what classes
will cover and how pupils will be
evaluated.
"It certainly has sensitized the
campus to the issue," Koseff said
of the plan. "I think the students
have the opportunity to hold fac
ulty accountable" and get "a
good, clear indication about
what's expected."
Junior David Cohen, who pro
posed an alternative policy weeks
ago and has fiercely fought the
new plan, said he "knew [he]
would lose" yet still felt disap
pointed.
"We've lost the freedom for
academic exploration which I
think is the central mission of the
University," he said. "Hopefully
now we can focus on changing the
system to make these changes
more palatable."
