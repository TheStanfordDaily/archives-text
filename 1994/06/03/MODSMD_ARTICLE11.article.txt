# Class Day honors seniors' successes

### Michael Slemmer Editorial staff 
Along with the rest of the festivities
surrounding graduation, on Saturday
the senior class presidents will be host
ing "class day" â€” an event which both
commemorates and congratulates
seniors on a job well done.
The day will begin with baccalaure
ate, said David Raymond, one of this
year's four senior class presidents. The
traditional pre-Commencement event is
held in the Main Quad.
Immediately afterward, the Class of
1994's time capsule and plaque will be
dedicated. Both are set, one on top of the
other, into the walkway which circum
scribes the Quad along with mementos

from all of Stanford's past graduating
classes.
The plaque dedication will last
almost until noon, when the class presi
dents have planned a luncheon featur
ing a variety of speakers. Football coach
Bill Walsh, Psychology Prof. Laura
Carstensen and Assoc. Dean of Memori
al Church Floyd Thompkins will be the
keynote speakers, Raymond said.
"We think it will be an excellent pro
gram that all seniors should try and
attend," he said. In addition to the
keynote addresses, other members of
the Stanford community such as Bill
Stone, president of the Alumni Associa
tion, will also speak at the luncheon.
The class presidents will unveil the
seniors' gift to the University at the

reception as well. Although the nature
of the gift itself is still a secret, in previ
ous years, seniors have provided such
services as donating money to the finan
cial aid office.
Building up the suspense surround
ing this year's class gift, Raymond said
that students will "have to go to the lun
cheon to find out about the gift."
He assured students that finding out
about the gift will be well worth the
wait. "I think seniors will appreciate the
gift we have selected to donate to the
University," he said.
The event will also feature the presen
tation of the J. E. Wallace Sterling award
to a student for outstanding service. The
presentation will be made by Emory Lee,
a member of Stanford's Class of '59.
