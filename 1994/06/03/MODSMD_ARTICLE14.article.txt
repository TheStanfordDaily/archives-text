# Senior Snapshots
## Stanford Inc. Budget cuts or not, education should be the University's first order of business 
### 
A wise old political science pro
fessor used to say that "Stanford is
absolutely perfect, with plenty of
room for improvement." He was
absolutely right. One of the many
marvelous things that Stanford
teaches its students is the ability to
think critically — and so, today, we
turn our newly polished skills upon
our alma mater.
The University went through
some hard times during our stay.
The damage left by the Loma Pri
eta Earthquake welcomed us to
campus in 1990. And a drought
cost hundreds of thousands of dol
lars in overuse fines and forced the
campus to switch to the gritty
white water in its own wells. The
controversy over indirect costs fell
like a soggy flapjack out of the
stark blue valley sky.
The school reacted by cutting
budgets and hiring a couple of savvy
businesspeople to manage what the
new provost called the Stanford
"corporation." The reaction resem
bled the tide of American voters
who swept the likes of Sharon Pratt
Kelley into political office, and drove
Ross Perot closer to the presidency
than a sow to mud.
We students are not so sure that
business should take precedence
over education at a university.

The logic that a successful busi
nessperson can provide good lead
ership for a university, city or
country doesn't hold up. The new
BMOCs/BWOCs, including
Chevron boardmember and
Provost Condoleezza Rice, jammed
about "bottom lines," "sources of
revenue," and "strategic budget
cuts." They observed the school
from a business perspective
instead of an educational one.
Stanford looks promising
through the spectacles of a corpo
rate CEO. A look around the facto
ry shows that most of the students
regularly don their standard-issue
cardinal sweatshirts and baseball
hats, emblazoned with the compa
ny logo "S." Boosts company
morale, great publicity.
The Stanford consumer is not
just the anxious undergraduate
who comes to buy an education for
a piddling $108,000. The consumer
is also the job "market" which
demands a certain number of high
ly skilled workers each year.
This guided tour of the patented
Stanford conveyor belt shows how
the University meets the demand:
Stanford's quarter system was
originally installed during World
War II when large quantities of
students had to be pushed quickly

through the school into the war
effort. The system continues to
move 6,000 units through three
10-week terms each year. Howev
er, company president Gerhard
Casper's plan to truncate the
undergraduate experience to three
years simply cannot get past the
battery of genuine educators at the
University. Too bad, it would have
boosted output by 25 percent.
Stanford Inc. is making great
strides in quality control of its
product. Reinstating the failing
grade will reassure its customers,
who know that even the most effi
cient assembly lines roll off a few
duds. Soon Stanford will have its
own Inspector 12. The imposition

of a normal statistical curve of
grades ranging from A to F in all
classes will eliminate the need for
lengthy comments. Professors can
simply punch a letter grade into
AXESS. Students won't have to
waste time dealing with feedback.
The company insures harmony
in the factory by avoiding contro
versial issues. When students drew
a chalk mural in White Plaza to
protest the new three-strikes law,
company managers hosed it off,
twice. The chalk messages about
Viennese Ball and Cafe Night were
fine, since they were "social," not
"political" or "intellectual" mes


Pipo Bui and Sebastian Simsch
sages. If Latino students stage a
hunger strike in the Quad, the
CEO reassures everyone that it's
just spring fever. Unfortunately,
the gay statue incident got by.
But for the most part, Stanford
managers work hard to make
sure that not a single disturbing
idea intrudes on study time.
The administration allocates
money and time to company pri
orities. The innovative $100,000
SWOPSI program, which proba
bly taught critical thinking skills
more effectively than the West
ern Civilization requirement
ever did, was eradicated by bud
get cuts in 1992. And although
Casper failed to show up at a
reception at his own house for
undergraduates who had been
awarded honors research grants,
he made a point of visiting the
group of students who are devel

oping a hybrid gas-electric car
for Ford Motors. After all, Ford
means business. Undergraduate
theses are just an educational
exercise.
We enjoy Stanford immense
ly: the hot dry breath of poppies
in the foothills during an after
noon run, the flash of a good idea
over drinks in the Coffeehouse,
the pinch in the chest when we
realize that our neighbor's out
look is vastly different from our
own, and the implicit trust of our
professors when they leave our
exam rooms unproctored. All
these things are education.
It is time for discussions
about ideas and different per
spectives that should constitute
a Stanford education, not white
letters on a red Russell Athletics
sweatshirt.

Pipo Bui is a fifth-year senior
graduating with, a B.A. in com
munication. Sebastian Simsch is
a senior who will be co-terming
in history.

A wise old political science pro
fessor used to say that "Stanford is
absolutely perfect, with plenty of
room for improvement." He was
absolutely right. One of the many
marvelous things that Stanford
teaches its students is the ability to
think critically — and so, today, we
turn our newly polished skills upon
our alma mater.
The University went through
some hard times during our stay.
The damage left by the Loma Pri
eta Earthquake welcomed us to
campus in 1990. And a drought
cost hundreds of thousands of dol
lars in overuse fines and forced the
campus to switch to the gritty
white water in its own wells. The
controversy over indirect costs fell
like a soggy flapjack out of the
stark blue valley sky.
The school reacted by cutting
budgets and hiring a couple of savvy
businesspeople to manage what the
new provost called the Stanford
"corporation." The reaction resem
bled the tide of American voters
who swept the likes of Sharon Pratt
Kelley into political office, and drove
Ross Perot closer to the presidency
than a sow to mud.
We students are not so sure that
business should take precedence
over education at a university.

The logic that a successful busi
nessperson can provide good lead
ership for a university, city or
country doesn't hold up. The new
BMOCs/BWOCs, including
Chevron boardmember and
Provost Condoleezza Rice, jammed
about "bottom lines," "sources of
revenue," and "strategic budget
cuts." They observed the school
from a business perspective
instead of an educational one.
Stanford looks promising
through the spectacles of a corpo
rate CEO. A look around the facto
ry shows that most of the students
regularly don their standard-issue
cardinal sweatshirts and baseball
hats, emblazoned with the compa
ny logo "S." Boosts company
morale, great publicity.
The Stanford consumer is not
just the anxious undergraduate
who comes to buy an education for
a piddling $108,000. The consumer
is also the job "market" which
demands a certain number of high
ly skilled workers each year.
This guided tour of the patented
Stanford conveyor belt shows how
the University meets the demand:
Stanford's quarter system was
originally installed during World
War II when large quantities of
students had to be pushed quickly

through the school into the war
effort. The system continues to
move 6,000 units through three
10-week terms each year. Howev
er, company president Gerhard
Casper's plan to truncate the
undergraduate experience to three
years simply cannot get past the
battery of genuine educators at the
University. Too bad, it would have
boosted output by 25 percent.
Stanford Inc. is making great
strides in quality control of its
product. Reinstating the failing
grade will reassure its customers,
who know that even the most effi
cient assembly lines roll off a few
duds. Soon Stanford will have its
own Inspector 12. The imposition

of a normal statistical curve of
grades ranging from A to F in all
classes will eliminate the need for
lengthy comments. Professors can
simply punch a letter grade into
AXESS. Students won't have to
waste time dealing with feedback.
The company insures harmony
in the factory by avoiding contro
versial issues. When students drew
a chalk mural in White Plaza to
protest the new three-strikes law,
company managers hosed it off,
twice. The chalk messages about
Viennese Ball and Cafe Night were
fine, since they were "social," not
"political" or "intellectual" mes

sages. If Latino students stage a
hunger strike in the Quad, the
CEO reassures everyone that it's
just spring fever. Unfortunately,
the gay statue incident got by.
But for the most part, Stanford
managers work hard to make
sure that not a single disturbing
idea intrudes on study time.
The administration allocates
money and time to company pri
orities. The innovative $100,000
SWOPSI program, which proba
bly taught critical thinking skills
more effectively than the West
ern Civilization requirement
ever did, was eradicated by bud
get cuts in 1992. And although
Casper failed to show up at a
reception at his own house for
undergraduates who had been
awarded honors research grants,
he made a point of visiting the
group of students who are devel

oping a hybrid gas-electric car
for Ford Motors. After all, Ford
means business. Undergraduate
theses are just an educational
exercise.
We enjoy Stanford immense
ly: the hot dry breath of poppies
in the foothills during an after
noon run, the flash of a good idea
over drinks in the Coffeehouse,
the pinch in the chest when we
realize that our neighbor's out
look is vastly different from our
own, and the implicit trust of our
professors when they leave our
exam rooms unproctored. All
these things are education.
It is time for discussions
about ideas and different per
spectives that should constitute
a Stanford education, not white
letters on a red Russell Athletics
sweatshirt.
