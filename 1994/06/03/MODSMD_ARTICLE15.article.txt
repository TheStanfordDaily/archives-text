# Graduation: reconciling two separate worlds
## And refusing to leave any parts of myself at anyone's door 
### 
I'm supposed to be writing
about my experience at Stanford,
and all I can think about is
whether or not to remove the dec
orations from my walls before my
father gets here.
On the wall above my bed, I
have a "safe sex is hot sex" poster
of two women — one white, one
black — sitting in a naked
embrace, kissing passionately. I
bought the poster in the Castro
for $3 and hung it up on my wall
several months ago. Since then, it
has taken on a lot of meaning for
me. Some mornings, lying in bed
staring up at it, I have thought to
myself that one of the women in
the poster has the most adorable
toes I've ever seen.
On days when I have come
home after hearing just one
homophobic comment too many,
the poster has affirmed my
desires and my loves, and has
strengthened me in my resolve to
be out. Some days, after a friend
or a professor has made a racist
comment that cut deep, I have felt
distinctly uncomfortable with the
constructed message of racial har
mony that the poster conveys.
Other times, the poster has sim
ply been present, almost unno
ticed, just as my lesbianism and
my identity as a woman of color

sometimes are.
My past four years at Stanford
have given me the space to
explore what those identities real
ly mean in my life. The distance
(thousands of miles) from my
home and my Egyptian family has
allowed me to come out, and claim
a lesbian skin that snugly fits my
experience yet leaves room for my
ambiguities. The racism woven
into our daily fabric here at Stan

ford has challenged me to be vocal
about my experiences as a woman
of color — a challenge the magni
tude of which I began to under
stand during my freshman year
when I was confronted with the
anti-Arab comments of my dorm
mates as we watched the Gulf
War — a video game where the
stakes were Arab lives — unfold
on our big screen TV.
I am leaving Stanford with a
new vocabulary. Thanks to gifted
teachers who pushed me to rigor
ously question everything that
passed as natural, I have gathered
together words and concepts that
allow me to think critically about
social inequity. These are tools
that come with the responsibility
of using them to work toward
changing the aspects of society
that I criticize.
My friends were also some of
my most important teachers.
When we held a "Sexually Frus
trated Conservative Mud
Wrestling Day" to counter The
Review's "Conservative Coming
Out Day," we discovered what a
sharp weapon humor could be. We
have realized, much to our dis
may, that we are all part of the
system. We learned that friend
ships are strongest when they are
built on honesty, and that honest

ly confronting one another on the
ways that we are racist, or sexist,
or classist is difficult. We have
found that nights out dancing are
as essential to our well-being as
food and air. And we have accept
ed that gossip is really a sign of
affection.
My father arrives in two days.
Into the world I have created
here, he brings a suitcase of my
childhood memories complete
with brittle family tensions. He
also brings with him parts of my
life that I miss here — the smell of
Egyptian beans he cooked for my
sister and me every Sunday morn
ing (mild when he was in a good
mood, spicy when he wasn't), sto
ries about my great-grandmother,
and his box of yellowed, old fami
ly photographs.
His presence will be an impor
tant reminder that it is thanks to
his hard work that I was able to
attend Stanford. For that, I will
always be grateful. However, for
me, his visit is bittersweet
because our relationship is built
on the firm understanding that I
am not welcome in his house
unless I leave certain parts of
myself at the door.
