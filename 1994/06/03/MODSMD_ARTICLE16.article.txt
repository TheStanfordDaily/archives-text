# A 						topsy turvy graduation fever
## 
### 
Graduation has thrown my life into
tumult. Or at least it seems that way, and
perhaps I am not the only senior feeling a
bit dazed from the excitement. Not even a
dramatic Big Game victory, a two-hour
special of "Melrose Place," or picking the
Draw number 2,956 could top this whirl
wind of emotions in intensity and complex
ity. Not even close.
Little did I know, as a wide-eyed high
school graduate, that as soon as I stepped
foot on this campus I had back-flipped,
cartwheeled, and cannonballed into a
dizzying world swirling with opportunity,
challenge, late night study breaks and
friends for life. Now, for just a breath of a
moment I catch a glimpse of insight into
what I am feeling — a conflux of emotions
surging into a single crescendo.
Confusion. How did I get from age 17 to
21 in about 0.8 seconds? After spending
four years at Stanford, what did I learn,

what did I do, who did I meet, why was I
here, and why am I leaving? I know the
answers, but sorting them out is difficult,
because my undergraduate experience was
one complete package — every detail inter
twined with every other.
It is tough to reconcile my pride from
completing my degree with my uncertainty
of what lies ahead. My eagerness for
change is leashed by my love for life as a
Stanford student. Nothing is clean-cut;
welcome to the real world.
Enlightenment. Practically speaking, I
have become well-versed in the art of bik
ing through bollards without hitting any
thing or anyone, and the art of convincing
myself that mail comes only once a week,
justifying an empty post office box. But
beyond that, I find myself taking for grant
ed the intellectual adventure, the explo-


Yinq-Yinq Goh
ration of my mind, and the exam
ination of human nature which I
took part in with my professors
and my peers. The piece of paper
that will be hanging on my wall is
wholly inadequate in represent
ing what I have learned here,
which has a lot more to do with
the people I have encountered
than the hours I have spent in the
library.
Most of all, I have learned to
look upside down, inside out, and
topsyturvy at the same old ques
tions I used to think I knew the
answers to. How convoluted, to
leave an academic institution
with more questions than
answers! For me, Stanford has
fulfilled its academic mission by
helping me achieve this state of
mind.
Gratitude. This is a tribute to
the people who made a difference
in my life at the Farm. I am grate

ful for the friends who comforted
me when I needed it with a
Kleenex and a smile, sat on the
hallway floor with me to philoso
phize in the wee hours of the
morning, taught me the joy of
playing volleyball in the Oval on a
sunny Sunday afternoon, helped
me reach beyond the stars. To
those of you who forced open my
thinking — made me love new
types of music, food, dance, art —
thank you. And again, the lesson
on human nature. Every conflict,
every resolution, every conversa
tion and every silence offered me
some morsel of wisdom — cour
tesy of everyone ranging from
mere acquaintances to my closest
friends.
Fear. Deep inside, I hear this
constant whisper, "Take a risk,
take a risk. . . you can achieve
great things. .. take a risk." Then
a different voice shouts, "What if
I fall?" Or even trip for that mat
ter. Falling flat on my face is not
something I enjoy, even though I
have managed to do it often
enough. If I am lucky, there are

people there to help me up. What
reward could possibly merit the
great risks I face now, venturing
on my own? Possibly the promise
of greater strength from the
lessons learned after each fall.
Even so, the voice remains loud
and clear.
Exhilaration. I can imagine
myself standing on the highest
point of the Golden Gate Bridge
above the cables and wires on a lit
tle platform at the top. Perched
precariously but ever so calmly
over the water and people, the
night wraps around me and will
never let me fall. The stars wink a
knowing smile, my heart races as I
inhale life. With the love of my
family and friends, this is where I
am standing now, exhilarated —
and the world waits for me to
jump in. Melodramatic, I know,
but as graduation day approaches
so does the rest of my life. Here I
go.

ter. Falling flat on my face is not
something I enjoy, even though I
have managed to do it often
enough. If I am lucky, there are

people there to help me up. What
reward could possibly merit the
great risks I face now, venturing
on my own? Possibly the promise
of greater strength from the
lessons learned after each fall.
Even so, the voice remains loud
and clear.
Exhilaration. I can imagine
myself standing on the highest
point of the Golden Gate Bridge
above the cables and wires on a lit
tle platform at the top. Perched
precariously but ever so calmly
over the water and people, the
night wraps around me and will
never let me fall. The stars wink a
knowing smile, my heart races as I
inhale life. With the love of my
family and friends, this is where I
am standing now, exhilarated —
and the world waits for me to
jump in. Melodramatic, I know,
but as graduation day approaches
so does the rest of my life. Here I
go.
