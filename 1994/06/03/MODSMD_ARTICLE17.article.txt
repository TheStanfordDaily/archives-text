# Our responsibility to change the world
## Attitudes and behaviors count 
### 
This column is dedicated to
Sherifa Omade Edoga.
Why am I writing this column
instead of finishing the honors the
sis that I need to complete in order
to graduate in six days? Because I
believe that, as a human, I must
continually strive to better the
world, and right now that means
writing this column.
Part of my responsibility is to
examine my every behavior and
attitude, because each one sup
ports and/or challenges the values,
beliefs and norms of our culture. I
do not live in a vacuum; everything
I do affects the world around me.
Therefore, I attempt to always
act and think in ways that promote
the type of world that I want to cre
ate. In this new world, everyone
would be valued equally as being
fully human, but this would not
mean assimilating to the same
ideal. Instead of the current defini
tion of "human" that positively
marks some groups as genetically

selected and labels others as genet
ically inferior, the new conception
of being human would value us all
equally.
If we were to value all humans
equally, our behavior and our world
would be remarkably different.
Everyone would have adequate
food and a home, because we and
the institutions of our world would
not pretend not to see hungry peo
ple on the streets of Palo Alto, or
homeless ones in Washington, D. C.
Stanford University would not
allow the owners of Webb Ranch to
exploit Chicana/o workers, and we,
as humans, would not turn our
heads away from the rampant mur
ders of blacks in Los Angeles and
Rwanda
Instead, we and the institutions

of our world would value yellow,
red, brown and black humans as
much as white ones.
Women and men at Stanford
and in Bosnia would not be raped,
because we and the institutions of
our world would not see women
and men as objects for exploitation.
The "Gay Liberation" statue
would not be vandalized, and gay
and lesbian couples could display
their love for one another as readi
ly as straight partners, because we
and the institutions of our world
would value their sexuality as
much as that of straight people.
Disabled students would be able
to live in every room on campus
and attend any professor's office
hours, because we and the institu
tions of our world would seek their
contributions as fellow humans.
We would not be destroying the
only planet where we can live,
because we and the institutions of
our world would recognize that we
are members of a community
called Earth.
There would be no need for eth
nic studies, because a Stanford
education would teach about all
humans and not just those who are
privileged. Stanford students
would not believe that white land
owners are acting as good, efficient
capitalists when they spray deadly
pesticides on the crops that are
handled by farm workers who are
mostly Chicana/o. Instead, the
Economics Department would
teach us that we are all humans of
equal value and that sacrificing
others and the planet in order to
accrue capital is inhuman.
I refuse to rest on my privilege
as a white, straight, upper-middle
class, educated, able-bodied man. I
am determined to make certain
that my every thought and my
resulting behaviors aim to create a
world where all other humans are
valued as much as I am. If my atti
tudes and actions do not support
this new world with its new defini
tion of being human, then I am
instituting the old mode of being
that, along with its positive effects,
has killed many and hurt us all.
It is not enough for me to say, "I
am not racist, sexist, homophobic,
etc." I am behaving in a racist, sex
ist, and homophobic manner when
I assume that an African-American
student is less intelligent than me
or was admitted to Stanford to be a
varsity athlete; when I do not
explain to my friends, family, pro
fessors, and future children the
problems with jokes that objectify
and dehumanize women; when I do
not speak up when I hear someone
say "faggot" in the hallway outside
my room; when I allow Stanford to
spend $860,000 on the Capital


Matthew Shaggy Mizel
Improvement Program for my res
idence but not make every floor, let
alone any bedroom, in the house
disabled accessible.
It is my responsibility as a
human to work proactively for
change. I must challenge and edu
cate myself so that I can encourage
others to do the same. I need to
develop the knowledge and skills
that I will need to treat other

humans, including friends and
romantic partners, with the
respect and understanding that
they deserve.
My careers must promote a
new world and not serve solely as
a route for material gain â€” so I
have chosen to make feature films
in order to teach that being
human is not a function of our
genes but of our constructed con
sciousness and that all humans
are of equal value. Most impor
tantly, my every action as a father
needs to be preparing my children
to create and live in this new

world, but I need to have the
strength to love and accept them if
their values differ from mine Out
of this new conception of being
human, one that values all of us
equally, will come deep and lasting
change.
I hope you will join me.

Matthew Shaggy Mizel is graduat
