Friendship is like that plastic thingy on
a six-pack. It holds it together, and even
after you've finished drinking all the beer,
it's still there. Indestructible. And it kills
waterfowl if dumped incorrectly.
The six of us met in late September of
1990. Our bonding began when we
attempted to steal a rack of Smartfood
from Tresidder Express. Thus began a life
of larceny at Stanford.
One of us got married, one got engaged,
one didn't date anyone (though he tried
darn hard), and one of us dated everyone.
Several of us visited the hospital, one of us
had a little trouble choosing a major, one
had no trouble completing two majors, two
of us got Phi Beta Knppn and one got on
academic probation. Three of us became
RAs, all of us harassed RAs, one of us grad
uated early, one of us will never graduate,
and we all enlarged our pecs.
We received free Advil from Cowell for
separated shoulders, we received injections
in our posterior for vertigo, we chipped a
tooth, we tore cartilage, we bled constantly,
we needed an IV, and one of us contracted
TB, bronchitis, and pneumonia — all in the

same year.
We kept the Axe for three consecutive
years. We were there during The Play 11.
And we stormed the field.
We lived in many different places on
campus, but there was always one big,
greasy, constant in our lives. Yes, we ate
food service for four years. And lived.
Thanks, Metamucil!
By far, the most memorable experience
was when our designated driver got drunk
and broke our door during Malt Liquor
Sunday. This was even better than his pre
vious trip to the hospital when no one
would listen to him, and he tried to tell the
doctor how to insert the IV.
We participated in The Game. We sur
vived CIV and SLE. We took ME 101 and
did not sleep. We recited Scottish poetry for
an appreciative audience at Exotic Erotic.
We refused to drink, and we drank too
much. Then we vomited. Together. We
made a mess, yet we were anal-retentively
clean. We saw the Bills lose. Four times.
Now that is humiliating.
More humiliating than anything we'd
experienced: The early bad grades. The IM
defeats. The dating rejections. The
Linebacker. The Pie Chart. Those smells.
More hospital visits. Inopportune

romances. Being hit on by professors.
But our wacky adventures made every
thing better.
Oh, the places you'll go
Stanford will grant us degrees in
English, poli sci, product design, biology,
economics, mechanical engineering, and,
perhaps someday (God willing) interna
tional relations. But don't hold your
breath. We pulled all-nighters. We pro
duced good problem sets under the influ
ence of alcohol. We produced poor work
while sober. We procrastinated. We even
went into the library — some of us.
Our greatest disappointment has been
those few classmates we grew to hate. You
brown-nosing, grade-sucking, resume
packing, TA-flattering, Sasquatch-pound
ing grubs! You know who you are. But we
rose above you, stayed in classes you
dropped because your antics failed, and
completed our requirements. So there!
And guess what? Our honorably earned
degrees will mean just as much as the
stinking, rotting, decayed, feces-covered
parchment you purchased at the cost of
your souls and dignity. Arrivederci. Next
time we meet, we'll fire you.
As members of the Stanford communi

ty, we grew and developed in ways we could
not (and in fact, did not) imagine. We
learned the art of oyoling professors. We
learned that TAs are not to be trusted. We
learned that you can hold your own against
anyone in this place when it comes to pick

up basketball. If you're willing to bite. We
found out that sometimes you really don't
have to go to lecture. But you must attend
section, especially if you're leading it. We


David Sapoznikow and Christopher Yeh
learned that sometimes you don't
have to study for the final in order
to get an A, and that sometimes if
you study, you'll pull a 17 (pretty
good for Physics 51).
We participated in The Daily,
The Review, Release (may it rest in
peace), all those darn literary mag
azines — and their naked shots —
IMs, club sports, SPONGE,
SHARP, the Bridge, Hillel, SEAS,
SURE, SIG, and of course, FOFFA
(our group of six). We still wish we
could have done more. But our
time here draws nigh, and it's time
to saddle up the horses and drive
off the cliff with Thelma and
Louise.
All good things...
The six of us developed a special
bond that will last forever. We are
brothers. Even more closely bond
ed than Devo. But we could be any

one on this campus. We have all
learned how to make friends and
influence the weak. We have all
been part of dorm communities
that shaped our lives, whether suc
cessfully or disastrously.
We h r e toiled long and hard,
often not seeing the fruits of our
labor for long stretches — only the
afterbirth, which we couldn't very
well eat. We have all lived at Stan
ford, savored its many experiences,
abused our privileges, and grown.
The six of us have been lucky. We
have succeeded in this place. We
have our degrees. Yet we have
managed to do so much . l°r...
We have attempted to embody
every negative stereotype of college
students we ever saw. And Stan
ford still smiled sweetly on us, and
thought, "They will mature and
represent me proudly. Eventually."

Chris, an English major, expects to
be drafted in the first round by the
Los Angeles Lakers. Dave, an eco
nomics major, is hooked on phon
ics. Thanks Stanford!
