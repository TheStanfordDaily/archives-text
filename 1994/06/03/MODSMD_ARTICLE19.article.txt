# Alum Carter, scholar on affirmative action, to address graduates
## 
### Julie Makinen Senior staff writer 
Yale law professor and Stanford
alumnus Stephen Carter, a controver
sial commentator on affirmative action
and religion in public life, will address
the Class of 1994 as this year's com
mencement speaker.
A member of the Class of '76, Carter
has been described as both a black lib
eral and a black conservative. He is
widely recognized as an expert in such
legal areas as constitutional law, con
tracts and intellectual property, and
has authored two critically acclaimed
books, both of which fail to place him
squarely in either the liberal or conser
vative court.
His first work, "Reflections of an
Affirmative Action Baby," was
described by the New York Times as "a
nuanced discussion" of issues raised by
affirmative action.
In the book, Carter says he has been
a been a beneficiary of such programs
and says he basically supports them.
But while he defends affirmative
action for the opportunities it has cre
ated in "spreading education and

employment around," Carter portrays
the policy as a mixed blessing which
has benefited middle-class blacks like
himself but has failed "millions of
struggling blacks."
His 1993 work, "The Culture of Dis-

belief: How American
Law and Politics Trivi
alize Religious Devo
tion," explores how
religion has been forced
from the public realm
over the last 20 years.
President Clinton has
singled out the work as
one of his recent
favorites.

Carter, an Episcopalian, argues in
the book that contrary to the opinions
among the "liberal media" and policy
elites, religious commitment is neither
an eccentric hobby nor a naive affecta
tion. Rather, religious opinions have a
place in public policy debates, Carter
says, though government should not
advance the interests of one religion
over another.
"If the Christian Coalition is wrong
for America," writes Carter, "it must
be because its message is wrong on the

issues, not because its message is reli
gious."
His forthcoming book, "The Confir
mation Mess: Cleaning up the Federal
Appointments Process," is due out at
the end of May. In it, Carter analyzes
the failed confirmations of Lani Guinier
and Supreme Court nominee Robert
Bork, criticizing litmus tests for court
nominees but proposing that the Senate
pursue lines of inquiry such as the can
didate's qualifications, the respect of
the public, immoral conduct, illegal con
duct and unethical conduct.
Carter was selected by University
President Gerhard Casper from a
ranked list of 16 possible speakers sub
mitted by the senior class presidents.
Among the suggested speakers were
South African President Nelson Man
dela, poet Maya Angelou, late-night
talk show guru David Letterman and
authors Scott Turow and Ken Kesey.
"Carter is a great person for the
commencement speaker. He is accom
plished and an excellent speaker," said
Dana Weeks, one of the senior class
presidents, who added that she hopes
Carter's views will spark discussion
among students and their families.

A former law clerk for the late
Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Mar
shall, Carter is the William Nelson
Cromwell Professor of Law at Yale,
where he has taught since 1982. He was
appointed to the National Commission
on Judicial Discipline and Removal by
President Bush.
Dean of Stanford Law School Paul
Brest said he held Carter in high regard
and was pleased with the choice.
"I think it's terrific," Brest said,
adding that the Law School had been
trying independently to persuade
Carter to speak at Stanford.
Law Prof. Kathleen Sullivan, a noted
constitutional law scholar, pointed out
in praise of Carter that "very few pro
fessors have written one . . . block
buster non-fiction book . . . much less
two." Sullivan also noted that Carter's
"Culture of Disbelief' is the only book
by a law professor that's "recommend
ed reading" by Clinton.
Despite acclaim among his col
leagues in the law arena, the choice of
Carter disappointed some students who
were hoping for a speaker with a more
household name.
Senior Andrew Byrnes, political

director of the Stanford Democrats,
said he was "somewhat disappointed"
by the selection of Carter. He said
recent moves by what he called a con
servative University administration
made him suspicious at "the selection of
a somewhat obscure speaker . . . who
just happens to be a conservative him
self."
But Casper said academics and Stan
ford ties — not politics — were behind
the decision.
"There was no agenda behind this,"
Casper said. "I feel about this some
what strongly — the commencement
speaker should have some Stanford
connection." Selecting an academic is
appropriate, said Casper, since it is a
"commencement of an academic insti
tution."
Previous commencement speakers
have included television anchorman
and Stanford alumnus Ted Koppel in
1986; Children's Defense Fund leader
Marian Wright Edelman in 1990; Com
mon Cause founder John Gardner in
1991; and modern art expert Kirk
Varnedoe in 1992. Sen. Dianne Fein
stein, Class of '55, addressed last year's
graduates.
