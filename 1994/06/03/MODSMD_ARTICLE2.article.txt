# Students criticize senate's actions
## Disgruntled with hasty decision, early drop deadline 
### Linda Friedlieb Editorial staff 
After hearing about Stan
ford's revised grading policy —
including the return of a failing
grade — many students gave
Faculty Senate members some
low marks of their own yester
day.

"I'm most upset not only
that [the Faculty Senate]
passed the policy, but that they
rushed it in at the end of the
year without adequate time to
discuss the policy or alterna
tives to the policy," said sopho
more Jessica Schneider.
"I'm really upset with the
way that they gathered student

input," said Council of Presi
dents member Anietie Ekanem,
who serves as an ex-officio
member of the senate. "There
are close to 13,000 students
who don't understand the issue
or are mad."
The policy was first proposed
to the senate at the end of April,
and two town meetings were re
cently held to gather student
input.
Most of the policy passed yes
terday will not take effect until
the 1995-96 academic year. The
policy will reinstate a failing
grade, move the add deadline to
the third week of the quarter, the
drop deadline to the fourth week
and the deadline to declare
pass/no credit to the sixth week of

If we're going to be constrained to have to
make wise decisions early in the quarter, then
we'd better force faculty and the administra
tion to give us the information to give us the

the quarter. Classes dropped be
tween the fourth and eighth
weeks of the quarter will be
marked with a "W" on the tran
script.
Changes to the retake policy
will impact courses taken for the
first time beginning fall quarter.
Under the new policy, courses
can only be retaken once, unless a
failing grade is received the sec
ond time in which case the course
may be taken a third time. Retak
en classes will be denoted by an
"RP" (repeated course) on tran
scripts.
Senior Eddie Garcia, who
chaired the Student Advisory
Group on Undergraduate Educa
tion, said he was "disappointed
that some of the student recom
mendations were not implement
ed," referring to an effort to put
the drop deadline at the sixth
week.
"I think we'll see a trend of
more students taking classes
P/NC since the deadline for that
is the sixth week," he said. "The
drop deadline was the critical
question. The whole opportunity
to get feedback on your work
often does not come before the
fourth week."
Schneider, who attended open
meetings and sent electronic mail
to Geology Prof. Gail Mahood, an
author of the policy, said she op
posed the proposed changes from
the start.

"The part I most objected to
was the withdrawal (deadline) —
that it is moved from the night
before the final to the fourth
week," she said, pointing out
that a recorded "W" would be
seen as a negative element on a
transcript.
Freshman Anne Woolley said
she would have liked to see a
more flexible proposal pass.
"I don't really care about the
new retake policy. I think [re
takes] can be a problem, especial
ly in pre-med chemistry courses,"

she said. "But I am upset about
not being able to drop a class
after the [fourth] week. That
takes away most of the flexibility
that Stanford is known for."
Freshman Patrick Tsai said he
was not surprised the policy
passed. "I'm upset that not as
many [students] voiced their con
cerns. More input would have
been beneficial," he said. He
added that he thought the policy
was a "good thing."
"I think it'll work out to help
the whole student body," Tsai

said. "I think most students are
going to be upset. But most stu
dents will be responsible enough
to handle it well. I don't think it
will cause many difficulties."
However, some students who
actively voiced concerns about
the policy in the weeks preceding
its passage said the new system
should put a greater burden on
faculty.
"If we're going to be con
strained to have to make wise de
cisions early in the quarter, then
we'd better force faculty and the
administration to give us the in
formation to give us the ability to
make those choices," said junior
David Cohen, who authored an
alternate grading policy infor
mally backed by the ASSU.
"What we have to concentrate
on now is getting the horse back
out in front of the cart," he said,
pointing out that students
should make it clear that the ad
vising system needs to be ad
dressed and professors should be
"more responsible" in planning
and scheduling their courses.
ASSU Senate Chair Nawwar
Kasrawi said he hopes this is
"the first step in a series of
changes."
Now that the policy has
passed, "I definitely hope that we
will see the commitment from the
faculty," he said, citing a commit
ment from the Commission on
Undergraduate Education to im
prove advising and to stress good
teaching.

After hearing about Stan
ford's revised grading policy —
including the return of a failing
grade — many students gave
Faculty Senate members some
low marks of their own yester
day.

"I'm most upset not only
that [the Faculty Senate]
passed the policy, but that they
rushed it in at the end of the
year without adequate time to
discuss the policy or alterna
tives to the policy," said sopho
more Jessica Schneider.
"I'm really upset with the
way that they gathered student

input," said Council of Presi
dents member Anietie Ekanem,
who serves as an ex-officio
member of the senate. "There
are close to 13,000 students
who don't understand the issue
or are mad."
The policy was first proposed
to the senate at the end of April,
and two town meetings were re
cently held to gather student
input.
Most of the policy passed yes
terday will not take effect until
the 1995-96 academic year. The
policy will reinstate a failing
grade, move the add deadline to
the third week of the quarter, the
drop deadline to the fourth week
and the deadline to declare
pass/no credit to the sixth week of

If we're going to be constrained to have to
make wise decisions early in the quarter, then
we'd better force faculty and the administra
tion to give us the information to give us the
ability to make those choices.' ______

the quarter. Classes dropped be
tween the fourth and eighth
weeks of the quarter will be
marked with a "W" on the tran
script.
Changes to the retake policy
will impact courses taken for the
first time beginning fall quarter.
Under the new policy, courses
can only be retaken once, unless a
failing grade is received the sec
ond time in which case the course
may be taken a third time. Retak
en classes will be denoted by an
"RP" (repeated course) on tran
scripts.
Senior Eddie Garcia, who
chaired the Student Advisory
Group on Undergraduate Educa
tion, said he was "disappointed
that some of the student recom
mendations were not implement
ed," referring to an effort to put
the drop deadline at the sixth
week.
"I think we'll see a trend of
more students taking classes
P/NC since the deadline for that
is the sixth week," he said. "The
drop deadline was the critical
question. The whole opportunity
to get feedback on your work
often does not come before the
fourth week."
Schneider, who attended open
meetings and sent electronic mail
to Geology Prof. Gail Mahood, an
author of the policy, said she op
posed the proposed changes from
the start.

"The part I most objected to
was the withdrawal (deadline) —
that it is moved from the night
before the final to the fourth
week," she said, pointing out
that a recorded "W" would be
seen as a negative element on a
transcript.
Freshman Anne Woolley said
she would have liked to see a
more flexible proposal pass.
"I don't really care about the
new retake policy. I think [re
takes] can be a problem, especial
ly in pre-med chemistry courses,"

she said. "But I am upset about
not being able to drop a class
after the [fourth] week. That
takes away most of the flexibility
that Stanford is known for."
Freshman Patrick Tsai said he
was not surprised the policy
passed. "I'm upset that not as
many [students] voiced their con
cerns. More input would have
been beneficial," he said. He
added that he thought the policy
was a "good thing."
"I think it'll work out to help
the whole student body," Tsai

said. "I think most students are
going to be upset. But most stu
dents will be responsible enough
to handle it well. I don't think it
will cause many difficulties."
However, some students who
actively voiced concerns about
the policy in the weeks preceding
its passage said the new system
should put a greater burden on
faculty.
"If we're going to be con
strained to have to make wise de
cisions early in the quarter, then
we'd better force faculty and the
administration to give us the in
formation to give us the ability to
make those choices," said junior
David Cohen, who authored an
alternate grading policy infor
mally backed by the ASSU.
"What we have to concentrate
on now is getting the horse back
out in front of the cart," he said,
pointing out that students
should make it clear that the ad
vising system needs to be ad
dressed and professors should be
"more responsible" in planning
and scheduling their courses.
ASSU Senate Chair Nawwar
Kasrawi said he hopes this is
"the first step in a series of
changes."
Now that the policy has
passed, "I definitely hope that we
will see the commitment from the
faculty," he said, citing a commit
ment from the Commission on
Undergraduate Education to im
prove advising and to stress good
teaching.
