# With a little help...
## Class of '94 raises over $106K 
### Jo Marshall Staff writer 
Close to half of all seniors have
donated to the senior class gift
program this year, raising over
$106,000 with substantial help
from a fund-matching program
and University trustee Peter Bing.
Since February, 703 seniors
have given a total of $14,091 to the
fund, said Caroline Chang, director
of development for students and
recent graduates. Last year, 125
seniors pledged a total of $4,000.
This year's seniors were asked
to make a one-time gift of at least
$10 rather than simply pledging
future funds. "We'll take check,
cash or Visa," Chang said.
Bing, along with the Parents
Advisory Board, created an extra
incentive this year through the
Bing Senior Gift Challenge by
promising to quadruple the total
amount of money donated by stu
dents. The advisory board pledged
to match every senior's gift, and

Bing would then match the sum of
those two gifts.
Bing also offered another chal
lenge: if a third of the senior class
participated in the program, he
would give an additional $50,000
to the fund. That goal was met.
If half the class had participat
ed, Bing would have increased that
contribution to $150,000 in addi
tion to matching the seniors' gifts.
Bruce McCaul, a member of the
parents advisory board, said he was
surprised at how few seniors had
donated in previous years. He added
that he is pleased that the matching
program has encouraged more
students to participate this year.
"It's important that so many
students have participated this
year and that they recognized that
giving [to Stanford] is an essential
factor in the long term health of
the University," McCaul said.
Chang said she believes the gift
program is more interactive than
simply pledging to give money
later. "A pledge is passive. Here

[the students made] their gift
before June 1," she said.
The senior class gift committee
and other student volunteers
mailed and telephoned seniors to
encourage them to donate to the
fund, said Michelle Dicks, chair of
the senior class gift committee.
Dicks said she explained to stu
dents that although they pay high
tuition fees at Stanford, 40 per
cent of the money needed to edu
cate them comes from private
gifts to the University.
"Personally, I believe that the
experience [at Stanford] has been
mostly a positive one, and I want
to make sure that upcoming stu
dents have the same positive expe
rience," Dicks said.
A check for the total amount
received for the fund, will be pre
sented to University President
Gerhard Casper on Class Day,
June 11. Casper and Provost Con
doleezza Rice will decide where
the money will be channeled,
Chang said.
