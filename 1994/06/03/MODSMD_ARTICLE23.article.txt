# FOUR YEARS IN THE LIFE OF STANFORD SENIORS
## 9091 
### 
SEPTEMBER
• Two federal agents began an
investigation to determine if
Stanford was overbilling the gov
ernment for overhead costs of fed -
erally sponsored research.
"I do not expect a discovery of
any wrongdoing on our part,"
University President Donald
Kennedy told The Daily.
OCTOBER
• In response to the govern
ment's recently passed Drug-Free
Schools and Communities Act,
the University announced a new
alcohol and drug policy explicitly

prohibiting the unlawful use of
alcohol and drugs on campus.
• Stanford became one of the
first universities in the nation to
extend married housing privileges
to gay and lesbian students, as
well as to committed partners of
heterosexual students.
NOVEMBER
• A divided Faculty Senate
voted to revamp the distribution
requirements that undergradu
ates must complete to graduate,
placing a greater emphasis on
the study of race, religion and
gender.

DECEMBER
• The Interfraternity Council
voted overwhelmingly to require
all campus fraternities to hold an
alcohol-free Rush spring quarter, a
move the IFC president described
as a "major policy change."
JANUARY
• Students reacted with both
passion and inattention to the
news that the United States had
declared war in the Persian Gulf.
Hundreds of students took
part in a teach-in, dozens of dor
mitories held programs on the
conflict and several "die-ins" gar

nered attention in White Plaza.
• Despite a nationwide recession
and War in the Persian Gulf, Stan
ford's Centennial Campaign broke
the $1 billion mark. By the end of
the campaign in October, Stanford
had raised $1.1 billion in the most
ambitious fund-raising drive ever
conducted by a university.
FEBRUARY
• The Sexual Assault Task
Force released its long-awaited
report, recommending direct
action by the University to com
bat rape and other sexual crimes
on campus. Among the recom
mendations were a call for a coor
dinator of sexual assault response
services and a less-stringent stan
dard of proof for Fundamental
Standard cases.
MARCH
• University President Donald
Kennedy and Stanford's indirect
cost practices took a heavy beat
ing before the House Subcommit
tee on Oversight and Investiga
tions, chaired by Rep. John Din
gell, D-Mich. The event marked
the climax of the media hoopla
that had surrounded the contro
versy over how Stanford charges
the government for the indirect
costs of federally sponsored pro
jects.
• Kennedy announced $7 million
in new programs to improve under
graduate teaching at Stanford.
APRIL
• The Office of Naval Research
delivered punishing blows to the
University, terminating close to
the 100 accounting agreements
and slashing Stanford's indirect
cost rate from 78 percent to 55.5
percent. The actions were taken
by the Navy after its negotiations
with the University broke down

without a settlement.
• The new Lucile Salter
Packard Children's Hospital was
dedicated in a ceremony featuring
first lady Barbara Bush, Gov.
Pete Wilson and a crowd of more
than 20,000.
MAY
• Projected budget shortfalls of
$20 million in the 1991-92 aca
demic year and $30 million the
following year forced the Univer
sity to take several painful steps,
including a near freeze in faculty
hiring, a six-month postponement
of annual faculty and staff salary
increases and sharp limits on
Library purchases.
• The Students First slate
defeated the People's Platform
slate in the Council of Presidents
race. Like past elections, this one
became embroiled in controversy
when MEChA, after being defeat-

Ed in the general election, con
vinced the ASSU Senate to place
in on the runoff ballot.
• Stuart Reges, a computer sci
ence lecturer, was fired for carry
ing illegal drugs on campus and
buying alcoholic beverages for
under-age students. Reges had
written a letter to the national
drug czar Bob Martinez admitting
he carried and used drugs to
protest U.S. drug policy. The con
troversy surrounding the case
was covered by the national media
and raised questions on campus
regarding free speech.
• Dr. Francis Conley, a promi
nent neurosurgeon at the School
of Medicine, resigned, charging
"pervasive sexism throughout the
entire environment (of the
school)." Conley, who first came
to Stanford 25 years prior as an
intern, officially announced her
resignation May 23.

FEBRUARY
• The Sexual Assault Task
Force released its long-awaited
report, recommending direct
action by the University to com
bat rape and other sexual crimes
on campus. Among the recom
mendations were a call for a coor
dinator of sexual assault response
services and a less-stringent stan
dard of proof for Fundamental
Standard cases.
MARCH
• University President Donald
Kennedy and Stanford's indirect
cost practices took a heavy beat
ing before the House Subcommit
tee on Oversight and Investiga
tions, chaired by Rep. John Din
gell, D-Mich. The event marked
the climax of the media hoopla
that had surrounded the contro
versy over how Stanford charges
the government for the indirect
costs of federally sponsored pro
jects.
• Kennedy announced $7 million
in new programs to improve under
graduate teaching at Stanford.
APRIL
• The Office of Naval Research
delivered punishing blows to the
University, terminating close to
the 100 accounting agreements
and slashing Stanford's indirect
cost rate from 78 percent to 55.5
percent. The actions were taken
by the Navy after its negotiations
with the University broke down

without a settlement.
• The new Lucile Salter
Packard Children's Hospital was
dedicated in a ceremony featuring
first lady Barbara Bush, Gov.
Pete Wilson and a crowd of more
than 20,000.
MAY
• Projected budget shortfalls of
$20 million in the 1991-92 aca
demic year and $30 million the
following year forced the Univer
sity to take several painful steps,
including a near freeze in faculty
hiring, a six-month postponement
of annual faculty and staff salary
increases and sharp limits on
Library purchases.
• The Students First slate
defeated the People's Platform
slate in the Council of Presidents
race. Like past elections, this one
became embroiled in controversy
when MEChA, after being defeat-

Ed in the general election, con
vinced the ASSU Senate to place
in on the runoff ballot.
• Stuart Reges, a computer sci
ence lecturer, was fired for carry
ing illegal drugs on campus and
buying alcoholic beverages for
under-age students. Reges had
written a letter to the national
drug czar Bob Martinez admitting
he carried and used drugs to
protest U.S. drug policy. The con
troversy surrounding the case
was covered by the national media
and raised questions on campus
regarding free speech.
• Dr. Francis Conley, a promi
nent neurosurgeon at the School
of Medicine, resigned, charging
"pervasive sexism throughout the
entire environment (of the
school)." Conley, who first came
to Stanford 25 years prior as an
intern, officially announced her
resignation May 23.
