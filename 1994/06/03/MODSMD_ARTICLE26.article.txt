• During a tour through the
Bay Area, President Clinton

political arena, former congress
man and Law Prof. Tom Camp

"weak" academic areas could be
eliminated, she said.
• The Weenies won their first
Big Game since 1986. The final
score was a whopping 46-17. Cal
students won back the Axe, but

astonishment and protest from
campus community members.
APRIL
• University administrators
announced that there would be no
cuts to the ethnic centers in the
first year of budget cuts, eliciting
from students a sigh of cautious
relief. In addition, the Career
Planning and Placement Center
was spared from a planned
$50,000 cut.
• In the ASSU general elec
tions, half of the 36 groups that
applied for special-fee funding
lost; for several, this was due to

tion and to create a more histori
cal student transcript.
MAY
• A group of nine Stanford stu

dents filed suit against Stanford
over the campus speech code,
which prohibits students from
making inflammatory statements
based on race, sex, religion, hand
icap or sexual orientation. The

dard violates both the federal and
state constitution, and calls for its
immediate repeal. The code has
never been enforced since it was
instituted in 1990.

hunger strike in the Quad, pre
senting the administration with a
list of four demands: the creation
of a community center in East
Palo Alto, a campus-wide ban on
grapes, the creation of a Chicano
Studies program and the rehiring
of Chicana administrator Cecilia
Burciaga.

Four students struck for three
days, the duration of the strike,
and hundreds of others skipped at
least one meal in support of the
demands. The administration
offered limited concessions on the
first day of the strike, including
the creation of three committees
to investigate a ban on grapes, the
feasibility of a Chicano Studies
program and the East Palo Alto
community center.

ing for Asian American Studies
spoke out of turn at a Faculty
Senate meeting, leading to the
premature adjournment of the
meeting.

Liberation" sculpture on the west
side of campus. They caused
between $7,900 and $8,900 of dam
age, by striking and pouring black
paint on the sculpture, and jam
ming a bench between two of the
figures. The incident drew
widespread criticism from the cam
pus community, and several mem
bers and supporters of the gay com
munity particularly urged tough
sanctions against the vandals.
• On the eve of final exams, the
Faculty Senate passed a tough
new grading policy, which
includes a failing grade and more
restrictive guidelines for drop

OCTOBER
• The University's indoor
smoking ban went into effect,
leaving smokers in search of
wide-open, or at least well-venti
lated, space where they could take
a few puffs. Next year, smokers
will also be forced to buy their
cigarettes off campus.
• During a tour through the
Bay Area, President Clinton
announced a $237 million boost
for the Stanford Linear Accelera
tor Center. The Department of
Energy recommended that SLAC
receive the funds to upgrade its B
factory — an improvement which
could eventually help scientists
discover the origins of the uni
verse.
• After two years in limbo, the
University launched a new sexual
harassment policy. The policy
includes provisions for com
plainant confidentiality and offers
complainants more options for
informal resolution.
• The annual Big Game Bonfire
was canceled in order to protect
the re-emergence of California
tiger salamanders in Lake Lagu
nita, the traditional site of the
bonfire. Environmentalists said
the bonfire would "undoubtedly
cook" the salamanders, which
were once thought to be extinct
on the Peninsula.
• The Commission on Under
graduate Education, chaired by

History Prof. James Sheehan, got
underway with its sweeping, year
long study of all aspects of Stan
ford's undergraduate program.
Among its areas of study were
advising, distribution require
ments, residential education and
the feasibility of a three-year
degree. The commission will
deliver its final report in the fall.
NOVEMBER
• After one year out of the
political arena, former congress
man and Law Prof. Tom Camp
bell returns — this time, he was
elected to the state senate.
• Provost Rice announced
another $20 million in budget
cuts over the next three years.
The cuts would come mainly out
of administrative areas, and some
"weak" academic areas could be
eliminated, she said.
• The Weenies won their first
Big Game since 1986. The final
score was a whopping 46-17. Cal
students won back the Axe, but
also tried to tear down a goalpost
and attack the Tree.
DECEMBER
• Joining several other univer
sities, Stanford rescinded its
divestment policies in South

Defense.
Perry had
spent the past
year serving
as deputy
defense secre
tary.

• The California Supreme
Court ruled that Stanford must
allow its athletes to be tested for
drugs in order to maintain NCAA
eligibility. A Stanford diver first
filed the lawsuit in 1987, alleging
that the NCAA rules violated the
right to privacy. The University
later joined the lawsuit and had
since been exempted from drug
testing.

Casa Zapata, Burciaga was told
her job in the Office of Student
Affairs would be eliminated as of
August. Her layoff sparked anger,
astonishment and protest from
campus community members.
APRIL
• University administrators
announced that there would be no
cuts to the ethnic centers in the
first year of budget cuts, eliciting
from students a sigh of cautious
relief. In addition, the Career
Planning and Placement Center
was spared from a planned
$50,000 cut.
• In the ASSU general elec
tions, half of the 36 groups that
applied for special-fee funding
lost; for several, this was due to
an unusually high abstention
rate. Eight groups that received a
majority of "yes" votes still were
not funded because the number of
"yes" votes did not constitute 15
percent of the student population,
as required by ASSU Bylaws.

professors and giving an address
on global responsibility.
• The California Attorney Gen

headed by Geology Prof. Gail
Mahood introduced a sweeping
proposal to tighten the current
grading policy by reinstating a

tion and to create a more histori
cal student transcript.
MAY
• A group of nine Stanford stu

dents filed suit against Stanford
over the campus speech code,
which prohibits students from
making inflammatory statements
based on race, sex, religion, hand
icap or sexual orientation. The
suit claims the Grey Interpreta
tion of the Fundamental Stan
dard violates both the federal and
state constitution, and calls for its
immediate repeal. The code has
never been enforced since it was
instituted in 1990.
• Protesting the University's
"open hostility toward minori
ties," Chicano students went on a
hunger strike in the Quad, pre
senting the administration with a
list of four demands: the creation
of a community center in East
Palo Alto, a campus-wide ban on
grapes, the creation of a Chicano
Studies program and the rehiring
of Chicana administrator Cecilia
Burciaga.

Four students struck for three
days, the duration of the strike,
and hundreds of others skipped at
least one meal in support of the
demands. The administration
offered limited concessions on the
first day of the strike, including
the creation of three committees
to investigate a ban on grapes, the
feasibility of a Chicano Studies
program and the East Palo Alto
community center.
• Stanford alumnus Stephen
Breyer, chief judge of the Ist U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals, was

ing for Asian American Studies
spoke out of turn at a Faculty
Senate meeting, leading to the
premature adjournment of the
