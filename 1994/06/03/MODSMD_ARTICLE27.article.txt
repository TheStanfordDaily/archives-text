# A 						visitor's guide to Palo Alto
## 
### Romesh Ratnesar Senior staff writer 
Though it was founded in the
late 1800s primarily as an area to
serve the new Stanford University,
Palo Alto over the last century has
developed a unique, charming
identity all its own. Celebrating its
100 th birthday this year, the city
today teems with a vibrant array of
cultural and culinary attractions.
Coming to Palo Alto should
include a visit to "El Palo Alto,"
the stately, towering tree that
inspired Stanford's symbol. Locat
ed on Alma Avenue, near the junc
tion of El Camino, "The Tree"
aptly symbolizes the elegance,
growth and longevity of the Stan
ford neighborhood.
Just a few blocks away, on
Waverley Street north of Universi
ty Avenue, is the Barbie Doll Hall
of Fame, which contains the
world's largest collection of that
ail-American blond plastic icon.
More than 14,000 dolls chart the
historical progression of the Barbie
and her uncanny ability to adjust
to changing fads and fashions.
Other local museums include the
Museum of American Heritage on
Alma and Everett Avenue, which
focuses on the early 20th century,
and the Palo Alto Junior Museum,

an eclectic site that features sci
ence and nature exhibits aimed at
future Stanford scholars.
The lovely Peninsula weather
that typifies graduation week
offers a terrific chance to sample
the area's bountiful parks and pre
serves. Stanford's own foothills
and the nearby Jasper Ridge Bio
logical Preserve are themselves
perfect places for picnic lunches
leisurely strolls and quiet reflec
tion. Off the Farm, Palo Alto's Rin
conada Park — at the center of the
diverse Palo Alto Cultural Center
on Newell and Embarcadero —
and the Bay lands Nature Preserve
are also pleasant.
University Avenue remains the
commercial and culinary heart of
Palo Alto. The avenue and its sur
rounding streets boast a wide
range of boutiques, restaurants
and cafes. Every graduate probably
has his or her favorite spot, so the
advice given here probably won't
matter much. But don't miss the
area's numerous well-accounted
Italian restaurants and trendy
watering holes, like Fanny and
Alexander's, Gordon Biersch and
the Blue Chalk Cafd Meanwhile,
Noah's Bagels offers the closest-to-
New York fare in the Bay Area —
and a welcome breakfast for weary
graduates. Also on University, is

the Stanford Theatre, which strict
ly features cinema classics and will
show the exclusive Bay Area
engagement of "That's Entertain
ment III" starting today.
Downtown Palo Alto is also
home to over 200 stores for those
looking for the ideal — if high
priced — graduation gift. For visi
tors with a little more time on their
hands, or none at all, the Stanford
Shopping Center and its 144 stores
serve all retail purposes.
While Palo Alto's borders are
enough to keep travelers busy, it
shouldn't confine you. Try a tour
of the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center or Sunset Magazine in
Menlo Park. Take a drive down
bucolic Highway 280, called by
some the most beautiful stretch of
road in the country, to Half Moon
Bay for a day of surf and sand. Or
make a quick jaunt to sprawling
San Jose for an old-fashioned
evening of minor-league baseball.
Whatever you choose, Stan
ford's surrounding area promises
natural beauty and unquestioned
style. Douglas Coupland, the
author of the seminal twentysome
thing novel "Generation X", recent
ly called Palo Alto the last outpost
of the California dream. Thankful
ly, it's a dream that any visitor to
Stanford can also get a glimpse of.
