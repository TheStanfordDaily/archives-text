# N'Gai Croal: Exeunt the critic
## Last rites, final thoughts, parting words, no regrets 
### 
Every journalist who is not too stupid
or too full himself to notice what is going
on knows that what he does is morally
indefensible. He is a kind of confidence
man, preying on people's vanity, igno
rance or loneliness, gaining their trust
and betraying them without remorse. . . .
The characters of non-fiction, no less
than those of fiction, derive from the
writer's most idiosyncratic desires and
deepest anxieties; they are what the writ
er wishes he was and worries that he is.
—Janet Malcolm, "The Journalist and
the Murderer"
You know that you haven't got
much of a life when the empty, as
yet-untitled white space of a
Microsoft Word file stares back at you. It
cackles in virtual 44-bit digital stereo
Surround Sound — an unnerving sound
that only you can hear. It grins a sinister
Cheshire cat grin — and each character
typed only adds another razor-sharp
tooth. It dares you to keep writing, writ
ing, writing — all in a furious attempt to
feed that voracious 30-inch space.
It's a battle I've fought at least once a
week, every week, for the last 9 months.

Every time I step into the cage, I have no
idea which one of us is going to make it
out alive. Sometimes I escape; other
times, writers' block, procrastination or a
genuinely bad day wins out. But that is
the existence that a writer chooses. You
rolls the dice and you takes your chances.
If there's nothing else I've learned
about writing, it is that it is always auto
biographical. Every word I put on the
page is an announcement of my likes,
dislikes, strengths and flaws. Even the
words of others — the stock-in-trade of
the interviewer — only serve to further
inscribe your world view.
The mere presence of the interview
subject in the article shouts, "This per
son spoke to me. I have access. I am
somebody," as if perchance their fame
will rub off on me. I rush home to conse
crate that experience at the altar of a
computer screen, typewriter or ballpoint
pen. Each observance is carefully embel
lished; a soft voice becomes a "whisper,"
an attractive face becomes "stunning"
and the odd theatrical gesture becomes
"flamboyance." Like the fabled auteur of
cinematic lore, the presence of the sub
ject is secondary to my need for recogni

tion, to put my imprimatur squarely
upon the story.
The audience, in turn, reads and
often re-reads the story closely, hoping
that every word brings them closer to
the subject. But the apparent trans
parency of the writing, which seems to
give readers direct access to the inter
view subject, is an illusion. Only the
writer is real.
How can ya know where I'm at
when you haven't been where I've been ?
Understand where I'm comin' from?
—Cypress Hill, "How I Could Just Kill a
Man"
There comes a point in a writer's exis
tence where he or she believes that a
subject is no longer necessary; that his
or her autobiography so interesting, it
should be bared for all to see. Call it
hubris, call it unadulterated egotism.
Call it the decision to become a critic.
The life of a critic is even more soli
tary than that of the writer, who at least
has the words, thoughts and deeds of
others as a smokescreen. Like a scav
enger, I spend six days circling the car-

rion of local, national or international
events. Like a vulture, I hover above the
open grave of pop culture, looking for a
succulent morsel of film, television, the
ater, books or music to devour. I don't
rest on the seventh day; instead I savor
my meal. I let it digest as my critical
acids break it down — and wait for the
article to pass out.
Somewhere in that cannibalistic pro
cess lies the potential for something use
ful. The critic tries to look at the subject
of his or her article in a different way
than everyone else. At worst, the critic
only confirms what the reader knew
already. At the very least, the critic
should put into words what the reader
was thinking, but didn't know how to
express. But at his or her best, the critic
takes something familiar and shows the
reader something that they hadn't even
thought about.
For the last nine months, that's what
I've tried to do. Whether the issue is the
depoliticization of the student body, the
infantilization of both students and pro
fessors or the personal cowardice of
many in the Stanford community, every
thing I've written has sought to go

beyond the obvious and grapple with
what lies below. And on those other, less
weighty days, I may have even made you
laugh.
I wouldn't know, though. Most read
ers keep their opinions to themselves —
it's ironic that the critic tries to spark
conversation, but who converses with
the critic. A few do; most are angry,
some wonder if I believe everything that
I write, some hope that no one else
believes what I write and yet others
can't wait to read it. I treasure all of
those reactions, if for no other reason
than that they indicate that someone
takes the time to read my running
monologue.
But in the end, I don't write for
friend or for foe. Because when it's late
at night and the Cheshire cat demon
stares out from the computer screen,
there's only one person whose opinion
matters. And it's his opinion that there
are worse things than the ability to say,
"I wrote exactly what I wanted to write."
Peace.
