# THE 						WEEK THAT WAS: JUNE 1-7, 1994
## Golfers grab first NCAA championship in 41 years 
### Andrew Blachman Staff writer 
Though most Stanford students were
too busy to notice, the Cardinal men's
golf team aced its own Finals last week
end, capturing the 1994 NCAA Champi
onships at the Stonebridge Country Club
in McKinney, Texas.
Behind spectacular individual finishes
from juniors William Yanigisawa and
Notah Begay 111 and timely perfor
mances from all five golfers, the Cardinal
capped the best season in school history
with its first national title since 1953.
"This is the highest honor that a
team can do for a coach," said head coach
Wally Goodwin. "I've had a lot of kicks in
life, but this is the greatest."
The title marks Stanford's fourth of
the year, and first in a non-aquatic sport
in 1993-94. Men's and women's swim
ming and men's water polo earned top
NCAA honors as well.
"This win means a lot to me as a
coach," Goodwin said. "But it means a lot
to the University as well. It's been quite a
year for Stanford."
In claiming its seventh men's golf
national championship, the Cardinal
wrote its way into the record books.
Stanford's overall four-day score of 1,129
— 23 strokes below par — tied the NCAA
Championship team record set by Ari
zona in 1992.
Begay also recorded the best individu

al round of the tournament, a 62 on the
second day which shattered numerous
collegiate marks. He birdied ten holes —
nine with putts of ten feet or more — to
set a new course record at 10-under-par.
The round also marked the best of
Begay's career and the lowest ever
recorded in the NCAA Championships.
Finishing in dramatic fashion, the
Albuquerque, N.M., native, who putts
from either the right or left side depend
ing on the lie, birdied the 18th hole with
a 60-foot putt before a national television
audience.
Begay's stellar performance catapult
ed the Cardinal — which trailed
Arkansas by 13 strokes after the first day
— from eighth place into the lead. Stan
ford never looked back, though the team
leaderboard remained tight throughout.
The Cardinal entered Saturday's final
round tied for first with Georgia Tech.
The Razorbacks, defending champion
Florida and top-ranked Oklahoma State
were just two strokes off the pace in what
promised to be a tight finish.
But a dark horse, Central Regional
champion Texas, gave the Cardinal its
greatest challenge in the final round.
Fueled by individual champion Justin
Leonard, the Longhorns fired a 10-
under-par front nine to move within one
stroke of the lead.
"Texas made a good run," Goodwin
said. "But I've coached a long time and I
know the law of averages and I felt their

run would end."
Stanford proved Goodwin correct.
The Cardinal, behind a career-best per
formance from Yanigisawa, came
through in the clutch. After making the
turn at three-under-par, he birdied the
10th, 11th and 12th holes.
But the 16th hole was Yanigisawa's
best, and solidified Stanford's hold on the
national championship. Sinking a 30-foot
uphill putt which broke six feet to the
left, hit the pin and fell into the cup for
an eagle, Yanigisawa dropped to eight
under-par. It was Stanford's only eagle of
the tournament.
"[That putt] was up and over a rise,"
Yanigisawa said. "It wouldn't have gone
in if it wasn't for the pin."
Yanigisawa, who transferred last sea
son from UC-Irvine, finished the day at
64, by far the best round of his career. He
had recorded one 68 and three 69's in fif
teen tournaments this year.
When the day was over, Stanford, the
seventh seed when the tournament
began, finished four strokes ahead of
Texas. Florida came in third, seven
strokes off the pace. Arkansas and Okla
homa State rounded out the top five.
Yanigisawa's four day total of 277 (72-
71-70-64) was good enough for third
place individually. In a format that drops
a team's high score in each round, he was
the only Stanford player to have his

scores count all four days of the
tournament.
"The only pressure I felt today
was the pressure I put on myself,"
Yanigisawa said. "[This champi
onship] means a lot, as far as my
goals in golf. This is why I trans
ferred from UC-Irvine. To repre
sent Stanford is an honor and I'm
just glad I had the opportunity."
Begay finished three strokes
behind Yanigisawa in a tie for fifth
at 280. But Yanigisawa and Begay
were not the only heroes for the
Cardinal.
Junior Steve Burdick shot two
70's and a 71 in the tournament's
first three rounds to put himself in
tenth place overall, but a disas
trous final round pushed him out
of contention. Casey Martin,also a
junior, turned in a gutsy perfor
mance, battling back from an
abysmal first-round score of 80 to
post scores of 70, 68 and 72 on the
last three days.
"After my first round, I threw
out all individual aspirations,"

Martin said. "Then, it was all for
the team."
The Cardinal also gained a
solid performance from an
unlikely source. Senior Brad Lan
ning, normally the number-five
player, came through when the
team needed him mopt, making
three of his four rounds count in
the scoring.
"When I look back, I'll think of
these guys and coach Goodwin,"
said Lanning, who aspires to a
career in golf. "I'll look back at this
as a great experience. It was a great
way to end my college career."
With its top four players return
ing to join highly-coveted recruit
Tiger Woods, Stanford is already
the favorite to capture next year's
NCAA crown.
"We'll be back," said Goodwin,
referring to next year's champi
onships in Columbus, Ohio.
But, for now, the Cardinal has
earned the right to celebrate.
"This is a dream come true,"
Begay said. "At times, I've imag
ined being the last man on the
course, bringing the team in to win
a national championship. But this
is real. Today the dream came
true."

When the day was over, Stanford, the
seventh seed when the tournament
began, finished four strokes ahead of
Texas. Florida came in third, seven
strokes off the pace. Arkansas and Okla
homa State rounded out the top five.
Yanigisawa's four day total of 277 (72-
71-70-64) was good enough for third
place individually. In a format that drops
a team's high score in each round, he was
the only Stanford player to have his

scores count all four days of the
tournament.
"The only pressure I felt today
was the pressure I put on myself,"
Yanigisawa said. "[This champi
onship] means a lot, as far as my
goals in golf. This is why I trans
ferred from UC-Irvine. To repre
sent Stanford is an honor and I'm
just glad I had the opportunity."
Begay finished three strokes
behind Yanigisawa in a tie for fifth
at 280. But Yanigisawa and Begay
were not the only heroes for the
Cardinal.
Junior Steve Burdick shot two
70's and a 71 in the tournament's
first three rounds to put himself in
tenth place overall, but a disas
trous final round pushed him out
of contention. Casey Martin,also a
junior, turned in a gutsy perfor
mance, battling back from an
abysmal first-round score of 80 to
post scores of 70, 68 and 72 on the
last three days.
"After my first round, I threw
out all individual aspirations,"

Martin said. "Then, it was all for
the team."
The Cardinal also gained a
solid performance from an
unlikely source. Senior Brad Lan
ning, normally the number-five
player, came through when the
team needed him mopt, making
three of his four rounds count in
the scoring.
"When I look back, I'll think of
these guys and coach Goodwin,"
said Lanning, who aspires to a
career in golf. "I'll look back at this
as a great experience. It was a great
way to end my college career."
With its top four players return
ing to join highly-coveted recruit
Tiger Woods, Stanford is already
the favorite to capture next year's
NCAA crown.
"We'll be back," said Goodwin,
referring to next year's champi
onships in Columbus, Ohio.
But, for now, the Cardinal has
earned the right to celebrate.
"This is a dream come true,"
Begay said. "At times, I've imag
ined being the last man on the
course, bringing the team in to win
a national championship. But this
is real. Today the dream came
true."
Though most Stanford students were
too busy to notice, the Cardinal men's
golf team aced its own Finals last week
end, capturing the 1994 NCAA Champi
onships at the Stonebridge Country Club
in McKinney, Texas.
Behind spectacular individual finishes
from juniors William Yanigisawa and
Notah Begay 111 and timely perfor
mances from all five golfers, the Cardinal
capped the best season in school history
with its first national title since 1953.
"This is the highest honor that a
team can do for a coach," said head coach
Wally Goodwin. "I've had a lot of kicks in
life, but this is the greatest."
The title marks Stanford's fourth of
the year, and first in a non-aquatic sport
in 1993-94. Men's and women's swim
ming and men's water polo earned top
NCAA honors as well.
"This win means a lot to me as a
coach," Goodwin said. "But it means a lot
to the University as well. It's been quite a
year for Stanford."
In claiming its seventh men's golf
national championship, the Cardinal
wrote its way into the record books.
Stanford's overall four-day score of 1,129
— 23 strokes below par — tied the NCAA
Championship team record set by Ari
zona in 1992.
Begay also recorded the best individu

al round of the tournament, a 62 on the
second day which shattered numerous
collegiate marks. He birdied ten holes —
nine with putts of ten feet or more — to
set a new course record at 10-under-par.
The round also marked the best of
Begay's career and the lowest ever
recorded in the NCAA Championships.
Finishing in dramatic fashion, the
Albuquerque, N.M., native, who putts
from either the right or left side depend
ing on the lie, birdied the 18th hole with
a 60-foot putt before a national television
audience.
Begay's stellar performance catapult
ed the Cardinal — which trailed
Arkansas by 13 strokes after the first day
— from eighth place into the lead. Stan
ford never looked back, though the team
leaderboard remained tight throughout.
The Cardinal entered Saturday's final
round tied for first with Georgia Tech.
The Razorbacks, defending champion
Florida and top-ranked Oklahoma State
were just two strokes off the pace in what
promised to be a tight finish.
But a dark horse, Central Regional
champion Texas, gave the Cardinal its
greatest challenge in the final round.
Fueled by individual champion Justin
Leonard, the Longhorns fired a 10-
under-par front nine to move within one
stroke of the lead.
"Texas made a good run," Goodwin
said. "But I've coached a long time and I
know the law of averages and I felt their

run would end."
Stanford proved Goodwin correct.
The Cardinal, behind a career-best per
formance from Yanigisawa, came
through in the clutch. After making the
turn at three-under-par, he birdied the
10th, 11th and 12th holes.
But the 16th hole was Yanigisawa's
best, and solidified Stanford's hold on the
national championship. Sinking a 30-foot
uphill putt which broke six feet to the
left, hit the pin and fell into the cup for
an eagle, Yanigisawa dropped to eight
under-par. It was Stanford's only eagle of
the tournament.
"[That putt] was up and over a rise,"
Yanigisawa said. "It wouldn't have gone
in if it wasn't for the pin."
Yanigisawa, who transferred last sea
son from UC-Irvine, finished the day at
64, by far the best round of his career. He
had recorded one 68 and three 69's in fif
teen tournaments this year.
When the day was over, Stanford, the
seventh seed when the tournament
began, finished four strokes ahead of
Texas. Florida came in third, seven
