# Sailors settle for fifth in dinghy races
## 
### Jeremy Stone Staff writer 
A season of progress for the Stanford sailing
team came to an end with a fifth-place finish at
the Dinghy National Championships last week
end in New London, Conn.
After a stellar start Thursday, the team
stood in third place, a mere three points out of
first, as the B-division pair of skipper Scott Sell
ers and crew Britt Johnson led after four races.
On Friday, however, the Cardinal fell out of
the hunt, as the A-division team, led by junior
skipper Charles Meade and freshman crew Leti
tia Yang, struggled to double-digit finishes in
four straight races.
"We basically dug ourselves a quick grave,"

said director of sailing Blake Middleton.
At the halfway point of the regatta, the com
petitors switched from 420's to FJ's, boats more
familiar to the Cardinal sailors. The change
revitalized Stanford, as the Cardinal, which had
dropped as low as sixth place the previous day,
passed top-ranked Old Dominion Saturday to
take fifth in the final standings.
For the second year in a row, Navy took the
title, followed by Tufts, College of Charleston,
and St. Mary's.
"We finished on a strong note," Middleton
said. "We were satisfied with pulling things
together."
Reflecting on the entire season, Middleton
had only kind words for the team and first-year
coach Steve Bourdow. "This is the first time

we've knocked on the door and established our
selves clearly throughout the year as one of the
top teams in the country," Middleton said. "We
weren't just second-tier players."
To that end, the Cardinal won a school
record four All-America awards. Sellers was
named as a skipper, while Meade and senior
Jeremy Mclntyre received honorable mention
from the Intercollegiate Yacht Racing Associa
tion. Sophomore women's skipper Gretchen
Uznis also received honorable mention from the
ICYRA, while Sailing World magazine named
Johnson as All-Star Crew for the second con
secutive year.
"We got more awards this year in one night
than we did the past four or five years," Middle
ton said.
