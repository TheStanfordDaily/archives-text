# Memories: Stanford stands alone in sports spotlight
## 
### Brian Egan Senior staff writer 
It's nice to think of your
school as the grand hoopah of
intercollegiate sports.
Many universities do it.
UCLA calls itself "the best in
collegiate athletics." Arizona
State proudly crowns itself "one
of the great athletic institutions
in the country," while USC
press releases announce how the
school "has long dominated the
world of intercollegiate athlet

ICS.

Stanford is well-imbued in
the name game as well — media
guides suggest that "Home of
Champions" are "the bywords
for the Stanford University Ath
letics Department."
Cardinal teams have done
much to live up to this self-titu
lation, however, in our four
years on the Farm. Stanford
won more NCAA team titles (14)
from 1990-94 than any other
school has ever won over a four
year period. Nine different var
sity teams contributed titles to
this record run.

And to think that four years
ago, all I knew about Stanford
athletics was that the school had
a bad football team.
1990-91: "The game is not
over."
A disheartening Orientation
Week gridiron loss to San Jose
State followed by an even more
disheartening Beach Boys con
cert at Stanford Stadium ful
filled my worst expectations. We
freshmen were doomed to four
years of athletic mediocrity and
bad California music.
Things, however, began to
turn around quickly. For one, I
discovered that there other ath
letic events to follow on this
campus besides football.
On the soccer field, freshman
Sarah Rafanelli led the women's
team in scoring, teaming with
fellow All-American Julie Foudy
in leading Stanford to its first
ever NCAA bid. Rafanelli, who
graduates this weekend, led the
Cardinal to an obscene 67-10-3
record over her four years on the
Farm.
Success was nothing new to
the women's tennis team. While
their intercollegiate-record 76-
match winning streak ended in a
midseason loss to Florida, the
squad bounced back to record its
sixth-straight NCAA champi
onship.
The men's basketball team
won a championship in its own
right, a National Invitation
Tournament crown that capped
one of the program's most suc
cessful seasons ever.
Oh yeah, and then there was
that football team. The team
that, with a 1-3 record, broke
the heart of this lifetime Notre
Dame fan with its 36-31 upset of
the top-ranked Irish on the
road.
I laughed the first time I
heard that the Stanford-Califor
nia season-ending matchup was
referred to as "Big Game." I
snickered at the Big Game Bon
fire, Gaieties and the Axe Com
mittee.
After witnessing Big Game
1990, I no longer laugh. The
journey to Berkeley was trau
matic in itself — it was war out
there, man. I swore indignantly
as Cal fans pelted Cardinal play
ers with fruit. I cringed as the

Tree was attacked by more Cal
fans. This was no game. This
was Cal, and this was serious.
Remember how Stanford,
down 25-18 on its own 13-yard
line with less than two minutes
remaining in the game, mounted
an improbable drive, capped by a
Jason Palumbis touchdown pass
to Ed McCaffrey with 12 sec
onds left on the clock?
And how a valiant Cardinal
attempt at victory fell short
when a Palumbis two-point con
version attempt was intercepted
in the end zone?
And how a Berkeley turnover,
a delay-of-game penalty
assessed to a Neanderthalic Cal
student section for charging the
field early and an unnecessary
roughness penalty charged to
Neanderthalic Cal nose guard
John Belli, turned the game in
the Cardinal's favor?
And how a John Hopkins field
goal gave Stanford a 27-25 win
and undisputed control of the
Axe?
That Big Game stuff was bet

ter than sex.
1991-92: Titles, Titles, Titles.
It was a great year to be a
Cardinal booster. Swimmers
Summer Sanders and Jeff Rouse
led Stanford athletes to a whop
ping 19 medals at the 1992 Sum
mer Olympics, capping off a sea
son which saw Stanford amass a
record-tying five NCAA titles.
Rouse and Sanders opened up
the Cardinal's title run over
Spring Break by leading the
men's and women's swimming
teams to their respective NCAA
titles.
Texas finished a distant sec
ond in both competitions.
A week later, the Cardinal
women's basketball team cap
tured its second national cham
pionship in three years, crush
ing Western Kentucky 78-62
after defeating archrival Vir
ginia in the semifinals.
In gymnastics, the women's
first-ever NCAA berth was lost
in the celebration surrounding
the men's first-ever NCAA title.

While Pacific 10 Conference
Gymnast of the Year Jair Lynch
and senior Tim Ryan led the
Cardinal in all-around competi
tion, it was junior Jeff Bender's
"Bender Back" on the high bar
that clinched the win.
Stanford won perhaps its
most unlikely title on the tennis
courts. The women's six-year
title run came to a halt in a 5-3
semifinal loss to Texas.
The men, however, fought
back from season-ending losses
to USC and UCLA to capture
their fifth title in six years. Said
coach Dick Gould, "We're not
the most talented team in the
country, but we're pretty damn
good."
Senior Alex O'Brien captured
the Triple Crown of NCAA Ten
nis, winning the team title along
with the individual singles and
doubles championships.
In winning five team titles,
Stanford tied an NCAA record

by UCLA in the 1981-82 season.
To top it off, the football team recovered
from a 1-3 start, putting together seven
straight wins and its first bowl appearance
in six years after redshirt freshman Steve
Stenstrom stepped into the starting quarter
back job midway through the season.
The most successful Cal team in over half
a century proved no match for the Cardinal,
folding 41-21 in an uneventful, but satisfac
tory Big Game.
All in all, it wasn't a bad greeting for new
Director of Athletics Ted Leland, who took
the job at the beginning of the year.
1992-93: Walsh time, and it's about
time
On television, they referred to him as "the
Genius."
On campus, he was treated as a god.
Longtime San Francisco 49er coach Bill
Walsh ended his brief retirement to return
to the Farm, where he previously led Stan
ford to two bowl appearances in the late
1970'5.
Walsh did nothing to lessen his immortal
status, guiding the Cardinal to 10 wins, a
No. 9 national ranking and another convinc
ing Big Game win over Cal.
If the football team won Big Game, the
women's volleyball team faced the Big
Hump against UCLA in the NCAA finals.
Stanford lost to the Bruins twice during the
regular season, and had never beaten UCLA
in the NCAA Tournament.
Before the finals, CBS commentators
called the Bruins, who were riding a 43-
game win streak, "invincible."
So much for that theory — the Cardinal
beat UCLA in four games, capturing its first
NCAA title after 11 years of frustration.
It was a year of title defenses — both
swimming teams defended their NCAA
crowns, as did the men's gymnastics team.
It was also a year of promised equity. The
Department of Athletics announced the
implementation of three new women's varsi
ty sports — lacrosse, synchronized swim

ming and water polo — in order to bring the
school closer to federal Title IX gender equi
ty compliance.
Two decades ago, women's varsity sports
at Stanford did not exist. By 1996, the
women's program will boast 17 teams and
over 100 athletic scholarships. It's come a
long way, baby.
1993-94: A Year of Near Misses?
It's tough to justify a year in which a
school wins four titles as one of "near

misses," but. . .
Let's start with the positives. It's been a
great year for Cardinal water sports — the
men's and women's swimming teams both
coasted to their third consecutive national
championships. The water polo team fought
back from a frustrating overtime loss to Cal
in last year's championship game to defeat
USC for the crown in November.
Just days ago, the men's golf team won its
first title since 1953 with a four-stroke victo
ry over Texas. Notah Begay 111 (no relation

to John-Edward, Cain III) shot an NCAA
record 62 (that's for 18 holes) in the second
round, leading the Cardinal to victory.
After one-year absences from postseason
play, both the men's basketball and base
ball teams rediscovered their winning
forms. Senior Brent Williams led the hoop
sters to an NIT berth, while Academic All-
American Nate Olmstead carried the Cardi
nal nine to the NCAA regionals with a bat
ting average that hovered in the .400 range
all season.
But just think about what might have
been. The women's soccer team rode a No. 2
national ranking to the NCAA semifinals,
where they lost a game to overmatched
George Mason on penalty kicks.
Both tennis teams lost championship
round matches in their bids to recapture
NCAA titles. The women lost in the finals to
Georgia, while a men's team led by four
seniors — Michael Flanagan, Chris Cocotos,
Vimal Patel and Rob Devens — fell to USC
in the NCAA finals.
In perhaps the biggest insult of the year,
the No. 2 men's volleyball team was snubbed
by the NCAA Selection Committee in its
quest for a Final Four wild-card berth.
Freshman setter Stewart Chong summed
up the sentiments of the squad best: "This
sucks."
What really sucked was a 46-17 Big Game
loss to Cal that gave the Bears back their
stupid Axe after six years of Stanford owner
ship. "It was a disastrous day," quipped
Walsh.
But Walsh's words can't speak for our
entire four years here. When men's golf
coach Wally Goodwin called 1993-94 "quite a
year for Stanford," he could well have been
referring to our entire four-year careers.
Fourteen team titles, dozens of individual
titles, triumph and controversies have
abounded in the Department of Athletics
during our four years at Stanford.
In the end, it's not the team or individu
al titles that measure Stanford success, it's
the memories the program leaves its fol
lowers.
Go Cardinal!
