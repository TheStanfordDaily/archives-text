# Rafanelli creates a colorful legacy
## 
### Greg Collins Staff writer 
All great players have some signature char
acteristic, be it a sky-hook, a stiff-arm or a tow
ering home run. For women's soccer standout
Sarah Rafanelli, it is a red ribbon.
Over the past four years, Rafanelli and her
ribbon have danced across Stanford's Maloney
Field, dazzling fans and sending opposing
defenders into fits as they watch a red blur blaze
past them on its way to scoring yet another goal.
"My mom loves when I wear ribbons,"
Rafanelli said. "When I got into Stanford, she
gave me tons of red ribbons. It started the first
game my freshman year, and it's become a
superstition."
Looking back on her soccer history, it would
not seem like the All-American forward was
destined to become the world-class player she is
today. Starting on an under-10 boys' team
coached by her father, a Stanford graduate,
because there were no girls' teams, Rafanelli
can't trace back to the turning point in picking
soccer over numerous other activities.
"All my sisters and I started when we were
all about eight years old, just because it was
offered in our community along with other
sports," she said. "I don't know why I ended up
sticking with soccer rather than volleyball or
tennis, but I'm glad I did because I love it.'"
Growing up in Piedmont, Calif., Rafanelli
attended the College Preparatory School, a pri
vate high school of about 260 students. Unlike
most other schools, CPS's soccer season was in
spring, which led to very low-key high school
seasons.
"You played all your games and then that
was it," Rafanelli said. "There weren't any
championships. It was more of a social thing
rather than a serious one."
Making up for a less competitive high-school
career with extensive national experience pre
pared Rafanelli for the rigors of the more phys

ical college game. A member of the Under-19
National Team in high school, she is now a
member of the defending World Champion U.S.
National Team.
"It's incredible playing in international tour
naments," she said. "I've developed a strong
sense of patriotism when playing in foreign
countries. There's really nothing more incredi
ble then standing on the field and hearing your
national anthem being played."
Although not a starter on the national team,
Rafanelli is usually one of the first players off
the bench. As one of the younger players on the
team, she is aware of the amount of learning
necessary to excel at the World Cup level.
"Every training session I feel like I develop
more and more," Rafanelli said. "I think espe
cially this year, I've been able to bring a lot of
that back to my college game. I'm becoming
more of a complete player, and I think my expe
rience with the national team has contributed
to that."
Nevertheless, Rafanelli still sees several defi
ciencies in her playing ability. Citing a lack of a
clean technical game, she knows that her speed
has allowed her to get away with not developing
her other skills. However, as she moves into
international competition, she knows she must
flesh out her game.
"I play with a lot of passion, which leads to
aggression," she said. "When I get out there, I
go after it. I'm physical and I want to win. I try
to do what it takes to get the job done. That
helps me a lot, especially with my technical dif
ficulties."
Head coach lan Sawyers, who has watched
Rafanelli develop over the past three years, sees
her as a tremendous example for the team.
"She's great because she doesn't demand
preferential treatment," Sawyers said. "She
doesn't put herself on a pedestal."
A self-proclaimed leader by example, Rafanel
li remains fairly quiet on the field while retain
ing an intense attitude. Off the field, a more

vocal, playful Rafanelli emerges. "I have that
Italian chatting thing — I love to talk," she said.
As the offensive trigger to an explosive
team, Rafanelli's main role is to score goals —
something at which she is very accomplished.
Along with freshman forward Erin Martin,
the two high-scoring forwards "scheme
together to figure out ways to score," Rafanel
li said jokingly.
Amassing 59 goals and 34 assists by late last
season, her 152 total points placed her first on
the all-time Stanford scoring list. Her 20 goals
in 1993 were also a Cardinal record, breaking
her old mark of 16, which she set during the
1991 season. Like other star players, Rafanelli's
play tends to lift the team.
"I think everybody's adrenalin starts going
when Raf is on," Carmel Murphy said. "She just
gets everyone else going."
Despite her lofty achievements, Rafanelli is
content with the opportunity to experience
everything soccer has given her the chance to
accomplish.
"I like the competitive arena," Rafanelli said.
"I think I thrive on that. Any type of athletics is
a way to express your emotion, and it's a great
release to step on the field and leave everything
there."
Soccer has also given Rafanelli exposure to
foreign countries with various national teams.
Rafanelli still hopes to be able to live abroad
after college and is excited by the chance to
immerse herself in a foreign culture.
"If I don't try to go to Med School right after
I graduate," Rafanelli said, "I will have a couple
of years in which I have nothing formal to do, so
I may try to live overseas then."
Although Rafanelli and the red ribbon will
be leaving Stanford at the end of this year,
her soccer career is far from over. As a mem
ber of the U.S. National Team, she will play
in the 1995 World Cup in Sweden and the
1996 Summer Olympics, to be held in
Atlanta, Ga.

pared Rafanelli for the rigors of the more phys

ical college game. A member of the Under-19
National Team in high school, she is now a
member of the defending World Champion U.S.
National Team.
"It's incredible playing in international tour
naments," she said. "I've developed a strong
sense of patriotism when playing in foreign
countries. There's really nothing more incredi
ble then standing on the field and hearing your
national anthem being played."
Although not a starter on the national team,
Rafanelli is usually one of the first players off
the bench. As one of the younger players on the
team, she is aware of the amount of learning
necessary to excel at the World Cup level.
"Every training session I feel like I develop
more and more," Rafanelli said. "I think espe
cially this year, I've been able to bring a lot of
that back to my college game. I'm becoming
more of a complete player, and I think my expe
rience with the national team has contributed
to that."
Nevertheless, Rafanelli still sees several defi
ciencies in her playing ability. Citing a lack of a
clean technical game, she knows that her speed
has allowed her to get away with not developing
her other skills. However, as she moves into
international competition, she knows she must
flesh out her game.
"I play with a lot of passion, which leads to
aggression," she said. "When I get out there, I
go after it. I'm physical and I want to win. I try
to do what it takes to get the job done. That
helps me a lot, especially with my technical dif
ficulties."
Head coach lan Sawyers, who has watched
Rafanelli develop over the past three years, sees
her as a tremendous example for the team.
"She's great because she doesn't demand
preferential treatment," Sawyers said. "She
doesn't put herself on a pedestal."
A self-proclaimed leader by example, Rafanel
li remains fairly quiet on the field while retain
ing an intense attitude. Off the field, a more

vocal, playful Rafanelli emerges. "I have that
Italian chatting thing — I love to talk," she said.
As the offensive trigger to an explosive
team, Rafanelli's main role is to score goals —
something at which she is very accomplished.
Along with freshman forward Erin Martin,
the two high-scoring forwards "scheme
together to figure out ways to score," Rafanel
li said jokingly.
Amassing 59 goals and 34 assists by late last
season, her 152 total points placed her first on
the all-time Stanford scoring list. Her 20 goals
in 1993 were also a Cardinal record, breaking
her old mark of 16, which she set during the
1991 season. Like other star players, Rafanelli's
play tends to lift the team.
"I think everybody's adrenalin starts going
when Raf is on," Carmel Murphy said. "She just
gets everyone else going."
Despite her lofty achievements, Rafanelli is
content with the opportunity to experience
everything soccer has given her the chance to
accomplish.
"I like the competitive arena," Rafanelli said.
"I think I thrive on that. Any type of athletics is
a way to express your emotion, and it's a great
release to step on the field and leave everything
there."
Soccer has also given Rafanelli exposure to
foreign countries with various national teams.
Rafanelli still hopes to be able to live abroad
after college and is excited by the chance to
immerse herself in a foreign culture.
"If I don't try to go to Med School right after
I graduate," Rafanelli said, "I will have a couple
of years in which I have nothing formal to do, so
I may try to live overseas then."
Although Rafanelli and the red ribbon will
be leaving Stanford at the end of this year,
her soccer career is far from over. As a mem
ber of the U.S. National Team, she will play
in the 1995 World Cup in Sweden and the
1996 Summer Olympics, to be held in
Atlanta, Ga.

Sarah Rafanelli leaves Cardinal soccer fans smiling after setting a
new school scoring record and leading Stanford to its first-ever
Final Four berth.
All great players have some signature char
acteristic, be it a sky-hook, a stiff-arm or a tow
ering home run. For women's soccer standout
Sarah Rafanelli, it is a red ribbon.
Over the past four years, Rafanelli and her
ribbon have danced across Stanford's Maloney
Field, dazzling fans and sending opposing
defenders into fits as they watch a red blur blaze
past them on its way to scoring yet another goal.
"My mom loves when I wear ribbons,"
Rafanelli said. "When I got into Stanford, she
gave me tons of red ribbons. It started the first
game my freshman year, and it's become a
superstition."
Looking back on her soccer history, it would
not seem like the All-American forward was
destined to become the world-class player she is
today. Starting on an under-10 boys' team
coached by her father, a Stanford graduate,
because there were no girls' teams, Rafanelli
can't trace back to the turning point in picking
soccer over numerous other activities.
"All my sisters and I started when we were
all about eight years old, just because it was
offered in our community along with other
sports," she said. "I don't know why I ended up
sticking with soccer rather than volleyball or
tennis, but I'm glad I did because I love it.'"
Growing up in Piedmont, Calif., Rafanelli
attended the College Preparatory School, a pri
vate high school of about 260 students. Unlike
most other schools, CPS's soccer season was in
spring, which led to very low-key high school
seasons.
"You played all your games and then that
was it," Rafanelli said. "There weren't any
championships. It was more of a social thing
rather than a serious one."
Making up for a less competitive high-school
career with extensive national experience pre
pared Rafanelli for the rigors of the more phys

ical college game. A member of the Under-19
National Team in high school, she is now a
member of the defending World Champion U.S.
National Team.
