# Bercutt masters art of goaltending

What does a person do if he likes water polo
but dislikes swimming?
Stanford senior Larry Bercutt faced this
situation and found a solution. He solved his
problem by becoming a goalie. Since then,
Bercutt has been a thorn in the side of great
shooters at all levels of play.
"I first saw water polo in P.E. class in
junior high," Bercutt said. "I thought it looked
pretty cool. We had a new coach (current U.S.
National Team coach Rich Corso) who was
intense. I went out for the team and really
loved it."
It didn't take long for Bercutt, who hails
from Beverly Hills, Calif., to find his place in
the pool — between the crossbars, minding
the net.
"I didn't really like to swim," he said. "I
could tread water well, but I just didn't like to
swim. I really liked playing goalie because I
could watch things unfold in front of me. I like
the pressure of playing the goalie position."
He felt the pressure on numerous occasions
last season, as the Cardinal was involved in 13
games decided by one or two goals, including
seven of its last eight matches.
"I'd rather just win and not have them be
so close," Bercutt said. "But that's what you

play for, to be in the close games and make the
key block. The close games make them all
worthwhile."
Coach Dante Dettamanti has been
impressed many times by the clutch play of his
four-year starting goaltender.
"Larry has had some tremendous saves,"
Dettamanti said. "He's been our starter since
his first game here at Stanford. When he's
psyched and on top of his game, he's the best
in the country."
Few coaches or players can argue with that
statement, especially last year, as Bercutt
amassed a career-high 211 saves heading into
the final three matches of his collegiate career.
He reached double figures in saves 11 times
last season, including a career-best 16 in a 5-4
victory over Pacific.
While Bercutt has had great success in the
pool, he is also an outstanding student. Last
year he was named Block "S" Junior Athlete
of the Year at Stanford as well as to the All
Pacific 10 Conference Academic First Team.
"He's done so well on the team and aca
demically," Dettamanti said. "He's our second
Rhodes Scholar candidate in the past three
years and he's been nominated for the
NCAA's post-graduate scholarship award."
Dettamanti attibutes much of Bercutt's
athletic success to his ability to read the
progress of the front-court play in front of

him.
"The pattern with Larry is, we'll be playing
good defense as a team, then there's a mix-up
on coverage or switches," he said. "Larry
anticipates and positions himself according to
where shots may be coming from. Even when
the shooter is wide open in front of the goal, he
often makes the one-on-one saves. His job is to
make the normal saves then make a couple of
great saves."
One of the most tremendous saves of
Bercutt's collegiate career sparked perhaps
the most emotional rallies in Stanford history.
In the 1992 NCAA championship match
against rival California, Stanford fell behind
by six goals just two minutes into the third
quarter.
The Cardinal mounted a comeback and
pulled to within three with about three min
utes remaining in the contest, when Cal's Dirk
Zeien was awarded a penalty shot.
"When the referee blew his whistle and
called the four-meter, people got up to leave,"
Dettamanti said. "It would have put Cal up by
four with three minutes left. But Larry
blocked the shot, we went down and scored
and were only down by two."
"Before the game, (Chris) Dorst, a former
Stanford goalie who was announcing the

game, came up to me and told
me that Dirk always shoots
four-meters to the lower right,"
Bercutt said. "I waited until
just before he released the ball
and dove to the lower right. I
got two hands on it and con
trolled it."
After the block, even the
thwarted shooter appreciated the
exchange.
"Dirk just sat and smiled at
Larry," Cardinal assistant coach
Ben Quittner said. "He acknowl
edged the good save."
Although the Cardinal even
tually fell to the Golden Bears 12-
11 in sudden-death overtime,
Bercutt lists the furious come
back and the penalty shot rejec
tion among his best memories of
his career.
Two years earlier, Bercutt had
been in almost the same situa
tion, playing in the national
championship game as a fresh
man. Stanford was defeated by
Cal in that game as well.

Driven by his quest to claim
the NCAA trophy in his final sea
son, Bercutt led the top-ranked
Cardinal to a blistering 15-1
start. The two-time All-American
was named Outstanding Player
at the USC Tournament in
September and Outstanding
Goalie at the NorCal Tourna
ment.
"At the beginning of the sea
son, he was practically walking
on water," Dettamanti said. "He
lost a little intensity in the middle
of the season, but it's hard for
goalies. He's by himself, if he has
a bad game, there's no one to
help. Larry must be psyched and
at the top of his game for every
game."
After finishing the regular sea
son at 21-6, Bercutt looked for
ward to the NCAAs and a final
chance to contend for the elusive
title.
"I'm going to semi-retire from
water polo in a week," Bercutt
said in November. "I'm not
going to play for the national
team, but I may show up for
spring and summer club tourna
ments. Everything will be lower
key."

"I'd rather just win and not have them be
so close," Bercutt said. "But that's what you

play for, to be in the close games and make the
key block. The close games make them all
worthwhile."
Coach Dante Dettamanti has been
impressed many times by the clutch play of his
four-year starting goaltender.
"Larry has had some tremendous saves,"
Dettamanti said. "He's been our starter since
his first game here at Stanford. When he's
psyched and on top of his game, he's the best
in the country."
Few coaches or players can argue with that
statement, especially last year, as Bercutt
amassed a career-high 211 saves heading into
the final three matches of his collegiate career.
He reached double figures in saves 11 times
last season, including a career-best 16 in a 5-4
victory over Pacific.
While Bercutt has had great success in the
pool, he is also an outstanding student. Last
year he was named Block "S" Junior Athlete
of the Year at Stanford as well as to the All
Pacific 10 Conference Academic First Team.
"He's done so well on the team and aca
demically," Dettamanti said. "He's our second
Rhodes Scholar candidate in the past three
years and he's been nominated for the
NCAA's post-graduate scholarship award."
Dettamanti attibutes much of Bercutt's
athletic success to his ability to read the
progress of the front-court play in front of

him.
"The pattern with Larry is, we'll be playing
good defense as a team, then there's a mix-up
on coverage or switches," he said. "Larry
anticipates and positions himself according to
where shots may be coming from. Even when
the shooter is wide open in front of the goal, he
often makes the one-on-one saves. His job is to
make the normal saves then make a couple of
great saves."
One of the most tremendous saves of
Bercutt's collegiate career sparked perhaps
the most emotional rallies in Stanford history.
In the 1992 NCAA championship match
against rival California, Stanford fell behind
by six goals just two minutes into the third
quarter.
The Cardinal mounted a comeback and
pulled to within three with about three min
utes remaining in the contest, when Cal's Dirk
Zeien was awarded a penalty shot.
"When the referee blew his whistle and
called the four-meter, people got up to leave,"
Dettamanti said. "It would have put Cal up by
four with three minutes left. But Larry
blocked the shot, we went down and scored
and were only down by two."
"Before the game, (Chris) Dorst, a former
Stanford goalie who was announcing the

game, came up to me and told
me that Dirk always shoots
four-meters to the lower right,"
Bercutt said. "I waited until
just before he released the ball
and dove to the lower right. I
got two hands on it and con
trolled it."
After the block, even the
thwarted shooter appreciated the
exchange.
"Dirk just sat and smiled at
Larry," Cardinal assistant coach
Ben Quittner said. "He acknowl
edged the good save."
Although the Cardinal even
tually fell to the Golden Bears 12-
11 in sudden-death overtime,
Bercutt lists the furious come
back and the penalty shot rejec
tion among his best memories of
his career.
Two years earlier, Bercutt had
been in almost the same situa
tion, playing in the national
championship game as a fresh
man. Stanford was defeated by
Cal in that game as well.

Driven by his quest to claim
the NCAA trophy in his final sea
son, Bercutt led the top-ranked
Cardinal to a blistering 15-1
start. The two-time All-American
was named Outstanding Player
at the USC Tournament in
September and Outstanding
Goalie at the NorCal Tourna
ment.
"At the beginning of the sea
son, he was practically walking
on water," Dettamanti said. "He
lost a little intensity in the middle
of the season, but it's hard for
goalies. He's by himself, if he has
a bad game, there's no one to
help. Larry must be psyched and
at the top of his game for every
game."
After finishing the regular sea
son at 21-6, Bercutt looked for
ward to the NCAAs and a final
chance to contend for the elusive
title.
"I'm going to semi-retire from
water polo in a week," Bercutt
said in November. "I'm not
going to play for the national
team, but I may show up for
spring and summer club tourna
ments. Everything will be lower
key."
What does a person do if he likes water polo
but dislikes swimming?
Stanford senior Larry Bercutt faced this
situation and found a solution. He solved his
problem by becoming a goalie. Since then,
Bercutt has been a thorn in the side of great
shooters at all levels of play.
"I first saw water polo in P.E. class in
junior high," Bercutt said. "I thought it looked
pretty cool. We had a new coach (current U.S.
National Team coach Rich Corso) who was
intense. I went out for the team and really
loved it."
It didn't take long for Bercutt, who hails
from Beverly Hills, Calif., to find his place in
the pool — between the crossbars, minding
the net.
"I didn't really like to swim," he said. "I
could tread water well, but I just didn't like to
swim. I really liked playing goalie because I
could watch things unfold in front of me. I like
the pressure of playing the goalie position."
He felt the pressure on numerous occasions
last season, as the Cardinal was involved in 13
games decided by one or two goals, including
seven of its last eight matches.
"I'd rather just win and not have them be
so close," Bercutt said. "But that's what you

play for, to be in the close games and make the
key block. The close games make them all
worthwhile."
