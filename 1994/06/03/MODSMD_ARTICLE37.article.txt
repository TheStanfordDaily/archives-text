# Hedgpeth joins women's hoops legends

### Andy Eiser Senior staff writer 
One minute, 45 seconds showed on the clock when
the whistle blew. An official shouted "Red!" and sig
naled the numbers "2" and "5" to the Maples Pavilion
scorer's table.
Several fouls and desperate three-point field goal
attempts later, the clock would run out and Purdue's
82-65 victory over the Cardinal women's basketball
team in the NCAA Western Regional final would offi
cially go down in the books. But it would not matter
then; this moment is what mattered.
"Foul is on Christy Hedgpeth, her fifth personal,"
the public-address announcer bellowed.
A few groans of disapproval echoed through the
gym, as frustration overcame the Stanford faithful
who had all but punched their tickets to the Final
Four in Richmond, Va. But then the emotional roller
coaster took a bittersweet turn as the senior guard
made her way to the Cardinal bench, and the groans
rapidly gave way to applause and then to a thunder
ous standing ovation.
The game, the season, the career — all of it was
drawing to a close for Hedgpeth, always to be counted
on as No. 25. The standing ovation was appropriate,
but it was not supposed to end this way.
The ending could have been more like the 1990-91
season, Hedgpeth's freshman year out of
Thomasville, N.C., when the Cardinal reached the
Final Four despite key injuries to center Trisha
Stevens and forward Julie Zeilstra.
Playing mostly in a reserve role behind senior All-
American Sonja Henningand sophomore Molly Good
enbour, Hedgpeth scored an average of 7.8 points per
game but took in even more points from her mentors.

While that Cardinal team suffered a semifinal loss
to Tennessee, Hedgpeth had tasted the big time and
wanted more. But she realized even at that stage
how difficult returning to championship play would
be.
"Anyone who plays at Stanford steps into the tra
dition. It was a learning experience, and I felt the pres
sure because every team we played had a goal of beat
ing Stanford," Hedgpeth said.
The ending should have been more like the 1991-
92 season, Hedgpeth's sophomore year, when the Car
dinal snuck up on the NCAA field, upset No. 1 Vir
ginia in the semifinals and grabbed its second nation
al championship in three years.
Like the Stanford squad of two years ago, this
year's edition entered the season out of the top five in
the national polls, a rare occurrence since head coach
Tara VanDerveer revamped the program in 1985. But
both teams had the right mix of relative unanimity
and star-quality athletes that made for a unique kind
of bonding.
"Our team's chemistry this year felt so much like
that year, it was almost eerie," Hedgpeth said. "It
was a great atmosphere, a great environment."
Individually, Hedgpeth's senior statistics also bear
significant resemblance to her sophomore numbers —
career-bests in scoring (13.8 ppg) and field goal shoot
ing percentage (.507) now against 13.3 and .492 then,
a 3.2 rebounding average now against a 3.6 then and
73 total assists in both seasons.
The comparison is enhanced further when looking
at the Cardinal's late-season surges in both years, and
at Hedgpeth's contributions to those runs. Both times
Stanford won 14 of its final 15 games, the only differ
ence being when the loss came during the streak.
In '91-'92, Hedgpeth improved on her numbers

throughout the streak, eventually scoring 21 points a
regional final win over USC and 17 in the national
title contest against Western Kentucky. This season
she averaged over 15 points a game in Pacific 10 Con
ference play, earning herself First Team All Pac-10
honors, and 21 apiece in the Cardinal's three tourna
ment victories.
"I didn't feel things went my way early this year,
but I meshed together with the team and felt more
confident playing with them by the end," Hedgpeth
said.
Of course, as with Stanford's previous success,
none of the Cardinal's rise to a second-place Pac-10
finish and near-miss on Hedgpeth's third Final Four
in four years would have been possible without Van-
Derveer.
"I feel fortunate to have played for her. She taught
me a lot and is always pushing women to play basket
ball to their potential," Hedgpeth said.
In fact, despite this year's disappointing finish,
Hedgpeth feels her team played to its potential this
season and wants to be in town for what she feels will
be even greater accomplishments next. year.
Meanwhile, the two-time Pac-10 All-Academic
First Team member will cherish the memories of her
playing career and look to put the psychology degree
she has earned to use.
So maybe the ending wasn't so bad after all. The
leading character walks away safely and with no
regrets, and the show goes on. But red jersey No. 25
will never again be worn by Hedgpeth, and she sum
marized the effect of her departure on the Stanford
program she leaves behind.
"The team will never be the same again," Hedg
peth said.
No, it certainly will not.

One minute, 45 seconds showed on the clock when
the whistle blew. An official shouted "Red!" and sig
naled the numbers "2" and "5" to the Maples Pavilion
scorer's table.
Several fouls and desperate three-point field goal
attempts later, the clock would run out and Purdue's
82-65 victory over the Cardinal women's basketball
team in the NCAA Western Regional final would offi
cially go down in the books. But it would not matter
then; this moment is what mattered.
"Foul is on Christy Hedgpeth, her fifth personal,"
the public-address announcer bellowed.
A few groans of disapproval echoed through the
gym, as frustration overcame the Stanford faithful
who had all but punched their tickets to the Final
Four in Richmond, Va. But then the emotional roller
coaster took a bittersweet turn as the senior guard
made her way to the Cardinal bench, and the groans
rapidly gave way to applause and then to a thunder
ous standing ovation.
The game, the season, the career — all of it was
drawing to a close for Hedgpeth, always to be counted
on as No. 25. The standing ovation was appropriate,
but it was not supposed to end this way.
The ending could have been more like the 1990-91
season, Hedgpeth's freshman year out of
Thomasville, N.C., when the Cardinal reached the
Final Four despite key injuries to center Trisha
Stevens and forward Julie Zeilstra.
Playing mostly in a reserve role behind senior All-
American Sonja Henningand sophomore Molly Good
enbour, Hedgpeth scored an average of 7.8 points per
game but took in even more points from her mentors.

While that Cardinal team suffered a semifinal loss
to Tennessee, Hedgpeth had tasted the big time and
wanted more. But she realized even at that stage
how difficult returning to championship play would
be.
"Anyone who plays at Stanford steps into the tra
dition. It was a learning experience, and I felt the pres
sure because every team we played had a goal of beat
ing Stanford," Hedgpeth said.
The ending should have been more like the 1991-
92 season, Hedgpeth's sophomore year, when the Car
dinal snuck up on the NCAA field, upset No. 1 Vir
ginia in the semifinals and grabbed its second nation
al championship in three years.
Like the Stanford squad of two years ago, this
year's edition entered the season out of the top five in
the national polls, a rare occurrence since head coach
Tara VanDerveer revamped the program in 1985. But
both teams had the right mix of relative unanimity
and star-quality athletes that made for a unique kind
of bonding.
"Our team's chemistry this year felt so much like
that year, it was almost eerie," Hedgpeth said. "It
was a great atmosphere, a great environment."
Individually, Hedgpeth's senior statistics also bear
significant resemblance to her sophomore numbers —
career-bests in scoring (13.8 ppg) and field goal shoot
ing percentage (.507) now against 13.3 and .492 then,
a 3.2 rebounding average now against a 3.6 then and
73 total assists in both seasons.
The comparison is enhanced further when looking
at the Cardinal's late-season surges in both years, and
at Hedgpeth's contributions to those runs. Both times
Stanford won 14 of its final 15 games, the only differ
ence being when the loss came during the streak.
In '91-'92, Hedgpeth improved on her numbers

throughout the streak, eventually scoring 21 points a
regional final win over USC and 17 in the national
title contest against Western Kentucky. This season
she averaged over 15 points a game in Pacific 10 Con
ference play, earning herself First Team All Pac-10
honors, and 21 apiece in the Cardinal's three tourna
ment victories.
"I didn't feel things went my way early this year,
but I meshed together with the team and felt more
confident playing with them by the end," Hedgpeth
said.
Of course, as with Stanford's previous success,
none of the Cardinal's rise to a second-place Pac-10
finish and near-miss on Hedgpeth's third Final Four
in four years would have been possible without Van-
Derveer.
"I feel fortunate to have played for her. She taught
me a lot and is always pushing women to play basket
ball to their potential," Hedgpeth said.
In fact, despite this year's disappointing finish,
Hedgpeth feels her team played to its potential this
season and wants to be in town for what she feels will
be even greater accomplishments next. year.
Meanwhile, the two-time Pac-10 All-Academic
First Team member will cherish the memories of her
playing career and look to put the psychology degree
she has earned to use.
So maybe the ending wasn't so bad after all. The
leading character walks away safely and with no
regrets, and the show goes on. But red jersey No. 25
will never again be worn by Hedgpeth, and she sum
marized the effect of her departure on the Stanford
program she leaves behind.
"The team will never be the same again," Hedg
peth said.
No, it certainly will not.
