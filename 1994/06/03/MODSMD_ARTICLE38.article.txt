### Kyle Utsumi Staff writer 
In 1990, Stanford men's swimming coach Skip
Kenney struck gold. After winning a ninth consecu
tive Pacific 10 Conference title and finishing third at
NCAAs, Kenney hit recruiting paydirt, signing an
incredible class of elite swimmers to join his Cardinal
squad.
Assembling athletes from around the country,
Kenney knew there were great things to come. Three
of this year's seniors, Tyler Mayfield, Derek Weath
erford and Trip Zedlitz, comprise a major force
behind the Cardinal's drive toward a third consecu
tive national championship.
Through their four years together at Stanford,
the Class of '94 has not disappointed. As freshmen,
the class experienced a rocky dual meet season, post
ing a record of 2-6 before winning Pac-lOs and grab
bing a runner-up finish at NCAAs.
Since that time, this year's seniors enjoyed near
perfection: 23-1 in dual competition, three Pac-10
titles and three national championship rings.
"When we were seniors in high school, we were
talking to each other on the phone, getting excited
about putting our class together," said Mayfield, who
hails from Las Vegas. "We knew we could be one of
the greatest classes in history. There were eight of us
and no one has fallen off, everyone has continued to
improve."
Zedlitz, an Oklahoma City, Okla. native, agreed.
"If you step back and look, it's amazing," he said.
"Coming in, if we would have told you individual
goals, it would have been an incredible list. We've
been able to do a lot of great things."
A large part of that motivation comes from Ken

ney, who is considered the best in the business at cre
ating a team atmosphere in what seems to be an indi
vidual sport. "I attribute a lot of my success to Skip,"
said Weatherford, who hails from Ft. Myers, Fla.
"He's the greatest motivator I've ever heard. I've
learned a lot about myself as an athlete and a person.
I'd never trade the experience."
Over their collegiate careers, the trio has provided
the team with more than just championship hard
ware. Zedlitz, Stanford's co-captain along with fel
low senior Bob Eastlack, is aware of the importance
of the team concept to the Cardinal.
"I try to show the younger guys what it takes to
have success in the water and out of the water as
well," Zedlitz said. "I deal with personality problems,
getting them out in the open and out of the way so
the team can function as a cohesive unit."
Kenney also acknowledged the crucial role these
three seniors play. "They are all team guys, they care
a lot about the team," he said. "They bust their tails
in workout and are not afraid to tell other people
when they aren't working hard."
Despite their diverse experiences and geographi
cal backgrounds, Mayfield, Weatherford and Zedlitz
share many of the keys to success. "Obviously,
they're all talented," Kenney said. "They are very
dedicated away from the pool and in the pool, which
makes a big difference in college athletics.
"They are also very open to changes in stroke and
training. They process information and try and expe
rience new things. When they came here they were
already good, but they've gotten better."
Along the way, each Cardinal star has attained
particular goals that they set for themselves. May-
