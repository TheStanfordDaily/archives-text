# 'Popeye' takes tenacious tennis to professional ranks
## 
### Rob Ross Senior staff writer 
Laxmi Poruri is an artist. A painter perhaps;
a Rembrandt with a racket. Her canvas is the
tennis court; her shows are her competitions
where the end result is not primarily a win or
loss, but a piece of work, a complete tennis
match.
Perhaps this artistry was most evident at the
NCAA Championships last month, where after
a winning volley or forehand, the comments in
the press room weren't "What a great shot!" but
"What a beautiful shot!" It is this difference
between the great shots and the beautiful ones,
the ones that seem both impossible and perfect,
that separate Poruri from most of the rest of the
collegiate tennis world.
Poruri began making her first strokes at age
five. Her family left their native India when this
future Stanford tennis star was just a toddler.
Their first destination was Chicago, and from
there they traveled to Northern California.
They finally settled further south, in Clare
mont, where Poruri began to make waves in the
tennis world.
"I had a fair amount of success [on the junior
levell," she said.
That statement goes beyond modesty to the
realm of sarcasm. Her "fair amount of success"
is like saying Shaquille O'Neal had a "fair
amount of success" his rookie year in the NBA.
At age 14 she was the Girl's 14-and-under Sin
gles Champion. At 15 she was named the "Most
Promising Junior Player" by Seventeen Maga
zine. A year later she was the National Juniors
Singles Champion and advanced to the second
round of the U.S. Open's Main Draw.
She returned to the U.S. Open the following
year and, as a senior in high school, posted wins
over Arantxa Sanchez and Monica Seles. Her
artistry was evident, and she harbored thoughts
about turning pro even before college.
But the success was premature. "My last two
years as a junior were miserable," she said. "I
had too much success, too much attention and
too much pressure early ... I like to think of
myself as a purist — I love the game for the
game itself. But there were a lot of distractions
that kept me from playing... I realized that the
world sucks. Not life, but the world."

So instead of the road of Steffi Graf and Jen
nifer Capriati, Poruri took Route 1 north to
Stanford, her "dream school."
"This was the Julliard of tennis and aca
demics both," she said. "I never considered
another place."
What better place to practice one's art of ten
nis than the Julliard of the sport? It seemed like
the perfect match until she got to the Farm and
realized the distractions that plagued her
toward the end of her junior career did not dis
appear, they just took different forms.
A self-described "introvert" in high school,
Poruri found the freedom and openness of her
new environment to be an unsettling experi
ence, to put it mildly.
"I was the biggest headcase" is her more
blunt way of describing a turbulent freshman
year that saw her take over a month off from
tennis, the first such sojourn of her career. The
break did wonders, as she had an "amazing
NCAAs" playing No. 5 singles for the Cardinal.
Teamed with sophomore Heather Willens, she
made it to the semifinals of the NCAA doubles
tournament, thereby garnering her first All-
American award, the first of seven she was to
win in her four-year career.
Her next three years were ones of constant
improvement. Poruri continued working on her
aggressive style of play, which paid large divi
dends. As a sophomore she rose in the rankings
from No. 75 to No. 2, losing to Georgia's Shan
non McCarthy in the semifinals of the NCAA
singles tournament. In 1993 she also finished
ranked second, this time behind Florida's Lisa
Raymond. This year, while ranked No. 1 most
of the season, Poruri lost in the semifinals of the
tournament, so she will most likely end her Car
dinal career ranked No. 2 behind NCAA singles
champion Angela Lettiere.
The best description of Poruri's game may
have come from another audience member at
this year's NCAA Championships, who said
that "she plays like a guy." Poruri takes this
thought as a compliment, in so far as it
describes aggressive play that is relatively rare
in women's tennis.
"That is a great compliment," she said. "I
never want to be a passive player ... I'm non
patient by nature and when your are aggressive
it takes less patience. You can either hit a win

ner or miss — it takes more energy [than being
a baseliner) and different skills."
After her semifinals loss to UCLA's Keri
Phebus last month, Poruri announced her deci
sion to turn pro after graduation. For her,
though, it wasn't as much of a decision as a nat
ural progression.
"I love the game. I love to win, but that's not
why I do it," she said. "I just feel a huge attach
ment to the sport. I should be on the tennis
court. I don't feel that way about anything else.
It's like I was destined to be on the court."
But the world of professional tennis is a far
cry from the insulated life of a collegian. Poruri
recognizes that there are sharks out there wait
ing, but sees it as yet another step in her matu
ration process. It may not be picture-perfect
Kansas anymore, but she's ready to meet the
challenge.
"It's extremely difficult," she said. "You
can't pick out any player and say that they will
make it. It's like the lottery; neither failure nor
success is guaranteed. I know I'm going to get
my butt kicked for a while, but I can't walk
away from my tennis career and not know [how
good I could have been]."
Although not the introvert she was in high
school, Poruri remains a loner. She's the one on
campus who seems biologically attached to her
yellow Walkman, forever shutting the real
world out and creating her own, whether it be to
the tunes of the early '80s or Vivaldi.
Where she expresses herself is on the tennis
court. From sideline to sideline, she exposes her
personality in ways she doesn't come close to
outside of the stadium.
"Tennis is the way I express myself; the way
I connect with myself," she said. "I don't care
about anything else. I think if you want to be
the best, you have to be obsessed."
This expression is intuitive. Poruri doesn't
think about her shots, she just follows her
instincts. That is when her great moments are
produced.
Poruri commented that her biggest regret
was not continuing to play the piano, which she
gave up at a young age. Of course, it really
hasn't mattered — she continues to create
beautiful things.
Only now they're designed and displayed on
a tennis court.

aggressive style of play, which paid large divi
dends. As a sophomore she rose in the rankings
from No. 75 to No. 2, losing to Georgia's Shan
non McCarthy in the semifinals of the NCAA
singles tournament. In 1993 she also finished
ranked second, this time behind Florida's Lisa
Raymond. This year, while ranked No. 1 most
of the season, Poruri lost in the semifinals of the
tournament, so she will most likely end her Car
dinal career ranked No. 2 behind NCAA singles
champion Angela Lettiere.
The best description of Poruri's game may
have come from another audience member at
this year's NCAA Championships, who said
that "she plays like a guy." Poruri takes this
thought as a compliment, in so far as it
describes aggressive play that is relatively rare
in women's tennis.
"That is a great compliment," she said. "I
never want to be a passive player ... I'm non
patient by nature and when your are aggressive
it takes less patience. You can either hit a win

ner or miss — it takes more energy [than being
a baseliner) and different skills."
After her semifinals loss to UCLA's Keri
Phebus last month, Poruri announced her deci
sion to turn pro after graduation. For her,
though, it wasn't as much of a decision as a nat
ural progression.
"I love the game. I love to win, but that's not
why I do it," she said. "I just feel a huge attach
ment to the sport. I should be on the tennis
court. I don't feel that way about anything else.
It's like I was destined to be on the court."
But the world of professional tennis is a far
cry from the insulated life of a collegian. Poruri
recognizes that there are sharks out there wait
ing, but sees it as yet another step in her matu
ration process. It may not be picture-perfect
Kansas anymore, but she's ready to meet the
challenge.
"It's extremely difficult," she said. "You
can't pick out any player and say that they will
make it. It's like the lottery; neither failure nor
success is guaranteed. I know I'm going to get
my butt kicked for a while, but I can't walk
away from my tennis career and not know [how
good I could have been]."
Although not the introvert she was in high
school, Poruri remains a loner. She's the one on
campus who seems biologically attached to her
yellow Walkman, forever shutting the real
world out and creating her own, whether it be to
the tunes of the early '80s or Vivaldi.
Where she expresses herself is on the tennis
court. From sideline to sideline, she exposes her
personality in ways she doesn't come close to
outside of the stadium.
"Tennis is the way I express myself; the way
I connect with myself," she said. "I don't care
about anything else. I think if you want to be
the best, you have to be obsessed."
This expression is intuitive. Poruri doesn't
think about her shots, she just follows her
instincts. That is when her great moments are
produced.
Poruri commented that her biggest regret
was not continuing to play the piano, which she
gave up at a young age. Of course, it really
hasn't mattered — she continues to create
beautiful things.
Only now they're designed and displayed on
a tennis court.

Laxmi Poruri gets pumped up after a victory In last month's NCAA
Championships. Poruri finished her senior season ranked No. 2 in
the collegiate ranks after amassing her seventh Ail-American
award.
Laxmi Poruri is an artist. A painter perhaps;
a Rembrandt with a racket. Her canvas is the
tennis court; her shows are her competitions
where the end result is not primarily a win or
loss, but a piece of work, a complete tennis
match.
Perhaps this artistry was most evident at the
NCAA Championships last month, where after
a winning volley or forehand, the comments in
the press room weren't "What a great shot!" but
"What a beautiful shot!" It is this difference
between the great shots and the beautiful ones,
the ones that seem both impossible and perfect,
that separate Poruri from most of the rest of the
collegiate tennis world.
Poruri began making her first strokes at age
five. Her family left their native India when this
future Stanford tennis star was just a toddler.
Their first destination was Chicago, and from
there they traveled to Northern California.
They finally settled further south, in Clare
mont, where Poruri began to make waves in the
tennis world.
"I had a fair amount of success [on the junior
levell," she said.
That statement goes beyond modesty to the
realm of sarcasm. Her "fair amount of success"
is like saying Shaquille O'Neal had a "fair
amount of success" his rookie year in the NBA.
At age 14 she was the Girl's 14-and-under Sin
gles Champion. At 15 she was named the "Most
Promising Junior Player" by Seventeen Maga
zine. A year later she was the National Juniors
Singles Champion and advanced to the second
round of the U.S. Open's Main Draw.
She returned to the U.S. Open the following
year and, as a senior in high school, posted wins
over Arantxa Sanchez and Monica Seles. Her
artistry was evident, and she harbored thoughts
about turning pro even before college.
But the success was premature. "My last two
years as a junior were miserable," she said. "I
had too much success, too much attention and
too much pressure early ... I like to think of
myself as a purist — I love the game for the
game itself. But there were a lot of distractions
that kept me from playing... I realized that the
world sucks. Not life, but the world."

So instead of the road of Steffi Graf and Jen
nifer Capriati, Poruri took Route 1 north to
Stanford, her "dream school."
"This was the Julliard of tennis and aca
demics both," she said. "I never considered
another place."
What better place to practice one's art of ten
nis than the Julliard of the sport? It seemed like
the perfect match until she got to the Farm and
realized the distractions that plagued her
toward the end of her junior career did not dis
appear, they just took different forms.
A self-described "introvert" in high school,
Poruri found the freedom and openness of her
new environment to be an unsettling experi
ence, to put it mildly.
"I was the biggest headcase" is her more
blunt way of describing a turbulent freshman
year that saw her take over a month off from
tennis, the first such sojourn of her career. The
break did wonders, as she had an "amazing
NCAAs" playing No. 5 singles for the Cardinal.
Teamed with sophomore Heather Willens, she
made it to the semifinals of the NCAA doubles
tournament, thereby garnering her first All-
American award, the first of seven she was to
win in her four-year career.
Her next three years were ones of constant
improvement. Poruri continued working on her

dends. As a sophomore she rose in the rankings
