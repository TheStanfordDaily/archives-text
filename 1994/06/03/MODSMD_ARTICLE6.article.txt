# THE
						NEW GRADING POLICY
## 
### 
• Will record "NP" for "not passed" on student transcripts when students
fail classes they take for a grade. Currently, no failing grades are recorded.
• Will move the deadline for adding courses to the end of the third week
of the quarter. Now courses can be added until week seven.
• Will move the deadline for dropping a class with no record until the end
of the fourth week of the quarter. Now classes can be dropped until the
course's final exam.
• Will record a "W" for "withdrew" when students drop a class between
the fourth and eighth weeks. An NP or no credit will be recorded after
week eight. Now, no W notation exists.
• Will move the deadline for declaring the pass/no credit grading option
to the sixth week of the quarter. Now the deadline is week three.
• Will allow students to retake a course for units once, but the first in
stance will appear on transcripts next to the notation "RP" for "repeated
course." When retaking the course, students must enroll for the same
number of units as their first time, and an asterisk will appear next to the
second grade to indicate the course was repeated. No units will be
recorded for the first instance. Students will be able to take courses a
third time only if they receive an NP or NC the second time. Both the sec
ond and third grades received will appear on the transcript and the third
listing will be for zero units. Now, students can retake courses any num
ber of times and petition to have their previous performances wiped from
their records.
• Will award incompletes only when students have made such arrange
ments with their professors by the last day of class. Students must clear
incompletes within one year or receive NP or NC grades. Now courses
can be recorded as incomplete until a student graduates and students
can petition to have incompletes removed from their transcripts.
• Will apply to all students except those in professional schools, but in
cluding Ph.D. candidates in the School of Medicine.
• Will take effect, for the most part, beginning with the 1995-96 academ
ic year. Until that date, however, the current retake and incomplete poli
cies will only apply to courses taken this academic year or earlier.
