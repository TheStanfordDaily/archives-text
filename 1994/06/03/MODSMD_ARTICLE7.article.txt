# Begay shatters records at NCAAs; Cardinal leads after 2nd day
## 
### Linda Friedlieb Editorial staff 
It was 90 degrees outside yes
terday, but the Stanford men's
golf team proved that the sun
wasn't the only hot thing at the
second day of the NCAA Cham
pionships in McKinney, Texas.
Junior Notah Begay 111 led
the team in shooting a school
record low of 273 to take a two
stroke lead over Arkansas after
the second day of the four-day
competition.
Begay himself ended the day
tied for first place after a record
setting round of 62. The 10-
under-par round was the best in
Begay's career, setting a Stan
ford record for best individual
round and an NCAA round
record.
Begay also tied an NCAA
championship record for best
individual round.
Entering yesterday's compe
tition the Stanford team was in
eighth place with 292 strokes —
13 behind the Arkansas Razor
backs. But the Cardinal moved
into first after yesterday's
round with a 15-under-par score
of 273, bringing their total to
565.

Yesterday's score is six
strokes better than the previous
school record set in 1992.
"This year's team has been a
record-breaking team," head
coach Wally Goodwin said in a
statement. "I guess we set a few
more today."
Currently behind the second
place Razorbacks are Georgia
Tech and Florida, tied with two
day totals of 570 strokes. Only
15 of the original 30 entrants re
main in competition.
"Whenever you shoot a team
round like this, it's fueled by
one spectacular score," Good
win said. "We were fueled by one
Notah Begay. At the same time,
we couldn't have done this with
out three other good scores."
After two days of competi
tion, Begay stood tied for first
place with Georgia Tech's
Mikko Rantanen. Setting yet
another Stanford record, Begay
rolled in 10 birdies, nine from
10 feet or further away. A nat
ural right-handed player, Begay
shot four birdie putts from the
left side.
"This was the best day of my
life as far as golf is concerned,"
Begay said. "It wasn't a perfect
round, but it was close."

Begay's most stellar shot was
a 60-foot, right-handed putt on
the 18th hole. "I hadn't made a
long, long putt like that in quite
awhile," he said. "Making that
putt was the biggest thrill of my
golfing life."
Junior Steve Burdick led the
rest of the team.
After shooting a pair of 70-
stroke rounds, Burdick stood
tied for seventh place in the in
dividual standings.
William Yanagisawa ended
the day in 23rd place with a total
of 143; Casey Martin followed
with a total of 150; and Brad
Lanning shot 153 in the two
rounds of play.
Goodwin said he was espe
cially proud of Martin, who shot
his worst round of the year dur
ing first-round play and then a
70 yesterday. "In my over 30
years as a coach, I would charac
terize Casey as the toughest
athlete I've ever coached," he
said.
The team is entering the last
two days of competition pre
pared, Goodwin said. "Whether
we are the hunter or the hunted .
. . I know our guys will be excit
ed. There's a long, long way to
go. We're only halfway there."
