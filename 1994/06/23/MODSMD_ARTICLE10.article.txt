# CUE proposes future changes
## 
### 
In order to emphasize the im
portance of science and to respond
to complaints regarding the Cul
tures, Ideas and Values program,
the Commission on Undergradu
ate Education will recommend
several new changes next fall.
In addition, the Commission on
Undergraduate Education (CUE)
will propose a new role for the vice
provost of undergraduate educa
tion, a stronger advising system
and a different language require
ment. A three-year degree pro-

gram will not,
however, be pro
posed as commis
sion chair James
Sheehan, history
professor, told
the Faculty Sen
ate on June 9.
CUE has been i
discussing these i
changes through-

out the year and the tinal reports
will be completed this summer.
The results will then be an
nounced by President Gerhard
Caspser on Oct. 1. At the earliest,
the new proposals will go into ef
fect in the fall of 1995, said Shee
han.
Sheehan believes that each new
proposal will equally benefit the
undergraduates' education. "They
(the proposals) are all part of a
package. One is not more drastic
than another."
One new proposal suggests a
three-quarter science course for
non-science majors which would
replace the three current distrib
ution requirements in natural
sciences, mathematical sciences,
and technology and applied sci
ences.
"We didn't feel the current re
quirements were doing a good job
of making science accessible to
non-science majors," Sheehan
said.
Through student and faculty
input, CUE learned that many
found the Cultures, Ideas and Val
ues (CIV) program inadequate and
not doing what it originally set out
to do, said Sheehan.
"[CIV] has had a number of dif
ferent goals over the years," Shee
han said. "It's time to stop and re
think what the basic goals are."

CUE proposed substituting the
current CIV tracks for a new
three-quarter CIV course combin
ing the world cultures and Ameri
can cultures requirement in order
to reduce the number of gradua
tion requirements.
Sheehan also stated the current
requirement of three years of high
school foreign language was "sim
ply inadequate and didn't add up
to anything." Instead, CUE pro
posed that incoming students
must pass a proficiency test equiv
alent to one year at Stanford or
they would be required to take a
language class.
In addition, CUE proposed that
a vice provost for undergraduates
should be created to coordinate
outside activities, that technology
should play a more active role in
teaching, and that a stronger fac
ulty advising system should be cre
ated.
Regarding the academic calen
dar, Sheehan said CUE will, "show
how it is possible to graduate in
three years, but not change any re
quirements."
