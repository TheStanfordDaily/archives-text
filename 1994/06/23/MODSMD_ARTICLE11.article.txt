# Japanese emperor visits Stanford
## 
### 
Today Japanese Emperor Aki
hito and his wife, Empress
Michiko will grace the Stanford
community with a brief visit to the
University.
Coming near the end of a 15-
day, coast-to-coast U.S. tour, the
emperor's 2 1/2 hour campus stay
will start at the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center (SLAC) and
end with a luncheon at Universi
ty President Gerhard Casper's
home, the Lou Henry Hoover
House. SLAC Director Burton
Richter will greet the royal couple
at the accelerator.
When Richter first heard of the
emperor's visit, he "enthusiasti
cally welcomed the idea."
While U.S.-Japanese relations
on the national level have re
mained tense, Stanford has main
tained healthy scientific and acad
emic links with Japan.
In fact, according to Asst. Direc
tor Michael Riordan, Japanese sci
entists and engineers helped build
the 4000-ton detector that sur
rounds the area in the accelerator
where the two particle beams

cross. For more than a decade,
both Stanford and Japan's Nation
al Laboratory for High Energy
Physics have specialized in the
study of high energy electrons and
positrons, the anti-particle of the
electron, Riordan added.
Large scale collaboration also
takes place between Stanford
and Japan's Nagoya and Tohoku
Universities with the hope of fur
thering research in the nature of
elementary particles, Riordan
said.
"This will be the only big sci
ence project the emperor will see,"
Richter said. A few lucky Stanford
students — a small group of post
doctorates — will receive an oppor
tunity to chat with the emperor be
fore he is hurried over to the
Hoover House for lunch.
At Casper's home, the emperor
will again speak with students —
about a dozen this time — during a
discussion to take place on the
patio after the meal.
Emperor Akihito's whirlwind
tour marks the second time he has
visited Stanford. The last time was
in 1981 when he was crown prince.
A quick trip also, the then-crown
prince visited during his layover at
San Francisco International Air
port.
