Former Presidential Candidate
Michael Dukakis and Calif. Sen.
Tom Campbell were the featured
speakers at a health policy confer
ence held Tuesday at the Stanford
Medical Center's Fairchild Audito
rium. Entitled "Medicine in Mo
tion. .. The Changing Frontier,"
the one-day program focused on
the need for universal health cov
erage.
Campbell, whose keynote ad
dress hit upon the politics of
health care, said, "It is politically
optimal for the president to keep
universal health care as a desired
promise but to leave out the spe
cific details of implementing it."
Campbell suggested imple
menting incremental reform and
fixing specific problems rather
than trying to execute sweeping
changes. "California can do this
too," he said, suggesting that
states should not wait for a federal
health plan before implementing

their own program.
Dukakis, now a political science
professor at Northeastern Univer
sity, also spoke about health care,
stating, "We need to understand
where we are.... Universal health
coverage has been a battle every
step of the way."
Dukakis cited the struggles and
compromises of former presidents
with Congress in trying to imple-

ment a health care plan. He also
said, "President Clinton deserves
enormous credit to put the issue
[of universal health coverage] on
top of the agenda and to fight for
it."
Dukakis disagreed with Camp
bell's suggestion, however, with
incremental reform, stating that
such a strategy has been tried by
many states but that these states
are nowhere close to universal
health coverage. In order to con
trol costs, Dukakis stressed the
importance of requiring a family
practitioner and of putting limits
on liability.
In addition to Campbell and
Dukakis, the conference also in
cluded a roundtable forum and
smaller breakout groups which fo
cused on such specific topics as
managed care and sports medi
cine. Among the distinguished
guests were Harvard Law School
Prof. Charles Ogletree, Kimberly
Belsh6, director of California De
partment of Health Services, and
Maria Ferrer, executive director of
Health Access, a California con
sumer coalition of more than 200
heath care organizations.
Co-sponsors of the conference in
cluded Stanford Medical Center,
Palo Alto Medical Foundation, Sear
le, Stanford Alumni Association,
Sports Orthopedic and Rehabilita
tion (S.O-AR.) and Health Net.
