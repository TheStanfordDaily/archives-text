### 
On June 7, four Stanford alumni
were chosen by President Clinton as
1994-95 White House fellows.
Along with 13 other fellows, the
alumni will work as full-time, paid
special assistants to senior White
House officials and Cabinet-level of
ficers for a year beginning in Sep
tember.
The four fellows — Janet Beth
Abrams, Yvonne Esperanza Cam
pos, Michael Levitan and Marcel T.
Thomas— will participate in a pro
gram designed to "cultivate the po
litical horizons of talented and intel
lectual leaders," according to White
House Staff Assistant Laura
Schwartz.
"In a day when an individual
feels increasingly remote from the
powers of decision, such leaders can
help others understand and appre
ciate the governing power of the na
tion," Schwartz said.
Each of the Stanford alumni will
bring a wealth of political experi
