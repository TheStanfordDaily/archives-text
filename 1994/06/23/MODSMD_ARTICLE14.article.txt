## Golfers win the championship 
### Andrew Blachman Staff writer 
Behind spectacular individual
finishes from juniors William
Yanigisawa and Notah Begay 111
and timely performances from
all five golfers, the Cardinal
capped the best season in school
history with its first national
title since 1953.
The title marks Stanford's
fourth of the year, and first in a
non-aquatic sport in 1993-94.
Men's and women's swimming
and men's water polo earned top
NCAA honors as well.
"This win means a lot to me as
a coach," Wally Goodwin, head
golf coach, said. "But it means a

lot to the University as well. It's
been quite a year for Stanford."
In claiming its seventh men's
golf national championship, the
Cardinal wrote its way into the
record books. Stanford's overall
four-day score of 1,129 — 23
strokes below par — tied the
NCAA Championship team
record set by Arizona in 1992.
Begay also recorded the best
individual round of the tourna
ment, a 62 on the second day
which shattered numerous colle
giate marks. He birdied ten holes
— nine with putts of ten feet or
more — to set a new course
record at 10-under-par. The
round also marked the best of
Begay's career and the lowest

ever recorded in the NCAA
Championships.
With its top four players re
turning to join highly-coveted
recruit Tiger Woods, Stanford is
already the favorite to capture
next year's NCAA crown.
"We'll be back," said Good
win, referring to next year's
championships in Columbus,
Ohio.
But, for now, the Cardinal has
earned the right to celebrate.
"This is a dream come true,"
Begay said. "At times, I've imag
ined being the last man on the
course, bringing the team in to
win a national championship.
But this is real. Today the dream
came true."
