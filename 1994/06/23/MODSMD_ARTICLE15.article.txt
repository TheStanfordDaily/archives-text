## Dog day afternoon Nicholoson'a up to his hairy old tricks in the Mike Nichols spoof "Wolf" 
### 
Viewers should take heed of the
comment "art is dead," which was
uttered in one of the opening
scenes of Columbia Pictures' new
release "Wolf." Not only is this
movie self-prophesizing, but also
an oblique insult to its audience (do
you need to hear that line "art is
dead" one more time?)
"Wolf' features Jack Nicholson
as brilliant senior editor, Will Ran
dall, who is bitten by a wolf during
a business trip. Upon return to his
publishing firm, Randall finds him
self in the running for reassign
ment as MacLeish House prepares
for a merger. But just as he learns
that he's being shipped off to East
ern Europe while his glib prot6g§
(James Spader) gets the senior edi
tor promotion, Randall begins to
sense the "animus spiritus" with
in; vengeance of a maligned wolf
mem becomes the highlight of the
movie.
Yet, as "Wolf' proceeds, it ap
pears that there is no one focus.
Various sub-plots throughout the
movie surface, but disappointingly,
never seem to be resolved or rather
developed into something substan
tive and engaging. The mention of
the information highway and of the
replacement of a work ethic based
on "taste and individuality" with
"vulgarity and conformity" provide
commentary on the current corpo
rate trend of conglomeration.
But the transformation of the
astute editor into a werewolf plays
into conventional werewolf lore.
It's the same old, same old, where
in the beast-man grapples with his
"other side," visits an expert on de
monic possession, becomes more

virile and ruthless, but can't re
member too well what he does
when night rolls around.
The relationship between Ran
dall and Laura Alden (Michelle Pfi
effer), the rebel daughter of Ran-

dall's boss, leads to June-December
romance, in which both characters
have been deemed somewhat unfit
for "normal" society. (And besides,
even if the love story can be likened
to a "Splash" meets "Manimal"
scenario, "Wolf' wouldn't be com
plete without a little romance,
right?)
Suffice it to say, these multi
plots remain underdeveloped
thanks to the film's sloppy and
shallow dialogue and story. The
corporate politicking continues
without further exploration of the
good and bad side-effects of con
glomeration; it's business as usual,

with the tables turned and Randall
in control.
Yet, it's hard to believe his
transformation from a man ex
tremely admired and humble to,
well, an animal who enjoys "power
without guilt." From the outset, in
spite of the sycophantic smiles of
his co-workers, Randall never fully
comes off as the man more revered
than feared. And as far as the love
story goes, nothing could be more
irritating and played out. Every
thing seems too predictable... and
at worst, outright condescending.
Are we really to take this movie
seriously? In one scene Will runs
around on all fours and bays at the
moon. Yep, that's right... imagine
a sweaty, hairy, but plainclothed
Jack Nicholson, scrambling up a
pile of rocks like a wolf in a Disney
flick. In another scene, Randall
converts his predatory instincts
into bathetic prose. While Randall
expresses his love for daddy Alden's
little rich girl, he pours out, "If civ
ilization were to end, I wouldn't
want to be with anyone else but
you."
How unfortunate that "Wolf'
should turn out as such. First, the
story was born out of the collabora
tive efforts of author Jim Harrison
("Sundog," "Warlock") and screen
writer Wesley Strick ("Final Analy
sis," "Cape Fear"). Secondly, tech
nically, the movie is tight, replete
with impressive cinematography,
production design, and special ef
fects. Sadly, these bonus points are
not enough to hide the generally
flat and fetal characteristics of the
overall cinematic experience.
