# Editorial
## Editor's welcome 
### 
A summer caught
between a rock and
an veven harder place

An agenda for all
seasons. That's what The
Stanford Daily and Week
ly — its summer counterpart
— seem to be perpetually
searching for. Its an annual
endeavor that commences at
the start of the academic year
and ends at the close of the
summer term. . . only to im
mediately start again a few
weeks later
And at the start of every
volume, each new editor feels
as if the experiences he or she
has gained while working on
volumes past has helped him
or her to design the perfect
compass for the trip — the one
that guarantees you'll never
get lost — only to discover
later, that all the bugs that
they believed were fixed ei
ther had resurfaced or have
been replaced by even nastier
ones.
Two volumes ago, during
autumn of '93, then editor-in
chief Rajiv Chandresakaran
had the following insights:
"Usually new editors use
this space to tell you what's
different with the paper. But
what's in the paper is really
up to you. You can work for us
— our doors are always open.
Or you can write to us. Or you
can make news by getting in
volved in another campus ac
tivity. A healthy and vibrant
Daily is only possible with a
lively campus. The choice is
yours."
A volume later, his prede
cessor, Grace Lee thought it
more important to ask the
right questions. . . .
"Are we happy with the
way things are? Are we doing
anything to change it?. . . .
Are we hiding behind anony
mous words and empty
rhetoric? Have we made a dif
ference in the University? In
the community? Do we care?
"If the answers to these
questions leave us unsatis
fied, now is the time to change
our course. For The Daily this
means several things, most

importantly, a renewed com
mitment to providing more di
verse, in-depth and thought
ful coverage of the campus
throughout our paper."
Well the school year has
come and gone, and the same
problems that faced The Daily
at the beginning of the fall
and spring volumes are still
very much with us, ready for
the next would-be editor to
step into the dual role of navi
gator and pilot. Well if you
thought that person was me,
surprise, you're wrong. Well
sort of.
I have the difficult task of
being the transitional editor
bridging the spring and fall,
the one time during the school
year when things are sup
posed to slow down and be
come less intense. Well if the
last several weeks on campus
have been any indication of
what the remainder of the
summer will be like — wit
ness the excitement and the
madness of the very first
World Cup played on Ameri
can soil — then, I think it is
safe to say that the Stanford
community as a whole is in for
one long, hot summer.
But while you can count on
the The Weekly being right
there with you — if not two
steps ahead of you — report
ing on the events and issues of
the "off-season," don't hold
your breath for any new com
pass designs. All an editor can
hope of his or her publication
is that its coverage is relevant,
timely, intelligently written
. . . and maybe even a little
controversial every now and
then.
With that said, allow me to
wish you a hardy welcome (or
welcome back in some cases)
to the Stanford campus. May
it be as full of surprises for
you as itlikely will be for me.
