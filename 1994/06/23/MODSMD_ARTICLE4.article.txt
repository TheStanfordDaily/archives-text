## A 						Stanford fairy tale 
### 
ONCE UPON A TIME, in the
kingdom of Drofnats, there
were two groups of people:
the I-gots (the ruling elite) and the
Have-nots (the commoners).
For many years, relations be
tween these groups were relatively
blissful. The I-gots distributed re
wards, encouragement, and the oc
casional punishment to the hard
working Have-nots, whose efforts
and labor in turn supported the na
tion. Indeed, the system served to
make Drofnats one of the most ad
mired kingdoms on earth.
However, as often happens,
prosperity bred dissatisfaction
among some I-got dissidents, who
met to determine a way to destroy
the I-got/Have-not relationship.
The meeting was called to order,
and the insurgents began to speak.
"The problem is that the Have
nots aren't laboring hard enough
for their rewards," said Lord
Dooham, a prominent I-got. "The
current system is too lenient. We
shouldn't be in the business of of
fering rewards for hard work in
this kingdom; instead we should
threaten to punish the ne'er-do
wells, the malcontents."
"But don't the Have-nots at
Drofnats work as hard, or harder,
than in other kingdoms?" asked a
Have-not onlooker who managed
to slip into the meeting.
"NONSENSE!" thundered
Dooham. "First, you're a Have-not,
so shut up. You shouldn't play any

part in Drofnats decisions. More
over, you Have-nots work grudg
ingly, at best."
But the perplexed Have-not
managed to ask another question.
She said, "Lord Dooham, I begyour
pardon, but if the Have-nots are so
lackadaisical, how is Drofnats so
successful? We are considered the
top kingdom on earth. Doesn't our
reputation, which you oddly seem
to be most concerned about, result
from the hard work of Have-nots?"
She continued, "Would Drof
nats be in the respected position it
is today if not for the current sys
tem, which allows Have-nots the
freedom to explore their interests,
and, yes, sometimes results in
minor abuses? Isn't that freedom
what distinguishes Drofnats from
the lesser kingdoms to the east?
"Look at the kingdom of Deer, in
Oregonia. They don't give rewards
or punishments at all. Coinciden
tally, the lifespan of Have-nots at
Deer is the longest of those in any
kingdom. Isn't that the direction in
which we should be headed?"
The hulking Lord Dooham was
ready with a response. "Again, I
must restate that you are a Have
not, and that you simply don't
know what's good either for your
self or for Drofnats. Case closed."
"I agree with Lord Dooham,"
chimed in Barron Sirrah, another
I-got, "but for different reasons. I
believe the welfare of Have-nots is
eroded by the current,system. Look

at Drofnats. The average Have-not
earns 3.7 geepaas per day!
"It cheapens the value of a geep
aa to have them in such wide sup
ply. If we were to lower the number
of geepaas available — say, to 3.0
— then the Have-nots would care
about their geepaas much, much
more, and the Have-nots would be
respected for their willingness to
suffer for the kingdom's integrity."
Sirrah added, "In addition, we
must ask ourselves what, indeed,
we are trying to do here in Drof
nats. Are we trying to create a na
tion where all Have-nots feel that
their welfare is secure and that
they can explore new roads?
"A more stringent geepaa sys
tem will work wonders to keep the
Have-nots in their place — in the li
brary and the fields, studying and
laboring as we want them to —
rather than allowing them to ex
plore their own interests, especially
in the lands bordering Drofnats."
And with these as the session's
closing words, the cabal set about
to transform the kingdom of Drof
nats. Unfortunately, here the fairy
tale ends. Fairy tales, by definition,
must close with a happy ending.
This story, alas, does not.
