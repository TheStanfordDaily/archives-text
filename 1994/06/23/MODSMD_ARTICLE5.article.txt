## Chicano Studies a worthwhile campus addition 
### 
AS STANFORD reflects on
the role of its language and
literature departments, the
unique place of Spanish in the
United States and on our campus
must be recognized and under
stood.
On the one hand, Spanish is
the principal language of this
hemisphere outside the U.S. At
the same time, Spanish is not a
"foreign language" either in the
United States or at Stanford. Its
history in what is now the U.S.
Southwest outdates that of Eng
lish by three centuries. It has
been continuously spoken and
written by great numbers of
Americans for many generations.
Recognizing these realities is
part of Stanford's responsibility
as a msyor institute of higher
learning in the state of California.
We therefore applaud there

cent agreement between students
and the central administration
establishing a process for the
founding of a Chicano Studies
Program on our campus. This is a
positive step which our campus
can view with enthusiasm and
pride. The Chicano Studies ini
tiative is also very much in line
with one of the dictates of the
current restructuring processes:
namely, the demand to build on
our strengths. Chicano studies
already has a significant history
here, in the departments of Eng
lish, Spanish and Portuguese,
Anthropology, History and the
highly regarded Center for Chi
cano Research.
The Department of Spanish
and Portuguese established Chi
cano Studies as one of the five
paths for its undergraduate
msyor in 1977, following the hir

ing of a full-time specialist in the
field. Chicano literature became a
doctoral specialization a few
years later, and six students have
written dissertations in the field,
with several more in the pipeline.
Many of our graduate students
teach Chicano texts at the Uni
versities where they work. Our
graduates in Chicano Literature
hold faculty positions at such in
stitutions as UC-Berkeley, the
University of Texas, Arizona
State and Cornell.
The recent addition of Profs.
Guadalupe Valdes and Yvonne
Yarbro-Bejarano to the faculty of
Spanish and Portuguese have
greatly enhanced our ability to
develop research initiatives and
curriculum in the fields of Chi
cano/Latino language and expres
sive culture, and to build an intel
lectual home for the considerable

Spanish-speaking and Latino stu
dent body on campus.
As a department we look for
ward to supporting the develop
ment of Chicano Studies at Stan
ford, and congratulate those who
are making it possible.
