# Class of 1994
## Commencement 
### Victor Haseman Editorial staff 
For many members of Stanford's 103 rd
graduating class, the processional
through Stanford Stadium's track and
field will be remembered as some of the
most important steps of their lives.
And like many classes before them, the
103 rd class showed how excited they were
to be finally taking those steps in a num
ber of unusually zany and original ways.
What began as an orderly parade timed
to the pleasant melodies of the Stanford
Symphonic Band, quickly deteriorated
into a giddy free-for-all. One graduate,
with the help of a few friends, proposed
marriage to his college sweetheart. One
group set-up a quick game of cricket,
while another group anticipating the
World Cup excitement, started a soccer
match of their own on a patch of field fac
ing away from the side of the stadium re
served for parents and guests.
And as if the above activities coupled
with the traditional icons of beach balls,
Frisbees, rollerblading graduates and
champagne didn't add enough to the cir
cus like atmosphere of the event, another
group of graduates stripped down to their
shorts to stage a wrestling free-for-all.
In his second Commencement address
since coming to Stanford, University
President Gerhard Casper congratulated
the class of '93 on their achievements and

wished them "the very best as you decide
what to do with yourselves. Not just in a
week or two, but like all of us, for ever and
ever." He then encouraged the graduates
to "salute those who have made you Star
ford years possible," before introducing
Yale Law School Professor, author

Stephen Carter.
After thank
ing the class of
'93 for the
chance to speak
before them,
Carter — Stan
ford Class of
1976 — remi
nisced about his
days at Stanford
as both a stu
dent and a
columnist for
The Daily, and
some of the is
sues that were
important to
him at the time.
"Eighteen years
ago," he remem-

bered, "we were convinced that, the Stan
ford we knew was about to be destroyed,
that only the rich would be able to afford
to attend, because of the faculty decision
to push yearly tuition above $4,000 a
year."

"Fortunately," he continued," we turned
out to be wrong. Stanford is still a magical
place, a marvelously diverse place, and the
Stanford experience, like the Stanford degree,
will open doors that I, at least, as a student
was unable to imagine. The very name Stan
ford carries some magic, even if at times the

magic is of the
wrong kind."
But Carter,
author of "Re
flections of an
Affirmative Ac
tion Baby" and
several other
well regarded
books, quickly
shifted from
reminiscing to
addressing
what he saw as
a more salient
matter: the
pending col
lapse of "moral
consensus" in
our society.
"Moral

certainty can be a marvelously progres
sive force," said Carter. "Moral certainty
gave our nation the willingness to fight
against fascism and genocide abroad dur
ing World War 11, against racial segrega
tion at home during the civil rights move

ment. Moral certainty can also be horri
bly. After all, Pol Pot and the perpetrators
of the Inquisition were morally certain
too."
Carter went on to suggest that just as in
past decades America has fought moral bat
tles for the good of its citizens and the rest
of the world that during the decade of the
'90s, that a similar battle needs to be
fought: "a war to restore or, perhaps for the
first time, bring integrity to American life."
Carter's address was followed by award
presentations for the Lloyd W. Dinkel
spiel award for outstanding service to un
dergraduate education, the Walter J.
Gores award for excellence in teaching,
and the Kenneth M. Cuthbertson award
for exceptional service.
Lecturer Helen Brooks, Assistant Dean
of Students James Larrimore and gradu
ating Seniors Andrea Marmor and Jason
Snyder received Dinkelspiel awards. Al
bert M. Camarillo, professor of history
and associate dean of the School of Hu
manities and Sciences; Assistant Profes
sor of Biology Susan McConnell, Scott
McKeon, graduate student in engineer
ing-economic systems and Hugh P. Pill,
graduate student in economics received
the Gores award.
Associate Dean of Research Patricia
Devaney and Director of Public Safety
Marvin Herrington received Cuthbertson
awards.
