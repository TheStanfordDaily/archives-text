# World Cup Madness
## 
### 
Not only did the first World
Cup game at Stanford
leave the Brazilians happy,
but it left many in the surround
ing community pleased as well.
Security officials, administra
tors and local businesses were
generally satisfied with Mon
day's atmosphere and events and
hope that future games will con
tinue to run as smoothly.
"It has been very positive, very
festive," said Susan Frank, exec
utive director of the Palo Alto
Chamber of Commerce.
Security
Weeks of planning for the World
Cup Soccer games paid off as the
first day went relatively smoothly
with only nine arrests.
"The people were fine ... we
had more problems with the San
Jose State game," Captain
Niemeyer of the Stanford Police
said.
Seven scalpers were arrested
for illegally selling game tickets.
In addition, a citizen was arrest
ed for being drunk in public, and
another was arrested for a traffic
warrant, said Niemeyer.
"The atmosphere was festive,
but there have been no outbreaks
of any violence reported to us
whatsoever," Niemeyer added.
The only serious incident of
the day occurred at 8:40 a.m.
when a pedestrian bridge, which
crossed Nelson road connecting
the media tent to the Stadium at
Gate 5, was knocked down by a
Peninsula Sanitary Service
garbage truck.
"Fortunately nobody was on
or below the bridge at the time of
the incident and there were no in
juries," Niemeyer said.
The Peninsula Sanitary Ser
vice refused to comment on the
incident.
The only other headache for
the local police was getting the
fans off and on the CalTrain be
cause a greater number of people
used the service than expected,
said Palo Alto Police Leuitenant
Jon Hernandez, who is currently
traffic manager for the World
Cup.
Santa Clara county expected
10,000 people to use the train,
when in fact 16,000 people actu
ally did, said Hernandez. Because
of this large number — 5,000
from the San Jose direction and
11,000 from the San Fransisco
direction — not all the fans could
get on the trains after the game,
making many people impatient,
said Hernandez.
"People were getting exasper
ated and trying to jump the line
so we got the Allied SWAT team
and the Santa Clara Sheriffs to

form a wall between the patrons
and the train," Hernandez said.
"They also tried to calm them
down."
Patrol Captain Tom Merson
added, "The problem is not with
people arriving at the game be
cause they arrive at staggered in
tervals, but when they are leav
ing they all get out at once and
want to get in the train at once."
Rita Haskin, supervisor of
public information for CalTrain
said that they are planning to
even the trains out so that most
trains have eight cars instead of
four or 12, which "will help dis
pose the load faster," she said.
"We may also put in one more
train, but we don't have staff and
equipment to put in any more,"
Haskin added.

Administration
Although many imagined the
worst possible scenario for the
World Cup, a day full of traffic
jams, noise and chaos as the
media predicted, the first game
went much smoother than most
faculty and staff members antici
pated.
"I was quite pleasantly sur
prised," said Keith Smith, man
ager of employee relations. "I ex
pected a lot more chaos and con
fusion, but instead I saw a lot
more order."
Faculty and staff members fol
lowed their daily schedules which
was beneficial for some, such as
Assoc. Dean of the Graduate
School of Business David Baron,
who bikes to work. Others simply
planned accordingly to avoid the
traffic in Palo Alto on Monday.
"Everyone was aware of it on
Monday. They planned around it
by not going off campus for
lunch," Public Relations Officer
Terry Shepard said. "In general,
everyone was going on about
their business."
Many even believed that at
certain times during the first
game, the day was no more dis
tinguishable than any other work
day. Parking, which was expected
to be a large problem, proved not
to be a concern for faculty and
staff.
"I expected a larger parking
demand," said Valerie Veronin,
coordinator for the World Cup at
Stanford. "We had the capacity in
the lots. We planned for the worst
case, and we were not even close
to it."
Shepard found the parking on
the Oval emptier than usual, and

Smith believed that the number
of cars in the staff parking lot was
considerably fewer than on a typ
ical day. The parking availability
was due to the fact that people ex
perimented with other methods
of transportation. Some faculty
and staff members even took the
day off.
"People really did try public
transportation for the first
game," Veronin said. "We'll see if
they shift their mode of trans
portation."
Although the majority of fac
ulty and staff members felt that
holding the World Cup on cam
pus was not a problem, others
found it aggravating and some
what disruptive.
"It is definitely difficult on
World Cup days because we're
stuck here and we can't leave,"
said Nan Bentley, administrator
for the history department. "It's
also not making any money for
the campus."
Several members of the ad
ministration remarked that it
was disappointing that the cam
pus and Palo Alto were not re
ceiving the recognition they de
served. Instead, many believe the
media is focusing more on the
traffic and accident reports. Oth
ers are upset that Palo Alto has
been associated as a part of San
Francisco and hasn't been recog
nized as an individual city.
"The World Cup is not helping
Stanford's image because all of
the banners say San Francisco,"
Bentley said.
Veronin, who observed that
the majority of the media's cover
age was on local traffic problems
and shots of the stadium, said,
"They're focusing on the actual
games as it should be."
Baron added that with the
large amount of visitors, it was
probable that everyone was im
pressed with the campus and ap
preciated its beauty. He was dis
appointed, however, in the cover
age of the first game because the
media mentioned mainly the
Stanford Stadium instead of the
campus.
Most administrators agree
that holding the World Cup

games on campus is an honor and
adds to Stanford's prestigious
reputation.
"We've held the Super Bowl,
Olympic soccer events and now
the World Cup on campus,"
Smith said. "They're positive
community event builders. It lets
everyone know where Stanford is
located."
For the most part, the admin
istration was pleased and sur
prised with the small amount of
problems that occurred during
the first game. No drastic prob
lems are anticipated and business
in the administration will contin
ue as usual.

Restaurants and Hotels
On the economic side, holding
World Cup in Palo Alto has been
a "mixed bag," according to
Susan Frank, executive director
of the Palo Alto Chamber of
Commerce.
"We understand that the
restaurants and bars are doing
really we 11... but that the retail
stores are reporting a lot of

quiet," Frank said. These retail
stores include those at the Stan
ford Shopping Center and down
town Palo Alto.
Dan McGill, manager at Gor
don Biersch Brewery Restaurant,
said that they were "slammed
right after the game [on Mon
day]" but that it was a little too
early to predict how his business
would be affected during the rest
of World Cup. He added that
business on non-game days was
better than usual.
Galen Fletcher, general man
ager at Sundance Mine Co.
Restaurant, reported greater
business as a result of World
Cup. "Last week, we had a 40
percent increase over last year's
business," he said, adding that
many patrons were foreign busi
nessmen and newscast camera
men.
Fletcher also said that his
restaurant hardly had any lunch
business Monday but that busi
ness later on was "all at the bar."
At the popular college hangout
Halftime Sports Cafe, Manager
Juvenal Moreno said that busi
ness was very good Monday, but
that it was "business as usual" on
non-game days.
With the World Cup lasting an
entire month in Palo Alto, one
might expect that the hotels in
the area would be completely
booked and finding a place to stay
would be difficult. Most hotels,
however, still have rooms avail
able.
At the Creekside Inn Best
Western, Night Manager Ruth
Schroeder said, "It (the World
Cup) has made things more inter
esting." She also said that they
have had more of an "interna
tional crowd." However, since
they are more commercial, they
have had more "family-orientat
ed guests," she added.
She also said that unlike other
hotels, Creekside Inn did little
negotiation with large tour
groups.
Booking large tour groups,
which then cancel or fail to show
up, could be one of the reasons
why many of the hotels are not
doing as well as thoy had hoped.

Another reason that the hotels
in Palo Alto may not be doing as
well as expected is that the World
Cup games being played in Stan
ford Stadium have been adver
tised as the "San Francisco
venue." Many ticket holders
spend their days and nights in
San Francisco and then take the
CalTrain to the stadium for the
games.
Kathleen Haney, manager at
the Cardinal Hotel, said that
World Cup fans stay at the hotels
one game at a time. "We have
about eight to ten rooms set aside
for people [going to the games],"
she added.
At the Town & Country Vil
lage, shops and booths were
buzzing with crowds of people
during game day. Beverly Dilling,
manager of Town & Country
Pharmacy, which is selling World
Cup souvenirs, said that non
game sales were comparable to
sales during a typical Christmas
Eve, while business on Monday
"well exceeded" even those num
bers.
Retail Stores
People have been strongly ad
vised through the press not to
drive into Palo Alto on game days
unless it is truly necessary. Busi
ness for the retail stores, there
fore, have not been as bright.
Frank, from the Chamber of
Commerce, said that this fact was
disappointing.
"We are hoping that normal
shoppers would not avoid coming
to Palo Alto on game days,"
Frank stated, adding that "game
traffic did not help retail."
Frank also said that future ef
forts will focus on getting people
to "stick around Palo Alto. . . and
to see that Palo Alto is a wonder
ful place."
At the Stanford Shopping Cen
ter, business was "dead all over"
on Monday, according to Bill
Lives, owner of a men's clothing
and retail store there. He said
that their parking lot was open
only to people attending World
Cup, but that many people either

'It is definitely dif
ficult on World
Cup days because
we're stuck here
and we can't leave.
... It's also not
making any money
for the campus.'
— Nan Bentley

used public transportation or
parked somewhere else that day.
The closing off of the parking lot
alienated local shoppers and
made it unable for them to do
their normal shopping.
Regarding the retail business,
Lives stated, "World Cup did not
help."
These feelings were echoed
word for word by Tim Reising,
manager of another men's cloth
ing and retail store on University
Avenue. He went on to add that
World Cup had "impaired busi
ness" on Monday.
"I think that World Cup is a
good thing for Palo Alto in terms
of exposure, but not for business
es downtown," Reising said.
Expectations versus Results
It has been known for well over a
year that World Cup 94 would be
held at Stanford Stadium. Differ
ent businesses had different ex
pectations and some even made
special preparations for the
event.
Inside the Palo Alto Holiday
Inn, a tent covering 4000 square
feet has been set up especially for
World Cup fans. Here, Rebosio
said that they have been showing
every game live. Plans for this
tent, he added, have been going
on for over a year.
Schroeder, from the Creek
side Inn, said that although she
did not know what to anticipate,
she "expected a little more de
mand." Regarding special prepa
rations for World Cup, she said
that her staff was supplied with
more information and were
trained to answer a barrage of
questions from tourists and tick
et holders. A courtesy shuttle
service has also been provided,
she added.

At the Cardinal Hotel, no spe
cial arrangements have been
made, according to Haney. "We
suspected people would go some
place else, like the city (San Fran
cisco)," she said.
"It's hard to know what to ex
pect," said McGill from Gordon
Biersch. "It's hard to know how
to get involved . . . [because] we
really have nothing to base it on."
At Sundance Mine Co., Fletch
er said that he too did not know
what to expect. Other than extra
security, no special arrangements
were made, he added.
On the other hand, two more
bars have been opened at Half
time Sports Cafe, according to
Moreno.
Festive atmosphere
When asked about the overall
mood or atmosphere after Mon
day's game, many business man
agers mentioned the festive,
party-like atmosphere and also
stressed the spirit of the Brazil
ians.
"It was like a big party," said
Rebosio.
"It was really fun, energetic,
almost like being in another
country," echoed McGill.
Because of the success and
"fun" atmosphere of the first
game, Dilling believes that people
who planned only to attend the
first game will now be looking for
tickets for future games.
"The spirit of the Brazilians
has exceeded any expectations,"
said Dilling. "It felt like we were
in Brazil."

the local police was getting the
fans off and on the CalTrain be
cause a greater number of people
used the service than expected,
said Palo Alto Police Leuitenant
Jon Hernandez, who is currently
traffic manager for the World
Cup.
Santa Clara county expected
10,000 people to use the train,
when in fact 16,000 people actu
ally did, said Hernandez. Because
of this large number — 5,000
from the San Jose direction and
11,000 from the San Fransisco
direction — not all the fans could
get on the trains after the game,
making many people impatient,
said Hernandez.
"People were getting exasper
ated and trying to jump the line
so we got the Allied SWAT team
and the Santa Clara Sheriffs to

form a wall between the patrons
and the train," Hernandez said.
"They also tried to calm them
down."
Patrol Captain Tom Merson
added, "The problem is not with
people arriving at the game be
cause they arrive at staggered in
tervals, but when they are leav
ing they all get out at once and
want to get in the train at once."
Rita Haskin, supervisor of
public information for CalTrain
said that they are planning to
even the trains out so that most
trains have eight cars instead of
four or 12, which "will help dis
pose the load faster," she said.
"We may also put in one more
train, but we don't have staff and
equipment to put in any more,"
Haskin added.

Administration
Although many imagined the
worst possible scenario for the
World Cup, a day full of traffic
jams, noise and chaos as the
media predicted, the first game
went much smoother than most
faculty and staff members antici
pated.
"I was quite pleasantly sur
prised," said Keith Smith, man
ager of employee relations. "I ex
pected a lot more chaos and con
fusion, but instead I saw a lot
more order."
Faculty and staff members fol
lowed their daily schedules which
was beneficial for some, such as
Assoc. Dean of the Graduate
School of Business David Baron,
who bikes to work. Others simply
planned accordingly to avoid the
traffic in Palo Alto on Monday.
"Everyone was aware of it on
Monday. They planned around it
by not going off campus for
lunch," Public Relations Officer
Terry Shepard said. "In general,
everyone was going on about
their business."
Many even believed that at
certain times during the first
game, the day was no more dis
tinguishable than any other work
day. Parking, which was expected
to be a large problem, proved not
to be a concern for faculty and
staff.
"I expected a larger parking
demand," said Valerie Veronin,
coordinator for the World Cup at
Stanford. "We had the capacity in
the lots. We planned for the worst
case, and we were not even close
to it."
Shepard found the parking on
the Oval emptier than usual, and

Smith believed that the number
of cars in the staff parking lot was
considerably fewer than on a typ
ical day. The parking availability
was due to the fact that people ex
perimented with other methods
of transportation. Some faculty
and staff members even took the
day off.
"People really did try public
transportation for the first
game," Veronin said. "We'll see if
they shift their mode of trans
portation."
Although the majority of fac
ulty and staff members felt that
holding the World Cup on cam
pus was not a problem, others
found it aggravating and some
what disruptive.
"It is definitely difficult on
World Cup days because we're
stuck here and we can't leave,"
said Nan Bentley, administrator
for the history department. "It's
also not making any money for
the campus."
Several members of the ad
ministration remarked that it
was disappointing that the cam
pus and Palo Alto were not re
ceiving the recognition they de
served. Instead, many believe the
media is focusing more on the
traffic and accident reports. Oth
ers are upset that Palo Alto has
been associated as a part of San
Francisco and hasn't been recog
nized as an individual city.
"The World Cup is not helping
Stanford's image because all of
the banners say San Francisco,"
Bentley said.
Veronin, who observed that
the majority of the media's cover
age was on local traffic problems
and shots of the stadium, said,
"They're focusing on the actual
games as it should be."
Baron added that with the
large amount of visitors, it was
probable that everyone was im
pressed with the campus and ap
preciated its beauty. He was dis
appointed, however, in the cover
age of the first game because the
media mentioned mainly the
Stanford Stadium instead of the
campus.
Most administrators agree
that holding the World Cup

games on campus is an honor and
adds to Stanford's prestigious
reputation.
"We've held the Super Bowl,
Olympic soccer events and now
the World Cup on campus,"
Smith said. "They're positive
community event builders. It lets
everyone know where Stanford is
located."
For the most part, the admin
istration was pleased and sur
prised with the small amount of
problems that occurred during
the first game. No drastic prob
lems are anticipated and business
in the administration will contin
ue as usual.

Restaurants and Hotels
On the economic side, holding
World Cup in Palo Alto has been
a "mixed bag," according to
Susan Frank, executive director
of the Palo Alto Chamber of
Commerce.
"We understand that the
restaurants and bars are doing
really we 11... but that the retail
stores are reporting a lot of

quiet," Frank said. These retail
stores include those at the Stan
ford Shopping Center and down
town Palo Alto.
Dan McGill, manager at Gor
don Biersch Brewery Restaurant,
said that they were "slammed
right after the game [on Mon
day]" but that it was a little too
early to predict how his business
would be affected during the rest
of World Cup. He added that
business on non-game days was
better than usual.
Galen Fletcher, general man
ager at Sundance Mine Co.
Restaurant, reported greater
business as a result of World
Cup. "Last week, we had a 40
percent increase over last year's
business," he said, adding that
many patrons were foreign busi
nessmen and newscast camera
men.
Fletcher also said that his
restaurant hardly had any lunch
business Monday but that busi
ness later on was "all at the bar."
At the popular college hangout
Halftime Sports Cafe, Manager
Juvenal Moreno said that busi
ness was very good Monday, but
that it was "business as usual" on
non-game days.
With the World Cup lasting an
entire month in Palo Alto, one
might expect that the hotels in
the area would be completely
booked and finding a place to stay
would be difficult. Most hotels,
however, still have rooms avail
able.
At the Creekside Inn Best
Western, Night Manager Ruth
Schroeder said, "It (the World
Cup) has made things more inter
esting." She also said that they
have had more of an "interna
tional crowd." However, since
they are more commercial, they
have had more "family-orientat
ed guests," she added.
She also said that unlike other
hotels, Creekside Inn did little
negotiation with large tour
groups.
Booking large tour groups,
which then cancel or fail to show
up, could be one of the reasons
why many of the hotels are not
doing as well as thoy had hoped.

Another reason that the hotels
in Palo Alto may not be doing as
well as expected is that the World
Cup games being played in Stan
ford Stadium have been adver
tised as the "San Francisco
venue." Many ticket holders
spend their days and nights in
San Francisco and then take the
CalTrain to the stadium for the
games.
Kathleen Haney, manager at
the Cardinal Hotel, said that
World Cup fans stay at the hotels
one game at a time. "We have
about eight to ten rooms set aside
for people [going to the games],"
she added.
At the Town & Country Vil
lage, shops and booths were
buzzing with crowds of people
during game day. Beverly Dilling,
manager of Town & Country
Pharmacy, which is selling World
Cup souvenirs, said that non
game sales were comparable to
sales during a typical Christmas
Eve, while business on Monday
"well exceeded" even those num
bers.
Retail Stores
People have been strongly ad
vised through the press not to
drive into Palo Alto on game days
unless it is truly necessary. Busi
ness for the retail stores, there
fore, have not been as bright.
Frank, from the Chamber of
Commerce, said that this fact was
disappointing.
"We are hoping that normal
shoppers would not avoid coming
to Palo Alto on game days,"
Frank stated, adding that "game
traffic did not help retail."
Frank also said that future ef
forts will focus on getting people
to "stick around Palo Alto. . . and
to see that Palo Alto is a wonder
ful place."
At the Stanford Shopping Cen
ter, business was "dead all over"
on Monday, according to Bill
Lives, owner of a men's clothing
and retail store there. He said
that their parking lot was open
only to people attending World
Cup, but that many people either

'It is definitely dif
ficult on World
Cup days because
we're stuck here
and we can't leave.
... It's also not
making any money
for the campus.'
— Nan Bentley

used public transportation or
parked somewhere else that day.
The closing off of the parking lot
alienated local shoppers and
made it unable for them to do
their normal shopping.
Regarding the retail business,
Lives stated, "World Cup did not
help."
These feelings were echoed
word for word by Tim Reising,
manager of another men's cloth
ing and retail store on University
Avenue. He went on to add that
World Cup had "impaired busi
ness" on Monday.
"I think that World Cup is a
good thing for Palo Alto in terms
of exposure, but not for business
es downtown," Reising said.
Expectations versus Results
It has been known for well over a
year that World Cup 94 would be
held at Stanford Stadium. Differ
ent businesses had different ex
pectations and some even made
special preparations for the
event.
Inside the Palo Alto Holiday
Inn, a tent covering 4000 square
feet has been set up especially for
World Cup fans. Here, Rebosio
said that they have been showing
every game live. Plans for this
tent, he added, have been going
on for over a year.
Schroeder, from the Creek
side Inn, said that although she
did not know what to anticipate,
she "expected a little more de
mand." Regarding special prepa
rations for World Cup, she said
that her staff was supplied with
more information and were
trained to answer a barrage of
questions from tourists and tick
et holders. A courtesy shuttle
service has also been provided,
she added.

At the Cardinal Hotel, no spe
cial arrangements have been
made, according to Haney. "We
suspected people would go some
place else, like the city (San Fran
cisco)," she said.
"It's hard to know what to ex
pect," said McGill from Gordon
Biersch. "It's hard to know how
to get involved . . . [because] we
really have nothing to base it on."
At Sundance Mine Co., Fletch
er said that he too did not know
what to expect. Other than extra
security, no special arrangements
were made, he added.
On the other hand, two more
bars have been opened at Half
time Sports Cafe, according to
Moreno.
Festive atmosphere
When asked about the overall
mood or atmosphere after Mon
day's game, many business man
agers mentioned the festive,
party-like atmosphere and also
stressed the spirit of the Brazil
ians.
"It was like a big party," said
Rebosio.
"It was really fun, energetic,
almost like being in another
country," echoed McGill.
Because of the success and
"fun" atmosphere of the first
game, Dilling believes that people
who planned only to attend the
first game will now be looking for
tickets for future games.
"The spirit of the Brazilians
has exceeded any expectations,"
said Dilling. "It felt like we were
in Brazil."

Not only did the first World
Cup game at Stanford
leave the Brazilians happy,
but it left many in the surround
ing community pleased as well.
Security officials, administra
tors and local businesses were
generally satisfied with Mon
day's atmosphere and events and
hope that future games will con
tinue to run as smoothly.
"It has been very positive, very
festive," said Susan Frank, exec
utive director of the Palo Alto
Chamber of Commerce.
Security
Weeks of planning for the World
Cup Soccer games paid off as the
first day went relatively smoothly
with only nine arrests.
"The people were fine ... we
had more problems with the San
Jose State game," Captain
Niemeyer of the Stanford Police
said.
Seven scalpers were arrested
for illegally selling game tickets.
In addition, a citizen was arrest
ed for being drunk in public, and
another was arrested for a traffic
warrant, said Niemeyer.
"The atmosphere was festive,
but there have been no outbreaks
of any violence reported to us
whatsoever," Niemeyer added.
The only serious incident of
the day occurred at 8:40 a.m.
when a pedestrian bridge, which
crossed Nelson road connecting
the media tent to the Stadium at
Gate 5, was knocked down by a
Peninsula Sanitary Service
garbage truck.
"Fortunately nobody was on
or below the bridge at the time of
the incident and there were no in
juries," Niemeyer said.

Administration
Although many imagined the
worst possible scenario for the
World Cup, a day full of traffic
jams, noise and chaos as the
media predicted, the first game
went much smoother than most
faculty and staff members antici
pated.
"I was quite pleasantly sur
prised," said Keith Smith, man
ager of employee relations. "I ex
pected a lot more chaos and con
fusion, but instead I saw a lot
more order."
Faculty and staff members fol
lowed their daily schedules which
was beneficial for some, such as
Assoc. Dean of the Graduate
School of Business David Baron,
who bikes to work. Others simply
planned accordingly to avoid the
traffic in Palo Alto on Monday.
"Everyone was aware of it on
Monday. They planned around it
by not going off campus for
lunch," Public Relations Officer
Terry Shepard said. "In general,
everyone was going on about
their business."
Many even believed that at
certain times during the first
game, the day was no more dis
tinguishable than any other work
day. Parking, which was expected
to be a large problem, proved not
to be a concern for faculty and
staff.
"I expected a larger parking
demand," said Valerie Veronin,
coordinator for the World Cup at
Stanford. "We had the capacity in
the lots. We planned for the worst
case, and we were not even close
to it."
Shepard found the parking on
the Oval emptier than usual, and

Smith believed that the number
of cars in the staff parking lot was
considerably fewer than on a typ
ical day. The parking availability
was due to the fact that people ex
perimented with other methods
of transportation. Some faculty
and staff members even took the
day off.
"People really did try public
transportation for the first
game," Veronin said. "We'll see if
they shift their mode of trans
portation."
Although the majority of fac
ulty and staff members felt that
holding the World Cup on cam
pus was not a problem, others
found it aggravating and some
what disruptive.
"It is definitely difficult on
World Cup days because we're
stuck here and we can't leave,"
said Nan Bentley, administrator
for the history department. "It's
also not making any money for
the campus."
Several members of the ad
ministration remarked that it
was disappointing that the cam
pus and Palo Alto were not re
ceiving the recognition they de
served. Instead, many believe the
media is focusing more on the
traffic and accident reports. Oth
ers are upset that Palo Alto has
been associated as a part of San
Francisco and hasn't been recog
nized as an individual city.
"The World Cup is not helping
Stanford's image because all of
the banners say San Francisco,"
Bentley said.
Veronin, who observed that
the majority of the media's cover
age was on local traffic problems
and shots of the stadium, said,
"They're focusing on the actual
games as it should be."
Baron added that with the
large amount of visitors, it was
probable that everyone was im
pressed with the campus and ap
preciated its beauty. He was dis
appointed, however, in the cover
age of the first game because the
media mentioned mainly the
Stanford Stadium instead of the
campus.
Most administrators agree
that holding the World Cup

games on campus is an honor and
adds to Stanford's prestigious
reputation.
"We've held the Super Bowl,
Olympic soccer events and now
the World Cup on campus,"
Smith said. "They're positive
community event builders. It lets
everyone know where Stanford is
located."
For the most part, the admin
istration was pleased and sur
prised with the small amount of
problems that occurred during
the first game. No drastic prob
lems are anticipated and business
in the administration will contin
ue as usual.

getting exasperated
and trying to jump
the line so we got
the Allied SWAT
team and the
Santa Clara
Sheriffs to form a

patrons and the

Restaurants and Hotels
On the economic side, holding
World Cup in Palo Alto has been
a "mixed bag," according to
Susan Frank, executive director
of the Palo Alto Chamber of
Commerce.
"We understand that the
restaurants and bars are doing
really we 11... but that the retail
stores are reporting a lot of

quiet," Frank said. These retail
stores include those at the Stan
ford Shopping Center and down
town Palo Alto.
Dan McGill, manager at Gor
don Biersch Brewery Restaurant,
said that they were "slammed
right after the game [on Mon
day]" but that it was a little too
early to predict how his business
would be affected during the rest
of World Cup. He added that
business on non-game days was
better than usual.
Galen Fletcher, general man
ager at Sundance Mine Co.
Restaurant, reported greater
business as a result of World
Cup. "Last week, we had a 40
percent increase over last year's
business," he said, adding that
many patrons were foreign busi
nessmen and newscast camera
men.
Fletcher also said that his
restaurant hardly had any lunch
business Monday but that busi
ness later on was "all at the bar."
At the popular college hangout
Halftime Sports Cafe, Manager
Juvenal Moreno said that busi
ness was very good Monday, but
that it was "business as usual" on
non-game days.
With the World Cup lasting an
entire month in Palo Alto, one
might expect that the hotels in
the area would be completely
booked and finding a place to stay
would be difficult. Most hotels,
however, still have rooms avail
able.
At the Creekside Inn Best
Western, Night Manager Ruth
Schroeder said, "It (the World
Cup) has made things more inter
esting." She also said that they
have had more of an "interna
tional crowd." However, since
they are more commercial, they
have had more "family-orientat
ed guests," she added.
She also said that unlike other
hotels, Creekside Inn did little
negotiation with large tour
groups.
Booking large tour groups,
which then cancel or fail to show
up, could be one of the reasons
why many of the hotels are not
doing as well as thoy had hoped.

Another reason that the hotels
in Palo Alto may not be doing as
well as expected is that the World
Cup games being played in Stan
ford Stadium have been adver
tised as the "San Francisco
venue." Many ticket holders
spend their days and nights in
San Francisco and then take the
CalTrain to the stadium for the
games.
Kathleen Haney, manager at
the Cardinal Hotel, said that
World Cup fans stay at the hotels
one game at a time. "We have
about eight to ten rooms set aside
for people [going to the games],"
she added.
At the Town & Country Vil
lage, shops and booths were
buzzing with crowds of people
during game day. Beverly Dilling,
manager of Town & Country
Pharmacy, which is selling World
Cup souvenirs, said that non
game sales were comparable to
sales during a typical Christmas
Eve, while business on Monday
"well exceeded" even those num
bers.
Retail Stores
People have been strongly ad
vised through the press not to
drive into Palo Alto on game days
unless it is truly necessary. Busi
ness for the retail stores, there
fore, have not been as bright.
Frank, from the Chamber of
Commerce, said that this fact was
disappointing.
"We are hoping that normal
shoppers would not avoid coming
to Palo Alto on game days,"
Frank stated, adding that "game
traffic did not help retail."
Frank also said that future ef
forts will focus on getting people
to "stick around Palo Alto. . . and
to see that Palo Alto is a wonder
ful place."
At the Stanford Shopping Cen
ter, business was "dead all over"
on Monday, according to Bill
Lives, owner of a men's clothing
and retail store there. He said
that their parking lot was open
only to people attending World
Cup, but that many people either

'It is definitely dif
ficult on World
Cup days because
we're stuck here
and we can't leave.
... It's also not
making any money
for the campus.'
— Nan Bentley

used public transportation or
parked somewhere else that day.
The closing off of the parking lot
alienated local shoppers and
made it unable for them to do
their normal shopping.
Regarding the retail business,
Lives stated, "World Cup did not
help."
These feelings were echoed
word for word by Tim Reising,
manager of another men's cloth
ing and retail store on University
Avenue. He went on to add that
World Cup had "impaired busi
ness" on Monday.
"I think that World Cup is a
good thing for Palo Alto in terms
of exposure, but not for business
es downtown," Reising said.
Expectations versus Results
It has been known for well over a
year that World Cup 94 would be
held at Stanford Stadium. Differ
ent businesses had different ex
pectations and some even made
special preparations for the
event.
Inside the Palo Alto Holiday
Inn, a tent covering 4000 square
feet has been set up especially for
World Cup fans. Here, Rebosio
said that they have been showing
every game live. Plans for this
tent, he added, have been going
on for over a year.
Schroeder, from the Creek
side Inn, said that although she
did not know what to anticipate,
she "expected a little more de
mand." Regarding special prepa
rations for World Cup, she said
that her staff was supplied with
more information and were
trained to answer a barrage of
questions from tourists and tick
et holders. A courtesy shuttle
service has also been provided,
she added.

At the Cardinal Hotel, no spe
cial arrangements have been
made, according to Haney. "We
suspected people would go some
place else, like the city (San Fran
cisco)," she said.
"It's hard to know what to ex
pect," said McGill from Gordon
Biersch. "It's hard to know how
to get involved . . . [because] we
really have nothing to base it on."
At Sundance Mine Co., Fletch
er said that he too did not know
what to expect. Other than extra
security, no special arrangements
were made, he added.
On the other hand, two more
bars have been opened at Half
time Sports Cafe, according to
Moreno.
Festive atmosphere
When asked about the overall
mood or atmosphere after Mon
day's game, many business man
agers mentioned the festive,
party-like atmosphere and also
stressed the spirit of the Brazil
ians.
"It was like a big party," said
Rebosio.
"It was really fun, energetic,
almost like being in another
country," echoed McGill.
Because of the success and
"fun" atmosphere of the first
game, Dilling believes that people
who planned only to attend the
first game will now be looking for
tickets for future games.
"The spirit of the Brazilians
has exceeded any expectations,"
said Dilling. "It felt like we were
in Brazil."

Not only did the first World
Cup game at Stanford
leave the Brazilians happy,
but it left many in the surround
ing community pleased as well.
Security officials, administra
tors and local businesses were
generally satisfied with Mon
day's atmosphere and events and
hope that future games will con
tinue to run as smoothly.
"It has been very positive, very
festive," said Susan Frank, exec
utive director of the Palo Alto
Chamber of Commerce.
Security
Weeks of planning for the World
Cup Soccer games paid off as the
first day went relatively smoothly
with only nine arrests.
"The people were fine ... we
had more problems with the San
Jose State game," Captain
Niemeyer of the Stanford Police
said.
Seven scalpers were arrested
for illegally selling game tickets.
In addition, a citizen was arrest
ed for being drunk in public, and
another was arrested for a traffic
warrant, said Niemeyer.
"The atmosphere was festive,
but there have been no outbreaks
of any violence reported to us
whatsoever," Niemeyer added.
The only serious incident of
the day occurred at 8:40 a.m.
when a pedestrian bridge, which
crossed Nelson road connecting
the media tent to the Stadium at
Gate 5, was knocked down by a
Peninsula Sanitary Service
garbage truck.
"Fortunately nobody was on
or below the bridge at the time of
the incident and there were no in
juries," Niemeyer said.
The Peninsula Sanitary Ser
vice refused to comment on the
incident.
The only other headache for
the local police was getting the
fans off and on the CalTrain be
cause a greater number of people
used the service than expected,
said Palo Alto Police Leuitenant
Jon Hernandez, who is currently
traffic manager for the World
Cup.
Santa Clara county expected
10,000 people to use the train,
when in fact 16,000 people actu
ally did, said Hernandez. Because
of this large number — 5,000
from the San Jose direction and
11,000 from the San Fransisco
direction — not all the fans could
get on the trains after the game,
making many people impatient,
said Hernandez.
"People were getting exasper
ated and trying to jump the line
so we got the Allied SWAT team
and the Santa Clara Sheriffs to

form a wall between the patrons
and the train," Hernandez said.
"They also tried to calm them
down."
Patrol Captain Tom Merson
added, "The problem is not with
people arriving at the game be
cause they arrive at staggered in
tervals, but when they are leav
ing they all get out at once and
want to get in the train at once."
Rita Haskin, supervisor of
public information for CalTrain
said that they are planning to
even the trains out so that most
trains have eight cars instead of
four or 12, which "will help dis
pose the load faster," she said.
"We may also put in one more
train, but we don't have staff and
equipment to put in any more,"
Haskin added.

considerably fewer than on a typ
ical day. The parking availability
was due to the fact that people ex
perimented with other methods
of transportation. Some faculty
and staff members even took the
day off.
"People really did try public
transportation for the first
game," Veronin said. "We'll see if
they shift their mode of trans
portation."
Although the majority of fac
ulty and staff members felt that
holding the World Cup on cam
pus was not a problem, others
found it aggravating and some
what disruptive.
"It is definitely difficult on
World Cup days because we're
stuck here and we can't leave,"
said Nan Bentley, administrator
for the history department. "It's
also not making any money for
the campus."
Several members of the ad
ministration remarked that it
was disappointing that the cam
pus and Palo Alto were not re
ceiving the recognition they de
served. Instead, many believe the
media is focusing more on the
traffic and accident reports. Oth
ers are upset that Palo Alto has
been associated as a part of San
Francisco and hasn't been recog
nized as an individual city.
"The World Cup is not helping
Stanford's image because all of
the banners say San Francisco,"
Bentley said.
Veronin, who observed that
the majority of the media's cover
age was on local traffic problems
and shots of the stadium, said,
"They're focusing on the actual
games as it should be."
Baron added that with the
large amount of visitors, it was
probable that everyone was im
pressed with the campus and ap
preciated its beauty. He was dis
appointed, however, in the cover
age of the first game because the
media mentioned mainly the
Stanford Stadium instead of the
campus.
Most administrators agree
that holding the World Cup

games on campus is an honor and
adds to Stanford's prestigious
reputation.
"We've held the Super Bowl,
Olympic soccer events and now
the World Cup on campus,"
Smith said. "They're positive
community event builders. It lets
everyone know where Stanford is
located."
For the most part, the admin
istration was pleased and sur
prised with the small amount of
problems that occurred during
the first game. No drastic prob
lems are anticipated and business
in the administration will contin
ue as usual.

Restaurants and Hotels
On the economic side, holding
World Cup in Palo Alto has been
a "mixed bag," according to
Susan Frank, executive director
of the Palo Alto Chamber of
Commerce.
"We understand that the
restaurants and bars are doing
really we 11... but that the retail
stores are reporting a lot of

quiet," Frank said. These retail
stores include those at the Stan
ford Shopping Center and down
town Palo Alto.
Dan McGill, manager at Gor
don Biersch Brewery Restaurant,
said that they were "slammed
right after the game [on Mon
day]" but that it was a little too
early to predict how his business
would be affected during the rest
of World Cup. He added that
business on non-game days was
better than usual.
Galen Fletcher, general man
ager at Sundance Mine Co.
Restaurant, reported greater
business as a result of World
Cup. "Last week, we had a 40
percent increase over last year's
business," he said, adding that
many patrons were foreign busi
nessmen and newscast camera
men.
Fletcher also said that his
restaurant hardly had any lunch
business Monday but that busi
ness later on was "all at the bar."
At the popular college hangout
Halftime Sports Cafe, Manager
Juvenal Moreno said that busi
ness was very good Monday, but
that it was "business as usual" on
non-game days.
With the World Cup lasting an
entire month in Palo Alto, one
might expect that the hotels in
the area would be completely
booked and finding a place to stay
would be difficult. Most hotels,
however, still have rooms avail
able.
At the Creekside Inn Best
Western, Night Manager Ruth
Schroeder said, "It (the World
Cup) has made things more inter
esting." She also said that they
have had more of an "interna
tional crowd." However, since
they are more commercial, they
have had more "family-orientat
ed guests," she added.
She also said that unlike other
hotels, Creekside Inn did little
negotiation with large tour
groups.
Booking large tour groups,
which then cancel or fail to show
up, could be one of the reasons
why many of the hotels are not
doing as well as thoy had hoped.

Another reason that the hotels
in Palo Alto may not be doing as
well as expected is that the World
Cup games being played in Stan
ford Stadium have been adver
tised as the "San Francisco
venue." Many ticket holders
spend their days and nights in
San Francisco and then take the
CalTrain to the stadium for the
games.
Kathleen Haney, manager at
the Cardinal Hotel, said that
World Cup fans stay at the hotels
one game at a time. "We have
about eight to ten rooms set aside
for people [going to the games],"
she added.
At the Town & Country Vil
lage, shops and booths were
buzzing with crowds of people
during game day. Beverly Dilling,
manager of Town & Country
Pharmacy, which is selling World
Cup souvenirs, said that non
game sales were comparable to
sales during a typical Christmas
Eve, while business on Monday
"well exceeded" even those num
bers.
Retail Stores
People have been strongly ad
vised through the press not to
drive into Palo Alto on game days
unless it is truly necessary. Busi
ness for the retail stores, there
fore, have not been as bright.
Frank, from the Chamber of
Commerce, said that this fact was
disappointing.
"We are hoping that normal
shoppers would not avoid coming
to Palo Alto on game days,"
Frank stated, adding that "game
traffic did not help retail."
Frank also said that future ef
forts will focus on getting people
to "stick around Palo Alto. . . and
to see that Palo Alto is a wonder
ful place."
At the Stanford Shopping Cen
ter, business was "dead all over"
on Monday, according to Bill
Lives, owner of a men's clothing
and retail store there. He said
that their parking lot was open
only to people attending World
Cup, but that many people either

'It is definitely dif
ficult on World
Cup days because
we're stuck here
and we can't leave.
... It's also not
making any money
for the campus.'
— Nan Bentley

used public transportation or
parked somewhere else that day.
The closing off of the parking lot
alienated local shoppers and
made it unable for them to do
their normal shopping.
Regarding the retail business,
Lives stated, "World Cup did not
help."
These feelings were echoed
word for word by Tim Reising,
manager of another men's cloth
ing and retail store on University
Avenue. He went on to add that
World Cup had "impaired busi
ness" on Monday.
"I think that World Cup is a
good thing for Palo Alto in terms
of exposure, but not for business
es downtown," Reising said.
Expectations versus Results
It has been known for well over a
year that World Cup 94 would be
held at Stanford Stadium. Differ
ent businesses had different ex
pectations and some even made
special preparations for the
event.
Inside the Palo Alto Holiday
Inn, a tent covering 4000 square
feet has been set up especially for
World Cup fans. Here, Rebosio
said that they have been showing
every game live. Plans for this
tent, he added, have been going
on for over a year.
Schroeder, from the Creek
side Inn, said that although she
did not know what to anticipate,
she "expected a little more de
mand." Regarding special prepa
rations for World Cup, she said
that her staff was supplied with
more information and were
trained to answer a barrage of
questions from tourists and tick
et holders. A courtesy shuttle
service has also been provided,
she added.

At the Cardinal Hotel, no spe
cial arrangements have been
made, according to Haney. "We
suspected people would go some
place else, like the city (San Fran
cisco)," she said.
"It's hard to know what to ex
pect," said McGill from Gordon
Biersch. "It's hard to know how
to get involved . . . [because] we
really have nothing to base it on."
At Sundance Mine Co., Fletch
er said that he too did not know
what to expect. Other than extra
security, no special arrangements
were made, he added.
On the other hand, two more
bars have been opened at Half
time Sports Cafe, according to
Moreno.
Festive atmosphere
When asked about the overall
mood or atmosphere after Mon
day's game, many business man
agers mentioned the festive,
party-like atmosphere and also
stressed the spirit of the Brazil
ians.
"It was like a big party," said
Rebosio.
"It was really fun, energetic,
almost like being in another
country," echoed McGill.
Because of the success and
"fun" atmosphere of the first
game, Dilling believes that people
who planned only to attend the
first game will now be looking for
tickets for future games.
"The spirit of the Brazilians
has exceeded any expectations,"
said Dilling. "It felt like we were
in Brazil."
