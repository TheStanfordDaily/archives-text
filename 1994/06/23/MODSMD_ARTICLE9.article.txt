### Frank Guinan Editorial staff 
Four of the six athletes charged with vandalism
of the "Gay Liberation" sculpture were arraigned
yesterday at the Palo Alto Municipal Court. All
chose to plea at a later date.
Junior Todd Laßocca, facing a charge of felony
vandalism, appeared alongside his attorney. His
case will be put up for superior court review on July
18, and he will enter a plea of not guilty, guilty or no
contest on July 21.
The other athlete charged with felony vandalism
is junior Thomas Irwin, who did not appear in
court. He will be arraigned on July 1 and will join
Laßocca for the superior court review.
If convicted, Laßocca and Irwin face a maximum
sentence of jail or prison and up to a $10,000 fine
along with an order to pay restitution.
According to Karyn Sinunu, deputy district at
torney for Santa Clara County, a superior court re
view turns a case over to a superior court judge, and
the defendant is advised as to what will happen if he
or she were to plead guilty.
Sophomores Robert Gardner and Jason White
and junior Mark Butterfield all had attorneys rep
resent them at the arraignment. Each is charged
with a misdemeanor for vandalism and for resisting
arrest after allegedly running away from police on
the night of the incident. All three will enter a plea
on July 25.
Sophomore Brian Dallimore, who shares the
same charges as Gardner, White and Butterfield,

initially evaded police the night of the alleged crime.
His arraignment is scheduled for July 25. All four
face possible jail time and up to $10,000 in fines if
convicted.
Future arraignments and plea hearings are all
scheduled to be held at the Palo Alto Municipal
Court.
The six athletes had allegedly vandalized
George Segal's sculpture by ramming a bench be
tween two of the figures and pouring black paint
on the white-coated bronze statues on the night of
May 16. Police had found the sculpture vandalized
around 2 a.m. the next morning. Repairs to the
sculpture have been estimated to cost more than
$8000.
Laßocca and Irwin face felony charges because
they were responsible for most of the damages,
Stanford Police Detective Tim Schreiner said in an
earlier statement.
Laßocca and Gardner are both members of the
Cardinal baseball team. White and Butterfield are
on the football roster, and Irwin is a wrestler. All
athletes have served suspensions from their respec
tive teams.
According to police reports released last month,
all the athletes admitted to drinking alcohol prior to
the alleged crime.
The vandalism of the sculpture had touched off
an outbreak of emotion last month. Statements
were given by many prominent people on campus,
ranging from representatives from the Lesbian,
Gay, and Bisexual Community Center to Head
Football Coach Bill Walsh.
