Can the world's favorite soccer
team withstand the exaltation of a
U.S. team that plays not only to
win, but also to defend American
national pride on July 4?

The odds are
heavily in favor of ,

Brazil. The South
American team
features a solid

defense with star
sweeper Dunga
eliminating any
chances for the op
posing team to

score. The Brazilian de
fense proved itself in the first round
by allowing only one goal against a
tough Swedish team and holding
Russia and Cameroon scoreless.
Brazil has a superior midfield, led
by Bebeto and Raf, that keeps care
ful possession of the ball and avoids
inaccurate passing.
As the star midfielders generate
the attacks, they are usually fin
ished by Romario — the game's
most dangerous and accurate
striker.
Despite their strengths, the
Brazilian team has yet to really
prove to be the team everyone ex
pected. The squad beat the
mediocre teams of Russia and
Cameroon but could manage only
to tie a better Swedish squad.
It is possible to shut down

Brazil with strong and smart de
fense and forwards that can take
advantage of short scoring oppor
tunities. Both of these characteris
tics belong to the U.S. team.

The U.S. has a
tough defense fea-

Turing defenders
Alexi Lalas and
Thomas Dooley

that has allowed
only three goals in
the first three
games against the
potent teams from

Colombia, Switzer
land and Romania. The American
scorers, while not prolific, have
shown they answer the call of pres
sure.
The midfield provided the play
making talent needed for the huge
win against another pre-tourna
ment favorite Colombia. The loss
of John Harkes due to two first
round yellow cards is unfortunate,
but the USA plays collective soc
cer. The loss of one star, even one
of Harkes' caliber, will not make a
crucial difference.
Although the team will have to
rebound from a disappointing loss
to Romania in the last game of
Round 1, if each player in red,
white and blue plays their best,
fireworks may come early to Stan
ford on July 4.
