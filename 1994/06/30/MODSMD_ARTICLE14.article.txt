# Colombia records victory to take home
## 
### Rob Ross Editorial staff 
In an exercise in saving face
rather than one involving sec
ond-round advancement,
Colombia (1-2-0) defeated
Switzerland (1-1-1) on Sunday
by the score of 2-0, thereby

adding some light to what has
been a hideously bleak World
Cup for the Colombians.
With 83,769 fans packed into
the stands (the largest crowd
ever to watch a soccer game at
Stanford Stadium, surpassing
the previous mark set during
the 1984 Olympics), the South

American team atoned for loss
es to Romania and the United
States in their initial first
round matches. And while,
even with the victory, the
Colombian team will not ad
vance into the second round,
the win does mediate the sting
of unfulfilled expectations.
Well, maybe it doesn't.
"Going into the Cup, every
thing looked ready to go," said
Colombian forward Faustino
Asprilla. "But things are totally
different once you go on the
field. Although we are ashamed
of our performance, we have to
go on. This is not the end of the
world, either."
Perhaps not the end of the
world, but it is the end of Cup
dreams for a squad that went
unbeaten since 1992 (10-0-9)
and was considered a dark
horse to win the entire tourna
ment.
The Colombian team that
arrived at Stanford Stadium on
Tuesday looked more like the
squad that decimated Argenti
na 5-0 in Buenos Aires in Sep
tember than the discombobu
lated group that was humiliat
ed by the U.S. last Thursday 2-
0. With forwards Asprilla and
Jose Adolfo Valencia running

fenders and midfielder Carlos
Valderrama handling the ball
like it was attached to his foot
