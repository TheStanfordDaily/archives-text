# Colombia records victory to take home
## 
### Rob Ross Editorial staff 
In an exercise in saving face
rather than one involving sec
ond-round advancement,
Colombia (1-2-0) defeated
Switzerland (1-1-1) on Sunday
by the score of 2-0, thereby

adding some light to what has
been a hideously bleak World
Cup for the Colombians.
With 83,769 fans packed into
the stands (the largest crowd
ever to watch a soccer game at
Stanford Stadium, surpassing
the previous mark set during
the 1984 Olympics), the South

American team atoned for loss
es to Romania and the United
States in their initial first
round matches. And while,
even with the victory, the
Colombian team will not ad
vance into the second round,
the win does mediate the sting
of unfulfilled expectations.
Well, maybe it doesn't.
"Going into the Cup, every
thing looked ready to go," said
Colombian forward Faustino
Asprilla. "But things are totally
different once you go on the
field. Although we are ashamed
of our performance, we have to
go on. This is not the end of the
world, either."
Perhaps not the end of the
world, but it is the end of Cup
dreams for a squad that went
unbeaten since 1992 (10-0-9)
and was considered a dark
horse to win the entire tourna
ment.
The Colombian team that
arrived at Stanford Stadium on
Tuesday looked more like the
squad that decimated Argenti
na 5-0 in Buenos Aires in Sep
tember than the discombobu
lated group that was humiliat
ed by the U.S. last Thursday 2-
0. With forwards Asprilla and

the South Americans controlled
the match tempo from the kickoff.
Behind the brilliant ball han
dling of midfielders Valderrama
and Fredy Ricon, the South Amer
icans' dominance of the middle of
the field was established in the
opening minutes. But this perpet
ual attack was in turn nullified by
Swiss goalkeeper Marco Pascolo.
Pascolo's presence in the cen
ter of the net kept the Colombians

at bay for almost the entire first
half. But in the 44th minute a
Valderrama forearm shiver that
went completely unnoticed by the
officials knocked Swiss midfielder
Ciriaco Sforza to the turf. Sforva
lay there as the Colombians con
tinued their attack and an indi
rect kick from Valderrama to Her
man Gaviria led to the first goal of
the game. Gaviria was the player
Sforza was assigned to mark.
The second half seemed more
for show than serious competi
tion. With the USA losing to Ro
mania, the Swiss knew that even a
loss would put them into the sec

ond round. Strong, aggressive
play would not only put them at
the mercy of the potent Colom
bian counter-attack, but perhaps
into the jaws of a 3-0 loss and a
third-place finish in Group A.
The South American team did
score another goal, though, as the
final seconds were ticking away. A
90th-minute missed shot by
Stephane Chapuisat was sped the
opposite way. A touch pass from
Asprialla to substitute forward
Harold Lozano was put into the
corner of the net and the game
was sealed as a 2-0 Colombian vic
tory.
