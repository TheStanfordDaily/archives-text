Oleg Salenko picked up the en
tire Russian soccer team on his
back and carried them to a 6-1 win
over Cameroon and perhaps into a
second-round match on Tuesday.
Salenko, Russia's starting striker,
scored five of his squad's six goals,

thereby smashing the 40-year-old
record for individual goals in a sin
gle World Cup game.
The victory gavethird place to a
Russian team that looked hapless
in its first two Cup losses to Brazil
and Sweeden. Moreover, by scoring
six goals the squad ended its first
round with a +1 goals scored/goals
