### Rob Ross Editorial staff 
Oleg Salenko picked up the en
tire Russian soccer team on his
back and carried them to a 6-1 win
over Cameroon and perhaps into a
second-round match on Tuesday.
Salenko, Russia's starting striker,
scored five of his squad's six goals,

thereby smashing the 40-year-old
record for individual goals in a sin
gle World Cup game.
The victory gavethird place to a
Russian team that looked hapless
in its first two Cup losses to Brazil
and Sweeden. Moreover, by scoring
six goals the squad ended its first
round with a +1 goals scored/goals
against differential, which may be
good enough to let the team slip into
the second round.
The Indomitable Lions of

Cameroon, on the other hand, ended
a disappointing 1994 World Cup with
a humiliating defeat.
The story of the match, was
Salenko. In his No. 9 jersey Salenko
scored in the 16th, 41st, 45th, 73rd
and 75th minutes ofTuesday's game.
He even assisted on his team's last
goal, which was poked into the corner

of the net by Dimitri Radchenko.
In the second half Cameroon's
coach Henri Michel subbed in aging
superstar Roger Milla at forward.
The move paid early dividends, as
Milla scored in the 47th minute to
narrow the gap to 3-1. At 44 years old,
Milla became the oldest player to
score a goal in a World Cup match.
