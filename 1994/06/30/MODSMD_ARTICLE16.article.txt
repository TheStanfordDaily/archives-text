# What to do?
## An entertainment guide for Palo Alto and the Bay Area 
### Angie Chuang Staff writer 
After the final moments of the
game have ended, you can cele
brate the victory, in both Palo Alto
and San Francisco. Combined, the
two cities harbor ample theaters,
restaurants, bars and night clubs.
Palo Alto
Just off-campus, you will find
bars and movie theaters, the two
most abundant forms of night life
in Palo Alto and its vicinity. Both
reflect its small-town, suburban
atmosphere.
Stanford hangouts lean toward
the crowded beer-and-burger
joints, epitomized by The Oasis on
El Camino. Even the walls are
greasy at this loud and friendly
place, which frequently broadcasts
Stanford sporting events.
For a slightly more subdued at
mosphere, try The Stanford Pub
on Emerson, well known for its
burgers. Another quintessential
Stanford haunt, the Dutch Goose
in Menlo Park (on Alameda de Las
Pulgas) is affectionately referred
to as "The Goose."
With regard to movie theaters,
University Avenue and there
abouts remain a bastion of the
quaint and the alternative. The
Stanford Theater (University),
known for reincarnating on screen
Bogey, Hepburn, Grant, Davis and
many other classic stars, has be
come a favorite place to wax nos
talgic.
If you enjoy quality foreign
films, check out the Aquarius on
Emerson. The Varsity (Universi
ty) shows more popular "artsy"
flicks, as well as "The Rocky Hor
ror Picture Show" — complete
with a live, unsolicited cast — Fri
days and Saturdays at midnight.

Though the "Rocky Horror" is a
great burlesque experience, the
Varsity's shows tend to be a little
bit less rambunctious and outra
geous than the one at Berkeley's
UC Theater.
Hollywood box office hits run at
the two-screen Palo Alto Square
(El Camino at Page Mill) and the
multi-multi-Bcreen Century 10 in
Mountain View (Shoreline Blvd.).
Century-10 goers beware, though:
on weekends, the place is overrun
by hordes of local residents.
Dance clubs options in Palo Alto
are limited, but The Edge (Califor-

nia) is about as
dance-clubby as
they get. An 18-
and-over mod
ern/alternative
rock club, the
Edge usually
draws a young
and sometimes
predominantly
high-school
crowd, but the
atmosphere is
lively and
friendly. The
Edge also regu
larly hosts live
bands and at
times attracts

reasonably big-name groups and
artists.
L.A. Fox (El Camino) offers
dancing to Top-40 tunes in a bar
like setting. Cross the Bayshore
Freeway to East Palo Alto and
you'll find Club Afrique (O'Con
nor), which plays an international
range of music from reggae to
salsa.
Although live music venues
aren't abundant in Palo Alto, the
few local clubs tend to offer more
intimate atmospheres than clubs
in San Francisco.

One such venue, Cafe Mont
martre (University), features local
favorite "The Basics," an acoustic
based group, as well as other
artists in a chic setting. St.
Michael's Alley (Emerson) also of
fers a good sampling of local musi
cians, and is open every night.
Jazz aficionados can check out
The Gatehouse (Lytton) and
Jose's Caribbean Restaurant (El
Camino). For those who prefer a
little international flavor, Jose's
also has samba, salsa and reggae
nights.
A few small companies headline

local theater,
most notably
Theatre Works,
which performs
in Mountain
View and Palo
Alto, and the his
toric Palo Alto
Players Guild,
which takes the
stage at the
Lucie Stern The
ater (Middle
field).
San Francisco
If Palo
Alto seeming a

bit too small, San
Francisco offers an array of enter
tainment as diverse as its many
districts.
While there are no cut-and-dry
boundaries, each area of The City
has its own distinctive character,
and its establishments reflect this.
Even a compilation of "War and
Peace" proportions could not cover
all of the great bars, clubs and
venues in The City, so the best way
to go is to pick a district and ex
plore.
Market and North of Market
If there exists a "main drag" in
San Francisco, it's the ever-busy
Market Street, which cuts a neat
diagonal slash across the east side
of The City. The section of Market
between the Civic Center (Van
Ness) and the downtown/financial
district area (Battery) is usually
considered the cultural center of
the city.
Civic Center features all the up
percrust entertainment an intel
lectual could ask for, including the
City's opera company, and sym
phony and ballet venues, all locat
ed on Van Ness Avenue.
An amalgam of financial district
yuppies, city politicians and young
people from all over the Bay Area
mingle in the clubs lining Market
and north of Market.
Perhaps San Francisco's most
high-profile live music venue, The
Warfield (Sixth and Market) at
tracts big names and gig crowds,
and has no minimum-age require
ment for admission. A few blocks
north of Civic Center, The Great
American Music Hall (O'Farrell
near Polk) tends to have slightly
more off-beat billings, but is well
attended.
A paradox brought to life, The
Upper Room (Grove at Market) is
the City's first alcohol and tobacco
free nightclub. The music tends to
ward rap and Top 40 rhythm and
blues.
The place for jazz is Kimball's
(Grove at Market), a club as popu
lar as its star-laden billings. North
of downtown heading into North
Beach, Pearl's (Columbus near
Broadway) approaches Kimball's
legendary status.
One of the City's largest dance
clubs, The Palladium draws a
young 18-and-over crowd and
plays modern rock into the wee
hours of the morning. The Palladi
um attracts some big-name Bay
Area DJs, but like many main
stream dance clubs, tends to be
somewhat of a meat market.
San Francisco's most famous
comedians perform at The Improv
(Mason near Geary, north of Mar
ket) and The Punch Line (Battery

between Washington and Clay).
Though not in the downtown area,
Cobb's Comedy Club on Fisher
man's Wharf completes the main
stream comedy triumvirate.
To see one of the most
renowned regional theater compa
nies, head over to San Francisco's
American Conservatory Theater
(Geary at Mason). The talented
and increasingly diversified com
pany performs a range of works,
from the classic to the modern, as
well as seasonal traditions such as
the annual run of "A Christmas
Carol."
South of Market
South of Market is at least as
colorful and

lively as its
Manhattan
counterpart,
South of Hous
ton Street. Like
SoHo, the
young offbeat
tend to flock to
SoMa, and the
community's
diversity is
amazing.
Gays and
straights of all
races and class
es convene at
South of Mar
ket for its dis
tinctive quality
night life. Live
music venues
abound, often
attracting top
billings in addi
tion to up-and-

coming local bands. The only
drawbacks are high cover charges,
and strict 21 -and-over policies.
A long-standing City favorite,
Slim's (11th between Folsom and
Garrison) always packs a crowd in
with its impressive billings. The
DNA Lounge (11th near Folsom)
and the Paradise Lounge (11th
and Folsom) are also popular spots
for live pop, punk and hip-hop.
Very South of Market lies a
cozy, dark, bouncer-free little bar
called Bottom of the Hill (17th at
Texas), which hosts local bands
and has good beer, like Anchor
Steam and Red Hook, on tap at
great prices.
If you are looking to shake your
thang in The City, South of Market
boasts one of the largest concen
trations of 18-and-over dance
clubs. You can dance with a view of
the stars at DVB (Howard between
Ist and 2nd), which features an ul
tramodern dance-floor design and
modern rock, house music and
disco to match.
Other well-known dance clubs
include Club Mirage (Kansas at Di
vision), and The X (Harrison at
3rd), which plays modern rock or
hip-hop, depending on the night. If
you long to whip out those bell-bot
toms and tromp around in plat
form clogs, Club 1970 (Howard be
tween 2nd and 3rd), though not
the institution it is in Los Angele l3 ,
will provide a disco fix.
South of Market is often charac
terized as a gay-but-not-exclusive
ly-gay neighborhood, as reflected
by many of its establishments.
Perhaps more than any other
neighborhood, gays and straights
party together without obvious
separations.
Ask San Franciscans to name a
gay bar, and they'll probably tell

South of Market is at
least as colorful and
lively as its Manhattan
counterpart, South of
Houston Street. Like
SoHo, the young off
beat tend to flock to
SoMa, and the com
munity's diversity is
amazina.

you about the unmistakably green,
wooden building that looks like an
old-West saloon, The Stud (9th
and Harrison). This bar and dance
club is a big, boisterous place
where you'll find a fairly mixed
crowd of men and women, gays
and straights. The Elbo Room (Va
lencia at 20th) has a similar atmos
phere, as well as quality live per
formances.
Slightly more hard-core, The
EndUp (6th and Harrison) holds
Girlspot on Saturday (for women)
and Club Uranus (for men), com
plete with male go-go dancers on
Sundays.
Part comedy routine and part
theatrical dramatization, the acts

at Josie's
Cabaret and
Juice Joint
(16th Market)
veer away from
the main
stream and
into the hilari
ously bizarre.
The humor
often has a gay
theme, but is
by all means
accessible to
everyone, as
the mixed au
dience that
packs the place
attests.
Queer
drama has
reached almost
legendary sta
tus in The
City, and
there's no bet-

ter place to see it than at Theater
Rhinoceros (16th near Mission),
which features constantly chang
ing shows that range from ribald
comedies to intense, issue-orient
ed pieces.
If you want to catch the latest
independent, political or otherwise
hard-to-find films, The Roxie
(16th at Valencia) is a small but
cutting-edge movie house that has
definitely carved a niche of its own.
And if you like the feeling of
power you get from strutting
around a pool table wielding a cue
stick, The Great Entertainer
(Bryant and Kate) has about 30 ta
bles — easily the largest pool bar in
The City.
The Castro
San Francisco's largest gay
neighborhood, the Castro, with its
infamous, steep hills and quaint
Victorians, attracts many of the
city's young college graduates,
both gay and straight.
Entertainment in the Castro is
as colorful as the area, with its
rainbow-colored Freedom Flags
waving and its seemingly never
ending activity. Bars in this area
tend to be smaller and cozier than
South of Market's warehouse-like
joints.
Famous for providing a wonder
ful venue for unique acts, ranging
from belly dancers to torch singers
to jazz bands, Cafe Du Nord (Mar
ket at Sanchez) has San Francis
cans singing the praises of its
"Cabaret Du Nord" shows. Be
ware, however, of its strict enforce
ment of the 21-and-over policy.
There are many single-gender,
mostly men-only bars in the heart
of the Castro, but The Elephant

The War Memorial Opera House,
located directly across the
street from City Hall, is one of
many buildings that mark Market
Street.


Patrick Tower — Daily file
The neighborhood surrounding Castro street is characterized by
many Victorian buildings and steep hills.
Walk (24th near Castro) is proba
bly the friendliest, most gender-di
verse bar in that area.
If you like the cozy atmos
pheres of small bars, but can't
stand to just sit around, Cork'N
Bottle (24th near Castro) is a fun,
friendly, not-too-crowded joint
equipped with a pool table (and
some pretty amazing pool sharks),
dart boards, a pinball machine
and, yes, even a slot machine.
North of the Castro lies a fa
vorite live music venue, The Ken
nel Club (Divisadero and Hayes),
which hosts Club ! for women and
The Box for mixed crowds on dif
ferent nights.
Located in the very center of
the Castro's liveliest areas, The
Castro Theater (Castro between
17th and 18th) shows non-main

stream, independent and reperto
ry films.
The Haight
Officially called "The Haight-
Ashbury District," the area
around Golden Gate Park's Pan
handle has the reputation of an ec
centric little neighborhood that
never made it out of the 60s.
Sure enough, the place brims
with aging flower children — often
driving painted Volkswagen Bugs
and vans — neo-hippies and poor,
struggling college graduates. Per
fect for exploring, the streets are
lined with countless quaint little
cafes, restaurants and bars, many
with an ethnic feel. More so than
beer, coffee is the drink of choice
in the Haight.
Several clubs headline in the
Haight, including Club
Boomerang (Haight near Cole).
But most people know the Red Vic
for its scrumptious popcorn,
served in bowls with condiments.

martre (University), features local
favorite "The Basics," an acoustic
based group, as well as other
artists in a chic setting. St.
Michael's Alley (Emerson) also of
fers a good sampling of local musi
cians, and is open every night.
Jazz aficionados can check out
The Gatehouse (Lytton) and
Jose's Caribbean Restaurant (El
Camino). For those who prefer a
little international flavor, Jose's
also has samba, salsa and reggae
nights.
A few small companies headline

local theater,
most notably
Theatre Works,
which performs
in Mountain
View and Palo
Alto, and the his
toric Palo Alto
Players Guild,
which takes the
stage at the
Lucie Stern The
ater (Middle
field).
San Francisco
If Palo
Alto seeming a

bit too small, San
Francisco offers an array of enter
tainment as diverse as its many
districts.
While there are no cut-and-dry
boundaries, each area of The City
has its own distinctive character,
and its establishments reflect this.
Even a compilation of "War and
Peace" proportions could not cover
all of the great bars, clubs and
venues in The City, so the best way
to go is to pick a district and ex
plore.
Market and North of Market
If there exists a "main drag" in
San Francisco, it's the ever-busy
Market Street, which cuts a neat
diagonal slash across the east side
of The City. The section of Market
between the Civic Center (Van
Ness) and the downtown/financial
district area (Battery) is usually
considered the cultural center of
the city.
Civic Center features all the up
percrust entertainment an intel
lectual could ask for, including the
City's opera company, and sym
phony and ballet venues, all locat
ed on Van Ness Avenue.
An amalgam of financial district
yuppies, city politicians and young
people from all over the Bay Area
mingle in the clubs lining Market
and north of Market.
Perhaps San Francisco's most
high-profile live music venue, The
Warfield (Sixth and Market) at
tracts big names and gig crowds,
and has no minimum-age require
ment for admission. A few blocks
north of Civic Center, The Great
American Music Hall (O'Farrell
near Polk) tends to have slightly
more off-beat billings, but is well
attended.
A paradox brought to life, The
Upper Room (Grove at Market) is
the City's first alcohol and tobacco
free nightclub. The music tends to
ward rap and Top 40 rhythm and
blues.
The place for jazz is Kimball's
(Grove at Market), a club as popu
lar as its star-laden billings. North
of downtown heading into North
Beach, Pearl's (Columbus near
Broadway) approaches Kimball's
legendary status.
One of the City's largest dance
clubs, The Palladium draws a
young 18-and-over crowd and
plays modern rock into the wee
hours of the morning. The Palladi
um attracts some big-name Bay
Area DJs, but like many main
stream dance clubs, tends to be
somewhat of a meat market.
San Francisco's most famous
comedians perform at The Improv
(Mason near Geary, north of Mar
ket) and The Punch Line (Battery

between Washington and Clay).
Though not in the downtown area,
Cobb's Comedy Club on Fisher
man's Wharf completes the main
stream comedy triumvirate.
To see one of the most
renowned regional theater compa
nies, head over to San Francisco's
American Conservatory Theater
(Geary at Mason). The talented
and increasingly diversified com
pany performs a range of works,
from the classic to the modern, as
well as seasonal traditions such as
the annual run of "A Christmas
Carol."
South of Market
South of Market is at least as
colorful and

lively as its
Manhattan
counterpart,
South of Hous
ton Street. Like
SoHo, the
young offbeat
tend to flock to
SoMa, and the
community's
diversity is
amazing.
Gays and
straights of all
races and class
es convene at
South of Mar
ket for its dis
tinctive quality
night life. Live
music venues
abound, often
attracting top
billings in addi
tion to up-and-

coming local bands. The only
drawbacks are high cover charges,
and strict 21 -and-over policies.
A long-standing City favorite,
Slim's (11th between Folsom and
Garrison) always packs a crowd in
with its impressive billings. The
DNA Lounge (11th near Folsom)
and the Paradise Lounge (11th
and Folsom) are also popular spots
for live pop, punk and hip-hop.
Very South of Market lies a
cozy, dark, bouncer-free little bar
called Bottom of the Hill (17th at
Texas), which hosts local bands
and has good beer, like Anchor
Steam and Red Hook, on tap at
great prices.
If you are looking to shake your
thang in The City, South of Market
boasts one of the largest concen
trations of 18-and-over dance
clubs. You can dance with a view of
the stars at DVB (Howard between
Ist and 2nd), which features an ul
tramodern dance-floor design and
modern rock, house music and
disco to match.
Other well-known dance clubs
include Club Mirage (Kansas at Di
vision), and The X (Harrison at
3rd), which plays modern rock or
hip-hop, depending on the night. If
you long to whip out those bell-bot
toms and tromp around in plat
form clogs, Club 1970 (Howard be
tween 2nd and 3rd), though not
the institution it is in Los Angele l3 ,
will provide a disco fix.
South of Market is often charac
terized as a gay-but-not-exclusive
ly-gay neighborhood, as reflected
by many of its establishments.
Perhaps more than any other
neighborhood, gays and straights
party together without obvious
separations.
Ask San Franciscans to name a
gay bar, and they'll probably tell

South of Market is at
least as colorful and
lively as its Manhattan
counterpart, South of
Houston Street. Like
SoHo, the young off
beat tend to flock to
SoMa, and the com
munity's diversity is
amazina.

you about the unmistakably green,
wooden building that looks like an
old-West saloon, The Stud (9th
and Harrison). This bar and dance
club is a big, boisterous place
where you'll find a fairly mixed
crowd of men and women, gays
and straights. The Elbo Room (Va
lencia at 20th) has a similar atmos
phere, as well as quality live per
formances.
Slightly more hard-core, The
EndUp (6th and Harrison) holds
Girlspot on Saturday (for women)
and Club Uranus (for men), com
plete with male go-go dancers on
Sundays.
Part comedy routine and part
theatrical dramatization, the acts

at Josie's
Cabaret and
Juice Joint
(16th Market)
veer away from
the main
stream and
into the hilari
ously bizarre.
The humor
often has a gay
theme, but is
by all means
accessible to
everyone, as
the mixed au
dience that
packs the place
attests.
Queer
drama has
reached almost
legendary sta
tus in The
City, and
there's no bet-

ter place to see it than at Theater
Rhinoceros (16th near Mission),
which features constantly chang
ing shows that range from ribald
comedies to intense, issue-orient
ed pieces.
If you want to catch the latest
independent, political or otherwise
hard-to-find films, The Roxie
(16th at Valencia) is a small but
cutting-edge movie house that has
definitely carved a niche of its own.
And if you like the feeling of
power you get from strutting
around a pool table wielding a cue
stick, The Great Entertainer
(Bryant and Kate) has about 30 ta
bles — easily the largest pool bar in
The City.
The Castro
San Francisco's largest gay
neighborhood, the Castro, with its
infamous, steep hills and quaint
Victorians, attracts many of the
city's young college graduates,
both gay and straight.
Entertainment in the Castro is
as colorful as the area, with its
rainbow-colored Freedom Flags
waving and its seemingly never
ending activity. Bars in this area
tend to be smaller and cozier than
South of Market's warehouse-like
joints.
Famous for providing a wonder
ful venue for unique acts, ranging
from belly dancers to torch singers
to jazz bands, Cafe Du Nord (Mar
ket at Sanchez) has San Francis
cans singing the praises of its
"Cabaret Du Nord" shows. Be
ware, however, of its strict enforce
ment of the 21-and-over policy.
There are many single-gender,
mostly men-only bars in the heart
of the Castro, but The Elephant

The neighborhood surrounding Castro street is characterized by
many Victorian buildings and steep hills.
Walk (24th near Castro) is proba
bly the friendliest, most gender-di
verse bar in that area.
If you like the cozy atmos
pheres of small bars, but can't
stand to just sit around, Cork'N
Bottle (24th near Castro) is a fun,
friendly, not-too-crowded joint
equipped with a pool table (and
some pretty amazing pool sharks),
dart boards, a pinball machine
and, yes, even a slot machine.
North of the Castro lies a fa
vorite live music venue, The Ken
nel Club (Divisadero and Hayes),
which hosts Club ! for women and
The Box for mixed crowds on dif
ferent nights.
Located in the very center of
the Castro's liveliest areas, The
Castro Theater (Castro between
17th and 18th) shows non-main

stream, independent and reperto
ry films.
The Haight
Officially called "The Haight-
Ashbury District," the area
around Golden Gate Park's Pan
handle has the reputation of an ec
centric little neighborhood that
never made it out of the 60s.
Sure enough, the place brims
with aging flower children — often
driving painted Volkswagen Bugs
and vans — neo-hippies and poor,
struggling college graduates. Per
fect for exploring, the streets are
lined with countless quaint little
cafes, restaurants and bars, many
with an ethnic feel. More so than
beer, coffee is the drink of choice
in the Haight.
Several clubs headline in the
Haight, including Club
Boomerang (Haight near Cole).
But most people know the Red Vic
for its scrumptious popcorn,
served in bowls with condiments.
After the final moments of the
game have ended, you can cele
brate the victory, in both Palo Alto
and San Francisco. Combined, the
two cities harbor ample theaters,
restaurants, bars and night clubs.
Palo Alto
Just off-campus, you will find
bars and movie theaters, the two
most abundant forms of night life
in Palo Alto and its vicinity. Both
reflect its small-town, suburban
atmosphere.
Stanford hangouts lean toward
the crowded beer-and-burger
joints, epitomized by The Oasis on
El Camino. Even the walls are
greasy at this loud and friendly
place, which frequently broadcasts
Stanford sporting events.
For a slightly more subdued at
mosphere, try The Stanford Pub
on Emerson, well known for its
burgers. Another quintessential
Stanford haunt, the Dutch Goose
in Menlo Park (on Alameda de Las
Pulgas) is affectionately referred
to as "The Goose."
With regard to movie theaters,
University Avenue and there
abouts remain a bastion of the
quaint and the alternative. The
Stanford Theater (University),
known for reincarnating on screen
Bogey, Hepburn, Grant, Davis and
many other classic stars, has be
come a favorite place to wax nos
talgic.
If you enjoy quality foreign
films, check out the Aquarius on
Emerson. The Varsity (Universi
ty) shows more popular "artsy"
flicks, as well as "The Rocky Hor
ror Picture Show" — complete
with a live, unsolicited cast — Fri
days and Saturdays at midnight.

Though the "Rocky Horror" is a
great burlesque experience, the
Varsity's shows tend to be a little
bit less rambunctious and outra
geous than the one at Berkeley's
UC Theater.
Hollywood box office hits run at
the two-screen Palo Alto Square
(El Camino at Page Mill) and the
multi-multi-Bcreen Century 10 in
Mountain View (Shoreline Blvd.).
Century-10 goers beware, though:
on weekends, the place is overrun
by hordes of local residents.
Dance clubs options in Palo Alto
are limited, but The Edge (Califor-

nia) is about as
dance-clubby as
they get. An 18-
and-over mod
ern/alternative
rock club, the
Edge usually
draws a young
and sometimes
predominantly
high-school
crowd, but the
atmosphere is
lively and
friendly. The
Edge also regu
larly hosts live
bands and at
times attracts

reasonably big-name groups and
artists.
L.A. Fox (El Camino) offers
dancing to Top-40 tunes in a bar
like setting. Cross the Bayshore
Freeway to East Palo Alto and
you'll find Club Afrique (O'Con
nor), which plays an international
range of music from reggae to
salsa.
Although live music venues
aren't abundant in Palo Alto, the
few local clubs tend to offer more
intimate atmospheres than clubs
in San Francisco.

martre (University), features local

um attracts some big-name Bay
Area DJs, but like many main
stream dance clubs, tends to be
somewhat of a meat market.
San Francisco's most famous
comedians perform at The Improv
(Mason near Geary, north of Mar
ket) and The Punch Line (Battery

between Washington and Clay).
Though not in the downtown area,
Cobb's Comedy Club on Fisher
man's Wharf completes the main
stream comedy triumvirate.
To see one of the most
renowned regional theater compa
nies, head over to San Francisco's
American Conservatory Theater
(Geary at Mason). The talented
and increasingly diversified com
pany performs a range of works,
from the classic to the modern, as
well as seasonal traditions such as
the annual run of "A Christmas
Carol."
South of Market
South of Market is at least as
colorful and

lively as its
Manhattan
counterpart,
South of Hous
ton Street. Like
SoHo, the
young offbeat
tend to flock to
SoMa, and the
community's
diversity is
amazing.
Gays and
straights of all
races and class
es convene at
South of Mar
ket for its dis
tinctive quality
night life. Live
music venues
abound, often
attracting top
billings in addi
tion to up-and-

coming local bands. The only
drawbacks are high cover charges,
and strict 21 -and-over policies.
A long-standing City favorite,
Slim's (11th between Folsom and
Garrison) always packs a crowd in
with its impressive billings. The
DNA Lounge (11th near Folsom)
and the Paradise Lounge (11th
and Folsom) are also popular spots
for live pop, punk and hip-hop.
Very South of Market lies a
cozy, dark, bouncer-free little bar
called Bottom of the Hill (17th at
Texas), which hosts local bands
and has good beer, like Anchor
Steam and Red Hook, on tap at
great prices.
If you are looking to shake your
thang in The City, South of Market
boasts one of the largest concen
trations of 18-and-over dance
clubs. You can dance with a view of
the stars at DVB (Howard between
Ist and 2nd), which features an ul
tramodern dance-floor design and
modern rock, house music and
disco to match.
Other well-known dance clubs
include Club Mirage (Kansas at Di
vision), and The X (Harrison at
3rd), which plays modern rock or
hip-hop, depending on the night. If
you long to whip out those bell-bot
toms and tromp around in plat
form clogs, Club 1970 (Howard be
tween 2nd and 3rd), though not
the institution it is in Los Angele l3 ,
will provide a disco fix.
South of Market is often charac
terized as a gay-but-not-exclusive
ly-gay neighborhood, as reflected
by many of its establishments.
Perhaps more than any other
neighborhood, gays and straights
party together without obvious
separations.
Ask San Franciscans to name a
gay bar, and they'll probably tell

you about the unmistakably green,
wooden building that looks like an
old-West saloon, The Stud (9th
and Harrison). This bar and dance
club is a big, boisterous place
where you'll find a fairly mixed
crowd of men and women, gays
and straights. The Elbo Room (Va
lencia at 20th) has a similar atmos
phere, as well as quality live per
formances.
Slightly more hard-core, The
EndUp (6th and Harrison) holds
Girlspot on Saturday (for women)
and Club Uranus (for men), com
plete with male go-go dancers on
Sundays.
Part comedy routine and part
theatrical dramatization, the acts

at Josie's
Cabaret and
Juice Joint
(16th Market)
veer away from
the main
stream and
into the hilari
ously bizarre.
The humor
often has a gay
theme, but is
by all means
accessible to
everyone, as
the mixed au
dience that
packs the place
attests.
Queer
drama has
reached almost
legendary sta
tus in The
City, and
there's no bet-

ter place to see it than at Theater
Rhinoceros (16th near Mission),
which features constantly chang
ing shows that range from ribald
comedies to intense, issue-orient
ed pieces.
If you want to catch the latest
independent, political or otherwise
hard-to-find films, The Roxie
(16th at Valencia) is a small but
cutting-edge movie house that has
definitely carved a niche of its own.
And if you like the feeling of
power you get from strutting
around a pool table wielding a cue
stick, The Great Entertainer
(Bryant and Kate) has about 30 ta
bles — easily the largest pool bar in
The City.
The Castro
San Francisco's largest gay
neighborhood, the Castro, with its
infamous, steep hills and quaint
Victorians, attracts many of the
city's young college graduates,
both gay and straight.
Entertainment in the Castro is
as colorful as the area, with its
rainbow-colored Freedom Flags
waving and its seemingly never
ending activity. Bars in this area
tend to be smaller and cozier than
South of Market's warehouse-like
joints.
Famous for providing a wonder
ful venue for unique acts, ranging
from belly dancers to torch singers
to jazz bands, Cafe Du Nord (Mar
ket at Sanchez) has San Francis
cans singing the praises of its
"Cabaret Du Nord" shows. Be
ware, however, of its strict enforce
ment of the 21-and-over policy.
There are many single-gender,
mostly men-only bars in the heart
of the Castro, but The Elephant

Street.


Patrick Tower — Daily file
The neighborhood surrounding Castro street is characterized by
many Victorian buildings and steep hills.
Walk (24th near Castro) is proba
bly the friendliest, most gender-di
verse bar in that area.
If you like the cozy atmos
pheres of small bars, but can't
stand to just sit around, Cork'N
Bottle (24th near Castro) is a fun,
friendly, not-too-crowded joint
equipped with a pool table (and
some pretty amazing pool sharks),
dart boards, a pinball machine
and, yes, even a slot machine.
North of the Castro lies a fa
vorite live music venue, The Ken
nel Club (Divisadero and Hayes),
which hosts Club ! for women and
The Box for mixed crowds on dif
ferent nights.
Located in the very center of
the Castro's liveliest areas, The
Castro Theater (Castro between
17th and 18th) shows non-main

stream, independent and reperto
ry films.
The Haight
Officially called "The Haight-
Ashbury District," the area
around Golden Gate Park's Pan
handle has the reputation of an ec
centric little neighborhood that
never made it out of the 60s.
Sure enough, the place brims
with aging flower children — often
driving painted Volkswagen Bugs
and vans — neo-hippies and poor,
struggling college graduates. Per
fect for exploring, the streets are
lined with countless quaint little
cafes, restaurants and bars, many
with an ethnic feel. More so than
beer, coffee is the drink of choice
in the Haight.
Several clubs headline in the
Haight, including Club
Boomerang (Haight near Cole).
But most people know the Red Vic
for its scrumptious popcorn,
served in bowls with condiments.
After the final moments of the
game have ended, you can cele
brate the victory, in both Palo Alto
and San Francisco. Combined, the
two cities harbor ample theaters,
restaurants, bars and night clubs.
Palo Alto
Just off-campus, you will find
bars and movie theaters, the two
most abundant forms of night life
in Palo Alto and its vicinity. Both
reflect its small-town, suburban
atmosphere.
Stanford hangouts lean toward
the crowded beer-and-burger
joints, epitomized by The Oasis on
El Camino. Even the walls are
greasy at this loud and friendly
place, which frequently broadcasts
Stanford sporting events.
For a slightly more subdued at
mosphere, try The Stanford Pub
on Emerson, well known for its
burgers. Another quintessential
Stanford haunt, the Dutch Goose
in Menlo Park (on Alameda de Las
Pulgas) is affectionately referred
to as "The Goose."
With regard to movie theaters,
University Avenue and there
abouts remain a bastion of the
quaint and the alternative. The
Stanford Theater (University),
known for reincarnating on screen
Bogey, Hepburn, Grant, Davis and
many other classic stars, has be
come a favorite place to wax nos
talgic.
If you enjoy quality foreign
films, check out the Aquarius on
Emerson. The Varsity (Universi
ty) shows more popular "artsy"
flicks, as well as "The Rocky Hor
ror Picture Show" — complete
with a live, unsolicited cast — Fri
days and Saturdays at midnight.

Though the "Rocky Horror" is a
great burlesque experience, the
Varsity's shows tend to be a little
bit less rambunctious and outra
geous than the one at Berkeley's
UC Theater.
Hollywood box office hits run at
the two-screen Palo Alto Square
(El Camino at Page Mill) and the
multi-multi-Bcreen Century 10 in
Mountain View (Shoreline Blvd.).
Century-10 goers beware, though:
on weekends, the place is overrun
by hordes of local residents.
Dance clubs options in Palo Alto
are limited, but The Edge (Califor-

nia) is about as
dance-clubby as
they get. An 18-
and-over mod
ern/alternative
rock club, the
Edge usually
draws a young
and sometimes
predominantly
high-school
crowd, but the
atmosphere is
lively and
friendly. The
Edge also regu
larly hosts live
bands and at
times attracts

reasonably big-name groups and
artists.
L.A. Fox (El Camino) offers
dancing to Top-40 tunes in a bar
like setting. Cross the Bayshore
Freeway to East Palo Alto and
you'll find Club Afrique (O'Con
nor), which plays an international
range of music from reggae to
salsa.
Although live music venues
aren't abundant in Palo Alto, the
few local clubs tend to offer more
intimate atmospheres than clubs
in San Francisco.

One such venue, Cafe Mont
martre (University), features local
favorite "The Basics," an acoustic
based group, as well as other
artists in a chic setting. St.
Michael's Alley (Emerson) also of
fers a good sampling of local musi
cians, and is open every night.
Jazz aficionados can check out
The Gatehouse (Lytton) and
Jose's Caribbean Restaurant (El
Camino). For those who prefer a
little international flavor, Jose's
also has samba, salsa and reggae
nights.
A few small companies headline

local theater,
most notably
Theatre Works,
which performs
in Mountain
View and Palo
Alto, and the his
toric Palo Alto
Players Guild,
which takes the
stage at the
Lucie Stern The
ater (Middle
field).
San Francisco
If Palo
Alto seeming a

bit too small, San
Francisco offers an array of enter
tainment as diverse as its many
districts.
While there are no cut-and-dry
boundaries, each area of The City
has its own distinctive character,
and its establishments reflect this.
Even a compilation of "War and
Peace" proportions could not cover
all of the great bars, clubs and
venues in The City, so the best way
to go is to pick a district and ex
plore.
Market and North of Market
If there exists a "main drag" in
San Francisco, it's the ever-busy
Market Street, which cuts a neat
diagonal slash across the east side
of The City. The section of Market
between the Civic Center (Van
Ness) and the downtown/financial
district area (Battery) is usually
considered the cultural center of
the city.
Civic Center features all the up
percrust entertainment an intel
lectual could ask for, including the
City's opera company, and sym
phony and ballet venues, all locat
ed on Van Ness Avenue.
An amalgam of financial district
yuppies, city politicians and young
people from all over the Bay Area
mingle in the clubs lining Market
and north of Market.
Perhaps San Francisco's most
high-profile live music venue, The
Warfield (Sixth and Market) at
tracts big names and gig crowds,
and has no minimum-age require
ment for admission. A few blocks
north of Civic Center, The Great
American Music Hall (O'Farrell
near Polk) tends to have slightly
more off-beat billings, but is well
attended.
A paradox brought to life, The
Upper Room (Grove at Market) is
the City's first alcohol and tobacco
free nightclub. The music tends to
ward rap and Top 40 rhythm and
blues.
The place for jazz is Kimball's
(Grove at Market), a club as popu
lar as its star-laden billings. North
of downtown heading into North
Beach, Pearl's (Columbus near
Broadway) approaches Kimball's
legendary status.
One of the City's largest dance
clubs, The Palladium draws a
young 18-and-over crowd and
plays modern rock into the wee
hours of the morning. The Palladi
um attracts some big-name Bay
Area DJs, but like many main
stream dance clubs, tends to be
somewhat of a meat market.

neighborhood, gays and straights
party together without obvious
separations.
Ask San Franciscans to name a
gay bar, and they'll probably tell

South of Market is at
least as colorful and
lively as its Manhattan
counterpart, South of
Houston Street. Like
SoHo, the young off
beat tend to flock to
SoMa, and the com
munity's diversity is
amazina.

you about the unmistakably green,
wooden building that looks like an
old-West saloon, The Stud (9th
and Harrison). This bar and dance
club is a big, boisterous place
where you'll find a fairly mixed
crowd of men and women, gays
and straights. The Elbo Room (Va
lencia at 20th) has a similar atmos
phere, as well as quality live per
formances.
Slightly more hard-core, The
EndUp (6th and Harrison) holds
Girlspot on Saturday (for women)
and Club Uranus (for men), com
plete with male go-go dancers on
Sundays.
Part comedy routine and part
theatrical dramatization, the acts

at Josie's
Cabaret and
Juice Joint
(16th Market)
veer away from
the main
stream and
into the hilari
ously bizarre.
The humor
often has a gay
theme, but is
by all means
accessible to
everyone, as
the mixed au
dience that
packs the place
attests.
Queer
drama has
reached almost
legendary sta
tus in The
City, and
there's no bet-

ter place to see it than at Theater
Rhinoceros (16th near Mission),
which features constantly chang
ing shows that range from ribald
comedies to intense, issue-orient
ed pieces.
If you want to catch the latest
independent, political or otherwise
hard-to-find films, The Roxie
(16th at Valencia) is a small but
cutting-edge movie house that has
definitely carved a niche of its own.
And if you like the feeling of
power you get from strutting
around a pool table wielding a cue
stick, The Great Entertainer
(Bryant and Kate) has about 30 ta
bles — easily the largest pool bar in
The City.
The Castro
San Francisco's largest gay
neighborhood, the Castro, with its
infamous, steep hills and quaint
Victorians, attracts many of the
city's young college graduates,
both gay and straight.
Entertainment in the Castro is
as colorful as the area, with its
rainbow-colored Freedom Flags
waving and its seemingly never
ending activity. Bars in this area
tend to be smaller and cozier than
South of Market's warehouse-like
joints.
Famous for providing a wonder
ful venue for unique acts, ranging
from belly dancers to torch singers
to jazz bands, Cafe Du Nord (Mar
ket at Sanchez) has San Francis
cans singing the praises of its
"Cabaret Du Nord" shows. Be
ware, however, of its strict enforce
ment of the 21-and-over policy.
There are many single-gender,
mostly men-only bars in the heart
of the Castro, but The Elephant

pheres of small bars, but can't
stand to just sit around, Cork'N
Bottle (24th near Castro) is a fun,
friendly, not-too-crowded joint
equipped with a pool table (and
some pretty amazing pool sharks),

ry films.
The Haight
Officially called "The Haight-
Ashbury District," the area
around Golden Gate Park's Pan
handle has the reputation of an ec
centric little neighborhood that
never made it out of the 60s.
Sure enough, the place brims
with aging flower children — often
driving painted Volkswagen Bugs
and vans — neo-hippies and poor,
struggling college graduates. Per
fect for exploring, the streets are
lined with countless quaint little
cafes, restaurants and bars, many
with an ethnic feel. More so than
beer, coffee is the drink of choice
in the Haight.
Several clubs headline in the
Haight, including Club
Boomerang (Haight near Cole).
But most people know the Red Vic
for its scrumptious popcorn,
served in bowls with condiments.
