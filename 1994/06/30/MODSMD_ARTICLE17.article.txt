Tired of Stanford Stadium hot dogs? Look
ing for something different from hotel room
service or fast food? Well, it's time to give your
tastebuds a change and explore some of the
unique, quaint restaurants which surround
campus. We found four "little-known" area
restaurants, each with a distinctive atmos
phere and culinary style: China Delight, Por
tola Valley Kitchen, The Country Gourmet
and Hearts Cafe. If you're looking to get away
from the crowd and encounter delicious, in
novative food, these diamonds-in-the-rough
will be for you.
China Delight
203 University Ave.
Palo Alto
326-6065
China Delight lives up to its name — it is
truly a delight to dine at this 12-table restau
rant. Located in an unobtrusive storefront on
University Ave., this eatery provides a mellow
atmosphere, complete with flowery wallpaper
and lace curtains.
What's unique about China Delight is its
top-notch service. Upon entering the door, we
were seated at a table and had menus in our
hands within 10 seconds. Many of the patrons
of China Delight are regulars and have estab
lished a friendly rapport with the staff. (A
waitress and a customer held a lively discus
sion about the World Cup tournament as we
dined.) On other visits, the personable wait
ress has offered a soup or appetizer free of
charge as we looked over the menu.
The restaurant offers a traditional menu
of Szechwan Mandarin food with few surpris
es but overall excellent taste. Twelve lun
cheon specials, which include an appetizer,
steamed rice and soup, are available for under
$5. We had the Chicken Chow Mein, which
may be touristy, but nonetheless left us in
culinary ecstasy. The Szechwan Crispy
Chicken's sweet, crunchy morsels are compli
mented by a saltier dish — we liked the Beef
with Broccoli. With great service and good, in
expensive food, it's no wonder so many people
keep coming back to China Delight.
Portola Valley Kitchen
884 Portola Rd.
Portola Valley
851-3287
If you are a seafood lover and curious to ex
periment with spicy Thai food, Portola Valley
Kitchen has a method of uniquely combining

these two culinary genres and producing ex
cellent results.
Portola Valley Kitchen is situated in a rus
tic setting on Portola Road about a 10-minute
drive or a long, scenic bike ride from campus.
Inside the rather small, dark restaurant, the
restaurant cultivates a country image — with
brick walls, wood paneling and flowered seat
cushions. The crowd appeared to be mainly
locals who were familiar with the owners; not
many young people were present.
Although the menu seems to specialize in
dinner fare — with its hefty seafood and Thai
specials — the restaurant also serves lunch
and a special $9.95 Sunday brunch.
For lunch, there are soups, salads and
sandwiches, in addition to the seafood and
Thai dishes. If you want a traditional Thai

lunch,
the

Portola
fried rice is a de
licious combina
tion of rice,
eggs, chicken

and vegetables. |
For something a
little spicier but
just as filling, the

Tom Kha Gai,
chicken in a spicy
coconut milk soup, is
also a good bet. Most

of the lunch items are
reasonably priced at
about $5 to $7.
The dinner menu is

more expensive ($lO to $15
per platter). Seafood dinner spe-

rials include crab cakes and fresh
halibut. Recommended Thai dishes in

elude a chicken dish simmered in green curry
with coconut milk, and a mixture of seafood
saut6ed in a hot chili sauce. If you don t mind
spending a few extra bucks and are in the
mood for a scenic bike ride, the Thai food is
definitely worth the trek.
Country Gourmet
2098 W. El Camino Real
Mountain View
962-0239
Even if the country charm of this casual
little eatery doesn't win your heart, the
healthy and tasty meals will. In addition to of
fering traditionally healthy items, the menu
includes some more exotic dishes — Lemon
Mahi Stirfry, Roasted Eggplant Parmesan

and
Greek

Salad to
name a few.

The Midwest sandwich — slices of turkey
breast, melted Swiss cheese, sprouts and
tomatoes served hot — is a somewhat unusu
al combination, but is absolutely delicious.
Considering its monstrous size, it is well
worth the $5.45 price tag. For dessert, the
apple crisp is a sure bet. With fresh apples,
real whipped cream and a splash of brandy its
scrumptious. Dinner specials, including a
still-generous half-slice of lasagna accompa
nied by a small salad, please both the palate
and the pocketbook. Also, try the featured
pizza specials for delicious and innovative
combinations.
A medium-sized restaurant, Country
Gourmet provides a pleasant ambiance, fur
nished with paisley wallpaper, hanging plants
and quaint knick-knacks. The patio seating is
a nice treat. Although it is a modified self-ser
vice restaurant, the service is still fast and
friendly.
Hearts Cafe
201 California Ave.
Palo Alto
322-1285
If you're feeling a bit romantic, cele
brating your team's win or just want to in
dulge yourself, Hearts is the perfect place
to splurge for that special meal. Also titled
the Cuisina Creativa, or creative kitchen,
Hearts sticks to this creativeness with its
wide varieties of pastas and Italian special
ties.
The name Hearts suits the restaurant
perfectly; this fuzzy, romantic feel is cap
tured in the pink wall behind the quaint
bar and the homey, inviting atmosphere.
Besides the regular lunch and dinner
menus, Hearts offers a unique breakfast
on the weekends which looks tempting
and is reasonably priced at about $5 to $6.
The breakfast menu mainly consists of
omelets — prepared in 10 unusual ways.
Other items like ricotta cheese pancakes
and fresh fruit are also available.
For a typical lunch, the prices are rather
steep. Sandwiches and salads are around
$7 and pastas are slightly more expen
sive.
The dinner menu seems to be more
inviting to couples wishing to spend a quiet
evening together and for those celebrating
a special occasion. After starting off the
meal with freshly prepared garlic bread
with olive oil and mozzarella, choose be
tween several different types of angel hair
pasta or fettuccini dishes, which cost at
least $10. Other entrees, like veal piccata,
filet mignon, salmon and lobster fettucci
ni, are $12 and up.

brating your team's win or just want to in
dulge yourself, Hearts is the perfect place
to splurge for that special meal. Also titled
the Cuisina Creativa, or creative kitchen,
Hearts sticks to this creativeness with its
wide varieties of pastas and Italian special
ties.
The name Hearts suits the restaurant
perfectly; this fuzzy, romantic feel is cap
tured in the pink wall behind the quaint
bar and the homey, inviting atmosphere.
Besides the regular lunch and dinner
menus, Hearts offers a unique breakfast
on the weekends which looks tempting
and is reasonably priced at about $5 to $6.
The breakfast menu mainly consists of
omelets — prepared in 10 unusual ways.
Other items like ricotta cheese pancakes
and fresh fruit are also available.
For a typical lunch, the prices are rather
steep. Sandwiches and salads are around
$7 and pastas are slightly more expen
sive.
The dinner menu seems to be more
inviting to couples wishing to spend a quiet
evening together and for those celebrating
a special occasion. After starting off the
meal with freshly prepared garlic bread
with olive oil and mozzarella, choose be
tween several different types of angel hair
pasta or fettuccini dishes, which cost at
least $10. Other entrees, like veal piccata,
filet mignon, salmon and lobster fettucci
ni, are $12 and up.

Tired of Stanford Stadium hot dogs? Look
ing for something different from hotel room
service or fast food? Well, it's time to give your
tastebuds a change and explore some of the
unique, quaint restaurants which surround
campus. We found four "little-known" area
restaurants, each with a distinctive atmos
phere and culinary style: China Delight, Por
tola Valley Kitchen, The Country Gourmet
and Hearts Cafe. If you're looking to get away
from the crowd and encounter delicious, in
novative food, these diamonds-in-the-rough
will be for you.
China Delight
203 University Ave.
Palo Alto
326-6065
China Delight lives up to its name — it is
truly a delight to dine at this 12-table restau
rant. Located in an unobtrusive storefront on
University Ave., this eatery provides a mellow
atmosphere, complete with flowery wallpaper
and lace curtains.
What's unique about China Delight is its
top-notch service. Upon entering the door, we
were seated at a table and had menus in our
hands within 10 seconds. Many of the patrons
of China Delight are regulars and have estab
lished a friendly rapport with the staff. (A
waitress and a customer held a lively discus
sion about the World Cup tournament as we
dined.) On other visits, the personable wait
ress has offered a soup or appetizer free of
charge as we looked over the menu.
The restaurant offers a traditional menu
of Szechwan Mandarin food with few surpris
es but overall excellent taste. Twelve lun
cheon specials, which include an appetizer,
steamed rice and soup, are available for under
$5. We had the Chicken Chow Mein, which
may be touristy, but nonetheless left us in
culinary ecstasy. The Szechwan Crispy
Chicken's sweet, crunchy morsels are compli
mented by a saltier dish — we liked the Beef
with Broccoli. With great service and good, in
expensive food, it's no wonder so many people
keep coming back to China Delight.
Portola Valley Kitchen
884 Portola Rd.
Portola Valley
851-3287
If you are a seafood lover and curious to ex
periment with spicy Thai food, Portola Valley
Kitchen has a method of uniquely combining

these two culinary genres and producing ex
cellent results.
Portola Valley Kitchen is situated in a rus
tic setting on Portola Road about a 10-minute
drive or a long, scenic bike ride from campus.
Inside the rather small, dark restaurant, the
restaurant cultivates a country image — with
brick walls, wood paneling and flowered seat
cushions. The crowd appeared to be mainly
locals who were familiar with the owners; not
many young people were present.
Although the menu seems to specialize in
dinner fare — with its hefty seafood and Thai
specials — the restaurant also serves lunch
and a special $9.95 Sunday brunch.
For lunch, there are soups, salads and
sandwiches, in addition to the seafood and
Thai dishes. If you want a traditional Thai

lunch,
the

Portola
fried rice is a de
licious combina
tion of rice,
eggs, chicken

and vegetables. |
For something a
little spicier but
just as filling, the

Tom Kha Gai,
chicken in a spicy
coconut milk soup, is
also a good bet. Most

of the lunch items are
reasonably priced at
about $5 to $7.
The dinner menu is

more expensive ($lO to $15
per platter). Seafood dinner spe-

rials include crab cakes and fresh
halibut. Recommended Thai dishes in

elude a chicken dish simmered in green curry
with coconut milk, and a mixture of seafood
saut6ed in a hot chili sauce. If you don t mind
spending a few extra bucks and are in the
mood for a scenic bike ride, the Thai food is
definitely worth the trek.
Country Gourmet
2098 W. El Camino Real
Mountain View
962-0239
Even if the country charm of this casual
little eatery doesn't win your heart, the
healthy and tasty meals will. In addition to of
fering traditionally healthy items, the menu
includes some more exotic dishes — Lemon
Mahi Stirfry, Roasted Eggplant Parmesan

and
Greek

Salad to
name a few.

The Midwest sandwich — slices of turkey
breast, melted Swiss cheese, sprouts and
tomatoes served hot — is a somewhat unusu
al combination, but is absolutely delicious.
Considering its monstrous size, it is well
worth the $5.45 price tag. For dessert, the
apple crisp is a sure bet. With fresh apples,
real whipped cream and a splash of brandy its
scrumptious. Dinner specials, including a
still-generous half-slice of lasagna accompa
nied by a small salad, please both the palate
and the pocketbook. Also, try the featured
pizza specials for delicious and innovative
combinations.
A medium-sized restaurant, Country
Gourmet provides a pleasant ambiance, fur
nished with paisley wallpaper, hanging plants
and quaint knick-knacks. The patio seating is
a nice treat. Although it is a modified self-ser
vice restaurant, the service is still fast and
friendly.
