## Tips on visiting Palo Alto 
### Romesh Ratnesar Senior staff writer 
Though it was founded in the late 1800s primarily as
an area to serve the new Stanford University, Palo Alto
has developed a unique, charming identity all its own.
Celebrating its 100 th birthday this year, the city today
teems with a vibrant array of cultural and culinary at
tractions.
A tour of Palo Alto should include a visit to "El Palo
Alto," the stately, towering redwood that inspired Stan
ford's symbol. Located on Alma Avenue, near the junc
tion of El Camino, "The Tree" aptly symbolizes the ele
gance, growth and longevity of the Stanford communi
ty-
Just a few blocks away, on Waverley Street north of
University Avenue, is the Barbie Doll Hall of Fame,
which contains the world's largest collection of that
blond, ail-American plastic icon. More than 14,000 dolls
chart the historical progression of the Barbie and her
uncanny ability to adjust to changing fads and fashions.
Other local museums include the Museum of American
Heritage on Alma and Everett Avenue, which focuses on
the early 20th century, and the Palo Alto Junior Muse
um, an eclectic site that features science and nature ex
hibits.
The lovely Peninsula weather offers a terrific chance
to sample the area's bountiful parks and preserves.
Stanford's own foothills and the nearby Jasper Ridge
Biological Preserve are themselves perfect places for
picnic lunches, leisurely strolls and quiet reflection. Off
the Farm, Palo Alto's Rinconada Park — at the center

of the diverse Palo Alto Cultural Center on Newell and
Embarcadero — and the Baylands Nature Preserve are
also pleasant.
University Avenue remains the commercial and
culinary heart of Palo Alto. The avenue and its sur
rounding streets boast a wide range of boutiques,
restaurants and cafes. Don't miss the area's numerous
well-accounted Italian restaurants and trendy water
ing holes, like Fanny and Alexander's, Gordon Biersch
and the Blue Chalk Cafe. Meanwhile, Noah's Bagels of
fers the closest-to-New York fare in the Bay Area — and
a welcome breakfast for weary graduates. Also on Uni
versity is the Stanford Theatre, which strictly features
cinema classics.
Downtown Palo Alto is home to over 200 stores for
those looking for the ideal gift. For visitors with a little
more time on their hands, the Stanford Shopping Cen
ter and its 144 stores serve all retail purposes.
While Palo Alto's borders are enough to keep travel
ers busy, it shouldn't confine you. Try a tour of the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center or Sunset Maga
zine in Menlo Park. Take a drive down bucolic Highway
280, called by some the most beautiful stretch of road in
the country, to Half Moon Bay for a day of surf and
sand.
Whatever you choose, Stanford's surrounding area
promises natural beauty and unquestioned style. Dou
glas Coupland, the author of the seminal twentysome
thing novel "Generation X," recently called Palo Alto
the last outpost of the California dream. Thankfully,
it's a dream that any visitor to Stanford can also get a
glimpse of.
