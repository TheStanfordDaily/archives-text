# Cup brings changes, deficit to Stanford

"To the rest of the world, it's the
biggest sporting event around.
Even bigger than the Olympics."
That is how Stanford head
men's soccer coach Colin Lindores
describes World Cup, the champi
onship soccer tournament whose
presence has been shaking the
Stanford campus for the past two
months.
The month-long event will be
played in nine cities across the
country, including Detroit, Los An
geles, Boston, Dallas, Orlando, New
York, Chicago and Washington,
D.C. Six games are scheduled to be
held at the Stanford Stadium, fea
turing squads from Russia, Brazil,
Cameroon and Switzerland, as well
as matchups in the round-of-16 and
quarterfinals.
In preparation for the games, the
Stanford Stadium has seen many
renovations. Turf has been laid on
top of the running track and the
pole vault runway has been torn up.
In addition, World Cup USA paid
$500,00 for modifications to the
press box and other structural
changes.
Outside the stadium, more
changes have taken place. World
Cup has installed portable build
ings to be used for entertainment,
media, broadcasting and security.
In addition, the Department of De
fense has paid for a six-foot fence to
be built that will ring the entire sta
dium complex.
Stanford itself has improved the
inside of the stadium by tearing out
all the wooden benches and replac
ing them with aluminum ones at a
cost of over $600,000.
While the World Cup is expected
to generate $337 million for the Bay
Area, it appears that Stanford will

absorb a $700,000 loss after the
games are over. According to Direc
tor of University Communications
Terry Shepard, Stanford expects to
take in $1.8 million as revenue,
while expenses will total in excess of
$2.5 million.
"[This shortfall] is approximate
ly the cost of the aluminum bench
es, which Stanford considers a capi
tal improvement," he said.
About $800,000 of the projected
revenue will come from parking
alone, with another $900,000 com
ing from World Cup USA and about
$100,000 from concession sales.
Stanford officials expect to sell
out all six games, and are bracing
themselves for crowds in excess of
86,000. Such large crowds have
called for extraordinary security
measures.
"We've been working on security
for these games for the past two
years," said Stanford Police Chief
Marvin Herrington.
Herrington, who has traveled to
soccer games around the world to
see how other stadiums handle
large crowds, is in charge of the se
curity for the games.
His normal Stanford police force
will be augmented by police from
Santa Clara County and the sher
iff s office for the month surround
ing the event. In addition, the Stan
ford police will receive help from the
"non-sworn security" who normal
ly work football and basketball
games and security personnel hired
from Contemporary Services. The
overall force on games days will
total close to 700 people.
This security effort also includes
larger nightly patrols on non-game
nights and personnel on duty full
time at Stanford Stadium.
One of the most contentious as
pects of the security effort is not
personnel-related but a physical ob

ject â€” the fence separating the field
from the stands.
"I feel confident that there will
be no fences in D.C. or Dallas," said
Alan Rothenberg, chairman and
chief executive officer of World Cup
USA 1994. "So then the only stadi
um with a fence will be Stanford,
which has always had one."
The purpose of the fence is to
prevent overzealous fans from en
tering the playing area, particularly
during large football games such as
Big Game.

But in highly publicized disas
ters at soccer matches in other
countries, enormous numbers of
fans have stormed the field simulta
neously, resulting in injuries and
deaths to people pressed up against
fences.
These events have prompted
World Cup USA officials to strongly
recommend against having fences
in the venues. Their recommenda
tions have been heeded in six of the
nine stadiums, and, with negotia
tions still continuing in Dallas and

Washington, it is likely that Stan
ford Stadium will be the only venue
with a fence.
"The fence is there to prevent
problems," Herrington said. "Ours
won't even work like a fence. It has
18 gates to the field which will break
open under pressure."
Another security feature which
is unique to Stanford Stadium is the
alcohol policy. While World Cup of
ficials are urging other stadiums to
