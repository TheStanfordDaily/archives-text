Following the death of their only son in
1884, Senator and Mrs. Leland Stanford
thought a university would be an appropriate
tribute to Leland Jr., who died of typhoid
fever in Florence, Italy just before his 16th
birthday.
On November 17, 1885, the Founding
Grant of The Leland Stanford Junior Uni
versity was presented to 24 prominent men
who the Stanfords chose as the University's
first trustees. The grant stated, among other
things, that their vast country estate on the
San Francisco Peninsula would be the home

of the University, and that this land is never
to be sold.
After much thought, the Stanfords decid
ed not to center their university around the
philosophies of those on the East Coast. After
consulting with presidents of several leading
institutions, the Stanfords felt these univer
sities were not preparing students for the
real world. Leland Stanford once said, "Of all
the young men who come to me with letters
of introduction from friends in the East, the
most helpless are college young men."
The Stanfords ended up focusing much
more on a "practical education." The found
ing grant stated that the mission of the Uni
versity would be "to qualify students for per

sonal success and direct usefulness in life; to
promote the public welfare by exercising an
influence in behalf of humanity and civiliza
tion, teaching the blessings of liberty regulat
ed by law, and inculcating love and reverence
for the great principles of government as de
rived from the inalienable rights of man to
life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness."
The Stanfords then began to focus on the
construction and structure of their new uni
versity. Senator Stanford brought Francis
Walker, president of the Massachusetts In
stitute of Technology, and famed architect
Frederick Law Olmsted to the Peninsula
