Following the death of their only son in
1884, Senator and Mrs. Leland Stanford
thought a university would be an appropriate
tribute to Leland Jr., who died of typhoid
fever in Florence, Italy just before his 16th
birthday.
On November 17, 1885, the Founding
Grant of The Leland Stanford Junior Uni
versity was presented to 24 prominent men
who the Stanfords chose as the University's
first trustees. The grant stated, among other
things, that their vast country estate on the
San Francisco Peninsula would be the home

of the University, and that this land is never
to be sold.
After much thought, the Stanfords decid
ed not to center their university around the
philosophies of those on the East Coast. After
consulting with presidents of several leading
institutions, the Stanfords felt these univer
sities were not preparing students for the
real world. Leland Stanford once said, "Of all
the young men who come to me with letters
of introduction from friends in the East, the
most helpless are college young men."
The Stanfords ended up focusing much
more on a "practical education." The found
ing grant stated that the mission of the Uni
versity would be "to qualify students for per

sonal success and direct usefulness in life; to
promote the public welfare by exercising an
influence in behalf of humanity and civiliza
tion, teaching the blessings of liberty regulat
ed by law, and inculcating love and reverence
for the great principles of government as de
rived from the inalienable rights of man to
life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness."
The Stanfords then began to focus on the
construction and structure of their new uni
versity. Senator Stanford brought Francis
Walker, president of the Massachusetts In
stitute of Technology, and famed architect
Frederick Law Olmsted to the Peninsula
during the summer of 1886.
Serious thought was given to
locating the University in the
foothills to take advantage of the
magnificent views of the Bay, but
Senator Stanford worried about
future expansion. They finally
decided to drive in a stake in the
cornfields below at a point that
marks one corner of the Inner
Quadrangle. Olmsted worked out
the general concept of the
grounds and buildings, but it was
young Boston architect Charles
Allerton Coolidge who developed
the concept for the architecture,
known as Richardsonian Ro
manesque.
The inner quad of 12 class
room buildings — with a space re
served for Memorial Church —
three engineering buildings,
Encina Hall for men and Roble
Hall for women were ready for
the University's opening on Octo
ber 1, 1891. Coeducational from
the beginning, Stanford enrolled
559 men and women in its first
student body.
Disaster struck, however, on
the morning of April 18, 1906
when an earthquake shook the
ground for 45 seconds. The earth
quake killed two men on campus
and caused millions of dollars of

damage. Reconstruction cost
more than $2 million. Classes
were dismissed until the fall,
while seniors, known as the
"Earthquake class," were voted
their degrees in May.
Another earthquake in 1989,
caused hundreds of millions of
dollars worth of damage. Memor
ial Church was closed for over 2
years. The West Wing of Green
Library and the Art Museum
have been closed since the quake,
although both will be repaired in
the near future.
Stanford was well-regarded as
a regional institution in its early
days, especially at the undergrad
uate level, but it was during the
19505, under University Presi
dent J. Wallace Sterling, that
Stanford garnered national and
international status as a major
teaching and research university.
It has been considered one of the
top universities in the nation ever
since.
Stanford's current enrollment
is around 13,500, spilt relatively
evenly between undergraduates
and graduate students. The fac
ulty, which has about 1,400 mem
bers, includes nine Nobel laure
ates, six Pulitzer Prize winners
and hundreds of members in the
National Academy of Sciences,
National Academy of Engineer
ing and the American Academy of
Arts and Sciences.
