# Welcome to Stanford!
## Join the author for a sit-down walking tour of the University campus 
### Chris Shuttlesworth Staff writer 
Hello, and welcome to Stanford.
I'm your tour guide and I'll be lead
ing you on a no-stress, no-effort
tour of the campus. I have only one
request to make: I walk backwards
through most of the tour, and while
I've gotten good at avoiding large,
non-moving things like buildings, I
have trouble with small animals,
children, vehicles and the like.
Please help me out by warning me
when I'm about to hurt myself.
We'll begin the tour in the front
of the Quad, at Memorial Court. Di
rectly behind you is Palm Drive, the
main entrance to the University.
It's lined with 150 palm trees,
which incidentally aren't indige
nous to the region and must be im
ported.
We'll stop for a minute in the
center of the Quad. Surrounding
you are the 12 original buildings of
the Inner Quad, the part of the
University that existed when the
school opened in 1891. The 16
Outer Quad buildings and Memor
ial Church were added by 1903.
Today, these buildings house many
of the departments of the School of
Humanities and Sciences. Most of
the technical divisions, like physics,
engineering and biology, moved
west of the Quad as their need for
larger research facilities grew.
Memorial Church, directly in
front of you, was built by Jane
Stanford in memory of her hus-

band, who died in 1893, only
two years after the Univer
sity opened. The church
originally had an 80-foot

spire atop it, housing a
large clock and four
bells. Duringthe 1906
San Francisco earth-

quake, the spire
crashed down into
the center of the
§ church, blowing

out the front
wall and de
stroying
most of the

building. Miraculously, the bells
and clock survived the fall. They
now stand at the southwest corner
of the Quad and continue to chime
today.
Unfortunately, when the
church was rebuilt, the original
central supporting system was left
intact. During the 1989 earth
quake, the keystone, the central

supporting stone of the
church's main arches,
slipped an inch out of place.
This damage took four
years to fix and was com-

pleted last year.
Let's head for the
cornerstone, locat- A

Ed at the corner of
building 60. The
Stanfords in- i

sisted on laying
this first stone
of the Univer
sity on May *

14, 1887,
which
would have
been their

son s
19th
birth
day.
You're
probably
wonder
ing what
all those
num
bered
plaques
are at
your
feet; this
is the
one
question
that just
about
every
tour
group
asks.
These
plaques
actually

begin in front of the church, and
each one is dedicated by the senior
class the day before Commence
ment. The class of 1896 started the
tradition, but '92 through '95
didn't want to be left out, so they
placed theirs retroactively. These
plaques will continue around the
Inner Quad until they once again
reach the front of the church in
2403, 512 plaques later. Former
University President Donald
Kennedy counted the plaques per
sonally when he was provost in
1980.

Each plaque covers a time cap
sule containing memorabilia
chosen by the senior class.

The contents include
things like Stanford Stu
dent ID's, record al
bums, newspapers and
even cans of soda com

memorating the
change in formula of
Coca-Cola.
At this point the
guide attempts to

find a way out of
the south side of
the Quad while

avoiding fenccs
and construction
equipment.
Needless to say,
the 1989 earth
quake hit the
University hard.
The tour emerges
at the southwest
corner of the
Quad.
Remember the
clock and bells I
told you about
earlier from the
Memorial
Church spire?
Well, this clock
tower contains
those original
parts, which
until 1967 had
been in a wood
en tower behind
the church.
We'll head for
White Plaza
now, where
much of

the social activity on campus takes
place. During the school year, ta
bles are set up here by students pro
moting plays and concerts, political
groups, clubs, sports and countless
other activities. Sometimes rock
bands play in White Plaza or up in

the Tressider Union patio, which
you can see to your right.
Behind me is the Braun Music
Center, constructed in 1982 to
house the Department of Music.
Behind you to the left is Old Union,
formerly the student union but
now the student services center.
Old Union was built with funds
provided by former U.S. President
Herbert Hoover, a Stanford alum
nus (Geology, '95)
As we exit White Plaza back the
same way we came, you'll notice
White Memorial Fountain on your
left. Actually, I didn't even know
that it was named that until I be
came a tour guide, since everybody
here calls it"The Claw." The Claw,
like all of Stanford fountains, is a

great site for fountain-hoping
since it sprays in all direc
tions and is easy to climb. {
Every year during Big

Game Week, a stuffed bear
(usually of the teddy variety) is
impaled upon the top spike of The
Claw by the drum-major of the
Stanford Band. The "Bearial," held
on a Monday in late November, is

the kickofT event of the spirit activ
ities leading up to Big Game.
On your right is Stanford Book
store, a newly renovated facility
that claims to be one of the largest
college bookstores in the nation.
The main level contains nothing
but books, books, and more books.
This doesn't even include the text
book section in the basement. A
computer store, a cafe, a photo lab,
school and office supplies and
everything that has ever had Stan
ford's name stamped on it can also
be found in the bookstore.
Curving between the Bookstore
and the Career Planing and Place
ment Center (which used to be the
Bookstore), we head for the front of
Meyer library, one of Stanford's nu
merous libraries. Stanford's hold
ings include over 5.7 million vol
umes housed in 40 special libraries.
Most libraries contain specialized
holdings — physics, art, law, ect. —
but Meyer and Green (the library
over there to your left) are two gen
eral reference libraries. Green is the
largest, with over 1.6 million vol
umes, while Meyer serves as the in
structional and media services li
brary with a computer cluster and
an audio-visual center.
Right next to us is Rodin's "The
Thinker," part of Stanford's Rodin
collection, the second largest in the
world. While most of the Rodins are
in the B. Gerald Cantor Rodin
Sculpture Garden next to the art
museum, The Thinker was placed
in front of Meyer for, I suppose, in
spirational reasons.
After curving around Green, we
conclude the tour in front of Hoover
Tower, one of the buildings of the

Hoover Institution on War,
Revolution, and Peace, a major re
search center for social, political,
and economic change in the 20th
century. The Tower is primarily a
library, separate from the Univer

sity's holdings. Standing 285 feet
tall, the Tower features an obser
vation platform that provides an
aerial view of campus and a sub
stantial version of the Bay Area.
Finally, to your right is Memo
rial Hall, a large auditorium built
in 1936 from student funds to
honor the students and faculty
that died in World War I. The
lobby is inscribed with their

names, as well as the names of
those who died in World War 11,
the Korean War and the Vietnam
War.
If there are no more questions,
I'd like to conclude the tour and
wish you a pleasant stay at Stan
ford. I'm walking back to the start
ing point to get my bike, so if you' re
completely lost, feel free to follow
me.

you can see to your right.
Behind me is the Braun Music
Center, constructed in 1982 to

Behind you to the left is Old Union,

now the student services center.
Old Union was built with funds
provided by former U.S. President
Herbert Hoover, a Stanford alum

As we exit White Plaza back the
same way we came, you'll notice
White Memorial Fountain on your
left. Actually, I didn't even know
that it was named that until I be
came a tour guide, since everybody
here calls it"The Claw." The Claw,
like all of Stanford fountains, is a

great site for fountain-hoping
since it sprays in all direc
tions and is easy to climb. {
Every year during Big

Game Week, a stuffed bear
(usually of the teddy variety) is
impaled upon the top spike of The
Claw by the drum-major of the
Stanford Band. The "Bearial," held
on a Monday in late November, is

the kickofT event of the spirit activ
ities leading up to Big Game.
On your right is Stanford Book
store, a newly renovated facility
that claims to be one of the largest
college bookstores in the nation.
The main level contains nothing
but books, books, and more books.
This doesn't even include the text
book section in the basement. A
computer store, a cafe, a photo lab,
school and office supplies and
everything that has ever had Stan
ford's name stamped on it can also
be found in the bookstore.
Curving between the Bookstore
and the Career Planing and Place
ment Center (which used to be the
Bookstore), we head for the front of
Meyer library, one of Stanford's nu
merous libraries. Stanford's hold
ings include over 5.7 million vol
umes housed in 40 special libraries.
Most libraries contain specialized
holdings — physics, art, law, ect. —
but Meyer and Green (the library
over there to your left) are two gen
eral reference libraries. Green is the
largest, with over 1.6 million vol
umes, while Meyer serves as the in
structional and media services li
brary with a computer cluster and
an audio-visual center.
Right next to us is Rodin's "The
Thinker," part of Stanford's Rodin
collection, the second largest in the
world. While most of the Rodins are
in the B. Gerald Cantor Rodin
Sculpture Garden next to the art
museum, The Thinker was placed
in front of Meyer for, I suppose, in
spirational reasons.
After curving around Green, we
conclude the tour in front of Hoover
Tower, one of the buildings of the

Hoover Institution on War,
Revolution, and Peace, a major re
search center for social, political,
and economic change in the 20th
century. The Tower is primarily a
library, separate from the Univer

sity's holdings. Standing 285 feet
tall, the Tower features an obser
vation platform that provides an
aerial view of campus and a sub
stantial version of the Bay Area.
Finally, to your right is Memo
rial Hall, a large auditorium built
in 1936 from student funds to
honor the students and faculty
that died in World War I. The
lobby is inscribed with their

names, as well as the names of
those who died in World War 11,
the Korean War and the Vietnam
War.
If there are no more questions,
I'd like to conclude the tour and
wish you a pleasant stay at Stan
ford. I'm walking back to the start
ing point to get my bike, so if you' re
completely lost, feel free to follow
me.
Hello, and welcome to Stanford.
I'm your tour guide and I'll be lead
ing you on a no-stress, no-effort
tour of the campus. I have only one
request to make: I walk backwards
through most of the tour, and while
I've gotten good at avoiding large,
non-moving things like buildings, I
have trouble with small animals,
children, vehicles and the like.
Please help me out by warning me
when I'm about to hurt myself.
We'll begin the tour in the front
of the Quad, at Memorial Court. Di
rectly behind you is Palm Drive, the
main entrance to the University.
It's lined with 150 palm trees,
which incidentally aren't indige
nous to the region and must be im
ported.
We'll stop for a minute in the
center of the Quad. Surrounding
you are the 12 original buildings of
the Inner Quad, the part of the
University that existed when the
school opened in 1891. The 16
Outer Quad buildings and Memor
ial Church were added by 1903.
Today, these buildings house many
of the departments of the School of
Humanities and Sciences. Most of
the technical divisions, like physics,
engineering and biology, moved
west of the Quad as their need for
larger research facilities grew.
Memorial Church, directly in
front of you, was built by Jane
Stanford in memory of her hus-

band, who died in 1893, only
two years after the Univer
sity opened. The church
originally had an 80-foot

spire atop it, housing a
large clock and four
bells. Duringthe 1906
San Francisco earth-

quake, the spire
crashed down into
the center of the
§ church, blowing

out the front
wall and de
stroying
most of the

building. Miraculously, the bells
and clock survived the fall. They
now stand at the southwest corner
of the Quad and continue to chime
today.
Unfortunately, when the
church was rebuilt, the original
central supporting system was left
intact. During the 1989 earth
quake, the keystone, the central

supporting stone of the
church's main arches,
slipped an inch out of place.
This damage took four
years to fix and was com-

pleted last year.
Let's head for the
cornerstone, locat- A

Ed at the corner of
building 60. The
Stanfords in- i

sisted on laying
this first stone
of the Univer
sity on May *

14, 1887,

would have
been their

son s
19th

day.
You're
probably
wonder
ing what
all those
num
bered
plaques
are at
your
feet; this
is the
one
question
that just
about
every
tour
group
asks.
These
plaques
actually

begin in front of the church, and
each one is dedicated by the senior
class the day before Commence
ment. The class of 1896 started the
tradition, but '92 through '95
didn't want to be left out, so they
placed theirs retroactively. These
plaques will continue around the
Inner Quad until they once again
reach the front of the church in
2403, 512 plaques later. Former
University President Donald
Kennedy counted the plaques per
sonally when he was provost in
1980.

Each plaque covers a time cap
sule containing memorabilia
chosen by the senior class.

The contents include
things like Stanford Stu
dent ID's, record al
bums, newspapers and
even cans of soda com
»• x 1

memorating the
change in formula of
Coca-Cola.
At this point the
guide attempts to

find a way out of
the south side of
the Quad while

avoiding fenccs
and construction
equipment.
Needless to say,
the 1989 earth
quake hit the
University hard.
The tour emerges
at the southwest
corner of the
Quad.
Remember the
clock and bells I
told you about
earlier from the
Memorial
Church spire?
Well, this clock
tower contains
those original
parts, which
until 1967 had
been in a wood
en tower behind
the church.
We'll head for
White Plaza
now, where
much of

the social activity on campus takes
place. During the school year, ta
bles are set up here by students pro
moting plays and concerts, political
groups, clubs, sports and countless
other activities. Sometimes rock
bands play in White Plaza or up in
