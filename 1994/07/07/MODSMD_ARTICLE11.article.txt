# Judge set to decide on code injunction
## 
### 
Both sides involved in the legal
challenge of Stanford's speech
code had their first day in court
last Thursday, but the brief hear
ing made no progress in clarifying
the extent of permissible free
speech on campus.
Judge Peter G. Stone of the
Santa Clara County Superior
Court heard brief arguments from
the lawyers representing Stanford
and the nine students who fded
the lawsuit. Thursday's hearing
regarded a motion for an injunc
tion to suspend the Grey Interpre
tation of the Fundamental Stan
dard until a trial takes place.
Stone said he would take the
matter under consideration and
make a decision in a couple of
weeks.
There was some confusion as to
whether Judge Stone's ruling on a
request for an injunction against
the speech code would make a trial
unnecessary. According to Iris
Brest, associate general counsel
for the University, it is her under
standing that Judge Stone's forth
coming decision "will be the trial
court's final decision."
Stanford's speech code, adopt
ed in 1990, forbids use of "gutter
epithets and symbols of bigotry"
which express hatred and con
tempt for people because of race,
sex, religion, sexual orientation,
handicap or ethnic origin. Accord
ing to University policy, those
words are forbidden only when
aimed at an individual or small
groups of people and said with the
intent to denigrate them.
The code is an extension of fun
damental Stanford principles that
students are expected to show re
spect for others' rights and that
students should be protected from
"discriminatory harassment," ac
cording to David Heilbron, an out

side lawyer for the University.
But the nine students are chal
lenging the code, saying it goes too
far.
"It's a content-based restric
tion on speech. It infringes on stu
dents' rights to say what they
want," said Robert Corry, a recent
law graduate.
Corry is the lead plaintiff in the
lawsuit challenging the code,
which he contends violates free
speech and discourages discussion
of sensitive issues.
"It creates a chilling effect on
speech," Corry said. Because peo
ple are uncertain of what the code
covers, "they self-censor them
selves to an excessive degree," he
added.
