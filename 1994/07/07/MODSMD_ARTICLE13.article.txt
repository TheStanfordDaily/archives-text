# Benefit cuts loom for transferred workers
## 
### 
University employees working
in the clinical services divisions of
the School of Medicine will have
significantly altered worker bene
fits when their non-union posi
tions are transferred to Stanford
Health Services (SHS) on Septem
ber 1.
One of the changes in worker
benefits includes eliminating tu
ition assistance for all employees
who have not already qualified.
Currently, if University employee
has worked full-time for five
years, he or she is eligible to pay
only one-half tuition if they have a
dependent enrolled in a post-sec
ondary institution.
But since SHS falls under the
hospital's jurisdiction and be
cause the hospital has no tuition
assistance program, employees
who do not meet the eligibility re
quirements by August 31 will not
be able to receive aid, according to
a letter sent last month to all clin
ical staff from the hospital's and
Medical School's personnel of
fices.
Tuition benefits will now also
be taxable, but a supplement will
be added to help minimize the ef
fect of the taxes, the letter
added.
These changes have angered
many of those whose positions will
be affected by the transfer. Julia
Ball, a secretary in the Depart
ment of Pathology, said, "We feel
as though we signed a contract
with management when we were
hired. . . . We just want the bene
fits we were promised when we
took the job."
Darlene Whitney, a research as
sistant in surgical pathology,
added that many employees re
garded the University's Tuition
Grant Program "as the carrot"
that enticed them to work for
Stanford.
Another notable change in
worker benefits will be in the way
time off is handled. In the Univer
sity presently there are separate
time accounts for paid vacations,
personal leave, sick leave and Uni
versity holidays. In the hospital,
however, all these accounts are
combined into one general pool for
each employee, from which they
can earn a maximum of 39 days ofT
per year.
Employees who are to be trans
ferred to SHS and who have accu

mulated hours for sick leave will
be paid for half of those hours
when they leave SHS. Ball said
that she regards this change as pe
nalizing those employees who
have accrued a lot of sick leave
hours "for faithful attendance."
Carol Ann Bergman, manager
of Human Resource Planning,
said the change will make "sick
leave... more valuable when used
as vacation time," since hours will
not be lost if not used.
According to the letter, an em-

ployee ordinarily
does not get cred
it and would not
receive any pay
for unused sick
leave hours when
they leave Uni
versity employ
ment. The letter
also added that
the reason for the
change is that it

provides "greater flexibility of
usage" for sick leave hours.
"We don't pretend to be as gen
erous as the University [in terms
of time ofTJ," Bergman said. She
also added that SHS "has been re
ally up front" about the fact that
there is less time off at the hospital
than at the University.
Ball said that although she en
joys working "for a great universi
ty, the changes are really an in
sult."
"The understanding we had
with the University is null and
void. . . . This is an incredible in
tervention in our lives," she said.
Don Gibbons, director of com
munications at the Medical Cen
ter, said that although he does not
expect any lay-offs during the
transfer of positions, he could not
guarantee anything.
"It takes a lot of time" to choose
who will be offered new positions
with SHS, he added.

According to Bergman, approx
imately 500 employees will be
transferred to SHS. Department
chairs and business managers are
working with CEO Peter Van
Etten, as well as with the chief
medical and operating officers of
SHS, to decide which positions are
clinical — as opposed to academic
— in nature and therefore should
be transferred.
Bergman said that official
transfer letters would be sent out
by July 15.
SHS was created by University
President Gerhard Casper in
order to merge the clinical opera
tions of the Stanford Hospital, the
School of Medicine and closely af
filiated local physicians.
