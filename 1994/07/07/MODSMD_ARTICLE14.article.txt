# Waste negotations continue with DTSC
## 
### 
Five months after the first re
ports of allegations that Stanford
violated certain hazardous waste
laws, the University is still in the
midst of trying to clear its record
with the U.S. Department of
Toxic Substances Control
(DTSC).
The University is negotiating
with state and federal authorities
to settle whether Stanford violat
ed any waste laws and, if so, how
much the University will have to
pay in fines, according to Larry
Gibbs, associate vice-president of
the University Committee on
Health and Safety.
The allegations were first re
ported on Feb. 13 in the San Jose
Mercury News. On May 11 Stan
ford administrators stated they
hoped the affair would be settled
"within the month."
However, Gibbs said he esti
mates the affair will be finally re

solved by the end of the summer.
Allan Hirsch, a state depart
ment official at the Environ
mental Protection Agency, con
firmed that Stanford and the
DTSC "had come a long way and
were close to reaching a settle
ment."
Because the negotiations are
confidential, both sides refused to
comment on any details of the
case.
Gibbs did state that the central
issue is "whether it is appropriate
for industrial-based regulations
to be enforced in a different envi
ronment — the laboratory envi
ronment."
Gibbs stated that "colleges and
universities generate less than
.01 percent of the toxic waste in
this country" but are nonetheless
required to adhere to regulations
aimed at major industrial opera
tions.
Though much attention has
focused on the fine that could be
imposed if Stanford is found in vi
olation of the regulations, Gibbs
added there would be other conse
quences as well.
"Research personnel will have
to relocate their time to adminis
trative details, like paperwork,
required for compliance activity,"
he said, since many of the admin
istrative duties will have to be
carried out locally, rather than
centrally.
Gibbs added that to many in
the research community, such a
measure is seen as both ineffi
cient and a waste of valuable
time.
The settlement also has
raised questions of national con
cern. Many other universities
and research institutions are
worried that if Stanford is forced
to comply, such rigorous legisla
tion will have the adverse effect
of hindering research projects,

thereby giving other countries
"an entrepreneurial edge,"
Gibbs added.
