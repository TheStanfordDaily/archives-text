## Student dances to a World Cup beat Brazil-U.S. matchup causes an advanced stage of soccer mania 
### Jason Waggoner Stuff writer 
Tickets. Tickets. Tickets. Is that all
sophomore Nicole Hacker thought of be
fore the start of World Cup games at
Stanford? "Yup, my immediate thought,
my only thought, was to get tickets."
Didn't she, a poor student like the rest
of us, feel guilty about shelling out $65,
$65 and $85 respectively for three World
Cup matches? "Nope. I'm more than
willing to pay that."
She passed up such enticements as
buying a color television, a quarter's
worth of books or a bus trip to fiesta in
Ensenada. However, Nikki, a standout
soccer player in Modesto, Calif., before
she came to the Farm in 1992, chose her
investment carefully. She wanted some
thing which would provide her with
memories for a lifetime — memories con
sistent with her soccer fanaticism.
"This whole World Cup experience

has been incredible because there are few
things in life I enjoy more than soccer,"
said Hacker.
What's "incredible" is that Nikki is one
of the few Stanford students able to enjoy
the World Cup at a closer distance than
the sports page. She attended the June 26
game between Colombia and Switzerland
and the June 28 grime between Russia and
Cameroon. But the game that
rocked and "samba-ed" for Nikki was the
United States' July 4 battle with soccer
superstars Bebeto and Romario and the
rest of the Brazilian team.
According to Nikki, the U.S. team had
a strong showing in the first half when
their tight defense held the mighty Brazil
ians scoreless. In addition, she felt Brazil's
passing and teamwork seemed to be sub
par. Nikki felt the turning point came just
before the end of the first half. Brazilian
defender Leonardo clocked Tab Ramos in
the head with a vicious elbow, resulting in
a red card for Leonardo and a concussion

for Ramos. "Afler that the Brazilians
clearly dominated. With only ten players
they outmatched the U.S. team and
proved that they are the world's best
team," Nikki said.
Were there other let-downs? "I was
disappointed by Cameroon, they lacked
intensity. I hoped for a better perfor
mance but they just passed the ball
straight to the Russians. Cameroon was
totally outclassed."
All of the World Cup games have
tapped into a reservoir of fond soccer
memories for Nicole. She remembers the
time she broke away from a pack of eight
year-old girls and scored an improbable
goal off the fingertips of an outstretched
goalkeeper. Perhaps the U.S. team could
have used more shots like that on July 4.
Now, a disappointed American team and
one Stanford soccer fanatic in particular
will watch the Brazilians on television as
they beat their drums and battle for their
first World Cup title since 1970.
