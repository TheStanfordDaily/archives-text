## The
						world according to Gump Tom Hanks shines in Zemeckis' gem 'Forrest' 
### 
My first reaction to "Forrest Gump" was,
"How the hell did anyone convince a major
studio to put up money for this movie?" The
plot is sentimental, convoluted, and any
thing but commercial; furthermore, the
movie is lengthy (140 minutes) and filled
with expensive special effects.
The man to thank for all this is director
Robert Zemeckis ("Back to the Future,"
"Who Framed Roger Rabbit"), who has
made a wickedly funny and poignant movie,
the best movie I've seen since last winter.
The film follows the complex life of For
rest Gump (Tom Hanks), whose simple
mind enables him— and the audience — to
view the world in a way never before seen. A
series of accidents, coincidences and mira
cles, Forrest's life is an incredible journey,
during which he experiences the joys and
horrors of college football, the Vietnam
War, the peace movement, shrimp fishing
and eventually fatherhood.
Along the way, his fate becomes inter
twined with famous people and events in
American history, everything from Elvis
Presley to the Watergate break-ins. What
makes the movie so funny is Forrest's igno
rance of these "great" events, which he sim
ply sees as life passing by. It may be a one
joke idea, but the movie is ingenious in the
number of ways it can rewrite history as we
know it.
Credit screenwriter Eric Roth, who
based the screenplay on Winston Groom's
novel, It's a script that has the courage to

undercut tearjearking emotions with point
ed satirical commentary on war, peace, pol
itics, college, and love.
And "Forrest Gump" is no simple-mind
ed farce; the jokes make you think and
sometimes make you squirm. When For
rest's mother, played wonderfully by Sally
Field, is told that her boy's too "different"
to attend a public school, she gets him in by
sleeping with the school psychiatrist. No
matter how uncomfortable the humor is, it
is undeniably hilarious.
Tom Hanks gives a marvelously detailed
and layered portrayal of Forrest, making
him not only amiable but also believable.
His character is so well-drawn that we are
able to understand his view of the world.
Robin Wright is also excellent as Jenny,
Forrest's lifelong true love whose harsh,
unfortunate life turns her into a drifter.
The film is further buoyed by first-rate per
formances by Gary Sinise as an army cap
tain who resents Forrest for saving his life
and Mykelti Williamson as a fellow soldier
who can literally talk for hours about
shrimp. Every character is an original cre
ation and fascinating to watch.
The writing, direction, and acting are so
interesting that one might overlook the
wonderful special effects by Industrial
Light and Magic, which are numerous and
mind-boggling, but never at the expense of
the characters. These effects allow us to see
Forrest interact with three U.S. presidents,
get caught in the middle of a military air

strike in Vietnam, and speak before a rally
of a 100,000 people in front of the Lincoln
Memorial Reflecting Pool.
Digital effects are even used to erase the
legs of a character who has had both legs
amputated. What makes the movie so mag
ical is that these effects serve only to aug
ment scenes. The story would be just as
funny, and the performances would be just
as convincing, without them.
I suppose one of the many messages of
the film is that life is simply a series of acci

dents, and these accidents may turn the
simplest person into a most remarkable
human being. The opening and closing im
ages of the film are of a feather being blown
helplessly and unpredictably through the
air. Representing Forrest's life, this image
can also describe the meandering nature of
the film's plot. It's amazing that in a movie
filled with so many seemingly random
events, everything comes together so com
pletely in the end.
