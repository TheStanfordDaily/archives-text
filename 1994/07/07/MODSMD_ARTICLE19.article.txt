# No sophomore slump for Spin Doctor follow-up
## 
### 
With all the terrible summer
movies out it's nice to know that
there's still some June through
August entertainment out there
where you can get your money's
worth.
On June 14th the latest from
The Spin Doctors, "Turn It Up
side Down," hit local music store

shelves — and what a sound for
sore ears it is.
Not only will Spin Doctors
fans enjoy this new work, but lis
teners who thought "
Pocket Full of Kryptonite"
suffered from the "two-hits
that-sounded-too-much-1 he
same" syndrome will be pleas
antly surprised by the scope of
musical variety on the band's
sophomore effort.
The CD starts out solid with
the first four tracks represent
ing some of the best work on

"Turn It Upside Down." One of
these four, "Cleopatra's Cat,"
starts out with a bluesy scat
mimicked by a twangy guitar
and builds to a foot-thumping,
groovy-ass jam that makes you
want to strut your stuff a la
John Travolta in "Saturday
Night Fever."
Not only does the band ex
plore sounds, but it also investi
gates tempos. "Hungry
Hamed's" for instance shows a
surprising amount of funk-ag
gression for the band. But can
the Spin Doctors ever really
seem angry?
Not really. Here, the more
nonsensical or comical antics of
the band show through in lyrics
like "sometimes they treat you
worse when you say please / they
forget the ham or cheese."
And eventhough the Spin
Doctors are no great movers of
social change, prophets of future
days, or even comedians, they do
get in a few good lines every now
and again.
A few, such as "'Time is just a
concept,' sez Einstein's kid, the
dunce. / 'People's way of keeping
everything from happening at
once," even wax poetic.
But better than reading the
lyrics is listening to the music.
And better than listening to the
music is listening to it again and
again. While some albums push
you into a state of euphoria dur
ing the first listen, they often
wear thin.
But with "Turn It Upside
Down" there will be little
buyer's regret. The more you lis
ten to the disc the better it gets.
With a general atmosphere
that is perhaps more bluesy than
their past work, the Spin Doc
tors are finding their place and

are proving that they were able
to defeat the growing pains of in
stant fame and fortune.
