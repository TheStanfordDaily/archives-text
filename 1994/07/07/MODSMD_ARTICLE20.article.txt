# Action missing from big budget remake of "The Shadow"
## 
### 
"Blown Away" should have
been a exciting psychological
thriller with big explosions.
Instead, it seems like an inferi
or version of "Speed" . . . with
big explosions.
Without the nonstop action
that covered up the poor writing
in "Speed," however, "Blown
Away" is eventually mired in a
script filled with bad dialogue, a
bad premise, and an embarrass
inglnonsensical villain.
Jeff Bridges plays Jimmy
Dove, just married and recently
retired from the Boston Bomb
Squad. Dove's past returns to
haunt him, though, in the form
of Ryan Gaerity (Jones), a radi
cal Irish revolutionary who has
escaped from prison and trav
eled to America to seek revenge
against Dove by killing off his
friends and loved ones with big,
big bombs. What is Gaerity's
motive? Don't ask. You'll cringe
when you find out.
About the only thing going for
the movie is the series of inge
nious explosive devices Gaerity
builds. They're cute Rube Gold
berg contraptions that no self
respecting terrorist would ever
construct, but they're fun to
look at.
Unfortunately, it's obvious
long before the suspenseful
music builds which bombs are

going to explode, which are
going to be defused, and which
supporting characters are going
to die.
Though well-directed by
Stephen Hopkins ("Predator
2"), the explosion scenes are un
dermined by their predictability.
Even worse, no less than three
scenes bear incredible resem
blances to ones in "Speed," in
cluding one in which a car is
rigged to explode if the driver ap
plies the brake.
Dove has to leap onboard the
car from a motorcycle and
defuse the bomb before . . . well,
you get the idea.
The acting ranges from
quirky to downright terrible.
Bridges really doesn't act; he
just seems to be there. Jones
never quite figures out how to
portray his character; conse
quently Gaerity comes off as a
child throwing a pyrotechnic
temper tantrum.
The few sparks of liveliness in
the film come from the support
ing roles, including Suzy Amis
as Dove's new wife, Forest
Whitaker as Dove's cocky re
placement on the squad, and
Jeff's father Lloyd Bridges as
Dove's uncle.
Incredibly, amid all of the
confusion, there is one truly
brilliant sequence which feeds
on audience paranoia. It in
volves two people making lunch,
and as they go around the
kitchen, the camera zeroes in on
all the possible triggering de
vices for a bomb. The suspense is
created by viewing everyday ob
jects in a new light, and the
scene is much more frightening
than any of Gaerity's tricky de
vices.
