Student and summer
guest access to some
S.U. privileges unequal

For many Stanford stu
dents, life on the Farm
during the summer
months is perceived as the slow
est point in the academic year.
The time when many of the peo
ple — instructors, advisors, ad
ministrators and resident fel
lows — and services — the Reg
istrar's Office, Financial Aids,
campus libraries, academic de
partments, Housing and Din
ing, Tresidder, even The Daily
— that students depend on dur
ing the other nine months of the
academic year go on leave or
shut down, either partially or
fully, to capitalize on a reduced
student body.
And while none would deny
that the University does indeed
reduce many of its services for
efficiency's sake over the three
months between graduation
and the arrival of the next ma
triculating class in late Septem
ber, the steady persistence of
the perception of the Farm in
summer as some vast wasteland
frequented mainly by research
types and foreign visitors in
search of a leisurely day of
sight-seeing, is & strange one.
The end of June marks the
beginning of a different grind —
one that focuses instead on the
comforts and needs of the hun
dreds of conference guests who
descend upon University facili
ties with the same vigor demon
strated by most undergradu
ates.
Scratch an honest Universi
ty conference office administra
tor and she'll probably explain
that many of the University's
conference attendees arrive on
campus after paying healthy
sums of cash, expecting to re
ceive many of the same privi
leges that so many Stanford
students feel are the just re
ward for four years of high
school toil and struggle. And for
the most part their expectations
are met.
For the day, week or month
that a conference attendee is on
campus, he is given access to a
slew of University services in

cluding admittance to the Uni
versity's major libraries and
athletic facilities, which effec
tively give him student or facul
ty status — as the case may be
— for the duration of his stay.
The road towards summer
privileges for legitimate Stan
ford students, however, can
sometimes be a great deal
rougher.
For instance, in theory both
the University library system's
and the athletic department's
policy for student summer ac
cess seem reasonable enough:
all a student needs to get into
say, Green Library or Arrillaga
Family Sports Center if he isn't
already registered for summer
classes, is valid University iden
tification from spring quarter.
A quick trip to the Privileges
desk in Green Library where a li
brary employee verifies that a
student is commited to register
for classes during autumn quar
ter before placing a summer
sticker on his or her ID, is all it
takes for the University's li
braries, while getting into an ath
letic facility is even easier: just a
flash of a spring quarter ID.
Both University department
policies seem perfectly uncom
plicated, as they should be ...
until you consider that neither
is very forgiving to the odd stu
dent who has either lost his or
her spring ID or wasn't regis
tered during the spring quarter.
And while the Athletic De
partment's policy makes no al
lowances for students without
spring ID's (no ID, no exercise),
the library policy is only slightly
better, making students pay
$40 just for the privilege of
walking through the door and
another $80 if loan privileges
are needed.
So as summer conference
guests are given almost free
reign of the campus, many Stan
ford students caught without
spring identification find them
selves scrambling to gain access
to the same university that de
clared them Stanford men and
women. Surely, the University
and its departments realize that
those who call Stanford their
alma mater should be entitled to
a standing group of privileges
that can neither be lost nor sold
to the highest bidder.
Stanford students should at
least be entitled to this respect.
