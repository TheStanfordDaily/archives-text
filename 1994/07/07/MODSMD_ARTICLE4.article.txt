## Off-campus, real world blues 
### 
MOST PEOPLE think of
research as one long
repetitive grind. But not
me. I loved my work. For four
summers, I played scientist,
studying schizophrenics.
This summer, however, I've
handed in the familiar puzzle for a
new model. I got a job in retail
sales and a place off campus. No
more mid-day trips for dry ice to
cool me off. No more late night
ethanol binges on Saturdays and
no more spastic mice to slay. This
is going to be my summer of acad
emic abandon. Can you say,
"Rebel?"
Now faced with a daily routine,
liberated from the confines of a
hospital research wing, I fmd my
self in the unusual predicament of
having to find something fun to do
near campus. While there is plenty
of nurturing social interaction
during the school year, such com
munication is undermined by fa
cilitating factors of class cama
raderie and organized bohemian
rituals. But in the summertime we
part from the herd and fend for
ourselves.
No longer is our rent paid in ad
vance and our meals whipped up
by our eating club's chef. Now we
find ourselves lost among the
aisles of Safeway, agog at the infla
tionary price of potato chips. The
shock at the radical change in en

vironment induces a mild vertigo
called the "summer blahs."
Living close to campus hasn't
made coping with them any easier,
but concentrating on neuro
science has. Putting some of the
skills learned in summers past to
work for me, I've managed to alle
viate my own feelings of boredom
with varied success.
The first stop on my therapeu
tic joy ride begins at the cultural
center of our generation. That is,
the repository of intelligent wit
and wisdom. The reflecting pool of
our id. The television. Remember
when they said there's no place
hotter than "Melrose Place?"
Wrong.
Summer months appeal to my
need for instant gratification. The
newest craving is a show called
"Models Inc." What happens
when you throw four ail-Ameri
can, femme fatale models, and
three tall, dark and unctuous men
into a beach house? You get a for
mula for murder, mayhem, and
mischief. (Maybe I should have
put mischief first).
When I'm not watching all of
that provocative television, I try to
work out a little aggression and
sexual frustration. A trip to Arril
laga does the trick. Imagine living
the meat-market lifestyle while
pedaling on the Lifecycle, gazing
at exhilarating glistening athletes

doing push-ups.
But don't think that the gym is
the only confines in which to see
young, pumped-up bodies. Stan
ford, the ultimate athletic, health
conscious (as well as academic) in
stitution also offers a wealth of
outdoor aerobic activities. There is
the traditional volleyball in the
Oval and inline skating in the
Quad.
And thanks to the recent World
Cup craze, even the armchair ath
lete can extend and flex that vital
remote control finger. So every
thing's turning up Brazilian. But
with NBC news declaring that
World Cup Fever has reached epi
demic proportions and our very
own President Clinton rearrang
ing his busy schedule to watch the
USA/Brazil game on the Fourth of
July, can you really blame me for
donning my Umboros and Adid
das, too?
This is my time of exploration
into the uncharted territories of
summer quarter at Stanford. I try
to think of it as a survivalist
course, only you get to use real
bathrooms.
