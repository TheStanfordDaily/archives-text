## The 						last picture show: the Varsity's swan song Imminent demise of 1920s theatre sparks a tense battle in Palo Alto 
### Kyle Graham Editorial staff 
The epitome of California cool,
local real estate developer Charles
"Chop" Keenan confidently ap
proached the Palo Alto City
Council Chamber podium on
Tuesday, unfazed by the chorus
of hisses directed at him by city
residents.
The Palo Altans who gathered
at City Hall had been fuming for
weeks at Keenan's recently an
nounced plan to close the historic
Varsity Theatre and transform
the property into an enormous
bookstore.
Now, the developer was ap
pearing before the Council to
argue for a "bonus plan" granting
him extra retail space in return
for seismic upgrades and historic
preservation efforts. His presence
gave the seething natives the op
portunity they had desired to vent
their anger at both the developer
and a city government they saw as
complicit in Keenan's plans.
Despite the hostile audience of
more than 100, the well-coiffed
and carefully tanned business
man calmly launched into his ap
peal for the measure.
Then, after finishing his sales
pitch, Keenan returned to his
chair and braced for the on
slaught. It arrived on schedule, as
speaker after speaker came to the
podium and proceeded to de
nounce the incoming bookstore,
Keenan, and urban redevelop
ment in general.
Over the course of two often
acrimonious hours, Keenan was
variously labeled a "panhandler,"
a "money-obsessed developer"
and a "finagler." Even at 12 a.m.,
several residents were still await
ing their chance to address the
Council. The onrush of would-be
speakers led the Council to post
pone any decision on the bonus
until September 7 at the earliest.
Tuesday's Council meeting
was just the latest episode in the
ongoing campaign to halt the ren
ovation of the Varsity Theatre, a
battle which has pitted Keenan
and Borders Bookstores, Inc.
against the "Save the Varsity
Campaign" â€” a makeshift al
liance of local bookstores, movie
buffs, historical preservationists
and other groups resisting what
they call the chain-store "mailing
of Palo Alto."
The Last Picture Show
Whatever the outcome of the
fight between Keenan and the
Save the Varsity Campaign, one
fact is clear: tomorrow's showing

of "Cinema Paradiso" and"The
Rocky Horror Picture Show" at
the Varsity will be the last call for
the theatre, a Palo Alto landmark
for 67 years.
Now, the Mission Revival-style
theatre stands slightly the worse
for wear. Its quiet courtyard and
empty theatre display few signs of
life, and the Varsity's peeling
paint and dark interior remind a
visitor of a faded movie queen,
still proud yet aging poorly.
But in its heyday during the
1960s and 19705, the Varsity was
the unchallenged cultural center
of Palo Alto. Under the steward
ship of General Manager Randy
Lutge and his family, the Varsity
hosted packed performances by
Van Morrison, Count Basie and
Buddy Rich, in addition to pho
tography exhibitions, Shake
speare festivals, political assem
blies and, of course, movies.
Film- or concert-goers could
also choose to dine at the Varsi
ty's restaurant, then located
within the theatre's courtyard
but now merely a memory.
According to Lutge, this idyllic
scene changed for the worse after
Keenan bought the property in
1986. "He thought it was hard to
believe that there was so much
footage in Palo Alto going for so
little rent," he said.
At Tuesday's City Council
meeting, Lutge charged that
Keenan "finagled" him out of the
Varsity in order to lease the prop
erty to Landmark Theatres,
which took over the movie house
in 1987. Lutge said that Keenan
coerced his business partners to
accept an agreement under which
they would cede control over the
theatre in return for Keenan's for
giveness of $15,000 in back rent.
However, Keenan has re
mained dissatisfied with the
amount of rent generated by his
lease arrangement with Land
mark, a Southern California
based theatre chain. "(Land
mark) hasn't been making much
money, and we haven't been mak
ing much rent," said Keenan.
"We looked at triplexing the
theatre, and looked at establish
ing a restaurant. However, we
couldn't reconcile these options
with the costs [of operating and
upgrading the theatre], which
were enormous," he added. "We
needed something to correlate
with the $2.5 million in hard costs
resulting from seismic upgrades
and historic preservation."
Eventually, Keenan reached a
20-year lease agreement with
Borders Bookstores, Inc., a chain
owned by the K-Mart Corporation
and based in Ann Arbor, Mich.
The theatre would close, and Bor
ders would develop the Varsity
into a 20-30,000 sq. foot book
store and cafe, to open sometime
next year. In the process, the inte
rior of the theatre would be gut
ted and rebuilt, while the exterior
would largely retain its current
appearance.
News of the arrangement
quickly pricked the ears of histor
ical preservationists, Varsity
lovers and local bookstores alike,
all of whom charged that the
Keenan-Borders agreement
would not only destroy a neigh
borhood treasure but also deal a
mortal blow to the area's many
smaller, independent booksellers.
The Untouchables
One such bookseller is Clark Ke
pler, general manager of Kepler's
Books in Menlo Park. Kepler has
openly admitted that the introduc
tion of a bookstore more than two
times the size of his own into near
by Palo Alto is the primary reason
for his involvement in the Save the

Varsity Campaign. However, he
also stated that he is concerned
about a form of de facto censorship
he sees as triggered by the prolifer
ation of chain bookstores.
"Chain bookstores (like Bor
ders) represent the control of a
few over the reading options of
most people," he said. "As op
posed to 1,000 booksellers mak
ing individual decisions what to
stock, with chains you have two or
three corporate executives decid
ing what's good for the people."

The Varsity's peeling
paint and dark interior
remind a visitor of a
faded movie queen,
still proud but aging
poorly.

Kepler and other members of
the Save the Varsity Campaign
have also stated that if Palo Alto
countenances the proliferation of
chain stores such as Borders, the
city could become "another Sunny
vale," a town built along a strip
highway with no cultural or spiritu
al center.
Keenan has vigorously disput
ed this charge, stating that Palo
Alto has coexisted with chain
stores for decades. "Obviously,
[those critics] haven't been
around Palo Alto for very long,"
he said. "Palo Alto has had a
Woolworth's, Crown Books and
other chains, and even today
there isn't a block downtown
without a chain store on it."
The developer added that he
believes local booksellers' fears
are founded in their pocketbooks,
not their hearts. "They're just
using the old arguments of the
book protectionists," he stated.
"It's a shallow approach, a disin
genuous approach."
Kepler and other local book
store owners are only one of sev
eral bases of opposition to the
Varsity's transformation. Re
cently, a grassroots effort by
preservationists and movie buffs
garnered over 4,000 signatures
on petitions condemning the clos
ing of the theatre.
The "coming out" ceremony
for the official Save the Varsity
Campaign occurred in late May,
at the Palo Alto Planning Com
mission meeting where the com
mission gave its seal of approval
to the "bonus" arrangement. At
the session, several area residents

expressed to the commission their
concerns regarding the Keenan-
Borders arrangement.
Other Save the Varsity Cam
paign members have decried the
Planning Commission itself as
hopelessly compromised, as one
its members, who recused himself
from any Varsity-related matters,
has coordinated the planned re
structuring of the theatre's inte
rior. For one, Lutge stated that
the commission practiced "Chica
go-style politics."
Yet despite the tensions already
apparent at the May meeting, the
real fireworks only began on July
5, when the City Council itself took
up the bonus arrangement.
The Vanishing
Taken alone, the bonus
arrangement appeared fairly in
nocuous; certainly nothing that
could stir up emotions like those
expressed at the July 5 meeting.
Simply put, the plan would reim
burse Keenan for repairing the
Varsity and making the theatre
more earthquake-safe.
It would accomplish this task
by allowing the developer to add
up to 3,700 square feet of retail
space to the Varsity without hav
ing to also create the costly park
ing spaces and amenities required
of other downtown developers.
However, since Palo Alto's cur
rent zoning allows Keenan to ren
ovate the theatre as he wishes,
without having to seek govern
ment approval, the bonus hear
ings provided the only chance for
local residents to voice their anger
with what they saw as Keenan's
greed and the city government's
willingness to fast-track the re
quest of a well-known, well-con
nected developer.
Moreover, despite vows from
Keenan that he would continue
with the Borders arrangement no
matter what the City Council de
cided regarding the bonus plan,
many of the developer's oppo
nents hoped that sinking the
arrangement would make holding
on to the property too expensive,
forcing him to sell.
Many at the Council meeting
seemed to behave as if they were
attending a testimonial to a retir
ing friend. Before the meeting,
clusters of residents discussed
how they had their first job, first
kiss or first date at the Varsity,
and one by one, all with an air of
resignation, they wished it well in
its afterlife.
Yet anger, not resignation, was
the primary sentiment of the day.
The mood at the Chamber was al
ready tense; an earlier debate had
strained many nerves, and by the

time the bonus measure was
taken up it was already 10 p.m.
High Noon
As the clock hit 10, Keenan's
name was called and he stepped to
the podium amid hisses and cat
calls. After a stern warning to the
audience by Mayor Liz Kniss,
Keenan began his statement. He
presented his case to the Council
primarily in economic terms,
likening the theatre to "a set of
shoes, that cost almost as much to
repair as they do to replace."
The developer then changed
his tone, and in the second part of
his appeal appeared to address
the audience. "I think that this
ordinance will facilitate the sav
ing of most important things â€”
the courtyard and facade,"
Keenan said. "It doesn't slam the
door on the memory bank." With
that, he returned to his seat in the
silent Chamber.
A score ot speakers followed
Keenan, all attempting to counter
his sanguine view of the upcom
ing changes. One participant, a
theatre historian from Campbell,
presented a brief history of the
Varsity and spoke of its historical
significance as one of only two
Mission-revival theatres still op
erating in California. Another
resident suggested that the Varsi
ty could somehow be transformed
into a cultural center, a thought
seconded by his successors.
A later speaker suggested that
in order to comply with state reg
ulations, an Environmental Im
pact Report (EIR) would have to
be performed before any renova
tion was begun. Other citizens
quoted poems and zen koans, or
recalled their favorite Varsity
memories.
As the debate continued, accu
sations regarding Keenan's mo
tives and intent grew more and
more pointed. "Mr. Keenan is
willing to sacrifice our future for
his riches," said one woman.
The most direct charges were
made by Lutge, in the most emo
tional speech of the night, one
which served as a culmination to
the meeting. After calling Keenan
a "money-obsessed developer,"
tge turned his ire toward the
ty Council, saying, "shame on
for fast-tracking this theatre
for interior demolition." Several
speakers afterward, the Council
recessed, the matter of the bonus
still unresolved.

ponement of any decision concern
ing the bonus as a "marginal victo
ry," in the words of Lutge.
Save the Varsity Campaign
leaders expressed hope that city
and state leaders would recom
mend an EIR for the theatre, possi
bly forestalling any extensive reno
vation. Yet they also understood
that time was not on their side. "To
some extent, I do feel like I'm rac
ing against the clock," said Lutge.
The former Varsity general

manager attributed the ferocity of
the Council Chambers debate to
two factors. He cited the affection
many Palo Altans have for the
Varsity as behind the much of the
emotion expressed Tuesday night
and added, "there's a certain frus
tration among Palo Alto's older
residents toward the big money
that has recently come into town.
Chop Keenan represents that big,
new money. He's redoing the face
of Palo Alto."
Keenan did not see the bonus
delay as a defeat, however. He
stated that he would carry on with
his redevelopment plans regard
less of the bonus' outcome.

The developer also expressed
dismay with the tenor of Tuesday
night's debate. "People want to at
tack with anything they can, and
when the facts aren't on their side,
they have to play to the emotions,"
he said.
Keen an said he was disappoint
ed by a lack of detail in residents'
plans to have the theatre trans
formed into a community arts cen
ter. "How would the city buy and
pay for a $7-8 million performing
arts center?" he asked.
"I didn't hear any solutions last
night. What I heard instead was
credit-card opposition, 'We'll
charge it to someone.' "

Whatever the outcome of the
Varsity-Borders transition, no one
on either side of the current de
bate doubts what the near future
holds for Palo Alto. "There's going
to be a chain bookstore in Palo
Alto, no matter what a happens in
this situation," said Kepler.
Furthermore, most parties
agree that the new bookstore will
likely have a familiar effect on
other, smaller stores. Kepler
asked, "Look around. Are there
any mom-and-pop grocery stores
left? Any small hardware stores?
And personally, I believe that
books are more important to our
culture than screws are."
