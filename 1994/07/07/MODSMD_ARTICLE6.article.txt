# The 						Unkindest Cut?
## Spending Bill Threatens University-Based Research 
### Frank Guinan Allison Short, Graphic by Kirsten Silvey 
Research in the Ivory Tower won't
be getting any easier now that the
House of Representatives has qui
etly passed a bill that would cut defense re
search funding for the nation's universi
ties by 50 percent.
If the measure, which sailed through the
House last week, gets through the Senate,
it could result in a $40 million drop in
funding for Stanford's researchers. Com
ing in a year of severe budget woes, the ef
fects could be drastic.

In the 1994-95 budget pre
sented in May by Provost Con
doleezza Rice, 23 percent of
next year's revenues — $280
million — was expected to
come from federal support
for research. About 15 per
cent of this total was to come
from the Defense Depart
ment. The recent bill puts
this level of funding in
jeopardy.
Stanford as a politi
cal football
If the Senate passes the
bill as it now stands,
$900 million would be
diverted from academia
— including a possible
$42 million from Stan
ford — to such areas as
strengthening military
readiness, and improv
ing living and working
conditions in military
units, according to Rep.
John Murtha (D-Pa.), who
chairs the House Appropriations
subcommittee on defense and is
the principal designer of the bill.
The push to pass the bill has
been connected to a dispute be
tween Murtha and Rep. George
Brown Jr. (D-Calif.), chair of
the House Science, Space and
Technology Committee. Re
portedly, Murtha was retaliat
ing against Brown's criticism of
his subcommittee's practice of
earmarking funds for specific
university projects. Brown has
also criticized Murtha for "pork
barrel" politics. Murtha, howev
er, insists that the bill is purely a
cost-cutting measure.
During the House's floor de
bate, Brown said, "If this cut
stood, it would directly under
mine the Department of De
fense's science and technology
strategy and the president's
technology plan." He later said
that the funds that are being
cut "represent a critical invest
ment in the future of
both our national se
_ curity and our eco

nomic vitality."
If the bill passes, the funding
of university research that comes
from the Department of Defense
(DOD) would account for less
than one percent of a $243-billion
spending bill. Nevertheless, this
small percentage is a crucial
source of funding for many
schools.
According to Larry Horton, as
sociate vice president for Public
Affairs at Stanford, the funding
is "a very tiny part of the [De
fense] budget, but it is still very
significant" to Stanford.
Although it is difficult to know
at this point exactly how
Murtha's bill could impact the
campus, University Budget Of
fice Director Timothy Warner
said, "There's no question about
it. It's a real concern to us when
ever there is talk of cuts."
Reactions on the Farm
The House's passage of the bill
has many academic institutions
scared and has drawn heavy crit
icism from Stanford officials.
Chemistry Prof. Richard Zare,
a leader in the attempt to in
crease campus awareness con
cerning the measure, said that if
the bill passed, it would be a "na
tional disaster."
"It would hinder the techno
logical program that [President
Clinton] has been advocating,"
Zare said.
Zare has sent a letter to every
member of the U.S. Senate, urg
ing each of them to vote against
the bill. In the letter, he states, "a
reduction (of funding) by 50 per
cent . .. will have a devastating
impact on science, mathematics
and engineering research in this
country."
Before the House passed the
bill, University President Ger
hard Casper — together with the
presidents of the University of
California, USC and Caltech —
sent a letter to all California rep
resentatives which stated that
"cuts of this magnitude will have
a devastating impact on Califor
nia's university-based research

programs."
After the House passed the
bill, Casper sent another letter to
every member of the Senate, urg
ing "that the Senate restore the
DOD university-based research
programs to the levels proposed
by President Clinton."
In his letter, Casper also stat
ed that "the House reductions
. . . would severely curtail critical
and much needed research and . .
. the production of highly trained
scientists and engineers in essen
tial fields of the physical sciences,
including lasers, sensors and
computer science."
Based on figures provided by
Zare, the departments hardest
hit by the bill's cuts would in
clude computer science, mathe
matics and physics. In addition,
industrial and electrical engi
neering would also be severely af
fected.
Craig Heller, acting dean of re
search at Stanford, called the bill
"very short-sighted," saying that
the money which comes from the
Defense Department is "money
for basic research." He cited laser
optics, the Internet and the infor
mation superhighway as exam
ples of innovations triggered by
the department's funding.
Heller said, "[The U.S. is] try
ing to convert a weapons-type in
dustry to a commercial-type in
dustry . . . and we need new ideas
to feed the transition. This is the
wrong time to be cutting back."
Heller also explained that
while current research projects
have contractual agreements and
therefore will not be affected, cer
tain lines of research for new pro
jects have the potential of not
being funded.
The proposed cut underesti
mates the extent of the Defense
Department's funding which is
"critical to improving (our na
tion's) quality of life," Heller
added.
Physics Department Chair
Doug Osheroff said that it would
be "very regrettable if Congress
passes [the bill]." He added that a
lot of research which goes on in
his department is very directed as
well as "very valuable."
Zare later said that the bill is
symptomatic of the fact that the
academic community needs to
clarify that their work is needed.
While many point out the bill's
serious ramifications, there are
still others who feel less threat
ened by the proposed cuts.
Jeffrey Ullman, chair of the
Computer Science Department,
called the bill a "nasty political
ploy."
"It is too ridiculous to contem
plate," Ullman said. "There is no
rational basis for it. . . . It is so
obvious that this is not doing
anybody any good."
Applied Physics Prof. Robert
Byer said he does not think the
bill will pass, and he believes that
all of the funding will be restored
in the Senate.
"This is just political grand
standing," Byer said. He noted,

however, the need for reaction in
the academic community in order
to let the Senate know the conse
quences of such a bill. "We need
to have the Senate act in a re
sponsible way," he added.
Byer said that if the bill pass
es, the Defense Department
would be forced to rethink how to
fund basic research and decide
what projects will continue and
what will be terminated.
The department would then
have to decide how to delegate
the cuts among various universi
ties. Therefore, even if the bill
passes, there is the potential that
Stanford would lose none of the
$42 million it receives from the
Defense Department.
"The highest-quality research
tends to survive," Byer said.
Osheroff added that the
House's passage of the bill is a
bad sign of things to come. "A lot
of people are trying to second
guess where science is going. . . .
IThe bill] poses very bad writing
on the wall for future scientific
research," he said.
Impacts on students
Many graduate students receive
grants and financial aid through
the Defense Department as well
as other government agencies. A
cut in defense research funding,
therefore, would mean a decrease
in the number of students able to
attend graduate school.
In his letter to members of the
Senate, Zare stated that in the
1992 fiscal year, DOD funds ac
counted for 45 percent of gradu
ate students supported by all fed
eral funds in computer sciences,
30 percent of those in engineer
ing, 41 percent of those in electri
cal engineering and 26 percent of
those in mathematics.
"The graduate students re
ceiving DOD support are a select
group; they represent the coun
try's best," Zare stated in his let
ter.
"The future involves not only
questions of research but also
the human perspective," Zare
said. "A diminished number of
graduate students hurts the fu
ture."
John Bravman, assistant
dean of Student Affairs in the
Engineering Department,
agrees that the bill would have a
strong impact on doctorate stu
dents in engineering because
about half of their funding cur
rently comes from the Defense
Department.
"If [the bill] went through in
tact, we would have some serious
issues to address, as would every
one else," Bravman said.
Bravman added that he is bet
ting the bill is not going to sur
vive, particularly in its present
form, because it is simply a "con
test between two Congressmen."
But, he said, "It points out how
vulnerable we always are."
On the other hand, Susan
Haradon, Assistant Director for
the Graduate School's Financial
Aid Office, said that DOD fund

ing does not comprise a large per
centage of graduate student aid
in comparison with Stanford
funding. However, Haradon
added that a larger percentage
could possibly appear in various
grants for research assistants.
Zare said that because gradu
ate students are also involved in
undergraduate education, often
in the form of teaching assis
tants, everyone will be affected

by the proposed cuts.
"There is a sort of netting to
gether, a net impact. . . . We are
all still tied together as one uni
versity," Zare said.
Osheroff added that a 50 per
cent cut would mean a decrease
in an undergraduate's opportuni
ties to be involved in some form of
research.
Laura Selznick, Director of
Undergraduate Research Oppor
tunities (URO), said that al
though all of the URO money for
students is raised by the Univer-

si ty,
the new
bill could still
indirectly affect
them.
"It would affect the re
search environment on campus,"
Selznick said.

She added that the maximum
amount URO awards to students
is $2,500, which often does not
cover both the student's living
and research expenses. Students
obtain the remainder of the
money from faculty grants,
which could potentially be re
duced if the bill passed. As a re
sult, the number of students in
volved in undergraduate re
search would decline unless they
were personally able to cover the
excess charge.
Off-campus impacts
In addition to concerns on cam
pus, officials at universities na
tionwide have expressed criti
cism of this bill. Currently, the
Defense Department awards
money to such universities as
Harvard University, MIT and the
University of Michigan.
The department also gives ap
proximately $100 million in
funds to the University of Cali

fornia system, $50 million to
USC and $16 million to Caltech.
Staff members at Caltech, in
cluding Vice Provost David Good
stein, have emphasized the nega
tive effects that the bill would
have on their university. While in
Washington D.C. last week,
Goodstein and his colleagues
made attempts to express their
complaints to members of Con
gress.

A Lot of People Are Trying To Second-
Guess Where Science Is Going. ... [The
Bill] Poses Very Bad Writing On The
Wall For Future Scientific Research.'
— Doug Osheroff

"They (members of Congress)
heard loud and clear from all the
universities how much it would
hurt us all," Goodstein said.
Goodstein added that he does
not believe the bill will pass in its
present state. He simply calls it
"part of a dogfight between two
Congressmen which will only
hurt innocent bystanders."
Mike Lassiter, director of
News and Communication for
the University of California sys
tem, said that the Defense De
part-

ment
granted $111.8 million
to the UC system during the
1992-93 fiscal year. Although
every UC campus could poten
tially be affected, the UC campus
es with the largest funding in
clude UC-San Diego, UCLA and
UC-Berkeley. According to Las
siter, the UC system's Physical
Science Department, which re
ceives $50 million for defense re
search funding, and the Engi
neering Department, which re
ceives $38 million, would be most
impacted if the bill passes.
Michael Granfield, Vice Chan
cellor of Academic Planning and
Budget at UCLA, agrees that the
bill presents a serious issue
which could greatly affect the
schools' Physics and Engineering
Departments.
However, he said, "It has to do
with a dispute between two con
gressmen ... no one believes that
[in its present] state, it will be
passed."

According to Granfield, "The
universities were told that we
need to let Congress work it out."
He added that the Washington
D.C. representative for the Uni
versity of California said that
congressmen and legislators
were well-informed of the bill's
negative impacts and that uni
versity officials do not need to
continue criticizing the legisla
tion any further.
U.S. Representative Anna
Eshoo, who represents Stanford
as a part of California's 14th Dis
trict, has made frequent state
ments concerning the value of re
search and opposed the 50 per
cent cut.
A spokesperson for Eshoo
stated that the congresswoman
had spoken twice with Murtha
about the bill. Since the legisla
tion passed the

House Appropria
tions subcommittee,
Eshoo is "doing
whatever it takes
— including let
ters and phone
calls to staff' to
prevent the bill
from passing the
Senate, said
Eshoo's spokes
person.
The bill will
head to the Senate
next week, where a
subcommittee will

take it
under con
sideration. If the
bill passes
the Senate, a
conference
committee
will be estab
lished some
time in Sep
tember to look
over the differ
ent versions of
the bill. Then,
the committee
will propose a
final version to
be voted on.

"It has taken
decades to build the
present partner
ship between acade
mic communities
and the govern
ment," Zare said.
"[This bill] could
destroy it in a mat
ter of seconds."

tween Murtha and Rep. George
Brown Jr. (D-Calif.), chair of
the House Science, Space and
Technology Committee. Re
portedly, Murtha was retaliat
ing against Brown's criticism of
his subcommittee's practice of
earmarking funds for specific
university projects. Brown has
also criticized Murtha for "pork
barrel" politics. Murtha, howev
er, insists that the bill is purely a
cost-cutting measure.
During the House's floor de
bate, Brown said, "If this cut
stood, it would directly under
mine the Department of De
fense's science and technology
strategy and the president's
technology plan." He later said
that the funds that are being
cut "represent a critical invest
ment in the future of
both our national se
_ curity and our eco

nomic vitality."
If the bill passes, the funding
of university research that comes
from the Department of Defense
(DOD) would account for less
than one percent of a $243-billion
spending bill. Nevertheless, this
small percentage is a crucial
source of funding for many
schools.
According to Larry Horton, as
sociate vice president for Public
Affairs at Stanford, the funding
is "a very tiny part of the [De
fense] budget, but it is still very
significant" to Stanford.
Although it is difficult to know
at this point exactly how
Murtha's bill could impact the
campus, University Budget Of
fice Director Timothy Warner
said, "There's no question about
it. It's a real concern to us when
ever there is talk of cuts."
Reactions on the Farm
The House's passage of the bill
has many academic institutions
scared and has drawn heavy crit
icism from Stanford officials.
Chemistry Prof. Richard Zare,
a leader in the attempt to in
crease campus awareness con
cerning the measure, said that if
the bill passed, it would be a "na
tional disaster."
"It would hinder the techno
logical program that [President
Clinton] has been advocating,"
Zare said.
Zare has sent a letter to every
member of the U.S. Senate, urg
ing each of them to vote against
the bill. In the letter, he states, "a
reduction (of funding) by 50 per
cent . .. will have a devastating
impact on science, mathematics
and engineering research in this
country."
Before the House passed the
bill, University President Ger
hard Casper — together with the
presidents of the University of
California, USC and Caltech —
sent a letter to all California rep
resentatives which stated that
"cuts of this magnitude will have
a devastating impact on Califor
nia's university-based research

programs."
After the House passed the
bill, Casper sent another letter to
every member of the Senate, urg
ing "that the Senate restore the
DOD university-based research
programs to the levels proposed
by President Clinton."
In his letter, Casper also stat
ed that "the House reductions
. . . would severely curtail critical
and much needed research and . .
. the production of highly trained
scientists and engineers in essen
tial fields of the physical sciences,
including lasers, sensors and
computer science."
Based on figures provided by
Zare, the departments hardest
hit by the bill's cuts would in
clude computer science, mathe
matics and physics. In addition,
industrial and electrical engi
neering would also be severely af
fected.
Craig Heller, acting dean of re
search at Stanford, called the bill
"very short-sighted," saying that
the money which comes from the
Defense Department is "money
for basic research." He cited laser
optics, the Internet and the infor
mation superhighway as exam
ples of innovations triggered by
the department's funding.
Heller said, "[The U.S. is] try
ing to convert a weapons-type in
dustry to a commercial-type in
dustry . . . and we need new ideas
to feed the transition. This is the
wrong time to be cutting back."
Heller also explained that
while current research projects
have contractual agreements and
therefore will not be affected, cer
tain lines of research for new pro
jects have the potential of not
being funded.
The proposed cut underesti
mates the extent of the Defense
Department's funding which is
"critical to improving (our na
tion's) quality of life," Heller
added.
Physics Department Chair
Doug Osheroff said that it would
be "very regrettable if Congress
passes [the bill]." He added that a
lot of research which goes on in
his department is very directed as
well as "very valuable."
Zare later said that the bill is
symptomatic of the fact that the
academic community needs to
clarify that their work is needed.
While many point out the bill's
serious ramifications, there are
still others who feel less threat
ened by the proposed cuts.
Jeffrey Ullman, chair of the
Computer Science Department,
called the bill a "nasty political
ploy."
"It is too ridiculous to contem
plate," Ullman said. "There is no
rational basis for it. . . . It is so
obvious that this is not doing
anybody any good."
Applied Physics Prof. Robert
Byer said he does not think the
bill will pass, and he believes that
all of the funding will be restored
in the Senate.
"This is just political grand
standing," Byer said. He noted,

however, the need for reaction in
the academic community in order
to let the Senate know the conse
quences of such a bill. "We need
to have the Senate act in a re
sponsible way," he added.
Byer said that if the bill pass
es, the Defense Department
would be forced to rethink how to
fund basic research and decide
what projects will continue and
what will be terminated.
The department would then
have to decide how to delegate
the cuts among various universi
ties. Therefore, even if the bill
passes, there is the potential that
Stanford would lose none of the
$42 million it receives from the
Defense Department.
"The highest-quality research
tends to survive," Byer said.
Osheroff added that the
House's passage of the bill is a
bad sign of things to come. "A lot
of people are trying to second
guess where science is going. . . .
IThe bill] poses very bad writing
on the wall for future scientific
research," he said.
Impacts on students
Many graduate students receive
grants and financial aid through
the Defense Department as well
as other government agencies. A
cut in defense research funding,
therefore, would mean a decrease
in the number of students able to
attend graduate school.
In his letter to members of the
Senate, Zare stated that in the
1992 fiscal year, DOD funds ac
counted for 45 percent of gradu
ate students supported by all fed
eral funds in computer sciences,
30 percent of those in engineer
ing, 41 percent of those in electri
cal engineering and 26 percent of
those in mathematics.
"The graduate students re
ceiving DOD support are a select
group; they represent the coun
try's best," Zare stated in his let
ter.
"The future involves not only
questions of research but also
the human perspective," Zare
said. "A diminished number of
graduate students hurts the fu
ture."
John Bravman, assistant
dean of Student Affairs in the
Engineering Department,
agrees that the bill would have a
strong impact on doctorate stu
dents in engineering because
about half of their funding cur
rently comes from the Defense
Department.
"If [the bill] went through in
tact, we would have some serious
issues to address, as would every
one else," Bravman said.
Bravman added that he is bet
ting the bill is not going to sur
vive, particularly in its present
form, because it is simply a "con
test between two Congressmen."
But, he said, "It points out how
vulnerable we always are."
On the other hand, Susan
Haradon, Assistant Director for
the Graduate School's Financial
Aid Office, said that DOD fund

ing does not comprise a large per
centage of graduate student aid
in comparison with Stanford
funding. However, Haradon
added that a larger percentage
could possibly appear in various
grants for research assistants.
Zare said that because gradu
ate students are also involved in
undergraduate education, often
in the form of teaching assis
tants, everyone will be affected

by the proposed cuts.
"There is a sort of netting to
gether, a net impact. . . . We are
all still tied together as one uni
versity," Zare said.
Osheroff added that a 50 per
cent cut would mean a decrease
in an undergraduate's opportuni
ties to be involved in some form of
research.
Laura Selznick, Director of
Undergraduate Research Oppor
tunities (URO), said that al
though all of the URO money for
students is raised by the Univer-

si ty,
the new
bill could still
indirectly affect
them.
"It would affect the re
search environment on campus,"
Selznick said.

She added that the maximum
amount URO awards to students
is $2,500, which often does not
cover both the student's living
and research expenses. Students
obtain the remainder of the
money from faculty grants,
which could potentially be re
duced if the bill passed. As a re
sult, the number of students in
volved in undergraduate re
search would decline unless they
were personally able to cover the
excess charge.
Off-campus impacts
In addition to concerns on cam
pus, officials at universities na
tionwide have expressed criti
cism of this bill. Currently, the
Defense Department awards
money to such universities as
Harvard University, MIT and the
University of Michigan.
The department also gives ap
proximately $100 million in
funds to the University of Cali

fornia system, $50 million to
USC and $16 million to Caltech.
Staff members at Caltech, in
cluding Vice Provost David Good
stein, have emphasized the nega
tive effects that the bill would
have on their university. While in
Washington D.C. last week,
Goodstein and his colleagues
made attempts to express their
complaints to members of Con
gress.

A Lot of People Are Trying To Second-
Guess Where Science Is Going. ... [The
Bill] Poses Very Bad Writing On The
Wall For Future Scientific Research.'
— Doug Osheroff

"They (members of Congress)
heard loud and clear from all the
universities how much it would
hurt us all," Goodstein said.
Goodstein added that he does
not believe the bill will pass in its
present state. He simply calls it
"part of a dogfight between two
Congressmen which will only
hurt innocent bystanders."
Mike Lassiter, director of
News and Communication for
the University of California sys
tem, said that the Defense De
part-

ment
granted $111.8 million
to the UC system during the
1992-93 fiscal year. Although
every UC campus could poten
tially be affected, the UC campus
es with the largest funding in
clude UC-San Diego, UCLA and
UC-Berkeley. According to Las
siter, the UC system's Physical
Science Department, which re
ceives $50 million for defense re
search funding, and the Engi
neering Department, which re
ceives $38 million, would be most
impacted if the bill passes.
Michael Granfield, Vice Chan
cellor of Academic Planning and
Budget at UCLA, agrees that the
bill presents a serious issue
which could greatly affect the
schools' Physics and Engineering
Departments.
However, he said, "It has to do
with a dispute between two con
gressmen ... no one believes that
[in its present] state, it will be
passed."

According to Granfield, "The
universities were told that we
need to let Congress work it out."
He added that the Washington
D.C. representative for the Uni
versity of California said that
congressmen and legislators
were well-informed of the bill's
negative impacts and that uni
versity officials do not need to
continue criticizing the legisla
tion any further.
U.S. Representative Anna
Eshoo, who represents Stanford
as a part of California's 14th Dis
trict, has made frequent state
ments concerning the value of re
search and opposed the 50 per
cent cut.
A spokesperson for Eshoo
stated that the congresswoman
had spoken twice with Murtha
about the bill. Since the legisla
tion passed the

House Appropria
tions subcommittee,
Eshoo is "doing
whatever it takes
— including let
ters and phone
calls to staff' to
prevent the bill
from passing the
Senate, said
Eshoo's spokes
person.
The bill will
head to the Senate
next week, where a
subcommittee will

take it
under con
sideration. If the
bill passes
the Senate, a
conference
committee
will be estab
lished some
time in Sep
tember to look
over the differ
ent versions of
the bill. Then,
the committee
will propose a
final version to
be voted on.

"It has taken
decades to build the
present partner
ship between acade
mic communities
and the govern
ment," Zare said.
"[This bill] could
destroy it in a mat
ter of seconds."


Research in the Ivory Tower won't
be getting any easier now that the
House of Representatives has qui
etly passed a bill that would cut defense re
search funding for the nation's universi
ties by 50 percent.
If the measure, which sailed through the
House last week, gets through the Senate,
it could result in a $40 million drop in
funding for Stanford's researchers. Com
ing in a year of severe budget woes, the ef
fects could be drastic.

In the 1994-95 budget pre
sented in May by Provost Con
doleezza Rice, 23 percent of
next year's revenues — $280
million — was expected to
come from federal support
for research. About 15 per
cent of this total was to come
from the Defense Depart
ment. The recent bill puts
this level of funding in
jeopardy.
Stanford as a politi
cal football
If the Senate passes the
bill as it now stands,
$900 million would be
diverted from academia
— including a possible
$42 million from Stan
ford — to such areas as
strengthening military
readiness, and improv
ing living and working
conditions in military
units, according to Rep.
John Murtha (D-Pa.), who
chairs the House Appropriations
subcommittee on defense and is
the principal designer of the bill.
The push to pass the bill has
been connected to a dispute be
tween Murtha and Rep. George
Brown Jr. (D-Calif.), chair of
the House Science, Space and

said, "There's no question about
it. It's a real concern to us when
ever there is talk of cuts."
Reactions on the Farm
The House's passage of the bill
has many academic institutions
scared and has drawn heavy crit
icism from Stanford officials.
Chemistry Prof. Richard Zare,
a leader in the attempt to in
crease campus awareness con
cerning the measure, said that if
the bill passed, it would be a "na
tional disaster."
"It would hinder the techno
logical program that [President
Clinton] has been advocating,"
Zare said.
Zare has sent a letter to every
member of the U.S. Senate, urg
ing each of them to vote against
the bill. In the letter, he states, "a
reduction (of funding) by 50 per
cent . .. will have a devastating
impact on science, mathematics
and engineering research in this
country."
Before the House passed the
bill, University President Ger
hard Casper — together with the
presidents of the University of
California, USC and Caltech —
sent a letter to all California rep
resentatives which stated that
"cuts of this magnitude will have
a devastating impact on Califor
nia's university-based research

programs."
After the House passed the
bill, Casper sent another letter to
every member of the Senate, urg
ing "that the Senate restore the
DOD university-based research
programs to the levels proposed
by President Clinton."
In his letter, Casper also stat
ed that "the House reductions
. . . would severely curtail critical
and much needed research and . .
. the production of highly trained
scientists and engineers in essen
tial fields of the physical sciences,
including lasers, sensors and
computer science."
Based on figures provided by
Zare, the departments hardest
hit by the bill's cuts would in
clude computer science, mathe
matics and physics. In addition,
industrial and electrical engi
neering would also be severely af
fected.
Craig Heller, acting dean of re
search at Stanford, called the bill
"very short-sighted," saying that
the money which comes from the
Defense Department is "money
for basic research." He cited laser
optics, the Internet and the infor
mation superhighway as exam
ples of innovations triggered by
the department's funding.
Heller said, "[The U.S. is] try
ing to convert a weapons-type in
dustry to a commercial-type in
dustry . . . and we need new ideas
to feed the transition. This is the
wrong time to be cutting back."
Heller also explained that
while current research projects
have contractual agreements and
therefore will not be affected, cer
tain lines of research for new pro
jects have the potential of not
being funded.
The proposed cut underesti
mates the extent of the Defense
Department's funding which is
"critical to improving (our na
tion's) quality of life," Heller
added.
Physics Department Chair
Doug Osheroff said that it would
be "very regrettable if Congress
passes [the bill]." He added that a
lot of research which goes on in
his department is very directed as
well as "very valuable."
Zare later said that the bill is
symptomatic of the fact that the
academic community needs to
clarify that their work is needed.
While many point out the bill's
serious ramifications, there are
still others who feel less threat
ened by the proposed cuts.
Jeffrey Ullman, chair of the
Computer Science Department,
called the bill a "nasty political
ploy."
"It is too ridiculous to contem
plate," Ullman said. "There is no
rational basis for it. . . . It is so
obvious that this is not doing
anybody any good."
Applied Physics Prof. Robert
Byer said he does not think the
bill will pass, and he believes that
all of the funding will be restored
in the Senate.
"This is just political grand
standing," Byer said. He noted,

however, the need for reaction in
the academic community in order
to let the Senate know the conse
quences of such a bill. "We need
to have the Senate act in a re
sponsible way," he added.
Byer said that if the bill pass
es, the Defense Department
would be forced to rethink how to
fund basic research and decide
what projects will continue and
what will be terminated.
The department would then
have to decide how to delegate
the cuts among various universi
ties. Therefore, even if the bill
passes, there is the potential that
Stanford would lose none of the
$42 million it receives from the
Defense Department.
"The highest-quality research
tends to survive," Byer said.
Osheroff added that the
House's passage of the bill is a
bad sign of things to come. "A lot
of people are trying to second
guess where science is going. . . .
IThe bill] poses very bad writing
on the wall for future scientific
research," he said.
Impacts on students
Many graduate students receive
grants and financial aid through
the Defense Department as well
as other government agencies. A
cut in defense research funding,
therefore, would mean a decrease
in the number of students able to
attend graduate school.
In his letter to members of the
Senate, Zare stated that in the
1992 fiscal year, DOD funds ac
counted for 45 percent of gradu
ate students supported by all fed
eral funds in computer sciences,
30 percent of those in engineer
ing, 41 percent of those in electri
cal engineering and 26 percent of
those in mathematics.
"The graduate students re
ceiving DOD support are a select
group; they represent the coun
try's best," Zare stated in his let
ter.
"The future involves not only
questions of research but also
the human perspective," Zare
said. "A diminished number of
graduate students hurts the fu
ture."
John Bravman, assistant
dean of Student Affairs in the
Engineering Department,
agrees that the bill would have a
strong impact on doctorate stu
dents in engineering because
about half of their funding cur
rently comes from the Defense
Department.
"If [the bill] went through in
tact, we would have some serious
issues to address, as would every
one else," Bravman said.
Bravman added that he is bet
ting the bill is not going to sur
vive, particularly in its present
form, because it is simply a "con
test between two Congressmen."
But, he said, "It points out how
vulnerable we always are."
On the other hand, Susan
Haradon, Assistant Director for
the Graduate School's Financial
Aid Office, said that DOD fund

ing does not comprise a large per
centage of graduate student aid
in comparison with Stanford
funding. However, Haradon
added that a larger percentage
could possibly appear in various
grants for research assistants.
Zare said that because gradu
ate students are also involved in
undergraduate education, often
in the form of teaching assis
tants, everyone will be affected

by the proposed cuts.
"There is a sort of netting to
gether, a net impact. . . . We are
all still tied together as one uni
versity," Zare said.
Osheroff added that a 50 per
cent cut would mean a decrease
in an undergraduate's opportuni
ties to be involved in some form of
research.
Laura Selznick, Director of
Undergraduate Research Oppor
tunities (URO), said that al
though all of the URO money for
students is raised by the Univer-

si ty,
the new
bill could still
indirectly affect
them.
"It would affect the re
search environment on campus,"
Selznick said.

She added that the maximum
amount URO awards to students
is $2,500, which often does not
cover both the student's living
and research expenses. Students
obtain the remainder of the
money from faculty grants,
which could potentially be re
duced if the bill passed. As a re
sult, the number of students in
volved in undergraduate re
search would decline unless they
were personally able to cover the
excess charge.
Off-campus impacts
In addition to concerns on cam
pus, officials at universities na
tionwide have expressed criti
cism of this bill. Currently, the
Defense Department awards
money to such universities as
Harvard University, MIT and the
University of Michigan.
The department also gives ap
proximately $100 million in
funds to the University of Cali

fornia system, $50 million to
USC and $16 million to Caltech.
Staff members at Caltech, in
cluding Vice Provost David Good
stein, have emphasized the nega
tive effects that the bill would
have on their university. While in
Washington D.C. last week,
Goodstein and his colleagues
made attempts to express their
complaints to members of Con
gress.

A Lot of People Are Trying To Second-
Guess Where Science Is Going. ... [The
Bill] Poses Very Bad Writing On The
Wall For Future Scientific Research.'
— Doug Osheroff

"They (members of Congress)
heard loud and clear from all the
universities how much it would
hurt us all," Goodstein said.
Goodstein added that he does
not believe the bill will pass in its
present state. He simply calls it
"part of a dogfight between two
Congressmen which will only
hurt innocent bystanders."
Mike Lassiter, director of
News and Communication for
the University of California sys
tem, said that the Defense De
part-

ment
granted $111.8 million
to the UC system during the
1992-93 fiscal year. Although
every UC campus could poten
tially be affected, the UC campus
es with the largest funding in
clude UC-San Diego, UCLA and
UC-Berkeley. According to Las
siter, the UC system's Physical
Science Department, which re
ceives $50 million for defense re
search funding, and the Engi
neering Department, which re
ceives $38 million, would be most
impacted if the bill passes.
Michael Granfield, Vice Chan
cellor of Academic Planning and
Budget at UCLA, agrees that the
bill presents a serious issue
which could greatly affect the
schools' Physics and Engineering
Departments.
However, he said, "It has to do
with a dispute between two con
gressmen ... no one believes that
[in its present] state, it will be
passed."

According to Granfield, "The
universities were told that we
need to let Congress work it out."
He added that the Washington
D.C. representative for the Uni
versity of California said that
congressmen and legislators
were well-informed of the bill's
negative impacts and that uni
versity officials do not need to
continue criticizing the legisla
tion any further.
U.S. Representative Anna
Eshoo, who represents Stanford
as a part of California's 14th Dis
trict, has made frequent state
ments concerning the value of re
search and opposed the 50 per
cent cut.
A spokesperson for Eshoo
stated that the congresswoman
had spoken twice with Murtha
about the bill. Since the legisla
tion passed the

House Appropria
tions subcommittee,
Eshoo is "doing
whatever it takes
— including let
ters and phone
calls to staff' to
prevent the bill
from passing the
Senate, said
Eshoo's spokes
person.
The bill will
head to the Senate
next week, where a
subcommittee will

take it
under con
sideration. If the
bill passes
the Senate, a
conference
committee
will be estab
lished some
time in Sep
tember to look
over the differ
ent versions of
the bill. Then,
the committee
will propose a
final version to
be voted on.

"It has taken
decades to build the
present partner
ship between acade
mic communities
and the govern
ment," Zare said.
"[This bill] could
destroy it in a mat
ter of seconds."


Research in the Ivory Tower won't
be getting any easier now that the
House of Representatives has qui
etly passed a bill that would cut defense re
search funding for the nation's universi
ties by 50 percent.
If the measure, which sailed through the
House last week, gets through the Senate,
it could result in a $40 million drop in
funding for Stanford's researchers. Com
ing in a year of severe budget woes, the ef
fects could be drastic.

In the 1994-95 budget pre
sented in May by Provost Con
doleezza Rice, 23 percent of
next year's revenues — $280
million — was expected to
come from federal support
for research. About 15 per
cent of this total was to come
from the Defense Depart
ment. The recent bill puts
this level of funding in
jeopardy.
Stanford as a politi
cal football
If the Senate passes the
bill as it now stands,
$900 million would be
diverted from academia
— including a possible
$42 million from Stan
ford — to such areas as
strengthening military
readiness, and improv
ing living and working
conditions in military
units, according to Rep.
John Murtha (D-Pa.), who
chairs the House Appropriations
subcommittee on defense and is
the principal designer of the bill.
The push to pass the bill has
been connected to a dispute be
tween Murtha and Rep. George
Brown Jr. (D-Calif.), chair of
the House Science, Space and
Technology Committee. Re
portedly, Murtha was retaliat
ing against Brown's criticism of
his subcommittee's practice of
earmarking funds for specific
university projects. Brown has
also criticized Murtha for "pork
barrel" politics. Murtha, howev
er, insists that the bill is purely a
cost-cutting measure.
During the House's floor de
bate, Brown said, "If this cut
stood, it would directly under
mine the Department of De
fense's science and technology
strategy and the president's
technology plan." He later said
that the funds that are being
cut "represent a critical invest
ment in the future of
both our national se
_ curity and our eco

nomic vitality."
If the bill passes, the funding
of university research that comes
from the Department of Defense
(DOD) would account for less
than one percent of a $243-billion
spending bill. Nevertheless, this
small percentage is a crucial
source of funding for many
schools.
According to Larry Horton, as
sociate vice president for Public
Affairs at Stanford, the funding
is "a very tiny part of the [De
fense] budget, but it is still very
significant" to Stanford.
Although it is difficult to know
at this point exactly how
Murtha's bill could impact the
campus, University Budget Of
fice Director Timothy Warner
said, "There's no question about
it. It's a real concern to us when
ever there is talk of cuts."

. . . would severely curtail critical
and much needed research and . .
. the production of highly trained
scientists and engineers in essen
tial fields of the physical sciences,
including lasers, sensors and
computer science."
Based on figures provided by
Zare, the departments hardest
hit by the bill's cuts would in
clude computer science, mathe
matics and physics. In addition,
industrial and electrical engi
neering would also be severely af
fected.
Craig Heller, acting dean of re
search at Stanford, called the bill
"very short-sighted," saying that
the money which comes from the
Defense Department is "money
for basic research." He cited laser
optics, the Internet and the infor
mation superhighway as exam
ples of innovations triggered by
the department's funding.
Heller said, "[The U.S. is] try
ing to convert a weapons-type in
dustry to a commercial-type in
dustry . . . and we need new ideas
to feed the transition. This is the
wrong time to be cutting back."
Heller also explained that
while current research projects
have contractual agreements and
therefore will not be affected, cer
tain lines of research for new pro
jects have the potential of not
being funded.
The proposed cut underesti
mates the extent of the Defense
Department's funding which is
"critical to improving (our na
tion's) quality of life," Heller
added.
Physics Department Chair
Doug Osheroff said that it would
be "very regrettable if Congress
passes [the bill]." He added that a
lot of research which goes on in
his department is very directed as
well as "very valuable."
Zare later said that the bill is
symptomatic of the fact that the
academic community needs to
clarify that their work is needed.
While many point out the bill's
serious ramifications, there are
still others who feel less threat
ened by the proposed cuts.
Jeffrey Ullman, chair of the
Computer Science Department,
called the bill a "nasty political
ploy."
"It is too ridiculous to contem
plate," Ullman said. "There is no
rational basis for it. . . . It is so
obvious that this is not doing
anybody any good."
Applied Physics Prof. Robert
Byer said he does not think the
bill will pass, and he believes that
all of the funding will be restored
in the Senate.
"This is just political grand
standing," Byer said. He noted,

however, the need for reaction in
the academic community in order
to let the Senate know the conse
quences of such a bill. "We need
to have the Senate act in a re
sponsible way," he added.
Byer said that if the bill pass
es, the Defense Department
would be forced to rethink how to
fund basic research and decide
what projects will continue and
what will be terminated.
The department would then
have to decide how to delegate
the cuts among various universi
ties. Therefore, even if the bill
passes, there is the potential that
Stanford would lose none of the
$42 million it receives from the
Defense Department.
"The highest-quality research
tends to survive," Byer said.
Osheroff added that the
House's passage of the bill is a
bad sign of things to come. "A lot
of people are trying to second
guess where science is going. . . .
IThe bill] poses very bad writing
on the wall for future scientific
research," he said.
Impacts on students
Many graduate students receive
grants and financial aid through
the Defense Department as well
as other government agencies. A
cut in defense research funding,
therefore, would mean a decrease
in the number of students able to
attend graduate school.
In his letter to members of the
Senate, Zare stated that in the
1992 fiscal year, DOD funds ac
counted for 45 percent of gradu
ate students supported by all fed
eral funds in computer sciences,
30 percent of those in engineer
ing, 41 percent of those in electri
cal engineering and 26 percent of
those in mathematics.
"The graduate students re
ceiving DOD support are a select
group; they represent the coun
try's best," Zare stated in his let
ter.
"The future involves not only
questions of research but also
the human perspective," Zare
said. "A diminished number of
graduate students hurts the fu
ture."
John Bravman, assistant
dean of Student Affairs in the
Engineering Department,
agrees that the bill would have a
strong impact on doctorate stu
dents in engineering because
about half of their funding cur
rently comes from the Defense
Department.
"If [the bill] went through in
tact, we would have some serious
issues to address, as would every
one else," Bravman said.
Bravman added that he is bet
ting the bill is not going to sur
vive, particularly in its present
form, because it is simply a "con
test between two Congressmen."
But, he said, "It points out how
vulnerable we always are."
On the other hand, Susan
Haradon, Assistant Director for
the Graduate School's Financial
Aid Office, said that DOD fund

ing does not comprise a large per
centage of graduate student aid
in comparison with Stanford
funding. However, Haradon
added that a larger percentage
could possibly appear in various
grants for research assistants.
Zare said that because gradu
ate students are also involved in
undergraduate education, often
in the form of teaching assis
tants, everyone will be affected

by the proposed cuts.
"There is a sort of netting to
gether, a net impact. . . . We are
all still tied together as one uni
versity," Zare said.
Osheroff added that a 50 per
cent cut would mean a decrease
in an undergraduate's opportuni
ties to be involved in some form of
research.
Laura Selznick, Director of
Undergraduate Research Oppor
tunities (URO), said that al
though all of the URO money for
students is raised by the Univer-

si ty,
the new
bill could still
indirectly affect
them.
"It would affect the re
search environment on campus,"
Selznick said.

She added that the maximum
amount URO awards to students
is $2,500, which often does not
cover both the student's living
and research expenses. Students
obtain the remainder of the
money from faculty grants,
which could potentially be re
duced if the bill passed. As a re
sult, the number of students in
volved in undergraduate re
search would decline unless they
were personally able to cover the
excess charge.
Off-campus impacts
In addition to concerns on cam
pus, officials at universities na
tionwide have expressed criti
cism of this bill. Currently, the
Defense Department awards
money to such universities as
Harvard University, MIT and the
University of Michigan.
The department also gives ap
proximately $100 million in
funds to the University of Cali

fornia system, $50 million to
USC and $16 million to Caltech.
Staff members at Caltech, in
cluding Vice Provost David Good
stein, have emphasized the nega
tive effects that the bill would
have on their university. While in
Washington D.C. last week,
Goodstein and his colleagues
made attempts to express their
complaints to members of Con
gress.

A Lot of People Are Trying To Second-
Guess Where Science Is Going. ... [The
Bill] Poses Very Bad Writing On The
Wall For Future Scientific Research.'
— Doug Osheroff

"They (members of Congress)
heard loud and clear from all the
universities how much it would
hurt us all," Goodstein said.
Goodstein added that he does
not believe the bill will pass in its
present state. He simply calls it
"part of a dogfight between two
Congressmen which will only
hurt innocent bystanders."
Mike Lassiter, director of
News and Communication for
the University of California sys
tem, said that the Defense De
part-

ment
granted $111.8 million
to the UC system during the
1992-93 fiscal year. Although
every UC campus could poten
tially be affected, the UC campus
es with the largest funding in
clude UC-San Diego, UCLA and
UC-Berkeley. According to Las
siter, the UC system's Physical
Science Department, which re
ceives $50 million for defense re
search funding, and the Engi
neering Department, which re
ceives $38 million, would be most
impacted if the bill passes.
Michael Granfield, Vice Chan
cellor of Academic Planning and
Budget at UCLA, agrees that the
bill presents a serious issue
which could greatly affect the
schools' Physics and Engineering
Departments.
However, he said, "It has to do
with a dispute between two con
gressmen ... no one believes that
[in its present] state, it will be
passed."

According to Granfield, "The
universities were told that we
need to let Congress work it out."
He added that the Washington
D.C. representative for the Uni
versity of California said that
congressmen and legislators
were well-informed of the bill's
negative impacts and that uni
versity officials do not need to
continue criticizing the legisla
tion any further.
U.S. Representative Anna
Eshoo, who represents Stanford
as a part of California's 14th Dis
trict, has made frequent state
ments concerning the value of re
search and opposed the 50 per
cent cut.
A spokesperson for Eshoo
stated that the congresswoman
had spoken twice with Murtha
about the bill. Since the legisla
tion passed the

House Appropria
tions subcommittee,
Eshoo is "doing
whatever it takes
— including let
ters and phone
calls to staff' to
prevent the bill
from passing the
Senate, said
Eshoo's spokes
person.
The bill will
head to the Senate
next week, where a
subcommittee will

take it
under con
sideration. If the
bill passes
the Senate, a
conference
committee
will be estab
lished some
time in Sep
tember to look
over the differ
ent versions of
the bill. Then,
the committee
will propose a
final version to
be voted on.

"It has taken
decades to build the
present partner
ship between acade
mic communities
and the govern
ment," Zare said.
"[This bill] could
destroy it in a mat
ter of seconds."
