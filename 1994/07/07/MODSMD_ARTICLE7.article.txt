## Coffee House robbed at gunpoint Tuesday night Police now searching for suspect; CoHo workers bound, two pistol-whipped 
### Patricia Henley 
Armed with a handgun, a robber terror
ized six employees of the Coffee House late
Tuesday night, escaping with an undis
closed amount of money after cleaning out
the establishment's safe.
"He took everything. He didn't worry
about carrying the quarters," said Mary
Clark, general manager for Bon Appetit,
the company which manages the Coffee
House.
The robbery occurred as Coffee House
employees were cleaning up after the 11
p.m. closing. The suspect "appeared out of
nowhere" at about 11:45 p.m., said Capt.

Raoul Niemeyer of the Stanford Police De

partment. All entrances to
the Coffee House were
thought to be secured, and
police said the suspect's
means of entry is still being
investigated.
The robber ordered the
employees — two students,
three staff members and a
night manager — into the
office area, Clark said.
After ripping the phone out
of the wall, he demanded

that the manager open the safe.
The manager had difficulty getting the

safe open, Clark said. "She was really ner
vous. He (the robber) was (also) very ner
vous."
Under orders from the suspect, the Cof
fee House employees tied one another with
cords, Niemeyer said. Before leaving, the
suspect pistol-whipped two of the employ
ees. They were later treated by paramedics
for head wounds.
The suspect locked the office door before
leaving, Clark said. The employees man
aged to free themselves in about five min
utes. They went immediately to a nearby
phone in the Recreation Center to call cam
pus police.
Tresidder officials are already taking

steps to ensure that a similar event never
occurs again. "We're in the process of in
stalling a silent, under-the-counter alarm,"
said Clark.
Witnesses described the robber as a
black man between 20 and 30 years old,
about 5-foot-7 and with a stocky build,
Niemeyer said . The suspect wore a black
nylon stocking mask and dark clothing.
The suspect might have put on what ap
peared to be a ski mask while in a parked ve
hicle on Escondido Road near Stern Hall,
Niemeyer said. Anyone who saw the sus
pect at any time should contact the investi
gating officer, Sgt. John McMullen of the
Stanford police, at (415) 723-9633.
