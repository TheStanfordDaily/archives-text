# Irwin pleads not guilty to vandalism charges
## 
### Janar Stewart Staff writer 
With a potential $10,000 fine
and possible jail time looming in
his near future, junior Thomas
Irwin entered a not-guilty plea
to felony vandalism charges at a
Palo Alto court last Friday.
Irwin is one of the eight Stan
ford athletes accused with van
dalizing the Stanford campus
statue, "Gay Liberation," in
May. He and junior Todd Laßoc
ca are the only two students fac
ing felony charges as a result of
the act.
"This was a serious incident.
It affected a lot of people," said
John Hackmann, Irwin's
lawyer, shortly after the hear
ing. "It needs to be resolved."
Hackmann likened the inci
dent, in which the $150,000
bronze statue was bashed with a
park bench and splattered with
black paint, to the Gunn High
School students' senior class
joke.
"End of the year pranks tend
to get out of hand," he said,
speaking of both the Gunn stu
dents' gag, which blew up a
fountain and injured 18 kids,
and the Stanford athletes' al
leged defacement of the contro
versial sculpture.
The eyes of the court view the
college students' suspected be
havior in the same light as the
senior-class fiasco, he contin

ued, mentioning that both
groups of students are "charged
with felonies."
Hackmann also said that the
vandalism was unfortunate, yet
added, "When all the layers are
pulled away, it's basically a graf
fiti/vandalism case."
Although Laßocca admitted
in a statement to police that he
felt offended when looking at
the statue and another accused
athlete, sophomore Robert
Gardner, said he was homopho
bic, none of the athletes will be
tried for committing a hate
crime.
Under hate-crime statutes,
prosecution only can occur when
an individual's civil rights have
been violated. In this case, the
act damaged the property of an
institution, Stanford Universi
ty.
Hackmann commended the
Santa Clara County judicial sys
tem, saying that it is "pretty
good" at handling cases like this.
Irwin's lawyer also hinted at
a possible punishment for the
athletes, should they be found
guilty. "I expect the statue will
be repaired," he said, though he
added because of significant,
pre-existing damage to the stat
ue, it is "not clear" as to whether
there is more that the students
could fix.
"I was surprised that the stat
ue already had graffiti on it,"he
said.
