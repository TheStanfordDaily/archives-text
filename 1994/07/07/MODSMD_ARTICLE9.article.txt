## Animal-rights group alleges a 14-year pattern of abuse by Stanford researchers 
### Justin Pollard 
A group of Stanford students
filed a complaint Tuesday with
the U.S. Department of Agricul
ture, alleging that Stanford Uni
versity researchers have a record
of abusing and neglecting labora
tory animals since 1980.
The complaint, filed by the
Stanford Animal Protection and
Education Society (SAPES),
claims that over the past 14 years
Stanford has, among other
things, repeatedly kept animals
in filthy cages, allowed fecal mat
ter in animal feed and used out
dated drugs. It also alleges that
the University left animals unat
tended to die after surgery and
has improperly trained research
personnel, both violations of the
Animal Welfare Act.
SAPES president Nathan
Winograd, a Stanford law stu
dent, said the evidence used in the
complaint was obtained from past
USDA inspection reports ob
tained under the Freedom of In
formation Act. The group is re

questing a new USDA investiga
tion of animal research practices
at Stanford.
Stanford Medical Center
spokesman Don Gibbons claims
that all of the problems men
tioned in the complaint are at
least a year old and have already
been rectified.
"The USDA agrees with us
that these are old allegations that
have already been taken care of,"
said Gibbons.
He said that the only response
he expects from the USDA would
be to verify that the past prob
lems have in fact been corrected, a
step he expects the University to
take. Gibbons added that he be
lieves Winograd filed the com
plaint because he doesn't think
"we should be doing research on
animals."
Winograd admitted that the
"individual incidents were cor
rected," but said "that does not
account for the ongoing pattern"
of violations being found by
USDA inspectors and then cor
rected by Stanford. Winograd
said one of the goals of the com
plaint is to prevent the viola
tions from occurring in the first
place.
He added that he and the other
members of SAPES are not op
posed to animal research in gen
eral, but they believe that "if ani
mals have to be used in research,
it must be done humanely."
