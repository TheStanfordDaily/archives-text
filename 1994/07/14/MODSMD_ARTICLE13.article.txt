# Comp Sci groundbreaking set
## 
### 
Groundbreaking is scheduled
to begin within the next month on
a new $34 million computer sci
ence building, a project largely
funded by a $6 million donation
from Microsoft Corporation co
founder Bill Gates.
The Gates Information Sci
ences Building will unite both
technology and people by consoli
dating the Computer Science De
partment under one roof.
Gates, who donated the money
in 1992, said then that he made
the gift "to invest in the future of
the industry, and Stanford is one
of the five best computer science
schools in the country, one where

many fundamental break
throughs have occurred."
According to Olivier Pieron,
Stanford's project manager, there
was a "very slight delay" of one to
two weeks while construction
drawings were completed. These
have now been sent out for bidding
by sub-contractors and work
should begin "by the end of July or
early August," said Pieron.
Gates is the single largest donor
to the project and incoming Com
puter Science Department Chair
John Hennessy notes that "all fund
ing is secured" for the building.
Hennessy said he is excited
about the project, which will con-

solidate the department. Current
ly administrative offices, laborato
ries, classrooms and faculty offices
are spread across the campus in at
least seven buildings.
"People in the department
were very limited in their ability to
interact with each other because
of geographical barriers," said
Hennessy.
Hennessy also pointed out that
the new building will unite various
computer technologies, such as ar
tificial intelligence and database
technology.
The expected date of comple
tion is December 1995.
