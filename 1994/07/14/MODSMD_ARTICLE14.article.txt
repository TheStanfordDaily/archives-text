# A 						postal push
## Meeting held to improve service 
### 
How many lost letters and
customer complaints does it
take to spur the Stanford Post
Office to improve its service?
Representatives from the
U.S. Postal Service, Congress
woman Anna Eshoo's office, the
ASSU, the Council of Presi
dents and the University con
vened in Tresidder's Birch
Room yesterday to tackle that
question.
The meeting resulted in little
agreement among the partici
pants, with the eventual estab
lishment of an action commit
tee designed to improve service
at the post office the only con
sensus view.
One major stumbling block
at the meeting was the group's
inability to agree exactly where
and why mail service goes awry.
The majority of the participants
agreed that mail service on cam
pus merits improvement, but
specific solutions were few and
far between.
Early in the meeting, after
reading the lit any of complaints
regarding the post office pre
sented at the meeting by ASSU
Summer Senate Chair Stephen
Itussell and Paul Von Hippel, a
graduate student who is also
the founder of Stop Cursing the

Dark (SCuD), Palo Alto Post
master Masyuki Sato suggested
that the delays resulted from
what he termed the Stanford
Post Office's "uniqueness."
Later, Stanford Station
Manager Jim Ruiz denied that
understaffmg was behind any
inefficiencies at the post office.
"We're staffed to where we can
handle all the mail that comes
through," he said.
However, Ruiz added that he
was looking into creating a new
system at the post office where
by the number of employees
working ut a given time was syn
chronized with the mail volume.
The student representatives,
which included COP member
Anietie Ekanem, also brought
forward charges against the
post office in addition to poor
service."l've received com
plaints ranging from slow deliv
ery to harassment to intimida
tion from students," said Rus
sell.
Out of the dialogue sprang
an agreement to form on action
committee, to consist of three
Post Office representatives
and as many Stanford represen
tatives as the ASSU deems nec
essary to cover all of its con
stituents.
