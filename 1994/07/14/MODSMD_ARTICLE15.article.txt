# Repair work begins on Palm Drive area
## 
### 
After being designed in the
1880s to accommodate horse-and
huggy traffic, Palm Drive is final
ly getting a complete $3 million
facelift to meet the demands of the
automobile.
Complete reconstruction of the
road began Monday and is not ex
pected to be completed until Sept.
15, meaning a few months of traf
fic headaches for the hundreds of
motorists accustomed to using the
road as their entrance to Stan
ford.
Additional landscaping and
other work is scheduled to contin
ue until Halloween.
In addition to repaving the
road, the reconstruction will in
volve building pathways, a
drainage system and a granite
curb — an idea in the original plan
of Palm Drive. Also, about 16
palm trees will be replaced and
moved, new landscaping done,

and the Campus Drive intersec
tion will be widened to a four-way
intersection.
Until Sept. 15, Palm Drive will
be closed between Arboretum
Road and the Oval, accommodat
ing construction crews and their
"intense work schedule, since
they were not able to begin work
until after World Cup," according
to Stanford Project Manager
Michael Kuntz.
The most frequently used sec
tion of the road, from El Camino
to Arboretum, will be open in only
one lane in each direction and will
be subject to delays, added Kuntz.
Palm Drive has never been
brought up to modern standards
since its original planning, having
only gone through numerous
patch jobs to fix the barrage of pot
holes, loose rubble, pits and awk
ward lumps in the gravel.
