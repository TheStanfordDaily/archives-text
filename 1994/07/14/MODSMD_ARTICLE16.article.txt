# Stanford Bonfire still in limbo
## Possibility of Lake Lag inferno not ruled out in meeting 
### 
Despite the fact that the tiger
salamanders are still living in Lake
Lagunita, there is the remote pos
sibility that the Big Game Bonfire
will return next year.
In a June 23 meeting, Axe Com
mittee faculty advisor Jon Erick
son presented Axe chair Craig
Zeyac's proposal to hold the bon
fire on its traditional date of the
Thursday night before Novem
ber's Big Game against Cal.
No evidence was presented in
the meeting by Stanford's Center
for Conservation Biology that a
bonfire would adversely affect the
salamanders living in Lake Lag.
The Axe Committee is still
waiting for a response from Dean
of Students Michael Jackson on
behalf of the Lake Committee, a
group in charge of making all deci

sion regarding usage of Lake Lag.
Zajac's revised proposal calls
for an additional contingency to
protect the threatened California
tiger salamanders by conducting a
survey of the salamander migra
tion several days before the bon
fire. If a significant number are in
the immediate area, the bonfire
would be moved or canceled.
However, the burning issue re
garding the Big Game Bonfire is
not an ecological one, but rather a
politically correct one.
Research associate Alan
Launer of the conservation center
said he felt that the bonfire proba
bly would not affect the salaman
ders. However, he added that
without an assurance of the sala
manders' safety, holding the bon
fire could be a public relations

nightmare.
If the Axe proposal is rejected,
finding an alternative location for
the bonfire would be difficult be
cause of its sheer size and poten
tial danger, according to Erickson.
The bonfire might be reduced
in size or even replaced by another
bonfire-quality event, but Erick
son hinted that the pre-Big Game
rally would not resemble last
year's Hoover Tower laser-light
show.
"That [show] was interesting,
but it sure as hell wasn't a bon
fire," commented Erickson.
The Big Game Bonfire is a
Stanford tradition started in
1898, and last year was the first
time since 1989 that it was not
held.
