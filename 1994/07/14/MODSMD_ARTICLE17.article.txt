## Stanford rapist attacks woman Attack marks only the second reported non-acquaintance rape since June 1990; no leads reported to date, say police 
### 
A woman just leaving Mass at
Stanford Memorial Church was
raped Sunday while walking alone
through a secluded, wooded area
on campus.
The 23-year-old woman, the wife
of a Stanford graduate student, was
attacked north of the Oval near
Iloth Way at 5:50 p.m., and suffered
scrapes to her knees and bruises to
her back when she tried to fight off
the assailant, said Stanford Police
Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
Police described the rapist as
approximately 30 years old, 5 feet
10 inches tail with a muscular
build. He was wearing jeans and a
plaid blue shirt, and was described
as olive-skinned with callused
hands, although the woman was
unable to see the rapist's face.
Niemeyer said the police be
lieve the assailant spotted the
woman leaving Mass and followed
her into the wooded area before

knocking her down from behind.
The attack ended within minutes,
police said, when voices were
heard nearby.
The victim was taken by police
to Valley Medical Center in San
Jose where she was treated and re
leased.
Police have begun investigat
ing the rape, but have reported no
leads to date. Niemeyer said that
since it is common for victims to
block out information immediate
ly after an attack, "We want to
give [the rape victim] a day to sort
things out before we start full
blown interviewing."
Once time subsides, Niemeyer
added, victims become angry and
begin to remember important in
formation about the events.
Sunday's rape was only the sec
ond reported non-acquaintance
rape on campus since the
"Foothill Rapist" attacked a

woman at gunpoint in June 1990,
Niemeyer said.
"Anything can happen here,"
Sgt. John McMullen said. "Stan
ford is a nice area, but crime does
happen here."
The rape was the second major
crime reported on campus in less
than a week. Last Tuesday an
armed robber held up the Coffee
House after the establishment's
close. The gunman, who pistol
whipped two employees and made
off with the contents of the Coffee
House's safe before leaving, has
not been caught.
The police do not believe that
there is any connection between
the World Cup and Sunday's rape
or the armed robbery last Tuesday.
"I know for a fact that neither
of the two recent incidents have
anything to do with the World Cup
activities," said McMullen.
