# Publication Service leaders to resign
## 
### 
In a move which could be a pre
cursor for further changes within
Stanford Publication Services, two
top administrators are resigning
from their positions effective July
29.
Susan Cretarolo, director of the
Publication Services' Graphic Cen
ter, and Alena Lee, manager of
Publication Services' Document
Express, said their resignations
stem from differences with the ad
ministration regarding the future
of their organization.
"We thought things were going
in a certain direction .. . [and] we
thought we had the support from
management," Lee said. "It turns
out we did not have that support
.... It is no longer worth the
fight-
Publication Services — which
provides design and editorial ser
vices for different offices on cam
pus, including the Development
Office and the Office of Undergrad
uate Admissions — is currently in
the middle of an assessment
process to determine how it can
provide its services in the most
cost-effective way.
The process has taken much of
the calendar year, and proposals
were made to the administration
more than three months ago by the
leadership of Publication Services.
Although she declined to give

any specifics of the proposal, Cre
tarolo said Publications Services
and the University "have not been
able to reach a resolution" regard
ing the future of Publication Ser
vices and its 35 employees.
"The University is not in a posi
tion to support or commit to Publi
cation Services," Cretarolo added.
"We are seeing a trend we don't

like."
Publication
Services is one of
the latest victims
in the Universi
ty's current
round of budget
cuts. With its
general funding
being phased out
and eventually
eliminated over
the past three

years, Publication Services has had
to find ways to be self-sufficient,
but has run into debt in the
process.
According to Terry Shepard, di
rector of communications, the
deficit that Publication Services
has accrued is "not an insignificant
amount." He declined, however, to
give the exact figure of the losses.
Publication Services is current
ly in the third year of a five-year
pricing agreement with the Uni
versity. Profits and losses are car

ried over year to year, but, at the
end of five years, Publication Ser
vices essentially has to "zero-out,"
Cretarolo said. During this time, it
is only allowed to serve University
clients.
School officials and organiza
tions are free to use whatever pub
lication service they desire, accord
ing to Shepard. If Publication Ser
vices is eliminated, those who use
its service will be forced to look to
ward alternate outside services, he
added.
Reorganization is not new for
Publication Services, according to
Cretarolo. Two years ago, six peo
ple were let go when Publication
Services was forced to close its of
fice at the School of Medicine.
The ultimate decision concern
ing the future of Publication Ser
vices will be made by Shepard in
conjunction with the Provost's
Office. According to Shepard, if
the administration can find a way
for Publication Services to "break
even" this coming year, the Uni
versity will retain its services.
"It is a complex decision," Shep
ard said. "We really don't know
when we'll make it."
Shepard declined to say how
much money the University would
save should it eliminate Publica
tion Services.
