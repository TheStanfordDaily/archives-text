Center places on the University,
and questioned what its role
would be in the Stanford of the fu
ture.
"The real question for us is
'Can we continue to afford the
Medical Center?'," he said.
The remainder of Casper's
speech primarily consisted of a
recitation of the University's con
tinuing academic reforms and
budget-cutting process. Regard
ing the first of these matters,
Casper said, "issues of undergrad
uate education will be a major
focus in the coming year."
Casper also summarized sev

als, including the "new, year
long science requirement," a
"better integration of academic
work into residences" and a

"stronger foreign-language re
quirement."
The president then shifted his
attention to Stanford's continual
budget woes.
After commenting upon the
causes of the University's current
fiscal restraints, Casper then
downplayed the possibility of any
further large-scale increases in
tuition.
"We simply cannot put a higher
proportion of the (budget) bur
dens on parents and students," he
said.
Casper also loosely outlined the
University's current budget situ

round) of cuts, the easy cuts. We
will have a very hard time with the
second and third rounds of cuts,"
he said.
Next, Casper addressed the
Medical Center's ongoing reorga
nization, as well as the Universi
ty's plans for expansion in the
Sand Hill Road vicinity.

The evening's light-hearted
tenor was reflected by Casper's
opening remarks, in which he con
gratulated the City of Palo Alto for
"only taking one year to celebrate
(its) centennial.. . because Stan
ford received a dispensation from
history to celebrate its anniver
sary for six years."
Yet despite the jovial tone of the
Council Chambers, Casper ad
dressed many pressing Stanford
issues over the course of his
speech.
Among these matters were the
upcoming announcement of the
Commission on Undergraduate
Education's findings, the Univer
sity's ongoing budget struggles,
and the Stanford Medical Center's
planned reorganization.
Concerning these subjects, the

followed Casper's address.
In the wake of his lengthy dis

effected by the health care debate
and the Medical Center's transi
