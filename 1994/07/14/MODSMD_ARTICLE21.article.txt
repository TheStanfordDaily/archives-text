# Accreditation status at risk
## Medical departments must respond to weaknesses in four areas by August 1 
### 
Following a recent accredita
tion review, the School of Medi
cine's Gynecology find Obstetrics
Department has until August 1 to
respond to weaknesses in four
areas of its residency program or
their accreditation status could
be jeopardized.
If the department fails to meet
the deadline to respond to weak
nesses in its residency program
named by the Accreditation
Council for Graduate Medical
Education, its accreditation sta
tus could be "at risk," Associate
Dean of Medical Student and
Graduate Affairs Dr. James
McGuire said.
The independent organiza
tion that accredits medical
schools informed the depart
ment that improvements need to
be made for the program, which
is now "provisionally accredit
ed," to become "fully accredit
ed," he added.
"08-GYN [Gynecology and
Obstetrics] is a very important,
high-quality department at Stan
ford and we are working very
hard to correct any deficiencies,"
McGuire said.
He said that the "quality" of
the program is not the problem
but the "volume" of patient
cases that the residents see
within certain areas of genetics
testing, urology, surgery and
potential female reproductive
cancer is too low for the stan
dards set by the accreditation
council.
The program, which was ac
credited before 1988, had to start
the accreditation process over
again when it started a new inde
pendent program after separat
ing from the Valley Medical Cen

ter in San Jose.
Dr. Paul O'Connor, executive
secretary for the 08-GYN resi
dency-review committee for the
organization, explained that "a
new program is placed on provi
sional status until it gains full ac
creditation. The program is re
viewed every two to three years
and if it gets a bad review, then
accreditation may be with
drawn."
If a program is unaccredited,
its residents would have difficul
ty becoming board-certified as
physicians, O'Connor added.
In response to the criticism,
the department will be preparing
a "rebuttal" over the next few
weeks, during which they intend
to examine how the numbers in
these areas can be met.
This response must be pre
sented by August 1 and then in
late October the organization will
make their decision, McGuire
said.
"We're committed to do what
ever necessary to meet the tar
gets by finding cases within the
department that haven't been
recorded, or by making new affil
iate agreements with other med
ical institutions to ensure case
volumes are met," he said, ex
plaining that some cases seen off
site are not recorded.
McGuire added that the de
partment will also be hiring a
consultant specialized in look
ing at programs going through
accreditation, giving faculty
members the task of ensuring
case assignments are met and
increasing interaction with
other departments such as urol
ogy-
