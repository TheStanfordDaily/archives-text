# Echoing Green: Putting money in the hands of social innovators
## 
### 
Three years ago, community
service was a popular buzz
word on campus. Stanford
president Donald Kennedy was its
most visible champion, and tutor
ing disadvantaged kids was its
most popular manifestation fol
lowed by work in local soup
kitchens.
Two years later, the president
of the United States initiated a
National Service Movement, com
plete with boot camp for high
school-aged service aficionados,
and minimum wage-earning in
centives. Longtime service out
fits, like Teach for America, and
newly emerging ones, like
Boston's City Year, were thrust
into the limelight as President
Clinton pleaded with young
Americans to "get involved" and
"make a change."
Today, a small but fast growing
contingent speaks of systemic
crises and effective change while
designing innovative projects that
literally puts money where their
mouths are.
At the heart of this burgeoning

phenomenon is a venture capital
service organization called Echo
ing Green. Echoing Green, whose
mandate is to "encourage young
people to confront the problems of
our society in creative ways,"
gives $15,000 fellowships to grad
uating seniors who demonstrate a
commitment to public service and
a clearly articulated project to ef
fect change.
Three years ago, Echoing
Green made its first appearance
on campus. It gave out two fel
lowships that year, and in so
doing, left a legacy of serious com
mitment to service coupled with
sophisticated vision making. The
result was explosive. The next
year, there were two more Stan
ford recipients, and the year after
that, four.
This year, after fierce competi
tion from across the country,
three Stanford students received
fellowships. They went through
an application process that first
involved an interview by commit
tee at the Stanford level. Then,
because the quality of the pool

was so great, 40 applicants from
around the nation were flown to
Boston for a 20 minute interview
by members of the Echoing Green
board. Only 20 could be selected.
Several Stanford fellows are
quick to point out problems with
the selection process. Echoing
Green restricts its pool of fellows
to college students from "Ivy
League type institutions," .accord
ing to 1992 fellow, Natalie Seers.
"They've expanded a little bit, but
that's how they started out."
Even though all of the fellows
in 1993 came from schools like
Stanford, Yale, Princeton and
Brown, an interesting develop
ment occurred in 1994. Natalie
Seers and Priya Haji, Echoing
Green sponsored founders of the
"Free at Last" program in East
Palo Alto, were pleasantly sur
prised when Echoing Green
awarded David Lewis, community
representative and co-founder of
the program, a $15,000 fellow
ship.
"They were impressed with
him and so they gave it to him,"
says Seers. It will bring in much
needed money to their growing
project.
Even though "people are sur
prised and excited" about the
honor of Lewis being the first
non-college graduate to receive
such a fellowship, Lewis does not
waste time patting himself, or
Echoing Green on the back. "It
ain't shit," he says with a deadpan
look. In response to the surprise
in reaction to his getting the
award, he responds "Why
shouldn't I?"
Lewis, an EPA resident and, in
his words, "a California Depart
ment of Corrections graduate"
feels the need to remind his co
workers, many who may not be as
familiar with the sight of drug ad
dicts as he is, of what the organi
zation is about. Free at Last was
conceived in order to "offer ser
vices [to substance abusers in
EPA] that were not being offered
or were not being offered in the
right way," Lewis said.
To this end, the organization
hopes to offer a continuum of ser
vices ranging from individual and
group counseling, a residential
treatment program, transitional
housing, an out-patient Neigh
borhood Recovery Center, and a
detoxification program.
Lewis, Seers and Haji form the
organization's diverse core. "We
are experts here," says Lewis.
"We do it everyday."
Institute N.H.I.
Kwame Anku and Jason Am
broise were funded to create an
organization called Institute
N.H.I. The organization was in
spired by a 1992 Malcom X com
memoration speech in which the
keynote speaker challenged black
students to pick up where Malcom
left off with the Organization for
African Unity, and the acronym
N.H.I, itself. N.H.1., or No Hu
mans Involved, was used by Los
Angeles law enforcement officials
to designate black or Hispanic
males involved in a crime (a fact
that came to light during the trial
of the four officers who beat Rod
ney King).
Anku and Ambroise, beginning
with the question "what makes
classifications such as N.H.I. pos
sible," combined with the burning
need for the type of organization

Malcom X started with 0.A.U.,
joined together with six other
Stanford students to create Insti
tute N.H.I. Its primary objective
is to disseminate information and
analyses centering on "our con
temporary social crisis and the
historic and systemic origins of
this crisis," Anku said.
"We want to focus relentlessly
on this fact. That our problems
may or may not be caused by our
system of higher education, they
are caused by it," Anku added.
While very clear in his concep
tion of the problem, Anku says,
that Institute N.H.I, is still very
much in its formative stage. "We
just recently came together to
talk about how we're going to do
this thing."
So far, the project is impres
sive. This past winter, the organi
zation co-sponsored a conference
called "The Two Reservations:
The Crisis of the Negro Intellec
tual and the Body of Knowledge"
which brought together acade
mics from across the country and
even from the Caribbean. Am
broise and Anku plan to produce
interactive, multi-media, CD
ROM presentations, work on high
school textbooks, publish a jour
nal called Forum N.H.I, and cre
ate a national student network
via Internet.
ETS Oakland
Emilee Whitehurst's relationship
to social action began with a bang.
While a freshman, she participat
ed in a Summer of Social Action
sponsored by an emerging stu
dent organization called Empty
the Shelters (ETS). ETS, a na
tional student organization based
in Philadelphia, engaged in the
housing takeover movement in
the state and sought to work in
partnership with homeless people
to eradicate homelessness. White
hurst didn't need any more con
vincing. She was hooked.
Over the years, Whitehurst
has been a consistent participant
in ETS, co-founding a San Fran
cisco site with Stanford grad
Steve Williams. Whitehurst
began conceptualizing an Empty
the Shelters site in Oakland —
the project she later won an
Echoing Green fellowship for —
over a year ago when she, and
several members of ETS began to
notice a disturbing "regional pat
tern."
"Most repressive measures
like lowering GA (General Assis
tance) and fingerprinting [the re
cipients] get instituted in Oak
land first. Primarily because it is
an African-American community
and because it's poor." Accord
ing to Whitehurst, the impact of
these measures did not stop
there. "Surrounding communi
ties like Berkeley and San Fran
cisco then would say Oakland did
this, Oakland lowered their GA,
and if we don't, all of [the poor
people from Oakland] will come
over here. So then it gets passed
in Berkeley and San Francisco."
The next catalyst for White
hurst's project was the lack of
communication between organiz
ing groups across the Bay. She no
ticed that "the groups were doing
great things but they don't talk to
each other." Since ETS has place
ments for its participants at vari
ous organizations in San Francis
co, Whitehurst believed that a
similar set up in Oakland could

achieve the desired results, partic
ularly because ETS prioritizes
communication between sites.
Set with the ETS philosophy
that "you can only get what
you're organized to take," and
its impressive infrastructure,
Whitehurst teamed up with
Stanford grad Eileen Shin to
begin making contacts with
grassroots organizing groups in
Oakland. "We got in touch with
groups like WEAP (the Women's
Economic Agenda Project) and
soon realized that poverty issues
were just different in communi
ties like Oakland.
"A lot of homeless people are
homeless because they can't
make the rent or because of un
just evictions," she said. Again,
Whitehurst had to reassess some
of her plans since homelessness
in Oakland is not as visible as in
places like San Francisco.
The reformulating, while it
has been hard work for White
hurst, has increased her orga
nizing skills manifold. White
hurst is leading an ETS Summer
of Social Action, an activity that
changed her life as a freshman.
In Oakland, there are nine par
ticipants. Six are from Stanford.

On top of that, there are five in
terns from the Oakland area.
The group is busy at work on
such pressing issues as police ac
countability, working with Cop-
Watch in Berkeley, and as well
as compiling a history of home
lessness organizing in Oakland.
Each of the fellows face an
enormous task. Because the
scope of their mission is so big,
each one of them are in a situa
tion in which they might never
see their goals fully realized. But
as is the case with all visionaries,
they are believers. They must
and do have hope that their work
is not being done in vain.
For David Lewis of Free at
Last, this point became clear to
him on the day he interviewed
with Echoing Green. "On the
same day that I gave my presen
tation to these people at Echo
ing Green," he says "someone
was watching the television
newscast of Nelson Mandela
being inaugurated as the first
black president of South Africa.
Those are signs of the times.
Those are signs that say that,
one day, we will actually be free
at last."
