Echoing Green. Never has a
service foundation been so
aptly named. Taken from a
poem by William Blake, this phrase
is more accurate in its contempo
rary money-oriented connotation
than in the intended poetic allusion.
Echoing Green is the private
foundation component to General
Atlantic, a large venture capital
company. Founded by businessman
Ed Cohen, a socially-minded mem
ber of the organization, Echoing
Green strives to engage young peo
ple in a lifetime commitment to
public service, wherever they may
be located. At the same time, it en
courages them to effect positive
change in society at large.
While this vision suggests a lib
eral or leftist philosophy, in a seem
ingly incongruous synthesis, Echo
ing Green's practice of grant-mak
ing is heavily indebted to the ven
ture capitalist model. Much like its
parent company, Echoing Green in
vests primarily in individuals, not
organizations, with well-thought
out visions for change.
"They fund stars with great
ideas," said Emilee Whitehurst, a
1994 Stanford graduate and fellow
ship recipient.
Instead of fundingjoint software
ventures and gas/oil pipelines like
its parent company, Echoing Green
funds people to tackle social ills
such as hunger, homelessness, the
scourge of drugs, and substance
abuse in low-income communities.
Unlike many other foundations
in the Bay Area, Echoing Green's
approach to grant-giving focuses on
a relationship between the founda
tion and the recipient that evolves
over time. It does not simply allo
cate money and leave recipients to
fend for themselves until an end
quarter report is due, knowing full
well that it will get the money back
in tax write-ofT*. Rather, like its en
trepreneurial parent, Echoing
Green is quite conscious that it is
making an investment.
According to David Lewis of
"Free at Last," this investment is
the first step toward change. While
Echoing Green, and General At

lantic, has no obligation to give
money to initiatives like Lewis'
drug and alcohol recovery program
in East Palo Alto, for Lewis and
others, their investment means a
commitment to changing "the
norm" or "the good old boys' net
work."
"They see a gem of an idea, and
then work with you to ensure that it
is a success," Whitehurst said.
Echoing Green's creative hybrid
of the fellowship and foundation ap
proaches to grant-giving neverthe
less has its drawbacks. According to
Whitehurst, their process is "very
haphazard" and will continue to be
until they can fully reconcile their
two main approaches.

On a larger scale, Echoing
Green has its hands in virtually
every major public service outlet in
the country. It funds City Year, the
Boston urban service core that has
provided the defini model for Pres
ident Clinton's National Service
initiatives. Echoing Green also
funds such organizations as Public
Allies, Teach for America, and the
National Service magazine "Who
Cares."
By playing a major role in these
organizations, Echoing Green can
now be considered one of the major
authors of that work in progress
which President Clinton has
termed "The National Service
Movement."
