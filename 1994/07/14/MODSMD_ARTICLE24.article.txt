## Cohen set to leave after years of service 
### Ann Suwanjindar Editorial staff 
After teaching for 10 years in
the Communications Department,
Associate Professor Jeremy Cohen
is leaving Stanford this week. He
will be heading for Penn State,
where he will serve as both the as
sociate dean of undergraduate
studies in the University's School
of Communication and as a full
professor.
With his departure, Cohen
leaves behind at Stanford a legacy
of commitment to undergraduate
education, a dedication to strength
ening student-faculty relations and
fostering community service.
Based on Cohen's past accom
plishments and love for undergrad
uate education, the Penn State po
sition appears to be his perfect
match. Stepping into the associate
dean's position, Cohen's duties will
include playing a major role in cur
riculum development, teaching
evaluation, supervising and men
toring younger faculty on research
and on teaching.
The expanded responsibility en
ables Cohen to emphasize under
graduate teaching — "my passion,
my uumph." Cohen said Penn
State will provide "a wealth of sup
port for professional growth and
opportunity."
Overseeing 1,200 students and
50 faculty members, Cohen will be
able to cultivate a community of
learning focused on undergradu
ates. "Penn State will provide the
resources to push on areas that I
care so much about," said Cohen.
Labeled "outstanding in his de
votion to undergraduate educa
tion," by his colleges and students
alike, Cohen's precense will defi
nitely be missed on campus next
fall.
James Risser, director of the
John Knight Fellowship Program
said, "I'm sorry to see him leaving.
I've enjoyed him as a colleague, but
I think the students will miss him
as well. He clearly identified with

them both as a teacher and men
tor."
Professor of International Com
munication Steven Chaffee said of
Cohen, "It's tough to see a col
league of that caliber go. He'll be
missed, particularly by under
grade, but this position is a move up
for him ... in the past he's had of
fers from other schools but this one
seems made for him."
Cohen taught courses involving
mass communication and society,
communication and law, and a cur
riculum in development and peda
gogy at Stanford. He also taught a
seminar in American Studies and
Urban Studies linking academics
and community service.
"Jeremy's had a central role in
our undergraduate program," said
Communication Department
Chair Donald Roberts.
Cohen's departure from Stan

ford leaves a hole in the depart
ment, especially in the field of
media law.
Cohen is also well known for his
research on libel and on pedagogy.
His works have appeared in numer
ous publications, including Public
Opinion Quarterly, Journalism
Educator, American Journalism
and the Washington Law Review.
Currently, his research involves
relations among mass communica
tion, democracy and law and how
reputations to individuals are af
fected by defamatory news cover
age.
Cohen emphasized that he felt
the need for "dedication to teaching
as well as dedication to research."
Associate Professor Clifford
Nass commented, "In addition to
his devotion to education, Jeremy
is a notable scholar. His research is
known for applying social science to

understanding communication
and law."
Besides being dedicated to his
research, Cohen also feels very
strongly about improving faculty
interactions with students, includ
ing evenly balancing research and
teaching time.
Cohen suggested that "a piece of
the problem is recognizing that not
only is teaching and the scholar
ship of teaching compatible with
research, but to do one and not the
other is incompatible with the mis
sion of the University.
"We should apply the same stan
dards to our teaching as we do to
our research," he said.
He added that "Our research is
second to none. Our teaching is
good, but it falls short often."
Cohen said he feels very strong
ly that "as teachers we have the
moral and ethical responsibility to

50 percent of our students — our
undergrads — to educate them
scholastically as well as train them
to take part in the democracy. Edu
cation is the basis of freedom of ex
pression. That's Madisonian
Democracy. That's what it's all
about."
Cohen's popularity with stu
dents is evident not only in his com
mitment to a complete undergrad
uate education, but also in his
views on the new grading policy.
According to Cohen, "faculty cyni
cism is apparent in the desperate
need to reinstate the F."
"Stanford students have been
receiving A's for six years before
they came here. Should we faculty
think that once they get here, they
will quit working? If an A indicates
superior work and superior work
indicates mastery of the subject,
then one-third of my students are A
students," said Cohen.
As chair of Stanford Residential
Education and Advising, Cohen
was able to gain that "experiencial
education" that he advocates. Liv
ing in Lantana as resident fellow,
Cohen said he was able to see that
dorms are actually places of intel
lectual atmosphere.
He said he regrets that faculty
members outside of Res Ed do not
spend more time in the dorms but
instead believe they are "hotbeds
for alcohol, drugs and deviant sexu
al acts where students run around
in an 'Animal House' fashion."
Besides his strong belief in Res
Ed, Cohen is an advocate of what he
calls "service education."
"Although Stanford students
receive straight A's in the class
room, what they also need is experi
encial education. Community ser
vice provides that," said Cohen.
Cohen's belief is that service ed
ucation will provide students the
experience they need to learn how
to solve problems effectively.
Cohen said, "the goal of service ed
ucation is to prepare students to
become full citizens in our democ
racy."
