## Stanford snares second in Directors Cup 
### Heather Hardwick Staff writer 
It's official: the Stanford athlet
ics program is one of the best in the
nation, at least as determined by
the results of the Sears Directors
Cup. In the inaugural year of the
Sears competition, Stanford
placed second Just behind the Uni
versity of North Carolina.
The Directors Cup was devel
oped with the intention of honor
ing the Division I school with the
best overall athletic performance.
It is sponsored by Sears and the
National Association of Directors
of Collegiate Athletics and is
unique because it does not focus on
a specific team or individual, but
encompasses a wide array of
sports.
Ten men's and ten women's
sports are monitored throughout
their respective seasons and are
awarded points based on their final
national standings, as determined
by NCAA championship tourna
ments and polls.
The 10 core sports for men in
clude baseball, basketball, cross
country, football, golf, soccer,
swimming, tennis, track and field
and wrestling. The women's
sports are the same, except softball
replaces baseball, field hockey re
places football and volleyball re
places wrestling.
National Champions are
awarded 64 points with 63 points

going to the second-place finisher
and so on. In addition to the official
20 sports included in the competi
tion, each school may use two sup
plementary sports, one men's and
one women's, with top national
finishes in order to boost their
point totals.
Stanford amassed a total of
786.5 points to finish second for
the 1993-94 season behind the
Tarheels, who finished with the
top score of 806.5. The Cardinal
finished well above rival Califor
nia, which placed 17th with a score
of 534.5. Stanford was tops among
Pacific-10 Conference schools,
which made up an astounding five
of the top 10 finishers in the Direc
tors Cup. Stanford was carried by
top national finishes in men's and
women's swimming, men's golf,
and water polo, a wild card sport.
Men's and women's tennis also
made significant contributions
with second place finishes.
Although this is the first year of
this award, it is already a very pres
tigious and coveted honor. As ex
plained by the Senior Sports Infor
mation Director Gary Migdol,
"This is the first time such an
award is given by people who are
actually involved in the athletic
programs — namely, the directors.
It honors the top athletic pro
grams in the country, not just
those schools that perform well in
the big sports such as basketball or
football."
