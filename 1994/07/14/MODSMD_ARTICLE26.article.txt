# The 						Cup runneth over
## Contests provided unexpected thrills

It's over.
The World Cup is over. Yes, I
know, there is still one monu
mental game remaining for the
rest of the world to savor, but for
many here in the Bay Area the
World Cup ended last Sunday.
The once-in-a-lifetime oppor
tunity has passed and Stanford
Stadium has done its job as host
to six tournament games. And
the job was done well, as the
more than half-million people
who attended games here know.
The World Cup came and
went smoothly, much to my sur
prise. The predictions of massive
traffic jams and the overload of
visitors on and around campus
never materialized. Instead, the
Stanford community simply en
joyed the role of host, and experi
enced an education in a sport
beloved by people all over the
globe.
And what a way to discover
the world's passion. Admittedly,
I was skeptical of soccer itself —
what kind of sport makes you
run around for an hour and a half
to earn a 0-0 tie? But as a sports
lover, I dutifully followed the
tournament and (gasp) got im
mersed in World Cup fever.
Although an admitted soccer
bandwagoner, I knew excite
ment when I saw it. And the
games at Stanford Stadium were
exceptional in that respect.
Consider the following. Stan
ford was fortunate enough to
play host to the dynamic Brazil
ian squad, led by their offensive
superstars Romario and Bebeto,
for three matches. In addition,
seemingly half of the South
American country's populace
made the trip to the Bay Area,
making the stadium a sea of yel
low and green. The people beat
ing drums, dancing and cheerful

ly celebrating in the streets were
a welcome change from the
usual, ultra-yuppie Palo Alto so
cial scene.
Of course, the climax of the
Bay Area games came in the sec
ond round, as a dream match-up
came to be reality. On America's
most patriotic day, July 4th, the
gutsy United States team took
on the heavily favored Brazilians
in Stanford Stadium. For one af
ternoon, the entire country was
focused on this arena, as we
hoped against the odds that Tony
Meola, Alexi Lalas, Cobi Jones
and company would break
through to the big time.
Although Brazil dominated
the game, the 1-0 loss was a
tremendous boost for American
soccer.
My conclusions were rein
forced a few days later as all four
of the quarterfinal match-ups
went down to the wire, with late
game heroics included in each
story-line. To the end, the fans
here at Stanford were treated to
the best. In the battle for the final
spot in the World Cup semifinals,
Sweden defeated Romania under
the most dramatic of circum
stances.
Romania tied the match late
in regulation. Sweden tied it up
late in overtime. After five penal
ty kicks, the two teams were still
deadlocked when Swedish goal
keeper Thomas Ravelli made a
diving save to clinch the victory
for his country.
Can such heroics be compared
by Americans to Joe Carter hit
ting a home run to win the World
Series for the Toronto Blue Jays?
Or match the excitement of
Magic Johnson feeding fellow
Dream-Teamer Michael Jordan
for a heart-stopping slam dunk?
Probably not. Nor will soccer
ever be America's sport. But for a
month at Stanford Stadium, it
was an unexpected thrill.
