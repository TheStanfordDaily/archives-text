# Knight shines in Festival
## Cardinal guard's game to profit from St. Louis experience 
### Anne Craig 
Stanford basketball player
Brevin Knight won more than just
a bronze medal at the U.S. Olympic
Festival — he also scored some
philosophical insights as well.
The festival brought together
more than 2,000 of the nation's
best athletes to compete in St.
Louis during the week of June 28-
July 6. For Knight, it was a whole
new ballgame.
"At the festival, there was a
different style of play than at
Stanford," Knight said. "Stan
ford has a structured offense and
team togetherness. At the Festi
val, individual talents come out.
Playing [regularly] with a team is
very different; you know the
team, you know everyone's
strengths and weaknesses, and
you play together."
Knight found playing with the
best of the best is not always easy.
"Everyone wants to play like a star.
To play at that level and not be self
ish requires a transformation."
Knight was one of the 48 top
performing college basketball
freshmen and sophomores in the
country chosen by the Olympic
Committee. They were divided into
four teams: East, West, North and
South. Knight was placed on the
West squad, and, starting at point
guard, led the team to a bronze
medal.
"We [the team] worked well in
the scrimmages," Knight said.
"But in the medal round we didn't
play together well; we lost the first
three games. But we won the
bronze because we played like we
did in the scrimmages: together.
People began to look for each other,
instead of personal stats."
This fall, Knight hopes to put
the knowledge he gained in St.
Louis to work. "I realized what I
need to do better. What I can do at
Stanford — going to the basket — I
couldn't do at the Festival because
everyone constantly blocked my
shots. I learned that I have to pull
up and shoot."
Needless to say, Knight was not
dimmed by the stars. He shined
brightly, often leading his team in

assists and steals, and had fun at
the same time. "It was great," he
exclaimed. "I got to play with the
best players in the country. I was
able to compare my skills to those of
the best players in my age bracket.

Plus I made a lot of new friends."
Three players for Stanford's
women's basketball team, Kate
Paye, Kate Starbird and Olympia
Scott, were also selected to play at
the festival.
