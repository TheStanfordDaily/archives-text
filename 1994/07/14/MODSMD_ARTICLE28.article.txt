## Double Play Columbia and Walt Disney ste up to the plate for a summer of Hollywood baseball 
### Andrew Kgsoresow 
With newspapers skimping on
baseball coverage to make
room for World Cup reports,
at least Hollywood has not scrimped on
baseball coverage with "Angels in the
Outfield" and "Little Big League." While,
in past years, Hollywood managers have
tried a variety of winning strategies in
cluding history ("A League of their
Own"), the supernatural ("Field of
Dreams"), and the over-the-hill hunk
does good ("Mr. Baseball"), this year Dis
ney and Columbia are putting their
money on the youth movement.
The two teams, that these studios field,
have a number of parallels. In Disney's
"Angels in the Outfield," the California
Angels are mired in the cellar of the
American League West. The team is
dispirited, players want to be traded, and
the manager is beginning to froth at the
mouth.
At this point, a boy, a dedicated fan, in
fluences the manager and inspires the
team to make a spectacular move for first
place so that by the end of the season, the
team is a legitimate contender. In Colum
bia's "Little Big League," the basic plot is
much the same, only with the Minnesota
Twins of the AL Central.
However, the details are radically dif
ferent. In "Angels in the Outfield," Dis
ney gives us a remake of the 1951 movie of
the same title. In the current version,
Roger (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) has been
abandoned by his father and is living in a
shelter. He and J.P. (Milton Davis, Jr.),
another boy living in the shelter, have a
passion for baseball and are fans of the
Angels. Unfortunately the team currently
stinks.
Roger's bedtime prayers are answered
and a group of angels, headed by A 1
(Christopher Lloyd) come to the rescue.
George Knox, the manager (Danny
Glover) is at his wits end so when Roger
comes and tells him about the angels, he
eventually decides it's worth following
their instructions, as interpreted by
Roger. It pays off as the angels push play
ers to perform superhuman feats. Even
Mel Clark (Tony Danza) comes back from
a long-term injury to be the star pitcher
the Angels need.

William Dear ("Harry and the Hender
sons") directs a competent summer movie
aimed at pre-teens. The humor is mostly
slapstick, the special effects barely man
age a hit, and were there any cameos, I
must have been in line for hot dogs and a
beer at the time.

The script by Holly Goldberg Sloan
makes everyone sound awkward, as if
they were reading the script for the very
first time. The resulting film commits
balks with the subplots of Roger dealing
with his family and Clark's fatal condi
tion, melodramatizing the former and
slighting the latter.
Glover's performance was the high
point of "Angels in the Outfield," along
with action sequences that help keep the
movie entertaining. Baseball diehards co
erced into taking a younger family mem-

ber to see the film can keep themselves
entertained by seeing how many similari
ties the fictitious team shares with the
San Francisco Giants teams of the late
80s; or how many ex-ball players they can
spot in supporting roles.
Over in the Central Division of Colum

bia's "Little Big League," the Twins are
in a slump and nothing is going right.
Billy (Luke Edwards) is the grandson of
Thomas Heywood (Jason Robards), the
owner of the Twins. When his grandfa
ther dies, Billy inherits the team. After a
run-in with the manager (Dennis Farina),
Billy fires him and appoints himself the
manager. Did I mention that he's a base
ball whiz?
With the help of his grandfather's loyal
staff (John Ashton and Kevin Dunn), he
begins to run the team under the premise

that if the players have fun playing,
everything else will fall into place. It
works until the pressure gets to Billy and
he starts taking the game too seriously.
He flakes on his friends, curses out the
umpire, yells at his players, and even
fights with his mom about her boyfriend,
the star first baseman. It looks like disas
ter is about to strike as the movie heads
towards a climactic one-game playoff be
tween the Twins and the Mariners.
The direction by Andrew Scheinman,
in his directorial debut, gets us through
the opening two innings safely, dealing
quickly and tactfully with the death of a
grandfather. He then settles down to
skillfully pitch the rest of the movie with
the action fast and furious on the field
with glimpses at Billy's interactions
with his friends and family between in
nings.
The script (Gregory Pincus and Adam
Scheinman) was a baseball fan's delight:
well paced and lightly spiced with trivia.
There was a subplot to keep every fan
happy: the romance of the star first-base
man Lou Collins (Timothy Busfield) dat
ing the manager's mother (Ashley Crow),
the drama of the decline and release of a
formerly great ballplayer (Duane Davis),
the goofball antics of players on the road,
and the evolving owner/manager rela
tions to his staff.
Baseball stars and newscasters (Ken
Griffey Jr. and Chris Berman just to
name a pair) appear in one scene after an
other. The movie has a solid feel as if it
was filmed during the season with real
Msyor League players at real stadiums as
opposed to on a set.
So do the Angels and the Twins win the
pennants of their respective divisions? It
could happen, both teams are currently in
next-to-last place in their respective divi
sion. But until the end of the season,
checking out either the dream or the
prayer wouldn't be a waste of a sunny af
ternoon when you can't get out to the
ballpark.
While "Angels in the Outfield" is a see
ing-eye single, "Little Big League" is a
solid three-run blast over the left-field
bleachers. It's a satisfying bread-and-but
ter film for baseball fans of all ages.

the manager is beginning to froth at the
mouth.
At this point, a boy, a dedicated fan, in
fluences the manager and inspires the
team to make a spectacular move for first
place so that by the end of the season, the
team is a legitimate contender. In Colum
bia's "Little Big League," the basic plot is
much the same, only with the Minnesota
Twins of the AL Central.
However, the details are radically dif
ferent. In "Angels in the Outfield," Dis
ney gives us a remake of the 1951 movie of
the same title. In the current version,
Roger (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) has been
abandoned by his father and is living in a
shelter. He and J.P. (Milton Davis, Jr.),
another boy living in the shelter, have a
passion for baseball and are fans of the
Angels. Unfortunately the team currently
stinks.
Roger's bedtime prayers are answered
and a group of angels, headed by A 1
(Christopher Lloyd) come to the rescue.
George Knox, the manager (Danny
Glover) is at his wits end so when Roger
comes and tells him about the angels, he
eventually decides it's worth following
their instructions, as interpreted by
Roger. It pays off as the angels push play
ers to perform superhuman feats. Even
Mel Clark (Tony Danza) comes back from
a long-term injury to be the star pitcher
the Angels need.

William Dear ("Harry and the Hender
sons") directs a competent summer movie
aimed at pre-teens. The humor is mostly
slapstick, the special effects barely man
age a hit, and were there any cameos, I
must have been in line for hot dogs and a
beer at the time.

The script by Holly Goldberg Sloan
makes everyone sound awkward, as if
they were reading the script for the very
first time. The resulting film commits
balks with the subplots of Roger dealing
with his family and Clark's fatal condi
tion, melodramatizing the former and
slighting the latter.
Glover's performance was the high
point of "Angels in the Outfield," along
with action sequences that help keep the
movie entertaining. Baseball diehards co
erced into taking a younger family mem-

ber to see the film can keep themselves
entertained by seeing how many similari
ties the fictitious team shares with the
San Francisco Giants teams of the late
80s; or how many ex-ball players they can
spot in supporting roles.
Over in the Central Division of Colum

bia's "Little Big League," the Twins are
in a slump and nothing is going right.
Billy (Luke Edwards) is the grandson of
Thomas Heywood (Jason Robards), the
owner of the Twins. When his grandfa
ther dies, Billy inherits the team. After a
run-in with the manager (Dennis Farina),
Billy fires him and appoints himself the
manager. Did I mention that he's a base
ball whiz?
With the help of his grandfather's loyal
staff (John Ashton and Kevin Dunn), he
begins to run the team under the premise

that if the players have fun playing,
everything else will fall into place. It
works until the pressure gets to Billy and
he starts taking the game too seriously.
He flakes on his friends, curses out the
umpire, yells at his players, and even
fights with his mom about her boyfriend,
the star first baseman. It looks like disas
ter is about to strike as the movie heads
towards a climactic one-game playoff be
tween the Twins and the Mariners.
The direction by Andrew Scheinman,
in his directorial debut, gets us through
the opening two innings safely, dealing
quickly and tactfully with the death of a
grandfather. He then settles down to
skillfully pitch the rest of the movie with
the action fast and furious on the field
with glimpses at Billy's interactions
with his friends and family between in
nings.
The script (Gregory Pincus and Adam
Scheinman) was a baseball fan's delight:
well paced and lightly spiced with trivia.
There was a subplot to keep every fan
happy: the romance of the star first-base
man Lou Collins (Timothy Busfield) dat
ing the manager's mother (Ashley Crow),
the drama of the decline and release of a
formerly great ballplayer (Duane Davis),
the goofball antics of players on the road,
and the evolving owner/manager rela
tions to his staff.
Baseball stars and newscasters (Ken
Griffey Jr. and Chris Berman just to
name a pair) appear in one scene after an
other. The movie has a solid feel as if it
was filmed during the season with real
Msyor League players at real stadiums as
opposed to on a set.
So do the Angels and the Twins win the
pennants of their respective divisions? It
could happen, both teams are currently in
next-to-last place in their respective divi
sion. But until the end of the season,
checking out either the dream or the
prayer wouldn't be a waste of a sunny af
ternoon when you can't get out to the
ballpark.
While "Angels in the Outfield" is a see
ing-eye single, "Little Big League" is a
solid three-run blast over the left-field
bleachers. It's a satisfying bread-and-but
ter film for baseball fans of all ages.

for a team in last place in Walt Disney Pictures' "Angeles in the Outfield."
With newspapers skimping on
baseball coverage to make
room for World Cup reports,
at least Hollywood has not scrimped on
baseball coverage with "Angels in the
Outfield" and "Little Big League." While,
in past years, Hollywood managers have
tried a variety of winning strategies in
cluding history ("A League of their
Own"), the supernatural ("Field of
Dreams"), and the over-the-hill hunk
does good ("Mr. Baseball"), this year Dis
ney and Columbia are putting their
money on the youth movement.
The two teams, that these studios field,
have a number of parallels. In Disney's
"Angels in the Outfield," the California
Angels are mired in the cellar of the
American League West. The team is
dispirited, players want to be traded, and
the manager is beginning to froth at the
mouth.
At this point, a boy, a dedicated fan, in
fluences the manager and inspires the
team to make a spectacular move for first
place so that by the end of the season, the
team is a legitimate contender. In Colum
