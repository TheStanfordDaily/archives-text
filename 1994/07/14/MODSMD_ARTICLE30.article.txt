# Getting down with edde Harris
## 
### victor Haseman 
Call me crazy but there's something
about good jazz on a summer evening
that just can't be beat.
Maybe that's why summer after
summer, so many outdoor venues open
their doors to many of the world's
hottest players and the fans come to
hear them play.
The Stanford campus, never one to
be behind the Jones has contributed to
the "summer jazziness" on a regular
basis for sometime now.
The on-campus venue, is part of the
Stanford Jazz Workshopwhich attracts
talented young players as well as the gi
ants they admire to campus for several
weeks of intense collaboration and edu
cation.
But almost as big a deal as the actual
conference, however, is the Workshop's
concert series which brings to campus a
tidy mixture of local and nationally
known talent, like jazz/funk legend
Eddie Harris, who'll be performing on
July 15 at the Campbell Recital Hall in
Braun Music Center.
Harris, who hails from Chicago, is
widely known as one of recent jazz his
tory's boldest and brightest stars, al
though he's never commanded the no
teriety afforded many of his contempo
raries (your John Coltranes', Ornette
Colemans' and Sonny Rollins'.
But rather than make a fuss, Harris
has continued to perfect and experi
ment on the saxophone, his native in
strument as well but also a pianist, vo
calist, trumpet player and instrumen

tal inventor (he holds the patent for
reed trumpet).
And as the recently released retro
spective "Artist's Choice" makes clear,
the most important thing to Harris is

the development of his own musical ex
pression.
"Artists Choice," released by Vee Jay
through Rhino Records' Atlantic Jazz
Gallery series, chronicles his develop

ment from a straight-ahead jazzman
("Exodus") to a purveyor of breathtak
ing funk and jazz fusion ("1974
Blues").
For the uninitiated the variation in
styles on the two-disk set are such that
one would suspect that a number of
bands, not one man over a span of
about 20 years, had all been influenced
by one anothe,while advancing along a
logical melodic progression to a
netherland that hasn't yet been discov
ered.
This comes as no suprise, though, for
those familiar with his work and the
kinds of musicians he's worked with â€”
everyone from Bud Powell, to Charlie
Parker and Roy Eldridge, to Jeff Beck,
Less McCann and Steve Winwood.
Tune after tune on "Artist" seems to
cry "I'm restless! Where, we're at is
cool, but we could be further, more
complex musically, more sophisticat
ed."
But even if you've never partaken of
the Harris experience, don't be intimi
dated. If his "Artist" is any indication,
any of his work, should probably prove
not only accessible but down right
swingin'.

Eddie Harris will perform at the
Campbell Recital Hall in Braun Music
Center on Friday, July 15 at 8 p.m.
Tickets are $12 dollars at the door, $10
dollars in advance. For additional in
formation please call the Stanford Jazz
Workshop at 386-8535.
