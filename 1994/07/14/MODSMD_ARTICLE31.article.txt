True Lies

Like many of director James Cameron's
other films, "True Lies" is an action film of
mega-proportions.
From start to finish — with every camera
angle, special effect and spray of bullets —
the director reminds us of his duty to elevate
audiences high above the cheap and thrilling
stomping grounds of Jean Claude Van
Damme and Keanu Reeves to a T.N.T-laced
nirvanna of sorts, where only Sigourney
Weaver, Linda Hamilton, Arnold
Schwarzenegger and Ed Harris dare tread.
And while we've had more fun riding the
adrenaline-filled skies of "Cameron Air"
then we care to recall, we can't help but won
der sometimes about a director who's whole
some sensibility has proven to be sometimes
a welcomed shot in the arm ("The Termina
tor" and "Aliens") and other times an an
noying pebble in the but ("The Abyss" and
"Terminator 2: Judgment Day").
And "True Lies," starring Shwarzeneg
ger and Jamie Lee Curtis, fares no better
than Cameron's "Terminator" sequel or his
underwater escapade. The director makes
an obviously adult scenario palatable for the
kid in all of us, sacrificing both story subtle
ty and character nuance and leaving the
sheer force of on-screen pyrotechnics and
the chemistry between Curtis and

Schwarzenegger to pull the audience along
on a two-and-a-half hour joy where to
nowhere and back.
Ironically, only a talent of Cameron's
stature could manage such a feat. And man
age it he does, so that even as the quick
paced "True Lies" — billed as a "story of in
ternational intrigue and domestic chaos" —
moves towards its sketchy conclusion, never
once do we suspect that Cameron's inten
tions are anything but sincere.
Harry Tasker (Schwarzenegger) is a ca
reer spy specially trained in anti-nuclear ter
rorism. Placing his life on the line for his
country is an everyday affair for him. Al
most as everyday as waking-up every morn
ing as a computer sales man — the career
Harry's wife (Curtis) believes he's made his
life's worth. But Harry's taken his relation
ship with his wife and child for granted far
too long and Helen is going to take it lying
down anymore.
Instead she's put together a little adven
ture of her own with the help of a used car
salesman named Simon (Bill Paxton), who
thinks he's devised a full-proof scheme to
pick-up women . . . that is until he tries to
pick-up a secret agent's main squeeze.
Based on a small French film called "La
Totale," Cameron's "True Lies" is most cer
tainly the empty-headed, steroid version
with just enough class to make us forget
what it truly is. The exotic locales, big guns,
tart one liners and violent villains with odd
accents are just what you'd expect from a
production that desperately wants to recall
the golden era of spy movies. What we aren't
ready for — and this is where Cameron's

"movie brat" sensibility both carries him
through and trips him up — is a 40 minute
subplot surrounding Harry's misuse of gov

ernment personnel
and equipment to de
termine the true
identity of Simon
and figure-out if
Helen's really fallen
out of love with him
the like he fears.
And of course we
have no one to thank
— and blame — for
the respite from the
storm but Cameron
himself who doubled
as the film's screen
writer. With one jab
of his mighty pen he
ensnares his audi
ence in a scenario far
more compelling
than the wizard-like
display of technical
force that enshrouds
it, but then writes it
into a shallow hole in
the ground, as if he
were afraid that his au

dience might not have a problem with a jeal
ous lead character as unstable as Jake Lam
otta in "Raging Bull."
And of course we never are allowed to
discover that alter ego of Harry, though it
lurks just beneath the film's surface, be
cause "True Lies" is an action-comedy, not
an action-darA-comedy. Still Cameron a

master at pacing is able to pull a visceral
treat out of his magic bag eventhough it it's
only half full. "True Lies" is what "The Last

Action Hero" tried to be, a summer ago.
Even with its problems it works better be
cause the imaginary world of the domestic
spy is much more palatable than that of
rogue cop.
How appropriate, that Schwarzenegger
played such a key role in both films.
