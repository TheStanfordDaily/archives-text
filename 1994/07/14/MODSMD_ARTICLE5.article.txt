ONE OF THE results of
the upcoming transfer of
employees from the
School of Medicine to the juris
diction of Stanford Health Ser
vices ranks as one of the most
heartless budget-cutting moves
enacted to date.
Essentially, a legion of em
ployees were told, when hired,
that they would receive a cer
tain set of workers' benefits,
such as tuition assistance.
Now, suddenly, these same
benefits are being taken away
as a product of the transition, as
Stanford Health Services and
the Stanford Hospital offer far
less generous benefit packages
than the University itself, and
the transferred employees are
being forced to take the less
generous program.
Many in the administration
and the Stanford Hospital have
attempted to downplay the loss
of benefits, stating that the
Hospital has been "up front"
concerning its lower benefit lev
els.
However, this explanation
amounts to a car dealer being
candid about the amount he's
going to overcharge you, then
demanding that you pay the in

flated price in any event.
Certainly, the ongoing "in
corporation" of the Stanford
Hospital which in part sparked
this move is necessary; it is a
fact admitted by all that the
Hospital comes with a hefty
price tag that the University
may not be able to continually
afford.
Furthermore, with the pos
sibility of health-care reform
looming on the horizon, it is
clear that the Hospital may face
difficult times, in which it must
be willing to restructure itself
or face an unsure fate.
Yet the need for restructur
ing should not be an excuse for
reneging on promises that
Stanford has made to its em
ployees.
Indeed, it is unfortunate
that in the course of incorpora
tion, the University has seen fit
to sell many of its workers
short.
In school, children are
taught that a man, or a Uni
versity for that matter, is only
as good as his or its word. It's
a catechism Stanford should
keep in mind when consider
ing its agreements with work
ers.
