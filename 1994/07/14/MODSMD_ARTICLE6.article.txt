# A 						new step for safety
## 
### 
THE LAST two weeks
have witnessed two vio
lent crimes on the Stan
ford campus. Last Sunday's
rape and the preceding Tues
day's armed robbery at the Cof
fee House have issued notice
that despite the pristine, tran
quil beauty of summer at Stan
ford, danger still exists among
the palm trees and sandstone
towers we call home.
Indeed, though Stanford
has had phenomenally little
crime over the past several
decades, the crimes serve as a
reminder that University stu
dents and staff must always
keep on guard. Moreover,
though, they point out the con
tinuing need for further safety
devices on campus — most
noteably, the addition of "blue
light" phones.
Such phones, liberally placed
around campus with an empha

sis on out-of-the-way areas
such as where last Sunday's
rape occured, would be an enor
mous boon to campus safety.
Equipped with a beckoning
blue light, the phones would
also have the capacity to link
users to any on-campus num
ber, including the Stanford po
lice.
Moreover, additional secu
rity devices like that being in
stalled at the Coffee House
would also be a welcome addi
tion to the campus. Admitted
ly, no one wishes to destroy
the campus' freedom into a
more garrison-type atmos
phere.
However, merely adding
silent alarms at Tresidder es
tablishments and a few other
judicious sites would not se
verely compromise the campus'
freedom and would protect the
safety of its workers as well.
