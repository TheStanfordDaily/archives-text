## Approaching Stanford 
### 
BUMP-THUNK, bump
thunk.. . Ah, the familiar
feel of driving down Palm
Drive.
But finally, with the Palm
Drive Reconstruction Project in
progress, our days of buying shock
absorbers or straddling the center
divide to avoid the countless pot
holes that abound are numbered.
From July 11 through Sept. 15,
Palm Drive will be closed between
Arboretum and the Oval. Al
though the construction in
evitably produces inconveniences
for motorists, cyclists and pedes
trians, this is a much anticipated
and needed improvement.
Funding for the complete reno
vation of Palm Drive comes from
the General Plan Fund (taxes on
new buildings). The estimated
total cost is three million dollars.
At a time when funding in areas
such as research are being cut by
nearly 50 percent, is it worth it to
spend such a large sum on what
most would call campus beautifi
cation? Absolutely.
As the formal entrance to the
university, Palm Drive should be a
grand entrance befitting Stanford.
As tourists, students, faculty, ad
ministration, alumni and other vis
itors to campus take a trip down
Palm Drive, they should be entitled
to a smooth ride culminating with
the majestic site of gentle green and
beige foothills painting the back
ground of Memorial Church.
Over the past centennial, how

ever, dilapidation and the fact that
Palm Drive gradually has become
a major link in the regional trans
portation network inevitably has
resulted in decay of the road and of
the surrounding aesthetics.
In the reconstruction project
plan, safety is a primary concern.
All potholes will be replaced by a
smoothly repaved road for all
modes of commuters and travelers
to enjoy. Additionally, a granite
curb will be built to sharpen the
roadway edge. Next to the curb, a
drainage system will be installed to
collect storm water that has in
years past threatened to flood and
sweep cars away.
Efforts to preserve the histori
cal value of Palm Drive are to be
applauded. Although the demands
of modern vehicular traffic must
be met, Palm Drive's historical in
tegrity should not be sacrificed at
any expense.
In the original design, the road
way was used solely for trans
portation by horse and carriage.
One hundred years later, the seg
ment of Palm Drive between El
Camino Real and Arboretum Road
has become congested with traffic.
The intersection in general has cre
ated problems. The dilemma of
whether or not to install a left turn
lane for vehicles traveling away from
the Oval to the shopping mall arose.
The addition of a left-turn lane
would create a bulge in the ap
proach of Stanford's most prized
boulevard. More importantly, the

left turn traffic signal unavoidably
would hang in the center of the
street blocking the focal vista of
Memorial Church's mosaic. The
decision was easily reached. End
result: no left turn.
Thank you very much.
If Palm Drive is to be employed
by trafTic headed for the Sand Hill
corridor or points beyond as a
daily alternative route or thor
oughfare then we might as well
have an arch above the sandstone
gates on El Camino Real that
reads "Palm Drive Expressway
rather than Leland Stanford Jr.
University (which incidentally
hasn't been restored since the
earthquake of 1906).
The preservation, restoration,
and enhancement of Palm Drive's
place in Stanford history should
be the primary goal. As conceived
by its Founders, Palm Drive
should carry people from all over
America to the architectural
crown of Stanford, the Main Quad
— not the shopping mall or High
way 280.
Restore the roadway, restrict
heavy traffic, replant the Canary
Palms that are missing or dam
aged and return Palm Drive to the
Stanford Community.
