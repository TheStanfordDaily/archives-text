The nation's 'ivory
towers 9 in need of
immediate facelift
This is in response to President
Gerhard Casper's comments on
the need for reinventing Stanford.
Given some of the trends these
last 35 years, I agree on that point.
However, President Casper
stated that universities have
never been ivory towers isolated
from intellectual, technological,
social, political and economic
pressures of their world and age.
How can he say this?
Liberals (radicals is probably a
more descriptive term) have been
in control of our Congress and ed
ucational institutions these past
35 years, and what have they
wrought?
Not only is violent crime high,
growing and more vicious and
senseless than ever, but our liber

al courts and juries are unable to
deal with it.
Our public schools turn out
students with ever lower SAT
scores and the school administra
tors adamantly refuse to listen to
the recommendations of parents.
Also, welfare has become a way
of We for too many; Congress has
the lowest public approval rating
ever (29 percent) and our national
debt is well over $4.5 trillion and
still growing.
Abraham Lincoln once said
that the government of today is
determined by the universities of
yesterday. If this is true, what are
President Casper and Stanford
going to do about it?
Our universities need to look
outward. How are we going to res
cue our failing country?
President Casper talks bout
the information revolution. That
is interesting, but the question is
not how are we going to teach, the
question is what should we teach.
Most students are sadly un-

aware of the genius that is cap
tured in our constitution. Of all
the intellectuals I know or read
about, not one dwells on the good
of our nation, but they can talk or
write for hours about our ills.
Stanford needs to help rescue the
USA from the segment of society
that has a death wish, even
though I know that is not chit.
Stanford asks for donations. I
will not donate until I see some real
changes. I want to see some classes
eliminated that are not core. I want
to see professors teaching more
hours per week. I strongly object to
Stanford providing housing and
medical benefits to homosexual
partners in a committed relation
ship. What is a "committed relation
ship," ajoint bank account? How do
such partners benefit society?
Finally, President Casper
writes on ongoing revolution in
the world of science and engineer
ing. He is right. These students
are pressed with extremely diffi
cult and ever changing chal-

lenges. They have to know their
subjects or "things don't work."
Contrast this with the stable sub
ject, greatly given to subjective
though and analysis. Differences
of opinion are expected etc. I per
sonally think a B.S. in science/en
gineering merits a good five years,
whereas a bachelor's in Litera
ture/Sociology/History etc. could
be won in only three years. Why
should all majors take the same
amount of time?
