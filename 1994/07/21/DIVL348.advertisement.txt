Subrahamanyan Chandrasekhar
The Series Paintings of Claude Monet and the Landscape of General Relativity
Are scientists and artists similarly motivated in their respective pursuits? A Nobel
Monday Prize winning astrophysicist, Dr. Chandrasekhar invented the concept of the white

8:00 P.M. Republic of China, was one of the two or three leaders of liberal opinion in China at
the time of the Tiananmen Square tragedy.
Wolfgang K. H. Panofsky
Physical Heritage of the Cold War
The safeguarding, storage, and eventual destaiction of nuclear devices is turning
Thursday out to be more difficult than their production... Wolfgang Panofsky directed the
July 28 Stanford Linear Accelerator Center from 1961-84. While elementary particle physics
8:00 P.M. experimentation and accelerator design were the focus of his career, he served as a
consultant to the Los Alamos Laboratory during the war years. Since then, he has
advised numerous government agencies and presidents and written often on the
subject of arms control.
Yuval Ne'eman
Copernican Humility, Chance and the Creation of Purpose
