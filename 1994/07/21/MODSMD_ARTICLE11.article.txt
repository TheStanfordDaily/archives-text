# Graduate housing proposals approved
## 
### 
If all goes according to plan, the University will be
building two housing facilities to meet the growing
needs of graduate students and the Business School's
summer program guests.
Housing and Dining Services Director Keith Guy
proposed the two new residences at June's Board of
Trustees meeting, where the proposal received cite
and concept approval.
The proposal now awaits program approval from the
board, which is expected to come in October. The con
struction would result in a new residence at Manzanita
Park and apartments near Governor's Corner, to be
built over the next five years at a cost of over $30 million.
The Manzanita project will be designed and built pri
marily to meet the demands of participants in the sum
mer executive education program in the Graduate
School of Business, according to Guy. Du ring the regular
school year, Business School students will get first prior
ity among graduate students for housing in the facility.
Construction of the Manzanita housing is not set
to begin until the summer of 1997.
A need for housing arose in the summer executive
program because participants found the undergradu
ate dorms they are currently housed in to be inade
quate, according to Paul Johnson, associate dean of
administration in the Business School.
Johnson stated that participants have previously
chosen to move out of the dorms and into hotels when
the weather becomes too hot. Because participants

take classes on campus and study in groups, he cited a
desire to keep the executives on campus and together.
The summer executive education program is actually
comprised of several different training programs, lasting
anywhere from two to seven weeks. Since two or three
programs may run concurrently, Johnson believes that
275 executives will need to be housed at one given time.
On the other side of campus, the Governor's Cor
ner project is proposed to consist of 113 apartments,
according to Guy. Each apartment will house two
graduate students.
"We will begin construction next June [on this
project], if all goes as planned," said Guy. Barring
construction delays, he added that work should he
completed by the fall of 1996.
The estimated cost of the Governor's Corner pro
ject is $12-14 million, while the Manzanita project is
estimated at $20-23 million.
Funding for the Governor's Corner project will
come out of the Capital Improvement Program and
long term debt to the University, while the GSB/Man
zanita project will depend on successful fund raising,
gift money, and long-term debt, said Guy.
The Manzanita site will replace the remaining
trailers in the park. Completion of construction
would be the end of intense renovation of the area,
which began with construction of the Kimball, Cas
tano and Lantana dormitories.
