## Flo Mo renovations continue Four Row houses also on the summer agenda 
### Sandy Nesbit Tracy 
Renovation of Florence Moore
Hall got a late start this summer,
but housing officials have been as
sured it will be ready for occupan
cy for the fall term.
In addition, repair work on four
row houses began earlier this
summer and is "right on target,"
said Keith Guy, director of Hous
ing and Dining Services.
The renovation projects are
part of the $110 million, 10-year
Capital Improvement Project
(CIP) that began last summer
with Wilbur Hall's renovation.
Each summer one large dormito
ry and four row houses are closed
for the work. Renovation of
graduate housing in Escondido
Village and Mirrielees is ongo
ing.
The row houses being renovat
ed this summer are Grove Lasuen
and Phi Sig, both built before
1920, 553 Mayfield, built before
1930, and Hammarsjold, built in
1934. Phi Sig is undergoing struc
tural repairs from termite dam
age, Guy said. He said termite
damage is periodically found in
some of the 40 wood structures on
campus.
Guy said that the actual repair
work follows studies to determine
necessary remodeling and long
term maintenance. Improvements
include computer wiring, renovat
ed lounge areas, new furniture, re
painting and carpeting, architec
tural improvements and alter
ations in dining services and land
scaping.
Further efforts include as
bestos work, long-term seismic
strengthening and electricity and
plumbing updating. Improved fire
code compliance includes the in

stallation sprinkler systems being
installed in all dormitories that do
not already have them.
SUNet and cable TV line instal
lation is on an accelerated sched
ule, said Rodger Whitney, associ
ate director of housing services for
facilities. Wiring will be 75 percent
complete this fall, with all housing
connected by the end of the fourth
year.
Compliance with the Ameri
cans with Disabilities Act (ADA)
is part of the long-term master
plan. All of Rains and six or
seven apartments in Escondido
are currently wheelchair-acces
sible for residents, Whitney
said. Flo Mo is being brought up
to ADA standards. He said that
typically 10 to 12 students liv
ing on campus to use wheel
chairs.
Each project is bid on individu
ally and several different contrac

tors complete the renovation,
Whitney said.
Next summer's projects in
clude Stern Hall, Slavianskii Dom,
Sigma Alpha Epsilon, Grove May
field and Haus Mitteleuropa.
Toyon Hall, Lagunita Court,
Branner Hall, Roble Hall,
Crothers Hall and Governor's
Corner are scheduled for succeed
ing years.
The project is funded by a long
term loan. Several million dollars
have been saved over the last few
years by cuts in the operating bud
get, which gave room to borrow
the necessary money, Whitney
said.
A slight increase in housing
charges, less than one percent
above the cost rise, goes toward
the renovation loan costs, Whit
ney added. The renovation is pro
ceeding within the projected cost,
Guy said.
