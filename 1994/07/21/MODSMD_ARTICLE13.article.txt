# Casper testifies
## Breyer receives approval 
### 
Stanford graduate and
Supreme Court nominee
Stephen Breyer completed four
days of confirmation hearings
last week, which included testi
mony from University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper and Law
School Prof. Kathleen Sullivan.
On Tuesday, the Senate Ju
diciary Committee unanimous
ly approved the nomination of
Breyer to the Supreme Court.
Full Senate confirmation could
come as early as tomorrow and
is expected no later than the
end of this month.
Breyer, told by telephone
about the committee's vote by
Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-
Mass., said, "I'm very pleased.
I'm absolutely delighted. It's a
fine vote of confidence."
Both Casper and Sullivan
were called by the White House
to testify on Breyer's behalf be
cause of their extensive back
grounds in constitutional law.
Casper, who said he was "not
testifying in [his] role as (Uni
versity) president," called Brey
er "a lawyer of the highest
grade."
He went on to point out some
of Breyer's past accomplish
ments, including his service in
the Antitrust Division of the
Justice Department and as
chief counsel to the Senate Ju
diciary Committee in 1979-
1980.
"I have always thought of
Stephen Breyer as a man of
strong ideals who thinks and
worries much about justice,"
Casper said, adding that "one
can readily agree or disagree
with Judge Breyer because he is
clear about where he stands."

Sullivan, a colleague of Brey
er's on the faculty of Harvard
law School before her move to
Stanford, added that the nomi
nee would "bring great credit to
the Court."
To support this argument,
Sullivan discussed how Brey
er's "pragmatic philosophy,"
"legal craftsmanship" and "ju
dicious temperament" would
help him serve "with the great
est distinction as an Associate
Justice on the United States
Supreme Court."
The American Bar Associa
tion also praised Breyer on Fri
day, giving him its highest rat
ing of "well qualified."
Consumer activist Ralph
Nader voiced some criticism
during the hearing, however,
calling Breyer an insensitive ex
tremist who "belittles hazards
and risks and exaggerates
costs" in health-and-safety
cases.
Breyer has served as a feder
al jurist for the past 14 years
and is currently chief judge of
the Ist U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals. He was nominated last
May by President Clinton to re
place retiring Justice Harry
Blackmun. If confirmed, Brey
er will become the fourth Stan
ford graduate to serve on the
Supreme Court, joining Jus
tices Sandra Day O'Connor and
Anthony Kennedy and Chief
Justice William Rehnquist.
Breyer — whose son is a
sophomore at Stanford — grad
uated in the top five percent of
Stanford's class of 1959 with a
major in philosophy.
