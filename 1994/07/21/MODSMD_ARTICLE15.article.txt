Sperm storage centers?
As odd as this idea might sound,
two leading scientists are saying
that the prospects for develop
ment of a male birth-control pill
are bleak, and that the best
method of reversible male contra
ception may be for a man to store
samples of his sperm for later use
and then undergo a vasectomy.
Dr. Carl Djerassi, the Stanford
chemist who invented the first fe
male contraceptive pill, and Dr.
Stanley Leibo, of the University of
Guelph in Ontario, recently pub
lished an article in the journal Na
ture calling for the military to per
form large-scale experiments to
test the viability of stored sperm to
build confidence in this novel the
ory.
In the proposed experiments,
the military would collect sperm
samples from a large number of
volunteers, and then freeze the
samples. The sperm would then be
examined by researchers over time
to see if the storage had caused any
genetic damage or loss of fertility.
The volunteers would not be asked
to undergo vasectomies.
The military services should
conduct such experiments because
they have access to large numbers
of young men as well as those
men's medical records, according
to the authors. The experiments
could therefore be carried out with
relatively little difficulty or cost,
they added.
The army, furthermore, "has
an interest" in this form of "genet
ic insurance," said Djerassi, be
cause, as the largest employer of

men in a very dangerous occupa
tion, the potential, for soldiers to fa
ther children after damage to their
reproductive systems, or even
death, should be very attractive.
Bovine sperm up to 37 years old
has been successfully used to fer
tilize eggs, Djerassi and Leibo
wrote. A normal amount of human
ejaculate contains over 20 million
sperm, and even if only one per
cent, 200,000 sperm, survive stor
age, that would be adequate for
fertilization using the latest meth
ods.
If the experiments prove what
Djerassi and Leibo expect to be
true — that human sperm can be
safely stored for long periods of
time — the next step would be for
men to store several frozen sam
ples of their sperm and have vasec
tomies. More than 500,000 Ameri
can men per year already have va
sectomies, called the "simplest
and safest" form of sterilization by
the World Health Organization.
When men were ready to repro
duce, they would use their stored
samples to perform artificial in
semination, a process undergone
by 172,000 American women last
year. A single treatment of artifi
cial insemination costs $250; five
cycles of insemination cost $1,500.
"I believe very strongly that
men should share the burden of
reproductive responsibility," said
Dr. Djerassi, adding that given the
lack of male contraceptive pill, this
is the best available method.
Development of a male birth
control pill will take at least 15 to
20 years "starting with the labora
tory invention and finishing with
FDA approval," said Dr. Djerassi.
"Not a single pharmaceutical
company, to my knowledge, is
doing research on male contracep
tive pills," he added, meaning that
even after the year 2010 the
prospects for a male pill are still
"dismal."
