Two Stanford professors, geolo
gist Elizabeth Miller and geo
physicist Simon Klemperer, are
leading the first joint US-Russian
study of the Arctic-Alaska plate, in
order to gain a geophysical profile
of the continental crust that links
Eurasia to North America.
One of the main goals of the
project is to learn more about the
behavior of the deep crust —
which lies as a partially sub
merged isthmus on the ocean floor
connecting the two continents —
as plates collide with one another
and push terrain upward to form
features on land.
"It's very hard to look at how
the lower crust works," Klemperer
said in a press release. "Here we
may find out how the crust is made
by the process of terrain accretion
[the expansion and stretching of
land]. Alaskan geology changes
from east to west. .. . We want to
find out why."
Combining their data with ob
servations by scientists from the
U.S. Geological Survey and several
Russian universities, Miller and
Klemperer will produce the first
cross-sectional profile across the
continental bridge. With these find
ings the investigators hope to even
tually open a data base to explain
the plate tectonics in the region.
The work of these two scientists
is also being furthered with the
help of several Stanford graduate
students. Geophysics graduate
students Brian Galloway and
Moritz Fliedner are assisting
Klemperer with the sonar readings
of the ocean floor, and Miller is ac
companied by Geology students
Jaime Toro and Jeffrey Amato.
Klemperer's team will focus its
efforts on mapping the ocean floor.
The R/V Ewing, the University

National Oceanographic Labora
tory System's ship, is making a
2,000-mile voyage, zigzagging
through the Aleutian islands and
up into the Bering Strait, profiling
the submerged continental isth
mus that links Alaska and Russia.
Miller and top experts from the
Far East Branch of the Russian
Academy of Sciences will concen
trate their research on data collec
tion from land. Rock types and ge
ologic formations will be cata
logued in various sites in Alaska,
St. Lawrence Island in the Bering
Strait and in remote sites on Rus
sia's Chukotka Peninsula. Analy
sis of these geologic formations
will provide the "ground truth" for
the data gathered by the Ewing.
