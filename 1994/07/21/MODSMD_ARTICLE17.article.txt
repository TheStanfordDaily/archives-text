# Fire and ice: A conversation with Gail Mahood

M academic career,
M Stanford Geology
M Prof. Gail Ma
hood has been
well-known for delving into volca
noes in far-flung parts of the world.
However, over the past year Ma
hood was thrown into another melt
ing pot. As chair for the Faculty Sen
ate Committee on Academic Ap
praisal and Achievement, she led the
crusade to change the grading sys
tem, a campaign which culminated
June 2 when the Faculty Senate
voted 38-3 to institute a new grading
system almost identical to that pro
posed by Mahood's committee.
The grading-policy debate also
cast Mahood into a media cauldron.
Over the course of the grading-policy
debate at Stanford, Mahood and the
policy she created were the subject of
vast amounts of media attention.
Publications as varied as Time,
the Economist and the Walla
Walla (Wash.) Daily Bulletin ran sto
ries about the policy which Mahood
had done much to shape.
Yet now that the dust has settled
and the media has stopped knocking
at her door, Mahood has had time to
reflect on the new grading policy, the
development of which at times liter
ally became a "full-time" job.
I think that even if we hadn't had
the charge from the senate (to change
the policy) then we would have done
something similar because there was
a general feeling that Stanford's
grading policy had facts about it that
we didn't like.
ahood's involvement
in the grading-policy
112 MMM debate began in Nov.
112 1992, when she as-
W sumed the chair of
J the Committee on Academic Ap
praisal and Achievement.
The committee, charged to exam
ine whether there should be any
changes in grading practices at Stan
ford, was formed to address the wor
ries of some senators that the pre
sent system gave students "paradox
ical incentives for strange behav
iors" involving their classwork, said
Mahood.
Following the senate's charge,
the committee spent most of winter
and spring discussing the issue and
designing a survey in order to gain
feedback on the issue from faculty.
"The main (reason for the survey)
was to find out whether people want
ed a grading policy that produced a
transcript that was, what we eu
phemistically call, a 'record of
achievement' which only records the
positive outcomes that a student
has, versus a 'historical record'
which will record all course activi
ties," she said.
The result of the surveys — 75
percent of the faculty who expressed
an opinion wanted a transcript that
was a "historical record" — gave Ma
hood a clear go-ahead to draw up a
proposal for a new grading policy,
she said.
This April, Mahood's committee

presented the finished proposal to
the full senate. After a month of
campus debate, the grading-policy
process finally culminated with the
June 2 senate vote, and the policy
will go into effect for the 1995-96
school year.
The new policy will include
stricter add/drop deadlines, more re
strictive rules on retaking courses,
and brings back the failing grade,
not been given at Stanford for the
last 24 years.
A lot of why I felt so strongly about
[changing the policy] comes down to
a very strong-rooted sense of fairness
and equity.
jA ahood stated that
there were a plethora
112 MfR of reasons why she
M Ww felt changes to the
r current grading poli
cy were necessary. One of most
pressing such motivations, Mahood
said, involved the current retake pol
icy for classes.
"The system we had," she said,
"put certain (social) classes of stu
dents at a disadvantage."
She explained that if two Stan
ford students with the same grades
were applying to medical school, the
transcript failed to show that the
student from the poorer family may
have to work at a job 10 hours a week
and didn't have the time to retake a
lot of courses that the wealthier stu
dent, who didn't have to work, did.
"That really bugs me about the
system, that someone looking at
their transcripts would have no way
of knowing the difference," she said.
"I really feel strongly that Stanford
should do the best to have a system
that does not put at disadvantage
those students that don't come from
wealthy families."
Although Mahood said that the
committee "assumed" that employ
ers and graduate schools would want
more information in a form of a more
"historical transcript," she said that
she "utterly rejects the cynical view"
that the committee was trying to
"salvage Stanford's reputation" by
making the changes.
"I personally was not motivated
by what people thought on the out
side ... I was much more motivated
by what I thought would be a better
system to get students to engage
more seriously in their academic and
intellectual lives here," she main
tained.
Mahood denied that bringing
back the F grade was a primary con
cern of faculty members, but instead
said that faculty expressed a desire
to return to more "central" grading
policy than that which was in effect.
"There were general reasons for
wanting to change the grading policy
(in 1970, the last year in which thd
system was overhauled) to make
things more flexible and to encour
age students to explore more, she
said, "But in my view 1 think they
overstepped the mark."
Since the massive changes to the
grading policy which occurred in
1970, she explained, there has been

"incremental changes" back to the
old system. "(In 1970) they got rid of
the D and the F and then they got rid
of plus and minus modifiers. Then
pretty soon plus and minus modi
fiers came back and then the D grade
came back so what you saw was this
kind of back-pedaling from that posi
tion."
Mahood attributes this slow
movement to the fact that many fac
ulty members thought that the grad
ing policy in the '70s was too much
like a "record of achievement" than
they were comfortable with.
"I think that basically the
changes been made now are in line
with that — we're basically bringing
it back to a more moderate position,"
she said.
Although she stated that Stan
ford's grading policy is moving back
to the norm for universities, she still
insists, "We're still on the generous
side."
The retake policy was cited by Ma
hood as one aspect of the grading
system heavily in need of re-evalua
tion. She added that the policy lent
itself to manipulation by students.
"I think when you have a set of
rules, they are a set of incentives,
and so if students take advantage of
these rules one shouldn't say they're
being irresponsible or trying to game
the system — they're just using the
rules in a way that's most beneficial
to them," she explained. "We want a
system that puts the incentives in
the right place."
Mahood said that she was "horri
fied" by some e-mail messages that
she received concerning the new
grading policy. In some, Mahood
stated, students had written, "the
only reason I came to Stanford was
because of the grading system."
Her reply: "What about the palm
trees?"
Mahood also sees further benefits
to students from the new policy. She
said that she hopes the new policy
will force students to choose their
classes more carefully, concentrate
their efforts on fewer classes and
manage their time better to avoid
getting into situations where they
become so over-extended that their
coursework suffers.
"The system we had before gave
people lots of outs for lack of plan
ning — there won't be so many any
more," she said.
Students should realize that
when they 're leaving with a B it's not
just a B, it's a B from Stanford,
which is worth a lot.
everal aspects of the
new grading system
have come under fire
by professors and stu
dents alike. Some
see the changes as part of
a larger effort to combat what they
consider the illusory problem of
grade inflation.
In this vein, former Assoc. Prof, of
Communication Jeremy Cohen re
cently said, "faculty cynicism is ap
parent in the desperate need to rein
state the F grade... if an A indicates

b\f Dlncent -He

superior work and superior work in
dicates mastery of the subject then
one-third of my students are A stu
dents."
In response to this comment, Ma
hood said that she thinks he is
"right-on" in his assessment that a
third of his students deserve A
grades but that that's not what the
distribution of grades is showing.
"If the median is an A-minus that
means that 50 percent of grades are
A-minus and above and 50 percent of
grades are A-minus or below . . .that
means that A doesn't mean excel
lent; it means something else." Ma
hood said.
Also, Mahood totally disagrees
that there is any "cynicism" on the
part of the faculty because she "sim
ply doesn't believe" that, in language
courses for example, the distribution
of students receiving A's represents
the number that actually "deserve to
receive A's."
She also was quick to respond to
Cohen's point that Stanford stu
dents' high grades are merely a con
tinuation of their high-achieving
high-school years.
"If that's the reasoning, then why
bother gradingthem at all," she said.
"If we were to rank [students] on a
national scale maybe most of them
would be getting A's, but this is
Stanford."
In addition to other faculty skep
tics such as Cohen, not every senator
favored the proposal. Three Faculty
Senate members, including English
Dept. Chair Ron Rebholtz, voted
against the policy.
In the June 2 discussion which
preceded the vote, Rebholtz said he
disagreed with the underlying phi
losophy that the "record of achieve
ment" was not adequate. "I see no
reason why we are in this punitive
mode, which is essentially what most
of the body is in. We are branding our
students," he said.
In response, Mahood said that she
doesn't think that there was any evi
dence that the faculty was in a "puni
tive mode" and that "Ron was being
a little overly dramatic."
"The fact of the matter is, so few F
grades were given when we had them
before so it's really a non-issue... if
the faculty didn't like to give C's and
almost none gave D's then there's no
reason to believe that suddenly the
faculty will be giving lots of F's," she
said.
"Bringing back failing grades
wasn't the big issue [for students],
the big issue was about drop dates
and that's where the impact lies on
the students," she added.
Mahood said that she does not
"buy" the argument that the new
policy will discourage "academic
exploration" and "take away the
flexibility that Stanford is known
for."
"Basically we have plenty of
things in place that allow students to
explore; we have the satisfactory/no
credit grade so students can sign up
for courses without jeopardizing
their G.P.A. and we still allow stu
dents to drop courses up until the
end of the fourth week, which I be

lieve is enough time to make their
decisions," she explained.
Although she is ready to agree
that the change in the drop-dead
lines was the main bone of con
tention for students, she said she
doesn't believe it could be resolved
because the students' position and
the faculty's position were "philo
sophically different."
"Faculty felt that students should
be making their choices based on
whether something was interesting
or well-taught and not based on
what grade they would get... if you
put it [the drop date] at three weeks
it's plenty of time to know whether
the course is suitable but if you need
to know how you're going to do then
it's got to be the seventh week," she
explained.
All told, Mahood believes that
many of the students' and faculty's
complaints are much ado about
nothing. "Students have portrayed
this [grading policy change] as being
very serious and severe and dracon
ian but actually ifyou look at our pol
icy compared with most schools we
still have one of the most generous
drop dates of any of our competitors
and our retake policy is still the most
generous."
I was totally taken by surprise, for
the first week after the senate adopt
ed it [grading policy] I was on the
telephone all day talking to people
.. . many of us are trained to be good
scientists but you don't learn to be a
media star. Once 1 ended up on a
radio program without even realiz
ing it.
n retrospect Mahood
112 Wsaid that she is not
m M surprised by the level
of media coverage de
voted to the develop
ment of the new grading policy, espe
cially with it all "happening around
graduation time when colleges are
on peoples minds."
She admits that she would get a
little annoyed by remarks from the
press media like, "last week the
school [Stanford] turned its back on
slacker-friendly grading and rein
stated a failing grade," a comment
found within the June 13 issue of
Time.
"I would say, hey look, we're
changing that, don't ding us for
something we did in the past."
But she believes that the media is
tempted to "beat up" on higher edu
cation because of an "anti-intellectu
al climate" in the U.S. at the mo
ment.
"Its also tempting to [attack]
Stanford because it's a private insti
tution and it's on the 'laid-back'
West Coast ... the fact of it is that
we are in the forefront of many dif
ferent issues and we tend to conduct
our business more in public than
other campuses," she explained.
However Mahood was concerned
about the media's attention to Stan
ford's median grade being an A
minus because she said that in the
natural sciences and engineering B
and C grades are quite common.

"I would try to point out to them
that the median grade [encompasses
the entire University] and it is im
portant to recognize that the grade
distribution across the campus is
very different ... I wouldn't want
our natural sciences and engineering
to be put at a disadvantage because
B's in natural sciences and engineer
ing are perfectly fine," she said.
But denied that she believes hu
manities courses are easier, solely
because students in the humanities
are getting higher grades.
"I don't think it's so much that
it's easier, it's just that those faculty
apparently have different ways of
viewing the way grades should be
employed. . . also I think that funda
mentally the material you use for
grading in the sciences such as prob
lem sets makes it much easier for a
faculty member to justify a specific
grade whereas it's much harder to do
that say for an English literature
paper."
I think that grade inflation truly
is a problem ... it makes it harder
and harder to identify and reward
truly outstanding students and sec
ondly it leads to a stage where tran
scripts are not terribly useful for
graduate schools because then the
decision is more based on who the
student can get to write a recommen
dation and not on the students' per
formance.
JU ccording to Mahood, the
primary purpose of the
recent changes to the
grading policy was to ef-
W ™ feet a more accurate
''historical transcript" and not to
combat grade inflation. However,
she hopes that the Faculty Senate —
and incoming CAAA chair Van Har
vey, a professor of religious studies
— will address the latter subject next
year.
"The part I'm more concerned
about [in addressing grade infla
tion], which I hope the CAAA will ad
dress next year, is the large differ
ences in the way we grade in the sci
ences and engineering and the way
they grade in the humanities ... I
think that's really a problem because
it means we're not speaking the
same language."
Mahood added that if this is the
case, a possible solution would be
to eliminate grades altogether and
have instructors write one-on-one
evaluations of students. However,
she quickly pointed out that this
method of assessing students' per
formance would not be feasible
with large classes like those typi
cal in chemistry or physics, where
instructors' "contact with stu
dents is just not sufficient," she
said.
Mahood said that the faculty are
"nowhere near" making any policy
suggestions to solve grade inflation
and that it is more important that
the faculty actually talks about it
first, "It is more likely at a faculty
meeting that we'd talk about sex
than we'd talk about grade inflation
— it's really that taboo," she said.

ford's median grade being an A
minus because she said that in the
natural sciences and engineering B
and C grades are quite common.

"I would try to point out to them
that the median grade [encompasses
the entire University] and it is im
portant to recognize that the grade
distribution across the campus is
very different ... I wouldn't want
our natural sciences and engineering
to be put at a disadvantage because
B's in natural sciences and engineer
ing are perfectly fine," she said.
But denied that she believes hu
manities courses are easier, solely
because students in the humanities
are getting higher grades.
"I don't think it's so much that
it's easier, it's just that those faculty
apparently have different ways of
viewing the way grades should be
employed. . . also I think that funda
mentally the material you use for
grading in the sciences such as prob
lem sets makes it much easier for a
faculty member to justify a specific
grade whereas it's much harder to do
that say for an English literature
paper."
I think that grade inflation truly
is a problem ... it makes it harder
and harder to identify and reward
truly outstanding students and sec
ondly it leads to a stage where tran
scripts are not terribly useful for
graduate schools because then the
decision is more based on who the
student can get to write a recommen
dation and not on the students' per
formance.
JU ccording to Mahood, the
primary purpose of the
recent changes to the
grading policy was to ef-
W ™ feet a more accurate
''historical transcript" and not to
combat grade inflation. However,
she hopes that the Faculty Senate —
and incoming CAAA chair Van Har
vey, a professor of religious studies
— will address the latter subject next
year.
"The part I'm more concerned
about [in addressing grade infla
tion], which I hope the CAAA will ad
dress next year, is the large differ
ences in the way we grade in the sci
ences and engineering and the way
they grade in the humanities ... I
think that's really a problem because
it means we're not speaking the
same language."
Mahood added that if this is the
case, a possible solution would be
to eliminate grades altogether and
have instructors write one-on-one
evaluations of students. However,
she quickly pointed out that this
method of assessing students' per
formance would not be feasible
with large classes like those typi
cal in chemistry or physics, where
instructors' "contact with stu
dents is just not sufficient," she
said.
Mahood said that the faculty are
"nowhere near" making any policy
suggestions to solve grade inflation
and that it is more important that
the faculty actually talks about it
first, "It is more likely at a faculty
meeting that we'd talk about sex
than we'd talk about grade inflation
— it's really that taboo," she said.

112 M hroughout her
M academic career,
M Stanford Geology
M Prof. Gail Ma
hood has been
well-known for delving into volca
noes in far-flung parts of the world.
However, over the past year Ma
hood was thrown into another melt
ing pot. As chair for the Faculty Sen
ate Committee on Academic Ap
praisal and Achievement, she led the
crusade to change the grading sys
tem, a campaign which culminated
June 2 when the Faculty Senate
voted 38-3 to institute a new grading
system almost identical to that pro
posed by Mahood's committee.
The grading-policy debate also
cast Mahood into a media cauldron.
Over the course of the grading-policy
debate at Stanford, Mahood and the
policy she created were the subject of
vast amounts of media attention.
Publications as varied as Time,
the Economist and the Walla
Walla (Wash.) Daily Bulletin ran sto
ries about the policy which Mahood
had done much to shape.
Yet now that the dust has settled
and the media has stopped knocking
at her door, Mahood has had time to
reflect on the new grading policy, the
development of which at times liter
ally became a "full-time" job.
I think that even if we hadn't had
the charge from the senate (to change
the policy) then we would have done
something similar because there was
a general feeling that Stanford's
grading policy had facts about it that
we didn't like.
ahood's involvement
in the grading-policy
112 MMM debate began in Nov.
112 1992, when she as-
W sumed the chair of
J the Committee on Academic Ap
praisal and Achievement.
The committee, charged to exam
ine whether there should be any
changes in grading practices at Stan
ford, was formed to address the wor
ries of some senators that the pre
sent system gave students "paradox
ical incentives for strange behav
iors" involving their classwork, said
Mahood.
Following the senate's charge,
the committee spent most of winter
and spring discussing the issue and
designing a survey in order to gain
feedback on the issue from faculty.
"The main (reason for the survey)
was to find out whether people want
ed a grading policy that produced a
transcript that was, what we eu
phemistically call, a 'record of
achievement' which only records the
positive outcomes that a student
has, versus a 'historical record'
which will record all course activi
ties," she said.
The result of the surveys — 75
percent of the faculty who expressed
an opinion wanted a transcript that
was a "historical record" — gave Ma
hood a clear go-ahead to draw up a
proposal for a new grading policy,
she said.
This April, Mahood's committee

presented the finished proposal to
the full senate. After a month of
campus debate, the grading-policy
process finally culminated with the
June 2 senate vote, and the policy
will go into effect for the 1995-96
school year.
The new policy will include
stricter add/drop deadlines, more re
strictive rules on retaking courses,
and brings back the failing grade,
not been given at Stanford for the
last 24 years.
A lot of why I felt so strongly about
[changing the policy] comes down to
a very strong-rooted sense of fairness
and equity.
jA ahood stated that
there were a plethora
112 MfR of reasons why she
M Ww felt changes to the
r current grading poli
cy were necessary. One of most
pressing such motivations, Mahood
said, involved the current retake pol
icy for classes.
"The system we had," she said,
"put certain (social) classes of stu
dents at a disadvantage."
She explained that if two Stan
ford students with the same grades
were applying to medical school, the
transcript failed to show that the
student from the poorer family may
have to work at a job 10 hours a week
and didn't have the time to retake a
lot of courses that the wealthier stu
dent, who didn't have to work, did.
"That really bugs me about the
system, that someone looking at
their transcripts would have no way
of knowing the difference," she said.
"I really feel strongly that Stanford
should do the best to have a system
that does not put at disadvantage
those students that don't come from
wealthy families."
Although Mahood said that the
committee "assumed" that employ
ers and graduate schools would want
more information in a form of a more
"historical transcript," she said that
she "utterly rejects the cynical view"
that the committee was trying to
"salvage Stanford's reputation" by
making the changes.
"I personally was not motivated
by what people thought on the out
side ... I was much more motivated
by what I thought would be a better
system to get students to engage
more seriously in their academic and
intellectual lives here," she main
tained.
Mahood denied that bringing
back the F grade was a primary con
cern of faculty members, but instead
said that faculty expressed a desire
to return to more "central" grading
policy than that which was in effect.
"There were general reasons for
wanting to change the grading policy
(in 1970, the last year in which thd
system was overhauled) to make
things more flexible and to encour
age students to explore more, she
said, "But in my view 1 think they
overstepped the mark."
Since the massive changes to the
grading policy which occurred in
1970, she explained, there has been

"incremental changes" back to the
old system. "(In 1970) they got rid of
the D and the F and then they got rid
of plus and minus modifiers. Then
pretty soon plus and minus modi
fiers came back and then the D grade
came back so what you saw was this
kind of back-pedaling from that posi
tion."
Mahood attributes this slow
movement to the fact that many fac
ulty members thought that the grad
ing policy in the '70s was too much
like a "record of achievement" than
they were comfortable with.
"I think that basically the
changes been made now are in line
with that — we're basically bringing
it back to a more moderate position,"
she said.
Although she stated that Stan
ford's grading policy is moving back
to the norm for universities, she still
insists, "We're still on the generous
side."
The retake policy was cited by Ma
hood as one aspect of the grading
system heavily in need of re-evalua
tion. She added that the policy lent
itself to manipulation by students.
"I think when you have a set of
rules, they are a set of incentives,
and so if students take advantage of
these rules one shouldn't say they're
being irresponsible or trying to game
the system — they're just using the
rules in a way that's most beneficial
to them," she explained. "We want a
system that puts the incentives in
the right place."
Mahood said that she was "horri
fied" by some e-mail messages that
she received concerning the new
grading policy. In some, Mahood
stated, students had written, "the
only reason I came to Stanford was
because of the grading system."
Her reply: "What about the palm
trees?"
Mahood also sees further benefits
to students from the new policy. She
said that she hopes the new policy
will force students to choose their
classes more carefully, concentrate
their efforts on fewer classes and
manage their time better to avoid
getting into situations where they
become so over-extended that their
coursework suffers.
"The system we had before gave
people lots of outs for lack of plan
ning — there won't be so many any
more," she said.
Students should realize that
when they 're leaving with a B it's not
just a B, it's a B from Stanford,
which is worth a lot.
everal aspects of the
new grading system
have come under fire
by professors and stu
dents alike. Some
see the changes as part of
a larger effort to combat what they
consider the illusory problem of
grade inflation.
In this vein, former Assoc. Prof, of
Communication Jeremy Cohen re
cently said, "faculty cynicism is ap
parent in the desperate need to rein
state the F grade... if an A indicates

by /}e /VlatshalL

b\f Dlncent -He

superior work and superior work in
dicates mastery of the subject then
one-third of my students are A stu
dents."
In response to this comment, Ma
hood said that she thinks he is
"right-on" in his assessment that a
third of his students deserve A
grades but that that's not what the
distribution of grades is showing.
"If the median is an A-minus that
means that 50 percent of grades are
A-minus and above and 50 percent of
grades are A-minus or below . . .that
means that A doesn't mean excel
lent; it means something else." Ma
hood said.
Also, Mahood totally disagrees
that there is any "cynicism" on the
part of the faculty because she "sim
ply doesn't believe" that, in language
courses for example, the distribution
of students receiving A's represents
the number that actually "deserve to
receive A's."
She also was quick to respond to
Cohen's point that Stanford stu
dents' high grades are merely a con
tinuation of their high-achieving
high-school years.
"If that's the reasoning, then why
bother gradingthem at all," she said.
"If we were to rank [students] on a
national scale maybe most of them
would be getting A's, but this is
Stanford."
In addition to other faculty skep
tics such as Cohen, not every senator
favored the proposal. Three Faculty
Senate members, including English
Dept. Chair Ron Rebholtz, voted
against the policy.
In the June 2 discussion which
preceded the vote, Rebholtz said he
disagreed with the underlying phi
losophy that the "record of achieve
ment" was not adequate. "I see no
reason why we are in this punitive
mode, which is essentially what most
of the body is in. We are branding our
students," he said.
In response, Mahood said that she
doesn't think that there was any evi
dence that the faculty was in a "puni
tive mode" and that "Ron was being
a little overly dramatic."
"The fact of the matter is, so few F
grades were given when we had them
before so it's really a non-issue... if
the faculty didn't like to give C's and
almost none gave D's then there's no
reason to believe that suddenly the
faculty will be giving lots of F's," she
said.
"Bringing back failing grades
wasn't the big issue [for students],
the big issue was about drop dates
and that's where the impact lies on
the students," she added.
Mahood said that she does not
"buy" the argument that the new
policy will discourage "academic
exploration" and "take away the
flexibility that Stanford is known
for."
"Basically we have plenty of
things in place that allow students to
explore; we have the satisfactory/no
credit grade so students can sign up
for courses without jeopardizing
their G.P.A. and we still allow stu
dents to drop courses up until the
end of the fourth week, which I be

lieve is enough time to make their
decisions," she explained.
Although she is ready to agree
that the change in the drop-dead
lines was the main bone of con
tention for students, she said she
doesn't believe it could be resolved
because the students' position and
the faculty's position were "philo
sophically different."
"Faculty felt that students should
be making their choices based on
whether something was interesting
or well-taught and not based on
what grade they would get... if you
put it [the drop date] at three weeks
it's plenty of time to know whether
the course is suitable but if you need
to know how you're going to do then
it's got to be the seventh week," she
explained.
All told, Mahood believes that
many of the students' and faculty's
complaints are much ado about
nothing. "Students have portrayed
this [grading policy change] as being
very serious and severe and dracon
ian but actually ifyou look at our pol
icy compared with most schools we
still have one of the most generous
drop dates of any of our competitors
and our retake policy is still the most
generous."
I was totally taken by surprise, for
the first week after the senate adopt
ed it [grading policy] I was on the
telephone all day talking to people
.. . many of us are trained to be good
scientists but you don't learn to be a
media star. Once 1 ended up on a
radio program without even realiz
ing it.
n retrospect Mahood
112 Wsaid that she is not
m M surprised by the level
of media coverage de
voted to the develop
ment of the new grading policy, espe
cially with it all "happening around
graduation time when colleges are
on peoples minds."
She admits that she would get a
little annoyed by remarks from the
press media like, "last week the
school [Stanford] turned its back on
slacker-friendly grading and rein
stated a failing grade," a comment
found within the June 13 issue of
Time.
"I would say, hey look, we're
changing that, don't ding us for
something we did in the past."
But she believes that the media is
tempted to "beat up" on higher edu
cation because of an "anti-intellectu
al climate" in the U.S. at the mo
ment.
"Its also tempting to [attack]
Stanford because it's a private insti
tution and it's on the 'laid-back'
West Coast ... the fact of it is that
we are in the forefront of many dif
ferent issues and we tend to conduct
our business more in public than
other campuses," she explained.
However Mahood was concerned
about the media's attention to Stan
ford's median grade being an A
minus because she said that in the
natural sciences and engineering B
and C grades are quite common.

"I would try to point out to them
that the median grade [encompasses
the entire University] and it is im
portant to recognize that the grade
distribution across the campus is
very different ... I wouldn't want
our natural sciences and engineering
to be put at a disadvantage because
B's in natural sciences and engineer
ing are perfectly fine," she said.
But denied that she believes hu
manities courses are easier, solely
because students in the humanities
are getting higher grades.
"I don't think it's so much that
it's easier, it's just that those faculty
apparently have different ways of
viewing the way grades should be
employed. . . also I think that funda
mentally the material you use for
grading in the sciences such as prob
lem sets makes it much easier for a
faculty member to justify a specific
grade whereas it's much harder to do
that say for an English literature
paper."
I think that grade inflation truly
is a problem ... it makes it harder
and harder to identify and reward
truly outstanding students and sec
ondly it leads to a stage where tran
scripts are not terribly useful for
graduate schools because then the
decision is more based on who the
student can get to write a recommen
dation and not on the students' per
formance.
JU ccording to Mahood, the
primary purpose of the
recent changes to the
grading policy was to ef-
W ™ feet a more accurate
''historical transcript" and not to
combat grade inflation. However,
she hopes that the Faculty Senate —

— will address the latter subject next

dress next year, is the large differ
ences in the way we grade in the sci
ences and engineering and the way
they grade in the humanities ... I
think that's really a problem because
it means we're not speaking the
same language."
Mahood added that if this is the
case, a possible solution would be
to eliminate grades altogether and
have instructors write one-on-one
evaluations of students. However,
she quickly pointed out that this
method of assessing students' per
formance would not be feasible
with large classes like those typi
cal in chemistry or physics, where
instructors' "contact with stu
dents is just not sufficient," she
said.
Mahood said that the faculty are
"nowhere near" making any policy

and that it is more important that

their G.P.A. and we still allow stu
dents to drop courses up until the
end of the fourth week, which I be

lieve is enough time to make their
decisions," she explained.
Although she is ready to agree
that the change in the drop-dead
lines was the main bone of con
tention for students, she said she
doesn't believe it could be resolved
because the students' position and
the faculty's position were "philo
sophically different."
"Faculty felt that students should
be making their choices based on
whether something was interesting
or well-taught and not based on
what grade they would get... if you
put it [the drop date] at three weeks
it's plenty of time to know whether
the course is suitable but if you need
to know how you're going to do then
it's got to be the seventh week," she
explained.
All told, Mahood believes that
many of the students' and faculty's
complaints are much ado about
nothing. "Students have portrayed
this [grading policy change] as being
very serious and severe and dracon
ian but actually ifyou look at our pol
icy compared with most schools we
still have one of the most generous
drop dates of any of our competitors
and our retake policy is still the most
generous."
I was totally taken by surprise, for
the first week after the senate adopt
ed it [grading policy] I was on the
telephone all day talking to people
.. . many of us are trained to be good
scientists but you don't learn to be a
media star. Once 1 ended up on a
radio program without even realiz
ing it.
n retrospect Mahood
112 Wsaid that she is not
m M surprised by the level
of media coverage de
voted to the develop
ment of the new grading policy, espe
cially with it all "happening around
graduation time when colleges are
on peoples minds."
She admits that she would get a
little annoyed by remarks from the
press media like, "last week the
school [Stanford] turned its back on
slacker-friendly grading and rein
stated a failing grade," a comment
found within the June 13 issue of
Time.
"I would say, hey look, we're
changing that, don't ding us for
something we did in the past."
But she believes that the media is
tempted to "beat up" on higher edu
cation because of an "anti-intellectu
al climate" in the U.S. at the mo
ment.
"Its also tempting to [attack]
Stanford because it's a private insti
tution and it's on the 'laid-back'
West Coast ... the fact of it is that
we are in the forefront of many dif
ferent issues and we tend to conduct
our business more in public than
other campuses," she explained.
However Mahood was concerned
about the media's attention to Stan
ford's median grade being an A
minus because she said that in the
natural sciences and engineering B
and C grades are quite common.

"I would try to point out to them
that the median grade [encompasses
the entire University] and it is im
portant to recognize that the grade
distribution across the campus is
very different ... I wouldn't want
our natural sciences and engineering
to be put at a disadvantage because
B's in natural sciences and engineer
ing are perfectly fine," she said.
But denied that she believes hu
manities courses are easier, solely
because students in the humanities
are getting higher grades.
"I don't think it's so much that
it's easier, it's just that those faculty
apparently have different ways of
viewing the way grades should be
employed. . . also I think that funda
mentally the material you use for
grading in the sciences such as prob
lem sets makes it much easier for a
faculty member to justify a specific
grade whereas it's much harder to do
that say for an English literature
paper."
I think that grade inflation truly
is a problem ... it makes it harder
and harder to identify and reward
truly outstanding students and sec
ondly it leads to a stage where tran
scripts are not terribly useful for
graduate schools because then the
decision is more based on who the
student can get to write a recommen
dation and not on the students' per
formance.
JU ccording to Mahood, the
primary purpose of the
recent changes to the
grading policy was to ef-
W ™ feet a more accurate
''historical transcript" and not to
combat grade inflation. However,
she hopes that the Faculty Senate —
and incoming CAAA chair Van Har
vey, a professor of religious studies
— will address the latter subject next
year.
"The part I'm more concerned
about [in addressing grade infla
tion], which I hope the CAAA will ad
dress next year, is the large differ
ences in the way we grade in the sci
ences and engineering and the way
they grade in the humanities ... I
think that's really a problem because
it means we're not speaking the
same language."
Mahood added that if this is the
case, a possible solution would be
to eliminate grades altogether and
have instructors write one-on-one
evaluations of students. However,
she quickly pointed out that this
method of assessing students' per
formance would not be feasible
with large classes like those typi
cal in chemistry or physics, where
instructors' "contact with stu
dents is just not sufficient," she
said.
Mahood said that the faculty are
"nowhere near" making any policy
suggestions to solve grade inflation
and that it is more important that
the faculty actually talks about it
first, "It is more likely at a faculty
meeting that we'd talk about sex
than we'd talk about grade inflation
— it's really that taboo," she said.

112 M hroughout her
M academic career,
M Stanford Geology
M Prof. Gail Ma
hood has been
well-known for delving into volca
noes in far-flung parts of the world.
However, over the past year Ma
hood was thrown into another melt
ing pot. As chair for the Faculty Sen
ate Committee on Academic Ap
praisal and Achievement, she led the
crusade to change the grading sys
tem, a campaign which culminated
June 2 when the Faculty Senate
voted 38-3 to institute a new grading
system almost identical to that pro
posed by Mahood's committee.
The grading-policy debate also
cast Mahood into a media cauldron.
Over the course of the grading-policy
debate at Stanford, Mahood and the
policy she created were the subject of
vast amounts of media attention.
Publications as varied as Time,
the Economist and the Walla
Walla (Wash.) Daily Bulletin ran sto
ries about the policy which Mahood
had done much to shape.
Yet now that the dust has settled
and the media has stopped knocking
at her door, Mahood has had time to
reflect on the new grading policy, the
development of which at times liter
ally became a "full-time" job.
I think that even if we hadn't had
the charge from the senate (to change
the policy) then we would have done
something similar because there was
a general feeling that Stanford's
grading policy had facts about it that
we didn't like.
ahood's involvement
in the grading-policy
112 MMM debate began in Nov.
112 1992, when she as-
W sumed the chair of
J the Committee on Academic Ap
praisal and Achievement.
The committee, charged to exam
ine whether there should be any
changes in grading practices at Stan
ford, was formed to address the wor
ries of some senators that the pre
sent system gave students "paradox
ical incentives for strange behav
iors" involving their classwork, said
Mahood.
Following the senate's charge,
the committee spent most of winter
and spring discussing the issue and
designing a survey in order to gain
feedback on the issue from faculty.
"The main (reason for the survey)
was to find out whether people want
ed a grading policy that produced a
transcript that was, what we eu
phemistically call, a 'record of
achievement' which only records the
positive outcomes that a student
has, versus a 'historical record'
which will record all course activi
ties," she said.
The result of the surveys — 75
percent of the faculty who expressed
an opinion wanted a transcript that
was a "historical record" — gave Ma
hood a clear go-ahead to draw up a
proposal for a new grading policy,
she said.
This April, Mahood's committee

presented the finished proposal to
the full senate. After a month of
campus debate, the grading-policy
process finally culminated with the
June 2 senate vote, and the policy
will go into effect for the 1995-96
school year.
The new policy will include
stricter add/drop deadlines, more re
strictive rules on retaking courses,
and brings back the failing grade,
not been given at Stanford for the
last 24 years.
A lot of why I felt so strongly about
[changing the policy] comes down to
a very strong-rooted sense of fairness
and equity.
jA ahood stated that
there were a plethora
112 MfR of reasons why she
M Ww felt changes to the
r current grading poli
cy were necessary. One of most
pressing such motivations, Mahood
said, involved the current retake pol
icy for classes.
"The system we had," she said,
"put certain (social) classes of stu
dents at a disadvantage."
She explained that if two Stan
ford students with the same grades
were applying to medical school, the
transcript failed to show that the
student from the poorer family may
have to work at a job 10 hours a week
and didn't have the time to retake a
lot of courses that the wealthier stu
dent, who didn't have to work, did.
"That really bugs me about the
system, that someone looking at
their transcripts would have no way
of knowing the difference," she said.
"I really feel strongly that Stanford
should do the best to have a system
that does not put at disadvantage
those students that don't come from
wealthy families."
Although Mahood said that the
committee "assumed" that employ
ers and graduate schools would want
more information in a form of a more
"historical transcript," she said that
she "utterly rejects the cynical view"
that the committee was trying to
"salvage Stanford's reputation" by
making the changes.
"I personally was not motivated
by what people thought on the out
side ... I was much more motivated
by what I thought would be a better
system to get students to engage
more seriously in their academic and
intellectual lives here," she main
tained.
Mahood denied that bringing
back the F grade was a primary con
cern of faculty members, but instead
said that faculty expressed a desire
to return to more "central" grading
policy than that which was in effect.
"There were general reasons for
wanting to change the grading policy
(in 1970, the last year in which thd
system was overhauled) to make
things more flexible and to encour
age students to explore more, she
said, "But in my view 1 think they
overstepped the mark."
Since the massive changes to the
grading policy which occurred in
1970, she explained, there has been

"incremental changes" back to the
old system. "(In 1970) they got rid of
the D and the F and then they got rid
of plus and minus modifiers. Then
pretty soon plus and minus modi
fiers came back and then the D grade
came back so what you saw was this
kind of back-pedaling from that posi
tion."
Mahood attributes this slow
movement to the fact that many fac
ulty members thought that the grad
ing policy in the '70s was too much
like a "record of achievement" than
they were comfortable with.
"I think that basically the
changes been made now are in line
with that — we're basically bringing
it back to a more moderate position,"
she said.
Although she stated that Stan
ford's grading policy is moving back
to the norm for universities, she still
insists, "We're still on the generous
side."
The retake policy was cited by Ma
hood as one aspect of the grading
system heavily in need of re-evalua
tion. She added that the policy lent
itself to manipulation by students.
"I think when you have a set of
rules, they are a set of incentives,
and so if students take advantage of
these rules one shouldn't say they're
being irresponsible or trying to game
the system — they're just using the
rules in a way that's most beneficial
to them," she explained. "We want a
system that puts the incentives in
the right place."
Mahood said that she was "horri
fied" by some e-mail messages that
she received concerning the new
grading policy. In some, Mahood
stated, students had written, "the
only reason I came to Stanford was
because of the grading system."
Her reply: "What about the palm
trees?"
Mahood also sees further benefits
to students from the new policy. She
said that she hopes the new policy
will force students to choose their
classes more carefully, concentrate
their efforts on fewer classes and
manage their time better to avoid
getting into situations where they
become so over-extended that their
coursework suffers.
"The system we had before gave
people lots of outs for lack of plan
ning — there won't be so many any
more," she said.
Students should realize that
when they 're leaving with a B it's not
just a B, it's a B from Stanford,
which is worth a lot.
everal aspects of the
new grading system
have come under fire
by professors and stu
dents alike. Some
see the changes as part of
a larger effort to combat what they
consider the illusory problem of
grade inflation.
In this vein, former Assoc. Prof, of
Communication Jeremy Cohen re
cently said, "faculty cynicism is ap
parent in the desperate need to rein
state the F grade... if an A indicates

by /}e /VlatshalL

b\f Dlncent -He

superior work and superior work in
dicates mastery of the subject then
one-third of my students are A stu
dents."
In response to this comment, Ma
hood said that she thinks he is
"right-on" in his assessment that a
third of his students deserve A
grades but that that's not what the
distribution of grades is showing.
"If the median is an A-minus that
means that 50 percent of grades are
A-minus and above and 50 percent of
grades are A-minus or below . . .that
means that A doesn't mean excel
lent; it means something else." Ma
hood said.
Also, Mahood totally disagrees
that there is any "cynicism" on the
part of the faculty because she "sim
ply doesn't believe" that, in language
courses for example, the distribution
of students receiving A's represents
the number that actually "deserve to
receive A's."
She also was quick to respond to
Cohen's point that Stanford stu
dents' high grades are merely a con
tinuation of their high-achieving
high-school years.
"If that's the reasoning, then why
bother gradingthem at all," she said.
"If we were to rank [students] on a
national scale maybe most of them
would be getting A's, but this is
Stanford."
In addition to other faculty skep
tics such as Cohen, not every senator
favored the proposal. Three Faculty
Senate members, including English
Dept. Chair Ron Rebholtz, voted
against the policy.
In the June 2 discussion which
preceded the vote, Rebholtz said he
disagreed with the underlying phi
losophy that the "record of achieve
ment" was not adequate. "I see no
reason why we are in this punitive
mode, which is essentially what most
of the body is in. We are branding our
students," he said.
In response, Mahood said that she
doesn't think that there was any evi
dence that the faculty was in a "puni
tive mode" and that "Ron was being
a little overly dramatic."
"The fact of the matter is, so few F
grades were given when we had them
before so it's really a non-issue... if
the faculty didn't like to give C's and
almost none gave D's then there's no
reason to believe that suddenly the
faculty will be giving lots of F's," she
said.
"Bringing back failing grades
wasn't the big issue [for students],
the big issue was about drop dates
and that's where the impact lies on
the students," she added.
Mahood said that she does not
"buy" the argument that the new
policy will discourage "academic
exploration" and "take away the
flexibility that Stanford is known
for."
"Basically we have plenty of
things in place that allow students to
explore; we have the satisfactory/no
credit grade so students can sign up
for courses without jeopardizing
their G.P.A. and we still allow stu
dents to drop courses up until the
end of the fourth week, which I be

lieve is enough time to make their
decisions," she explained.
Although she is ready to agree
that the change in the drop-dead
lines was the main bone of con
tention for students, she said she
doesn't believe it could be resolved
because the students' position and
the faculty's position were "philo
sophically different."
"Faculty felt that students should
be making their choices based on
whether something was interesting
or well-taught and not based on
what grade they would get... if you
put it [the drop date] at three weeks
it's plenty of time to know whether

dicates mastery of the subject then
one-third of my students are A stu
dents."
In response to this comment, Ma
hood said that she thinks he is
"right-on" in his assessment that a
third of his students deserve A
grades but that that's not what the
distribution of grades is showing.
"If the median is an A-minus that
means that 50 percent of grades are
A-minus and above and 50 percent of
grades are A-minus or below . . .that
means that A doesn't mean excel
lent; it means something else." Ma
hood said.
Also, Mahood totally disagrees
that there is any "cynicism" on the
part of the faculty because she "sim
ply doesn't believe" that, in language
courses for example, the distribution
of students receiving A's represents
the number that actually "deserve to
receive A's."
She also was quick to respond to
Cohen's point that Stanford stu
dents' high grades are merely a con
tinuation of their high-achieving
high-school years.
"If that's the reasoning, then why
bother gradingthem at all," she said.
"If we were to rank [students] on a
national scale maybe most of them
would be getting A's, but this is
Stanford."
In addition to other faculty skep
tics such as Cohen, not every senator
favored the proposal. Three Faculty
Senate members, including English
Dept. Chair Ron Rebholtz, voted
against the policy.
In the June 2 discussion which
preceded the vote, Rebholtz said he
disagreed with the underlying phi
losophy that the "record of achieve
ment" was not adequate. "I see no
reason why we are in this punitive
mode, which is essentially what most
of the body is in. We are branding our
students," he said.
In response, Mahood said that she
doesn't think that there was any evi
dence that the faculty was in a "puni
tive mode" and that "Ron was being
a little overly dramatic."
"The fact of the matter is, so few F
grades were given when we had them
before so it's really a non-issue... if
the faculty didn't like to give C's and
almost none gave D's then there's no
reason to believe that suddenly the
faculty will be giving lots of F's," she
said.
"Bringing back failing grades
wasn't the big issue [for students],
the big issue was about drop dates
and that's where the impact lies on
the students," she added.
Mahood said that she does not
"buy" the argument that the new
policy will discourage "academic
exploration" and "take away the
flexibility that Stanford is known
for."
"Basically we have plenty of
things in place that allow students to
explore; we have the satisfactory/no
credit grade so students can sign up
for courses without jeopardizing
their G.P.A. and we still allow stu
dents to drop courses up until the
end of the fourth week, which I be

lieve is enough time to make their
decisions," she explained.
Although she is ready to agree
that the change in the drop-dead
lines was the main bone of con
tention for students, she said she
doesn't believe it could be resolved
because the students' position and
the faculty's position were "philo
sophically different."
"Faculty felt that students should
be making their choices based on
whether something was interesting
or well-taught and not based on
what grade they would get... if you
put it [the drop date] at three weeks
it's plenty of time to know whether
the course is suitable but if you need
to know how you're going to do then
it's got to be the seventh week," she
explained.
All told, Mahood believes that
many of the students' and faculty's
complaints are much ado about
nothing. "Students have portrayed
this [grading policy change] as being
very serious and severe and dracon
ian but actually ifyou look at our pol
icy compared with most schools we
still have one of the most generous
drop dates of any of our competitors
and our retake policy is still the most
generous."
I was totally taken by surprise, for
the first week after the senate adopt
ed it [grading policy] I was on the
telephone all day talking to people
.. . many of us are trained to be good
scientists but you don't learn to be a
media star. Once 1 ended up on a
radio program without even realiz

n retrospect Mahood
112 Wsaid that she is not
m M surprised by the level
of media coverage de
voted to the develop
ment of the new grading policy, espe
cially with it all "happening around
graduation time when colleges are
on peoples minds."
She admits that she would get a
little annoyed by remarks from the
press media like, "last week the
school [Stanford] turned its back on
slacker-friendly grading and rein
stated a failing grade," a comment
found within the June 13 issue of
Time.
"I would say, hey look, we're
changing that, don't ding us for
something we did in the past."
But she believes that the media is
tempted to "beat up" on higher edu
cation because of an "anti-intellectu
al climate" in the U.S. at the mo
ment.
"Its also tempting to [attack]
Stanford because it's a private insti
tution and it's on the 'laid-back'
West Coast ... the fact of it is that
we are in the forefront of many dif
ferent issues and we tend to conduct
our business more in public than
other campuses," she explained.
However Mahood was concerned
about the media's attention to Stan
ford's median grade being an A
minus because she said that in the
natural sciences and engineering B
and C grades are quite common.

"I would try to point out to them
that the median grade [encompasses
the entire University] and it is im
portant to recognize that the grade
distribution across the campus is
very different ... I wouldn't want
our natural sciences and engineering
to be put at a disadvantage because
B's in natural sciences and engineer
ing are perfectly fine," she said.
But denied that she believes hu
manities courses are easier, solely
because students in the humanities
are getting higher grades.
"I don't think it's so much that
it's easier, it's just that those faculty
apparently have different ways of
viewing the way grades should be
employed. . . also I think that funda
mentally the material you use for
grading in the sciences such as prob
lem sets makes it much easier for a
faculty member to justify a specific
grade whereas it's much harder to do
that say for an English literature
paper."
I think that grade inflation truly
is a problem ... it makes it harder
and harder to identify and reward
truly outstanding students and sec
ondly it leads to a stage where tran
scripts are not terribly useful for
graduate schools because then the
decision is more based on who the
student can get to write a recommen
dation and not on the students' per
formance.
JU ccording to Mahood, the
primary purpose of the
recent changes to the
grading policy was to ef-
W ™ feet a more accurate
''historical transcript" and not to
combat grade inflation. However,
she hopes that the Faculty Senate —
and incoming CAAA chair Van Har
vey, a professor of religious studies
— will address the latter subject next
year.
"The part I'm more concerned
about [in addressing grade infla
tion], which I hope the CAAA will ad
dress next year, is the large differ
ences in the way we grade in the sci
ences and engineering and the way
they grade in the humanities ... I
think that's really a problem because
it means we're not speaking the
same language."
Mahood added that if this is the
case, a possible solution would be
to eliminate grades altogether and
have instructors write one-on-one
evaluations of students. However,
she quickly pointed out that this
method of assessing students' per
formance would not be feasible
with large classes like those typi
cal in chemistry or physics, where
instructors' "contact with stu
dents is just not sufficient," she
said.
Mahood said that the faculty are
"nowhere near" making any policy
suggestions to solve grade inflation
and that it is more important that
the faculty actually talks about it
first, "It is more likely at a faculty
meeting that we'd talk about sex
than we'd talk about grade inflation
— it's really that taboo," she said.

112 M hroughout her
M academic career,
M Stanford Geology
M Prof. Gail Ma
hood has been
well-known for delving into volca
noes in far-flung parts of the world.
However, over the past year Ma
hood was thrown into another melt
ing pot. As chair for the Faculty Sen
ate Committee on Academic Ap
praisal and Achievement, she led the
crusade to change the grading sys
tem, a campaign which culminated
June 2 when the Faculty Senate
voted 38-3 to institute a new grading
system almost identical to that pro
posed by Mahood's committee.
The grading-policy debate also
cast Mahood into a media cauldron.
Over the course of the grading-policy
debate at Stanford, Mahood and the
policy she created were the subject of
vast amounts of media attention.
Publications as varied as Time,
the Economist and the Walla
Walla (Wash.) Daily Bulletin ran sto
ries about the policy which Mahood
had done much to shape.
Yet now that the dust has settled
and the media has stopped knocking
at her door, Mahood has had time to
reflect on the new grading policy, the
development of which at times liter
ally became a "full-time" job.
I think that even if we hadn't had
the charge from the senate (to change
the policy) then we would have done
something similar because there was
a general feeling that Stanford's
grading policy had facts about it that
we didn't like.
ahood's involvement
in the grading-policy
112 MMM debate began in Nov.
112 1992, when she as-
W sumed the chair of
J the Committee on Academic Ap
praisal and Achievement.
The committee, charged to exam
ine whether there should be any
changes in grading practices at Stan
ford, was formed to address the wor
ries of some senators that the pre
sent system gave students "paradox
ical incentives for strange behav
iors" involving their classwork, said
Mahood.
Following the senate's charge,
the committee spent most of winter
and spring discussing the issue and
designing a survey in order to gain
feedback on the issue from faculty.
"The main (reason for the survey)
was to find out whether people want
ed a grading policy that produced a
transcript that was, what we eu
phemistically call, a 'record of
achievement' which only records the
positive outcomes that a student
has, versus a 'historical record'
which will record all course activi
ties," she said.
The result of the surveys — 75
percent of the faculty who expressed
an opinion wanted a transcript that
was a "historical record" — gave Ma
hood a clear go-ahead to draw up a
proposal for a new grading policy,
she said.
This April, Mahood's committee

presented the finished proposal to
the full senate. After a month of
campus debate, the grading-policy
process finally culminated with the
June 2 senate vote, and the policy
will go into effect for the 1995-96
school year.
The new policy will include
stricter add/drop deadlines, more re
strictive rules on retaking courses,
and brings back the failing grade,
not been given at Stanford for the
last 24 years.
A lot of why I felt so strongly about
[changing the policy] comes down to
a very strong-rooted sense of fairness
and equity.
jA ahood stated that
there were a plethora
112 MfR of reasons why she
M Ww felt changes to the
r current grading poli
cy were necessary. One of most
pressing such motivations, Mahood
said, involved the current retake pol
icy for classes.
"The system we had," she said,
"put certain (social) classes of stu
dents at a disadvantage."
She explained that if two Stan
ford students with the same grades
were applying to medical school, the
transcript failed to show that the
student from the poorer family may
have to work at a job 10 hours a week
and didn't have the time to retake a
lot of courses that the wealthier stu
dent, who didn't have to work, did.
"That really bugs me about the
system, that someone looking at
their transcripts would have no way
of knowing the difference," she said.
"I really feel strongly that Stanford
should do the best to have a system
that does not put at disadvantage
those students that don't come from
wealthy families."
Although Mahood said that the
committee "assumed" that employ
ers and graduate schools would want
more information in a form of a more
"historical transcript," she said that
she "utterly rejects the cynical view"
that the committee was trying to
"salvage Stanford's reputation" by
making the changes.
"I personally was not motivated
by what people thought on the out
side ... I was much more motivated
by what I thought would be a better
system to get students to engage
more seriously in their academic and
intellectual lives here," she main
tained.
Mahood denied that bringing
back the F grade was a primary con
cern of faculty members, but instead
said that faculty expressed a desire
to return to more "central" grading
policy than that which was in effect.
"There were general reasons for
wanting to change the grading policy
(in 1970, the last year in which thd
system was overhauled) to make
things more flexible and to encour
age students to explore more, she
said, "But in my view 1 think they
overstepped the mark."
Since the massive changes to the
grading policy which occurred in
1970, she explained, there has been

"incremental changes" back to the
old system. "(In 1970) they got rid of
the D and the F and then they got rid
of plus and minus modifiers. Then
pretty soon plus and minus modi
fiers came back and then the D grade
came back so what you saw was this
kind of back-pedaling from that posi
tion."
Mahood attributes this slow
movement to the fact that many fac
ulty members thought that the grad
ing policy in the '70s was too much
like a "record of achievement" than
they were comfortable with.
"I think that basically the
changes been made now are in line
with that — we're basically bringing
it back to a more moderate position,"
she said.
Although she stated that Stan
ford's grading policy is moving back
to the norm for universities, she still
insists, "We're still on the generous
side."
The retake policy was cited by Ma
hood as one aspect of the grading
system heavily in need of re-evalua
tion. She added that the policy lent
itself to manipulation by students.
"I think when you have a set of
rules, they are a set of incentives,
and so if students take advantage of
these rules one shouldn't say they're
being irresponsible or trying to game
the system — they're just using the
rules in a way that's most beneficial
to them," she explained. "We want a
system that puts the incentives in
the right place."
Mahood said that she was "horri
fied" by some e-mail messages that
she received concerning the new
grading policy. In some, Mahood
stated, students had written, "the
only reason I came to Stanford was
because of the grading system."
Her reply: "What about the palm
trees?"
Mahood also sees further benefits
to students from the new policy. She
said that she hopes the new policy
will force students to choose their
classes more carefully, concentrate
their efforts on fewer classes and
manage their time better to avoid
getting into situations where they
become so over-extended that their
coursework suffers.
"The system we had before gave
people lots of outs for lack of plan
ning — there won't be so many any
more," she said.
Students should realize that
when they 're leaving with a B it's not
just a B, it's a B from Stanford,
which is worth a lot.
everal aspects of the
new grading system
have come under fire
by professors and stu
dents alike. Some
see the changes as part of
a larger effort to combat what they
consider the illusory problem of
grade inflation.
In this vein, former Assoc. Prof, of
Communication Jeremy Cohen re
cently said, "faculty cynicism is ap
parent in the desperate need to rein
state the F grade... if an A indicates

In response to this comment, Ma

grades but that that's not what the

"If the median is an A-minus that
