## New beginnings The
						Lucile Packard Children's Hospital Rehabilitation Engineering center, the west Coast's first myoelectric limb bank, is helping to make the lives of children born with arm deficiencies brighter and lighter.

Andres Alvarez will be throwing
out the first pitch in an upcoming
Oakland Athletics game.
This would be a once-in-a-lifetime
event for any 10-year-old child, but it is
especially meaningful considering that
Andres was born without a right hand.
However, Andres' tale was the first of
what will be many success stories to be
produced by the Lucile Packard Chil
dren's Hospital Rehabilitation Engineer
ing Center, when he received his new,
life-like hand from the West Coast's first
children's myoelectric limb bank.
The project was able to get off the
ground thanks in large part to a $25,000
check from the Inner Wheel U.S.A. foun
dation, a group comprised of wives and
widows of members of Rotary Interna
tional.
Marianne Shearer, chair of Inner
Wheel, explained that the members de-

cided to estab
lish a founda
tion to support
a charitable
project, while
"bringing the
members closer
together."
Several dif
ferent project
ideas were dis
cussed, but the
group elected
to adopt the
limb bank to
help children
obtain the myo
electric pros
theses they so
eagerly await.
In explain
ing her group's
choice, Shearer
said, "They're
the kids who
fall through
the cracks.
Everybody's
helping on the
big problems."
Shearer was
referring to the
fact that be
cause relatively
few children
are born with
missing limbs,
the cause re
ceives minimal
monetary sup
port from the
government.
Shearer
added, "When
we first heard

'myoelectric' we didn't know what it was,
couldn't pronounce it, and couldn't spell
it."
Myoelectric: an explanation
Every year in California approximately 50
children are born with arm deficiencies
which require prosthesis. Several others
also need new limbs because of severe in
juries incurred at some point during their
childhood, leading them to need new, artifi
cial limbs prosthesis.
There are currently two types of pros
thesis: body-powered and myoelectric.
A body-powered prosthesis requires the
subject to wear a harness around their

shoulders. Various upper body movements
(i.e. shrugging one's shoulders) place ten
sion on a cable, which runs the length of the
prosthetic arm, and manipulates the claw
like mechanism, or "hand," to open and
close.
The myoelectric prosthesis, first devel
oped about 15 years ago, is less technical
and less physically limiting.
Scientific breakthroughs allowed the
subject to have even more freedom but
without the external cables. When a muscle
contracts, an electrical signal is given off by
the body's nerves. Surface electrodes pick
up the electrical signal, which is then am
plified and processed to activate the "hand"
to open and close.
Besides being easier for the patient to
use, the myoelectric limb is also more aes
thetically pleasing. The electrodes do not
protrude through clothing like cables do,
and, as a result, the patient feels less self-

conscious and more confident.
Although there is no dispute that the
myoelectric model is superior to the body
powered, many still wear the conventional
type because the myoelectric limb is so ex
pensive.
A below-the-elbow myoelectric prosthe
sis for a child can cost between $10,000 to
$13,000 initially. As a child ages, however,
the limb usually must be replaced to accom
modate growth, thereby generating more
expenses.
However, the problem for many patients
is that most insurance companies, includ
ing California Children Services, will not
cover the cost of receiving a prosthesis.

Even the more generous coverage only cov
ers the cost of one limb.
Thus, for the past two decades myoelec
tric prosthesis has been reserved for the
wealthy and the privileged, because those in
need, without other means of payment,
could not afford the new limbs.
Fortunately, the new myoelectric limb
bank brings the dream of having a myoelec
tric prosthesis one step closer.
The new program
Lynn Dunbar is a certified prosthetist at
the Lucile Salter Packard Children's Hospi
tal at Stanford.
Dunbar, who designs the limbs and then
properly fits them to the children, described
her job as "very rewarding."
"In the last few years the limbs are more
functional, more life-like — it's nice to be
able to offer them to people."
The new limb bank will ensure that this

opportunity is extended to the maximum
number of people through its new method
of "recycling" the prostheses.
"The neat thing about the limb bank is
that the limbs are reused. As a child out
grows his hand, the limb is returned and he
is given the next size," Dunbar said.
Children can receive their first artificial
limb as young as six months when they
start to wear a "passive hand" — for sitting,
crawling and to prepare them for future
prostheses.
"At one-and-a-half we [then] fit them
with myoelectric prostheses," Dunbar said.
As the child grows the limbs are then
"traded in" for models that properly fit,

while the outgrown limb can be used by an
other patient.
Dunbar added that not only will this re
veling of limbs "save a lot of money," but it
will enable more people to participate in the
process. The limb bank will operate to help
children from birth until they reach 21
years of age.
The recycling system allows families to
continue with myoelectric prosthesis at no
additional cost after the first limb is paid
for.
Within the first year, Dunbar said they
"hope to see 10 to 12 kids" at the new Chil
dren's Hospital site, and eventually Inner
Wheel hopes to expand to a national pro
gram, with one center on the East Coast
and one in the Midwest.
A dream come true
Alvarez, a 10-year-old from Santa Cruz,
was the first beneficiary of the bank. Previ-

ously, Andres
had a body
powered pros
thesis.
Though
such a limb
was better
than none, An
dres described
it as heavy and
cumbersome.
But Andres
expressed
great enthusi
asm after he
received his
new, one
pound myo
electric pros
thesis. "It
looks more like
a real hand,
and I have a
better grip,"
he said.
Andres'
mother, Nora,
explained that
the new pros
thesis has had
a tremendous
impact on her
son's life.
"When An
dres was in
kindergarten,
and the kids
were using
their fingers
in counting
games and
songs, Andres
came home one
day and asked
me, 'Mom,

what's it like to have two hands and 10 fin
gers?' He adjusted but didn't participate a
lot in those exercises. When he saw the
new myoelectric prosthesis he smiled so
big. He tried it on, and I asked him, 'So
how does it feel to have two hands and 10
fingers?' "
Andres and his success story have gen
erated a lot of interest in the Bay Area for
the new limb center, and some have chosen
to get involved with Andres personally.
However, even the thrill that Alvarez
will receive throwing that first pitch in an
upcoming baseball game will likely pale in
comparison to the thrill of using his new
hand.
