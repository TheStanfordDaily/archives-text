# Managing the Risks of Nature
## Stanford faculty and graduates push the limits of natural disaster research and preparedness

Chris Austin loans forward in his
chair, happily intent upon the
computer he is using for a disas
ter simulation. He clicks the cursor
on the symbol of a lightning bolt,
and selects "earthquake" from the
menu that appears. His gaze never
leaves the screen as he clicks on yet
another symbol, a small world
globe.
Austin, a civil engineer at Menlo
Park's Risk Management Solutions
(RMS), Inc. plays with computer
simulations to predict insurance
losses. He currently works with
earthquakes and hurricanes, but the
company hopes to expand to include
tornadoes, hail, floods and rain —
any disaster covered by the nation's
insurance industry. Striving to be
come the masters of disasters,
Austin and his co-workers tire cheer
ful about natural catastrophes.
"I'm not saying we want them to
occur," says Austin, "but if they hap
pen, it's exciting. Everyone wants to
go be a snoop, to see what happened
to all the buildings and what's stand
ing and what's not and why."
Austin is not ghoulish, just im
mersed in his job at RMS. The com
pany started in 1988 as an out
growth of research done at Stan
ford's Blume Engineering Center.
Austin, a 1993 Stanford graduate,
estimates that 75 percent of the
company's 120 employees are from
Stanford. Haresh Shah, chair of the
Civil Engineering Department, is
on the board of directors at RMS.
Both Austin and Shah are en
thusiastic about the use of comput
ers to predict earthquake damages,
although the disasters displayed on
their glowing screens can be grim.
According to Shah, a modern, day
time repetition of the 1906 San
Francisco earthquake would cause
damages from $100 billion to $180
billion.
A Tokyo earthquake measuring
7.8 on the Richter scale, occurring

at 4 p.m. on a dry, windy day, would
cost $1.5 trillion to $2 trillion in
damages. In comparison, the
Northridge earthquake in January
was the most expensive in United
States history, Shah said, with $20
billion to $30 billion in damages.
Fast-growing populations in
earthquake areas plus inadequate
building techniques have increased
the potential for disaster, says
Shah. Now, computers allow insur
ance companies to pinpoint high
risk areas and poor building con
struction, telling them where to
raise rates. Shah suggests that the
high cost of insurance may be the
"carrot and stick" that force the use
of earthquake-minimizing con
struction techniques.
Quake damage is minimized by
using flexible materials such as
wood and steel rather than unstable
brick, masonry or concrete. Con
nections — where the foundation is
bolted to the frame or where walls
and roof meet — should be strong
enough to withstand violent jolts.
And "soft story" construction — in
which the bottom floor of a multi
story building is supported on
columns — require reinforcing
walls.
If owners cannot insure a piece of
property, says Shah, they will up
grade the construction. He predict
ed a 20-year cycle for insurance
companies to affect the standards of
builders, engineers and architects.
"If I'm an architect and you're
an engineer on a project, and our
property can not be insured, then
next time the owners will not come
to us," Shah said. "They will say,
'you're a bunch of bozos who do not
know how to build. It takes a long
time for this cycle to be complete,
but it is a very good way for long
term protection from earth
quakes."
Without this spur from insur
ance companies, Shah believes eco-

nomic pressure will continue to pre
vent the use of earthquake-mini
mizing techniques on new buildings
and updates of existing structures.
The technological advances from 50
years of earthquake research can
not solve the problem alone.
"It's not practical," says Shah.
"There isn't enough money,
enough resources, enough will to
implement the current knowledge.
So with all the wonderful things
that are going on around the world,
it's terrible to see that every earth
quake brings more death and more
economic losses."
To predict these losses, RMS pro
duces the Investment Risk Assess
ment System, a computer program
which analyzes information from
several databases. Austin is enthu
siastic about the capabilities of
IRAS.
"The overall idea is to help insur
ance companies estimate what their
losses could be. I think they use it
mostly to price and to figure out
how much money they should save
so that when a big earthquake
comes they can afford to pay it and
not go bankrupt."
Fear of bankruptcy has led the
five largest insurance companies in
California to stop issuing new
homeowners' policies. The Los An
geles Times reported on July 6 that
rebuilding after the Northridge
earthquake will cost more than in
surance companies had originally
estimated.
Besides predicting possible costs,
IRAS is a useful tool alter a disaster
occurs says Austin. An insurance
company can quickly determine
where to send claims adjusters —
even before the policyholders can
call.
Increased efficiency is possible
because the IRAS software is based
on what is known as a geographic
information system. Using the rela
tively new GIS technology, complex

maps and data can be combined in
layers of interactive information.
"If you had two maps that had
land, and one had land use and one
had land price, you could merge
them together and come out with a
database that had both the use and
the price," Austin said. "Before, you
couldn't do that."
During a demonstration, Austin
showed how the IRAS system
works. After receiving an address,
IRAS uses GIS data to determine
latitude and longitude, nearness to
known earthquake faults, struc
tures in the area, and soil conditions.
Next, the program asks a series of
questions about the property.
"These are all yes/no, highymedi
um/low type answers," Austin ex
plained. "We try to keep it simple for
the insurance person using it."
With the data entered, IRAS can
then earthquake simulations, from
which a list ranking the probabili
ties and costs of possible losses can
be generated.
"The worst case is 8.3 on the San
Andreas," Austin said cheerfully.
"Your house is four miles from the
fault. They expect an 8.3 on the San
Andreas every 750 years or so.
When that happens, 12 percent, 13
percent of your building is going to
be destroyed."
Properties can be entered one at a
time, or a large database can be
dumped into the system and evalu
ated. IRAS is used by insurance
companies, re-insurance companies
(who write policies covering large
losses by insurance companies), and
mortgage brokers. These clients
lease the program from RMS. A one
year lease for a single computer
costs approximately $35,000.
Currently, few have access to
IRAS, but mortgage companies
have proposed making the system
part of the loan process. Planning is
tentative, but RMS stafT hope that
within a vear, home buvers will be

able to use IRAS to check potential
homes. And when that happens,
Austin believes that easily available
information about soil conditions
and earthquake risks may have
some affect on resale values as well
as insurance costs.
RMS is one of three companies
that have adapted the highly com
plex GIS technology to the insur
ance industry. EQE International,
Inc., of San Francisco and Applied
Insurance Research, Inc., of Boston
also produce software to calculate
disaster probabilities.
The ability to predict damages
from a quake is of particular impor
tance to everyone at Stanford, Shah
said, because of the University's
unique location.
"Our campus has the distinction
of having one of the most active
faults on this planet," explains
Shah, referring to the San Andreas
fault. "As a matter of fact, we al
ways kid with our friends at Berke
ley. They also have a fault which
crosses their stadium, but their
fault is a lot smaller than ours."
All joking aside, Shah cites a re
cent prediction of a 90 percent
chance of a major Bay Area quake
within the next 30 years. If such a
quake does occur, it will have a dev
astating effect on the heavily popu
lated areas surrounding campus.
This is where the IRAS program
may have a positive, long-term ef
fect.
And while, use of IRAS and simi
lar programs will probably increase
insurance premiums, in the long
run, Shah feels that, it will also help
to improve building practices over
time.
Hence, Austin's work with com
puters at RMS might indirectly de
crease earthquake damages. What
ever the outcome, Austin enjoys the
challenge of his unique job.
"It's different," he said. "There's

Well on their way to becoming masters of disaster," Stanford graduate Chris Austin and civil engineer
ing professor Haresh Shah are certain that computer research is one of the most effective ways to studv
the possible after effects of natural disasters like earthquakes.
