## Sports camp scores big with kids, counselors 
### Kyle Utsumi Editorial staff 
Kids. Sun. Sports. Fun.
These four words best embody
the spirit of the Stanford Summer
All-Sports Camp. Currently in its
15th year, the all-sports camp fea
tures kids — lots of kids, ages 7-11
— enjoying themselves during

every minute of their camp ses
sion.
On Roble Field, where the
campers frolic, everyone has a ball,
including the counselors, most of
whom are involved in Stanford
athletics on either varsity or club
teams. While all of these Cardinal
athletes have a love for sports, they
also share a love for teaching

young children.
The program has featured sev
eral well-known Stanford stars,
such as basketball players Kenny
Hicks and Bobbie Kelsey. Yet sheer
athletic talent is not enough to be
hired as a counselor by Shirley
Shoof, who has been the camp's di
rector from its beginning.
"We've turned down some pre

mier athletes," said Shoof, who is
Stanford's assistant athletic direc
tor for educational and recreation
al programs. "If they don't love
kids, they don't have what this
camp needs."
The current staff is composed of
athletes from Stanford's soccer, ul
timate frisbee, karate, ice hockey,
field hockey, lacrosse, volleyball
and water polo teams.
Cardinal athletes have not al
ways been the primary source of
Schoofs staff. "When we started,
all the counselors were Stanford
students in the STEP program for
physical education," she said. "But
many of them were geared toward
secondary education, not primary,
and they had problems with the
young kids. (Laterl, I didn't know
where I would get my counselors,
so I went to coaches and asked for
their athletes."
Since that time, the position has
become one of the most coveted
summer jobs at Stanford. Like
many counselors, Leslie Garrard, a
member of Stanford's women's
soccer squad, chose to work a sec
ond summer for Schoof.
"The kids are fun," Garrard
said. "I like this whole environ
ment — playing sports, teaching
sports and being in the sun."
Garrard, who attended special
ized, single-sport camps as a
youngster, enjoys the variety of ac
tivities offered by the camp. "We
play a lot of different sports here. I
grew up going to soccer camp or
swim camp."
Another counselor, Jeremy
Dobbie, feels that the wacky games
he organizes take him back to his
childhood. "As a kid, I was inter
ested in sports and here we play the
same sports as I did back then."
Dobbie, who participates on
Stanford's ultimate frisbee team,

mentions dodge hall as a favorite
activity. "It's fun to go out and play
dodge ball. Most 20-year-olds don't
do that. It's not really a sport, but
it teaches some fundamentals of
athletics."
The counselors strive to im
press the fundamentals of good
play upon their young campers.
"We work with them on athletic
skills as well as sportsmanship and
teamwork," Dobbie said. "That
suits Stanford athletes very well."
Spending the day with kids who
are full of energy and short on wor
ries takes many of the counselors
back to a time when there was little
or no pressure on them to perform
on the athletic field. Fun is the
name of the game.
"It's nice to be athletic and ac
tive without the pressures of train
ing and the mental stress of trying
to be the best in your individual
sport," Dobbie said.
For the kids, the diversity of ac
tivities seems to be the biggest
thrill. Ben Archer, a seven-year
old from Palo Alto, said he likes
"rotating to the different sports"
best. He has benefited from the ex
pertise of his counselors, naming
lacrosse, which he learned just last
week, as his favorite sport to play.
Another youngster, 10-year-old
Tyson Fletcher, said he likes mak
ing friends and learning new
games. His favorite part of the day?
"Lunchtime. After all the games, I
get tired and I like to rest," he ex
plained.
But minutes later, he and his
friends are back at it, running
around the field led by their camp
counselors. "These counselors
have unlimited energy," Schoof
said. "What makes this successful
is the quality of the counselors and
their enthusiasm and love for
kids."
