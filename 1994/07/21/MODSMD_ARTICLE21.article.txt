# Ex-Stanford star takes swings for U.S.
## 
### Daniel Picker Staff writer 
Former Stanford tennis star
and 1991 NCAA men's singles
champion Jared Palmer teamed
with America's elite tennis play
ers — including top-ranked, two
time Wimbledon champion Pete
Sampras and former No. 1 player
Jim Courier — in a quarterfinal
Davis Cup victory over the
Netherlands this weekend in Rot
terdam.
Palmer, with doubles partner
Richey Reneberg, joined fellow
Floridians Sampras and Courier
in the pursuit of the Davis Cup.
The tennis star won his NCAA
title in 1991 during his sopho
more year and turned pro shortly
afterward. Palmer is currently
ranked 64th in Men's Singles on
the IBM/ATP Tour after winning
his first singles title in May at the
USTA Clay Court Classic in which
he ousted the contest's top two
seeds, Todd Martin and Malivai
Washington.
This year marks Palmer's first
experience with the Davis Cup
format, consisting of four singles
matches and one doubles match
over three days. After the initial
draw, singles opponents on the
first day are reversed on the third
to complete the traditional Davis
Cup match or "tie."
The Dutch team included
huge-serving Richard Krajicek,
along with Jacco Eltingh and Paul
Haarhuis. The latter two mem
bers were the winners of this
year's Australian Open doubles
title. Jan Siemerink rounded out
the team for Holland.
Palmer was selected for the
Davis Cup squad over former
Stanford team members Jonathan
Stark and Patrick McEnroe. The
former Cardinal star has won
three doubles titles this year and

has reached four finals.
In the doubles match this Sat
urday, played on a hardcourt in
bright sun, Palmer and Reneberg
were left tilting at windmills. In a
closely contested match, the rook
ie pair came up short. 2-6, 7-6 (8-
6), 6-3, 6-7 (7-2), 6-2 before 8,000
partisan Dutch fans. With two
sets going to tie-breakers, the duo
did themselves proud against a
veteran Dutch tandem that has
eleven doubles titles under their
belts.
On Friday the U.S. breezed to
a 2-0 lead with easy singles victo
ries by Sampras and Courier.
Krajicek fought back to upset
Sampras 2-6, 7-5, 7-6 (7-5), 7-5 on
Sunday. Courier was left with a
must-win situation on Sunday
and came up victorious over Elt
ingh 6-3,6-4,4-6,6-1 for a 3-2 win
for the United States. The Amer
icans next face Sweden in the
semifinal.
The Davis Cup is an interna
tional competition launched in
1900 by 21-year-old Harvard
graduate Dwight Filley Davis.
That year, Davis and his Harvard
schoolmates defeated the British
Isles 3-0, as the team from Great
Britain was known, during the
first "tie" — a term used for the
competitions — at the Longwood
Cricket Club in Boston. Since
then the United States has gone
on the win the Cup another 29
times.
Another former Stanford
champion and fellow NCAA men's
singles champ, John McEnroe,
holds most U.S. Davis Cup
records.
The mercurial McEnroe
graced the Farm only for his
freshmen year, winning the
NCAA singes title in 1978, before
orchestrating his storied profes
sional career.
The United States has not won

the Davis Cup since a John McEn
roe-led squad defeated Switzer
land 3-1 in 1992. Mac had Andre
Agassi, Sampras and Courier be
side him for that triumph. One
can foresee Jared Palmer and
Stanford continuing the United
States' tradition of Davis Cup
dominance.

In other tennis action this week
end, Alex O'Brien, 1992 men's sin
gles, doubles, and team champion
for Stanford, teamed with San Jose
local and former USC stalwart
Brian McPhie to take the Safeway
Challenger doubles title in Aptos,
6-1, 7-6 over Donnie Isaak and
Michael Roberts.
