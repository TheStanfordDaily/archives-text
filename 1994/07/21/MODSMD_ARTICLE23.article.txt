## IN WITH THE OUT CROUD 
### Aïda Croal 
Two years ago, a couple of Stanford
students had a dream. Well, more
accurately, it was a reverie.
During the spring of 1993,
dramaphiles Alex d'Arbeloff and Krista
Hoepner were sitting in the Coffee
House, talking shop, when they stumbled
upon an idea. What would it look like to
have a summer stock theater Company,
on campus, comprised of an equal num
ber of men and women, that would — get
this — produce exciting, provocative
plays that the community actually want
ed to see, for absolutely free?
Whew. It was a tall order. Especially
since the drama community at Stanford
had only recently seen its first acting-in
tensive curriculum the year before with
the Advanced Performance Workshop.
But energised by that experience, and
propelled by the desire to see drama done
differently at Stanford, d'Arbeloff and
Hoepner set about to make their reverie a
concrete reality.
After securing a $20,000 donation, a
house, and an exceptionally talented cast
of 5 men and 5 women, the "Inside Out
Theater" company was born. During last
year's sweltering summer, the group pro
duced three plays— "Equus," "Twelfth
Night," and "Midsummer Nights
Dream"— which were met by great en
thusiasm and praise.
And now . . . they're baaack.
Equipped with three plays — two
Shakespeare and a Wertenbaker — and
the inverted title "Outside In Theater,"
the gender-balanced team has returned
ten strong, though this time, the shows
are not-so-absolutely free.
While dedicated producers, Erin Noble
and Zander Teller worked frantically on
fundraising over the past year, the two
did not meet their $20,000 dollar goal by
the begjpningof the summer.
Instead of giving up, which they
couldn't quite do because they already
had a cast, the two producers sat the ac
tors down for a meeting after which, the
company decided to go ahead regardless.
"We decided that we would rather scrimp
and scrape and cut u few corners, thun
call it off," said Teller.
But in the tradition of great outdoor
theater groups such as the San Francisco
Mime Troupe, this state of affairs is not
at all unheard of. Such companies, under
constant pressure to earn their daily
bread are quite literally accountable to
their audiences, and must work extra
hard to produce shows that actually mat
ter. And so at the end of each Outside In
production, in order to pay for things like

rent and food, multiple hats are passed
around and the audience is encouraged to
show their appreciation financially as
well as through applause.
Indeed, despite fundraising glitches,
the group is very much in the saddle ai}d
enjoying their outdoor lifestyle. ..For
6ome, the sense of freedom accompany
ing outdoor theater is significant. Be
cause Stanford drama is such an indoor
activity, many dedicated actors like those
involved with Outside In, according to
Teller are "like stale fish," rarely getting
a chance to see the light.
"It's a beautiful campus and it's great
to be able to take advantage of it," said
Teller. "We have people wandering by
while we're practicing who just come up
and ask us what we're doing. A lot of
those people eventually come back and
see our shows."
The more direct contact with the larg
er community has led the company to
wards a different vision of performance
than that practiced by drama depart
ment. "It's making theater as much
about the audience as it is about the cre
ation of the art," says Teller.
"The theater that goes on in the drama
department is more about the intellectual
dissection of the play by the director and
the actors than what I seem to be more in
terested in which is communication."
Teller and other group members are
quick to point out differences between
the drama that is practiced year round,
and the vision being set by the group.
"During the year, [drama] is extra-cur
ricular. Something you do after or
around your classes," said Caroline
Laskow, a junior and member of the com
pany. "But what if your primary objec
tive, with no objections, was theater?"
Laskow quickly answers her own ques
tion. "It's the total theater experience."
"With lOutside In] it's never really
over," she continues. The entire company
lives in the same house. This set up facil
itates long work hours and, more impor
tantly, provides the space for much need
ed artistic experimentation. And since
each show is rehearsed in a scant thirteen
days, Laskow maintains such a turn
around "wouldn't be possible any other
way."

Sarah Cathcart, Jose (Paco) Farias,
Thomas Freeland, Jordan Gelber,
Ross McCall, Kira Snyder, Geoff
Sobelle, Teller, and Tineke Van Bercke
laer are the 10 dynamic members of Out
side In.

It is a living as well as a theater exper
iment. Not new, perhaps, to the theater
world in general, but for these individu
als and for Stanford, the effect is ground
breaking. While much of the energy to
sustain it comes from undergraduate stu
dents, many company members credit
Winter Mead, their artistic director.
Arriving on the scene several years
ago, Mead was hired by the drama de
partment as a visiting lecturer and has
taught courses like the "Advanced Per
formance Workshop," and "Acting
Shakespeare," as well as directed last
spring's Othello.
One of several pioneers in the creation
of the Red Hoop Players <the precursor to
Outside In), and director for most of their
shows, Mead has galvanized a number of
students and provided much needed guid
ance for their innovations.
"He's a powerhouse," said Teller. And
a supportive one at that. A mentor to
Laskow, he invited her to assistant direct
Othello last spring, and this summer, en
couraged her to direct the Outside In per
formance of "Our Country's Good."
Worried that the cast might not take
her seriously in her role as director,
Laskow nevertheless decided to take the
opportunity, with Mead's help. "He did
all the dramaturgy and provided so much
support," said Laskow., "He would total
ly back off if, but was right there when I
needed anything."
As the company looks towards the fu
ture, however, it is not without trepida
tion. The one constant in the Red Hoop
Players and the Outside In companies,
according to Teller, is Mead. And this sit
uation could change. "(Mead) might not
be around because the drama department
won't hire him," says Teller.
In this case, as always, it would be up
to t he new guard to ensure that the com
pany lives on.
Oar Country's Good
Laskow's directorial debut, the play
takes place on an Australian penal colony
in 1788 and dramatizes the plight of eight
convicts and their jailers. In this prison
within a prison, both convict and jailer,
officer and hangman, struggle to main
tain some semblance of dignity, honor,
and humanity, while being forced to suf
fer heaping indignities, and barbarous
treatment.
While remaining true to the historical
period, playwright Timberlake Werten
baker is nevertheless able to infuse tho
unfolding drama with a frighteningly
contemporary set of concerns. Out of her

characters' mouths, spew invectives that
step right into contemporary U.S. dis
course on crime and punishment.
Sometimes seriously, but most times
through humor, Wertenbaker showcases
debates on nature versus nurture and
ideologies of innate criminality; along
side meditations on culture, refinement,
and the nature of the theater through the
British colonial struggle, figuratively and
literally, over the convicts' bodies.
From the haunting beginning of the
play, when the convicts are led on stage
single-file, singing "Amazing Grace," and
one of the convicts is given fifty lashes
with a whip, one is jarred by the fact that
this play is as much about America as it is
about the Australian colony in which it is
set.
At one point, His Excellency, played
by Sonja Kuftinec, motions his officers to
stop shooting at birds, indirectly chiding
them for taking pleasure in killing. After
a moment long philosophical indulgence
on the nature of human potential and
generosity of spirit, he asks for a rifle to
continue their sport.
These hilarious moments are pep
pered throughout the drama, subtly rein
forcing its primary concern: the relation
ship between enlightenment and barbar
ity, and the struggle for freedom.
Director Laskow and the rest of the
Outside In crew are insightful in their in
terpretation of the multi-layered drama.
From the sheer physical detail, to the en
ergy of the cast, the skill and work put
into the show is impressive. The actors,
many of whom are playing two charac
ters, succeed in creating characters that
are distinct, engaging, and compelling to
watch. Some are excessively cruel and
others pathetic. Yet we care about each
one and want them to make it.
On the other hand, attention to detail,
and an over-emphasis on the humorous
aspects of the play at times sacrifice the
larger connections the script is making
between past and present, and fix the
play as a quirky representation of its time
period rather than a universal and affect
ing commentary on the nature of human
bondage.
Despite this limitation, this rendering
of Our Country is entertaining, engaging,
and provocative giving the audience
much food for thought long after the final
bow.

Our Country's Good runs from July 20-
24, In front of Cummings Art Building.
The Tempest, the final production of Out
side In's season, will run from July 28-

But in the tradition of great outdoor
theater groups such as the San Francisco
Mime Troupe, this state of affairs is not
at all unheard of. Such companies, under
constant pressure to earn their daily
bread are quite literally accountable to
their audiences, and must work extra
hard to produce shows that actually mat
ter. And so at the end of each Outside In
production, in order to pay for things like

rent and food, multiple hats are passed
around and the audience is encouraged to
show their appreciation financially as
well as through applause.
Indeed, despite fundraising glitches,
the group is very much in the saddle ai}d
enjoying their outdoor lifestyle. ..For
6ome, the sense of freedom accompany
ing outdoor theater is significant. Be
cause Stanford drama is such an indoor
activity, many dedicated actors like those
involved with Outside In, according to
Teller are "like stale fish," rarely getting
a chance to see the light.
"It's a beautiful campus and it's great
to be able to take advantage of it," said
Teller. "We have people wandering by
while we're practicing who just come up
and ask us what we're doing. A lot of
those people eventually come back and
see our shows."
The more direct contact with the larg
er community has led the company to
wards a different vision of performance
than that practiced by drama depart
ment. "It's making theater as much
about the audience as it is about the cre
ation of the art," says Teller.
"The theater that goes on in the drama
department is more about the intellectual
dissection of the play by the director and
the actors than what I seem to be more in
terested in which is communication."
Teller and other group members are
quick to point out differences between
the drama that is practiced year round,
and the vision being set by the group.
"During the year, [drama] is extra-cur
ricular. Something you do after or
around your classes," said Caroline
Laskow, a junior and member of the com
pany. "But what if your primary objec
tive, with no objections, was theater?"
Laskow quickly answers her own ques
tion. "It's the total theater experience."
"With lOutside In] it's never really
over," she continues. The entire company
lives in the same house. This set up facil
itates long work hours and, more impor
tantly, provides the space for much need
ed artistic experimentation. And since
each show is rehearsed in a scant thirteen
days, Laskow maintains such a turn
around "wouldn't be possible any other
way."

It is a living as well as a theater exper
iment. Not new, perhaps, to the theater
world in general, but for these individu
als and for Stanford, the effect is ground
breaking. While much of the energy to
sustain it comes from undergraduate stu
dents, many company members credit
Winter Mead, their artistic director.
Arriving on the scene several years
ago, Mead was hired by the drama de
partment as a visiting lecturer and has
taught courses like the "Advanced Per
formance Workshop," and "Acting
Shakespeare," as well as directed last
spring's Othello.
One of several pioneers in the creation
of the Red Hoop Players <the precursor to
Outside In), and director for most of their
shows, Mead has galvanized a number of
students and provided much needed guid
ance for their innovations.
"He's a powerhouse," said Teller. And
a supportive one at that. A mentor to
Laskow, he invited her to assistant direct
Othello last spring, and this summer, en
couraged her to direct the Outside In per
formance of "Our Country's Good."
Worried that the cast might not take
her seriously in her role as director,
Laskow nevertheless decided to take the
opportunity, with Mead's help. "He did
all the dramaturgy and provided so much
support," said Laskow., "He would total
ly back off if, but was right there when I
needed anything."
As the company looks towards the fu
ture, however, it is not without trepida
tion. The one constant in the Red Hoop
Players and the Outside In companies,
according to Teller, is Mead. And this sit
uation could change. "(Mead) might not
be around because the drama department
won't hire him," says Teller.
In this case, as always, it would be up
to t he new guard to ensure that the com
pany lives on.
Oar Country's Good
Laskow's directorial debut, the play
takes place on an Australian penal colony
in 1788 and dramatizes the plight of eight
convicts and their jailers. In this prison
within a prison, both convict and jailer,
officer and hangman, struggle to main
tain some semblance of dignity, honor,
and humanity, while being forced to suf
fer heaping indignities, and barbarous
treatment.
While remaining true to the historical
period, playwright Timberlake Werten
baker is nevertheless able to infuse tho
unfolding drama with a frighteningly
contemporary set of concerns. Out of her

characters' mouths, spew invectives that
step right into contemporary U.S. dis
course on crime and punishment.
Sometimes seriously, but most times
through humor, Wertenbaker showcases
debates on nature versus nurture and
ideologies of innate criminality; along
side meditations on culture, refinement,
and the nature of the theater through the
British colonial struggle, figuratively and
literally, over the convicts' bodies.
From the haunting beginning of the
play, when the convicts are led on stage
single-file, singing "Amazing Grace," and
one of the convicts is given fifty lashes
with a whip, one is jarred by the fact that
this play is as much about America as it is
about the Australian colony in which it is
set.
At one point, His Excellency, played
by Sonja Kuftinec, motions his officers to
stop shooting at birds, indirectly chiding
them for taking pleasure in killing. After
a moment long philosophical indulgence
on the nature of human potential and
generosity of spirit, he asks for a rifle to
continue their sport.
These hilarious moments are pep
pered throughout the drama, subtly rein
forcing its primary concern: the relation
ship between enlightenment and barbar
ity, and the struggle for freedom.
Director Laskow and the rest of the
Outside In crew are insightful in their in
terpretation of the multi-layered drama.
From the sheer physical detail, to the en
ergy of the cast, the skill and work put
into the show is impressive. The actors,
many of whom are playing two charac
ters, succeed in creating characters that
are distinct, engaging, and compelling to
watch. Some are excessively cruel and
others pathetic. Yet we care about each
one and want them to make it.
On the other hand, attention to detail,
and an over-emphasis on the humorous
aspects of the play at times sacrifice the
larger connections the script is making
between past and present, and fix the
play as a quirky representation of its time
period rather than a universal and affect
ing commentary on the nature of human
bondage.
Despite this limitation, this rendering
of Our Country is entertaining, engaging,
and provocative giving the audience
much food for thought long after the final
bow.

Our Country's Good runs from July 20-
24, In front of Cummings Art Building.
The Tempest, the final production of Out
side In's season, will run from July 28-

try's Good" by Timberlake Wertenbakerl.
Two years ago, a couple of Stanford
students had a dream. Well, more
accurately, it was a reverie.
During the spring of 1993,
dramaphiles Alex d'Arbeloff and Krista
Hoepner were sitting in the Coffee
House, talking shop, when they stumbled
upon an idea. What would it look like to
have a summer stock theater Company,
on campus, comprised of an equal num
ber of men and women, that would — get
this — produce exciting, provocative
plays that the community actually want
ed to see, for absolutely free?
Whew. It was a tall order. Especially
since the drama community at Stanford
had only recently seen its first acting-in
tensive curriculum the year before with
the Advanced Performance Workshop.
But energised by that experience, and
propelled by the desire to see drama done
differently at Stanford, d'Arbeloff and
Hoepner set about to make their reverie a
concrete reality.
After securing a $20,000 donation, a
house, and an exceptionally talented cast
of 5 men and 5 women, the "Inside Out
Theater" company was born. During last
year's sweltering summer, the group pro
duced three plays— "Equus," "Twelfth
Night," and "Midsummer Nights
Dream"— which were met by great en
thusiasm and praise.
And now . . . they're baaack.
Equipped with three plays — two
Shakespeare and a Wertenbaker — and
the inverted title "Outside In Theater,"
the gender-balanced team has returned
ten strong, though this time, the shows
are not-so-absolutely free.
While dedicated producers, Erin Noble
and Zander Teller worked frantically on
fundraising over the past year, the two
did not meet their $20,000 dollar goal by
the begjpningof the summer.
Instead of giving up, which they
couldn't quite do because they already
had a cast, the two producers sat the ac
tors down for a meeting after which, the
company decided to go ahead regardless.
"We decided that we would rather scrimp
and scrape and cut u few corners, thun
call it off," said Teller.
But in the tradition of great outdoor
theater groups such as the San Francisco

"With lOutside In] it's never really
over," she continues. The entire company
lives in the same house. This set up facil
itates long work hours and, more impor
tantly, provides the space for much need
ed artistic experimentation. And since
each show is rehearsed in a scant thirteen
days, Laskow maintains such a turn
around "wouldn't be possible any other
way."
Th« Players
Sarah Cathcart, Jose (Paco) Farias,
Thomas Freeland, Jordan Gelber,
Ross McCall, Kira Snyder, Geoff
Sobelle, Teller, and Tineke Van Bercke
laer are the 10 dynamic members of Out
side In.

It is a living as well as a theater exper
iment. Not new, perhaps, to the theater
world in general, but for these individu
als and for Stanford, the effect is ground
breaking. While much of the energy to
sustain it comes from undergraduate stu
dents, many company members credit
Winter Mead, their artistic director.
Arriving on the scene several years
ago, Mead was hired by the drama de
partment as a visiting lecturer and has
taught courses like the "Advanced Per
formance Workshop," and "Acting
Shakespeare," as well as directed last
spring's Othello.
One of several pioneers in the creation
of the Red Hoop Players <the precursor to
Outside In), and director for most of their
shows, Mead has galvanized a number of
students and provided much needed guid
ance for their innovations.
"He's a powerhouse," said Teller. And
a supportive one at that. A mentor to
Laskow, he invited her to assistant direct
Othello last spring, and this summer, en
couraged her to direct the Outside In per
formance of "Our Country's Good."
Worried that the cast might not take
her seriously in her role as director,
Laskow nevertheless decided to take the
opportunity, with Mead's help. "He did
all the dramaturgy and provided so much
support," said Laskow., "He would total
ly back off if, but was right there when I
needed anything."
As the company looks towards the fu
ture, however, it is not without trepida
tion. The one constant in the Red Hoop
Players and the Outside In companies,
according to Teller, is Mead. And this sit
uation could change. "(Mead) might not
be around because the drama department
won't hire him," says Teller.
In this case, as always, it would be up
to t he new guard to ensure that the com
pany lives on.
Oar Country's Good
Laskow's directorial debut, the play
takes place on an Australian penal colony
in 1788 and dramatizes the plight of eight
convicts and their jailers. In this prison
within a prison, both convict and jailer,
officer and hangman, struggle to main
tain some semblance of dignity, honor,
and humanity, while being forced to suf
fer heaping indignities, and barbarous
treatment.
While remaining true to the historical
period, playwright Timberlake Werten
baker is nevertheless able to infuse tho
unfolding drama with a frighteningly
contemporary set of concerns. Out of her

characters' mouths, spew invectives that
step right into contemporary U.S. dis
course on crime and punishment.
Sometimes seriously, but most times
through humor, Wertenbaker showcases
debates on nature versus nurture and
ideologies of innate criminality; along
side meditations on culture, refinement,
and the nature of the theater through the
British colonial struggle, figuratively and
literally, over the convicts' bodies.
From the haunting beginning of the
play, when the convicts are led on stage
single-file, singing "Amazing Grace," and
one of the convicts is given fifty lashes
with a whip, one is jarred by the fact that
this play is as much about America as it is
about the Australian colony in which it is
set.
At one point, His Excellency, played
by Sonja Kuftinec, motions his officers to
stop shooting at birds, indirectly chiding
them for taking pleasure in killing. After
a moment long philosophical indulgence
on the nature of human potential and
generosity of spirit, he asks for a rifle to
continue their sport.
These hilarious moments are pep
pered throughout the drama, subtly rein
forcing its primary concern: the relation
ship between enlightenment and barbar
ity, and the struggle for freedom.
Director Laskow and the rest of the
Outside In crew are insightful in their in
terpretation of the multi-layered drama.
From the sheer physical detail, to the en
ergy of the cast, the skill and work put
into the show is impressive. The actors,
many of whom are playing two charac
ters, succeed in creating characters that
are distinct, engaging, and compelling to
watch. Some are excessively cruel and
others pathetic. Yet we care about each
one and want them to make it.
On the other hand, attention to detail,
and an over-emphasis on the humorous
aspects of the play at times sacrifice the
larger connections the script is making
between past and present, and fix the
play as a quirky representation of its time
period rather than a universal and affect
ing commentary on the nature of human
bondage.
Despite this limitation, this rendering
of Our Country is entertaining, engaging,
and provocative giving the audience
much food for thought long after the final
bow.

Our Country's Good runs from July 20-
24, In front of Cummings Art Building.
The Tempest, the final production of Out
side In's season, will run from July 28-
