## MGM Revival Brines Classic Films to Stanford 
### Matt Taylor 
Movie-goers tired of the requi
site Schwarzeneggarian element
in summer films now have an al
ternative at the Stanford The
atre. Even if these flicks are from
the jurassic era of cinema, you
may want to park it for classics
such as "Lassie Comes Home"
and"the Tarzans."
Digging deep into the Metro-
Goldwyn-Mayer vault, the Stan
ford Theatre has scheduled over
90 classic MGM films to run
through September 2nd in a
summer-long film festival of
black-and-white and Technicol
or proportions. Dating back to
the early '20s, the classics range
from critically acclaimed Oscar
winners to silent organ-accom
panied melo-dramas.
Such a collection of films is
quite a score, but after four years
of exhibiting solely classics this
is nothing new for the Stanford
Theatre. The theatre's been en
tertaining Palo Altans since
1925, but was restored four
years ago by a $6 million grant
from David Packard, son of the
president of Hewlett-Packard.
The non-profit venue is now
completely dedicated to "the
proper exhibition of films from
Hollywood's golden age," accord
ing to the promotional litera
ture.
And while stepping into the
theatre isn't exactly like step
ping through a portal in time —
popcorn still costs $2 a bucket —
the decoration and atmosphere
puts customers in the mood to
sing in the Rain or explore for

bidden planets. Brilliantly-re
stored posters from the sum
mer's offerings grace the the
atre's interior. It's attractive,
quaint, and well-appropriated
without being garish, which is
something that's hard to say of
the other big local theaters.
The theatre itself seats 1,175
and features a balcony. Prior to
the feature patrons are treated
to 15 minutes of organ music and
perhaps a few '40s cartoons from
the likes of animator Tex Avery,
who created Bugs Bunny before
leaving Warner for MGM.
The movie line-up has some
thing for almost everyone, ex
cept those looking for exploding
buses. Every Tuesday different
episodes of the Andy Hardy and
Dr. Kildare series are exhibited,
which were the 1940s equiva
lents of sitcoms.
On "silent" Wednesdays
check out pre-talkie films to the
sounds of the giant Wurlitzer
organ which rises out of the or
chestra pit. Showtoon time is
every Friday for MGM musicals
that haven't returned to Stan
ford since their initial release.
About the only popular MGM
movie you won't see is "Gone
With the Wind," which was not
technically an MGM production
even though it was distributed
by the studio.
But even without the help of
the Southern epic, the Stanford
Theatre's MGM classic film re
vival is sure enthrall audiences
of all ages.
Cat 4 ii a Hot I in Cecf (I > '»s)
The Tennessee Williams play

comes to full color life, starring
Elizabeth Taylor and Paul New
man. Although censorship
forced sexual issues into the
background, the classic story of
relationships built on lies earned
Newman an Academy Award
nomination. (First showing:
TONIGHT, July 21, 7:30 p.m.)
Julius Caesar (19531
Et tu, Brando? Marlon Brando
plays Marc Antony in what crit
ics have described as the finest
rendition of the Shakespeare
play ever to grace a silver screen.
(First showing: Saturday, July
30,3:00 p.m.)
1 lie rcstmau Always
l intis I wire (I M< )
When a drifter meets a bored
wife of a restaurant owner who
has a "Man Wanted" sign on dis
play, basic instinct takes over.
Love, murder, romance, and al
lusions to sex mark this steamy
(for the time) and intense film,
which stayed a classic even when
the modern and mangled '80s
version starring Jack Nicholson
and Jessica Lange was released.
(First showing: Thursday, Aug.
4, 7:30 p.m.)
Tarzan Triple-Feature
(1932-30)
Three films for lord of the jungle
die-hards will be triple-billed on
one day: "Tarzan, the Ape Man;"
"Tarzan and His Mate;" and
"Tarzan Escapes." Tarzan, Jane,
and Cheetah couldn't be beat for
adventure and romance in their
heyday. (First showing: Satur
day, Aug. 13, 3:50 p.m.)
