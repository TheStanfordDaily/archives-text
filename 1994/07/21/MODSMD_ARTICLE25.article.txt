# Power-folk lost
## Toad the Wet Sprocket's 'dulcinea' sits like white rice 
### 
Toad the Wet Sprocket bassist Dean Din
ning once described the Santa Barbara
band's music as "power folk," namely, folk
music accompanied by grinding electric gui
tar riffs.
But as mega-groups Nirvana and Pearl
Jam have preached to all of music-appreciat
ing society, and less mainstream bands like
Sonic Youth have practiced for years, the
electric guitar's range of expression doesn't
just give a song audible stature, it exposes the
entrails of base emotion.
In a recent release, British punk group
Radiohead successfully rejuvinates a cliched
situation (the self-deprecating male in love
with the girl who's "just like an angel"), mar
rying guitar expression with pointed lyrics.
Sparse guitars interrupt the mellow chorus
and provide just enough edginess to unsettle
listeners without alienating them from the
speaker's moment of self-pity.
That's the kind of "power" that motivates
even the most bitter of caustic cynics to
plunk down 16 bucks for hi-fidelity sound.
And in their 1992 release, "fear," Toad dis
played a knack for composing folk songs with
that kind of energy.
"Stories I tell," one track off the earlier
album, depicts a man combatting the frustra
tion that ensues when all he wants is to create
songs, but the vines in the music-scenejungle
(the money, the media, the fans) keep stran
gling his efforts to stay true to the art form.
Set to a waltz, the grungy guitar crescendo
heightens the sense of urgency and sonorous

ly simulates a dizzyness with which only an
other superstar could sincerely sympathize.
Sadly though, Toad's latest release, "dul
cinea" — not to be confused with The Judy
bats' song, "La dulcinea" — nearly switches
the group's sound into total folk mode. The
big guitar noise first discovered on, "fear,"
now tiptoes in the background, its "power"
reduced to that of piped-in elevator Muzak.
Not that "dulcinea" as a whole bites, or
anything. Rather, it just sits there sort of like
a side order of white rice. Take "Fly from
heaven," for example. Except for the moder
ately interesting lyrics about a man who
claims to have conversations with the narra
tor's dead brother, it's a peppy, melody-dri
ven ditty that after a few listens grates hard
er than a Ned Flander's greeting.
And in "Woodburning," Toad sneaks a bit
more guitar noise into the song's core, yet fails
to exploit it once it's there. To start, guitars re
peat the same chord progression throughout
the entire song. Then, when the moment to in
tensitfy the pressure created by the stark
drum pattern and the walking bass finally ar
rives, the guitar simply sputters a note or two
of feedback. Tamed guitars blunt the "edge"
and render "Woodburning" forgettable.
And lead singer and lyricist Glen Phillips
writes words so shallow an insect could wade
through them. Several slightly varied, vapid
songs depict self-professed loners who se
cretly ache for the meaningful connections
they regularly sabotage with their social in
eptness. You know, songs filled with the kind

of suburban-white-boy angst that drives true
mavericks to spasmodic fits of laughter.
"Crowing" rambles on about an unreach
able lover who "was crowing for repair";
"Windmills" speaks of dysfunction; "nanci"
declares "a legal precedent could set us
straight"; and "Something's always wrong"
describes "another day I call and never
speak." Oh, the inner turmoil.
Yet as Stone Temple pirates have proven
twice over, well-written lyrics — and original
music, for that matter — have little to do
with chart-topping. Fortunately for the
group, Toad's latest CD might get a boost up
the Top4o ladder because of one, maybe two
requisite singles, namely catchy pop songs.
"Fall down" and "Inside," both which rely
more on hooks than lyrical substance and
creative musicianship, fit the suit perfectly.
Thanks to happy-go-lucky melodies as
predictable as the KOME playlist and deriva
tive acoustic guitar licks, "dulcinea" fails to
yank your attention from even the most
mindless of activities.
Save one stylistically brilliant, clearly
non-mainstream track, scrubbing that ring
out your bathtub never seemed so mentally
consuming.
"Reincarnation song," buried at the CD's
end possibly because it's such an atypical
Toad number, spices the bland "dulcinea"
mix by adding a much needed touch of eccen
tricity. In that track, you'd swear Phillips
hadn't quite awoken from his mescaline
dream when he started croaking into a

recording studio mike about "another life"
and "another birth."
Carried by Phillips' affected voice — an in
triguing cross between Tom Petty's and J.
Mascis' of Dinosaur Jr. — the cut crawls
along guided at first by Phillips' quiet strum
ming, the sluggish stroking of his six
stringed, electric buddy.
Bass and drums join in at the second stan
za shortly before all three gradually escalate
in volume and dissonance as the guitar
creaks and spits feedback along side Phillips'
scratchy screams.
With every element contributing to the
song's spaced-out mood, Toad masterfully
weaves an intricately orchestrated illusion of
drug-induced rhapsody.
As the majority of the groups' music —
i.e. catchy, preachy, PC-pop — attests, how
ever, chances are cuts like "reincarnation
song" only will come from Toad once every
so-many albums.
Strangely enough, the band learned little
when contemporary folk-icon Suzanne Vega
embraced industrial and anti-folk hero Beck
discovered the drum machine. The Bob
Dylan/Joan Baez thing only carries an artist
so far these days, even when a gritty guitar
sound accompanies a lighter acoustic one.
Maybe Toad will figure that out before
their next release, the fifth in a string of mod
ern folk albums. Or more likely, First Lady
Hillary Clinton will sweep the presidential
election in '96.
