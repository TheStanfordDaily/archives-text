New postal board's
road to better service
a difficult journey

The combined efforts of
ASSU, exasperated
students and U.S. Repre
sentative Anna Eshoo's office
have finally pressured the Stan
ford Post Office into taking a
long hard look at its record of
service. And while it is apparent
that those in the post office are
seeing the same problems that
the Stanford campus has com
plained about for so long, it is
still too early to know whether
the post office will go the way of
the wagon train â€” "service or
bust!"
The pending formation of the
Postal Advisory Board (a com
mittee comprised of two to three
students, three local postal offi
cials and one university repre
sentative) offers Stanford the
unique opportunity to re-evalu
ate its relationship with the fed
eral post office and make con
crete recommendations as to
how that relationship will best
serve the community.
The role of the Postal Adviso
ry Board will be to consider the
continuing complaints of poor
customer service, inaccurate
mail delivery, sky-rocketing
costs, and mail incompatibility
that have plagued the post office
over the last five years.
Although an immediate and
simple panacea is highly im
probable, examination of postal
procedures and gaining an un
derstanding of the organization
of the postal system should help
pinpoint the origin of current
problems.
The prevalent problem criti
cized by students and other post
office box holders is the slow
ness of incoming mail delivery.
This dilatory service, however,
may lie in the federal post office
system and not with the Stan
ford postal service specifically.
All incoming mail that is ad
dressed to Stanford, California
must first go through the Postal
Distribution Center located in
San Fransisco and then to the
Palo Alto Post Office branch
where it is sorted and, at last,
sent to its final destination of

Stanford. Keeping this process
in mind, is it right to hold the
Stanford branch fully account
able for delayed mail service?
Still a primary suggestion of
improving the current perfor
mance of mail delivery on cam
pus is to implement a private
postal delivery system. The en
tailments of forming such an
agency, as well as the benefits of
doing so, should be closely scru
tinized before any steps are
taken to transform the Stanford
Post Office into a Mail Box Inc.
A private organization might
possibly save the University
money by allowing direct de
posit of campus mail. Currently,
phone bills, registration bills,
and other university informa
tion require a standard postage,
but establishing an entirely new
postal system may incur high
costs to the University in the im
mediate future as well.
Hopefully, the Postal Advi
sory Board can find a way to
make the current postal system
work better for all involved. But
with or without the board's di
rection, it should be clear that
the postal service needs to de
velop a system to identify the
most expedient methods of mail
delivery.
Stanford students have com
plained and attempted to make
changes to the post office for
over five years. Its failure to ad
equately deal with these com
plaints may be the result of in
herent flaws in the federal
postal system.
One step that the Postal Ad
visory Board can take is to en
courage the Stanford branch to
keep records of complaints filed
rather than simply attempting
to remedy the problem on a case
by-case basis.
Without keeping a file of
complaints, the post office is un
able to keep track of recurring
problems. They can only ad
dress individual problems. And
such i system is redundant and
ineiucient.
The challenge to improve
campus mail service is an en
deavor wrought with endless
complications. And in future
months, as the Postal Advisory
Board takes the lead in con
fronting the problem, its mem
bers and the rest of us would do
well to proceed with care.
