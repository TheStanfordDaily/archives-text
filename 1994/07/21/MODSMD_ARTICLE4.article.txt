## The
						last action heroine 
### 
The femme fatale of times
past, the infamous Helen of
Troy for instance, who pos
sessed the face that launched a
1000 ships, has now been re
placed by Hollywood's new arche
type: "the Last Action Heroine."
Made popular by director
James Cameron in the '86 release
"Aliens," Stanford alumnus
Sigourney Weaver's wiry build
and explosive personality defined
the role. Following in her
"macha" predecessor's foot steps,
Linda Hamilton's brawny biceps
and hard abs further personified
the role in her performance in
"Terminator 2: Judgment Day."
The popular and memorable
characteristics that define the
women in this summer's block
buster hits like "True Lies,"
"Speed" and"I Love Trouble" re
flect the patriarchal and andro
centric society in which we live.
Dainty feminine features have
been forsaken for tenacity,
strength and courage.
Public approval and applause
for the performances of Jamie
Lee Curtis, Sandra Bullock and
Julia Roberts stem from the in
doctrinated value of the male par
adigm as the norm. By following
society's admiration and value of
masculine qualities, our "last ac
tion heroine," takes her place
upon the pedestal in the fantasy

world of film. As a result, she
helps to elevate the position of
women in everyday society.
For years, women have played
passive and acquiescent roles,
that of the damsel in distress per
petually in need of being rescued
by the virile and dauntless man.
But now, acting as counter
parts to the premier action icons
of our generation, becoming fear
less and adventurous themselves,
Curtis, Bullock and Roberts re
flect the changing role that
women have played in society at
large.
Instead of remaining helpless
and futile, Curtis is catapulted
into the realm of international es
pionage where she annihilates
numerous enemies with uzi in
hand, Bullock pushes the limit
and drives a bomb loaded bus in a
non-stop ride and Roberts seizes
a microchip while caught in cross
fire.
Although the status of women
can be raised to some degree by
ingratiating masculinity into
their persona, without challeng
ing the established social hierar
chy, women will eventually reach
a glass ceiling. A disparity be
tween men and women may di
minish, but a society of complete
equality will still remain difficult
to achieve. Subscribing to a
monolithic mentality of a singu

lar paradigm is fatalistic and in
hibits individual growth. Cultiva
tion of gender traits is important,
but segregation — sexism — of
gender roles is not.
The popularity of these three
heroines exemplifies our attrac
tion to bravery, valor and brava
do. The problem occurs when
these qualities are labeled "mas
culine" and are attributed to only
one sex. Adherence to society's
notion of what it is to be "mascu
line" and what it is to be "femi
nine" should be questioned. La
bels, stereotypes, classifications
and generalizations should be ex
amined rather than blindly ac
cepted.
This summer's movies are a
window into the collective uncon
scious. They reflect society's ea
gerness to continue to place
woman second by granting her
manly powers but not allowing
her to reach the pinnacle of our
social hierarchy. Our last action
heroine will remained trapped in
the framework of our male-domi
nated society until she challenges
the paradigm.

Ann Suivanjindar wishes she
had abs like Linda Hamilton.
