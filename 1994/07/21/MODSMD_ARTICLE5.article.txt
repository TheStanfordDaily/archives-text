## SHS and University benefits not identical but comparable 
### 
We are writing in response
to last week's Daily edito
rial regarding University
employees who will become part
of Stanford Health Services.
As stated in your editorial, the
establishment of Stanford Health
Services (SHS) was determined by
President Casper and the Board of
Trustees to be of critical impor
tance to the University. SHS will
be an integral part of the Universi
ty, with its primary goals being to
serve the academic mission of the
Medical School.
While it is true that the Univer
sity and SHS benefit plans are not
identical, they are comparable.
Therefore the SHS benefit pro
gram being offered is not a "far less
generous benefit package" as was
stated in your editorial. Both orga
nizations have a full range of
health, welfare and retirement
plans which are designed to ensure
financial security and time off as

needed during periods of illness or
disability.
However, realizing that chang
ing employers and benefits is not
easy, the University and SHS want
to be sensitive to the needs of staff
and have developed an extensive
accommodation package to ease
the transition.
Special attention was given to
those areas which appeared to be of
most concern to employees and,
after listening to issues raised in
employee meetings, enhancements
to the original accommodations
were made in a number of areas.
The Tuition Grant program is
the one University benefit program
which is not available to SHS em
ployees. The original accommoda
tion was to offer the benefit to Uni
versity employees who had living
dependents and met the Universi
ty's service requirement (five years
for full-time employees) by Sept. 1,
1994. This policy has recently been

expanded so that both University
and SHS service will apply toward
eligibility.
Health plan networks are similar
so very few employees will find that
they need to change physicians, and
transition benefits are being applied
to employees who are in an acute
phase of medical treatment to en
sure that they can continue with
their current physicians.
The University and SHS plans
for time off are very different, but
they both provide time off for holi
days, vacation, illness of employees
and family members, dependent
care, bereavement, educational
leave and other reasons for needing
time away from work. The Paid
Time Off package being adopted by
SHS is considered very generous in
the health care field and on the
Peninsula.
We hope that once the uncer
tainty associated with the transi
tion has passed and employees

fully understand their benefits and
their role in the new organization,
they will be pleased to be a part of
an exciting new venture.
