## Stanford's Graphic Center to be eliminated 19 positions to be terminated by August 31; move may have large impact on campus departments 
### Frank Guinan Editorial staff 
The 19 employees of Stanford Publica
tion Services' Graphic Center were notified
yesterday that their jobs were being elimi
nated at the end of August, a move that will
also have a large impact on the many cam
pus departments that rely on their services.
The employees of Graphic Center — who
handle publication design and production for
many i_ apus offices — were told that they
would be released on August 31. Terry Shep
ard, director of communications, said that the
University is "doing everything fit] can" to
compensate for all those who have been let go.
Clients of Graphic Center — which in
clude the Development Office and the Office
of Undergraduate Admissions — face a pos

sible increase in costs as they look for out
side publication services.
"It really depends on how smart the de
partments are," Shepard said. "They will
have to take responsibility for their own
needs . .. [and will have] the freedom to use
the free market to their advantage."
Shepard added that Graphic Center "will
try to work out projects already in the
pipeline."
Vivian Barry, assistant dean for adminis
tration in the Undergraduate Admissions
Office, praised the work of Graphic Center.
She added that this move by the adminis
tration will "probably cost more ... and
mean a lot more work for our department."
Over the past three years, Publication
Services has lost its general funding from
the University and has had to find ways to

be self-sufficient. Last year, however, it
faced a budget deficit of $277,000, and, for
the current year, the losses are in "roughly
the same area," according to Shepard.
Susan Cretarolo, director of Graphic
Center, said that convenience and a consis
tent image have been trademarks of the cen
ter. "We have provided high quality at a rea
sonable cost," she added.
Shepard said that the elimination of
Graphic Center is not a reflection of the
quality of work done there. "They do a real
ly good job . . . [but] the economics just
won't allow for such a service," he added.
Robert Topor, former director of Publi
cation Services, said that the University
"will live to regret the idea" of eliminating
the organization.
"It provided an official central service,"

Topor said, adding that departments will be
forced to deal with a "hodge-podge" of dif
ferent services which are "not professional
ly developed."
Topor volunteered to leave his position
during budget cuts two years ago and is cur
rently working in an organization which
works with marketing higher education.
"It's too bad that the University looks to
downsizing its communications during a
time of cuts," he said.
Cretarolo and Alena Lee, manager of Pub
lication Services' Document Express, are re
signing from their positions on July 29 be
cause of differences with the administration.
Publication Services' Document Express
in Tresidder Union will not be closing but
instead will begin operating independently
at the end of August.
