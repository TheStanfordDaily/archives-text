# Postal Board named
## Members to address complaints 
### Allison Short Janar Stewart Staff writers 
In response to numerous com
plaints about the postal service, a
group of concerned students, ad
ministrators and postal represen
tatives formed last week the
Postal Advisory Board, an official
committee to address postal per
formance issues.
The creation of this new task
force was the result of an informal
meeting on July 13 between repre
sentatives of student, administra
tive and postal concerns.
The Advisory Board will con
sist of three postal representa
tives, three students and at least
one University administrator.
Committee members will be
named officially before the first
meeting, scheduled for Oct. 5.
The board plans to examine
several key issues of interest to
the community, such as slow mail
and discourteous service.
"The advisory board will pro
vide an important role in facilitat
ing a two-way communication be
tween the Post Office and Stan
ford," ASSU Summer Chair Steve
Russell said.
Russell, who helped organize
the July 13 meeting, stressed the
importance of reaching solutions
to the public's complaints.
Palo Alto Postmaster Masyuki
Sato expressed his hope that the
meetings will be constructive and
not "gripe sessions for discontent
ed students."
Despite the numerous com
plaints of slow service, Palo Alto
has the highest on-time percent

ages in the area, according to Sato.
All area branches, grouped togeth
er as the City of Palo Alto, have an
on-time delivery rate of 92 percent.
That figure, however, could be
masking a greater problem with
Stanford deliveries, said Nanci
Howe, the assistant director of
Tresidder Union. Because the per
centages include delivery rates of
all branches, a high on-time rate at
the main branch in Palo Alto could
balance a lower one on campus and
still average to a good score.
All mail arrives on campus al
ready pre-sorted in the Palo Alto
branch, except for bar-coded mail
which is automatically sorted in
the Stanford branch. All the mail
is then distributed by campus
postal workers.
The Advisory Board plans to
study why delivery rates at post
office boxes are so much lower
than those of other campus sites.
Sato commented that the Stan
ford workers "put the mail up on a
daily basis and hit all the dead
lines."
A response to slow mail service
will not officially be addressed until
the October meeting. At the first
meeting, the new committee will
gather information on the Post Of
fice's performance in relation to
other comparable post offices.
Outside of misdelivery com
plaints, Russell said he has collect
ed specific complaints from stu
dents, faculty and staff on rude be
havior and sexual harassment on
the part of postal clerks.
"All [the people] want is to be
treated like human beings," Rus
sell said.
Since last week's meeting, the
Post Office now requires clerks to
wear name tags, which allows
consumers to identify impolite
workers.
Currently, one clerk has been
temporarily removed from han
dling the front desk due to his
"performance," said Sato. Al
though he declined to elaborate,
Sato added that once an employee
has a job, they cannot be taken
from that position due to seniori
ty and union regulations.
Stanford Station Manager Jim
Ruiz added that in order to be
shifted to another position within
the Post Office, workers must
also complete a three-week train
ing class for each particular job.
With the newly formed commit
tee, Ruiz kept his hopes for reform
high. "I'm expecting we'll be able to
get positive input and look at other
options for solving problems."
