# Clinton nominates Burciaga
## Former RF named to education commission 
### 
President Clinton nominated
Cecilia Burciaga, associate dean
and development officer, as a
member of the President's Adviso
ry Commission on Educational
Excellence for Hispanic Ameri
cans earlier this month.
"I'm humbled by the recogni
tion," Burciaga said in response to
her official notification by the
White House.
The presidential commission, a
new White House initiative, was
formed to create methods to in
crease the educational pipeline for
Hispanics in the U.S., Burciaga
said.
"The situation [in Hispanic
Education] was so desperate
that the president realized some
thing had to be done," Burciaga
added.
As a member of the national ad
visory panel, Burciaga will attend
frequent meelirgs in Washington

D.C. along with 19 other mem
bers tabbed from across the na
tion.
Burciaga said her emphasis
and individual contributions will
be in graduate education as well as
programs like Upward Bound, a
long-term tutoring-mentorship
program for high-school students.
In addition, she will examine edu
cation in a larger context by look
ing at national education priori
ties and how the national budget
is distributed.
Although Burciaga has not re
ceived official notification of the
first meeting, she anticipates it
will be in September. Burciaga
said her position on the Presi
dent's panel will last for at least
two years.
Burciaga, whose University po
sition was eliminated last spring,
will leave Stanford by August 31.
