University officials in Califor
nia breathed a cautious sigh of re
lief Monday after a Senate sub
committee voted to restore most
of the $900 million that the House
of Representatives cut from de
fense research funding.
On Monday, the Senate sub
committee on Defense Appropria
tions recommended cutting $79
million from the $1.8 billion origi
nally set aside to fund university
based research. This version of
the defense spending bill would
cut the funding by less than five
percent, as opposed to the House's
version — passed in late June —
which cut the funding by 50 per
cent.
"This is a step in the right di

rection, although wt have a few
more steps to go," said Dale Tate,
associate director for government
relations.
The bill went before the Senate
Appropriations Committee yes
terday and could be voted on by
the full Senate as early as today.
If the bill passes the Senate, it
will then go to a conference com
mittee where the different figures
will be reconciled. Depending on
whether Congress takes a recess
in August, final voting on the bill
could come as early as next
month.
Provost Condoleezza Rice and
Larry Horton, associate vice pres
ident for Public Affairs, were in
Washington, D.C., earlier this
week to speak to several senators
regarding the bill.
