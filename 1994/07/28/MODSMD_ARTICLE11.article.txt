# Research funds restored
## Senate subcommittee cuts less than 5 percent of original defense spending bill 
### Frank Guinan Editorial staff with AP wire reports 
University officials in Califor
nia breathed a cautious sigh of re
lief Monday after a Senate sub
committee voted to restore most
of the $900 million that the House
of Representatives cut from de
fense research funding.
On Monday, the Senate sub
committee on Defense Appropria
tions recommended cutting $79
million from the $1.8 billion origi
nally set aside to fund university
based research. This version of
the defense spending bill would
cut the funding by less than five
percent, as opposed to the House's
version — passed in late June —
which cut the funding by 50 per
cent.
"This is a step in the right di

rection, although wt have a few
more steps to go," said Dale Tate,
associate director for government
relations.
The bill went before the Senate
Appropriations Committee yes
terday and could be voted on by
the full Senate as early as today.
If the bill passes the Senate, it
will then go to a conference com
mittee where the different figures
will be reconciled. Depending on
whether Congress takes a recess
in August, final voting on the bill
could come as early as next
month.
Provost Condoleezza Rice and
Larry Horton, associate vice pres
ident for Public Affairs, were in
Washington, D.C., earlier this
week to speak to several senators
regarding the bill.
"We consider the Senate's ac
tions veiy, very positive," Horton
said. He also added that no change
was anticipated in the full commit
tee's markup or the floor debate.
Chemistry Prof. Richard Zare
was also in Washington this week
to speak with the National Science
Board about the impacts of the bill
on the future of science. Zare, who
is a member of the board, said that
he is "pleased to see that most of
the funding is restored."

"The loss is now between $900
million and $79 million,"he added.
"I hope it's closer to $79 million."
Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska,
said that while the money is being
restored, it is "ludicrous and arro
gant" for universities to feel they
are entitled to receive Pentagon
money every year.
Zare said that although he
agreed with Stevens, he said that it
is "ludicrous to cut [defense re
search funding] by 50 percent."
No matter what the final fig
ure, any cut threatens numerous
graduate students' chances of en
rolling in graduate school since
many of them use grants from the

Defense Department to pay their
tuition.
"A diminished number of grad
uate students hurts the future,"
Zare said.
Numerous faculty members at
Stanford, including Biology Prof.
Craig Heller and Physics Depart
ment Chair Doug Osheroff, had
earlier criticized the House's dras
tic cut as "short-sighted" and em
phasized that the research which
the Defense Department funds is
"very valuable and very desir
able." Heller cited laser optics, In
ternet and the information super
highway as examples of what has
resulted from such funding.
