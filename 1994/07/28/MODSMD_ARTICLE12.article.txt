# Stanford eyes Ginsberg's hoard
## 
### Justin Pollard 
Allen Ginsberg, one of the fore
most poets of the "beat" genera
tion, is selling most of his personal
belongings, and Stanford Universi
ty is interested in purchasing them.
Ginsberg, 68, said he would like
to move into a roomier apartment
in New York City, and so is selling
about 120,000 of his prize posses
sions, including the first draft of
his famous poem, "Howl," letters
from friends such as Jack Kerouac,
William Burroughs and Lawrence
Ferlinghetti, his diaries going back
to when he was 11, and the sneak
ers he was wearing when he was
kicked out of Czechoslovakia in
1965.
Stanford University is consider
ing purchasing the entire collec
tion of Ginsberg's possessions,
which were recently appraised at
$1.2 million, for an undisclosed
amount of money.
"We certainly are interested in
building a strong collection of mod
ern and contemporary literature,"
said bill McPheron, director of the

English and American literature
collections of Stanford University
libraries.
Stanford's archives in this area
are already very strong, noted
McPheron, especially with the re
cent acquisitions of the works of
Denise Levertov and Robert Cree
ley. In addition, the University has
important collections of the works
of John Steinbeck, Ernest Hem
ingway, Janet Lewis and Tillie
Olsen.
McPheron said the initial ex
pression of interest in the works of
Ginsberg came from faculty mem
bers working in the field of modern
American literature.
Professor Albert Gelpi of the
English Department said he would
be especially pleased if the Univer
sity decided to obtain Ginsberg's
things.
"By all accounts, Ginsberg is
one of the most influential and
widely read poets of the second half
of the century, "Gelpi said. "'Howl'
created a sensation when it came
out and fueled the beat genera
tion."

The value of obtaining the col
lection would not only be from
Ginsberg's work but also from his
numerous correspondences with
many of his contemporaries, ac
cording to Gelpi.
He commented that if Stanford
were to purchase the Ginsberg col
lection, his archives and those of
Creeley and Levertov would "start
interconnecting with one another,
creating an extensive record of
modern writing and poetry."
This record would be "a rich re
source not only for poetic and liter
ary scholars, but to people inter
ested in post-World War II culture
and society," he added. Ginsberg
and his contemporaries were heav
ily involved in the start of the coun
terculture movement, as well as
the anti-nuclear, ecological and
pacifist movements.
Gelpi said the money used to
purchase the collection would not
come out of the University budget,
but from the generosity of donors
who "give for specific purposes"—
such as the acquisition of special
collections.
