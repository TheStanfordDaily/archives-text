# Health care compromise suggested
## Law prof and student offer solution to abortion coverage 
### Julie Zwaska 
No one has yet been able to provide an acceptable
solution to the politically explosive dilemma of
whether abortions should receive coverage in upcom
ing national health care legislation.
However, Stanford Law Professor Henry T. Greely
and one of his law students, Leigh S. Goodmark, be
lieve they might have broken through this impasse.
The two unveiled a proposal in an opinion-editorial
piece in the New York Times on July 22 in which they
discussed what they believe to be an acceptable com
promise for both pro-life and pro-choice advocates.
In their article, Greely wrote that "coverage for
legal abortion services should be part of the basic pack
age of health benefits for everyone," thereby protect
ing the benefits of those 100 million Americans whose
current health insurance covers abortion.
But Greely continues that "conscientious objectors
with religious, ethical or moral objections to abortion
could choose not to pay for such services through their
health care premiums and could receive a credit from
their insurers."
Though other compromises have been discussed on
Capitol Hill, Greely and Goodmark say theirs is
unique because it starts with the premise that abor
tion should be covered.
Abortion coverage is currently a taboo topic among
legislators in Congress, for no matter what decision is
made, many voices will cry out in protest.
Pro-choice advocates contend that if abortion is ex

eluded from coverage, legislators are ignoring the
needs of all women. Another worry of the pro-choice
movement is that such a decision would adversely af
fect poor women who could not afford such a proce
dure.
Pro-life supporters counter if abortion is included,
the policy is actively condoning abortion as an accept
able form of birth control.
With neither side likely to compromise its views,
health care reforms have stagnated, and the issue of
abortion threatens to completely destroy any national
attempt at universal coverage.
Sen. John Danforth (R-Mo.) offered a proposal in
which a person has the option to pay a higher premi
um to acquire a plan which covers abortion. Greely
said he objects to such a plan because he believes that
women should not have to "buy" abortion.
Greely said he conceived of this plan with the help
of his law student Goodmark, who last winter ap
proached Greely and asked if he had any topics to sug
gest for a directed reading.
"I had always thought that it would be a real shame
for a chance at health care reform to disappear
because of the abortion debate," he said. So, he sug
gested that Goodmark extensively research the issue.
Greely himself admitted that "in the abstract, it is
not a good way to run a government to have a variety
of special options, but in the context of health reform,
this makes sense."
Goodmark is currently taking the bar exam and
could not be reached for comment.
