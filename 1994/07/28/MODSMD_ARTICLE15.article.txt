# Give me steam
## Old pipelines being replaced at central-campus locations 
### Sona Sharma 
Even though there are still two
months of summer vacation left,
construction workers on Stanford
campus are showing no signs of
taking time off, as a surge of con
struction activities began recently.
Along with reconstruction of
Palm Drive, Via Ortega and Via
Pueblo, three steam-line replace
ment projects are also under way
for the next two months in the
center of campus.
Pacific Mechanical Corpora
tion started work on the steam
lines in the second week of July,
said Stanford Project Manager
Lewis Lane. These projects in
volve replacing decayed and dete
riorated steam pipelines, he
added.
One project is the White Plaza
Steam Condensate Replacement.
The area of operation runs be
tween two steam manholes â€”
from the Clock Tower to the
grassy area near the Claw.
The work area will be fenced off
for the duration of the construc

tion, making the often-congested
area a tricky spot for cyclists and
pedestrians.
The second phase of this pro
ject is scheduled to start next year
and will cover the area from the
Claw to Dinkelspiel Auditorium,
Lane said.
The second project this sum
mer involves relocating the steam
pipeline that currently runs
through the Meyer Library base
ment around the building.
"Now the concern is, if the
steam line ruptures or there is an
earthquake, a significant amount
of damage could be done to the
books which are down there,"
Lane said.
DeGuerre pool is the site of the
third project, which started yes
terday. Steam lines that provide
heating to the pools are being re
placed, Lane said.
The construction cost of the
three projects is estimated at
$580,000, and all are planned to
be completed by mid-September
and "definitely before the first
football game," Lane said.
