# Schooling for a New Generation
## Condoleezza Rice's Summer Enrichment Academy Story by Arnold Ceballos Photos by Joshua Folk 
### 
It's a beautiful summer afternoon, but
Edilberto Fullido is sitting in a class
room â€” and enjoying it. Fullido, who
will enter the 7th grade this fall, is in sum
mer school. But this isn't a typical sum
mer school, thanks to a unique East Palo
Alto program co-founded by Stanford
University Provost Condoleezza Rice.
Fullido is a student in the Center for a
New Generation's Summer Enrichment
Academy, in which he and over 100 other
East Palo Alto sth-through-Bth graders
are spending six full weeks participating
in a balanced curriculum of academics,
arts and athletics.
On this sunny afternoon, Fullido is
busy with his friends and classmates Marc
Jordan and David Latu rehearsing their
lines for a drama presentation they wrote
and will act out at the end of the summer
program. Nearby, another group rehears
es their respective scene in the shade of a
tree outside a classroom at Menlo Oaks
School, where the Academy is centered.
"It beats sitting at home on a couch
watching television and gaining weight,"
notes Fullido as he reads his lines for his
scene, entitled "Fighting Is Not The An
swer."
"We never do this in the school year,"
adds Jordan, who will be entering the sth
grade in September.
In the classroom next door, fellow stu
dents are working on abstract paintings,
while in another classroQm others are
learning to play musical instruments.
The Summer Enrichment Academy is a
six-week program which began June
20 and ends July 29. Fullido, Jordan,
and Latu are among 108 East Palo Alto
students selected from schools in the
Ravenswood City School District to par
ticipate in the unique program. The chil
dren, who were chosen based on a mini
mum G.P. A. of 2.5 and a report of good be
havior from a teacher or their principal,
attend the classes and activities from 9:00
a.m. to 2:30 p.m.
In the morning, all the students partic
ipate in classes in one of two academic
cores. Some have chosen to enroll in a

course which emphasizes language arts,
journalism and computers, while others
are in one which teaches math, science
and computers. After a lunch provided by
the Center, the students take part in the
arts segment, where they choose whether
they would like to hone their creative tal
ents in instrumental or vocal music, dance
or arts and crafts. And, of course, the chil
dren look forward to the athletics portion
of the program, where they can take part
in games ranging from capture the flag, to
volleyball to basketball and everything in
between.
This is the third summer for the Acad
emy, a program created by Rice's
Center for a New Generation to com
plement the existing school programs in
East Palo Alto and to nurture the interest
in learning that many of the city's chil
dren have.
The Center itself was founded after
Condoleezza Rice suggested to several
friends that they do something to help im
poverished East Palo Alto, which has high
unemployment, school drop-out, and
crime rates.
In a July 1992 interview with the San
Jose Mercury News, the Alabama-born
Rice said that she was shocked "that I had
more opportunity in segregated Birming
ham than kids raised in modern-day Cali
fornia." Rice said she was inspired to cre
ate the Center after giving a graduation
speech to a class of East Palo Alto Bth
graders in 1991, shortly after her return
to Stanford from Washington, where she
had been a high-ranking foreign policy ad
viser to President Bush.
"I believe in getting things up and
running. If we could unify Germany in
less than a year, we can do just as well for
East Palo Alto," Rice told the Mercury
News.
Rice's friend and co-chair, Susan Ford
of the Ford Land Company, said that she
and her husband, a Republican Party ac
quaintance of Rice's, were approached by
Rice about starting some kind of philan
thropic endeavor, shortly after she gave
the East Palo Alto graduation speech.

According to Ford, Rice was fascinated
by the pageantry of the graduation cere
mony, especially since these students
were only graduating from the Bth grade.
"It seemed like such a big deal for the Bth
graders," said Ford, "but then Condoleezza
found out it was because a lot of them won't
see graduation from high school."
"We realized that a lot of these kids
may be interested in learning, but they
have no opportunity for academic en
hancement other than remedial summer
school," said Ford.
Rice approached Ravenswood City
.School District Superintendent Charlie
Mae Knight about ways to improve the
situation and, with help from the Fords
and others, created the Center for a New
Generation in December, 1991.
Rice donated $10,000 to the project, as
did the Ford Land Company. The Sun Mi
crosystems Foundation awarded a
$15,000 grant and the Carnegie Founda
tion gave $25,000. Rice continues to help
raise funds for the project and serves as a
co-chair for the Center.
Headquarted at East Palo Alto's Cesar
Chavez Academy, the Center per
forms supportive and educational
functions similar to those Rice received as
a child in Alabama, where her father
arranged for teachers to tutor neighbor
hood children after school. The Center's
goals were reflected in a speech Rice gave
at the 1992 Republican Convention in
Houston, where she said that "every child
must be convinced that America will give
him or her the best possible chance to suc
ceed, but every child must understand
that America is strong because we can de
termine what we make of ourselves."
In addition to the Summer Academy,
the Center for a New Generation operates
a similar after-school program during the
regular school year. It also runs a Parent
Education Center which provides work
shops on parenting skills and parent in
volvement in schools, and, in collabora
tion with Canada College, provides early
childhood education classes and English
and Spanish language classes.

The programs are paid for through the
initial founding grants, some long-term fi
nancial commitments, and ongoing dona
tions, according to the Beverly Scott, the
Center's Executive Director. The Cen
ter's Operations Manager, Mia Jackson,
said that the organization runs all its pro
grams on an annual budget of approxi
mately $350,000 to $400,000.
Other foundations and corporations
supporting the Center include PG&E,
Intel, Hewlett-Packard, Hitachi, Applied
Materials, Transamerica, the Carnegie
Corporation Foundation and a large num
ber of individual donors, said Scott.
The program's instructors are paid,
but there are also some volunteers help
ing the Center, including several Stanford
students referred to the program by the
Haas Center for Public Service. Susan
Ford noted that several Cardinal football
players donated their time last year to
help tutor the children. The Center also
received a $15,000 donation from an exhi
bition NFL game played at Stanford Sta
dium last year between the San Francisco
49ers and the Los Angeles Raiders.
Operations Manager Jackson said that
the Center welcomes any donations of
money, time or ideas. "Sometimes people
don't realize how important their infor
mation is," she noted.
The children sometimes sense these
needs more directly. "I signed up to learn
the clarinet, but they didn't have enough
clarinets," said Marc Jordan.
A spirit of giving is also reflected in the
activities the children take part in.
Each year, the students go on sever
al community service field trips, which
this summer have included visits to con
valescent homes such as the Sharon
Heights Senior Center and the Casa Olga
Senior Center, the Santa Clara Homeless
Shelter and the Palo Alto/Stanford Recy
cling Centers. On these trips the children
carry out various duties, ranging from as
sisting in the clean-up of an area to help
ing senior citizens move around in their
wheelchairs.
These field trips are also combined
with recreational and educational activi
ties for the children, such as swimming at
Mitchell Park and visiting a museum at
Golden Gate Park.
"It's more fun than regular school, way
more fun. We get two field trips in the
year, here we get one every week," said
student Marc Jordan. He and his friends
pointed out excitedly that Friday's final
excursion is a trip to the ballpark to see
the Giants play.
Scott, the Center's Executive Director,
is struck by the children's enthusiasm.
"By 6:55 a.m. there are students com
ing across the field to the program and by
8:30 they are in class playing chess, work
ing on model bridges, reading The Wall
Street Journal to see the value of their
pretend stock, quizzing each other with
trivia, and trying to get into the computer
room. And, of course, there are some on
the playground," said Scott
Scott, who became executive director in
February, knows first-han l the benefits
of the program, since her d Lighter partic
ipated in it before Scott was ever involved.
"This is such a marvelous service that
Condoleezza Rice, Susan Ford and the
Board have provided for the students. It's
a gift that we sorely need," added Scott.
She points out that the program com
plements the existing school programs by
taking strong students and encouraging
them. "They come to us, we polish them,
and increase their interest in education,"
said Scott.

Charlie Mae Knight, the Superinten
dent of the Ravenswood City School
District, which covers East Palo Alto,
couldn't be happier with what the Center
does. She is particularly pleased with the
inclusiveness of the program, noting that
the Center "serves all the youngsters and
recognizes diversity."
While many organizations in East Palo
Alto cater to specific ethnic groups such as
African-Americans, Latinos and Pacific
Islanders, Knight said that the Center for
a New Generation ensures that everybody
in the diverse community can participate.
"The Center recognizes that the com
munity is going through a transition and
they want to make sure that all the groups
are part of their program," said Knight.
Rather than being a private alternative
to the regular school program, Knight rec
ognizes the Center's activities as an im
portant partnership with the school dis
trict. The district provides free use of
classrooms at Menlo Oaks School for the
Center's activities and works with the
Center to provide the free lunches the
children in the program receive.
As proof of the benefits the Center pro
vides, Knight pointed out that the Center
produced the largest proportion of chil
dren in a Ravenswood District program to
pass the Golden State Algebra Test this
year.
"They consistently have the highest
number of children passing it because of
the extra tutoring. They do a great job in
math and science," added Knight.
Students at the Academy aren't the
only ones finding the Center's pro
grams an enriching experience. Sum
mer Academy teacher Vince Bohner, a
substitute teacher during the regular
school year, is enjoying his first long-term
teachingjob.
"It's a wonderful program. It gets kids
excited about math and language skills
and also makes art, drama, and music a
big part of it," said the 26-year-old
teacher.
Physical education teacher Jean Lam
son agreed, calling the program "awesome
and unbelievable."
"It takes the kids out of a traditional
classroom setting and puts them in a more
hands-on learning environment," said
Lamson. She also noted that it is a differ

ent experience from her regular teaching
duties because of the smaller class sizes
and better feedback she receives from the
students.
She noted that while the Academy does
include traditional team sports such as
basketball and volleyball in the curricu
lum, there is also a strong emphasis on
lifestyle education rather than simply
sharpening up athletic skills.
"We emphasize social skills, self-es
teem, and have lots of cooperative games,"
said Lamson. These activities include
partner activities and trust games, such
as a trust fall, where a student learns to
fall backward, confident that another stu
dent will catch them. "We want to build
trust and break down barriers that some
of these kids have," added Lamson.
The students' exciting summer term
ends Friday, but many say they plan to
apply again for the after-school program.
Others are grateful for the practical op
portunities the Academy has provided
them with this summer.
"It's been interesting and they teach
you more than regular school. It really
prepares you for the regular school year,"
said student Jennifer Selu, paintbrush in
hand, ready to add yet another artistic
work to the program's growing collection.

him or her the best possible chance to suc
ceed, but every child must understand
that America is strong because we can de
termine what we make of ourselves."
In addition to the Summer Academy,
the Center for a New Generation operates
a similar after-school program during the
regular school year. It also runs a Parent
Education Center which provides work
shops on parenting skills and parent in
volvement in schools, and, in collabora
tion with Canada College, provides early
childhood education classes and English
and Spanish language classes.

The programs are paid for through the
initial founding grants, some long-term fi
nancial commitments, and ongoing dona
tions, according to the Beverly Scott, the
Center's Executive Director. The Cen
ter's Operations Manager, Mia Jackson,
said that the organization runs all its pro
grams on an annual budget of approxi
mately $350,000 to $400,000.
Other foundations and corporations
supporting the Center include PG&E,
Intel, Hewlett-Packard, Hitachi, Applied
Materials, Transamerica, the Carnegie
Corporation Foundation and a large num
ber of individual donors, said Scott.
The program's instructors are paid,
but there are also some volunteers help
ing the Center, including several Stanford
students referred to the program by the
Haas Center for Public Service. Susan
Ford noted that several Cardinal football
players donated their time last year to
help tutor the children. The Center also
received a $15,000 donation from an exhi
bition NFL game played at Stanford Sta
dium last year between the San Francisco
49ers and the Los Angeles Raiders.
Operations Manager Jackson said that
the Center welcomes any donations of
money, time or ideas. "Sometimes people
don't realize how important their infor
mation is," she noted.
The children sometimes sense these
needs more directly. "I signed up to learn
the clarinet, but they didn't have enough
clarinets," said Marc Jordan.
A spirit of giving is also reflected in the
activities the children take part in.
Each year, the students go on sever
al community service field trips, which
this summer have included visits to con
valescent homes such as the Sharon
Heights Senior Center and the Casa Olga
Senior Center, the Santa Clara Homeless
Shelter and the Palo Alto/Stanford Recy
cling Centers. On these trips the children
carry out various duties, ranging from as
sisting in the clean-up of an area to help
ing senior citizens move around in their
wheelchairs.
These field trips are also combined
with recreational and educational activi
ties for the children, such as swimming at
Mitchell Park and visiting a museum at
Golden Gate Park.
"It's more fun than regular school, way
more fun. We get two field trips in the
year, here we get one every week," said
student Marc Jordan. He and his friends
pointed out excitedly that Friday's final
excursion is a trip to the ballpark to see
the Giants play.
Scott, the Center's Executive Director,
is struck by the children's enthusiasm.
"By 6:55 a.m. there are students com
ing across the field to the program and by
8:30 they are in class playing chess, work
ing on model bridges, reading The Wall
Street Journal to see the value of their
pretend stock, quizzing each other with
trivia, and trying to get into the computer
room. And, of course, there are some on
the playground," said Scott
Scott, who became executive director in
February, knows first-han l the benefits
of the program, since her d Lighter partic
ipated in it before Scott was ever involved.
"This is such a marvelous service that
Condoleezza Rice, Susan Ford and the
Board have provided for the students. It's
a gift that we sorely need," added Scott.
She points out that the program com
plements the existing school programs by
taking strong students and encouraging
them. "They come to us, we polish them,
and increase their interest in education,"
said Scott.

Charlie Mae Knight, the Superinten
dent of the Ravenswood City School
District, which covers East Palo Alto,
couldn't be happier with what the Center
does. She is particularly pleased with the
inclusiveness of the program, noting that
the Center "serves all the youngsters and
recognizes diversity."
While many organizations in East Palo
Alto cater to specific ethnic groups such as
African-Americans, Latinos and Pacific
Islanders, Knight said that the Center for
a New Generation ensures that everybody
in the diverse community can participate.
"The Center recognizes that the com
munity is going through a transition and
they want to make sure that all the groups
are part of their program," said Knight.
Rather than being a private alternative
to the regular school program, Knight rec
ognizes the Center's activities as an im
portant partnership with the school dis
trict. The district provides free use of
classrooms at Menlo Oaks School for the
Center's activities and works with the
Center to provide the free lunches the
children in the program receive.
As proof of the benefits the Center pro
vides, Knight pointed out that the Center
produced the largest proportion of chil
dren in a Ravenswood District program to
pass the Golden State Algebra Test this
year.
"They consistently have the highest
number of children passing it because of
the extra tutoring. They do a great job in
math and science," added Knight.
Students at the Academy aren't the
only ones finding the Center's pro
grams an enriching experience. Sum
mer Academy teacher Vince Bohner, a
substitute teacher during the regular
school year, is enjoying his first long-term
teachingjob.
"It's a wonderful program. It gets kids
excited about math and language skills
and also makes art, drama, and music a
big part of it," said the 26-year-old
teacher.
Physical education teacher Jean Lam
son agreed, calling the program "awesome
and unbelievable."
"It takes the kids out of a traditional
classroom setting and puts them in a more
hands-on learning environment," said
Lamson. She also noted that it is a differ

ent experience from her regular teaching
duties because of the smaller class sizes
and better feedback she receives from the
students.
She noted that while the Academy does
include traditional team sports such as
basketball and volleyball in the curricu
lum, there is also a strong emphasis on
lifestyle education rather than simply
sharpening up athletic skills.
"We emphasize social skills, self-es
teem, and have lots of cooperative games,"
said Lamson. These activities include
partner activities and trust games, such
as a trust fall, where a student learns to
fall backward, confident that another stu
dent will catch them. "We want to build
trust and break down barriers that some
of these kids have," added Lamson.
The students' exciting summer term
ends Friday, but many say they plan to
apply again for the after-school program.
Others are grateful for the practical op
portunities the Academy has provided
them with this summer.
"It's been interesting and they teach
you more than regular school. It really
prepares you for the regular school year,"
said student Jennifer Selu, paintbrush in
hand, ready to add yet another artistic
work to the program's growing collection.

It's a beautiful summer afternoon, but
Edilberto Fullido is sitting in a class
room â€” and enjoying it. Fullido, who
will enter the 7th grade this fall, is in sum
mer school. But this isn't a typical sum
mer school, thanks to a unique East Palo
Alto program co-founded by Stanford
University Provost Condoleezza Rice.
Fullido is a student in the Center for a
New Generation's Summer Enrichment
Academy, in which he and over 100 other
East Palo Alto sth-through-Bth graders
are spending six full weeks participating
in a balanced curriculum of academics,
arts and athletics.
On this sunny afternoon, Fullido is
busy with his friends and classmates Marc
Jordan and David Latu rehearsing their
lines for a drama presentation they wrote
and will act out at the end of the summer
program. Nearby, another group rehears
es their respective scene in the shade of a
tree outside a classroom at Menlo Oaks
School, where the Academy is centered.
"It beats sitting at home on a couch
watching television and gaining weight,"
notes Fullido as he reads his lines for his
scene, entitled "Fighting Is Not The An
swer."
"We never do this in the school year,"
adds Jordan, who will be entering the sth
grade in September.
In the classroom next door, fellow stu
dents are working on abstract paintings,
while in another classroQm others are
learning to play musical instruments.
The Summer Enrichment Academy is a
six-week program which began June
20 and ends July 29. Fullido, Jordan,
and Latu are among 108 East Palo Alto
students selected from schools in the
Ravenswood City School District to par
ticipate in the unique program. The chil
dren, who were chosen based on a mini
mum G.P. A. of 2.5 and a report of good be
havior from a teacher or their principal,
attend the classes and activities from 9:00
a.m. to 2:30 p.m.
In the morning, all the students partic
ipate in classes in one of two academic
cores. Some have chosen to enroll in a

course which emphasizes language arts,
journalism and computers, while others
are in one which teaches math, science
and computers. After a lunch provided by
the Center, the students take part in the
arts segment, where they choose whether
they would like to hone their creative tal
ents in instrumental or vocal music, dance
or arts and crafts. And, of course, the chil
dren look forward to the athletics portion
of the program, where they can take part
in games ranging from capture the flag, to
volleyball to basketball and everything in
between.
This is the third summer for the Acad
emy, a program created by Rice's
Center for a New Generation to com
plement the existing school programs in
East Palo Alto and to nurture the interest
in learning that many of the city's chil
dren have.
The Center itself was founded after
Condoleezza Rice suggested to several
friends that they do something to help im
poverished East Palo Alto, which has high
unemployment, school drop-out, and
crime rates.
In a July 1992 interview with the San
Jose Mercury News, the Alabama-born
Rice said that she was shocked "that I had
more opportunity in segregated Birming
ham than kids raised in modern-day Cali
fornia." Rice said she was inspired to cre
ate the Center after giving a graduation
speech to a class of East Palo Alto Bth
graders in 1991, shortly after her return
to Stanford from Washington, where she
had been a high-ranking foreign policy ad
viser to President Bush.
"I believe in getting things up and
running. If we could unify Germany in
less than a year, we can do just as well for
East Palo Alto," Rice told the Mercury
News.
Rice's friend and co-chair, Susan Ford
of the Ford Land Company, said that she
and her husband, a Republican Party ac
quaintance of Rice's, were approached by
Rice about starting some kind of philan
thropic endeavor, shortly after she gave
the East Palo Alto graduation speech.

According to Ford, Rice was fascinated
by the pageantry of the graduation cere
mony, especially since these students
were only graduating from the Bth grade.
"It seemed like such a big deal for the Bth
graders," said Ford, "but then Condoleezza
found out it was because a lot of them won't
see graduation from high school."
"We realized that a lot of these kids
may be interested in learning, but they
have no opportunity for academic en
hancement other than remedial summer
school," said Ford.
Rice approached Ravenswood City
.School District Superintendent Charlie
Mae Knight about ways to improve the
situation and, with help from the Fords
and others, created the Center for a New
Generation in December, 1991.
Rice donated $10,000 to the project, as
did the Ford Land Company. The Sun Mi
crosystems Foundation awarded a
$15,000 grant and the Carnegie Founda
tion gave $25,000. Rice continues to help
raise funds for the project and serves as a
co-chair for the Center.
Headquarted at East Palo Alto's Cesar
Chavez Academy, the Center per
forms supportive and educational
functions similar to those Rice received as
a child in Alabama, where her father
arranged for teachers to tutor neighbor
hood children after school. The Center's
goals were reflected in a speech Rice gave
at the 1992 Republican Convention in
Houston, where she said that "every child
must be convinced that America will give
him or her the best possible chance to suc
ceed, but every child must understand
that America is strong because we can de
termine what we make of ourselves."
In addition to the Summer Academy,
the Center for a New Generation operates

big part of it," said the 26-year-old
teacher.
Physical education teacher Jean Lam
son agreed, calling the program "awesome
and unbelievable."
"It takes the kids out of a traditional
classroom setting and puts them in a more
hands-on learning environment," said
Lamson. She also noted that it is a differ

ent experience from her regular teaching
duties because of the smaller class sizes
and better feedback she receives from the
students.
She noted that while the Academy does
include traditional team sports such as
basketball and volleyball in the curricu
lum, there is also a strong emphasis on
lifestyle education rather than simply
sharpening up athletic skills.
"We emphasize social skills, self-es
teem, and have lots of cooperative games,"
said Lamson. These activities include
partner activities and trust games, such
as a trust fall, where a student learns to
fall backward, confident that another stu
dent will catch them. "We want to build
trust and break down barriers that some
of these kids have," added Lamson.
The students' exciting summer term
ends Friday, but many say they plan to
apply again for the after-school program.
Others are grateful for the practical op
portunities the Academy has provided
them with this summer.
"It's been interesting and they teach
you more than regular school. It really
prepares you for the regular school year,"
said student Jennifer Selu, paintbrush in
hand, ready to add yet another artistic
work to the program's growing collection.

It's a beautiful summer afternoon, but
Edilberto Fullido is sitting in a class
room â€” and enjoying it. Fullido, who
will enter the 7th grade this fall, is in sum
mer school. But this isn't a typical sum
mer school, thanks to a unique East Palo
Alto program co-founded by Stanford
University Provost Condoleezza Rice.
Fullido is a student in the Center for a
New Generation's Summer Enrichment
Academy, in which he and over 100 other
East Palo Alto sth-through-Bth graders
are spending six full weeks participating
in a balanced curriculum of academics,
arts and athletics.
On this sunny afternoon, Fullido is
busy with his friends and classmates Marc
Jordan and David Latu rehearsing their
lines for a drama presentation they wrote
and will act out at the end of the summer
program. Nearby, another group rehears
es their respective scene in the shade of a
tree outside a classroom at Menlo Oaks
School, where the Academy is centered.
"It beats sitting at home on a couch
watching television and gaining weight,"
notes Fullido as he reads his lines for his
scene, entitled "Fighting Is Not The An
swer."
"We never do this in the school year,"
adds Jordan, who will be entering the sth
grade in September.
In the classroom next door, fellow stu
dents are working on abstract paintings,
while in another classroQm others are
learning to play musical instruments.
The Summer Enrichment Academy is a
six-week program which began June
20 and ends July 29. Fullido, Jordan,
and Latu are among 108 East Palo Alto
students selected from schools in the
Ravenswood City School District to par
ticipate in the unique program. The chil
dren, who were chosen based on a mini
mum G.P. A. of 2.5 and a report of good be
havior from a teacher or their principal,
attend the classes and activities from 9:00
a.m. to 2:30 p.m.
In the morning, all the students partic
ipate in classes in one of two academic
cores. Some have chosen to enroll in a

course which emphasizes language arts,
journalism and computers, while others
are in one which teaches math, science
and computers. After a lunch provided by
the Center, the students take part in the
arts segment, where they choose whether
they would like to hone their creative tal
ents in instrumental or vocal music, dance
or arts and crafts. And, of course, the chil
dren look forward to the athletics portion
of the program, where they can take part
in games ranging from capture the flag, to
volleyball to basketball and everything in
between.
This is the third summer for the Acad
emy, a program created by Rice's
Center for a New Generation to com
plement the existing school programs in
East Palo Alto and to nurture the interest
in learning that many of the city's chil
dren have.
The Center itself was founded after
Condoleezza Rice suggested to several
friends that they do something to help im
poverished East Palo Alto, which has high
unemployment, school drop-out, and
crime rates.
In a July 1992 interview with the San
Jose Mercury News, the Alabama-born
Rice said that she was shocked "that I had
more opportunity in segregated Birming
ham than kids raised in modern-day Cali
fornia." Rice said she was inspired to cre
ate the Center after giving a graduation
speech to a class of East Palo Alto Bth
graders in 1991, shortly after her return
to Stanford from Washington, where she
had been a high-ranking foreign policy ad
viser to President Bush.
"I believe in getting things up and
running. If we could unify Germany in
less than a year, we can do just as well for
East Palo Alto," Rice told the Mercury
News.
Rice's friend and co-chair, Susan Ford
of the Ford Land Company, said that she
and her husband, a Republican Party ac
quaintance of Rice's, were approached by
Rice about starting some kind of philan
thropic endeavor, shortly after she gave
the East Palo Alto graduation speech.

According to Ford, Rice was fascinated
by the pageantry of the graduation cere
mony, especially since these students
were only graduating from the Bth grade.
"It seemed like such a big deal for the Bth
graders," said Ford, "but then Condoleezza
found out it was because a lot of them won't
see graduation from high school."
"We realized that a lot of these kids
may be interested in learning, but they
have no opportunity for academic en
hancement other than remedial summer
school," said Ford.
Rice approached Ravenswood City
.School District Superintendent Charlie
Mae Knight about ways to improve the
situation and, with help from the Fords
and others, created the Center for a New
Generation in December, 1991.
Rice donated $10,000 to the project, as
did the Ford Land Company. The Sun Mi
crosystems Foundation awarded a
$15,000 grant and the Carnegie Founda
tion gave $25,000. Rice continues to help
raise funds for the project and serves as a
co-chair for the Center.
Headquarted at East Palo Alto's Cesar
Chavez Academy, the Center per
forms supportive and educational
functions similar to those Rice received as
a child in Alabama, where her father
arranged for teachers to tutor neighbor
hood children after school. The Center's
goals were reflected in a speech Rice gave
at the 1992 Republican Convention in
Houston, where she said that "every child
must be convinced that America will give
him or her the best possible chance to suc
ceed, but every child must understand
that America is strong because we can de
termine what we make of ourselves."
In addition to the Summer Academy,
the Center for a New Generation operates
a similar after-school program during the
regular school year. It also runs a Parent
Education Center which provides work
shops on parenting skills and parent in
volvement in schools, and, in collabora
tion with Canada College, provides early
childhood education classes and English
and Spanish language classes.

The programs are paid for through the
initial founding grants, some long-term fi
nancial commitments, and ongoing dona
tions, according to the Beverly Scott, the
Center's Executive Director. The Cen
ter's Operations Manager, Mia Jackson,
said that the organization runs all its pro
grams on an annual budget of approxi
mately $350,000 to $400,000.
Other foundations and corporations
supporting the Center include PG&E,
Intel, Hewlett-Packard, Hitachi, Applied
Materials, Transamerica, the Carnegie
Corporation Foundation and a large num
ber of individual donors, said Scott.
The program's instructors are paid,
but there are also some volunteers help
ing the Center, including several Stanford
students referred to the program by the
Haas Center for Public Service. Susan
Ford noted that several Cardinal football
players donated their time last year to
help tutor the children. The Center also
received a $15,000 donation from an exhi
bition NFL game played at Stanford Sta
dium last year between the San Francisco
49ers and the Los Angeles Raiders.
Operations Manager Jackson said that
the Center welcomes any donations of
money, time or ideas. "Sometimes people
don't realize how important their infor
mation is," she noted.
The children sometimes sense these
needs more directly. "I signed up to learn
the clarinet, but they didn't have enough
clarinets," said Marc Jordan.
A spirit of giving is also reflected in the
activities the children take part in.
Each year, the students go on sever
al community service field trips, which
this summer have included visits to con
valescent homes such as the Sharon
Heights Senior Center and the Casa Olga
Senior Center, the Santa Clara Homeless
Shelter and the Palo Alto/Stanford Recy
cling Centers. On these trips the children
carry out various duties, ranging from as
sisting in the clean-up of an area to help
ing senior citizens move around in their
wheelchairs.
These field trips are also combined
with recreational and educational activi
ties for the children, such as swimming at
Mitchell Park and visiting a museum at
Golden Gate Park.
"It's more fun than regular school, way
more fun. We get two field trips in the
year, here we get one every week," said
student Marc Jordan. He and his friends
pointed out excitedly that Friday's final
excursion is a trip to the ballpark to see
the Giants play.
Scott, the Center's Executive Director,
is struck by the children's enthusiasm.
"By 6:55 a.m. there are students com
ing across the field to the program and by
8:30 they are in class playing chess, work
ing on model bridges, reading The Wall
Street Journal to see the value of their
pretend stock, quizzing each other with
trivia, and trying to get into the computer
room. And, of course, there are some on
the playground," said Scott
Scott, who became executive director in
February, knows first-han l the benefits
of the program, since her d Lighter partic
ipated in it before Scott was ever involved.
"This is such a marvelous service that
Condoleezza Rice, Susan Ford and the
Board have provided for the students. It's
a gift that we sorely need," added Scott.
She points out that the program com
plements the existing school programs by
taking strong students and encouraging
them. "They come to us, we polish them,
and increase their interest in education,"
said Scott.

Charlie Mae Knight, the Superinten
dent of the Ravenswood City School
District, which covers East Palo Alto,
couldn't be happier with what the Center
does. She is particularly pleased with the
inclusiveness of the program, noting that
the Center "serves all the youngsters and
recognizes diversity."
While many organizations in East Palo
Alto cater to specific ethnic groups such as
African-Americans, Latinos and Pacific
Islanders, Knight said that the Center for
a New Generation ensures that everybody
in the diverse community can participate.
"The Center recognizes that the com
munity is going through a transition and
they want to make sure that all the groups
are part of their program," said Knight.
Rather than being a private alternative
to the regular school program, Knight rec
ognizes the Center's activities as an im
portant partnership with the school dis
trict. The district provides free use of
classrooms at Menlo Oaks School for the
Center's activities and works with the
Center to provide the free lunches the
children in the program receive.
As proof of the benefits the Center pro
vides, Knight pointed out that the Center
produced the largest proportion of chil
dren in a Ravenswood District program to
pass the Golden State Algebra Test this
year.
"They consistently have the highest
number of children passing it because of
the extra tutoring. They do a great job in
math and science," added Knight.
Students at the Academy aren't the
only ones finding the Center's pro
grams an enriching experience. Sum
mer Academy teacher Vince Bohner, a
substitute teacher during the regular
school year, is enjoying his first long-term
teachingjob.
"It's a wonderful program. It gets kids
excited about math and language skills
and also makes art, drama, and music a
big part of it," said the 26-year-old
teacher.
Physical education teacher Jean Lam
son agreed, calling the program "awesome

"It takes the kids out of a traditional

Lamson. She also noted that it is a differ

basketball and volleyball in the curricu
