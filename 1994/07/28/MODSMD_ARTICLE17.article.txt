## Crime on Campus Recent attacks serve as yet another reminder that the Farm is not an Ivory Tower 
### Holly Blumenthal 
In light of the two violent
crimes committed recent
ly on campus, members of
the Stanford community
have reason to question the safety
they have taken for granted for so
long.
If you're a bicycle, possessions
in an unlocked dorm room, or a
woman walking alone, chances are
you are in danger here. Although
Stanford enjoys a limited immuni
ty from the crimes that seem to
happen daily just across Highway
101 in East Palo Alto, criminal ac
tivities occur here among the
white-washed adobe and eucalyp
tus trees as well.
According to Stanford Depart
ment of Public Safety statistics,
the most common crime on cam
pus, by far, is bicycle theft. Other
types of theft, including burglaries
and vehicle theft, also occur fre
quently. Violent crimes are much
less common, although sexual of
fenses ranging from obscene
phone calls to stalking and rape at
tempts occur with more frequency
than other kinds of assault, police
said. Muggings are rare; computer
thefts are ordinary.
During the summer, property
crime rates go down, said Sgt.
John McMullen of the Stanford
Police. But, according to Trace
Shapiro, coordinator for the Sexu
al Assault Prevention Program,
the potential for assault increases
during the summer because stu
dents don't know each other as
well and the community as a
whole is smaller and less likely to
spot a crime in progress.
The recent armed robbery in
the Coffee House and sexual as
sault in the woods near the Oval,
while still highly unusual, con
form to another general crime
trend noted by McMullen.
"Crime is up this year, with a
rise especially in violent crimes,"
he said. He pointed out that this
year has so far seen two robberies
as opposed to three for all of 1993.
McMullen said that these fig
ures are still low for a community
of Stanford's size, a fact borne out
by a recent work, "Crime at Col
lege: the Student Guide to Public
Safety," which ranked Stanford's
campus among the 15 safest in a
study of 58 schools.
However, McMullen said it is
clear that crime on campus in on
the upswing, and that many of
these crimes occur in part because
students feel that crime cannot
reach them in the University. Mc-
Mullen said awareness of the na
ture of common crimes and what
can be done to avoid them may
lower Stanford's crime rate.
Thefts
In this vein, although armed
robberies such as that at the Cof
fee House grab the headlines, they
occur very rarely compared to
campus break-ins and the bike
and car thefts that are reported al
most daily to the police. McMullen
said that while 829 bikes were re
ported stolen in 1993, the actual
number of thefts was probably
double that.
"People don't bother to lock
them, or lock them with a crummy
lock," he said.
He added that people don't
bother to lock their cars either,
leading to numerous vehicle thefts.

And even more seriously, students
often leave their dorms unlocked,
encouraging what McMullen called
"crimes of opportunity."
"We had a guy coming in at
night, while students slept, and
taking stuff off desks," he said.
"One kid woke up — the burglar
held a knife to his throat."
Burglary accounted for 500 po
lice reports in 1992 and 178 in the
first half of 1993, statistics consis
tent with the previous four years.
Sources of danger
Although thefts constitute the
bulk of reported crimes at Stanford,
violent crimes do occur — witness
the two incidents earlier this month.

These crimes can take place any
where, but certain situations seem
especially conducive to attacks.
The number-one culprit in
abetting violent crime is also one of
Stanford's greatest resources: its
beautiful wooded countryside. The
rolling hills and shaded wilderness
woven through the campus gives
Stanford a special beauty, but
these isolated areas can also pro
vide cover for criminals.
Many of the stalkings and sexu
al assaults over the past four years
have taken place in the Foothills
or other wilderness areas on cam
pus. Even areas close to the busy
center of campus are not exempt
from danger, as the July 17 attack
near Roth Way attests.
"I see young ladies jogging in
the summer, alone in these isolat
ed areas, and it bothers me," Mc-
Mullen said.
Danger can also come in the
form of "having a good time," as
fraternity parties are notorious
for occasional rowdy activities. Al
though alcohol doesn't flow like it
used to, McMullen said, drinking
still occurs at these parties, some
times leading to violence.
"One year, at a frat party, a
bunch of guys got drunk and beat
up another kid — kicked him in

the side and broke all his ribs,
piercing his lung," he said.
McMullen added that these
kinds of incidents are on the de
cline, in large part because "fra
ternities are becoming more re
sponsible."
Other crimes often reported
after fraternity parties include
sexual assault and vandalism.
These range from date-rape situa
tions to an incident in 1989 involv
ing a member of a campus frater
nity and a 14-year-old girl, and
from common anti-Cal vandalism
to the recent defacing of the Gay
Liberation statue.
Another opportunity for alco
hol to flow — and crime to be com-

mitted — comes in the form of
sporting events on campus. But
McMullen said crime is noticeably
rarer these days at football games.
"When I first came here, foot
ball games were problematic," he
said. "When people brought in al
cohol, they didn't bring in a little,
they brought in a lot — by half
time they were smashed. We made
10 to 15 arrests every [football
game] in the early '80s."
Now that alcohol is illegal in
the stadium, the police make per
haps 15 arrests a season, Mc-
Mullen said.
Even the World Cup events,
which were expected to wreak
havoc in terms of crime, were com
paratively peaceful. "We had 28 ar
rests at the World Cup, and eight
other related arrests — a lot of that
was the security people!" Mc-
Mullen said. "Most of it was minor,
like burglaries and disorder."
Other events that used to carry
a reputation for violation, like
campus concerts, have also
calmed down considerably. "Con
certs have been pretty mellow
since the Grateful Dead left," said
McMullen.
Beyond crowded events, the
home itself can be a source of vio
lence for some members of the

Stanford community, McMullen
said. Domestic violence occurs on
campus, although the rate of do
mestic violence reports has gone
down considerable from 1985,
when 22 cases were reported. In
1990, the last year for which sta
tistics are available, only eight re
ports were filed.
"Domestic violence has gone
down with education," said Mc-
Mullen. "A lot of cases involved
different cultures, couples from a
different country, where hitting
each other might be acceptable —
there, but not here."
He said violence in the home
can involve both spouses. "One
hits the other, the other one drags

the spouse out the door, and so
forth."
But violent crime committed by
Stanford students, faculty and
staff is relatively rare, according
to Department of Public Safety
statistics. Last year, no students
were implicated in any of the sex
offenses, robberies or aggravated
assaults reported on campus.
Only one of the campus' burglar
ies involved a student. By con
trast, almost a quarter of alcohol
offenses were committed by stu
dents.
"Students do everything from
the petty to the serious," said Mc-
Mullen. "They steal credit cards
and commit sexual assault. But
most of the violent crimes
are by outsiders."
Protecting yourself
Many thefts and even violent
crimes can be prevented with a lit
tle foresight. McMullen urged stu
dents to use common sense and
keep in mind that although Stan
ford is safer than most cities,
crime can and does occur.
• Especially in light of the re
cent attack, use caution when
traveling around the campus. In
formation released jointly by the
Sexual Assault Prevention Pro

gram, C-SARET and the Stanford
Police provides common-sense
tips; their advice is to not walk
alone, particularly after dark,
avoid unoccupied areas, even in
the daytime, and avoid poorly-lit
areas at night.
• Another tip is to use the sug
gested travel routes given by the
Stanford Safety Map; these routes
are more frequently traveled and
better-lit than other avenues.
Safety maps are available at
Tresidder Union, the Stanford
Bookstore, the Post Office, Memo
rial Church, and the Quad. They
are also printed in the Stanford Di
rectory and the Stanford Almanac.
• When you approach your car
or residence, have your keys
ready. Walk past your destination
and then turn around and walk
back in order to survey your envi
ronment. Check your car before
you enter, as criminals have been
known to lie in wait inside.
• If you wear expensive jewelry,
either remove it as you travel, or
turn rings around so only a simple
band is showing. Don't carry large
sums of money and don't display
money openly.
• To prevent burglaries and
thefts, remember to lock your
doors, lock your cars and lock your
bikes. It doesn't take long for an
accomplished thief to find whatev
er valuables that you think are
well-hidden.
"I could go into Rains and Es
condido right now and take a lot of
stuff," McMullen said. "People
leave doors to offices open during
lunch and leave their bikes un
locked for a few minutes."
• Wherever you are, be aware of
your surroundings. Students are
often lulled by the beauty of the
campus and the sunny weather
into abandoning cautious in
stincts. Notice your surroundings
and people nearby. If a situation
feels suspicious or threatening,
change directions, go to a populat
ed area, call a friend to meet you or
call 9-911 on-campus and 911 off
campus.
• In a threatening situation,
screaming or yelling can deter po
tential attackers and draw the at
tention of people nearby. Carrying a
whistle or hand-held siren can help.
• If you are attacked, or your
property is stolen, call the police
immediately. If a crime goes unre
ported, a criminal may attack
again, and someone else's bike will
get stolen — or worse, someone
else may be assaulted. Make sure
to report any suspicious persons,
vehicles, or activities to the police.
• Self-defense classes can give
you an edge over would-be attack
ers. Most attackers rely on the
shock of an unexpected assault to
paralyze their victims. Self-de
fense classes teach reflexive defen
sive attitudes and effective defen
sive responses to an attack.
A convenient resource for self
defense classes is The Sexual As
sault Prevention Program, which
will offer self-defense workshops
on campus Aug. 6, 7, 13 and 14
from 11 a.m. to 2:30 p.m; in addi
tion, Women Defending Ourselves
offers 9-week self-defense courses
in the autumn.
The bottom line is: be aware,
both of the sources of danger to you
as a Stanford affiliate, and of what
you can do to avoid that danger.
