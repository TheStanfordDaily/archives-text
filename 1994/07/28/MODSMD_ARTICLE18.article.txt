# RIDING OFF INTO THE SUNSET...
## JIM LARXMORE 
### BY PATRICIA HENLEY 
There are framed American
Indian posters on the walls of Jim
Larimore's office, as well as per
sonal items scattered throughout
the room. There are also two
empty boxes on the floor, into
which Larimore will pack up his
belongings by Friday, his last day
as director of Stanford's Ameri
can Indian Program.
Larimore said that when he
began the job in 1985, it was four
months before he brought any
pictures or other personal items
into his office.
"I think in part it was really a
reflection of my own uncertainty
about whether or not it was going
to be possible to develop a pro
gram that I'd feel good about
here," Larimore said. "My own
ambivalence manifested itself in
this box of things staying by the
doorway at home but never mak
ing it to the office."
As he now packs his belong
ings in preparation for his depar
ture, any uncertainty Larimore,
34, may have felt about his abili
ty to bring his personal touch to
the job of director should be gone
after nine years on the job.
Larimore, a Comanche, has
worked with members of the
Stanford community to overhaul
the recruitment process of and
create orientation programs and
improve cultural support for Na
tive American students.
These efforts have paid off.
Under Larimore's guidance,
Stanford's Native American com
munity has tripled to more than
190 students, and the graduation
rate is an outstanding 90 percent
— compared to a nationwide av
erage of 10 percent.
Rick Yuen, director of the
Asian American Center, has
worked closely with Larimore
and said he has seen significant
development in the Native Amer
ican Program over the years.
"I think that probably we're at
the cutting edge in the nation,"

Yuen said. "I know that term is
used sometimes too often at this
University, but Jim truly is at the
cutting edge in his work with the
Native American Program here
at Stanford."
Not just Native American stu
dents, Yuen said, but the entire
campus has benefited from Lari
more's efforts.
"I think he really is a spiritual
leader for the Stanford communi
ty as a whole," Yuen said. "I know
that there's been a number of ac
tivities which the University has
adopted that Jim has either de
veloped or suggested. This is in
cluded in residential education
training. It's included in Orienta
tion programs. You can find
Jim's character and persona in
each of these."
Further indication of Lari
more's character is evident in his
relationships with students.
Powtawche Williams, a Choctaw
and a Stanford junior, has only
praise for Larimore.
"He really extends his hand
and his heart and his mind,"
Williams said. "He doesn't really
have that barrier or that formal
image. He's the type of person
where you can just walk in and
say, 'Hey, do you have a minute,
can we talk?' and he'll be glad to
put things aside for a minute for
you."
In addition to his approacha
bility, Larimore is known for his
gentle teasing. This spring, stu
dents paid Larimore back. Un
suspectingly, Larimore agreed to
help make Indian fry bread for
200 people for the annual faculty
dinner. Late for the event, he ar
rived covered with smoke and
grease. As he took his seat, the
sign saying "Welcome to the Fac
ulty Dinner" was removed, re
vealing a second sign announcing
a farewell dinner — and comedy
roast — with Larimore as the
guest of honor.
"That was great because he

never thinks he can be the butt of
a joke," Williams said, grinning
broadly. Larimore agreed that
the night was a fun surprise.
"I think within our communi
ty I've had a reputation for teas
ing people a lot, so people gra
ciously paid me back — very gen
erously," Larimore said, laugh
ing.
On a more serious level,
Williams feels that Larimore's
commitment can be seen in his ef
forts for the Stanford Powwow,
an annual event which brings
more than 20,000 people to the
campus for a weekend of Native
American cultural celebration.
Larimore has been an important
figure in organizing this com
bined social, cultural and spiritu
al weekend.
"The whole Powwow is run
and organized by students, and
there's no other so-called adult
figure," Williams said. "He's the
one that steps in, and he's there
on-call 24 hours. Sometimes he'll
stay there all day. He does what
needs to be done. He always finds
a way to help out."
In addition to these efforts,
another part of Larimore's per
sonal imprint on the program is
his refusal to accept sole credit.
"The thing I feel best about is
that I don't feel that I've person
ally done much of it,"he said.
"But what I've helped to do is to
bring together some really excep
tional people and to try and gar
ner the resources that would
make it possible for them to ac
complish some things."
These accomplishments have
been made with limited resources
and funding. Larimore regrets
that the University's commit
ment to ethnic programs has not
led to a general operating budget
to cover the full costs of the
American Indian Program. The
discretionary funding has not in
creased to meet the growing stu
dent population, he said.
The efforts of all the ethnic
centers deserve financial sup
port, Larimore added, because
they benefit the entire Stanford
community.
"If we are trying to prepare
Stanford students in general for
lives of leadership and commit
ment, we have to think about
what that future is going to look
like," Larimore said. All stu
dents face a future — in Califor

nia and throughout the country
— working with and leading
groups of people characterized
by their diversity, he said. Eth
nic centers provide all students
with access to diverse programs,
conferences, presentations and
speakers.
The value of diversity is un
dermined by recent suggestions
that Stanford should return to
using an American Indian as a
sports mascot, Larimore said.
While only a group of alumni may
be making this request, he said,
the idea of an Indian mascot is
disruptive to the educational ex
perience of all of Stanford's Na
tive American students.
Larimore pointed out that the
Indian mascot was removed in
1972, not because of outside agi
tation, but as the result of a series
of quiet, respectful conversations
between Native American stu
dents and then-president
Richard Lyman.
"What I would personally say
to folks that favor the return of
the mascot is that they should
look inside themselves, to think
about why this is so important to
them," Larimore said. "I think
they should consider the reasons
why the mascot was done away
with, and really work to under
stand that."
Objections to the mascot, Lari
more said, include the fact that it
is inappropriate to use a race of
people as a symbol for entertain
ment and the actions of the for
mer mascot made a mockery of
dances that have religious and
spiritual significance to Native
American people.
He also challenged the idea of
returning the Stanford Indian by
questioning hypothetical mas
cots such as the University of
California Negroes or the San
Diego State Caucasians. "Would
it be appropriate for the Stanford
band to take the field dressed as
Catholic priests and nuns, swing
ing crucifixes?" he asked.
Despite the Stanford Indian
question and the many other
problems he faced, Larimore has
fond memories of the develop
ment of Stanford's Native Amer
ican community while he was di
rector.
The first few years were an ex
citing grass-roots effort, he said,
focused on what community
members could accomplish

through their own efforts. Later,
the development of Muwekma-
Tah-Ruk, the Native American
theme house meant coordinating
efforts with other people on cam
pus and in the local Native Amer
ican community.
Once the house was established
in 1988, Larimore was the first
resident fellow. Both Indian and
non-Indian students live in the
house, and Larimore remembers
the first years as "an important
time for us to be able to spend time
together as people and explore
similarities and differences."
So with such an impressive
story of the development of the
community, why is Larimore
leaving his position?
"I was a kid when I got here. I
feel much older now," Larimore
said laughing. He pointed out
that the new director will come in
with fresh energy and ideas.
After nine years of intense effort,
Larimore is ready to let someone
else become the main catalyst for
Stanford's Native American com
munity.
Larimore, however, will re
main on campus as a graduate
student in the doctoral program
in education. Specializing in
higher education and organiza
tion development, he will focus
on how colleges and universities
respond to rapidly diversifying
student populations. The impor
tant issue, he said, is celebrating
the plurality of cultures while
creating a sense of community.
Larimore's interest in commu
nity is what originally drew him
to become director of Stanford's
American Indian Program, and it
is what is now drawing him out
the door, his box of personal
items in his arms. He sees his ef
forts as director as just one part
of all that has been accomplished
by the Stanford community since
the Stanford American Indian
Organization was first estab
lished in 1970.
"This has been a place for na
tive students, where people have
been able to come to Stanford, get
a great education, and really set
themselves up on a trajectory of
achievement for things that they
want to do to improve their lives
and the lives of other people in
the future," Larimore said. "Not
to sound too corny, but it's a
place where people's dreams are
born."

which Larimore will pack up his
belongings by Friday, his last day
as director of Stanford's Ameri
can Indian Program.
Larimore said that when he
began the job in 1985, it was four
months before he brought any
pictures or other personal items
into his office.
"I think in part it was really a
reflection of my own uncertainty
about whether or not it was going
to be possible to develop a pro
gram that I'd feel good about
here," Larimore said. "My own
ambivalence manifested itself in
this box of things staying by the
doorway at home but never mak
ing it to the office."
As he now packs his belong
ings in preparation for his depar
ture, any uncertainty Larimore,
34, may have felt about his abili
ty to bring his personal touch to
the job of director should be gone
after nine years on the job.
Larimore, a Comanche, has
worked with members of the
Stanford community to overhaul
the recruitment process of and
create orientation programs and
improve cultural support for Na
tive American students.
These efforts have paid off.
Under Larimore's guidance,
Stanford's Native American com
munity has tripled to more than
190 students, and the graduation
rate is an outstanding 90 percent
— compared to a nationwide av
erage of 10 percent.
Rick Yuen, director of the
Asian American Center, has
worked closely with Larimore
and said he has seen significant
development in the Native Amer
ican Program over the years.
"I think that probably we're at
the cutting edge in the nation,"

Yuen said. "I know that term is
used sometimes too often at this
University, but Jim truly is at the
cutting edge in his work with the
Native American Program here
at Stanford."
Not just Native American stu
dents, Yuen said, but the entire
campus has benefited from Lari
more's efforts.
"I think he really is a spiritual
leader for the Stanford communi
ty as a whole," Yuen said. "I know
that there's been a number of ac
tivities which the University has
adopted that Jim has either de
veloped or suggested. This is in
cluded in residential education
training. It's included in Orienta
tion programs. You can find
Jim's character and persona in
each of these."
Further indication of Lari
more's character is evident in his
relationships with students.
Powtawche Williams, a Choctaw
and a Stanford junior, has only
praise for Larimore.
"He really extends his hand
and his heart and his mind,"
Williams said. "He doesn't really
have that barrier or that formal
image. He's the type of person
where you can just walk in and
say, 'Hey, do you have a minute,
can we talk?' and he'll be glad to
put things aside for a minute for
you."
In addition to his approacha
bility, Larimore is known for his
gentle teasing. This spring, stu
dents paid Larimore back. Un
suspectingly, Larimore agreed to
help make Indian fry bread for
200 people for the annual faculty
dinner. Late for the event, he ar
rived covered with smoke and
grease. As he took his seat, the
sign saying "Welcome to the Fac
ulty Dinner" was removed, re
vealing a second sign announcing
a farewell dinner — and comedy
roast — with Larimore as the
guest of honor.
"That was great because he

never thinks he can be the butt of
a joke," Williams said, grinning
broadly. Larimore agreed that
the night was a fun surprise.
"I think within our communi
ty I've had a reputation for teas
ing people a lot, so people gra
ciously paid me back — very gen
erously," Larimore said, laugh
ing.
On a more serious level,
Williams feels that Larimore's
commitment can be seen in his ef
forts for the Stanford Powwow,
an annual event which brings
more than 20,000 people to the
campus for a weekend of Native
American cultural celebration.
Larimore has been an important
figure in organizing this com
bined social, cultural and spiritu
al weekend.
"The whole Powwow is run
and organized by students, and
there's no other so-called adult
figure," Williams said. "He's the
one that steps in, and he's there
on-call 24 hours. Sometimes he'll
stay there all day. He does what
needs to be done. He always finds
a way to help out."
In addition to these efforts,
another part of Larimore's per
sonal imprint on the program is
his refusal to accept sole credit.
"The thing I feel best about is
that I don't feel that I've person
ally done much of it,"he said.
"But what I've helped to do is to
bring together some really excep
tional people and to try and gar
ner the resources that would
make it possible for them to ac
complish some things."
These accomplishments have
been made with limited resources
and funding. Larimore regrets
that the University's commit
ment to ethnic programs has not
led to a general operating budget
to cover the full costs of the
American Indian Program. The
discretionary funding has not in
creased to meet the growing stu
dent population, he said.
The efforts of all the ethnic
centers deserve financial sup
port, Larimore added, because
they benefit the entire Stanford
community.
"If we are trying to prepare
Stanford students in general for
lives of leadership and commit
ment, we have to think about
what that future is going to look
like," Larimore said. All stu
dents face a future — in Califor

nia and throughout the country
— working with and leading
groups of people characterized
by their diversity, he said. Eth
nic centers provide all students
with access to diverse programs,
conferences, presentations and
speakers.
The value of diversity is un
dermined by recent suggestions
that Stanford should return to
using an American Indian as a
sports mascot, Larimore said.
While only a group of alumni may
be making this request, he said,
the idea of an Indian mascot is
disruptive to the educational ex
perience of all of Stanford's Na
tive American students.
Larimore pointed out that the
Indian mascot was removed in
1972, not because of outside agi
tation, but as the result of a series
of quiet, respectful conversations
between Native American stu
dents and then-president
Richard Lyman.
"What I would personally say
to folks that favor the return of
the mascot is that they should
look inside themselves, to think
about why this is so important to
them," Larimore said. "I think
they should consider the reasons
why the mascot was done away
with, and really work to under
stand that."
Objections to the mascot, Lari
more said, include the fact that it
is inappropriate to use a race of
people as a symbol for entertain
ment and the actions of the for
mer mascot made a mockery of
dances that have religious and
spiritual significance to Native
American people.
He also challenged the idea of
returning the Stanford Indian by
questioning hypothetical mas
cots such as the University of
California Negroes or the San
Diego State Caucasians. "Would
it be appropriate for the Stanford
band to take the field dressed as
Catholic priests and nuns, swing
ing crucifixes?" he asked.
Despite the Stanford Indian
question and the many other
problems he faced, Larimore has
fond memories of the develop
ment of Stanford's Native Amer
ican community while he was di
rector.
The first few years were an ex
citing grass-roots effort, he said,
focused on what community
members could accomplish

through their own efforts. Later,
the development of Muwekma-
Tah-Ruk, the Native American
theme house meant coordinating
efforts with other people on cam
pus and in the local Native Amer
ican community.
Once the house was established
in 1988, Larimore was the first
resident fellow. Both Indian and
non-Indian students live in the
house, and Larimore remembers
the first years as "an important
time for us to be able to spend time
together as people and explore
similarities and differences."
So with such an impressive
story of the development of the
community, why is Larimore
leaving his position?
"I was a kid when I got here. I
feel much older now," Larimore
said laughing. He pointed out
that the new director will come in
with fresh energy and ideas.
After nine years of intense effort,
Larimore is ready to let someone
else become the main catalyst for
Stanford's Native American com
munity.
Larimore, however, will re
main on campus as a graduate
student in the doctoral program
in education. Specializing in
higher education and organiza
tion development, he will focus
on how colleges and universities
respond to rapidly diversifying
student populations. The impor
tant issue, he said, is celebrating
the plurality of cultures while
creating a sense of community.
Larimore's interest in commu
nity is what originally drew him
to become director of Stanford's
American Indian Program, and it
is what is now drawing him out
the door, his box of personal
items in his arms. He sees his ef
forts as director as just one part
of all that has been accomplished
by the Stanford community since
the Stanford American Indian
Organization was first estab
lished in 1970.
"This has been a place for na
tive students, where people have
been able to come to Stanford, get
a great education, and really set
themselves up on a trajectory of
achievement for things that they
want to do to improve their lives
and the lives of other people in
the future," Larimore said. "Not
to sound too corny, but it's a
place where people's dreams are
born."

months before he brought any
pictures or other personal items
into his office.
"I think in part it was really a
reflection of my own uncertainty
about whether or not it was going
to be possible to develop a pro
gram that I'd feel good about
here," Larimore said. "My own
ambivalence manifested itself in
this box of things staying by the
doorway at home but never mak
ing it to the office."
As he now packs his belong
ings in preparation for his depar
ture, any uncertainty Larimore,
34, may have felt about his abili
ty to bring his personal touch to
the job of director should be gone
after nine years on the job.
Larimore, a Comanche, has
worked with members of the
Stanford community to overhaul
the recruitment process of and
create orientation programs and
improve cultural support for Na
tive American students.
These efforts have paid off.
Under Larimore's guidance,
Stanford's Native American com
munity has tripled to more than
190 students, and the graduation
rate is an outstanding 90 percent
— compared to a nationwide av
erage of 10 percent.
Rick Yuen, director of the
Asian American Center, has
worked closely with Larimore
and said he has seen significant
development in the Native Amer
ican Program over the years.
"I think that probably we're at
the cutting edge in the nation,"

Yuen said. "I know that term is
used sometimes too often at this
University, but Jim truly is at the
cutting edge in his work with the
Native American Program here
at Stanford."
Not just Native American stu
dents, Yuen said, but the entire
campus has benefited from Lari
more's efforts.
"I think he really is a spiritual
leader for the Stanford communi
ty as a whole," Yuen said. "I know
that there's been a number of ac
tivities which the University has
adopted that Jim has either de
veloped or suggested. This is in
cluded in residential education
training. It's included in Orienta
tion programs. You can find
Jim's character and persona in
each of these."
Further indication of Lari
more's character is evident in his
relationships with students.
Powtawche Williams, a Choctaw
and a Stanford junior, has only
praise for Larimore.
"He really extends his hand
and his heart and his mind,"
Williams said. "He doesn't really
have that barrier or that formal
image. He's the type of person
where you can just walk in and
say, 'Hey, do you have a minute,
can we talk?' and he'll be glad to
put things aside for a minute for
you."
In addition to his approacha
bility, Larimore is known for his
gentle teasing. This spring, stu
dents paid Larimore back. Un
suspectingly, Larimore agreed to
help make Indian fry bread for
200 people for the annual faculty
dinner. Late for the event, he ar
rived covered with smoke and
grease. As he took his seat, the
sign saying "Welcome to the Fac
ulty Dinner" was removed, re
vealing a second sign announcing
a farewell dinner — and comedy
roast — with Larimore as the
guest of honor.
"That was great because he

never thinks he can be the butt of
a joke," Williams said, grinning
broadly. Larimore agreed that
the night was a fun surprise.
"I think within our communi
ty I've had a reputation for teas
ing people a lot, so people gra
ciously paid me back — very gen
erously," Larimore said, laugh
ing.
On a more serious level,
Williams feels that Larimore's
commitment can be seen in his ef
forts for the Stanford Powwow,
an annual event which brings
more than 20,000 people to the
campus for a weekend of Native
American cultural celebration.
Larimore has been an important
figure in organizing this com
bined social, cultural and spiritu
al weekend.
"The whole Powwow is run
and organized by students, and
there's no other so-called adult
figure," Williams said. "He's the
one that steps in, and he's there
on-call 24 hours. Sometimes he'll
stay there all day. He does what
needs to be done. He always finds
a way to help out."
In addition to these efforts,
another part of Larimore's per
sonal imprint on the program is
his refusal to accept sole credit.
"The thing I feel best about is
that I don't feel that I've person
ally done much of it,"he said.
"But what I've helped to do is to
bring together some really excep
tional people and to try and gar
ner the resources that would
make it possible for them to ac
complish some things."
These accomplishments have
been made with limited resources
and funding. Larimore regrets
that the University's commit
ment to ethnic programs has not
led to a general operating budget
to cover the full costs of the
American Indian Program. The
discretionary funding has not in
creased to meet the growing stu
dent population, he said.
The efforts of all the ethnic
centers deserve financial sup
port, Larimore added, because
they benefit the entire Stanford
community.
"If we are trying to prepare
Stanford students in general for
lives of leadership and commit
ment, we have to think about
what that future is going to look
like," Larimore said. All stu
dents face a future — in Califor

nia and throughout the country
— working with and leading
groups of people characterized
by their diversity, he said. Eth
nic centers provide all students
with access to diverse programs,
conferences, presentations and
speakers.
The value of diversity is un
dermined by recent suggestions
that Stanford should return to
using an American Indian as a
sports mascot, Larimore said.
While only a group of alumni may
be making this request, he said,
the idea of an Indian mascot is
disruptive to the educational ex
perience of all of Stanford's Na
tive American students.
Larimore pointed out that the
Indian mascot was removed in
1972, not because of outside agi
tation, but as the result of a series
of quiet, respectful conversations
between Native American stu
dents and then-president
Richard Lyman.
"What I would personally say
to folks that favor the return of
the mascot is that they should
look inside themselves, to think
about why this is so important to
them," Larimore said. "I think
they should consider the reasons
why the mascot was done away
with, and really work to under
stand that."
Objections to the mascot, Lari
more said, include the fact that it
is inappropriate to use a race of
people as a symbol for entertain
ment and the actions of the for
mer mascot made a mockery of
dances that have religious and
spiritual significance to Native
American people.
He also challenged the idea of
returning the Stanford Indian by
questioning hypothetical mas
cots such as the University of
California Negroes or the San
Diego State Caucasians. "Would
it be appropriate for the Stanford
band to take the field dressed as
Catholic priests and nuns, swing
ing crucifixes?" he asked.
Despite the Stanford Indian
question and the many other
problems he faced, Larimore has
fond memories of the develop
ment of Stanford's Native Amer
ican community while he was di
rector.
The first few years were an ex
citing grass-roots effort, he said,
focused on what community
members could accomplish

through their own efforts. Later,
the development of Muwekma-
Tah-Ruk, the Native American
theme house meant coordinating
efforts with other people on cam
pus and in the local Native Amer
ican community.
Once the house was established
in 1988, Larimore was the first
resident fellow. Both Indian and
non-Indian students live in the
house, and Larimore remembers
the first years as "an important
time for us to be able to spend time
together as people and explore
similarities and differences."
So with such an impressive
story of the development of the
community, why is Larimore
leaving his position?
"I was a kid when I got here. I
feel much older now," Larimore
said laughing. He pointed out
that the new director will come in
with fresh energy and ideas.
After nine years of intense effort,
Larimore is ready to let someone
else become the main catalyst for
Stanford's Native American com
munity.
Larimore, however, will re
main on campus as a graduate
student in the doctoral program
in education. Specializing in
higher education and organiza
tion development, he will focus
on how colleges and universities
respond to rapidly diversifying
student populations. The impor
tant issue, he said, is celebrating
the plurality of cultures while
creating a sense of community.
Larimore's interest in commu
nity is what originally drew him
to become director of Stanford's
American Indian Program, and it
is what is now drawing him out
the door, his box of personal
items in his arms. He sees his ef
forts as director as just one part
of all that has been accomplished
by the Stanford community since
the Stanford American Indian
Organization was first estab
lished in 1970.
"This has been a place for na
tive students, where people have
been able to come to Stanford, get
a great education, and really set
themselves up on a trajectory of
achievement for things that they
want to do to improve their lives
and the lives of other people in
the future," Larimore said. "Not
to sound too corny, but it's a
place where people's dreams are
born."
