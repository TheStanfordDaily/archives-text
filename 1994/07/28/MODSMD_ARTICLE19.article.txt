# A worthy successor
## Shendo to head Stanford's Native American Program 
### Patricia Henley 
After a rigorous selection
process, Benny Shendo has
been chosen as the new assis
tant dean of students and direc
tor of the American Indian Pro
gram at Stanford. He will begin
his duties Sept. 6.
Shendo, a Jemez Pueblo,
comes to Stanford after four
years as the director of the Na
tive American Programâ€”Col
lege of Engineering at the Uni
versity of New Mexico. He has
also worked with the American
Indian Upward Bound Pro
gram at the University of Col
orado at Boulder and the Amer
ican Indian Science and Engi
neering Society national office.
Jim Larimore, the current
director of Stanford's American
Indian program, said that it is
easier to step down knowing
that he will be replaced by
Shendo.
"He's easily one of the best
folks in the country for doing
this kind of work," Larimore
said. "Benny comes in with a
ton of energy, a very warm per

sonality, and I think a real de
sire to make things better."
The search committee was
impressed with Shendo's ac
complishments in student de
velopment work, particularly
with Native American stu
dents, Baid Rick Yuen, director
of the Asian American Center
and a member of the committee
that chose Shendo. "A lot of his
skills will definitely be put to
good use here at Stanford,"
Yuen said.
One of the many challenges
facing Shendo will be planning
a special anniversary celebra
tion for the Stanford American
Indian Organization, I>arimore
said. SAIO, the primary stu
dent organization for the Na
tive American community, will
celebrate its 25th anniversary
in the fall of 1995.
SAIO hopes to involve faculty,
resident fellows and students in
developing educational and cul
tural programs around the event,
Larimore said. Anyone interested
in participating in the planning
process should contact the Amer
ican Indian Program.
