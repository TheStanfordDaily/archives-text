## Kenney and Quick: good times, good fortune Cardinal swim coaches from different backgrounds achieve similar success and satisfaction at Stanford 
### Heather Hardwick Staff writer 
It is said that only 5 percent of
all men love their jobs. In the case
of the Stanford swimming pro
gram, however, that statement
seems to be null and void.
"I really love what I'm doing,"
said women's swimming head
coach Richard Quick. "I feel like
I'm one of the luckiest people on
the face of the earth. I can't believe
they're paying me to do something
I'd probably do for free."
What's to love about getting up
before five in the morning and
heading off to work, you might
ask? For the Stanford swim coach
es, that's an easy one.
"To be excited about who
you're going to work out with, that
makes it a lot easier," said the
head coach of the men's swimming
team, Skip Kenney. "I know a
coach isn't supposed to be in awe
of his team but with the type of
guys I'm working with — I'm very
impressed with their youth and at
the same time the maturity they
bring to the sport."
It also doesn't hurt to be work
ing with your best friend. While
they have different backgrounds

and approaches to the sport, Quick
and Kenney have known each
other and been working together
for more than two decades.
Kenney was never a competi
tive swimmer, but said he became
involved with coaching after serv
ing as a lifeguard at the U.S.
Olympic trials. At that time, he
never imagined he would later be
coaching the same caliber of ath
letes. "I've got the best job in the
country, and some days I still feel
like I don't know anything about
the sport," he said.
Kenney's lack of swimming ex
perience was offset by his other
unique skills. For example, the fu
ture coach's service as a sniper in
Vietnam taught him some invalu
able lessons. "A lot of what I
learned in combat applies to my
coaching. I've learned that the
human body will do unbelievable
things if you just unlock the mind.
As coaches we try to do that."
Quick, on the other hand, envi
sioned himself as a coach from
early on. "I've always wanted to
coach — since I was 12 years old,"
he said. He swam competitively
both in high school and on the col
lege level at Southern Methodist
University and feels his experi

ence as a swimmer has helped him
relate to his team. "I learn from
my swimmers every day," Quick
said. "I really find them very moti
vational."
However diverse their back
grounds may be, both coaches
share a disbelief of their good for
tune. "We have a hard time believ
ing we're here together. [Kenney]
is one of the major reasons I came
to Stanford," Quick said.
While each might be hesitant to
talk about himself, they are at no
loss for words when speaking of
each other.
"He's my best friend and I
think the world of him," said
Kenney, who named his son after
Quick. "A coach's job is to get an
athlete to do something he
doesn't think he can do and
Richard gets more out of an ath
lete than anyone I know. He talks
to them about big goals and won't
accept anything less. As a teacher
and a motivator, there's none bet
ter."
Along the same lines, Quick
said of Kenney, "I think he's the
best team builder in the nation. He
builds a team atmosphere that al
lows them to achieve things they
never thought possible."
In a sport in which the individ
ual is viewed as central, this con
cept of teamwork is integral to
both coaches' philosophies.
"The strength I bring to swim
ming is the team concept, not the
technical aspect. I don't think that
any individual realizes their po
tential without the team atmos
phere," Kenney said. "In combat,
guys sacrifice their lives for each
other, and when you ask them
why, they say, 'For my buddies.' If
you can ever get that team concept
in athletics, then you have arrived
as a coach."
Both coaches have had experi
ence with U.S. national teams as
well, yet both prefer their position
at Stanford primarily because of
the team atmosphere. "There's no
comparison. On the national
team, there's no team concept. It's
a very selfish atmosphere because
there's only one gold medal in any
event," Kenney said. "If I had to
make the choice, I'd be the Stan

ford coach every day."
Kenney credits Stanford for
this phenomenon. "I find that [the
swimmers] will do it more for each
other than they'd ever do it for
themselves. It works at Stanford
because these kids are intelligent,
they have enough of a self-image
to show how much they care for
and respect each other."
The strength of the team been
amply demonstrated in recent
years, as both the men's and
women's swim teams have cap
tured the last three consecutive
national championships. This is
no small feat, but both coaches
agree that their success cannot be
measured by titles alone.
"A lady once told me, 'You'll be
a lot better coach when you have
kids,' and I thought, 'You're
crazy'," Kenney said. "But it's
true, I started coaching these kids
the way I'd like mine to be
coached, and I've learned that a
kid's self-image is more important
than how fast they get to the end
of the pool."
Quick is of a similar opinion,
saying, "I see swimming as a part
of the educational process. It's an
enhancement of the education
they receive at Stanford — it helps
them to learn about themselves."
The learning process never
stops, as many swimmers are still

at the Farm during the summer,
preparing for the upcoming sea
son. With such an elite tradition to
uphold, the pressure is on to per
form.
Kenney explained his attitude in
saying, "Every year we have the
same expectations — to get a Stan
ford degree and a national champi
onship. Next year we won't be the
favorites because we graduated
such a strong group of seniors.
Most athletes can swim or play
when they're out in front, but it's a
different story when someone's
breathing down your neck. I'm cu
rious to see how they'll perform
when someone else is leading the
way."
Quick finds his team in much
the same position, saying, "I don't
think we ought to be the favorite
this year, but we're talented
enough and we have a tradition
that gives us a chance in any sea
son to win the championship."
No matter what the outcome of
the upcoming season, both will in
evitably be pleased. After all, they
are still members of that lucky 5
percent.
"I am at one of the most presti
gious universities in the nation,
working with my best friend, and
coaching world class student-ath
letes," Kenney said. "This is a very
special place to be."

coach — since I was 12 years old,"
he said. He swam competitively
both in high school and on the col
lege level at Southern Methodist
University and feels his experi

ence as a swimmer has helped him
relate to his team. "I learn from
my swimmers every day," Quick
said. "I really find them very moti
vational."
However diverse their back
grounds may be, both coaches
share a disbelief of their good for
tune. "We have a hard time believ
ing we're here together. [Kenney]
is one of the major reasons I came
to Stanford," Quick said.
While each might be hesitant to
talk about himself, they are at no
loss for words when speaking of
each other.
"He's my best friend and I
think the world of him," said
Kenney, who named his son after
Quick. "A coach's job is to get an
athlete to do something he
doesn't think he can do and
Richard gets more out of an ath
lete than anyone I know. He talks
to them about big goals and won't
accept anything less. As a teacher
and a motivator, there's none bet
ter."
Along the same lines, Quick
said of Kenney, "I think he's the
best team builder in the nation. He
builds a team atmosphere that al
lows them to achieve things they
never thought possible."
In a sport in which the individ
ual is viewed as central, this con
cept of teamwork is integral to
both coaches' philosophies.
"The strength I bring to swim
ming is the team concept, not the
technical aspect. I don't think that
any individual realizes their po
tential without the team atmos
phere," Kenney said. "In combat,
guys sacrifice their lives for each
other, and when you ask them
why, they say, 'For my buddies.' If
you can ever get that team concept
in athletics, then you have arrived
as a coach."
Both coaches have had experi
ence with U.S. national teams as
well, yet both prefer their position
at Stanford primarily because of
the team atmosphere. "There's no
comparison. On the national
team, there's no team concept. It's
a very selfish atmosphere because
there's only one gold medal in any
event," Kenney said. "If I had to
make the choice, I'd be the Stan

ford coach every day."
Kenney credits Stanford for
this phenomenon. "I find that [the
swimmers] will do it more for each
other than they'd ever do it for
themselves. It works at Stanford
because these kids are intelligent,
they have enough of a self-image
to show how much they care for
and respect each other."
The strength of the team been
amply demonstrated in recent
years, as both the men's and
women's swim teams have cap
tured the last three consecutive
national championships. This is
no small feat, but both coaches
agree that their success cannot be
measured by titles alone.
"A lady once told me, 'You'll be
a lot better coach when you have
kids,' and I thought, 'You're
crazy'," Kenney said. "But it's
true, I started coaching these kids
the way I'd like mine to be
coached, and I've learned that a
kid's self-image is more important
than how fast they get to the end
of the pool."
Quick is of a similar opinion,
saying, "I see swimming as a part
of the educational process. It's an
enhancement of the education
they receive at Stanford — it helps
them to learn about themselves."
The learning process never
stops, as many swimmers are still

at the Farm during the summer,
preparing for the upcoming sea
son. With such an elite tradition to
uphold, the pressure is on to per
form.
Kenney explained his attitude in
saying, "Every year we have the
same expectations — to get a Stan
ford degree and a national champi
onship. Next year we won't be the
favorites because we graduated
such a strong group of seniors.
Most athletes can swim or play
when they're out in front, but it's a
different story when someone's
breathing down your neck. I'm cu
rious to see how they'll perform
when someone else is leading the
way."
Quick finds his team in much
the same position, saying, "I don't
think we ought to be the favorite
this year, but we're talented
enough and we have a tradition
that gives us a chance in any sea
son to win the championship."
No matter what the outcome of
the upcoming season, both will in
evitably be pleased. After all, they
are still members of that lucky 5
percent.
"I am at one of the most presti
gious universities in the nation,
working with my best friend, and
coaching world class student-ath
letes," Kenney said. "This is a very
special place to be."

Skip Kenney celebrates his squad's 1992 NCAA championship.
It is said that only 5 percent of
all men love their jobs. In the case
of the Stanford swimming pro
gram, however, that statement
seems to be null and void.
"I really love what I'm doing,"
said women's swimming head
coach Richard Quick. "I feel like
I'm one of the luckiest people on
the face of the earth. I can't believe
they're paying me to do something
I'd probably do for free."
What's to love about getting up
before five in the morning and
heading off to work, you might
ask? For the Stanford swim coach
es, that's an easy one.
"To be excited about who
you're going to work out with, that
makes it a lot easier," said the
head coach of the men's swimming
team, Skip Kenney. "I know a
coach isn't supposed to be in awe
of his team but with the type of
guys I'm working with — I'm very
impressed with their youth and at
the same time the maturity they
bring to the sport."
It also doesn't hurt to be work
ing with your best friend. While
they have different backgrounds

and approaches to the sport, Quick
and Kenney have known each
other and been working together
for more than two decades.
Kenney was never a competi
tive swimmer, but said he became
involved with coaching after serv
ing as a lifeguard at the U.S.
Olympic trials. At that time, he
never imagined he would later be
coaching the same caliber of ath
letes. "I've got the best job in the
country, and some days I still feel
like I don't know anything about
the sport," he said.
Kenney's lack of swimming ex
perience was offset by his other
unique skills. For example, the fu
ture coach's service as a sniper in
Vietnam taught him some invalu
able lessons. "A lot of what I
learned in combat applies to my
coaching. I've learned that the
human body will do unbelievable
things if you just unlock the mind.
As coaches we try to do that."
Quick, on the other hand, envi
sioned himself as a coach from
early on. "I've always wanted to
coach — since I was 12 years old,"
he said. He swam competitively
both in high school and on the col
lege level at Southern Methodist
