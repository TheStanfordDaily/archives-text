Beach volleyball in Russia?
Former Stanford women's volley
ball star Barbra Fontana is prov
ing that the sport has come a long
way in a short time.
While the golden shores of the
Neva River in St. Petersburg are
hardly the stuff that beer commer
cials are made of, this week's
Goodwill Games are focusing
worldwide attention on women's
beach volleyball, a sport rapidly
increasing in popularity in the
United States.
Fontana, a 1987 Stanford grad
uate, leads the charge of former
Cardinal women's volleyball play
ers on the beach volleyball circuit.
Fontana has teamed with former
UCLA star Lori Kotas-Forsythe
for three years, forming one of the
most successful beach volleyball
tandems in history.
The Fontana/Kotas-Forsythe
pair is currently ranked second in
the Women's Professional Volley
ball Association (WPVA), and
third internationally. More im
pressively, the women are one of
two American women's beach vol
leyball squads at the Goodwill

Games this week. Seeded third in
the competition, Fontana and
Kotas-Forsythe knocked off a
Dutch squad 15-9 in first-round
action.
Played on a sand court only a
shade smaller than a standard vol
leyball floor, two- and four-person
beach volleyball have evolved from
their California-based, semi-pro
fessional roots to full-fledged in
ternational sports in less than
three decades.
"I think we're finally hitting
the big time," Jeff Dankworth, ex
ecutive director of the Association
of Volleyball Professionals (AVP),
the top American professional co
ed tour, said in a press release.
The Stanford women's volley
ball squad, which has advanced to
the NCAA Final Four in five of the
past 10 years, is well-represented
in the United States women's
beach volleyball ranks. Former
Stanford players abound in the
WPVA, the leading women's tour.
Also experiencing professional
success, though not currently in
the WPVA, is Nancy Reno, a 1988
graduate. Reno, a collegiate All-
America, defected from the WPVA
to join the women's division of the
A VP last year. She finished second

in last weekend's Miller Lite Open
in Chicago. In three years of pro
fessional volleyball competition,
Reno has earned over $100,000 in
tournament prize money.
Kristen Klein and Bev Oden, a
pair of four-year All-Americans
who graduated in 1992 and 1993
respectively, have struggled to get
their feet wet professionally —
both are still looking for their first
professional tournament victo
ries.
"It's a different game — it's
harder to plant and jump on the
sand," said Oden, an Irvine, Calif,
native. "But I've got no com
plaints so far."
Beach volleyball, which will be
a demonstration sport at the 1996
Summer Olympics in Atlanta,
may usher in a whole new genre of
"beach sports" — for example, up
to 10,000 spectators have shown
up to watch professional beach
soccer matches in Brazil.
But for now, it's Russia or bust.
"I don't know if the Russians
know anything about beach vol
leyball," Fontana said before the
Goodwill Games in an interview
with the Los Angeles Times. "But
the exposure is great for our
sport."
