## WE BIG BANG THEORY STANFORD JAZZ WORKSHOP'S SUMMER CONCERT SERIES CONTINUES WITH A GROUP OF SHOWS THAT FEATURE JAZZ'S LEGENDS AND YOUNG LIONS 
### BY VICTOR HASEMAN 
In the next several weeks, the Stanford Jazz
Workshop's Summer Concert Series will
host a group of shows in and about campus
that are certain to dazzle the ear-drums of
both seasoned and green thumbed jazz lis
teners alike.
The shows scheduled on July 29 and Au
gust 10, 12 and 13 aren't the only shows
being offered by SJW for audience apprecia
tion, but they are the ones that stand out as
as the most prominent.
Each features musicians who, over the
courses of their careers, have distinguished
themselves in one way or another as musi
cian's musicians. And in their own way, each
representative of jazz's many flavors,
rhythms and motivations.
So sit back,and relax. Let us help you dis
cover the low down each ...
Eddie Marshall
A frequent visitor to the SJW, Marshall
isn't just an accomplished drummer, but he
has been performing on alto and soprano
recorder since 1989. He also plays the end
blown Renaisssance flute, a rare instrument
indeed.
Marshall served as the house band drum
mer at Keystone Korner in North Beach dur
ing the early '70s. There he played with jazz
greats like Dexter Gordon, Bobby Hutcher
son and Mary Lou Williams.
With 39 years of experience under his
belt, you can expec to hear original numbers
in addition to standard jazz tunes from Mar
shall and New Flavor, the group that he and
his son collaborate with.

Eddie Marshall & the New Flavor will
perform in Campbell Recital Hall on July 29
at 8:00pm. Tickets are $12 gen. admis-
1 0 students.
Stefan Karlsson
Swedish jazz pianist and SJW clinician/in
structor played in the world renown One
O'Clock Lab Band while completing Bache
lor's and Master's degrees in Jazz Studies at
the University of North Texas.

Now 28, Karlsson has released three al
bums on the Justice Records label — "Room
292," "The Road Not Taken" and "Below
Zero."
"Below Zero," his latest release, has a
sound that can be characterized as hard
bop with a Scandanavian/European ap
proach in both melody and feel. Karlsson
also has dedicated this third album to his fa
ther — also a pianist — posthumously to his
father.
On "The Road Not Taken" the band fea
tures two veterans from the Mel Lewis Or
chestra, reedmen Richard Perry and Dick
Oatts, and two University of North Texas
alumni, bassist Marc Johnson and drummer
Jim White.
An album similar to the Robert Frost
poem from which the name was taken —
graceful, subtle, resonating with promissory
richness, and includes two tunes dedicated to
Miles Davis and Dexter Gordon

The Stefan Karlsson Trio will perform in
Campbell Recital Hall on August 10 at 7:30
pm. Tickets are $12 general admission!slo

James Moody
Though he doesn't possess negative char
acter traits such as arrogance as some jazz
greats do, James Moody has all the skill and
talent that puts him at the top of the Who's
who-of-jazz-musicians list.
Moody was drawn to the saxaphone after
listening to Buddy Tate and Don Byes with
the Count Bassie Band at Newark's Adams
Theater.
While in the Air Force, Moody and his
Newark buddy, trumpeter Dave Burns
were taught how to read music by white
musicians there as well. Roughly one year
later, those same musicians came over to
the black artists not to teach, but to listen.
Also during Moody's time overseas, Dizzy
Gillespie brought his band to the base to
play, thus marking the beginning of a lon
glasting association.
Moody joined the band in 1947 and later

played with
greats such as
Kenny Clark,
Thelonious
Monk, Ray
Brown and Milt
Jackson.
After the
band went to
Europe in 1949,
Moody decided
to settle in Paris
due to a growing
irritation with
American race
relations and
discrimination.

There he met Swedish drummer Anders Bur
man, who invited him to record with him in
Stockholm.
While there, Moody recorded "I'm in the
mood for love," a song that was to become his
musical trademark.
Throughout the '50s and '60s, Moody
toured the US with Dinah Washington and
Eddie Jefferson. He then rejoined Dizzy
Gillespie in 1963, completing a quintet that
included Lalo Schifrin, Chris White, and
Rudy Collins.
Six years later he took a break and settled
in Las Vegas where he spent six more years
playing in house bands at the Flamingo and
the Hilton alongside celebrated jazzmen Carl
Fontana, Red Rodney, Sam Noto, and Benny
Green.
Recently, Moody has frequented Euro
pean festivals and clubs, playing his saxa
phone and flute to the delight of many a fan.

James Moody will play in Dinkelspiel Au
ditorium on August 12 at 8:00pm. Also fea
tured during that performance will be Mul
grew Miller, Lewis Nash, John Clayton and
Hillip Harper. Tickets are $18 general, ad
mission/$l5 students
Mulgrew Miller
Miller was apart of the resurgence of tra
ditional, straight-ahead jazz playing that

took place in the early 1980s. His association
with the movement gained him eventually
noteriety and respect until today, he's widely
considered to be one of the foremost jazz pi
anists of his generation.
His professional life began with Mercer
Ellington's continuation of the Duke's fa
mous orchestra, his position as a member of
Art Blakey *8 legendary Jazz Messangers and
his stint as an accompanist to Betty Carter.
After that, Miller embarked on world
tours as a founding member of Tony
William's acclaimed quintet.
Currently a vital member of the New
York-based scene, though he appears in Eu
ropean festivals and performs in Japanese
nightclubs.
The 38-year-old Miller is one of the young
jazz musicians who exites veteran producer
Orrin Keepnews (Thelonious Monk, Bill
Evans) today.
In 1985, he began his recording career
with "Keys to the City," the first in a string
of seven albums for Keepnews' Landmark
Records.
Last year, he made his debut on the preti
gious RCA/Novus label with "Hand in Hand."

Mulgrew Miller will be featured in a rhythm
section trio on August 13 in Dinkespiel Audi
torium. He'll be performing with Lewis Nash
and John Clayton. Tickets are $15 general
admission $12 student.

There he met Swedish drummer Anders Bur

mood for love," a song that was to become his
musical trademark.

Eddie Jefferson. He then rejoined Dizzy
Gillespie in 1963, completing a quintet that
included Lalo Schifrin, Chris White, and
Rudy Collins.
Six years later he took a break and settled
in Las Vegas where he spent six more years
playing in house bands at the Flamingo and
the Hilton alongside celebrated jazzmen Carl
Fontana, Red Rodney, Sam Noto, and Benny
Green.
Recently, Moody has frequented Euro
pean festivals and clubs, playing his saxa
phone and flute to the delight of many a fan.

Mulgrew Miller
Miller was apart of the resurgence of tra
ditional, straight-ahead jazz playing that

took place in the early 1980s. His association
with the movement gained him eventually
noteriety and respect until today, he's widely
considered to be one of the foremost jazz pi
anists of his generation.
His professional life began with Mercer
Ellington's continuation of the Duke's fa
mous orchestra, his position as a member of
Art Blakey *8 legendary Jazz Messangers and
his stint as an accompanist to Betty Carter.
After that, Miller embarked on world
tours as a founding member of Tony
William's acclaimed quintet.
Currently a vital member of the New
York-based scene, though he appears in Eu
ropean festivals and performs in Japanese
nightclubs.
The 38-year-old Miller is one of the young
jazz musicians who exites veteran producer
Orrin Keepnews (Thelonious Monk, Bill
Evans) today.
In 1985, he began his recording career
with "Keys to the City," the first in a string
of seven albums for Keepnews' Landmark
Records.
Last year, he made his debut on the preti
gious RCA/Novus label with "Hand in Hand."

Mulgrew Miller will be featured in a rhythm
section trio on August 13 in Dinkespiel Audi
torium. He'll be performing with Lewis Nash
and John Clayton. Tickets are $15 general
admission $12 student.

Considered one of the finest young jazz pianists around, Mulgrew
Miller is scheduled to play with both jazz legend James Moody on Au
gust 12 and with Lewis Nash and John Clayton on August 13, helping
to close SJW's spectacular season of summer concerts.
In the next several weeks, the Stanford Jazz
Workshop's Summer Concert Series will
host a group of shows in and about campus
that are certain to dazzle the ear-drums of
both seasoned and green thumbed jazz lis
teners alike.
The shows scheduled on July 29 and Au
gust 10, 12 and 13 aren't the only shows
being offered by SJW for audience apprecia
tion, but they are the ones that stand out as
as the most prominent.
Each features musicians who, over the
courses of their careers, have distinguished
themselves in one way or another as musi
cian's musicians. And in their own way, each
representative of jazz's many flavors,
rhythms and motivations.
So sit back,and relax. Let us help you dis
cover the low down each ...
Eddie Marshall
A frequent visitor to the SJW, Marshall
isn't just an accomplished drummer, but he
has been performing on alto and soprano
recorder since 1989. He also plays the end
blown Renaisssance flute, a rare instrument
indeed.
Marshall served as the house band drum
mer at Keystone Korner in North Beach dur
ing the early '70s. There he played with jazz
greats like Dexter Gordon, Bobby Hutcher
son and Mary Lou Williams.
With 39 years of experience under his
belt, you can expec to hear original numbers
in addition to standard jazz tunes from Mar
shall and New Flavor, the group that he and
his son collaborate with.

Eddie Marshall & the New Flavor will
perform in Campbell Recital Hall on July 29
at 8:00pm. Tickets are $12 gen. admis-

Stefan Karlsson
Swedish jazz pianist and SJW clinician/in
structor played in the world renown One
O'Clock Lab Band while completing Bache
lor's and Master's degrees in Jazz Studies at
the University of North Texas.

Now 28, Karlsson has released three al
bums on the Justice Records label — "Room
292," "The Road Not Taken" and "Below
Zero."
"Below Zero," his latest release, has a
sound that can be characterized as hard
bop with a Scandanavian/European ap
proach in both melody and feel. Karlsson
also has dedicated this third album to his fa
ther — also a pianist — posthumously to his
father.
On "The Road Not Taken" the band fea
tures two veterans from the Mel Lewis Or
chestra, reedmen Richard Perry and Dick
Oatts, and two University of North Texas
alumni, bassist Marc Johnson and drummer
Jim White.
An album similar to the Robert Frost
poem from which the name was taken —
graceful, subtle, resonating with promissory
richness, and includes two tunes dedicated to
Miles Davis and Dexter Gordon

The Stefan Karlsson Trio will perform in
Campbell Recital Hall on August 10 at 7:30

James Moody
Though he doesn't possess negative char
acter traits such as arrogance as some jazz
greats do, James Moody has all the skill and
talent that puts him at the top of the Who's
who-of-jazz-musicians list.
Moody was drawn to the saxaphone after
listening to Buddy Tate and Don Byes with
the Count Bassie Band at Newark's Adams
Theater.
While in the Air Force, Moody and his
Newark buddy, trumpeter Dave Burns
were taught how to read music by white
musicians there as well. Roughly one year
later, those same musicians came over to
the black artists not to teach, but to listen.
Also during Moody's time overseas, Dizzy
Gillespie brought his band to the base to
play, thus marking the beginning of a lon
glasting association.
Moody joined the band in 1947 and later

played with
greats such as
Kenny Clark,
Thelonious
Monk, Ray
Brown and Milt
Jackson.
After the
band went to
Europe in 1949,
Moody decided
to settle in Paris
due to a growing
irritation with
American race
relations and
discrimination.

There he met Swedish drummer Anders Bur
man, who invited him to record with him in
Stockholm.
While there, Moody recorded "I'm in the
mood for love," a song that was to become his
musical trademark.
