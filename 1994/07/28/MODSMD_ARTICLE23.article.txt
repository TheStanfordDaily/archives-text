## The 						Client 
### 
It's a rare film that would squander the
considerable talents of actors Tommy Lee
Jones or Susan Sarandon. It's an even
rarer film that would squander the tal
ents of both. Unfortunately, the works of
novelist John Grisham and director Joel
Shumacher are none too rare.
Like taxes or a trip to your dentist, they
seem to happen once a year whether you
want them to or not. These two non-tal
ents have combined to produce "The
Client," which is easily the year's least
suspenseful thriller.

Since his first novel, "A Time of Need,"
Grisham has been obsessed with the con
cept of lawyers in jeopardy. "The Firm"
centered around a lawyer who thought
he'd found the job of a lifetime, only to find
that his mysterious and murderous law
firm was... a front for the mob. "The Pel
ican Brief featured a law student investi
gating the murders of two Supreme Court
justices as part of a covert plot ... to en
sure offshore drilling despite the presence
of endangered species. Grisham is pos
sessed of a single talent, one that manages
to take a mildly intriguing premise and
drain it until it's intrigue-free.
So if it's boredom you're looking for,
"The Client" delivers in spades. Shrewdly
cashing in on the current vogue of white
trash chic, the story focuses on mark, a
young teen who stumbles across a man in
a car trying to kill himself by car exhaust

in the woods behind the family trailer
park. When Mark tries to save the man, he
gets a slap and a gunpoint harangue on the
philosophy of death . . . and a confession
as to where the body of a U.S. Senator is
hidden. That said, Mark does his best
Tonya Harding imitation and after a brief
chase, the man does his best Kurt Cobain.
Poor Marky. He's wanted by both mob
ster-murderer Barry "The Blade" and
bible-spouting U.S. Attorney "Reverend"
Hoy Foltrigg. His little brother is hospi
talized for post-traumatic stress, his sin
gle parent mother just lost her minimum
wage, no health insurance job and Hillary
Rodham Clinton is nowhere to be found.
So Mark does the next best thing — he
hires Reggie Love, an ex-alcoholic, ex
smoker who, having been declared an
unfit mother by the judge who gave her
husband custody of her own children, got

inspired to become that which destroyed
her life — a lawyer. Now, of course, she
has nothing better to do than take mark
on pro bono.
Only in the movies.
Late night photocopying, covert faxing
and secretly recorded phone conversa
tions are what pass for excitement in the
Grisham world, and"The Client" is very
much in that vein. There are a few scenes
of Mark being stalked by leather-clad Ital
ian Goodfellas, but apart from that, nolo.
The film needs the wicked humor of a
young De Palma or Joseph Ruben to prop
erly exploit the child-in-jeopardy premise.
But Shumacher, who skillfully pushed
America's buttons with last year's white
man's diatribe "Falling Down" doesn't
have the guts to go there. This is a paint

by-the-numbers project, and Shumacher
has no intention of beefing up the palette.
In the complete absence of wit, intel
ligence and skill on the part of filmmak
ers, the actors attempt to carry this dead
horse to the finish line. Shumacher cast
troubled newcomer Brad Renfro as
Mark in a search for verisimilitude;
however, a hardlife doesn't ensure act
ing ability. Compared to Zelda Harris
("Crooklyn") or Jesse Bradford ("King
of the Hill"), Renfro needs a good deal
more seasoning before he can male much
of an impact.
For their part, Jones and Sarandon do
their best to inject the project with a bit of
class. Jones plays Foltrigg as a man who
thinks he's smarter than everyone
around him, but smart enough to know
that Love is at least as smart as he. Saran
don shows us both Love's intelligence and
her fear of being in way over her head
while downplaying the overwroughtness
of her past. He's intrigued by her scrappy,
earth mother-bear tenaciousness; she
wonders what lurks beneath his blustery
exterior; their scenes together are an ex
quisite pas de deux — part veiled flirta
tion, part obvious one-upmanship — that
screams out for filmmakers who know
what to do with them.
Alas, they are trapped in a Grisham
film. As 'The Client" wheezes inter
minable to its conclusion, you're sure to
hope for Grisham's legal practice to pick
up — anything to keep form inflicting his
cruel and unusual punishments upon un
suspecting audiences. It's criminal; as a
lawyer, he should know better.
