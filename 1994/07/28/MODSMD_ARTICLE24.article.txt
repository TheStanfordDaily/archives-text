It Could Happen to You

When was the last time you saw a good
cop in a movie? I mean a really good cop. The
kind of cop who's never shot his gun, plays
stickball with neighborhood kids after
work, and lives by the saying, "A promise is
a promise."
Nicholas Cage plays Charlie Lang, an
old-fashioned New York cop in an old-fash
ioned, Capra-esque movie. With the unfor
tunately generic title "It Could Happen To
You," director Andrew Bergman's ("Honey
moon in Vegas") new romantic comedy is a
fish out of water, a sweet-natured, inconse
quential comedy being released to cynical,
action-hungry audiences. It's a buoyant,
warm and fuzzy movie that gets bogged
down during the last forty-five minutes by a
repetitive script and a terrible courtroom
drama subplot.
Charlie, saint that he is, also has the mis
fortune of being married to money-starved
hairdresser Muriel (Rosie Perez), who
makes him buy a lottery ticket for her. On
the way home, though, and without enough
money for a tip, Charlie promises Yvonne
(Bridget Fonda), a down-on-her-luck wait
ress, that he'll split his lottery winnings
with her.
Of course, he wins, but the movie curi
ously doesn't go the obvious route, which
would be to spend the rest of the movie ask
ing whether he should keep his promise; we
know he'll give Yvonne the money. Howev
er, the rest of the movie proceeds in a pre
dictable manner. Of course, Muriel will
scream and whine. Of course, Yvonne will
have a heart of gold. Of course, she and
Charlie will fall in love and perform good
deeds. And, of course, they'll face problems.
This is when the movie stumbles badly.
The good deeds thing is cute for a while, but
it's awfully boring to see Charlie and
Yvonne be nice over and over again. The
natural course of action would be to deflate
that cuteness, but the movie goes too far, re
quiring Perez to turn into the biggest, loud
est hell-bitch, thoroughly destroying the
mood.
And then it suddenly introduces us to a

bunch of uninteresting
supporting characters
(mostly lawyers) who lead
us into a thoroughly unin
teresting courtroom se
quence. It doesn't help
that we can see the
"shocking" verdict com
ing a mile away. The
movie partially redeems
itself with a wonderfully
romantic conclusion
which is unfortunately
too little, too late.
Typically specializing
in goofball characters,
Cage is surprisingly ami
able as a supernormal
nice guy. Fonda, tradi
tionally not one of my fa
vorite actresses, redeems
herself in a fine perfor
mance giving Yvonne's di
alogue a nervous edge and
letting the words flow
naturally from her
mouth. Perez is her famil
iar, energetic self, but her
shrillness quickly be
comes annoying.
With the exception of
Isaac Hayes as the angelic
narrator of the story, the
rest of the supporting cast
is mostly forgettable. This
flaw is easily overlooked
when Cage and Fonda
dominate the screen, but
it proves fatal when
they're just part of the
scenery.
It's too bad that the
movie is hurt so much by

these problems. Optimism and good-heart
edness are sorely missing from a lot of
movies these days, but they can also wear
out their welcome when they're overplayed.

"Dream Cake"
jale

With its debut the all-female quartet jale
lets you have your "Dream Cake" and eat it
too. These Nova Scotians bake up a tasty
treat combining thick growling (dare I say)
grungy guitars with plenty of sugary vocal
melodies. Sure, it's addicting and loaded
with pure pop calories, but there's nothing
wrong with indulging once in a while.
But it's not really that easy to dismiss
jale's fare as a fleeting hunger pang. One lis
ten leads to another, which leads to another.
In short, "Dream Cake" might just be the
most deliriously all-consuming pop album
since Teenage Fanclub's peerless 1991 re
lease, "Bandwagonesque."
In fact, jale — guitarist Jennifer Pierce,
drummer Alyson MacLeod, bassist Laura
Stein and guitarist Eve Hartling — seems
like the "girly-pop" version of Teenage Fan
club: both bands feature interchangeable
lead singers, show off a heady blend of punk
attitude and pop sensibility and possess an
uncanny ability to make you bob your head
and sing along.
Sure, jale does't do anything new, but
they do their post-punk, post-pop — what
ever — thing very well and that's at least as
good. The should-be hits come fast and
fierce, each with is own distinctive, refresh
ing flavor.
The raucous clamor of "Not Happy," for
instance, starts things auspiciously: a
crunchy blur of guitar work whipped up by
guitarists Hartling and Pierce that fits well
with indecipherable, jingle-jangle vocals.
Whatever you call jale's sound, "Not
Happy" is a catchy little ditty that sticks.
The next charmer, "Nebulous," grabs

your attention and keeps it. If there's a
standout in the bunch, it's this mellow cut:
chime-like guitars and a plump bass line
melt with creamy smooth lead vocals in this
delicious cut. In an instant, however, the
guitars turn fuzzy and distorted as one of
the ladies underlines the la-la lead with a
murmuring chant just beneath. "Nebu
lous" itself captures the varied styles and
structures the band presents throughout
the album.
Yet while jale keeps things interesting by
changing up the mix, the music remains co
hesive, between and within songs. Whether
it's the mopey "To Be Your Friend" or a
twangy number like "River," jale leaves
something of a good taste behind, always
exuding warmth from the group's medley of
voices and emanating energy from their vi
brant instrumental work.
And it's a good taste that stays for a
while, an addicting dose of pop punch —
not just a simple pleasure. As the chorus
goes in the album-closer, "Promise," jale's
songs "never go away."

" She " d
Harry Connick jr.

The man whose white-tee shirt good
looks recalled James Dean and whose
brassy, forceful music recollected big band
maestros from Duke Ellington to Benny
Goodman has taken a musical exit. On his
new album "She," Harry Connick. Jr.
trades in his horns for guitars and pianos
for organs.
The result is a monotonous drive
through slow bass Unes supported by pre
dictable lyrics that one can only hope are
only a detour in Connick's career.
The opening notes of the album's first
song, the title track, make loyal listeners
wonder if perhaps the wrong disc was put in
the case. Instead of opening with a Connick
flourish of trumpets, cymbals and trom
bones, "She" begins with a trudging bass. In
fact Connick shuffles through the first two
songs without a hint of brass, relying on gui

tar, bass and Connick himself on the organ.
And Connick doesn't just experiment by
changing instruments and tempo. On pieces
like "Follow the Music" he tries a whole new
format. The track and its reprieve "Follow
the Music Further" are recitations over a
bass and guitar background that sound
more like beatnik poetry than music.
The plodding, bass-ridden tempo Con
nick establishes on the first track is carried
over into the instrumental pieces. "Joe
Slam and the Spaceship," for example, is a
study in wasted potential. The band estab
lishes a funky baseline, then refuses to add
on anything more than a few somber organ
riffs. So a piece that cries out for a sax im
prov is left shivering in the cold, waiting for
a group like the Beastie Boys to come and do
something with it.
Really, though, it's all about attitude.
What gave Connick such a big audience was
not his musical skills or song-writing talent,
but his ability to make his listener tap a foot,
snap some fingers and, ultimately, smile.
His bands' fast-paced brass ecstasy was a
joyous experience, as all good big band
music should be.
Only on the third track is Connick able to
kick it like he used to on his hit album "Blue
Light." Wiping the dust off the trumpet
Connick and his band high step through
"Here Comes the Big Parade," and create a
joyous piece in the process.
Throw me somethin' mister
1 wanna dance with your sister
Brass bands marchin'by
Throwing notes to the sky
Connick used to lead those big brass bands.
Now he just dances to them.
