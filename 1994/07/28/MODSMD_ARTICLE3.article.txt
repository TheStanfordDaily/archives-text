## Editorial A 						balancing act 'Farm' life as important as the pursuit of both knowledge and culture 
### 
NOT LONG AGO, it was
announced that Univer
sity officials are negotiat
ing the purchase of a collection of
items put up for sale by Allen
Ginsberg, the well-regarded
Beat poet of the '50s and '60s.
Along with the first draft of
the 68-year-old poet laureate's
now legendary poem "Howl," the
archive includes Ginsberg's jour
nals, notebooks, correspondence,
tape recordings and momentos
like the sneakers he wore around
the time of his expulsion from
Czechoslovakia in 1965.
Boasting over 120,00 of Gins
berg's personal items, it goes
without saying that the collec
tion will be a wise investment for
a university seeking to expand
its collections of materials on
postwar American poetry and
literature and American cultural
history. Furthermore, if pur
chased by Stanford, the collec
tion will make no additional de
mands on an already lean Uni
versity budget. Instead, the
funds would come from the do
nations of private donors.
In another recent announce
ment, out-going Dean of Student
Resources Cecilia Burciaga was
nominated to President Clin
ton's Commission on Education
al Excellence for Hispanic Amer
icans. Burciaga, who has served
the Stanford community for
over 20 years as both a campus
administrator and resident fel
low for Casa Zapata.
In her time on campus, she
has acted as both an assistant to
the president for Chicano affairs
as well as an assistant provost
for faculty affairs. She also held
the positions of associate dean of
graduate studies and affirmative
action officer. But for most, Bur
ciaga is remembered for her
work as a RF in Casa Zapata
(along with husband Tony Bur
ciaga, artist and writer), and as
an outspoken critic of University
policies.
Her association with the Uni
versity has proven time and time
again to be a cultural windfall for
the Stanford campus, as impor

tant as any culturally-based ac
quisition for the sake of scholar
ship. But when the budget axe
was allowed to fall on Student
Affairs, Burciaga's position was
dissolved without even a
thought about her past and pre
sent value to the Stanford com
munity.
Trimming over $1 million
dollars from an operating budget
is no small feat. Issues of effi
ciency and quality of work are
bound to be raised in the process.
But when dealing with the con
solidation or elimination of "se
nior-level" positions, the situa
tion becomes even more diffi
cult. Often times, the liquidation
of one position doesn't automat
ically mean the creation of an
other.
Still it seems surprising that
allowances are not made for ad
ministrators who have proven
their worth in a variety of capac
ities. By relieving Burciaga of
both her duties effective August
1, the university has essentially
ignored her importance to the
Stanford Community as a whole
and Chicano/Latino community
in specific.
And this action, from a Uni
versity as dedicated to the pur
suit of knowledge and the
preservation of culture as Stan
ford somehow seems contradic
tory. On the one hand, Stanford
can speculate about the possibil
ity of gaining access to the writ
ings and belongings of an indi
vidual like Ginsberg, who is
widely accepted as one of the
most prominent influences in
modern American poetry.
And on the other hand, Stan
ford can all but ignore the valu
able contributions of an individ
ual like Burciaga who has spent
the better part of 20 years serv
ing the Stanford community and
influencing — through her ser
vice — the recent development of
a cultural center more common
ly known as the Farm.
Though the professional fate
of Burciaga on campus has al
ready been determined, the Uni
versity should not be allowed to
forget its responsibility to pro
tect the campus environment
that so many have worked to
build, even as it continues its
dedication to the pursuit of
knowledge and the preservation
of culture through scholarship.
