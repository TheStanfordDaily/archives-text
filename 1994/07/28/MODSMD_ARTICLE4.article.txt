## Aida Croal Troche's 'Go Fish 'ain't got it 
### 
IT DOESN'T take a genius to
figure out that a movie about
"hip" young lesbians with
nothing more pressing to do but
look for love might just make a
box-office hit.
Not at this stage of the '90s
when escapism, sexual immaturi
ty, and an appetite for the exotic
unknown still characterize, in
large part, the US movie-goer's
mindset.
Despite attempts by critics and
viewers to define it so, this year's
lesbian love comedy and feature
hit "Go Fish" is not an example of
daring new material serendipi
tously gone gold. On screen, it is
the oft-recycled but well-loved
boy-meets-girl, boy-hates-girl,
boy-beds-girl-and-lives-happily
ever-after material. Only with a
gender twist.
In the market place, "Go
Fish" reads more like Multicul
tural Chic meets Capitalist En
terprise at the movies. Sampling
everything from "crunchy," tea
addicted lesbians in long-dis
tance relationships, to urban,
sexually adventurous dykes, the
film prepares a tantalizing dis
play of young dyke culture for
mainstream America's con
sumption.
Unfortunately, even as it's
treating the sensitive and com
plex continuum of lesbianism,

"Go Fish" relies on a frightening
ly stereotypical array of charac
ters to achieve its goal. And so
along with the film's protago
nists, Ely and Max, two middle
class white women, we get Daria,
nymphomaniac and bartender,
Evy, the tragic Latina, and Kia,
black mammy and mother figure
to all.
With a scanty plot at best, "Go
Fish" manages to fill itself out by
using these characters that, espe
cially for the two women of color,
would not otherwise fit. These
women endure trauma after trau
ma — Evy's traditionally Catholic
mother discovers her daughter's
lesbianism and severs ties with
her, Kia is verbally harassed on
the street, and Daria is heckled (in
her own mind) by her peers after
she sleeps with a man — so that
Max and Ely may pursue each
other trauma-free.
In addition to its minority
characters, director Rose Troche
extends this motif to include the
film's entire aesthetic.
The movie is shot in grainy
black and white. A number of re
curring silent images, including a
spinning black top against a stark
checker board, the close-up image
of black coffee being integrated
with milk, and of a black boy play
ing on the street, people the
screen at random intervals.

But unlike the coffee and
cream, these visuals cannot be in
tegrated into the storyline. Nei
ther ethnicity nor race is at issue
in "Go Fish." Like Evy's experi
ence with her mother, and Kia's
run-in on the street, the stark vi
suals are sprinkled throughout
the film to provide much-needed
spice, and then dropped before
they become too hot.
Unnervingly, this movie re
peatedly gets compared to Spike
Lee's "She's Gotta Have It," a fic
tion depicting one black woman's
sexual exploration. But Turner
and Troche's lightweight comedy
can no more be the dyke answer to
"She's Gotta Have It" than can
"Terminator II." Lee's movie ex
plores sexuality; "Go Fish," with
its whirlwind tour of lesbian life,
merely exhibits it without offer
ing much insight.
"Go Fish" is refreshing only
because it is a novelty. But re
member the sincerity of "Desert
Hearts," the discreet but moving
portrayals in "Fried Green Toma
toes," the sheer eroticism of
"Henry and June?" Daring, rivet
ing, heart-rending. What would it
look like to combine these ele
ments with the open candor of
"Go Fish?"
The real dyke answer to "She's
Gotta Have It?"
Go figure.
