## Reporting on postal service 'incomplete' 
### 
THIS LETTER is in re
sponse to The Stanford
Weekly's July 21 article
concerning complaints about the
service at the Stanford Post Of
fice.
I found several inaccuracies
and I merely wish to set the
record straight on what can be
viewed at best as "incomplete re
porting."
In a written statement
which I received, Paul von
Hippel, co-organizer for
S.C.U.D., pointed out in de
tailed fashion how ASSU Sum
mer Senate Chair Steven Rus
sell grossly misrepresented the

facts at the July 13 postal
meeting between representa
tives of student, administra
tive and postal concerns.
There has never been a com
plaint of sexual harassment
against any employee, either to
postal management or law en
forcement authorities.
No police report exists, as
claimed by Mr. Russell at the
meeting, yet The Stanford Weekly
gingerly peddles Mr. Russell's
claims as facts beyond dispute,
with little effort made to confirm
his allegations.
In the 25 years that I have
worked at the Stanford Branch

Post Office I have often cautioned
new and/or incoming managers
against granting interviews with
the local college newspaper as
"they never get it right."
And of course it's business as
usual, but in this instance howev
er, the inaccuracies must have in
volved a tremendous amount of
research.
To wit:
The Postal Service has re
quired name tags for several
years now, not as the Stanford
Weekly claims "Since last week's
meeting. .. which allows con
sumers to identify impolite work
ers.

Also, there is no "three-week
training class for each particular
job" as The Weekly erroneously
attributed to Stanford Station
Manager Jim Ruiz.
Finally, any "temporary" re
moval of an employee from his or
her bid position shall be deter
mined by the grievance procedure
and not the whims of a "summer
chair" who deliberately misrepre
sents the facts to a few college re
porters.
