## Echoing Green fellows comment on Weekly coverage 
### 
When The Stanford Weekly ap
proached Free at Last to do inter
views for a human interest article
about Echoing Green, a founda
tion which supports Free at Last
and other programs, we were
guarded but willing.
We were willing because we rec
ognized the benefits that media
coverage has for the future of Free
at Last, for the visibility of our
partner/mentor Echoing Green
Foundation, for positive reflec
tions of East Palo Alto, for educat
ing Stanford community mem
bers, and most importantly for ad
vocating that recovery happens
and change is possible.
We were guarded because we
fear the negative implications of
poor reporting, which we have ex
perienced all too often.
After reading the article in the July
14,1994 issue of The Stanford Week
ly, we were angered and disgusted.
The impositions, misrepresentations
and out right misinformation about
Free at Last was overwhelming.
I jet us begin our story by clarify
ing who we are. Free at Last is an
agency at the beginning of a dream.
Free at Last currently operates an
out patient treatment program in
East Palo Alto. This program is the
first step in our vision for providing
a continuum of recovery-related
services in East Palo Alto. We serve

almost 100 people per day, working
closely with the City and other ser
vice providers.
We work with persons at high
est risk in our community: persons
with HIV/AIDS, parolees, families
suffering intergenerational addic
tion, survivors of sexual and physi
cal abuse. We are fast becoming
one of the most successful out pa
tient programs in California, a na
tional model for culturally-compe
tent community-based treatment,
and a powerful advocacy voice for
the capacity for human change.
Echoing Green is unique in
their willingness to invest in and
cultivate raw potential. The risk
they took was not only on the
three of us, but also on the vision
for services like ours, not only in
East Palo Alto, but nationally.
Echoing Green took the risk to
prove that change can happen
with faith, undying fight, and a lit
tle start-up capital.
What was The Weekly's story?
We have faith that The Weekly
staff can do much better.
First, the simple things: consis
tently misspelling Natalie Seer's
name and attaching incorrect
funding amounts (which were
based solely on the reporter's as
sumptions). Errors like these are
avoidable by good proof reading
and less assuming on the part of

the reporter.
Second, The Weekly incorrectly
reported that fellows are "quick to
point out problems with Echoing
Green selection process." In fact,
the exact opposite is true. Seer
commented on the process only
when actively solicited to do so.
More importantly .Seer's com
ments regarding Echoing Green
were completely misrepresented
and misquoted. She explained in
detail that Echoing Green began
by recruiting from "Ivy League"
schools and then actively increased
its recruiting sites, expanding to
set a progressive and inclusive
model for other funding agencies.
More disturbing was the stereo
typical slant which was put on The
Weekly's representation of David
Lewis, his role in building Free at
Last, and his involvement wit
Echoing Green.
Ixjwis, Chairman of the Board
and co-founder, was described as a
"non-college graduate, a community
representative" and highlighted was
his self disclosure as "a California
Department of Corrections gradu
ate." This painted Lewis as a lucky
or accidental participant in the dri
ven and motivated plan of two Stan
ford alumnus, a very typical hierar
chical relationship between acade
mia and the community.
In fact, Lewis is the powerful vi

sionary and determiner at Free at
Last. His professional experience
and community leadership often
makes him the guide in our part
nership.
Lewis has worked for local pro
grams, consulted with the Mayor
of East Palo Alto, travels and
speaks nationally, is a community
and social activist for equal rights,
prison reform and HIV education.
Lewis is currently a Substance
Abuse Specialist for The San
Mateo County AIDS Program.
The article represented him
only by their social labels, a reflec
tion of the twisted and trapped
logic of the institution.
This leads into our final point.
The article contained a direct mis
representation of our feelings
about him becoming a community
fellow for Echoing Green. It is
frustrating to us that The Weekly
picked out and highlighted the
sensationalistic and incorrectly-in
terpreted quote of "that ain't shit"
from a 20 minute interview.
Lewis being honored as com
munity fellow within Echoing
Green is one of the most exciting
and innovative steps in the philan
thropic community. Lewis does
not fit the traditional profile of
Echoing Green or any other fel
lowship program.
Once again Echoing Green has

shown incredible foresight and vi
sion to add him to the team of peo
ple in which they are investing.
Echoing Green recognizes that
equal partnerships between acade
mia and community are the key to
creating viable solutions. For a lit
tle translation of our East Palo
Alto slang, what David said is
"This is just the beginning!"
We acknowledge that some of
these errors are due to the quick
turn-over time of reporting. But
some of these mistakes are a re
flection of reporters sitting in a cu
bicle in a Stanford Weekly office
trying to meet the deadline, often
forgetting that the world out there
is reacting and being shaped by the
information which reporters put
out there. Incorrect information is
damaging and has consequences.
Free at Last has built bridges
between convicts and collegiates,
venture capital and East Palo Alto,
but the miracle is that once these
bridges are built the labels no
longer apply, we transcend â€” we
embody the ability to become Free
at Last. . .and THAT ain't shit.
Sincerely,
David Lewis
