## Athletes granted continuance LaRocca pleads no contest; Dallimore almost fined $2,000 
### Janar Stewart Staff writer 
Like a two-toed sloth, the van
dalism cases involving six Stanford
students are tarrying along the
course to a fair resolution.
Last week a Palo Alto judge
granted juniors Thomas Irwin and
Todd Laßocca, both facing felony
charges for allegedly vandalizing the
"Gay Liberation" statue, a continu
ance of their case until August 5.
Along with four other Stanford
athletes, Irwin and Laßocca stand
accused of ramming the bronze
sculpture — a replica of two homo
sexual couples conversing — with
a park bench and splattering it
with black paint after leaving a fra
ternity party at the Delta Tau
Delta house.
Irwin's lawyer John Hack
mann, though, maintains that
Irwin's case revolves more around
"bad judgment" and "following
along with the crowd " than bigotry
toward homosexuals. Irwin still
has not decided whether to enter a
not guilty or a nolo contendere
plea, Hackmann added.
"It's difficult for the court
process to work fairly when minor
crimes are [charged as] felonies,"

he said. Hackmann, offering an ex
planation for the deliberate crawl
of the judicial process, said, "The
reason it's taking so long for a res
olution is the fact that [the case] is
probably charged too heavily."
While they are also alleged par
ticipants in the statue's deface
ment, juniors Mark Butterfield
and Robert Gardner and sopho
mores Brian Dallimore and Jason

White face lesser
misdemeanor
charges. Their
case also was
postponed be
cause neither
Dallimore nor
his lawyer at
tended Monday's
arraignment.
Acting on Dai-

limore's behalf, Butterfield's
lawyer Bob Carey swayed the
judge from issuing the athlete a
$2,000 bench warrant, assuring
him that Dallimore's absence
must have been due to a schedul
ing conflict.
Laßocca's lawyer, Anthony Gi
acalone, said that Laßocca will
enter a plea of nolo contendere
next month because he wants the
process to end quickly.

"Todd feels very badly," Gi
acalone said, adding that Laßocca
indicated his remorse for any dis
turbance he may have caused in
the gay community by his actions.
"He already has met with gay and
lesbian organizations on campus
[to apologize]."
Deputy District Attorney Va
lerie Marchant said that the proba
tion officers record constructive
behavior — such as apologies to
the affected groups — in reports
which will affect judges' decisions
in later hearings.
"One factor [considered in sen
tencing] is, what is a defendant's
attitude," she added. A potential
sentence could consist of restitu
tion for physical damage to the
statue, hours of community ser
vice, attendance at an educational
program or dialogue between the
vandals and the gay community,
Marchant continued.
She said, however, that she be
lieves the punishment should in
clude "something that gives back
to the gay community because of
the nature of the case."
Hackmann said it was "very
likely" that the sentences will re
quire the students to formally
apologize to the gay community.
