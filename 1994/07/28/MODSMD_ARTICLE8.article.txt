# Dish repaired after four months
## Insurance company refuses to pay $100,000 price tag 
### Jo Marshall Staff writer 
Following four months with its nose in the
ground, the Dish was fixed in time to monitor
Jupiter's bombardment, but the insurance company
refused to pay the $100,000 repair costs.
"[The insurance company] claimed because [the
damage] was caused by lack of maintenance, it was
not their responsibility," Stanford Research Insti
tute Project Manager Mike Cousins said.
The Dish — which crashed to the ground March
18 — became partially operational July 9.
"It's essentially finished ... just a few details
need to be taken care," Cousins said.
The repairs, which included a "heck of a lot of weld
ing" and replacing "bent pieces," according to Cousins,
have cost SRI in the region of $100,000 because the in
surance company refuses to cover the costs.
He added that he did not know whether SRI
would contend this decision but he believes they will
be meeting with the insurance company to discuss
the issue.
The Dish fell when SRI workers, examining the
Dish's antennae, were attempting to lower the
13,000 pound tripod mechanism — the part with the
antenna that extends out front — when the cable
holding the mechanism broke.

"The ultimate cause of the disaster was because
of lack of maintenance.... The lifting cable for the
tripod should be replaced every five years," said
Cousins, explaining that the cable that snapped was
24 years old. "Management has got the message now
that there has to be more maintenance," he added.
To avoid such a disaster from reoccurring, the
Dish's maintenance group is expanding to include
some mechanical engineers, and the whole group is
also being charged to "become more aware of prob
lems and to follow a set procedure when encounter
ing them," Cousins said.
"Don't just try to fix it by messing around ... get
it in a safe condition then find out what's wrong," he
added.
Since July 9, SRI and Starlab staff members Ivan
Linscott and Joe Twicken have been monitoring
whether naturally occurring low frequency radio
emissions from Jupiter have been affected by the re
cent belting of comets, Cousins said.
He explained they wanted the Dish fixed in time
to "look at Jupiter" and that only a few minor re
pairs — including replacing the last two red aircraft
warning lights — need to be done before the Dish is
fully repaired.
The additional repairs will only take a couple of
days to finish and should be done in the next two
weeks, according to Cousins.
