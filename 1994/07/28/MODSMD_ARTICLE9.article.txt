# One card does it all
## Universal IDs to be given by winter term 
### Allison Short Editorial staff 
Multi-purpose photo identifi
cation cards for students, faculty
and staff will replace the current
system of separate identification

and meal cards
by the end of
this fall quarter.
"The idea is
for students to
get one card
and keep it for
four years,"
said Assoc.
Registrar Jack
Farrell, also the

project manager.
The new cards will feature a
digitized, color photograph and
a bar-coded information strip
which will be stored in a comput
er database system. Students,
faculty and staff will immediate
ly be able to use the ID cards in
dining services, libraries and
athletic facilities, Farrell said.
"The primary idea is to make

a card more convenient to the
students," Registrar Roger
Printup said. "This one card will
eventually provide every service
the University has to offer."
In the future, the cards will
be used at Cowell Student
Health Center, as well as to
make purchases at the Book
store, Tresidder Union and pos
sibly campus vending and wash
ing machines. Printup added
that he hopes the card can be
used "in any application where
there's a financial transaction."
Farrell added that the cards
might even replace dorm keys
for access into residencies.
"The technology which has
evolved offers us a lot of differ
ent options for different func
tions," Farrell said.
According to Farrell, the idea
of universal IDs has been dis
cussed since the mid 1980s, but
the latest discussions began last
spring. A task force, chaired by
