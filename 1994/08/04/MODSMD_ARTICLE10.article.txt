# Med Center must comply with federal subpoena
## 
### Patricia Henley Staff writer 
Under subpoena, Stanford
Medical Center is one of more
than 100 hospitals scrambling to
gather data concerning Medicare
billings for experimental cardiac
devices — part of a federal investi
gation that could lead to millions
of dollars in fines and limits on
emerging technology.
The Medical Center has until
Aug. 29 to comply with the sub
poena from the Department of
Health and Human Services, said
Rodney Johnson, managing attor
ney for medical affairs. This is "a
fairly aggressive deadline" consid
ering the size of the request, he
said.
The subpoena contains a three

page list of cardiovascular devices
and manufacturers. Stanford
must examine eight years of
records to report if Medicare was
billed for any use of devices not
approved by the Food and Drug
Administration. Some of the
items include pacemakers, cardiac
valves and cardiac catheters.
The subpoena also questions
possible kickbacks for the use of
these devices. Johnson expressed
confidence that Medical Center
purchases are made appropriately
and within regulations.
The immediate problem is that
hospital records are organized by
patient name, not by the name of a
device or manufacturer, Johnson
said. It will take a lot of hard work
to collect the information, he
added.
In the long run, this investi
gation may clarify standards in
the multibillion-dollar industry.
Currently, hospitals perceive
many gray areas in billing regu
lations, Johnson said.
The subpoena appears to fol
low the standard that all devices
must be approved by the FDA in
order to qualify for Medicare
payment. However, Johnson

said that billing practices have
allowed the use of unapproved
devices when the physician con
siders it "reasonable and neces
sary." Adoption of the more
stringent standard could have a
strong impact, Johnson said.
"This may stifle the develop
ment of cardiac interventional
devices," he added.
Surgeons might be forced to
use devices that are out-of-date
but FDA-approved. This could
cause stagnation in what is now
a rapidly developing field.
In addition, if Medicare won't
cover medical devices not yet ap

proved by the FDA, patients
might choose to pay the costs
themselves. This would limit ac
cess to developing technology to
people with money or outside in
surance.
Federal investigators would
not comment on the probe. How
ever, if found guilty of improper
Medicare billings, hospitals
could be fined twice the amount
of the bills, plus $2,000 for each
case. Considering the number of
heart-device surgeries done at
the institutions under investiga
tion, the total amount of the
fines could be substantial.
