# Med Center must comply with federal subpoena

Under subpoena, Stanford
Medical Center is one of more
than 100 hospitals scrambling to
gather data concerning Medicare
billings for experimental cardiac
devices â€” part of a federal investi
gation that could lead to millions
of dollars in fines and limits on
emerging technology.
The Medical Center has until
Aug. 29 to comply with the sub
poena from the Department of
Health and Human Services, said
Rodney Johnson, managing attor
ney for medical affairs. This is "a
fairly aggressive deadline" consid
ering the size of the request, he
said.
The subpoena contains a three

page list of cardiovascular devices
and manufacturers. Stanford
must examine eight years of
records to report if Medicare was
billed for any use of devices not
approved by the Food and Drug
Administration. Some of the
items include pacemakers, cardiac
valves and cardiac catheters.
The subpoena also questions
possible kickbacks for the use of
these devices. Johnson expressed
confidence that Medical Center
purchases are made appropriately
and within regulations.
The immediate problem is that
hospital records are organized by
patient name, not by the name of a
device or manufacturer, Johnson
said. It will take a lot of hard work
