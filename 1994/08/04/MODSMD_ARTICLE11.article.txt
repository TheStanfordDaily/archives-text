# OB-GYN answers major concerns
## Report responds to weaknesses in four areas of residency program 
### Jo Marshall Staff writer 
The School of Medicine's Gyne
cology and Obstetrics Department
met its August 1 deadline to re
spond to the weaknesses in four
areas of its residency program
which were jeopardizing its accred
itation status.
The department sent a report —
which addresses these weaknesses
— to the Accreditation Council for
Graduate Medical Education's OB
GYN residency review committee
on Monday, Associate Dean of Med
ical Student and Graduate Affairs
Dr. James McGuire said.
"The report addresses their
major concerns," McGuire said.
The actions taken by the Med
ical School follow a review in July
by the independent organization
that accredits medical schools. The
council informed the department
that improvements needed to be
made in order for the program,
which is presently "provisionally
accredited," to become "fully ac
credited."
The Medical School had until
August 1 to respond or the pro
gram's accreditation status could
be put "at risk," McGuire had said
previously.
The program was found to be de

ficient in the volume of patient
cases the residents see within cer
tain areas of genetics testing, urolo
gy, surgery and potential female re
productive cancer for the standards
set by the accreditation council.
The report — compiled by the
Chairman of the Department of
Gynecology and Obstetrics Dr.
Mary Polan, with the assistance of
Dr. Maurice Druzin, Dr. Emmet
Lamb and Associate Hospital Di
rector for Patient Care Sharon Hol
lander — responds to each of these
areas.
Responding to the lack of resi
dents partaking in genetics testing,
the Medical School report ex
plained that the State of California
does not allow residents to perform
testing, McGuire said.
However, after checking with
other California universities, it ap
peared that most schools do allow
residents to perform genetics test
ing. The department subsequently
decided "to allow residents to in
crease involvement in amniocente
sis," McGuire said.
"We were the only ones that
complied with the rules and now we
are simply doing what other [Cali
fornia] schools are doing," he
added.
As for the numbers of patients
required to be seen by residents in

areas of potential reproductive can
cer, the department has since
found cases that had not previously
been recorded. This has now in
creased the volumes of patients
seen in this area up to standard.
To address the lack of patients
seen in areas of urology, McGuire
explained that, "Agreements have
been reached with the Department
of Urology to increase collabora
tion with them to increase the vol
ume of cases seen by residents."
In addition to this, efforts have
also been made within the depart
ment to set up their own proce
dures which will overlap with those
from the Department of Urology.
The report also stated that
"agreements are underway with
other medical institutions in the
Bay Area" to increase the volume of
patients seen by residents in cer
tain areas of surgery. However,
McGuire said he could not specify
at this time which institutions will
be involved.
The department will now have
to wait until late October for the ac
creditation committee to make
their decision on the accreditation
status of the residency program. If
a program is unaccredited, its resi
dents would have difficulty becom
ing board-certified as physicians,
McGuire said.
