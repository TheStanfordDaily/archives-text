## Anytime, anywhere New software to provide Shakepeare plays on-line 
### Sona Sharma 
Imagine what it would be like
to watch Shakespearean plays on
your computer — at home or in
class — almost any time you
wanted to do so. To be able to
enter a word, a line or a charac
ter's name on the computer, and
then, lo and behold, have the de
sired moment of any play on your
screen.
Along with two English pro
fessors at the Massachusetts In
stitute of Technology, Stanford
English Prof. Larry Friedlander
is creating software that will
make this midsummer night's
dream a reality.
The project has two parallel
but separate parts, Friedlander
said. One is to develop an applica
tion for educational use.
The software will enable peo
ple to "study performances as well
as have access to the many differ
ent kinds of texts that you need to
do a serious study of Shake
speare," Friedlander said. The
users will require a Macintosh
computer, laser-disc player and
laser discs with films of Shake
spearean production. According
to Friedlander, there are as many
as 25 such discs in the market.
For example, if one wants to
watch different versions of Ham
let, the software will search and
display the various editions along
with any notes or comments that
are relevant to the topic. Anyone
interested in making a multi
media notebook can do so by as
sembling excerpts from the as
sortment of videos and commen
taries provided.
"One of the things we want
most is to allow the users as much
freedom as possible to use the ma
terial," Friedlander said. "We are
not trying to prepare an edition of
Shakespeare. We are really giving

the tools to people to make their
own editions."
Along with images, some tech
nical notes on films and perfor
mances have been added, Fried
lander said. People interested in
the intricacies of film making —
like studying different shots and
angles or analyzing script and per
formance — will find aids that will
facilitate finding such informa
tion.
The second part of the project
involves developing a tool which
can be used in library archives. To
this end, Friedlander and others
are working with the Folger
Shakespeare Library in Washing
ton in a project that will eventual
ly put large amounts of Folger's
holdings on-line.
The idea of putting Shake
speare on-line started in the
1980s when Friedlander felt that
some students' lack of exposure to
Shakespearean performances led
to difficulties in their understand
ing of the plays. "The scripts were
written to be performed and not to
be read," Friedlander said.
With this problem in mind,
Friedlander created a video disc
that had a series of clips from
Shakespearean plays. Each clip
had different versions performed
by different groups, enabling stu
dents to compare various inter
pretations of the same scene.
This application for Shake
spearean theater was done in col
laboration with Apple Comput
ers, Inc. The present software is a
newer version of the same.
The National Endowment for
the Humanities and MIT are
funding the current project.
Friedlander said efforts are being
made to keep the cost of the soft
ware as affordable as possible.
This dream project will most
probably hit the markets in the
spring of 1995, he said.
