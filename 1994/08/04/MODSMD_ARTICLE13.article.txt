### Allison Short Editorial staff 
After a review at the end of
last spring by the Interfraternity
Council and the Greek Judicial
Board, the Alpha Epsilon Pi fra
ternity was not found guilty of
any rush violations.
During rush, held last spring,
members of AEPi were charged
with allegedly trying to move
into the Kappa Alpha house.
AEPi members supposedly left
messages for KA members in
which they implied that the
AEPi pledges had pretended to
be KA pledges in order to live in
the KA house.
The Interfraternity Council
(IFC) and Greek Judicial Board
investigated these charges as
well as a claim that AEPi, an un
housed fraternity, promised
housing to its rushees.
According to Director of Student
Activities Nanci Howe, "No formal
violation of rush was found."

The decision was voted upon
by the Greek Judicial Board, a
group comprised of five elected
students and Howe, and the IFC,
the governing body of all campus
fraternities.
According to Howe, two dif
ferent violations can take place
during rush. Fraternities can vi
olate the University policy,
which prohibits alcohol usage
during rush, or they can break
the IFC rush rules that are es
tablished by fraternity mem
bers.
Fraternal Adviser Heather
Dunn, who advises the IFC, said
that "there wasn't any clear vio
lation of the rush policy or the
University policy."
Howe added that the only dif
ficulties members of AEPi pre
sented during rush were ques
tions regarding "their lack of
spirit of rush and behavior prob
lems." However, she emphasized
that they "didn't violate any pol
icy."
