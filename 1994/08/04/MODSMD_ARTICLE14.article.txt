# Breyer sworn in as 108th justice
## Fourth Stanford grad to serve on Supreme Court 
### Frank Guinan Editorial staff with AP wire reports 
Judge Stephen Breyer was
sworn in yesterday as the na
tion's 108 th Supreme Court jus
tice in a private ceremony con
ducted by fellow Stanford alum
nus and Chief Justice William
Rehnquist.
In an 87-9 vote last Friday,
the Senate overwhelmingly con
firmed Breyer's appointment,
making him the fourth Stanford
graduate currently sitting on the
nation's highest court.
Breyer was at the White
House when he heard of his con
firmation, after which he
pledged *\o help make the law
work better r or people."
He later added, "I look for
ward to _crving on the Supreme
Court. The responsibility of that
position is awesome, rather
humbling."
Law Prof. Kathleen Sullivan,
who earlier testified in favor of
Breyer in front of the Senate Ju
diciary Committee, said that his
confirmation was "great news,
but no surprise."
Sullivan taught at Harvard
Law School alongside Breyer,
and said after his initial nomina
tion, "This is someone who
works well with others, can work
in the spirit of compromise and
will get along with the moderate
centrists."
After Breyer's Senate confir
mation, Clinton said, "This gen
tleman has set an example of ex
cellence and fidelity to the law
and the Constitution of which
every American can be proud."
Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-
Mass., joined Clinton in praising
Breyer, saying, "Judge Breyer is
extraordinarily well-qualifed to
serve on the nation's highest
court."
All nine opposing votes Friday
came from Republican senators.
Leading the criticism of Brey
er was Sen. Richard Lugar, R-
Ind., who said Breyer showed
"extraordinarily bad judgment"
in investing in Lloyd's of London
insurance syndicates, which

could force him to stay out of nu
merous Supreme Court cases in
volving toxic waste and asbestos.
"You can't hold justices to a
standard where they can't invest
in anything," Sullivan said in re
sponse. She also added, "[Brey
er] is very scrupulous about de
taching himself [from those situ
ations]."
Breyer has said he would ex
tricate himself from the Lloyd's
investment as soon as possible.
The early swearing-in cere
mony gives Breyer plenty of time
to begin work before the Court's
fall term opens on Oct. 3. A pub
lic ceremony is scheduled to take

place on Aug. 11 at the White
House.
Breyer was a member of Stan
ford's Class of '59 and con
tributed to the Senate Judiciary
Committee as chief counsel in
1979-1980.
For the past 14 years, Breyer
served as chief judge of the Ist
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Replacing retired Justice
Harry Blackmun, Breyer is Pres
ident Clinton's second Supreme
Court appointee. Along with
Rehnquist, Breyer joins fellow
Stanford alumni Anthony
Kennedy and Sandra Day O'Con
nor on the court.
