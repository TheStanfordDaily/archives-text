# Fifty Years Ago: The Farm at War
## 
### 
Nineteen forty-four was the year of
Betty Smith's novel "A Tree
Grows in Brooklyn," the Andrews
Sisters and "Going My Way." It
was also the year of D-Day, the Battle of the
Bulge and Leyte Gulf. Throughout the United
States, the lives and experiences of the Amer
ican people were shaped by both of these sets
of forces.
Things were no different at Stanford; in
fact, due to its position on the Pacific Rim,
Stanford witnessed and participated in many
of the changes and upheavals triggered by the
war.
Nineteen forty-four, in particular, saw
Stanford at the height of its military conver
sion. Whether it was demonstrated by the
thousands of soldiers who trained and took
classes at the Farm, or the frequent war-bond
drives, or students working swing shifts at
local industries, 1944 witnessed the high
water mark of Stanford's military efforts.
Fifty years later, the war years still repre
sent the best — and worst — of both Stan
ford and the American nation. It was a time
when both overcame enormous obstacles and
put forth unprecedented efforts in pursuit of a
common goal, yet also a period when both fell
far short of their Constitutional and moral
standards.
The home front
At Stanford itself, the effects of the war in
1944 were felt everywhere, from "meatless
Wednesdays" to dateless weekends to bond
drives to frequent mourning for classmates
killed in the war.
In fact, the war permeated into almost

every aspect of campus life, with the occasion
al obituary on the front page of The Daily only
the most striking reminder of the far-off bat
tlefields.
Common to life at the time was, among
other things, war rationing. Included in the
list of rationed items were meat, sugar and
paper, which were conserved in order to pro
vide the armies with enough supplies to fight
the war.
"We were always conscious of the war ...
because of the rationing that was going on,"
said Barbara Hill (then Barbara White),
ASSU president for the 1944-1945 academic
year. She added that she remembered the
"meatless Wednesdays" and other promo
tional efforts to help wartime conservation
programs.
According to Hill, hosiery was also rationed
because the material was needed for such ma
terials like parachutes. She added that the
dress code for women had to be changed in
1944 because of that fact. "The conduct for a
Stanford woman was very strict," she said.
Perhaps the most striking war-forced
move, at least in modern observers' eyes, was
the cancellation of the seasons of Stanford's
intercollegiate athletic teams for the 1944-
1945 academic year.
The Board of Trustees decided to discon
tinue sports on the Farm for several reasons,
among which were transportation problems
and the fact that many of the "great" athletes
were off fighting the war. The trustees also
reasoned that when a team does poorly, the
coach receives undeserved blame and the Uni
versity loses money. As a result, not one foot
ball game was played on the Farm against any
other college team in 1944.
"Football just didn't seem important in the
whole spectrum of things," Hill said.
With no football team to boast about, stu
dents temporarily put their traditional rivalry
with UC-Berkeley on hold. Fortunately for
the University, the Big Game Axe was already
in Stanford's possession before the football
season was canceled.
In a show of good sportsmanship, however,
UC-Berkeley gave Stanford students an open
invitation to go to Berkeley Stadium and
watch the USC-California football match-up.
Before the night of that "big game," students
held the traditional bonfire as well as the all
campus rally.
It is unclear, however, for which team stu
dents rooted. While The Daily encouraged
students to cheer for USC, Hill remembered
that students were "clad in blue and gold in
stead of the traditional cardinal red."
Adding cheer to the campus
According to Luana Hammett (then Luana
Forkner), ASSU vice president for the 1943-
1944 academic year, life at Stanford during
the war was rather simple and "not unpleas
ant." She said that she herself had "no recol
lections of deprivation" during that time.
"We just carried on," she said. "We were
just happy to be attending Stanford at the
time."
As part of her duties as vice president,
Hammett said that she continued to keep the
activities calendar going. These activities in
cluded such things as dances, barbecues and
hikes in the foothills.

"We had fairly strong class unity back
then," Hammett said, citing such social func
tions as the Sophomore Cotillion, Junior
Prom and Senior Ball.
In addition, in 1944 the campus also held a
mock presidential election between New York
Gov. Thomas Dewey and Pres. Franklin Roo
sevelt. Headlines of four years later were pre
saged by The Daily's announcement that
"Dewey Wins Election!" by a tally 0f857 to 385.
However, social activities at Stanford's fra
ternities were curbed because many members
were away from campus fighting in the war.
Local alumni of the University and of the local
chapters supported the fraternities during
this time, allowing the houses to stay open
while most of the men were away.
While fraternity houses were kept run
ning, the spring of 1944 saw the abolishment
of sororities on campus. On April 26 of that
year, University President Dr. Donald Tresid
der declared that all sororities would be dis
banded. After Tresidder made the announce
ment at the Education Auditorium, the audi
ence spontaneously broke into the Stanford
Hymn.
"Nobody kind of said or did anything about
it," Hammett said. "We all supported him."
Hammett added that she believed the abol
ishment was due to a variety of coinciding fac
tors. First of all, she said, the dean of women
at the time came from a "very upscale school"
and was opposed to the idea of sororities. Sec
ondly, there were no fraternity men around to
"protect them."
Internment
Similarly, there were few who were willing
to assist the 24 Japanese students evacuated
from the campus and put in a series of con
centration camps during the war.
In May, 1942, these 24 saw a notice outside
of their Japanese Students' House which an
nounced their immediate evacuation from
campus.
"Before that, Stanford was a lot different
from the situation off-campus," said Wataru
Takeshita, one of the internees. "Off campus,
there was a lot of hostility (toward Japanese-
Americans). On campus, that hostility wasn't
there. For example, people would be listening
to the radio about the war, and we'd come over
and talk about it, and they'd never even look
oddly at me."
He added, "In December, 1941, right after
Pearl Harbor, I tried to go home to Fresno
County for Christmas vacation. But the at
tendants at the Palo Alto bus station wouldn't
even let me buy a ticket; they said, 'Don't you
know you have a curfew.' Luckily, though, a
Stanford student was nice enough to drive me
all the way home."
However, by May, 1942, Takeshita found
himself at a makeshift evacuee center at the
Santa Anita Racetrack in Southern Califor
nia, along with many other Japanese-Ameri
cans. Earlier that month, he had been forced
to leave the Stanford campus, and wrote an
article on the move for The Daily the evening
before he was scheduled to depart.
For a time, Takeshita and other graduat
ing seniors feared that they would be deprived
of their diplomas, since they were being evac
uated a few weeks before 1942's final exams.
"We weren't sure we could graduate," he

said, "but the trustees got together, and fig
ured we were close enough."
By 1944, while the campus was holding
bond drives and dime-a-dance benefits,
Takeshita was in an Arizona camp, having
been transferred from a Wyoming evacuee
center earlier that year. He remained in Ari
zona until the following year, when hostilities
ended in the Pacific.
Now, Takeshita, who returned to campus
last year for a remembrance of the intern
ment, can reflect on his experience. "As far as
the United States was concerned it wasn't a
big deal, because it was only many thousands
of people in a nation of many millions," he
said. "But to us, it was a big matter; all of our
people were told to uproot themselves from
their homes in the west. It meant saying good
bye to our homes."
Including Stanford.
Training for the front
Perhaps the most prominent change in
campus life during the war years was the in
troduction of the Army Specialized Training
Program, in which soldiers lived on campus
and attended army classes in engineering and
pre-medical studies, as well as courses on the
language and culture of Germany and Japan.
At its high-water mark in 1943, the ASTP
program included up to 2,400 soldiers, equiv
alent to half the undergraduate enrollment.
For winter quarter, 1944, this figure stood at
1,689. And though the ASTP was scaled back
later in 1944, giving only 450 soldiers a chance
to study on the Farm in the spring, the sol
diers' presence was still clearly felt.
In fact, while at Stanford, the soldiers often
played the part of full-time college students.
The ASTP soldiers had their own Army Stu
dent Council, lived in Encina, Toyon, Branner
and other University dorms, went to Univer
sity-sponsored dances and even formed intra
mural sports leagues.
Despite the presence of the ASTP soldiers,
the fact that more and more civilian students
were being shipped out to regular service led
to a unique developmer.. In the spring of
1944, for the first time ati.. anford, even when
ASTP students were in uded there were
more women undergrade, es than men, by a
ratio of 1.05:1
Enrollment, however, was less than 2,500
students for that term, and due to the call-ups
of military reserve units, fewer than half of
those students eligible to receive degrees
could come hear Henry Luce speak at Com
mencement.
"The bulk of the men left in 1943," Hill ex
plained. Before 1943, enrollment figures for
undergraduates reached nearly 4,500, with
the men outnumbering the women by about
two to one.
A decreased number of men meant a
change in lifestyle for the women on campus.
Hammett said she knew many women who
"went through their entire college careers
without dates."
However, by late 1944, many returning
veterans had begun to come calling on the
Farm. That fall, 85 former soldiers were en
rolled at Stanford, many of them having been
swayed by their ASTP experiences. These sol
diers would be the first, wave of young men in
fluenced by the newly passed G.I. Bill's gener-

ous provisions, a harbinger of the
postwar college boom.
Working the swing shift
Whether on a volunteer basis or
as a paying job, many Stanford stu
dents found time to labor in the war
industries in 1944.
For example, many students
were asked by the Stanford War
Board, which coordinated scholars'
war-work activities, to help farmers
pick crops in the fields. "I remember
the appeal for workers to help pick
walnuts and tomatoes. ... It was all
meant to help the harvesters and
support the war effort," Hill said.
"We did these chores for [the
War Board]. We were in the fields
harvesting.... It was really very
minor; no big deal," Hammett said.
Other duties assigned by the
War Board included office work in
the War Board office and efforts as
a nurse's aide, Canteen hostess,
bandage roller or Daily writer. Will
ing students fdled out pledge cards
for the work, vowing that they
would spend eight hours per week
at their war-related job.
Other students worked in near
by canneries, military industries or
served in the WAVES, WACS or
WAFS, the female auxiliaries of the
Navy, Army and Army Air Force. In
addition, many professors were
asked to use their teaching skills to
assist the war effort; over 40 in
structors spent the war at military
plants and research centers.
Even Stanford coursework got
into the act; a few "non-essential"
classes were replaced with courses
in such subjects as shipfitting and
foreign languages.
Hill said that students were con
stantly encouraged to purchase war
bonds and stamps to support the
war effort. Because of these stamps
and bonds, the atmosphere on cam
pus was definitely "more serious,"
she added.
"(The war] was constantly sur
rounding you," she said. "Bond dri
ves and stamp books were always
reminding you of the war."
The campus also hosted several
salvage drives, collecting such items
as "rags, not necessarily washed;
inner tubes, but no other rubber;
metals, including copper, lead, zinc,
brass, iron, but no galvanized or
sheet iron or light black tin; and

paper," in the words of one adver
tisement.
If the war was not enough to add
to the seriousness of the bond sales,
in January and February of 1944
UC-Berkeley challenged Stanford to
a bond-sale contest, with the winner
to receive control of the Axe.
Though Stanford declined to use the
Axe, which at the time was in its pos
session, as a reward, they did receive
Cal's blue-and-gold banner when
they defeated the Bears in the drive.
Good-bye to a friend
Finally, 1944 was an important,
and sad, time for The Stanford
Daily, for in that year The Daily lost
a member of its extended family.
In late April, Hid Shafer, former
Daily editor in chief, marine flyer,
and member of Stanford's Class of
'42, was killed in action.
After graduating, Shafer, known
as "Shaf" to his friends, enlisted in
naval air corps with 30 other Stan
ford students in a group known as
the "Flying Indians." He served in
the militaiy until his death that
April night.
His death hit The Daily hard, but
it was a time of war, and emotion
had to be given a lower rank than
necessity. So the following, un
signed editorial and the accompany
ing news story were the only men
tion of Shafer's passing.
Dear Shaf.. .
1 don't know why it should be you
who isn't coming back. I don't un
derstand it, yet that's what the
paper said this morning. But it's
not right. You made your place in
the world, and no one can take that
place.
You've left something behind,
Shaf. Not just memories. I'd like to
call it spirit in I wing. We '11 guard it
well because it's something each
member of the old staff felt but often
failed to express.
There arcn't many of the old staff
around anymore. We should all be
back together again, and you
should be writing this column. But
columns change in newspapers.
Our work changes and our life. But
I wanted to come back to your office
just once more and remember the
spring of 1942 and try in some way
to say we 're going to miss you very
much.
Nineteen forty-four was the year of
Betty Smith's novel "A Tree

war.
Nineteen forty-four, in particular, saw
Stanford at the height of its military conver
sion. Whether it was demonstrated by the
thousands of soldiers who trained and took
classes at the Farm, or the frequent war-bond
drives, or students working swing shifts at
local industries, 1944 witnessed the high
water mark of Stanford's military efforts.
Fifty years later, the war years still repre
sent the best — and worst — of both Stan
ford and the American nation. It was a time
when both overcame enormous obstacles and
put forth unprecedented efforts in pursuit of a
common goal, yet also a period when both fell
far short of their Constitutional and moral
standards.
The home front
At Stanford itself, the effects of the war in
1944 were felt everywhere, from "meatless
Wednesdays" to dateless weekends to bond
drives to frequent mourning for classmates
killed in the war.
In fact, the war permeated into almost

every aspect of campus life, with the occasion
al obituary on the front page of The Daily only
the most striking reminder of the far-off bat
tlefields.
Common to life at the time was, among
other things, war rationing. Included in the
list of rationed items were meat, sugar and
paper, which were conserved in order to pro
vide the armies with enough supplies to fight
the war.
"We were always conscious of the war ...
because of the rationing that was going on,"
said Barbara Hill (then Barbara White),
ASSU president for the 1944-1945 academic
year. She added that she remembered the
"meatless Wednesdays" and other promo
tional efforts to help wartime conservation
programs.
According to Hill, hosiery was also rationed
because the material was needed for such ma
terials like parachutes. She added that the
dress code for women had to be changed in
1944 because of that fact. "The conduct for a
Stanford woman was very strict," she said.
Perhaps the most striking war-forced
move, at least in modern observers' eyes, was
the cancellation of the seasons of Stanford's
intercollegiate athletic teams for the 1944-
1945 academic year.
The Board of Trustees decided to discon
tinue sports on the Farm for several reasons,
among which were transportation problems
and the fact that many of the "great" athletes
were off fighting the war. The trustees also
reasoned that when a team does poorly, the
coach receives undeserved blame and the Uni
versity loses money. As a result, not one foot
ball game was played on the Farm against any
other college team in 1944.
"Football just didn't seem important in the
whole spectrum of things," Hill said.
With no football team to boast about, stu
dents temporarily put their traditional rivalry
with UC-Berkeley on hold. Fortunately for
the University, the Big Game Axe was already
in Stanford's possession before the football
season was canceled.
In a show of good sportsmanship, however,
UC-Berkeley gave Stanford students an open
invitation to go to Berkeley Stadium and
watch the USC-California football match-up.
Before the night of that "big game," students
held the traditional bonfire as well as the all
campus rally.
It is unclear, however, for which team stu
dents rooted. While The Daily encouraged
students to cheer for USC, Hill remembered
that students were "clad in blue and gold in
stead of the traditional cardinal red."
Adding cheer to the campus
According to Luana Hammett (then Luana
Forkner), ASSU vice president for the 1943-
1944 academic year, life at Stanford during
the war was rather simple and "not unpleas
ant." She said that she herself had "no recol
lections of deprivation" during that time.
"We just carried on," she said. "We were
just happy to be attending Stanford at the
time."
As part of her duties as vice president,
Hammett said that she continued to keep the
activities calendar going. These activities in
cluded such things as dances, barbecues and
hikes in the foothills.

"We had fairly strong class unity back
then," Hammett said, citing such social func
tions as the Sophomore Cotillion, Junior
Prom and Senior Ball.
In addition, in 1944 the campus also held a
mock presidential election between New York
Gov. Thomas Dewey and Pres. Franklin Roo
sevelt. Headlines of four years later were pre
saged by The Daily's announcement that
"Dewey Wins Election!" by a tally 0f857 to 385.
However, social activities at Stanford's fra
ternities were curbed because many members
were away from campus fighting in the war.
Local alumni of the University and of the local
chapters supported the fraternities during
this time, allowing the houses to stay open
while most of the men were away.
While fraternity houses were kept run
ning, the spring of 1944 saw the abolishment
of sororities on campus. On April 26 of that
year, University President Dr. Donald Tresid
der declared that all sororities would be dis
banded. After Tresidder made the announce
ment at the Education Auditorium, the audi
ence spontaneously broke into the Stanford
Hymn.
"Nobody kind of said or did anything about
it," Hammett said. "We all supported him."
Hammett added that she believed the abol
ishment was due to a variety of coinciding fac
tors. First of all, she said, the dean of women
at the time came from a "very upscale school"
and was opposed to the idea of sororities. Sec
ondly, there were no fraternity men around to
"protect them."
Internment
Similarly, there were few who were willing
to assist the 24 Japanese students evacuated
from the campus and put in a series of con
centration camps during the war.
In May, 1942, these 24 saw a notice outside
of their Japanese Students' House which an
nounced their immediate evacuation from
campus.
"Before that, Stanford was a lot different
from the situation off-campus," said Wataru
Takeshita, one of the internees. "Off campus,
there was a lot of hostility (toward Japanese-
Americans). On campus, that hostility wasn't
there. For example, people would be listening
to the radio about the war, and we'd come over
and talk about it, and they'd never even look
oddly at me."
He added, "In December, 1941, right after
Pearl Harbor, I tried to go home to Fresno
County for Christmas vacation. But the at
tendants at the Palo Alto bus station wouldn't
even let me buy a ticket; they said, 'Don't you
know you have a curfew.' Luckily, though, a
Stanford student was nice enough to drive me
all the way home."
However, by May, 1942, Takeshita found
himself at a makeshift evacuee center at the
Santa Anita Racetrack in Southern Califor
nia, along with many other Japanese-Ameri
cans. Earlier that month, he had been forced
to leave the Stanford campus, and wrote an
article on the move for The Daily the evening
before he was scheduled to depart.
For a time, Takeshita and other graduat
ing seniors feared that they would be deprived
of their diplomas, since they were being evac
uated a few weeks before 1942's final exams.
"We weren't sure we could graduate," he

said, "but the trustees got together, and fig
ured we were close enough."
By 1944, while the campus was holding
bond drives and dime-a-dance benefits,
Takeshita was in an Arizona camp, having
been transferred from a Wyoming evacuee
center earlier that year. He remained in Ari
zona until the following year, when hostilities
ended in the Pacific.
Now, Takeshita, who returned to campus
last year for a remembrance of the intern
ment, can reflect on his experience. "As far as
the United States was concerned it wasn't a
big deal, because it was only many thousands
of people in a nation of many millions," he
said. "But to us, it was a big matter; all of our
people were told to uproot themselves from
their homes in the west. It meant saying good
bye to our homes."
Including Stanford.
Training for the front
Perhaps the most prominent change in
campus life during the war years was the in
troduction of the Army Specialized Training
Program, in which soldiers lived on campus
and attended army classes in engineering and
pre-medical studies, as well as courses on the
language and culture of Germany and Japan.
At its high-water mark in 1943, the ASTP
program included up to 2,400 soldiers, equiv
alent to half the undergraduate enrollment.
For winter quarter, 1944, this figure stood at
1,689. And though the ASTP was scaled back
later in 1944, giving only 450 soldiers a chance
to study on the Farm in the spring, the sol
diers' presence was still clearly felt.
In fact, while at Stanford, the soldiers often
played the part of full-time college students.
The ASTP soldiers had their own Army Stu
dent Council, lived in Encina, Toyon, Branner
and other University dorms, went to Univer
sity-sponsored dances and even formed intra
mural sports leagues.
Despite the presence of the ASTP soldiers,
the fact that more and more civilian students
were being shipped out to regular service led
to a unique developmer.. In the spring of
1944, for the first time ati.. anford, even when
ASTP students were in uded there were
more women undergrade, es than men, by a
ratio of 1.05:1
Enrollment, however, was less than 2,500
students for that term, and due to the call-ups
of military reserve units, fewer than half of
those students eligible to receive degrees
could come hear Henry Luce speak at Com
mencement.
"The bulk of the men left in 1943," Hill ex
plained. Before 1943, enrollment figures for
undergraduates reached nearly 4,500, with
the men outnumbering the women by about
two to one.
A decreased number of men meant a
change in lifestyle for the women on campus.
Hammett said she knew many women who
"went through their entire college careers
without dates."
However, by late 1944, many returning
veterans had begun to come calling on the
Farm. That fall, 85 former soldiers were en
rolled at Stanford, many of them having been
swayed by their ASTP experiences. These sol
diers would be the first, wave of young men in
fluenced by the newly passed G.I. Bill's gener-

ous provisions, a harbinger of the
postwar college boom.
Working the swing shift
Whether on a volunteer basis or
as a paying job, many Stanford stu
dents found time to labor in the war
industries in 1944.
For example, many students
were asked by the Stanford War
Board, which coordinated scholars'
war-work activities, to help farmers
pick crops in the fields. "I remember
the appeal for workers to help pick
walnuts and tomatoes. ... It was all
meant to help the harvesters and
support the war effort," Hill said.
"We did these chores for [the
War Board]. We were in the fields
harvesting.... It was really very
minor; no big deal," Hammett said.
Other duties assigned by the
War Board included office work in
the War Board office and efforts as
a nurse's aide, Canteen hostess,
bandage roller or Daily writer. Will
ing students fdled out pledge cards
for the work, vowing that they
would spend eight hours per week
at their war-related job.
Other students worked in near
by canneries, military industries or
served in the WAVES, WACS or
WAFS, the female auxiliaries of the
Navy, Army and Army Air Force. In
addition, many professors were
asked to use their teaching skills to
assist the war effort; over 40 in
structors spent the war at military
plants and research centers.
Even Stanford coursework got
into the act; a few "non-essential"
classes were replaced with courses
in such subjects as shipfitting and
foreign languages.
Hill said that students were con
stantly encouraged to purchase war
bonds and stamps to support the
war effort. Because of these stamps
and bonds, the atmosphere on cam
pus was definitely "more serious,"
she added.
"(The war] was constantly sur
rounding you," she said. "Bond dri
ves and stamp books were always
reminding you of the war."
The campus also hosted several
salvage drives, collecting such items
as "rags, not necessarily washed;
inner tubes, but no other rubber;
metals, including copper, lead, zinc,
brass, iron, but no galvanized or
sheet iron or light black tin; and

paper," in the words of one adver
tisement.
If the war was not enough to add
to the seriousness of the bond sales,
in January and February of 1944
UC-Berkeley challenged Stanford to
a bond-sale contest, with the winner
to receive control of the Axe.
Though Stanford declined to use the
Axe, which at the time was in its pos
session, as a reward, they did receive
Cal's blue-and-gold banner when
they defeated the Bears in the drive.
Good-bye to a friend
Finally, 1944 was an important,
and sad, time for The Stanford
Daily, for in that year The Daily lost
a member of its extended family.
In late April, Hid Shafer, former
Daily editor in chief, marine flyer,
and member of Stanford's Class of
'42, was killed in action.
After graduating, Shafer, known
as "Shaf" to his friends, enlisted in
naval air corps with 30 other Stan
ford students in a group known as
the "Flying Indians." He served in
the militaiy until his death that
April night.
His death hit The Daily hard, but
it was a time of war, and emotion
had to be given a lower rank than
necessity. So the following, un
signed editorial and the accompany
ing news story were the only men
tion of Shafer's passing.
Dear Shaf.. .
1 don't know why it should be you
who isn't coming back. I don't un
derstand it, yet that's what the
paper said this morning. But it's
not right. You made your place in
the world, and no one can take that
place.
You've left something behind,
Shaf. Not just memories. I'd like to
call it spirit in I wing. We '11 guard it
well because it's something each
member of the old staff felt but often
failed to express.
There arcn't many of the old staff
around anymore. We should all be
back together again, and you
should be writing this column. But
columns change in newspapers.
Our work changes and our life. But
I wanted to come back to your office
just once more and remember the
spring of 1942 and try in some way
to say we 're going to miss you very
much.
Nineteen forty-four was the year of
Betty Smith's novel "A Tree
Grows in Brooklyn," the Andrews
Sisters and "Going My Way." It
was also the year of D-Day, the Battle of the
Bulge and Leyte Gulf. Throughout the United
States, the lives and experiences of the Amer
ican people were shaped by both of these sets
of forces.
Things were no different at Stanford; in
fact, due to its position on the Pacific Rim,
Stanford witnessed and participated in many
of the changes and upheavals triggered by the

put forth unprecedented efforts in pursuit of a
common goal, yet also a period when both fell
far short of their Constitutional and moral
standards.
The home front
At Stanford itself, the effects of the war in
1944 were felt everywhere, from "meatless
Wednesdays" to dateless weekends to bond
drives to frequent mourning for classmates
killed in the war.
In fact, the war permeated into almost

every aspect of campus life, with the occasion
al obituary on the front page of The Daily only
the most striking reminder of the far-off bat
tlefields.
Common to life at the time was, among
other things, war rationing. Included in the
list of rationed items were meat, sugar and
paper, which were conserved in order to pro
vide the armies with enough supplies to fight
the war.
"We were always conscious of the war ...
because of the rationing that was going on,"
said Barbara Hill (then Barbara White),
ASSU president for the 1944-1945 academic
year. She added that she remembered the
"meatless Wednesdays" and other promo
tional efforts to help wartime conservation
programs.
According to Hill, hosiery was also rationed
because the material was needed for such ma
terials like parachutes. She added that the
dress code for women had to be changed in
1944 because of that fact. "The conduct for a
Stanford woman was very strict," she said.
Perhaps the most striking war-forced
move, at least in modern observers' eyes, was
the cancellation of the seasons of Stanford's
intercollegiate athletic teams for the 1944-
1945 academic year.
The Board of Trustees decided to discon
tinue sports on the Farm for several reasons,
among which were transportation problems
and the fact that many of the "great" athletes
were off fighting the war. The trustees also
reasoned that when a team does poorly, the
coach receives undeserved blame and the Uni
versity loses money. As a result, not one foot
ball game was played on the Farm against any
other college team in 1944.
"Football just didn't seem important in the
whole spectrum of things," Hill said.
With no football team to boast about, stu
dents temporarily put their traditional rivalry
with UC-Berkeley on hold. Fortunately for
the University, the Big Game Axe was already
in Stanford's possession before the football
season was canceled.
In a show of good sportsmanship, however,
UC-Berkeley gave Stanford students an open
invitation to go to Berkeley Stadium and
watch the USC-California football match-up.
Before the night of that "big game," students
held the traditional bonfire as well as the all
campus rally.
It is unclear, however, for which team stu
dents rooted. While The Daily encouraged
students to cheer for USC, Hill remembered
that students were "clad in blue and gold in
stead of the traditional cardinal red."
Adding cheer to the campus
According to Luana Hammett (then Luana
Forkner), ASSU vice president for the 1943-
1944 academic year, life at Stanford during
the war was rather simple and "not unpleas
ant." She said that she herself had "no recol
lections of deprivation" during that time.
"We just carried on," she said. "We were
just happy to be attending Stanford at the
time."
As part of her duties as vice president,
Hammett said that she continued to keep the
activities calendar going. These activities in
cluded such things as dances, barbecues and
hikes in the foothills.

"We had fairly strong class unity back
then," Hammett said, citing such social func
tions as the Sophomore Cotillion, Junior
Prom and Senior Ball.
In addition, in 1944 the campus also held a
mock presidential election between New York
Gov. Thomas Dewey and Pres. Franklin Roo
sevelt. Headlines of four years later were pre
saged by The Daily's announcement that
"Dewey Wins Election!" by a tally 0f857 to 385.
However, social activities at Stanford's fra
ternities were curbed because many members
were away from campus fighting in the war.
Local alumni of the University and of the local
chapters supported the fraternities during
this time, allowing the houses to stay open
while most of the men were away.
While fraternity houses were kept run
ning, the spring of 1944 saw the abolishment
of sororities on campus. On April 26 of that
year, University President Dr. Donald Tresid
der declared that all sororities would be dis
banded. After Tresidder made the announce
ment at the Education Auditorium, the audi
ence spontaneously broke into the Stanford
Hymn.
"Nobody kind of said or did anything about
it," Hammett said. "We all supported him."
Hammett added that she believed the abol
ishment was due to a variety of coinciding fac
tors. First of all, she said, the dean of women
at the time came from a "very upscale school"
and was opposed to the idea of sororities. Sec
ondly, there were no fraternity men around to
"protect them."
Internment
Similarly, there were few who were willing
to assist the 24 Japanese students evacuated
from the campus and put in a series of con
centration camps during the war.
In May, 1942, these 24 saw a notice outside
of their Japanese Students' House which an
nounced their immediate evacuation from
campus.
"Before that, Stanford was a lot different
from the situation off-campus," said Wataru
Takeshita, one of the internees. "Off campus,
there was a lot of hostility (toward Japanese-
Americans). On campus, that hostility wasn't
there. For example, people would be listening
to the radio about the war, and we'd come over
and talk about it, and they'd never even look
oddly at me."
He added, "In December, 1941, right after
Pearl Harbor, I tried to go home to Fresno
County for Christmas vacation. But the at
tendants at the Palo Alto bus station wouldn't
even let me buy a ticket; they said, 'Don't you
know you have a curfew.' Luckily, though, a
Stanford student was nice enough to drive me
all the way home."
However, by May, 1942, Takeshita found
himself at a makeshift evacuee center at the
Santa Anita Racetrack in Southern Califor
nia, along with many other Japanese-Ameri
cans. Earlier that month, he had been forced
to leave the Stanford campus, and wrote an
article on the move for The Daily the evening
before he was scheduled to depart.
For a time, Takeshita and other graduat
ing seniors feared that they would be deprived
of their diplomas, since they were being evac
uated a few weeks before 1942's final exams.
"We weren't sure we could graduate," he

said, "but the trustees got together, and fig
ured we were close enough."
By 1944, while the campus was holding
bond drives and dime-a-dance benefits,
Takeshita was in an Arizona camp, having
been transferred from a Wyoming evacuee
center earlier that year. He remained in Ari
zona until the following year, when hostilities
ended in the Pacific.
Now, Takeshita, who returned to campus
last year for a remembrance of the intern
ment, can reflect on his experience. "As far as
the United States was concerned it wasn't a
big deal, because it was only many thousands
of people in a nation of many millions," he
said. "But to us, it was a big matter; all of our
people were told to uproot themselves from
their homes in the west. It meant saying good
bye to our homes."
Including Stanford.
Training for the front
Perhaps the most prominent change in
campus life during the war years was the in
troduction of the Army Specialized Training
Program, in which soldiers lived on campus
and attended army classes in engineering and
pre-medical studies, as well as courses on the
language and culture of Germany and Japan.
At its high-water mark in 1943, the ASTP
program included up to 2,400 soldiers, equiv
alent to half the undergraduate enrollment.
For winter quarter, 1944, this figure stood at
1,689. And though the ASTP was scaled back
later in 1944, giving only 450 soldiers a chance
to study on the Farm in the spring, the sol
diers' presence was still clearly felt.
In fact, while at Stanford, the soldiers often
played the part of full-time college students.
The ASTP soldiers had their own Army Stu
dent Council, lived in Encina, Toyon, Branner
and other University dorms, went to Univer
sity-sponsored dances and even formed intra
mural sports leagues.
Despite the presence of the ASTP soldiers,
the fact that more and more civilian students
were being shipped out to regular service led
to a unique developmer.. In the spring of
1944, for the first time ati.. anford, even when
ASTP students were in uded there were
more women undergrade, es than men, by a
ratio of 1.05:1
Enrollment, however, was less than 2,500
students for that term, and due to the call-ups
of military reserve units, fewer than half of
those students eligible to receive degrees
could come hear Henry Luce speak at Com
mencement.
"The bulk of the men left in 1943," Hill ex
plained. Before 1943, enrollment figures for
undergraduates reached nearly 4,500, with
the men outnumbering the women by about
two to one.
A decreased number of men meant a
change in lifestyle for the women on campus.
Hammett said she knew many women who
"went through their entire college careers
without dates."
However, by late 1944, many returning
veterans had begun to come calling on the
Farm. That fall, 85 former soldiers were en
rolled at Stanford, many of them having been
swayed by their ASTP experiences. These sol
diers would be the first, wave of young men in
fluenced by the newly passed G.I. Bill's gener-

ous provisions, a harbinger of the
postwar college boom.
Working the swing shift
Whether on a volunteer basis or
as a paying job, many Stanford stu
dents found time to labor in the war
industries in 1944.
For example, many students
were asked by the Stanford War
Board, which coordinated scholars'
war-work activities, to help farmers
pick crops in the fields. "I remember
the appeal for workers to help pick
walnuts and tomatoes. ... It was all
meant to help the harvesters and
support the war effort," Hill said.
"We did these chores for [the
War Board]. We were in the fields
harvesting.... It was really very
minor; no big deal," Hammett said.
Other duties assigned by the
War Board included office work in
the War Board office and efforts as
a nurse's aide, Canteen hostess,
bandage roller or Daily writer. Will
ing students fdled out pledge cards
for the work, vowing that they
would spend eight hours per week
at their war-related job.
Other students worked in near
by canneries, military industries or
served in the WAVES, WACS or
WAFS, the female auxiliaries of the
Navy, Army and Army Air Force. In
addition, many professors were
asked to use their teaching skills to
assist the war effort; over 40 in
structors spent the war at military
plants and research centers.
Even Stanford coursework got
into the act; a few "non-essential"
classes were replaced with courses
in such subjects as shipfitting and
foreign languages.
Hill said that students were con
stantly encouraged to purchase war
bonds and stamps to support the
war effort. Because of these stamps
and bonds, the atmosphere on cam
pus was definitely "more serious,"
she added.
"(The war] was constantly sur
rounding you," she said. "Bond dri
ves and stamp books were always
reminding you of the war."
The campus also hosted several
salvage drives, collecting such items
as "rags, not necessarily washed;
inner tubes, but no other rubber;
metals, including copper, lead, zinc,
brass, iron, but no galvanized or
sheet iron or light black tin; and

paper," in the words of one adver
tisement.
If the war was not enough to add
to the seriousness of the bond sales,
in January and February of 1944
UC-Berkeley challenged Stanford to
a bond-sale contest, with the winner
to receive control of the Axe.
Though Stanford declined to use the
Axe, which at the time was in its pos
session, as a reward, they did receive
Cal's blue-and-gold banner when
they defeated the Bears in the drive.
Good-bye to a friend
Finally, 1944 was an important,
and sad, time for The Stanford
Daily, for in that year The Daily lost
a member of its extended family.
In late April, Hid Shafer, former
Daily editor in chief, marine flyer,
and member of Stanford's Class of
'42, was killed in action.
After graduating, Shafer, known
as "Shaf" to his friends, enlisted in
naval air corps with 30 other Stan
ford students in a group known as
the "Flying Indians." He served in
the militaiy until his death that
April night.
His death hit The Daily hard, but
it was a time of war, and emotion
had to be given a lower rank than
necessity. So the following, un
signed editorial and the accompany
ing news story were the only men
tion of Shafer's passing.
Dear Shaf.. .
1 don't know why it should be you
who isn't coming back. I don't un
derstand it, yet that's what the
paper said this morning. But it's
not right. You made your place in
the world, and no one can take that
place.
You've left something behind,
Shaf. Not just memories. I'd like to
call it spirit in I wing. We '11 guard it
well because it's something each
member of the old staff felt but often
failed to express.
There arcn't many of the old staff
around anymore. We should all be
back together again, and you
should be writing this column. But
columns change in newspapers.
Our work changes and our life. But
I wanted to come back to your office
just once more and remember the
spring of 1942 and try in some way
to say we 're going to miss you very
much.
Nineteen forty-four was the year of
Betty Smith's novel "A Tree
Grows in Brooklyn," the Andrews
Sisters and "Going My Way." It
was also the year of D-Day, the Battle of the
Bulge and Leyte Gulf. Throughout the United
States, the lives and experiences of the Amer
ican people were shaped by both of these sets
of forces.
Things were no different at Stanford; in
fact, due to its position on the Pacific Rim,
Stanford witnessed and participated in many
of the changes and upheavals triggered by the
war.
Nineteen forty-four, in particular, saw
Stanford at the height of its military conver
sion. Whether it was demonstrated by the
thousands of soldiers who trained and took
classes at the Farm, or the frequent war-bond
drives, or students working swing shifts at
local industries, 1944 witnessed the high
water mark of Stanford's military efforts.
Fifty years later, the war years still repre
sent the best — and worst — of both Stan
ford and the American nation. It was a time
when both overcame enormous obstacles and
put forth unprecedented efforts in pursuit of a
common goal, yet also a period when both fell
far short of their Constitutional and moral
standards.

the most striking reminder of the far-off bat
tlefields.
Common to life at the time was, among
other things, war rationing. Included in the
list of rationed items were meat, sugar and
paper, which were conserved in order to pro
vide the armies with enough supplies to fight
the war.
"We were always conscious of the war ...
because of the rationing that was going on,"
said Barbara Hill (then Barbara White),
ASSU president for the 1944-1945 academic
year. She added that she remembered the
"meatless Wednesdays" and other promo
tional efforts to help wartime conservation
programs.
According to Hill, hosiery was also rationed
because the material was needed for such ma
terials like parachutes. She added that the
dress code for women had to be changed in
1944 because of that fact. "The conduct for a
Stanford woman was very strict," she said.
Perhaps the most striking war-forced
move, at least in modern observers' eyes, was
the cancellation of the seasons of Stanford's
intercollegiate athletic teams for the 1944-
1945 academic year.
The Board of Trustees decided to discon
tinue sports on the Farm for several reasons,
among which were transportation problems
and the fact that many of the "great" athletes
were off fighting the war. The trustees also
reasoned that when a team does poorly, the
coach receives undeserved blame and the Uni
versity loses money. As a result, not one foot
ball game was played on the Farm against any
other college team in 1944.
"Football just didn't seem important in the
whole spectrum of things," Hill said.
With no football team to boast about, stu
dents temporarily put their traditional rivalry
with UC-Berkeley on hold. Fortunately for
the University, the Big Game Axe was already
in Stanford's possession before the football
season was canceled.
In a show of good sportsmanship, however,
UC-Berkeley gave Stanford students an open
invitation to go to Berkeley Stadium and
watch the USC-California football match-up.
Before the night of that "big game," students
held the traditional bonfire as well as the all
campus rally.
It is unclear, however, for which team stu
dents rooted. While The Daily encouraged
students to cheer for USC, Hill remembered
that students were "clad in blue and gold in
stead of the traditional cardinal red."
Adding cheer to the campus
According to Luana Hammett (then Luana
Forkner), ASSU vice president for the 1943-
1944 academic year, life at Stanford during
the war was rather simple and "not unpleas
ant." She said that she herself had "no recol
lections of deprivation" during that time.
"We just carried on," she said. "We were
just happy to be attending Stanford at the
time."
As part of her duties as vice president,
Hammett said that she continued to keep the
activities calendar going. These activities in
cluded such things as dances, barbecues and
hikes in the foothills.

"We had fairly strong class unity back
then," Hammett said, citing such social func
tions as the Sophomore Cotillion, Junior
Prom and Senior Ball.
In addition, in 1944 the campus also held a
mock presidential election between New York
Gov. Thomas Dewey and Pres. Franklin Roo
sevelt. Headlines of four years later were pre
saged by The Daily's announcement that
"Dewey Wins Election!" by a tally 0f857 to 385.
However, social activities at Stanford's fra
ternities were curbed because many members
were away from campus fighting in the war.
Local alumni of the University and of the local
chapters supported the fraternities during
this time, allowing the houses to stay open
while most of the men were away.
While fraternity houses were kept run
ning, the spring of 1944 saw the abolishment
of sororities on campus. On April 26 of that
year, University President Dr. Donald Tresid
der declared that all sororities would be dis
banded. After Tresidder made the announce
ment at the Education Auditorium, the audi
ence spontaneously broke into the Stanford
Hymn.
"Nobody kind of said or did anything about
it," Hammett said. "We all supported him."
Hammett added that she believed the abol
ishment was due to a variety of coinciding fac
tors. First of all, she said, the dean of women
at the time came from a "very upscale school"
and was opposed to the idea of sororities. Sec
ondly, there were no fraternity men around to
"protect them."
Internment
Similarly, there were few who were willing
to assist the 24 Japanese students evacuated
from the campus and put in a series of con
centration camps during the war.
In May, 1942, these 24 saw a notice outside
of their Japanese Students' House which an
nounced their immediate evacuation from
campus.
"Before that, Stanford was a lot different
from the situation off-campus," said Wataru
Takeshita, one of the internees. "Off campus,
there was a lot of hostility (toward Japanese-
Americans). On campus, that hostility wasn't
there. For example, people would be listening
to the radio about the war, and we'd come over
and talk about it, and they'd never even look
oddly at me."
He added, "In December, 1941, right after
Pearl Harbor, I tried to go home to Fresno
County for Christmas vacation. But the at
tendants at the Palo Alto bus station wouldn't
even let me buy a ticket; they said, 'Don't you
know you have a curfew.' Luckily, though, a
Stanford student was nice enough to drive me
all the way home."
However, by May, 1942, Takeshita found
himself at a makeshift evacuee center at the
Santa Anita Racetrack in Southern Califor
nia, along with many other Japanese-Ameri
cans. Earlier that month, he had been forced
to leave the Stanford campus, and wrote an
article on the move for The Daily the evening
before he was scheduled to depart.
For a time, Takeshita and other graduat
ing seniors feared that they would be deprived
of their diplomas, since they were being evac
uated a few weeks before 1942's final exams.
"We weren't sure we could graduate," he

said, "but the trustees got together, and fig
ured we were close enough."
By 1944, while the campus was holding
bond drives and dime-a-dance benefits,
Takeshita was in an Arizona camp, having
been transferred from a Wyoming evacuee
center earlier that year. He remained in Ari
zona until the following year, when hostilities
ended in the Pacific.
Now, Takeshita, who returned to campus
last year for a remembrance of the intern
ment, can reflect on his experience. "As far as
the United States was concerned it wasn't a
big deal, because it was only many thousands
of people in a nation of many millions," he
said. "But to us, it was a big matter; all of our
people were told to uproot themselves from
their homes in the west. It meant saying good
bye to our homes."
Including Stanford.
Training for the front
Perhaps the most prominent change in
campus life during the war years was the in
troduction of the Army Specialized Training
Program, in which soldiers lived on campus
and attended army classes in engineering and
pre-medical studies, as well as courses on the
language and culture of Germany and Japan.
At its high-water mark in 1943, the ASTP
program included up to 2,400 soldiers, equiv
alent to half the undergraduate enrollment.
For winter quarter, 1944, this figure stood at
1,689. And though the ASTP was scaled back
later in 1944, giving only 450 soldiers a chance
to study on the Farm in the spring, the sol
diers' presence was still clearly felt.
In fact, while at Stanford, the soldiers often
played the part of full-time college students.
The ASTP soldiers had their own Army Stu
dent Council, lived in Encina, Toyon, Branner
and other University dorms, went to Univer
sity-sponsored dances and even formed intra
mural sports leagues.
Despite the presence of the ASTP soldiers,
the fact that more and more civilian students
were being shipped out to regular service led
to a unique developmer.. In the spring of
1944, for the first time ati.. anford, even when
ASTP students were in uded there were
more women undergrade, es than men, by a
ratio of 1.05:1
Enrollment, however, was less than 2,500
students for that term, and due to the call-ups
of military reserve units, fewer than half of
those students eligible to receive degrees
could come hear Henry Luce speak at Com
mencement.
"The bulk of the men left in 1943," Hill ex
plained. Before 1943, enrollment figures for
undergraduates reached nearly 4,500, with
the men outnumbering the women by about
two to one.
A decreased number of men meant a
change in lifestyle for the women on campus.
Hammett said she knew many women who
"went through their entire college careers
without dates."
However, by late 1944, many returning
veterans had begun to come calling on the
Farm. That fall, 85 former soldiers were en
rolled at Stanford, many of them having been
swayed by their ASTP experiences. These sol
diers would be the first, wave of young men in
fluenced by the newly passed G.I. Bill's gener-

ous provisions, a harbinger of the
postwar college boom.
Working the swing shift
Whether on a volunteer basis or
as a paying job, many Stanford stu
dents found time to labor in the war
industries in 1944.
For example, many students
were asked by the Stanford War
Board, which coordinated scholars'
war-work activities, to help farmers
pick crops in the fields. "I remember
the appeal for workers to help pick
walnuts and tomatoes. ... It was all
meant to help the harvesters and
support the war effort," Hill said.
"We did these chores for [the
War Board]. We were in the fields
harvesting.... It was really very
minor; no big deal," Hammett said.
Other duties assigned by the
War Board included office work in
the War Board office and efforts as
a nurse's aide, Canteen hostess,
bandage roller or Daily writer. Will
ing students fdled out pledge cards
for the work, vowing that they
would spend eight hours per week
at their war-related job.
Other students worked in near
by canneries, military industries or
served in the WAVES, WACS or
WAFS, the female auxiliaries of the
Navy, Army and Army Air Force. In
addition, many professors were
asked to use their teaching skills to
assist the war effort; over 40 in
structors spent the war at military
plants and research centers.
Even Stanford coursework got
into the act; a few "non-essential"
classes were replaced with courses
in such subjects as shipfitting and
foreign languages.
Hill said that students were con
stantly encouraged to purchase war
bonds and stamps to support the
war effort. Because of these stamps
and bonds, the atmosphere on cam
pus was definitely "more serious,"
she added.
"(The war] was constantly sur
rounding you," she said. "Bond dri
ves and stamp books were always
reminding you of the war."
The campus also hosted several
salvage drives, collecting such items
as "rags, not necessarily washed;
inner tubes, but no other rubber;
metals, including copper, lead, zinc,
brass, iron, but no galvanized or
sheet iron or light black tin; and

paper," in the words of one adver
tisement.
If the war was not enough to add
to the seriousness of the bond sales,
in January and February of 1944
UC-Berkeley challenged Stanford to
a bond-sale contest, with the winner
to receive control of the Axe.
Though Stanford declined to use the
Axe, which at the time was in its pos
session, as a reward, they did receive
Cal's blue-and-gold banner when
they defeated the Bears in the drive.
Good-bye to a friend
Finally, 1944 was an important,
and sad, time for The Stanford
Daily, for in that year The Daily lost
a member of its extended family.
In late April, Hid Shafer, former
Daily editor in chief, marine flyer,
and member of Stanford's Class of
'42, was killed in action.
After graduating, Shafer, known
as "Shaf" to his friends, enlisted in
naval air corps with 30 other Stan
ford students in a group known as
the "Flying Indians." He served in
the militaiy until his death that
April night.
His death hit The Daily hard, but
it was a time of war, and emotion
had to be given a lower rank than
necessity. So the following, un
signed editorial and the accompany
ing news story were the only men
tion of Shafer's passing.
Dear Shaf.. .
1 don't know why it should be you
who isn't coming back. I don't un
derstand it, yet that's what the
paper said this morning. But it's
not right. You made your place in
the world, and no one can take that
place.
You've left something behind,
Shaf. Not just memories. I'd like to
call it spirit in I wing. We '11 guard it
well because it's something each
member of the old staff felt but often
failed to express.
There arcn't many of the old staff
around anymore. We should all be
back together again, and you
should be writing this column. But
columns change in newspapers.
Our work changes and our life. But
I wanted to come back to your office
just once more and remember the
spring of 1942 and try in some way
to say we 're going to miss you very
much.
