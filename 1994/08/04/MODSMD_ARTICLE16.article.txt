# April 13,1944: A letter from the front lines
## 
### 
Editor's note: This is a letter printed in
The Daily on April 13, 1944, written by
Lieut. Louis Means of the Army Air Corps.
Means graduated from Stanford in 1941,
enlisted as an Aviation Cadet in October of
the same year, received his commission in
the summer of '42, went overseas in
March, 1943, and was shot down two
months later over Germany when acting
as a navigator on a B-17 bomber. This let
ter describes this last flight and his treat
ment on landing.
We had just returned from an en
joyable 48-hour pass in Lon
don, a bit tired and ready for
bed. Though it was nearly mid
night, I decided to write a quick V-mail let
ter to my wife, just in the event we were
called on a mission the following morning
and might not come back.
I had also made the remark to my bom
bardier that I'd settle to come out of "this
mess" with a bunged-up arm or leg and
consider myself lucky. Little did I realize
that these two foreboding warnings of the
subconscious would become realities be
fore another 12 hours had passed.
Wakened at 3:30 a.m.
At 3:30 a.m. we were awakened, told to
dress and eat and be in the briefing room
an hour later. Sleepy as we were, the
prospect of a mission set us on edge and we
hurried through preparations to take to
the air. The briefing gave our targets as
Wilhelmshaven, Germany, with takeoff
set for 7 o'clock.
Everything went smoothly and by 8
a.m. we had completed our rendezvous
with several other groups and were head
ing northwest over the English Channel.
We were soon deep over a cloudless North
Sea, flying at an altitude 0f23,000 feet and
watching a beautiful sunrise.
First sign of land
We caught first sight of land at 10 a.m.
It was the island of Helgoland, air and

naval base of the enemy off the German
coast. The first few bursts of flak ap
peared, presumably from this island, but
all fell short of the group and no hits were
scored.
As we neared the mainland, our vapor
trails became so thick they looked like
smoke screens laid by protective destroy
ers around us. "Spanky," my bombardier,
and myself were wearing our arms out try
ing to keep the nose windows free from ice.
It was 10:30 when the mainland appeared,
and we knew our target was but a short
half-hour away. In the air, however, even
a minute may seem an eternity.
Fighters at 10 o'clock
Just then our interphone began ringing
with excited voices: "Three fighters at 10
o'clock, seven ME's (Messerschmit fight
ers) at 2 o'clock, 10 coming in at 5 o'clock,
four fighters high at 8," and so forth!
Before one could count to 10 they were
all around us, diving, twisting, firing,
turning, our own guns spatting out a fiery
welcome whenever they came within
range.
Dark puffs of flak began to appear
above and below us, to the front and be
hind us as the shore batteries began to
pick up our group with deadly accuracy.
As I watched the exciting scene, our left
wing ship nosed downward in a gentle
dive, flames pouring from the cabin win
dows. This was the "fort" piloted by Lt.
"Dopey" Mann, the first of three in our
group to meet destruction by German
guns that day. The ship had evidently been
hit by a direct flak burst.
A Sudden Jolt
I jumped to the right nose gun to inter
cept a fighter coming in at abut 2 o'clock
and had just begun firing when, bam! — a
sudden jolt and pain sent me sprawling on
the floor. Either flak or a 20-millimeter
cannon shell had burst in the center of my
ammunition can and dozens of fragments
from the explosion had blown into my

right leg. At the same time the plane
lurched from the formation, seemingly
out of control. My oxygen system had
begun to burn, and red hydraulic fluid
began to drip down from beneath the
pilot's cockpit, so the ship had evidently
been badly hit.
I called Clemons, the pilot, and told him
I was badly wounded and without oxygen.
He told me to prepare to bail out and a few
seconds later the order to "abandon ship"
came over the interphone. I crawled back
to the front escape hatch and pulled the
safety release, but the door refused to fall
off. Finally, in desperation I forced my way
through the door against the terrific wind
stream — a good example of the superhu
man strength a man has when his life is at
stake.
'Don't Pull too Soon,'
As I fell through space my mind cleared,
and my one thought was not to pull the
ripcord too soon or I might die from lack of
oxygen since I had already been without it
for several minutes. At approximately
8,000 feet, after a free fall of 15,000 feet, I
gave a silent prayer and pulled the cord.
"Smack," my chest chute hit me in the
mouth as it pulled open, but what a relief
to see that shielding parasol of white silk
swaying above me. I kept oscillating in
great arcs all the way down, but didn't try
to steady myself with the shroud lines for
fear of spilling the chute.
As I was over water at the time, I tore
off my hat, oxygen mask, throat mike,
gloves, and boots, and inflated my Mae
West life vest. At last I felt free to look
above me. No planes could be seen any
where — only the long, fading vapor trails
far overhead. I could see no other chutes
nor hear a sound. It was like being all alone
in a soundless vacuum.
Played Very Dead
At about 3,000 feet, I could see I was
drifting over a point of land - what a relief!
A few seconds later an Me 109 circled me,

and once again I thought maybe my num
ber was up. I played very dead, thinking
the pilot meant to finish me off, but to my
surprise he gave a friendly wave as he
roared by. Evidently he had just taken my
picture to confirm victory.
My next fear was that I was going to
land in the very center of the town below
me but gradually I blew to its outskirts as
my descent neared its end. Those last 50
feet passed as if I were in an express eleva
tor, and with a thud, there I was in a little
grassy plot between two houses. Once
again the jar had nearly knocked me out,
but I recovered quickly and hastily un
buckled my chute so I wouldn't be dragged
along by a breeze.
Old Lady Waved
The first person I saw was an old lady
who waved to me from over the hedge a
few yards away. Soon I could see people
running toward the spot from every direc
tion. It was all like a movie or a bad dream.
With the clicking of polished heels and the
shouts of "Heil Hitler" as each new per
son ran up, I realized all too clearly I was
now resting on German soil. But what a
different reception than I had expected.
Within a few minutes I had a hot cup of
tea in my hand while a young girl was slit
ting my pant leg and giving first aid to my
wounds.
My first attempt at speaking German,
"Mein Fusz sind Kalt," brought immedi
ate results. They wrapped my legs in my
parachute to keep them warm, and told me
the ambulance would arrive in 10 minutes
to take me to the hospital. The ambulance
did arrive, and half an hour later I was on
the operating table of the big naval hospi
tal in Cuxhaven tended by a surgeon who
spoke perfect English.

Lieut. Means was severely wounded and had
his right leg amputated. After nine months
in German hospitals and the main Air Force
prisoner-of-war camp (Stalag Sufi 3) he was
repatriated to the United States.

the ambulance would arrive in 10 minutes
to take me to the hospital. The ambulance
did arrive, and half an hour later I was on
the operating table of the big naval hospi
tal in Cuxhaven tended by a surgeon who
spoke perfect English.

Lieut. Means was severely wounded and had
his right leg amputated. After nine months
in German hospitals and the main Air Force
prisoner-of-war camp (Stalag Sufi 3) he was
repatriated to the United States.
Editor's note: This is a letter printed in
The Daily on April 13, 1944, written by
Lieut. Louis Means of the Army Air Corps.
Means graduated from Stanford in 1941,
enlisted as an Aviation Cadet in October of
the same year, received his commission in
the summer of '42, went overseas in
March, 1943, and was shot down two
months later over Germany when acting
as a navigator on a B-17 bomber. This let
ter describes this last flight and his treat
ment on landing.
We had just returned from an en
joyable 48-hour pass in Lon
don, a bit tired and ready for
bed. Though it was nearly mid
night, I decided to write a quick V-mail let
ter to my wife, just in the event we were
called on a mission the following morning
and might not come back.
I had also made the remark to my bom
bardier that I'd settle to come out of "this
mess" with a bunged-up arm or leg and
consider myself lucky. Little did I realize
that these two foreboding warnings of the
subconscious would become realities be
fore another 12 hours had passed.
Wakened at 3:30 a.m.
At 3:30 a.m. we were awakened, told to
dress and eat and be in the briefing room
an hour later. Sleepy as we were, the
prospect of a mission set us on edge and we
hurried through preparations to take to
the air. The briefing gave our targets as
Wilhelmshaven, Germany, with takeoff
set for 7 o'clock.
Everything went smoothly and by 8
a.m. we had completed our rendezvous
with several other groups and were head
ing northwest over the English Channel.
We were soon deep over a cloudless North
Sea, flying at an altitude 0f23,000 feet and
watching a beautiful sunrise.
First sign of land
We caught first sight of land at 10 a.m.
It was the island of Helgoland, air and

naval base of the enemy off the German
coast. The first few bursts of flak ap
peared, presumably from this island, but
all fell short of the group and no hits were
scored.
As we neared the mainland, our vapor
trails became so thick they looked like
smoke screens laid by protective destroy
ers around us. "Spanky," my bombardier,
and myself were wearing our arms out try
ing to keep the nose windows free from ice.
It was 10:30 when the mainland appeared,
and we knew our target was but a short
half-hour away. In the air, however, even
a minute may seem an eternity.
Fighters at 10 o'clock
Just then our interphone began ringing
with excited voices: "Three fighters at 10
o'clock, seven ME's (Messerschmit fight
ers) at 2 o'clock, 10 coming in at 5 o'clock,
four fighters high at 8," and so forth!
Before one could count to 10 they were
all around us, diving, twisting, firing,
turning, our own guns spatting out a fiery
welcome whenever they came within
range.
Dark puffs of flak began to appear
above and below us, to the front and be
hind us as the shore batteries began to
pick up our group with deadly accuracy.
As I watched the exciting scene, our left
wing ship nosed downward in a gentle
dive, flames pouring from the cabin win
dows. This was the "fort" piloted by Lt.
"Dopey" Mann, the first of three in our
group to meet destruction by German
guns that day. The ship had evidently been
hit by a direct flak burst.
A Sudden Jolt
I jumped to the right nose gun to inter
cept a fighter coming in at abut 2 o'clock
and had just begun firing when, bam! — a
sudden jolt and pain sent me sprawling on
the floor. Either flak or a 20-millimeter
cannon shell had burst in the center of my
ammunition can and dozens of fragments
from the explosion had blown into my

right leg. At the same time the plane
lurched from the formation, seemingly
out of control. My oxygen system had
begun to burn, and red hydraulic fluid
began to drip down from beneath the
pilot's cockpit, so the ship had evidently
been badly hit.
I called Clemons, the pilot, and told him
I was badly wounded and without oxygen.
He told me to prepare to bail out and a few
seconds later the order to "abandon ship"
came over the interphone. I crawled back
to the front escape hatch and pulled the
safety release, but the door refused to fall
off. Finally, in desperation I forced my way
through the door against the terrific wind
stream — a good example of the superhu
man strength a man has when his life is at
stake.
'Don't Pull too Soon,'
As I fell through space my mind cleared,
and my one thought was not to pull the
ripcord too soon or I might die from lack of
oxygen since I had already been without it
for several minutes. At approximately
8,000 feet, after a free fall of 15,000 feet, I
gave a silent prayer and pulled the cord.
"Smack," my chest chute hit me in the
mouth as it pulled open, but what a relief
to see that shielding parasol of white silk
swaying above me. I kept oscillating in
great arcs all the way down, but didn't try
to steady myself with the shroud lines for
fear of spilling the chute.
As I was over water at the time, I tore
off my hat, oxygen mask, throat mike,
gloves, and boots, and inflated my Mae
West life vest. At last I felt free to look
above me. No planes could be seen any
where — only the long, fading vapor trails
far overhead. I could see no other chutes
nor hear a sound. It was like being all alone
in a soundless vacuum.
Played Very Dead
At about 3,000 feet, I could see I was
drifting over a point of land - what a relief!
A few seconds later an Me 109 circled me,

and once again I thought maybe my num
ber was up. I played very dead, thinking
the pilot meant to finish me off, but to my
surprise he gave a friendly wave as he
roared by. Evidently he had just taken my
picture to confirm victory.
My next fear was that I was going to
land in the very center of the town below
me but gradually I blew to its outskirts as
my descent neared its end. Those last 50
feet passed as if I were in an express eleva
tor, and with a thud, there I was in a little
grassy plot between two houses. Once
again the jar had nearly knocked me out,
but I recovered quickly and hastily un
buckled my chute so I wouldn't be dragged
along by a breeze.
Old Lady Waved
The first person I saw was an old lady
who waved to me from over the hedge a
few yards away. Soon I could see people
running toward the spot from every direc
tion. It was all like a movie or a bad dream.
With the clicking of polished heels and the
shouts of "Heil Hitler" as each new per
son ran up, I realized all too clearly I was
now resting on German soil. But what a
different reception than I had expected.
Within a few minutes I had a hot cup of
tea in my hand while a young girl was slit
ting my pant leg and giving first aid to my
wounds.
My first attempt at speaking German,
"Mein Fusz sind Kalt," brought immedi
ate results. They wrapped my legs in my
parachute to keep them warm, and told me
the ambulance would arrive in 10 minutes
to take me to the hospital. The ambulance
did arrive, and half an hour later I was on
