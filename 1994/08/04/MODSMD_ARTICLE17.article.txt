## Most Versatile professor Best Donation Coordinator Best Conflict Resolver Most Cheerful Embalmer For superlative Stanford Prof. John Dolph, death is a lively matter 
### Kyle Graham 
Two years ago, amid nods to the
"Best Ice Cream" and
"Hottest Clubs" in Peninsula
Magazine's annual "Best and
Worst" issue, Stanford Prof. John
Dolph was crowned the area's
"Most Cheerful Embalmer."
Most Cheerful Embalmer? Or
perhaps the question should be
Most Cheerful Embalmer? Some
how, the mention, while nice,
didn't quite make sense.
But if you're looking for an ex
planation for this curious inclu
sion, don't ask Dolph. "I have no
idea how they came up with that.
At all," he said.
Yet the Stanford professor and
self-described "jack of all trades,"
now entering his fourth decade at
the Farm, certainly merits a su
perlative of some sort. The only dif
ficult task is determining which
term to use.
Most Versatile Professor
In his 30 years at Stanford,
Dolph has served as an embalmer,
presector, administrator, teacher
and head of the program which ob
tains cadavers for research purpos
es. Yet in his mind, the transition
from one position to another has
been only logical.
After earning a master's in zool
ogy from the University of Pacific
and later attending medical school,
Dolph was first hired by Stanford to
head the Animal Care Facility,
which oversees the maintenance of
creatures used in lab-testing on
campus. Then, seven years later, he
switched over to the Department of
Anatomy at the Medical School.
"My job evolved," said Dolph. "I
was hired as an embalmer and pre
sector — that's the person who
does dissections before students
look at the body. Then I started

teaching."
Right now, he said, "I'm actual
ly an instructor of anatomy, but
unlike other professors at Stanford
I run the laboratories, I run the
will-body program and do all the
embalming.... It was just in this
last year that I have gotten a com
panion to help me with the em
balming, so I can spend more of my
time [teaching]."
Currently, Dolph team-teaches
an anatomy class for Medical
School students and a comparable
class for undergraduates. Both
classes, he said, are "fairly de
tailed," and involve significant
amounts of lab work on cadavers.
That's where another of
Dolph's positions comes in handy.
Best Donation Coordinator
Dolph oversees Stanford's will
body program, which procures the
human corpses used for study in
medical classes.
Outlining the process under
which cadavers are obtained,
Dolph stated, "It's usually through
word of mouth, that people indi
cate that they want their body used
for teaching purposes after they
pass away.
"Then we send them a brochure
explaining about the whole pro
gram, and there's some cards that
they sign and send back to us and
are on file with us. We give an extra
card to them to give to their family
or their lawyer, to state that this is
what they want to do."
Indeed, the will-body program is
perhaps the one University dona
tion program that has consistently
exceeded its targets; it has man
aged to acquire enough corpses to
keep the University supplied, with
out any aggressive effort on
Dolph's part. In fact, to borrow a
pun, people are dying to get in.
"We've never advertised or any
thing like that," said Dolph. "The
older generation is quite adept at

networking, and one individual
tells another. We seem to have a lot
of people calling us."
However, Dolph related, once
the would-be donor passes away, it
is up to the deceased's next-of-kin
to inform him that the person has
expired. When this is done, and the
next-of-kin has given their permis
sion for the body to be used for
teaching purposes, Stanford makes
arrangements to obtain the body.
"We will take bodies from the
whole Bay Area," said Dolph. "We
go clear down to Santa Cruz to get
the bodies. If we have to go further
than that, we ask families to help
us out with the cost, but that's the
only expense to the family."
Best Conflict Resolver
Dolph said that since the next
of-kin must contact him to turn
over the cadavers, there is usually
no recalcitrance to cede the body.
"There's never a problem convinc
ing them to give up the body;
they're already convinced that this
is what they, and the deceased,
want," he said.
However, if the family does not
wish to cede the body, Dolph does
not press the issue." If a person's in
cur will program, that's not to say
that we have total rights over
them," he said.
"The remains belong to the next
of kin. For example, you could will
your body to me today, but your
parents, being your next-of-kin,
can overrule what you say."
One difficulty that occasionally
springs up at this stage of procure
ment occurs when a family is divid
ed over what they want to do with
the deceased.
"I've had occasions involving
large families — with multiple sib
lings — where some of the siblings
would want the body to come for
research and others were totally
against it," Dolph said. "And under
those circumstances, if they cannot

work out an agreement, we won't
take [the corpse] because we don't
want a feud to develop."
Yet another problem sometimes
arises, and that's where the cards
come in. "The reason we have the
people fill out the cards is to assure
ourselves that this is what the per
son really wanted, and it's not a rel
ative trying to defer the cost of a
burial and get rid of Uncle Harry
without any expense," Dolph said.
Best Preservation Expert
After obtaining the corpses,
Dolph and his staff must next em
balm the bodies to ensure that they
will be preserved for as long as pos
sible. "Embalming for teaching
purposes is a lot different from em
balming that is done for funeral
homes," said Dolph.
"We want the bodies preserved for
a long time, so they will last," he said.
"We're not concerned with making
the person look natural, or alive
like We're concerned that every
piece, every portion of the body gets
preservative into it."
After being embalmed, the bod
ies are used for research, including
in the classes which Dolph himself
teaches. In addition to teaming up
with three other professors to lead
the Medical School class, Dolph es
sentially flies solo on his in-depth,
two-quarter undergraduate class.
Combined, Dolph's Medical
School and undergraduate classes
alone use 40 corpses for research
each year, leading to a constant
need for more donors.
"We're very lucky in that we
have a will-body program here at
Stanford.... [But] we could always
use more donors," said Dolph.
Cheapest Funeral Operator
After the laboratory work is per
formed, the corpses are cremated
and interred in an unmarked crypt.
All this is done with no cost to the
donating family, something which

Dolph stresses as one of the pro
gram's many benefits.
"Stanford takes care of all
costs," Dolph said. "So in a lot of
cases this helps the families out.
because funerals nowadays are
quite expensive.
He added, "Also, I think that peo
ple get a good feeling knowing their
remains will be used for additional
purposes after they pass away."
Families that wish to obtain the
deceased's ashes or visit the cemetery
where their relation is buried may do
so, Dolph said. However, "[The bod
ies] are put in an unmarked crypt be
cause a lot of people who get into our
program don't want their remains at
a site where their family can go
mourn."
All told, Dolph said his procure
ment activities keep him extremely
busy. "I take body calls 24 hours a
day,"he said. "Our phone service is
here 24 hours, so that when a per
son passes away at night [their
family! can call the phone number
they're given and the operator will
contact me wherever I am on my
beeper so we can take care of
arrangements."
Most Cheerful Embalmer
While Peninsula Magazine's
award may have been unusual, it
was certainly not inaccurate:
Dolph does appear to be an inordi
nately cheerful man. Perhaps this
is because it's a Friday and his va
cation is only hours away; but
Dolph seems enthusiastic and
sanguine even while discussing
the minutiae of the will-body pro
gram.
"It is sort of a macabre profes
sion to be in, and if you treated it as
depressing, you wouldn't stay in it
for long," said Dolph. "So you have
to have some sort of cheerful atti
tude toward the whole thing."
With an attitude like this,
maybe Peninsula Magazine had a
point after all.
