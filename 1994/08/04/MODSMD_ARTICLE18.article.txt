## Ex-Stanford ballplayers swing for stardom 
### Anne Craig 
While the imminent players' strike may
cause the major-league baseball season to
come to an abrupt stop, four ex-Stanford
baseball stars will still be busy hitting it big in
the minor leagues. This summer, Jed
Hansen, Todd Laßocca, Matt Merenghi and
Nate Olmstead are all trying to swing their
way to the big time.
The path to the major leagues runs through

a lot of podunk towns, but, according to Olm
stead, the game makes it all worthwhile. Going
from Palm Drive to coal mines, Olmstead is in
Butte, Mont., playing for the Copper Kings, an
independent team in the Pioneer League. De
spite the enormous shift from malls to mines,
Olmstead said he has seen some beauty in
Montana that California just can't offer. The
biggest advantage of living in Montana? "No
sales tax," Olmstead said.
Right now, the recent graduate is putting

aside his degree in economics and bringing a
.323 batting average to the plate. As of last
week, he had two doubles, one triple and one
home run. Olmstead, who signed with the
Copper Kings as a free agent, hopes someday
to have his contract bought out by a
league club.
For now, Olmstead is adjusting to the dif
ferences between college baseball and the pro
game. "A lot of the players at the professional
level haven't had as much coaching as I got at

Stanford. Some aspects here have regressed,
like the knowledge of the game and game sit
uations — the main reason being that there
are a lot of guys who just graduated from high
school. As for more talent, maybe, but they
just don't know the game as well."
Olmstead is makingjust $850 a month but
he gets along fine. "You hear horror stories
about how poorly you're paid; it's not all that
bad. And the bus trips aren't bad either." He
hopes when the summer season ends he'll
still be in the league. If baseball does not work
out, Olmstead has considered other plans
such as teaching or coaching at a private
school or even starting community sports in
his hometown of Davis, Calif.
Olmstead's former Cardinal teammates,
Laßocca, Merenghi and Hansen, were all
drafted after their junior year at Stanford.
Laßocca and Marenghi, both pitchers, were
taken by the Baltimore Orioles in the sth and
27th rounds respectively. This summer they
are with the Bluefield Orioles in the Ap
palachian League.
Laßocca is overwhelmed by the communi
ty of Bluefield, West Virginia. "It's amazing
how the community supports the program to
the degree they do. We average around 1,500
to 2,000 fans a game." In addition to the dif
ference in attendance between Bluefield and
Stanford, Laßocca is also trying to adjust to a
new approach to the game.
"Professional baseball is more directed to
ward player development and there is less
emphasis on winning," Laßocca said. "I like
the fact that professional baseball is more
laid-back, but as a competitive person, I find it
hard to accept that winning is not the most
important goal."
As for the major leagues, Laßocca said,
"It's something you take day by day; it's out
of your control." But if he strikes out, he
hopes to go back to school, possibly doing
some graduate work in business, or even pur
sue a teaching or coaching career.
Thus far, Laßocca has a 15.43 earned run
average in limited action. Marenghi, Laßoc
ca's roommate, is also playing for Bluefield,
and has posted a record of 1-0 with a 1.38
ERA.
While Laßocca and Marenghi are team
mates in Bluefield, Hansen is a lone star in
Eugene, Ore., where he plays in the North
west league. Hansen is catching the atten
tion of his coaches while keeping the bases hot
with a .280 batting average. As of last week,
he had three doubles, one triple and two home
runs. The second baseman was drafted in the
second round by the Kansas City Royals.
