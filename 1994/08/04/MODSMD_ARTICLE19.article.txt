Goodwill Games:
Cardinal women's volleyball is well represented at
the Goodwill Games, currently taking place in St. Pe
tersburg, Russia. Graduates Kim and Bev Oden are
playing along with junior Caiy Wendell and incoming
frosh Kristin Folkl. The team played against China in
the semifinals last night.
Stanford women's basketball coach Tara Van
derveer is leading team U.SA. at the Goodwill Games
this summer. Playing for Vanderveer are senior An ita
Kaplan and former Cardinal standout Jennifer Azzi.
In the swimming competition, senior Dan Kanner
won a gold medal in the 200-meter freestyle.
Baseball:
Ex-Stanford pitcher Andrew Lorraine has hit the
big time. It took Lorraine only one year after leaving
Stanford to arrive in the major leagues with the Cal
ifornia Angels. Lorraine was called up after compil
ing a 9-3 record and 3.24 earned run average with the
Vancouver Canadians, the Angels' triple-A affiliate.
Through two starts, the left-hander has strug
gled, losing both decisions. In his second start, he was
the unfortunate opposing pitcher of the Texas
Rangers' Kenny Rogers, who threw just the 12th per
fect game in major-league history.
Department of Athletics:
Stanford recently named two new assistant ath
letic directors. Charles Davis and Debbie Co rum
have been hired to replace Tom Beckett, who left to
be the athletic director at Yale University, and Keith
Sparks, who is pursuing business interests in Hous
ton, Texas.
Davis, formerly the Director of the U.S. Olympic
Training Center, will oversee Stanford's athletic
media relations office, marketing office, TV-radio,
ticket office and golf course. Corum leaves her posi
tion as Director of Championships at the Southeast
ern Conference; her responsibilities will include ad
ministrative oversight of between eight and 10 varsi
ty sports as well as the summer sports camps.
