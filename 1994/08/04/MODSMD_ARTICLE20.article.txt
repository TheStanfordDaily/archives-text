# Rhinos and Grizzlies roar and score
## Roller hockey and indoor soccer make noise at San Jose Arena 
### Kyle Utsumi Editorial staff 
The Toronto Maple Leafs may have
dashed the Cinderella hopes of the San
Jose Sharks in last spring's NHL playoffs,
but there is still plenty of hard-hitting ac
tion to be found at the San Jose Arena.
The Sharks, cheered on every step of
the way by the ferocious San Jose fans,
surprised many by winning their first
round series against the Detroit Red
Wings. This summer the Arena has be
come a home for two hockey teams which
are no less fierce — the San Jose Rhinos
and the San Jose Grizzlies.
The Rhinos are keeping hockey alive in
the summer, competing in a league called
Roller Hockey International (RHI). One
major difference between the Sharks and
Rhinos is the availability of seats. While
the Sharks draw capacity crowds to their
games, the Rhinos get a mere fraction of
that. They do, however, have a following
which is nearly as boisterous. In fact, while
many fans are clad in the Rhino's purple,
there is also quite a bit of the Sharks' teal
and black interspersed in the stands.
There are several aspects of the game,
played on in-line skates, which set it apart
from the traditional version of hockey.
Each team fields a goalie and four skaters,
as opposed to five in ice hockey. Although
the rink is the same size in both, the RHI
has eliminated the blue lines to reduce off
sides and stopages of play.
The action is still very quick in the RHI.
A Sport Court surface is the favorite of
players, although a smooth, treated con
crete can also be used. Because there are
fewer players on the rink, roller hockey is

a wide-open game, with plenty of precision
passing and lots of shooting. In a recent
game against the visiting Vancouver
Voodoo, the two teams combined to put 94
shots on goal. The Rhinos pleased the
home crowd with a 10-7 victory, despite
being outshot 55-39.
When the Rhinos aren't jamrun' in
their jungle home, the Grizzlies may be
making noise in the arena. The Continen
tal Indoor Soccer League (CISL) franchise
also calls the San Jose Arena home. This
version of the world's most popular sport
is quite a contrast to World Cup soccer.
Competing on a field the size of the hockey
rink, players can use the wall when ma
neuvering with the ball. This added un
predictability along with the smaller field
size combine to create a much higher-scor
ing version of soccer, much to the delight
of many American sports fans.
Each team is composed of a goalie and
five field players, with substitutions being
made on-the-fly, as in hockey. Another no
ticeable change in the game is the doling
out of blue-cards by the referees upon fla
grant fouls. The recipient of a blue-card is
banished to the penalty box and a power
play ensues.
Last Saturday, however, the Grizzlies
and the Pittsburgh Stingers slowed down
the pace throughout the first quarter of
play, with neither team scoring a goal. In
the second quarter, the Arena crowd was
treated to its first penalty shootout — the
CISL's equivalent of a penalty kick. Un
like regulation soccer, the shooter is al
lowed to dribble the ball toward the goal
and shoot. The ball is in play if it rebounds
off of the goalie or the wall, creating an ex
cellent scoring chance for the offense.

After the Stingers converted the penal
ty to take a 1-0 lead, the game took on its
intended breakneck pace. Although the
match was low scoring, the excitement
level picked up as the teams took a com
bined 54 shots on goal. The Grizzlies'
faithful were let down in the end, as the
Stingers put the game away by scoring a
goal with 2:33 remaining in overtime.
Although the Grizzlies couldn't match
the Rhino's victory, the fans were defi
nitely treated to quite a show. Both teams
feature a squad of cheerleaders who
switch from being called the Rhinestones
on Rhino nights to the Bear Necessities
when the Grizzlies take to the field. The
music is loud and rowdy, especially after
the home team puts a point on the board.
The Beatles' "Twist and Shout" is the Rhi
nos' theme music, and the fans got up and
danced all 10 times it signaled a Rhino
goal.
Undoubtedly, the best part of making
the trip to the San Jose Arena to watch
these two fledgling organizations is the
chance to watch professional sports from
the front row. Ticket prices are very rea
sonable, ranging from $8 to $14. But be
cause of the actual attendance — roughly
5,000 for the Rhinos and 2,000 for the
Grizzlies — a cheap ticket gets you in and
the choice of seats is pretty much yours.
The Sharks can't offer that to someone
walking up to the ticket window minutes
before game-time.
The summer fun with the Rhinos and
Grizzlies is worth a look — it's close, con
venient, fast and fun. And the season won't
last long. When the weather gets cold, the
Arena rink will freeze over once again and
turn into Shark-infested waters.
