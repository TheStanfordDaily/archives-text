Shakespeare? Believe it or not, Santa Cruz; of
fers one of tlie most riveting and surreal Shake
speare experiences in the area.

Last year Shakespeare Santa Cruz per
formed for close to 40,000 people, and their
audiences are growing as people become
drawn to the quality productions staged in
the beautiful and relaxed environment of
the UC-Santa Cruz campus.
The non-profit company was founded in
1982 and has managed in its short existence
to receive tremendous critical acclaim, as
well as top professionals from all over the
country, many of whom have worked at the
Shakespeare Festival in Ashland, Oregon.
The Santa Cruz festival's alums have
gone on to work in companies all over the
country, many in New York. The associate
artistic director Mark Rucker was even a
member of the Royal Shakespeare company
in England. And the festival has become
known for presenting plays that are avant
garde and about issues that resonate with
contemporary, international audiences.
The artistic director of the Festival,
Danny Scheie, greets us in his notes with
"Welcome to an event with all the passion,
controversy, and kitsch of the World Cup
.. . here on the edge of the earth in Santa
Cruz, California, America, the World."
"The Merchant of Venice," for instance,
is performed in true Santa Cruz style — its
presentation is hip and non-traditional
while its content is political. Karin Magaldi-
Unger, the Education/Special projects man
ager, tells us that "with this production of
'The Merchant of Venice' we not only want
to entertain people, but we also want to
challenge people to talk about [anti-Semi
tism, feminism, and gay issues] ... [The

ater] can be a forum in which to peaceably,
reasonably and responsibly confront con
troversial issues."
Indeed, the portrayal of the Jew as the
stingy villain is hard for sensitive Santa Cruz
types to accept. However, Shylock's charac
ter is not entirely unsympathetic, and al
though he becomes a scapegoat for the Vene
tians, the same is not true for the audience.
His presence operates to expose other less ob
vious cultural outsiders such as the young
bride, Portia, and a closet-case, Antonio.
Although each at some point obtain the
vehicles of power — money, status, position
— they can never fully use them because of
who they are as determined by the larger so
ciety. Only through becoming the epitome
of power— a tricky male lawyer — does Por
tia realize how powerless she is as a wife.
And she, like the others, discovers just how
far love goes when the stakes are high.
However, this does not mean that the
play is humorless. In fact its comedic quali
ty is what makes it so riveting. The original
comedy of the play is embellished by the
various appearances of a Federal Express
delivery man, trick-or-treaters, a bucket of
Kentucky Fried Chicken and a transvestite
maid. And none of these individuals or im
ages appear merely to obtain gratuitous
laughs — even if that's what they elicit. As
Timothy Scheie points out in "Body Trou
ble," ". .. drag's mere capacity to entertain
plays an integral part in a subversive per
formance."
The non-traditional casting not only
serves to enhance the entertainment quali

ty but allow the audience to witness the in
credible range of acting skills of each mem
ber of the cast. For example, Elizabeth
Atkeson does an impeccable job not only
playing the practical and witty Portia, but
also the servant bum, Lancelot, a la Bart
Simpson.
Similarly, Irwin Appel is doubly appeal
ing in his roles as the hostile Jew, Shylock
and the self-satisfied and naive football play
er, Lorenzo, who also spends half the play
disguised as Batman with his new bride, Jes
sica, disguised as Robin. Even the objects are
played well. The gold chest sings out her or
acle in cheesy operatic style, the silver chest
starts a western hoe down, and the lead
chest becomes one bad rapper as he reveals
the truth of the contents in his chest.
The quality of the production isn't the
only reason to attend this drama however.
Santa Cruz and the Glen at UC-Santa Cruz
offers a perfect setting for "the Merchant of
Venice." While watching the play one can't
help but notice the serene giant redwoods
which surround the stage and audience.
The Glen provides the free feeling of the
outdoors and also a feeling of isolation,
making the entire theater experience a sur
real one. The shadows at the sides of the
open-air theater provide perfect curtains
beyond which the actors cannot be seen. Al
though the setting is rustic, the show does
not lack technically at all. It even comes
complete with a disco ball that hangs from a
high branch, and yields its effects at appro
priate moments (Yes, disco balls can be used
appropriately in Shakespeare).
However, most of the setting revolves
around the back of an ice cream truck,
which becomes a jail, a Halloween party,
and a host for other environments in both
Venice and Belmont. The characters use
every part of it, the inside, the top, and even
the ladder on the side.
However, as wonderful as this environ
ment might be, it requires a little prepara
tion: a beach chair, warm blanket, clothes
and preferably someone to cuddle with, be
cause the temperature drops significantly
as the performance progresses.

Just because you find yourself in a rustic
setting does not mean you are without mod
ern comforts though. At intermission, you
may warm yourself up with a hazelnut latte,
or you can arrive early and order a vegetari
an or regular lunch, dinner or wine and
cheese. You can even make a weekend out of
it and stay a night in Santa Cruz.
The company does not simply stop at pre
senting quality theater, but it involves the
community in the theater through a variety
of educational programs. One can spend a
weekend listening to discussions and semi
nars about the plays, or one can enroll in
summer classes about Shakespeare and act
ing. And if you decide to get really involved,
there is also a scholarship/internship pro
gram to apply for. They even have a branch
company called "The Company of Little
Eyases" — for 8-15 year-olds — that tours
annually and is open to kids of all acting ex
periences.
This year in addition to "The Merchants
of Venice," the company is also performing
the "Merry Wives of Windsor," an atypical
romantic farce set in the middle class and a
play by a contemporary of Shakespeare, the
Spanish monk Tirso de Molina, called "The
Rape of Tamar." A Bible story based on the
rape of King David's daughter Tamar by her
half-brother, Molina also wrote the first
great treatment of Don Juan in one of his
other plays.
So if you are aching to see quality drama
and don't want to go all the way up to Ash
land and are tired of fighting the traffic and
pollution of San Francisco, enjoy the Shake
speare Festival in Santa Cruz. You might
find its just what you've been looking for.

Shakespeare Santa Cruz will present per
formances of "The Merchant of Venice"
through Sept. 3, "Merry Wives of Windsor"
through Sept. 4 and"the Rape of Tamar"
through Sept. 3. Performances are held
Wednesdays, Thursdays, Fridays and
weekends. Season ticket passes for the festi
val are $35-$57, single tickets are $13 to
$21. For additional information call the fes

formed for close to 40,000 people, and their
audiences are growing as people become
drawn to the quality productions staged in
the beautiful and relaxed environment of
the UC-Santa Cruz campus.
The non-profit company was founded in
1982 and has managed in its short existence
to receive tremendous critical acclaim, as
well as top professionals from all over the
country, many of whom have worked at the
Shakespeare Festival in Ashland, Oregon.
The Santa Cruz festival's alums have
gone on to work in companies all over the
country, many in New York. The associate
artistic director Mark Rucker was even a
member of the Royal Shakespeare company
in England. And the festival has become
known for presenting plays that are avant
garde and about issues that resonate with
contemporary, international audiences.
The artistic director of the Festival,
Danny Scheie, greets us in his notes with
"Welcome to an event with all the passion,
controversy, and kitsch of the World Cup
.. . here on the edge of the earth in Santa
Cruz, California, America, the World."
"The Merchant of Venice," for instance,
is performed in true Santa Cruz style — its
presentation is hip and non-traditional
while its content is political. Karin Magaldi-
Unger, the Education/Special projects man
ager, tells us that "with this production of
'The Merchant of Venice' we not only want
to entertain people, but we also want to
challenge people to talk about [anti-Semi
tism, feminism, and gay issues] ... [The

ater] can be a forum in which to peaceably,
reasonably and responsibly confront con
troversial issues."
Indeed, the portrayal of the Jew as the
stingy villain is hard for sensitive Santa Cruz
types to accept. However, Shylock's charac
ter is not entirely unsympathetic, and al
though he becomes a scapegoat for the Vene
tians, the same is not true for the audience.
His presence operates to expose other less ob
vious cultural outsiders such as the young
bride, Portia, and a closet-case, Antonio.
Although each at some point obtain the
vehicles of power — money, status, position
— they can never fully use them because of
who they are as determined by the larger so
ciety. Only through becoming the epitome
of power— a tricky male lawyer — does Por
tia realize how powerless she is as a wife.
And she, like the others, discovers just how
far love goes when the stakes are high.
However, this does not mean that the
play is humorless. In fact its comedic quali
ty is what makes it so riveting. The original
comedy of the play is embellished by the
various appearances of a Federal Express
delivery man, trick-or-treaters, a bucket of
Kentucky Fried Chicken and a transvestite
maid. And none of these individuals or im
ages appear merely to obtain gratuitous
laughs — even if that's what they elicit. As
Timothy Scheie points out in "Body Trou
ble," ". .. drag's mere capacity to entertain
plays an integral part in a subversive per
formance."
The non-traditional casting not only
serves to enhance the entertainment quali

ty but allow the audience to witness the in
credible range of acting skills of each mem
ber of the cast. For example, Elizabeth
Atkeson does an impeccable job not only
playing the practical and witty Portia, but
also the servant bum, Lancelot, a la Bart
Simpson.
Similarly, Irwin Appel is doubly appeal
ing in his roles as the hostile Jew, Shylock
and the self-satisfied and naive football play
er, Lorenzo, who also spends half the play
disguised as Batman with his new bride, Jes
sica, disguised as Robin. Even the objects are
played well. The gold chest sings out her or
acle in cheesy operatic style, the silver chest
starts a western hoe down, and the lead
chest becomes one bad rapper as he reveals
the truth of the contents in his chest.
The quality of the production isn't the
only reason to attend this drama however.
Santa Cruz and the Glen at UC-Santa Cruz
offers a perfect setting for "the Merchant of
Venice." While watching the play one can't
help but notice the serene giant redwoods
which surround the stage and audience.
The Glen provides the free feeling of the
outdoors and also a feeling of isolation,
making the entire theater experience a sur
real one. The shadows at the sides of the
open-air theater provide perfect curtains
beyond which the actors cannot be seen. Al
though the setting is rustic, the show does
not lack technically at all. It even comes
complete with a disco ball that hangs from a
high branch, and yields its effects at appro
priate moments (Yes, disco balls can be used
appropriately in Shakespeare).
However, most of the setting revolves
around the back of an ice cream truck,
which becomes a jail, a Halloween party,
and a host for other environments in both
Venice and Belmont. The characters use
every part of it, the inside, the top, and even
the ladder on the side.
However, as wonderful as this environ
ment might be, it requires a little prepara
tion: a beach chair, warm blanket, clothes
and preferably someone to cuddle with, be
cause the temperature drops significantly
as the performance progresses.

Just because you find yourself in a rustic
setting does not mean you are without mod
ern comforts though. At intermission, you
may warm yourself up with a hazelnut latte,
or you can arrive early and order a vegetari
an or regular lunch, dinner or wine and
cheese. You can even make a weekend out of
it and stay a night in Santa Cruz.
The company does not simply stop at pre
senting quality theater, but it involves the
community in the theater through a variety
of educational programs. One can spend a
weekend listening to discussions and semi
nars about the plays, or one can enroll in
summer classes about Shakespeare and act
ing. And if you decide to get really involved,
there is also a scholarship/internship pro
gram to apply for. They even have a branch
company called "The Company of Little
Eyases" — for 8-15 year-olds — that tours
annually and is open to kids of all acting ex
periences.
This year in addition to "The Merchants
of Venice," the company is also performing
the "Merry Wives of Windsor," an atypical
romantic farce set in the middle class and a
play by a contemporary of Shakespeare, the
Spanish monk Tirso de Molina, called "The
Rape of Tamar." A Bible story based on the
rape of King David's daughter Tamar by her
half-brother, Molina also wrote the first
great treatment of Don Juan in one of his
other plays.
So if you are aching to see quality drama
and don't want to go all the way up to Ash
land and are tired of fighting the traffic and
pollution of San Francisco, enjoy the Shake
speare Festival in Santa Cruz. You might
find its just what you've been looking for.

Shakespeare Santa Cruz will present per
formances of "The Merchant of Venice"
through Sept. 3, "Merry Wives of Windsor"
through Sept. 4 and"the Rape of Tamar"
through Sept. 3. Performances are held
Wednesdays, Thursdays, Fridays and
weekends. Season ticket passes for the festi
val are $35-$57, single tickets are $13 to
