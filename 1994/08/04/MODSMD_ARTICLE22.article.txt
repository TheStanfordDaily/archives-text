## Clear and Present Danger 
### 
Harrison Ford's newest movie' "Clear
and Present Danger," wants it all.
Drama. Suspense. Political commen
tary. Action. Comedy .All tucked neatly into
a tight, two-hour, three act format.
Someone should have told screenwriters
Donald Stewart ("Missing," "Patriot
Games"), Steven Zaillian ("Schindler's
List") and John Milius ("Apocalypse Now")
the chances of success fall a few percentage
points below nailing jello to a tree.
Based on the best-selling Tom Clancy
novel of the same name, "Clear and Present
Danger" recounts another adventure with
our favorite CIA agent Jack Ryan (Ford).
Our hero is searching for an American
businessman's killer. Ryan's quest eventu
ally brings him to the South American jun
gles, territory of a coterie of infamous
druglords.
Shortly after his unwelcome arrival on
foreign soil, Ryan realizes that the tenta
cles of evil spring not only from Colombian
villas, but from the Oval Office as well. Si
multaneously, he must battle the Third
World country and America's highest office
to restore some semblance of justice in both
places.
So where is the room for character de
velopment? Obviously, the onus of evoking
audience sympathy resides with a handful
of highly talented actors.
As the wise black friend who convenient
ly dies so the white hero can single-handed
ly save the day, for instance, renown veter
an actor James Earl Jones fleshed out his
character with gestures, intonation and a
host of facial expressions.
Jones cleverly convinces the audience
that Greer is an emotionally resilient man
with a calm, pragmatic outlook on life. His
character is so human, he could be someone
with whom we work and respect.
Yet no amount of masterful acting can
save a sinking script. The weak sceenplay
bludgeons the suspense by introducing the
audience to the killers and the political cor
ruption early in the first act. Blatant politi
cal commentary guarantees only the most
dimwitted will walk away feeling they
missed the message.
And cheesy camera effects only worsen
the ailments. After his righthand man, vil
lain Felix Cortez (Joaquim de Alameda), in
forms him he's created a national crisis, Es
cobedo turns to face Cortez in slo mo as a
missed ball travels past him in the batting
cage.
Even worse, when American mercenar
ies airlift Ryan — who dangles precariously
from one of the helicopter's landing legs —
out of heavy fire, one can tell that the stunt
was performed in the studio, fake back
ground and all.
Yet "Clear and Present Danger" does
abound in shining comedic moments. In
deed, there are enough killer one-liners in
the flick to fill an HBO special. One liners,
however, do not a movie make. And — dare
I say it — neither does an outstanding star,
even if it is Ford.
Though seven bucks would be a waste,
"Clear and Present Danger" makes a great
matinee.
