Jim Carrey is a human cartoon character.
Every movie reviewer's probably said this,
but that seems to be the only way to describe
him.
And thanks to Industrial Light and
Magic's computer graphics team, Carrey
looks like the cartoon character "The
Mask," the new special effects comedy-fan
tasy based on the ultra-violent and funny
Dark Horse Comics series. And like a good
Saturday morning cartoon, "The Mask" is

unabashedly silly, joyfully dumb, mind
numbingly excessive, ultimately sappy, and
altogether fun ... with a cheesy message for
the kids about how it's better to be yourself
or some crap like that.
Carrey plays Stanley Ipkiss, a bank teller
who's unaware that he's being abused by
everyone around him; he's the ultimate nice
guy who doesn't think of a comeback until
it's five seconds too late. He's a pitiful
chump .. . until he discovers an ancient
Viking mask floating in the polluted rivers of
industrial Edge City.
When donned, the mask takes over the
wearer's face and mind, turning him into an
invincible, green-faced, unrepressed super
hero who's everything he's ever dreamed of
being. In Ipkiss' case, it turns him from a
shy, hopeless romantic into a wisecracking
love machine.
But, of course, there has to be a villain.
Here, he's a mob boss wannabe named Dori
an (Peter Greene), and Edge City is in for a
living hell when he gets hold of the mask.
Thanks to some cheerfully excessive make
up by Greg Cannom, who did the latex magic
in "Bram Stoker's Dracula" and "Mrs.
Doubtfire," Carrey and Greene are turned
into putty-faced comic book characters who
gleefully chew the scenery.
And there is a lot of stuff to chew on.
From the strangely-lit Landfill Park to the
stylish Coco Bongo Club, Edge City is a goofy
generic metropolis that, for once, doesn't
look anything like Gotham City. The direc
tion by schlock horror director Chuck Rus
sell ("The Blob," "Nightmare on Elm Street,
Part 3") is a curious blend of old-fashioned
horror and over-the-top comedy styles. The
result is a chaotic jumble of shots that are
never boring to look at.
I'm not a big fan of Carrey's "dumber is
better" comedic style, but it's hard not to be
won over by the antics of his alter ego. Hey,
this is what the word "cartoonish" means,
and for once, it's a complement. Amazingly
enough, though, he doesn't plow through
the supporting characters.
There are even two actors that succeed in

upstaging Carrey in the movie. The first is
Cameron Diaz, a 21-year-old model making
a eye-popping (literally, in Ipkiss' case)
debut as Tina, the luscious lounge singer
who's got a couple of tricks up her sleeve.
The second is Max, who plays Ipkiss' hyper
canine sidekick Milo. This is, quite simply,
one of the most incredible animal perfor
mances ever put to screen.
The Mask is by no means a perfect come
dy. Some jokes go on too long and many are
just plain stupid, but if you go in expecting
nothing less than to be dazzled by the effects
and to have a silly good time, you'll be richly
rewarded.
