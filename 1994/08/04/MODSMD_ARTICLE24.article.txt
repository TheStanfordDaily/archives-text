# North

### 
"Toys," "Howard the Duck," "Bonfire of
the Vanities"... to this list of movies distin
guished only by their inept blend of comedy
and drama add Rob Reiner's newest flick
"North."
That's right, Rob Reiner of "A Few Good
Men" has finally added that one element
missing from his otherwise impressive vita —
a turkey.
But what could he expect? In casting this
fiasco, Reiner chose three actors whose ca
reers have recently gone the way of the Dodo:
Bruce Willis, Dan Aykroyd and, of all people,
John Ritter.
The blame, though, can't be placed on
their shoulders. Alan Zweibel (of "Saturday
Night Live" fame) and Andrew Scheinman
create a script too dull to be funny, too slow to
be a drama and too raunchy to be a children's
tale. The result is an amorphous mass that
has no genre, no direction and, ultimately, no
joy.
The story line is simple enough. A convinc
ing Elijah Wood is North, the boy who all par
ents wish their kid could be like. A combina
tion of Einstein in the class, Roger Clemens
on the diamond and Laurence Olivier on the

stage, North is worshipped by everyone he
knows; except his parents.
Feeling unloved, North heads to his "spe
cial place" (a recliner in a department store)
where he meets a charming Willis in a rabbit
suit. This bearded bunny gives North an idea
— to turn free-agent. North puts himself on
the worldwide child market with the help of
Lawyer Jon Lovitz.
Here "North" makes the drop from "lame
but cute" to "miserable." In venues from
Zaire to Alaska, Reiner goes wild with the car
icatures.First there are the Texans (Aykroyd
and Reba McEntire) who want to force-feed
North, making him the biggest child in the
world. And the skits get quicker as North
spends time in Africa, China and with the
Cleavers, constantly accompanied by Willis,
his guardian angel. Surprisingly enough,
North learns that his parents do love and ap
preciate him, and lives happily ever after.
There's no place like home!
The only glimmers of humor in this mass
of misery are the various film parodies Reiner
tinkers with. From "Witness" to "The Last
Emperor," Reiner draws a smile with a light
touch, only to intersperse these moments
with blunt genitalia jokes that have parents
covering their childre's ears.
It's fitting that Willis, one of the films only
bright spots, makes his first entrance dressed
as the Easter Bunny. Because with "North,"
Reiner has laid one heck of an egg.
