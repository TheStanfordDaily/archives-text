The University should
continue tradition of
Grey Interpretation

Should Stanford, a univer
sity that champions intel
lectual discourse and the
advocacy of personal opinion
also sanction speech designed to
spread intolerance or speech
that disturbs the peace?
Until recently, Stanford,
with it's private-university sta
tus, was exempt from the feder
al laws that apply to public in
stitutions. But with the passing
of the Leonard Law, a Califor
nia Education Code passed in
1992, students at private uni
versities were granted the same
rights to freedom of speech on
campus as they would have off
campus.
It appears, however, that the
Leonard Law violates the Uni
versity's First Amendment
right to freedom from state reg
ulation of its speech.
Therefore, as it should,
Stanford continues to employ
the Grey Interpretation enact
ed in 1990 as an adjunct to it's
Fundamental Standard pro
scribing all fighting words,
"gutter epithets and symbols
of bigotry" that are under
stood to convey direct and vis
ceral hatred or contempt
aimed at an individual or small
group based on sex, race, color,
handicap, religion, nationali
ty, ethnicity, or sexual orienta
tion or preference. This is the
total and complete extent of
the "speech code."
The Interpretation is clear
and precise; it exists to achieve
the valuable and simple end of
prohibiting invidious discrimi
nation and harassment on the
Stanford campus. Never does it
infringe upon the freedom of ex
pression of ideas.
However, nine Stanford stu
dents filed a lawsuit May 2
against the University contend
ing that the Grey Interpreta
tion deprives all Stanford stu
dents of the opportunity to en
gage in educational and mean
ingful discourse. And while the
lawsuit will not come to trial for
several months, a hearing for an
injunction to prohibit a speech

code on campus until a legal de
cision is made is underway.
Santa Clara County Superi
or Court Judge Peter G. Stone
has had ample time to deliber
ate on both party's arguments
at the June 30 hearing. It will be
his decision as to the extent of
the totality of the First Amend
ment. The constitutionality of
the Grey Interpretation of the
Fundamental Standard will set
a precedent for other private
universities in California. Most
likely, Stone's forthcoming rul
ing will be the trial court's final
decision on the legitimacy of the
Interpretation.
Stanford is an institution
committed to freedom of ex
pression of ideas in all its won
derful variety. But in a commu
nity of scholars, with emphasis
on community, "hate speech"
serves only as a vehicle of de
struction undermining the
basic principles of respect,
morality, personal honor and
the rights of others. A certain
degree of control must be exert
ed to quell disorder and perpet
uate respect for the potpourri
that is humanity.
University policy reflects the
responsibility of present day ed
ucators to inculcate civic duties
and values in their pupils.
Speech is an instrument of soci
ety to explain, persuade and en
lighten. Speech should not be a
weapon to vilify, denigrate or
threaten.
With the liberty to express
personal opinions and voice
concern, comes the responsibil
ity of being a good citizen. Is
freedom of speech utterly im
pregnable anywhere in society?
Stanford's speech code allows
the expression of ideas however
racist, sexist, homophobic or
blasphemous in content, but
"gutter epithets" such as "nig
ger," "faggot" and "kike" are in
tolerable and have no place on
this campus. A line is drawn
when personal vilification is
crossed.
As a university supporting
freedom of expression, Stanford
subscribes to Voltaire's piety
but with a clause: "I disagree
with everything you say but will
defend to the death your right
to say it [so long as you do not
use gutter epithets and symbols
of bigotry]."
