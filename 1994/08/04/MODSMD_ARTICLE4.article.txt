# Return of the fly in the buttermilk
## Blunted on Gump 
### 
{ £ T IKE HISTORY writ with
lightning," is Woodrow
J—i Wilson's famous quota
tion in reference to D.W. Griffith's
seminal fdm "Birth of a Nation."
Griffith may have been a provoca
tive racist, but he at least took
American history seriously enough
to evince a political stance regard
less of its willful inaccuracy.
Modern-day filmmakers like
Spike Lee, Stanley Kubrick and
Oliver Stone have followed in that
tradition to much better effect. But
none of them have raked in the kind
of cash amassed by Robert Zemeck
is' ostensibly apolitcal "Forrest
Gump."
I saw the film on its opening
weekend at a nearly sold-out mati
nee, and was only half-surprised to
see a predominantly Boomer audi
ence applaud heartily as their tu
multuous "experiences" were
repackaged as nostalgic entertain
ment. George Wallace, Vietnam,
the Black Panthers, Watergate, ac
cording to the film are just accidents
of history, and as long as individuals
stay good and true, everything will
work out fine. Avoid the political,
just go for the personal, and watch
the big bucks flow in.
Zemeckis shows little humility be
fore his subject, which is recent Amer
ican history. The audience chuckles
as Forrest tells about his Klansman
grandfather; I think about how
"Birth of a Nation" incited the lynch
ing of black men almost everywehere
it was shown. The audience smiles at

the sight of Forrest in the same frame
as George Wallace; I see proud civil
rights activists under siege by dogs,
nightsticks and fire hoses.
The audience laughs as Forrest
assembles his gun in record time in
military training; I recall Kubrick's
searing portrayal of the degradation
of new recruits in "Full Metal Jack
et." "Forrest Gump" pales in com
parison to the real events, but the
audience is only too happy to accept
it as a mediocre substitute...
Throughout the film, the direc
tor blithely jumps through anti-war
protests and black militant move
ments with little regard to what
spawned them. In fact, all political
views — left, right, top or bottom
— are equated with idiocy. "Stupid
is as stupid does," Forrest says re
peatedly, and in this film, holding
any sort of belief or fighting for any
cause other than true love is consid
ered stupid. But the audience
doesn't seem to mind. Instead, it
sits there, stoned on nostalgia, with
only a hint of the bad trip that peri
od was for many Americans.
Admittedly, we get the limbless
vet, the abused hippie-chick and
the dead buddy. But the center of
the film is Forrest — a metaphor
for ordinary America — who keeps
on ticking like the Energizer
Bunny. Are we really supposed to
believe that everything is all right
when all the signs point to apoca
lypse now? Or should we just let it
be, so that 50 years from now we
can make another Forrest Gump

out of global misery?
The same critics that denounce
Lee's politics or Oliver Stone's liber
ties with history applaud "Forrest
Gump" without realizing that
Gump's approach is far more insidi
ous. At least Lee's and Stone's polit
ical agendas are made plain from the
start, readily available for all to cri
tique. "Gump" plays into our inabil
ity to learn nothing from the past
but how to repackage it for profit —
get the right cast, the right cos
tumes, an all-star soundtrack and
some snippets of archival footage.
The rest is box-ofTice history.
Even though reality lurks out
side the theater for "Gump's"
blissed-out audiences, no matter
how much they wish otherwise,
they probably believe they've found
the solution to all our ills therein.
In that spirit, it you've seen the
film, it's now time to do your part
for America. Pick up a homeless
family. Grab a couple AIDS victims.
Accost a few "at-risk" children. As
semble a platoon of soldiers suffer
ing from Gulf War Syndrome. And
take them to see "Forrest Gump"
today. They'll thank you for it.
