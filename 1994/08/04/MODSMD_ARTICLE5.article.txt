## Elimination of SPS may hurt Stanford image 
### 
This letter is a reaction to The
Stanford Weekly's 7/21/94
article "Stanford's Graphic
Center to be eliminated."
I am shocked at the naivete in
herent in the University decision
to close Stanford Publication Ser
vices. This decision has short and
long term implications:
By eliminating centralized ser
vices and allowing and encourag
ing individual departments to
"have the freedom to use the free
market to their advantage" may be
a serious conceptual and fiscal
error.
As marketing consultant to
many colleges and universities, I
find that leaders who have allowed
this to happen at their schools are
often later very sorry about their
error. Often this decision results
in a msgor loss of continuity of
communications, inconsistent use
of logos and imagery, poor editori
al quality, poor graphic quality,

conflicting "marketing" strategies,
and serious marketing breakdown
which has a negative marketing
impact on the institution and its
components.
Logos proliferate as individual
departments struggle to market
themselves, often at the expense of
the parent institution and in com
petition with each other. Everyone
pays the price as institutional mar
keting efforts are fragmented and
disparate.
Further, this decentralization is
not a cost savings as individual de
partments hire people and buy
equipment to build their own in
ternal communications depart
ments.
Right now, at Stanford there
are over 20 such operations. Of
course, there is little or no coordi
nated effort for consistent mes
sages and images for the many
constituents they address.
The problem of buying printing

by uncentralized, unsophisticated
staff is an issue unto itself at Stan
ford.
Stanford annually buys many
millions of dollars of printing. If
this is done by people with little
knowledge of the complex printing
business, fiscal impact can be sig
nificant. SPS employed profession
al print buyers who knew area
print vendors; their capabilities
and limitations. The loss of collec
tive buying, as SPS provided for
collective annual envelopes, for ex
ample, can have serious fiscal im
pact on many departments, espe
cially the smaller ones that are fis
cally strapped.
Why is Stanford's image impor
tant? The idea of value has become
a marketing concern for
many quality institutions of high
er education. This idea is impor
tant to you.. .whether you are an
administrator, faculty person,
alum, student or staff member.

Image is important because it sup
ports tuition (for admission), do
nations (for contributors), grants
(for faculty research), jobs (for stu
dents), and commitment (for
alumni).
To allow computer desktop ama
teurs to interpret Stanford, produc
ing what we professionals call "ran
som notes," chipping away at the
quality image that has been the
touchstone for publications and
communications developed by Stan
ford Publication Services over the
decades is, in my opinion, sinful.
I find examples of institutions
and leaders who have lived to re
gret their past decisions to throw
centralized professional communi
cations and public relations ser
vices to the winds. The "winds"
blow back to them and they are
most often foul!
