## Richard Shavelson to assume Smith's position on January 1 
### Arnold Ceballos Staff writer 
Almost a year-and-a-half
after Marshall Smith stepped
down as dean of the School of
Education for a job in the Clin
ton administration, Stanford
has selected Richard J. Shavel
son as his replacement.
A Stanford graduate and cur
rently a professor in the School
of Education at the University of
California-Santa Barbara,
Shavelson will take over as dean
of Stanford's School of Educa
tion on Jan. 1.
Shavelson replaces Smith,
who'left the post in March 1993
to become President Clinton's
undersecretary of education.
The acting dean since then has
been Prof. Nel Noddings, whose
term ends in August. Noddings
will be replaced in the interim by
Assoc. Dean Myra Strober until

Shavelson assumes the perma
nent position in January.
According to Education Prof.
Michael Kirst, a member of the
search committee, the new dean
is a "major addition to the facul
ty in terms of his research and
visibility internationally."
Kirst said that Shavelson is a

well-known fig
ure in the edu
cational assess
ment of pupils
and a leader in
educational psy
chology.
Shavelson is
also the former
president of the
American Edu-

cational Research Association, a
prestigious 15,000-member or
ganization of educational re
searchers.
Kirst added that Shavelson's
diverse research interests will

also prove useful to Stanford.
"His educational background
and areas of research are so
broad that he will be able to link
the School of Education with the
rest of the University, including
departments such as social sci
ences and even engineering,"
said Kirst.
In addition to the research
strengths cited by Kirst, Shavel
son is an experienced adminis
trator who served as dean of the
Graduate School of Education at
UC-Santa Barbara from 1987 to
1993.
One of the new dean's major
roles will be to recruit good ju
nior faculty for the department,
according to Kirst. He added
that Shavelson "had a good track
record" in this regard at UC-
Santa Barbara.
Shavelson, who received his


Shavelson
doctorate in educational psy
chology from Stanford in 1971,
recently received the Humboldt
Award, presented by the Ger
man government to a top inter
national scholar in order to con
duct research in Germany.
As a result, Shavelson will
spend this fall working at the
University of Gottingen before
coming to Stanford next Janu
ary.
