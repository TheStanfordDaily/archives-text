# Cable TV changes to occur
## SUNet facilities upgraded

With work underway for up

is, all on-campus student rooms
will have access to the new service
by 1995.
Thomson cited that surveys
given around campus regarding
STV "showed a fair amount of in

of the students asked."
Presently, the current SUNet
video connections are only wired
to 20 percent of student rooms â€”
mostly new ones built in the mid
1980s. But, Thomson said, since
some old student residences were
already in the process of being
rewired, the opportunity and
ideas to expand cable access
through STV were available.
"While work was already in
