# Cable TV changes to occur
## SUNet facilities upgraded 
### Kane Lee 
With work underway for up
grading Stanford's SUNet video
facilities, substantial changes lie
ahead for on-campus television
cable services.
From now until Halloween,
Network and Communication
Services are working to increase
the capacity of the current SUNet
(Stanford University Network)
video system, which will allow
Student Affairs and Libraries and
Information Resources to provide
more educational and entertain
ment channels through the cable
television accessible in student
rooms.
The upgraded service will
begin this fall as a pilot project
called STV, Stanford Television,
in Florence Moore Hall, McFar
land, Escondido Village 88 and Es
condido Village 116.
But for the other residences
currently plugged into SUNet, the
changes in the current system will
also mean the loss of two chan
nels.
As of August 15, CNN and C
SPAN will only remain in the
video cable serving academic

buildings, not in free SUNet resi
dential cable. The two channels
will appear in the new STV lineup.
Residential service will only in
clude programs the University
can transmit without monthly
costs.
"Hopefully, the pilot will be
successful," said Jan Thomson,
Stanford Director of Communica
tion Services. She added that if it
is, all on-campus student rooms
will have access to the new service
by 1995.
Thomson cited that surveys
given around campus regarding
STV "showed a fair amount of in
terest from more than 60 percent
of the students asked."
Presently, the current SUNet
video connections are only wired
to 20 percent of student rooms â€”
mostly new ones built in the mid
1980s. But, Thomson said, since
some old student residences were
already in the process of being
rewired, the opportunity and
ideas to expand cable access
through STV were available.
"While work was already in
progress in rewiring the old resi
dences, the vice-provost of Student
Affairs asked what more it would
take to add the SUNet video up
grade. And it turned out to be just a
fairly small addition," said Thom
son.
As the work continues and the

new equipment is tested, intermit
tent outages and channel realign
ments can be expected on all the
SUNet channels for the next 3
months.
In the meantime, academic and
residential services can tune to
SUNet channel 23 for news regard
ing up-to-date programming, and
more information is available at the
Stanford Television hotline, 497-
7788.
