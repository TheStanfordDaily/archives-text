A Stanford student pleaded in
nocent to charges of unlawfully
setting fires and tampering with
fire alarm equipment last week
after spending three nights in jail,
according to the Stanford Police.
Police arrested 21-year-old
Robert Benjamin, a resident in
Mirrielees, after receiving a call
about a man acting suspiciously in
the children's playground of Es
condido Village on July 19.
Benjamin was allegedly seen
sweating profusely with a blank
stare on his face as he was rocking
on a children's play horse, mum
bling about the "angel of Christ"
and "Lucifer" to passers-by. Ben
jamin then lit his own sweater on
fire in a trash receptacle, police said.
Benjamin told police that he
burned the sweater because it re
minded him of someone he knew.
Stanford Police had been noti
fied by a Mirrielees resident assis
tant the night of July 18 that Ben
jamin had admitted to starting a

fire in the trash dumpster by
throwing cigarette butts down the
trash chute.
Police found a burnt pot, rug
and can of paint in his Mirrielees
apartment, as well as several
lighters. The fire alarm had also
been disarmed.
"Arsonists are very scary peo
ple. I am glad we were able to catch
him before he was able to hurt any
one," said Stanford Police Capt.
Raoul Niemeyer.
Benjamin was released from jail
on July 23 after posting bail. He is
currently under court-appointed
supervision until a closed pre-trail
hearing, set for August 19.
According to Tina Verville, resi
dence office coordinator at Wilbur
Hall, Benjamin "can't come back
on campus to get his belongings."
The Office of the Dean of Students
said they had no information at
this time to confirm or deny Ben
jamin's status.
While Benjamin is not taking
summer classes, he has registered
for fall quarter, according to the
Bursar's Office.
