# Phone users overbilled
## Faulty July charge repeats June 18 calls 
### Kane Lee 
Many Stanford phone users
may have noticed a little surprise
in their monthly bill for July.
Instead of being charged for the
calls made during the normal billing
period of one month, all Stanford
residencies and buildings were
charged for calls made in one nor
mal month plus one additional day.
The billing period for the
month of June ended on the 18th,
so a new billing period was sup
posed to have begun for July on
June 19. However, the tape con
taining the June 18 calls was mis
takenly recharged on the July in
voice, according to Bill Clebsch, as
sociate director for Business and
Finance at Stanford Network and
Communications Systems.
"Luckily," Clebsch said, "the
glitch was made on a weekend in
which many undergraduates had
already left and few buildings were
making important University
calls."
Clebsch added that everyone on
campus should expect to see credit
on their next bill to make up for
any wrongful charges they re
ceived on the faulty July phone bill.
According to Anne Crowley,

manager of Client Services at Net
work and Communications Sys
tems, a record of all the calls made
at Stanford campus are recorded
daily on tapes. Then, when each
billing cycle is ended, all the tapes
for the month are loaded into the
Communication System's comput
er mainframe and put into invoices.
In the past, human error has
made it possible for a tape to be
rerun on two different billing peri
ods. The last time this error was
made — almost three years ago —
clearer labels were made for the
tapes. But, said Crowley, "From
the glitch made this summer, we
can see that better tape labeling is
not enough to prevent mistakes."
Personnel within Communica
tion Systems are looking into addi
tional measures to prevent billing
mistakes from happening again in
the future.
"We are planning on having
some protocols built into the
mainframe of the computer's
billing system to immediately alert
us if a wrong tape is put in," Crow
ley said.
Clebsch optimistically added
that, "With the new system, a
faulty phone bill will never happen
again."
