# Researchers study use of computers in helping social phobics

Stanford Department of Psychiatry and
Veterans Affairs researchers are trying to
find out whether hand-held computers can
help therapists treat people with social pho
bias.
Giving a presentation, going out on a
date, making small talk at a party or speak
ing out in a meeting strike fear into social
phobics — about eight percent of adults —
according to Karin Gruber, a research asso
ciate at the VA Hospital and Stanford doc
toral student.
The new study into social phobia uses tra
ditional cognitive behavior-oriented therapy
to help change self-defeating thoughts and
beliefs. The 18 participants take part in
group therapy, but some substitute the com
puter for pail of the therapy sessions.

"Philosophically we see the computers as
assisting therapy, not replacing therapy,"
Stanford Psychiatry Prof. Barr Taylor said.
It is necessary to search for cost-efficient
therapy to fit into managed health care, he
added.
The computers supplement therapy by
reinforcing skills introduced in the group
sessions.
"What's really neat about these comput
ers is that they keep track," Taylor said.
Thus, they force people to work harder on
getting better and make it more likely that
certain tasks are performed.
Social phobics think a little flub is a cata
strophe, but they have to experience their
fear in order to overcome it, Gruber said. In
the study, six of the participants took the
small computers home to help get through
situations that would ordinarily terrify
them.

The computer beeps three or four times a
day with reminders on goals, thoughts,
breathing and relaxation. If the person feels
anxious, he or she may access the computer
for an instant pep talk to help get through a
frightening situation. "Is it really the worst
thing in the world?" the computer prompts,
to put the situation into perspective.
"The computer has a valuable potential,"
Gruber said. "So far we don't know how use
ful it is ... but the preliminary data seems
promising," she added.
The study is one of a series looking at the
use of hand-held computers as an adjunct to
therapy, Taylor said. Therapies that have
been manualized can be put into computer
format. Studies have already been done on
weight loss, exercise and panic disorder with
favorable results, according to Taylor. Later
studies are planned on generalized anxiety
disorder, eating disorders and depression.

In the social phobia study, 18 participants
are divided into three groups. Six have tradi
tional cognitive behavior oriented group
therapy weekly for three months. Six have
the same type of group therapy, but only
eight sessions during the three months.
These subjects use a hand-held Casio com
puter as an adjunct. The other six people are
assigned to a waiting list and will have tradi
tional therapy at the end of the three
months. All subjects are assessed at the be
ginning and end of the study with a follow
up six months later.
The first groups have completed their ini
tial therapy and will be followed up in Octo
ber. Other groups are targeted to begin in
October and next spring or summer. A con
trol group of 30 people who enjoy speaking
out in public and being the center of atten
tion will be assessed in January to establish
test norms.
