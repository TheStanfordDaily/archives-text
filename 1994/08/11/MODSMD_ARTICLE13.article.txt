As a general rule, national
ly known figures are not
easily accessible to the
general public. However, for stu
dents in a university such as Stan
ford — where national figures are
omnipresent — exceptions do
exist.
For example, while Cecilia and
Jose Antonio Burciaga are known
across the country for their work
on improving the status of people
of color, they have always re
mained in close contact with stu
dents and colleagues alike. Hav
ing served as resident fellows at
Casa Zapata — the Chicano and
Mexican-American theme house
— for the past nine years, the Bur
ciagas are known by the students
as "always being there," accord
ing to recent graduate Julia Gon
zalez Luna.
"[Cecilia Burciaga] is your
friend, your mother," Gonzalez
Luna added. "There's something
more in there [that] I haven't ex
perienced in any other dorm."
Cecilia first came to Stanford
in 1974 as assistant to the presi
dent and advisor to the provost on
Chicano affairs. In the past 20
years, she has filled eight differ
ent positions and has seen three
different presidents lead the ad
ministration. Currently an associ
ate dean in the Office for Student
Affairs, Cecilia is the highest
ranking Chicana administrator at
Stanford.
"I always saw my role as some
one who very much wanted Stan
ford to live up to its potential and
to be a leader in diversity issues,"
she said.
Like his wife, Tony Burciaga
has also worked to bring attention
to issues of race and class
throughout his tenure at Stan
ford, which began when he and
Cecilia became Casa Zapata's RFs
in 1985. To this end, he has
taught courses on muralism —
the painting of murals — and has
written for the San Jose Mercury
News.
However, the last several
months have brought many
changes to the Burciagas. In
March, Cecilia Burciaga was noti
fied that due to budget cuts, her
position would be terminated at
the end of the summer. Although
they offered to stay in Zapata an
extra year, the Burciagas were
told that they needed to move out
of the residence by Aug. 31.
The move to cut Burciaga's po
sition touched off controversy, de
bate and doubt about the adminis
tration's commitment to diversity
issues. Shortly after Burciaga's
layoff, students engaged Univer
sity President Gerhard Casper in
a "debate" in the Quad on the sub
ject, and a month later, nearly 50
people took part in a hunger strike
calling for more attention to Chi
cano/Latino affairs.

summer, it just became a reality. I

an e-mail message to her staff ask

don't know, and the provost and
Mary saying this was my idea, that
is a true travesty," she said.
President Casper has stressed
since the layoff that the action was
purely a budget-cutting measure.
Burciaga said that she thought
she was being a "team player" by
suggesting her own elimination.
She added that the message which
seems to have gone out to staff is,
"Don't make any suggestions."
Despite repeated administra
tion vows to the contrary, Burcia
ga believes that there were clearly
political reasons for her depar
ture. "There's no one really in the
University who believes it was

off, Burciaga said she told her sup
porters not to fight to keep her
family on campus. She told them
that she "saw the climate chang
ing" and thought she was not
going to be very happy or produc
tive if she stayed. "That's when
the community decided to have
their own goals," she said.

"We knew the University
wasn't going to budge. Their repu
tation was on the line. We just
wanted them to recognize [Burcia
ga's] worth and apologize."

aga's position.
Burciaga also said that the mes
sage included a statement about
how she had been with the Univer
sity for 20 years, and would want
to negotiate the idea because she
was not anxious to leave.
"That was October. Mary Ed
monds never once discussed any
of those ideas with me until the
three-minute meeting on March
22," she said. It was at that March
meeting that Burciaga was noti
fied of her layoff.
"I will always wonder why there
was no warning, no discussion ...
but yes, I did suggest that. But

budget cuts. I think it became
pretty clear that I was not going to
be someone who was just going to
be quiet. .. that I knew we made a
lot of progress and that I was
going to keep talking," she said.
Since the announcement of her
elimination, Burciaga has re
ceived "very easily" more than
500 electronic messages, letters
and cards. Although she said that
she feels "very rejected and
wronged" by the administration,
she leaves feeling personally
"overwhelmed by the sense of
support and love" from the stu
dents, faculty and staff.
After meeting with Provost

Qn Wednesday morning,
May 4, nearly 50 Chi
cano and Latino stu
esters filled the Quad
and announced four demands —
among which were more support
for Chicano studies and a high
level position offer for Cecilia Bur
ciaga. The students pledged to
fast for 24 hours, and several of
them vowed not to eat anything
until all their demands were met.
On the following day, more than
250 students rallied in support of
the hunger strikers. The strike
lasted three days and made head
lines across the Bay Area.

"[Burciaga's layoff] was a total,
complete shock. If [the signs ] were

Although committees have
now been set up to look into three
of the demands, the strike result
ed in no new position for Burcia
ga. The strike was entirely stu
dent-run, and Burciaga did not
know about it until the midnight
before it began. That night, three
students came to her and asked
how she thought the administra
tion would react.
"The students were smart
enough to know that this was the
first protest that this administra
tion was going to go through,"
Burciaga said. She credited the
student negotiators as being "stel
lar" and also said that she was
grateful the strike did not last
long.
were so moved, so taken,"
Tony said. "When you see them
doing it, know them, know the
reasons and are involved with it, it
was really very touching."
Watching the strike unfold was
difficult for Cecilia, who described
how painful it was to see the stu
dents on a day-to-day basis. "They
looked different at noon, and they
looked different at dinner," she
said. "You could see the hunger
beginning to take effect. They
started sleeping a lot, they got
very pale."
Burciaga admitted that she
personally wished the students
had not taken that tactic but be
lieved that "as students, they had
to determine their own strategy."
"[Zapata] has been an interesting,
developing cultural resource for
the University. ... It's amazing to
watch it grow."

ta's reputation in the nine
years that the Burciagas have
been resident fellows. "In our Za
pata family, people might not
agree, but nonetheless they re
spect and support each other,"
Tony said. "And that's what we
wanted ... a supportive home
like atmosphere where you can
get home, kick off your shoes and
not have to prove anything to any
body."
Before the Burciagas began
serving as RFs, Tony said that Za
pata was a "very nationalistic,
very political dorm."
"We wanted to turn it around,"
he said. "We felt the politics will
always be there, but we wanted to
make it a home first of all. . . not
a place where you had to prove
how Chicano or how progressive
you are."
Tony credited the communal
and social gatherings as being
among the most effective and
most important activities in the
dorm. Such activities, he said,
allow people to get to know to each
other, especially during the begin
