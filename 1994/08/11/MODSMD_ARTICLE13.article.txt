As a general rule, national
ly known figures are not
easily accessible to the
general public. However, for stu
dents in a university such as Stan
ford — where national figures are
omnipresent — exceptions do
exist.
For example, while Cecilia and
Jose Antonio Burciaga are known
across the country for their work
on improving the status of people
of color, they have always re
mained in close contact with stu
dents and colleagues alike. Hav
ing served as resident fellows at
Casa Zapata — the Chicano and
Mexican-American theme house
— for the past nine years, the Bur
ciagas are known by the students
as "always being there," accord
ing to recent graduate Julia Gon
zalez Luna.
"[Cecilia Burciaga] is your
friend, your mother," Gonzalez
Luna added. "There's something
more in there [that] I haven't ex
perienced in any other dorm."
Cecilia first came to Stanford
in 1974 as assistant to the presi
dent and advisor to the provost on
Chicano affairs. In the past 20
years, she has filled eight differ
ent positions and has seen three
different presidents lead the ad
ministration. Currently an associ
ate dean in the Office for Student
Affairs, Cecilia is the highest
ranking Chicana administrator at
Stanford.
"I always saw my role as some
one who very much wanted Stan
ford to live up to its potential and
to be a leader in diversity issues,"
she said.
Like his wife, Tony Burciaga
has also worked to bring attention
to issues of race and class
throughout his tenure at Stan
ford, which began when he and
Cecilia became Casa Zapata's RFs
in 1985. To this end, he has
taught courses on muralism —
the painting of murals — and has
written for the San Jose Mercury
News.
However, the last several
months have brought many
changes to the Burciagas. In
March, Cecilia Burciaga was noti
fied that due to budget cuts, her
position would be terminated at
the end of the summer. Although
they offered to stay in Zapata an
extra year, the Burciagas were
told that they needed to move out
of the residence by Aug. 31.
The move to cut Burciaga's po
sition touched off controversy, de
bate and doubt about the adminis
tration's commitment to diversity
issues. Shortly after Burciaga's
layoff, students engaged Univer
sity President Gerhard Casper in
a "debate" in the Quad on the sub
ject, and a month later, nearly 50
people took part in a hunger strike
calling for more attention to Chi
cano/Latino affairs.

professor and advisor in Zapata
for the past two years

1993, wnen Vice Provost for Stu
dent Affairs Mary Edmonds sent
an e-mail message to her staff ask

budget. In response, Burciaga
sent Edmonds six different ideas,
one of which said that she could

don't know, and the provost and
Mary saying this was my idea, that
is a true travesty," she said.
President Casper has stressed
since the layoff that the action was
purely a budget-cutting measure.
Burciaga said that she thought
she was being a "team player" by
suggesting her own elimination.
She added that the message which
seems to have gone out to staff is,
"Don't make any suggestions."
Despite repeated administra
tion vows to the contrary, Burcia
ga believes that there were clearly
political reasons for her depar
ture. "There's no one really in the
University who believes it was

Condoleezza Rice about her lay
off, Burciaga said she told her sup
porters not to fight to keep her
family on campus. She told them
that she "saw the climate chang
ing" and thought she was not
going to be very happy or produc
tive if she stayed. "That's when
the community decided to have
their own goals," she said.

"We knew the University
wasn't going to budge. Their repu
tation was on the line. We just
wanted them to recognize [Burcia
ga's] worth and apologize."

hunger strike

consider the elimination of Burci
aga's position.
Burciaga also said that the mes
sage included a statement about
how she had been with the Univer
sity for 20 years, and would want
to negotiate the idea because she
was not anxious to leave.
"That was October. Mary Ed
monds never once discussed any
of those ideas with me until the
three-minute meeting on March
22," she said. It was at that March
meeting that Burciaga was noti
fied of her layoff.
"I will always wonder why there
was no warning, no discussion ...
but yes, I did suggest that. But

budget cuts. I think it became
pretty clear that I was not going to
be someone who was just going to
be quiet. .. that I knew we made a
lot of progress and that I was
going to keep talking," she said.
Since the announcement of her
elimination, Burciaga has re
ceived "very easily" more than
500 electronic messages, letters
and cards. Although she said that
she feels "very rejected and
wronged" by the administration,
she leaves feeling personally
"overwhelmed by the sense of
support and love" from the stu
dents, faculty and staff.
After meeting with Provost

Qn Wednesday morning,
May 4, nearly 50 Chi
cano and Latino stu
esters filled the Quad
and announced four demands —
among which were more support
for Chicano studies and a high
level position offer for Cecilia Bur
ciaga. The students pledged to
fast for 24 hours, and several of
them vowed not to eat anything
until all their demands were met.
On the following day, more than
250 students rallied in support of
the hunger strikers. The strike
lasted three days and made head
lines across the Bay Area.

"[Burciaga's layoff] was a total,
complete shock. If [the signs ] were

Although committees have
now been set up to look into three
of the demands, the strike result
ed in no new position for Burcia
ga. The strike was entirely stu
dent-run, and Burciaga did not
know about it until the midnight
before it began. That night, three
students came to her and asked
how she thought the administra
tion would react.
"The students were smart
enough to know that this was the
first protest that this administra
tion was going to go through,"
Burciaga said. She credited the
student negotiators as being "stel
lar" and also said that she was
grateful the strike did not last
long.
were so moved, so taken,"
Tony said. "When you see them
doing it, know them, know the
reasons and are involved with it, it
was really very touching."
Watching the strike unfold was
difficult for Cecilia, who described
how painful it was to see the stu
dents on a day-to-day basis. "They
looked different at noon, and they
looked different at dinner," she
said. "You could see the hunger
beginning to take effect. They
started sleeping a lot, they got
very pale."
Burciaga admitted that she
personally wished the students
had not taken that tactic but be
lieved that "as students, they had
to determine their own strategy."
"[Zapata] has been an interesting,
developing cultural resource for
the University. ... It's amazing to
watch it grow."
— James Leckie, civil engineer
ing professor and member of the
search committee that first
brought Burciaga to Stanford
amilia has been an impor
tant aspect of Casa Zapa
ta's reputation in the nine
years that the Burciagas have
been resident fellows. "In our Za
pata family, people might not
agree, but nonetheless they re
spect and support each other,"
Tony said. "And that's what we
wanted ... a supportive home
like atmosphere where you can
get home, kick off your shoes and
not have to prove anything to any
body."
Before the Burciagas began
serving as RFs, Tony said that Za
pata was a "very nationalistic,
very political dorm."
"We wanted to turn it around,"
he said. "We felt the politics will
always be there, but we wanted to
make it a home first of all. . . not
a place where you had to prove
how Chicano or how progressive
you are."
Tony credited the communal
and social gatherings as being
among the most effective and
most important activities in the
dorm. Such activities, he said,
allow people to get to know to each
other, especially during the begin

ning of the year.
"The first one or two months
of every year are very crucial,
critical in trying to form a fa
milia through our staff," he
said. "We're always concerned
about the health of not only the
whole house but of each individ
ual."
In addition to the sense of fa
milia, Zapata is also known for
the murals, painted by Burciaga
and other artists from San Fran
cisco as well as Zapata residents,
that decorate the residence. Cur
rently, 21 murals fill the walls in
Zapata, among the most famous
— not to mention controversial —
of which are "The Spirit of
Hoover," a critique of Reagan-era
American foreign policy; and a
mural depicting such modern-day
personages as Martin Luther
King Jr. and C6sar Chavez in a
Last Supper scene. The newest
mural, which lies beside the en
trance of Zapata, is entitled "The
Founding of Aztlan" and was
painted last year.
According to Religious Studies
Prof. Alice Bach, the murals
"make Zapata unique." She
added, "They make the perspec
tives of Chicano artists available
to the community."
"Cecilia played a lot of different
roles simultaneously. She is very
talented, bright . . . honest and
forthright. . . . She not always
told what you wanted to hear, but
she told you what you ought to
hear."
— Leckie
hroughout their years at
Zapata, the Burciagas
have frequently been em
broiled in controversy and sub
jected to harassment.
For example, in 1988, a series
of vandalism acts occurred at Za
pata. In addition to raw eggs
being broken over the Burciagas'
cars, oil was dumped on their
home, fire extinguishers were
emptied both in Zapata and in
their convertible car, and threat
ening phone calls were made.
Hoping to scare and embarrass
the vandals, Tony put up a sign
outside Zapata which read, "To
the Vandals: You are gutless,
cowardly . . . protected by the
darkness of night and your own
ignorance."
"My reaction," he explained,
"has always been in the creative,
artistic process, doing a big sign
on the wall or writing something
about it. That's my recourse."
It was also during that sum
mer that the Burciagas consid
ered leaving the University. "We
had threatened to leave only be
cause we were fearful for our chil
dren," Cecilia explained. She
added that the support they re
ceived after the vandalism con
vinced them to stay. "We felt im
mediate support from faculty,
students and staff. There was a
real sense of a Stanford commu
nity at that time."
The police never caught the
vandals and were never able to de
termine whether the acts were
personally or racially motivated.
Although the actions stopped as
suddenly as they started, Cecilia's
abrupt layoff this year prompted
some more controversy and invit
ed another act of vandalism.
Near the end of May, raw eggs
were again broken over their car

in the Stern parking lot. The eggs
were apparently thrown at the
bumper sticker which read "No
Grapes."
That incident happened short
ly after a confrontation between
Tony Burciaga and members of
The Stanford Review. Last
spring, members of the student
publication came to Zapata to dis
tribute their newspaper under
neath the doors of Zapata resi
dents.
Tony Burciaga blocked their
path, however, informing them
that Zapata was a flier-free dorm
and that the students were not al
lowed to distribute the issues un
derneath the doors. The issue
contained an editorial entitled
"El Protesto Stupido," which con
demned the actions of the hunger
strikers.
"We had this love for [the
hunger strikers] who are putting
their lives on the line for some
thing they believe in. And then
for the Stanford Review to put
out such an insulting editorial,"
Tony said. "It was almost like the
breaking point. ... I don't want
to even say I lost my temper;
maybe I did, I guess."
"These residences are homes,"
he said. "They are not public
places like people believe they are.
There's a sense of home, of priva
cy that these students have in
each room."
The police were eventually
called in to settle the dispute. In
the wake of the incident, the Uni
versity is currently looking into
the issue of what constitutes a
flier and what can rightfully be
limited in dorm distribution.
"[Cecilia Burciaga] is a very able
person, very strong. I don 7 believe
she won't be doing something im
portant. "
— Former University President
Richard Lyman
wenty years ago, the Burci
agas moved to Stanford
from Washington, D.C.,
with their two week-old baby,
Maria Rebeca. Ironically, their
daughter, now a junior at UC-
Santa Cruz, is now back in Wash
ington, D.C., interning with a
congressman.
Cecilia also has been appointed
to President Clinton's Advisory
Commission on Educational Ex
cellence for Hispanic Americans,
a job which will require her to at
tend frequent meetings in the na
tion's capital. "It's almost as
though there's been a full circle,"
she said.
For Cecilia, a possible dean
ship at Cal-State Monterey Bay,
the newest addition to the Cal
State system, also lies in her fu
ture. She said she finds this
prospect "very exciting" because
the school — currently being con
structed at the former Fort Ord
— would be newly created, and
she would have the possibility of
setting the parameters for her
new position.
"[The job] would be wonderful.
. . . It would be like creating some
thing out of nothing," she said.
Although she has high hopes
for the dean's position, Burciaga
admits that it would be nice to
stop and reflect upon her experi
ences. After her layoff, she said
that she did not know how to
identify herself or her affiliation
with the University. At the same

time, however, she was reminded
that she had an identity before
she came.
"I have to get better at think
ing of who I am, independent of
work," she said.
As for Tony Burciaga, he plans
to continue writing and even has
a new book coming out in Octo
ber. The book is entitled "Spilling
the Beans" and is a collection of
essays on the Chicano experi
ence.
Thinking about the future, he
said, "There is life after Stanford.
It's been a whale of a ride. . . . The
happy, good times will stay with
us forever."
Taking over as RFs of Zapata
will be Arcadio and Ellen
Morales, who both work in the
Office of Development. They will
undergo RF training this month
and will move in to Zapata in Sep
tember. Burciaga said that she
wishes "them a lot of luck and
success," adding that they will in
herit a lot of traditions, joys and
struggles with the dorm.
"I encourage them to protect
the value of family and to remain
vigilant about the future . . . [be
cause] the conservative element
will continue to attack theme
houses," she said.
When asked about her final
thoughts on Stanford, Burciaga
said, "I wish it only the best."
She admitted, however, that she
does have some fears about the
future of the University, one of
which is the lost sense of commu
nity. "I don't know what the new
values are," she said. "As a com
munity, I hope it's addressed
head-on."
In front of Zapata, there rests a
maguey (pronounced magay) cac
tus. For many years, it was easily
overlooked; but last summer, the
cactus shot up and began to blos
som. White flowers grew at its
top, and pods fell on the ground
around it.
"I had never seen this happen,
and I started watching it last
summer. It seemed as though
every day, it just grew longer and
longer," Burciaga explained.
According to Burciaga, a
Mayan who came in May to bless
the house informed her that the
cactus had lived for 20 years. He
said that it had served its pur
pose and that it was now time to
go
"I thought... how symbolic,"
Burciaga said. "Everything was
around me, and I wasn't just
smart enough to read it." ■

which they feel in many ways symbolize the end of their tenure at Stanford.

to even say I lost my temper;
maybe I did, I guess."
"These residences are homes,"
he said. "They are not public
places like people believe they are.
There's a sense of home, of priva
cy that these students have in
each room."
The police were eventually
called in to settle the dispute. In
the wake of the incident, the Uni
versity is currently looking into
the issue of what constitutes a
flier and what can rightfully be
limited in dorm distribution.
"[Cecilia Burciaga] is a very able
person, very strong. I don 7 believe
she won't be doing something im
portant. "
— Former University President
Richard Lyman
wenty years ago, the Burci
agas moved to Stanford
from Washington, D.C.,
with their two week-old baby,
Maria Rebeca. Ironically, their
daughter, now a junior at UC-
Santa Cruz, is now back in Wash
ington, D.C., interning with a
congressman.
Cecilia also has been appointed
to President Clinton's Advisory
Commission on Educational Ex
cellence for Hispanic Americans,
a job which will require her to at
tend frequent meetings in the na
tion's capital. "It's almost as
though there's been a full circle,"
she said.
For Cecilia, a possible dean
ship at Cal-State Monterey Bay,
the newest addition to the Cal
State system, also lies in her fu
ture. She said she finds this
prospect "very exciting" because
the school — currently being con
structed at the former Fort Ord
— would be newly created, and
she would have the possibility of
setting the parameters for her
new position.
"[The job] would be wonderful.
. . . It would be like creating some
thing out of nothing," she said.
Although she has high hopes
for the dean's position, Burciaga
admits that it would be nice to
stop and reflect upon her experi
ences. After her layoff, she said
that she did not know how to
identify herself or her affiliation
with the University. At the same

time, however, she was reminded
that she had an identity before
she came.
"I have to get better at think
ing of who I am, independent of
work," she said.
As for Tony Burciaga, he plans
to continue writing and even has
a new book coming out in Octo
ber. The book is entitled "Spilling
the Beans" and is a collection of
essays on the Chicano experi
ence.
Thinking about the future, he
said, "There is life after Stanford.
It's been a whale of a ride. . . . The
happy, good times will stay with
us forever."
Taking over as RFs of Zapata
will be Arcadio and Ellen
Morales, who both work in the
Office of Development. They will
undergo RF training this month
and will move in to Zapata in Sep
tember. Burciaga said that she
wishes "them a lot of luck and
success," adding that they will in
herit a lot of traditions, joys and
struggles with the dorm.
"I encourage them to protect
the value of family and to remain
vigilant about the future . . . [be
cause] the conservative element
will continue to attack theme
houses," she said.
When asked about her final
thoughts on Stanford, Burciaga
said, "I wish it only the best."
She admitted, however, that she
does have some fears about the
future of the University, one of
which is the lost sense of commu
nity. "I don't know what the new
values are," she said. "As a com
munity, I hope it's addressed
head-on."
In front of Zapata, there rests a
maguey (pronounced magay) cac
tus. For many years, it was easily
overlooked; but last summer, the
cactus shot up and began to blos
som. White flowers grew at its
top, and pods fell on the ground
around it.
"I had never seen this happen,
and I started watching it last
summer. It seemed as though
every day, it just grew longer and
longer," Burciaga explained.
According to Burciaga, a
Mayan who came in May to bless
the house informed her that the
cactus had lived for 20 years. He
said that it had served its pur
pose and that it was now time to
go
"I thought... how symbolic,"
Burciaga said. "Everything was
around me, and I wasn't just
smart enough to read it." ■

As a general rule, national
ly known figures are not
easily accessible to the
general public. However, for stu
dents in a university such as Stan
ford — where national figures are
omnipresent — exceptions do
exist.
For example, while Cecilia and
Jose Antonio Burciaga are known
across the country for their work
on improving the status of people
of color, they have always re
mained in close contact with stu
dents and colleagues alike. Hav
ing served as resident fellows at
Casa Zapata — the Chicano and
Mexican-American theme house
— for the past nine years, the Bur
ciagas are known by the students
as "always being there," accord
ing to recent graduate Julia Gon
zalez Luna.
"[Cecilia Burciaga] is your
friend, your mother," Gonzalez
Luna added. "There's something
more in there [that] I haven't ex
perienced in any other dorm."
Cecilia first came to Stanford
in 1974 as assistant to the presi
dent and advisor to the provost on
Chicano affairs. In the past 20
years, she has filled eight differ
ent positions and has seen three
different presidents lead the ad
ministration. Currently an associ
ate dean in the Office for Student
Affairs, Cecilia is the highest
ranking Chicana administrator at
Stanford.
"I always saw my role as some
one who very much wanted Stan
ford to live up to its potential and
to be a leader in diversity issues,"
she said.
Like his wife, Tony Burciaga
has also worked to bring attention
to issues of race and class
throughout his tenure at Stan
ford, which began when he and
Cecilia became Casa Zapata's RFs
in 1985. To this end, he has
taught courses on muralism —
the painting of murals — and has
written for the San Jose Mercury
News.
However, the last several
months have brought many
changes to the Burciagas. In
March, Cecilia Burciaga was noti
fied that due to budget cuts, her
position would be terminated at
the end of the summer. Although
they offered to stay in Zapata an
extra year, the Burciagas were
told that they needed to move out
of the residence by Aug. 31.
The move to cut Burciaga's po
sition touched off controversy, de
bate and doubt about the adminis
tration's commitment to diversity
issues. Shortly after Burciaga's
layoff, students engaged Univer
sity President Gerhard Casper in
a "debate" in the Quad on the sub
ject, and a month later, nearly 50
people took part in a hunger strike
calling for more attention to Chi
cano/Latino affairs.

1993, wnen Vice Provost for Stu

an e-mail message to her staff ask

don't know, and the provost and
Mary saying this was my idea, that
is a true travesty," she said.
President Casper has stressed
since the layoff that the action was
purely a budget-cutting measure.
Burciaga said that she thought
she was being a "team player" by
suggesting her own elimination.
She added that the message which
seems to have gone out to staff is,
"Don't make any suggestions."
Despite repeated administra
tion vows to the contrary, Burcia
ga believes that there were clearly
political reasons for her depar
ture. "There's no one really in the
University who believes it was

Condoleezza Rice about her lay
off, Burciaga said she told her sup
porters not to fight to keep her
family on campus. She told them
that she "saw the climate chang
ing" and thought she was not
going to be very happy or produc
tive if she stayed. "That's when
the community decided to have
their own goals," she said.

"We knew the University
wasn't going to budge. Their repu
tation was on the line. We just
wanted them to recognize [Burcia
ga's] worth and apologize."

hunger strike

consider the elimination of Burci
aga's position.
Burciaga also said that the mes
sage included a statement about
how she had been with the Univer
sity for 20 years, and would want
to negotiate the idea because she
was not anxious to leave.
"That was October. Mary Ed
monds never once discussed any
of those ideas with me until the
three-minute meeting on March
22," she said. It was at that March
meeting that Burciaga was noti
fied of her layoff.
"I will always wonder why there
was no warning, no discussion ...
but yes, I did suggest that. But

budget cuts. I think it became
pretty clear that I was not going to
be someone who was just going to
be quiet. .. that I knew we made a
lot of progress and that I was
going to keep talking," she said.
Since the announcement of her
elimination, Burciaga has re
ceived "very easily" more than
500 electronic messages, letters
and cards. Although she said that
she feels "very rejected and
wronged" by the administration,
she leaves feeling personally
"overwhelmed by the sense of
support and love" from the stu
dents, faculty and staff.
After meeting with Provost

Qn Wednesday morning,
May 4, nearly 50 Chi
cano and Latino stu
esters filled the Quad
and announced four demands —
among which were more support
for Chicano studies and a high
level position offer for Cecilia Bur
ciaga. The students pledged to
fast for 24 hours, and several of
them vowed not to eat anything
until all their demands were met.
On the following day, more than
250 students rallied in support of
the hunger strikers. The strike
lasted three days and made head
lines across the Bay Area.

"[Burciaga's layoff] was a total,
complete shock. If [the signs ] were

Although committees have
now been set up to look into three
of the demands, the strike result
ed in no new position for Burcia
ga. The strike was entirely stu
dent-run, and Burciaga did not
know about it until the midnight
before it began. That night, three
students came to her and asked
how she thought the administra
tion would react.
"The students were smart
enough to know that this was the
first protest that this administra
tion was going to go through,"
Burciaga said. She credited the
student negotiators as being "stel
lar" and also said that she was
grateful the strike did not last
long.
were so moved, so taken,"
Tony said. "When you see them
doing it, know them, know the
reasons and are involved with it, it
was really very touching."
Watching the strike unfold was
difficult for Cecilia, who described
how painful it was to see the stu
dents on a day-to-day basis. "They
looked different at noon, and they
looked different at dinner," she
said. "You could see the hunger
beginning to take effect. They
started sleeping a lot, they got
very pale."
Burciaga admitted that she
personally wished the students
had not taken that tactic but be
lieved that "as students, they had
to determine their own strategy."
"[Zapata] has been an interesting,
developing cultural resource for
the University. ... It's amazing to
watch it grow."
— James Leckie, civil engineer
ing professor and member of the
search committee that first
brought Burciaga to Stanford
amilia has been an impor
tant aspect of Casa Zapa
ta's reputation in the nine
years that the Burciagas have
been resident fellows. "In our Za
pata family, people might not
agree, but nonetheless they re
spect and support each other,"
Tony said. "And that's what we
wanted ... a supportive home
like atmosphere where you can
get home, kick off your shoes and
not have to prove anything to any
body."
Before the Burciagas began
serving as RFs, Tony said that Za
pata was a "very nationalistic,
very political dorm."
"We wanted to turn it around,"
he said. "We felt the politics will
always be there, but we wanted to
make it a home first of all. . . not
a place where you had to prove
how Chicano or how progressive
you are."
Tony credited the communal
and social gatherings as being
among the most effective and
most important activities in the
dorm. Such activities, he said,
allow people to get to know to each
other, especially during the begin

ning of the year.
"The first one or two months
of every year are very crucial,
critical in trying to form a fa
milia through our staff," he
said. "We're always concerned
about the health of not only the
whole house but of each individ
ual."
In addition to the sense of fa
milia, Zapata is also known for
the murals, painted by Burciaga
and other artists from San Fran
cisco as well as Zapata residents,
that decorate the residence. Cur
rently, 21 murals fill the walls in
Zapata, among the most famous
— not to mention controversial —
of which are "The Spirit of
Hoover," a critique of Reagan-era
American foreign policy; and a
mural depicting such modern-day
personages as Martin Luther
King Jr. and C6sar Chavez in a
Last Supper scene. The newest
mural, which lies beside the en
trance of Zapata, is entitled "The
Founding of Aztlan" and was
painted last year.
According to Religious Studies
Prof. Alice Bach, the murals
"make Zapata unique." She
added, "They make the perspec
tives of Chicano artists available
to the community."
"Cecilia played a lot of different
roles simultaneously. She is very
talented, bright . . . honest and
forthright. . . . She not always
told what you wanted to hear, but
she told you what you ought to
hear."
— Leckie
hroughout their years at
Zapata, the Burciagas
have frequently been em
broiled in controversy and sub
jected to harassment.
For example, in 1988, a series
of vandalism acts occurred at Za
pata. In addition to raw eggs
being broken over the Burciagas'
cars, oil was dumped on their
home, fire extinguishers were
emptied both in Zapata and in
their convertible car, and threat
ening phone calls were made.
Hoping to scare and embarrass
the vandals, Tony put up a sign
outside Zapata which read, "To
the Vandals: You are gutless,
cowardly . . . protected by the
darkness of night and your own
ignorance."
"My reaction," he explained,
"has always been in the creative,
artistic process, doing a big sign
on the wall or writing something
about it. That's my recourse."
It was also during that sum
mer that the Burciagas consid
ered leaving the University. "We
had threatened to leave only be
cause we were fearful for our chil
dren," Cecilia explained. She
added that the support they re
ceived after the vandalism con
vinced them to stay. "We felt im
mediate support from faculty,
students and staff. There was a
real sense of a Stanford commu
nity at that time."
The police never caught the
vandals and were never able to de
termine whether the acts were
personally or racially motivated.
Although the actions stopped as
suddenly as they started, Cecilia's
abrupt layoff this year prompted
some more controversy and invit
ed another act of vandalism.
Near the end of May, raw eggs
were again broken over their car

in the Stern parking lot. The eggs
were apparently thrown at the
bumper sticker which read "No
Grapes."
That incident happened short
ly after a confrontation between
Tony Burciaga and members of
The Stanford Review. Last
spring, members of the student
publication came to Zapata to dis
tribute their newspaper under
neath the doors of Zapata resi
dents.
Tony Burciaga blocked their
path, however, informing them
that Zapata was a flier-free dorm
and that the students were not al
lowed to distribute the issues un
derneath the doors. The issue
contained an editorial entitled
"El Protesto Stupido," which con
demned the actions of the hunger
strikers.
"We had this love for [the
hunger strikers] who are putting
their lives on the line for some
thing they believe in. And then
for the Stanford Review to put
out such an insulting editorial,"
Tony said. "It was almost like the
breaking point. ... I don't want
to even say I lost my temper;
maybe I did, I guess."
"These residences are homes,"
he said. "They are not public
places like people believe they are.

The police were eventually
called in to settle the dispute. In

not have to prove anything to any
body."
Before the Burciagas began
serving as RFs, Tony said that Za
pata was a "very nationalistic,
very political dorm."
"We wanted to turn it around,"
he said. "We felt the politics will
always be there, but we wanted to
make it a home first of all. . . not
a place where you had to prove
how Chicano or how progressive
you are."
Tony credited the communal
and social gatherings as being
among the most effective and
most important activities in the
dorm. Such activities, he said,
allow people to get to know to each
other, especially during the begin

ning of the year.
"The first one or two months
of every year are very crucial,
critical in trying to form a fa
milia through our staff," he
said. "We're always concerned
about the health of not only the
whole house but of each individ
ual."
In addition to the sense of fa
milia, Zapata is also known for
the murals, painted by Burciaga
and other artists from San Fran
cisco as well as Zapata residents,
that decorate the residence. Cur
rently, 21 murals fill the walls in
Zapata, among the most famous
— not to mention controversial —
of which are "The Spirit of
Hoover," a critique of Reagan-era
American foreign policy; and a
mural depicting such modern-day
personages as Martin Luther
King Jr. and C6sar Chavez in a
Last Supper scene. The newest
mural, which lies beside the en
trance of Zapata, is entitled "The
Founding of Aztlan" and was
painted last year.
According to Religious Studies
Prof. Alice Bach, the murals
"make Zapata unique." She
added, "They make the perspec
tives of Chicano artists available
to the community."
"Cecilia played a lot of different
roles simultaneously. She is very
talented, bright . . . honest and
forthright. . . . She not always
told what you wanted to hear, but
she told you what you ought to
hear."

hroughout their years at
Zapata, the Burciagas
have frequently been em
broiled in controversy and sub
jected to harassment.
For example, in 1988, a series
of vandalism acts occurred at Za
pata. In addition to raw eggs
being broken over the Burciagas'
cars, oil was dumped on their
home, fire extinguishers were
emptied both in Zapata and in
their convertible car, and threat
ening phone calls were made.
Hoping to scare and embarrass
the vandals, Tony put up a sign
outside Zapata which read, "To
the Vandals: You are gutless,
cowardly . . . protected by the
darkness of night and your own
ignorance."
"My reaction," he explained,
"has always been in the creative,
artistic process, doing a big sign
on the wall or writing something
about it. That's my recourse."
It was also during that sum
mer that the Burciagas consid
ered leaving the University. "We
had threatened to leave only be
cause we were fearful for our chil
dren," Cecilia explained. She
added that the support they re
ceived after the vandalism con
vinced them to stay. "We felt im
mediate support from faculty,
students and staff. There was a
real sense of a Stanford commu
nity at that time."
The police never caught the
vandals and were never able to de
termine whether the acts were
personally or racially motivated.
Although the actions stopped as
suddenly as they started, Cecilia's
abrupt layoff this year prompted
some more controversy and invit
ed another act of vandalism.
Near the end of May, raw eggs
were again broken over their car

in the Stern parking lot. The eggs
were apparently thrown at the
bumper sticker which read "No
Grapes."
That incident happened short
ly after a confrontation between
Tony Burciaga and members of
The Stanford Review. Last
spring, members of the student
publication came to Zapata to dis
tribute their newspaper under
neath the doors of Zapata resi
dents.
Tony Burciaga blocked their
path, however, informing them
that Zapata was a flier-free dorm
and that the students were not al
lowed to distribute the issues un
derneath the doors. The issue
contained an editorial entitled
"El Protesto Stupido," which con
demned the actions of the hunger
strikers.
"We had this love for [the
hunger strikers] who are putting
their lives on the line for some
thing they believe in. And then
for the Stanford Review to put
out such an insulting editorial,"
Tony said. "It was almost like the
breaking point. ... I don't want
to even say I lost my temper;
maybe I did, I guess."
"These residences are homes,"
he said. "They are not public
places like people believe they are.
There's a sense of home, of priva
cy that these students have in
each room."
The police were eventually
called in to settle the dispute. In
the wake of the incident, the Uni
versity is currently looking into
the issue of what constitutes a
flier and what can rightfully be
limited in dorm distribution.
"[Cecilia Burciaga] is a very able
person, very strong. I don 7 believe
she won't be doing something im
portant. "
— Former University President
Richard Lyman
wenty years ago, the Burci
agas moved to Stanford
from Washington, D.C.,
with their two week-old baby,
Maria Rebeca. Ironically, their
daughter, now a junior at UC-
Santa Cruz, is now back in Wash
ington, D.C., interning with a
congressman.
Cecilia also has been appointed
to President Clinton's Advisory
Commission on Educational Ex
cellence for Hispanic Americans,
a job which will require her to at
tend frequent meetings in the na
tion's capital. "It's almost as
though there's been a full circle,"
she said.
For Cecilia, a possible dean
ship at Cal-State Monterey Bay,
the newest addition to the Cal
State system, also lies in her fu
ture. She said she finds this
prospect "very exciting" because
the school — currently being con
structed at the former Fort Ord
— would be newly created, and
she would have the possibility of
setting the parameters for her
new position.
"[The job] would be wonderful.
. . . It would be like creating some
thing out of nothing," she said.
Although she has high hopes
for the dean's position, Burciaga
admits that it would be nice to
stop and reflect upon her experi
ences. After her layoff, she said
that she did not know how to
identify herself or her affiliation
with the University. At the same

time, however, she was reminded
that she had an identity before
she came.
"I have to get better at think
ing of who I am, independent of
work," she said.
As for Tony Burciaga, he plans
to continue writing and even has
a new book coming out in Octo
ber. The book is entitled "Spilling
the Beans" and is a collection of
essays on the Chicano experi
ence.
Thinking about the future, he
said, "There is life after Stanford.
It's been a whale of a ride. . . . The
happy, good times will stay with
us forever."
Taking over as RFs of Zapata
will be Arcadio and Ellen
Morales, who both work in the
Office of Development. They will
undergo RF training this month
and will move in to Zapata in Sep
tember. Burciaga said that she
wishes "them a lot of luck and
success," adding that they will in
herit a lot of traditions, joys and
struggles with the dorm.
"I encourage them to protect
the value of family and to remain
vigilant about the future . . . [be
cause] the conservative element
will continue to attack theme
houses," she said.
When asked about her final
thoughts on Stanford, Burciaga
said, "I wish it only the best."
She admitted, however, that she
does have some fears about the
future of the University, one of
which is the lost sense of commu
nity. "I don't know what the new
values are," she said. "As a com
munity, I hope it's addressed
head-on."
In front of Zapata, there rests a
maguey (pronounced magay) cac
tus. For many years, it was easily
overlooked; but last summer, the
cactus shot up and began to blos
som. White flowers grew at its
top, and pods fell on the ground
around it.
"I had never seen this happen,
and I started watching it last
summer. It seemed as though
every day, it just grew longer and
longer," Burciaga explained.
According to Burciaga, a
Mayan who came in May to bless
the house informed her that the
cactus had lived for 20 years. He
said that it had served its pur
pose and that it was now time to
go
"I thought... how symbolic,"
Burciaga said. "Everything was
around me, and I wasn't just
smart enough to read it." ■

As a general rule, national
ly known figures are not
easily accessible to the
general public. However, for stu
dents in a university such as Stan
ford — where national figures are
omnipresent — exceptions do
exist.
For example, while Cecilia and
Jose Antonio Burciaga are known
across the country for their work
on improving the status of people
of color, they have always re
mained in close contact with stu
dents and colleagues alike. Hav
ing served as resident fellows at
Casa Zapata — the Chicano and
Mexican-American theme house
— for the past nine years, the Bur
ciagas are known by the students
as "always being there," accord
ing to recent graduate Julia Gon
zalez Luna.
"[Cecilia Burciaga] is your
friend, your mother," Gonzalez
Luna added. "There's something
more in there [that] I haven't ex
perienced in any other dorm."
Cecilia first came to Stanford
in 1974 as assistant to the presi
dent and advisor to the provost on
Chicano affairs. In the past 20
years, she has filled eight differ
ent positions and has seen three
different presidents lead the ad
ministration. Currently an associ
ate dean in the Office for Student
Affairs, Cecilia is the highest
ranking Chicana administrator at
Stanford.
"I always saw my role as some
one who very much wanted Stan
ford to live up to its potential and
to be a leader in diversity issues,"
she said.
Like his wife, Tony Burciaga
has also worked to bring attention
to issues of race and class
throughout his tenure at Stan
ford, which began when he and
Cecilia became Casa Zapata's RFs
in 1985. To this end, he has
taught courses on muralism —
the painting of murals — and has
written for the San Jose Mercury
News.
However, the last several
months have brought many
changes to the Burciagas. In
March, Cecilia Burciaga was noti
fied that due to budget cuts, her
position would be terminated at
the end of the summer. Although
they offered to stay in Zapata an
extra year, the Burciagas were
told that they needed to move out
of the residence by Aug. 31.
The move to cut Burciaga's po
sition touched off controversy, de
bate and doubt about the adminis
tration's commitment to diversity
issues. Shortly after Burciaga's
layoff, students engaged Univer
sity President Gerhard Casper in
a "debate" in the Quad on the sub
ject, and a month later, nearly 50
people took part in a hunger strike
calling for more attention to Chi
cano/Latino affairs.

professor and advisor in Zapata

/ \ events began in October,
1993, wnen Vice Provost for Stu

an e-mail message to her staff ask

don't know, and the provost and
Mary saying this was my idea, that
is a true travesty," she said.
President Casper has stressed
since the layoff that the action was
purely a budget-cutting measure.
Burciaga said that she thought
she was being a "team player" by
suggesting her own elimination.
She added that the message which
seems to have gone out to staff is,
"Don't make any suggestions."
Despite repeated administra
tion vows to the contrary, Burcia
ga believes that there were clearly
political reasons for her depar
ture. "There's no one really in the
University who believes it was

Condoleezza Rice about her lay
off, Burciaga said she told her sup
porters not to fight to keep her
family on campus. She told them
that she "saw the climate chang
ing" and thought she was not
going to be very happy or produc
tive if she stayed. "That's when
the community decided to have
their own goals," she said.

"We knew the University
wasn't going to budge. Their repu
tation was on the line. We just
wanted them to recognize [Burcia
ga's] worth and apologize."

hunger strike

aga's position.
Burciaga also said that the mes
sage included a statement about
how she had been with the Univer
sity for 20 years, and would want
to negotiate the idea because she
was not anxious to leave.
"That was October. Mary Ed
monds never once discussed any
of those ideas with me until the
three-minute meeting on March
22," she said. It was at that March
meeting that Burciaga was noti
fied of her layoff.
"I will always wonder why there
was no warning, no discussion ...
but yes, I did suggest that. But

budget cuts. I think it became
pretty clear that I was not going to
be someone who was just going to
be quiet. .. that I knew we made a
lot of progress and that I was
going to keep talking," she said.
Since the announcement of her
elimination, Burciaga has re
ceived "very easily" more than
500 electronic messages, letters
and cards. Although she said that
she feels "very rejected and
wronged" by the administration,
she leaves feeling personally
"overwhelmed by the sense of
support and love" from the stu
dents, faculty and staff.
After meeting with Provost

Qn Wednesday morning,
May 4, nearly 50 Chi
cano and Latino stu
esters filled the Quad
and announced four demands —
among which were more support
for Chicano studies and a high
level position offer for Cecilia Bur
ciaga. The students pledged to
fast for 24 hours, and several of
them vowed not to eat anything
until all their demands were met.
On the following day, more than
250 students rallied in support of
the hunger strikers. The strike
lasted three days and made head
lines across the Bay Area.

"[Burciaga's layoff] was a total,
complete shock. If [the signs ] were

now been set up to look into three
of the demands, the strike result

ga. The strike was entirely stu
dent-run, and Burciaga did not
know about it until the midnight
before it began. That night, three
students came to her and asked
how she thought the administra
tion would react.
"The students were smart
enough to know that this was the
first protest that this administra
tion was going to go through,"
Burciaga said. She credited the
student negotiators as being "stel
lar" and also said that she was
grateful the strike did not last
long.
were so moved, so taken,"
Tony said. "When you see them
doing it, know them, know the
reasons and are involved with it, it
was really very touching."
Watching the strike unfold was
difficult for Cecilia, who described
how painful it was to see the stu
dents on a day-to-day basis. "They
looked different at noon, and they
looked different at dinner," she
said. "You could see the hunger
beginning to take effect. They
started sleeping a lot, they got
very pale."
Burciaga admitted that she
personally wished the students
had not taken that tactic but be
lieved that "as students, they had
to determine their own strategy."
"[Zapata] has been an interesting,
developing cultural resource for
the University. ... It's amazing to
watch it grow."
— James Leckie, civil engineer
ing professor and member of the
search committee that first
brought Burciaga to Stanford
amilia has been an impor
tant aspect of Casa Zapa
ta's reputation in the nine
years that the Burciagas have
been resident fellows. "In our Za
pata family, people might not
agree, but nonetheless they re
spect and support each other,"
Tony said. "And that's what we
wanted ... a supportive home
like atmosphere where you can
get home, kick off your shoes and
not have to prove anything to any
body."
Before the Burciagas began
serving as RFs, Tony said that Za
pata was a "very nationalistic,
very political dorm."
"We wanted to turn it around,"
he said. "We felt the politics will
always be there, but we wanted to
make it a home first of all. . . not
a place where you had to prove
how Chicano or how progressive
you are."
Tony credited the communal
and social gatherings as being
among the most effective and
most important activities in the
dorm. Such activities, he said,
allow people to get to know to each

"The first one or two months
of every year are very crucial,

said. "We're always concerned

In addition to the sense of fa

the murals, painted by Burciaga

Burciaga also said that the mes
sage included a statement about
how she had been with the Univer
sity for 20 years, and would want
to negotiate the idea because she
was not anxious to leave.
"That was October. Mary Ed
monds never once discussed any
of those ideas with me until the
three-minute meeting on March
22," she said. It was at that March
meeting that Burciaga was noti
fied of her layoff.

pretty clear that I was not going to
be someone who was just going to
be quiet. .. that I knew we made a
lot of progress and that I was
going to keep talking," she said.
Since the announcement of her
elimination, Burciaga has re
ceived "very easily" more than
500 electronic messages, letters
and cards. Although she said that
she feels "very rejected and
wronged" by the administration,
she leaves feeling personally
"overwhelmed by the sense of
support and love" from the stu
dents, faculty and staff.
After meeting with Provost

Qn Wednesday morning,
May 4, nearly 50 Chi
cano and Latino stu
esters filled the Quad
and announced four demands —
among which were more support
for Chicano studies and a high
level position offer for Cecilia Bur
ciaga. The students pledged to
fast for 24 hours, and several of
them vowed not to eat anything
until all their demands were met.
On the following day, more than
250 students rallied in support of
the hunger strikers. The strike
lasted three days and made head
lines across the Bay Area.

"[Burciaga's layoff] was a total,
complete shock. If [the signs ] were

now been set up to look into three
of the demands, the strike result
ed in no new position for Burcia
ga. The strike was entirely stu
dent-run, and Burciaga did not
know about it until the midnight
before it began. That night, three
students came to her and asked
how she thought the administra
tion would react.
"The students were smart
enough to know that this was the
first protest that this administra
tion was going to go through,"
Burciaga said. She credited the
student negotiators as being "stel
lar" and also said that she was
grateful the strike did not last
long.
were so moved, so taken,"
Tony said. "When you see them
doing it, know them, know the
reasons and are involved with it, it
was really very touching."
Watching the strike unfold was
difficult for Cecilia, who described
how painful it was to see the stu
dents on a day-to-day basis. "They
looked different at noon, and they
looked different at dinner," she
said. "You could see the hunger
beginning to take effect. They
started sleeping a lot, they got
very pale."
Burciaga admitted that she
personally wished the students
had not taken that tactic but be
lieved that "as students, they had
to determine their own strategy."
"[Zapata] has been an interesting,
developing cultural resource for
the University. ... It's amazing to
watch it grow."
— James Leckie, civil engineer
ing professor and member of the
search committee that first
brought Burciaga to Stanford
amilia has been an impor
tant aspect of Casa Zapa
ta's reputation in the nine
years that the Burciagas have
been resident fellows. "In our Za
pata family, people might not
agree, but nonetheless they re
spect and support each other,"
Tony said. "And that's what we
wanted ... a supportive home
like atmosphere where you can
get home, kick off your shoes and
not have to prove anything to any
body."
Before the Burciagas began
serving as RFs, Tony said that Za
pata was a "very nationalistic,
very political dorm."
"We wanted to turn it around,"
he said. "We felt the politics will
always be there, but we wanted to
make it a home first of all. . . not
a place where you had to prove
how Chicano or how progressive
you are."
Tony credited the communal
and social gatherings as being
among the most effective and
most important activities in the
dorm. Such activities, he said,
allow people to get to know to each
other, especially during the begin

ning of the year.
"The first one or two months
of every year are very crucial,
critical in trying to form a fa
milia through our staff," he
said. "We're always concerned
about the health of not only the
whole house but of each individ
ual."
In addition to the sense of fa
milia, Zapata is also known for
the murals, painted by Burciaga
and other artists from San Fran
cisco as well as Zapata residents,
that decorate the residence. Cur
rently, 21 murals fill the walls in
Zapata, among the most famous
— not to mention controversial —
of which are "The Spirit of
Hoover," a critique of Reagan-era
American foreign policy; and a
mural depicting such modern-day
personages as Martin Luther
King Jr. and C6sar Chavez in a
Last Supper scene. The newest
mural, which lies beside the en
trance of Zapata, is entitled "The
Founding of Aztlan" and was
painted last year.
According to Religious Studies
Prof. Alice Bach, the murals
"make Zapata unique." She
added, "They make the perspec
tives of Chicano artists available
to the community."
"Cecilia played a lot of different
roles simultaneously. She is very
talented, bright . . . honest and
forthright. . . . She not always
told what you wanted to hear, but
she told you what you ought to
hear."
— Leckie
hroughout their years at
Zapata, the Burciagas
have frequently been em
broiled in controversy and sub
jected to harassment.
For example, in 1988, a series
of vandalism acts occurred at Za
pata. In addition to raw eggs
being broken over the Burciagas'
cars, oil was dumped on their
home, fire extinguishers were
emptied both in Zapata and in
their convertible car, and threat
ening phone calls were made.
Hoping to scare and embarrass
the vandals, Tony put up a sign
outside Zapata which read, "To
the Vandals: You are gutless,
cowardly . . . protected by the
darkness of night and your own
ignorance."
"My reaction," he explained,
"has always been in the creative,
artistic process, doing a big sign
on the wall or writing something
about it. That's my recourse."
It was also during that sum
mer that the Burciagas consid
ered leaving the University. "We
had threatened to leave only be
cause we were fearful for our chil
dren," Cecilia explained. She
added that the support they re
ceived after the vandalism con
vinced them to stay. "We felt im
mediate support from faculty,
students and staff. There was a
real sense of a Stanford commu
nity at that time."
The police never caught the
vandals and were never able to de
termine whether the acts were
personally or racially motivated.
Although the actions stopped as
suddenly as they started, Cecilia's
abrupt layoff this year prompted
some more controversy and invit
ed another act of vandalism.
Near the end of May, raw eggs
were again broken over their car

in the Stern parking lot. The eggs
were apparently thrown at the
bumper sticker which read "No
Grapes."
That incident happened short
ly after a confrontation between
Tony Burciaga and members of
The Stanford Review. Last
spring, members of the student
publication came to Zapata to dis
tribute their newspaper under
neath the doors of Zapata resi
dents.
Tony Burciaga blocked their
path, however, informing them
that Zapata was a flier-free dorm
and that the students were not al
lowed to distribute the issues un
derneath the doors. The issue
contained an editorial entitled
"El Protesto Stupido," which con
demned the actions of the hunger
strikers.
"We had this love for [the
hunger strikers] who are putting
their lives on the line for some
thing they believe in. And then
for the Stanford Review to put
out such an insulting editorial,"
Tony said. "It was almost like the
breaking point. ... I don't want
to even say I lost my temper;
maybe I did, I guess."
"These residences are homes,"
he said. "They are not public
places like people believe they are.
There's a sense of home, of priva
cy that these students have in
each room."
The police were eventually
called in to settle the dispute. In
the wake of the incident, the Uni
versity is currently looking into
the issue of what constitutes a
flier and what can rightfully be
limited in dorm distribution.
"[Cecilia Burciaga] is a very able
person, very strong. I don 7 believe
she won't be doing something im
portant. "

wenty years ago, the Burci
agas moved to Stanford
from Washington, D.C.,
with their two week-old baby,
Maria Rebeca. Ironically, their
daughter, now a junior at UC-
Santa Cruz, is now back in Wash
ington, D.C., interning with a
congressman.
Cecilia also has been appointed
to President Clinton's Advisory
Commission on Educational Ex
cellence for Hispanic Americans,
a job which will require her to at
tend frequent meetings in the na
tion's capital. "It's almost as
though there's been a full circle,"
she said.
For Cecilia, a possible dean
ship at Cal-State Monterey Bay,
the newest addition to the Cal
State system, also lies in her fu
ture. She said she finds this
prospect "very exciting" because
the school — currently being con
structed at the former Fort Ord
— would be newly created, and
she would have the possibility of
setting the parameters for her
new position.
"[The job] would be wonderful.
. . . It would be like creating some
thing out of nothing," she said.
Although she has high hopes
for the dean's position, Burciaga
admits that it would be nice to
stop and reflect upon her experi
ences. After her layoff, she said
that she did not know how to
identify herself or her affiliation
with the University. At the same

time, however, she was reminded
that she had an identity before
she came.
"I have to get better at think
ing of who I am, independent of
work," she said.
As for Tony Burciaga, he plans
to continue writing and even has
a new book coming out in Octo
ber. The book is entitled "Spilling
the Beans" and is a collection of
essays on the Chicano experi
ence.
Thinking about the future, he
said, "There is life after Stanford.
It's been a whale of a ride. . . . The
happy, good times will stay with
us forever."
Taking over as RFs of Zapata
will be Arcadio and Ellen
Morales, who both work in the
Office of Development. They will
undergo RF training this month
and will move in to Zapata in Sep
tember. Burciaga said that she
wishes "them a lot of luck and
success," adding that they will in
herit a lot of traditions, joys and
struggles with the dorm.
"I encourage them to protect
the value of family and to remain
vigilant about the future . . . [be
cause] the conservative element
will continue to attack theme
houses," she said.
When asked about her final
thoughts on Stanford, Burciaga
said, "I wish it only the best."
She admitted, however, that she
does have some fears about the
future of the University, one of
which is the lost sense of commu
nity. "I don't know what the new
values are," she said. "As a com
munity, I hope it's addressed
head-on."
In front of Zapata, there rests a
maguey (pronounced magay) cac
tus. For many years, it was easily
overlooked; but last summer, the
cactus shot up and began to blos
som. White flowers grew at its
top, and pods fell on the ground
around it.
"I had never seen this happen,
and I started watching it last
summer. It seemed as though
every day, it just grew longer and
longer," Burciaga explained.
According to Burciaga, a
Mayan who came in May to bless
the house informed her that the
cactus had lived for 20 years. He
said that it had served its pur
pose and that it was now time to
go
"I thought... how symbolic,"
Burciaga said. "Everything was
around me, and I wasn't just
smart enough to read it." ■

As a general rule, national
ly known figures are not
easily accessible to the
general public. However, for stu
dents in a university such as Stan
ford — where national figures are
omnipresent — exceptions do
exist.
For example, while Cecilia and
Jose Antonio Burciaga are known
across the country for their work
on improving the status of people
of color, they have always re
mained in close contact with stu
dents and colleagues alike. Hav
ing served as resident fellows at
Casa Zapata — the Chicano and
Mexican-American theme house
— for the past nine years, the Bur
ciagas are known by the students
as "always being there," accord
ing to recent graduate Julia Gon
zalez Luna.
"[Cecilia Burciaga] is your
friend, your mother," Gonzalez
Luna added. "There's something
more in there [that] I haven't ex
perienced in any other dorm."
Cecilia first came to Stanford
in 1974 as assistant to the presi
dent and advisor to the provost on
Chicano affairs. In the past 20
years, she has filled eight differ
ent positions and has seen three
different presidents lead the ad
ministration. Currently an associ
ate dean in the Office for Student
Affairs, Cecilia is the highest
ranking Chicana administrator at
Stanford.
"I always saw my role as some
one who very much wanted Stan
ford to live up to its potential and
to be a leader in diversity issues,"
she said.
Like his wife, Tony Burciaga
has also worked to bring attention
to issues of race and class
throughout his tenure at Stan
ford, which began when he and
Cecilia became Casa Zapata's RFs
in 1985. To this end, he has
taught courses on muralism —
the painting of murals — and has
written for the San Jose Mercury
News.
However, the last several
months have brought many
changes to the Burciagas. In
March, Cecilia Burciaga was noti
fied that due to budget cuts, her
position would be terminated at
the end of the summer. Although
they offered to stay in Zapata an
extra year, the Burciagas were
told that they needed to move out
of the residence by Aug. 31.
The move to cut Burciaga's po
sition touched off controversy, de
bate and doubt about the adminis
tration's commitment to diversity
issues. Shortly after Burciaga's
layoff, students engaged Univer
sity President Gerhard Casper in
a "debate" in the Quad on the sub
ject, and a month later, nearly 50
people took part in a hunger strike
calling for more attention to Chi
cano/Latino affairs.

don't know, and the provost and
Mary saying this was my idea, that
is a true travesty," she said.
President Casper has stressed
since the layoff that the action was
purely a budget-cutting measure.
Burciaga said that she thought
she was being a "team player" by
suggesting her own elimination.
She added that the message which
seems to have gone out to staff is,
"Don't make any suggestions."
