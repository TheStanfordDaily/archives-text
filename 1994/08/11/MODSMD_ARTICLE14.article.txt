## Stanford Hair Styling's proprietors face an uncertain future 
### Julie Mitchell 
It's around 10 a.m. on a Wednesday in
late July. Not a trace of hair is visible on
the shiny linoleum floor, no music plays
in the background and all but two of the
swivel chairs are empty.
Though it is always quiet during sum
mer session at Stanford University, this
year the Stanford Hair Styling salon in
Tresidder Union seems uncomfortably de
serted.
Seated in the two chairs are Carmelo
Cogliandro and Newell Whitford, the sa
lons' proprietors. For a combined total of
more than 70 years, this gray-haired pair
has been trimming the locks of Stanford
students, faculty and staff from their nook
between the Coffee House and the cafe.
However, Cogliandro and Whitford's es
tablished business and their collective, col
orful history is now threatened. Recent
shake-ups in the management of Tresidder
Union have left their future of their salon in
doubt. And while the pair have survived
similar scares in the past, the recent
changes may finally spell the end to yet an
other Stanford tradition.
Future uncertain
The most recent scare began in June,
when it was announced that the Stanford
Management Company — which runs the
Stanford Shopping Center and manages
the University's endowment — would take
over management of Tresidder Union in
the hopes of making it more profitable.
"Currently, the University is subsidiz
ing Tresidder Union in the amount of
$700,000," said Dorthea Gregowski, assis
tant director of the Stanford Shopping Cen
ter. "Our goal is to make the area viable to
break even in three years and then start
making revenue."
Regarding the current tenants of Tresid
der, "No final decisions have been made and
everyone will stay in place at least until the
first of next year," said Gregowski. In order
to diminish the deficit, the new manage
ment is devising a strategy to take care of
neglected structural maintenance and re
vise the rent for the space already allotted
for retail.
In this vein, the barbers are threatened
with the possibility of a rent hike, which
would make their business untenable. Gre
gowski said that Tresidder now charges
some of its tenants uneconomically low
rates, a situation which may change under
the Management Company. "Basically, we

are looking to make the retail in Tresidder
reflect a more realistic market rate," she
said.
Yet the barbers stated that the new $50-
per-sq.-foot rent rate quoted to them would
force their shop out of business. "That's
way too expensive," said Cogliandro. "The
big problem here is that our business is so
seasonal."
He added, "The Shopping Center figure
would not work for our business, where
there's a lot of dead time. And if we can't
work something out, then it's over."
In dealing with Cogliandro and Whit
ford, Stanford Management has been vague
about Stanford Hairstyling's future. "Your
status after Dec. 31, 1994 will be month to
month and if lease termination is consid
ered, you would be notified within a mini
mum of 30 days prior to written notice,"
read the follow-up letter to a preliminary
conversation the barbers had with Gre
gowski concerning their lease status.
Gregowski said that Stanford Manage
ment Company has taken into considera
tion some of the deep-seated history the
barbers represent. "We are working on
marketing ideas which would incorporate
people like Whitford and Cogliandro into
the new plan of generating more traffic
through Tresidder," said Gregowski.
In addition, Gregowski added that the
barbers' importance to the Stanford com
munity will also be taken into account. "In
the end, we want Tresidder to still be a com
munity center for students, faculty and
staff," she said.
70 years of experience
Now, on this July morning, Cogliandro
rises from his swivel chair sets down his
newspaper and approaches a visitor with a
firm handshake and a warm smile. His
partner remains seated.
A heavy-set, gray-bearded man, Coglian
dro has been cutting hair at Stanford for
more than 30 years. Whitford, his partner,
has been a Stanford barber for more than
40 years. But the barber shop which the duo
currently manage predates even Whitford;
its origins go back to 1937.
"We have survived many years of
changes," Whitford said.
These changes began in the early 19305,
when Whitford's two uncles, Roy and Ben
Fowler, left Oklahoma to head west. Set
tling in the Palo Alto area, each ran a barber
shop at Stanford, one in Encina Hall and

the other in Old Union. Years later, Ben
Fowler died in an automobile accident, and
his nephew Whitford took over manage
ment of his Old Union Shop.
The Old Union Shop has since closed and
been replaced by the Tresidder store, which
opened in 1962, the same year as the Union
itself. Now both Whitford and Cogliandro
work in and manage the Tresidder hair
salon.
Like Whitford, Cogliandro was sur
rounded by a family of hair stylists and
learned the barber trade by watching both
his parents continuously cut hair. Unlike
Whitford, who cut hair his whole life,
Cogliandro dabbled with hair-cutting at
Stanford in the '60s before he became a full
time barber in the early '70s.
Cogliandro's formal training was actu
ally in music and education; he received his
bachelor's degree in music and his master's
in education from San Jose State Universi
ty.
However, singing in various jazz groups,
substitute teaching and working at the
Santa Clara Substance Abuse Program pro
duced an undependable and inadequate
salary for a man with a wife and two boys.
Subsequently, he decided to go back to
his old trade. In 1972 he went to Whitford
and negotiated a deal to work at his barber
shop for just a few months. Those few
months turned into a few years, and in 1976
the two men became business partners.
Cogliandro and Whitford are happy with
their career path they chose. "The classic
stories and the interaction with people is
what keeps me interested," Cogliandro
said. "I especially get pleasure from my
grown customers who came to me as
squirming little kids. Now they are bring
ing their jumping babies in diapers back to
the shop to have their hair cut."
Stories and celebrities
In addition to watching customers ma
ture, they also have coifed some of Stan
ford's most notable heads, including past
Stanford presidents such as Wallace Ster
ling, Kenneth Pitzer, Richard Lyman and
Don Kennedy. Pulitzer Prize winners, leg
endary athletes and Cardinal football coach
Bill Walsh are among the luminaries who
have also had their locks shorn by Whitford
and/or Cogliandro.
Wallace Sterling, who came to Coglian
dro for decades, was one of his favorite
clients. "For as big of a person as he was,"

said Cogliandro, "he was completely down
to earth."
As Cogliandro tells it, Sterling loved to
garden. On a regular basis he would put on
grubby clothes and fiddle around the yard
of the Hoover mansion. One time, when he
was working in the yard, a car full of Stan
ford students pulled up and asked Sterling
if the president was in. "No, he's not here
right now," said Sterling. The students
asked if they could peek in the open front
door and take a few pictures.
"Would Sterling mind if we run in
quickly?" asked the students.
"Not at all," replied Sterling. "I'll be
sure not to tell him."
Whitford particularly recalls the Viet
nam war years at Stanford. During that
time, he religiously cut President Pitzer's
hair. "Pitzer would come in to have his hair
cut," Whitford said, "and protesters would
corner him right there in the barber's chair.
He would get all flustered and just could not
handle it."
Recent Stanford alumnus Steve Olsen,
who had his hair cut many times at Stan
ford Hair Styling, is excited about the pro
posed face-lift of Tresidder. "I think
changes need to be made," said Olsen,
"but I would hate to see those barbers
leave. They are part of the Stanford cam
pus."
Rosamond Bacon, 86, a Stanford alu
mus who graduated in 1930, is more emo
tional about the possibility of change.
Bacon, who still resides on campus, has
spent most of her life at the University with
her husband Harold Bacon, a mathematics
professor.
"Until he died two years ago," Bacon
said, "my husband had his hair cut by Whit
ford and Cogliandro forever. When Harold
was sick, these wonderful men even made
house calls." The barbers make a few trips
per month to Stanford Hospital to cut pa
tients' hair as well.
"Seems as though the barber shop has
been there for quite a while. Those men
have devoted themselves to Stanford and it
would be an awful shame to watch them
move out," Bacon said.
Despite the ambiguous outlook for Whit
ford and Cogliandro, these old-fashioned
barbers remain optimistic and level-head
ed. "Everything happens for a reason, and
there is no sense trying to control some
thing you have no control over," Cogliandro
said.

munity center for students, faculty and
staff," she said.
70 years of experience
Now, on this July morning, Cogliandro
rises from his swivel chair sets down his
newspaper and approaches a visitor with a
firm handshake and a warm smile. His
partner remains seated.
A heavy-set, gray-bearded man, Coglian
dro has been cutting hair at Stanford for
more than 30 years. Whitford, his partner,
has been a Stanford barber for more than
40 years. But the barber shop which the duo
currently manage predates even Whitford;
its origins go back to 1937.
"We have survived many years of
changes," Whitford said.
These changes began in the early 19305,
when Whitford's two uncles, Roy and Ben
Fowler, left Oklahoma to head west. Set
tling in the Palo Alto area, each ran a barber
shop at Stanford, one in Encina Hall and

the other in Old Union. Years later, Ben
Fowler died in an automobile accident, and
his nephew Whitford took over manage
ment of his Old Union Shop.
The Old Union Shop has since closed and
been replaced by the Tresidder store, which
opened in 1962, the same year as the Union
itself. Now both Whitford and Cogliandro
work in and manage the Tresidder hair
salon.
Like Whitford, Cogliandro was sur
rounded by a family of hair stylists and
learned the barber trade by watching both
his parents continuously cut hair. Unlike
Whitford, who cut hair his whole life,
Cogliandro dabbled with hair-cutting at
Stanford in the '60s before he became a full
time barber in the early '70s.
Cogliandro's formal training was actu
ally in music and education; he received his
bachelor's degree in music and his master's
in education from San Jose State Universi
ty.
However, singing in various jazz groups,
substitute teaching and working at the
Santa Clara Substance Abuse Program pro
duced an undependable and inadequate
salary for a man with a wife and two boys.
Subsequently, he decided to go back to
his old trade. In 1972 he went to Whitford
and negotiated a deal to work at his barber
shop for just a few months. Those few
months turned into a few years, and in 1976
the two men became business partners.
Cogliandro and Whitford are happy with
their career path they chose. "The classic
stories and the interaction with people is
what keeps me interested," Cogliandro
said. "I especially get pleasure from my
grown customers who came to me as
squirming little kids. Now they are bring
ing their jumping babies in diapers back to
the shop to have their hair cut."
Stories and celebrities
In addition to watching customers ma
ture, they also have coifed some of Stan
ford's most notable heads, including past
Stanford presidents such as Wallace Ster
ling, Kenneth Pitzer, Richard Lyman and
Don Kennedy. Pulitzer Prize winners, leg
endary athletes and Cardinal football coach
Bill Walsh are among the luminaries who
have also had their locks shorn by Whitford
and/or Cogliandro.
Wallace Sterling, who came to Coglian
dro for decades, was one of his favorite
clients. "For as big of a person as he was,"

said Cogliandro, "he was completely down
to earth."
As Cogliandro tells it, Sterling loved to
garden. On a regular basis he would put on
grubby clothes and fiddle around the yard
of the Hoover mansion. One time, when he
was working in the yard, a car full of Stan
ford students pulled up and asked Sterling
if the president was in. "No, he's not here
right now," said Sterling. The students
asked if they could peek in the open front
door and take a few pictures.
"Would Sterling mind if we run in
quickly?" asked the students.
"Not at all," replied Sterling. "I'll be
sure not to tell him."
Whitford particularly recalls the Viet
nam war years at Stanford. During that
time, he religiously cut President Pitzer's
hair. "Pitzer would come in to have his hair
cut," Whitford said, "and protesters would
corner him right there in the barber's chair.
He would get all flustered and just could not
handle it."
Recent Stanford alumnus Steve Olsen,
who had his hair cut many times at Stan
ford Hair Styling, is excited about the pro
posed face-lift of Tresidder. "I think
changes need to be made," said Olsen,
"but I would hate to see those barbers
leave. They are part of the Stanford cam
pus."
Rosamond Bacon, 86, a Stanford alu
mus who graduated in 1930, is more emo
tional about the possibility of change.
Bacon, who still resides on campus, has
spent most of her life at the University with
her husband Harold Bacon, a mathematics
professor.
"Until he died two years ago," Bacon
said, "my husband had his hair cut by Whit
ford and Cogliandro forever. When Harold
was sick, these wonderful men even made
house calls." The barbers make a few trips
per month to Stanford Hospital to cut pa
tients' hair as well.
"Seems as though the barber shop has
been there for quite a while. Those men
have devoted themselves to Stanford and it
would be an awful shame to watch them
move out," Bacon said.
Despite the ambiguous outlook for Whit
ford and Cogliandro, these old-fashioned
barbers remain optimistic and level-head
ed. "Everything happens for a reason, and
there is no sense trying to control some
thing you have no control over," Cogliandro
said.


Janar Stewart — Daily
It's around 10 a.m. on a Wednesday in
late July. Not a trace of hair is visible on
the shiny linoleum floor, no music plays
in the background and all but two of the
swivel chairs are empty.
Though it is always quiet during sum
mer session at Stanford University, this
year the Stanford Hair Styling salon in
Tresidder Union seems uncomfortably de
serted.
Seated in the two chairs are Carmelo
Cogliandro and Newell Whitford, the sa
lons' proprietors. For a combined total of
more than 70 years, this gray-haired pair
has been trimming the locks of Stanford
students, faculty and staff from their nook
between the Coffee House and the cafe.
However, Cogliandro and Whitford's es
tablished business and their collective, col
orful history is now threatened. Recent
shake-ups in the management of Tresidder
Union have left their future of their salon in
doubt. And while the pair have survived
similar scares in the past, the recent
changes may finally spell the end to yet an
other Stanford tradition.
Future uncertain
The most recent scare began in June,
when it was announced that the Stanford
Management Company — which runs the
Stanford Shopping Center and manages
the University's endowment — would take
over management of Tresidder Union in
the hopes of making it more profitable.
"Currently, the University is subsidiz
ing Tresidder Union in the amount of
$700,000," said Dorthea Gregowski, assis
tant director of the Stanford Shopping Cen
ter. "Our goal is to make the area viable to
break even in three years and then start
making revenue."
Regarding the current tenants of Tresid
der, "No final decisions have been made and
everyone will stay in place at least until the
first of next year," said Gregowski. In order
to diminish the deficit, the new manage
ment is devising a strategy to take care of
neglected structural maintenance and re
vise the rent for the space already allotted
for retail.
In this vein, the barbers are threatened
with the possibility of a rent hike, which
would make their business untenable. Gre
gowski said that Tresidder now charges
some of its tenants uneconomically low
rates, a situation which may change under
the Management Company. "Basically, we

are looking to make the retail in Tresidder
reflect a more realistic market rate," she
said.
Yet the barbers stated that the new $50-
per-sq.-foot rent rate quoted to them would
force their shop out of business. "That's
way too expensive," said Cogliandro. "The
big problem here is that our business is so
seasonal."
He added, "The Shopping Center figure
would not work for our business, where
there's a lot of dead time. And if we can't
work something out, then it's over."
In dealing with Cogliandro and Whit
ford, Stanford Management has been vague
about Stanford Hairstyling's future. "Your
status after Dec. 31, 1994 will be month to
month and if lease termination is consid
ered, you would be notified within a mini
mum of 30 days prior to written notice,"
read the follow-up letter to a preliminary
conversation the barbers had with Gre
gowski concerning their lease status.
Gregowski said that Stanford Manage
ment Company has taken into considera
tion some of the deep-seated history the
barbers represent. "We are working on
marketing ideas which would incorporate
people like Whitford and Cogliandro into
the new plan of generating more traffic
through Tresidder," said Gregowski.
In addition, Gregowski added that the
barbers' importance to the Stanford com
munity will also be taken into account. "In
the end, we want Tresidder to still be a com
munity center for students, faculty and
staff," she said.

asked if they could peek in the open front
door and take a few pictures.
"Would Sterling mind if we run in
quickly?" asked the students.
"Not at all," replied Sterling. "I'll be
sure not to tell him."
Whitford particularly recalls the Viet
nam war years at Stanford. During that
time, he religiously cut President Pitzer's
hair. "Pitzer would come in to have his hair
cut," Whitford said, "and protesters would
corner him right there in the barber's chair.
He would get all flustered and just could not
handle it."
Recent Stanford alumnus Steve Olsen,
who had his hair cut many times at Stan
ford Hair Styling, is excited about the pro
posed face-lift of Tresidder. "I think
changes need to be made," said Olsen,
"but I would hate to see those barbers
leave. They are part of the Stanford cam
pus."
Rosamond Bacon, 86, a Stanford alu
mus who graduated in 1930, is more emo
tional about the possibility of change.
Bacon, who still resides on campus, has
spent most of her life at the University with
her husband Harold Bacon, a mathematics
professor.
"Until he died two years ago," Bacon
said, "my husband had his hair cut by Whit
ford and Cogliandro forever. When Harold
was sick, these wonderful men even made
house calls." The barbers make a few trips
per month to Stanford Hospital to cut pa
tients' hair as well.
"Seems as though the barber shop has
been there for quite a while. Those men
have devoted themselves to Stanford and it
would be an awful shame to watch them
move out," Bacon said.
Despite the ambiguous outlook for Whit
ford and Cogliandro, these old-fashioned
barbers remain optimistic and level-head
ed. "Everything happens for a reason, and
there is no sense trying to control some
thing you have no control over," Cogliandro
said.
