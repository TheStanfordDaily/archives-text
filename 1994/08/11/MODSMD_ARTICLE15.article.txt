## Blinding them with Science New environmental education program at Stanford sparks more than a few brainstorms 
### Justin Pollard Staff writer 
A select few of tomorrow's
leading environmental profes
sionals got a head start on their
dreams this summer thanks to an
innovative new program at Stan
ford jointly sponsored by the Law
School and the Program in
Human Biology.
The Stanford Youth Environ
mental Science Program
(SYESP), was a five-week resi
dential summer camp dedicated
to teaching gifted and underprivi
leged California high-school stu
dents about environmental is
sues, exposing them to career op
portunities in the environmental
field and preparing them for col
lege. Applicants were screened for
academic excellence, enthusiasm
and financial need and, once ad
mitted, attended the program
free of charge.
The central curriculum of the
program consisted of lectures
from former Environmental Pro
tection Agency chief William Reil
ly, Biology Profs. Donald
Kennedy and Hal Mooney, Law
Prof. Buzz Thompson and more
than 20 other leading experts
from Stanford in the fields of en
vironmental science, law and pol
icy. The range of topics was broad
enough to give the students a
solid background in the diverse
field of environmental studies
and appeal to each student's par
ticular area of interest, said
SYESP co-director Ana Rowena
Mallari.
Before arriving at SYESP, the
participants were required to
read a number of articles on envi
ronmental topics to prepare them
for the program. In addition,
prior to each lecture, the students
read preparatory materials, at
tended a tutorial and participated
in a group discussion.
This preparation was "neces
sary to take advantage of the
quality instruction," according to
Michael McCullough, Mallari's
fellow co-director of SYESP. The

students were then primed with
questions for the group discus
sions which followed the lectures.
Kennedy, former president of
Stanford University, gave a lec
ture on lead and the inadequate
government regulations regard
ing this toxic substance which al
lowed it to become one of the envi
ronmental risks found predomi
nately in lower-income and mi
nority communities.
"I can't recall ever having got
ten better or more interesting
questions" than the ones asked of
him after the lecture, Kennedy
said. He added that the program's
"first summer was a terrific suc
cess. I am full of admiration for
the job Rowena and Michael did."
Community outreach
Another important part of the
program was the group projects
which the students worked on to
gether. Depending on their acade
mic and professional interests,
students were assigned to one of
four groups—environmental jus
tice, environmental health, envi
ronmental education or environ
mental engineering.
"The group projects were a ve
hicle to develop materials to bring
back to the students' communi
ties," Mallari said.
She added that she wanted to
tailor the projects to the needs of
the students' communities,
which in most cases were lower
income and minority neighbor
hoods. The environmental health
group, for example, focused on
health problems associated with
pesticides, and the environmental
education group developed infor
mational materials in both Eng
lish and Spanish.
The program places a strong
emphasis on outreach, especially
after its completion. "We want to
expand the impact of the program
beyond the 20 students" who par
ticipated in it, Mallari said. One
way to achieve this goal will be for
the students to distribute the ed
ucational materials they devel
oped in their communities and

local schools. Some will even give
lectures on environmental topics.
"I don't think that people are
very aware" of the gravity of envi
ronmental problems, said Jose
Gonzalez, a student from San
Jose.
"They keep throwing garbage
in the streets, and using CFCs.
They are not aware of the costs if
the rainforests are destroyed. I
think education is the key to solve
those problems," he added.
Mallari said that many of the
graduates of SYESP will also be
founding environmental groups in
their high schools. Alicia Skuce, a
participant from Napa Valley who
started an environmental club in
her high school with her sister,
single-handedly ran a workshop
for the other students on how to
start environmental clubs.
Mallari added that some of the
students are planning to organize
youth environmental summits,
and since many of them live close
to each other they will continue to
meet and work together in the fu
ture.
Innovative aspects
In addition to learning about en
vironmental issues, students took
classes in public speaking and
SAT preparation and received the
support of college guidance coun
selors and assistance on college
applications. Learning public
speaking skills in particular was a
very effective way of boosting stu
dents' confidence in themselves
and their abilities, Mallari said.
To allow students to get all of
their work done without imposing
too rigid a structure, the program
also allocated "academic free
time" during the day. During this
period students were permitted to
work on whatever area they de
sired so long as it was of an acade
mic nature.
Another innovative compo
nent of SYESP was the time set
aside for reflection and personal
growth. During this time, stu
dents thought about their future
images of themselves, prayed or

meditated if they wished, and fo
cused on learning about their
thoughts and feelings, according
to McCullough.
One student, Houston Ngo,
said reflection time was his fa
vorite part of the program.
"Reflection time is when I
meditate, center, and know my
self. To know not only the world
outside you but the world inside
you as well — it builds confi
dence," said Ngo, who will be a se
nior at Oakland High School.
One reason that SYESP was
such a tremendous success was
the impressive qualifications of
the co-directors.
Mallari, a graduating senior,
both runs SYESP and works full
time at the Environmental De
fense Fund in Oakland in the
Rural Economy and Environ
ment Program as a scientist on
fisheries and land-use issues.
McCullough is a 1989 graduate
of Stanford and was a Rhodes Sch
olar. He is currently a third-year
medical student at UCSF and
plans to become an academic emer
gency room physician. McCullough
said that he decided to found the
program after seeing the success of
a similar program he started in
1988, the Stanford Youth Medical
Sciences Program (SMYSP).
"I had just helped a student
(from SMYSP] successfully apply
to Harvard Medical School," said
McCullough. "It is really neat to
have that kind of interaction with
a student."
Although SYESP has only
completed its first year, McCul
lough said "I have never had a
program run so well before." He
added "having higher expecta
tions of the students, they tend to
rise to the occasion."
Foundations for success
McCullough said he attributes
the success of the program to the
strong sponsorship of the Law
School and the Program in
Human Biology, and in particular
the support of Frank Brucato and
Dr. Ellen Porzig. He added that

he is also very grateful for the fi
nancial support of the Irvine
Foundation, The Peninsula Com
munity Foundation, the Roberts
Foundation, the San Francisco
Foundation, and the Atkinson
Foundation.
But others say that the pro
gram's success is primarily the re
sult of its co-directors' efforts.
"I've got to give all the credit to
Michael and Rowena for their cre
ativity," said Brucato, associate
dean for administration at the
Law School, who also handled
much of the administration for
SYESP. "[SYESP] looks like its
been fabulous. The quality from
the start was really impressive."
Porzig, associate professor in
human biology, served as the aca
demic advisor for SYESP. Porzig
said that one of the greatest suc
cesses of the program was the
"tremendous enthusiasm of the
students. They are so idealistic
and exuberant, and they just grew
so much."
"I am delighted by the faculty
participation," Porzig said, who
also gave two lectures to the stu
dents — on vertebrate species
and on biodiversity with a focus
on extinction.
Brucato and Porzig said the
Law School and the Human Biol
ogy Program are both planning
on continuing to sponsor SYESP
in the future.
"I have every intent of estab
lishing this as a permanent pro
gram," said McCullough, "and
with such strong support from
the Stanford community I am
confident we will be able to suc
ceed."
At the graduation ceremony on
Sunday, Skuce eloquently de
scribed the far-reaching impact of
the program. "Today SYESP will
end, but it will never die. It will
live on forever in each of the stu
dent's lives. We must take these
skills back to our communities.
We will go back to our communi
ties and we will take action. We
will go out into the world and we
will make a difference."
