## Ex-Cardinal hurler Lorraine hits the show 
### Rob Ross Senior staff writer 
Andrew Lorraine has had a
tough two weeks. The 21-year
old southpaw got called up by the
California Angels in mid-July,
capping a blazing journey
through the minor leagues. But
the show didn't treat him too
well.
The Stanford graduate
climbed up his first major-league
mound against Baltimore in a
mop-up role with the Angels
down 5-0. Jeff Tackett, the Ori
oles backup catcher, greeted Lor
raine with a single up the middle.
Tackett's teammates were not
any nicer to Lorraine in his
debut, which in retrospect was
more of a mess-up rather than
mop-up performance. The end
result was a lackluster three-in
ning, four-run outing.
Lorraine doesn't look back on
this first attempt at brazing
major league hitting as a com
plete failure. "They got some
cheap hits. I still came out feeling
pretty good," he said.
Lorraine saves the disparag
ing remarks for his second ap
pearance — his first start. Fac
ing the powerful lineup of the
American League East-leading
New York Yankees, Stanford's
best starter of 1993 served up
three pitches that ended up in
the cheap seats en route to spot
ting the Yanks to seven runs in a
mere 4 and 2/3 innings worked.
"I made bad pitches. I was
pitching kind of scared," Lor
raine said. "I was pitching poor
ly, and that was magnified by the
better hitters [in the major
leagues]. I would have gotten hit
even if I had been pitching in
Vancouver (where he played his
Triple-A ball)."
Lorraine has played his best
professional baseball in Vancou
ver. In the 1993 amateur draft,

Lorraine was selected in the
fourth round by the Angels. The
junior had just completed a sea
son as the Cardinal's most reli
able starter for the 27-28 squad.
He led the team in wins, com
plete games and innings pitched
and was selected to the All-Six
Pac Team with his 4.15 earned
run average.
After a two-month negotiat
ing period, Lorraine signed and
competed in a short-season with
California's Single A outpost in
Boise, Id. Then it was off to Cara
cas, Venezuela, to play winter
ball. Lorraine returned to Palo
Alto to finish up his degree after
some South American success
and then jetted to Angels' train
ing camp after a quarter.
A superb training camp sent
Lorraine to Triple-A Vancouver,
where he starred. Establishing a
9-3 record with team-leading
numbers in ERA (3.24), innings
pitched (116) and strikeouts
(71), he anchored the staff. The
Angels, with their sub-.500
record, soon came calling.
Lorraine responded soberly.
"After the initial 'Great, I'm
going!' it was 'Now what am I
going to do?' " he said. "It's not
just a happy-to-be-here thing.
I'm now working on staying here
[in the majors]."
This left-handed, fastball
curveball pitcher does not see
much of a difference in his pitch
ing over the past year, a year that
saw him progress from facing the
USC Trojans to the Texas
Rangers.
"I'm not vastly improved," he
said. "I'm throwing more strikes
now but that's about it. Playing
in the competition of the Six-Pac
for three years really gives you a
leg up.
"It's that next step that every
one does differently. With me, I
just keep working hard."
This hard work took him to

Anaheim stadium, where the
Southern California native has
been able to pitch in front of his
home town fans. But it is not who
he is pitching in front of, but who
he is pitching to that matters.
For any 21-year-old, playing
with and against idols can dis
turb one's normal routine. Ac
cording to Lorraine, the key is to
forget about who the batter is
and do what got him there.
"Nothing's going through my
head," he said. "You do the same
thing. You got someplace be
cause you did something well.
Why should you change that be
cause you recognize a name?"
Lorraine may have gained
some dubious name recognition
in his second start, against the
Texas Rangers. He is now the an
swer to the trivia question,
"What pitcher got the loss in
Kenny Rogers' 1994 perfect
game?"
That's right, Lorraine pitched
into the seventh-inning and al
lowed only four runs on Friday,
July 29, yet still got saddled with
the loss in his best major league
start yet. And, in answer to the
question that reporters have
peppered him with since that
night: "No, I can honestly say
that there is no part of me that
wanted him to get the perfect
game," he said. "I'm too compet
itive for that."
Lorraine's last start was last
Saturday against Chicago. The
White Sox ate him alive, tallying
seven runs in his four-inning
stint, raising his ERA to an as
tronomical 10.61.
But don't feel bad for the
newest member of the Angels'
starting rotation. He is getting
paid to do what he loves to do at
its highest level.
"The key is to be patient and
learn from my mistakes," he
said. "As long as I keep going out
there and learning, I'll be okay."

numbers in ERA (3.24), innings
pitched (116) and strikeouts
(71), he anchored the staff. The
Angels, with their sub-.500
record, soon came calling.
Lorraine responded soberly.
"After the initial 'Great, I'm
going!' it was 'Now what am I
going to do?' " he said. "It's not
just a happy-to-be-here thing.
I'm now working on staying here
[in the majors]."
This left-handed, fastball
curveball pitcher does not see
much of a difference in his pitch
ing over the past year, a year that
saw him progress from facing the
USC Trojans to the Texas
Rangers.
"I'm not vastly improved," he
said. "I'm throwing more strikes
now but that's about it. Playing
in the competition of the Six-Pac
for three years really gives you a
leg up.
"It's that next step that every
one does differently. With me, I
just keep working hard."
This hard work took him to

Anaheim stadium, where the
Southern California native has
been able to pitch in front of his
home town fans. But it is not who
he is pitching in front of, but who
he is pitching to that matters.
For any 21-year-old, playing
with and against idols can dis
turb one's normal routine. Ac
cording to Lorraine, the key is to
forget about who the batter is
and do what got him there.
"Nothing's going through my
head," he said. "You do the same
thing. You got someplace be
cause you did something well.
Why should you change that be
cause you recognize a name?"
Lorraine may have gained
some dubious name recognition
in his second start, against the
Texas Rangers. He is now the an
swer to the trivia question,
"What pitcher got the loss in
Kenny Rogers' 1994 perfect
game?"
That's right, Lorraine pitched
into the seventh-inning and al
lowed only four runs on Friday,
July 29, yet still got saddled with
the loss in his best major league
start yet. And, in answer to the
question that reporters have
peppered him with since that
night: "No, I can honestly say
that there is no part of me that
wanted him to get the perfect
game," he said. "I'm too compet
itive for that."
Lorraine's last start was last
Saturday against Chicago. The
White Sox ate him alive, tallying
seven runs in his four-inning
stint, raising his ERA to an as
tronomical 10.61.
But don't feel bad for the
newest member of the Angels'
starting rotation. He is getting
paid to do what he loves to do at
its highest level.
"The key is to be patient and
learn from my mistakes," he
said. "As long as I keep going out
there and learning, I'll be okay."

Lefty Andrew Lorraine hopes to stay afloat with the Angels.The for
mer Stanford pitcher has struggled during his brief time in the bigs.
Andrew Lorraine has had a
tough two weeks. The 21-year
old southpaw got called up by the
California Angels in mid-July,
capping a blazing journey
through the minor leagues. But
the show didn't treat him too
well.
The Stanford graduate
climbed up his first major-league
mound against Baltimore in a
mop-up role with the Angels
down 5-0. Jeff Tackett, the Ori
oles backup catcher, greeted Lor
raine with a single up the middle.
Tackett's teammates were not
any nicer to Lorraine in his
debut, which in retrospect was
more of a mess-up rather than
mop-up performance. The end
result was a lackluster three-in
ning, four-run outing.
Lorraine doesn't look back on
this first attempt at brazing
major league hitting as a com
plete failure. "They got some
cheap hits. I still came out feeling
pretty good," he said.
Lorraine saves the disparag
ing remarks for his second ap
pearance — his first start. Fac
ing the powerful lineup of the
American League East-leading
New York Yankees, Stanford's
best starter of 1993 served up
three pitches that ended up in
the cheap seats en route to spot
ting the Yanks to seven runs in a
mere 4 and 2/3 innings worked.
"I made bad pitches. I was
pitching kind of scared," Lor
raine said. "I was pitching poor
ly, and that was magnified by the
better hitters [in the major
leagues]. I would have gotten hit
even if I had been pitching in
Vancouver (where he played his
Triple-A ball)."
Lorraine has played his best
professional baseball in Vancou
ver. In the 1993 amateur draft,

Lorraine was selected in the
fourth round by the Angels. The
junior had just completed a sea
son as the Cardinal's most reli
able starter for the 27-28 squad.
He led the team in wins, com
plete games and innings pitched
and was selected to the All-Six
Pac Team with his 4.15 earned
run average.
After a two-month negotiat
ing period, Lorraine signed and
competed in a short-season with
California's Single A outpost in
Boise, Id. Then it was off to Cara
cas, Venezuela, to play winter
ball. Lorraine returned to Palo
Alto to finish up his degree after
some South American success
and then jetted to Angels' train
ing camp after a quarter.
A superb training camp sent
Lorraine to Triple-A Vancouver,
where he starred. Establishing a
9-3 record with team-leading
numbers in ERA (3.24), innings
pitched (116) and strikeouts
(71), he anchored the staff. The
Angels, with their sub-.500
record, soon came calling.
Lorraine responded soberly.
"After the initial 'Great, I'm
