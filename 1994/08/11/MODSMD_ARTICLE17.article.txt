# McCaffrey: did time in N.Y., now back in Bay Area
## Former Stanford wide receiver leaves the Giants, catches on with the San Francisco 49ers 
### Jordan Wruble Editorial staff 
Ed McCaffrey has escaped from New
York. The lanky wide receiver and 1991
Stanford graduate recently signed with
the 49ers as a free agent, and is now safe
ly, comfortably ensconced in the Bay
Area.
Originally drafted by the New York Gi
ants in 1991, McCaffrey languished on a
team which emphasized the running
game at the expense of the passing attack.
In his three years as a Giant, he was given
little opportunity to demonstrate the
ability that led the Giants to make him a
third-round draft choice. And he was in
New York.
But when the Giants let McCaffrey be
come a free agent after last season, he set
his sights on San Francisco. According to
McCaffrey, the differences between play
ing football in the Bay Area and the Big
Apple are numerous. The best change, in
the opinion of the newest 49er, may sim
ply be the location.
"I love it out here, I love the area. It's a
much different atmosphere than New
York," said McCaffrey.
Although a number of other teams
were interested in obtaining his services,
McCaffrey said he joined the 49ers in part
because of his fondness for the Bay Area
itself.
However, there were other reasons for
the switch. McCaffrey said that the 49ers'
wide-open passing attack offers him an
expanded chance to participate in the of
fense. He said, "As a receiver, the 49ers'
system is a lot more fun than the Giants'.
The Giants were very conservative; it was
always run first, pass second."
The Giants used a lot of three-tight
end formations to support their running
game and McCaffrey rarely played except
on third downs.
In San Francisco, McCaffrey, a big tar

get and classic "possession" receiver, will
be used in their multiple-wide-receiver
formations.
While McCaffrey lacks tremendous
speed, he can utilize his good route-run
ning ability and sure hands in the 49ers'
pass-oriented offense.
McCaffrey likens the offensive scheme
to the approach he learned at Stanford,
saying, "I like their system of X's and O's;
it's something I did at Stanford under
Dennis Green."
Although it helped that he played in a
similar offense during his Cardinal days,
his background brings an added pressure.
"Just hearing the name 'Stanford,' peo
ple think you'll pick things up quick. But
picking up a new system is always diffi
cult."
Fortunately, McCaffrey has a chance
to learn from some of the best receivers in
the business. Jerry Rice, John Taylor and
especially Nate Singleton, with whom
McCaffrey played in New York, are all
helping him learn the complex 49er of
fense.
To succeed in San Francisco, a receiver
must demonstrate his ability to read the
defense and adjust his pass pattern ac
cordingly. McCaffrey cultivated this skill
at Stanford.
"Under Dennis Green, we ran a pro
style offense," he said. "Under that system,
wide receivers can change their routes,
make pro-style adjustments."
Making just such a play, McCaffrey
broke wide open to score the 49ers' only
touchdown in their first exhibition game
against the Arizona Cardinals.
Joining the 49ers also offers McCaf
frey the chance to win a championship.
Already a very talented team, San Fran
cisco spent the off-season investing in ex
perienced and high-priced veteran free
agents.
Playing down the 49ers' chances, Mc-
Caffrey threw out some classic cliches,

saying, "We'll take things one game at a
time. If everyone's healthy and playing
the way they're capable of playing, of
course winning the Superbowl is a possi
bility."
McCaffrey brings his wife, whom he
married two years ago, and two-month
old son to California.

He has off-the-field goals for the fu
ture, too, and will take the LSAT within
the year.
"I definitely plan on attending law
school," he said. In doing so, McCaffrey
would follow the path of 49er teammates
Steve Young and Bart Oates, who have al
ready received their law degrees.
