## Cinema burlesque Not even the closing of the Varsity Theater can keep the Peninsula cast of "The Rocky Horror Picture Show" from time-warping 
### Victor Haseman 
On Tuesday July 5, 1994, just one day
before downtown Palo Alto's Varsity The
atre closed its doors to the public forever,
the theater's owner, Charles Keenan re
ceived a piece of the collective mind of the
town's residents at a fdled to capacity city
council meeting. And it wasn't to thank him
for bringing the chain bookstore Borders
Books, Inc. to Palo Alto either.

Rather it was an
attack on the local
businessman's per
sonal character dis
guised as a series of
arguments con
structed to block his
efforts to close the
theater. But call him
a "panhandler," a
"money obsessed de
veloper" (he report
edly struck the deal
with Borders be
cause Landmark
Theaters, the movie
house chain that
managed the the
ater, weren't gener
ating him the kind of
annual revenues
that he would have
liked), whatever. His
mind won't be
changed. Still that
doesn't keep the
myriad reasons for
saving the theater or
the variety of Palo
Altans who were
pushing them from
being interesting.
Imagine, if you
can, what the city
council chamber
must have looked
like, around 11 p.m.
when maybe half of
the long line of objec
tors had been given
the floor to voice
there discontent with
Keenan's develop-

ment plan. Somewhere in between the
three or for small bookstore owners
protesting the arrival of a big chain, the
seven landmark preservationists, and the
smattering of characters who just can't
seem to bring themselves to frequent down
town Palo Alto because of the hustle, bustle
and crowds and congestion created one 10

too many name brand establishments, I like
to imagine that a small and dedicated group
of outlandishly dressed individuals boda
ciously voiced their discontent with a few
impromptu lipsynchs of tunes from"The
Rocky Horror Picture Show."
After all, the Varisty was the home
away-from-home of the Peninsula's best
known "Rocky" troop, before they — along

with Landmark, fans and good movies —
were given the boot. But alas, its unlikely
that any of the arguments for halting the
renovations to the Varsity that warm Tues
day evening did much more than mention
the displaced show or the troupe of volun
teer actors and other theater staff that
have dedicated their Saturdays to the

preservation of the 19 year old film— for
over eight years— about a couple of ail-
American, blue bloods who take a wrong
turn one rainy night on the way to a favorite
teachers house, only to endup the play
things for a demented, bisexual alien scien
tist.
Chris Marshall, a veteran of the cast, re
membered that he and his compatriots

were involved "in a limited way. The cast
had pretty strong feelings about it, but
there wasn't a whole lot we could do." Many
participated in the obligatory passing
around of "Save the Varsity Theatre" peti
tions with little effect. But the actual deci
sion to close the theater ultimately by
passed them in the planning stages.

But not to worry. A stroke of good luck
landed the cast, the Landmark-owned print
of the film, even the crowds drawn to the
hands on cine-drama experience, in a new
home not more than a few blocks away at
another Landmark Theater the Aquarius.
The shows new home is almost what Dr.
Frank-N-Furter (the alien scientist re
ferred to earlier) would order, except for

one thing — a smaller
theater and an even
tinier stage.
But even this is an
obstacle that the 30
odd members of the
cast have seemed to
handle with skill. In
stead of relying on the
Aquarius as its soul
venue, they have in
stead contracted-out
to a second peninsula
theater, the Belmont
Arts. Boasting a prop
er stage in front of its
silver screen, the Bel
mont venue — which
had its premiere run
last Saturday — will
host the cast on Sat
urdays, while the
Aquarius will host
what Marshall refers
to as "get to know the
audience" shows on
Fridays, both at Mid
night.
And getting to
know the audience is
exactly what's been
happening over the
last couple of weeks
...at least in Palo Alto.
In preparation
for the premier of
the "Rocky" at the
Aquarius, house
manager Aaron
Brown has been pre
viewing the show
Friday nights in

preparation for the
theater's first performance slated for to
morrow at midnight. And while it's not
expected that the cast or film will attract
the same kinds of audiences that it used
to over at the Varsity, at least for now, we
can all rest assured that — at least for the
time being — we can still find a timewarp
in Palo Alto.

guised as a series of
arguments con
structed to block his
efforts to close the
theater. But call him
a "panhandler," a
"money obsessed de
veloper" (he report
edly struck the deal
with Borders be
cause Landmark
Theaters, the movie
house chain that
managed the the
ater, weren't gener
ating him the kind of
annual revenues
that he would have
liked), whatever. His
mind won't be
changed. Still that
doesn't keep the
myriad reasons for
saving the theater or
the variety of Palo
Altans who were
pushing them from
being interesting.
Imagine, if you
can, what the city
council chamber
must have looked
like, around 11 p.m.
when maybe half of
the long line of objec
tors had been given
the floor to voice
there discontent with
Keenan's develop-

ment plan. Somewhere in between the
three or for small bookstore owners
protesting the arrival of a big chain, the
seven landmark preservationists, and the
smattering of characters who just can't
seem to bring themselves to frequent down
town Palo Alto because of the hustle, bustle
and crowds and congestion created one 10

too many name brand establishments, I like
to imagine that a small and dedicated group
of outlandishly dressed individuals boda
ciously voiced their discontent with a few
impromptu lipsynchs of tunes from"The
Rocky Horror Picture Show."
After all, the Varisty was the home
away-from-home of the Peninsula's best
known "Rocky" troop, before they — along

with Landmark, fans and good movies —
were given the boot. But alas, its unlikely
that any of the arguments for halting the
renovations to the Varsity that warm Tues
day evening did much more than mention
the displaced show or the troupe of volun
teer actors and other theater staff that
have dedicated their Saturdays to the

preservation of the 19 year old film— for
over eight years— about a couple of ail-
American, blue bloods who take a wrong
turn one rainy night on the way to a favorite
teachers house, only to endup the play
things for a demented, bisexual alien scien
tist.
Chris Marshall, a veteran of the cast, re
membered that he and his compatriots

were involved "in a limited way. The cast
had pretty strong feelings about it, but
there wasn't a whole lot we could do." Many
participated in the obligatory passing
around of "Save the Varsity Theatre" peti
tions with little effect. But the actual deci
sion to close the theater ultimately by
passed them in the planning stages.

But not to worry. A stroke of good luck
landed the cast, the Landmark-owned print
of the film, even the crowds drawn to the
hands on cine-drama experience, in a new
home not more than a few blocks away at
another Landmark Theater the Aquarius.
The shows new home is almost what Dr.
Frank-N-Furter (the alien scientist re
ferred to earlier) would order, except for

one thing — a smaller
theater and an even
tinier stage.
But even this is an
obstacle that the 30
odd members of the
cast have seemed to
handle with skill. In
stead of relying on the
Aquarius as its soul
venue, they have in
stead contracted-out
to a second peninsula
theater, the Belmont
Arts. Boasting a prop
er stage in front of its
silver screen, the Bel
mont venue — which
had its premiere run
last Saturday — will
host the cast on Sat
urdays, while the
Aquarius will host
what Marshall refers
to as "get to know the
audience" shows on
Fridays, both at Mid
night.
And getting to
know the audience is
exactly what's been
happening over the
last couple of weeks
...at least in Palo Alto.
In preparation
for the premier of
the "Rocky" at the
Aquarius, house
manager Aaron
Brown has been pre
viewing the show
Friday nights in

preparation for the
theater's first performance slated for to
morrow at midnight. And while it's not
expected that the cast or film will attract
the same kinds of audiences that it used
to over at the Varsity, at least for now, we
can all rest assured that — at least for the
time being — we can still find a timewarp
in Palo Alto.
