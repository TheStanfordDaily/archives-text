## Airheads 
### 
I was beginning to wonder what I
had done to deserve the fate of having
to review "Airheads." With each new
preview and commercial, I wondered if
I had already seen all the high points
the movie had to offer, and those high
points seemed somewhat dubious at
best. But while the prospect of sitting
through a couple hours of sophomoric
humor seemed daunting, "Airheads"
turned out — surprisingly — to be just
the thing after a long day's work.
Chazz (Brendan Fraser) is a strug
gling musician mooching off his girl
friend, Kayla (Amy Locane). His goal
in life is a recording contract for his
band, the Lone Rangers, but things
aren't going very well: he keeps get
ting rejected for a contract, and his
girlfriend throws him out. So he
moves in with the other two members
of the band, the macho Rex (Steve
Buscemi) and the cute but stupid Pip
(Adam Sandler).
They figure that the only way to
stardom is to get their demo tape
played on KPPX, Rebel Radio. Armed
with a couple of realistic-looking water
pistols loaded with pepper sauce, they
bungle their way into lan the Shark's
(Joe Mantegna) broadcasting booth.
After goofing-up one too many times, a
simple request to play a tape becomes a
hostage situation.
"Airheads" has all the stereotypical
elements were used to seeing taken to
the extreme. There is the good cop
(Ernie Hudson) and the bad-ass
SWAT-team commander; the fat rook
ie cop (Chris Farley) and the slimy sta
tion manager (Michael McKean); the

nerdy station accountant (Michael
Richards) who ends up slithering
through the air ducts commando style
and the aging disc jockey who's still
cool; the rocker who used to be a total
square and the girlfriend whose only
desire is to hear her boyfriend say, "I
love you. " And the plot twists are all
similarly predictable.
The acting is competent, given the
cardboard cutout characters. Only
Mantegna seems to provide a tangible

character in the crowd. The direction
of Michael Lehmann rarely seems in
command of his story. Fans of Satur
day Night Live might be disappointed
as Sandler provides only a touch of za
niness and Farley lurks in an unin
spired supporting role.
The glue that makes it all palatable
is a steady stream of zingy one-liners
and some fresh updated slapstick. Per
haps the movie is supposed to parody a
rock documentary, perhaps the film

makers intended to spoof "Dog Day Af
ternoon," or maybe they even wanted
to provide a commentary on the evils of
the recording industry.
We're probably better off not think
ing too much about it.
"Airheads" is that mindless piece of
peculiar summer flotsam perfect for a
lazy summer evening when you don't
want to see anything witty, deep, intel
lectual, or enriching.
