## Editorial Mystical Conference 
### 
University should
exercise prudence
in endorsements

During the summer
months, Stanford spon
sors myriad conferences
covering a diverse and large
spectrum ranging from execu
tive training to business man
agement to research tech
niques.
This past weekend, howev
er, has seen a different, more
esoteric conference. The First
International Enneagram
Conference was held on the
Farm, attracting over 1,400
votaries from 17 different
countries.
Co-sponsored by the Stan
ford University Medical
School's Department of Psychi
atry, the enneagram received a
burst of academic respectabili
ty. As a psychological tech
nique, the enneagram is a tool
employed by its believers as a
way to glean self-knowledge and
insight. It is a century-old psy
cho-spiritual device borrowed
from Sufism — a mystical wing
of Islam — for personality
analysis and self-help that inte
grates Western psychotherapy
and Eastern spiritual tradi
tions.
Based on the principle that
there are nine ("ennea" means
"nine" in Greek) basic and es
sential personality types,
devotees ascribe a particular
number to each individual.
For example, someone who is a
"Three" is termed "The Per
former" and seeks to be loved
for achievement. A "Three" is
competitive by nature and
possesses a type "A" personal
ity. Often times, "The Per
former" appears more produc
tive than he or she actually is.
The so called "Evolved Three"
is likely to be an effective
leader or captain of a winning
team.
Eight other types classify
the broad continuum that is
humanity. They include "The
Perfectionist (One)," "The
Giver(Two)," "The Tragic Ro
mantic (Four)," "The Observ
er(Five)," "The Devil's Advo

cate (Six)," "The Epicure
(Seven)," "The Boss (Eight)"
and"The Mediator (Nine)."
Over 100 enneagram work
shops were held around cam
pus. Participants were taught
how the device could be used as
a tool for spiritual insight, per
sonal growth and even as a
means to facilitate manage
ment decisions. The First In
ternational Enneagram Con
ference was a success both fi
nancially and as a "coming
out" party. Capitalizing on the
enneagram popularity, the
Bookstore sold over $58,000 in
books dealing with ennea
grams alone during the confer
ence and sold t-shirts with the
enneagram printed on the
front.
But regardless, of last week
end's success, the University
has expressed some ambiva
lence in hosting a gathering
that include so many psychic
and mystic proponents. As a
prominent University, Stan
ford should not lend its name
so easily when it "sponsors"
conferences. What exactly
does the term "sponsor"
imply? When a prestigious uni
versity like Stanford co-spon
sors the First International
Enneagram Conference does
the University necessarily en
dorse the beliefs of the confer
ence or does Stanford simply
provide facilities in which the
conference can take place?
Stanford needs to act pru
dently as it serves as a venue for
various activities especially as
it did this previous weekend.
The enneagram affiliation with
the Stanford name has lent
some credence to its validity.
Although interest in en
neagrams is exploding —
growing in popularity in
mainstream religious and aca
demic circles — it has yet to be
accepted in clinical psycholo
gy. In order to preserve the
academic reputation that
Stanford has built over the
past century, it needs to act
cautiously and selectively.
A university should provide
platforms and open forums for
minority and radical organiza
tions, but its sponsorship
should be held in abeyance
until the University can act as
a complete advocate.
