## Karen Heywood A 						home away from home 
### 
SO, THE WORLD CAME to
Stanford this summer, and I
simultaneously ventured
out into the world. Yet even
though we were going in opposite
directions, World Cup Soccer was
one thing I just couldn't seem to
escape.
In fact, the World Cup, live
from the land of the Red, White
and Blue (and better still, live
from the land of the Red and
White!), helped to appease the in
evitable homesickness of a month
in Europe. My family and I tuned
in faithfully for a glimpse of good
old Stanford Stadium. It didn't
look quite the same without the
Tree or the Band and we really
didn't know what to make of such
energetic fans, either.
But if watching our home field
from abroad was enough to merit
a thrill, imagine watching one's
home team from such a distance.
The United States fell to Brazil as
we watched into the odd hours of
another time zone from our
muggy room in Verona. We were
sorry to see our boys lose, but
frankly were still a bit surprised
that they'd made it as far as they
did.
The Italians were winning,
though, and the excitement was
dizzying. Since Italy was our two
week home, we "adopted" it for
the remainder of the World Cup.
Italy's enthusiasm was envi
able, and in fact a little embar
rassing, to the apathetic Ameri

can. I mean, when is the last time
you can remember that our whole
country went ecstatically
bonkers all at once? When Italy
came back from behind to beat
Nigeria and advance to the quar
ter-finals, the Italians went nuts
— in unison.
We cowered, wide eyed, in the
corner of a restaurant on Lido Is
land, while waiters held trays
high above their heads and issued
primal screams, young drunk pa
trons left sloppy wet kiss marks
on the television and on the fe
male population. Platefuls of
spaghetti Bolognese were aban
doned in order to join the revelers
already taking over the streets.
"Imagine," we marveled, "what it
must be like right now in Rome!"
From that moment, there was
really no looking back. We were
sucked in. And the following
week — just in time for the quar
ter-final game between Spain and
the home team — we strolled into
the capital city. You think the
pope is big around Rome; you
should hear them talk about
Roberto Baggio.
We just couldn't help our
selves. We left the Vatican early
to make sure we got back to the
hotel in time for kickoff, al
though it was our last day in
Rome. The logic was simple: the
Michaelangelos and the Rafaels
sure as heck weren't going any
where. The World Cup, on the
other hand, comes but once in

four years.
The serious-faced concierge at
our hotel's front desk remarked
solemnly the following day,"I do
hope we stop winning. If this goes
any further, people will start re
ally killing each other!" Still, we
saw his pride gleaming through
— not to mention the bags under
his eyes betraying a long and wild
night past, along with a touch of
green face paint he hadn't quite
gotten out of one sideburn.
At least — as far as I heard —
no one actually got killed in the
carousing along the way to the fi
nals. We finally saw Italy surren
der to Brazil at two a.m. on a sta
tic-filled TV from a mildew and
mosquito-infested hotel in
Greece. In the end, Brazil's skill
threw the last punch — or kick,
as the case may be.
It was nice to have someone to
root for. Call it common ground if
vcu vill; cheering for the home
team made us feel a little tiny bit
more at ease in this far-away land
where, in shorts and Reeboks, we
were instant and obvious out
siders. Like when you finally
learn just where to jump in "All
Right Now" somewhere in the
middle of freshman year in the
stands of Stanford Stadium. It's
a thrill. It's a relief. It kind of
makes you feel like part of some
thing.
