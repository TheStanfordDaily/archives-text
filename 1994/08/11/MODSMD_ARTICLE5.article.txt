## Law School sculpture vandalized The 						Falcon defaced in second attack on campus artwork this year 
### Chip Ogburn 
In the second act of vandalism to hit the Stanford
campus this year, The Falcon, a sculpture by Alexan
der Calder located in the courtyard of the Stanford
Law School, was defaced by someone or someones
who decided it was actually a work-in-progress.
With Big Game antics starting a little sooner than
expected, the phrase "Cal rules" was scrawled nu
merous times with a bar of soap on The Falcon some
time last month, according to Stanford Police.
Though the vandals may have thought that they
were inflicting no permanent damage due to their
choice of medium, chemicals in the soap have left a
damaging stain on all sides of the sculpture.
Stanford Police are currently investigating the in
cident but have come up with no leads as yet. "Be
cause the epitaphs were slogans like 'Cal Rules',"
said Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer, "[the
damage] was probably done by Cal students, or
someone affiliated. Other than that, we have noth
ing."
Niemeyer said it was curious that the vandalism
occurred during the summer months, normally a lull
time in the Stanford-Cal rivalry. "Usually these

things coincide with football season," he said. "This
is very strange."
However, war wounds are nothing new to The
Falcon, which lives a double life as both artwork and
as the first hole in one of Stanford's less well-known
evening activities. "You could say that sculpture is
vandalized continuously in the form of frisbee golf,"
said one avid golfer, Michael Fehmers, upon hearing
about the recent defacing.
This constant barrage seems to have primed the
work for a facelift, with the attack in July only speed
ing up the process.
"Unlike the Gay Liberation statue, The Falcon
has been subject to repeated frisbee hits," said
Thomas Seligman, director of the Stanford Univer
sity Art Museum, referring to the George Segal
sculpture doused with paint earlier this year.
"Small marks have been left all over the sculp
ture, causing it to rust," said Seligman. "At some
point we would have to repaint it anyway."
The University is hoping to find a resurfacing ma
terial that will allow them to wash off the frisbee
marks while still maintaining the artist's intentions
of surface. According to Seligman this can be per
formed without moving the sculpture, but will not be
inexpensive.
