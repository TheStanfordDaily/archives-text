## Bomb threat in Old Union forces offices' evacuation 
### Lisa Parker Staff writer 
The basement offices of
Old Union were evacuated
Tuesday after a caller claimed
there was a bomb set to go off
at 1:30 p.m.
A man identifying himself
as John Davis of Santa Clara
called the Graduate School of
Business at 11:25 a.m. and
told office assistant Karen de
Sola that his organization had
planted a bomb in the base
ment of the Old Union and
that somebody "better do
something about it."
The caller told de Sola that
he was not a Stanford student
but would not identify
whether he was affiliated with
the University in any other
way. He refused to name the
organization he represented.
Stanford Police said de Sola
identified the man as a 30-
year-old Caucasian who
"spoke calmly and fairly artic

ulately."
The police evacuated the El
Centro Chicano offices and all
three wings of the basement
between 1 p.m. and 2 p.m. The
police said they found no ex
plosive devices.
Frances Morales, director
of El Centro and assistant
dean of students, said that
while some people in the
building did not take the
threat seriously, she did.
"I have worked here for
four and a half years and this
is the first time I have ever
been involved with a bomb
threat," Morales said.
Morales was told that a box
had been delivered to Old
Union that allegedly con
tained a bomb, but police said
there was no such box.
Police said that with 99
percent of bomb threats, it is
usually a disgruntled person
who hopes to cause a disrup
tion during the business day
with the threat.
