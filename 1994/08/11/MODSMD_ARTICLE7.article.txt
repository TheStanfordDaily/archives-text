## No big changes to come 
### Allison Short Editorial staff 
Although thp University's deci
sion to have the Stanford Manage
ment Company take control over
the operations of Tresidder Union
caused a shake-up in the Union's
management in June, no major
changes in the center's services
are anticipated for the upcoming
academic year
"Right now we haven't final
ized the complete action plan for
the 1994-95 year," Director of the
Stanford Shopping Center David
Longbine said.
"It's safe to say that the Union
will be the same come October,"
Dean of Students Michael Jackson
said. "What we're trying to do over
the next three years is to balance
the budget. It's not a quick fix."
The Stanford Management
Company's main focus this year
will be dealing with the infrastruc
ture of Tresidder Union, Long
bine said.
"We have to bring the unglam

orous, unseen areas up to par," he
added.
No changes in the eating areas
or other businesses are scheduled
to take place this year. Instead,
minor changes such as an exhaust
system for the kitchen area, roof
ing work and painting are planned.
The lack of any new additions to
Tresidder's eating establishments
also means the future of the long
awaited Taco Bell is still uncertain.
"It's 50-50 we'll see Taco Bell
this year," Longbine said.
Acknowledging that the equip
ment had already been purchased,
Dorthea Gregowski, assistant di
rector for the Stanford Shopping
Center, added that an effort is
being made to install Taco Bell in
side the cafeteria. However,
drainage problems and expenses
have prevented Tresidder from
obtaining a building permit.
According to Jackson, "The
main change we brought in was
the staff of the Stanford Shopping
Center to assist us in running the
building as well as we can."
