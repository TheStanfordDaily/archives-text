# Med Center to test new implants
## Stamford facility receives deluge of calls from interested women 
### Allison Short Editorial staff 
Over 1,500 phone calls from
curious women nationwide in the
past week have deluged the Stan
ford Medical Center, site of a new
breast implant study this fall.
The new breast implants are
filled with soybean oil and were
created primarily to make it easier
to detect early breast cancer.
After the Food and Drug Ad
ministration announced its ap
proval of the implants last week,
the Medical Center received an
overwhelming response.
"Our line has been busy since
last Monday," said Dr. Gail
Lebovic, an attending surgeon on
the Medical Center's staff special
izing in breast surgery and cancer.
"We weren't ready for it — it's
been really hard."
The pilot study, which involves
50 women, will take place at Stan
ford, as well as in four other med
ical centers in Los Angeles, St.
Louis, Gainesville, Florida and
Baltimore.
According to Lebovic, there
will be "very stringent require

ments" to participate in the study.
Women must have had previous
implants and they will then un
dergo a clinical evaluation.
Lebovic, along with plastic sur
geon Dr. Donald Laub, former
chair of plastic surgery at Stan
ford, will be performing the im
plant study at Stanford.
Lebovic believes the high inter
est is due to the fact that women
want a new alternative to silicon.
"This is one area in women's
health where there is a high de
mand for safe products," she said.
Lebovic added that, "Our pri
mary goal is to make sure the pa
tients are safe and that they're
not at risk."
In addition to soybean oil, the
new implants are comprised of a
silicon shell, processed to prevent
pieces of the silicon from break
ing. There is also a microchip
imbedded in the implant's shell
which, when scanned, connects
to a database that includes infor
mation about the patient and the
implant.
The new implants differ from
silicon gel-filled implants because
they are radio-lucent and there

fore allow x-rays to pass through
them and detect early signs of
breast cancer.
Over the past year, 90 women
in Europe received the new im
plants and no major problems
were identified.
"So far the results look promis
ing," Lebovic said. "But you can
never say there are no risks."
The 50 participants in the
U.S.'s pilot study will be exam
ined frequently during the first
six weeks and at different inter
vals for a year. There will also be
long-term follow-ups.
Participants will still pay the
standard price for a breast im
plant surgery, according to
Lebovic.
The idea for creating better
quality mammography images
has been in the works for a couple
of years, said Lebovic. The idea
originated at Washington Univer
sity in St. Louis. President of
Lipomatrix Corporations Dr.
Terry Knapp, a plastic surgeon
who finished his program at Stan
ford, along with Laub, further de
veloped the idea for the new im
plants.
