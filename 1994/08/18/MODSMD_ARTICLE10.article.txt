# Rare Hebrew books arrive
## 
### Justin Pollard Staff writer 
Stanford recently obtained for
$100,000 the library of the late Israel
Cohen, consisting of 20,000 rare Hebrew
books, thereby filling important gaps in
the University's Judaica and Hebraica col
lections.
"The Cohen collection is an exceptional
ly rich source of books, amassed by an Is
raeli book man, someone at the center of
Israeli literary and cultural life," said Prof.
Steven Zipperstein, the Daniel E.
Koshland professor in Jewish Culture and
History and director of the Program in
Jewish Studies.
Cohen, a publisher and editor, knew
practically everyone in Israeli literary cir
cles from the 1930s until his death 10
years ago, Zipperstein said. He brought to
gether "a huge collection of otherwise in
accessible Judaica books" in his three
room apartment in Tel Aviv, he added.

"It is a remarkably comprehensive col
lection," Zipperstein said. "For readers of
Hebrew, this collection represents an ex
traordinary resource."
Zipperstein said that in addition to the
many Hebrew works of fiction and social
commentary, Cohen owned numerous
books in other languages, including a large
collection of French and German litera
ture on Utopia. The first Israelis saw their
newly created state as a model for Utopian
society, Zipperstein added.
Dr. Roger S. Kohn, the Reinhard Fami
ly Curator of Judaica and Hebraica collec
tions for Stanford University Libraries,
said that the Cohen collection will perfect
ly complement the University's existing
collections of Jewish history and religious
studies, at the core of which are the large
Salo W. Baron collection, obtained 10
years ago, and the Jacob Milgrom collec
tion which was acquired this past year.

About 20,000 rare Hebrew books arrived to the Stanford Auxiliary Library on Tuesday.
"We are strengthening our library col
lections to support the Jewish studies pro
gram in three major areas — history , reli
gious studies, and modern Hebrew litera
ture," Kohn said. The Cohen collection
will greatly strengthen the libraries' hold
ings in modern Hebrew literature, noted
Kohn, an area which was previously far
from complete.
"It's a great collection," Kohn said. "It
includes everything important in 20th
century Hebrew literature."
The Koret Foundation awarded a
$50,000 grant to the Jewish studies pro
gram for the purchase of the Cohen li

brary. The other half of the $100,000 paid
for the collection was covered by the Uni
versity.
"The Koret Foundation has been an
ongoing participant and partner in the de
velopment of the Jewish studies program
at Stanford," said Tad Taube, president of
the Koret Foundation. The foundation
has supported various facets of the Jewish
studies program, including graduate stu
dent fellowships, overseas studies and li
brary acquisitions of more than $1 million
during the last few years.
The Koret Foundation is a Jewish
sponsored charitable trust based in San
Francisco which contributes to programs
to improve higher education, public policy
and society, in addition to extensive pro
grams in Israel.
