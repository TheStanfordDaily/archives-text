# Fuchs proposes changes
## Prof outlines alternative health care plan 
### Patricia Henley Staff writer 
The American health care
system needs major changes to
provide universal coverage while
curbing costs, a Stanford health
care economist argued recently.
Victor Fuchs, a professor in
both the Economics Department
and the School of Medicine, out
lined his proposals in the Aug. 17
Journal of the American Medical
Association. He said that none of
the plans now being considered
by Congress can meet what he
described as the most important
goals: providing efficient, equi
table coverage; preserving flexi
bility, freedom of choice and
quality; and stopping rising
costs.
Fuchs proposed an alterna
tive plan to meet these goals.
"We must develop a national
financial plan to cover basic care
for all, accelerate the present
trend toward integrated health
care systems, attack directly the
mqjor causes of increased health
care spending, and completely
change the nation's policy re
garding malpractice," wrote
Fuchs.
A basic benefit package for all
Americans would be funded
through a value-added tax
(VAT), Fuchs proposed. Under a
VAT, companies pay taxes based
on the amount of sales minus the
cost of purchases from other
companies, and add the cost of
the tax into the prices for their
products. A national VAT ear
marked for medical care is effi
cient and fair ••.'cause it allows
no loopholes or exemptions, he
said.

This proposal follows upon a
plea Fuchs made in an open let
ter to President Clinton in
JAMA on April 7, 1993, that ar
gued that employment-based
health insurance is both ineffi
cient and inequitable. Fuchs said
his proposal will prevent health
care systems from being domi
nated by a handful of giant in
surance companies.
He argued that physicians
should have a central role in
medical decision-making. While
doctors will want a good income,
Fuchs said, "there is a vast dif
ference between a profit-maxi
mizing corporation and physi
cians who strive to balance their
obligations to patients, the orga
nization and themselves."
As proposed by Fuchs, health
care professionals would man
age integrated health care sys
tems providing hospital care,
physician services and prescrip
tion drugs. Each system would
be required to offer a basic med
ical plan plus a variety of options.
Every American would get
vouchers for the basic plan,
which would have some copay
ments to stop wasteful use of
care. Patients could buy insur
ance to cover options such as a
private hospital room, a wider
choice of physicians or experi
mental technology.
Development of a large, pri
vate center for technology as
sessment is central to Fuchs's
plan. Through research, this
center would develop cost-effec
tiveness data for medical tech
nologies to provide a rational
basis for deciding which services
would be included in the basic
plan.
