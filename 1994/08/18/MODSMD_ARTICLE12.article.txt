# Up, up, and away
## Second Stanford grad goes to space 
### Kyle Graham Editorial staff with AP wire reports 
As of today, Sally Ride is no
longer the sole Stanford graduate
to blast off into space.
For today, Steve Smith, who
earned his bachelor's from Stan
ford in '85 and an MBA on the
Farm in 1987, will fulfill a life
long dream as part of the crew of
the space shuttle Endeavour, set
to take off from Cape Canaveral,
Fla.
Smith, 35, applied five times be
fore he was accepted to the nation
al astronaut program, but he was
the first graduate of the class of
1992 to land an assignment in
space. He is the first astronaut

from San Jose.
"I worked three years on the
other side of the program as a flight
controller in Mission Control,"
Smith told the San Jose Mercury
News in a phone interview during a
break in training in Houston.
"It made me realize for every
person who gets to go up, there are
5,000 to 10,000 really hard work
ing, smart people who can't go
with us. I feel very fortunate," he
said.
When the STS-68 Endeavour
leaves the launch pad at Kennedy
Space Center, Smith's responsibili
ties will include opening the shut
tle's payload bay doors and taking
photos of Earth.
Smith, who earned All-Ameri
can honors while at Stanford as a

member of the University's water
polo team, also will perform med
ical experiments and serve as the
prime communications systems
crew member. He will be called on if
needed for a spacewalk.
Smith worked on semiconduc
tors for IBM from 1982 to 1985
but still dreamt of becoming an as
tronaut. He took up flying and
earned another master's degree in
business administration at Stan
ford in 1987. Two years later,
NASA hired him as a payload offi
cer.
"On one of our first dates, he
told me he was interested in being
an astronaut," said his wife, Peggy
Brannigan. "It was a nice dream, a
very interesting dream. I thought it
was a very slim possibility."
