# Alums battle for U.S. Senate position
## 
### Allison Short Editorial staff 
No matter which candidate finishes first in the Dianne
Feinstein/Michael Huflington race this November, there
will definitely be a Stanford graduate in a California seat
in the U.S. Senate next year.
Current democratic Senator Feinstein, Class of '55,
and GOP U.S. Representative Huffington, Class of '70,
are the first two alumni opponents since 1986, when U.S.
Senator Alan Cranston, Class of '36, defeated Edwin
Zschau, MBA '63 and Ph.D. '67.
Stanford professors, however, find the candidates'
alumni status irrelevant when formulating opinions
about the upcoming election.
Political Science Prof. Richard Brody, one who does
not believe their alumni status makes a difference in the
election, said, "Stanford is an important university in the
West. It would seem we would have a fair number of po
litical figures come out of here."
Law School Prof. Robert Weisberg fmds neither Stan
ford graduate a preferable candidate, stating that, "On
the whole we've done poorly with senators in California,"

a fact he attributes to the "odd, fickle California voters."
Although Feinstein has been a prominent and well-re
spected alumnae, invited to be the graduation speaker for
the Class of '93, she is not always praised for her political
views.
"I think she's far less of a Democrat than she says she
is," Weisberg said. "She doesn't have a deep grasp of the
issues."
Regarding Huffington, Weisberg said," He seems to be
a mysterious character who would add absolutely noth
ing to the Senate."
Feinstein currently leads the polls and Brody believes
that "she'll win easily if she continues to hold her lead
through November." He added that the vast amount of
money Huffington has spent on his campaign "doesn't
seem to have gone far."
"It just shows how crazy the electorate is right now,"
Weisberg said. "Huffington should be getting slaugh
tered â€” but California voters are very odd."
Montana Democrat Max Baucus, North Dakota De
mocrat Kurt Conrad and Oregon Republican Mark Hat
field are the three other Stanford alumni in the U.S. Sen
ate.
