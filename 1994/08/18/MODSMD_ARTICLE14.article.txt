After six weeks of investigation, the
Stanford Police have no new leads as to
the identity of the armed robber who pis
tol-whipped two employees before clean
ing out the safe of the Stanford Coffee
House in July.
The robber got away with $4,400, accord
ing to Stanford Police, who said the robber
"no doubt had a good lay of the land."
Police had speculated that the robber
had been provided with inside informa
tion, or possibly a key, after finding no
signs of forced entry.
One Coffee House employee revealed

during police interviews that the robber
had called out the name of one of the em
ployees during the hold-up. But after
weeks of investigation, the police said no
connections can be made.
"The individual in question denies any
complicity at all and nothing has turned
up to contradict that," said Stanford Po
lice Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
The one set of fingerprints that police
were able to retrieve from the crime scene
turned out to be from one of the employ
ees, leaving the police with nothing to go
on, he added.
"We have extensively interviewed all of
the employees . . . but nothing has come
up," Niemeyer said.
