# CARDINAL FOOTBALL '94: WILL EXPERIENCE PAY OFF?
## 
### BY JORDAN WRUBLE 
Back in 1980, Bill Walsh
coached the San Francisco 49ers to
a poor 6-10 record. Just one year
later, he led his team to a Super
Bowl victory.
In this light, although the Stan
ford Cardinal football team's 4-7
record last season under Walsh
may have been disappointing,
Stanford's head coach has already
demonstrated that the prospects
for his teams can be grim one year
and rosy the next.
Although the Cardinal squad
has put last season behind them,
their success in 1994 will depend on
just how much the younger players
learned a year ago. Indeed, for this
year's squad, experience is the
main cause for optimism.
The Stanford offense, which
gained over 400 yards per game last
year, will be even better this year,
thanks to an improved running
game.
The defense, which will define
the limits on Stanford's potential,
is at the very least a year older but
likely much improved as well. Re
turning 19 starters in all, including
a few All-American candidates,
Stanford has a chance to win the
tough but wide-open Pac-10 Con
ference.
Disappointing '93 campaign
In the words of Bill Walsh, "Last
season was a disappointment." The
team never quite got on track, los
ing to every Pac-10 team it played
except those hailing from the state
of Oregon. And, for the first time
since Stanford trounced Cal in
1987, the Axe wound up in Berke
ley.
"We were anticipating that it
would be a tough year because we
graduated 25 top players," Walsh
said. The absence of older players

left the team in the hands of a
young and very green Cardinal
squad. "Our freshmen weren't
nearly experienced enough and
ready to play."
Quarterback Steve Stenstrom
agreed that Stanford lacked leader
ship on the field. According to Sten
strom, it was more than just an ab
sence of seniors which hindered the
Cardinal. "Not just seniors — it's
critical to have seniors who have
been on a winning team," Sten
strom said, referring to the players
who left the team after the 1992
season, having competed in the
Blockbuster and Aloha Bowls in
previous seasons.
The 1993 defense was dismal,
yielding over 35 points per game (as
compared to fewer than 15 points
per game in 1992), and never hold
ing an opponent to fewer than 27
points.
Yet Walsh, who called the de
fense "as bad as they get," consid
ered the struggle ail part of the
plan. Knowing that he could have
slightly more success with older
players, Walsh decided to make last
year the start of a very bright fu
ture.
"It was a building year," Walsh
said. "Coming off that, we will have
a much better defensive unit this
year. They will be experienced, they
will be much more talented, and
they will be ready to play."
The offense was led by an amaz
ing passing game, tallying the fifth
most yards-per-game in the coun
try. Stenstrom was phenomenal,
breaking four Pac-10 records and
putting his name beside five Stan
ford marks. Stenstrom had a lot of
help, surrounded by one of the
deepest and most talented receiv
ing corps in the nation.

The 1994 team
A look at the squad that will take
the field this fall must begin with
quarterback Steve Stenstrom (see
sidebar). Quite simply, in Walsh's
words, "He's outstanding."
Poised to break six more Stan
ford records and three Pac-10
marks, he is also being mentioned
as a candidate for the Heisman
trophy, the award given to the col
lege game's best player. He has
continued to develop as a player
and looks to actually improve on
last season. Comparing him to a
former Stanford All-American su
perstar, Walsh said, "This could be
an Elway-type year for Sten
strom."
To Stenstrom's delight, he has
all his receivers back, calling them
"the strength of our team."
"They're just very talented.
They balance each other out. We
have the big possession receivers,
the speedy guys that like to go
deep. They're all very sure-hand
ed. They are going to hold the team
together. The passing game will be
consistent all year."
Senior Justin Armour is a fa
vorite target of Stenstrom's, and
his 6-6 frame is easy find. Accord
ing to assistant head coach and Of
fensive Coordinator Terry Shea,
he's grown even faster this year
than last (his time in the 40-yard
dash now ranges in the high 4.5's or
10w4.6'5).
"Armour gives you that game
awareness, sawiness, that clutch
ability to make the big catch. I
think he's really primed for a sen
sational year," said Shea. "I think
you're going to see an All-American
performance."
Armour's running-mate is
sophomore Brian Manning, who
last season demonstrated a knack
for the big play. Manning, too,
could someday be considered one of
the best in the countiy.
"He's pretty special because he's
got that ability to accelerate and re
accelerate on a dime," Shea said.
"He goes up vertically, gets in and
out of his breaks very quickly, and
he can out-run you."
Walsh and Shea will look to best
utilize the talents and depth of the
receiving corps, which also features
Mark Harris, David Shaw and
Andre Kirwan, by using four re
ceivers on some plays. Said Shea, "I
see us doing a few more things to
open up the offense and try to cre
ate the big play."
In order to balance out the of
fense and open up the passing
game, the Cardinal must prove that
their running game, ranked last in
the Pac-10 last year, is a credible
threat. Boosting the ground attack
is one of the primary goals for
Walsh this training camp.
Shea believes that for the Cardi
nal running game to develop,
"[we've] got to have that one run
ner who electrifies his teammates
and his offense. When he steps in
the huddle, you feel that charge,
that confidence."
The best candidate for lighting a
fire with his running ability is
sophomore Mike Mitchell. With
high expectations weighing heavily
on him last year, Mitchell averaged
just 2.6 yards per carry. But after a
year to adjust and a strong spring
practice, Mitchell may be ready to
carry the torch for Stanford. Said
Shea, "He's going to have a great
year."
Senior Ethan Allen, who re
turns after gaining 5.7 yards per
carry in 1993, will also be looked to
as both runner and receiver out of
the backfield. His 52 catches were
the most on the team last season.
Sophomore Quincy Jacobs, who
was very impressive in spring
workouts, could also emerge as a
powerful force running the ball.
The fullback position looks
strong, provided everyone stays
healthy. Sophomore Greg Cornelia,

who missed part of spring practice «
with iryuries, demonstrated he can 1
be an excellent runner, blocker and I
receiver. Adam Salina, who also
has been hampered by injuries,
should have a bigger role this sea
son.
Walsh cites the run-blocking of
tight end Tony Cline as one of the
reasons for optimism this season.
"Cline's blocking should be the
best in the Pac-10 or college foot
ball." Cline also adds to the
passing game, pulling down 42

receptions last year.
The performance of the
line in blocking for both the
run and pass will have a
large impact on Stanford's
success. The line will have
to demonstrate an ability
to make holes for the

running game and keep
Stenstrom standing.
According to
Shea, the strength of
the line is its athleti
cism. Returning
four starters on line
from last year, Shea
is also pleased with
the way they looked
this spring, saying
"The offensive line was

really starting to gel."
The depth of the line was
greatly bolstered by the re
cruiting class, which includes
four linemen who earned prep
All-America honors a year ago.

Defense questions
As the offense looks to be domi
nant this year, most of the ques
tions this season concern the de
fense. While eight starters from
last season have returned, there is
no certainty about who will step
forward as any of a number of
players have a chance to make an
impact.
According to Walsh, to turn
around a team the way he did the
49ers, "It takes four or five players
to demonstrate that they are
great." In 1981, future Hall-of-
Famer Ronnie Lott joined the
49ers. At Stanford, the corre
sponding hopes lie largely with the
sophomores.
Who in particular will provide
that greatness on defense?
"Brian Batson is the number
one prospect to have an impact on
our team," said Walsh. "He's
probably our best, most talented
defensive player." Batson, an out
side linebacker who missed five
games with a broken tibia last
year, is an explosive force on the
field. As a freshman, he moved
into the starting lineup in just the
second game thanks in part to his
athletic ability and superior pass
coverage.
Walsh tabbed the front seven as
the key to defensive strength. "It
would take some greatness near
the line of scrimmage, either a
lineman or linebacker that can
dominate the game or be a
factor. That's what we
have to show we have."

The defensive line will
have to do better against
the run after giving up
more than 228 yards
per-game on the

ground last year. It
must also put more
pressure on op
posing quarter

backs.
Senior
nose tack
-1 e

Jason Fisk
has started
the

last 27
games at
Stanford
and is devel

oping into a
solid player, es
pecially good
against the run.

Sophomore Bryan
Werner, who
missed last sea
son with an in
jury, has a
chance to be a
superb pass
rusher from
the defensive

end position.
Walsh said
Werner
might sur
prise peo
ple this
year,

adding, "He could
be outstanding."
Coy Gibbs re
turns at inside
linebacker as
one of the most
experienced
players on the
team. Also play
ing inside is
sophomore

Justin Strand,
who was
touted
by

Walsh
as a
player
who
has a
chance
to be
great.
Strand
was
slowed
by in
juries
last year
but could

be a force
inside. Also
being
looked at to
make big con
tributions at in-

side linebacker is
Nick Watts, who
displayed a lot of abili
ty as a freshman last
year.
At one outside
linebacker spot will be
Batson. On the other

side might well be
junior Jason
White, who
emerged
last

year as a strong pass-rushing
threat.
The secondary remains a ques
tion mark for Stanford in 1994.
Sophomore Eliel Swinton, named
Stanford's Most Valuable Fresh
man last year, is a star in the mak
ing. Swinton spent time at all four
spots in the secondary last year but
may settle into a cornerback's job.
If Swinton is on the corner, it
may be because Scott Frost has
taken over duties at free safety.
One of the top quarterback re
cruits in the nation two years ago,
there is a good chance Frost will fill
a need in the defensive backfield
this season.

"[When] we go out against Ari
zona or Notre Dame, we just
can't have a great player like
Frost on the sideline," Walsh

said. "We've got to find a way
to play him. He's probably
the best athlete on the
team."

At safety, Kevin
Garnett and David
Walker return to
battle for playing
time. Sophomore
Charles Young,

who returns
after a knee in
jury, is also re
garded by
Walsh as a
player with a
chance to make
a large impact on

defense.
The defense will play

more zones this year and generally
be conservative. Walsh is stressing
the basics of tackling, going over
everything to make the defense as
solid as possible.
Walsh has made special-teams
play a priority for this training
camp. Said Walsh, "Our kicking
game becomes critical and we're
spending more time on that than
most colleges do."
Punter Aaron Mills had surgery
on his knee in March but is expect
ed to return after much success
last season. Place kicker Eric
Abrams had a bad back last year
and his kicking suffered as a result.
But Walsh expects him to return
this season to the form he exhibit
ed as a freshman, saying, "We're
assuming as a junior he'll come
i back and be one of the outstanding
place kickers in college football."
Tough schedule
i With so many returning players,
; the squad that takes the field this
» season will be familiar with both the
college game and each other. Last
year's freshman class, regarded as
i one of the best in the country, have
i the game experience required to
translate ability into success on the
; field.
A year ago, Stanford lost to
! UCLA and Arizona (which tied
! with the best record in the Pac-10
last season) by a total of six points.
! The difference between a win and a
i loss in close games, according to
» Stenstrom, is this: "Does the team
1 know how to win; an intangible
; quality."
According to Stenstrom, the
Cardinal squads which went to the
Aloha and Blockbuster Bowls
had players who could make

the big play in the
crunch. But last
year, he
says,

the team "knew how to play the
game but not to finish it." That,
Stenstrom adds, is something they
will learn again.
In close games, the role of
leadership on the field is para
mount. Said Walsh, "The leaders
on this team will have to demon
strate themselves." Starting in
the spring, Walsh developed an
innovative way to cultivate lead
ership ability in his young play
ers.
"We designated two captains
every day. Those captains speak to
the team following practice. This
is good practice for them to
demonstrate leadership and also
introduces them to their team
mates so that everybody feels com
fortable with each other and is
willing to take a strong stand or
leadership role," Walsh explained.
"I think it's working effectively. I
feel very good about it."
Stanford opens the season
against Northwestern. While
Walsh admits he prefers playing
Northwestern to Washington or
Texas A&M, he considers the Wild
cats a greatly improved team. Con
cerning a team that upset Boston
College in 1993, Walsh said, "Natu
rally, you're scared to death of
Northwestern. Anybody you play
you're worried they'll surprise
you." Still, the nationally televised
game gives Stanford the chance to
win its first season opener since
1986.
Both Walsh and Stenstrom con
sider it imperative for Stanford to
get off to a strong start. "We just
have to win those two games,"
Walsh said of the opener against
Northwestern and the next week's
game against San Jose State. "Be
cause then comes (powerhouses)
Arizona and Notre Dame."
Stenstrom says the start of the
season sets a tone which carries
through the whole year. "We have
to win our first Pac-10 game
against Arizona. We have to get
our confidence in ourselves. That's
going to be the big key point in our
season, that third game of the
year."
Success may indeed breed suc
cess and carry Stanford through a
Pac-10 which have upward of six
teams that have a reasonable
chance to go to the Rose Bowl.
Stenstrom considers the confer
ence so even that it is unlikely a
team will escape with fewer than
two losses. Although Walsh does
not consider Stanford good enough
to take on a dominant team, such
as Washington of a few years ago,
he thinks Stanford can compete if
the league is as wide-open as many
predict.
"Our offense will be among the
best in the country," explained
Walsh. "And that can win a lot of
games. But to beat the big teams,

the good teams, you have to play
defense well. And that will be our
measure."
Assessing the Cardinal's
chances in 1994 are simple. Coach

Walsh put it best: "If we play great
defense, we'll be a great team. If we
play good defense, we'll be a good
team. It all depends on our de
fense."

The Stanford defense must improve upon its 1993 performance for the Cardinal to smell the roses this
season.
