# Steve Stenstrom: gunning for roses
## 
### Jordan Wruble Editorial staff 
Most passing yards in one
season ... most yards in total
offense . .. most passes com
pleted . . . most yards in total
offense per game . . . most
touchdown passes .. . Steve
Stenstrom's resume goes on
and on.
All those records. Compar
isons to John Elway. Talk of
the Heisman trophy. Last
year's obliteratation of single
season marks in the Pac-10.
The Pac-10, not some wish
bone-running-grind-it-out-on-
the-ground-one-good-quarter-
back-breaks-all-the-records
conference. This year he'll
break the career totals.
Walsh calls him outstand
ing. With everything he accom
plished last year, Walsh says
"he's going to be dramatically
better this year than last."
Dramatically?
Walsh says he's better than
the guys he coached in his first
stint at Stanford, Guy Ben
jamin and Steve Dils. Benjamin
was a consensus Ail-American.
Dils played 11 seasons in the
NFL.
Senior quarterback Steve
Stenstrom won't let up, either.
He's always pushing himself to
be better. In fact, it might be
his most satisfying personal
triumph. "I think I'm most
proud that each year I've been
able to see a real improvement
in myself," Stenstrom said. "I
haven't stopped getting better;
I haven't plateaued yet."
He added, "My two goals for
the season are to have fun, to
look back at my senior year
and not wish I had taken time
to enjoy it," Stenstrom said.
"And to go play in the Rose
Bowl."
What about the records and
the Heisman trophy? "Those
kind of things might take care
of themselves," Stenstrom
said, if he just focuses on hav
ing fun and getting to Pasade

na. Besides, Stenstrom consid
ers the records and awards to
be primarily reflective of a
whole team effort.
With all he accomplished a
year ago, there was talk that
Stenstrom would leave school
early for the NFL. But there
were more important things to
Stenstrom than the lure of big
paycheck.
"I really didn't consider it
too seriously. It was more other
people talking about it," ex
plained the quarterback.
"There were too manÂ£ things
for me to come back here for."
Stenstrom will graduate in De
cember with a degree in Public
Policy.
So Stenstrom remains at
Stanford, still working to im
prove his game. He meets with
assistant head coach Terry
Shea, who is also the offensive
coordinator and quarterbacks
coach, to talk about quarter
back play and watch tape. Said
Shea, "He's certainly willing to
spend the time. He's put to
gether a great physical summer
in terms of his conditioning
and strength development."
Because Stanford struggled
despite all his success a season
ago, Stenstrom knows it will
take more than accurate passes
to earn a berth in the Rose
Bowl. And although he knows
it will take leadership to win,
he is humble about his role. "I
don't feel a burden to be a
leader of this team," Stenstrom
said. "I'm not a big rah-rah
kind of guy.. . I like to be a
leader by example."
While Stenstrom is modest,
Walsh will have none of it."He
is the leader," Walsh rebutted.
"He's an excellent leader."
The quarterback attributes
much of his development as a
player to his parents and all the
coaches he's had. Stenstrom,
who will be married in Febru
ary, also credits his fiancee,
former Cardinal swimmer Lori
Heiaick. "She's there to push
me all the time."
