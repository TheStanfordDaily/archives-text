## A 						gem by any name Jewel Hudson 
### Sandy Nesbit Tracy 
Opinionated.
Vain. Obstinate.
A people lover. A
friend. The worst
housekeeper in
the world.
That's how Jewel Hudson,
administrative coordinator for
the ASSU Legal Counseling Of
fice, describes herself.
A co-worker called her an un
forgettable character. Her min
ister said she is almost a worka
holic. Her husband of 31 years
said she is a "heck of an extro
vert."
"You can call me anything
you want," said Hudson, 54.
"Pearl, Opal, Ruby — I answer
to everything," she said.
She greets students with a
smile and "hi, dear" when they
come into her office on the sec
ond floor of Tresidder Union.
The office provides free legal
consultation and referral to stu
dents who have paid their ASSU
fees, along with their spouses.
Hudson assesses their situa
tions and refers them to lawyers
with whom ASSU contracts or
to other people she knows.
She compiled lists of people
who can help — lawyers, doc
tors, business people, board
members, ministers and rabbis
— when she began working at
ASSU four years ago. Many are
friends she made as a business
woman, classical ballet teacher,
mother, church member and
community activist.
"She knows a lot of people
and because she is Jewel, they
remember her," said Resa
Rivers, ASSU receptionist. "I'm
amazed at who she knows."
Recently a graduate student
starting his own company came
to Hudson for help. For two
months he had tried to reach a
prominent businessman, but
had been unable to get past the
man's secretary. The business
man happened to be an old
friend of Hudson's. She called
him, renewed their friendship
and made an appointment for
the student.
Starting a business is one
area in which students seek ad
vice. Personal injury, consumer
law, criminal charges, divorce
and child custody are others,
but most frequent consultations
are regarding landlord-tenant
issues and traffic citations,
Hudson said.
The office does not help with
immigration, patent law or with
issues a student has with the
University, she said.
When students need exten
sive legal assistance, the
lawyers contracted by the office
offer their services at reduced
rates, Hudson said.
When students come in dis
traught because of a date rape
or mental problems that make
them feel they have "crossed
over the line," Hudson said she
stringently protects their confi
dentiality by refusing to dis
cuss their cases outside of her
office.
The date rape victim "has al
ready been raped once — she

doesn't need to be raped again
by me," she said.
"I do whatever it takes as
long as it takes, especially if they
are emotionally upset," she
added. "We just close the door
and spend some time together.
Time is not a problem at all."
Hudson gives students
names of rape crisis counselors,
therapists, ministers, peer
counselors — anyone who can
help. She suggests ways to cope
with stress. She even calls the
students later to check on
them. Hudson said she wants
them to know that "wherever
they find themselves, there's
hope."
Nearly twice as many gradu
ate students as undergraduates
seek legal advice, Hudson's sta
tistics show. She explained that
this difference comes from the
fact that graduate students have
been out in the world so they
may already have mortgages,
contract negotiations or other
ongoing legal issues.
However, it is not quite so
easy to explain why nearly two
thirds more male students than
females seek help, she said.
Adding that it is often a topic of
Legal Office board meeting dis
cussions, Hudson said her theo
ry is that it may be that females
are more inclined to try to ana
lyze problems themselves to
start with, and males want to
get problems out of the way so
they seek advice at an earlier

stage of a problem.
Hudson's door is always
open, except when she is with a
client. During a typical after
noon, several students stopped
in to see the consulting lawyer,
another came to borrow law
books and a few more just want
ed to say "hi."
"If she can help you in any
way, she will, and you don't
need to feel any hesitancy," said
her friend Cozetta Guinn, an
artist who teaches at De Anza
college. "Everybody seems to
love her."
"I'm still not a responsible
adult but every once in a while I
pretend," Hudson said. Her
desk is stacked with files and
thank-you notes. Books, papers
and her granddaughter Kanee
tra's artwork cover the type
writer beside her Mac. Hudson
moved into the office a year ago,
but the ceiling fan, bulletin
board and clock wait to be hung.
She added that she hates clean
ing and will sacrifice to pay
someone else to do it.
A wonderful life
When Hudson's car broke down
recently, she said that made an
inconvenient day, not a bad day.
"Life is just very beautiful to
me," she said.
Hudson grew up an only child
in Youngstown, Ohio. Her
mother, a poet, playwright and
photographer, owned a beauty
parlor and a hat shop. Hudson

studied at Youngstown Univer
sity (now Ohio State
Youngstown) and the Universi
ty of San Francisco.
She taught classical ballet at
Santa Clara University, San
Jose State University and two
San Jose dance studios from
the late 1960's until her back
was injured in a 1972 car acci
dent. She said she was too vain
to continue teaching when she
could no longer demonstrate
dance moves, but she continued
to do consultation and still
keeps in touch with former stu
dents.
"Now they are lawyers and
dentists and computer special
ists," she said proudly.
Hudson is currently a partner
in Jewson Enterprises, a med
ical management market re
search and analysis firm. She
did marketing and public rela
tions when she and her hus
band, Vinson Hudson, started
the business over 20 years ago.
Hudson served on two presi
dential commissions, worked on
local politicians' campaigns and
chaired San Jose NAACP Youth
in the early 1980s.
At that time, her husband
pointed out that she had not
spent a single evening at home
for over a week, so she cut down
her activities to devote more
time to their three children,
now grown. The Hudsons later
provided a "home away from
home" for four other young

people.
Even though she is not quite
as involved in so many activi
ties, she still likes to let her
thoughts be known.
She said she will still "fire off
a letter to a congressman in a
minute." She is a member of
Mid-Peninsula Book Club, the
League of Women Voters health
care consensus committee and
business organizations.
Hudson freely expresses her
opinions on matters ranging
from "arrogance on campus" to
prejudicial reactions minority
students face when they arrive
on campus.
While Hudson has received
numerous awards in recognition
of her years of business and
community leadership, she
keeps only her "African-Ameri
can Woman of Distinction" in
her office. Even though she is
proud of them all, she said this
is the one most related to her
work on campus.
Hudson's minister, Carieta
Cain, noted that Jewel is a
founding member of the African
Methodist Episcopal Mission or
ganized last summer in Menlo
Park.
"She's very committed in her
work and to what she believes
in," Cain said. "She is ready and
willing to do whatever she needs
to do. She is so jubilant and joy
ous, so willing to give of herself.
"She is a jewel. She is certain
ly a jewel," she added.
