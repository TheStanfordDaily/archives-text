# Robert Simoni: Sapping into the Faculty Senate chair
## 
### Julie Zwaska 
Upon first hearing his opin
ions, many students may think
Prof. Robert Simoni is out to sin
gle-mindedly destroy their under
graduate careers. But once he has
had the chance to explain his
views on undergraduate educa
tion, it is clear that he believes he
is actually working to enhance
the overall quality of a Stanford
education.
Simoni said he hopes that he
will be able to use his new position
as Faculty Senate chair in the
1994-95 session to lead the Uni
versity in a positive direction.
Simoni, currently chair of the
Biology Department, will succeed
Prof. Patricia Jones, who will
switch roles with Simoni and take
over his biology chair position.
Having served more than 14
years on the senate, including
several terms on its Steering
Committee, Simoni brings exten
sive experience to the job. He also
has the support of his colleagues
— he was elected by a clear major
ity of next year's senate members.
However, these facts do not
paint a complete portrait of this
very dynamic and somewhat con
troversial professor, who proudly
admits that he will bring "fresh
opinions and fresh views" to the
job.
But to merely label Simoni a
controversial figure is incomplete
at best. Indeed, much of the con
troversy surrounding Simoni is
solely due to the issues he address
es and the ideas he espouses, all of
which are among the campus'
hottest — if not taboo — topics.
Bring back the F
Two such "hot potato" issues in
clude the reintroduction of the
"F" grade and other efforts to
eliminate allegedly rampant
grade inflation, and the debate
over whether Stanford should
seek to establish itself primarily
as a research or teaching univer
sity.
Simoni has not been quiet on
either topic. In fact, Simoni's
voice is sometimes one of the
loudest and most articulate.
Simoni was articulate in his
support of Gail Mahood's report
on grade inflation, which he
called "wonderfully thorough."
In this proposal, Mahood urged

for the return of the failing grade
to academic transcripts.
Simoni stressed that he did not
support such measures with the
deliberate intent of making life
hellish for Stanford students, and
one has little trouble accepting
his sincerity.
In an article he wrote for The
Daily on April 18, Simoni ex
plained that he believes that "the
academic record should honestly
report all levels of accomplish
ment. The current system of the
'vanishing NC' provides a disin
centive to academic effort and an
all-too-easy option to bail out
when things get tough rather
than to redouble one's effort."
This problem, he argues, could be
solved with the reintroduction of
the "F."
Simoni also believes that the
"A" grade has been devalued.
Quoting statistics which state
that "nearly 50 percent of the
grades awarded are A's and 40
percent are B's," Simoni asked
his colleagues to be more discrim
inate in their dispensing of these
high grades. Such actions, he ar
gues, "will go a long way toward
returning some value to our grad
ing system."
With "generally unanimous
support from the senate," as well
as support from more than 40
percent of the undergraduates
(according to a Daily poll), Simoni
emphasized that these measures
are only being implemented so
that "students take classes and
feel responsible for the outcome."
Teaching vs. research
The issue of whether Stanford
ought to represent itself as pri
marily a teaching or a research in
stitution arouses more of a splin
tering of opinions between mem
bers of the senate, and Simoni
clearly comes down on one side.
Simoni has previously turned
heads with statements in which
he called for Stanford to step up
its reputation as a research uni
versity.
"Faculty have no time for
scholarship and research," he
said. "We need to decide for our
selves whether we can continue to
walk this tightrope between
teaching and research, or
whether we should unapologeti
cally declare ourselves a research
university and do the best damn

job we can at teaching, but set the
priority and set it clearly."
He added that "it is really a
matter of resource allocation" as
to what determines which direc
tion Stanford education will take.
"Stanford as a research uni
versity should not be embar
rassed of its reputation. Teaching
is important, but we are a re
search university," he said.
It seems easy then to label Si
moni quickly as a professor who
dismisses the interests of those
students who come here to bene
fit from Stanford's faculty, but Si
moni claims that he has the stu
dents' interests at heart.
Though he stated that the re
search and teaching "are inextri
cably linked, and each is better for
the other," Simoni pointed out
that the school's reputation — as
either research- or teaching-ori
ented — "greatly influences the
kinds of students who come
here."
Adding that we "are not an
Oberlin or a Swarthmore," Si
moni said that prospective stu
dents deserve to know of the vast
resources and opportunities a re
search university can provide for
them, and their "perception of
Stanford as research institution

must be paramount."
The senate's year ahead
Simoni predicted that there will
be several other major issues that
the upcoming Senate will have to
address, with perhaps the most
notable being the forthcoming re
ports from the Commission on
Undergraduate Education.
The commission is looking at a
wide variety of academic concerns
and, while no changes have been
formally suggested, many propos
als are waiting in the wings.
Some ideas for the future of
Stanford's undergraduate educa
tion include a major overhaul of
the current Cultures, Ideas and
Values program, mandating a
year of college language classes or
the passing of a Stanford fluency
test and a possible melding of the
current two science and one math
DRs into a year-long science
course for non-science students
"which integrates the physical,
natural and technical sciences."
Regarding the influence the
senate has regarding these or
other possible curriculum
changes, Simoni said that it has
"absolute power." It is the Facul
ty Senate, he added, that ap
proves any improvements in the

Stanford curriculum.
As a political body the senate
has no real power in matters on
the "fringe of academic stuff,"
such as the budget, although such
issues are frequently discussed at
length.
Simoni sees that one of his du
ties as chair will be to make a con
centrated effort "to try and modi
fy the function of the senate so
that the routine and boring stuff
gets done on a parallel track
somehow so that meetings can be
used to discuss substantive mat
ters."
Overall, Simoni is nothing
short of bursting with enthusi
asm when he discusses his new
job.
Though he admits that noth
ing in his background has trained
him in political matters, Simoni is
"very excited" about the people
with whom he will be working.
He said that the senate's Steer
ing Committee is full of "bright,
activist, caring people, who span
the political spectrum," adding he
"never ceases to be amazed at how
smart [his] colleagues are."
So when Simoni says that as
the new Faculty Senate chair he is
"going to have a lot of fun," one
has no choice but to believe him.
