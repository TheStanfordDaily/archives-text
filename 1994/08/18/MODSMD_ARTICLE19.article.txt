## A 						long, hot summer sans baseball The 						dog days just don't seem complete without America's pasttime 
### Chris Yeh 
I'm a baseball fan, pure and simple,
and I think I speak for all of my kind
when I tell you that the summer just
ain't a summer without baseball. Period.
A summer without baseball is like a
life without Cheez-whiz; somehow,
even if you know it's bad for you, things
just don't taste as good unless you have
it. Baseball and summer are an eternal
combination that belong together like
Astaire and Rogers, or Sinatra and
Bono. Only during the long, hot, lazy
afternoons and evenings of summer
can the slow pace of baseball bring
about the exquisite state of perfectly
enjoyable boredom that occurs at a
ballpark. Forty-thousand otherwise
sane human beings, doing the wave.
That's baseball.
Baseball expresses all the hopes and
dreams of summer. Just like everyone
guy thinks that he might—if he just got a
chance to talk to her and show her his col
lection of beer bottles—get a date with
Cindy Crawford, every baseball team
honestly believes they might go to the
World Series—even if they're the Padres.
Baseball takes the alarm clock of life
and puts it on permanent snooze. Unlike

football or basketball, a baseball game
really isn't over 'til it's over (as the
amazingly incompetent Todd Worrell
has repeatedly proven to Dodger fans
this summer). There's no running out
the clock, no stalling. Like summer,
baseball is essentially timeless; no mat
ter how close to the end the game may
seem, there's always time for a come
back (or a quick road trip to Tijuana, de
pending on your tastes—and your
health insurance).
But there's one catch: to enjoy base
ball, it's got be played. Now you probably
know, at least by reading this article,
that there's a baseball strike on. I won't
bore you by telling you how disappointed
I am that Williams and Griffey aren't
getting the chance to break Maris'
record. I won't tell you how insane it is to
end the season when Tony Gwynn is on
the verge of hitting .400 (he'd be the first
man to do it since FDR was in office). I
won't even mention that Don Mattingly
may never play in the World Series.
What I will do is tell you a little story.
Maybe you know it.
Do you remember when you were a
kid, and you went to that park during the
summer to play baseball? There'd al
ways be some guy named Big Sam, or Big

Something—you know the type, freck
led like Pippi Longstocking, but growing
a mustache and beard at the age of
eleven—who could hit the ball so far that
you had to seven-hop it back to the in
field when you caught up with it. He'd be
one of the captains.
Then there'd be this other kid,
Frankie, not as big as Big Sam (who
was?), but a real smooth-talker, whose
daddy wore gold chains and drove a big,
white Mercedes, and gave Frankie twen
ty bucks allowance a week when every
one else, even the dentist's kid, got five.
And Frankie, he'd bring his spanking
new aluminum bat, and he'd be the
other captain, and they'd pick the teams.
But somehow, sooner or later, Big
Sam and Frankie would get into a fight
over the game, and Big Sam would storm
off into the outfield and sit there all in a
huff, picking at his pimples, and Frankie
would grab his bat and ball and he under
the maple behind home plate and smoke
one of those big ol' cigars he stole from
his daddy.
And the rest of us would stand there, our
mitts useless by our sides, the sun scorch
ing out our young brains, while Frankie
and Big Sam held our summer hostage.
Unfortunately, that's baseball, too.
