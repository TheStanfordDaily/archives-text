Women's Volleyball
The 1994 Stanford women's volleyball team
has been named preseason No. 1 in Volleyball
Monthly's Top 20 poll. In 1993, the Cardinal fin
ished with a 22-7 overall record and a mark of 13-
sin the Pacific-10 Conference to tie for second
place. The team was ranked No. 6 in Vollyball
Monthly's final poll of the season.
"We're flattered to be picked No. 1," said
coach Don Shaw. "I didn't really think we de
served to be No. 1 last year. But this year, I think
we're in the ballpark."

Australian Open in January and a quarterfinal
