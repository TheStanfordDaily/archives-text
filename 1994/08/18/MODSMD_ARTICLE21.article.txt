When the Phillips 66 National Swimming Cham
pionships come to an end this Saturday, the United
States will be ready to take on the world.
The meet, being held at the Indiana University
Natatorium in Indianapolis, Ind., is serving several
purposes. On top of crowning 1994 national cham
pions in the individual events, the competition is
also the selection meet for the U.S. national teams
which will compete at the VIIFINA World Champi
onships and the 1995 Pan American Games.
The top two finishers in each event will represent
the United States at the world championships, with
the exception of the 100- and 200-meter freestyles,
which will take the top four.
On Sunday, the first of six days of racing, Cardi
nal swimmers began their quests to qualify.
In the 100 free, senior Jenny Thompson outraced
the field, touching first in a time of 55.50 seconds.
In the men's competition, 1994 graduate Tyler
Mayfield missed qualifying for the world games in
the 100 breaststroke by a mere fraction of a second,
finishing third. Senior Kurt Grote was fifth. In the
200 free, junior Joe Hudepohl placed seventh.
Earlier, Thompson earned a spot on the 800 free
relay by placing third in the 200 free. Senior Kendra
Thayer finished seventh in the 400 individual medley.
