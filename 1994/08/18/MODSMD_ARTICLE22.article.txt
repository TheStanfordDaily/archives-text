"The Return of Will the Thrill."
Thus reads the newspaper headline atop
a collage of articles and photos discussing
the NCAA championship captured by the
Stanford men's golf team this June.
The collection of momentos is in the
room of William Yanagisawa, whose spec
tacular individual performance helped the
Cardinal earn its first NCAA golf champi
onship since 1953.
And while the encapsulating headline
was written to hail the return of ex-San
Francisco Giant Will Clark to the Bay Area,
it could also double as the title of the story
which brought Yanagisawa to Stanford.
After not being recruited to play college
golf out of high school, Yanagisawa
searched for a school which could use his
services. He ended up at the University of
Arizona. However, the native of Long
Beach, Calif., found that the sunny skies of
Arizona were simply not for him.
"I wanted to walk on the golf team at Ari
zona, which was ranked about third in the
nation at the time," Yanagisawa said. "I
talked to the coach and he said he'd get back
to me. I didn't feel like I would be given a
chance to try out. I went through a week of
Orientation and had my classes all set, (but)

I didn't like the atmosphere or the weath
er."
Yanagisawa was not optimistic about his
future at Arizona, especially on the golf
course, so he weighed his options and decid
ed to leave before classes began.
"I didn't think I'd have a chance to make
the team, so I left and drove home," he said.
Opting to stay closer to home, Yanagi
sawa spoke with the coach at UC-Irvine,
where he had already been admitted. At
UCI, he was given the chance he had hoped
to find at Arizona.
"Coach held open qualifying with 35
players," Yanagisawa said. "He told us 10
would make the team and the top five would
go on the first trip."
Seizing the opportunity, Yanagisawa
placed fifth in qualifying. Although he fin
ished well off the pace in his first collegiate
outing, Yanagisawa bounced back and fin
ished third overall in his second start.
After playing at No. 1 for UCI in his first
two years, Yanagisawa received bad news —
as part of the UC-system's budget tighten
ing process, his athletic scholarship was
cut.
"The letter itself was very polite, but the
news was a very rude awakening," Yanagi
sawa Baid. "But I figured given my perfor
mance at UCI that I'd be able to get some
kind of scholarship somewhere."

That was when his father suggested he
give Stanford a call.
"I called coach (Wally Goodwin), and he
asked, 'What's your GPA?' and 'What are
your board scores?' I told him and he said,
'Sorry, I can't help you.'"
Yanagisawa kept looking, but received a
call from Goodwin the very next morning.
After improving his score on the SAT test,
he was admitted to Stanford.
Getting into Stanford was tough, but it
was not the hardest part of the story for
Yanagisawa. He attended classes at UCI in
the fall of his third year before transferring
to Stanford.
"I found out I got in on my recruiting trip
here," he said. "It was during finals week at
Irvine."
Arriving mid-year was one of the tough
est trials the senior has had to face.
"Initially, I didn't like it here very
much," Yanagisawa said. "It was my first
time away from home, and I was a red-shirt,
so I wasn't competing. I was also shocked by
the schoolwork here."
With a combination of things weighing
heavily on his mind, Yanagisawa had
thoughts of leaving Stanford.
"I got depressed; it was not a really
happy time," he said. "I don't want to go
through that again, but looking back, I'm
glad I did. I literally did not want to be here.

I had a signed stop-out form with me all
spring quarter."
Yanagisawa decided to return this year,
although he had some doubts.
"It didn't look to good for me, but I had a
lot of support from coach and the athletic
department. Without them, I probably
wouldn't have come back," Yanagisawa
said.
Goodwin and his Cardinal teammates
are glad he did return, as Yanagisawa
stormed to a third-place individual finish at
NCAAs. He was named the Pacific-10 Con
ference male athlete of the year, along with
fellow Stanford athletes, football player
Steve Stenstrom and swimmer Derek
Weatherford. Yanagisawa also was named
an Honorable Mention Ail-American.
After enjoying such success after a rocky
beginning at Stanford, Yanagisawa is glad
that he decided to make the best of a tough
situation.
"To have things work out the way they
have — I feel very grateful and fortunate to
have had the opportunity," he said.
With several returning starters from
this year's NCAA championship squad, the
Cardinal will be looking to defend their
title.
And while next year's outcomes cannot
be easily predicted, one thing is sure — Will
the Thrill will definitely return.

Thus reads the newspaper headline atop
a collage of articles and photos discussing
the NCAA championship captured by the
Stanford men's golf team this June.
The collection of momentos is in the
room of William Yanagisawa, whose spec
tacular individual performance helped the
Cardinal earn its first NCAA golf champi
onship since 1953.
And while the encapsulating headline
was written to hail the return of ex-San
Francisco Giant Will Clark to the Bay Area,
it could also double as the title of the story
which brought Yanagisawa to Stanford.
After not being recruited to play college
golf out of high school, Yanagisawa
searched for a school which could use his
services. He ended up at the University of
Arizona. However, the native of Long
Beach, Calif., found that the sunny skies of
Arizona were simply not for him.
"I wanted to walk on the golf team at Ari
zona, which was ranked about third in the
nation at the time," Yanagisawa said. "I
talked to the coach and he said he'd get back
to me. I didn't feel like I would be given a
chance to try out. I went through a week of
Orientation and had my classes all set, (but)

I didn't like the atmosphere or the weath
er."
Yanagisawa was not optimistic about his
future at Arizona, especially on the golf
course, so he weighed his options and decid
ed to leave before classes began.
"I didn't think I'd have a chance to make
the team, so I left and drove home," he said.
Opting to stay closer to home, Yanagi
sawa spoke with the coach at UC-Irvine,
where he had already been admitted. At
UCI, he was given the chance he had hoped
to find at Arizona.
"Coach held open qualifying with 35
players," Yanagisawa said. "He told us 10
would make the team and the top five would
go on the first trip."
Seizing the opportunity, Yanagisawa
placed fifth in qualifying. Although he fin
ished well off the pace in his first collegiate
outing, Yanagisawa bounced back and fin
ished third overall in his second start.
After playing at No. 1 for UCI in his first
two years, Yanagisawa received bad news —
as part of the UC-system's budget tighten
ing process, his athletic scholarship was
cut.
"The letter itself was very polite, but the
news was a very rude awakening," Yanagi
sawa Baid. "But I figured given my perfor
mance at UCI that I'd be able to get some
kind of scholarship somewhere."

That was when his father suggested he
give Stanford a call.
"I called coach (Wally Goodwin), and he
asked, 'What's your GPA?' and 'What are
your board scores?' I told him and he said,
'Sorry, I can't help you.'"
Yanagisawa kept looking, but received a
call from Goodwin the very next morning.
After improving his score on the SAT test,
he was admitted to Stanford.
Getting into Stanford was tough, but it
was not the hardest part of the story for
Yanagisawa. He attended classes at UCI in
the fall of his third year before transferring
to Stanford.
"I found out I got in on my recruiting trip
here," he said. "It was during finals week at
Irvine."
Arriving mid-year was one of the tough
est trials the senior has had to face.
"Initially, I didn't like it here very
much," Yanagisawa said. "It was my first
time away from home, and I was a red-shirt,
so I wasn't competing. I was also shocked by
the schoolwork here."
With a combination of things weighing
heavily on his mind, Yanagisawa had
thoughts of leaving Stanford.
"I got depressed; it was not a really
happy time," he said. "I don't want to go
through that again, but looking back, I'm
glad I did. I literally did not want to be here.

I had a signed stop-out form with me all
spring quarter."
Yanagisawa decided to return this year,
although he had some doubts.
"It didn't look to good for me, but I had a
lot of support from coach and the athletic
department. Without them, I probably
wouldn't have come back," Yanagisawa
said.
Goodwin and his Cardinal teammates
are glad he did return, as Yanagisawa
stormed to a third-place individual finish at
NCAAs. He was named the Pacific-10 Con
ference male athlete of the year, along with
fellow Stanford athletes, football player
Steve Stenstrom and swimmer Derek
Weatherford. Yanagisawa also was named
an Honorable Mention Ail-American.
After enjoying such success after a rocky
beginning at Stanford, Yanagisawa is glad
that he decided to make the best of a tough
situation.
"To have things work out the way they
have — I feel very grateful and fortunate to
have had the opportunity," he said.
With several returning starters from
this year's NCAA championship squad, the
Cardinal will be looking to defend their
title.
And while next year's outcomes cannot
be easily predicted, one thing is sure — Will
the Thrill will definitely return.
