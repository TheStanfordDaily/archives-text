## Free your samples...and your jazz will follow With the help of Blue Note Records, the multi-national crew Us3 attempt to take the fusion of hip-hop jazz to new levels 
### Robert Ross 
Us 3 began with a smile. An unexpected
one, at that.
"It happened by accident, really," said
GeofT Wilkinson, a London based DJ and
jazz enthusiast who teamed with studio
owner and producer Mel Simpson to found
the jazz-rap fusion group. "The first single
we put out on a commercial release I hap
pened to sample a track that was on Blue
Note. A Capital man heard it on the radio
and recognized the sample and he called us
into his office.
"We didn't get clearance to use the first
sample so we naturally assumed they want
ed to sue us. When we got there to see the
guy, he opened the door. He was smiling."
Wilkinson and Simpson immediately rec
ognized that instead of going to court, they
had an opportunity to create "the ultimate
fusion of jazz and rap, using the Blue Note
catalogue as a sampling resource," says
Wilkinson.
The first result was the single, "Can
taJoop (Flip Fantasia)," which combined the

introduction from
late jazz drummer .
Art Blakey's "A
Night in Birdland
Vol. 1" with Herbie '
Hancock's "Can- j
taloupe Island" and i
rapper Rahsaan's ;
flowing, silky lyrics j
to create the best sell
ing and highest
charting (No. 9 on
Billboard's charts
last February) single
in Blue Note
Record's history.
Soon afterward !
the duo released
"Hand on the :
Torch," a 13-track
album that samples
heavily from Han
cock, Blakey and
other jazz greats
such as Thelonious
Monk and Horace
Silver. The co-pro
ducers employed
three rappers, Brook
lyn natives Powell
and Rahsaan and Ja
maican Tukka Yoot
as well as a eight
piece band hand
picked from the best
of the London jazz
scene. Us 3 has been
touring the U.S.
since July and will hit
San Francisco's Fil
more Theater next
Monday.
Us 3 has kept Blue
Note officials smiling
ever since the release
of the first single.
Owned by Capital
records, Blue Note is
the oldest and most
important jazz record

label in existence and Us 3 is currently their
only rap-jazz fusion group under contract.
Creating good jazz-rap fusion is like
alchemy — everyone tries it, yet no one
strikes gold.
"A lot of people who were doing similar
things before us were coming from one
angle or the other," Wilkinson explains. "It
was either a hip-hop act with some jazz in it
or a jazz act with some rapping in it. We
wanted to do something that was a true fu
sion — 50% rap and 50% jazz."
On "Hand on the Torch," the duo pro
duce an album that maintains a proper re
spect of the jazz that spawned it. Both

Wilkin- t >
son and \
Simpson f||
are serious
jazz enthu-
siasts and by

collaborating
with Blue Note Records, they have been able
to avoid the criticism many jazz fans have
leveled at other fusion attempts.
On the other hand, "Torch" brings many
young fans into contact with great jazz that
they otherwise might never experience.
After the success of "Hand on the Torch"
Blue Note released "Straight Up, No Chas
er," a compilation album with the full
length versions of all the samples used in
Us 3's debut.
"Hand on the Torch" can then be seen as
a gateway into jazz through a medium more
commercially popular than jazz itself. By in-

tertwining the two forms so effortlessly,
Wilkinson and Simpson created a hybrid
that is both successful in its own right and
effective advertisement for both styles inde
pendently.
" 'Hand on the Torch' means to me to
pass knowledge from one generation to an
other," Wilkinson said. "We wanted to be a
point of entry for younger people in to jazz —
to open the door. It was a difficult thing to
try to educate people without preaching to
them. We didn't want to come out and say
'You've go to listen to this.' Jazz is a very
multifaceted music and one particular as
pect of it may not be to another's taste.

yourself

that both Powell and Rahsaari took with
them into this fusion venture was their
background. Both grew up in jazz families,
and Powell's father was a saxophonist in a
number of New York-based R&B acts. This
childhood influence is evident in the duo's
pace and style.
"The two American guys Rahsaan and
Kobie had a lyrical flow that was very much
how a musician would play the sax," Wilkin
son said. "He didn't just rhyme in rhyming
couplets and he didn't just stay on the beat
all the time. Sometimes he'd push it, some
times he'd be behind the beat. He'd weave
around, and that was very appealing to us.
"They both grew up in households where
they listen to jazz almost subconsciously. I
think they'd infused that into their own in
dividual styles."
The success of any musical form depends
on its performance quality as well as its stu
dio quality. Rap is notorious for being a con
cert letdown, more mechanical and pro
scribed when the actions of the DJ and
mixer were made ob

People can
pick up upon different tunes from the album
that they liked, check out the source mater
ial that we sampled and then take it from
there."
Such an emphasis on jazz and its revered
past did not take away from the hip-hop in
fluence on the album. In fact, Wilkinson
thinks that Us 3's music stems from rap, not
jazz. As the Beastie Boys started with the
hip-hop genre and then delved into '70's
funk on an album like "Paul's Boutique,"
Us 3 began with the talents of their rapping
trio, then chose the appropriate samples.
None of Us 3's rappers have the harsh,

domineering character of voices prevalent
in popular groups like N.W.A. and Public
Enemy. Rather their voices are smooth and
leisurely, resting on the jazz like confection
er's sugar on waffles. Although Tukka
Yoot's Jamaican dance hall style is more dis
tinctive than his two mates, the effect is the
same — a voice that becomes another in
strument in the jazzy hybrid.
"The thing the two styles (jazz and rap)
have in common is freestyle rap and impro
visational jazz," Wilkinson said. "I think
that we are the First group to actually
achieve this."
According to Wilkinson, an advantage

vious on stage. Con
versely, jazz is a style
of music that must be
experienced live to get
a full appreciation of
its power, dynamics
and magnitude.
A fusion of the
two forms then raises
questions. Will the
music maintain the
stage-presence of
jazz, or denigrate into
a hip-hop contortion
of prerecorded music?
As Us 3 began to tour
the answer seemed to
be the latter as
Wilkinson and Simp
son stayed with the
group, mixing the
samples on stage and
playing the drum ma
chine.
"After that expe
rience when every
thing started to get a
bit crazy, we retired
back to the studio,"
Wilkinson said. "And
it was only then that
we realized that by
adding another key
board player and a
live drummer we lift
ed all the restrictions
on the musicians.
Their live interpreta
tions of the songs has
expanded quite a lot.
"Now the Us 3
band is completely
live. There are no
samples or DAT tapes
used. There is no DJ
there. It's very much a
live interpretation
and I think that's a lot
more exciting."

Wilkinson is very excited about the
prospects for another album, especially
given the success of "Hand on the Torch".
"We have only just scratched the surface.
There are so many different styles of hip
hop and jazz that the possibilities for fusion
of the two are endless.
"The ideas for a next album are logical ex
tensions of the first. To a seasoned jazz fan
we used some fairly obvious conventions.
On the second we want to take people far
ther into the music and add more live play
ing."
Such a prospect should bring smiles to
many music fan.

Such an emphasis on jazz and its revered
past did not take away from the hip-hop in
fluence on the album. In fact, Wilkinson
thinks that Us 3's music stems from rap, not
jazz. As the Beastie Boys started with the
hip-hop genre and then delved into '70's
funk on an album like "Paul's Boutique,"
Us 3 began with the talents of their rapping
trio, then chose the appropriate samples.
None of Us 3's rappers have the harsh,

domineering character of voices prevalent
in popular groups like N.W.A. and Public
Enemy. Rather their voices are smooth and
leisurely, resting on the jazz like confection

Yoot's Jamaican dance hall style is more dis
tinctive than his two mates, the effect is the
same — a voice that becomes another in
strument in the jazzy hybrid.
"The thing the two styles (jazz and rap)
have in common is freestyle rap and impro
visational jazz," Wilkinson said. "I think
that we are the First group to actually
achieve this."

versely, jazz is a style

its power, dynamics

A fusion of the
two forms then raises
questions. Will the
music maintain the
stage-presence of
jazz, or denigrate into
a hip-hop contortion

As Us 3 began to tour
the answer seemed to
be the latter as
Wilkinson and Simp
son stayed with the
group, mixing the
samples on stage and
playing the drum ma

"After that expe
rience when every
thing started to get a

back to the studio,"
Wilkinson said. "And
it was only then that
we realized that by
adding another key
board player and a
live drummer we lift
ed all the restrictions

Their live interpreta

expanded quite a lot.
"Now the Us 3
band is completely
live. There are no

Wilkinson is very excited about the
prospects for another album, especially
given the success of "Hand on the Torch".
"We have only just scratched the surface.
There are so many different styles of hip
hop and jazz that the possibilities for fusion
of the two are endless.
"The ideas for a next album are logical ex

Such a prospect should bring smiles to

Us 3 began with a smile. An unexpected
one, at that.
"It happened by accident, really," said
GeofT Wilkinson, a London based DJ and
jazz enthusiast who teamed with studio
owner and producer Mel Simpson to found
the jazz-rap fusion group. "The first single
we put out on a commercial release I hap
pened to sample a track that was on Blue
Note. A Capital man heard it on the radio
and recognized the sample and he called us
into his office.
"We didn't get clearance to use the first
sample so we naturally assumed they want
ed to sue us. When we got there to see the
guy, he opened the door. He was smiling."
Wilkinson and Simpson immediately rec
ognized that instead of going to court, they
had an opportunity to create "the ultimate
fusion of jazz and rap, using the Blue Note
catalogue as a sampling resource," says
Wilkinson.
The first result was the single, "Can
taJoop (Flip Fantasia)," which combined the

introduction from
late jazz drummer .
Art Blakey's "A
Night in Birdland
Vol. 1" with Herbie '
Hancock's "Can- j
taloupe Island" and i
rapper Rahsaan's ;
flowing, silky lyrics j
to create the best sell
ing and highest
charting (No. 9 on
Billboard's charts
last February) single
in Blue Note
Record's history.
Soon afterward !
the duo released
"Hand on the :
Torch," a 13-track
album that samples
heavily from Han
cock, Blakey and
other jazz greats
such as Thelonious
Monk and Horace
Silver. The co-pro
ducers employed
three rappers, Brook
lyn natives Powell
and Rahsaan and Ja
maican Tukka Yoot
as well as a eight
piece band hand
picked from the best
of the London jazz
scene. Us 3 has been
touring the U.S.
since July and will hit
San Francisco's Fil
more Theater next
Monday.
Us 3 has kept Blue
Note officials smiling
ever since the release
of the first single.
Owned by Capital
records, Blue Note is
the oldest and most
important jazz record

label in existence and Us 3 is currently their
only rap-jazz fusion group under contract.
Creating good jazz-rap fusion is like
alchemy — everyone tries it, yet no one
strikes gold.
"A lot of people who were doing similar
things before us were coming from one
angle or the other," Wilkinson explains. "It
was either a hip-hop act with some jazz in it
or a jazz act with some rapping in it. We
wanted to do something that was a true fu
sion — 50% rap and 50% jazz."
On "Hand on the Torch," the duo pro
duce an album that maintains a proper re
spect of the jazz that spawned it. Both

Wilkin- t >
son and \
Simpson f||
are serious
jazz enthu-
siasts and by

collaborating
with Blue Note Records, they have been able
to avoid the criticism many jazz fans have
leveled at other fusion attempts.
On the other hand, "Torch" brings many
young fans into contact with great jazz that
they otherwise might never experience.
After the success of "Hand on the Torch"
Blue Note released "Straight Up, No Chas
er," a compilation album with the full
length versions of all the samples used in
Us 3's debut.
"Hand on the Torch" can then be seen as
a gateway into jazz through a medium more
commercially popular than jazz itself. By in-

tertwining the two forms so effortlessly,
Wilkinson and Simpson created a hybrid
that is both successful in its own right and
effective advertisement for both styles inde
pendently.
" 'Hand on the Torch' means to me to
pass knowledge from one generation to an
other," Wilkinson said. "We wanted to be a
point of entry for younger people in to jazz —
to open the door. It was a difficult thing to
try to educate people without preaching to
them. We didn't want to come out and say
'You've go to listen to this.' Jazz is a very
multifaceted music and one particular as

that both Powell and Rahsaari took with
them into this fusion venture was their
background. Both grew up in jazz families,
and Powell's father was a saxophonist in a
number of New York-based R&B acts. This
childhood influence is evident in the duo's
pace and style.
"The two American guys Rahsaan and
Kobie had a lyrical flow that was very much
how a musician would play the sax," Wilkin
son said. "He didn't just rhyme in rhyming
couplets and he didn't just stay on the beat
all the time. Sometimes he'd push it, some
times he'd be behind the beat. He'd weave
around, and that was very appealing to us.
"They both grew up in households where
they listen to jazz almost subconsciously. I
think they'd infused that into their own in
dividual styles."

on its performance quality as well as its stu
dio quality. Rap is notorious for being a con
