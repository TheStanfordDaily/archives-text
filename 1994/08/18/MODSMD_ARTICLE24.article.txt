## Eat Drink Man Woman 
### 
Ang Lee, director of last year's interna
tional success "The Wedding Banquet,"
serves up a delectable new comedy of food,
fatherhood, fornication and filial rela
tions. "Eat Drink Man Woman" is a
gourmet affair — a hearty feast for your
eyes. Filled with an abundance of sensa
tional Chinese dishes, this romantic yet
rueful celebration of basic human desires
reduces "Like Water for Chocolate's" im
passioned fiestas to a traditional Weight
Watcher's meal plan.
The opening scene is artfully crafted
(three world-class chefs worked full-time
on the production) and will make anyone's
mouth water as master chef Tao Chu (Si
hung Lung) showcases his culinary exper
tise in cooking Sunday dinner for his three
adult daughters who live at home.
Jia-Jen (Kuei-Mei-Yang) is an old maid
high school chemistry teacher who clings
to notions of a past love affair; Jia-Chien
(Chien-Lien Wu) is a fiercely independent
corporate airline executive who is the
most emotionally estranged from her fa
ther; and Jia-Ning (Yu-Wen Wang) is a 20-
year-old fast food employee and hopeless
romantic.
Mr. Chu's wizardry, however, is limited
only to the realm of the kitchen as his
daughters term his exquisite cuisine the
"Sunday torture ritual."
Director and screenwriter Lee establish
es that trouble has been brewing for quite
some time in the Chu family as tension runs
exceedingly high. Eventually everything
boils over. Aging Mr. Chu complains of los
ing his taste buds, but symbolically it is his
taste for life that is degenerating.
With a few sprinkles of wry comedic
gestures like the young collegiate reading
Dostoyevsky and remarking "love is suf
fering," Lee playfully tantalizes our al
ready whet palates. Fond of employing
food as a metaphor for life, Lee explores
the problems of living in the metropolis of
Taipei and concurrently adhering to cus
tomary family duties.
Mr. Chu argues that old Chinese
recipes are being mixed up like "rivers
flowing into a sea of one flavor" subtly
portraying traditional cooking as an en
dangered art. Accordingly, his modern
daughters, who remain at home governed
by Chinese social mores and filial respon
sibilities are becoming mixed up in affairs
of their own and threaten to leave the nest
for good.
Lee garners humor from the most awk

ward and unexpected of situations. "Eat
Drink Man Woman" depicts what it is to
have a balanced life exemplified by sam
pling various dishes and what it is to com
municate through action rather than
words. Wonderfully audacious at times,
each character's separate story illustrates
the film's title. "Food and sex," says Mr.
Chu are the "basic human desires, you
can't avoid them."
"Eat Drink Man Woman" is a fulfilling
banquet, both entertaining and heart
warming. Go with a big appetite. Bon Ap
petit.
