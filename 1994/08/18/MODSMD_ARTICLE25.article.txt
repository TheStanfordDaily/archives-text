Whit Stillman's new film "Barcelona"
benefits from not only the witty repartee
of two American cousins but also the cul
tural richness of the Catalan capital
Barcelona. Stillman, director of "Metro
politan" which was set in New York City
utilizes intellectual banter to create a bril
liant comedy.
The Cathedral of the old city serves as a
backdrop along with brightly lit boule
vards replete with "Trade Fair girls" for
two American cousins. One an ROTC
Navy man and the other a sincere and ar
dent yuppie obsessed with the "culture of
sales" embark on a quest for romance.
Ted (Taylor Nichols) is the "goody
goody" who engages in Bible-dancing —
stepping to swing music while reading the
Old Testament. Fred (Chris Eigeman) is
the Navy's advance man for the forthcom
ing Sixth Fleet.
Fred arrives uninvited and on short no
tice. He begins borrowing money and
overstays his welcome. Both characters
are quite self-aware but neither has a true
handle on reality. With anti-American
sentiment at a high the two attempt to dis
pel the "fascist" stereotype the Spaniards
have of Americans.
The cultural differences result in an
abundance of miscommunications. Fred
absurdly attempts to cross out some Span
ish graffiti with a felt-tip pen and ends up
changing "Yankee pigs" to "Yankee deers."
A local Spanish journalist who entertains a
group of Spanish women he describes as
"perfecto" expounds on the "AFL-CIA."
The two cousins have long-standing
differences that date back to a childhood
incident involving a kayak.
Amidst the Spanish milieu Stillman
captures moments of genuine humor and
real danger. Fred's habit of procuring
money that doesn't belong to him lands
him in a Spanish hospital. But through
out, all his character's misadventures the
sophomore director presents his story in

an understated fashion which remains
light but has serious undertones.
Fred may seem boorish and Ted insuf
ferable, yet it is worth it to tag-along with
them on their adventures through
"Barcelona." Stillman's cerebral comedy
perhaps mirrors his own search. He mar
ried a woman from Barcelona and his two
daughters were born there.

Fred (Chris Eigeman), in a fit of abscent-minded self-awareness, worries about the
complexities of shaving in director Whit Stillman's "Barcelona."
