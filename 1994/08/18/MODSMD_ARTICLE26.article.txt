# Spanking the Monkey
## 
### 
"Spanking the Monkey" is a new film
on a rather old and serious theme. This
first film from David Russell powerfully
captures a muggy summer exuding Oedi
pal tension and most disturbingly incest.
The film is both authentic and convincing
with a believable plot and true-to-life dia
logue.
Raymond (Jeremy Davies) has just
completed his freshmen year at M.I.T.
with flying colors. But after winning a
much coveted internship with the Sur
geon General's Office family responsibili
ties call him home foe the summer.
His mother (Alberta Watson) has bro
ken her leg. She passes the time by drink
ing and is "sick" in more ways than one.
She has long since given up her own ambi

tions for medical school due to a deal with
her husband (Benjamin Hendrickson), a
traveling salesman. Dad spends much of
his time in and out of motels with other
women.
Russell does quite a bit with a low bud
get. The movie lacks the slick, glossed over
look of traditional Hollywood fare; Russell
effectively utilises unique camera angles
to tell his story.
What carries the most weight and is
most worthwhile though, is Russell's
bravery in fully capturing the onslaught
of tensions that plague Raymond. Not
only are his career and summer plans
being dashed by his father's orders to
"take care of his mother," but Russell con
vincingly fleshes out his relationship with
his old high school buddies who enjoy
some serious partying.
This is not another one of those feel
good-family-films of the summer, but a
bittersweet slice of American life that
most would rather avoid.
Without cliches and with humor Rus
sell strikes a chord that brings to light ten
sion between a dysfunctional family and
the people that surround them. This film
includes attempted, but unsuccessful sui
cide, self-loathing, and a dog with bad
gums who enjoys long walks. "Spanking
the Monkey" is only for the intrepid.
