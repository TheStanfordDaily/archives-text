## Editorial Editor's farewell Summer a time of experimentation and reflection at Weekly 
### 
FOR NINE WEEKS, we at
The Stanford Weekly
have made a sincere ef
fort to be all things to all read
ers.
We've kept you informed
about the people, events and
decisions shaping perceptions
of the Farm both locally and
nationally through our
Newslines, Features and cover
stories; offered our take on a
variety of issues on our Opin
ions pages; highlighted the
achievements of Stanford ath
letes in the Sports section; and
kept you abreast of local enter
tainment through Intermis
sion.
And we did it with a core of
young staffers, many of whom
had never written or edited for
The Daily before. Though neo
phytes at the start of the sum
mer, their experiences in the
news office have been by all ac
counts a rigorous baptism in
fire that all but guarantees
their ability to match strides
with staffers trained during
the regular school year.
Consequentially, we feel as
if we've published a magazine
that we can all be proud of. But
who's to say that you our read
ers don't feel differently.
One of the most sobering
lessons a student journalist
can learn is that objective news
reporting is in the eyes of the
beholder, that no matter the
thoroughness of the investiga
tion, there's a piece of informa
tion missed, a person who
couldn't be reached, a figure
that can't be collaborated, a
quotation taken out of context.
And at The Weekly, like col
lege — and professional — pa
pers across the country, this
has been a lesson learned the
hard way — over and over and
over again.
But much can be learned
from a lesson repeated. We
used the opportunity to take a
few risks in the hopes of push
ing our paper in directions its
never gone before. The lessons

of past volumes have taught us
to revere the wonders of edito
rial flexibility, story creativity
and a love for the written
word.
No, we didn't reprise last
summer's cheer leading or
how-Stanford-might-look-in
-20-years cover stories, but we
did attempt to give our longer
features and profiles a degree
of editorial savvy normally ab
sent from The Daily.
Of course with topics rang
ing from World Cup Soccer, to
Condoleezza Rice's Center for
a New Generation in East Palo
Alto, to the departure of Cecil
ia and Jose Antonio Burciaga,
it hasn't been difficult.
Nine weeks ago I said in my
editors welcome that, "an agen
da for all seasons," was what
The Daily and Weekly "seem to
be perpetually searching for.
Its an annual endeavor that
commences at the start of the
academic year and ends at the
close of the summer term . . .
only to immediately start again
a few weeks later."
The summer months at The
Weekly are also a time of intro
spection and regrouping. It's
the one time when the majority
of the paper's staffers can sit
back and reflect upon the
events of past volumes, as well
as think about the direction
the paper is heading in the fu
ture.
Hence our goals for the sum
mer have been two fold: to
push the editorial limits of a fa
miliar Daily envelope for the
edification and eryoyment of
our readers and ourselves and
to connect the spring volume
just ended with the autumn
volume right around the cor
ner.
I know I speak for the rest of
the staff when I say the pursuit
of both endeavors has proven
to be highly rewarding. Stay
tuned for more of the same
next summer.
