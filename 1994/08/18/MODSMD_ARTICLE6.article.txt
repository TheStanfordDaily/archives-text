## The
						politics of science 
### 
The secular world of
science and the sacrosanct
realm of religion do not rest
as far apart from each other as do
the North and South Poles. In
deed science and religion overlap.
Perhaps even more precisely, sci
ence has now become the new reli
gion of our technological age.
As with all other religions, one
should examine its fundamental
canons before faithfully subscrib
ing to its preachings. Like the
Church before it, Science is a
supremely social institution rep
resented and interpreted by the
people who are learned in its pro
nouncements.
All too often, science is accept
ed as an absolute authority. Ele
vated to a deity's stature, it's sys
tem of knowledge and general
laws are exalted by declaring,
"Science is objective!" But bear in
mind, science is not some great
body of truth separate from the
rest of society; it is a social institu
tion integrated and influenced by
the very people from whom it was
born.
Think of Galileo, remember Da
Vinci, look at Newton — all of
whom were as gallant as philoso
phers as they were as scientists.
And let us not forget Einstein.
Great thinkers of times past have
become immortalized by their
works, their discoveries. Their be
liefs have been laid out in text
books that are opened again and

again, studied constantly, wor
shipped as doctrine. As a histori
cal tool, scientific theory is a great
representation of each epoch's
ideology.
The most salient example is
perhaps Darwin's theory of evolu
tion by natural selection. During
the early-nineteenth-century,
Reverend Thomas Malthus wrote
"Essays on Population" in which
he introduced his famous law that
organisms reproduce geometrical
ly in numbers while the resources
for their subsistence grow only
arithmetically.
As a result, a struggle occurs
for existence in the human race.
Malthus proposed that by limiting
the number of the poor, the com
munity would be economically
bettered because the poor would
be hindered from creating politi
cal turmoil.
The ideological commitment to
an entrepreneurial competitive
hierarchical society is illustrated
when Darwin applied the econom
ic philosophy of his day to nature
— expanding "economic survival
of the fittest" to encompass all liv
ing creatures — not only capital
ists. Furthermore, Darwin's theo
ry of mating selection wherein
males compete with one another
for the prized female all too close
ly resembled the Victorian period
during which he lived. The male is
dressed elaborately in bright col
ors and is skilled in complex dance

rituals.
Apparently, science reflects
and is affected by present day prej
udices. This dialectical relation
ship that science and society have
is symbiotic, but I do believe that
science — to many people's dis
may — is the parasite's host.
Society has long been able to
appropriate from science ideas
that are suited particularly for the
maintenance and continued pros
perity of social structures of which
it is part. As a matter of fact, sci
ence is shaped by society's mental
ity. So closely knit and inter
twined in the fabric of society, sci
ence can only evolve and advance
at the rate in which society does.
But the value of science is not
completely undermined. Suffering
from modern ideological bias, sci
ence today is renown as a social
panacea. Many people cling to the
notion that DNA — our divine ge
netic alphabet — controls human
existence because human nature is
coded into our genes. Whether sci
entists can cure all or know all is
yet to be discovered. At the very
least, science like religion, provides
hope for those who believe. Bet ter
yet, even for those who do not.
