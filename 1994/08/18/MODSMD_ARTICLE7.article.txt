## Library privileges denied to non-SU affiliates 
### 
I HAVE FOR YEARS tried to
obtain full library privileges
to all of the libraries on cam
pus since the mid 80's. This is
when policy was made to restrict
library privileges. Some were
deemed free access; others closed.
Growing up around the Universi
ty I naturally gravitated to the
stacks.
My reaction to the restriction
was to obtain a job at the Bran
ner Earth Sciences Library.
There I enjoyed my stay. I could
not then and cannot now afford
to pay the annual $800.00 li
brary access fee. Unfortunately,

I was bumped by work study stu
dents. Which was fine, as I ob
tained a job at the Children's
Hospital at Stanford.
I was there over 40 hours a
week with "per diem" status.
This meant I worked full time
plus, with no benefits, all week
ends and holidays, making beds,
mopping floors, talking to pa
tients etc.
While working at the hospital,
I sustained a back injury. There
remain unresolved issues per
taining to my dismissal. Because
of this I am seeking restricted re
search privileges: an ID card (re

stricted), full library privileges;
an end to unfair harassment
from security on campus; a reso
lution of past work related is
sues; written apologies, and let
ters stating my exemplary per
formance. I run here and have
for years. I am a dedicated life
time student.
I have served as a caregiver to
developmentally disabled, and
terminally ill alumni and local
citizens. I spoke about the li
brary issue at the Palo Alto city
council meeting in open session.
After the meeting a representa
tive from the University told me

to go through the correct chan
nels at Library Admissions.
"There an individual could at
tain access," he said.
I went personally and wrote
many letters to many people.
Most people I found extremely
nice and helpful. However, thus
far I have received only negative
results. There is much more that I
can't elaborate on due to the space
limits. I will add that I am a gar
dener, musician, caretaker, con
struction worker, research enthu
siast, and personal caregiver.
