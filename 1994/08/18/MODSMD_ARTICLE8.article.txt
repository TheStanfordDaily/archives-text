# Staff Notebook
## Kyle Graham 
### 
I'VE RECEIVED permission to
write a good-bye note to the cam
pus, an honor generally reserved
only for departing editors-in-chief.
But since I'm leaving Stanford for a
while, and haven't the desire to use
The Daily as my bully pulpit once I
return, I've been granted special
leave, just this once.
Since I first arrived at the Farm,
through my tenure at The Daily and
in more informal routes I've seen
and learned a good deal concerning
Stanford's past, present and future.
And while I've learned to respect, if
not romanticize, the Farm's history,
and am optimistic concerning the
coming years, I am concerned about
the University's present.
In the last year, I've seen stu
dents project their personal and col
lective resentment toward an "un
caring" administration, all the while
ignoring the snowballing movement
among professors to install a new,
harsher grading policy — one which
will affect their lives at Stanford far
more than any administration ac
tion ever could.
I've seen graduate students, un
dergraduate students, administra
tion, faculty and staff fight to draw

ever more out of Stanford, seemingly
forgetting that for ever pint of spirit
removed from a subject, whether it
be blood from a patient or resources
from a University, a corresponding
amount of soul must be added.
These and a legion of similar dra
matic actions and lazy-flowing
trends uniformly point to a very dis
turbing conclusion. All told, it seems
that trust is in very, very short sup
ply at Stanford.
This lack of trust makes itself felt
in a million ways. While at Stanford,
graduate and undergraduate stu
dents individually focus on what
they can get out of the University —
in funds or other personal goals —
without any sense of the collective
good. Faculty, who think their young
wards are taking advantage of them,
overhaul the grading policy to elimi
nate "student abuses." The adminis
tration refuses to be fully open con
cerning their policies and agenda, for
fear that students, staff or others
will view their interests as threat
ened; this in turn leads to even more
paranoia on the part of those very
same students and staffers.
Perhaps this defensiveness and
lack of trust is warranted, but I

doubt it I don't really know what
caused this cycle to begin, but I sus
pect the lack of trust is traceable to
the fact that the collective entity
known as "Stanford," having grown
so robustly in the 19605, 1970s and
1980s, now believes itself to be in an
era of fiscal, spiritual and academic
retrenchment, an era in which it
must lick its indirect-cost, Loma-
Prieta-earthquake, end-of-the-Cold-
War-defense-funding, end-of-acade
mic-experimentation wounds before
progressing to a higher plateau.
Not to put too fine a point on it,
but this retrenching attitude in
evitably leads to the atrophy and in
fighting we see today. When the stock
market drops, smart investors gener
ally put more money into the market,
adding faith and trust into the sys
tem. But in Stanford's case, at the
slightest sign of trouble, the Universi
ty and its constituents pulled away
from the very things that made the
school successful in the first place —
openness, trust and freedom These
traits were replaced with no clearly
defined goals, no forward drive.
As a result, today's Stanford is
suffering from an identity crisis.
And students, faculty and the ad-

ministration are lurching in the
dark, alternating between fighting
over the pieces of Humpty Dumpty
and proposing illusory and contra
dictory routes out of the darkness.
Now, with the pause in Stan
ford's forward drive having turned
into a long-term hiatus, a good mea
sure of the trust of years past is
gone. Hopefully temporarily, I
might add; the University has gone
through and will survive much
worse than this. Perhaps the Casper
administration will soon set a tone
all its own for Stanford, leading it
away from the doldrums of main
taining its U.S. News and World Re
port ranking and toward a goal, any
goal, preferably demonstrating
more openness in the process than
has thus far been the case. I believe
this may very well happen, and
many of the problems I perceive will
likely evaporate as a result.
Yet two particular arenas give me
pause. A serious obstacle to multi
faceted growth is the current
crevasse between students and fac
ulty. The tone and tenor of the re
cent grading-policy debate demon
strated how far students seem to
liave sunk in the minds of Stan-

ford's teachers, and vice versa. This,
I think, will be a difficult — and vital
— span to bridge.
Most importantly, though, the stu
dents also have a large amount of
growing up to do. Students must re
main vigilant to protect their rights,
but they should also shed their perse
cution complex and the belief that the
administration is working in an entire
ly different direction than themselves.
Yes, there are differences be
tween the positions of many stu
dents and the route that the admin
istration has chosen to follow. But
namecallingand intimidation are
not the routes to a permanent, ten
able solution, and a solution driven
solely by one segment of the com
munity is not one which will with
stand the test of time.
Indeed, I suspect that two years
from now students will wish they had
focused their efforts on mending the
frayed threads of trust which link
them and the faculty, thereby thwart
ing the new grading policy, than fo
cusing upon mistrust and the illusory
bogeyman of an administration ready
to cripple student services.

1980s, now believes itself to be in an
era of fiscal, spiritual and academic
retrenchment, an era in which it
must lick its indirect-cost, Loma-
Prieta-earthquake, end-of-the-Cold-
War-defense-funding, end-of-acade
mic-experimentation wounds before
progressing to a higher plateau.
Not to put too fine a point on it,
but this retrenching attitude in
evitably leads to the atrophy and in
fighting we see today. When the stock
market drops, smart investors gener
ally put more money into the market,
adding faith and trust into the sys
tem. But in Stanford's case, at the
slightest sign of trouble, the Universi
ty and its constituents pulled away
from the very things that made the
school successful in the first place —
openness, trust and freedom These
traits were replaced with no clearly
defined goals, no forward drive.
As a result, today's Stanford is
suffering from an identity crisis.
And students, faculty and the ad-

ministration are lurching in the
dark, alternating between fighting
over the pieces of Humpty Dumpty
and proposing illusory and contra
dictory routes out of the darkness.
Now, with the pause in Stan
ford's forward drive having turned
into a long-term hiatus, a good mea
sure of the trust of years past is
gone. Hopefully temporarily, I
might add; the University has gone
through and will survive much
worse than this. Perhaps the Casper
administration will soon set a tone
all its own for Stanford, leading it
away from the doldrums of main
taining its U.S. News and World Re
port ranking and toward a goal, any
goal, preferably demonstrating
more openness in the process than
has thus far been the case. I believe
this may very well happen, and
many of the problems I perceive will
likely evaporate as a result.
Yet two particular arenas give me
pause. A serious obstacle to multi
faceted growth is the current
crevasse between students and fac
ulty. The tone and tenor of the re
cent grading-policy debate demon
strated how far students seem to
liave sunk in the minds of Stan-

ford's teachers, and vice versa. This,
I think, will be a difficult — and vital
— span to bridge.
Most importantly, though, the stu
dents also have a large amount of
growing up to do. Students must re
main vigilant to protect their rights,
but they should also shed their perse
cution complex and the belief that the
administration is working in an entire
ly different direction than themselves.
Yes, there are differences be
tween the positions of many stu
dents and the route that the admin
istration has chosen to follow. But
namecallingand intimidation are
not the routes to a permanent, ten
able solution, and a solution driven
solely by one segment of the com
munity is not one which will with
stand the test of time.
Indeed, I suspect that two years
from now students will wish they had
focused their efforts on mending the
frayed threads of trust which link
them and the faculty, thereby thwart
ing the new grading policy, than fo
cusing upon mistrust and the illusory
bogeyman of an administration ready
to cripple student services.

I'VE RECEIVED permission to
write a good-bye note to the cam
pus, an honor generally reserved
only for departing editors-in-chief.
But since I'm leaving Stanford for a
while, and haven't the desire to use
The Daily as my bully pulpit once I
return, I've been granted special
leave, just this once.
Since I first arrived at the Farm,
through my tenure at The Daily and
in more informal routes I've seen
and learned a good deal concerning
Stanford's past, present and future.
And while I've learned to respect, if
not romanticize, the Farm's history,
and am optimistic concerning the
coming years, I am concerned about
the University's present.
In the last year, I've seen stu
dents project their personal and col
lective resentment toward an "un
caring" administration, all the while
ignoring the snowballing movement
among professors to install a new,
harsher grading policy — one which
will affect their lives at Stanford far
more than any administration ac
tion ever could.
I've seen graduate students, un
dergraduate students, administra
tion, faculty and staff fight to draw

ever more out of Stanford, seemingly
forgetting that for ever pint of spirit
removed from a subject, whether it
be blood from a patient or resources
from a University, a corresponding
amount of soul must be added.
These and a legion of similar dra
matic actions and lazy-flowing
trends uniformly point to a very dis
turbing conclusion. All told, it seems
that trust is in very, very short sup
ply at Stanford.
This lack of trust makes itself felt
in a million ways. While at Stanford,
graduate and undergraduate stu
dents individually focus on what
they can get out of the University —
in funds or other personal goals —
without any sense of the collective
good. Faculty, who think their young
wards are taking advantage of them,
overhaul the grading policy to elimi
nate "student abuses." The adminis
tration refuses to be fully open con
cerning their policies and agenda, for
fear that students, staff or others
will view their interests as threat
ened; this in turn leads to even more
paranoia on the part of those very
same students and staffers.
Perhaps this defensiveness and
lack of trust is warranted, but I

doubt it I don't really know what
caused this cycle to begin, but I sus
pect the lack of trust is traceable to
the fact that the collective entity
known as "Stanford," having grown
so robustly in the 19605, 1970s and
1980s, now believes itself to be in an
era of fiscal, spiritual and academic
retrenchment, an era in which it
must lick its indirect-cost, Loma-
Prieta-earthquake, end-of-the-Cold-
War-defense-funding, end-of-acade
mic-experimentation wounds before
progressing to a higher plateau.
