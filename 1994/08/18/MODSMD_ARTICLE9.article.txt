## Street steps down from LaIR, becomes CE chair 
### Sona Sharma 
After shouldering the responsibilities as
the head of Library and Information Re
sources for four years, Robert L. Street will
step down from the post this fall.
Street, an administrator at Stanford for 32
years, will take over for Prof. Haresh Shah as
chair of the Civil Engineering Department in
the next academic year.
Provost Condoleezza Rice said she has
been impressed with Street's "ability to inno
vate and, in doing so, to give Stanford a lead
ership position in the area of Libraries and In
formation Resources."
According to Carl Gotsch, professor at the
Food Research Institute and chair of the Com
mittee on Libraries, the four years under
Street's leadership have marked a transition
and "integration of the library and the com
puter side of the University."

Gotsch said Street did an excellent job
under the pressures of budget cuts. He added
that Street managed to achieve the integration
of the traditional library resources with acade-

mic computing resources —
"the way things are going to
be in the future."
"The fact that it has hap
pened here," Gotsch said,
"under Street's leadership
is a tribute to his vision and
his foresight."
Street was asked to over
see the merger of Libraries
and Information Resources
in 1990.

In a recent press release, he talked about the
major achievements of his organization, one of
the most important being changes in Folio to
Portfolio, which will allow the campus to be
"essentially fully networked." According to

Gotsch, Portfolio will be made public this fall.
Street said he hopes the University will
continue to make investments in the network
ing infrastructure and technology that sup
ports teaching.
David Dill, professor of computer science
and interim chair of the Faculty Senate sub
committee on Administrative Computing,
speculated that since the information systems
in Stanford are undergoing a major overhaul,
Street was asked to commit to continue as
chair for the next five years. As Street was
eager to get back to teaching, he decided to re
sign, Dill said.
Street was unavailable for comment.
"Libraries and Information Resources is
leaderless now," Dill said. "Some reorganiza
tions are being contemplated, not necessarily
cuts or expansions. The reason is that he (Street)
had an awfully big job and it's not clear that
somebody else can cover that much territory."

Dill added that while future reorganiza
tions are possible, they will not be due to the
ongoing budget cuts. Possible changes could
include some shifts in responsibilities, person
nel or organizations to make the whole infor
mation structure more manageable, Dill said.
Four faculty members whose work ties into
the computer and information system on cam
pus — Profs. Boyd Paulson, Douglas Brutlag,
Dill and Gotsch— will consult with Rice and
University President Gerhard Casper on
these future changes.
Engineering Dean James Gibbons, on
whose request Street is taking the chair posi
tion, said he was happy to have Street in the
department and that he "will bring to his job a
wealth of administrative experience that has
probably never been equaled before."
Shah will not be leaving the department,
but return to teaching, sources in his office
said.
