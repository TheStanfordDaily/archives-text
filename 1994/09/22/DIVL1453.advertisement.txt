fast • creative • competitive
Our competitive
advantage is the ideal
combination of
smart, confident
people working
together to maximize
state-of-the-art
technology. We
expect, even demand,
that everyone
demonstrate
leadership in their
ideas and actions,
always with
unyielding integrity.
That means from day
one it is your right
and your obligation to
use your initiative.
Fast, creative,
competitive,
financially sound and
stable, with a leading
edge in every one of
our businesses --
that's GE, strong
today, positioned for
the future, and
looking for our next
generation of leaders.
