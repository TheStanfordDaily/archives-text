CONSIDER A
LiNquisTics Course
This Autumn!!!
Linguistics tries to understand the miracle of language. Why can a child
of four, who can't even add six and eight, still perform extraordinarily
complex operations in speech that the most sophisticated computers
can't? Why is it that all human languages have certain structural
properties in common?
What role does language play in differentiating people by social class,
ethnicity, and sex? What are the systematic differences between dialects
and other varieties of a language?
Here are some reasons why students find linguistics exciting:
• Students in introductory courses can be trained to do original research
• The data for linguistic investigation is all around you in daily life: in
cafeterias and restaurants, on TV, in party conversations, etc.
• Linguistics courses are intellectually stimulating and FUN
Try one of these courses offered this Fall!
