The Ultimate Experience In Laser Tag!
Q-ZAR uses the
technology of laser,
infrared and computer
science to provide the
latest in high-tech family
fun. Players are instructed
on the rules of the game
and are divided into
teams. The games begin
under the supervision of a
marshal, in a playing
arena filled with multi
media special effects and
music, but no one is ever
knocked out of Q-ZAR;
they simply have to
be re-energized.
