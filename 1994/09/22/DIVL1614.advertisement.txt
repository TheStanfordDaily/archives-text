"Not just tome of the best or mott enjoyable moviet that Warnert ever made; they're tome
of the best movie* old Hollywood ever made." (Stephen Whitty, San Jote Mercury Newt)
"(Thete filmt are) a shock and revelation....breezily adult, unashamedly my and free of
moral cant." (Richard von Butack, Metro)
Our festival presents films made at Warner Bros, in the final three years
before the Code. While the films are not always outrageous and racy, they
often are; and they have an undeniable freedom and vitality, a realistic
edge, and an unusual concern with serious social issues.
