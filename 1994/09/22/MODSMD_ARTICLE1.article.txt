and I love the institution and I

the merger of the clinical opera

Medical School and affiliated local
physicians.
The new vice president will be
in charge of all policy matters that
concern the Medical Center —
overlapping Korn's current posi

the Medical School's academic
areas and the faculty clinical prac-
