# Korn to give up deanship
## 
### Sarah Katz Editorial staff 
In the first administrative
shake-up of this academic year,
Dr. David Korn is stepping down
as vice provost and dean of Stan
ford's School of Medicine, making
way for University President Ger
hard Casper's newly created posi
tion of vice president for the Med
ical Center.
Korn — who will remain in his
position until Aug. 31, 1995 —
said he recognizes that Casper's
decision to implement change is
clearly "within his authority as
president."
But, he added, "I enjoy my job
and I love the institution and I
would have been quite content to
continue on doing my work. It
wasn't my initiative [to resign]."
The leadership shift comes as
part of major reforms at the Med
ical Center resulting from the re
cent creation of Stanford Health
Services (SHS), a corporate man
agement body which is overseeing
the merger of the clinical opera
tions of Stanford Hospital, the
Medical School and affiliated local
physicians.
The new vice president will be
in charge of all policy matters that
concern the Medical Center —
overlapping Korn's current posi
tion, which gives him oversight of
the Medical School's academic
areas and the faculty clinical prac-
tice but not of the whole Medical
Center.
Under the new system, the dean
of the Medical School and the chief
executive officer of SHS — a posi
tion currently being filled by Uni
versity Chief Financial Officer
Peter Van Etten — will report poli
cy matters through the vice presi
dent, while the dean will continue
to report on academic matters to
the provost. The move redefines
the deanship, making it a more aca
demic role.
Administrators were hesitant to
discuss why Korn has not been
asked to stay on in the position.
"I simply believe the new roles
and relationships require a new
lineup," Casper said in a prepared
statement. "The reorganization
makes it necessary for us to rethink
the deanship."
Casper said he believes the over
sight of a single individual is neces
sary to "provide the overall leader
ship that we need now," in a time of
uncertainty over national health

care reform and over changing rela
tionships within the Medical Cen
ter itself.
But the position of a vice presi
dent to oversee medical affairs is
actually not new, said Spyros
Andreopoulos, director emeritus of
the office of communications, who
worked with the Medical Center for
several years.
According to Andreopolous, a
vice-president position in charge of
the Stanford Hospital, clinics and
Medical School was separate from
the deanship for years, until then-
University President Donald
Kennedy decided to abolish the
post in 1985. In 1986, the title and
responsibilities of vice president of
the Medical School were conferred
on Korn to go along with his dean
ship.
The 61-year-old Korn said he
currently has no idea what he'll be
doing after he steps down next
year.
"I'm not retiring, I'm resigning
the position of vice president and
dean effective August 31," Korn
said. "I'm still thinking about my
options," he said.
Originally chairman of the
pathology department, Korn has

served as dean for 11 years, an
unusual length of a time in a posi
tion that most people typically hold
for about five years, Andreopolous
said.
People who have worked with
him said he is extremely well
respected in his field. "He's one of
the best deans in the U.S., and he's
viewed that way among many other
deans of medical schools," said Dr.
Charlotte Jacobs, the Medical
School's senior associate dean for
student affairs. "He's brilliant. He
just has a phenomenal ability to
p-asp and understand complex
issues, and he's incredibly fair and
wise."
Although Jacobs said she
"would never try to second-guess"
Casper's decision, she added that
she is sad to see Korn leave. "He's
made major changes — the diversi
ty program, attention to gender
issues — that have not gotten the
press they deserve," she said.
Andreopoulos and Jacobs both
spoke of the importance of Korn's
actions in bringing people involved
in clinical sciences into an institu
tion devoted primarily to basic sci
ences.
"He has just really taken Stan

ford and ... made it an amazing
clinical and basic research institu
tion," Jacobs said.
Casper has appointed a commit
tee of Medical Center officials to
help him to select a person to fill
the new vice-president position.
The six-person group will be
chaired by Dr. Peter Bing, a mem
ber of the University, Hospital and
SHS boards.
Other committee members are
Dr. Eugene Bauer, chair of the
department of dermatology; Dr.
Victor Dzau, chief of cardiovascular
medicine; and Dr. Robert Glaser,
former dean of the Stanford and
University of Colorado medical
schools, and currently director for
medical science of the Lucille P.
Mar key Charitable Trust and con
sulting professor of medicine at
Stanford.
The last two members of the
advisory group are Dr. Lucille
Shapiro, chair of the department of
developmental biology, and Isaac
Stein, president of the Palo Alto
investment firm Waverly Associ
ates, Inc., chair of the SHS board of
directors and a member of the Uni
versity and Stanford Hospital
Boards of Trustees.

chaired by Dr. Peter Bing, a mem
ber of the University, Hospital and
SHS boards.
Other committee members are
Dr. Eugene Bauer, chair of the
department of dermatology; Dr.
Victor Dzau, chief of cardiovascular
medicine; and Dr. Robert Glaser,
former dean of the Stanford and
University of Colorado medical
schools, and currently director for
medical science of the Lucille P.
Mar key Charitable Trust and con
sulting professor of medicine at
Stanford.
The last two members of the
advisory group are Dr. Lucille
Shapiro, chair of the department of
developmental biology, and Isaac
Stein, president of the Palo Alto
investment firm Waverly Associ
ates, Inc., chair of the SHS board of
directors and a member of the Uni
versity and Stanford Hospital
Boards of Trustees.
In the first administrative
shake-up of this academic year,
Dr. David Korn is stepping down
as vice provost and dean of Stan
ford's School of Medicine, making
way for University President Ger
hard Casper's newly created posi
tion of vice president for the Med
ical Center.
Korn — who will remain in his
position until Aug. 31, 1995 —
said he recognizes that Casper's
decision to implement change is
clearly "within his authority as
president."
But, he added, "I enjoy my job
and I love the institution and I
would have been quite content to
continue on doing my work. It
wasn't my initiative [to resign]."
The leadership shift comes as
part of major reforms at the Med
ical Center resulting from the re
cent creation of Stanford Health
Services (SHS), a corporate man
agement body which is overseeing
the merger of the clinical opera
tions of Stanford Hospital, the
Medical School and affiliated local
physicians.
The new vice president will be
in charge of all policy matters that
concern the Medical Center —
overlapping Korn's current posi
tion, which gives him oversight of
the Medical School's academic
areas and the faculty clinical prac-
tice but not of the whole Medical
Center.
Under the new system, the dean
of the Medical School and the chief
executive officer of SHS — a posi
tion currently being filled by Uni
versity Chief Financial Officer
Peter Van Etten — will report poli
cy matters through the vice presi
dent, while the dean will continue
to report on academic matters to
the provost. The move redefines
the deanship, making it a more aca
demic role.
Administrators were hesitant to
discuss why Korn has not been
asked to stay on in the position.
"I simply believe the new roles
and relationships require a new
lineup," Casper said in a prepared
statement. "The reorganization
makes it necessary for us to rethink
the deanship."
Casper said he believes the over
sight of a single individual is neces
sary to "provide the overall leader
ship that we need now," in a time of
uncertainty over national health

care reform and over changing rela
tionships within the Medical Cen
ter itself.
But the position of a vice presi
dent to oversee medical affairs is
actually not new, said Spyros
Andreopoulos, director emeritus of
the office of communications, who
worked with the Medical Center for
several years.
According to Andreopolous, a
vice-president position in charge of
the Stanford Hospital, clinics and
Medical School was separate from
the deanship for years, until then-
University President Donald
Kennedy decided to abolish the
post in 1985. In 1986, the title and
responsibilities of vice president of
the Medical School were conferred
on Korn to go along with his dean
ship.
The 61-year-old Korn said he
currently has no idea what he'll be
doing after he steps down next
year.
"I'm not retiring, I'm resigning
the position of vice president and
dean effective August 31," Korn
said. "I'm still thinking about my
options," he said.
Originally chairman of the
pathology department, Korn has

served as dean for 11 years, an
unusual length of a time in a posi
tion that most people typically hold
for about five years, Andreopolous
said.
People who have worked with
him said he is extremely well
respected in his field. "He's one of
the best deans in the U.S., and he's
viewed that way among many other
deans of medical schools," said Dr.
Charlotte Jacobs, the Medical
School's senior associate dean for
student affairs. "He's brilliant. He
just has a phenomenal ability to
p-asp and understand complex
issues, and he's incredibly fair and
wise."
Although Jacobs said she
"would never try to second-guess"
Casper's decision, she added that
she is sad to see Korn leave. "He's
made major changes — the diversi
ty program, attention to gender
issues — that have not gotten the
press they deserve," she said.
Andreopoulos and Jacobs both
spoke of the importance of Korn's
actions in bringing people involved
in clinical sciences into an institu
tion devoted primarily to basic sci
ences.
"He has just really taken Stan

ford and ... made it an amazing
clinical and basic research institu
tion," Jacobs said.
Casper has appointed a commit
tee of Medical Center officials to
help him to select a person to fill
the new vice-president position.
