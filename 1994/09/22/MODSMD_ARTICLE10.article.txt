## Clinton condemns Haitian violence More than 1,000 U.S. military police on alert to prevent future beatings 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Condemn
ing brutal attacks against pro-democ
racy rallies in Haiti, President Clin
ton said yesterday more than 1,000
U.S. military police have been
ordered to prevent the use of unrea
sonable force. Yet, he cautioned,
"The habits of violence will not be
shed overnight."
As Americans recoiled at pictures
of beatings by Haitian police, Clinton
said, "Such conduct cannot and will
not be tolerated."
American forces continued to pour
into Haiti and were expected to total
8,500 troops by the end of yesterday.
Clinton spoke after Defense Secre
tary William Perry and Gen. John
Shalikashvili, chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, tried to soften opposi
tion to U.S. policy from deposed
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
Aristide, after two days of stony
silence, thanked Clinton for taking
steps that will restore him to power
by Oct. 15.
He was welcomed to the Pentagon
with extraordinary fanfare, including
a 21-gun salute.
Amid harsh criticism, the adminis
tration scrambled to make sure there

would not be a recurrence of Tues
day's violence in Haiti, in which U.S.
troops stood by as Haitian police
clubbed civilians.
Clinton said that 1,000 U.S. mili
tary police were on alert to monitor
Haitian police "and by their own
presence help to deter violence."
"The situation in Haiti will not
change immediately but today is bet
ter than yesterday and yesterday was
better than the day before," Clinton
said. "We will keep going. We will
make steady progress. We will
restore democracy."
Clinton said that as Oct. 15
approaches, "we will also work to
moderate the conduct of Haitian
security forces without assuming
their responsibilities."
"We went into Haiti to help stop
the senseless, tragic terror that has
plagued the nation since the demo
cratically elected government was
forced from power," the president
said.
"The habits of violence will not be
shed overnight," he said. "But during
the coming weeks we will work to
help stop the violence, to begin the
process of reconciliation."

On the Senate floor, Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz., a former Vietnam
prisoner of war, accused Clinton of
being too soft on the Haitian gener
als.
"The American people's patience
is not that great," McCain said.
"What it argues for is an early with
drawal of United States troops from
Haiti."
By a 94-5 vote, the Senate
approved a resolution expressing
support for a "prompt and orderly
withdrawal" of U.S. troops and the
lifting of American and United
Nations economic sanctions on Haiti.
A senior military officer at the
Pentagon said the rules of engage
ment governing the conduct of U.S.
troops in Haiti have not changed, but
will be interpreted more liberally to
allow more aggressive action to quell
street violence.
On Tuesday, U.S. soldiers in Haiti
had said they were told not to mix in
any Haitian-on-Haitian clashes.
In a ceremony on the steps of the
Pentagon, Aristide closed ranks with
the United States on the agreement
negotiated with Haitian military
ruler Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras.
