# Russians march against Yeltsin

MOSCOW (AP) â€” Thousands of
opponents of President Boris
Yeltsin, including his former vice
president, marched through central
Moscow yesterday to mark the
anniversary of Yeltsin's decree dis
banding the Soviet-era parliament.
The protesters walked arm in
arm down a broad avenue to a
square near the Kremlin, where ex-
Vice President Alexander Rutskoi
and others called for mass acts of
civil disobedience. Some gathered
signatures for a petition demanding
Yeltsin's resignation.
The orderly gathering, a year
after Yeltsin's decree touched off a
parliamentary revolt that led to
street battles last October, illus
trated the limited strength of the

fractured opposition.
Crowd estimates ranged from
4,000 to 10,000. Smaller rallies
were held in St. Petersburg and
smaller cities.
Rally leaders said earlier they
did not expect a huge crowd in light
of widespread political apathy. The
improving economy also has
defused some of the public's frus
tration.
Rutskoi, a bitter Yeltsin foe wide
ly presumed to seek the presidency in
1996 elections, told the ITAR-Tass
news agency that he would not run.
"Until we pool our efforts and
create a mass public and political
movement, we shall not be able to do
anything," he told ITAR-Tass yes
terday.

Speakers included communist
leaders Gennady Zyuganov and Vik
tor Anpilov and former Soviet par
liament speaker Anatoly Lukyanov.
Sazhi Umalatova, a former Soviet
deputy, called for the restoration of
the Soviet Union.
"We are here to express our
indignation and pain over the
release of the decree that led to
bloodshed," said Tamara Sopozh
nikova, who was clutching a red
Soviet flag. "I'm sending my curse
at the anti-people president."
Ultranationalist Vladimir Zhiri
novsky did not attend, and at least
one hard-line group refused to par
ticipate, citing the opposition's
involvement in the unrest that
claimed at least 140 lives last fall.
