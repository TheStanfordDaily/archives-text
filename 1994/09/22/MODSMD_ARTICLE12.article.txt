Drug henchmen caught
MEXICALI, Mexico (AP) — A special group of
heavily armed federal agents raided homes used by
Mexico's most-wanted drug kingpins, arresting six
henchmen but failing to capture the three leaders,
officials said yesterday.
The six men in custody are underlings of the
three Arellano Felix brothers — Mexico's most
wanted criminals, accused of the slaying of a Roman
Catholic cardinal, the bombing of a major hotel and
a rash of bloody street shootouts in Tijuana.
The Tuesday raids, although short of their goal,
were a sign that the special band that reportedly
swept into Baja California on Sunday remains hot on
the heels of the notorious drug-trafficking brothers.
"We have had many ideas" about where they are,
Mexico's deputy attorney general, Mario Ruiz
Massieu, said on Tuesday as he announced a renewed

drive to capture the brothers. "What we have not
been able to achieve is their capture."
U.S., Japan negotiate trade
WASHINGTON (AP) - The United States and
Japan began a last-ditch effort yesterday to resolve a
series of contentious trade disputes. A top U.S. offi
cial warned that the United States was no longer will
ing to employ a "turn-the-other-cheek" policy in for
eign trade.
Lawrence Summers, undersecretary of the Trea
sury for international affairs, delivered a message as
negotiators from the two countries sought to strike
deals to avert the start of trade sanction proceedings.
The Clinton administration is pressing Japan to
open its markets in a number of priority areas ranging
from autos and insurance to government purchases of
medical and telecommunications equipment.
