# Industry Summit joins business and academics
## 
### Piers Henwood Editorial staff 
The 1994 Industry Summit culminated earlier
this week in the picturesque setting of Stanford's
Inner Quad, where about 450 senior executives
and scholars from 47 countries around the world
gathered to relax and unwind.
An annual event hosted last year by Harvard
and MIT, the summit emphasizes the latest tech
nological developments affecting prominent
industrial sectors such as aerospace, information
technologies and health.
Participants in this year's summit took part in
two days of conferences and "interactive ses
sions," designed to bring business people and aca
demics together to learn from each other.
The summit is organized each year by the
World Economic Forum, a group established 25
years ago by Germany's Klaus Schwab. Since its
inception, the World Economic Forum has sought
to provide a variety of means for corporations to
stay in touch with innovations in the business
world.
"Twenty-five years ago, I felt there should be a
possibility for CEOs to update themselves on
developing business trends," Schwab said.
Julie Meier Wright, California's Trade and
Commerce Agency Secretary, delivered a 15-
minute welcome address at the dinner, focusing
on recent developments which have made Cali
fornia an increasingly appealing location for
international investment.
Besides the "strategic advantage" of its location
between the Pacific Rim and Europe, Wright said
that California boasts a "people-wise" work force
which is "well educated and culturally diverse." She
added that California is committed to fail 1 trade, and

therefore opposed to protectionist policies.
"We in California see a two-way benefit from
exchange," she remarked.
Speaking later to a smaller gathering, Wright
— who attended the Stanford Advance Manage
ment College in 1989 — said that she has direct
ed most of her time in office toward eliminating
the perception that California has little interna
tional business appeal.
"[ln the past] California has had a credibility
problem on a global basis, because we were per
ceived as a bad place to do business," she stated.
Wright said that her administration has over
come this stigma with an assortment of reforms,
ranging from tax-cut incentives for international
businesses to improved worker benefits.
Now Wright is "taking the California story on
the road," visiting destinations around the world
in order to generate interest in the Golden State.
In her view, this role is ideal.
"Government has no magic, but it can facili
tate things happening," she said. "This adminis
tration has focused on being a good facilitator."
Participants in the Industry Summit attend
for a variety of reasons, according to Stephen R.
DuMont, the CEO of an Arizona-based consult
ing firm. DuMont noted that the summit pro
vides a unique opportunity to unite the often dis
parate worlds of business and academics.
"[The summit] creates a close relationship
between industry leaders and those in academia,"
he said.
He also added that the summit presents a use
ful opportunity to make contact with other inno
vators in the business world.
"One of the most valuable things I take away
from the summit," he said, "is an expansion of
my network of contacts."
