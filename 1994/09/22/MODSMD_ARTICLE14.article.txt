# Pro-life group sets eye on Stanford

### Sarah Katz Editorial staff 
The California chapter of Oper
ation Rescue, a national anti-abor
tion group, has targeted Stanford
for its "No Place To Kill" cam
paign, hoping to pressure the
School of Medicine into ending its
practice of teaching abortion to
students.
The organization, known for its
radical tactics, has chosen Stan
ford and UCLA — with two of the
state's largest and best-recognized
medical schools — as the first tar
gets in its latest crusade, a strategy
aimed directly at medical schools
that teach abortion procedures.
The group hopes to apply com
munity pressure through a picket
of the Medical School in late Octo
ber, said Jeff White, the state
director of Operation Rescue Cali
fornia. The organization has also
launched a letter-writing campaign
to David Korn, dean of the Medical
School, asking him to eliminate
abortion training from the curricu
lum.
Medical School faculty members
and administrators said the
group's activities would have no
effect on Stanford's practices. Cur
rently, the school only requires
that abortion be offered to resi
dents in the department of gyne
cology and obstetrics, in order to
comply with national regulations.
"It's a national standard — you
cannot have a training program in
08/GYN without that training,"
said Mary Polan, chair of the
department. "That does not mean

the doctors have to provide abor
tions, but we must provide the
training."
UCLA also teaches the proce
dure only at the residence level,
said Jonathon Berek, the vice
chair of UCLA's 08/GYN depart
ment.
White said he does not believe
the national regulations should
affect the Medical School's decision
to teach the procedure.
"There are plenty of medical
schools that don't teach it, and
there is the moral question: if it
was a regulation that said only kill
Jewish babies, would they abide by
it?" he said.
The Medical School is taking
some steps to lessen the effects of
any protest, Korn said.
"We've implemented a chain of
notification and communication
and command, making sure securi
ty is on board," he said. "I have no
idea what they are planning to do,
but I want to make sure there is no
disturbance of patient care ser
vices" or damage to research and
property.
Berek said the only action taken
at UCLA was to inform faculty
members and Dr. Gerald Levey —
who just took over the position of
dean earlier this week — of the
campaign.
Pro-abortion groups such as
Planned Parenthood are still dis
cussing appropriate responses to
the Operation Rescue campaign,
said Ellen Flamen, the Public Rela
tions Director of San Mateo
Planned Parenthood. Flamen said
that the group is considering a pos

sible counter-picket.
While the protest may not con
vince the Medical School to change
its practices, White said he believes
Operation Rescue's tactics could
influence the University.
"I'm already impressed by the
number of letters from Stanford
alumni on my desk — these are
big donors to the University. The
University has a lot to lose or
gain," he said, adding that the
group also hopes to send a mes
sage to other medical schools in
the country.
But some Medical School faculty
said the group's tactics will not
change the way they work. "There
is absolutely nothing in the world
that they could even conceive of
doing that could stop me from
teaching my residents to provide
our patients with a full range of
health care options," said Kate
O'Hanlan, a professor of gynecolo
gy and obstetrics at the Medical
School. "They are only going to
make fools of themselves."
O'Hanlan said the Medical
School teaches abortion to its stu
dents so that, as doctors, they can
give their patients a full range of
reproductive options.
"We teach [our students] how
abortion is done safely and respect
fully. We teach them when it is
done safely and respectfully. We
teach them to help women evaluate
the risks and benefits of the proce
dure in the context of their times,
as just another reproductive deci
sion a woman needs to make in
order to run her life," O'Hanlan
said.
