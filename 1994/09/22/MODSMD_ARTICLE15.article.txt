# Behind The Scenes
## 
### 
Jean Fetter
Fetter, best known for her
eight-year stint as dean of
undergraduate admissions, was
named "chief of staff' to Uni
versity President Gerhard
Casper four months after his
selection. Fetter was head of
the selection committee that
chose Casper as Stanford's
ninth president.
Still affectionately known as
"Dean Jean," her duties as
assistant to the president
include overseeing the staff in
Building 10 and heading most
of the offices formerly run by
Vice President for Public
Affairs Bob Freelen. His posi
tion was eliminated after he
stepped down in February
1993.
This is Fetter's second term
as assistant to the president —
she held the same position from
1977-80, during Richard
Lyman's presidency.

Peter Van Etten
Since May, Van Etten has
been on leave from his post as
University Chief Financial
Officer to lead the newly
formed Stanford Health Ser
vices (SHS).
As interim CEO, he works
with the board overseeing the
implementation of SHS, a
management body that will
merge and oversee the clinical
operations of Stanford Hospi
tal, the School of Medicine and
local physicians. He will retain
the job for six months to a
year.
After the blueprint for
reform has been implement
ed, Van Etten said the board
will work to develop a strate
gic plan for the future of the
Medical Center, struggling
with such issues as how
Stanford Hospital and the
Lucile Packard Children's
Hospital will fit into the final
overall plan.

Robert Simoni
Elected last spring as chair
of the Faculty Senate, Simoni
will be important in presenting
faculty viewpoints to Casper's
administration.
Simoni predicts that the dis
pute over ethnic studies pro
grams — which was left unre
solved at the end of last year —
will continue to be a hot topic
this year.
Although the senate's votes
do not directly change Univer
sity policies, its endorsement is
crucial to their success, and the
body deals with most of the
controversial policy issues that
arise throughout the year. Last
year, for example, the senate
passed a heavily-debated grad
ing policy which brought back
the F grade and tightened the
rules on add/drop deadlines and
class retakes.
Apart from his duties as sen
ate chair, Simoni is also the
chair of the Biology Department.

At speeches, press conferences and
Faculty Senate meetings, University
President Gerhard Casper is often
the only one we see or hear. But
behind the president's rhetoric are
people who have the responsibility of
seeing that things get done. From
negotiating the indirect-cost rate to
leading Board of Trustees meetings,
these eight people will be among
those making the most important
decisions at Stanford this year.

John Freidenrich
Freidenrich, who has now
served as president of the
Board of Trustees for two
years, lists many of the same
priorities for the board this
year as last.
Specifically, he said, one of
the board's top concerns will
again be the Commission on
Undergraduate Education,
whose findings are due out in
October. The board has been
tracking the commission's
progress since it began its study
last October.
Another important topic of
discussion for the board will be
the reorganization now under
way at the Medical Center.
Freidenrich said the Trustees
will be watching the shift to the
newly-formed Stanford Health
Services closely.
Freidenrich was elected to
the board in 1987.

Mary Edmonds
Edmonds' main responsibili
ty is enhancing the quality of
student life. All the departments
that affect student life — such as
Housing, Residential Education,
Food Service, fraternities and
sororities — report to her.
In the last year, Student
Affairs departments have been
heavily hit by administrative
budget cutting, which sliced
more than $1 million from the
Student Affairs budget. To
lessen the effects of cost-cut
ting, Edmonds and her staff
also spent time working on an
administrative reorganization
of her departments.
Though most of the final
cuts came from areas that do
not directly affect students,
the possibility of losses in stu
dent services had many upset
last year, and the general feel
ing of student resentment has
created a number of policy
questions that will be exam
ined this year.

Condoleezza Rice
As provost, Rice is Stan
ford's chief budget and academ
ic officer, with jurisdiction over
all areas of the University. The
newest member of Casper's
staff, she began her duties only
last September.
In the year that she has been
in office, Rice has spent a good
deal of time struggling with the
heavy-hitting issue of budget
cuts. Faced with the task of
slicing $18 million from the
University's budget in the third
round of cuts this decade, Rice
managed to cut $6 million from
this year's budget and will con
tinue to work on the remaining
cuts.
Rice, a political science pro
fessor, also served as a top aide
on former President Bush's
National Security Council.
Casper and Rice got acquainted
while she was a member of the
search committee that brought
Casper to the University.

Geoffrey Cox
Cox, who worked closely
with Casper as an associate
provost at the University of
Chicago, began his work at
Stanford in November 1992.
His original position, creat
ed by Casper during adminis
trative restructuring, put him
in charge of evaluating and
developing long-range finan
cial and academic policies,
including work on the Com
mission on Undergraduate
Education.
Since Peter Van Etten's
temporary reassignment as
head of Stanford Health Ser
vices, however, Cox has taken
over the majority of Van
Etten's responsibilities as
chief financial officer, finan
cial reporting and controls,
and facilities activities such as
maintenance, construction
and building planning.

John Raisan
The often-rocky relationship
between the Hoover Institution
and Stanford has improved
since Raisan took over as
Hoover director in 1988,
replacing W. Glenn Campbell,
the institution's head for 30
years.
The Hoover-Stanford rela
tionship hit a low point during
the mid-1980s when faculty
successfully stopped the Rea
gan Presidential Library from
locating on campus and sup
ported a movement to bring the
institution under "normal aca
demic governance."
Raisan has worked diligently
to improve relations since then,
and seems to have been suc
cessful. Four years ago, he was
appointed to the University
Cabinet — Stanford's highest
policy-making body which
includes the president, the
seven deans, the provost, the
director of SLAC and Raisan.

As provost, Rice is Stan
ford's chief budget and academ
ic officer, with jurisdiction over
all areas of the University. The
newest member of Casper's
staff, she began her duties only
last September.
In the year that she has been
in office, Rice has spent a good
deal of time struggling with the
heavy-hitting issue of budget
cuts. Faced with the task of
slicing $18 million from the
University's budget in the third
round of cuts this decade, Rice
managed to cut $6 million from
this year's budget and will con
tinue to work on the remaining
cuts.
Rice, a political science pro
fessor, also served as a top aide
on former President Bush's
National Security Council.
Casper and Rice got acquainted
while she was a member of the
search committee that brought
Casper to the University.

Geoffrey Cox
Cox, who worked closely
with Casper as an associate
provost at the University of
Chicago, began his work at
Stanford in November 1992.
His original position, creat
ed by Casper during adminis
trative restructuring, put him
in charge of evaluating and
developing long-range finan
cial and academic policies,
including work on the Com
mission on Undergraduate
Education.
Since Peter Van Etten's
temporary reassignment as
head of Stanford Health Ser
vices, however, Cox has taken
over the majority of Van
Etten's responsibilities as
chief financial officer, finan
cial reporting and controls,
and facilities activities such as
maintenance, construction
and building planning.

John Raisan
The often-rocky relationship
between the Hoover Institution
and Stanford has improved
since Raisan took over as
Hoover director in 1988,
replacing W. Glenn Campbell,
the institution's head for 30
years.
The Hoover-Stanford rela
tionship hit a low point during
the mid-1980s when faculty
successfully stopped the Rea
gan Presidential Library from
locating on campus and sup
ported a movement to bring the
institution under "normal aca
demic governance."
Raisan has worked diligently
to improve relations since then,
and seems to have been suc
cessful. Four years ago, he was
appointed to the University
Cabinet — Stanford's highest
policy-making body which
includes the president, the
seven deans, the provost, the
director of SLAC and Raisan.

Jean Fetter
Fetter, best known for her
eight-year stint as dean of
undergraduate admissions, was
named "chief of staff' to Uni
versity President Gerhard
Casper four months after his
selection. Fetter was head of
the selection committee that
chose Casper as Stanford's
ninth president.
Still affectionately known as
"Dean Jean," her duties as
assistant to the president
include overseeing the staff in
Building 10 and heading most
of the offices formerly run by
Vice President for Public
Affairs Bob Freelen. His posi
tion was eliminated after he
stepped down in February
1993.
This is Fetter's second term
as assistant to the president —
she held the same position from
1977-80, during Richard
Lyman's presidency.

Peter Van Etten
Since May, Van Etten has
been on leave from his post as
University Chief Financial
Officer to lead the newly
formed Stanford Health Ser
vices (SHS).
As interim CEO, he works
with the board overseeing the
implementation of SHS, a
management body that will
merge and oversee the clinical
operations of Stanford Hospi
tal, the School of Medicine and
local physicians. He will retain
the job for six months to a
year.
After the blueprint for
reform has been implement
ed, Van Etten said the board
will work to develop a strate
gic plan for the future of the
Medical Center, struggling
with such issues as how
Stanford Hospital and the
Lucile Packard Children's
Hospital will fit into the final
overall plan.

Robert Simoni
Elected last spring as chair
of the Faculty Senate, Simoni
will be important in presenting
faculty viewpoints to Casper's
administration.
Simoni predicts that the dis
pute over ethnic studies pro
grams — which was left unre
solved at the end of last year —
will continue to be a hot topic
this year.
Although the senate's votes
do not directly change Univer
sity policies, its endorsement is
crucial to their success, and the
body deals with most of the
controversial policy issues that
arise throughout the year. Last
year, for example, the senate
passed a heavily-debated grad
ing policy which brought back
the F grade and tightened the
rules on add/drop deadlines and
class retakes.
Apart from his duties as sen
ate chair, Simoni is also the
chair of the Biology Department.

At speeches, press conferences and
Faculty Senate meetings, University
President Gerhard Casper is often
the only one we see or hear. But
behind the president's rhetoric are
people who have the responsibility of
seeing that things get done. From
negotiating the indirect-cost rate to
leading Board of Trustees meetings,
these eight people will be among
those making the most important
decisions at Stanford this year.

John Freidenrich
Freidenrich, who has now
served as president of the
Board of Trustees for two
years, lists many of the same
priorities for the board this
year as last.
Specifically, he said, one of
the board's top concerns will
again be the Commission on
Undergraduate Education,
whose findings are due out in
October. The board has been
tracking the commission's
progress since it began its study
last October.
Another important topic of
discussion for the board will be
the reorganization now under
way at the Medical Center.
Freidenrich said the Trustees
will be watching the shift to the
newly-formed Stanford Health
Services closely.
Freidenrich was elected to
the board in 1987.

Mary Edmonds
Edmonds' main responsibili
ty is enhancing the quality of
student life. All the departments
that affect student life — such as
Housing, Residential Education,
Food Service, fraternities and
sororities — report to her.
In the last year, Student
Affairs departments have been
heavily hit by administrative
budget cutting, which sliced
more than $1 million from the
Student Affairs budget. To
lessen the effects of cost-cut
ting, Edmonds and her staff
also spent time working on an
administrative reorganization
of her departments.
Though most of the final
cuts came from areas that do
not directly affect students,
the possibility of losses in stu
dent services had many upset
last year, and the general feel
ing of student resentment has
created a number of policy
questions that will be exam
ined this year.

Condoleezza Rice
As provost, Rice is Stan
