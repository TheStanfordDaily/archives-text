Q. I'm sure you know
what it feels like to wake
up in the morning, look in
the mirror and think, "Yep.
It's another bad hair day."
(0.K., so you don't have any
hair. Just pretend you know
what I'm talking about.)
Anyway, this has been hap
pening to me with alarming
frequency in the last month.
I've heard a lot about the
cute guys at Stanford, and I
don't want this to set in the

way of my social life. Can you help me?
— nervous freshman
a 1. Try brushing your hair.
Try it again.
A3. If the brush doesn't work, you could have
a more serious problem. And you thought it
was just a bad hair day. You'll see people on
campus all the time who look like they forgot to
look in the mirror before leaving for class, and
maybe they did. But as you know from your
recent experiences, not all of these people
should be accused of poor hygiene.
If your roommate or your friend looks less
than perfect in the morning, don't necessarily
offer them a brush or a paper bag. They very
well could have a deeper problem that deserves
our sympathy and compassion. They could have
'acquired uncombable hair.'
This documented medical condition results
in "hair that is impossible to comb or manage,"
according to a letter in the August 1993 issue of
the American Medical Association's Archives of
Dermatology.
More than 50 cases of uncombable hair have
been reported since its original documentation
in 1973. Even though this condition usually
develops in children between the ages of three
and 12, doctors at the Cleveland Clinic Founda
tion in Cleveland, Ohio recently described the
first case of uncombable hair in an adult. This
adult case proves that it is not out of the ques
tion for you or your fellow students to be suf
fering from the disease.
Hair grows from a follicle, or tiny pit, in the
skin. Hair shafts normally consist of a spongy
core known as the medulla. The core is sur
rounded by long thin fibers, called the cortex.
These fibers are covered by the cuticle, an outer
layer of overlapping cells.
Microscope photographs of healthy hair
show relatively circular cross sections. Uncom
bable hair, however, displays lengthwise groov
ing of the hair shafts. When viewed beneath an
electron microscope, the uncombable hair has a

r Bug
triangular cross section.
Here's a short quiz to deter
mine if you are truly afflicted with
uncombable (or unbrushable, as
the case may be) hair.
1. Does your hair appear "wild
ly disordered?" (even after fight
ing it with hair spray and

mousse?)
2. Does it "stand straight out
from the scalp?"(even if it's more
than an inch long?)
3.1 sit "extremely resistant to
combing?" (even with those black
plastic unbreakable combs?)
4. Does your hair have a "span
gled appearance"? (does it glitter
or sparkle even without a healthy
dose of Wet-n-Wild Prom Looks
Glitter Spray?)
All of these questions describe
symptoms of uncombable hair as

described in the AMA report. If
you answered 'yes' to one or more
of these questions, it is very possi
ble that your apparent bad hair
days are rooted in a deeper prob
lem.
The Science Bag
P.S Uncombable hair is a condi
tion separate from brittle hair
(which breaks easily), very dry
hair (from extensive use of hot
curlers), or hairballs (which hap
pen when you don't vacuum your
carpet).
