## A Hairy Matter

Q. I'm sure you know
what it feels like to wake
up in the morning, look in
the mirror and think, "Yep.
It's another bad hair day."
(0.K., so you don't have any
hair. Just pretend you know
what I'm talking about.)
Anyway, this has been hap
pening to me with alarming
frequency in the last month.
I've heard a lot about the
cute guys at Stanford, and I
don't want this to set in the

way of my social life. Can you help me?

a more serious problem. And you thought it
was just a bad hair day. You'll see people on
campus all the time who look like they forgot to
look in the mirror before leaving for class, and
maybe they did. But as you know from your
recent experiences, not all of these people
should be accused of poor hygiene.
If your roommate or your friend looks less
than perfect in the morning, don't necessarily

our sympathy and compassion. They could have
'acquired uncombable hair.'
This documented medical condition results
in "hair that is impossible to comb or manage,"
according to a letter in the August 1993 issue of
the American Medical Association's Archives of
Dermatology.
More than 50 cases of uncombable hair have
been reported since its original documentation
in 1973. Even though this condition usually
develops in children between the ages of three
and 12, doctors at the Cleveland Clinic Founda
tion in Cleveland, Ohio recently described the
first case of uncombable hair in an adult. This
adult case proves that it is not out of the ques
tion for you or your fellow students to be suf
fering from the disease.
Hair grows from a follicle, or tiny pit, in the
skin. Hair shafts normally consist of a spongy
core known as the medulla. The core is sur
rounded by long thin fibers, called the cortex.
These fibers are covered by the cuticle, an outer
layer of overlapping cells.
Microscope photographs of healthy hair
show relatively circular cross sections. Uncom
bable hair, however, displays lengthwise groov
ing of the hair shafts. When viewed beneath an
electron microscope, the uncombable hair has a
