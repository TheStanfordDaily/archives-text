# Area faults may connect beneath Bay

Located above the San Andreas
fault system, Stanford lies in sun
shine and the shade of palm trees ...
the only serpent in the paradise of
California is the threat of earthquakes
from earth's crust moving below.
And, if the work of two Stanford
researchers corroborates their theo
ries, this "snake in the grass" may
have more far-reaching consequences
than we know.
Simon Klemperer, associate profes
sor of geophysics, and John Hole, doc
toral student in the Geophysics
Department, were part of a research
team that recently found evidence for
a horizontal fault that may links fault
systems to the east and west of San
Francisco Bay.
The Bay Area rests on the active
boundary between the Pacific and
North American plates; this boundary
is widely known as the San Andreas
fault. The San Andreas fault in the
west joins the Hayward and the Calav
eras faults in the east to form part of
the Bay Area fault system.
The fault motion in the Bay Area,
therefore, is not completely caused by
the San Andreas, but is spread over
the East Bay faults as well.
Hole and Klemperer's research
team believed that the presence of
active faults on both sides of the Bay
indicated a possible link between the
faults.
"If we have ... motion on the San
Andreas and ... motion on the Hay
ward, somewhere at depth we think
we have a single plate boundary,"
Hole said. "The question is how are
these faults linked, and how does the
stress get from one to the next."
Hole compared the relation
between East and West Bay quakes to
the act of bending a branch until it
snaps. "When the branch snaps at one
end, the energy released will affect the
reaction at the other end of the
branch," he said.
In this way, an earthquake on one
fault could increase or decrease the
possibility of future quakes on the
other side of the Bay.
The physical connection between
Bay Area faults, however, is still unde
termined. Scientists believe the faults
could go straight down into the
earth's mantle before they connect, or
they could join at a horizontal fault
surface before plunging deep into the
earth.
Using seismic imaging, Klemperer,
Hole and the research team found evi
dence that a horizontal rock surface
exists beneath San Francisco Bay â€” a

surface that may link the East and
West Bay faults.
The process of seismic imaging
involves discharging compressed air
in water. Onshore and offshore sta
tions measure both wave velocity and
angles of reflection and refraction to
determine the composition of subsur
face rock.
The team's seismic imaging
revealed a rock surface that strongly
reflected seismic waves. These waves
travel through rock like sound waves
travel through water.
The reflected waves indicated that
the rock surface may possess physical
properties different from those of the
overlying rock, and that the newly dis
covered surface may be a horizontal
fault that transmits stress between
East and West Bay faults.
Scientists do not know whether the
surface faults go straight down to a
homogenous zone where plates slip
past each other or whether they join
above the zone and travel horizontally
for a distance before continuing on
their downward path.
While the scientists were excited to
see signs that their hunch may be cor
rect, the nature of the newly located
horizontal surface is still unknown,
Hole said.
"We found a horizontal surface,"
he added. "We haven't proven motion
on it, and we don't know it's a fault."
The newly discovered rock surface
beneath the Bay exhibits different
physical properties than the overlying
rocks; these changes in rock type and
composition cause this surface to
react differently to stress. As a result,
the interface between the horizontal
surface and the surrounding rock
could very well be a horizontal fault.
Researchers are also studying the
composition of the newly discovered
rock to understand the past and
future of the Bay area fault zone.
The horizontal rock surface could
be a western extension of the ancient
rocks of the Sierra Nevada and the
Great Valley. Like the recently located
horizontal surface under the Bay,
these ancient rocks exhibit high seis
mic velocities.
The horizontal surface also could
have originated millions of years ago,
during the evolution of the triple junc
tion between the Pacific, North Amer
ican and Juan de Fuca plates. While
the junction is now below Mendocino
in Northern California, it lay under
the Bay area five to 10 million years
ago.
At that time, the Juan de Fuca
plate was subducting beneath the
North American plate north of the
triple junction, while south of the

junction the Pacific and North Ameri
can plates formed a boundary where
the plates slid past each other.
Since the junction has moved
north, the area beneath the Bay was
once the site of the Juan de Fuca-
North American subduction zone. As
the junction traveled up the coast, its
passage may have left a gap to be
filled.

"The most likely way [to fill the
gap] is for the mantle to upwell and fill
the gap," Hole said, adding that the
window could be filled by molten rock
rising from the mantle.
It is possible that the molten rock
upwelling from the mantle could
evolve until the most stable rock

are presently known, but the rock formation could be larger than
researchers have yet determined.
boundary will no longer be under
the San Andreas. Instead, the
center of the up welling rock could
move farther inward towards the
Hayward fault. Hole attributes
this theory to fellow researcher
from Penn State University,
Kevin Furlong.
Researchers are trying to find
a link between the San Andreas

fault (where the motion has
occurred in the past; and the Hay
ward fault (where the theory pre
dicts that most future activity will
be).
As the faults continue to devel
op, activity may decrease on the
San Andreas and increase on the
Hayward.
The newly located horizontal
region may be a weaker layer that
acts as a fault.
According to Hole, it may be
"the actual physical connection
between where the San Andreas

used to be and where the San
Andreas is going down into the
mantle, underneath the Hay
ward. "
Describing the primary impli
cations of discovering the hori
zontal rock surface beneath the
bay, Hole said that "people who
model relative motions of plates
and model how one earthquake
affects stresses elsewhere can
put this [new] boundary ia the
models to better determine the
effect [of earthquakes on other
faultsj."
