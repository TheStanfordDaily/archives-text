# 'We're expecting to see positive results'
## Testing underway for HIV treatment 
### Julie Sauer Editorial staff 
Researchers at the School of
Medicine are awaiting the clinical
trial results of a drug that may
help repulse attacks of the HIV
virus on the human immune sys
tem.
A lab run jointly by the hus
band-wife team of Dr. Leonard
and Dr. Leonore Herzenberg is
currently testing the drug
N-acetylcysteine, or NAC, for its
effectiveness in fighting HIV.
The drug NAC is approved by
the Food and Drug Administra
tion as a safe, non-toxic treat
ment for Tylenol overdoses and
cystic fibrosis. The current clini
cal trials may uncover a new use
for this already existing drug that
will help patients diagnosed as
HIV positive.
The Herzenberg lab observed
that people infected with HIV
exhibit low levels of glutathione
in the cells of the immune system.
Glutathione is the major intracel
lular antioxidant. The compound
absorbs excess oxygen molecules
(called free radicals) that are
products of cell metabolism.
"We accumulated a lot of lab
evidence that having low glu
tathione in T-cells decreases the
function of the T-cells," said Dr.
Leonard Herzenberg. "There is a
compound called NAC which can
restore glutathione levels in tis
sues and in body fluids."
Researchers hope that NAC
will slow the progress of Hiy by
restoring levels of glutathione
and preventing T-cell death. The
Herzenbergs expect to see posi
tive results from the clinical trial,
but they emphasize that they are
not testing a cure for AIDS. The
drug would merely slow the
progress of the virus rather than
reversing its effects.
Dr. Leonore Herzenberg
points out that — even though

the drug is not currently market
ed for HIV treatment — many
infected with the HIV virus have
already been taking the drug long
term and seem to feel they receive
some benefits from it.
Screening for the trial started
a year ago. Approximately 60
patients have since been admitted
to the program on a rolling basis.
Each group participates in the
test for eight weeks. The test
covers a short time period

because of the lab's difficulty in
obtaining funds; the trial is
funded by the National Cancer
Institute.
The test patients received
doses of NAC and the control
patients received a placebo. After
blood samples from the partici
pants are taken in San Francisco,
the Herzenbergs analyze the sam
ples in their lab at the Medical
School. By comparing the groups'
results, the researchers can deter

mine the effects, if any, of NAC in
suppressing HIV.
Regardless of the results, the
Herzenbergs will obtain valuable
data from the screening and the
subsequent trial. "Our approach
is to collect a great deal of data
that will be useful," Dr. Leonore
Herzenberg said.
The final trial will conclude in
November, after which the over
all results will be compiled and
analyzed.
