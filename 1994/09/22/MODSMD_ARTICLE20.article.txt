# Campus computing: a dummies' guide
## 
### Julie Sauer Editorial staff 
Deciding whether or not to
buy a computer is one of many
choices facing incoming fresh
men.
While even the Stanford
experts seem divided on this
question, most agree that stu
dents will be better prepared to
make the decision once they've
had time to check out campus
computing first hand.
Many campus facilities pro
vide computer services, and if a
student plans to buy a comput
er, the Stanford Bookstore's
Microdisc department offers
student discounts.
The Tresidder LaIR offers
more than 100 Macs and print
ing services, and Meyer Library
has a cluster with 40 machines
— both Macs and IBMs. Sweet
Hall, open 24 hours a day, is
equipped with 120 computers.
Half of the machines are Sun
Sparcstations and half are DEC
stations.
Each student residence also
contains a cluster with seven to
10 Macs, a NEXT station, and a
NEXT laser writer. There are
no IBMs in the dorm clusters.
Laser printing in the dorms
costs 5 cents per page, and the
cost is deducted from student
print accounts.
Sweet Hall currently does
not charge for printing ser
vices. However, a printing
charge may soon be levied to
decrease printing waste.
Students can hook up to the
Internet from their residences.
Ethernet, the fastest supported
connection on campus, is avail
able in Castano, Florence
Moore, Kimball, Lantana,
Roble, the Suites, Toyon,
Wilbur and some row houses.
Macs and IBMs both require
an Ethernet adapter. Residence

computer coordinators, or RCCs,
can obtain them for students
through Networking Systems
for a $50 yearly rental charge.
Purchasing an adapter will cost
about $80.
Students purchasing a com
puter can choose between a
Mac and an IBM. The optimal
choice varies according to a stu
dent's field of interest.
"Overall, the Mac is the sup
ported computer on campus,"
said Jeff Townsend, consultant at
Sweet Hall. "For the humanities
student interested in word pro
cessing, a Mac is the way to go."
"If you're a computer science
student there are a few intro
ductory classes done on the
Mac. The CSIO6 series and
CSIO7 use Macs for program
ming. Above that CS uses
UNIX Workstations," he said,
adding that Macs and IBMs can
be connected to UNIX Worksta
tions with in-room connections.
Unless a student plans to do
extensive library research,
Townsend recommended a
desktop over a laptop computer.
Dave Moreno, manager of
the Bookstore's Microdisc
department, noted advantages
and disadvantages to both
desktop and laptop computers,
but he agrees that most stu
dents would choose a desktop.
"You get more computer for
your money," he said. Prices
range from $1000 to $5000 for
a basic system.
According to Moreno, "the
Stanford community dictates
Macs. A lot of graduate schools
use IBMs, but most undergrads
go with Macs."
Townsend agreed, making
another distinction.
"A Mac is for someone who
wants to use their computer as
a tool," he said. "An IBM is for
someone who wants to control
what their computer does."
