## Traditional Big Game bonfire canceled again 
### Michael Slemmer Editorial staff 
Despite student disappointment
over the cancellation of the Big Game
bonfire last year, the traditional rally
will be missed again this year, and pos
sibly for many years to come.
"We still have to cope with the [Cal
ifornia] tiger salamander and ques
tions about pollution," said Dean of
Students Michael Jackson.
Last year, the bonfire was canceled
because of concerns that the salaman
der, which is thought to inhabit the
bed of Lake Lagunita, might be endan
gered. As a result, the Axe Committee
— which oversees and funds each
year's Big Game activities — replaced
the celebration with a giant laser show
on the side of Hoover Tower.
Axe Committee Chair Craig Zajac
said the only official decision so far
about this year's activities is that there
will be "no bonfire in the lakebed for
an indefinite time in the future."
The commission that studied the

bonfire's environmental impact,
along with University President Ger
hard Casper, decided that "extensive
research must take place before we
can have another bonfire there,"
Zajac said. "The problem is that
nobody has the money to do that
research."
Even if it is ever resurrected, the
bonfire will likely be scaled down, Zajac
said. "We know that there will never be
another 15-story bonfire like the one
two years ago," he said.
However, Zajac said he was optimistic
that some type of bonfire can be restored
in the future. "Even if it isn't big enough
to attract incoming planes, we can still
preserve the tradition," he said.
Meanwhile, however, The Axe Com
mittee must come up with an event
worthy of replacing the traditional
flames. Although the committee spent
thousands of dollars in preparing and
putting on last year's laser show and
corresponding rally, the event drew a
mixed reaction from students who
attended.

Student opinion will make the com
mittee's job even more difficult this
year: in last spring's ASSU elections,
the group's special fee, which in past
years paid for the bonfire and related
activities, did not receive the majority
vote it needed for passage.

We know that there will
never be another 15-
story bonfire like the
one two years ago."

Even so, Jackson said he plans to
work with the Axe Committee this
year to make the Big Game activities a
success. "Working together, I think we
can come up with an exciting program
that students will enjoy and appreci
ate," he said.
Although Zajac said he wants to

plan this year's activities before going
in search of money, The Axe Commit
tee is already working to cover the
approximately $29,000 in funding it
will not receive from student fees this
year.
According to senior John Hall, who
is both an Axe Committee member and
director of ASSU Sunday Flicks, com
mittee members will work as security
guards each weeks at Flicks. In addi
tion, ASSU Financial Manager Gabe
Lucas said the committee does have
some money in its reserves which may
be applied to this year's Big Game
activities.
The Axe Committee "has lost its
special fee a couple of times before,"
Hall said. "But it has always survived."
At this point, however, the commit
tee has not decided how it will
approach the loss of both the bonfire
and funding this year. "Most of the
students involved in the Axe Commit
tee aren't even on campus yet," said
Bursar Jon Erickson, who acts as the
group's staff advisor.
