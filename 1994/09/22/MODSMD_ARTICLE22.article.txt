# Brother, can you spare a quarter?
## Laundry prices increase by 25 cents 
### Jim Luh Staff writer 
Did you bring enough quarters to do your
laundry?
If you think you did, think again. Over the
summer, the price of operating the washers and
dryers in University residences increased from
50 cents to 75 cents.
Increased operating costs drove up the price,
according to Hal Sazzmann, president of Reli
able Laundry Service, Inc., a Glendale company
that is beginning its second year of service to
Stanford.
Even though the Mi6le washers and dryers
Reliable has installed are designed to operate
with less water, detergent and energy than tra
ditional laundry equipment, skyrocketing utility
costs have forced a price increase nonetheless,

Sazzmann said.
"If you notice the dramatic increase in water
and sewer rates in ... Northern California, they
have been absolutely dramatic," he said.
In addition, the increased price of laundry
reflects the higher cost of the Mi&le laundry
equipment Reliable has installed, Sazzmann
said.
The state-of-the-art Miele washers and dry
ers also cost more to purchase and install than
traditional laundry equipment, Sazzmann said.
"The cost of ... the super-conservation
machine is three times that of a domestic top
loader," he said.
The price increase was part of the proposal
Reliable submitted to the University when it was
competing for the service contract last year,
Sazzman added.
No further price increases are planned in the

immediate future, he said, adding, however, that
may change if utility costs continue rising.
Housing and Dining Services Assoc. Director
Rodger Whitney said all the service proposals the
University considered last year provided for
some price increase. He did point out, however,
that even after the increase, laundry prices are
still lower than what one might find at a local
laundromat.
The increase in the cost of operating the laun
dry machines has brought Stanford in line with
prices at comparable institutions, according to
students at other private colleges.
At Harvard and Yale Universities, for exam
ple, washers and dryers each cost 75 cents to
operate. At MIT, washers cost 75 cents to oper
ate, and 25 cents will buy about 18 minutes of
drying time â€” bringing the cost of a typical 54-
minute drying cycle to 75 cents.
