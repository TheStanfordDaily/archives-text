# Nobel laureate chemist Pauling dies at age 93
## 
### Scott Van Winkle Staff writer 
As one of the Stanford com
munity's most outspoken and
influential members, chemist
Linus Pauling left a tremendous
void to fill when he died this
summer at the age of 93.
The pioneering researcher and
political activist, whose career
spanned the century, won one
Nobel Prize for chemistry and
another for peace. He campaigned
against nuclear testing and war in
general, arousing opposition from
Sen. Joseph McCarthy and the
U.S. State Department, while his
research in chemical bonding
earned him the respect of scien
tists worldwide.
Pauling spent only a fraction
of his 60-year career at Stanford,
serving as professor emeritus
from 1969 to 1973. After he
retired from Stanford, though,
he founded the Pauling Institute
of Science and Medicine in Palo
Alto, from which he continued to
conduct research into his 80s.
Stanford professor emeritus
and Nobel laureate Henry Taube
remembers the universal excite
ment created by Pauling's arrival
in the Chemistry Department.
"Everybody in the depart
ment admires him," he said.
"Most scientists are somewhat
retiring when it comes to public
issues, but not Linus."
Pauling became widely
known in the 1970s for advocat
ing large doses of Vitamin C in
order to boost the immune sys
tem, but his career as a public
figure began some 20 years earli
er, at the height of the Cold War.
In 1949, he helped organize a
Congress for Peace in Mexico
City, which brought together
such luminaries as W. E. B.
Dußois, Charlie Chaplin and for
mer U.S. Assistant Attorney
General 0. John Rogge.
A year later, he joined in a
"peace crusade" that prefigured
the anti-war movement of the
Vietnam era Pauling continued
to campaign for peace through
out the 1950s and 19605, circu

lating a petition eventually
signed by 11,021 scientists
opposed to nuclear testing.
Such activity prompted the
State Department to deny him a
passport in 1952.
That decision may have
affected Pauling's scientific
career more than his political
one. At the time, Pauling was on
the way to discovering the pre
cise chemical structure of DNA
— perhaps the most important

scientific dis
covery of the
century, even
tually made by
James Watson
and Francis
Crick in 1953.
Without a
passport, Paul
ing was pre
vented from

attending a London conference
on the structure of proteins that
could have added to his own pro
tein research.
Despite the setback, Pauling's
work across the scientific spec
trum made him "one of the great
scientists of all time," Taube
said. Pauling pioneered the idea
that the irregular formation of
molecules can cause disease,
such as sickle-cell anemia, as
well as essentially creating the
concept of resonance, or internal
vibration, in molecular bonds.
Pauling earned a bachelor of
science degree from the Oregon
Agricultural College in 1922,
without having completed high
school. Two years later, at the
age of 23, he received his doctor
ate from Caltech.
At 30, a full professor at Cal
tech, he published his landmark
work, "The Nature of the Chem
ical Bond."
Pauling died of cancer Aug.
19 at his ranch in Big Sur, Calif.
Surviving him are three sons,
Peter of Wales, Linus Jr. of Hon
olulu, and Crellin of Portola Val
ley, Calif.; a daughter, Linda
Pauling Kamb of Pasadena; a
sister, Pauline Emmett of Salt
Lake City; 15 grandchildren and
19 great-grandchildren.
