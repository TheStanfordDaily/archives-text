# Students organize frosh trips

### Michael Slemmer Editorial staff 
Bouncing back from complaints about
last year's freshman orientation trips, the
REDWOOD wilderness trip program will
again help new students become acquaint
ed with the people who will likely be their
friends for the next four years.
According to junior Nathan Gove, one
of the program's directors and founders,
this year's trips, may avoid some of the
problems which REDWOOD encountered
last year. The trips will be held the week
end of Oct. 7.
"We've made two significant changes
that we think will make it a better all
around program," he said.
The first major alteration is the
removal of the community service trips,
which last year drew the majority of stu
dent complaints, Gove said.
In addition, there will be four graduate
student trips this year, alongside with the
11 undergraduate trips already planned.
"We're trying to broaden the number of
people that we cater to," Gove said.
Much like in last year's wilderness pro
grams, each trip will be led by three people.
The trip leaders are required to have out
doors experience and training before head

ing up the orientation trips, Gove said.
The trippers will go to a variety of
wilderness locations along the coast as
well as inland. "We tried to create trips
which will appeal to as many people as
possible," he said.
Unlike last year's trips — which were
advertised through mailings to all of the
incoming freshmen — information about
the trips will not be given to students until
they get on campus, because of layoffs in
the administration which affected RED
WOOD'S status on campus, Gove said.

"We're planning on setting up a wan
dering backpack brigade, with people also
in White Plaza giving out information" he
said, adding his hope that sign-ups will
not decline compared to last year.
"Despite negative publicity in the past,
I think we've been doing a good job and
that people really want this," Gove said.
"Orientation introduces people to cam
pus, but some people don't meet lots of
long-lasting friends during orientation.
"We're just trying to create an alter
nate way to get to know folks," he said.
