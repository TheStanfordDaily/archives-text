# Disaster averted
## Stanford workers sign contract with University 
### Scott Van Winkle Staff writer 
After four days of intensive negotia
tion to avert a strike the week that
freshmen arrive on campus, University
officials and labor representatives Mon
day agreed upon a new contract for the
University's maintenance and food ser
vice workers.
The contract guarantees a 2.5 per
cent increase in wages over each of the
next three years, increasing the cost of
labor to about $50 million per year, said
Mike Vartain, the University's chief
negotiator.
Vartain would not speculate as to
how the new costs would affect the Uni
versity's budget, but he said it would
bring "stability and predictability" to
the budget-planning process.
Negotiators for United Stanford
Workers, which represents 1,200 cam
pus laborers, said in a statement that
they were also pleased with the out
come. Union members ratified the con
tract by a 10-to-l margin in a vote Tues
day.
Vartain said no single issue dominat
ed the talks, which extended over the
weekend and concluded Monday. The
University's contract had simply run
out, and both sides had differing plans
to improve it, he said.
The workers' previous three-year
contract called for renegotiation by
Aug. 30, but meetings between labor

and management could not bridge dis
putes in several areas, including health
benefits, pensions and grievance proce
dure, Vartain said. The contract was
extended by 18 days to give negotiators
more time.
Vartain said the University agreed to
only one extension, which ran out Sun
day at midnight. As negotiations
extended to 10 hours a day, the pressure
was "at times, intense," he said.
In the end, both management and
labor came away touting the conces
sions made by the other side.
Labor leaders hailed the wage
increase and improved health coverage
for employees' children.
The union estimates single parents
will save $25 to $80 per month under
the new benefits.
The union had sought to guarantee
that the University would not reduce
the size of the work force for the dura
tion of the contract, a proposal the Uni
versity succeeded in resisting, Vartain
said.
While both sides came away pleased
and speaking of improved relations, nei
ther would promise that labor troubles
were at an end.
"Negotiations are always a struggle,"
union representative Jon Showalter
said.
A similar last-minute agreement
ended a strike that had threatened to
disrupt the University's Centennial Cel
ebration in 1991.
