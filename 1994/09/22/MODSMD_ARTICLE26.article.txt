# Basketball player arrested on charges of stealing furniture
## 
### Shirley Park Staff writer 
Stanford basketball player James Dar
ren Allaway, apprehended by Stanford
police earlier this month for allegedly tak
ing a couch and other furniture from Casa
Zapata, was charged with first-degree bur
glary Sept. 7.
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer
said that the crime "doesn't make a whole
lot of sense" as the suspect may have jeop
ardized his academic and athletic careers
for "a stupid couch."
Allaway is free on bail, and Niemeyer
said he expects Allaway's arraignment to be
held when the junior returns to campus for
fall quarter.
Athletic director Ted Leland said All

away will be subject to standard University
procedure, and then "we'll sit down and
determine what is the correct policy by the
Athletic Department."
Allaway and head basketball coach Mike

Montgomery could not be
reached for comment.
Leland said that All
away's arrest marks the
second time Stanford ath
letes have been charged
with a felony during his
three-and-a-half year
tenure as athletic director.
The first incident —
which attracted national

attention — occurred last spring, when the
George Segal "Gay Liberation" statue was
allegedly defaced by several athletes.

Although, according to Niemeyer, stolen
furniture is common enough during the
beginning of the school year, Leland said
the incident would still reflect badly on the
Department of Athletics.
"The publicity surrounding [the Allaway
incident] isn't good for us," Leland said.
"People have always seen the Stanford Ath
letic Department as being different, and
those incidents certainly make us look a lit
tle like other schools — and that's regret
ful"
Police were alerted around midnight on
Sept. 1 when a night assistant phoned in
from the Zapata lounge after seeing a "tall
black guy carrying the tail end of a couch
going around the corner out to the
lounge."
The night assistant, who requested

anonymity, said she was in her room in
Zapata with the door ajar when she heard
quiet footsteps down the hallway.
She then poked her head out of the door
and saw the couch being carried
outside.When she and a friend walked out
side, the couch was in the courtyard.
Earlier that evening, they encountered
the same man the night assistant had seen
taking the couch. The night assistant said
the man asked them if they knew where
"Cindy" was because he was helping her
move.
"He asked what we were doing," added
the night assistant, "Probably to find out
how long we were going to be there."
The night assistant said the man
brought his rental truck from the parking
lot and stopped it in front of Zapata.

Police stopped the truck soon after and
arrested driver Allaway on Escondido Road
shortly after midnight
The police seized a wooden coffee table
and a bookshelf in addition to the light blue
couch.
Allaway told the police that nobody else
was involved, but the size of the couch —
more than six feet long — led the police to
believe the crime was committed by more
than one person.
"We feel there is at least one other per
son [involved]," Niemeyer said, although
"we have not been able to locate any con
federates at all."
The night assistant said she never saw
the supposed accomplice, but confirmed
that "obviously there was someone else car
rying the other end of the couch."
