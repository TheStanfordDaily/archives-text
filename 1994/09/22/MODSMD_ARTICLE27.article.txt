# Stanford to issue universal ID cards
## 
### Piers Henwood Editorial staff 
Barring unforeseen prob
lems, the registrar's office will
unveil a new universal photo
identification card for Stanford
students, staff and faculty this
winter quarter.
The current practice, which
requires students to carry sepa
rate identification and meal
cards, will be replaced by a sys
tem that employs multi-purpose
photo cards, said Registrar
Roger Printup.
If all goes according to plan,
the cards will have increasingly
diverse functions in the future,
ranging from purchases at
campus stores to transactions
at Cowell Student Health Cen
ter.
The main problem remaining

is the sheer magnitude of the
project, which in Printup's esti
mation will affect approximately
24,000 people on campus.
"There has been more inter
est in [the new identification sys
teml than we anticipated,"
Printup said.
Specifically, coordinating the
various campus institutions'
divergent identification policies
has slowed the process.
"Many of the libraries on
campus have different policies
with regard to ID, and trying to
accommodate them has been dif
ficult," Printup said.
If current plans run smoothly,
students will have their pictures
taken for their identification
cards at various times through
out fall quarter. The new cards
will then be activated at the
beginning of winter quarter.
