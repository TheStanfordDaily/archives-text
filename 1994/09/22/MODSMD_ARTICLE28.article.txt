# Seven-week Palm Drive reconstruction completed
## $3.5 million project includes landscaping, curbs 
### Frank Guinan Staff writer 
Though Palm Drive has served for years as
the grand entrance to Stanford, the bumpy
mile-long stretch did not always leave a favor
able impression on those arriving on campus.
But forget the jokes about Stanford's sup
posed contract with tire companies: Palm
Drive recently received a full-scale face lift
when the road was reconstructed and re paved
over the course of seven weeks this past sum
mer.
With $3.5 million from the General Plant
Improvement Fund, the University hired
PAVEX Construction Co. to work on the road
which leads from University to the Oval and
the Quad.
Work on Palm Drive began on July II and
was originally expected to be completed on
Sept. 15. According to Stanford Project Man
ager Michael Kuntz, however, concerns about
overflowing traffic and logjams prompted the
University to offer a bonus of $2,000 to the
contractors for every day that they finished
early.
In the end, the incentive paid off — the pro
ject was completed on Aug. 26, 20 days ahead
of schedule.
Kuntz credited "efficient management and
thorough planning" for the early completion
date. He said that the contractors "were pret
ty aggressive on their schedule" and worked
10 to 12 hours a day instead of the standard
eight to 10 hours.
In addition to repairing of the actual road,
the contractors did some landscaping work
along Palm Drive, building a drainage system
and granite curbs.
Five new palm trees were planted to add to
the road's scenery. The trees — each costing

approximately $3,000 — are currently nine
feet tall but should grow to full height
Due to safety concerns for pedestrians and
bikers, the intersection at Campus Drive and
Palm Drive was also overhauled, and is now
marked by a four-way stop sign.
"There have been some accidents and near
mioses," Kuntz said. "Drivers weren't used to
the intersection and wouldn't look certain
ways.... It was a flaw in the original design."
So far, the renovations have been praised
on campus. "It is a very nice improvement and
long overdue," said Dan Gray, program assis
tant at the Alumni Association. He added that
for the amount of money the University
spent, he "would like to have seen the lanes
widened a bit"
Future work on Palm Drive will include
planting shrubbery, installing an irrigation
system and improving the lighting. The old
electrical system spreads the light out rather
than focusing it on the road, Kuntz said.
Pedestrian and bike paths will also be mod
ified. Though he does not expect work along
Palm Drive to be finished until Oct. 14, Kuntz
said the paths should be "usable" by next
week
During the reconstruction, the University
also took the opportunity to enhance the view
of the Main Quad from the road. The admin
istration had the Santa Clara County Trans
portation Agency move their bus stops —
which serve as a layover point for several of
the County Transit's lines — from the front of
the Oval to the side.
But Bill Capps, service planning pro
gramming manager at Santa Clara County
Transportation Agency, said the move was
"not attractive" from the transportation
point of view because it is inconvenient for
passengers.

Palm Drive was a maze of potholes and cracks (left) before this year's reconstruction. Construction workers repaved
and lanscaped the infamous roadway this summer, replacing curbs and four palm trees in the process (right).
