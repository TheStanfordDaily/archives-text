# From Gorbachev to hunger strikes: A little Farm history
## 
### 
There's always something hap
pening at Stanford. Whether it be
a speech by a Supreme Court jus
tice or an important medical dis
covery, Stanford shapes the
events of the country and world as
well as the surrounding commu
nities.
Here are highlights from the
past five years:
April 1989
The University Committee on
Minority Issues report was
released. The report compiled
statistics from interviews with
more than 1,300 students, docu
mented underlying racial ten
sions on campus and offered
more than 100 recommendations
for improving minority life at
Stanford.
May 1989
Police in riot gear arrested
more than 50 students after
protesters took over University
President Donald Kennedy's
office, demanding an immediate
meeting with Kennedy to discuss
multicultural issues.
October 1989
A devastating earthquake
measuring 7.1 on the Richter
scale rocked the Bay Area on
October 17. The Loma Prieta
quake — which caused $160
million worth of damage on
campus — was the largest in
the area since the 1906 tremor
that destroyed much of San
Francisco.

April 1990
Controversy over the invalida
tion of write-in ballots in the
ASSU elections prompted more
than 2,000 students to sign a peti
tion demanding a recall of the
"People's Platform" Council of
Presidents. Among the victorious
candidates was cartoon character
Bart Simpson.
May 1990
After a year of relative silence
about free speech, the Student
Conduct Legislative Council

of the Fundamental Standard
that outlawed discriminatory
harassment.

Soviet President Mikhail Gor
bachev took a whirlwind tour of
Stanford and delivered a historic
address to 1,700 students, faculty
and staff in Memorial Auditori
um.
October 1990
In response to the govern
ment's recently passed Drug-Free
Schools and Communities Act,
the University announced a new
alcohol and drug policy explicitly
prohibiting the unlawful use of
alcohol and drugs on campus by
students, faculty and staff.
Stanford became one of the
first universities in the nation to
extend married housing privileges
to gay and lesbian students. The
change in policy extended hous
ing, facilities and health-care ben

efits to the domestic partners of
gay and lesbian students, as well
as to partners of heterosexual stu
dents.
November 1990
A divided Faculty Senate voted
to revamp the distribution
requirements, placing a greater
emphasis on the study of race,
religion and gender.
March 1991
University President Donald
Kennedy and Stanford's indirect
cost practices took a heavy beat
ing before the House Subcommit
tee on Oversight and Investiga
tions. The event marked the cli
max of the controversy over how
Stanford charges the government
for the indirect costs of federally
sponsored projects.
April 1991
The Office of Naval Research
delivered a punishing blow to the
University, terminating nearly
100 accounting agreements, and
slashing Stanford's indirect-cost
rate from 74 percent to 55.5 per
cent.
May 1991
Stuart Reges, senior lecturer in
computer science, was fired for
carrying illegal drugs on campus
and buying alcohol for underage
students. Reges had written a let
ter to national drug czar Bob Mar
tinez admitting he carried and
used drugs to protest U.S. drug
policy.
July 1991
In the face of the indirect-cost
controversy, University President
Donald Kennedy announced his
resignation, effective August
1992.
October 1991
The University announced a
$43 million deficit-reduction pro
gram.
January 1992

debate and discussion in the
Stanford community that contin

senior employees at the Stanford
Bookstore enjoy a host of lavish
perquisites unheard of elsewhere
in the college book industry.
March 1992
Gerhard Casper, provost of the
University of Chicago, was named
as Stanford's ninth president on
March 17, following a highly
secretive, six-month search and

selection process that produced
667 nominees and was completed
three months before its deadline.
May 1992
Though his first visit was a big
ger event, former Soviet Presi
dent Mikhail Gorbachev's second
visit to Stanford was eagerly
anticipated by the community and
marked by an unexpectedly high
demand for tickets.
October 1992

been closed since the 1989 Loma

The University extended
spousal benefits, such as medical
insurance and access to campus
facilities, to the domestic partners
of gay and lesbian University
employees.
January 1993
The Cardinal football team
concluded a remarkable 1992 sea
son with a resounding Block
buster Bowl triumph and a No. 9
final ranking in the national polls.
With the team's 24-3 victory over
Penn State, the Cardinal posted
its best season since it won the
Rose Bowl in 1971.
President Casper proposed a
three-year undergraduate degree
option in an interview with the
San Francisco Chronicle, but

ter task force charged with devel
oping a long-term plan to restruc
ture the center and make it more
financially stable.
April 1993

"The Clean Slate," the only
slate placed on the Council of
Presidents election ballot, won a

landslide victory in the election,
restoring the COP after one year
in absentia.
About 70 people protested the
lack of an Asian-American studies
major at a rally in White Plaza,
which ended in a march to Presi
dent Casper's office.
During his State of the Univer

commission to re-evaluate Stan
ford's undergraduate curriculum,
including the four-year degree
and the distribution requirement
system.

Office of Multicultural Develop
ment, resigned abruptly. Her res

President Casper's policies on
multiculturalism.

Public Service was chosen as one
of a handful of universities
nationwide to participate in a
pilot program for President Bill
Clinton's newly unveiled national
service project.
President Casper appointed
Political Science Prof. Con
doleezza Rice, nationally known
for her stint on the National
Security Council, as provost, the
university equivalent of a vice

Provost Gerald Lieberman.
Casper also appointed Economics
Prof. John Shoven as Dean of
Humanities and Science. Shoven
replaced Ewart Thomas, who
stepped down to return to teach
ing.
October 1993

The B factory is slated for comple
tion in 1998.
President Casper's Commis

1968. The 19-member commis

James Sheehan, will announce its
findings next month.
May 1994
Members of Stanford's Chi
cano/Latino community, citing a
long history of disrespect and
inaction on the part of the admin
istration, initiated a hunger strike
in the Main Quad.
After three days of fasting and
protest, the protesters accepted a
settlement that called for the cre
ation of committees to examine a
possible ban on grapes, explore
the feasibility of a Chicano Stud

raise funds for a community cen
ter in East Palo Alto.
Eight Stanford varsity athletes
were arrested for vandalizing the
white "Gay Liberation" sculpture

are charged with misdemeanor
charges.

June 1994
Despite national debate and
student protests, the Faculty Sen
