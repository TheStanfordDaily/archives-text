# Hearing set in felony vandalism cases
## Athletes charged with defacing 'Gay Liberation' statue may face jail, stiff fine 
### Laura Shin Staff writer 
Of the six Stanford athletes charged last
spring with vandalism of the "Gay Liberation"
statue, former Stanford student Todd Laßocca
and senior Thomas Irwin, charged with felony
vandalism, will face a preliminary hearing on
Sept. 29.
Tony Giacalone, Laßocca's attorney, said he
hopes to reduce the charges against his client
and Irwin. He said he believes the district at
torney is accusing all six athletes of the same
crime, but that the charges for Laßocca and
Irwin are harsher because the district attorney

has a stronger case against
them.
The four other students ap
prehended after the May 16 in
cident face misdemeanor
charges.
When questioned about the
sort of evidence the prosecu
tion has, Giacalone mentioned
the statement that Laßocca
gave to the Stanford police

shortly after he was apprehended — a state
ment that was "some sort of admission [of
guilt]," Giacalone said.
According to police reports, immediately fol

lowing his arrest, Laßocca told police," Ido not
agree with the ideas presented forth with the
statue." He also allegedly said that the sculp
ture offended him.
Irwin's lawyer, John Hackmann, also
thinks his client's behavior does not merit the
felony charge. Referring to the new three
strikes law, he equated "pouring paint [to] the
first step toward life imprisonment."
Assistant Deputy District Attorney for
Santa Clara County Karyn Sinunu, who decid
ed on the charges, said that Hackmann "mis
stated the law" when he said that convicting
