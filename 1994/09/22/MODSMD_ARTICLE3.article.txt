# Hearing set in felony vandalism cases
## Athletes charged with defacing 'Gay Liberation' statue may face jail, stiff fine 
### Laura Shin Staff writer 
Of the six Stanford athletes charged last
spring with vandalism of the "Gay Liberation"
statue, former Stanford student Todd Laßocca
and senior Thomas Irwin, charged with felony
vandalism, will face a preliminary hearing on
Sept. 29.
Tony Giacalone, Laßocca's attorney, said he
hopes to reduce the charges against his client
and Irwin. He said he believes the district at
torney is accusing all six athletes of the same
crime, but that the charges for Laßocca and
Irwin are harsher because the district attorney

has a stronger case against
them.
The four other students ap
prehended after the May 16 in
cident face misdemeanor
charges.
When questioned about the
sort of evidence the prosecu
tion has, Giacalone mentioned
the statement that Laßocca
gave to the Stanford police

shortly after he was apprehended — a state
ment that was "some sort of admission [of
guilt]," Giacalone said.
According to police reports, immediately fol

lowing his arrest, Laßocca told police," Ido not
agree with the ideas presented forth with the
statue." He also allegedly said that the sculp
ture offended him.
Irwin's lawyer, John Hackmann, also
thinks his client's behavior does not merit the
felony charge. Referring to the new three
strikes law, he equated "pouring paint [to] the
first step toward life imprisonment."
Assistant Deputy District Attorney for
Santa Clara County Karyn Sinunu, who decid
ed on the charges, said that Hackmann "mis
stated the law" when he said that convicting


Laßocca
Irwin would be the first step
towards life imprisonment.
"Felony vandalism is not one
of those priors" in the three
strikes legislation, she said.
Legally, "the cutoff for [a
crime to be considered] felony
vandalism is $5,000" in damages,
according to Deputy District
Attorney Valerie Marchant. The
Stanford Museum has estimated
damages to the statue at $8,000
to $10,000.
Asked why only Irwin and
Laßocca face felony charges, Sin
unu replied that "different indi
viduals had different culpability."
Laßocca and Irwin were the
ones who allegedly threw the
paint on the statue — the main
cause of the damage — while the
other four were allegedly only
"aiders and abettors" in placing
the bench between two of the
statue's figures, she said.
Sinunu added that she has
received many calls questioning
her reasons for charging the two
with felonies. She compared this
public response to another case
involving alleged vandals who are
Mexican, in which no one has
questioned why she charged them
with felonies.
Laßocca and Irwin, whose

cases have been placed together
in a package disposition, will
plead not guilty, according to
Hackmann.
The other four defendants are
also pleading not guilty.
Because a Sept. 15 discussion
between the lawyers, Sinunu, the
judge and the four facing misde
meanor charges yielded no ad
vances in the case, another pretrial
conference has been set for Oct. 11.
The four students facing mis
demeanor charges are seniors
Mark Butterfield and Robert
Gardner, and juniors Brian Dal
limore and Jason White. If con
victed, they may go to jail for up
to one year and pay fines up to
$10,000.
All athletes also served suspen
sions from their respective Stan
ford sports: Laßocca, Dallimore,
and Gardner from baseball, Irwin
from wrestling, and White and
Butterfield from football.
Judicial Affairs Officer Sally
Cole would not comment on the
case, saying that the disciplinary
action taken by the University is
confidential.
The white sculpture, made of
bronze will regain its place on
campus tomorrow, after a two
week removal for restoration.
During the restoration, Stanford
Museum officials remained in con
stant contact with sculptor George
Seagal in order to recreate the
statue's original design and color.
