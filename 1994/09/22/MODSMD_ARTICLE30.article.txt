# Stanford acquires collection of Ginsberg poetry, personal items
## 
### Laura Shin Staff writer 
If you know fame is in your future, you
might want to save your beard clippings
now.
The famous Beat poet Allen Ginsberg
did, and those whiskers are serving him
well, particularly since Stanford Libraries
have recently purchased from Ginsberg a
vast collection containing some of these
personal mementos, as well as many items
of more serious literary and historical
value.
"This is probably one of the more com
plete collections — very deliberately col
lected, because [Ginsberg] is very con
scious of his... status in the country," said
Tony Angiletta, director of Library Collec
tions.
The collection contains manuscripts,
unpublished films and audio tapes, diaries
dating back to his childhood, letters
exchanged with other political, cultural,

and academic leaders, photographs and
some personal items such as his beard
trimmings.
But when the University announced the
purchase on Sept. 7, the library was not
even aware that items like Ginsberg's
beard clippings and sneakers were in the
archive, Angiletta said. The main reason
for the purchase, he said, was Ginsberg's
"influence in the way people expressed
themselves not only in literature, but
socially and politically."
"Ginsberg is synonymous with cultural,
as well as political conflicts in the United
States," Angiletta said. "He hasn't lost any
status as a member of the avant garde for
the last 40 years of his life."
Ginsberg's 1955 reading of the poem
"Howl" brought him fame and drew
attention to other writers like Jack Ker
ouac and William Burroughs, who were
all part of the Beat Generation — a move
ment which sought freedom from social
conformity.

Angiletta would not discuss the amount
the University paid for the more than
300,000 items, although he said Stanford

'Future scholars and
youngsters will have the
opportunity to keep track
of historical memory in the
safekeeping of Stanford's
libraries.'
— Allen Ginsberg

kept in mind both a 1985 appraisal of $1.2
million dollars and the additions to the col
lection over the past nine years.
The archive will be housed with the
libraries' other special collections, current
ly located on the third floor of Green

Library East Stacks. When the West
Stacks are opened, the special collections
will be transferred there.
Of special interest are Ginsberg's
manuscripts, letters to Burroughs and
Kerouac, diaries (which Angiletta said
"were, incidentally, corrected by his
dad"), a personal book collection and
other "gems," such as unpublished
tapes.
Ditto masters of "Howl," 400 journals
and 4,000 letters to political figures like
Robert F. Kennedy, Abbie Hoffman and
other Beat writers are also in the collec
tion.
Among the more unusual pieces are the
tennis shoes Ginsberg wore when the
Communist Czechoslovakian government
threw him out of the country in 1965.
Currently, the items are stored in three
places: at Columbia University (where
Ginsberg received his bachelor's degree), at
his New York apartment and in storage
lockers.

In mid-October, the first shipment of
items will arrive, adding to Stanford's
other acquisitions of post-war American
culture.
Angiletta said once pieces of memorabil
ia begin arriving, cataloguing will begin —
which can be an especially daunting task
for this "particularly large and particularly
diverse" collection.
Researchers outside the library may
have access to some parts of the collec
tion in the spring at the earliest. For
those curious about Ginsberg as a per
son, Angiletta mentioned that a future
exhibition of the archive is "more than
likely."
Ginsberg issued a statement expressing
his pleasure that "future scholars and
youngsters will have the opportunity to
keep track of historical memory in the safe
keeping of Stanford's libraries."
He also said that the papers he had saved
were "a record of the spiritual war for liber
ation of form and content in poetry."
