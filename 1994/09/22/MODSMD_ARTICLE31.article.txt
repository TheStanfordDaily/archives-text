# World Cup, Japanese Emperor highlight Stanford summer

Stanford hosts World Cup
Thousands descended on Stan
ford during June and July to
watch World Cup soccer. Games
like the July 4 U.S.-Brazil
matchup drew nearly sold out
crowds to Stanford Stadium as
loud and loyal fans from all over
the world braved the heat and
crowds to cheer for their favorite
teams.
The five games went surpris
ingly smoothly, resulting in a
total of only 31 arrests — main
ly ticket scalpers — throughout

the month of play. Most of the
medical emergencies were heat
related.
While the games brought
throngs of spirited visitors to
campus, many Palo Alto busi
nesses actually saw a downturn
in activity, as locals stayed away
to avoid the crowds.
Despite the large crowds, the
University actually lost money on
the sports venture. Although
World Cup USA and other orga
nizations paid for many of the
renovations to the playing areas,
the University absorbed the costs

of new aluminum benches
installed in the stadium, result
ing in a loss of approximately
$700,000.
Japanese emperor visits
Japanese Emperor Akhito and
his wife, Empress Michiko,
graced the Stanford community
with a brief visit on June 23. The
emperor's campus tour included
lunch with University President
Gerhard Casper and a visit to the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Cen
ter, which has collaborated with

laboratories in Japan on scientif
ic research.
The royal couple also
learned a bit about Stanford's
Japanese studies program
from students.
Though to many the visit
symbolized Japan's efforts to
improve relations with the
United States, some took the
opportunity to organize a
small demonstration along
Mayfield Avenue demanding
an apology for Japanese acts
against China during World
War 11.

Cuts threaten research
An appropriations bill passed
by the U.S. House of Representa
tives in July threatened to cut
defense research funding for the
nation's universities by 50 per
cent.
About 15 percent of the Uni
versity's $280 million in federal
research funds comes from the
Defense Department, and cuts
would have resulted in a loss of
up to $40 million for Stanford
researchers.
In particular, the bill would
have drastically reduced the
number of students able to
attend graduate school, many of
whom receive financial aid
through the Defense Depart
ment.
The House's passage of the bill
drew heavy criticism and an out
pouring of opposition lobbying
from such Stanford officials as
University President Gerhard
Casper and Chemistry Prof.
Richard Zare, as well as from
presidents of other California
universities affected by the bill
and from several state and feder
al legislators.
Later in the summer, the U.S.
Senate passed a Defense appro
priations bill calling for an $82
million reduction, far less than
the House's $900 million cut.
A conference committee is cur
rently meeting to resolve the dif
ferences between the two propos
als.
Co Ho robbed at gun point
A man armed with a handgun
robbed the Coffee House early in
July, escaping with $4,400 from
the restaurant's safe. The man
appeared as the employees were
cleaning up after the 11 p.m. clos
ing and ordered the six employees
into the office area, where the
night manager was forced to open
the safe.
The suspect then ordered the
employees to tie each other with
cords, and pistol-whipped two of
them before leaving. The employ
ees managed to free themselves
within about five minutes and
called campus police. The injured
employees were treated by
paramedics for head wounds.
The robber, who has not been
caught, is reported to be between
20 and 30 years old, about 5-foot

7-inch and with a stocky build. To
prevent a repeat offense, Tresid
der officials are in the process of
installing a silent, under-the
counter alarm in the Coffee
House.

The five games went
surpisingly smoothly,
resulting in only 31
arrests — mainly
ticket scalpers —
throughout the
month of play.

Stanford woman raped
In only the second non
acquaintance rape reported at
Stanford since June 1990, a
woman leaving Sunday Mass at
Memorial Church was raped in
early July.
The 23-year-old wife of a grad
uate student was attacked north
of the Oval near Roth Way while
walking alone through a seclud
ed, woody area.
Stanford police said the
woman suffered scrapes to her
knees and bruises to her back

when she tried to fight off the
assailant. She wa3 taken to Valley
Medical Center in San Jose,
where she was treated and
released.
The rape occurred in the same
week as the armed robbery at the
CofTee House.
Although the World Cup was
taking place the same week,
police said they do not believe
there was any connection
between the three events.
Breyer approved
Stanford alumnus Stephen
Breyer was sworn in on Aug. 3 as
the nation's 108 th Supreme
Court justice after an 87-9
approval vote by the U.S. Senate.
Breyer was widely praised by
many senators and by President
Clinton, although several Repub
lican senators expressed displea
sure with investments the judge
had made in Lloyd's of London
insurance syndicates, which
could force him to stay out of
Supreme Court cases involving
toxic waste and asbestos.
Breyer, who was a member of
Stanford's class of 1959, taught
at Harvard Law School and was
chief counsel to the Senate Judi
ciary Committee in 1979-80. For
the past 14 years, he has served
as chief judge of the Ist U.S. Cir

cuit Court of Appeals.
Breyer will join Chief Justice
William Rehnquist and Justices
Anthony Kennedy and Sandra Day
O'Connor as the fourth Stanford
alumnus to sit on the court. Earli
er in the summer, Casper and Law
Prof. Kathleen Sullivan testified in
favor of Breyer in front of the Sen
ate Judiciary Committee.
