## ASSU works to improve slow postal service 
### Jim Luh Staff writer 
While some students kicked back
under the sun, ASSU leaders worked
hard this summer to improve postal ser
vice on campus and prepare a new stu
dent-run compact-disc exchange.
ASSU leaders met July 13 with U.S.

Postal Service represen
tatives and University
officials to discuss com
plaints about the Stan
ford Post Office.
The representatives
agreed to establish a
committee to address
post office complaints.
The resulting Postal
Advisory Board led by

ASSU Summer Senate Chair Stephen
Russell, met in August and is scheduled
to meet again at the end of this month.
Attempting to improve service at the
post office is among the best things the
ASSU can do for the Stanford communi
ty, Russell said.
"There's not a student, faculty mem
ber or staff member . . . not affected in
some way by the Stanford Post Office,"
he added.
Stanford students, faculty and staff
have complained to Russell about late,
misdirected and lost mail as well as slow,
inadequate and rude service from postal
employees, he said.
Subpar postal service can have drastic
consequences, as customers trust the
post office to handle such important cor
respondence such as bill payments, job
offers and graduate school applications,
Russell said.
The committee plans to examine ways
to improve service at the post office and
inform students of ways they can help
speed their mail delivery, such as using
the ZIP-f-4 code.
Russell said that the committee will
also compile a complaint database and
examine mail-delivery data assembled by
Price Waterhouse and the postal ser
vice's computerized tracking system.
As Stanford is one of only two univer
sities that operates an on-campus post
office, Russell said, the committee will
also examine possible alternatives to the
current postal arrangement.
"The most important thing this com
mittee will do is evaluate our system of
on-campus mail delivery," he said.
In the end, he said, "it may or may not
make sense" to continue operating an
on-campus post office.

The Stanford Post Office's Station
Manager Jim Ruiz, however, said he
hopes the committee's work will help the
post office evolve from a begrudged cam
pus guest into an integral part of the
University community.
"I'm looking forward to continuing
the relationship," Ruiz said. "I think it's
important to have open lines of commu
nication between the post office and the
University."
Ruiz, Palo Alto Postmaster Masayuki
Sato and Susan Fujiki, a manager from
the San Francisco Post Office, represent
the Postal Service on the committee.
Bruce Ives, district manager for U.S.
Rep. Anna Eshoo, also serves on the
committee.
University representatives on the
committee include Student Activities
Director Nanci Howe, Christy Lang of
the President's Office, Government
Relations Assistant Director Bradley
Cohen, and Data Center Financial Man
ager Hanh Le Nguyen.
Russell, who will be an undergraduate
senator this year, and COP members
Anietie Ekanem and Vanessa Alvarado
represent the ASSU.
The ASSU Nominations Committee
will select two or three additional stu
dents to serve on the committee, Russell
said, adding that committee meetings
will always be open to nonmembers.
"We want the committee to be really
open," Russell said.
The ASSU has also been making final
preparations to open a student-run com
pact-disc exchange on the second floor of
Tresidder Union above the Coffee
House.
According to ASSU Financial Manag
er Gabe Lucas, the compact-disc
exchange will open Sept. 26, and a
grand-opening celebration will follow on
Sept. 27.
The compact-disc exchange, called
Disc Connection, was the winning entry
last year in an ASSU program that
offered an entrepreneurial grant of up to
$10,000 for a student-run business pro
ject.
Disc Connection will run as an ASSU
business project managed by its creator,
senior Jason Garoutte, whose proposal
was selected from 25 applications to
receive the entrepreneurial grant.
About $2,000 of the $5,970 grant
awarded to Disc Connection was ear
marked for buying out the CD XChange,
another student-run compact-disc
exchange that operated in front of the
Bookstore last year.
