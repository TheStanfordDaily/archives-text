# Friends remember a special soul

Friends remember Bart McCormick as an "amazing guy,"
someone whose experience with illness gave him a strong deter
mination to live normally, coupled with insight incredible in
someone his age.
McCormick, who would have been a sophomore this year, died

at home in Carmel, Ind., on
July 20 after struggling for
more than four years with
cancer.
The 20-year-old lived in
Twain last year and was a
Sigma Chi pledge. He
attended high school at Bre
beuf Preparatory School in
Indianapolis, graduating in
1992 as valedictorian of his
class, and came to Stanford
after spending a year under
going treatment for his ill
ness.
McCormick made a
strong impression on the
people he met. Many
remembered him as some
one who understood the
value of life far better than
most of his peers and lived
accordingly.

"The experience with cancer had aged him — he was an old
soul at the age of 20. He had a firm grasp of what he wanted from
life, a fierce determination to beat cancer and move on with
things," said junior Matt Esslinger, McCormick's friend. "He was
going to run his life... he never gave up. He could have died a long
time ago, but he did everything he could to beat [the cancer]."

The thought of eventually coming to Stanford helped him
through the year of treatment, said his mother, Marcie Jones.
"The only thing that mattered was that he could get on cam
pus," she said. "He was frustrated with kids who would not be
aware of what Stanford had to offer."
The Stanford experience helped McCormick to "feel normal,"
said Sheila Harris-Schutz, a close family friend. "His time there
was very important to him and I think his determination to com
plete the year there kept him going through some really difficult
times."
Another normal college experience — pledging a fraternity —
"made him very happy," said junior Gavin Turner, one of
McCormick's closest friends in Sigma Chi.
"He felt he had found a place on campus where he could be
himself. We're glad we could make a positive difference in his life
during the last few months," Turner said. "I wish we had more
time to spend with him."
McCormick's illness was osteogenic sarcoma, a cancer on the
bone rather than of the bone. The disease began in his leg when
he was 15, and after a knee replacement and chemotherapy, it
metastasized to his lungs. Over the next few years, McCormick
had lung surgeries, multiple chemotherapy treatments and bone
marrow transplants.
But people close to him said they prefer not to define
McCormick by his illness. Now that he is gone, they focus instead
on celebrating his life.
Although a memorial service was held in Indiana a few days
after McCormick's death, his family and friends have planned
another at Stanford to be held Oct. 10 in Memorial Church, fol
lowed by a reception at the Sigma Chi house.
"Hopefully, this will give those who could not attend in July an
opportunity to come and remember Bart," said Harris-Schutz.
"It will also be an opportunity for some of us who were close to
him and loved him very much to celebrate his life in a place that
meant so much to him."
Memorial funds have been established for McCormick at his
high school and at Stanford through the Sigma Chi fraternity.
