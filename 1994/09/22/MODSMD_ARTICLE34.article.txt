# Mountain lion spotted on campus
## 
### Shirley Park Staff writer 
A mountain lion was spotted in the
Lagunita lakebed Sept. 10, shocking
many campus residents who often run
and walk in the area.
Palo Alto police officer Lori Kratzer
sighted a mountain lion near the lake in
tbp morning while driving on Junipero
Serra Boulevard.
By the time additional units from the
Stanford and Palo Alto Police arrived, the
cougar had made its exit, probably into
the foothills west of campus, reports said.
Police searched the area for about one
and a half hours, but did not see the big
cat again.
While mountain lion sightings gener
ally have not resulted in harm, last April
a cougar killed a Placerville resident jog
ging near a state recreation area in El
Dorado County. She was the first woman
in California to be killed by a mountain

lion in more than 80 years.
Responding to the possible danger,
Stanford Police have now posted warn
ing signs in the vicinity stating,
"Although we believe there is no imme
diate threat to your safety, please use
caution while running or walking in this
area."
On the same weekend that Kratzer
saw the cougar at Stanford, an attorney
jogging in a rural part of UC-Santa Cruz
also encountered one. Another mountain
lion was spotted Tuesday in Milpitas,
near San Jose.
The Department of Fish and Game
attributed the UC-Santa Cruz sighting to
an inquisitive cougar displaying "cat
curiosity," said Deb White, an animal
control officer at the school.
Other mountain lions have been spot
ted five times since May at UC-Santa
Cruz, White said.
Although big-cat sightings at Stan
ford are rather an aberration, White

said that upon encountering a cat the
person should stop and try to become as
big and intimidating as possible. She
also advised shouting at the animal if
approached.
Trying to outdistance a mountain lion
could "trigger [the animal's] instinct to
chase and attack," White warned, adding
that making the cat perceive the person
as a threat is important.
Kratzer said the lion she saw near
Lake Lag was golden-colored and about
50 to 75 yards away. "It was sauntering
around like it owned the area," she told
the San Jose Mercury News.
Rather than being attracted simply by
the aesthetic appeal of college campuses,
White said the mountain lions are lured
to the schools' lowland locations by their
abundant resources.
The drought has led mountain lions,
as well as their primary source of food —
deer — to seek water and vegetation at
lower elevations, White said.
