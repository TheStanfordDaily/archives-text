## Tips for the clueless Survival info for Orientation week 
### 
As helpful as your RA may be,
your fust few weeks at Stanford
can be a little disorienting. We at
The Daily remember that feeling
all too well. So, to make your first
weeks at Stanford as worry-free as
possible, we compiled this list of
answers to some of the most fre
quently asked Orientation week
questions:

• How do I pay my
University Bill
and ensure my
financial aid?
To pay your bill, go
to the Oak West lounge

on the second floor of
Tresidder Union. If you already
have a check for the amount due,
just look for the big box in which to
deposit your yellow envelope. If
you suspect an error in your bill, or
need to get loan disbursements or
pick up scholarship money, there
are several specific counters to as
sist you. But if you have questions,
come early — lines can get really,
really long. And for those who
have no clue where to begin, there
is even a "No Clue" line to stand

• What happens
if I miss an
Orientation
activity?
Relax. Orientation
programs are recom-

mended but not
mandatory. Every opportunity to
get to know Stanford and the peo
ple around you will pay off in the
long run, but things may come up
that prevent you from attending
every activity that you'd like to at
tend. Pick the activities that you
think are important or sound in
teresting, and attend those.

• Do I need to take
a Math, Chem or
Foreign Language
placement test?
Math: If you do
not have AP credit or

college transfer credit
and wish to take a math class, you
need to take the math placement
test. All math placement tests are
taken using computers in dorm
clusters and last one hour. You
should plan to take the test before




you meet with your adviser.
Your score, which you will get as
soon as you finish the test, is
strictly to help you determine
which math class you should
enroll in. In other words, no one
will see it but you.
Chemistry: All students,
including those with AP credit,
must take the chemistry place
ment test to enroll in a chem
istry class at Stanford. Check
your Orientation calendar for
times and locations. As with the
math test, your score is personal

information.
Foreign Language: If
you have studied a foreign lan
guage and plan to take the
same language at Stanford,
you need to take the placement
test. The University requires
all students to achieve compe
tency in a foreign language
equal to a third quarter, first
year course. If you do not have
AP language credit or have not
completed a third-year high
school language course, you
should plan to take this test.
Even if you do have AP credit,
check with the proper language
department to find out if you
are required to take the lan
guage test.

• How do I find
my way around
campus?
An excellent question,
since navigating around
an 8,500 acre campus

where every building
looks vaguely like Taco Bell can
trip up even those who are handy
with a compass. First, some words
of warning. Hoover Tower serves
as a poor landmark because it
looks the same from all four sides.
And if you try to use the sun to
navigate, beware — for some
strange reason, maps of Stanford
are oriented upside-down, so
North is inconveniently at the bot
tom. Your best advice? Cany a
map with you, and don't be afraid

to ask for directions — we all did
when we were frosh.

• If I'm having
trouble with a
class, can I get a
tutor?
The answer is probably
yes. The Center for

Teaching and Learning
gets about 2,000 requests for help
each year, and is usually able to
accommodate them. In addition, CTL
offers math and chemistry tutoring.
Writing tutors are also available, but
students are encouraged to try to
make appointments for these. In addi
tion, many dorms have tutors, and
some departments offer tutoring for
their classes. For tutoring informa
tion, call the CTL at 723-1326.
