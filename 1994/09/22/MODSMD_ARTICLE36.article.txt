## Tips for the clueless Survival info for Orientation week 
### 
As helpful as your RA may be,
your fust few weeks at Stanford
can be a little disorienting. We at
The Daily remember that feeling
all too well. So, to make your first
weeks at Stanford as worry-free as
possible, we compiled this list of

and wish to take a math class, you
