# Easing frosh jitters
## Res Ed helps students through first year 
### Emily Bazar Editorial staff 
Welcome to Stanford. . .a week
of fun and frolic awaits new stu
dents. From square dancing to
provocative performances, Orien
tation promises an entertaining
introduction to the Farm.
But starting a new life in a dif
ferent environment is not always
glamorous. Change causes stress,
and most new students are appre
hensive about their transition to
Stanford life.
Lucky for them, they don't
have to make the transition on
their own.
Residential Education — affec
tionately known as Res Ed —
guides new students through
first-year jitters and beyond. In
addition to facilitating program
ming and activities, it assembles a
group of residence-based faculty
and students to ease culture
shock.
Although new students main
tain constant contact with this

team throughout the year, they
first experience Res Ed upon ar
rival, when each student is greet
ed by his or her enthusiastic resi
dent assistant, more commonly
known as an RA.
Immediately upon arrival, up
beat RAs recognize new students
and greet them by name. This en
dearing tradition is often what
Stanford students remember
most about their first day on cam
pus.
"It freaks the hell out of the
freshmen when they get here,"
said Donner RA Jon Ganz, "but it
shows that we've actually taken
the time to get to know their
names."
Learning new students' names
is only a minuscule part of an RA's
duties. New RAs have spent the
last two weeks in intensive train
ing, learning how to create a cohe
sive community from a diverse
medley of students.
Faisan RA Adam Fingerhut
understands all students have dif
ferences, and most will be a bit ner
vous in their new homes. But he
sees these situations as integral
parts of on-campus life.
"It's OK to be nervous," he said.
"I was terrified to be here during
freshman year."
Like most RAs, Fingerhut
wants to alleviate fears by main
taining a dorm "open door" policy.
He hopes students on his hall will
know they are welcome to visit him
with problems, concerns or just to
chat.
He hopes to convince fellow res
idents to explore options outside of
residences, as he sees this as an
important way to adapt to the
Stanford community.
"I want to encourage people to

experience new things — that's
how they get used to being here
and being away," he said.
While RAs play the diversified
role of comfort-giver, friendly ear,
arbitrator and program director,
one role you won't find Stanford
RAs playing is that of hall monitor,
Ganz said. "We're not in any way
supposed to act as police officers or
enforcers," he said.
Stanford policy is set up so that
students will be treated as adults,
and will be expected to self-enforce
policies on drinking and overnight
visitors, he said.
The idea of student responsibili
ty is prevalent among all residen
tial staff. Even resident fellows
(RFs) — faculty or staff who live in
dorms — are not disciplinarians.
Although they receive a copy of
each resident's grades, they do not
wield watchful parental eyes.
"Disciplinarian is the one thing
we are not," said Donner RF Linda

Paulson.
Instead, RFs provide an addi
tional resource for students. They
can often be seen roaming the
halls, socializing with students at
dinner or helping them though
decisions.
Branner RF Kennell Jackson
sees himself as a guide. He does not
make decisions for residents, but
helps them reach conclusions
themselves.
"I give tips like a person at the
race track gives you a tip," Jackson
said. "We're trying to take new resi
dents from a situation of unknowns
to a position where they're knowl
edgeable about Stanford."
Support from residential staff
does not end after Orientation.
RFs and RAs, along with resident
computer coordinators (RCCs) and
advising associates (AAs), create a
residence-based support system
which will be in place throughout
the year.

First-year academic jitters are
allayed by seemingly all-wise AAs.
These brave souls have stumbled
through unknown waters of first
year confusion to academic nirvana
and they're prepared to take new
students along the same path.
Unsure of what classes to take?
What professors to talk to? AAs
have all the answers.
RCCs are local computer viz
ards who can conjure panaceas for
almost any computer ill. They keop
computer clusters running — mak
ing one less thing last-minute paper
writers have to stress about.
And for the week of Orientation,
there's extra help for new resi
dents. In order to ensure that the
week of enjoyment and campus
wide activities go off without a
hitch, orientation volunteers goes
(OVs) will be around to help carry
luggage up three flights of stairs or
lead new residents to the well-con
cealed Frost Amphitheater.
