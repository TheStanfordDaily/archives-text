# Easing frosh jitters
## Res Ed helps students through first year 
### Emily Bazar Editorial staff 
Welcome to Stanford. . .a week
of fun and frolic awaits new stu
dents. From square dancing to
provocative performances, Orien
tation promises an entertaining
introduction to the Farm.
But starting a new life in a dif
ferent environment is not always
glamorous. Change causes stress,
and most new students are appre
hensive about their transition to
Stanford life.
Lucky for them, they don't
have to make the transition on
their own.
Residential Education — affec
tionately known as Res Ed —
guides new students through
first-year jitters and beyond. In
addition to facilitating program
ming and activities, it assembles a
group of residence-based faculty
and students to ease culture
shock.
Although new students main
tain constant contact with this

team throughout the year, they
first experience Res Ed upon ar
rival, when each student is greet
ed by his or her enthusiastic resi
dent assistant, more commonly
known as an RA.
Immediately upon arrival, up
beat RAs recognize new students
and greet them by name. This en
dearing tradition is often what
Stanford students remember
most about their first day on cam
pus.
"It freaks the hell out of the
freshmen when they get here,"
said Donner RA Jon Ganz, "but it
shows that we've actually taken
the time to get to know their
names."
Learning new students' names
is only a minuscule part of an RA's
duties. New RAs have spent the
last two weeks in intensive train
ing, learning how to create a cohe
sive community from a diverse
medley of students.
