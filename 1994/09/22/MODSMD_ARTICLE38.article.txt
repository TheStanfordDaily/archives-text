# Donner RF won over
## Unique experiences sell Linda Paulson on the merits of an all-freshman dorm 
### Jim Luh Staff writer 
It's 3 a.m. There's a college freshman at your
door, and he needs to talk about Nietzsche. Now —
right now.
It's not a snippet of postmodern drama, it's from
the memory of Linda Paulson who has had a wealth
of equally unusual experiences in her eight years as
resident fellow in Donner House, an all-freshman
dormitory in Stern Hall.
In addition to her RF duties, Paulson, is a lectur
er in the English Department, track coordinator for
the Literature and the Arts Cultures, Ideas and Val
ues track and an assistant dean in the Continuing
Studies Program.
She shares the Donner RF apartment with three
cats — Charles (named after Charles Dickens),
Philip (after Pip in Dickens' "Great Expectations")
and Daphne (for a mythical nymph who turned into
a laurel tree).
Paulson said that she didn't request an all-fresh
man dorm — and wouldn't have, as an RF or as a
freshman — but she added that a few years in Don
ner have convinced her of the merits of single-class
dorms.
"I have really come around to thinking that
they're very good places from which to launch a uni
versity career," Paulson said.
"I think on one level, freshmen are treated well, in
that they're given quite a safety net," she said. "[Res
idential Education] is really right under them, wait
ing for them, hoping they don't fall, but if they do,
[Res Ed is] going to catch them."
When Paulson started out as an RF, it was difficult

Donner RF Unda Paulson believes living in an all-freshman doon has many potential rewards.
to find a way to involve herself in
her residents' lives without being
intrusive — making for some emo
tionally trying moments, she said.
Nowadays, she said, while still
trying to keep some distance, she
leans toward the "pushy" side
when dealing with her freshmen.
"I try to make it so that as
many as possible, ideally all of
them, would always be able to
come talk to me," Paulson said. "I
really make friends with some of
these students. They're great, they
always come back to visit."
Paulson has a reputation as one
of the most open and approachable
RFs on campus, one that's neither
undeserved nor unintentional.
Paulson said living with — rather
than next to — her students is
incredibly rewarding.
"I'm getting to know a whole
generation of students," she said.
"We... interact over the course of
a very intense year during which
they are changing like crazy, and
figuring out what an adult world is
like, really doing some quite
remarkable shifts in maturity."
Paulson remembers something
about almost all of the students
she has lived with in Donner, she
said.
"It's quite amazing that I get to
know them this well, because I
shouldn't," she said. "I wouldn't
know them this well if I were sim
ply their teacher."
In some ways, Paulson said, the
RF experience sets her apart from
her friends, but she has had no
problems leading a normal adult
life. It's not difficult to break away
from the RF routine for a moment,
she said.
"I have a lot of adult friends,"
she said. "I have a social life and I
go out — I leave.... I also bring
my social life in. My friends are
free to, and encouraged to, come
here."
And despite that her apartment
is literally located at Donner's
main entrance, she said, students
respect her occasional need for pri
vacy.
"Stanford students are very civ
ilized," she said. "They don't push
me into exposure that I don't
want."
And while they are occasionally
raucous, her residents "are never
as rowdy or as shocking as they
would like to think," she said.
Paulson seemed confident that
college freshmen would be mature
enough not to consider her last
statement a dare.
"I think this is one of the chal
lenges for a resident fellow," Paul
son said. "[Freshmen] would like
to have you represent another gen
eration in some absolute way....
And you don't. When you're living
closely with people, nothing is that
cut-and-dry."
An RF's job is tough at times,
Paulson admitted, but the difficult

moments are more than balanced
out by the unique gifts each group
of freshmen brings to her life.
"It's wonderful," she said.
"They're so talented and so bright
and clever. I love their company.
They're great fun to sort of listen
to and talk to."
Freshmen typically interact
very well with each other, she
added.
"When a residential situation
works as well as it can, you've got
a group of people who have eccen
tric, weird interests, who are all
kind of fascinated by one another's
eccentric, weird interests," she
said. "And some years, that really
works."
Freshmen constantly surprise
her with an approach to society
that remains uncorrupted by any
long-standing assumptions, she
said.
"Some of them somehow have
escaped all of the stereotypes that
we're raised with, and it just never
crosses their mind that they
shouldn't be doing X, Y, and Z,"
she said.
Another amazing phenomenon,
Paulson said, is how the current
generation is finding new ways to
build close friendships between
men and women.
"Twenty years ago, it just
wasn't there," she said. "Sex had
to be a part of it, or it didn't have
to be a part of it, but somehow it
was there."
Paulson said she has also seen
freshmen coming in with an
increased ecological consciousness,
something which has given her
high hopes for the future.
"This generation of students is
going to be the one, they're going
to be able to figure out some solu
tions," she said. "Or at least
they're going to try. At least
they're going to take it seriously
and they're going to try."
However, she's also seen fresh
men become less concerned with
more complex social issues and
retreat farther into themselves.
Students are becoming more
solitary, she said, partly because
personal computers make it so
easy for them to interact with
their own minds rather than with
other minds.
"They are so good at it," she
said. "They are just an amazing
group for understanding how to
use computers — but I do see con
versation sliding a bit."
"Maybe I'm just marking
myself off as not having thought
through what the 21st century
might make us into," she said,
"but it strikes me that there is a lot
of social interaction that is
missed."
Paulson offered one piece of
advice to incoming freshmen:
"The biggest mistake freshmen
make ... is getting too focused too
fast. ... There are only 85 things
to do about every hour of the day
around here. What you need to do
is go out there and figure out
where it all is. Get yourself
involved."
