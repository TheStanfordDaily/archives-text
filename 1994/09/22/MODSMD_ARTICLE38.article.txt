# Donner RF won over
## Unique experiences sell Linda Paulson on the merits of an all-freshman dorm 
### Jim Luh Staff writer 
It's 3 a.m. There's a college freshman at your
door, and he needs to talk about Nietzsche. Now —
right now.
It's not a snippet of postmodern drama, it's from
the memory of Linda Paulson who has had a wealth
of equally unusual experiences in her eight years as
resident fellow in Donner House, an all-freshman
dormitory in Stern Hall.
In addition to her RF duties, Paulson, is a lectur
er in the English Department, track coordinator for
the Literature and the Arts Cultures, Ideas and Val
ues track and an assistant dean in the Continuing
Studies Program.
She shares the Donner RF apartment with three
cats — Charles (named after Charles Dickens),
Philip (after Pip in Dickens' "Great Expectations")
and Daphne (for a mythical nymph who turned into
a laurel tree).
Paulson said that she didn't request an all-fresh
man dorm — and wouldn't have, as an RF or as a
freshman — but she added that a few years in Don
ner have convinced her of the merits of single-class
dorms.
"I have really come around to thinking that
they're very good places from which to launch a uni
versity career," Paulson said.
"I think on one level, freshmen are treated well, in
that they're given quite a safety net," she said. "[Res
idential Education] is really right under them, wait
ing for them, hoping they don't fall, but if they do,
[Res Ed is] going to catch them."
When Paulson started out as an RF, it was difficult
