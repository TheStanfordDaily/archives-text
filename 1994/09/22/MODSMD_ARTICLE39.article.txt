# Laid back Orientation fires up
## 
### Frank Guinan Staff writer 
Register on Axess. Take my
meal-card picture. Open banking
accounts. Take placement tests.
Register my bike at Tresidder. Oh
wait, I still need to buy a bike at Tar
get. Open an e-mail account. Get
phone service. Pay the tuition bill.
And it's not even the first day of
classes.
Such errands are typical for Ori
entation week, the first week of any
new student's life at Stanford. De
spite these mundane, must-do
tasks, Orientation is also known for
fun and memorable activities like
Music and Fun Under the Sun
(commonly known as MuFuUn-

Sun) and the "Faces of the Commu
nity" program.
Such activities — aimed at ac
quainting new students with Stan
ford's academic atmosphere, its so
cial scene and with other students
— all offer something new and fun
this year, head Orientation Coordi
nator Maria Martinez said.
Although most programs reap
pear from year to year, this year's
Orientation coordinators lightened
this year's schedule a bit, Martinez
said.
"Things are going to be a bit
more mellow. We wanted the [new]
students to have more time to inter
act with each other in the resi
dences," she said, adding that stu
dents need more time to run all

their errands.
This year, there will also be a
push to instill more class spirit in
the freshmen, Martinez said,
adding that maintaining class spirit
has always been a problem at Stan
ford.
"When you have people graduat
ing in three, four and five years, it's
hard for the University to push,"
she said.
To help instill class spirit, Mar
tinez said "everything that can have
'Class of 98' on it will have it....
There are plenty of souvenirs this
year."
Despite these minor changes,
several memorable programs are
still on the agenda. "A College Edu
cation . .. What For?" — one of the

first programs on the Orientation
calendar — takes a look at the role
of education in a student's life.
Provost Condoleezza Rice will be
among the administrators this year
sharing thoughts on the subject.
"[This program! gives students
an intellectual feeling of Stanford.
It sets the academic tone," Mar
tinez said.
One of the most memorable and
dramatic programs every year is
"Faces of the Community." During
the program, upperclass students
representing different communi
ties share their Stanford experi
ences through speeches, music and
dance.
