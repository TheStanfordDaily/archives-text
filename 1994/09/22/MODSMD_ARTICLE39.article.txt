# Laid back Orientation fires up
## 
### Frank Guinan Staff writer 
Register on Axess. Take my
meal-card picture. Open banking
accounts. Take placement tests.
Register my bike at Tresidder. Oh
wait, I still need to buy a bike at Tar
get. Open an e-mail account. Get
phone service. Pay the tuition bill.
And it's not even the first day of
classes.
Such errands are typical for Ori
entation week, the first week of any
new student's life at Stanford. De
spite these mundane, must-do
tasks, Orientation is also known for
fun and memorable activities like
Music and Fun Under the Sun
(commonly known as MuFuUn-

Sun) and the "Faces of the Commu
nity" program.
Such activities — aimed at ac
quainting new students with Stan
ford's academic atmosphere, its so
cial scene and with other students
— all offer something new and fun
this year, head Orientation Coordi
nator Maria Martinez said.
Although most programs reap
pear from year to year, this year's
Orientation coordinators lightened
this year's schedule a bit, Martinez
said.
"Things are going to be a bit
more mellow. We wanted the [new]
students to have more time to inter
act with each other in the resi
dences," she said, adding that stu
dents need more time to run all

their errands.
This year, there will also be a
push to instill more class spirit in
the freshmen, Martinez said,
adding that maintaining class spirit
has always been a problem at Stan
ford.
"When you have people graduat
ing in three, four and five years, it's
hard for the University to push,"
she said.
To help instill class spirit, Mar
tinez said "everything that can have
'Class of 98' on it will have it....
There are plenty of souvenirs this
year."
Despite these minor changes,
several memorable programs are
still on the agenda. "A College Edu
cation . .. What For?" — one of the

first programs on the Orientation
calendar — takes a look at the role
of education in a student's life.
Provost Condoleezza Rice will be
among the administrators this year
sharing thoughts on the subject.
"[This program! gives students
an intellectual feeling of Stanford.
It sets the academic tone," Mar
tinez said.
One of the most memorable and
dramatic programs every year is
"Faces of the Community." During
the program, upperclass students
representing different communi
ties share their Stanford experi
ences through speeches, music and
dance.
"We hope to give an honest view
of the range of people who are here
and their experiences at Stanford,"
said Multicultural Educator
Tommy Lee Woon, one of the peo
ple in charge of putting the pro
gram together.
"We want them to start think

ing about diversity ... and want to
let them know what they can
expect," he said.
He added that some changes
have been made to this year's pro
gram. In addition to a short slide
show displaying Stanford's multi
cultural history, Woon said the pro
gram will encourage students to
explore their identities.
"We are not just one race, color
or ethnicity.... We can expose all
our identities, celebrate our differ
ences, and yet affirm a commonali

ty," he said.
Another popular program dur
ing Orientation is "Sex in the '90s:
Communication, Intimacy and
Power." In this program, student
actors present specific situations
and optimal ways of dealing with
certain social predicaments.
Angelina Cheney, sexual
assault prevention educator at
Cowell Student Health Center,
said that the program has expand
ed a bit and has become "more
inclusive" of the different students

on campus.
"[The program] should be
intriguing, provocative," she said.
"We're trying to encourage [stu
dents] to make good sexual choices
... [and] to feel a little more pre
pared to deal with sexual situa
tions."
Programs are not the only
things scheduled over the course of
the next week. Two all-class parties
are planned and sponsored by the
Orientation committee with the
help of surrounding businesses.

Club Cardinal — held tomor
row night and featuring karaoke
— is usually one of the first
opportunities for new students to
meet others outside of their resi
dence. Gift certificates to places
such as Una Mas and Ultimate
Yogurt will be awarded at the
party.
Meanwhile, the traditional
square dance hoedown is set to take
place on Monday at Chuck Taylor
Field during MuFuUnSun. Spon
sors of the event include Stanford

Concert Network, Stanford Feder
al Credit Union and Jansport,
which is giving away free back
packs as promotional items.
According to Martinez, fresh
men can look forward to making
some of their best memories during
Orientation week.
"[Students] learn about differ
ent communities that they have
never been in contact with before,"
she said. "They learn about Stan
ford ... [and] they meet some of
their best friends."

There are plenty of souvenirs this
year."
Despite these minor changes,
several memorable programs are
still on the agenda. "A College Edu
cation . .. What For?" — one of the

first programs on the Orientation
calendar — takes a look at the role
of education in a student's life.
Provost Condoleezza Rice will be
among the administrators this year
sharing thoughts on the subject.
"[This program! gives students
an intellectual feeling of Stanford.
It sets the academic tone," Mar
tinez said.
One of the most memorable and
dramatic programs every year is
"Faces of the Community." During
the program, upperclass students
representing different communi
ties share their Stanford experi
ences through speeches, music and
dance.
"We hope to give an honest view
of the range of people who are here
and their experiences at Stanford,"
said Multicultural Educator
Tommy Lee Woon, one of the peo
ple in charge of putting the pro
gram together.
"We want them to start think

ing about diversity ... and want to
let them know what they can
expect," he said.
He added that some changes
have been made to this year's pro
gram. In addition to a short slide
show displaying Stanford's multi
cultural history, Woon said the pro
gram will encourage students to
explore their identities.
"We are not just one race, color
or ethnicity.... We can expose all
our identities, celebrate our differ
ences, and yet affirm a commonali

ty," he said.
Another popular program dur
ing Orientation is "Sex in the '90s:
Communication, Intimacy and
Power." In this program, student
actors present specific situations
and optimal ways of dealing with
certain social predicaments.
Angelina Cheney, sexual
assault prevention educator at
Cowell Student Health Center,
said that the program has expand
ed a bit and has become "more
inclusive" of the different students

on campus.
"[The program] should be
intriguing, provocative," she said.
"We're trying to encourage [stu
dents] to make good sexual choices
... [and] to feel a little more pre
pared to deal with sexual situa
tions."
Programs are not the only
things scheduled over the course of
the next week. Two all-class parties
are planned and sponsored by the
Orientation committee with the
help of surrounding businesses.

Club Cardinal — held tomor
row night and featuring karaoke
— is usually one of the first
opportunities for new students to
meet others outside of their resi
dence. Gift certificates to places
such as Una Mas and Ultimate
Yogurt will be awarded at the
party.
Meanwhile, the traditional
square dance hoedown is set to take
place on Monday at Chuck Taylor
Field during MuFuUnSun. Spon
sors of the event include Stanford

Concert Network, Stanford Feder
al Credit Union and Jansport,
which is giving away free back
packs as promotional items.
According to Martinez, fresh
men can look forward to making
some of their best memories during
Orientation week.
"[Students] learn about differ
ent communities that they have
never been in contact with before,"
she said. "They learn about Stan
ford ... [and] they meet some of
their best friends."
