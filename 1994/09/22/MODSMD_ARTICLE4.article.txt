# U.S. News ranks Farm fifth among research universities

### Jim Luh Staff writer 
We're number five.
Or so says the latest incarnation of the
U.S. News and World Report Guide to
America's Best Colleges, an annual survey

that has become a sort of handbook of colle
giate one-upmanship, which hit news
stands Monday.
The survey ranks Stanford fifth, one
place higher than its sixth-place ranking
last year. Before placing fifth this year,
Stanford had fallen in the rankings for
three consecutive years since placing sec
ond in 1990.
But Robert Morse, the U.S. News and
World Report senior editor who handles the
rankings, attributed the rise more to
changes in the magazine's ranking criteria
than any improvement in the quality of the
University.
"Stanford probably remained un
changed" in terms of quality, Morse said.
The survey measures each school's per
formance in categories like academic repu
tation, student selectivity, faculty re
sources, financial resources, graduation
rate and alumni satisfaction, using numer
ical data and a nationwide survey of univer
sity administrators.
Previously, U.S. News and World Report
determined the alumni satisfaction level by
examining the overall percentage of alumni
donating to university fund drives.
This year, the magazine considered only
undergraduate-alumni giving, and Stan
ford's alumni giving rate jumped from 18
percent to 25 percent.
"[Stanford's] alumni satisfaction im
proved by almost 30 places as a result of this
change," Morse said.
Stanford had a role in changing the rat
ing methodology for alumni satisfaction,
Morse said — a University Development
Office employee had suggested the change,


Elise Wolfgram — Daily
he said.
Associate Vice President for
Development Steven Peeps said his
office joined other colleges and uni
versities in suggesting the change
to make the alumni giving measure
more equitable.
"It was not a fair comparison,"
Peeps said.
Peeps said graduate students
typically show more loyalty to their
undergraduate institutions than
they do their graduate institutions.
Consequently, he said, under the
old system, universities like Stan

ford would tend to have deceptively
lower alumni giving rates than col
leges such as Dartmouth, which
does not have graduate programs.
Other changes to the ratings cri
teria probably acted to Stanford's
disadvantage, but not enough to
offset the benefit of the change in
determining alumni satisfaction,
Morse said.
"I think Stanford was helped
mainly by the change in how the
alumni giving rate was calculated,"
he added.
University administrators said
they were pleased with the survey
results. "We're happy to be ranked
among the very top universities in
the world," said Assxnate Dean of
Admissions Bill Ting'ey.

"I do feel that Stanford is defi
nitely an institution on the move,"
Tingley said. "I would not be sur
prised if, in the next few years,
Stanford would inch its way high
er."
Tingley said he believed the
rankings do not have any major
effect on Stanford's appeal to
prospective students and their par
ents, though occasionally the rank
ings enter the talk at the admis
sions office's on-the-road presenta
tions. When that happens, Tingley
said, admissions officers try to put
the rankings in their proper per
spective.
Tingley said it was important
not to put too much stock in
attempts to numerically rank the

top colleges.
"I think when you're up in the
top five ... the institutions are
interchangeable."
Morse agreed, saying there is lit
tle difference in quality among the
top five or six schools in the maga
zine's rankings.
"The rankings are very close at
the top," Morse said.
Harvard University ranked
number one among national uni
versities for the fifth consecutive
year, followed by Princeton Uni
versity, Yale University and MIT,
in that order.
Cal Tech, which beat out Stan
ford for fifth last year, fell to sev
enth this year, behind Duke Uni
versity.
