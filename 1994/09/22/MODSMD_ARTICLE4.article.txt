We're number five.
Or so says the latest incarnation of the
U.S. News and World Report Guide to
America's Best Colleges, an annual survey

that has become a sort of handbook of colle

rankings, attributed the rise more to

sources, financial resources, graduation
rate and alumni satisfaction, using numer

Office employee had suggested the change,
