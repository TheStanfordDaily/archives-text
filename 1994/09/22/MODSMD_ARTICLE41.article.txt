# Diversity key on the Farm
## Multiculturalism encourages awareness of identity groups 
### Shirley Park Staff writer 
Getting a handle on the meaning of "multicul
turalism" is harder than it looks — perceptions of
multiculturalism at Stanford are about as diverse
as the individuals the term reflects.
Nonetheless, it is quite possibly Stanford's most
distinctive feature for many incoming students.
Multicultural Educator Tommy Lee Woon of
fers his personal vision of multiculturalism as "an
effort to recognize all identity groups." Woon in
cludes people of different races, genders, ethnici
ties, sexual orientations, religions, classes and dis
abilities in core identity groups.
Coming to a University filled with people who
represent almost every conceivable combination of
these identity groups can, however, be something
of a culture shock for some new students.
Freshman Gwen Williams said she comes from a
small, homogenous high school in St. Louis, Mo.
"When I came here and visited, [multicultural
ism] was something I did notice," she said. "It is
something I do want in my experience here."
Students who wish to better understand the
multifaceted Stanford community need not wait
long — Orientation programs like "Faces of Com
munity" immediately expose freshmen to their di
verse surroundings.
"I got the picture from the start that multicul
turalism was very important here," said sopho
more Denise Ho, recalling last year's Orientation
programs.
Although Ho conceded multiculturalism at
Stanford is generally a good thing, she said she
thinks it is overemphasized.
"It's enforced so much, it's like indoctrination,"
she said, adding that a true multicultural atmos
phere would be obvious to students and wouldn't
have to be continually pointed
out.
The concept of multicultural
ism is cultivated in dorms, where
Residential Education programs
traditionally highlight related
issues like tolerance and accep
tance, said Twain Resident Assis
tant Sonya Smith.
For example, Twain RAs plan
to assemble panels of four stu
dents from within the house to
discuss diversity issues. Smith
said she anticipated these discus
sions will display different ethnic
— and possibly religious — back
grounds, but will also show vari
ety and diversity within a certain
group.
Twain residents will also be
able to participate in what RA

Rodrigo Liang dubbed "exotic eat
ing experiences." Every Friday
night, students will be able to join
each other in a cultural dinner —
"Thai, Ethiopian, things that are
a little different," Liang said.
Although Stanford boasts
diversity, there remains the ques
tion of whether the University
has achieved the ideal multicul
tural atmosphere.
According to Woon, there is a
distinction between the words
"diversity" and "multicultural
ism."
Woon sees diversity as "the
numerical representation of
groups," whereas multicultural
ism — or his preferred term "cul
tural pluralism" — is the organi
zation of diverse groups in a com
munity.
"We've done a pretty good job
[with cultural pluralism], but we
have more work to do," Woon
said.
