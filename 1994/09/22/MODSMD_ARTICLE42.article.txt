# Roomies: blind luck or skilled matching?
## 
### Laura Shin Staff writer 
New students, many of whom
have trouble matching socks in
their laundry, may visualize an
entire army of housing officials
employed in the task of matching
1,590 freshmen with suitable
roommates.
The truth? Far from it.
The job of matching 787 men
and 803 women with compatible
roommates falls to only two stu
dents — the coordinators of the
New Undergraduate Student In
formation Project (or NUSIP),
seniors Carolyn Laub and
Kausik Rajgopal. Laub, the se
nior coordinator, took part last
year while Rajgopal will stay to
coordinate the project again next
year, ensuring continuity within
the project.
First off, the coordinators
place students into dormitories,
then divide men and women
within those dorm groups. Al
though the NUSIP coordinators
put transfers into dorms, they do
not pair transfers in specific
rooms; each dorm has its own
process for transfers.
Beginning their ambitious
task, the coordinators review in
formation on each student, ask

ing themselves "Are Students A
and Z in different CIV tracks and
Writing and Critical Thinking
courses? Are they from different
geographic areas, and of differ
ent ethnicities? . . . When this
hall and the other halls in the
dorm are put together, will the
entire dorm have a makeup sim
ilar to that of the entire new
class of students?"
After these prerequisites are
out of the way and the dorms
look like microcosms of the
freshman class in terms of diver
sity, the two said they turn to
more personal factoids students
have provided on preference
sheets they were asked to fill out
at the beginning of last summer.
Although the NUSIP coordi
nators seek "geographical diver
sity, ethnic diversity and acade
mic interest diversity" within
each room, hall and dorm, pairs
must be compatible in some
areas, Laub said. With this in
mind, roommates are paired ac
cording to their interests in
music, sports and activities.
Laub said she finds it difficult
to couple people based on a few
lines about each person — for ex
ample, "lots of different kinds of
people listen to alternative music,"
she said.
"I'm never hoping that I make
best friends," she said, adding that
with all the possible combinations,
it's almost impossible to make all
the rooms perfectly compatible.
Within triples and quadruples,
the dynamics "get a little trickier,"
Laub said, but all three or four of
the roommates need not have the
same common ground.
The NUSIP coordinators' other
job is to answer all questions new
students and their parents may
have about coming to Stanford.
Common questions involve what
and what not to bring, like "what
furniture is in the room — should
they bring a lamp or a mirror?" said
Laub.

Others call wanting to know the
names of their roommates, but the
NUSIP coordinators do not reveal
that information.
Not knowing roommates before
arriving on campus may be frustrat
ing, but since "people come from a
variety of backgrounds, ... no one
knows his or her roommate, and
everyone's meeting people for the
first time," explained Beth Schmid,
undergraduate housing supervisor.
Anonymity prevents people from
makingjudgments about their room
mates based on their names or the
cities that they come from, she said.
Besides this more philosophical
reason, there is another, more prac
tical consideration: "there are many
changes at the last minute," Schmid
said, and roommates are not
announced so people do not end up
spending time getting to know each
other, only to find out later that
they are no longer going to be room
mates.
