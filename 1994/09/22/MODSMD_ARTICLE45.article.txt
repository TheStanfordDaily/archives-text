# Campus politics: Your guide to the ASSU
## 
### Michael Slemmer Editorial Staff 
If you ask average Stanford
upperclassmen about student
government, they will probably
recognize little more than the
posters which plaster campus
before the spring elections.
But beyond the election hype,
the Associated Students of Stan
ford University (ASSU) Senators
and Presidents are involved in
activities and controversies rang
ing from University restructuring
to funding for student programs.
The organization itself incor
porates deliberative and financial
arms — both of which can play a
significant role in student life. Its
major functions include collecting
and distributing student fees, tak
ing student issues to the adminis

tration and providing on-campus
services.
The ASSU Senate, which con
sists of 20 graduate and 20 under
graduate students, ultimately
controls the operation and direc
tion of the student government.
In addition, a four-member Coun
cil of Presidents directs the
ASSU's day-to-day activities, act
ing also as the students' official
representatives to the University
administration.
Elections for both the senate
and COP are held during spring
quarter. In the past, two political
parties — People's Platform and
Students First — vied for power
in the campus-wide ASSU elec
tions, but more recently partisan
politics have fallen out of favor.
To provide funding for student
groups, the ASSU levies a fee

which is included as part of stu
dents' quarterly tuition bills. The
fee, which this year amounts to
$34, is actually an accumulation
of individual contributions to
campus groups.
In the spring elections, stu
dents vote to decide which
groups receive funding through
this special-fee process. In addi
tion, students vote on the three
general fees — publications
board, program board and com
munity service board — which
disburse money to smaller stu
dent groups.
In order to account for stu
dents' objections to the funding of
particular campus organizations,
the ASSU built a safety valve into
the fee system years ago: students
may request a refund of any or all
of the fees levied for the groups.

Because refunded money does
not reach the campus groups, this
process has become a tool
through which students express
their displeasure with student
government. Last year, graduate
students discontented with their
lack of representation in the
ASSU organized a "refund revolt"
which significantly decreased the
funding available for many stu
dent organizations.
Despite the seeming contro
versy over ASSU policies, the
most prominent feature of Stan
ford student government has
always been student apathy. Last
spring, many campus groups lost
their funding despite receiving a
majority of the votes cast
because fewer than 40 percent of
the students managed even to
cast ballots.
