# Simple tips help new students play it safe on the Farm
## 
### Frank Guinan Staff writer 
Greetings from cheery resident
assistants, helping hands from
smiling orientation volunteers and
introductions to 100 new light
hearted faces ... Stanford seems
like a pretty secure place to many

new students.
In making the transition to cam
pus life, however, freshmen and
transfer students often become
overly trusting and rather careless
during their first few days on the
Farm.
And why shouldn't they? In a
recent study of 58 schools called

"Crime at College: the Student
Guide to Public Safety," Stanford
was ranked one of the 15 safest
campuses in the nation.
But don't be fooled. Crime does
occur here on the Farm — and the
atmosphere of Orientation can be
the ideal time for crooks to make
their mark.

In most cases, however, simple
precautionary measures can help
deter theft from ruining a good
first year.
Lock up that bike
For the past decade and a half,
the number one reported crime on
campus has been bicycle theft. In
1993 alone, 829 bikes were report
ed stolen, and through July 31 this
year, bike theft accounted for 530
police reports.
But Stanford Police speculate
the actual number of thefts is twice
that number, since many do not
bother to report their stolen bikes.
"We are trying very hard to
[decrease the trend]," Stanford
Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer said.
"[Bike thieves] just come out of the
woodwork."
To avoid becoming one of the
many unfortunate victims,
Niemeyer advises students to lock
up their bicycles. Although U-locks
are the most effective locking
devices, he also recommends get
ting "Bad Bones," which span the
length of the lock and can make it
five times stronger.
"[Thieves] tend to stay away
from bikes with that device on it,"
he said.
Niemeyer also added that there
is little value in locking a bike to
itself, since thieves can just "toss
the bike onto a truck and go." He
recommended locking bikes to an
immovable object, such as a bicycle
rack or post.
Most of the bikes recovered are
high-quality mountain bikes,

according to Niemeyer. Obviously,
he said, the better the quality of the
bike, the higher the likelihood that
it will get stolen.
This year the Stanford Police
are working to be more visible and

catch more bike
thieves, Niemeyer
said. He also urges
everyone to regis
ter his or her bike
with the police
department
because "without
a victim, we can't
prosecute [a
thief]."

Daniel Smith, special services
manager at the Department of
Public Safety, echoed Niemeyer's
urge to register bikes.
"It's not unusual for the police
to catch a thief but have no victim,"
he said.
Smith added that bike registra
tion will continue to be easy this
year: for a fee of $3.50, students
can register their bikes at the
Tresidder Recreation Center as
well as at Transportation Pro
grams on 855 Serra St.
A team from his department
will be at several campus sites dur
ing the week in an effort to encour
age students to register their
beloved two-wheeled possessions,
he said.
In addition, California state law
mandates that anyone under 18
wear a helmet when riding a bike.
The law also "strongly encourages"
those 18 years and older to wear a
helmet, and bike lights continue to

be required for those riding at
night.
Dorm room security
Ideally, dorm residences are
supposed to be locked up after mid
night. This is usually not the case,
however, since students go in and
out of their dorms well after that
time. Many choose to prop the door
open as they make their early
morning rounds.
Fortunately, burglars do not
usually try their luck in the dorms
after midnight. Instead, many
know when students won't be in
and hit the dorms while most stu
dents are at lunch, dinner or in the
shower.
"All it takes is for [burglars] to
walk down the hall and try one of
the doors," Niemeyer said.
In 1993, there were 178 reports
of structural burglary, and for the
first half of this year, 111 burglar
ies were reported to the police
department.
There is, however, a simple solu
tion to keep from becoming a
statistic, Niemeyer said — keep
doors locked whenever rooms are
empty, even if it will be for a short
period of time.
In addition, 137 cases of vehicle
burglary were reported in 1993 and
60 in the first half of 1994.
According to Stanford Police,
this time of year is notorious for
vehicle burglary since there are so
many students moving things into
their new residences.

As Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer suggests, all bikes should be locked to immovable objects and "Bad
Bones" should be used tor added protection.

Concerns about assault
Compared to property crime,
"body crime" (like aggravated
and sexual assault) is relatively
minor on the Stanford campus.
In all of 1993, there were six
reports of aggravated assault;
there have been four through
the end of July this year. No
forcible sex offenses were
reported last year, and this
year two have been reported to
the Stanford Police.
Most sexual assaults are
acquaintance (or date) rape,
and often involve alcohol,
Niemeyer said. Two non
acquaintance rapes have been
reported in the past four years.
The Department of Public
Safety strongly recommends
using routes highlighted on the
Suggested Travel Routes Map.
Although they may not be the
shortest distance between two
points, the routes are well trav
eled, adequately lighted and
located in open-space areas.
SURE Escort Services are
also available and will accom
pany students by motorized
cart anywhere on campus. Stu
dents can contact the free ser
vice by calling 725-SURE.
Perhaps the most important
crime-busting tip is personal
awareness and responsibility.
If a situation feels suspicious
or threatening, change direc
tions, go to a populated area,
call a friend to meet you, or call
9-911 on a campus phone or
911 from an off-campus phone.
If you are the victim of a
crime, call the police immedi
ately — when a crime goes
unreported, a criminal may
attack again. Also make sure to
report any suspicious persons,
vehicles or activities to the
police.
In order to help those who
have been sexually assaulted,
the Sexual Assault Resource
Center located in Cowell Stu
dent Health Center is open 8:00
to 5:00 Monday through Friday
for information and counseling.
In addition, the Campus Sexual
Assault and Recovery Team is
available 8:30 to 5:00 (also in
Cowell) and operates 24-hour
crisis services.

out of their dorms well after that
time. Many choose to prop the door
open as they make their early
morning rounds.
Fortunately, burglars do not
usually try their luck in the dorms
after midnight. Instead, many
know when students won't be in
and hit the dorms while most stu
dents are at lunch, dinner or in the
shower.
"All it takes is for [burglars] to
walk down the hall and try one of
the doors," Niemeyer said.
In 1993, there were 178 reports
of structural burglary, and for the
first half of this year, 111 burglar
ies were reported to the police
department.
There is, however, a simple solu
tion to keep from becoming a
statistic, Niemeyer said — keep
doors locked whenever rooms are
empty, even if it will be for a short
period of time.
In addition, 137 cases of vehicle
burglary were reported in 1993 and
60 in the first half of 1994.
According to Stanford Police,
this time of year is notorious for
vehicle burglary since there are so
many students moving things into
their new residences.

Concerns about assault
Compared to property crime,
"body crime" (like aggravated
and sexual assault) is relatively
minor on the Stanford campus.
In all of 1993, there were six
reports of aggravated assault;
there have been four through
the end of July this year. No
forcible sex offenses were
reported last year, and this
year two have been reported to
the Stanford Police.
Most sexual assaults are
acquaintance (or date) rape,
and often involve alcohol,
Niemeyer said. Two non
acquaintance rapes have been
reported in the past four years.
The Department of Public
Safety strongly recommends
using routes highlighted on the
Suggested Travel Routes Map.
Although they may not be the
shortest distance between two
points, the routes are well trav
eled, adequately lighted and
located in open-space areas.
SURE Escort Services are
also available and will accom
pany students by motorized
cart anywhere on campus. Stu
dents can contact the free ser
vice by calling 725-SURE.
Perhaps the most important
crime-busting tip is personal
awareness and responsibility.
If a situation feels suspicious
or threatening, change direc
tions, go to a populated area,
call a friend to meet you, or call
9-911 on a campus phone or
911 from an off-campus phone.
If you are the victim of a
crime, call the police immedi
ately — when a crime goes
unreported, a criminal may
attack again. Also make sure to
report any suspicious persons,
vehicles or activities to the
police.
In order to help those who
have been sexually assaulted,
the Sexual Assault Resource
Center located in Cowell Stu
dent Health Center is open 8:00
to 5:00 Monday through Friday
for information and counseling.
In addition, the Campus Sexual
Assault and Recovery Team is
available 8:30 to 5:00 (also in
Cowell) and operates 24-hour
crisis services.
Greetings from cheery resident
assistants, helping hands from
smiling orientation volunteers and
introductions to 100 new light
hearted faces ... Stanford seems
like a pretty secure place to many

new students.
In making the transition to cam
pus life, however, freshmen and
transfer students often become
overly trusting and rather careless
during their first few days on the
Farm.
And why shouldn't they? In a
recent study of 58 schools called

"Crime at College: the Student
Guide to Public Safety," Stanford
was ranked one of the 15 safest
campuses in the nation.
But don't be fooled. Crime does
occur here on the Farm — and the
atmosphere of Orientation can be
the ideal time for crooks to make
their mark.

In most cases, however, simple
precautionary measures can help
deter theft from ruining a good
first year.
Lock up that bike
For the past decade and a half,
the number one reported crime on
campus has been bicycle theft. In
1993 alone, 829 bikes were report
ed stolen, and through July 31 this
year, bike theft accounted for 530
police reports.
But Stanford Police speculate
the actual number of thefts is twice
that number, since many do not
bother to report their stolen bikes.
"We are trying very hard to
[decrease the trend]," Stanford
Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer said.
"[Bike thieves] just come out of the
woodwork."
To avoid becoming one of the
many unfortunate victims,
Niemeyer advises students to lock
up their bicycles. Although U-locks
are the most effective locking
devices, he also recommends get
ting "Bad Bones," which span the
length of the lock and can make it
five times stronger.
"[Thieves] tend to stay away
from bikes with that device on it,"
he said.
Niemeyer also added that there
is little value in locking a bike to
itself, since thieves can just "toss
the bike onto a truck and go." He
recommended locking bikes to an
immovable object, such as a bicycle
rack or post.
Most of the bikes recovered are
high-quality mountain bikes,

according to Niemeyer. Obviously,
he said, the better the quality of the
bike, the higher the likelihood that
it will get stolen.
This year the Stanford Police
are working to be more visible and

catch more bike
thieves, Niemeyer
said. He also urges
everyone to regis
ter his or her bike
with the police
department
because "without
a victim, we can't
prosecute [a
thief]."

Daniel Smith, special services
manager at the Department of
Public Safety, echoed Niemeyer's
urge to register bikes.
"It's not unusual for the police
to catch a thief but have no victim,"
he said.
Smith added that bike registra
tion will continue to be easy this
year: for a fee of $3.50, students
can register their bikes at the
Tresidder Recreation Center as
well as at Transportation Pro
grams on 855 Serra St.
A team from his department
will be at several campus sites dur
ing the week in an effort to encour
age students to register their
beloved two-wheeled possessions,
he said.
In addition, California state law
mandates that anyone under 18
wear a helmet when riding a bike.
The law also "strongly encourages"
those 18 years and older to wear a
helmet, and bike lights continue to

be required for those riding at
night.
Dorm room security
Ideally, dorm residences are
supposed to be locked up after mid
night. This is usually not the case,
however, since students go in and
out of their dorms well after that
time. Many choose to prop the door
open as they make their early
morning rounds.
Fortunately, burglars do not
usually try their luck in the dorms
