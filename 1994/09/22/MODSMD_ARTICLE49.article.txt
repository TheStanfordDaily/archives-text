# On-line services put students in fast lane
## Computer system simple, but helpful

Taking a leisurely cruise on the
information superhighway ... top
down, music on, choices to make,
computer lingo to conquer.
Although the prevailing myth
seems to suggest that only a select
few have mastered the trip, navigat
ing along the silicon express is easi
er than most think.
In fact all Stanford students,
whether first year or post-docs,
must merge onto a computer-based
information and registration system
called Folio.
Not to fear. Driver's education
for Folio on-ramps is a cinch.
All that new students need in
order to cruise onto Folio is a student
identification number, and for some
services, a five to eight digit personal
identification number (PIN).
After logging on to Folio (direc
tions can be found in most campus
computer clusters), students have
myriad options and can tap into a
number of special services.
One option is Axess, the most
popular and necessary of Folio's
options. Among countless other fea
tures, Axess allows students to reg
ister, enter a class list, drop classes
and view grades. Every student
must know his or her way around
Axess, which becomes the link
between students and their admin
istrative and academic duties.
But Folio is much more than
Axess — it is a comprehensive infor
mation resource for the Stanford
community.
Socrates, one such information
storehouse on Folio, is an on-line
card catalog which allows Stanford
affiliates to search for and request
books, movies and journals housed
in the campus's main libraries.
But not all students are in the
market for books and research
materials. Some need on-campus
jobs, others want to start searching
for an internship, while others des
perately need scholarships and
grants to finance their education.
Folio can make all this easily avail
able.

Folio's student employment file
provides facts about all on-campus
student employment opportunities,
whether they are federally or
departmentally funded.
Yet another of the system's perks
is Odyssey, which details on- and
off-campus internships, volunteer
work and research opportunities.
Meanwhile, the Awards file contains
information on fellowships and
scholarships students may wish to
apply for or pursue.
All of these files are exhaustive
resources, listing opportunities
across all spectrums. On Folio, stu
dents can search for an internship
in Brownsville, Texas, or a scholar
ship given to fraternal twins who
dress identically.
For students working on a
research paper who want more than
on-campus libraries can provide
there's Lexis-Nexis, a database
brimming with general news, busi
ness and legal information.
Lexis-Nexis — which can only
be used by nine students or facul
ty simultaneously — can provide
sources on topics ranging from
California state penal codes to
the marital status of Michael
Jackson and Lisa Marie Presley-
Jackson.
Folio offers other options, but
most students venture past its ser
vices into other computer-based
realms such as electronic mail. E
mail is a networking system which
allows students to send messages to
others nationally and international
ly as long as they also have e-mail
accounts.
All students can, and should,
open an e-mail account. Many pro
fessors prefer communicating via e
mail, and the probability of receiv
ing a response is much higher when
using e-mail rather than phone calls
and voice mail messages.
Students can initiate their free e
mail accounts at any campus com
puter cluster. Generally, instruc
tions for the simple process will be
available in the cluster, but many
Resident Computer Consultants
also lead e-mail workshops at the
beginning of each year.
