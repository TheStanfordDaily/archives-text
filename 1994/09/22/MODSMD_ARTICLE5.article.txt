# University gives ethnic centers $200,000 grant
## Money comes amid resignations 
### Victor Haseman Michael Slemmer Staff writers 
In an effort to follow through
on the University's commitment
to prioritize funds for Stanford's
four ethnic centers, the adminis
tration announced Sept. 7 that
the centers will receive an addi
tional $200,000 over the next two
years.
The decision comes in the af
termath of last year's student
protests over rumored ethnic-cen
ter cuts and, more recently, the
summer resignations of both
Black Community Services Cen
ter Acting Director Barbara
Smith and Assistant Director
Shaun McAlmont.
Administrators, however, say
that the funding and the resigna
tions are essentially unrelated.
They "are very separate.. . .
The president did not know these
people were resigning" when he
allocated the money to the cen
ters, said Dean of Students
Michael Jackson. "He was follow
ing through on a commitment to
the centers.
"The timing was a coinci
dence," he said, noting that the
ethnic centers were on the first
tier — meaning they have top pri
ority for fund raising — of Uni
versity President Gerhard
Casper's overall budget plan last
year.
According to Vice Provost and
Dean of Student Affairs Mary
Edmonds, Casper made the deci
sion to find more funds for the
centers in the first part of July. He
"has always felt the ethnic centers
serve an important function in the
University," Edmonds said.
The two-year funding will
increase the centers' collective
annual budget of $579,000 by
almost 20 percent.
The decision to augment the
funding stems from the fact that
the centers as a collective "created
a very good strategic plan that
spoke to the things the centers
can do to support the progress of
students," Jackson said.
The administration requested
last fall that the ethnic centers
submit a strategic plan detailing
their purpose and activities.
Because all areas of the Universi
ty were candidates for budget cuts
at that time, the plans included

funding projections for possible
5,15 and 30 percent cuts.
Though the plans were used in
some cases to provide direction for
budget cuts, Jackson said they
also provided the administration
with a "sense of what needed to be
prioritized."
"The original thought was to
come up with a plan explaining
how the centers contribute to the
University's mission," he said.
The plan could then be used to
target either cuts or new funding.
This new ethnic center funding
is the most recent episode in the
centers' ongoing search for
money, dating back to 1989, when

the University
Committee on
Minority Issues y
recommended at j
least a $7,500 I
increase in the"
centers' annual
allotments. Since |
then, this target |
has not been fully I
realized, and the

possibility of budget cuts last year
brought vocal protest from stu
dents in the ethnic communities.
Putting the newly announced
funding in perspective, Denni
Woodward, assistant director of
the American Indian Program
Office, noted that the new fund
ing is comparable to the total
funding the centers would have
received had the UCMI recom
mendations been implemented in
1989.
In other words, the new fund
ing gives each center $50,000 over
the next two years, while the
UCMI recommendations would
have garnered $37,500 for the
centers over the past five years.
The centers deserve the fund
ing because they have shown
themselves to be wise invest

merits, Jackson said.
"The centers have proven that
the University gets a real good
bang for its buck" when it allo
cates them money, he said. "They
provide educational programs
around ethnicity and programs
that help retain students. Over
time.. . the centers have taken on
a greater importance."
And the centers believe they
have managed to do this with
severely under-funded budgets.
"We in the centers breathed a sigh
of relief" when we found out about
the funding, Woodward said.
He said the funding is particu
larly important in his office
because the majority of Native
American programming is funded
almost entirely by student organi
zations.
But at this point, the centers
have not laid concrete plans for
the new funding beyond earmark
ing it for retention
and educational jind cultural pro
gramming.
"It's good we have the money
at the beginning of the year," said
Frances Morales, director of El
Centro Chicano. "We know some
needs of the centers, but we need
to meet with the staff' before
deciding what to do with the
money.
But despite the money, there is
still some unresolved tension
between the ethnic centers and
the administration stemming
from Smith's resignation.
Smith, who has served in a
variety of positions in her 14 years
with the University, cited a "lack
of support and leadership, not
only for the BCSC, but for the
Ethnic Centers in general," as her
primary reason for leaving her
post after serving as acting direc
tor for two years following the
resignation of Keith Archuleta.

Blair Bowman, a resident fel
low in Mirrielees House and a
1992 graduate of the Law School,
was selected as interim director,
and Katrinna Youmans, a veteran
of Human Resources and Student
Affairs since 1974, as assistant
director.
Smith's resignation caught
many by surprise, including
Edmonds, who said she was sorry
to see her go. "It is important to
understand that none of us want
ed her resignation," Edmonds
said.
Her departure, however, coin
cided with the decision to re-open
the national search for a perma
nent director for the BCSC.
Both Edmonds and Jackson
said that while Smith was defi
nitely qualified, standard admin
istration policy is to conduct a
national search in order to find
the most competitive candidate.
Edmonds also added that in the
event that Smith was not chosen,
she still would be able to return to
her original position of assistant
director.
In her letter of resignation to
Jackson, however, Smith charged,
"I cannot understand why neither
of you (Jackson and Edmonds)
has given concrete reasons for not
encouraging me to apply for the
position. You have discussed the
Director's search in 'worst-case
scenario' terms in recent meet
ings and not once have you
encouraged my application for or
appointment to the position."
Smith also specifically criti
cized her superiors' handling of
an incident involving three black
students — senior Christopher
Donald, and 1994 graduates
Michael Pickrum and Rhonda
Sharpe — who, without Smith's
knowledge, submitted to
Edmonds a comprehensive state

merit about the direction they felt
the BCSC should be heading.
Smith indicated in her resigna
tion letter that the students' doc
ument closely paralleled the
BCSC strategic plan her staff had
been developing since winter
quarter. Yet Smith claimed that,
while the document was present-

Ed to Edmonds
last May, it did
not reach
Smith's hands
until July 28 — a
delay of more
than 60 days.
Edmonds,
however, con
tends that she
did make Smith

aware of the document and gave
Smith a copy of it when she asked
for it.
Both the strategic plan and the
students' statement call for closer
ties among the BCSC, the black
community and the University
administration. In addition, both
stress the importance of retention
and recruitment of black students
through improved links between
the faculty and students.
Donald also emphasized the
good intentions behind submit
ting the document, saying that
"we [saw] a void that needed to be
addressed administratively."
In a letter to the black commu
nity, Edmonds explained the res
ignations of Smith and McAl
mont, citing McAlmont's accep
tance of a multicultural advisory
position at Brigham Young Uni
versity and Smith's wish to accel
erate the completion of her under
graduate degree.
However, Almaz Andu, a junior
who interned in the BCSC over
the summer, disagreed with
Edmonds' explanation of Smith's
departure, given the many other

points she raised in her letter of
resignation to Jackson.
McAlmont did not return
phone calls yesterday.
Still, as the search committee
for a permanent BCSC director
begins to take form, all remain
optimistic. Donald sees the search
for a new director as a blank slate.
"We have the opportunity of a
lifetime," he said. It is "a chance
to participate in something that
will benefit ourselves as well as
future black classes. If we gripe
we will lose and only the commu
nity will suffer."
And junior Johnathon Briggs,
the BCSC media coordinator, said
that, though he is frustrated by
what he sees as a "gap" between
rhetoric and reality, he is also
ready to push forward.
"The real problem is that the
administration does not care
about the ethnic centers or com
munities of colors," he said. "If
they did, the centers would not be
so poorly funded."
Although Jackson denied any
relation between the funding and
Smith's and McAlmont's resigna
tions, Woodward said she felt the
timing of the events was "terri
ble." She said she believes that "it
makes [the situation] look like
something we hope it's not."
Morales is also wary of the
extra $200,000. "If it's a good
program," she said, "hopefully
other departments will pick it up.
It's a problem funding something
long term. My hope is that this is
the beginning of long-term fund
ing."
She also expressed the hope
that this funding may be the
beginning of a new University
commitment to the ethnic cen
ters. "Perhaps now we can put
some of the UCMI recommenda
tions to work," she said.

the centers as a collective "created
a very good strategic plan that
spoke to the things the centers
can do to support the progress of
students," Jackson said.
The administration requested
last fall that the ethnic centers
submit a strategic plan detailing
their purpose and activities.
Because all areas of the Universi
ty were candidates for budget cuts
at that time, the plans included

funding projections for possible
5,15 and 30 percent cuts.
Though the plans were used in
some cases to provide direction for
budget cuts, Jackson said they
also provided the administration
with a "sense of what needed to be
prioritized."
"The original thought was to
come up with a plan explaining
how the centers contribute to the
University's mission," he said.
The plan could then be used to
target either cuts or new funding.
This new ethnic center funding
is the most recent episode in the
centers' ongoing search for
money, dating back to 1989, when

the University
Committee on
Minority Issues y
recommended at j
least a $7,500 I
increase in the"
centers' annual
allotments. Since |
then, this target |
has not been fully I
realized, and the

possibility of budget cuts last year
brought vocal protest from stu
dents in the ethnic communities.
Putting the newly announced
funding in perspective, Denni
Woodward, assistant director of
the American Indian Program
Office, noted that the new fund
ing is comparable to the total
funding the centers would have
received had the UCMI recom
mendations been implemented in
1989.
In other words, the new fund
ing gives each center $50,000 over
the next two years, while the
UCMI recommendations would
have garnered $37,500 for the
centers over the past five years.
The centers deserve the fund
ing because they have shown
themselves to be wise invest

merits, Jackson said.
"The centers have proven that
the University gets a real good
bang for its buck" when it allo
cates them money, he said. "They
provide educational programs
around ethnicity and programs
that help retain students. Over
time.. . the centers have taken on
a greater importance."
And the centers believe they
have managed to do this with
severely under-funded budgets.
"We in the centers breathed a sigh
of relief" when we found out about
the funding, Woodward said.
He said the funding is particu
larly important in his office
because the majority of Native
American programming is funded
almost entirely by student organi
zations.
But at this point, the centers
have not laid concrete plans for
the new funding beyond earmark
ing it for retention
and educational jind cultural pro
gramming.
"It's good we have the money
at the beginning of the year," said
Frances Morales, director of El
Centro Chicano. "We know some
needs of the centers, but we need
to meet with the staff' before
deciding what to do with the
money.
But despite the money, there is
still some unresolved tension
between the ethnic centers and
the administration stemming
from Smith's resignation.
Smith, who has served in a
variety of positions in her 14 years
with the University, cited a "lack
of support and leadership, not
only for the BCSC, but for the
Ethnic Centers in general," as her
primary reason for leaving her
post after serving as acting direc
tor for two years following the
resignation of Keith Archuleta.

Blair Bowman, a resident fel
low in Mirrielees House and a
1992 graduate of the Law School,
was selected as interim director,
and Katrinna Youmans, a veteran
of Human Resources and Student
Affairs since 1974, as assistant
director.
Smith's resignation caught
many by surprise, including
Edmonds, who said she was sorry
to see her go. "It is important to
understand that none of us want
ed her resignation," Edmonds
said.
Her departure, however, coin
cided with the decision to re-open
the national search for a perma
nent director for the BCSC.
Both Edmonds and Jackson
said that while Smith was defi
nitely qualified, standard admin
istration policy is to conduct a
national search in order to find
the most competitive candidate.
Edmonds also added that in the
event that Smith was not chosen,
she still would be able to return to
her original position of assistant
director.
In her letter of resignation to
Jackson, however, Smith charged,
"I cannot understand why neither
of you (Jackson and Edmonds)
has given concrete reasons for not
encouraging me to apply for the
position. You have discussed the
Director's search in 'worst-case
scenario' terms in recent meet
ings and not once have you
encouraged my application for or
appointment to the position."
Smith also specifically criti
cized her superiors' handling of
an incident involving three black
students — senior Christopher
Donald, and 1994 graduates
Michael Pickrum and Rhonda
Sharpe — who, without Smith's
knowledge, submitted to
Edmonds a comprehensive state

merit about the direction they felt
the BCSC should be heading.
Smith indicated in her resigna
tion letter that the students' doc
ument closely paralleled the
BCSC strategic plan her staff had
been developing since winter
quarter. Yet Smith claimed that,
while the document was present-

Ed to Edmonds
last May, it did
not reach
Smith's hands
until July 28 — a
delay of more
than 60 days.
Edmonds,
however, con
tends that she
did make Smith

aware of the document and gave
Smith a copy of it when she asked
for it.
Both the strategic plan and the
students' statement call for closer
ties among the BCSC, the black
community and the University
administration. In addition, both
stress the importance of retention
and recruitment of black students
through improved links between
the faculty and students.
Donald also emphasized the
good intentions behind submit
ting the document, saying that
"we [saw] a void that needed to be
addressed administratively."
In a letter to the black commu
nity, Edmonds explained the res
ignations of Smith and McAl
mont, citing McAlmont's accep
tance of a multicultural advisory
position at Brigham Young Uni
versity and Smith's wish to accel
erate the completion of her under
graduate degree.
However, Almaz Andu, a junior
who interned in the BCSC over
the summer, disagreed with
Edmonds' explanation of Smith's
departure, given the many other

points she raised in her letter of
resignation to Jackson.
McAlmont did not return
phone calls yesterday.
Still, as the search committee
for a permanent BCSC director
begins to take form, all remain
optimistic. Donald sees the search
for a new director as a blank slate.
"We have the opportunity of a
lifetime," he said. It is "a chance
to participate in something that
will benefit ourselves as well as
future black classes. If we gripe
we will lose and only the commu
nity will suffer."
And junior Johnathon Briggs,
the BCSC media coordinator, said
that, though he is frustrated by
what he sees as a "gap" between
rhetoric and reality, he is also
ready to push forward.
"The real problem is that the
administration does not care
about the ethnic centers or com
munities of colors," he said. "If
they did, the centers would not be
so poorly funded."
Although Jackson denied any
relation between the funding and
Smith's and McAlmont's resigna
tions, Woodward said she felt the
timing of the events was "terri
ble." She said she believes that "it
makes [the situation] look like
something we hope it's not."
Morales is also wary of the
extra $200,000. "If it's a good
program," she said, "hopefully
other departments will pick it up.
It's a problem funding something
long term. My hope is that this is
the beginning of long-term fund
ing."
She also expressed the hope
that this funding may be the
beginning of a new University
commitment to the ethnic cen
ters. "Perhaps now we can put
some of the UCMI recommenda
tions to work," she said.


Edmonds


Smith
In an effort to follow through
on the University's commitment
to prioritize funds for Stanford's
four ethnic centers, the adminis
tration announced Sept. 7 that
the centers will receive an addi
tional $200,000 over the next two
years.
The decision comes in the af
termath of last year's student
protests over rumored ethnic-cen
ter cuts and, more recently, the
summer resignations of both
Black Community Services Cen
ter Acting Director Barbara
Smith and Assistant Director
Shaun McAlmont.
Administrators, however, say
that the funding and the resigna
tions are essentially unrelated.
They "are very separate.. . .
The president did not know these
people were resigning" when he
allocated the money to the cen
ters, said Dean of Students
Michael Jackson. "He was follow
ing through on a commitment to
the centers.
"The timing was a coinci
dence," he said, noting that the
ethnic centers were on the first
tier — meaning they have top pri
ority for fund raising — of Uni
versity President Gerhard
Casper's overall budget plan last
year.
According to Vice Provost and
Dean of Student Affairs Mary
Edmonds, Casper made the deci
sion to find more funds for the
centers in the first part of July. He
"has always felt the ethnic centers
serve an important function in the
University," Edmonds said.
The two-year funding will
increase the centers' collective
annual budget of $579,000 by
almost 20 percent.
The decision to augment the
funding stems from the fact that
the centers as a collective "created

the next two years, while the
UCMI recommendations would
have garnered $37,500 for the
centers over the past five years.
The centers deserve the fund
ing because they have shown
themselves to be wise invest

merits, Jackson said.
"The centers have proven that
the University gets a real good
bang for its buck" when it allo
cates them money, he said. "They
provide educational programs
around ethnicity and programs
that help retain students. Over
time.. . the centers have taken on
a greater importance."
And the centers believe they
have managed to do this with
severely under-funded budgets.
"We in the centers breathed a sigh
of relief" when we found out about
the funding, Woodward said.
He said the funding is particu
larly important in his office
because the majority of Native
American programming is funded
almost entirely by student organi
zations.
But at this point, the centers
have not laid concrete plans for
the new funding beyond earmark
ing it for retention
and educational jind cultural pro
gramming.
"It's good we have the money
at the beginning of the year," said
Frances Morales, director of El
Centro Chicano. "We know some
needs of the centers, but we need
to meet with the staff' before
deciding what to do with the
money.
But despite the money, there is
still some unresolved tension
between the ethnic centers and
the administration stemming
from Smith's resignation.
Smith, who has served in a
variety of positions in her 14 years
with the University, cited a "lack
of support and leadership, not
only for the BCSC, but for the
Ethnic Centers in general," as her
primary reason for leaving her
post after serving as acting direc
tor for two years following the
resignation of Keith Archuleta.

Blair Bowman, a resident fel
low in Mirrielees House and a
1992 graduate of the Law School,
was selected as interim director,
and Katrinna Youmans, a veteran
of Human Resources and Student
Affairs since 1974, as assistant
director.
Smith's resignation caught
many by surprise, including
Edmonds, who said she was sorry
to see her go. "It is important to
understand that none of us want
ed her resignation," Edmonds
said.
Her departure, however, coin
cided with the decision to re-open
the national search for a perma
nent director for the BCSC.
Both Edmonds and Jackson
said that while Smith was defi
nitely qualified, standard admin
istration policy is to conduct a
national search in order to find
the most competitive candidate.
Edmonds also added that in the
event that Smith was not chosen,
she still would be able to return to
her original position of assistant
director.
In her letter of resignation to
Jackson, however, Smith charged,
"I cannot understand why neither
of you (Jackson and Edmonds)
has given concrete reasons for not
encouraging me to apply for the
position. You have discussed the
Director's search in 'worst-case
scenario' terms in recent meet
ings and not once have you
encouraged my application for or
appointment to the position."
Smith also specifically criti
cized her superiors' handling of
an incident involving three black
students — senior Christopher
Donald, and 1994 graduates
Michael Pickrum and Rhonda
Sharpe — who, without Smith's
knowledge, submitted to
Edmonds a comprehensive state

merit about the direction they felt
the BCSC should be heading.
Smith indicated in her resigna
tion letter that the students' doc
ument closely paralleled the
BCSC strategic plan her staff had
been developing since winter
quarter. Yet Smith claimed that,
while the document was present-

Ed to Edmonds
last May, it did
not reach
Smith's hands
until July 28 — a
delay of more
than 60 days.
Edmonds,
however, con
tends that she
did make Smith

aware of the document and gave
Smith a copy of it when she asked
for it.
Both the strategic plan and the
students' statement call for closer
ties among the BCSC, the black
community and the University
administration. In addition, both
stress the importance of retention
and recruitment of black students
through improved links between
the faculty and students.
Donald also emphasized the
good intentions behind submit
ting the document, saying that
"we [saw] a void that needed to be
addressed administratively."
In a letter to the black commu
nity, Edmonds explained the res
ignations of Smith and McAl
mont, citing McAlmont's accep
tance of a multicultural advisory
position at Brigham Young Uni
versity and Smith's wish to accel
erate the completion of her under
graduate degree.
However, Almaz Andu, a junior
who interned in the BCSC over
the summer, disagreed with
Edmonds' explanation of Smith's
departure, given the many other

points she raised in her letter of
resignation to Jackson.
McAlmont did not return
phone calls yesterday.
Still, as the search committee
for a permanent BCSC director
begins to take form, all remain
optimistic. Donald sees the search
for a new director as a blank slate.
"We have the opportunity of a
lifetime," he said. It is "a chance
to participate in something that
will benefit ourselves as well as
future black classes. If we gripe
we will lose and only the commu
nity will suffer."
And junior Johnathon Briggs,
the BCSC media coordinator, said
that, though he is frustrated by
what he sees as a "gap" between
rhetoric and reality, he is also
ready to push forward.
"The real problem is that the
administration does not care
about the ethnic centers or com
munities of colors," he said. "If
they did, the centers would not be
so poorly funded."
Although Jackson denied any
relation between the funding and
Smith's and McAlmont's resigna
tions, Woodward said she felt the
timing of the events was "terri
ble." She said she believes that "it
makes [the situation] look like
something we hope it's not."
Morales is also wary of the
extra $200,000. "If it's a good
program," she said, "hopefully
other departments will pick it up.
It's a problem funding something
long term. My hope is that this is
the beginning of long-term fund
ing."
She also expressed the hope
that this funding may be the
beginning of a new University
commitment to the ethnic cen
ters. "Perhaps now we can put
some of the UCMI recommenda
tions to work," she said.
