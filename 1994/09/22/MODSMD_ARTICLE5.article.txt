### Victor Haseman Michael Slemmer Staff writers 
In an effort to follow through
on the University's commitment
to prioritize funds for Stanford's
four ethnic centers, the adminis
tration announced Sept. 7 that
the centers will receive an addi
tional $200,000 over the next two
years.
The decision comes in the af
termath of last year's student
protests over rumored ethnic-cen
ter cuts and, more recently, the
summer resignations of both
Black Community Services Cen
ter Acting Director Barbara
Smith and Assistant Director
Shaun McAlmont.
