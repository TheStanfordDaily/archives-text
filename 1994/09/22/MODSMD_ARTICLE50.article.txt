# Weenies and axes: campus traditions
## 
### Tish Williams Senior staff writer 
You're here, you got in, you
picked out some semi-attractive yet
reasonably priced bedding and
you're getting the hang of Stanford.
Congratulations, you made it. But
now is not the time to rest on your
laurels.
As you're learning the ropes
here on campus, it's imperative you
make the most of a few fundamen
tal traditions — which will soon
become second-nature, like clap
ping too fast and jumping at just
the right time when the Band plays
"All Right Now."
First things first. You'll soon get
one tradition under your belt by
way of the Orientation square
dance. Yes, it's cheesy. Yes, you'll
look like a redneck. But get out
there and do-si-do your tiny little
heart out — it will be one of those
Hallmark memories of years to
come, unforgettable if only for the
fact that you actually put aside your
embarrassment and kept your
laughing at the caller to a mini
mum.
Soon after comes Full Moon on
the Quad, your one chance for
guilt-free tongue jousting with a
total stranger: you submit because
you're supposed to. In order to
become a Stanford man or woman,
according to legend, a freshman
must kiss a senior in the Quad
under the light of the full moon. It's
a little sleazier and not quite as
poetic as it sounds, but be a good
sport. Hopefully the moon won't
provide enough light for anyone to
recognize you later and incriminate
you in any way.
All the while, you'll see and be
seen at Stanford's one regular
weekly social outing, Flicks. These
almost-up-to-date movie ofTerings
staged in Mem Aud are a great
opportunity to check out male pat
tern baldness trends among those
in the orchestra seats, as well as
your one shot to nail that prep
school kid in your CIV class during
the pre-show paper fight. Word has
it that to achieve the master nir
vanic state of true senior status one
must successfully float a paper air
plane from the balcony and hit the
movie screen.
Halloween sets the scene for a
less wholesome, frenzied rite as the
student body heads on down to the
resting place of our beloved
founders, Mom, Dad and little
Leland, and dances on their graves.
A little morbid and ungrateful, per
haps, but the Mausoleum provides
a perfectly eerie backdrop for the
wickedness of the holiday.
Once November rolls around, all
the cosmic energy on campus focus
es on one deliciously malicious goal:
to beat Cal. Out comes the name
calling (they're a bunch of Wee
nies), the Axe wielding and the
most high-schoolesque display of
Stanford spirit you're gonna get out
of a group of semi-apathetic smart
people.
Stanford recently gave up pos

session of the Axe — a hallowed
article awarded to the winner of
each Big Game. After a fluke loss to
the Weenies last year, the football
team and the whole student body
are hungry to heal some badly
bruised egos.
Big Game week includes many
can't-miss-or-you're-lame events
such as Gaieties, a student-written
comedy revue which takes the
opportunity to playfully go for the
Cal jugular — as well as send the
more visible Stanford icons up in
flames — in a joking, pseudo-plot
filled musical. Hey, and when they
say "Branner sucks," they're only
teasing. Don't take it personally.
You also learn the Axe Cheer
(highlighted by such tricky and com
plex lines as "Give 'em the Axe" and
"Right in the neck"). Although Big
Game week will never be the same
without the towering Bonfire (can
celed last year because of the tiger
salamander population in the
Lakebed), plans are still in the works
to find a "healthy" alternative. The
Axe Committee — trying to stay
away from laser lights this year —
still has submitted no formal plans.

Big Game itself is the one time
you can do the "We Got In" cheer
without feeling like your ego's the
size of Montana. As the Band
dodges frozen oranges thrown
from the stands and the Axe Com
mittee prepares to take back their
baby, the players show Cal who's
got Bill Walsh on the field. And
that electrical night, no matter
what the score, the campus erupts
in snoozing, boredom-ridden
silence as the all-day tailgaters take
their toll and campus turns lame,
lame, lame.
From there, Stanford takes a
turn for the worse as everybody and
anybody tries to reverse the date
less trend that has crushed the
campus under its weight. As fun as
the whole blind date concept is in
theory, in reality it proves even
more painful as dorms throw
Screw-Your-Roommate parties
each quarter. Although you may
not meet your potential soulmate,
it is a good way to get back at your
roommate for their snooze button
addiction.
More twisted, but no less sexu
ally frustrated is Exotic Erotic in

the spring. Trying to pretend they
haven't gotten out of shape yet,
students flock together in scantily
clad, shameless public ecstasy.
This is the one time all year people
get to press their naked flesh
against the naked flesh of others,
reveling in semi-lust and ogling the
disappointingly small socked penis
es and see-through bras of their
dormmates.
And when romantic frustration
doesn't outweigh academic frustra
tion, which usually lasts for two
weeks each quarter during Dead
and Finals weeks, another tradition
rears its ugly head. At midnight,
every night of Dead Week, students
cough their tonsils out in the Pri
mal Scream, yelling out CIV read
ing frustrations and writer's-block
woes.
These are just a few of the tradi
tions which give Stanford its dis
tinctly kicked-back yet amusingly
offbeat atmosphere. No one takes
them very seriously now, but you'll
miss them all-too-soon when you
undergo that last tradition — grad
uation — and become a Geritol
popping alum.

First things first. You'll soon get
one tradition under your belt by
way of the Orientation square
dance. Yes, it's cheesy. Yes, you'll
look like a redneck. But get out
there and do-si-do your tiny little
heart out — it will be one of those
Hallmark memories of years to
come, unforgettable if only for the
fact that you actually put aside your
embarrassment and kept your
laughing at the caller to a mini
mum.
Soon after comes Full Moon on
the Quad, your one chance for
guilt-free tongue jousting with a
total stranger: you submit because
you're supposed to. In order to
become a Stanford man or woman,
according to legend, a freshman
must kiss a senior in the Quad
under the light of the full moon. It's
a little sleazier and not quite as
poetic as it sounds, but be a good
sport. Hopefully the moon won't
provide enough light for anyone to
recognize you later and incriminate
you in any way.
All the while, you'll see and be
seen at Stanford's one regular
weekly social outing, Flicks. These
almost-up-to-date movie ofTerings
staged in Mem Aud are a great
opportunity to check out male pat
tern baldness trends among those
in the orchestra seats, as well as
your one shot to nail that prep
school kid in your CIV class during
the pre-show paper fight. Word has
it that to achieve the master nir
vanic state of true senior status one
must successfully float a paper air
plane from the balcony and hit the
movie screen.
Halloween sets the scene for a
less wholesome, frenzied rite as the
student body heads on down to the
resting place of our beloved
founders, Mom, Dad and little
Leland, and dances on their graves.
A little morbid and ungrateful, per
haps, but the Mausoleum provides
a perfectly eerie backdrop for the
wickedness of the holiday.
Once November rolls around, all
the cosmic energy on campus focus
es on one deliciously malicious goal:
to beat Cal. Out comes the name
calling (they're a bunch of Wee
nies), the Axe wielding and the
most high-schoolesque display of
Stanford spirit you're gonna get out
of a group of semi-apathetic smart
people.
Stanford recently gave up pos

session of the Axe — a hallowed
article awarded to the winner of
each Big Game. After a fluke loss to
the Weenies last year, the football
team and the whole student body
are hungry to heal some badly
bruised egos.
Big Game week includes many
can't-miss-or-you're-lame events
such as Gaieties, a student-written
comedy revue which takes the
opportunity to playfully go for the
Cal jugular — as well as send the
more visible Stanford icons up in
flames — in a joking, pseudo-plot
filled musical. Hey, and when they
say "Branner sucks," they're only
teasing. Don't take it personally.
You also learn the Axe Cheer
(highlighted by such tricky and com
plex lines as "Give 'em the Axe" and
"Right in the neck"). Although Big
Game week will never be the same
without the towering Bonfire (can
celed last year because of the tiger
salamander population in the
Lakebed), plans are still in the works
to find a "healthy" alternative. The
Axe Committee — trying to stay
away from laser lights this year —
still has submitted no formal plans.

Big Game itself is the one time
you can do the "We Got In" cheer
without feeling like your ego's the
size of Montana. As the Band
dodges frozen oranges thrown
from the stands and the Axe Com
mittee prepares to take back their
baby, the players show Cal who's
got Bill Walsh on the field. And
that electrical night, no matter
what the score, the campus erupts
in snoozing, boredom-ridden
silence as the all-day tailgaters take
their toll and campus turns lame,
lame, lame.
From there, Stanford takes a
turn for the worse as everybody and
anybody tries to reverse the date
less trend that has crushed the
campus under its weight. As fun as
the whole blind date concept is in
theory, in reality it proves even
more painful as dorms throw
Screw-Your-Roommate parties
each quarter. Although you may
not meet your potential soulmate,
it is a good way to get back at your
roommate for their snooze button
addiction.
More twisted, but no less sexu
ally frustrated is Exotic Erotic in

the spring. Trying to pretend they
haven't gotten out of shape yet,
students flock together in scantily
clad, shameless public ecstasy.
This is the one time all year people
get to press their naked flesh
against the naked flesh of others,
reveling in semi-lust and ogling the
disappointingly small socked penis
es and see-through bras of their
dormmates.
And when romantic frustration
doesn't outweigh academic frustra
tion, which usually lasts for two
weeks each quarter during Dead
and Finals weeks, another tradition
rears its ugly head. At midnight,
every night of Dead Week, students
cough their tonsils out in the Pri
mal Scream, yelling out CIV read
ing frustrations and writer's-block
woes.
These are just a few of the tradi
tions which give Stanford its dis
tinctly kicked-back yet amusingly
offbeat atmosphere. No one takes
them very seriously now, but you'll
miss them all-too-soon when you
undergo that last tradition — grad
uation — and become a Geritol
popping alum.

On Halloween night, students gather at their favorite haunt, partying and dancing at Jane and Leland
Stanford's tomb.
You're here, you got in, you
picked out some semi-attractive yet
reasonably priced bedding and
you're getting the hang of Stanford.
Congratulations, you made it. But
now is not the time to rest on your
laurels.
As you're learning the ropes
here on campus, it's imperative you
make the most of a few fundamen
tal traditions — which will soon
become second-nature, like clap
ping too fast and jumping at just
the right time when the Band plays
"All Right Now."
First things first. You'll soon get
one tradition under your belt by

dance. Yes, it's cheesy. Yes, you'll
