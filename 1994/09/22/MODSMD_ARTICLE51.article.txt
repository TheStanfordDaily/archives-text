# Public service high priority for students
## 
### Shirley Park Staff writer 
If poet Robert Frost could have
observed public service activities at
Stanford, he might have noted the
majority of students involved in
service work have ""taken the road
less traveled, and that has made all
the difference."
Thanks to a civic-minded stu
dent body and a fabulous new facil
ity — the Haas Center for Public
Service — Stanford has estab
lished itself as a service-oriented
community.
year alone, Stanford stu
dents contributed more than 70,000
hours of service through the Haas
Center, and a senior class survey
taken five years ago reported 70 per
cent of graduating seniors had per
formed public service while enrolled
at Stanford. Incoming freshmen
should find no lack of opportunities
to add to these figures.
Located at Campus Drive and
Salvatierra Street, the public ser
vice center houses 20 affiliated
community service organizations
and Is an ideal place for the service
minded to begin a search for vol
unteer activities.
"More and more first-year stu
dents are entering Stanford with
previous service experience," said
Haas director Timothy Stanton.
"We're trying to encourage them
to continue, and perhaps expand,
what they've done in high school,"
he added.
Haas offers a spectrum of vol
unteer opportunities, from one
time activities such as Alternative
Spring Break, to ongoing tutoring
programs such as Upward Bound.
Many service programs per
form outreach beyond campus,
allowing interaction with local
communities. Several tutoring and
mentorship programs, for exam
ple, work to forge close relation
ships between Stanford students

and East Palo Alto youth.
Students may also choose to
educate and inform their peers
through programs such as Stan
ford-in-Government. SIG has
brought speakers to campus and
has organized a public policy
course in its 30-year Stanford exis
tence, said Stanton.
Student leadership services,
such as SIG, clearly show there are
"many other ways to get involved
besides the traditional tutoring,"
said Jackie Schmidt-Posner, spe
cial assistant to Stanton.
"Service is broader than what
many incoming students think it
is," she said.
Last year, 1,500 students par
ticipated in public service through
the Haas Center, Schmidt-Posner
estimated.
"Stanford students seem to be
involved [in service] at a higher
rate than at other campuses," said
Stanton, who credited both the
students and the availability of
campus resources.
Students may also find that
their academic and service lives
can easily mesh, said Stanton.
For example, the newly created
Public Service Scholars Program
allows students to link service and
academics, culminating in an hon
ors thesis.
While the Haas Center serves
as an umbrella organization for
many service groups, students
may also pursue service through
other resources, including ethnic
centers, the Greek system and pro
grams in residential education.
The staff at the Haas Center's
clearinghouse are trained to
answer questions and direct inter
ested students to possible service
opportunities. The clearinghouse
is open weekdays 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Stanford's on-line network,
Odyssey, also contains more than
600 listings of community service
work.
