# Healthier alternatives to hashing
## Folio helps locate interesting jobs 
### Piers Henwood Staff writer 
With only four years to
explore the endless opportuni
ties available to Stanford stu
dents, why wallow behind the
counter of Wilbur Dining Ser
vice throwing liquefied mashed
potatoes on unappreciative
classmate plates?
For students desiring more
inventive forms of on-campus
employment, take heart. There
is indeed life beyond hashing.
Since 1989, the Financial Aid
Office has provided the Univer
sity with a unique computer
database, rewarding resourceful
students with employment list
ings that stretch well beyond
the boundaries of Food Service.
According to Financial Aid
Assistant Susan Farrell, the
"Student Employment Data
base" is an excellent way for
incoming students to align their
particular interests with job
opportunities.
"Using (the database), every
one can match their interests
with jobs on campus which seem
most appealing to them," she
said.
The database, intended for
students on financial aid only, is
accessible through Folio —
Stanford's on-line computer
network. Folio is available in
dorm and library computer clus
ters across campus.
Job opportunities are divided
into categories, allowing stu
dents to focus on general areas
like counseling, sales, retail or
lab-related employment. After
choosing a category, the student
is presented with information
on jobs listed within that area,
including descriptions of duties
involved, skills required and
hourly wages.
After finding an interesting

job listing 011 the computer, a
student must visit the Financial
Aid Office for contact names
and telephone numbers, Farrell
said.
Particular jobs in the
database are set aside for stu
dents associated with the Feder
al College Work-Study Program.
This work-study program is
designed for students whose
families have an annual income
of $15,000 or less. Employers of
these students are only required
to pay 25 percent of the stu
dent's salary, leaving the federal
government to cover the
remaining 75 percent.
According to Mary Morrison,
assistant director in Financial
Aid Office, this policy aims to
increase the number of employ
ment opportunities for the stu
dents who need them most.

"The students benefit (from
the work-study program)
because everyone wants to hire
them, since the employer need
only pay a quarter of the
salary," she said.
Students interested in
employment who are not on
financial aid may wish to ven
ture into the counseling wing of
the Career Planning and Place
ment Center, where a veritable
library of binders contain
employment information avail
able to anyone. Typical jobs list
ed here range from research
opportunities with Stanford
professors to computer-related
positions at various locations
around campus.
In addition, the network of
Stanford libraries provides
ample employment potential for
any student interested in the

University's literary resources.
One notable example is the
Department of Special Collec
tions in Green Library, which
often requires assistance in
order to categorize newly
arrived bodies of work.
Linda Long, a public services
assistant for the Department of
Special Collections, noted that
students can help tremendously
with the processing of new col
lections.
"In the past, students have
helped us put (new collections)
into acid-free folders . . . and
have organized collections by
typing up guides," she said.
And, to make Stanford
employment even more attrac
tive, the recommended mini
mum wage for on-campus jobs
this year has risen by 3 percent
to $7.59.

On-campus jobs range from helping out at the beginning-of-the-quarter bookstore rush to performing
lab research. Students can find job listings in the student employment file on Folio.
