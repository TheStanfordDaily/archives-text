# Where to buy things you forgot at home
## 
### John Hall Staff Writer 
An empty dorm room, a little
cash, and really ugly walls that you
desperately want to cover up....
The opportunity for self-expres
sion approaches galactic propor
tions.
If you tend toward the minimal
ist approach, forget it. Cinder block
walls and strange stains demand
quantity in interior decor, at least
until you can draw into one of the
Manzanita dorms.
Good taste is apparently option
al. Good shopping, however, is not.
Here's a quick tour of the most
brilliant bargain places to hit in the

Palo Alto area, for everything from
Stanford sweatshirts to posters to
U-locks.
Even without a car, you've got a
few good starting places. The cen
trally located, but sometimes
expensive Stanford Bookstore in
White Plaza carries every conceiv
able piece of Stanford-logoed para
phernalia: the obligatory sweat
shirts and other clothing, mugs,
pens, rocking chairs, board games,
and postcards. You can also pick up
stationery, school supplies and
appointment books.
Microdisc, located on the lower
level of the Bookstore has dis
discounts on computers, printers,
and software for registered Stanford
students.
During several weeks of the year,
wall posters of every size and subject
are available from vendors in front of
the Bookstore or in front of Tresidder
Union. Upstairs in Tresidder, the
new Cardinal Collection (formerly
the ASSU Shirt Shak) offers low-cost
student-produced T-shirts and other
clothing. Tresidder Express, down
stairs, can provide groceries, aspirin,
magazines, and other small items,
though at rather steep prices. But
hey, they're open untill midnight and
are ridiculously close to your dorm.
As an alternative to the Book
store, the obscure but often inexpen

sive Central Stores, located at 330
Bonair Siding off Campus Drive,
offers good values on stationery,
computers, boxes, and much sought
after engineering supplies. A Stan
ford ID may be required.
Safeway, just north of Stanford
at 525 El Camino Real, is a standard
suburban grocery store with all the
standard stuff. More importantly,
it's open 24 hours and has a good
selection of ice cream. The distance
is easily bikeable if you can't find a
car.
Just next door to Safeway is Pay-
Less Drug, at 625 El Camino. Pay-
Less carries some writing supplies,
birthday cards, and lots of soap, hair
spray, rubbing alcohol, cotton balls
and papaya-mango-seaweed extract
shampoo. They're open until 9 p.m.
on weekends and 10 p.m. on
wee knights.

The premier destination within
the still-feel-comfortable-driving-a
borrowed-car radius is the inex
orable Target (tar-ZHAY to the
sophisticated), located at 2485 El
Camino in Redwood City. To get
there, go out Palm Drive, hang a left
onto El Camino, and just keep going.
This low-budget consumer's Eden
can do a lot to chop away at your "to
get" list, offering toiletries, bath
towels, potted plants, clock-radios,
lamps, CDs, clothes, U-locks and
snack food. Selection is less compre
hensive than at specialty stores, and
brand-name products are less com
mon. Still, take a look.
Final hint: the Stanford Shopping
Center was not exactly designed for
the cash-strapped student. Look
around and decide what you like.
Then drop not-too-subtle hints when
Mom and Dad come to visit.
