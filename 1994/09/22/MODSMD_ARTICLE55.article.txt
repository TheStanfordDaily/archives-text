# Shake off summer with a busy fall
## 
### Frank Guinan Staff writer 
Now was that a long summer or
what?
If you are like most freshmen
arriving on campus, you probably
were one of the last people from
your high school to head off to col
lege. And the first half of Septem
ber was probably the most boring
time of your life.
Well, don't worry. Stanford's
schedule is really not all that
unusual. If you are from Califor
nia, you already know that the UC
system (except for those Weenies
at Berkeley) are on quarters, just
like us folks here. On the other
hand, the schools on the East
Coast — those ones with all the ivy
— are notorious for using the
semester system.
Believe it or not, there are

advantages to using the quarter
system instead of semesters —
we're not just trying to be differ
ent. First and foremost, quarters
allow you to take more classes and
experiment with different sub
jects. In addition, one quarter is
only ten weeks long, so before you
know it finals are here, and then
you're on vacation.
Now that you're thoroughly
convinced that quarters are for
your own good, there are a sever
al dates you must remember. The
first — and probably most crucial
— is Sept. 27, the last day you
can pay your tuition bill and Uni
versity fee 3 without being
charged extra money for being
forgetful.
Once you've paid that nasty bill
and are completely broke, you are
ready to begin classes, which start
the following day on Sept. 28.

After several late nights, you soon
will recognize the value of sleep,
and your body will begin to either
adjust or punish you for its lack of
needed sleep.
Living on caffeine and five
hours of sleep a night can make
one rather unmindful, but be sure
to mark Oct. 9, on your calendar.
That day is the last day to file your
study list, or else you will be
charged extra money for your
lapse. At this point, you have one
more week to declare or drop the
P/NC (pass/no credit, or more
affectionately called pass/no clue)
option for your classes.
Although Oct. 30, is not on the
time schedule, it is a rather impor
tant date because for the only time
this quarter, you will be given
some time to catch up on your
sleep. Be sure to enjoy those extra
60 minutes as the rest of the

nation falls back one hour and
reverts back to standard time.
The last day to add courses or
units to your schedule is Nov. 18,
but at this point, most students
are thinking more about dropping
courses rather than adding them.
And just when you thought that
working one more day will drive
you insane, around comes
Thanksgiving break. The four
days off that come with the holi
day should allow for some rejuve
nation — not to mention some
relaxation.
Dead week — a popular mis
nomer — happens from Dec. 4 to
Dec. 11. Supposedly, these eight
days allow students some time to
catch up, review and prepare for
final exams (Dec. 12 to 16). But
don't be fooled — classes go on as
usual, and many students com
plain that professors tend to
cram last-minute material into
this already stress-filled week.
The last day to drop classes is
Dec. 11, but don't get too used
to the idea of waiting till the
last second to drop that annoy
ing foreign language course.
Starting next year, the drop
deadline will be at the end of
the fourth week. The new grad
ing policy — passed last June —
states that if a student drops a
class after the fourth week a
"W" will appear on his or her
transcript denoting an early
exit.

After final exams come and
go, you will realize that you
have actually made it — the
first quarter of your college
career is finally over. Congratu
lations. Take three weeks off
and try not to worry about
those pesky first quarter grades
(you'll be able to check those on
Axess when you get back on
campus in January). Tell your
parents everything you did —
well okay, maybe not every
thing — and allow them to
boast about you to all their
friends.
This should give you an idea
of what's in store over the next
couple of months. If you don't
forget these important dates,
life should go rather smoothly.
So sit back, relax and enjoy your
first quarter here on the Farm.
