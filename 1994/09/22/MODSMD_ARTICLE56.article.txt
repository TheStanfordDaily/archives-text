Calculus, biology, English
— they're all traditional core
subjects. Many of us took them
in high school and for some
reason, many of us think we
have to keep taking them in
college.
Not so at Stanford. If stu
dents truly desire to delve into
these subjects, they can and are
encouraged to. But for many stu
dents, Stanford provides the first
opportunity for intellectual
exploration.
Even though new students
must fulfill three quarters of
CIV, at least one quarter of
freshman English, eight other
distribution requirements, a
gender requirement and classes
for a major, they still have plen
ty of room to partake in addi
tional academic experimenta
tion.
Some of the best classes Stan
ford has to offer do not fulfill dis
tribution or major requirements,
so throw caution to the wind. Be
a true scholar. All it takes is a lit
tle daring and some willingness
to learn ... and it wouldn't hurt
to find out what some don't-miss
classes are, either.
Here are some recommenda
tions for the wild (and not-so
wild) at heart. All of the follow
ing courses are open to Stanford
freshmen:
• Elementary Economics
(Economics 1, 5 units). A John
Taylor exclusive. Students who
have taken "intro to econ" with
Prof. Taylor can attest to his
teaching expertise.
From pumpkins to cameo
appearances by Taylor's family
to a spiritual visitation by the
voice of Adam Smith, Econ 1 is
full of surprises — and an infor
mative survey of economic fun
damentals. Try to catch the class
when John Taylor takes the
stage in spring. Added bonus:
the class fulfills DR 9.
• Environmental Science

and Technology (Civil Engi
neering 170, 3 units). While its
8 a.m. time slot and seemingly
technical nature may deter
some, this course on the envi
ronment and energy resources
is not one of the largest at
Stanford without reason.
Besides the fact that it fulfills
the pesky applied sciences dis
tribution requirement (DR 6),
Prof. Gil Masters' energetic
teaching and the socially rele
vant subject matter make the
course a popular autumn quar
ter choice for fuzzies and
techies alike.
• Introduction to Psycholo
gy (Psychology 1, 4 or 5 units).
It's no secret that the profes
sors in Stanford's psychology
department are among the
world's premier researchers.
What's less well-known is that
many of them are also scintil
lating lecturers. Psych 1, aside
from providing a comprehen
sive overview of current psy
chological scholarship, also
gives students a kind of sam
pler of the faculty — Stanford
professors often give guest lec
tures on their respective spe
cialties. Psych 1 also fulfills
DR 9.
• Human Sexuality (Human
Biology 10, 3 units). "What, no
lab?" is a question often asked
by students who take Human
Sexuality with Prof. Herant
Katchadourian, usually offered
winter quarter.
While "Hum Sex" is not a
hands-on experience in the most
literal sense of the word, the
many students who flock to the
class every year learn about
everything from pheromones to
sexual dysfunction. But subject
matter aside, most students
attribute this class's popularity
to Katchadourian's lively teach
ing style.
• Sleep and Dreams (Human
Biology 11, 3 units). True to its
title, this winter quarter course
is dedicated to the study of sleep
— right down to the sleep of the
students who take the course.
Dr. William Dement is consid
ered the leader in the field of
sleep research, and lectures

about such topics as REM sleep
are filled with anecdotes about
when he or his colleagues dis
covered that particular phe
nomenon.
The overriding message of
the class, however, is one your
mother taught you — get
enough sleep. This idea is so
strongly enforced that Dr.
Dement designates one side of
the auditorium as "the sleeping
section," devoted to students
who are too tired to stay awake

in class.
• Major Issues of American
Public Policy (Political Science
1, 5 units). This course, a classic
introduction to the Held of polit
ical science, teaches students
about democratic voting pro
cesses, and is therefore especial
ly interesting in an election
year. Prof. David Brady is an
engaging lecturer, presenting
concepts in a straightforward,
coherent manner without any
gimmicks, and students gener

ally finish the class with a clear
understanding of how policy is
made.
The autumn quarter class is
also an interesting way to satis
fy DR 9.
• Status, Friendship, and
Social Pressure: An Experi
mental Approach (Sociology 5,
4 or 5 units). The ideal course
for students seeking an aca
demic adventure unlike any
thing they have experienced in
high school. Prof. Joseph Berg

er, an enduring pioneer in his
field, introduces students to
many of the same experiments
that have influenced present
day theories concerning group
interaction and romantic rela
tionships.
If you've ever wanted to
understand why an ex-lover
acted the way he/she did, then
this is the course for you. Dou
ble whammy: the class fulfills
DR 9 and the gender require
ment. Offered in winter.
