For the first time in at least
30 years, females no longer
make up a minority of the
freshman class. According to
figures released by the Under
graduate Admissions Office,
this fall there will be 1.02
women for every man in the
class of 1998.
For the past several years,
the gender composition of
incoming classes have hovered
at about 50 percent men and 50
percent women, Assoc. Dean of
Undergraduate Admissions
John Bunnell said.
Of the 1,589 students
entering Stanford as fresh
men this fall, 802 (or 50.5 per
cent) are women, while 787
(or 49.5 percent) are men.
In terms of geographic
diversity, members of the
incoming class represent all
but one of the 50 states. West
Virginia is the only state not
sending a freshman to Stan
ford, whereas California
remains the leader in state
representation, with 45 per
cent of students coming from
the Golden State. This figure
is up 3 percent from last year.
The incoming class is also
ethnically diverse. The class of
1998 is 7 percent African-Amer
ican, 10 percent Mexican-Amer
ican, 1 percent Native American
and 27 percent Asian-American.
The 83 international stu
dents — 5 percent of the class
— are from 31 foreign coun
tries and represent nations
such as Nepal, Turkey, Bul
garia and Ethiopia.

The class is also one of the
strongest Stanford has ever
had academically, Bunnell said.
Ninety percent of freshmen
ranked in the top decile of their
high school class and 78 per
cent had a high school grade
point average of 3.8 to 4.0, up 5
percent from last year's figure.
Freshmen SAT scores were
also impressive, with 26 per
cent of freshmen scoring
between 700 and 800 on the
verbal section and 62 percent
scoring between 700 and 800
on the math section.
The 153 transfer students
enrolling at Stanford this fall
are also a varied, talented
bunch.
In this group, males make
up 55.6 percent of the
enrollees while females make
up the remaining 44.4 per
cent. The transfer students
represent 96 different col
leges, 24 percent of which are
community colleges.
Transfers come from 31 dif
ferent states, but 49 percent of
all transfers come from Cali
fornia. Of the 153 enrolling
students, 12 are international
students representing 11 for
eign countries including Italy
and Argentina.
This ethnically-diverse group
is made up of 8 percent African-
Americans, 6 percent Mexican-
Americans, 1 percent Native
Americans, and 22 percent
Asian-Americans.
In terms of academic
achievement, transfers are the
cream of the crop. Of the enter
ing transfers, 77 percent had a
college GPA of 3.6 to 4.0 and 60
percent had a combined SAT of
over 1300.
