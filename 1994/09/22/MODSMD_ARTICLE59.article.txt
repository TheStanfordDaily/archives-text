# Sobering tips on campus drinking
## 
### Shirley Park Staff writer 
Dorm parties, pre-football tail
gating, long weekends at Tahoe ...
all "staple" experiences that can
make students' first year at Stan
ford their most memorable. At the
same time, these activities can
often turn the heads of new Stan
ford students unaccustomed to eas
ily accessible drugs and alcohol.
Realizing that intoxicants and
illegal substances are sure to be
abundantly available, various cam
pus organizations — like the
Department of Public Safety and
the Office of Residential Education
— are busy informing incoming
students of the University's drug
and alcohol policy in the hopes
that they will make educated deci
sions.
Instead of focusing on campus
wide campaigns, Res Ed hopes to
lay the seeds of alcohol and drug
education at the dorm community
level, said Ann Porteus, acting co
director of Res Ed. Freshmen can
expect to hear their residence advi
sors and resident fellows mention
Stanford's alcohol and drug policy,
she added.
Mirroring California state law,
the policy states that "the unlawful
manufacture, distribution, dispen
sation, possession, and/or use of
controlled substances or the
unlawful possession, use, or distri
bution of alcohol is prohibited on
the Stanford campus," according to
the Department of Public Safety.
Violators of this policy could face
disciplinary sanctions as severe as
expulsion from the University, as
well as the usual prosecution pro
cess by authorities.

Porteus said that the residence
staff will act primarily as educators
and advisors to students. "[Res Edl
doesn't tell [residence staff] that
they're supposed to be police," she
said.
At Stanford Stadium, students
are not allowed to bring alcohol into
football games. Agents from the
state's Alcohol Beverage Control
will be patrolling games this fall to
enforce the stadium's policy.
These plain-clothed agents also
will be targeting tailgate parties
and checking for identification,
according to Stanford Police Capt.
Raoul Niemeyer.
"Hopefully they will try to keep
the lids on alcohol," he said.
Niemeyer said that while under
age drinking on campus "has been a
problem from time to time... drug
arrests are very marginal compared
to alcohol problems."
From 1990 through July of this
year, there have been 44 drug-relat
ed arrests as opposed to 113 arrests
for liquor law violations.
Freshmen receive more alcohol
and drug information through Ori
entation programs like "Sex in the
'905." While "Sex in the '90s" is not
strictly about alcohol and drugs,
the subject matter inherently
includes these concerns, Porteus
explained.
Cowell Student Health Center
— located at 606 Campus Drive —
is another resource for students
seeking alcohol and drug informa
tion. The center contains a resource
library, holds workshops and
makes referrals. Cowell is open 8:30
a.m. to 8 p.m. on weekdays and 10
a.m. to 2 p.m. on weekends. Doctors
are on call, however, 24 hours a
day.
