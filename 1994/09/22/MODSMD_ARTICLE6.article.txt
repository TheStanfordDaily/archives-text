# New challenge for Larimore
## 
### Michael Slemmer Editorial staff 
■
After nine years as director
of the American Indian Pro
gram Office, Jim is
retiring from the job and going
back to school to get his doctor
ate, but he's not leaving Stan
ford's ethnic centers behind —
not just yet.
Larimore will occupy a one
year position as assistant to the
provost, helping the ethnic cen
ters implement the strategic plans
they drafted last year. At the same
time, he said, his "plans for the
next year are to do some research
in the School of Education on
organizations."
Previously, Larimore had
announced that he was leaving his
position as director of AIPO to
devote himself full-time to his doc
toral program in the School of
Education.
"I felt like this position would
be a good opportunity for me," he
said, adding that he expects time
management to be one of his
greatest challenges.
Although he has managed to
stay on for an extra year, I>arimore
admitted that, out of necessity, his
direct involvement in the Univer

sity administration will end after
next year. "Sooner or later I'm
going to have to become a serious
student," he said.
With such a strict deadline,
Larimore said he plans to make the
most out of the upcoming year.
"I'm excited about working with a
group that I really respect while at
the same time working toward a
Ph.D. in higher education," he
said.
His plans for the ethnic centers
include working on minority grad
uate and undergraduate student
retention, programs within the
communities themselves and bet
ter communication among the eth
nic groups.
"Right now, the ideas are
rather general. ... We still need to
come up with specific plans," Lari
more said. "I'd like to get commu
nity leaders together to discuss
ideas that are working."
Out of such meetings, he said

the communities will be able to
make decisions about how they
want to proceed. "At this point, it's
not clear if we need a standardized

1 think [the money] is
terrific news. Folks in
the centers invested a
tremendous amount
of time putting togeth
er strategic plans.'

approach to the centers' needs or
more individualized approaches,"
he said. "I think well-directed dis
cussions could set us on the road
toward greatly improving the cen
ters."

From his position in the admin
istration this year, Larimore will
also have the opportunity to help
direct the $200,000 in funds the
University recently promised the
centers.
"I think [the money] is terrific
news," he said. "Folks in the cen
ters invested a tremendous
amount of time putting together
strategic plans. .. . This money
will ensure that some of those
ideas become reality."
Larimore also plans to take
first-year graduate classes in the
School of Education. "After next
year, I'd like to get into some inter
esting research of my own," he
said.
But for now, he is just excited to
do both at the same time. "I get to
take classes while at the same time
working with people in student
affairs who are really doing excep
tional things," he said. "For me,
it's the best of both worlds."
