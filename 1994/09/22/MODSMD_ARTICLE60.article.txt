# Campus sites provide perfect terrain for exercise buffs
## With a little creativity, students and exercise go hand in hand

Having feasted on your first couple of
delectable Food Service meals you may
wonder how anyone could gain weight at
college. But statistics say many students
are prone to gaining the "Freshman 15."
Fear not, young Cardinal, for The
Farm offers plenty — from foot trails to
free weights — to keep you fit.

A good pair of running shoes is all
that's required for a quick jog or walk
around campus, to Palo Alto or up in the
Foothills behind campus. The Campus
Drive loop is approximately four miles
and is a good way to familiarize yourself
with Stanford's layout. The "faculty
ghetto" in the streets branching off May
field Avenue offers quiet roads and pleas
ant residential views.
Beyond the "ghetto" to the southwest

lie the Foothills, a favorite destination for
runners and walkers alike. You may
enter the fenced area at three points
along Junipero Serra Boulevard: near the
intersection of Campus Drive East, at the
intersection of Stanford Avenue or up a
driveway near the intersection of French
man's Road.
The main paved loop is slightly more
than three miles but there are plenty of
dirt paths there as well if you wish to
lengthen or shorten your trip. The Dish
(Stanford's large satellite dish) and the
Stanford Solar Observatory are located in
the area, and the hills are home to a vari
ety of wildlife including jackrabbits,
squirrels, moles, snakes, skunks, foxes,
birds and the occasional tarantula.
Stanford's golf course — at the inter
section of Campus Drive West and
Junipero Serra — is excellent not only for
golfing but also for jogging. Its lush
rolling hills provide respite from the hus
tle and bustle of central campus. Mon
days (when the course is closed to golfers)
are particularly enjoyable, since you
don't have to dodge golf balls, golf carts
and golfers who have gone astray — but
watch out for the sprinklers.
Lake Lagunita — or Lakebed Laguni
ta, depending on the season — is another
good place for a stroll. The circumference
is about nine-tenths of a mile, and the
area is particularly enjoyable in spring
when the lake is full.
If biking is more your speed, take a
ride around Palo Alto for starters. For
ideas on longer rides, a guide to local bike
paths and rides is available at the Book
store, or you can contact the Stanford
Cycling Club for ideas. Oh, and don't for
get your helmet.
For those who like to cruise on more
than two wheels the campus has some
idyllic rollerblading venues. For smooth
cruising, check out the pavement in front
of the Physics Tank on the west side of
campus, or try the Quad's sandstone
walkways (but beware of pedestrians).
Avoid the area around the Clock Tower.
In-line skates can be rented for about
$10 at a number of local stores such as
Palo Alto Sport Shop and Toy World. For
a couple extra bucks, you can protect
yourself with helmets, knee pads and
wrist guards. But be warned: skating is
frowned upon by campus police.
If you prefer indoor exercise (and you
will, come January), Stanford offers sev
eral facilities to non-varsity athletes.
There's the relatively new Arrillaga Fam
ily Sports Center next to Maples Pavilion,
equipped with a huge weight room and
basketball courts.
You also can use the free weights,
weight machines and exercise bicycles at
Roble Gym. Stairmasters and Lifecycles
are located in the Ford Center. Volleyball
and basketball may be played in the adja
cent Burnham Pavilion.
Racquetball, handball and squash
courts and outdoor swimming facilities
are located in the deGuerre complex
between the Tennis Stadium and Sunken
Diamond on the northeast side of campus.
Roble Pool is also open fall quarter. Ten
nis courts can be found at the corner of

Intramural and club sports, in addi
tion to regular Athletics Department
activities, are a way to build physical fit
ness into your life. Classes and intramu
ral sports vary by quarter, and sign-ups

are usually held the day before classes
begin each quarter.
If you've never seriously exercised
before, or would like to develop a struc
tured exercise program, contact a physi
cian at Cowell Student Health Center for
advice. Cowell's nutritionist is also avail
able by appointment.
