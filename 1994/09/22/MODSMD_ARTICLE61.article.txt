Kelly Naylor
Considered one of the best goalkeepers in the nation, this freshman
out of Columbia, Md. has already turned heads in her first six ap
pearances. Against Wake Forest on Sept. 8, Naylor kept the Deacons
from scoring through the first 47 minutes of the game. Although the
Deacon onslaught was relentless with 40 shots on goal, Naylor let just
two slip by, finishing the contest with 25 saves. Naylor displayed sim
ilar expertise against No. 1 North Carolina, when she stifled the Tar
Heels for 20 minutes. Before coming to Stanford, Naylor's rare skill
helped her climb deftly through the field hockey camp process; she
has already reached the B-Camp, the level just before players are se
lected to the U.S. Team.
