## Football smashes Spartans, looks to trap Wildcats 51-20 victory raises hopes after tie 
### Greg Collins Staff writer 
Going into last Saturday's
game against San Jose State,
head coach Bill Walsh noted that
he wanted to establish the Cardi
nal's questionable running game
before resorting to the polished
air attack of Stenstrom and com
pany.
And he did, by rushing the
ball 15 straight plays before
attempting a pass. By that time,
the game was already into the
second quarter and the Cardinal
led the Spartans 14-7 en route to
a 51-20 massacre.
"We wanted to run the ball,
which was very obvious," said
Walsh. "We decided to . . .
improve our running game.
We've tried over the past two
weeks to bring it as far along as
we could before we get into the
real meat of our schedule."

Against San Jose State, Stan
ford ran around, over and
through the Spartans, amassing
314 rushing yards. Sophomore
Mike Mitchell led the Cardinal
with 21 carries for 179 yards and
three touchdowns, his second
straight 100-yard game. He was
named Pacific 10 Conference
offensive player of the week for
his efforts.
Through having only played
two games this year, Stanford
has already amassed last year's
total rushing touchdowns of
nine.
"It seems like our running
game has finally arrived," senior
wide receiver Justin Armour
said. "Now that we can put that
together with the passing attack
we have, I'm excited to see where
we can go this year."
Along with the new-found
running game, the Cardinal
defense started to show glimpses

of playing a complete game. Led
by junior defensive end Pete
Swanson, Stanford held San
Jose State to 25 yards on the
ground on 32 carries. Swanson
recorded four of the Cardinal's
seven sacks and forced a fumble,
grabbing Pac-10 defensive player
of the week honors.
"Every aspect of the line play
was good," Swanson said. "I
didn't feel they (San Jose State's
offensive line) were as strong as
us or as quick as us."
The defense's effort was addi
tionally surprising in that four
new faces dotted the starting
lineup. Swanson, sophomore
Scott Frost, freshmen Kailee
Wong and Chris Draft all started
for the first time this year.
Frost, the team's back-up
quarterback, got the nod at free
safety and responded with four
tackles and an interception.
Then, in the second half, he
relieved Steve Stenstrom at
quarterback, becoming the first
Stanford player to play both
quarterback and play on defense
in the same game since Jack
Douglas in 1957.
It was an unusual day for
Steve Stenstrom, the senior Ail-
American candidate. Throwing
only 18 times, he completed 14
for 231 yards and three touch
downs. However, the low num
ber of pass attempts didn't both
er him.
"That kind of situation would
probably get frustrating had our
last year and a half not gone the
way it had, where we were so
unsuccessful running the ball,"
Stenstrom said. "We just needed
to be able to run the ball at will,
do what we wanted to on the
ground, and I didn't care if I
threw a pass the whole game."

51-yard drive culminating in an
