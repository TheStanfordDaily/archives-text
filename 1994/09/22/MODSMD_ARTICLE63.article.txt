# Offense ready to face biggest test
## 
### Greg Collins Staff writer 
If Stanford needs any test to determine its offen
sive proficiency, this weekend's showdown with
No. 8 Arizona should do the trick.
The Wildcats (2-0) have assembled one of the
most feared defenses in recent memory, in which
they smother the run and then dare their oppo
nents to pass against a relentless pass rush. Despite
averaging 557.5 yards in total offense this season,
the Cardinal (1-0-1), have yet to prove its offensive
mettle against a top program this year.
"We have not been tested like Arizona has," said

head coach Bill Walsh, referring to the Wildcats'
first game of the season, a 19-14 win over Georgia
Tech. "This game is about as big a game as Stan
ford will have."
However, over the first two games of this season,
Arizona has not looked like a team some preseason
publications picked as the top in the country. They
have only recorded five sacks and forced one
turnover.
"We've played poorly in the first two games this
year," said Wildcat head coach Dick Tomey. "But
now we've cleaned up our discipline and improved
our running game."
While Arizona may not have
put the same amount of pressure
on opposing quarterbacks this
year as last, the defense is still the
stingiest in the conference, giving
up an average of 222.5 yards and
seven points per game.
"It is essential to get rid of the
ball quickly," senior quarterback
Steve Stenstrom said. "We will
need to establish the running
game and have a balanced
attack."
The Cardinal may have more
success against the Arizona
defense than in the past because
it has adopted similar formations
as the Wildcats. However, while

Arizona uses their "flex" defen
sive formation the entire game,
Stanford uses a variety of sets.
Anchoring the Wildcat defense
is defensive end Tedi Bruschi and
safeties Tony Bouie and Brandon
Sanders. Bruschi, last year's Pac
-10 sack leader with 18, has 26.5
career sacks in 27 games. Bouie
and Sanders provide Arizona with
one of the most physical safety
combinations in the country.
Last year, Stanford came
within a last-second fumble of
tying the Wildcats. With the Car
dinal backed up on its own 15-
yard line, a breakdown in commu
nication between Walsh and
Stenstrom had the quarterback
dropping back in the pocket to
throw rather than just sitting on
the ball to run out the clock. A hit
by Arizona defensive end Akil
Jackson popped the ball out of

Stenstrom's grasp and the Wild
cats recovered. A 27-yard field
goal by Steve McLaughlin as time
expired gave Arizona a 27-24 vic
tory.
"I look back at that game with
just one sinking feeling, and
that's my call on the last play,"
Walsh said. "That loss last year
was a gross mistake on my part."
Stanford's 342 yards of total
offense were the most given up by
the Wildcats last year, but 339 of
them were from Stenstrom's arm.
This year, the Cardinal hopes to
be able to pick up more on the
ground and not have to rely on
Stenstrom's ability to throw the
ball.
"We will run if we ever have
the lead, which may never hap
pen," Walsh said. "This will be an
aerial circus on the part of Stan
ford, you can count on that."
