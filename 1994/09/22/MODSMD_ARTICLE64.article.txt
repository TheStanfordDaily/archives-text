For coach Dante Dettamanti
and the Stanford men's water
polo team, the opening weeks of
the 1994 season may bring about
a sense of deja vu. The rest of the
NCAA is sensing it too, and it isn't
a comfortable feeling.
The Cardinal returns to the
waters this season as the defend
ing national champion, after
downing USC in last year's NCAA
championship game and finishing
with a 24-6 record. After claiming
the national crown, Dettamanti
lost the services of six seniors,
including four starters. But the
coach, entering his 18th year at
the helm of Stanford's squad,
filled the holes left by graduation
with a recruiting class touted as
the nation's best.
Although All-Americans Larry
Bercutt, Chris Wallin and Antonio
Busquets have moved on, Stan
ford returns an experienced
bunch of players. The team's lead
ership will fall mainly on the
broad shoulders of senior hole
man Frank Schneider and senior
driver Wolf Wigo.
While their roles in the water
are slightely different this season,
both of the four-year starters are
loooking forward to meeting the
challenges.
"I'm very excited because Wolf
and I are now seniors," Schneider
said. "But aside from being the
defending national champions, all
of a sudden we're the leaders of
the team. We can't just sit back
and watch others lead."
Wigo, who could become only
the seventh Cardinal water polo
player to be a four-year All-Amer
ican, is also aware of the fact that
the competition will be looking to
down Stanford.
"Every game will be very
intense, especially the away
games," Wigo said. "Everyone will
be more excited to play us, teams
will be more pumped up."
When comparing this year's
Cardinal squad with those of
recent years, Wigo points out the
sheer talent assembled in the
water. "This year is the first time

that I think wo have the most tal
ented team in the country, physi
cally," he said. "We will have to
execute, work hard and play well to
win. In past years, we needed our
best game to beat the top teams.
We are strong at every major posi
tion, with no gaping hole."
One position which will feature
a new face this year is the goal.
With three-time All-American
Bercutt gone, the defense will be
anchored by junior Jack Bowen,
who is more than ready to put his
skills on display.
"I've been waiting a long time
for this year," said Bowen who

red-shirted during his freshman
year. Bowen was also side-lined
for a year after hyper-extending
an elbow in 1991. "Since I came to
Stanford, I've basically been
working out for this year."
Returning to the starting line
up along with Schneider and Wigo
will be All-Ainerican junior Jere
my Laster. Juniors Josh Leach
man, Dan Hancock and Brian
Pyle, along with sophomores Dan
Lehoczky and Brian Wallin will be
expected to log plenty of minutes
while contributing to the offen
sive attack.
So far, the 1994 season has

born an uncanny resemblance to
last year's campaign. After hold
ing the No. 1 ranking from start
to finish a year ago, the Cardinal
again is the pre-season No. 1 pick.
Stanford is followed in the polls by
1993 runner-up USC and peren
nial power California.
The repeat victory at the
Southern California tournament
two weeks ago also raised memo
ries of 1993, as Stanford once
again defeated USC in the tourna
ment final. Unlike last year, how
ever, the Cardinal emerged from
the tournament with an unblem
ished record intact.
