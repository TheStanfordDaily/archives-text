# Goal in sight
## Women aim for Final-Four 
### Jeremy Stone Staff writer 
After its best season ever
last year, the 1994 Stanford
women's soccer team, ranked
fourth in the country, is poised
to dethrone the North Carolina
juggernaut, winner of eight
consecutive national champi
onships.
Unlike the previous cam
paign, most of the Cardinal
faces this year are familiar
ones. Lan Sawyers begins his
second year of coaching Stan
ford without the interim label
he carried in 1993, when the
former assistant replaced the
departed Bernie Andeberhan.
Cardinal career points record
holder Sarah Rafanelli also
returns, though not with her
familiar No. 9. The 1994 grad
uate is Sawyer's new assistant.
Veterans fill 18 of the 24
roster positions, with Rafanelli
the lone major piece missing
from last year's puzzle. That
team reached the NCAA Final
Four for the first time, finished
18-2-2, and climbed to No. 2 in
the final national polls. The
players remember well their
bitter semi-final loss on penal
ty kicks to George Mason on a
rain-soaked November after
noon in Chapel Hill, N.C., last
season.
"Last year left a bittersweet
taste in our mouths," said
Sawyer. "Losing the way we
did, a lot of our players feel
they caine up a little empty. I
think they got a taste of what
success is and now they want a
bigger bite."
Another year of experience,
coupled with the graduation of
Tar Heel superstar Mia Hamm,
gives the Cardinal a chance to
top last year's success. Indeed,
even without Rafanelli, Stan
ford retains the effective bal
ance it possessed in 1993.
Four players who tallied six
goals or more return from a
potent offense which scored 68
goals in 22 games, an average

of 3.1 goals per game. Among
them is sophomore forward
Erin Martin, who rewrote the
freshman record book in 1993
with 14 goals and 11 assists.
She is joined by consensus pre
season All-American junior
sweeper Jessica Fischer (eight
goals), senior forward Andrea
Johnson (six goals), and junior
midfielder Carmel Murphy
(nine goals). Murphy will lead a
talented midfield that keys the
Cardinal ball-possession style
of play.
Defensively, senior Melinda
Minstrell and sophomore Suzie
Boots return to join Fischer.
Last year, the trio helped goal
keeper Leslie Garrard allow a
mere eight goals and post 17
shutouts.
Thus far in the season,
Stanford has translated this
strength on paper to success on
the field.
The Cardinal opened its
championship campaign with a
2-1 victory over San Diego
State on Sept. 5 at Maloney
Field. Junior Dena Dey
returned to work on Labor Day
with a goal assisted by Martin.
Freshman Rita Hermiz provid
ed the game-winner, notching
the first score of her collegiate
career. In all, Stanford man
aged 10 shots on goal and
allowed six.
From there, the Cardinal
went on to capture the Hart
ford Courant Cup, which took
place Sept. 10-11 in Hartford,
Conn.
Stanford met 15th-ranked
Hartford to open the tourna
ment. After 67 minutes of flaw
less defense by both sides, Mar
tin fired from 17 yards away
and hit the crossbar. Murphy
followed the miss for the
game's only score.
"Carmel is always around
the ball," Sawyer said. "She is a
hungry player who isn't fearful
of losing position on the field."
