# Spikers lead the nation
## New talent, experience on the court 
### Seth Goldstein Staff writer 
Pick up any volleyball publica
tion in the country and it will list
Stanford women's volleyball as
No. 1. In fact, the odds of Stan
ford winning seem as certain as
Goliath's victory over David.
But, as history has shown,
Goliath was not indestructible.
"We may be the number one
pick on paper, but we've still got
to prove it on the court," warns
Cardinal head coach Don Shaw.
This proof, if it is to be deliv
ered, will come off the arms and
hands of what Shaw referred to as
one of the most talented squads
ever to walk into Maples Pavilion.
This is no small compliment —
Stanford women's volleyball
reached the NCAA Final Four in
five of the last 10 years, including
1992's National Championship
campaign.
The Cardinal boasts nine
returning players, including five
of last year's starters. In addition,
Stanford features four outstand
ing freshmen who form what
many volleyball publications
called one of the best recruiting
classes any school has ever had.
"We were good without the
freshmen and with them we're
even better," said Shaw. "We
could conceivably win it all with
just the returning players, but the
freshmen make us the clear
favorite."
Kristin Folkl, the 1993-94
High School Athlete of the Year
who will also play basketball for
the Cardinal, has already "made a
definite impact." She will be
starting along with fellow fresh
man Lisa Sharpley, the No. 2
recruit in the country behind
Folkl. Barbara Ifejika and Debbie
Lambert round out the team's
fearsome freshmen foursome.
While the talented youngsters

have nabbed most of the press
and attention, they are by no
means Stanford's only weapons.

provide veteran leadership with
seniors Anne Wicks and Denise
Rotert and juniors Marnie
Triefenbach and Wendy Hromad
ka. All in all, Stanford will carry
15 players.
"We don't usually carry this
many," said Shaw, "but there's
that much talent. Our depth is
our greatest strength. We can go
five or six deep without losing a
step."
This depth enabled Shaw to
experiment with numerous
line-ups during the team's first
two weeks of play. At times,
three of the four freshmen
found themselves starting at
the same time. It may have
seemed like a game of musical
chairs to the Cardinal's adver
saries, but it served a valuable
purpose for Stanford.
"We were able to get a real
good look at everyone," said
Shaw. "We could see what our
strengths and weaknesses are,
what sort of combinations will
work. This learning period will
help us to solidify the line-up a
bit over the next few weeks and
use our bench strength to wear
opponents down."
Shaw hopes this season proves
more successful than last year's
campaign when the Cardinal
went 22-7 and was knocked out
in the Sweet Sixteen of the
NCAA Tournament by Pacific-10
Conference champion UCLA.
While the 1993 season was still
impressive, it came as somewhat
of a let down after the previous

year's national championship.
"It was a down year, but we
got what we deserved," said
Shaw. "We played about as well
as we could. This year, we have
the talent to improve upon that."
The Cardinal put this talent to
the test at its season opener on
Sept. 3 in the Sun Bank Invita
tional at the University of Flori
da. After rolling over both North
Carolina (15-4, 15-7, 15-10) and
Michigan (15-9, 15-3, 15-9),
Stanford faced its first test of the
year against the tournament
host, then seventh-ranked Flori
da.
The Gators, currently ranked
fifth, came into the match with a
58-match home winning streak
and an unblemished record thus
far in the season. They put up a
good fight, taking the third game
15-10 — the Cardinal's lone lost
game this year — before finally
succumbing to Stanford in four
games (15-12, 15-10, 10-15, 15-
8). When it was all over, Wendell,
Folkl and Sharpley were named
to the all-tournament team, and
the Cardinal had won its first
tournament championship this
season.
But Stanford wasn't finished
yet. After a quick stop in Pitts
burgh for a straight-game win
over the Panthers where Wen
dell had a team season-high 29
assists, the Cardinal moved on to
Urbana-Champaign, 111., to par
ticipate in the Illini/Pepsi Clas
sic.
Wicks, Sharpley and Wendell
led the way in a first round win
over Georgia Tech (15-6, 15-10,
15-12), handing the Yellow Jack
ets their first loss in eight out
ings. The Stanford attack out-hit

Tech .325 to .182.
The Cardinal then had to deal
with No. 18 New Mexico. The
Lobos had handled No. 21 Illinois
the night before to bolster their
record to 4-0, not having lost a
game yet this season. They came
out strong to take a 13-7 lead in
the first game against Stanford,
but redshirt freshman Paula
McNamee came off the bench to
put the breaks on upstart New
Mexico. Then Triefenbach was
handed the ball and her powerful
jump serve led the way to eight
straight Cardinal points and the
game.
The Lobos were not ready to
lie down yet, however. They
jumped out to an 8-1 lead in game
two, before substitutes McNamee
and Hromadka came in to pump
the team into a 13-0 run. New
Mexico was finally deflated and
the Cardinal took the third game
15-3. Wendell's performance at
Illinois, combined with the show
she put on in Pittsburgh, was
enough to win her Pac-10 Player
of the Week honors.
Capturing the Illini/Pepsi clas
sic ran Stanford's record to a per
fect 6-0, leaving them as the only
undefeated team in the Pac-10
after two weeks. However, as the
conference schedule begins, its
unblemished record doesn't
make the Cardinal feel any safer.
Indeed, Goliath has a long way to
go, and some of those Davids are
liable to be as deadly as their Bib
lical counterpart.
"The Pac-10 is to women's vol
leyball what the Atlantic Coast
Conference is to men's basket
ball," Shaw said. "It's extremely
competitive and anything can
happen."
