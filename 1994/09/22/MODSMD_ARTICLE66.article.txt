# Spikers lead the nation
## New talent, experience on the court

Pick up any volleyball publica
tion in the country and it will list
Stanford women's volleyball as
No. 1. In fact, the odds of Stan
ford winning seem as certain as
Goliath's victory over David.
But, as history has shown,
Goliath was not indestructible.
"We may be the number one
pick on paper, but we've still got
to prove it on the court," warns
Cardinal head coach Don Shaw.
This proof, if it is to be deliv
ered, will come off the arms and
hands of what Shaw referred to as
one of the most talented squads
ever to walk into Maples Pavilion.
This is no small compliment —
Stanford women's volleyball
reached the NCAA Final Four in
five of the last 10 years, including
1992's National Championship
campaign.
The Cardinal boasts nine
returning players, including five
of last year's starters. In addition,
Stanford features four outstand
ing freshmen who form what
many volleyball publications
called one of the best recruiting
classes any school has ever had.
"We were good without the
freshmen and with them we're
even better," said Shaw. "We
could conceivably win it all with
just the returning players, but the
freshmen make us the clear
favorite."
Kristin Folkl, the 1993-94
High School Athlete of the Year
who will also play basketball for
the Cardinal, has already "made a
definite impact." She will be
starting along with fellow fresh
man Lisa Sharpley, the No. 2
recruit in the country behind
Folkl. Barbara Ifejika and Debbie
Lambert round out the team's
fearsome freshmen foursome.
While the talented youngsters

have nabbed most of the press
and attention, they are by no
means Stanford's only weapons.
