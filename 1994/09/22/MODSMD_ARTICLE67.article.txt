# Men's soccer jump-starts

"It was a real Jeckel and
Hyde kind of season."
This is how Stanford men's
soccer coach Colin Lindores
describes Stanford's 1993 cam
paign. Unfortunately for the
Cardinal, the 1994 season thus
far has picked up where last
year left off.
The team opened this season
with a 1-2 loss to ninth-ranked
UCLA on September 2. On the
same weekend, the Cardinal
bounced back to beat seventh
ranked California State Fuller
ton.
"I was very happy about the
way we played UCIxA; we should
have won but lost," said Lin
dores, who is in his fifth year at
Stanford. "Against Fullerton, I
thought we should have lost but
won."
The squad's performances
were erratic but punctuated by
good play, a sign of inexperience
on the very young Cardinal
squad. Stanford will face the
challenge of winning consistent
ly in tough situations despite a
scarcity of upperclassmen.
This will be a familiar task
for Lindores, as this season con
tinues the process of rebuilding
that began a year ago when the
team lost seven seniors. While
the 1994 squad will face a simi
lar situation, it hopes to learn
from the lessons of last season.
"Last season was strange,"
Lindores said. "We went
straight downhill right at the
beginning of the season, but
halfway through we went
straight up."
The Cardinal's record of 8-9-
2 last year does not reflect the
ebb and flow of the team's play,
as its record for the last seven
games was 6-1-0. Stanford rode
the momentum of its late season
play all the way to the Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation divi
sion championship match,
where it lost 1-2 to UCLA. The
Cardinal finished second in its
16-team conference.
"The new players took half a

season, but we ended up doing a
nice job towards the end of the
season," Lindores said.
This year threatens to unfold
in a similarly inconsistent man
ner. After the impressive sea
son-opener, Stanford lost two
matches the weekend of Sept. 9
to the University of Connecticut
and Southern Alabama Univer
sity, by 3-1 and 2-0 respectively.
"We had a good start against
two top-10 teams," Lindores
said, "but the two losses this
week are disappointing after our
great start."
In an effort to find the win
ning combination of this year's
squad early in the season, Lin
dores will continue to start
many players instead of settling
on a fixed squad. There are six

freshmen whom he feels will
develop and contribute during
the season, including standouts
Dan Wytock, Eric Vandevelde
and Jason Roeder.
"Given the opportunity, they
can probably help us out in the
future, " Lindores said. "It's just
too early to tell."
The consistent play of senior
Ryan Collins, a four-year starter
and the second-leading scorer
last season, will help offset the
team's relative inexperience.
Collins, who according to Lin
dores can both create goal scor
ing opportunities for himself
and other players, has totaled 24
goals and 11 assists in his last
three years. He already has

consistency in 1994.
