## Women's cross country starts 1994 season with upset of No.1 Arkansas 
### Sam Wu Editorial staff 
Stanford's little, red running
women will fear no wolves on
their way to Grandma's this fall.
In fact, it is the ninth-ranked
Cardinal women's cross country
team that will likely flash its
sharp teeth during the 1994 sea
son.
"I get to be the bully this
year," said senior Sarah Truitt.
Evidently, this year's Cardi
nal is capable of climbing heights
greater than those reached by
last season's record-setting
squad.
In 1993, Stanford secured its
first ever Pacific 10 Conference
title, ending then-No. 6 Oregon's
three-year dynasty. The Cardi
nal then went on to finish second
at the NCAA District-8 regional
championships, and ultimately
placed 11th at the NCAA Cham
pionships. Last season's appear
ance at the NCAA's was Stan
ford's first since 1984.
"We hope to finish in the top
ten at NCAA's this year," said
head coach Vin Lananna.
"How high. . .I'm not saying,"
he added with a smirk.
If last Saturday's UC-Irvine
Cross Country Invitational held
at Costa Mesa, Calif., was any
indication, the Cardinal just
might finish as the best in the
country. In the Irvine event,
Stanford's "A" team upset No. 1
Arkansas 30-39, while the Stan
ford "B" team came in fourth
with 107 points.
Six runners from the Cardinal
"A" team placed in the top ten.
Freshmen Kortney Dunscombe
and Sarna Renfro led Stanford
with third and fourth-place per
formances, respectively. They

were followed by sophomore
Amanda White, Truitt, sopho
more Monal Chokshi, sopho
more Leila Burr, and junior
Laura Hayward, who finished
sixth, eighth, ninth, 10th, and
19th, respectively.
The experience gained from a
year such as 1993, according to
Lananna, is what in part makes
this year's team so formidable. A
second factor is the depth the
Cardinal possesses, as evidenced
by the Irvine invite.
"We can interchange our top
12 runners and be just as good,"
Lananna said. "I wouldn't be
able to name the top seven run
ners right now."
In fact, Lananna feels 14-16
runners have a legitimate
chance to represent Stanford at
a top-seven position. Although
Ail-American Louise Watson
graduated, the remainder of the
1993 team returns in hopes of
out-performing themselves.
Spearheading the squad will
be sophomore captain Ann Shee
hy, Truitt, and senior Stefanie
Jensen. Truitt, the 1993 captain,
is the most experienced and con
sistent of the Stanford runners.
Jensen, meanwhile, was the first
Cardinal to cross the finish line
at Pac-10's last year and expects
to run at the forefront routinely
this season.
Sheehy, according to Lanan
na, has made great strides since
her Stanford arrival. Although
she broke her foot at NCAA's
last year, Sheehy has recovered
steadily. By the end of the sea
son, she expects to improve
herl4th-place finish at the 1993
Pac-10's to a top-ten placement.
"Sarah, Ann, Amanda, and
Stefanie are all potential front
runners," Lananna said.

Other notable runners such
as Burr, Chokshi, Hayward, and
senior Kay Luo return to fill
their own shoes. Additionally,
Stanford hopes that at least one
of its outstanding freshman
recruits might pick up some of
the slack Watson left behind.
Three of the Cardinal fresh
men, Renfro, Dunscombe, and
Aimee Langevin, were high
school All-Americans.
Renfro, from Federal Way,
Wash., captured the national
crown for the one mile race in
1993 and was also ranked third
nationally in the 3,000 meters
and cross country. Langevin,
from Fiskdale, Mass., was the
1993 New England two-mile
champion. Dunscombe, from
Bend, Ore., was the 1994 Oregon
state 1,500 meter and 3,000
meter champion.
"Sarna, Aimee, and Kortney
are all very tough," said Lanan
na. "They all have a very good
shot at cracking the top seven."
Despite all the individual tal
ent, the Cardinal's key to suc
cess in 1994 will hinge on a
which led last year's team to
faster finishes; running in a
tight pack as a team.
"We're in it together," Sheehy
said. "In running, you come to a
point where there's a tremen
dous amount of pain. But when
you look around and see your
teammates and run not for your
self but as part of a team, you're
able to push through the barrier
of pain. That's the fun part."
Lananna, too, believes that it
may not be so much a matter of
who is the most talented, but
what group will perform the
best.
"We can put together a lot of
different line-ups, but it has to

be the right combination," the
coach said.
Hence, Stanford will use its
early meets to test individual
runners and different line-ups.
Until the championship season
rolls around — Pac-10's, Dis
tricts, and NCAA's — the Cardi
nal will take it one race at a time.

"Last year is last year," Shee
hy said. "We have to work on
this year."
Indeed, in the Pac-10 alone,
sixth-ranked Oregon and 10th
ranked UCLA are poised to end
Stanford's new-found domi
nance. Nonetheless, the Cardi
nal definitely enters this season

with its sights set farther on the
horizon, especially after its
umph over the top-ranked
Razorbacks.
"Last year, we didn't really
know where we would end up
late in the season," Lananna
said. "This year, we have more of
a vision."
