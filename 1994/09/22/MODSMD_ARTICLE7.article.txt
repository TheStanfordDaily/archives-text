# Dorms reopening in the nick of time
## 
### Juthymas Harntha Senior staff writer 
With Florence Moore Hall
ready for occupation and Synergy
on its way, the University has al
most succeeded in the scramble to
finish its scheduled dorm renova
tions before students arrive.
The University showed off the
refurbished Flo Mo as well as three
of the row houses — Hammarskjold
House, Phi Sig and 553 Mayfield —
at open houses on Tuesday.
Synergy — which is being
moved to the old Cooksey House —
was not able to join in the presen
tation of new carpeting and modu
lar furniture, however, because of
regulations that have made the re
construction process slow.
The earthquake-damaged
house had to be reconstructed to
retain its "historical character" in
order to get Federal Emergency

Management Agency funds, said
Keith Guy, the director of Housing
and Dining Services.
"On the first floor, each brick
had to be taken out and renum
bered and put back in order," Guy
said. The process is "more lengthy
than anyone estimated."
Residents of Synergy should be
able to move their belongings into
the dorm on today, and will be able
to move in on Saturday, said Diana
Conklin, the acting co-director of
residential education.
In the meantime, Synergy resi
dents will live in the Enchanted
Broccoli Forest house and eat their
meals in Columbae.
Flo Mo, on the other hand, is
just barely ready in time for fresh
man arrival, though some touch
ups will have to be made.
The $6.5-million project ran
into trouble in July when Univer
sity facilities supervisors realized
that the plans they had drawn up
would cost over $1 million more
than the original budget, Guy
said.
At that point, he said, con
struction had not yet begun. It
took another three weeks for the
University team of architects and
consultants to rework the plans.
"We had to get rid of some of
the niceties" like an outdoor
amphitheater and an ice-cream
eatery, Guy said, "but they were
not the heart of the project."
The new plans also meant that
the contractors only had six
weeks to finish the renovation,
rather than nine weeks.
By the last week, construction
workers were working "twelve
hours a day, seven days a week"
in the push to have the dorm
ready before the freshmen
arrived, said Gary Franich, the
general foreman of the project for

Rudolph and Sletten, the general
contractors.
In the end, though, the project
was completed on budget, said
Mark Jones, the director of facili
ties project management. He said
the University did not have to
pay for the overtime because the
contractors were on a time-limit
ed contract, which meant they
agreed to finished the project for
a set price during the time allot
ted.
The resident assistants had to
wait about a week before they
could move in, but they were
always assured that Flo Mo would
be ready in time for the freshmen,
said senior Jessica Alderman, an
RAin Alondra, "or else they were
going to have to deal with 10,000
screaming parents."
Alderman, however, said she
and the other RAs "were a little
worried when [the workers] were
still drilling in the bathrooms at
11 p.m. the night before the open
house."
Besides the new carpeting and
furniture, the dorm also has a
completely remodeled dining
area. Though the old meal system

and serving style remain, the new
eatery is much more spacious and
brighter, painted in pastels and
decked with large windows look
ing out into the courtyard.
There are still a few smaller
tasks left — plastic sheets were
still on some of the walls during
the open house — as well as some
exterior improvement left to be
done, but Jones said they were
"generally not critical. Flo Mo is
definitely occupiable."
Synergy should also be ready
for occupation on Saturday. "We
just want to get all the interior
work done so we don't have to
come back in later," Guy said.
Mainly, that includes work such
as stai/iing and sanding the walls
and stairway.
Work on the house is still going
to continue after Saturday, but
Guy said that it would be mostly
exterior and less intrusive to the
residents.
The other three row houses
slated for renovation are essen
tially finished, fitted with new
carpeting, furniture, kitchen
appliances and in-room SUNet
connections.
