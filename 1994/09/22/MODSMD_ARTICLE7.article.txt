With Florence Moore Hall
ready for occupation and Synergy
on its way, the University has al
most succeeded in the scramble to
finish its scheduled dorm renova
tions before students arrive.
The University showed off the
refurbished Flo Mo as well as three
of the row houses — Hammarskjold
House, Phi Sig and 553 Mayfield —
at open houses on Tuesday.
Synergy — which is being
moved to the old Cooksey House —
was not able to join in the presen
tation of new carpeting and modu
lar furniture, however, because of
regulations that have made the re
construction process slow.
The earthquake-damaged
house had to be reconstructed to
retain its "historical character" in
order to get Federal Emergency

Management Agency funds, said
Keith Guy, the director of Housing
and Dining Services.
"On the first floor, each brick
had to be taken out and renum
bered and put back in order," Guy
said. The process is "more lengthy
than anyone estimated."
Residents of Synergy should be
able to move their belongings into
the dorm on today, and will be able
to move in on Saturday, said Diana
Conklin, the acting co-director of
residential education.
In the meantime, Synergy resi
dents will live in the Enchanted
Broccoli Forest house and eat their
meals in Columbae.
Flo Mo, on the other hand, is
just barely ready in time for fresh
man arrival, though some touch
ups will have to be made.
