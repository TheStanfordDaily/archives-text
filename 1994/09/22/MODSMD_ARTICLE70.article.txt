# Tiger Woods: Just another frosh? Standout golfer begins life on the Farm
## 
### Allyson Mizoguchi Editorial staff 
What Tiger Woods lacks in years,
he more than makes up for in ama
teur golfing championships.
"Age doesn't matter," said
Woods simply.
And considering the honors this
18-year-old from Cypress, Calif.,
has accrued since he first swung a
golf club at the age of one, Woods
has not allowed anything else to
slow him down either.
To the rest of the world, Woods is
a golfing star, a putting phenom, a
rare talent who will smash records
and stereotypes with a swing of his
mighty club. Indeed, the accolades
seem to exponentially grow with
every passing year. The first to
praise Woods is his new head coach,
Wally Goodwin, in his eighth year of
coaching the Stanford golf team.
"Tiger will be an All-American all
four years he's here, there's no
doubt," said Goodwin. "And that's
the first time I've been able to say
that [about anyone]."
Goodwin is not alone in his esti
mation of Woods, going so far as to
claim that Woods is the best player
at his current age level who has ever
lived. Woods has earned interna
tional attention in his sport, and for
good reason.
This summer alone, he won the
Pacific Northwest Amateur, the
Southern California Amateur and
the Western Amateur. In August he
capped off his successful summer
with a dramatic come-from-behind
finish to claim the U.S. National
Amateur title at Ponte Vedra
Beach, Fla. He was the youngest
player, and the first African-Ameri
can, ever to win the title.
It seems that Woods can go
nowhere except into the record
books during his promised four
year stint as a Cardinal, and from
there the door to the professional
world is warm and welcoming.
For now, however, Woods is a
Stanford freshman, a student-ath

lete experiencing the usual anxiety
about classes and time manage
ment. When Woods is toting around
a backpack instead of golf clubs, he
blends in better with the crowd.
"I'm nervous," said Woods. "I'm
nervous about starting school and
finding my groove."
Woods clearly believes that his
"groove" includes a life apart from
the golf course, but he is not sure
what to expect. Asked how he plans
to balance the many facets of his life
in the coming year, Woods said,
"Since classes haven't started yet, I
can't gauge how it's going to be. I
don't know ... what do you sug
gest?"
His first weeks on the Farm have
been spent training and working
with his new teammates. Woods has
been "havingalot of fun" duringthe
initial adjustment period and feels
happy about the dynamics of the
group.
It will be a big year not only for
Woods, but for the entire golf team.
As last year's N CAA champions, the
team looks to defend its title using
the experience of four returning
starters compounded with Woods'
powerful presence.
Goodwin said the team has an
ticipated Woods' arrival for some
time, planning and structuring the
squad for the last couple of years in
order to ensure the national title
this year.
"Winning the NCAAs last year
was a little premature in a way, and
it's always hardest to repeat," Good
win said. "But this team will set all
of Stanford's records. It is immense
ly talented."
This past weekend at the William
Tucker Invitational in Albu
querque, Woods quickly set the
precedent in his collegiate debut. Al
though as a team Stanford took
eighth, Woods led from the start,
finishing first out of 108 golfers at
eight under par.
It was precisely the performance
everyone anticipated from Woods.
In terms of expectations, however,

Woods prefers to set his own pace. "I
try to ignore others' expectations
and focus on my own," he says.
Speaking of Woods on a personal
level, Goodwin said the freshman is
"modest but confident ... a great
kid, not the least bit arrogant."
Goodwin further explained that be
cause the sport of golf demands
emotionally reliable players to func
tion as a team, Woods fills the role
perfectly.
While Woods will go through the

usual adjustments as a freshman, it
is clear that his talent on the golfing
range sets him apart from his fellow
classmates of 1998. After all, three
days after classes begin, he will
board a plane for Versailles, France,
to compete at the 19th World Ama
teur Team Championship. There he
will be one of four amateurs to rep
resent the United States.
He may be only 18, but Woods is
a first-class golfer with veteran ex
perience and talent.

team looks to defend its title using
the experience of four returning
starters compounded with Woods'
powerful presence.
Goodwin said the team has an
ticipated Woods' arrival for some
time, planning and structuring the
squad for the last couple of years in
order to ensure the national title
this year.
"Winning the NCAAs last year
was a little premature in a way, and
it's always hardest to repeat," Good
win said. "But this team will set all
of Stanford's records. It is immense
ly talented."
This past weekend at the William
Tucker Invitational in Albu
querque, Woods quickly set the
precedent in his collegiate debut. Al
though as a team Stanford took
eighth, Woods led from the start,
finishing first out of 108 golfers at
eight under par.
It was precisely the performance
everyone anticipated from Woods.
In terms of expectations, however,

Woods prefers to set his own pace. "I
try to ignore others' expectations
and focus on my own," he says.
Speaking of Woods on a personal
level, Goodwin said the freshman is
"modest but confident ... a great
kid, not the least bit arrogant."
Goodwin further explained that be
cause the sport of golf demands
emotionally reliable players to func
tion as a team, Woods fills the role
perfectly.
While Woods will go through the

usual adjustments as a freshman, it
is clear that his talent on the golfing
range sets him apart from his fellow
classmates of 1998. After all, three
days after classes begin, he will
board a plane for Versailles, France,
to compete at the 19th World Ama
teur Team Championship. There he
will be one of four amateurs to rep
resent the United States.
He may be only 18, but Woods is
a first-class golfer with veteran ex
perience and talent.
