# Fab frosh: the newest members of Walsh's family
## 
### Greg Collins Staff writer 
Don't look now, but The Farm is beginning to har
vest the top young football talent in the nation.
For the second year in a row, Stanford has brought in
one of the most promising freshman classes in the coun
try, and head coach Bill Walsh has looked to them early
and often in the season's first two games.
So, while adjusting to campus life and readying for
the academic rigors of Stanford, these 15 freshmen
must also learn one of the most complex play books in
college football. But this class should be up to the task,
as it includes 13 high school All-Americans and nine
Honor Society members.
"We're a very, very young team," Walsh said. "We're
starting so many underclassmen and they're all gaining
experience as fast as we can get it for them."
This year's freshman class is marked by an abun
dance of pure athletic ability. Anthony Bookman,

Chris Draft, Damon Dunn, Kadar Hamilton and
Corey Hill are all talented and quick players who ar
rived on campus looking to fill in at the offensive skill
positions.
Knowing that there was simply not enough room for
all of them to play running back or wide receiver, the
Cardinal coaching staff quickly moved Draft, Hamilton
and Hill over to the defensive side of the ball. All three
have seen action in games, with Draft starting the San
Jose State contest at free safety and recording a team
high seven tackles.
Despite the early success of the class, they are still
quick to note how much more they need to learn before
playing up to potential.
"It's a lot different from high school," said Hamilton.
"In high school you drew plays up in the dirt. Here, it's
a lot more complex, more thought-out."
Also starting in the San Jose State game was line
backer Kailee Wong, who recorded two tackles and
knocked down one pass. Unfortunately earlier this week

in practice, Wong re-aggravated an ankle injury which
kept him out of the Northwestern game and his is now
listed as day-to-day.
"This [injuiy] is not uncommon, especially for fresh
men," Walsh said. "Freshmen typically can be so
promising but there can be so many frustrating after
noons — a lot of minor injuries and mishaps, and then
after spring practice they're all ready to go again."
Bookman, another member of the Class of 1998 to
see playing time, was a consensus All-American in high
school who has been timed as fast as 4.2 in the 40-yard
dash. Used primarily as a kick returner, Bookman ranks
fifth in that category in the Pacific 10 with a 23-yard av
erage. He has also carried the ball five times for 25 yards.
"I love kickoff returns," said Bookman. "Even
though you may not be on offense, it can break a game
wide open, so I just try to concentratejust like I had a po
sition."
Senior quarterback Steve Stenstrom has already
seen the progress of many of the freshmen, notably

Bookman.
"Anthony's still learning everything, getting into the
swing of things, and he's getting more and more confi
dence as he plays the game," said Stenstrom. "He's hav
ing some success returning kickoffs. That will help his
confidence level as he becomes another back in our of
fense."
With only two games played so far, a remarkable nine
of the 15 freshmen have seen playingtime. Despite their
relative inexperience, Walsh promises even more expo
sure for many of this class, especially Draft, Hamilton
and Bookman, whom he expects to blossom by the fifth
or sixth game.
As for off the field, Hamilton noted how close this
year's class had grown in only the short time they have
been on campus.
"We look after each other, like we're all brothers,"
Hamilton said. "If somebody gets in a fight, the fresh
men are there to break it up. If somebody has something
wrong with them, we're there for them."
