# The 						wheres and whys of sports at Stanford ...or, an insider's guide to finding the secret of life
## 
### Kathryn Yang Senior staff writer 
For all you freshmen this column will pro
vide you with blow-by-blow coverage of the
fall sports season. Clip it out and paste it to
your CIV readers so you won't ever leave
home without it.
Beginning at the newly renovated Stan
ford Stadium we have our very own resident
demigod, the Godfather of the Gridiron, Mr.
Bill Walsh. But really, that's no big deal,
because like all the commonfolk around here
you too can walk into his office and genuflect
to kiss his Super Bowl rings.
And if he's in a good mood this season he
might even grant you a favor. How about a
Top-10 ranking? A trip to the Rose Bowl? A
Heisman for quarterback Steve Stenstrom?
A shopping spree at Footlocker? Reinstate
Aristide in Haiti? Cancel the World Series?
Resurrection of Joe Montana's career? Four
more years for Clinton? Peace in the Middle
East? Penile enlargement? No new taxes?
Read his lips, Walsh can do it... all except
for the Footlocker thing. I think Bobby Bow

den beat him to it.
Sharing the stadium rent with Walsh
last year was cross-country coach Vin
Lananna. His old concrete, bunker-like
office, located by the start mark of the 100-

yard dash, was a far cry from Walsh's oak
paneled, plush-carpet palace, but like his
stadium time-share partner, Lananna was
in the business of turning out champions.
This year, Lananna is moving on up ... the
man has carpet.
Before we move past the stadium, it's sort
of interesting to note that Lananna's runners
like to lighten the rigors of cross-country

training by expressing themselves in their
annual freedom run. And for most guys, free
dom connotes an unsanctioned and unaes
thetic reproduction of, uh, that Disney classic
Free Willy.
That last tidbit was reproduced without the
expressed written consent of Major League
Baseball, and uh oh, I'm gonna get sued.
After visiting Lananna's office you might
want to wander out of the Stadium stage east
and follow the gravel path past Sunken Dia
mond baseball field and toward Maloney
Field.
There you'll fmd the only place left in
America where World Cup fever has not cor
ner-kicked the bucket.
You remember that female soccer player
on those "Life's short. Play hard" Reebok
commercials? The one who shares air time
with another Disney favorite, Nancy Kerrig
an? That's Julie Foudy, Stanford '92; and
Maloney Field is the house that Foudy built.
Pretty impressive, huh? It'll be even better
this year.
About 30 paces from Maloney Field is
DeGuerre Pool, home of those water-tread

ing, sun-bathing, tan-perfecting, lotion
smothering, ball-chucking, Speedo-clad,
NCAA title-winning, golden-California
image-portraying, splish-splashing, mus
cle-flexing, polo-playing kids. Say that 10
times and coach Dante Dettamanti might
even let you touch his NCAA trophy.
Adjacent to the pool stands the Cardinal's
best hope for an NCAA title this falL Fifteen
ladies and one brilliant coach occupy Maples
Pavilion this fall in hopes of bringing another
banner home this year. The last time Stan
ford bumped, set and spiked its way to a
national title was 1991. It's about time, don't
you think?
Now, unlike most schools, Stanford sports
are not on a pay-per-view basis. Nope,
instead, with three easy payments of $8,8 00
a year this package can be yours.
And if you order now, Stanford will throw
in a deflated GPA, 5000 pre-meds and a nine
week, all-expenses-paid getaway with Cecil H.
Green. Prices do not include tax, license or
docking fees, and tuition is subject to go up
without notice.
