# Shining Knight Hoops star looks ahead

### Allyson Mizoguchi Editorial staff 
In his first year of collegiate
basketball, Brevin Knight made
everyone forget he was a fresh
man.
As a 17 year-old point guard
fresh out of East Orange, New
Jersey, Knight faced a challenging
task: to lead a team that had gone
7-23 the previous season. Up
against the likes of Cal's Jason
Kidd and UCLA's Tyus Edney,
success would not come easv.

'He's not intimidated
by anyone. He's out
there screaming and
hollering at the
seniors, and shows
no fear at all.'
â€” Keith Larsen

But Knight was no typical 17
year-old, nor was he a typical
frosh. In fact, his strong presence
and skills on the court earned him
Pacific 10 Conference 1993-94
Freshman of the Year honors,
only the third Cardinal athlete
ever to receive this distinction.
Knight also garnered honorable
mention Ail-American recogni
tion, and is one of only nine
sophomores this year nominated
for the Wooden Award, consid
ered the Heisman Trophy of bas
ketball.
According to Cardinal assistant
coach Keith Larsen, Knight was
instrumental in getting Stanford
basketball back in the running.
"[Knight] is definitely one of
the main reasons we turned
around to become 17-10," said
Larsen. "He brings a winning atti
tude to the team. . .and refuses to

lose."
A sign of the future came early
in last year's season against Vir
ginia, when Knight scored 23
points, stole four passes, and
dished out a career-high eleven
assists in the Cardinal's 84-72 vic
tory. Against McNeese State,
Knight almost recorded Stan
ford's first triple-double ever with
21 points, nine assists, and a Pac
-10 record-setting 10 steals.
Clearly, the fact that he was
sometimes five years younger
than his opponents and team
mates did not come between
Knight and his play.
"He is a rare leader," Larsen
said. "He's not intimidated by
anyone. He's out there screaming
and hollering at the seniors, and
shows no fear at all."
As a shooting force last season,
he racked up 11.1 points per
game, and averaged 5.4 assists per
game, fourth in the conference.
Knight's quickness was evi
denced by his defensive prowess.
He set a new school record by col
lecting a total of 77 steals during
the season, and was the leading
Pac-10 freshman thief and second
overall with 2.8 steals per game.
His 10 steals against McNeese
State was a national season-best.
After last year, Knight will be
expected to fill an even larger
leadership role.
"We'll look to him to be a little
more offensive-minded, to score a
little bit more," Larsen said.
Knight sees himself changing
his role in order to help the team
on its way to the NCAA tourna
ment.
"As a frosh, people didn't
expect that much and I didn't
have to worry about big expecta
tions," said Knight. "There was
no pressure and I could go out
there and have fun every game.
This year will be different. I want
to be more of a leader, and take
more responsibility for the team
on and off the court."
