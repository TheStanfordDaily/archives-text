When speaking of the Stan
ford women's field hockey team,
youth is not necessarily a weak
ness. Of seven strong recruits,
two are immediate starters and
all are expected to contribute to a
run for the regional champi
onships.
"It's a young squad this year,"
said 10-year head coach Sheryl
Johnson. "At this point, we're
looking for more team confidence
and experience together on the
field."
Despite the Cardinal's 1-5
record so far this season, John
son is hopeful for a strong finish
in the Northern Pacific (NorPac)
field hockey conference. With the
contributions of freshmen Kelly
Nay lor and Paige Mader, as well
as leadership from senior Tina
Syer and juniors Leah Jacobs
and Elise Morgan, a berth at
regionals is more than just a pos
sibility.
Naylor, one of the most heavi
ly recruited goalkeepers in the
nation, has had several impres
sive performances already.
Against Wake Forest on Sept. 8,
Naylor kept the Deacons score
less for the first 47 minutes and
racked up 25 saves. She also pre
vented top-ranked North Caroli
na from scoring for 20 minutes at
their Sept. 7 match.
"[Naylor] has had some awe
some saves," Johnson said. "We
just need to start generating
more attacks from her saves."
Mader, the starting right mid
fielder, is another frosh who has
made a clear impact in the first
six games. "[Mader] has a lot of
offensive and defensive responsi
bilities and has been very consis
tent," Johnson said.
Stanford has shown a great
deal of talent in the defensive
department, with Jacobs at
sweeper, sophomore Amy Marfil
at center back, and sophomore
Karla Petersen and junior Rachel
Timbie at side backs. Syer and
Morgan will hold the midfield

line, while the forwards will capi
talize on the scoring talents of
junior Jennifer Glueck and
sophomores Susan Dish man and
Kory Taylor.
While the leadership of graduate
senior Sarah Hallcok will surely be
missed, the youthful squad main
tains high hopes for an exciting sea
son of development and improve
ment. After tackling its next foe,
University of Pacific, Saturday, the
Cardinal will gear up to accomplish
one of its most important early sea
son objectives — revenging last Fri
day's 0-3 loss to California.
