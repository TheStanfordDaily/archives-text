# Four women Race Across America in record time
## Team cycles from California to Georgia 
### Allyson Mizoguchi Editorial staff 
As if biking at Stanford
weren't perilous enough, four
Cardinal cyclists pedaled across
the 2,900 miles of rugged asphalt
between Irvine, Calif., and Savan
nah, Ga., in the Race Across
America event this summer.
Team Mountain High Yogurt /
Kaiser Permanente, consisting of
junior Kelley Herndon, recent
graduate Nicole Freedman and
medical students Cynthia Fergu

son and Megan Troxell, crossed
the finish line as both the first
ever all women's team to com
plete the event, and the new
record-holders with a time of 6
days, 12 hours, and 49 minutes.
In this endurance event,
cyclists rode relay style across the
country throughout day and
night. The four racers established
a rotation which allowed two
hour breaks for every hour of rid
ing. Additionally, each had an
eight-hour sleep shift while the
other three rode. Although short

on sleep, the team energized with
plenty of carbohydrates, including
cereal, pasta, burritos, and a
hearty pancake breakfast every
day.
The course led the 15 partici
pating teams through the heat of
California and Arizona, Col
orado's treacherous mountain
climbs, and the flat stretches of
the southern states. With two
support vehicles and a crew of
family and friends, the team left
Irvine on the morning of July 31.
From the start, racers endured
the 110 degree heat of the Mojave
Desert and adopted a conservative
strategy to avoid complications.
The team alternated riders every
20 to 30 minutes, and the crew
worked to keep the riders hydrat
ed and cool with water sprays and
ice.
"Biking through the desert
mid-day in the summer I realized
it's not the mileage, but the heat,
the hills, the rain, sleep depriva
tion and dehydration that will
break you," said Freedman.
Adverse conditions gave the
riders no relief as their communi
cation system between the sup
port vehicles failed in the middle
of the day. After missing a race
checkpoint due to the CB failure,
Team Mountain High Yogurt /
Kaiser Permanente was forced to
backtrack a number of miles.
Once night arrived, and riders
and equipment were exchanged,
the team concentrated on chasing
down the two women that had
passed them during their brief
hardship.
"Riding at night was absolutely
incredible," said Troxell. "Every
thing is black except a small circle
of light right around you. You
can't see where you are going or
where you have been. . . . You can
get into a rhythm and just
cruise."
By dawn, the team had re

passed one of the teams.
The second day, the four
women raced through a surpris
ingly temperate Arizona at an
average pace of 19 miles per hour
over approximately 430 miles. By
the third day, the women pedaled
into Colorado.
A flat tire on the pace vehicle
presented the first test of what
would be a challenging ride

through Colorado. Without the
possibility of a relief rider or addi
tional water, Ferguson was left to
climb a steep mountain grade
alone. Once the crew got the pace
vehicle back on the road, the team
saw its next test ahead — the
Rocky Mountains.
The riders faced three moun
tain passes through the Rockies,
each at least 9,000 feet high. The

first, Wolfe Creek Pass, was the
race's highest point at almost
11,000 feet. Although fatigue and
oxygen deprivation began to take
their toll, spirits were still high.
Herndon sped down the backside
of Wolfe Creek Pass at nearly 50
miles an hour, preparing the team
for the next climb.

While the second mountain
had a lower altitude than the
first, the headwinds and heat
more than compensated for the
kinder incline. After a long day of
the competition, Troxell pulled
the team over the third mountain
pass just after sunset.
With the Rockies behind them,
the riders focused on the less
menacing terrain of Oklahoma
and Arkansas. The women picked
up the pace as they recovered
along the flat stretches of corn
fields and telephone poles.
The women raced through
Tennessee on the sixth day, bat

tling both humidity and
monotony. An encounter with
solo rider Daniel Chew inspired a
quicker pace, and by the after
noon, the team passed the first
place female rider.
"The [solo riders] we passed in
Arkansas and Tennessee were
really inspiring. As we went by,
they literally woke up, and were
suddenly motivated to ride fast
and maintain contact, probably
the only contact they had seen in
days," said Troxell.
Passing the leading male solo
rider was the final challenge to
the four women on their way to
the finish line. The women fin
ished over an hour ahead of the
first place solo rider as they
crossed the line around 1 a.m. on
August 7. They had averaged

18.52 miles per hour over the
2,900 miles.
"My favorite rides were riding
down the Rockies at night sur
rounded by fog, riding through
Memphis at 5:00 a.m. before the
city came to life and riding into
Savannah as a team. I will never
forget these rides," said Ferguson.
The four women already look
to defend their championship at
next year's event, which will
hopefully sport competition from
a larger field of women's teams.
"I would love to do this again. I
feel like we proved a lot to our
selves, and said a lot about what
college women can accomplish,"
Freedman said. "Next year the
challenge will be to see just how
much farther we can push our
selves."

20 to 30 minutes, and the crew
worked to keep the riders hydrat
ed and cool with water sprays and
ice.
"Biking through the desert
mid-day in the summer I realized
it's not the mileage, but the heat,
the hills, the rain, sleep depriva
tion and dehydration that will
break you," said Freedman.
Adverse conditions gave the
riders no relief as their communi
cation system between the sup
port vehicles failed in the middle
of the day. After missing a race
checkpoint due to the CB failure,
Team Mountain High Yogurt /
Kaiser Permanente was forced to
backtrack a number of miles.
Once night arrived, and riders
and equipment were exchanged,
the team concentrated on chasing
down the two women that had
passed them during their brief
hardship.
"Riding at night was absolutely
incredible," said Troxell. "Every
thing is black except a small circle
of light right around you. You
can't see where you are going or
where you have been. . . . You can
get into a rhythm and just
cruise."
By dawn, the team had re

passed one of the teams.
The second day, the four
women raced through a surpris
ingly temperate Arizona at an
average pace of 19 miles per hour
over approximately 430 miles. By
the third day, the women pedaled
into Colorado.
A flat tire on the pace vehicle
presented the first test of what
would be a challenging ride

through Colorado. Without the
possibility of a relief rider or addi
tional water, Ferguson was left to
climb a steep mountain grade
alone. Once the crew got the pace
vehicle back on the road, the team
saw its next test ahead — the
Rocky Mountains.
The riders faced three moun
tain passes through the Rockies,
each at least 9,000 feet high. The

first, Wolfe Creek Pass, was the
race's highest point at almost
11,000 feet. Although fatigue and
oxygen deprivation began to take
their toll, spirits were still high.
Herndon sped down the backside
of Wolfe Creek Pass at nearly 50
miles an hour, preparing the team
for the next climb.

While the second mountain
had a lower altitude than the
first, the headwinds and heat
more than compensated for the
kinder incline. After a long day of
the competition, Troxell pulled
the team over the third mountain
pass just after sunset.
With the Rockies behind them,
the riders focused on the less
menacing terrain of Oklahoma
and Arkansas. The women picked
up the pace as they recovered
along the flat stretches of corn
fields and telephone poles.
The women raced through
Tennessee on the sixth day, bat

tling both humidity and
monotony. An encounter with
solo rider Daniel Chew inspired a
quicker pace, and by the after
noon, the team passed the first
place female rider.
"The [solo riders] we passed in
Arkansas and Tennessee were
really inspiring. As we went by,
they literally woke up, and were
suddenly motivated to ride fast
and maintain contact, probably
the only contact they had seen in
days," said Troxell.
Passing the leading male solo
rider was the final challenge to
the four women on their way to
the finish line. The women fin
ished over an hour ahead of the
first place solo rider as they
crossed the line around 1 a.m. on
August 7. They had averaged

18.52 miles per hour over the
2,900 miles.
"My favorite rides were riding
down the Rockies at night sur
rounded by fog, riding through
Memphis at 5:00 a.m. before the
city came to life and riding into
Savannah as a team. I will never
forget these rides," said Ferguson.
The four women already look
to defend their championship at
next year's event, which will
hopefully sport competition from
a larger field of women's teams.
"I would love to do this again. I
feel like we proved a lot to our
selves, and said a lot about what
college women can accomplish,"
Freedman said. "Next year the
challenge will be to see just how
much farther we can push our
selves."
As if biking at Stanford
weren't perilous enough, four
Cardinal cyclists pedaled across
the 2,900 miles of rugged asphalt
between Irvine, Calif., and Savan
nah, Ga., in the Race Across
America event this summer.
Team Mountain High Yogurt /
Kaiser Permanente, consisting of
junior Kelley Herndon, recent
graduate Nicole Freedman and
medical students Cynthia Fergu

son and Megan Troxell, crossed
the finish line as both the first
ever all women's team to com
plete the event, and the new
record-holders with a time of 6
days, 12 hours, and 49 minutes.
In this endurance event,
cyclists rode relay style across the
country throughout day and
night. The four racers established
a rotation which allowed two
hour breaks for every hour of rid
ing. Additionally, each had an
eight-hour sleep shift while the
other three rode. Although short

on sleep, the team energized with
plenty of carbohydrates, including
cereal, pasta, burritos, and a
hearty pancake breakfast every
day.
The course led the 15 partici
pating teams through the heat of
California and Arizona, Col
orado's treacherous mountain
climbs, and the flat stretches of
the southern states. With two
support vehicles and a crew of
family and friends, the team left
Irvine on the morning of July 31.
From the start, racers endured
the 110 degree heat of the Mojave
Desert and adopted a conservative
strategy to avoid complications.
The team alternated riders every
20 to 30 minutes, and the crew
worked to keep the riders hydrat
ed and cool with water sprays and
ice.
"Biking through the desert
mid-day in the summer I realized

tion and dehydration that will
