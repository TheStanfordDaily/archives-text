# Four women Race Across America in record time
## Team cycles from California to Georgia 
### Allyson Mizoguchi Editorial staff 
As if biking at Stanford
weren't perilous enough, four
Cardinal cyclists pedaled across
the 2,900 miles of rugged asphalt
between Irvine, Calif., and Savan
nah, Ga., in the Race Across
America event this summer.
Team Mountain High Yogurt /
Kaiser Permanente, consisting of
junior Kelley Herndon, recent
graduate Nicole Freedman and
medical students Cynthia Fergu

son and Megan Troxell, crossed
the finish line as both the first
ever all women's team to com
plete the event, and the new
record-holders with a time of 6
days, 12 hours, and 49 minutes.
In this endurance event,
cyclists rode relay style across the
country throughout day and
night. The four racers established
a rotation which allowed two
hour breaks for every hour of rid
ing. Additionally, each had an
eight-hour sleep shift while the
other three rode. Although short

on sleep, the team energized with
plenty of carbohydrates, including
cereal, pasta, burritos, and a
hearty pancake breakfast every
day.
The course led the 15 partici
pating teams through the heat of
California and Arizona, Col
orado's treacherous mountain
climbs, and the flat stretches of
the southern states. With two
support vehicles and a crew of
family and friends, the team left
Irvine on the morning of July 31.
From the start, racers endured
the 110 degree heat of the Mojave
Desert and adopted a conservative
strategy to avoid complications.
The team alternated riders every
20 to 30 minutes, and the crew
worked to keep the riders hydrat
ed and cool with water sprays and
ice.
"Biking through the desert
mid-day in the summer I realized
it's not the mileage, but the heat,
the hills, the rain, sleep depriva
tion and dehydration that will
break you," said Freedman.
Adverse conditions gave the
riders no relief as their communi
cation system between the sup
port vehicles failed in the middle
of the day. After missing a race
checkpoint due to the CB failure,
Team Mountain High Yogurt /
Kaiser Permanente was forced to
backtrack a number of miles.
Once night arrived, and riders
and equipment were exchanged,
the team concentrated on chasing
down the two women that had
passed them during their brief
hardship.
"Riding at night was absolutely
incredible," said Troxell. "Every
thing is black except a small circle
of light right around you. You
can't see where you are going or
where you have been. . . . You can
get into a rhythm and just
cruise."
By dawn, the team had re

passed one of the teams.
The second day, the four
women raced through a surpris
ingly temperate Arizona at an
average pace of 19 miles per hour
over approximately 430 miles. By
the third day, the women pedaled
into Colorado.
A flat tire on the pace vehicle
presented the first test of what
would be a challenging ride

through Colorado. Without the
possibility of a relief rider or addi
tional water, Ferguson was left to
climb a steep mountain grade
alone. Once the crew got the pace
vehicle back on the road, the team
saw its next test ahead â€” the
Rocky Mountains.
The riders faced three moun
tain passes through the Rockies,
each at least 9,000 feet high. The

first, Wolfe Creek Pass, was the
race's highest point at almost
11,000 feet. Although fatigue and
oxygen deprivation began to take
their toll, spirits were still high.
Herndon sped down the backside
of Wolfe Creek Pass at nearly 50
miles an hour, preparing the team
for the next climb.
