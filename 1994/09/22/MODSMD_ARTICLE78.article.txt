# Cross country laces up its shoes
## Men will rely on youth in quest for a top three Pac-10 finish 
### Sam Wu Editorial staff 
While most teams would celebrate the
arrival of top recruits, the 16th-ranked
Stanford men's cross country lapses into
worrisome flashbacks.
As with the previous year, the 1994 Car
dinal is marveling at three highly touted
freshmen.
Nathan Nutter, from Phoenix, Ariz.,
ran away with top honors in the 1994 Gold
en West Invitational, an event which fea
tured top high school seniors from the
West Coast. Matt Farley, a Sacramento,
Calif, native, and Zak Wright, who hails
from Jaffrey, N.H., finished ninth and
17th respectively at nationals last year.
Both earned All-American honors.
"They're three of the top recruits in the
countiy," Lananna said. "They have great
speed, great attitude, and are very good
competitors."
However, the overshadowing presence
of a powerful freshman class is reminiscent

of Stanford's 1993 season, during which
the Cardinal lacked veteran firepower and
finished fifth in the Pacific 10 Conference
Championships.
Last season the Cardinal featured Ail-
American Gary Stolz, who consistently ran
ahead of the competition and led Stanford
in virtually every meet. However, Stan
ford's strong contingent of sophomores did
not provide then-freshmen standouts Greg
Jimmerson, Andrew Cowgill, and J.J.
White with enough upperclass support.
"We have a shot of contending in the
Pac-10," Lananna said. "Hopefully we can
be in the top three. But we must get per
formances from our talented sophomores,
who are now more experienced. People like
Greg, Andy, and J.J. must step up from
last season."
Since high school men's cross country
teams run a shorter distance than the col
legiate five-mile course, freshmen may run
well initially, but cannot maintain that
level throughout the championships.
Thus, freshman year is devoted to a transi

tion to the longer race.
"We didn't do so well at the end of the
season last year," said junior captain Rob
Reeder. "Hopefully we can run without
putting too much pressure on the fresh
men."
Ideally, therefore, Reeder and his fellow
veterans will be the ones to take on the
well-balanced Pac-10 teams. With adver
saries such as eighth-ranked Arizona,
defending conference champion Washing
ton, 17th-ranked Oregon, and UCLA,
there is no clear favorite.
"This is going to be a huge development
year," Lananna said. "We're still about a
year away from really big things."
However, Stanford's results so far have
been optimistic. The Cardinal posted a first
place finish in the University of San Fran
cisco Invitational on Sept. 10. It also man
aged a second place performance behind a
formidable Northern Arizona team in the
UC-Irvine Cross Country Invitational held
last Saturday at Costa Mesa, Calif.
Lananna's words, therefore, did not

mean that Stanford does not have high
expectations of itself.
"We have good depth," Lananna said.
"We lack someone with front running expe
rience, but we have the ability to run as a
pack. If we can translate our depth into

tough running, we can catch some people."
Reeder echoes his coach's warning to
the Cardinal's opponents.
"We can mix it up better this year," he
said. "We're going to surprise some people.
Look for us to do some good things."
