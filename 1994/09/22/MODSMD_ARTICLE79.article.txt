goalie Danielle Rotondi, who saved
nine of the Cardinal's 24 shots on
goal. The Stanford defense
allowed a lone shot on goal.
Hartford head coach Austin
Daniels had nothing but praise for
the Cardinal defense, anchored by
Minstrell and Fischer.
"Stanford didn't allow us to
play as open a game as we're used
to," he said. "Collectively, this is
one of the best defensive teams
we've played in a few years."
The next day, Stanford met
Yale, 11-0 victors over American
University in its opener. The Ivy
League Elis proved no match for
their Pacific-10 Conference adver
sary, which scored early and often
en route to a 9-0 thrashing of Yale.
Martin needed only 63 seconds
to post all the offense the Cardinal
would need. Minstrell headed a
corner kick to Martin for the
assist. Eight minutes later, Martin
made a steal in the backfield and

fired in the upper left corner of the
Eli goal for a 2-0 lead.
Burt then notched the first hat
trick of her career with three con
secutive goals. At 11:38, she
stretched the margin to 3-0 on a
shot from the right side of the
penalty box. Twenty minutes later
she scored again, and then, less
than two minutes later, followed
with a shot deflecting off the Yale
defense.
Dey added a goal with under
four minutes to play in the first
half, and Fischer scored on a
penalty kick just before the break
for a 7-0 advantage.
The second half was quiet by
comparison. Sophomore forward
Mandy Tucker scored the second
goal of her career after a steal at
midfield in the 65th minute, and
Martin completed her third colle
giate hat trick on a penalty kick
with just over a minute remaining.
As for the defense, Stanford pre
vailed once again, as Yale managed
only five shots on goal.
For their outstanding perfor
mances, Murphy and Fischer were
named to Soccer America's nation
ill team of the week.
