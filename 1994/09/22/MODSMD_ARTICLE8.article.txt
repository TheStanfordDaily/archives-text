# 'A very unique man at a very unique time'
## The 						many sides of Walsh's genius 
### Colleen Krueger Editorial staff 
Under a stack of Economist magazines in
Stanford head football coach Bill Walsh's sunny
office lay a thick, red book on World War II
strategies. Across the room, a volume on promi
nent Civil War battles fit neatly on his well kept
desk.
"I read a lot of Civil War books — I'll read two
or three at a time of that era, or about Lincoln,"
Walsh said. "I'm a student of Abraham Lincoln....
I think he's our greatest American."
"He was a very unique man at a very unique
time," Walsh said, with a frank earnestness that
has silenced press conferences and locker rooms.
"He had incredible strength, and he was able to
manage people incredibly well. The factions that
he dealt with were so severe and so frenzied that it
would have been impossible for any other person
maybe to have ever done it."
Anyone familiar with Walsh's life and work can
understand his attraction to Lincoln.
Both men are admired as keen strategists, re
spected by their followers and their opposition
alike for sheer tactical brilliance. Both are hailed
as outspoken critics of their respective systems.
And both are remembered for a private side that
sharply contradicts their public personas — as re
luctant heroes often plauged by self-doubt and the
solitude of success.
It is this side of Walsh — the tactician, the gad
fly, the sensitive leader — that excuses the histor
ical audacity of comparing Stanford's football

Admired as much for his keen intellect as he Is for his strategic
coaching style, head football coach Bill Walsh discusses issues
in collegiate athletics in his Arrillaga Family Sports Center office.
coach to the former president.
Called "Genius" by his col
leagues, Walsh long ago distin
guished himself as much more than
a coach, largely because of his abili
ty to distance himself from the
close-knit athletic fraternity while
remaining squarely at its head.
Walsh spent two years as head
coach at Stanford before leaving to
coach the San Francisco 49ers in
1979, leading them to three Super
Bowls. After retiring from profes
sional football in 1989, Walsh sur
prised the sports world by return
ing to coach at Stanford in 1992.
Yet, for people who really under
stand his philosophy and the insti
tution's style, Stanford and Bill
Walsh are a natural pair, he said.
"I'm here at Stanford because I
truly believe in the scholar athlete,
and it doesn't exist elsewhere to
near the degree that it does here,"
Walsh said. "At this stage of my life
I would like to be a party to people's
educational experiences, and here I

can have much more of an impact
than I can in other schools."
For a man who quotes Joseph
Campbell easily and keeps company
with the likes of Nobel Prize winner
Dr. Glen Seaborg to simultaneously
hold the Professional Football Hall
of Fame's "Coach of the 80s" title
suggests an astounding sense of
personal balance and brilliance.
Perhaps this is what former Sec
retary of State George Shultz tried
to capture when he called Walsh
simply "a great intellect."
Walsh has blended his skills as a
sportsman, a businessman and an
academic to create a distinctive
coaching role for himself at Stan
ford — a role that casts him as mas
ter strategist, academic enforcer
and personal mentor to his team.
"I see my role here as being a
member basically of the educational
program ... a member of the facul
ty," he said.
Walsh has perhaps done more
than anyone to foster the academic
lives of athletes here at Stanford and
beyond, gaining national attention
as an outspoken advocate of an ath
lete's right — and responsibility —
to get a complete college education.
"Expecting progress toward

graduation, monitoring graduation
rates, and setting admissions stan
dards ... the NCAA and the college
presidents have taken a stand that
is in the best interest of the college
athlete," Walsh said.
Many were surprised that Walsh
chose coaching at Stanford —
where he could be crippled by high
admissions standards and a foot
ball program often overshadowed
by the school's overall prominence
— over ultimate power at a big
name football school. Walsh, how
ever, seems to thrive on the distinc
tion.
"A team can become the ulti
mate vehicle for the school, typical
ly a mistaken approach," Walsh
said. "The program should just be
one aspect of a complete university.
"You're striving for excellence,
but not to the extent that you sacri
fice your standards and your basic
conscience to have a team," he
added. "It's quite possible that you
could have the same team without
going to the degree of compromise
that some schools go to."
Often called upon to play pundit,
Walsh's views on hot issues in colle
giate sports often buck the main
stream; he tends to champion play

ers' rights and the sanctity of the
university setting against big money
or unethical coaching decisions.
"Some universities have to pro
vide a winning team no matter
what it takes," Walsh said. "And it's
not just administration and alums
— state legislators are involved, so
that shows you the extent to which
it builds."
Walsh worries these kind of pro
grams take advantage of young ath
letes, valuing sheer numbers so
highly that they leave "any number
of lost people strewn behind the
programs," he said.
Taking on powerful television
interests to look out for his players,
Walsh has also spoken out against
the idea of a college play-off system,
which would elongate the already
hectic fall football season.
"I don't like the idea of taking the
athletes from the classroom to the
extent that they're doing and justify
ing it for television money," he said
Although vehemently against
the idea of salaried college players,
Walsh said he thinks the only real
good that could come out of such a
playoff system is a fund providing
up to $150 a month on the basis of
financial need to the athletes, who

are forbidden to work by the terms
of their scholarships.
"For these huge, huge dollars to
be flowing into probably a group of
12 to 15 schools every year when
the athletes have what really is a
minimal scholarship I think is tak
ing full advantage of the athletes
themselves," Walsh said.
Standing up for his team has
not, however, made Walsh afraid to
stand up to his team. Last year,
when two of his players were arrest
ed for vandalizing a campus gay lib
eration statue, Walsh was one of
the first from the Athletic Depart
ment to denounce the act. Months
later he still reflects upon the inci
dent's impact on Stanford.
"People were upset, repulsed
and terribly offended, but it made
people stop and reflect," he said. "It
could very well have been a positive
action in a terribly negative act, as
people reminded themselves of the
need to be sensitive and under
standing of all"
While Walsh holds his players
accountable for the act, he said he
feels alcohol — which he calls "the
basis for all kinds of tragedy on
campuses" — had more to do with
their actions then personal bias.

"I don't think the young men
had the hate in their hearts people
have accused them of at all," he
said.
Now 63, in a position to appreci
ate the fruits of his phenomenally
successful career, Walsh said he still
"puts a lot of pressure on myself."
"I expect a lot of myself and my
stafT, and when ... we don't man
age the program as well as we could
that really upsets me," he said. "I'm
frustrated with those kind of things
when they occur."
Walsh candidly acknowledges
that he's essentially building Stan
ford's program for someone else.
"I'm not thinking of leaving but
when that occurs, I want this to be
very well orchestrated ... so that it
will sustain itself," he said. "My
guess is whoever replaces me will do
it as well or better than I can
because they'll be at the peak of
their career."
Yet, for many, Walsh's shoes
would be simply unfillable. Like his
hero Lincoln, no one else could be
what Bill Walsh has always been to
football and to America.
"I like to think what we're doing
here is unique, that being here for
me is unique," he said.
