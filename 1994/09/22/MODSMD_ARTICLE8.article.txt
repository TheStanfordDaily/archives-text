# 'A very unique man at a very unique time'

Under a stack of Economist magazines in
Stanford head football coach Bill Walsh's sunny
office lay a thick, red book on World War II
strategies. Across the room, a volume on promi

desk.
"I read a lot of Civil War books — I'll read two
or three at a time of that era, or about Lincoln,"
Walsh said. "I'm a student of Abraham Lincoln....
I think he's our greatest American."
"He was a very unique man at a very unique
time," Walsh said, with a frank earnestness that
has silenced press conferences and locker rooms.
"He had incredible strength, and he was able to
manage people incredibly well. The factions that
he dealt with were so severe and so frenzied that it
would have been impossible for any other person
maybe to have ever done it."
Anyone familiar with Walsh's life and work can
understand his attraction to Lincoln.
Both men are admired as keen strategists, re
spected by their followers and their opposition
alike for sheer tactical brilliance. Both are hailed
as outspoken critics of their respective systems.
And both are remembered for a private side that
sharply contradicts their public personas — as re
luctant heroes often plauged by self-doubt and the
solitude of success.

fly, the sensitive leader — that excuses the histor
ical audacity of comparing Stanford's football
