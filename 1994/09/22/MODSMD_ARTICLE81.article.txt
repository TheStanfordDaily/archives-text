### 
flick (flik) n. i. a light quick
stroke, as with a whip; sudden
jerky movement; 2. [Slang] a
movie; the showing of a movie

One of the first questions in Intro to Stan
ford 101 is "What is Flicks?" Well, Flicks is
a Stanford tradition as integral to life on
the Farm as fountain-hopping and bike accidents.
Run by the ASSU, Flicks screens feature films in
Memorial Auditorium each week at 7 p.m. and 10
p.m., along with cartoons and newsreels, frequent
ly hosts giveaways and the all-important pre
showing wadded paper wars.
Admission on Sundays is $3 at the door, but
most students opt to buy a quarterly pass. Fall
passes are $20, ($l9 when purchased from your
resident assistant) which is just over $1.50 per
movie. During business hours, passes are also
available at the Cardinal Collection or the Disc-

Connection, both in Tresidder, or at the tables out
side the first three Flicks.
A mix of dinosaurs and cowboys, Elle and
Andie, Keanu and Hugh, and, for inanimate object
fans, Kermit and Arnold, Flicks is presenting a
heck of a strong lineup this quarter.
Sacrificing eccentricity for popularity, Mem
Aud should be packed most weekends, so you'd
better get a season pass.
