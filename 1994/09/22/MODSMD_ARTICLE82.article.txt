# What's on this quarter's marquee
## 
### 
Jurassic Park, Oct. 2 — The season begins Oc
tober 2nd with one of the biggest money mak
ers ever. Veloptoraptors, stegosauruses and
the ever-popular T. Rex populate this Steven
Spielberg computer-animation onslaught.
Based on a mediocre book, the movie's plot is
even worse, but, what the hell, the special ef
fects are worth the price of admission.
Four Weddings and a Funeral, Oct. 9 — One
of the best movies of the summer, this modest
English romance hints at "When Harry Met
Sally." This consummate "chick flick" mixes
laughter with tears and leaves most college-age
singles with the same troubling question,
"What if lightning never strikes for me?"
Don't hold your breath — everything
you've heard about Stanford dating is true,
unfortunately.
Maverick, Oct. 16 — From "Unforgiven" to
"Wyatt Earp," Hollywood has gone full-force
in trying to revive the lost art of the western,
and "Maverick" is no exception. Mel Gibson,
Jodie Foster and James Garner come together
to rehash this old cowboy flick. Gibson stars as
the con-artist/gambler, forever trying to keep
his money clear of Foster. Garner plays the
stiff sheriff in this comedy which features
cameos by many country-western artists.
Reality Bites, Oct. 23 — The definitive Gen
eration-X anthem. Well, at least that's what

the filmmakers billed it as. Winona Ryder,
Ethan Hawke and Ben Stiller make this film a
male and female babefest, if not the voice of
our generation. But hey, you can't pass up a
flick that presents moral dilemmas in the con
text of working at The Gap, can you? So if your
Stanford reality bites, come take in a little es
cape from your pathetic life to view those of
others.
The Crow, Oct. 30 — Bruce Lee's son Bran
don stars in this film, based on the comic
strips of the same name. Look through the
city Lee patrols and one is reminded of the
horrific Gotham of Batman fame. This flick,
while visually impressive, has one flaw. Lee,
who has come back from the dead to revenge
the killing of his wife, is invulnerable. Thus,
there is little question of him actually losing
any of the multitude of fights he gets into. It is
still fun to watch blood spurt everywhere,
though.
If only the talented Lee had been quite as
indestructible as the title character...
Schindler's List, Nov. 6 — A film which won
just about everything at the Oscars last spring,
including "Best Director" and "Best Picture".
This true story of a World War II playboy-en
trepreneur whose business venture turns into
one of the most significant attempts to divert

Jews from concentration camps must be seen.
It may not be as good as some claim, but cer
tainly one of the most powerful movies of the
past several years.
The Muppet Movie, Nov. 13 — Kermit, Miss
Piggy and those two old guys in the booth star
in this take-off of the classic television show
that is now a classic movie itself. It's a film
about soul-searching, the power of friendship
and, of course, love that crosses the bound
aries of species. It's cool.
True Lies, Nov. 20 — Arnold, guns, planes,
nuclear explosions, Arnold, Tom Arnold,
Jamie Lee Curtis, Tia Carrere, Arnold, Arabs,
women, exploitation, Arnold, boom, bam,
splash, Arnold, comedy, action, violence,
money, Arnold, muscle, and, well, Arnold.
Sirens, Nov. 28 (Mon.) — Is it soft-core porn
or art? The debate has been heated (as well it
should be), but whether you're more interest
ed in a novel tale of artistry and sexual awak
ening or just seeing Elle MacPherson less
than-fully dressed, "Sirens" should not disap
point. Hugh Grant and Tara Fitzgerald also
star in this story of a clergyman and his wife
who are both challenged and enlightened
when they visit an Australian artist and his
models.

Speed, Dec. 4 — May as well sit on the edge of
your seat when you get to the movie, because
you'll be there for the next two hours. Neat
stunts performed by attractive people in un
likely circumstances, this movie could have
used a script writer, but what they saved in
writing they certainly spent on moving vehi
cles. Worth seeing, if just to stare at Keanu
Reeves/Sandra Bullock.
The Princess Bride, Dec. 11 — Hey, Fred,
great movie! Without question, this whole
some spoof of fairy tale romance is one of the
best children's movies ever made, but one that
appeals to adults as well. Who could forget the
sword fight scene or the preacher at the wed
ding who keeps saying "mawwaige"? Seen it 37
times, would love to see it again. The best
choice of the lot.
Take your dorm, take a soon-to-be signif
icant other (hey, at Stanford, Flicks counts as
a date) and take your newspaper-fight ammu
nition to the weekly affirmation that, yes,
even though Stanford is on the west coast, it is
an institution rich in long-standing tradi
tions.
So soak up a little (pop) culture, commune
with your classmates and sharpen that news
paper-throwing arm. Or more importantly,
come because you should never write CIV pa
pers on Sunday night when you have an excuse
to put them off until tomorrow.
