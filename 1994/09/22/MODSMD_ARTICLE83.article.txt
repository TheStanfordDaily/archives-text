# FRENTEI
## The 						band's audiences in Asia and love relationships are equally explosive 
### Janar Stewart 
From a hotel phone in sunny Seoul, Korea,
Frente! guitarist Simon Austin jump-starts
the interview by swiftly demolishing the
myth of passive Asian rock-concert audiences.
"We were told [by music bizzers supposedly
in the know) that Asian people don't react until
the end of the show," he says. Austin then de
scribes the Australian foursome's exuberant Tai
wanese fans dancing in the aisles and the more
raucous Filipino devotees tearing down the
venues.
"There were near riots in the Philippines. At
one point, we had to stop playing," he says, as if
mystified bv the whole affair.

Actually, once you've given Frente! 's latest re
lease, "marvin the album" a listen, you too will
wonder what drug the fans inhaled shortly before
the show.
If the verse-chorus-verse, easy listening tracks
off "marvin" and lead singer Angie Hart's
nymph-like, child-woman vocals give any indi
cation of how Frente! sounds live, it's hard to pic
ture the group inciting people to leave their seats,
let alone cause a commotion. Aside from Hart's
voice Frente! doesn't even have a consistent style
that could intensify a given mood.
This lack of a "Frente! style" may come from
the long and various list of inspirational artists
Austin cheerfully rattles off — Public Fnemy,
Kate Bush, Neneh Cherry, Cocteau Twins, the
Stranglers, any Motown group or singer and, yes,
the Carpenters.

"I like to like [the Carpenters] because it an
noys some of my friends," he says, laughing. He
then quickly adds in a more serious tone, "A lot
of people are too cool for their own good."
So cool that they label Frente! as sellouts for
breaking into the mainstream music scene. Of

course, taking advantage of the tremendous
boost that covering a popular song injects
into an obscure band's career doesn't win

points in critical circles.
"It's given us a start that we
wouldn't have had otherwise," Austin
says of "bizarre l ove Triangle," the
cover that fueled the group's jack-rab
bit, ocean-crossing success.
Like Lemonhead's frontman
Evan Dando, who riled up David
Letterman by announcing on na
tional television that he didn't want
to play "Mrs. Robinson" for"The
Late Show," Frente! has had second
and third thoughts about including that

cut on their album.
"I don't want to be known for just that song.
There's a point pretty soon where we're going to
stop playing it," Austin states firmly, yet for some
reason it comes across more like a New Year's
resolution than an edict.
Not to say Frente! 's originals cannot hold
their own. As the chart-topping success of
"Labour of Love" proved this summer, the group
has a knack for not only exposing emotional vul
nerability in their songs, but revealing the alu
minum shield of '90s cynicism that conceals
those insecurities — a topic to which many Gen
eration X-ers readily re-

late.
On the other
hand, there is really
no theme that ties
"marvin" together.
Thanks to the mem

bers' multiple in
fluences, the
band's only full
length album
contains several
very different
songs.
"Cuscut
lan" has a fla
menco guitar
intro and a
strong Latin

feel, "lonely" features heavy R&B gmoves com
plete with a Barry White spoof and "See/Believe"
swings with jazzy, finger-snapping vocals and a
walking bass line while the group's rendition of
"Bizarre Love Triangle" simply presents bare
bones, acoustic finger-picking.
Perhaps Frente! 's greatest songwriting gift —
that of illustrating sexual relationships and the trau
ma inevitably conceived by them — stems from
Austin's now-defunct love affair with Hart. "Ex
plode," co-written by Austin and Hart, literally de
picts the former couple's relationship, and the insis
tent tug of the old thin line between love and hate.

Since the two always co-write songs —
neither is eager to leap from the collaboration

nest — much of that tension
settles in between the lines
and stanzas.

Schizophrenic lyrics
in "Explode," "the worst
words explode/into love
in my ear" portray the
manic-depressive, on
off nature of a rela-

tionship on the road.
Austin describes it as
"just going from

ecstasy to
self-ha-

tred, having a million moods an hour."
On a more metaphorical level, the song sym
bolizes the hand's chemistry, according to
Austin.
"We fight a lot," he says. Sometimes the
dissension drives the hand members so far
apart, they can feel the hot breath of breakup
on the napes of their respective necks, Austin
adds.
During one of Frente! 's recent tours, tension
and stress spawned "L.onely," a song about draw
ing inward after a hurtful experience.
"(Hart] wrote that when having a break
down while on tour," Austin explains. As Hart's
honey-sweet vocals drip along a deep bass
groove, the words — "hate is half a heart/only I
am in my arms" — underscore the painful inter
nalization.
Yet, true to the nature of the band, "Lonely"
contains a bright side — a spunky guitar lick mo
mentarily bounces in after the second stanza then
reappears in the end along with Hart and Austin
mimicking R&B talkover and laughing at them
selves.
Although the Hart/Austin creations tend to
waver between opposing emotions, they still end
up as the strongest tracks on "marvin..
Obviously, their incendiary relationship
sparks something special when they sit down to
pen Frente! songs. Austin summarizes he and
1 lart's creative process as the two entering with
the same final goal, then bickering and arguing
until they eventually reach it.
"We always wanted to write songs that depicted
a sudden epiphany. We sort of worked backwards
from a feeling," he adds. "We like [the songs] to
have a lot of layers and that takes time."
Bassist Tim O'Connor, also a songwriter for
the band, handles the musical end.
1 )espite the group's stormy dynamics, though,

Austin says he
knew Frente!
could succeed
when they first
came together
five years ago.
"After a few
months it felt re
ally good," he
says.
Good enough
to start riots in
Asia. ■

Since the two always co-write songs —
neither is eager to leap from the collaboration

nest — much of that tension
settles in between the lines
and stanzas.

Schizophrenic lyrics
in "Explode," "the worst
words explode/into love
in my ear" portray the
manic-depressive, on
off nature of a rela-

tionship on the road.
Austin describes it as
"just going from

ecstasy to
self-ha-

tred, having a million moods an hour."
On a more metaphorical level, the song sym
bolizes the hand's chemistry, according to
Austin.
"We fight a lot," he says. Sometimes the
dissension drives the hand members so far
apart, they can feel the hot breath of breakup
on the napes of their respective necks, Austin
adds.
During one of Frente! 's recent tours, tension
and stress spawned "L.onely," a song about draw
ing inward after a hurtful experience.
"(Hart] wrote that when having a break
down while on tour," Austin explains. As Hart's
honey-sweet vocals drip along a deep bass
groove, the words — "hate is half a heart/only I
am in my arms" — underscore the painful inter
nalization.
Yet, true to the nature of the band, "Lonely"
contains a bright side — a spunky guitar lick mo
mentarily bounces in after the second stanza then
reappears in the end along with Hart and Austin
mimicking R&B talkover and laughing at them
selves.
Although the Hart/Austin creations tend to
waver between opposing emotions, they still end
up as the strongest tracks on "marvin..
Obviously, their incendiary relationship
sparks something special when they sit down to
pen Frente! songs. Austin summarizes he and
1 lart's creative process as the two entering with
the same final goal, then bickering and arguing
until they eventually reach it.
"We always wanted to write songs that depicted
a sudden epiphany. We sort of worked backwards
from a feeling," he adds. "We like [the songs] to
have a lot of layers and that takes time."
Bassist Tim O'Connor, also a songwriter for
the band, handles the musical end.

Austin says he

could succeed
when they first
came together
five years ago.
"After a few
months it felt re

says.

From a hotel phone in sunny Seoul, Korea,
Frente! guitarist Simon Austin jump-starts
the interview by swiftly demolishing the
myth of passive Asian rock-concert audiences.
"We were told [by music bizzers supposedly
in the know) that Asian people don't react until
the end of the show," he says. Austin then de
scribes the Australian foursome's exuberant Tai
wanese fans dancing in the aisles and the more
raucous Filipino devotees tearing down the
venues.
"There were near riots in the Philippines. At
one point, we had to stop playing," he says, as if
mystified bv the whole affair.

Actually, once you've given Frente! 's latest re
lease, "marvin the album" a listen, you too will
wonder what drug the fans inhaled shortly before
the show.
If the verse-chorus-verse, easy listening tracks
off "marvin" and lead singer Angie Hart's
nymph-like, child-woman vocals give any indi
cation of how Frente! sounds live, it's hard to pic
ture the group inciting people to leave their seats,
let alone cause a commotion. Aside from Hart's
voice Frente! doesn't even have a consistent style
that could intensify a given mood.
This lack of a "Frente! style" may come from
the long and various list of inspirational artists
Austin cheerfully rattles off — Public Fnemy,
Kate Bush, Neneh Cherry, Cocteau Twins, the
Stranglers, any Motown group or singer and, yes,
the Carpenters.

"I like to like [the Carpenters] because it an
noys some of my friends," he says, laughing. He
then quickly adds in a more serious tone, "A lot
of people are too cool for their own good."
So cool that they label Frente! as sellouts for
breaking into the mainstream music scene. Of

course, taking advantage of the tremendous
boost that covering a popular song injects
into an obscure band's career doesn't win

points in critical circles.
"It's given us a start that we
wouldn't have had otherwise," Austin
says of "bizarre l ove Triangle," the
cover that fueled the group's jack-rab
bit, ocean-crossing success.
Like Lemonhead's frontman
Evan Dando, who riled up David
Letterman by announcing on na
tional television that he didn't want
to play "Mrs. Robinson" for"The
Late Show," Frente! has had second
and third thoughts about including that

cut on their album.
"I don't want to be known for just that song.
There's a point pretty soon where we're going to
stop playing it," Austin states firmly, yet for some
reason it comes across more like a New Year's
resolution than an edict.
Not to say Frente! 's originals cannot hold
their own. As the chart-topping success of
"Labour of Love" proved this summer, the group
has a knack for not only exposing emotional vul
nerability in their songs, but revealing the alu
minum shield of '90s cynicism that conceals
those insecurities — a topic to which many Gen
eration X-ers readily re-

late.
On the other
hand, there is really
no theme that ties
"marvin" together.
Thanks to the mem

bers' multiple in
fluences, the
band's only full
length album
contains several
very different
songs.
"Cuscut
lan" has a fla
menco guitar
intro and a
strong Latin

feel, "lonely" features heavy R&B gmoves com
plete with a Barry White spoof and "See/Believe"
swings with jazzy, finger-snapping vocals and a
walking bass line while the group's rendition of
"Bizarre Love Triangle" simply presents bare
bones, acoustic finger-picking.
Perhaps Frente! 's greatest songwriting gift —
that of illustrating sexual relationships and the trau
ma inevitably conceived by them — stems from
Austin's now-defunct love affair with Hart. "Ex
plode," co-written by Austin and Hart, literally de
picts the former couple's relationship, and the insis
tent tug of the old thin line between love and hate.
