# Babylon boasts bawdy boisterous buffoonery
## 
### Linda Friedlieb 
When the hats are larger than the per
formers, it can only be the wonderful,
zany, more than slightly off-kilter
humor of Steve Silver's "Beach Blanket Baby
lon."
"Babylon" is a world where large green
shrubbery with an enormous string of pearls
and an "Unemployed" sign hanging from her
back dances onto the stage, and"The Lady is a
Trump"— Ivana, in this case.
Producer, director, writer and designer Sil
ver's irreverent view of pop culture comes
through from the first scene (when the good
witch from"The Wizard of Oz" accuses de
mure Snow White of being a witch) to the last
(when the cast, costumed as everyone from
Elvis to Cher, sing a rousing round of "Happy
Trails").
Perhaps the most amazing thing about
"Babylon" is that it remains as irreverent and as
relevant today as it was when it was created
more than 20 years ago. The oft-changing cast
and skits keep the show fresh, as it softly pokes
fun at the full range of pop icons.
The current spectacle mocks individuals
from all walks of fame, from a saxophone-play
ing President Clinton to ice divas called Tonya
Harding and Nancy Kerrigan.
The most glaring weakness of the show is
that it lacks a plot. The premise that Snow
White goes 'round the world to find her true
love and just meets a lot of weirdos is a little
limited.
On the other hand, it's held up through a lot
of years. And often the need for a plot is over
rated.
The incredible costumes (especially the
hats) definitely make up for this almost-unno
ticed shortcoming. Housed in North Beach's
Club Fugazi, the only thing limiting the size of
the outrageous headgear are the walls and ceil
ing of the small theater.
Actually, the hats are the limiting factor, as
they sometimes prevent those on stage from
achieving full mobility.
Eyes remain glued to the large pizza dancing
around the stage while Snow White visits Italy

and the overflowing trash can
balancing on the heroine's

head as she performs a
can-can in "Gay Paris."

The stereotypes
the show constantly /

plays with would
be offensive any-

where but
"Babylon."

When a
prostitute tells
Snow White

to head to
the nearest
bar, "a Bar
M itzvah,"
she meets a
Jewish
mother
with an

enormous
(bleached)
blond coif
fure and a
dress with
enough se

quins to blind '
innocent view
ers. Those with
and without their
own Jewish mothei
have to let the fur
bone kick into low j
And when the g,
Louis of France per
rousing version

School Dropout" while trying to
explain to the unbelievably
>V naive Snow White why he

can't be her prince, the
only option is laugh
k ter.

Only those
completely lack
ing a sense of

humor would
be offended.
The dy
namic work
of Christina
Van Valk
enberg who
recently
stepped
into the
pivotal role
of Snow
White aptly
[ demon
strates the

cast's power
ful voices and
strong sense of
timing.
Even the

understudies
(many of whom
>erform during
nday matinees) are
e than worth
ng. Ledisi Young,
is into parodies of
African-American

women as Whoopi Goldberg and Tina Turner,
goes nice and easy while "Rolling Down the
River."
While the cast lacks the big name power
houses (Liza Minelli, Tommy Tune) who have
sometimes graced the spoof-dom called "Baby
lon" in past years, the current ensemble never
misses a beat.
They get the audience focused on the humor
of the parody rather than their own perfor
mances. They inspire the audience to sing and
clap along to various universally known tunes
such as "Shout," led by Oprah Winfrey (who's
gained more than a little weight since her last
diet).
Much of the humor emphasizes sexuality.
Twenty-one and older is the rule for evening
shows where drinks are served, identification is
checked at the door, and certain explicit
pranks prevail.
The bawdy nature of the humor is only slight
ly toned down for the matinee performances,
where the active imagination can easily replace
those small graphic details which are removed
for the modest, supposedly innocent eyes.
But the sexual nature is nothing compared
to some of the decidedly distinctive twists of
character.

Any show featur
ing both Snow
White and Madon
na raises serious
questions about
good taste, but when
the former suddenly
morphs into the lat
ter, the change has
more than a little
potential to disturb.
The only thing
more frightening is
who turns out to be
Snow White's Prince
Charming....
And that's a dis
covery to be made
on your own. ■
