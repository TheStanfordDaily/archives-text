# San Francisco stories
## Stanford students introduce the City's lesser-known points of artistic interest 
### 
Our story begins in the small, poorly-lit
editorial office of Intermission, over
run with press releases announcing
the kinds of entertainment happenings that
no students in their right minds would even
bother considering.
This week, the true test of the editors' in
genuity looms over them like a moose head
hung over a fireplace mantle. They are called
upon to conceive a cover story that urges the
Farm's newest inhabitants, while at Stanford,
to experience all the Bay Area — particularly
San Francisco — has to offer, and to do so as
non-traditionally as possible.
But that's easier said than done. The City
often short changes those (mainly tourists)
who try to experience too much at once. A
trip to San Francisco is best enjoyed in small
bites, sort of like a favorite meal after a year of
Food Service.
And then the answer to the Sphinx's riddle
hits them like a phone call from a well-mean
ing, ex-Intermission editor
"Let's put together a small but eclectic
group of Stanford graduate and undergradu
ate students who, in one way or another, are
plugged into one of the most complete arts

and entertainment scenes anywhere — San
Francisco. Let's ask them where they go when
they hang out in the City."
Pleased with the idea, the Intermission ed
itors waste no time assigning a writer, who,
after a few false starts, connects with junior
Darnell Brooks, host of an up-and-coming
hip-hop show at Stanford's radio station,
KZSU; Julia Gonzalez Luna, a graduate stu
dent in the Stanford Teacher Education Pro
gram (STEP) and artist; and May Mantell, a
photographer in the art graduate program.
And so, with as little fanfare and fuss as
possible, the writer, his photographer and
their three guides head to The City for a night
and day in the San Francisco most tourists
miss...

Act One: Friday night, Sept. 16.
Hip-hop storms the Palace
It's just after nine o'clock on Highway 101
and though the flickering headlights of
other cars are noticeable on all sides, the
road directly in front of junior Darnell
Brook's own vehicle is pretty dark.

Darnell, a junior majoring in music engi
neering technology, tries to come up to The
City a couple of times per week, usually mix
ing business (promoting his hip-hop radio
show, "Soul Patrol" on KZSU and mobile
deejay service B-Side Productions) with plea
sure (catching any hip-hop shows he can get

into, checking out the City's diverse club
scene or just plain exploring places he's not
very familiar with).
The night does not impede our progress
along the highway or disturb the mood inside
the car. Neither of us have fully recovered
from a fit of laughter brought on by Darnell's
recollection of the time a local rapper I went
to high school with took him to hang out with
a dominatrix that lived in his building.
"There was a girl who lived in [the rap
per's] building named Andrea or something,
who's a film student. So Corey tells me, 'Let's
go see this girl because she's supposed to help
us shoot a [music] video and I want you to be
in it.' So I was like, cool.
"So, we go see her, knock on her door, and
you know, she looks like some random babe
... she's cool whatever, nice. So I sat down at
the table and was checking her place 0ut....
"Then all of a sudden I notice that she
had three telephone lines set up all at the
same table. And then telephone calls start
comin' in dude, and she's making appoint
ments with people to come in and get beat.
And we ask her 'Is this business or do you
enjoy it?'
"And she says, 'Ah shit, I like beating peo
ple.' And I was like, all, man."
But the night didn't belong to S&M, it be
longed to hip-hop. And that's what we came
up to see. Our destination was a small club
known as the Crash Palace (628 Divisadero at
Grove). We were going to see Del the Funky
Homosapien, Pep Love and Jay Biz and Mys
tik Journeymen (of which the rapper with the
dominatrix friend is a member).
"I didn't start coming up here a lot until
November, December of last year. Man, to
tell you the truth, I didn't like The City," Dar
nell confides. "All the houses were stacked to
gether, all the hills and one-way streets... I'd
always see grungy people all over the place. I
was like, 'Man, ftick San Francisco.'
"But then the more I found out about it I

figured
out that
this was
the place I
needed to
be. So I
like it
now."

a I like
[the City]
because
there are a
lot of
weird
people up
there to
tell you
the

truth,"
Darnell explains. "I like to see different shit,
you know. Some people are uncomfortable
with it, but it never bothers me."
To illustrate his point, he tells me of his ex
cursions to the modern-rock club the Palladi
um (Kearney near Broadway). "Every time I
come up, I stop there. I just check it out 'cause
it stays open till six in the morning and even
though it costs $ 10, you can go in and out, and
nobody trips."

'There aren 't any
color lines in The
City. It's not just
blacks or whites, it's
all people who are
just into the music.'
— Darnell Brooks

Taking the Seventh Street exit down
town, we decided to go the long way to
the Crash Palace: along Van Ness to
Geary, up Geary to Fillmore, down Fillmore
to Fell, then around to Divisadero where,
predictably, there isn't decent parking within
a one block radius of the club.
No matter, by the time we arrive, we real
ize we aren't as fashionably late as we
thought. Along the way Darnell explains the

desirability of San Francisco hip-hop club
spots over other places around the Bay Area.
"It's a whole different atmosphere that's
almost always trouble-free," he explains.
He also cites the fact that at the clubs in
The City, he's found the crowds to be unified
in their love for hip-hop. "There aren't any
color lines in The City. It's not just blacks or
whites, it's all people who are just into the
music."
As we approach the Crash Palace on foot it
becomes clear that Darnell's comment is re
markably appropriate. Out front a multi
racial crowd mills about, all but covering the
iconic diva that presides over the club from
the mural painted on the building's store
front.
The next day when we came by to take a
few pictures, I was surprised to find that the
image runs along the entire length of the
building.
The night of show, some try unsuccessful
ly to gain free admission, while others hope to
cash in on the friendship they claim to share
with Del, Pep Love and Jay-Biz or the Mystik
Journeymen. It wouldn't be a true hip-hop
show if half the audience didn't try to get in
for free. Darnell and I participate too. He's
supposed to be on KZSU's list, but the securi
ty at the door doesn't see his name...
It also wouldn't be a hip-hop show if half
the people with legitimate guest-list claims
didn't get in. It goes with the territory. Only
tonight, we're both realizing that we could
have dressed more warmly.
Forty minutes later when we're beginning
to seriously entertain the idea of paying to get
in, the first wave of rappers on the night's bill
arrives. They sidle up to the Palace noncha
lantly, the only thing distinguishing them
from the hip-hop heads there to see them is
the fact that they shake more hands.
We finally make it inside around 11 p.m.,
just in time to catch the night's main attrac
tions. The Mystik Journeymen are up first
followed by Pep Love and Jay-Biz. Pep's and
Biz's homey, Del (the first of the Oakland
based rap collective known as the Hiero
glyphics to make his mark on an unsuspecting
rap world), does clean-up tonight as the main
attraction.
Each performance is solid, but the evening
most definitely belongs to the Mystik Jour
neymen whose 30-minute set pushes the lim
its of live performance. None of the acts we
see that night are older than 25.
Only in San Francisco.
Act Two: Saturday morning, Sept. 17
Murals, cheap food and
domantrixes (again)
This morning, I find myself in a light-blue
Hyundai racing along Interstate 280, a high
way I've always thought of as a back door into
The City. Graduate student Julia Gonzalez
Luna, the driver, prefers the picturesque
quality of the winding road through the hills
to the directness of the unforgivingly urban
artery to the east of us, 101.
The route is slightly longer than that of the
night before, but it gives us a chance to ease
into an interesting conversation about her
experiences thus far as a new graduate stu
dent in the Stanford Teacher Education Pro
gram.
It's a rigorous program that mixes class
room theory with practical experience. This
semester, Julia is teaching history at Sequoia
High School in Redwood City to a class of
Latino juniors with limited English proficien
cy. In less than seven days she and her 23-stu

dents have managed to facilitate a learning
environment where "everybody gets along
and respects each other — most of the time."
A Chicana artist in her own right, Julia
works in everything from pencil to water col
ors to chalk.
Once in The City, Julia heads for the Mis
sion district, a cultural stronghold for peoples
of all colors, but specifically Chicano and
Latino. The Mission is also known for the
mural art that decorates many of the walls of
local businesses, churches and homes.
Though it might appear that Julia just fell
out of bed with the God-given ability of
teaching, it's actu-

ally something
that she's been
cultivating since
at least her sopho
more year, partic
ipating in a variety
of different com
munity* and cam
pus-based pro
grams tutorial,
after school and
summer pro
grams.
Our first offi
cial stop is Julia's
adopted second
home, Galeria de
la Raza at 24th and
Bryant Avenue.
The gallery, start
ed about 25 years
ago, is a major pro-
a r

ponent for the presentation of Chicano and
Latino artists of both yesterday and today and
is dedicated to providing a venue for "commu
nity activism and cultural affirmation."
Her last teaching, she tells me, was also
connected to the STEP program. "In the sum
mer, we all taught at a summer school. There
were seven teachers in one class and about 11
students. It was hard because I had to get up a
6:30 a.m., be to school by about 7:45 a.m.,
teach until noon. Then I had to be in class by

one — and I normally had about two or three
classes a day. So I wouldn't get home until
about 7 p.m. It was definitely hard."
Julia currently participates in Galeria's
"(Re)Generation Project," a community
based education program developed to help
make the visual presentation of Chicano art
more accessible to both artist and appreciator.
After examining Galeria's current exhibit,
a collection of works by pre-Chicano Art
movement artists born in the 1930's who ex
hibited during the 1950'5, we moved next
door to Studio 24, Galeria's folk-art annex,
where one can purchase traditional Mexican

and Chicano folk art as well as posters and
prints of Mexican, Chicano and Latino artists.
But its also a place to hang, Julia explains.
She points to a section of the store near its en
trance and informs me that she often times
"hangs out here with my close friends and
drink beer."
As we walk around the streets close to Gale
ria exploring the artwork that literally papers
the walls of many buildings, we munch on
Mexican sweet bread. The murals and smaller

works we see celebrate a culture
more frequently than not pushed to
the bottom of the American melting
pot. Its a celebration of an indige
nous heritage that our schools nor
mally suggest we forget.
Across the way we meet a group of
Chicano muralists our own age.
The subject of their City-sponsored
mural is community heroes both
local and otherwise. On the white
washed wall of a laundromat lies
paintings of everyone from the
great Mexican artist Frida Kahlo to
South African President Nelson
Mandela to Malcolm X, in various
stages of completion.
While one artist works on a guitar
pictured in a mariachi band portrait,
several of his peers discuss their frus
tration over the fact that the laun
dromat's owner is upset that they've
spilled paint on the pavement.
"Personally, I think it adds to the
overall experience," one of them
tells me before going to work on an
other piece of the mural.
Before heading off to the San
Francisco Art Institute, where we're
supposed to connect with May
Mantell, a photographer in Stan
ford's MFA program, we stop by the
Women's Building (354118 th Street),


rhis mural that extends along an entire exterior wall of The Crash Palace will be covered by hordes of hip-hop fans come evening .
