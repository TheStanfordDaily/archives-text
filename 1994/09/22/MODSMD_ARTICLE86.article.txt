# When you're not studying...
## ... check out these Stanford diversions 
### Linda Friedlieb 
You came to Stanford for the academics, for
the weather, for the prestige, maybe even for
the football team (just maybe). But there's
more to life on the Farm than sunshine, study
ing and sports.
For those who have an ultra-fuzzy bent or
just an appreciation for things deemed artistic,
there's a plethora of on-campus amusements to
occupy the time that might be more produc
tively spent reading Aristotle.
Your first taste of Stanford's arts might come
during Orientation when a group of people pop
into your first house meeting (they're usually
several hours long) and sing a few songs a cap
pella. Many groups (both single-sex and mixed)
spread their own brand of music — and humor
— in scheduled shows and dorm visits through
out the year.
From the religious tone of Testimony to the
international flavor of Talisman to the tradition
of the Mendicants, Stanford's first a cappella
phenomenon, these baritones, altos and sopra
nos provide many needed study breaks.
But if you're not into high-voltage group
sings, crooners abound at the Coffee House,
where melodies can make your cappuccino go
down smoothly. Also the CoHo is a good place
to catch some of Stanford's many student
bands, which also frequent on-campus parties

and sometimes show up in White Plaza for
open-air entertainment.
In addition, the Stanford Concert Network
arranges and subsidizes many concerts (last
year's headliner was They Might Be Giants)
throughout the year. This year, acoustic gui
tarist/singer Michael Hedges kicks off the sea
son on Oct. 1.
For music sans lyrics, the Stanford Sym
phonic Orchestra and the Leland Stanford Ju
nior (pause) University Marching Band provide
two extremely different sounds.
While the Band is likely to pop up playing
Stanford fight song "All Right Now" in its cus
tomary disorderly fashion, the symphony
schedules regular concerts complete with varied
programs of classical works.
In addition, the Lively Arts at Stanford
brings entertainment in all forms to campus life.
Anticipated performances include the mix of
classical and contemporary Japanese music of
Pro Musica Nipponia (Oct. 19) and the Tony-
Award winning National Theater of the Deaf
performing "An Italian Straw Hat" (Oct. 29).
Upcoming dance performances include
Spring Migration, an annual extravaganza
choreographed and performed by students. In
addition, Stanford boasts numerous cultural
dance troupes including the skirts and som
breros of El Ballet Folklorico de Stanford and
Kuumba Dance Ensemble, a group which spe
cializes in African and African-American dance

traditions.
Some interactive
annual traditions in
clude the Ragtime
Ball for those who
love to swing and the
Viennese Ball for
waltzing fools. Re
quired equipment
for the latter event in
cludes a sleeping bag,
as students often
times camp out to in
sure themselves tick
ets.
Yet another on
campus diversion is
the Mausoleum
party which is held
(you guessed it) at
the Stanford Mau
soleum on Hal
loween each year.
Crazy costumes,
music and dancing
abound. Go to see
and be seen.
Several organiza
tions stage plays and
musicals for those
who just want to
watch. Ram's Head,
a student-run orga
nization, produces
three of Stanford's
annual entertain
ment institutions —
Big Game Gaieties
in November, Win
ter One Acts during
winter quarter and

the spring musical, which in 1995 will be "Once
on lliis Island."
Ram's Head executive director Jeff Meador
said, as always, freshmen are encouraged to par
ticipate in the shows as actors, musicians or
members of the technical crew and staff Audi
tions for Gaieties will be held in early October,
and offer Stanford newcomers a chance to begin
their dramatic careers.
In addition to Ram's Head, the Drama De
partment stages several plays this year, giving its
acting and technical students a chance to strut
their stuff.
Other dramatic (and comedic) perfor
mances throughout the year will come from the
Women's Performance Collective and the Stan

ford Savoyards who stage Gilbert-and-Sullivan
works.
The Savoyards will perform "The Pirates of
Penzance" in November and will hold auditions
for the cast next week.
Less-structured theater is also presented at
Stanford by improv groups. Spontaneous Gener
ation (Sponge) and the Stanford Improvisers
(Simps) each provoke lots of laughter with their
skits and games. Be prepared to become part of
the act by yelling out suggestions and getting in
volved in games; participation is more than half
the fun.
For whatever reason you chose Stanford,
take advantage of more than just your profes
sors. Every once in a while, forget studying and
entertain yourself instead. ■

year's headliner was They Might Be Giants)
throughout the year. This year, acoustic gui
tarist/singer Michael Hedges kicks off the sea
son on Oct. 1.
For music sans lyrics, the Stanford Sym
phonic Orchestra and the Leland Stanford Ju
nior (pause) University Marching Band provide
two extremely different sounds.
While the Band is likely to pop up playing
Stanford fight song "All Right Now" in its cus
tomary disorderly fashion, the symphony
schedules regular concerts complete with varied
programs of classical works.
In addition, the Lively Arts at Stanford
brings entertainment in all forms to campus life.
Anticipated performances include the mix of
classical and contemporary Japanese music of
Pro Musica Nipponia (Oct. 19) and the Tony-
Award winning National Theater of the Deaf
performing "An Italian Straw Hat" (Oct. 29).
Upcoming dance performances include
Spring Migration, an annual extravaganza
choreographed and performed by students. In
addition, Stanford boasts numerous cultural
dance troupes including the skirts and som
breros of El Ballet Folklorico de Stanford and
Kuumba Dance Ensemble, a group which spe
cializes in African and African-American dance

traditions.
Some interactive
annual traditions in
clude the Ragtime
Ball for those who
love to swing and the
Viennese Ball for
waltzing fools. Re
quired equipment
for the latter event in
cludes a sleeping bag,
as students often
times camp out to in
sure themselves tick
ets.
Yet another on
campus diversion is
the Mausoleum
party which is held
(you guessed it) at
the Stanford Mau
soleum on Hal
loween each year.
Crazy costumes,
music and dancing
abound. Go to see
and be seen.
Several organiza
tions stage plays and
musicals for those
who just want to
watch. Ram's Head,
a student-run orga
nization, produces
three of Stanford's
annual entertain
ment institutions —
Big Game Gaieties
in November, Win
ter One Acts during
winter quarter and

the spring musical, which in 1995 will be "Once
on lliis Island."
Ram's Head executive director Jeff Meador
said, as always, freshmen are encouraged to par
ticipate in the shows as actors, musicians or
members of the technical crew and staff Audi
tions for Gaieties will be held in early October,
and offer Stanford newcomers a chance to begin
their dramatic careers.
In addition to Ram's Head, the Drama De
partment stages several plays this year, giving its
acting and technical students a chance to strut
their stuff.
Other dramatic (and comedic) perfor
mances throughout the year will come from the
Women's Performance Collective and the Stan

ford Savoyards who stage Gilbert-and-Sullivan
works.
The Savoyards will perform "The Pirates of
Penzance" in November and will hold auditions
for the cast next week.
Less-structured theater is also presented at
Stanford by improv groups. Spontaneous Gener
ation (Sponge) and the Stanford Improvisers
(Simps) each provoke lots of laughter with their
skits and games. Be prepared to become part of
the act by yelling out suggestions and getting in
volved in games; participation is more than half
the fun.
For whatever reason you chose Stanford,
take advantage of more than just your profes
sors. Every once in a while, forget studying and
entertain yourself instead. ■
