## 'Zoe' spells quick death in independent film world screens 
### 
In independent filmmaking, execution is everything. A story
must be compelling and its characters must sell us on investing
our hard-earned emotions wholeheartedly in the song and
dance that is their story.
That's why Quentin Tarantino ("Reservoir Dogs") has taken
Hollywood and the rest of us by storm. All he needs is a pen, a pad
and a decent camera to rivet us for 90 minutes.
Unfortunately, it is unlikely anyone who sits through "Killing
Zoe" will have anything half as nice to say about Tarantino's writ
ing partner, Roger Avery. "Zoe," both written and directed by
Avery for October Films, proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that

Killing Zoe

to make a movie you only need to know the right people and hang
with the right crowd. To make a good movie, however, takes some
measure of talent. Talent that from all accounts Avery hasn't
shown.
The scenario is simple and pointless — rather like a "Beavis and
Butt-head" short, only not as funny. A down and out safe-cracker,
Zed (Eric Stolz) gets invited to France by a childhood friend, Eric
(Jean-Hughes Anglade), to pop acid and rob a bank. Back in the
good ol' days, the two used to knock-over mini-marts in Florida
(Eric's parents — one living in France, the other in the states —
had joint custody, you see).
His first day there, Zed falls for a typically French bombshell,
Zoe (Julie Delpy) who works as a prostitute to support herself
through art school. "I make things that matter," she tells Zed after
a poorly conceived love scene. But we're not given much time to
dwell on Avery's ineptness, for in comes Eric who's annoyed that
his long lost friend has spent the better part of the day lounging
with a girl he could catch AIDS from.
But Eric's fun isn't much safer. He whisks Zed off to the small
dive he and his six accomplices call home, tells him of his poorly
sketched plan to rob the bank and then, only after making sure
Zed's high enough, drags the entire crew out for a night at a smoky
little evening affair where a band with no rhythm plays rag. Don't
worry, Avery's camera moves more or less match the frenzied en
ergy of his story.
I must emphasize, however, that his accomplishment isn't
something to be proud of. Remember the ghoul rides we all en
joyed as kids at the county fair? The ones that perfectly distill what
it feels like to be the passenger in a car owned by a person just
learning to drive a stick shift?

In between the lurches and lunges, another gruesome image
goes "boo" and we scream with a mixture of fright and pleasure.
Avery's jumbled vision is almost identical, only all of the edges
have been softened to make us feel Zed's trip. But if Zed isn't en
joying his trip, how are we supposed to?
That's the whole problem with "Killing Zoe." So much of the
film is devoted to making us feel that Zed's trip to Paris is a bad
one. But it's a trip that we don't want to take because in his haste
to make us all feel as terrible as his characters look, Avery forgets
that we need a reason to care in the first place.
Guessing how the story will end becomes the entertainment.
Does the robbery go bad? Terribly. Are Eric and Zed forced to
duke-it-out to the death in the end? Yep. Does Zed win? Well, he
is the Boy Scout on this mission. You figure it out.

About the only thing worth mention
ing about "Zoe" is the talent connected
to it. Stolz, a veteran of independent
gems like "The Waterdance" and
Anglade ("La Femme Nikita") always
have a trick or two up their sleeves even
when the characters they play are de
serted by their stories.
Anglade in particular is compelling as
the villain. Even if being young, HlV
positive and having nothing to lose may
not be something you're used to seeing
in today's art-house entertainment,
count on seeing better interpretations
of it in the future.
Incidentally, killing Zoe has nothing to
do with "Killing Zoe."
That's Avery's best gag by far.
