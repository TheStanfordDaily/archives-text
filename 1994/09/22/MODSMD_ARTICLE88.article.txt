## 'Quiz Show' offers a critical look at American media 
### 
"Marty."
The answer to the question that was too easy for Herbie Stem
pel to miss. Everyone knew that "Marty" won the Academy
Award in 1955. In feet, everyone in Robert Redford's latest film
effort, "Quiz Show," knew the answer but StempeL
Following in the footsteps of Oliver Stone's "Natural Born
Killers," "Quiz Show" examines the power of the media. While
"Quiz Show" doesn't rally the American public behind vicious
mass-murderers, it does rap the knuckles of the manipulative
hands of network television executives.
The film recreates many of the actual events that entwined the
lives of Stempel (John Turturro), Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fi

ennes) and Richard Goodwin (Rob Morrow) in the late 1950'5.
"Twenty-One," NBC's weekly quiz show, was investigated in
1959 by a grand jury for fraud, after which its findings were sealed
by a judge. Goodwin, intrigued by this, began his own investigation
for the Congressional Subcommittee on Legislative Oversight,
hoping to expose the ways in which networks deceived the public
The film attempts to focus on the behind-the-scenes manip
ulation of "Twenty-One" 's producer Dan Enright (David
Paymer). Enright, driven by the power of advertising dollars and
the need to compete with other shows, gives millions of people a
"friend" in Van Doren, someone they can watch and cheer along
with in their own homes.

This theme, however, is greatly overshadowed by the person
al conflicts which arise. The struggle to admit his cheating on the
show to himself as well as to the public grips Van Doren, an Eng
lish professor at Columbia University and the product of one of
America's most renowned literary families.
The ethics of his actions weigh heavily on Van Doren's mind,
even as he enjoys the fast life of money and fame. Finally, out of
the shadow of his Pulitzer Prize-winning father, Charles takes all
that NBC offers him — only to lose much more.
Goodwin also struggles in his own mind with the morality of
taking the information he gathers and using it to bring down a
fellow man. The performance by Morrow (of "Northern Expo
sure" fame) provides a look into the heart of someone who un
covered just what he was digging for, only to find his conscience
there as well.
While the personal themes run stronger, the movie does offer
the intrigue of scandal. Do you know if your favorite contestant
on a trivia show really knows the obscure facts they rattle off in
front of the television cameras?
Remember to state your answer in the form of a question.
