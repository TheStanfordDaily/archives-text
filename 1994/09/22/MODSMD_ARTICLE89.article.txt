# Laughter and music-filled 'Priscilla' is no drag
## 
### 
Imagine a man in his mid-twenties exquisitely
decked out in a long, flowing gown complemented by
heels, layers of make-up and a 30 foot train.
Seat him on top of a giant, sparkling high-heel
stage prop perched atop a metallic pink bus. Now pic
ture the whole scene in the Australian outback.
This improbable, yet hilarious situation is the
premise of "The Adventures of Priscilla Queen ofthe
Desert," an Australian film following the travels of
three Sydney drag queens to Alice Springs, a resort
near the center of

the country.
Known as the
best ABBA per
formers in Syd
ney's gay district,
it's obvious the

queens live for the
limelight, lip-synching tacky seventies songs. After
christening their bus Priscilla, they set out laden with
trunks of costumes, props, and make-up to a booking
in remote Alice Springs.
The majority of the queens' waking hours are one
long, showy production. When they break out into
song and dance for audiences along the way, their act
draws the gamut of reactions from dumbstruck to
hostile to enthusiastic.
All three main actors offer easily believable portray
als, the strongest of which comes from Terence Stamp
("Wall Street," "Young Guns") as the gracefully weath
ered Bernadette. The wary traveler at the outset of the
trip, the only transsexual of the trio ends her journey
early upon finding a potential love in the form of a

Priscilla
Queen ofthe Desert

small-town dweller.
The costumes, hoopla and pseudo-glitz of their
stage shows provide the film's most hilarious mo
ments. Unfortunately, there are just too many of
them. After the first hour, the initial action dwindles
and the movie starts to (pardon the pun) drag.
Under the gobs of eye shadow, writer/director
Stephan Elliott exposes the hardships these social out
casts endure as well as the hardness, and at times,
emptiness of their lives. Much of the plot centers on
Mitzi's (Hugo

Weaving) struggle to
come to terms with
his past traditional
lifestyle and to find a
spot in his "alterna
tive" life for his son.
Another vivid

message arises through Bernadette's childhood flash
backs. Her/his sexual orientation was well in place,
inherent one is led to believe, as he changes the names
on the Christmas tags and winds up with his sister's
doll instead of the truck meant for him.
A film doused with glamour, sprinkled with wit
and wrapped in lightness, "Priscilla" adeptly shows
off the outwardly proud and sensational exterior of
the life of a drag queen.
However, what is most memorable about the film,
and the queens, is the joy and optimism they main
tain in the sometimes threatening shadow of their gay
lifestyle. Laughter overcomes bitterness as the bus
rolls on. jj
