## Stereolab's 'Mars Audiac Quintet' shines 
### 
It's a difficult task to stuff Stereolab and its brilliant music
into a tidy, pre-chewed, commercial alternative, Buzz-clip
package. File their dazzling "Mars Audiac Quintet" under

punk pop.
Stereolab's synthesis of
state-of-the-art technology
and good ol" rock sensibility
shows off a galaxy of styles
while maintaining a unique
charm and showing off a
wealth of warmth.

The layers of sound cling together flowingly: Tim
Gane's resounding organs and synthesizers moving with
chimy guitars floating over drummer Andy Ramsay's "per
suasive percussion" pulsing to lead singer Laetitia Sadier's
breezy yet substantial vocals.
From the opening shimmer of "Three-Dee Melodie"
through the precious pop of "International Colouring Con
test" to a tinkling close with the subdued instrumental
"Fiery Yellow," "Mars Audiac Quintet" is a speedy 70
minute trip of spiraling beauty and dizzying fun. It's a heady
brew, and any band that can pull it off has got to be a brainy
bunch.

Stereolab

Yet even more than the careful orchestration or the pro
grammed samples that back the shiny soundscape, the
thoughtful and personal lyrics typify Stereolab's intelligence.
After all, they described
"Pause," a song off their last
album "Transient Random
Noise Bursts with An
nouncements," tersely as
"Proust Song." Songs like
"Wow and Flutter" make you
think â€” when was the last

time you heard a catchy tune
with lyrics like "Progress is
the clue" that hint to Marxists leanings?
Still, Sadier convinces on a face-to-face level, never rising
on a platform to preach. It's that immediacy which makes the
band's craft continually compelling: just as Stereolab shows
that laser beam music doesn't have to mean distance and cal
culation, so Sadier's vocals speak in volumes that history
lessons can be made without the stoicism of a political
philosopher.
When space-age and deep thoughts are done up with as
much savvy and skill as Stereolab has, the rewards affect on the
most personal of levels.
