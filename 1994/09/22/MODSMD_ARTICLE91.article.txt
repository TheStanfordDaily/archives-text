# Jesus and Mary Chain's latest effort takes listeners along for the long haul
## 
### 
The Jesus and Mary Chain is not
afraid of change.
In their tenth year together as a band,
the rock group, led by founders Jim and
William Reid, have continued to forge
their own style of music. Their new re
lease, "Stoned and

Dethroned," fea
tures a heavily
acoustic sound in a
departure from
their customary
dark and troubling
feel.

"Stoned and Dethroned"
The Jesus and Mary Chain

While the Jesus
and Mary Chain continues to change as
a band, this particular album shows that
they have more than mastered their
newest sound, as several of the tracks
have the same tempo, guitar riffs and
repetitive lyrics.
The 17-track, 78-minute production
is highlighted by "Sometimes Always,"
which has appeared at No. 4 on Bill
board's Modern Rock Tracks chart. In
this hit Jim Reid is joined in a melodic
duet by Hope Sandoval of Mazzy Star.
Sandoval's mesmerizing voice adds vari
ety to an album that lacks dreadfully in
this area.
Even this song did not escape the

= only if it's free
= if you ve got the money to spare
= certainly worth your while
= a can't-miss

uninspiring lyrical approach of the rest
of the album, with overused repetition
making the track simple but not overly
endearing.
Amid the 17 tracks, "Between Us,"
"She," and "Girlfriend," offer a slight
deviation from

the Jesus and
Mary Chain's fa
vorite song-writ
ing formula, pro
viding an upbeat
alternative to the
rest of the selec
tions.

The sound achieved on "Stoned and
Dethroned" is similar to that of other
bands from the United Kingdom, such
as Echo and the Bunnymen.
The clean acoustic sound makes the
album worth a listen as long as you
don't pay too much attention to the
lyrics. On the other hand, the heavy
mixing, length and lack of variety make
"Stoned and Dethroned" a hard album
to listen to attentively from start to fin
ish.
Change is good — more of it would
have increased the appeal of this latest
effort by the Jesus and Mary Chain.
