## Not quite the phairest of them all, 'Whip-Smart' still has its moments spins 
### 
Liz Phair gives a damn and that's why her year
old debut "Exile in Guyville" is a timeless
album. The twenty-something Oberlin grad
represents the anti-slacker, a smart and gifted artist
who's honest about her tricks, self-aware of her ba
nalities and strong from the knowledge that she isn't
always.
On "Exile" she warns that she takes "full advan
tage of every man I meet" as she confides that she
wants a boyfriend and "all

that stupid old shit, like let
ters and sodas." Sure Phair
has been "hurt so badly," but
that's because she loves her
life. Whatever your sexual
politics, it is impossible not
to cheer, pity and admire her

when you hear Phair's re
signed yet at-easc voice on the classic "Fuck and
Run."
Inevitably, her most recent effort "Whip-Smart"
won't be judged on Phair's improved skill but on
her gift of expression — and whether it matches up
to the starkly confessional "Exile." On such terms,
"Whip-Smart" proves more interesting musically,
but less riveting on the whole.
The album shows that being a shade off makes all
the difference. Phair shines not so much for what
she says but /jowshe says it. When she hits the right
tone and pitch, like she does on the swaying
"Nashville," Phair doesn't flinch and you won't
wince. Everything comes together in one stirring re
frain as her fragile voice strains to assert that "I
won't decorate my love" to close the song.
But it goes the other way too. The opener
"Chopsticks" appears more bombastic than it is —
Phair's retort to a one-night stand that it's fine to
"do it backwards" because she can "fuck and watch
TV" are rendered all the more trite and unneces
sarily shocking by flat voice and an uninspired
piano arrangement. If she doesn't care, why should
we? "Dogs of L.A." sells like a car commercial

the album, nicely and
gently; it's almost
poignant the way Phair
keeps track of an °on
and-ofF friend while she
figures out where she's
been herself, who she's
seen and if she's "got any
what."

"Whip-Smart" stands
as a good effort, falling
short of being a great one
because those few tracks
which are off a bit fail
miserably. Liz Phair's not
flawless and that's why we
give a damn about her.

crossed with cryptic images of a bad Belly song.
The title track may be the emptiest, where Phair
plays mother to a fictitious son and makes idle
wishes around a nonsensical chorus. These misses
don't rankle any sensibilities; they're just disap
pointing.
Still, Phair's craft works in more than enough oc
casions to make "Whip-Smart" a winner. The first
single, "Supernova," blisters with humor and verve,
a rocker in which the tone

and a love song go hand-in
hand. Showing off a catchy
chorus, wailing guitars and a
steady bass line, the could-be
radio hit nudges its way be
side Sugar's "Your Favorite
Thing" to be the pop song of

the moment. "Cinco de
Mayo" bursts with confidence and zing, Phair's ex
uberance and energy reflects the liberation she sings
of. Through the squeaks and whistlers of the quirky
charmer "Support System," her meandering voice
delivers a sense of palpable confusion with lines like
"Tell me just what the hell a lover is supposed to
do?/I got the wrong reaction." "May Queen" caps
