Barcelona
Whit Stillman's new film
"Barcelona" benefits from not only
the witty repartee of two American
cousins but also the cultural rich
ness of the Catalan capital,
Barcelona. Stillman, director of
"Metropolitan" which was set in
New York City, utilizes intellectual
banter to create a brilliant comedy.
The Cathedral of the old city
serves as a backdrop along with
brightly lit boulevards replete with
"Trade Fair girls" for two American
cousins. One, Fred, an ROTC Navy
man, and the other Ted, a sincere
and ardent yuppie obsessed with
the culture of sales, embark on a
quest for romance.
Fred may seem boorish and
Ted insufferable, yet it is worth it to
tag along with them on their adven
tures through Barcelona. Stillman's
cerebral comedy perhaps mirrors
his own search. He married a
woman from Barcelona and his two
daughters were born there.
Clear and Present Danger
Harrison Ford's newest movie,
"Clear and Present Danger" is yet

another ill-fated attempt to put Tom
Clancy's best-selling novels on
screen. The movie recounts the ad
ventures of Jack Ryan, acting CIA
Director, played by Ford in a con
tinuation of his role in "Patriot
Games." The failures of this block
buster movie follow Ford to Clan
cy's newest cinematic attempt. A
poor script and obvious camera
work plague this otherwise intrigu
ing flick.
"Clear and Present Danger"
does abound in shining comic mo
ments. Indeed, there are enough
killer one-liners to fill an HBO spe
cial. One liners, however, do not a
movie make. Neither does an out
standing star.
Though seven bucks would be
a waste, "Clear and Present Dan
ger" makes a great matinee.
Eat Drink Man Woman
Ang Lee, director of last year's
international success "The Wed
ding Banquet," serves up a delec
table new comedy of food, father
hood, fornication and filial relations
"Eat Drink Man Woman" is a
gourmet affair — a hearty feast for

your eyes. Filled with an abun
dance of sensational Chinese dish
es, this romantic yet rueful celebra
tion of basic human desires re
duces "Like Water for Chocolate's"
impassioned fiestas to a traditional
Weight Watcher's meal plan.
"Eat Drink Man Woman" is a ful
filling banquet, both entertaining
and heartwarming. Go with a big
appetite. Bon Appetit!
Spanking the Monkey
"Spanking the Monkey" is a
new film about a rather old and se
rious theme. This first movie from
David Russell powerfully captures a
muggy summer day exuding Oedi
pal tension and most disturbing in
cest. The film is both authentic and
convincing with a believable plot
and true-to-life dialogue.
This is not another one of those
feel-good family films of the sum
mer, but a bittersweet slice of
American life that most would
rather avoid.
Without cliches and with humor,
Russell strikes a chord that brings
to light tension between a dysfunc
tional family and the people that

surround it. This film includes at
tempted, but unsuccessful suicide,
self-loathing and a dog with bad
gums that enjoys long walks.
"Spanking the Monkey" is only for
the intrepid.
True Lies
Like many of director James
Cameron's other films, "True Lies"
is an action film of mega-propor
tions.
From start to finish — with every
camera angle, special effect and
spray of bullets — the director re
minds us of his duty to elevate us
high above the cheap and thrilling
stomping grounds of Jean Claude
Van Damme and Keanu Reeves to
a T.N.T.-laced nirvana of sorts,
where only Sigourney Weaver,
Linda Hamilton, Arnold
Schwarzenegger and Ed Harris
dare tread.
"True Lies" is what "The Last
Action Hero" tried to be a summer
ago. Even with its problems it
works better because the imagi
nary world of the domestic spy is
much more palatable than that of
the rogue cop.
