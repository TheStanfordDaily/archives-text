# Arizona/Stanford Match-Ups
## 
### 
Stenstrom passed for three touch
downs and no interceptions in the
Cardinal victory over San Jose
State last week. He continues his
Heisman campaign with an as
sault on the Cardinal and Pacific
-10 Conference record books. Sten
strom's passing efficiency rating
of 184.0 leads the Pac-10 and
places him third nationally.
Shown flashes of brilliance
throughout his Wildcat career,
White guided Arizona to a 10-2
record in 1993, throwing for over
1,400 yards and 11 touchdowns.

Mitchell has begun the season in
impressive fashion, rushing for
315 yards in two games. This
week Mitchell faces a Wildcat de
fense which surrendered only 33
rushing yards per game a year
ago. Harris was an All-Conference
linebacker last season and the se
nior has picked up right where he
left off. In the season opener at
Georgia Tech, Harris was the de
fensive tackier on over 18% of the
Yellow Jackets plays. He also had
four tackles and caused a fumble
against New Mexico State.

The workhorse in a Wildcat back
field which is the strength of the
Arizona offense, Carter has al
ready carried the ball 48 times in
only two games in 1994 and is
proving himself to be a durable
runner. Carter has ten career 100
yard games. Swanson recorded
four sacks and caused a fumble in
last week's victory over San Jose
State. He is a leader on a Cardinal
defense which has already record
ed 12 sacks and 18 tackles for loss
es in 1994.

Buckey is a key player on a Cardi
nal offensive line which didn't
allow a sack last week against San
Jose State. They should have
their hands full today against Ari
zona's Desert Swarm defense, led
by junior Tedy Bruschi, who al
ready has two sacks, a tackle for
loss and a blocked field goal in
1994. Bruschi Was vo t d defensive
MVP for the Wildcats iust season,
a squad which included Outland
Trophy winner Rob Waldrop. He
has had at least one quarterback
sack in the past 14 games.

Sanders and free safety Tony
Bouie were rated the best safety
tandem in the country last season
by Sporting News. Sanders
recorded four tackles in each of
the Wildcats' two games this sea
son. Last year he led the Arizona
secondary with two sacks and
three caused fumbles. Manning
already has nine receptions in
1994 for 204 yards a 22.7 yards
per catch average. If he continues
on his current pace, he will break
Bob Blunt's school record of 21.1
yards per catch, set in 1966.

Arizona coach Dick Tomey sports
a butterfly collar in his plea for
more junior college transfers.
Tomey has been head coach at
Arizona for eight seasons and is
just one victory away from moving
into second on Arizona's all time
career winning list. Meanwhile,
Walsh appeared cooler than ever
as he led the Cardinal to victory
last week. Walsh returned to col
lege football after winning three
Super Bowl rings with the San
Francisco 49ers and guided Stan
ford to a Blockbuster Bowl win in
19b^.
