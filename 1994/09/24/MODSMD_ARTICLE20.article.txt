# Frost shines in dual role
## Stanford sophomore plays free safety and quarterback 
### Andrew Blachman Editorial staff 
Stanford's Scott Frost may be
the Cardinal quarterback of the
future, but that isn't keeping him
from excelling in the present.
The sophomore from Wood
River, Neb. the heir apparent to
Steve Stenstrom in 1995 has
been biding time in the Cardinal
â– secondary, where he will make his
second consecutive start at free
safety today.
" [Frost] could be the best safety
in college football," said head
coach Bill Walsh.
"He's big, he's fast and he hits.
He doesn't know the position that
well yet but that will come. I would
guess that he could be a first round
pick, regardless of his quarter
backing skills."
Strong praise from a man who
coached ten seasons with the San
Francisco 49ers, winning three
Super Bowl rings and being
named Coach of the Decade by the
Pro Football Hall of Fame.
"Coach Walsh is an honest
man," joked Frost, who intercept
ed a pass in his defensive debut
last Saturday against San Jose
State.
"But I don't know what game
he was watching. I did some things
pretty well but I'm a long way
from being a great safety."
Seeing action at both free safe
ty and back-up quarterback in last
Saturday's 51-20 mauling of San
Jose State, Frost became the first
Cardinal quarterback to play de
fense since Jack Douglas accom
plished the feat in 1957.
"Scott is a natural football play
er," said Walsh. "He's fierce and
he's tough and we can't afford to
have this great an athlete on the
sidelines keeping stats."
With senior quarterback Steve
Stenstrom healthy and ready to
break most school and conference
passing records this season, Frost
is unlikely to see much playing
time as a signal caller. So Walsh
decided to move him to safety
the same switch that turned for
mer Cardinal quarterback John
Lynch into an All-Conference per
former in 1992.
The move to defense has been
welcomed by Frost, who is simply
excited to be contributing on the
field.
"Going into the [San Jose
State] game, I was the loosest and
happiest that I've been for a game
since I've come to Stanford," he
said.
"The toughest part of the transi
tion to free safety was just playing
disciplined and knowing when to at
tack. There were a couple of times I
was licking my chops when guys
were coming through the holes."
The sophomore also believes
that his experience on defense will
help him when he fights for the
starting quarterback job in 1995.
"I've learned things about how
the secondary works that could
help me tremendously as a quar
terback in terms of spotting re
ceivers," he said.
But even Walsh admitted that
the time Frost spent practicing on
defense would hamper his devel
opment as a quarterback, especial
ly given the NCAA restriction that
only 20 hours a week can be allot
ted to football practice.
As he practices regularly with
both the offensive and defensive
squads, Frost's teammates and
coaches have begun calling him
Thorpe, in honor of the legendary

Jim Thorpe who played on offense
and defense in the National Foot
ball League.
Frost brings two sets of shoul
der pads and an extra jersey with
him to games and practices and
switches his equipment when he
gets the nod to come in as a quar
terback.
Despite his success on defense,
Frost made it clear that his inten
tion is to be Stanford's starting
quarterback when the 1995 sea
son opens.
"That's the plan," he said. "I
came here as a quarterback and
I'm going to be a quarterback."
And Frost has the credentials
to back up his claim. He was a con
sensus high school Ail-American
and was rated the third best quar
terback prospect in the nation by
Blue Chip Magazine two years
ago. Frost comes from an extreme
ly athletic family and cites his up
bringing as the key to his success.
"Any kind of athletic ability I
have I attribute to my parents,"
Frost said. "They gave me the
genes and I was taught to be com
petitive from the time I was very
young."
Frost's father Larry is a former
Nebraska Cornhusker and his
brother Steve is a center on the

Cardinal squad. But Frost claims
that the most athletic member of
his family is his mother, Carol, a
former Olympic discus thrower
who coaches high school football.
"She can still catch my hardest
passes in the backyard and she
throws harder than most guys on
the team," he said.
Though Frost played both free
safety and quarterback in high
school, it was his passing ability
that had schools like Stanford,
Notre Dame, and Nebraska
knocking on his door.
"The choice basically came
down between Stanford and Notre
Dame," said Frost, who was in
South Bend, Ind., to watch the
Cardinal upset the Irish 33-16 in
1992.
"The big question for me was
whether Stanford could compete
with the top teams in the nation.
After that game there was no
doubt Stanford was where I
wanted to be."
But Frost never imagined that
he would play on both sides of the
ball at Stanford.
"I don't think it's possible with
the competition at this level," he
said.
"But that doesn't mean I won't
try."

When sophomore back-up quarterback Scott Frost is not guiding the
offense like he did here against San Jose State, he is a star on defense
at free safety for the Cardinal.
