# Ed McCaffery and Toi Cook return to Bay Area
## Paths converge for former Cardinal standouts, now members of the San Francisco 49ers

When collegiate football play
ers graduate and sign on with
NFL teams, they never know ex
actly where their abilities will
take them.
The pro-football careers of
Stanford graduates Ed McCaffrey
('9l) and Toi Cook ('B6) have
landed them back in the Bay Area
this year as members of the San
Francisco 49ers.
For Cook, the decision to be
come a professional football play
er was not an easy one. While

Cook came to Stanford on a foot
ball scholarship, he chose Stan
ford over other schools because he
would get a chance to play on the
Cardinal baseball team.
He made the most of that op
portunity, earn the position of
starting right fielder during his
sophomore year. As a junior, he
was named to the All-Pacific-10
Conference first team, and the fol
lowing season he was the starting
center fielder for the College
World Series winning Cardinal
squad.
Meanwhile, Cook continued to
improve his play on the grid-iron.

The defensive back led the Cardi
nal in interceptions in each of his
last three seasons, earning Hon
orable Mention All-American
honors after his senior campaign.
When Cook was drafted by
both the New Orleans Saints and
the Minnesota Twins, he had a
choice to make. The decision
turned out to be a financial one for
Cook, who chose to play football
because of the more immediate
and certain money.
"Especially now that I'm play
ing with Deion [49ers teammate
Deion Sanders], I realize that I
could be playing both sports," said
Cook. "But I made the right
choice; I can play [football] for ten
years, and then move on."
Cook has made steady progress
over the course of his eight year
NFL career. During his first two
seasons, his playing time was gen
erally limited to special teams. In
1989, he became the starting right
cornerback and held a starting
spot for most of his next four sea
sons with the Saints.
This season, Cook has signed
on with San Francisco. But now,
with the addition of Sanders to
the 49ers secondary, Cook's sta
tus is uncertain.
"I thought that we had a legiti
mate shot at the Super Bowl be
fore Deion even came," said Cook.
"Now with him here, it
strengthens our team's position
but it does put me in a difficult sit
uation. But I know that inevitably,
I'll end up on the field it's been
that way my whole career."
While Cook's determination
has brought him success in the
NFL, he already has career plans
off the field. The communications
major and two college friends have
formed "B.L.T. Productions", a
movie production company.
"I want B.L.T. Productions to
become like Castle Rock Enter
tainment," said Cook, whose
group has written its first screen
play entitled, "Free James
Brown."
Like Cook, ex-Cardinal wide
receiver McCaffrey, who was dealt
to San Francisco in the off-season,
is also planning for his life after
football. McCaffrey majored in bi
ology while at Stanford and plans
to attend medical school when he
is finished playing football.
Since joining the New York Gi
ants in 1991, McCaffrey has es
tablished himself as a consistent
and productive wide receiver
one who will complement Jerry
Rice and John Taylor with the
49ers.
During his rookie campaign,
McCaffrey appeared in every
game as a third wide receiver and
on special teams. The following

year, he led the Giants in recep
tions (49 for 610 yards). Last sea
son, he demonstrated his ability
to make clutch plays when he
caught five passes for fifty-nine
yards against the 49ers in the di
visional play-off game.
That performance impressed
San Francisco enough to sign Mc-
Caffrey and bring him back to the
Bay Area after he lost his spot on
the Giants.
McCaffrey was a three sport

athlete in high school an Ail-
American football player, MVP of
his baseball team, and a 21.3 point
scorer in basketball.
At Stanford, Ed immediately
demonstrated that football was
his true calling.
"The split end position at Stan
ford is one that has produced
some of the best in the entire land
for a number of years, and Ed
[was] in line with that tradition,"
said Denny Green, McCaffrey's
head coach while at Stanford.
Yet McCaffrey's rise towards
Cardinal glory was not unimped
ed. After earning All Pac-10 Hon
orable Mention as a sophomore,
he suffered a thigh bruise during
the following pre-season. The
bruise calcified, forcing McCaf
frey to red-shirt the entire 1988
season.
He made a solid return the fol
lowing season, catching a team
high 53 passes, earning the honor
of Stanford's MVP. As a senior,
McCaffrey was recognized as a
Kodak All-American for making
61 receptions and scoring eight
touchdowns. Based on these
strong performances, the New
York Giants chose him as their
third round draft selection.
Like Cook, McCaffrey's pro
football career has taken him
from one end of the country to the
other.
But as 49er teammates, both
players strive to go to one place
neither has never been the
Super Bowl.
