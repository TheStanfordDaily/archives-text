# Stanford runs over Spartans in 51-20 mauling
## Mitchell turns in career performance, defense improves as Cardinal overwhelms San Jose State 
### Greg Collins Staff writer 
Bill Walsh wanted to establish
the Cardinal's questionable run
ning game before resorting to the
polished air attack of Stenstrom
and company in 1994.
And he did last Saturday against

San Jose State by rushingtheball
15 straight plays before attempting
a pass. By that time, the game was
already into the second quarter and
the Cardinal led the Spartans 14-7
en route to a 51-20 massacre.
"We wanted to run the ball,
which was very obvious," said
Walsh. "We've tried over the past

two weeks to bring it as far along as
we could before we get into the real
meat of our schedule."
Against San Jose State, Stan
ford ran around, over and through
the Spartans, amassing 314 rush
ing yards. Sophomore Mike
Mitchell led the Cardinal with 21
carries for 179 yards and three
touchdowns, his second straight
100-yard game. He was named Pa
cific-10 Conference offensive play
er of the week for his efforts.
Through only two games this
year, Stanford has equaled last year's
rushing touchdowns total of nine.
"It seems like our running
game has finally arrived," senior
wide receiver Justin Armour said.
"Now that we can put that togeth
er with the passing attack we have,
I'm excited to see where we can go
this year."
But the Cardinal defense has
come along as well, led by junior
defensive end Pete Swanson, Stan
ford held San Jose State to 25
yards on the ground on 32 carries.
Swanson recorded four of the Car
dinal's seven sacks and forced a
fumble, grabbing Pac-10 defensive
player of the week honors.
"Every aspect of the line play
was good," Swanson said. "I didn't
feel they [San Jose State's offen
sive line] were as strong as us or as
quick as us."
The effort of the defense was ad
ditionally surprising in that four
new faces dotted the starting line
up. Swanson, sophomore Scott

Frost and freshmen Kailee Wong
and Chris Draft all started for the
first time this year.
Frost, the team's back-up quar
terback, got the nod at free safety
and responded with four tackles
and an interception. Then, in the
second half, he relieved Steve
Stenstrom at quarterback, becom
ing the first Cardinal quarterback
to play on defense since Jack Dou
glas in 1957.
For Stenstrom, it was an un
usual day for the senior All-Ameri
can candidate. Throwing only 18
times, he completed 14 for 231
yards and three touchdowns. How
ever, the low number of pass at
tempts didn't bother him.
"That kind of situation would
probably get frustrating had our last
year and a half not gone the way it
had, where we were so unsuccessful
running the ball," Stenstrom said.
"We just needed to be able to run the
ball at will, do what we wanted to on
the ground, and I didn't care if I
threw a pass the whole game."
After starting the game with a
51-yard drive culminating in an
Ethan Allen 17-yard touchdown
run, Stanford struck again when
Swanson knocked the ball free
from Spartan quarterback Alii
Abrew at the Stanford 26 yard line.
Three carries by sophomore
fullback Adam Salina moved the
ball to the Stanford 48 before
Mitchell broke free for a 52-yard
touchdown run down the left side
of the field. The run was the

longest of Mitchell's career, and it
put the Cardinal up 14-0 with five
minutes left in the first quarter.
The Spartans answered quickly
by putting together an 11-play, 80-
yard drive which ended in a 16-
yard touchdown pass from Abrew
to Jacobbi Williams. However, the
Stanford defense held San Jose
State to one yard of total offense
the rest of the half.
A one-yard touchdown plunge
by Mitchell and a 7-yard pass from
Stenstrom to Armour pushed the
score to 28-7 at halftime. In the
first half, the Cardinal outgained
the Spartans by 180 yards in total
offense, 300 to 120.
Despite what appeared to be a
complete offensive package, Walsh
noted that there were still numer
ous areas that can be improved.
"The running game is not as con
sistent as it should be," Walsh said.
"Overall, our defense played well
other than individual plays where
we broke down or had penalties. Our
pressure has got to come from other
positions, not just our two tackles."
In the third quarter, Stanford's
offense showed the type of original
ity which has been a Walsh trade
mark for years on a 38-yard touch
down pass from Stenstrom to back
up tight end Tommy Hanson.
"That's all part of the Walsh de
ception," Armour said. "You do some
thing long enough, thenyou can catch
them relaxing. There wasn't anyone
within ten yards of him."

ception," Armour said. "You do some
thing long enough, thenyou can catch
them relaxing. There wasn't anyone
within ten yards of him."

Cardinal running back Mike Mitchell stretches over a group of Spartan
defenders to score one of his three touchdowns against San Jose
State. The sophomore has begun the year in impressive fashion,
rushing for over 157 yards per game.
Bill Walsh wanted to establish
the Cardinal's questionable run
ning game before resorting to the
polished air attack of Stenstrom
and company in 1994.
And he did last Saturday against

San Jose State by rushingtheball
15 straight plays before attempting
a pass. By that time, the game was
already into the second quarter and
the Cardinal led the Spartans 14-7
en route to a 51-20 massacre.
"We wanted to run the ball,
which was very obvious," said
Walsh. "We've tried over the past

two weeks to bring it as far along as
we could before we get into the real
meat of our schedule."
Against San Jose State, Stan
ford ran around, over and through
the Spartans, amassing 314 rush
ing yards. Sophomore Mike
Mitchell led the Cardinal with 21
carries for 179 yards and three
touchdowns, his second straight
100-yard game. He was named Pa
cific-10 Conference offensive play
er of the week for his efforts.
Through only two games this
year, Stanford has equaled last year's
rushing touchdowns total of nine.
"It seems like our running
game has finally arrived," senior
wide receiver Justin Armour said.
"Now that we can put that togeth
er with the passing attack we have,
I'm excited to see where we can go
this year."
But the Cardinal defense has
come along as well, led by junior
defensive end Pete Swanson, Stan
ford held San Jose State to 25
yards on the ground on 32 carries.
Swanson recorded four of the Car
dinal's seven sacks and forced a
fumble, grabbing Pac-10 defensive
player of the week honors.
"Every aspect of the line play
was good," Swanson said. "I didn't
feel they [San Jose State's offen
sive line] were as strong as us or as
quick as us."
The effort of the defense was ad
ditionally surprising in that four
new faces dotted the starting line
up. Swanson, sophomore Scott

Frost and freshmen Kailee Wong
and Chris Draft all started for the
first time this year.
Frost, the team's back-up quar
terback, got the nod at free safety
and responded with four tackles
and an interception. Then, in the
second half, he relieved Steve
Stenstrom at quarterback, becom
ing the first Cardinal quarterback
to play on defense since Jack Dou
glas in 1957.
For Stenstrom, it was an un
usual day for the senior All-Ameri
can candidate. Throwing only 18
times, he completed 14 for 231
yards and three touchdowns. How
ever, the low number of pass at
tempts didn't bother him.
"That kind of situation would
probably get frustrating had our last
year and a half not gone the way it
had, where we were so unsuccessful
running the ball," Stenstrom said.
"We just needed to be able to run the
ball at will, do what we wanted to on
the ground, and I didn't care if I
threw a pass the whole game."
After starting the game with a
51-yard drive culminating in an
Ethan Allen 17-yard touchdown
run, Stanford struck again when
Swanson knocked the ball free
from Spartan quarterback Alii
Abrew at the Stanford 26 yard line.
Three carries by sophomore
fullback Adam Salina moved the
ball to the Stanford 48 before
Mitchell broke free for a 52-yard
touchdown run down the left side
of the field. The run was the

longest of Mitchell's career, and it
put the Cardinal up 14-0 with five
minutes left in the first quarter.
The Spartans answered quickly
by putting together an 11-play, 80-
yard drive which ended in a 16-
yard touchdown pass from Abrew
to Jacobbi Williams. However, the
Stanford defense held San Jose
State to one yard of total offense
the rest of the half.
A one-yard touchdown plunge
by Mitchell and a 7-yard pass from
Stenstrom to Armour pushed the
score to 28-7 at halftime. In the
first half, the Cardinal outgained
the Spartans by 180 yards in total
offense, 300 to 120.
Despite what appeared to be a
complete offensive package, Walsh
noted that there were still numer
ous areas that can be improved.
"The running game is not as con
sistent as it should be," Walsh said.
"Overall, our defense played well
other than individual plays where
we broke down or had penalties. Our
pressure has got to come from other
positions, not just our two tackles."
In the third quarter, Stanford's
offense showed the type of original
ity which has been a Walsh trade
mark for years on a 38-yard touch
down pass from Stenstrom to back
up tight end Tommy Hanson.
"That's all part of the Walsh de
ception," Armour said. "You do some
thing long enough, thenyou can catch
them relaxing. There wasn't anyone
within ten yards of him."
