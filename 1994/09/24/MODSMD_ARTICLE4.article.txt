# Cats on the prowl
## Arizona's Rose Bowl hopes hinge on defense 
### Christian Leone Editorial staff 
The 1994 Arizona Wildcats are
hoping that their awe-inspiring
defense and surprisingly effective
offense will be enough to take
them where no Wildcat has ever
been before the Rose Bowl.
Arizona's football history is
filled with second rate bowl victo
ries and second place teams. The
Wildcats have appeared in the John
Hancock Bowl, the Copper Bowl,
the Aloha Bowl, the Sun Bowl and
the IBM OS/2 Fiesta Bowl. They
even played in the Salad Bowl in
1949 where they lost to the Drake
Bulldogs in a nail-biter.
They were almost good enough
many times, including last year
when they went 6-2 in the Pacific
-10 Conference only to see 6-2
UCLA lose to Wisconsin in the
Bruins' 13th Rose Bowl appear
ance.
While they would have rather
been in Pasadena, the Wildcats did
what they could in the Fiesta Bowl
against tenth-ranked Miami. They
beat the Hurricanes 29-0 in the
second biggest blowout and first
shutout in Fiesta Bowl history.
Even though it gave Arizona its
first 10-victory season in 90 years
of football, it just wasn't the same.
Today Arizona faces off against
Stanford in a Pac-10 opener that
will display the Cardinal's compli
cated yet efficient pro-style of
fense and Arizona's mind-bog
gling defense.
"It's going to be an aerial cir
cus," said Stamford head coach Bill
Walsh referring to Arizona's rela
tively new ability to almost com
pletely stop the run.
"Arizona has a beautifully con
ceived defense," said Walsh. "It's
unique, it's different and its great
for college football. They have an
answer for everything."

But defense has not always
been a strength for Arizona. In
fact, it was not long ago that the
defense was losing games for the
Wildcats.
For years Arizona ran multiple
defenses with little success. But
several years ago head coach Dick
Tomey and the Wildcats' coaching
staff set out to design one simple
defense that could be used in all
situations. What they came up
with is the double-eagle flex that
now dominates the Pac-10 and col
lege football.
"We got our brains beat out
years ago," said Tomey. "So we de
cided to go back to a simpler con
cept because we were making too
many mistakes. Now our players
are very seldom confused. We just
play one defense and we don't even
try to be multiple."
Arizona's new defensive philos
ophy has transformed the team
from a collection of talented indi
vidual players into a converging
attack that has earned the nick
name "Desert Swarm".
"When I came here a few years
ago the defense was a me-me-me
thing," said strong safety Brandon
Sanders. "Now I'm just part of a
unit and it feels pretty good."
Whatever they are doing seems
to be working. Last year the Wild
cats allowed a grand total of 331
yards rushing, establishing new
Pac-10 records for total yards and
yards per game. They have led the
nation in rushing defense the past
two seasons, allowing a meager
47.5 ground yards per game.
"Our defensive philosophy is to
stop the run," said Sanders, an
All-Conference performer a year
ago. "But the game is all about ad
justments. Stanford has a bal
anced attack this year and the
game will be tough. We just hope
we can make the adjustments nec
essary to win."

Arizona opened this season
with a 19-14 victory over Georgia
Tech dominating the offensive
and defensive line while rushing
for 277 yards and only allowing 20
net rushing yards.
Two weeks ago Arizona embar
rassed New Mexico State 44-0 in a
game Wildcat coach Dick Tomey
described as "poorly played." The
Aggies managed only 83 yards on
31 carries and allowed Arizona to
walk up and down the field for
over 560 total yards of offense.
Now the Wildcats and their de
fense appear eager to take the field
and showcase the talent that has
them ranked among the elite in
college football.

This year many preseason
publications, including Sports Il
lustrated, chose Arizona as the
best team in the nation. The
Wildcats appear ready to shed
their image of mediocrity and
step into the limelight.
"A program like ours hasn't
had a lot of visibility so when you
get it you have to appreciate it."
said Tomey. "But we take it with a
grain of salt and realize that it's
just a prediction."
Tedy Bruschi, the Wildcat's All-
Conference defensive end echoed
Tomey's sentiments
"It's flattering," said Bruschi.
"I'm going to frame [the Sports Il
lustrated] and have all the players

sign it and then I'm going to move
on."
"The [Sports Illustrated arti
cle] was nice but it's not going to
win us any games," said Tony
Bouie, the Wildcats All-Confer
ence free safety. "We don't even
think about it anymore."
"As far as rankings go, we
couldn't care less about Florida or
Florida State, we care about our
selves," said Bruschi, who led the
Pac-10 in sacks last year with 18.
"Our goal is to make it to the
Rose Bowl. We don't want to have
to count on Cal beating UCLA or
Washington beating Arizona
State. All we want to count on is
the Cats winning."

try to be multiple."
Arizona's new defensive philos
ophy has transformed the team
from a collection of talented indi
vidual players into a converging
attack that has earned the nick
name "Desert Swarm".
"When I came here a few years
ago the defense was a me-me-me
thing," said strong safety Brandon
Sanders. "Now I'm just part of a
unit and it feels pretty good."
Whatever they are doing seems
to be working. Last year the Wild
cats allowed a grand total of 331
yards rushing, establishing new
Pac-10 records for total yards and
yards per game. They have led the
nation in rushing defense the past
two seasons, allowing a meager
47.5 ground yards per game.
"Our defensive philosophy is to
stop the run," said Sanders, an
All-Conference performer a year
ago. "But the game is all about ad
justments. Stanford has a bal
anced attack this year and the
game will be tough. We just hope
we can make the adjustments nec
essary to win."

Arizona opened this season
with a 19-14 victory over Georgia
Tech dominating the offensive
and defensive line while rushing
for 277 yards and only allowing 20
net rushing yards.
Two weeks ago Arizona embar
rassed New Mexico State 44-0 in a
game Wildcat coach Dick Tomey
described as "poorly played." The
Aggies managed only 83 yards on
31 carries and allowed Arizona to
walk up and down the field for
over 560 total yards of offense.
Now the Wildcats and their de
fense appear eager to take the field
and showcase the talent that has
them ranked among the elite in
college football.

This year many preseason
publications, including Sports Il
lustrated, chose Arizona as the
best team in the nation. The
Wildcats appear ready to shed
their image of mediocrity and
step into the limelight.
"A program like ours hasn't
had a lot of visibility so when you
get it you have to appreciate it."
said Tomey. "But we take it with a
grain of salt and realize that it's
just a prediction."
Tedy Bruschi, the Wildcat's All-
Conference defensive end echoed
Tomey's sentiments
"It's flattering," said Bruschi.
"I'm going to frame [the Sports Il
lustrated] and have all the players

sign it and then I'm going to move
on."
"The [Sports Illustrated arti
cle] was nice but it's not going to
win us any games," said Tony
Bouie, the Wildcats All-Confer
ence free safety. "We don't even
think about it anymore."
"As far as rankings go, we
couldn't care less about Florida or
Florida State, we care about our
selves," said Bruschi, who led the
Pac-10 in sacks last year with 18.
"Our goal is to make it to the
Rose Bowl. We don't want to have
to count on Cal beating UCLA or
Washington beating Arizona
State. All we want to count on is
the Cats winning."

The 1994 Arizona Wildcats are
hoping that their awe-inspiring
defense and surprisingly effective
offense will be enough to take
them where no Wildcat has ever
been before the Rose Bowl.
Arizona's football history is
filled with second rate bowl victo
ries and second place teams. The
Wildcats have appeared in the John
Hancock Bowl, the Copper Bowl,
the Aloha Bowl, the Sun Bowl and
the IBM OS/2 Fiesta Bowl. They
even played in the Salad Bowl in
1949 where they lost to the Drake
Bulldogs in a nail-biter.
They were almost good enough
many times, including last year
when they went 6-2 in the Pacific
-10 Conference only to see 6-2
UCLA lose to Wisconsin in the
Bruins' 13th Rose Bowl appear
ance.
While they would have rather
been in Pasadena, the Wildcats did
what they could in the Fiesta Bowl
against tenth-ranked Miami. They
beat the Hurricanes 29-0 in the
second biggest blowout and first
shutout in Fiesta Bowl history.
Even though it gave Arizona its
first 10-victory season in 90 years
of football, it just wasn't the same.
Today Arizona faces off against
Stanford in a Pac-10 opener that
will display the Cardinal's compli
cated yet efficient pro-style of
fense and Arizona's mind-bog
gling defense.
"It's going to be an aerial cir
cus," said Stamford head coach Bill
Walsh referring to Arizona's rela
tively new ability to almost com
pletely stop the run.
"Arizona has a beautifully con
ceived defense," said Walsh. "It's
unique, it's different and its great
for college football. They have an
answer for everything."

But defense has not always
been a strength for Arizona. In
fact, it was not long ago that the
defense was losing games for the
Wildcats.
For years Arizona ran multiple
defenses with little success. But
several years ago head coach Dick
Tomey and the Wildcats' coaching
staff set out to design one simple
defense that could be used in all
situations. What they came up
with is the double-eagle flex that
now dominates the Pac-10 and col
lege football.
"We got our brains beat out
years ago," said Tomey. "So we de
cided to go back to a simpler con
cept because we were making too
many mistakes. Now our players
are very seldom confused. We just
play one defense and we don't even
try to be multiple."
