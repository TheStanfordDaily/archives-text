# CARDINAL NOTES
## Mitchell, Swanson earn conference honors 
### 
Junior defensive end Pete Swanson
recorded four sacks and forced a fumble in
the Cardinal's 51-20 victory over San Jose
State. His five sacks on the season place him
fifth in the Pac-10. Swanson was named
Pac-10 Conference defensive player of the
week for his efforts.
Led by Swanson, the Cardinal defense al
ready has 12 sacks in 1994, after recording
only 17 in all of 1993....
For the second consecutive week,
sophomore running back Mike Mitchell
set a new career best single day of rush
ing. His 179 yards and three touchdowns
on 21 carries gave him 315 rushing yards
on the year. He had already surpassed the
century mark before Steve Stenstrom
threw his first pass. On Monday he was
named the Pac-10 offensive player of the
week.
Mitchell's 157.5 rushing yards per game
average ranks him second in the Pac-10 and
sixth in the nation ...
The numbers say it all. The 51 points the
Cardinal scored against San Jose State were
more than any single game last season and
the 20 points allowed were also fewer than
any game in 1993....
Just by taking the field last Saturday,
quarterback Steve Stenstrom surpassed
John Elway on the all-time Stanford career
starts list with 35....
Senior kicker Aaron Mills didn't even
have to bother getting out of bed last Satur
day. In the entire game against San Jose
State the Cardinal never punted, marking
the first time that had happened since Nov.
12,1977. ...
Quarterback Steve Stenstrom may hope
to ride his arm to the Heisman Trophy, but
apparently Bill Walsh has other plans. Sten
strom didn't even throw a pass until three
minutes had gone by in the second quarter
last Saturday against San Jose State. In
stead the senior continually handed the ball
off to running back Mike Mitchell and full
back Ethan Allen.
"It was a nice change of pace," said the
senior. "It takes some of the pressure off the
passing game and opens things up a little."

Stenstrom still managed to amass 231
yards and three touchdowns on only 18 pass
attempts. .. .
Senior Allen Gonzalez, a nose tackle who
has been plagued by injuries his entire Car
dinal career, has quit the squad. .. .
For those who want to catch a glimpse of
current Pac-10 and Stanford passing
records before Stenstrom destroys them,
here's a look:
Stenstrom moved into third place in the
school's career total offense list on Satur
day, but is still 186 yards shy of Jim Plun
kett and 1,369 behind John Elway. Also, his
three touchdowns against San Jose State
moved him into a tie for second in all-time
Pac-10 touchdown passes with 60. He is still
17 touchdown tosses short of Elway's
record....
Senior wide receiver Justin Armour is
making the most out of his opportunities.
On Saturday, he caught just two passes for
a grand total of 27 yards. However, both
grabs were good for touchdowns, tying him
for fourth in Stanford's all-time touchdown
reception list with 16.. ..
Similarly, tight end Tommy Hanson has
caught just one pass all year a 38 yard
touchdown. ...
Last Saturday's game was a roller coast
er ride for junior kicker Eric Abrams. After
missing a 31 yard field goal, he had his sec
ond extra point blocked of the season. Then
he had another kick swatted away, this time
a 46 yard field goal, before splitting the up
rights with a career high 50 yard field goal.
It was the Cardinal's first 50 yard field goal
since John Hopkins connected against Ari
zona State in 1989. ...
With four rushing touchdowns against
San Jose State, the Cardinal now has nine
ground scores on the year, already equaling
its entire 1993 output. ...
Today's game showcases the meeting of
the top two offenses in the Pac-10 (Stanford
1, Arizona 2) and two of the top three de
fenses in the conference (Arizona 1, Stan
ford 3). . ..
