How does a sewing machine create stitches?
How does a bike shift gears?
Are you wondering what mechanical engineering is really all about?

ME99 allows students to explore answers to these and
many other questions through a series of mechanical
dissection labs. A byproduct of this experience is greater
confidence in "hands-on" skills. Lab time will be spent
disassembling the various machines. Assignments will
include formal and informal oral presentations and a
final poster session where students explore a product of
their own choosing.
Prerequisites: A keen sense of curiosity. No prior
dissection experience required.
