# Few changes for Tresidder
## No Taco Bell this year 
### Piers Henwood Editorial Staff 
Tresidder Union's newly appointed manage
ment team will not make any changes to the
Union's retail space this year, meaning that the
arrival of an on-campus Taco Bell will again be
postponed indefinitely.
To facilitate the Union's reorganization, the
University brought in the Stanford Manage
ment Company's Shopping Center Division
last June to manage Tresidder's retail services.
This year, however, the company will make
only administrative changes, according to
Dorothea Gregowski, assistant director of the
Stanford Shopping Center.
"This first year will be used to examine the
infrastructure," she said. "Tresidder will look
and feel exactly as it does now."
In particular, this development means that
the ongoing Taco Bell saga — which began last
year when administrators announced the fran
chise would open by January of this year — will
most likely continue into the next academic
year, according to Gregowski.
Last spring Provost Condoleezza Rice ap
pointed a Tresidder task force, comprised of stu
dent leaders and University administrators, to
recommend plans for restructuring the Union.
Amidst growing concern that Stanford gener
al funds — which presently cover any deficits in
the Union's budget — were over-subsidizing the
Union, administrators targeted Tresidder as part
of a continuing effort to trim $15 to $20 million
from the University's budget over three years.
The change in management has resulted in
the termination of four Tresidder staff posi-
tions, including that of Director
Bobbi Braden, who has ques
tioned the new management
team's ability to meet the Univer
sity's expectations without sacri
ficing quality or increasing food
prices.
She has also voiced dissatisfac
tion with the way the change in
management was handled by
Stanford administration. "What I
would like clarified is .. . the per
ception that Tresidder has been
losing over a million dollars
because of poor management,"
Braden said.
"The reality is that a subsidy
was consciously given to the
Union so that students wouldn't
have to pay too much," she said.
"It seems unfair to begin com
plaining about the money being
lost when in effect it was set up to
lose money."

Dean of Students Michael
Jackson agreed that Tresidder's
annual subsidies were expected
under the present arrangement,
but concurrently supports the
goal of cutting costs in the future.
"Essentially, what we're trying
to do is revitalize Tresidder as a
student union . . . and so while
continuing to revitalize it, we
want to save money," he said.
Jackson added that the new
management team will accom
plish the goal by bringing its
"expertise to bear on ensuring
that we have the ability to have
services for the community."
Rice also refrained from plac
ing blame on Braden and her
staff, but nonetheless believes
that Tresidder can be put to more
efficient use.
"I'm not saying it was the
staffs fault the subsidy had to be
revisited," she said. "But when
we're paying $1 million and we're
not getting as much use from it as
we could, you have to look at it
again."

Gregowski said
that Tresiddcr's
$1 million annual
subsidy will be
reduced dramati
cally over the next
three years.
"We hope that i
after three years .
. . [the subsidy!
will be down to
zero," she said.
