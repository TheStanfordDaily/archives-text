## Officials wary of violence Firefight in Haiti draws comparisons to events in Somalia 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - With
the flash of a gun barrel ending a
week of relative calm, senior offi
cials warned yesterday that the
firefight that took 10 Haitian lives
may be a forerunner of more vio
lence in that historically violent
land.
"This is the first bad incident
we've had involving, directly,
American troops, but it won't be
the last," said Senate Armed Ser
vices Committee Chairman Sam
Nunn, D-Ga., a member of the
delegation that brokered the deal
with the Haitian military on the
entry of U.S. forces.
U.S. Marines killed 10 armed
men Saturday evening outside a
police station in the northern
coastal city of Cap-Haitien in a
battle ensuing after several of the
men emerged from the station and
opened fire on an American patrol.
It was the first violent incident
involving Americans after a sur
prisingly peaceful first week of the
U.S. occupation and it drew quick
comparisons to hostile attacks
against U.S. troops in Somalia.
While administration officials

responded by assuring the Ameri
can public, and warning the
Haitians, they were ready for
more, congressional critics geared
up for an attempt to legislate an
early withdrawal from Haiti.
President Clinton, in New York
for a meeting with U.N. Secretary
General Boutros Boutros-Ghali
issued a statement expressing
regret for the loss of life and say
ing: "It must be clear that U.S.
forces are prepared to respond to
hostile action against them and
will do so."
Speaking at a church in
Harlem, Clinton said the Haiti
operation "helps to end human
rights violations that we find
intolerable everywhere but
unconscionable on our doorstep
and offers them (Haitians) a
chance at stability."
Clinton did not mention at the
church the violence in Cap-Hai
tien. But Joint Chiefs of Staff
Chairman Gen. John Shalikashvili
said Haitian military leader Lt.
Gen. Raoul Cedras had been flown
to the port city yesterday and the
U.S. side was making it "abun

dantly clear" what the conse- *
quences would be if there were fur- •
ther threats to U.S. troops. •
They now know, he said on.
CBS' "Face the Nation," "what,
the cost to the Haitians is for pick-.
ing a fight with the Marines."
The officials appearing on"
news programs yesterday also."
sought to remind the American,
public that no military operation,
of this sort can be risk-free.
Defense Secretary William"
Perry, who visited Haiti on Satur-'
day, said he told U.S. troops there"
that "they have to stand tall for
that mission and that they would
have difficulties. We fully expect
ed difficulties, and the incident we
saw yesterday, I think, is just typ
ical of what we expected to see,"
he said on NBC's "Meet the
Press."
But House Minority Whip
Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., said the
incident underscored Haiti's simi
larity to Somalia, and said he will
press for a resolution this week
demanding U.S. withdrawal from
Haiti "at the most rapid possible
speed."
