# Spread of plague feared in India
## At least 51 killed as authorities blamed for slow movement after floods

SURAT, India (AP) - An outbreak of
deadly pneumonic plague eased yester
day in Surat, but government officials
worried the hundreds of thousands of
people who fled the stricken city could
spread the disease to other parts of India.
Residents of the shantytowns that
ring this city of 2 million, meanwhile,
blamed local authorities for not moving
fast enough to clear the animal carcass
es and garbage left after recent floods.
"This area of the city is a living hell,"
said one man, Bansi Mali, who cremated
his younger brother last week. "It is the
municipality, not the plague, that has
killed my brother."
Pneumonic plague, a strain of the
bubonic plague or "Black Death" that

ravaged 14th-century Europe and Asia,
has so far killed at least 51 people in
Surat, a city on India's Arabian Sea coast.
Hundreds of people were hospitalized.
Officials declared Surat a disaster
zone and rushed in millions of capsules
of antibiotics. The plague, spread by
fleas that have bitten infected rats and
from person to person by airborne bac
teria, can be cured if antibiotics are
administered quickly enough.
Kundan Lai, a city administrator, said
yesterday that Surat's civil hospital report
ed three deaths and 36 new cases overnight
â€” a sharp drop from the rate since the
first plague victim died Thursday.
"The situation is settling down," said
Dr. Rajesh Parmar, a senior physician

at the hospital. "Mortality has reduced.
The rush of new patients has also
decreased."
But few were prepared to say the out
break was under control in Surat, and
doctors and government officials
stressed India still faces the risk of a
plague epidemic.
An estimated 400,000 people fled
Surat as authorities began spraying
insecticides around the city and handing
out antibiotics.
Some went 160 miles south to Bom
bay, where 13 suspected pneumonic
plague cases were being tested yester
day at Kasturba Hospital for Infectious
Diseases, including 10 from Surat, said
Dr. R. Kadam.
