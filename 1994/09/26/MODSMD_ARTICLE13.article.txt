Korean talks threatened
GENEVA (AP) â€” North Korea
warned yesterday that U.S. naval
maneuvers off the Korean peninsula
threatened to dash talks on opening the
North's nuclear program to internation
al inspections.
Talks between the United States and
North Korea reconvened yesterday amid
reports that differences between the two
sides were widening.
Western experts believe North Korea
has diverted enough plutonium from its
nuclear reactors to make at least one
nuclear bomb. Pyongyang insists its
nuclear program is peaceful, but for
more than a year has blocked interna

tional inspections it previously agreed to.
Chater leading candidate
WASHINGTON (AP) - Social Securi
ty Commissioner Shirley Chater is the
leading candidate to oversee the agency
into the 21st century, despite complaints
that she has not been a forceful advocate
for the troubled national retirement sys
tem.
Under a recent law separating the
Social Security Administration from the
Department of Health and Human Ser
vices, President Clinton has until Oct. 15
to nominate someone to run the newly
independent agency for the next six
years.
