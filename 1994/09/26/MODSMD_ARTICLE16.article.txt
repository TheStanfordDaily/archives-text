££ MOST important
thing in life is maintain-
JL ing perspective."
Or so my mother says. But I
trust a woman who, after being
widowed in her 40s with three
young children, has always been
able to roll with the punches and
keep a smile on her face.
But keeping perspective on one's
life during college is nearly impossi
ble. Do you live in the present or
work for the future? Do you try to do
both and perhaps realize you cannot?
There's a different answer for every
person, but it's tough all the same.
College life is a difficult juggling
act. But during my last three years
at Stanford, I've pushed myself to
the limit in the hope of finding that
perspective, of defining who I am,
and of solidifying what I believe in.
I've worked so hard some days
that I've literally collapsed at the
end of them. But every day I've
learned something new. These past
three years have given me perspec
tive. Little by little, I've grown to
know everything about myself, and
that's given me a spot from which
to view the world. I can easily say
now that I don't want to be a doctor,
that my boyfriend and I are a good
match, and that I believe in person
al responsibility more than anyone
else I know.
A lot of this I have learned at The
Daily. While most people pick up
The Daily in the morning, skim it
over and flip to the crossword, for
those of us who work here, every
word, photo and caption is crucial. I
have had to state my opinion and
back it up with facts more in one
day at The Daily than I have in all
the papers I have ever written.
Searching for perspective has
been exhausting. And I've made
some bad choices and mistakes. I'd
never want to go back, though,
because I've learned from all of
them. In the end, I have built a foun
dation within me that can never be
taken away. This foundation brings
me confidence and peace of mind.
Now I find myself as the leader of
this monstrosity known simply as
"The Daily." Though considered a
campus informer, The Daily is actu
ally much more than that. It is an
extension of the dozens of people
who work to put it out everyday.

Now, in its 103 rd year, The Daily
needs to find and maintain perspec
tive. My job, I believe, is to help it do
that. We are an organization that
will always be as young as its mem
bers and will constantly be experi
encing the same growing pains as
its members. While we may never
find complete perspective, that
shouldn't stop us from searching.
So we're trying some new things
this year at The Daily, but that is
the easy part. There are still a
bunch of questions that plague us
as an institution. What is our role
at Stanford? What are we all about?
How can we improve ourselves?
If we don't know the answers to
these questions, it is more difficult
to put out a quality newspaper. We
are often distracted by internal pol
itics when we should be concentrat
ing on the details of an article.
With your help and feedback, I
hope to start The Daily on the path
to finding perspective. If we're
doing something that you don't
like, let us know. If we're not doing
something you would like, let us
know. Maybe we'll give it a shot.
And we're going to be wrong
sometimes. As long as we admit
that we're wrong, though, and
change appropriately, don't hold it
over our head. Improvement can
only come from change, and change
can only mean occasional mistakes.
If you want us to improve, allow us
to be responsibly fallible.
This volume we're going to push
ourselves as hard as we ever have to
provide fair, objective and accurate
reporting, to inform the Stanford
community of everything going on
at this school, and to develop a
happy, well-trained staff.
But after all this, we will be
thinking a little more about what
we're all about and who we are. I
want to leave The Daily with a
greater foundation than it has now
so there is confidence behind every
word, photo and caption you see on
the page. And that will be the true
sign that we have improved.
