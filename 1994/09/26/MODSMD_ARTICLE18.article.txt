THE "AMERICA'S
Best Colleges"
edition of U.S.
News and World Report
was on the newsstands.
Stanford was ranked
fifth overall (No. 1 in
the academic reputa
tion category, however).
My first reaction,

frankly, was one of relief. A trusted col
league had reported a rumor that no
school west of the Hudson River had even
made the top ten.
So we're not No. 1; not for U.S. News
and World Report, at least. But for this
veteran of 37 years on the Farm, whose
blood color is decidedly cardinal red, no
magazine will ever convince me or virtu
ally any, I suspect, of the thousands of
loyal Stanford faculty, students, alumni
and staff that we're anything but No. 1.
Whenever the "Mcßatings," as a for
mer Stanford admissions dean calls
them, come out, I find myself asking,
"No. 1 for whom?" I also wonder how
various Stanford constituencies react, or
should react, to these ratings or, for that
matter, any attempt to put something in
rank order.
U.S. News and World Report started
rating colleges in the early 1980s. Stan
ford was ranked No. 1 on three separate
occasions. University President Donald
Kennedy, with precisely the right mix of
pride and humility, termed the exercise a

"beauty contest." I remember reading a
copy of The Harvard Crimson in which a
student stated that he was considering
transferring because he couldn't see
spending all those tuition dollars at a
school that was No. 2. Similarly, a few
years later, when Stanford dropped to
No. 3 in the ratings, a father demanded
an application fee refund for his son. (It
wasn't granted.)
The race for No. 1 permeates many
educational enterprises. For years,
numerous college football coaches have
been advocating a playoff system to
determine the "true" national champion.
Some secondary schools try to put their
students in the best light by granting a
No. 1 class rank to anyone with a weight
ed CPA of 4.0 or better. (A year ago, we
received applications from many of the
108 No. l's at one particular school.) I
even had a counselor ask me to write to
his school board stating that Stanford
supported weighted grading because that
would allow more students to be ranked
in the top half of the class. (I never did
understand the "new math.")
We recently welcomed 1,589 new
freshmen to Stanford. 90 percent of them
ranked in the top 10 percent of their high
school classes. Only 10 percent will grad
uate from Stanford in the top decile.
(Maybe I'm catching on after all.) Actual
ly, Stanford doesn't rank its students,
but if we did, there would be many more
non-No. l's than No. l's. (I'm definitely

catching on.) Many first-year students
are apprehensive about fitting in here
academically. They realize that there's a
good chance they won't be No. 1 in their
CIV section, let alone their freshman
class. They note the stratospheric scores
and grades reported for entering stu
dents and wonder, "Was my offer of
admission a mistake?" As Dean of Admis
sions Jim Montoya told the freshmen Fri
day, "our office doesn't make mistakes!"
In evaluating candidates, we focus on the
total individual and not just a student's
class rank, even if it is No. 1.
Let's keep rankings in perspective. No
school is No. 1 for everyone, not even
Stanford. Our women's volleyball team is
presently (and will continue to be —
check 'em out!) ranked No. 1 in the
nation. Does it make sense for a student
with solid, but not exceptional athletic
ability, whose top priority is to captain a
college volleyball team, to make Stanford
her No. 1 choice? Probably not, but I
would hope that if she did apply, gain
admission, and enroll, she would do so for
reasons other than a No. 1 ranking, and
she would do all she could to use the
resources here to the utmost.
I'm reminded of an essay an applicant
wrote on his favorite travel quote: "No
matter where you go, there you are." You
are now at Stanford and will be afforded
many wonderful opportunities. As a
