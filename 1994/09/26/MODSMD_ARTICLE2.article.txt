# $10,000 grant for LGBCC, women
## 'Gay Liberation' statue reinstalled

The Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual
Community Center and the
Women's Center will each receive
a $10,000 grant for a variety of
program improvements, Dean of
Students Michael Jackson said
yesterday.
Although LGBCC adviser Troy
Gilbert attributed the increased
funding partly to last May's van
dalism of the "Gay Liberation"
sculpture, Jackson said funding
for the LGBCC has been one of the
University's ongoing concerns.
The money will fund student

speaker positions among other im
provements.
The white sculpture, which was
removed from its site near the
Physics Tank on Sept. 6 for
restoration, was reinstalled with
out ceremony on Friday morning
amid downpours — more than
four months after six Stanford
athletes allegedly vandalized it.
Despite the widespread outcry
following the vandalism, Jackson
said the funding is more a part of
the University's commitment to
the LGBCC than a response to any
one incident.
