# $10,000 grant for LGBCC, women
## 'Gay Liberation' statue reinstalled 
### Beth Berselli Staff writer 
The Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual
Community Center and the
Women's Center will each receive
a $10,000 grant for a variety of
program improvements, Dean of
Students Michael Jackson said
yesterday.
Although LGBCC adviser Troy
Gilbert attributed the increased
funding partly to last May's van
dalism of the "Gay Liberation"
sculpture, Jackson said funding
for the LGBCC has been one of the
University's ongoing concerns.
The money will fund student

speaker positions among other im
provements.
The white sculpture, which was
removed from its site near the
Physics Tank on Sept. 6 for
restoration, was reinstalled with
out ceremony on Friday morning
amid downpours — more than
four months after six Stanford
athletes allegedly vandalized it.
Despite the widespread outcry
following the vandalism, Jackson
said the funding is more a part of
the University's commitment to
the LGBCC than a response to any
one incident.

the funding is

Though Jackson said he
believes the new funding and
vandalism are separate issues, he
said he was glad to see the return
last Friday of the "Gay Libera
tion" statue. He also expressed
hope that there won't be any fur
ther vandalism of Stanford art
work.
At Friday's reinstallation of
the "Gay Liberation" statue,
Stanford Museum officials, a few
representatives from the LGBCC
and members of the media
watched as the four figures were
secured to the two benches and to
the cement pad that serves as the
sculpture's base.
Although the vandalism of the
sculpture was a negative event,
Gilbert said, he has seen several
positive things come out of the
incident, such as increased stu
dent awareness about lesbian, gay
and bisexual issues and additional
University support for the
LGBCC.
Junior Nicole Walden, a staff
member at the LGBCC, called the
statue's return "reassuring."
"Part of me feels like it's time
to move on, but what the incident
represented is still present at
Stanford," she said. "Maybe it's
time to move beyond reacting to
the actual incident and start
improving the general climate on
campus toward lesbian, gay and
bisexual students."
Gilbert said he would personal
ly like to see the community put
the incident behind it and move
on to new issues.
The sculpture's restoration

was performed by objects conser
vator Tracy Power and two other
professionals, who consulted with
sculptor George Segal in order to
recreate the statue's original
color and design.
The restoration work involved
intensive labor and special tech
nologies, including stripping the
damaged painted surfaces of the
bronze figures and the benches,
said Hilarie Faberman, curator of
modern and contemporary art at
the Stanford Museum.
If found guilty, the athletes —
who allegedly poured black paint
on the statue and rammed a
bench between the two male fig
ures on May 16 — may foot the
bill for the more than $9,000 in
repairs and restoration work.
According to Judici&l Affairs
Officer Sally Cole, the athletes
have been disciplined by the Uni
versity. Cole, cannot coment on
that action, however, as Universi
ty disaplinary action is confiden
tial In addition, they are current
ly facing criminal charges in
Santa Clara County courts.
The sculpture has been defaced
four times since its installation a
decade ago, said Susan Roberts-
Manganelli, director of registra
tion and conservation at the Stan
ford Museum.
"We hope this will be the last
time it has to be replaced,"
Roberts-Manganelli said. "All the
press and the students being .. .
sent off to court really made a
statement about the value of this
statue to the community in gener
al, not just the lesbian, gay and
bisexual community."

the funding is

on its way.
Though Jackson said he
believes the new funding and
vandalism are separate issues, he
said he was glad to see the return
last Friday of the "Gay Libera
tion" statue. He also expressed
hope that there won't be any fur
ther vandalism of Stanford art
work.
At Friday's reinstallation of
the "Gay Liberation" statue,
Stanford Museum officials, a few
representatives from the LGBCC
and members of the media
watched as the four figures were
secured to the two benches and to
the cement pad that serves as the
sculpture's base.
Although the vandalism of the
sculpture was a negative event,
Gilbert said, he has seen several
positive things come out of the
incident, such as increased stu
dent awareness about lesbian, gay
and bisexual issues and additional
University support for the
LGBCC.
Junior Nicole Walden, a staff
member at the LGBCC, called the
statue's return "reassuring."
"Part of me feels like it's time
to move on, but what the incident
represented is still present at
Stanford," she said. "Maybe it's
time to move beyond reacting to
the actual incident and start
improving the general climate on
campus toward lesbian, gay and
bisexual students."
Gilbert said he would personal
ly like to see the community put
the incident behind it and move
on to new issues.
The sculpture's restoration

was performed by objects conser
vator Tracy Power and two other
professionals, who consulted with
sculptor George Segal in order to
recreate the statue's original
color and design.
The restoration work involved
intensive labor and special tech
nologies, including stripping the
damaged painted surfaces of the
bronze figures and the benches,
said Hilarie Faberman, curator of
modern and contemporary art at
the Stanford Museum.
If found guilty, the athletes —
who allegedly poured black paint
on the statue and rammed a
bench between the two male fig
ures on May 16 — may foot the
bill for the more than $9,000 in
repairs and restoration work.
According to Judici&l Affairs
Officer Sally Cole, the athletes
have been disciplined by the Uni
versity. Cole, cannot coment on
that action, however, as Universi
ty disaplinary action is confiden
tial In addition, they are current
ly facing criminal charges in
Santa Clara County courts.
The sculpture has been defaced
four times since its installation a
decade ago, said Susan Roberts-
Manganelli, director of registra
tion and conservation at the Stan
ford Museum.
"We hope this will be the last
time it has to be replaced,"
Roberts-Manganelli said. "All the
press and the students being .. .
sent off to court really made a
statement about the value of this
statue to the community in gener
al, not just the lesbian, gay and
bisexual community."
