# Creating an 'outward vision'
## New Haas position will unify on-campus service 
### Marc Lee Staff writer 
The Haas Center for Public Service is
doing some reaching out of its own.
After a University-wide search, Haas
Center Director Tim Stanton named
recent graduate John Newsome to the
new position of student community orga
nizer.
The newly created post was designed to
coordinate service efforts throughout the
entire University community — replacing
the position of volunteer coordinator, who
advised groups strictly within the Haas
Center.
The change is a response to messages
from neighboring communities that cam
pus service groups should be better coor
dinated, Stanton said. More importantly,
it was spurred by the experience of previ
ous volunteer coordinators, who saw a
need for expansion of their roles.
Newsome, who received a bachelor's in
Spanish and a master's in modern thought
and literature from Stanford, said that
"the [student community organizer] posi
tion prioritizes communication with other
service organizations on campus" and has
much more of an "outward vision" than
the previous position.
Because an increasing number of stu
dent groups on campus are carrying out
service projects, "there was a need, we
felt, to focus . . . attention on stronger col
laboration between these groups," Stan
ton said.
Newsome, he added, will "find ways to
get different groups to get to know each
other and support each other." New
some's service background and close ties
to several campus communities — many
of which he is still involved with — will aid
him in his new post, Stanton said.
"One of the traits that made him (New
some) particularly attractive was that he
was already knowledgeable of many dif
ferent groups," Stanton said. "He
expressed a willingness to jump across
lines and build bridges."
Last year, Newsome worked as a resi
dent assistant in Donner. During his
Stanford career, Newsome played violin

'I will develop projects
that will encourage us
to collaborate more and
bring everyone to the
table.'

with the Stanford Symphony, was
involved with the lesbian, gay and bisexu
al community and worked at the Bridge.
Newsome said his goal is "to institu
tionalize relations between Haas and ser
vice communities."
"More pragmatically," he said, "I will
develop projects that will encourage us to
collaborate more and bring everyone to
the table."
Newsome's strategy includes develop
ing ways to keep service groups better
informed of each other's activities, mini
mize overlap and increase pooling of
resources.
"One community service organization
doesn't know what the other is doing," he
said, suggesting solutions like an all-cam
pus newsletter.
Newsome also hopes to focus on diver
sity issues within the Haas Center to
ensure "that the Haas community is more
representative of the Stanford communi
ty," he said.
He said he would like to start by devel
oping programs that are "more inclusive"
and relevant to more campus groups —
like students of color, the lesbian, gay and
bisexual community and the graduate stu
dent body.
Newsome will serve as student commu
nity organizer for two years, contingent
upon renewal after one year. While the
volunteer coordinator was a one-year posi
tion, the longer term will allow Newsome
to help establish stronger ties between the
Haas Center and the campus service
groups, he said.
