# Another cougar sighting?
## Mountain lion reportedly seen roaming near the Dish 
### Sarah Katz Editorial staff 
Two weeks after a mountain lion was spotted
walking through the bed of Lake Lagunita, Stanford
Police responded to reports of another cougar
allegedly sighted yesterday near the Dish.
Police investigated the area where the animal was
supposedly sighted — a woodsy spot at the top of a
footpath leading from the intersection of Stanford
Avenue and Junipero Serra Boulevard to the Dish —
around 11 a.m. Sunday morning, but Love said an
hour-and-a-half delay in reporting the incident
meant that police were too late to find anything.
"We heard this third hand — a lady walking in
the foothills told another man she had seen a moun

tain lion sitting under some trees," said Sgt. Philip
Love.
Police did not know the name of the woman and
that the man who reported the alleged sighting
"wasn't particularly concerned," Love said.
He did not think the recent increase in cougar
sightings merits great concern, he said, adding that
it may be an increase in reports rather than an
increase in the spottings themselves.
He also said he doubted any action would be
taken by agencies like the Fish and Game Depart
ment unless the lion "shows inordinate interest in
getting close to people."
Meanwhile, Love said, police are simply "keeping
an eye 0ut.... We're asking people to notify ua u
they see the animal," he said.
