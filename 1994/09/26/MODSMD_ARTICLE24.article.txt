Arizona 34

"Whose house?"
"Cats' House!"
Amid the wreckage of last Sat
urday's 34-10 loss at the hands of
the Arizona Wildcats, this procla
mation sprang forth from the
lungs of several Arizona players
as they left the field.
Indeed, the No. 8 Wildcats had
turned Stanford Stadium into
their house on Saturday as they
capitalized on numerous Stanford
mistakes and physically pounded
the Cardinal into submission with
a emotionally-charged, relentless
defense.
"We tried to play head-to-head
and it couldn't be done," head
coach Bill Walsh said. "We're just
not there yet."
Just two minutes into the
game, the Cardinal looked to be in
over its head as Arizona safety
Brandon Sanders intercepted a
Steve Stenstrom pass on Stan
ford's first drive. While the
defense forced the Wildcats to
punt, sophomore Leroy Pruitt
fumbled the return at his own 17-
yard line, and Stanford had sud
denly turned the ball over twice in
the first two minutes, seven sec
onds of the game.
Bouncing off tacklers around

the left side, Wildcat Ontiwaun
Carter scored on a 10-yard run to
put Arizona up 7-0 after the
Pruitt fumble. Six minutes later,
Dan White connected with
Richard Dice for a 14-yard touch
down pass and Arizona had
jumped ahead 14-0 before Stan
ford had even gotten the ball
across the 50-yard line.
"Arizona outmanned us and
outplayed us," Walsh said. "Right
now we're trying to stretch our
personnel to get things done."
The Cardinal coaching staffs
abilities were quickly put to the
test when Stanford lost last
week's Pacific 10 Conference
offensive and defensive players of
the week to injury. Junior defen
sive end Pete Swanson and sopho
more running back Mike Mitchell
went down in the first quarter.
After the loss of Mitchell, Stan
ford all but abandoned its run
ning game, playing right into the
waiting arms of the Arizona
defense. Stenstrom faced pres
sure all afternoon, and while he
displayed remarkable mobility
when flushed out of the pocket,
the Wildcats still managed to sack
him seven times for 49 yards.
Taking it to the air, Stenstrom
turned in a strong performance
despite the constant threat of Ari
zona's Desert Swarm defense. He
completed 26-of-43 passes for 295
yards and one touchdown, while
he was intercepted twice.
"Stenstrom played a terrifical
ly courageous and brave game,"
Walsh said. "Boy, does he have a
heart."
Unlike the Cardinal offense,

Arizona had little trouble moving
up and down the field on the
ground. The revolving backfield
of Carter and Gary Taylor com
bined for 137 yards rushing on 36
carries, giving the Wildcats fresh
legs to run their ball-control
offense.
"You're playing two defenses,
basically," said senior linebacker
Coy Gibbs. "They're tough on
both sides of the ball. All they try
to do is cram it down your
throat."
Overall, Arizona forced four
turnovers, compared to one by
Stanford's defense. Combining
great team speed with a carefully
crafted defensive game plan and
"extraordinary enthusiasm"
according to Arizona head coach
Dick Tomey, the Wildcats gave a
collective headache to Stanford's
offensive line.
"They [Arizona's defense] have
a smart scheme," senior offensive
tackle Seth Dittman said. "You
may shut them off the first sever
al plays, but pretty soon they
start picking up on how your
blocking scheme works. They're
pretty smart about calling stunts
and blitzes and attacking your
weaknesses."
And judging by Saturday's
results, the Wildcat defense
seemed like a group of Rhodes
Scholars based on how often they
blew past Cardinal linemen and
knifed into the Stanford back
field. In all, it held Cardinal run
ners to six rushing yards for the
game. Nose guard Chuck Osborne
led the way with three sacks and
four total tackles behind the line
of scrimmage, pushing Stanford
back 22 yards.
After spotting Arizona 14
points, the Cardinal appeared
ready to jump back into the game,
churning out a ten-play drive
down to the Wildcat five-yard
line. However, the Fates again
turned against the home team as
junior Eric Abrams' 23-yard field
goal was blocked and returned to
the Arizona 41-yard line. Eight
plays later, Carter dashod into the
endzone untouched from three
yards out to put the Wildcats up
21-0.
Arizona's defense did not let
up after that as it forced another
Stanford turnover. This time, All-
American Tedi Bruschi blasted
into Stenstrom, knocking the ball
loose on the Cardinal 19-yard
line. The Wildcats recovered and
quickly converted the Stanford

miscue into three more points on a
31-yard field goal by Steve
McLaughlin.
Stanford again appeared as if it
might sneak back into the game
with an impressive 67-yard touch
down drive highlighted by two
Stenstrom scrambles and a 24-
yard pass to senior wide receiver
Justin Armour. Stenstrom found
senior tight end Tony Cline in the
endzone for the three-yard touch
down pass, putting the Cardinal on
the scoreboard for the first time.
After adding a 42-yard Abrams
field goal late in the third quarter,

Stanford had pulled within two
touchdowns at 24-10. However,
any emotion the Cardinal had was
checked by a 53-yard field goal by
McLaughlin.
"I think that was the play that
made the biggest difference,"
Tomey said.
Stanford's last real chance to
challenge the Wildcats disap
peared in the arms of Arizona
safety Tony Bouie, who intercept
ed a Stenstrom pass and returned
it 49 yards for the Wildcats' final
score.
"Teams like Arizona play with
emotion for all 60 minutes, and we
seem to lose it when things go
wrong," sophomore safety Scott
Frost said. "We have to play like
champions and stop doing that."

Arizona 34

"Whose house?"
"Cats' House!"
Amid the wreckage of last Sat
urday's 34-10 loss at the hands of
the Arizona Wildcats, this procla
mation sprang forth from the
lungs of several Arizona players
as they left the field.
Indeed, the No. 8 Wildcats had
turned Stanford Stadium into
their house on Saturday as they
capitalized on numerous Stanford
mistakes and physically pounded
the Cardinal into submission with
a emotionally-charged, relentless
defense.
"We tried to play head-to-head
and it couldn't be done," head
coach Bill Walsh said. "We're just
not there yet."
Just two minutes into the
game, the Cardinal looked to be in
over its head as Arizona safety
Brandon Sanders intercepted a
Steve Stenstrom pass on Stan
ford's first drive. While the
defense forced the Wildcats to
punt, sophomore Leroy Pruitt
fumbled the return at his own 17-
yard line, and Stanford had sud
denly turned the ball over twice in
the first two minutes, seven sec
onds of the game.
Bouncing off tacklers around

the left side, Wildcat Ontiwaun
Carter scored on a 10-yard run to
put Arizona up 7-0 after the
Pruitt fumble. Six minutes later,
Dan White connected with
Richard Dice for a 14-yard touch
down pass and Arizona had
jumped ahead 14-0 before Stan
ford had even gotten the ball
across the 50-yard line.
"Arizona outmanned us and
outplayed us," Walsh said. "Right
now we're trying to stretch our
personnel to get things done."
The Cardinal coaching staffs
abilities were quickly put to the
test when Stanford lost last
week's Pacific 10 Conference
offensive and defensive players of
the week to injury. Junior defen
sive end Pete Swanson and sopho
more running back Mike Mitchell
went down in the first quarter.
After the loss of Mitchell, Stan
ford all but abandoned its run
ning game, playing right into the
waiting arms of the Arizona
defense. Stenstrom faced pres
sure all afternoon, and while he
displayed remarkable mobility
when flushed out of the pocket,
the Wildcats still managed to sack
him seven times for 49 yards.
Taking it to the air, Stenstrom
turned in a strong performance
despite the constant threat of Ari
zona's Desert Swarm defense. He
completed 26-of-43 passes for 295
yards and one touchdown, while
he was intercepted twice.
"Stenstrom played a terrifical
ly courageous and brave game,"
Walsh said. "Boy, does he have a
heart."
Unlike the Cardinal offense,

Arizona had little trouble moving
up and down the field on the
ground. The revolving backfield
of Carter and Gary Taylor com
bined for 137 yards rushing on 36
carries, giving the Wildcats fresh
legs to run their ball-control
offense.
"You're playing two defenses,
basically," said senior linebacker
Coy Gibbs. "They're tough on
both sides of the ball. All they try
to do is cram it down your
throat."
Overall, Arizona forced four
turnovers, compared to one by
Stanford's defense. Combining
great team speed with a carefully
crafted defensive game plan and
"extraordinary enthusiasm"
according to Arizona head coach
Dick Tomey, the Wildcats gave a
collective headache to Stanford's
offensive line.
"They [Arizona's defense] have
a smart scheme," senior offensive
tackle Seth Dittman said. "You
may shut them off the first sever
al plays, but pretty soon they
start picking up on how your
blocking scheme works. They're
pretty smart about calling stunts
and blitzes and attacking your
weaknesses."
And judging by Saturday's
results, the Wildcat defense
seemed like a group of Rhodes
Scholars based on how often they
blew past Cardinal linemen and
knifed into the Stanford back
field. In all, it held Cardinal run
ners to six rushing yards for the
game. Nose guard Chuck Osborne
led the way with three sacks and
four total tackles behind the line
of scrimmage, pushing Stanford
back 22 yards.
After spotting Arizona 14
points, the Cardinal appeared
ready to jump back into the game,
churning out a ten-play drive
down to the Wildcat five-yard
line. However, the Fates again
turned against the home team as
junior Eric Abrams' 23-yard field
goal was blocked and returned to
the Arizona 41-yard line. Eight
plays later, Carter dashod into the
endzone untouched from three
yards out to put the Wildcats up
21-0.
Arizona's defense did not let
up after that as it forced another
Stanford turnover. This time, All-
American Tedi Bruschi blasted
into Stenstrom, knocking the ball
loose on the Cardinal 19-yard
line. The Wildcats recovered and
quickly converted the Stanford

miscue into three more points on a
31-yard field goal by Steve
McLaughlin.
Stanford again appeared as if it
might sneak back into the game
with an impressive 67-yard touch
down drive highlighted by two
Stenstrom scrambles and a 24-
yard pass to senior wide receiver
Justin Armour. Stenstrom found
senior tight end Tony Cline in the
endzone for the three-yard touch
down pass, putting the Cardinal on
the scoreboard for the first time.
After adding a 42-yard Abrams
field goal late in the third quarter,

Stanford had pulled within two
touchdowns at 24-10. However,
any emotion the Cardinal had was
checked by a 53-yard field goal by
McLaughlin.
"I think that was the play that
made the biggest difference,"
Tomey said.
Stanford's last real chance to
challenge the Wildcats disap
peared in the arms of Arizona
safety Tony Bouie, who intercept
ed a Stenstrom pass and returned
it 49 yards for the Wildcats' final
score.
