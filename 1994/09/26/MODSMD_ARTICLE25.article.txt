Bears ,;.;0

After a rash of injuries to
key players, a three-game home
winning streak was just what
the doctor ordered for the
fourth-ranked Stanford wo
men's soccer team.
Consecutive 3-1 victories
over San Diego State and Uni
versity of the Pacific moved the
Cardinal to 5-0 on the year
before yesterday's Pacific 10
Conference opener against Cal

ifornia.
The Golden Bears battled
Stanford to a scoreless tie
through the first half, ending a
streak of seven straight halves
with at least one goal for the
Cardinal. In the 63rd minute,
sophomore forward Erin Mar
tin broke the deadlock with a
beautiful left-footed strike into
the upper left corner of the net.
Martin's team-leading fifth
goal of the year would be all the
offense Stanford needed to
defeat Cal, which dropped to 2-
4 overall and 0-2 in the Pac-10.
The Cardinal out-shot Cal
26-7 as senior goalkeeper Jen
nifer Poehler earned her third
shutout of the year and first in
three games.
