Bears ,;.;0

After a rash of injuries to
key players, a three-game home
winning streak was just what
the doctor ordered for the
fourth-ranked Stanford wo
men's soccer team.
Consecutive 3-1 victories
over San Diego State and Uni
versity of the Pacific moved the
Cardinal to 5-0 on the year
before yesterday's Pacific 10
Conference opener against Cal

ifornia.
The Golden Bears battled
Stanford to a scoreless tie
through the first half, ending a
streak of seven straight halves
with at least one goal for the
Cardinal. In the 63rd minute,
sophomore forward Erin Mar
tin broke the deadlock with a
beautiful left-footed strike into
the upper left corner of the net.
Martin's team-leading fifth
goal of the year would be all the
offense Stanford needed to
defeat Cal, which dropped to 2-
4 overall and 0-2 in the Pac-10.
The Cardinal out-shot Cal
26-7 as senior goalkeeper Jen
nifer Poehler earned her third
shutout of the year and first in
three games.

Sophomore forward Erin Martin prepares to slash past Cal
defenders during yesterday's 1-0 victory over the Golden
Bears.
Though the offense has been
overpowering in only one of the
six games this year, Martin said
the scoring attack has been ade
quate.
"We've got a bunch of people
playing new positions," Martin
said. "There are some things we
have to work on, but we're doing
pretty well."
Indeed, due to injuries, the
starting lineup had a new look, as
junior Julie Bushman, a transfer
from UC-Santa Barbara, made
her first start at forward after 19
for the Gauchos last year. Sopho
more Wendy Latimer made her
second consecutive start in the
backfield, and sophomore
Danielle Hamacher opened in the
midfield, filling in for Murphy

who was sidelined with a broken
nose. Sophomore Mandy Tucker
was called in to replace freshman
midfielder Rita Hermiz, who also
fell prey to an injury.
Most of the line-up changes
were unveiled in Friday's victory
over Pacific (0-6-1 overall). Little
used Hamacher made the most of
her foray into the starting line-up,
scoring the first two goals of her
career.
"It was the first time I've
played halfback for Stanford,"
said Hamacher, who started at
that position in high school. "I
was really happy to get the chance
to start. It's not a big adjustment,
but the game situations are differ
ent."
Hamacher opened the scoring
at 18 minutes, 16 seconds on
junior forward Vicky Haring's
first assist of the year. Pacific's
Dana Vasquez forced the Cardinal
to pay for a rare defensive mishap

three minutes before halftime to
even the score at 1-1.
Stanford, who had completely
dominated the first half with 21
shots on goal compared to the
Tiger's three, pulled away in the
second half. Pre-season Ail-Amer
ican Jessica Fischer scored for the
second time this season with a
direct free kick at 49:03. Hamach
er provided the insurance within
the last eight minutes to cement
the 3-1 triumph.
The Stanford defense was suf
focating throughout, as Poehler
made only one save for the fourth
time in five games. Pacific did not
manage a single shot in the sec
ond half.
Santa Clara was expected to
provide a far stiffer test for the
Cardinal on September 18. The
traditional power entered the con
test with a No. 12 ranking but
never got on track against Stan
ford.

Only 9:06 had passed when
sophomore forward Emily Burt
notched her fourth goal of the
season, heading in a cross by Her
miz. Both defenses continued to
shine until Martin scored from
the top of the box only 29 seconds
into the second half. At 77:41,
senior fullback Melinda Minstrell
found a loose ball and registered
her first goal of the season to put
the game well out of reach. Santa
Clara's Ashley Albrecht spoiled
the shutout five minutes later
after a pass from Jennifer Lolar.
The 6-0 start gives Stanford a
14-game undefeated streak dating
to last October 17. The Cardinal
now hopes for similar success at
fighting the injury bug, which has
set back nearly a quarter of the
roster.
Three-year starter Leslie Gar
rard, who had never missed a
game in her career until this cam
paign, has yet to play due to a sep

arated shoulder, but is expected to
return within the next couple of
weeks. Also missing are sopho
more midfielder Alyze Lowen,
senior Laura Wilkes, and senior
Anna Patitucci, who have all suf
fered knee injuries.
Lowen has already undergone
arthroscopic surgery and will sit
out the season. Wilkes is also side
lined after tearing her anterior
cruciate ligament while Patitucci
is out of action after tearing carti
lage in her knee. Suzie Boots, who
started 20 games at fullback in
1993 as a freshman, is off the field
due to mononucleosis. Finally,
Murphy hopes to return to action
soon after a broken nose.
Fischer said that the line-up
changes have not been a problem,
however.
"It hasn't been a major adjust
ment at all, really," the junior said.
"Everybody has stepped up and
molded into their positions well."

Cardinal 1

Bears ,;.;0

After a rash of injuries to
key players, a three-game home
winning streak was just what
the doctor ordered for the
fourth-ranked Stanford wo
men's soccer team.
Consecutive 3-1 victories
over San Diego State and Uni
versity of the Pacific moved the
Cardinal to 5-0 on the year
before yesterday's Pacific 10
Conference opener against Cal

ifornia.
The Golden Bears battled
Stanford to a scoreless tie
through the first half, ending a
streak of seven straight halves
with at least one goal for the
Cardinal. In the 63rd minute,
sophomore forward Erin Mar
tin broke the deadlock with a
beautiful left-footed strike into
the upper left corner of the net.
Martin's team-leading fifth
goal of the year would be all the
offense Stanford needed to
defeat Cal, which dropped to 2-
4 overall and 0-2 in the Pac-10.
The Cardinal out-shot Cal
26-7 as senior goalkeeper Jen
nifer Poehler earned her third
shutout of the year and first in
three games.


Teressa Trusty — Daily
Sophomore forward Erin Martin prepares to slash past Cal
defenders during yesterday's 1-0 victory over the Golden
Bears.
Though the offense has been
overpowering in only one of the
six games this year, Martin said
the scoring attack has been ade
quate.
"We've got a bunch of people
playing new positions," Martin
said. "There are some things we
have to work on, but we're doing
pretty well."
Indeed, due to injuries, the
starting lineup had a new look, as
junior Julie Bushman, a transfer
from UC-Santa Barbara, made
her first start at forward after 19
for the Gauchos last year. Sopho
more Wendy Latimer made her
second consecutive start in the
backfield, and sophomore
Danielle Hamacher opened in the
midfield, filling in for Murphy

who was sidelined with a broken
nose. Sophomore Mandy Tucker
was called in to replace freshman
midfielder Rita Hermiz, who also
fell prey to an injury.
Most of the line-up changes
were unveiled in Friday's victory
over Pacific (0-6-1 overall). Little
used Hamacher made the most of
her foray into the starting line-up,
scoring the first two goals of her
career.
"It was the first time I've
played halfback for Stanford,"
said Hamacher, who started at
that position in high school. "I
was really happy to get the chance
to start. It's not a big adjustment,
but the game situations are differ
ent."
Hamacher opened the scoring
at 18 minutes, 16 seconds on
junior forward Vicky Haring's
first assist of the year. Pacific's
Dana Vasquez forced the Cardinal
to pay for a rare defensive mishap

three minutes before halftime to
even the score at 1-1.
Stanford, who had completely
dominated the first half with 21
shots on goal compared to the
Tiger's three, pulled away in the
second half. Pre-season Ail-Amer
ican Jessica Fischer scored for the
second time this season with a
direct free kick at 49:03. Hamach
er provided the insurance within
the last eight minutes to cement
the 3-1 triumph.
The Stanford defense was suf
focating throughout, as Poehler
made only one save for the fourth
time in five games. Pacific did not
manage a single shot in the sec
ond half.
Santa Clara was expected to
provide a far stiffer test for the
Cardinal on September 18. The
traditional power entered the con
test with a No. 12 ranking but
never got on track against Stan
ford.
