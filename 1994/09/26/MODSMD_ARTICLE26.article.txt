# Mistakes and injuries twist Cardinal's fate
## 
### Kyle Utsumi Staff writer 
Many foreigners who come to the United States
never fully understand American football. It's
played with such a funny ball, one that takes such
odd bounces.
Saturday at Stanford Stadium against No. 8 Ari
zona, the football was bouncing in all directions, but
rarely in one the Cardinal would have liked to see.
On a day filled with all sorts of twists hindering
Stanford, it did not take long for the mistakes and
unfortunate injuries to begin.
During the game's third play from scrimmage,
Cardinal quarterback Steve Stenstrom was inter
cepted for the first time this season by Wildcat safe
ty Brandon Sanders. The Stanford defense respond
ed by stopping two running plays for a total of four
yards, and tipped a third down pass to force Arizona
to punt.
But on the ensuing return, that funny-shaped
ball bobbled out of the hands of returner Leroy

Pruitt and into the open arms of Arizona's Kevin
Gosar. The ball was recovered at the Stanford 14-
yard line, bringing the defensive unit back onto the
field.
Three plays later, Wildcat tailback Ontiwaun
Carter was celebrating in the end zone after a 10
yard touchdown run.
For the Cardinal, the scenario was all too famil
iar. . --y.
Two weeks ago at Northwestern, Stanford's
defense made a similar early-game stop, only to lose
the ball on a fumbled punt return. The early
turnover in Chicago's Soldier Field also resulted in a
quick score by the opposition.
When asked about his team's mistakes, head
coach Bill Walsh explained, "I'm not surprised.
We've been busy working on those things and a lot
of things went wrong, but we have young players."
However, Walsh felt differently about these
errors resulting in undeserved points for the opposi-

tion: "It's a shocker. It really
hurts. It happened to us in the first
game and it happened again
today."
After the Wildcats scored off a
turnover inside Stanford's 20-yard
line, the Cardinal found itself in
the unenviable position of playing
catch-up against one of the
nation's strongest defenses.
Stenstrom agreed that Stanford
seemed to prevent itself from dig
ging out of a hole early on. "We
stopped ourselves a couple of
times," he said. "We didn't come
through when we had to. We were
moving the ball, but we didn't get
points on the board."
The Cardinal was still empty
handed after an attempted 23-yard
field goal by kicker Eric Abrams
was blocked and returned 28 yards
by Arizona to their own 41. The
play also set up the Wildcat's third
touchdown for a 21-0 lead with 10
minutes left in the first half.
Senior Justin Armour also
expressed frustration at the way
mistakes have run the Cardinal
afoul.
"I only have eight games left
here — to blow a couple (games)
like that hurts," he said. "Playing
college football is a once in a life

time opportunity. It's just not as
fun a game when you beat your
self. Arizona beat us in the end,
but when you beat yourself (early),
that's just dumb."
While many of the crucial mis
takes were made on the offensive
side of the ball, the defense was not
content with their performance,
either.
"We made some big plays, but
there were let downs," said fresh
man safety Chris Draft. "We
should have stopped more than we
did — we just didn't tackle. We
played hard, but not hard enough
to win."
The disappointments for Stan
ford were not limited to turnovers
and missed assignments. The Car
dinal was also hit hard by injuries,
beginning early in the game. Stan
ford lost starting right-end Pete
Swanson three minutes into the
game, and later in the first quarter
lost the services of running back
Mike Mitchell.
Other Stanford players who
may be questionable for next
week's game at Notre Dame
include center T.J. Gaynor (elbow),
fullback Adam Salina (right shoul
der bruise) and running back Quin
cy Jacobs (pinched nerve).
The Wildcat victory taught the
depleted Cardinal some valuable
lessons, but offered little consolation.
Sometimes, that's just the way
the ball bounces.
