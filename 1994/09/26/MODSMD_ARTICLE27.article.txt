Cardinal 11

Bears 12

After beating top-ranked and
defending national champion Stan
ford 12-11 in overtime on Satur
day, No. 3 California affirmed that
there will be a battle for the NCAA
championship in November.
In front of a large and boister
ous pre-football crowd at Spieker
Aquatics Complex at Berkeley, the
Golden Bears (8-1) handed the Car
dinal (6-1) its first loss of the sea
son.
"We certainly scored enough
goals to win the game," said head
coach Dante Dettamanti, noting
that the team strives to score at
least nine goals in order to clinch a
contest. "We just didn't play great
defense."
Finishing regulation play tied at
10, the Bay Area rivals continued
their sea battle over two three
minute overtime periods. Cal took
the first lead of overtime when
junior Ryan Weir found the net
with one minute, 18 seconds left in
the first extra period.
In the second period of over
time, Stanford junior Jeremy
Laster answered by scoring his
fifth goal with 1:18 to go in the
game. The Golden Bears had the
final say, however, when junior
Nick Kittredge sealed the match
with just 45 seconds remaining.
The game was tight throughout,
as the two teams consistently trad
ed goals back and forth. The score
was tied 10 times during the game,
as well as at the end of each quarter.
The performances by both goal
tenders were imbalanced, which
became clear factors in the teams'
final outcomes. Cal goaltender

Sean Nolan made an impact for the
Golden Bears with 12 saves, includ
ing several in the overtime periods.
Cardinal Jack Bowen, however,
had uncharacteristically few saves
with five, his lowest game total
this year.
"(Cal] had goals going in that
normally don't," Dettamanti said.
"We also didn't play well on the
man-up situations, and this was
clearly the difference."
In these six-on-five defensive
situations, Stanford normally
holds opponents to only 30 percent
scoring. However, Cal scored four
out of six times when in this posi
tion. The Cardinal, usually 60 per
cent successful at scoring in man
up situations, found the goal only
once out of four chances.
The offense, however, "had an

excellent game" according to Detta
manti. Stanford's high-powered
attack was led by Laster, who
scored five points including one
two-pointer. Sophomore holeman
Brian Wallin scored three times,
and the Cardinal's goal output was
rounded out by junior Brian Pyle
and senior captains Frank Schnei
der and Wolf Wigo, who scored
once apiece.
Cal coach Steve Heaston was
pleased with the way his team
stayed strong throughout the
match.
"Both teams showed it is still
early in the season," said Heaston.
"But for us, this was the first
match this year in which we came
together and stayed focused the
whole game."
Similar to last year, the win for

California makes the question of
who is tops in the nation difficult to
answer. Earlier this season, No. 2
USC defeated the Golden Bears
handily. Stanford proceeded to dis
mantle the Trojans 15-11 on Sept.
11, but with Cal's victory over the
Cardinal, the picture becomes
cloudier.
The three teams finished in the
top three spots at the 1993 NCAA
Tournament, with Stanford defeat
ing USC in the finals and Cal beat
ing UC-Irvine in the third-place
game.
"The top three teams are very
close," said sophomore Daniel
Lehoczky. "Everybody was mad
about this loss, but the season is
long. We will have several more
opportunities to play Cal this year.
They are beatable."
