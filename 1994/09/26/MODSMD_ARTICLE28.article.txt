It took an opponent that actually doesn't exist to
give the No. 1 Stanford women's volleyball team
some much needed competition.
The Cardinal had its toughest match yet last Fri
day night at Maples Pavilion against a team com
prised of former Stanford volleyball standouts. For
the first time this season, Stanford was forced to
play a fifth and deciding game before taking the

match 10-15, 15-8, 15-7, 12-15, 15-13.
While the mention of the word alumni might con
jure up images of old and out of shape ex-jocks huff
ing and puffing their way across the court for one
last hurrah, that was not the case with this bunch.
I he Department of Athletics and the women's vol
leyball program brought back some of Stanford's
most talented spikers from the past to participate in
the contest.
Among them was Kim Oden (Class of '86), one of
the most dominant players on the professional four
women tour. She was captain of the '88 and '92 U.S.
Olympic squads and helped the U.S. National Team
take the silver medal at the Goodwill Games this
past summer. Bev Oden (Class of '93), Kim's sister,
is a starter on the National Team and helped lead
the Cardinal to a 1992 national championship.
Kristin Klein (Class of '92), also a National Team
member, is the school's career leader in kills and

digs. These three women hold four NCAA Player of
the Year awards between them.
Also joining the alumni team were National
Team member Amy Cooper (Class of '92),
Women's Professional Volleyball Association star
and president Barbra Fontana (Class of '87), 1986
Pacific 10 Conference Player of the Year Teresa
Smith (Class of '86), and last year's starting setter
Piper Hahn.
"This is a formidable group," said Stanford head
coach Don Shaw. "If you were going to assemble our
all-time all-star team, this would be it. We got a
good test against a real good opponent — something
we didn't get against the Washington schools last
week."
The alumni jumped out to a quick 13-5 lead
before the varsity squad battled back to make it 13-
10. However, the alumni lineup of Hahn, Klein,
Cooper, Richardson, Fontana and Bev Oden was

iust too strong, and the alumni took the first game
15-10.
Shaw used a different lineup in the second game,
and it worked. Juniors Cary Wendell, Maureen
McLaren and Wendy Hromadka, sophomores
Eileen Murfee and Nicki Otto and freshman Lisa
Sharp ley were able to capture the second game 15-
8. The varsity also took the third game 15-7 with a
10-2 run.
It looked like it might have been all over for the
alumni in the fourth game when they trailed 8-6.
But Bev Oden went back to serve and the older gen
eration rallied to make it 10-8. When they extended
the lead to 14-10, Shaw sent freshman Barbara Ife
jika onto the court to join her classmates Kristin
Folkl, Debbie Lambert and Sharpley, fielding all
four of Stanford's world-class recruits on the floor
at the same time. Although
this combination enabled the
varsity to hold off defeat for a
short time, they eventually fell
15-12.
For the fifth game, Shaw sent
out the lineup that had fallen in
game one. But it looked like this
group, consisting of senior Anne

Wicks, junior Marnie Triefen
bach and Wendell, Sharpley, Ife
jika and Folkl, had learned its les
son.
They led 13-9 and were ready
to pull away when a rotation
error cost them the point and the
ball. The alumni capitalized on
this mistake, and with Cooper
serving, closed to 13-12. Howev
er, the varsity finally regrouped
and took the game 15-13 to win
the match.
