# Washington Cougars and Huskies no match for volleyball
## 
### Seth Goldstein Staff writer 
No problem.
These two words do a fairly
accurate job of summing up the
No. 1 Stanford women's volley
ball team's victories over Wash
ington and 22nd-ranked Wash
ington State on September 15th
and 16th at Maples Pavilion.
By virtue of these wins, the
Cardinal ran its all-time records
against the Huskies and Cougars
to 18-2 and 17-0 respectively.
The Stanford women opened
both their home and Pacific 10
Conference schedules against
Washington on Sept. 1. The Car
dinal came out strong in the first
game, jumping out to a 13-4 lead.
The Huskies tried to fight back,
denying Stanford seven game
points before succumbing 15-8.
But from there on, it was all
Cardinal. Head coach Don Shaw
used 12 of his talented spikers to
overwhelm Washington with his
team's depth and Stanford took
the next two games 15-3 and 15-
6 for the sweep.
Freshman Kristin Folkl led
the way, hitting .444 with 10
kills, nine digs and five blocks
while classmate Barbara Ifejika
hit .750 with seven kills and 10
digs. Junior setter Cary Wendell
had 24 assists to go with nine
kills.
Another freshman, Lisa
Sharpley, also saw time in the
setter position, chipping in with
14 assists and seven kills. Dra
gana Djordevic and Angela Bran
eom provided some bright spots

for the Huskies, coming through
with 11 and 10 kills, respectively.
"Washington was a very big
and talented team," said Shaw.
"They just played very poorly.
I'm sure we had something to do
with that, but they can play bet
ter. They are young and will def
initely improve as the year goes
along."
While Shaw complimented the
Huskies, he had no kind words
for the Cougars, whom the Car
dinal faced the following
evening.
"I expected Washington State
to be much better," Shaw said.
"They looked horrible, playing
out of position on both offense
and defense. And I don't know
how much better they can get."
The Cardinal hit a school
record .557 against the Cougars,
breaking its previous mark of
.519. Stanford used three differ
ent setters, Wendell, Sharpley
and sophomore Catherine Juil
lard, en route to a 15-0, 15-6, 15-
11 victory. The first-game
shutout was the team's first
since a win over California in
November of 1991.
Ifejika hit 1.000 for the
match, with eight kills on eight
swings, to go with five digs. Folkl
hit .875 to boost her season hit
ting percentage to .414, third in
the Pac-10, while Wendell and
junior Marnie Triefenbach both
hit .750. Triefenbach had a
career-high four service aces.
The sweep of Washington
State took a mere 62 minutes.
The Cougars, managing only a
.197 hitting percentage against

the Cardinal defense, had only 11
digs the entire match.
The two victories left the Car
dinal 8-0 overall and 2-0 in the
Pac-10. Stanford currently leads
the conference in hitting per
centage at .294 and in hitting
percentage defense at .136.
Although the wins over the
Washington schools may have
been impressive, they were by no
means enough to satisfy Shaw.
The coach was displeased with

the Cardinal squad's passing and
some defensive lapses in the
third game against the Cougars.
"We're by no means perfect,"
Shaw said, "but we can get away
with it against these poorer
teams. I really don't like victories
like this because they're almost
useless. They don't help expose
our weakness or help us to
improve our game. They just
make us look better than we
are."
