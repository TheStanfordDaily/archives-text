As a result of the May 16 van
dalism of the "Gay Liberation"
sculpture, Santa Clara County
Deputy District Attorney Karyn
Sinunu and Bruce Nickerson, a
San Jose gay rights attorney, are
attempting to broaden Califor
nia's hate crime laws.
Sinunu and Nickerson met last
Tuesday with Assemblyman Byron
Sher, D-Stanford, to discuss expand
ing the statute to include acts aimed
at intimidating a group of people.

Currently, the law is limited to
cases involving individual victims
or a victim's property. Under this
law, prosecutors were unable to
charge the vandalism of the "Gay
Liberation" sculpture as a hate
crime.
"Had the statue been owned by
George Segal (the sculptor), a hate
crime would have been charged,
but it's owned by the University so
it's not chargeable under current
statute," said Nickerson, a Stan
ford alumnus.
