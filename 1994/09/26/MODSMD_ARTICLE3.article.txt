dalism of the "Gay Liberation"
sculpture, Santa Clara County
Deputy District Attorney Karyn
Sinunu and Bruce Nickerson, a
San Jose gay rights attorney, are
attempting to broaden Califor
nia's hate crime laws.
Sinunu and Nickerson met last
Tuesday with Assemblyman Byron
Sher, D-Stanford, to discuss expand
ing the statute to include acts aimed
at intimidating a group of people.

Currently, the law is limited to
cases involving individual victims
or a victim's property. Under this
law, prosecutors were unable to
charge the vandalism of the "Gay
Liberation" sculpture as a hate
crime.
"Had the statue been owned by
George Segal (the sculptor), a hate
crime would have been charged,
but it's owned by the University so
it's not chargeable under current
statute," said Nickerson, a Stan
ford alumnus.

taking the incident very seriously
and would have loved to have it
charged as a hate crime but the
technical language of the statute
prevented that."
The crime had a chilling effect
on gay rights activists every
where, Nickerson said. "The
bashing of the statue sends a mes
sage that if you come out, it's at
your own peril.
"It really was an insidious

crime and clearly motivated by
hate," he added.
According to Nickerson, Sher
agreed at Tuesday's meeting to
take the steps necessary to pursue
changing the statute.
"He said he'll get the ball
rolling," Nickerson said, adding
that the earliest the alteration
could go into effect is 1996.
In the meantime, the district
attorney's office will most likely
sponsor the bill, he said.
