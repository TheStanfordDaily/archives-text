# Field hockey shoots to 2-1 victory
## 
### Ratha Harntha 
Cardinal 2
Tigers 1

After scoring only one goal in
its first six games, head coach
Sheryl Johnson presented a chal
lenge to her field hockey team:
every forward and midfielder
must have at least one shot on
goal. Stanford was up to the task
at University of the Pacific last
Saturday, and the result was a 2-1
victory over the Tigers.
"We put a lot more pressure on
the goal," said senior co-captain
and midfielder Tina Syer, who
assisted on the Cardinal's win
ning score. Stanford finished with
25 shots on goal, 19 of which were
in the circle. Sophomore midfield
er Amy Marfil led the team with
seven shots.
Junior midfielder Elise Mor
gan, in her first full game back
from an injury, scored both goals
for the Cardinal. She was the sec
ond leading scorer on last year's
team, behind Northern Pacific
Conference Player of the Year
Sara Ilallock, who graduated last
year. Morgan played sparingly in
last week's game, a 3-0 loss at Cal
ifornia.
Morgan's first goal came 25
minutes into the first half, when
sophomore Baochi Nguyen passed

the ball across the field on a free
hit to Morgan. Morgan split two
defenders, leaving her one-on-one
with the goalie.
Tiger senior Michele Baker tied
the game with three minutes left
in the first period on a corner play.
Freshman goalie Kelly Naylor got
her left hand on the ball, but not
enough to make the save on
Baker's quick shot.
With 15 minutes, five seconds
left in the game, Morgan scored
the clincher. With the ball in the
circle, Syer fired a shot off Pacific
goalie Kristen Forcina's leg pad.
Forcina was unable to clear the
shot and Morgan took the
rebound and scored. Morgan's
two goals came on only two shots.
"We connected really well,"
said Naylor. "Our aggression and
passing were better and we played
the rebounds well."
The Cardinal defense held up
in the last 15 minutes of the game
to preserve the team's second win
of the season, despite late pres
sure from the Tigers. Stanford
evened its NorPac record at 1-1
and 2-5 overall. Pacific fell to 0-6
overall and 0-2 in NorPac.
"The last minutes were really
strenuous," Naylor said. "But we
were able to overcome the critical
times. Our defense played really
strong."
Naylor finished with 10 saves
and the defense limited the Tigers
to 18 shots, only seven of which
came in the circle. Marfil came up
with some key tackles for the Car-

dinal defense.
"We really picked it up after
the Cal game," Syer said. "The
team didn't let down in practice."
Johnson, too, had nothing but
compliments for her team.
"Everyone played well," she said.

"Everyone played more like a
team. The defense was very
solid."
As Morgan pointed out, howev
er, perhaps the most important
aspect of the victory was the confi
dence it provides.
