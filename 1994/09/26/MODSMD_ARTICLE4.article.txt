# Funding 'la familia'
## El Centro Chicano sets up short-term loan program 
### Frank Guinan Staff writer 
Chicano and Latino students in
a monetary bind now can look to a
new fund sponsored by El Centro
Chicano to help them out with an
emergency loan.
Staff at the center raised
$2,200 through donations from
faculty, staff and off-campus indi
viduals for the new loan fund,
modeled after an existing fund
which serves Native American
students at Stanford.
The program is aimed at help
ing students through small short
term or unexpected financial
problems, said Frances Morales,
director of El Centro. These prob
lems could include the need to buy
school books or purchase food.
The program is for students who
"need a tiny little bit so that they can

worry about classes first," Morales
said. The fund was proposed by
Morales and approved by the Guid
ing Concilio, El Centro's governing
body, earlier this summer.
The Concilio will administer
the interest-free fund, she said,
and the time period to pay back the
loan will be decided on a case-by
case basis.
Morales said she has noticed an
increase in the number of stu
dents coming to her office for help,
and she expects the fund to be
used frequently.
According to Morales, under
graduate and graduate students
who have come to her office for
help in the past were directed to
the Financial Aids Office or to
Dean of Students Michael Jack
son. An informal "student net
work" — students at El Centro
contributing to their peers — also

helped students in need.
With the new fund, El Centro
will encourage students to appeal
to the Financial Aids Office first,
but will act as a lesser resource and
provide emergency "survival
money" when the University is not
in a position to help, Morales said.
El Centro hopes to raise a total
of $5,000 by the end of the acade
mic year through several fund
raising efforts, she said.
As part of the University's de
sire to demonstrate a commitment
to Stanford's ethnic communities,
El Centro was one of four centers
to receive a two-year, $50,000
grant which was announced Sept.
7. Morales, however, said she did
not know if any of that money
could be applied to the emergency
loan program.
"We don't have enough infor
mation . . . [or] any guidelines
yet" as to how to use the Univer
sity grant, she said.
The largest contribution thus
far to the fund comes from Ray
Bacchetti, former vice president
for planning and management at
Stanford, who donated $1,250.
Bacchetti, currently the educa
tion program officer at Hewlett
Foundation, said, "There are
times when someone needs a loan
fast. . . . [The fund] helps build a

sense of community with people
helping each other out."
With donations ranging from
$100 to $250, El Centro is trying
to raise money to match Bacchet
ti's contribution before classes
begin, Morales said.
The new fund is modeled
after an American Indian emer
gency fund established 20 years
ago to offer interest-free loans
to Native Americans in need,
Morales said.
The American Indian fund cur
rently has around $3,000 to loan
out at its discretion, according to
Denni Woodward, assistant direc
tor of the American Indian Pro
gram Office. The amount changes

from year to year because the
money comes from small fund
raising resources, she added.
Loans in the past have helped
pay for glasses for children of
graduate students and books for
Native American students receiv
ing their financial aid late.
Although the American Indi
an Program Office also received
a $50,000 grant from the Uni
versity, Woodward said she does
not expect that money to aug
ment the fund. The grant is
"more for recruitment and
retention" and will probably end
up paying for such things as
guest speakers and pamphlets,
she added.
