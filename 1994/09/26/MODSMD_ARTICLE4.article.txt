# Funding 'la familia'
## El Centro Chicano sets up short-term loan program 
### Frank Guinan Staff writer 
Chicano and Latino students in
a monetary bind now can look to a
new fund sponsored by El Centro
Chicano to help them out with an
emergency loan.
Staff at the center raised
$2,200 through donations from
faculty, staff and off-campus indi
viduals for the new loan fund,
modeled after an existing fund
which serves Native American
students at Stanford.
The program is aimed at help
ing students through small short
term or unexpected financial
problems, said Frances Morales,
director of El Centro. These prob
lems could include the need to buy
school books or purchase food.
The program is for students who
"need a tiny little bit so that they can

worry about classes first," Morales
said. The fund was proposed by
Morales and approved by the Guid
ing Concilio, El Centro's governing
body, earlier this summer.
The Concilio will administer
the interest-free fund, she said,
and the time period to pay back the
loan will be decided on a case-by
case basis.
Morales said she has noticed an
increase in the number of stu
dents coming to her office for help,
and she expects the fund to be
used frequently.
According to Morales, under
graduate and graduate students
who have come to her office for
help in the past were directed to
the Financial Aids Office or to
Dean of Students Michael Jack
son. An informal "student net
work" — students at El Centro
contributing to their peers — also

helped students in need.
With the new fund, El Centro
will encourage students to appeal
to the Financial Aids Office first,
but will act as a lesser resource and
provide emergency "survival
money" when the University is not
in a position to help, Morales said.
El Centro hopes to raise a total
of $5,000 by the end of the acade
mic year through several fund
raising efforts, she said.
As part of the University's de
sire to demonstrate a commitment
to Stanford's ethnic communities,
El Centro was one of four centers
to receive a two-year, $50,000
grant which was announced Sept.
7. Morales, however, said she did
not know if any of that money
could be applied to the emergency
loan program.
