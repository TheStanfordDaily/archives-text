# Interfraternity Council wants to alter year-old BYOB policy
## 
### Scott Van Winkle Staff writer 
The virtual failure of last year's attempt
to encourage students to "bring your own
beverage" has prompted fraternities and
sororities to reconsider their policies on
open parties and alcohol as a new social cal
endar begins to take shape.
At a leadership retreat yesterday, mem
bers of the Greek community discussed the
possibility of using guest lists more fre
quently to limit attendance and relaxing
rules for scheduling parties at which alcohol
will be served.
Last October, the Interfraternity Coun
cil (IFC) adopted a policy mandating that no
common containers of alcohol, such as kegs
or punch bowls, would be used at parties on
even days of the month.
Despite the policy, only two of the 16 fra
ternities in the IFC even attempted bring
your-own parties last year, IFC President
Tom Baranowski said, calling the BYOB
parties "an endangered species."
Fraternities resumed serving alcohol on
even days toward the end of last year, he said.
The retreat, hosted by the University's
Office of Student Activities, was a forum for
discussion, but concrete decisions will be
made by the inter-fraternity and -sorority
councils in coming weeks, said Heather
Dunn, fraternal affairs adviser.

Baranowski said he expects the IFC will
modify its policy to allow common-contain
er parties if no BYOB parties are scheduled
on a particular night.
Protection for bring-your-own parties —
when and if they are scheduled — will proba
bly continue, he said, because fraternities are
feeling "more pressure than ever" from their
national organizations to limit liability.
Lawsuits filed by students injured at
open parties have spurred an increasing
concern with liability and a drive towards
more closed parties, Dunn said.
"It's all over the country," she said.
"(National) fraternities have adopted poli
cies that say, 'You will have closed parties,'
and Stanford chapters have been slow in ad
hering to that."
Dunn added that the issue was less cru
cial for sororities, which usually co-host
parties with fraternities and don't have the
liability concerns created by a house.
Baranowski said that national policies
dictate that fraternities control who at
tends their parties, since national groups
pay for liability insurance.
"I don't think any of the groups on cam
pus wants to be closed, because it hurts your
image and it's not nearly as much fun," he
said. "But at the same time, people want to
protect themselves."

Dunn said cost concerns may
also drive Greek organizations

toward more closed parties. Fra
ternity and sorority members,
who make up about 18 percent of
Stanford undergraduates, simply
can't afford to pay for everyone
else's drinking, she said.
Baranowski estimates that closed

parties already outnumber open par
ties by about 2-to-l on any given
night. Because the size of closed par
ties i3 limited by IFC rules to no more
than three times the number of
members, they are generally smaller
and require less security, he said.
