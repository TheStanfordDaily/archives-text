# High court justice Breyer to speak at Homecoming
## 
### Michael Slemmer Editorial staff 
Alumni Association officials have announced
that Stephen Breyer, the newest member of the
U.S. Supreme Court and a 1959 Stanford gradu
ate, will deliver next month's Reunion Homecom
ing weekend speech.
The Oct. 16 talk in Frost Amphitheater will be
the high point of the weekend, which will include
a parade on Palm Drive, lectures by professors
and tours of campus, in addition to reunion par
ties.
Although another Supreme Court justice —
Stanford graduate Sandra Day O'Connor — was
scheduled to speak at last year's Homecoming fes
tivities, she was unable to attend because of a court
session. Former Secretary of State George Shultz
gave the keynote addresss in her place, despite de
livering another speech that weekend as well.

Because Breyer's 35th reunion
will take place the same weekend,
officials at the Alumni Association
said they expect he will not en
counter a similar problem.
"We were looking for a marquis
name to put into our big presenta
tion," said Lawrence Green, spe
cial programs coordinator at the
Alumni Association. "We're
thrilled to have him — it's inter-

esting to have someone of his caliber attending our
event.
"We just lucked out that [Breyer] was coming to
the reunion," Green said. "It's not every day that
you run into a Supreme Court justice while you're
waiting in line for your football tickets."
Before joining the high court, Breyer taught at


Breyer
Harvard Law School and was
chief counsel to the Senate Judi

ciaiy Committee in 1979-80. For
the past 14 years, he has served as
chief judge of the first U.S. Cir
cuit Covirt of Appeals.
Breyer joins Chief Justice
William Rehnquist and Justices
Anthony Kennedy and O'Connor

as the fourth Stanford alumnus
to sit on the court. Earlier in the
summer, University President
Gerhard Casper and Law Prof.
Kathleen Sullivan testified in
favor of Breyer in front of the
Senate Judiciary Committee.
