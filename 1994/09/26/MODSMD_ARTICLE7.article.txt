# 'Seize the day in acquiring knowledge'
## Casper offers advice to incoming students 
### Sarah Katz Editorial staff 
With his typically academic ap
proach, University President Ger
hard Casper emphasized the impor
tance of learning and reason in an
undergraduate education, outlin
ing reasons to attend Stanford for
newly arrived students and their
parents Thursday morning in his
traditional Orientation welcome.
"A few years ago, I am told, on
one of those posted maps on cam
pus that helpfully indicate 'You
are here,' a student had added,
'Yes, but why?' " Casper told the
crowd gathered in the Main Quad
for his annual address. "I should
like to use my time this morning to
consider the 'But why?' "
Breaking the question down into
four parts — "Why are you in col
lege? Why are you in college at Stan
ford? Why should you be in college?
And finally, why should you be at
Stanford?" — Casper's answer em
phasized many of his ideas about the
importance of undergraduate educa
tion, as well as the need to reform it.

Though Casper went on to ac
knowledge that a college educa
tion is now a necessary prerequi
site for most jobs, he urged the
new students to think of college
not just as a means to an end but
as something of value itself.
"Its mostly residential charac
ter, its diversity, its emphasis on so
cialization and peer interaction, in
the eyes of many, make the college
environment ... a formative and
formidable experience that is val
ued in its own right, independently
of any academic purposes," he said.
Casper mentioned the forth
coming report of the Commission
on Undergraduate Education, a
group he formed a year ago to in
tensively study all facets of under
graduate education. The commit
tee's report is due in October.
He discussed his vision of the
purpose of a college education,
listing the use of reason, the im
portance of critical thinking and
the need for a practical education
as top criteria.
"The great challenge for the
curriculum is to allow students
sufficient freedom to explore
other disciplines while, at the
same time, satisfying the exten
sive and precise requirements of
their area of specialization,"
Casper said, highlighting one of
the challenges the commission is
currently addressing.
"My point to you is a simple
one: Seize the day in acquiring a
general and specialist knowl
edge," he added. "You are not
likely to be offered this opportuni
ty ever again quite as liberally as
it lies now in front of you."
Casper emphasized the impor
tance of college as a place of chal
lenges, where students could
learn, grow and change. He
stressed diversity, telling his lis
teners to "look around you" at the
strangers who would become
friends and reminding them to
question assumptions and prac
tices.
While he offered advice to
wide-eyed students and their anx
ious parents, Casper also used the
opportunity to sing Stanford's
praises, touting it as "one of the
best universities in the world."
For example, Casper cited the
University's "Western spirit of
pioneering, entrepreneurship,
energy."
"While ivy can be found on
campus, it is not the dominant
plant," he said, urging students to
take advantage of the many non
traditional opportunities Stan
ford offers them.
The president even took time
to warn students that, as gradu
ates of such a prestigious place,

the University would ask them to
contribute money.
"Stanford is flourishing
because many of your predeces
sors, now alumni, have felt and
presently feel a moral obligation
to give something back to Stan
ford — and whose support there
by helps you and future genera
tions to obtain the benefits that
come from the pursuit of knowl
edge," he said.
Noting that tuition has never
fully covered the cost of a college
education, Casper added, "One
day, Stanford will therefore call
on you, too, to display the same
sense of moral obligation that our
alumni now show on your
behalf."
Casper concluded his speech
with a brief discussion of the Uni
versity's motto — "The wind of
freedom blows" — a topic he has
covered in past speeches.
After joking that Stanford had
chosen him as its president
because of his ability to pro
nounce the motto in its original
German, Casper told the audience
he believes the phrase "sums up
most everything I talked about
this morning. ... I wish that you
may fully experience the plea
sures that come from studies
blossoming and minds moving."
Casper was preceded by Vice
Provost and Dean of Student
Affairs Mary Edmonds, who
encouraged her listeners to take
advantage of the University's
resources and services.
She also tried to assuage the
fears of the new students and
their parents, most of whom had
arrived on campus only a few
hours before.
"Stanford did not choose you
with the intent of getting rid of
you," she said. "It is our expecta
tion that you will succeed."

"My point to you is a simple
one: Seize the day in acquiring a
general and specialist knowl
edge," he added. "You are not
likely to be offered this opportuni
ty ever again quite as liberally as
it lies now in front of you."
Casper emphasized the impor
tance of college as a place of chal
lenges, where students could
learn, grow and change. He
stressed diversity, telling his lis
teners to "look around you" at the
strangers who would become
friends and reminding them to
question assumptions and prac
tices.
While he offered advice to
wide-eyed students and their anx
ious parents, Casper also used the
opportunity to sing Stanford's
praises, touting it as "one of the
best universities in the world."
For example, Casper cited the
University's "Western spirit of
pioneering, entrepreneurship,
energy."
"While ivy can be found on
campus, it is not the dominant
plant," he said, urging students to
take advantage of the many non
traditional opportunities Stan
ford offers them.
The president even took time
to warn students that, as gradu
ates of such a prestigious place,

the University would ask them to
contribute money.
"Stanford is flourishing
because many of your predeces
sors, now alumni, have felt and
presently feel a moral obligation
to give something back to Stan
ford — and whose support there
by helps you and future genera
tions to obtain the benefits that
come from the pursuit of knowl
edge," he said.
Noting that tuition has never
fully covered the cost of a college
education, Casper added, "One
day, Stanford will therefore call
on you, too, to display the same
sense of moral obligation that our
alumni now show on your
behalf."
Casper concluded his speech
with a brief discussion of the Uni
versity's motto — "The wind of
freedom blows" — a topic he has
covered in past speeches.
After joking that Stanford had
chosen him as its president
because of his ability to pro
nounce the motto in its original
German, Casper told the audience
he believes the phrase "sums up
most everything I talked about
this morning. ... I wish that you
may fully experience the plea
sures that come from studies
blossoming and minds moving."
Casper was preceded by Vice
Provost and Dean of Student
Affairs Mary Edmonds, who
encouraged her listeners to take
advantage of the University's
resources and services.
She also tried to assuage the
fears of the new students and
their parents, most of whom had
arrived on campus only a few
hours before.
"Stanford did not choose you
with the intent of getting rid of
you," she said. "It is our expecta
tion that you will succeed."
