# 'Seize the day in acquiring knowledge'
## Casper offers advice to incoming students 
### Sarah Katz Editorial staff 
With his typically academic ap
proach, University President Ger
hard Casper emphasized the impor
tance of learning and reason in an
undergraduate education, outlin
ing reasons to attend Stanford for
newly arrived students and their
parents Thursday morning in his
traditional Orientation welcome.
"A few years ago, I am told, on
one of those posted maps on cam
pus that helpfully indicate 'You
are here,' a student had added,
'Yes, but why?' " Casper told the
crowd gathered in the Main Quad
for his annual address. "I should
like to use my time this morning to
consider the 'But why?' "
Breaking the question down into
four parts — "Why are you in col
lege? Why are you in college at Stan
ford? Why should you be in college?
And finally, why should you be at
Stanford?" — Casper's answer em
phasized many of his ideas about the
importance of undergraduate educa
tion, as well as the need to reform it.

Though Casper went on to ac
knowledge that a college educa
tion is now a necessary prerequi
site for most jobs, he urged the
new students to think of college
not just as a means to an end but
as something of value itself.
"Its mostly residential charac
ter, its diversity, its emphasis on so
cialization and peer interaction, in
the eyes of many, make the college
environment ... a formative and
formidable experience that is val
ued in its own right, independently
of any academic purposes," he said.
Casper mentioned the forth
coming report of the Commission
on Undergraduate Education, a
group he formed a year ago to in
tensively study all facets of under
graduate education. The commit
tee's report is due in October.
He discussed his vision of the
purpose of a college education,
listing the use of reason, the im
portance of critical thinking and
the need for a practical education
as top criteria.
