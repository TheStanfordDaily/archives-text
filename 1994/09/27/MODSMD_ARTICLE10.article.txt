# More grade policy changes?
## Simoni expects Fac Sen to study grade inflation this year 
### Scott Van Winkle Staff writer 
As last year's tightening of the University's grad
ing policy begins to take effect, some key members of
the Faculty Senate are hinting that even more
changes — aimed specifically at grade inflation —
could be in the works.
Biology Prof. Robert Simoni, who will serve as

the senate chair for this school
year, listed a further Committee on
Academic Appraisal and Achieve
ment study of perceived grade infla
tion as one of the leading issues he
expects to face this year.
Simoni said last year's changes,
which included restoring failing
grades to students' transcripts, did
not address many professors' con
cerns that too many students

receive high grades. Two years ago, 93 percent of
Stanford grades were either A's or B's.
"While [last year's changes] were prompted by
grade inflation," he said, the changes "would not do
much to remedy it."
Religious Studies Prof. Van Harvey, the new
chair of the C-AAA, which recommended the modifi
cations, said the changes were intended to make
grades more meaningful, and not necessarily to
make them tougher to earn.
The committee "decided to disengage the whole
issue" of grade inflation in order to concentrate on

strengthening the system as a whole, but decided
that inflation would eventually need to be
addressed, he said.
Harvey said language and other humanities class
es do have unusually high average grades, but added
that more study needs to be made in order to deter
mine exactly where grade inflation exists.
"I don't like to talk about grade inflation as a
whole, because it's misleading," he said. "These
[concerns] are only suspicions of mine; we have to
look at it far more discriminatingly."
Their report, along with the recommendations of
University President Gerhard Casper's Commission
on Undergraduate Education, will provide impetus
for a renewed study of grades, Simoni said.
The commission's report, which is the culmina
tion of a year-long re-examination of the Universi
ty's academic processes, expresses a strong concern
over grade inflation, Harvey said.
History Prof. James Sheehan, the author of the
report, was unavailable for comment yesterday.
Simoni said not to expect action on this issue
until later in the year. First on the senate's agenda
is the implementation of the commission's far
reaching recommendations, which will begin at the
senate's first meeting Oct. 13.
That process could extend over this year and next,
Simoni said, because the senate will probably discuss
individually each change over which it has authority.
Reports from committees discussing ethnic stud
ies programs are also expected by the end of winter
quarter, Simoni said.
