Health care reform dead
WASHINGTON (AP) - Health care
reform, moribund for weeks, was pro
nounced dead yesterday for this session of
Congress by Senate Majority Leader
George J. Mitchell.
The Maine Democrat blamed Republi
cans, saying he had been unable to find the
60 votes needed to end an inevitable GOP
filibuster.
"It is clear that health insurance reform
cannot be enacted this year," Mitchell told
a news conference.
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole
denied the Republicans were to blame and
said it was overwhelming public opposi
tion, not parliamentary roadblocks, that
undid the Democrats' health plans.
"They never had 50 votes for any of
their plans," the Kansas Republican said.

In New York, President Clinton said of
the defeat: "I am very sorry that this
means Congress isn't going to reform
health care this year. But we are not giv
ing up on our mission to cover every
American and to control health care
costs."
Lobby reforms coming
WASHINGTON (AP) — A sweeping
package of reforms banning most gifts to
members of Congress and imposing strict
new reporting requirements on lobbyists
won agreement yesterday from House
and Senate negotiators.
The bill appeared to be on a fast track
to passage, with action in the House
scheduled for today. The Senate is expect
ed to act soon afterward, and supporters
said they anticipated no major opposition.
