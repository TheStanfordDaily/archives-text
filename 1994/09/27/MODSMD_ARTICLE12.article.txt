PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP)
â€” Jubilant crowds welcomed
American military police yesterday
as they set up shop in local police
stations, including the notorious
precinct that launched the coup
which overthrew President Jean-
Bertrand Aristide three years ago.
At the downtown dock, 221
Haitain refugees arrived home on a
U.S. Coast Guard cutter, having
chosen to leave the U.S. base at
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. They were
greeted by U.S. Ambassador
William Swing, given $40 in Haitian
money and taken to the nearby bus
station to complete their journeys.
In the countryside, Marines
traveling outside Cap-Haitien, the
second-biggest city, were wel
comed in the towns and sugar cane
fields they passed through or heli
coptered over.
The United States also
announced a cash-for-weapons
program to start today, hoping to
encourage more Haitians to turn
guns taken from the hated Haitian
army and police over to U.S.

troops. Many residents in Cap-
Haitien did just that Sunday,
apparently prompting Haiti's mili
tary-installed government to issue
a communique yesterday urging
citizens to surrender weapons at
Haitian army outposts.
American MPs seemed over
whelmed by the throngs of Aris
tide supporters that gathered out
side the precinct building near an
open-air market. It was from here
that police chief Michel Francois,
then a captain and now an army
lieutenant colonel, kicked off the
Sept. 29, 1991, coup.
Haitians used to avoid or hurry
past the dreaded building where
their neighbors were jailed and tor
tured. Now many are becoming
bolder as U.S. forces begin spread
ing throughout this city of 1 million.
"I wasn't scared. The Ameri
cans were with us," said a man who
nevertheless, to be safe, identified
himself only as Casseus, age 36.
U.S. officials announced last
week that MPs would be stationed
at six police stations to work side

by-side with Haitian police and try
to reduce human rights abuses. By
yesterday, MPs were in at least
three stations.
"We came here to make a pres
ence and ... exchange ideas," said
Capt. Randy Durdian of the 101st
Airborne Division as his men
moved into a station in suburban
Petionville.
The festive downtown gather
ing didn't last long, but it showed
Haitians' increasing optimism
that a rule of law was being
enforced, and that Aristide really
may be coming home soon.
At the United Nations, Presi
dent Clinton lifted travel, trade
and most other U.S. sanctions
against Haiti on yesterday and
urged other nations to follow suit.
Aristide himself had urged an end
to the sanctions on Sunday.
Clinton suggested the sanctions
were no longer needed, with Ameri
can and other forces firmly in place
in the Caribbean country to enforce
the U.S.-brokered agreement to
restore Aristide to power by Oct. 15.
