SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina
(AP) — Underscoring their contempt for
the United Nations, Serbs entered a U.N.
weapons compound and staged "training
exercises" with anti-aircraft guns stored
there, officials said yesterday.
"Obviously the situation is tense," Lt.
Col. Tim Spicer, a U.N. military
spokesman in Sarajevo, said of the Bosni
an Serb action Sunday at a weapons depot
in Lukavica. "We believe this is a direct
result of the airstrike."
NATO jets strafed and bombed a Serb
tank near Sarajevo last Thursday in retal
iation for Serb attacks on French peace
keepers. It was the fourth NATO strike
on Serb ground positions this year.
But Bosnian Serbs, hobbled by newly
tightened U.N. sanctions for rejecting a
peace plan, seem only to have dug their
heels in deeper.
They increased the pressure on U.N.

peacekeepers yesterday by:
— Denying permission for U.N. heli
copter flights or convoys.
— Announcing a new requirement
that U.N. military vehicles get clearance
three days in advance of any movements
through Serb-held territory.
— Making a veiled threat to shoot at
any U.N. planes landing at the airport,
dealing a setback to hopes of resuming
Sarajevo's vital aid airlift.
Spicer said "a strong protest" was
lodged with Bosnian Serbs after they
warned Sunday that they could no longer
guarantee safety of planes using the Sara
jevo airport. A similar threat prompted
Pope John Paul II to cancel a planned pil
grimage to Sarajevo this month.
The airlift has been mostly suspended
as a precaution since Thursday's
airstrike. U.N. aid spokesman Kris
Janowski said flights probably would not

resume until next Monday.
U.N. relief officials based in Belgrade,
Yugoslavia, also said they were suspend
ing aid shipments through Serb-held
areas of Bosnia after receiving a letter
from Serbs warning that they "cannot
guarantee safety" of convoys.
Convoys must travel through Serb
held land to reach besieged Muslim
enclaves in eastern Bosnia.
U.N. officials say there is a 2-week
stockpile of food in the city. But with land
routes closed, there was concern about a
looming food shortage.
Serbs also are blamed for a 2-week-old
cutoff of almost all electricity, gas and
water service to Sarajevo.
On Sunday, Serb soldiers entered a
U.N.-guarded weapons depot at Lukavi
ca, just south of Sarajevo, and held "train
ing exercises" with anti-aircraft guns,
Spicer said.
