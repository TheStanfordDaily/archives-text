## A 						burning concern 
### 
Research and action are
needed to decide the fate
of the Big Game Bonfire

The recent cancella
tion of the Big Game Bonfire
comes as a disappointment to
the Stanford community, but not a
surprise.
For the second year in a row, one
of the oldest and most beloved Farm
traditions — a 15-story blaze that lit
up the Lagunita lake bed in years
past — has been extinguished. Due
to lingering questions about the
impact of the bonfire on the Califor
nia tiger salamander and about the
pollution generated by such a mas
sive fire, the event has been suspend
ed indefinitely.
While few would agree that con
tinuing the bonfire is worth destroy
ing the salamanders' habitat or
threatening the quality of the air we
breathe, the actual facts supporting
the existence of these dangers are
still unclear.
Last year, a petition to the state
urging the protection of the sala
mander under the Endangered
Species Act was deemed sufficient
cause to cancel the bonfire — but
little is really known about the
impact on the species.
Two groups, Stanford's Center for
Conservation Biology and the Coyote
Creek Riparian Center, were origi
nally consulted when the fire was
canceled last year. Neither organiza
tion has yet issued a conclusive, in
depth report.
If the organizations do not take
the initiative to follow up with a
study, perhaps a student research
group could take on the task. While
the investigation could be costly,
these questions surely merit further
research, not just in connection to
the bonfire but for the greater sake
of preserving the salamander.
While the facts are being dis
cerned, ways to decrease the environ
mental impact should also be

explored. The gigantic blazes of years
past are probably just that — in the
past. But the fire could easily be
scaled down to half its original size,
preserving the actual flames but pro
ducing less soot and smog.
While the lake bed's vast expanse
is the most obvious site for the bon
fire, other locations should also be
explored. Of Stanford's 8,200 acres,
there should be at least one alternate
site where a rally and a pared-down
fire could take place. How about a
dorm parking lot?
A smaller, relocated fire is certain
ly possible in the future. However,
this year's blaze looks doomed, and
Stanford needs a good, spirit-rousing
replacement. Last year, the Axe
Committee staged a laser show on
the side of Hoover Tower which drew
a reasonable crowd but lacked the
crackling excitement of the bonfire.
Instead of displaying a costly yet
lackluster light display, the Axe Com
mittee, together with student resi
dences and other groups such as the
Office of Student Affairs, the Athlet
ic Department and the Stanford
Concert Network, should work
together to plan and fund an event
which rouses school spirit.
One idea is to hold a block party
on the Row — a little-known Stan
ford tradition which thrived before
the 1970s — as the centerpiece of
the Big Game week's festivities.
Houses on and near Mayfield
Avenue could host a campus-wide
rally and dance, which would be
coordinated by the Axe Committee.
Students could gather around a
stage in the street from which Bill
Walsh and the players might deliv
er inspiring addresses.
Of course, proper safeguards such
as adequate lighting and security
would be necessary to ensure that
anti-Weenie spirit does not get out of
control. With the cooperation of the
Row houses and the University's
approval, one Big Game tradition
could replace another. The salaman
ders may have forced us to snuff out
the bonfire this year, but that doesn't
mean that our school spirit has to
burn any less brightly.
