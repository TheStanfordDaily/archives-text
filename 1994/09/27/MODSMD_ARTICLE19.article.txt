## Fred Dretske Picking up where Aristotle left off 
### 
NOW THAT THE
summer is over,
we can get back
to worrying about
important things.
Like, for instance, why
it is not always right to
increase the amount of
human happiness in
the world. Or how one

manages to get to Iresidder Union
when one has to do an infinite number
of things (successively crossing all the
intermediate points) to get there. Or
why nothing inside the head looks like
Hoover Tower even though that is
where one's experiences of the tower
are. Or why freedom means something
more than being able to do what you
want to do.
These are not practical concerns.
They are important nonetheless. They
are important because the answers —
or in some cases, our inability to agree
upon answers — reveal something
basic about the human condition. You
won't go hungry if you don't think
about these matters. You might even
sleep better if you don't. But your
experience at Stanford will be less than
it should be if you spend all your time
thinking about what you are going to

do next weekend (important though
that is), and not enough time thinking
about things like what gives you — but
not a snail — the capacity to wonder
about the future.
I'm a philosopher, so I picked prob
lems that philosophers focus on. They
are problems in metaphysics, ethics
and epistemology. .Many of these ques
tions have been with us since the
Greeks. To suggest that these are
problems that are still with us is to
suggest that there are not — not yet,
anyway — answers. At least no
answers that command widespread
assent.
This, though, is part of what makes
the philosophical quest exciting. Not
only are the problems important —
they go to the heart of human affairs
— but there exists the tantalizing
prospect that you, yes, you, can discov
er the answers. One doesn't need a lin
ear accelerator, a Cray computer, or an
expensive laboratory to grapple with
these mysteries. All one needs is a keen
intelligence (standard equipment for
Stanford students), some help in
avoiding the mistakes of the past (that
is what we, the faculty, are for) and
perseverance (it will take more than a
weekend).

With a little bit of luck, you can suc
ceed where Aristotle and Spinoza
failed. Why not? You, after all, have an
advantage. You know — or can easily
find out — what they thought, but, for
obvious reasons, they could not have
known what you think. A substantial
edge.
Some people are skeptical about our
ability to find answers to philosophical
questions. They get impatient. If the
questions have been around for over
2,000 years but the answers continue
to elude us, maybe there is something
wrong with the questions. Maybe. But
that is part of the puzzle. If philosoph
ical questions — questions about the
nature of truth, knowledge, freedom
and moral obligation — are somehow
illegitimate, what makes them so? Why
do some questions have answers and
not others? That, surely, is one of the
questions that has an answer. If you
know it, I wish you would tell me.
Welcome, and in many cases, wel
come back to Stanford. I hope this is
the year you find some answers. Even
if you don't, I hope you join in the fun
and excitement of looking for them.
