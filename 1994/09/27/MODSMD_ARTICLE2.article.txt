# University divides responsibility for LaIR between two directors

To facilitate the use of computing services on cam
pus, Provost Condoleezza Rice recently announced
the break up of Libraries and Information Resources
into two organizations — one to oversee academic
computing networks and the other to supervise ad
ministrative aspects of the school's computing sys
tems.
"We wanted to see how Stanford can best marshal
its resources .. . and provide better computing ser
vices," said Director of Internal Audit Glen Mueller,
who was named to the new post of chief information
officer for Information Technology Systems and Ser
vices earlier this month.
University Librarian and Director of Academic In
formation Resources Michael Keller will oversee the
academic aspects of the school's computing systems,
such as the library systems and multimedia.
Plans for the reorganization started after Robert

Street stepped down as vice provost of
LaIR in August to become chair of the
Civil Engineering Department, said
Civil Engineering Prof. Boyd Paul
son, chair of the Committee on Acad
emic Computing and Information
Systems (C-ACIS).
The reorganization is supposed to
save the University money in the long
run, said Biochemistry Prof. Doug

Brutlag, who was one of four professors to consult
with Rice on the changes. He speculated that the Uni
versity would save 20 percent of Lalß's budget over
the next five years.
But Paulson, who also consulted with Rice about
the changes, said money was not a primary concern
during the discussions this summer.
"[Our] focus was on the organizational restructur
ing and benefits to the school" and not on the amount
