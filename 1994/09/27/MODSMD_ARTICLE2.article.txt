# University divides responsibility for LaIR between two directors

### Frank Guinan Staff writer 
To facilitate the use of computing services on cam
pus, Provost Condoleezza Rice recently announced
the break up of Libraries and Information Resources
into two organizations — one to oversee academic
computing networks and the other to supervise ad
ministrative aspects of the school's computing sys
tems.
"We wanted to see how Stanford can best marshal
its resources .. . and provide better computing ser
vices," said Director of Internal Audit Glen Mueller,
who was named to the new post of chief information
officer for Information Technology Systems and Ser
vices earlier this month.
University Librarian and Director of Academic In
formation Resources Michael Keller will oversee the
academic aspects of the school's computing systems,
such as the library systems and multimedia.
Plans for the reorganization started after Robert

Street stepped down as vice provost of
LaIR in August to become chair of the
Civil Engineering Department, said
Civil Engineering Prof. Boyd Paul
son, chair of the Committee on Acad
emic Computing and Information
Systems (C-ACIS).
The reorganization is supposed to
save the University money in the long
run, said Biochemistry Prof. Doug

Brutlag, who was one of four professors to consult
with Rice on the changes. He speculated that the Uni
versity would save 20 percent of Lalß's budget over
the next five years.
But Paulson, who also consulted with Rice about
the changes, said money was not a primary concern
during the discussions this summer.
"[Our] focus was on the organizational restructur
ing and benefits to the school" and not on the amount


Rice
of money the University would
save, Paulson said.
Both Mueller and Paulson
admitted that they did not know
whether any layoffs will result
from the reorganization since indi

vidual responsibilities have not
been defined yet.
"Whether or not some people
can adapt is partly their call,"
Paulson said.
Mueller's new organization
now oversees computing services
from four different offices. The
consolidation of the four services
makes it easier to replace all the
application programs used for

administrative needs, he said.
He added that the move would
"renew the infrastructure" of the
school's administrative computing
system, which currently runs on
one large mainframe.
Mueller said he hoped his orga
nization would "migrate" to a
client-server system, in which each
terminal can access data using its
own application programs rather

than requiring the mainframe to
perform repetitive tasks.
While Brutlag sees the academ
ic and administrative computing
organizations combining again at
the end of five years, Mueller is not
so sure.
"Keller and I will be working
together very closely ... but that's
a decision that will come five years
down the road," Mueller said.
