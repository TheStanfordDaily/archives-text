# Stanford Fulbrights overseas
## 13 students use grants to research in foreign countries 
### Jamie Taylor Staff writer 
Thirteen Stanford students or recent graduates are
now researching diverse topics in various countries
after receiving Fulbright scholarships from New
York's Institute of International Education.
The scholarship — a grant to enable students to
conduct research or study overseas — is funded by
both the American government and various other
national governments "to encourage international
relations between students," said John Pearson, direc
tor of the Bechtel International Center.
Stanford's Fulbright winners are doctoral students
Yen Kuei Chuang, Kenneth Fromm, Walter
Hawthorne, Kristin L. Johnson, Marcel Lieberman,
Susan Lund and Julia Olson. Recent graduates Rebec
ca Albiani, Richard Arney, Carolyn Blume, Mimi Kao,
Jonathan Levin, and Shayne Spalten also won grants.
The grant allows for close to 1,000 students nation
wide to travel to over 100 countries throughout the
world to study virtually any item of interest. For
example, Albiani is researching images of Old Testa
ment women in late Renaissance Venetian paintings
in Italy, and Lieberman, a doctoral student in philoso-

phy, is examining "metaethics and moral philosophy
in the continental tradition" in Belgium.
Others are using their Fulbright scholarships to
travel to remote areas of the world and conduct research
in areas of personal interest. Hawthorne is studying the
social history in Guinea Bissau as part of his doctoral
studies in African history and anthropology.
The Fulbright application consists of biographical
information, an academic statement and a personal
statement, as well as three references and one lan
guage-skills reference, if appropriate.
Pearson also stated that the applicant "really must
show in his application a real interest in the country
concerned, a real academic interest, and a tie with
those into his present academic accomplishment and
his future and professional goals."
Scholarship selection is a three-tiered process.
First, Stanford applicants are interviewed and evalu
ated at Stanford by 20 committees made up of faculty,
returning Fulbright scholars and visiting scholars and
researchers. The center then sends the applications to
New York where they are once again evaluated. In the
January national screenings, the U.S. government
forwards the applications to each applicant's respec
tive country.
