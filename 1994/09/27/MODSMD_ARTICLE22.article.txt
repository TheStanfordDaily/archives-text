## 3,000 to stampede fairways Stanford Invite! 
### Todd Bernstein Staff writer 
If you make it to the Stanford
Golf Course this Saturday, don't
expect to see Tiger Woods with
his nine iron.
In fact, put the golf clubs away
and prepare to watch the nation
ally-ranked Cardinal runners in
the 21st Annual Stanford Invita
tional Cross Country Meet.
The Invitational will once
again feature some of the
nation's strongest men's and
women's cross country pro
grams. More than 60 squads
totaling over 3,000 athletes will
stampede a normally tranquil 18
holes.
The rampage will include

tough competition for the third
ranked Stanford women. Schools
such as UCLA, BYU, Rice and
Arizona in particular will field
some of the most highly regarded
runners in the nation.
However, the Cardinal
women's team is coming off of
one of its biggest victories ever,
over former-No. 1 Arkansas on
September 17. Eight varsity
returnees — sophomores Leila
Burr, Monal Chokshi, Ann Shee
hy and Amanda White, junior
Laura Hayward, and seniors
Stephanie Jensen, Kay Luo and
Sarah Truitt — expect to run at
the front of the pack during the
Invitational.
"It's very fortunate to beat a
team like Arkansas," said head
coach Vin Lananna. "[The victory]
is an indication of how we've pro
gressed as a team. On the women's
side it will be a great, great race."
Meanwhile, the Stanford men,
currently ranked 16th in the coun
try, will face as competitive a field
as the women. Third-ranked BYU,
Arizona, St. John's University,
Colgate University, and UCLA will
pose the strongest challenges to the
Cardinal.
Although the men will race
against higher ranked teams,
Lananna is quick to assert that
polls and rankings reveal little in
the world of cross country.
"Cross country is a sport where
rankings don't mean anything," he
said. "[At meets] you all run the
same day, at the same time, and the
top teams are the ones that do well."
Leading the men's attack this
Saturday will be sophomores Greg
Jimmerson, J.J. White and Andy
Cowgill and juniors Rob Reeder,
Mark Fadiland and Erik Spayde.
The Invitational will also fea
ture high school competition. Stan
ford expects 1,500 high school girls
and 1,400 high school boys to com
pete. The high school races start at
11:30 a.m. this Saturday, with the
open collegiate competition begin
ning at 3:45 p.m. The Invitational
races will follow at 4:15 p.m.
