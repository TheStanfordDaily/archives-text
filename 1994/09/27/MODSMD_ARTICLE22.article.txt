## 3,000 to stampede fairways Stanford Invite! 
### Todd Bernstein Staff writer 
If you make it to the Stanford
Golf Course this Saturday, don't
expect to see Tiger Woods with
his nine iron.
In fact, put the golf clubs away
and prepare to watch the nation
ally-ranked Cardinal runners in
the 21st Annual Stanford Invita
tional Cross Country Meet.
The Invitational will once
again feature some of the
nation's strongest men's and
women's cross country pro
grams. More than 60 squads
totaling over 3,000 athletes will
stampede a normally tranquil 18
holes.
The rampage will include

tough competition for the third
ranked Stanford women. Schools
such as UCLA, BYU, Rice and
Arizona in particular will field
some of the most highly regarded
runners in the nation.
However, the Cardinal
women's team is coming off of
one of its biggest victories ever,
over former-No. 1 Arkansas on
September 17. Eight varsity
returnees — sophomores Leila
Burr, Monal Chokshi, Ann Shee
hy and Amanda White, junior
Laura Hayward, and seniors
Stephanie Jensen, Kay Luo and
Sarah Truitt — expect to run at
the front of the pack during the
Invitational.
