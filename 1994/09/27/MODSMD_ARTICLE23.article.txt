That's what I used to say when
people asked me why I write for
sports instead of a "real news" sec
tion. Since I am trying to recruit

some talented writers this fall, I
suppose I ought to take this time to
articulate my answer a bit better.
Sports journalism is much more
than who beat whom and by how
much. Indeed, if sportswriting
involved mere numbers, I would be
hiring people during statistics lec
tures. That way, I could show funky
graphs on my page, as well as pro
vide analysis of whether or not a 50-
21 score produced a "p value" that
showed the victory to be statistically
significant.
With the Stanford Daily at least,
sports coverage provides a writer
with the opportunity to get to know
the heroes they cheer for, to follow
their lives from the beginning of a
season to its end.
Last year, for instance, I had the
pleasure of meeting Sarah Truitt,
who was captain of the women's
cross country team. Admittedly, in
the beginning, I wasn't very excited
about covering cross country
because I regarded the sport as a
collection of individual athletes
running around until they crossed
a finish line. That was until I inter
viewed Truitt for a feature story
about her career at Stanford.
Besides immediately finding her
to be quite friendly and humorous
ly blunt, I also discovered how
much Truitt's senior season meant
to her beyond the often over

emphasized concept of winning.
Truitt began collegiate competi
tion under Brooks Johnson, former
head coach of cross country. During
those two years, she and her fellow
runners placed great psychological
and physical pressure on themselves,
since Johnson had tremendous suc
cess in the past. As a result, injuries
accrued, and Truitt came out of her
first two seasons with wounds, bouts
of personal disappointment, and,
above all, fewer teammates.
By her senior year, only one
other runner out of the eight fresh
men who began collegiate cross
country with Truitt had elected to
remain on the team. In her sopho
more year, even Truitt's captains
had decided to quit cross country,
leaving the team with no leader
ship, cohesion, or identity.
"We were so scared," Truitt said.
"I wondered, 'What's going to become
of us?' It was so lonely out there."
Hence, after a promising junior
year under new head coach Vin
Lananna, senior season provided
Truitt the opportunity to help
bring women's cross country back
to the times when cohesion, leader
ship, and confidence were not wor
ries, but the foundations of better
things to come.
Keeping that in mind, I eagerly
watched women's cross country
steadily develop the qualities that
would once again make the sport
fun for its athletes. In the end, I
cheered as loudly as any parent as I
watched the team capture the
Pacific 10 Conference Champi
onship and end Oregon's three
year reign. I doubled over in laugh
ter when I saw that the women
were so excited, they broke their
championship trophy.
To me, therefore, sports articles
are much more than scores and high
lights. They are channels into the
lives of unique personalities. They
are stories of personal challenges and
triumphs. They are chronicles about
the extraordinary scholar-athletes
that are our schoolmates.
