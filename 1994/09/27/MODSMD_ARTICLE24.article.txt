# Spikers up against napping Bears
## Look to smash weak Cal squad 
### Seth Goldstein Staff writer 
The 1994 edition of the Cali
fornia women's volleyball team
is truly pitiful, according to
Stanford head coach Don Shaw.
Strangely, when the arch
rival Golden Bears come to
Maples Pavilion tonight at 7
p.m. to face the No. 1 Cardinal
squad, Shaw won't necessarily
be pleased about Cal's weak
ness.
Because Pacific 10 Confer
ence teams travel in pairs, such
as Cal traveling with Stanford
to Los Angeles to play UCLA
and USC, it often affords an
imbalance in preparation among
the squads.
"While we have to spend time
preparing for both of those
schools, they can spend the
whole week preparing for us,
and they can basically just write
Cal off," Shaw said.
He further explained, "It
would help us over the course of
a season to have Cal be strong,
even though it would mean
more competition, because it
would force the other eight
teams to deal with them as
well."
Strength is one characteristic
the Bears do not possess. While
all other teams in the Pac-10
currently have out-of-confer
ence records better than .500,
California has yet to win a
match. The Bears lost five,
three-year starters from their
'93 squad and, as Shaw put it,
"they just didn't reload".
The Bears have never had
much success against the Cardi
nal. Last season Stanford domi
nated both the teams' two meet
ings, winning handily at home
and crushing the Bears in the
first two games at Berkeley
before struggling in the third
and fourth en route to a 3-1 vic
tory. Stanford will attempt to
run its all-time record against
California to 34-3 tonight.
"Cal is definitely having a
down year, but we can't worry
about that," Shaw said. "We
have to treat it as just another
match. We're not going to start
feeling sorry for them just
because they have a poor team."
As Shaw implies, Stanford
spikers must still be wary. Cali
fornia may not pose a serious
threat on paper, but it can still
cause problems. After all, the
Bears have nothing to lose
because no one expects them to
win.
"They will have no problem
getting fired up to play us,"
Shaw said. "Not only would it be
a monumental upset if they
won, but the idea of beating
Stanford should be enough to
motivate them."
Shaw hopes that Stanford
fans and students alike will
come out to see his team take on
the hated Bears.

"What better way to start out
the year than with a victory over
the Bears? The freshmen can
learn to hate Cal right from the
beginning," he said.
While the team might beat
California, a win may not pro
duce the effect Shaw desires. If
the match is as competitive as
predicted, the freshmen might
learn how to pity the Bears
instead.

Junior outside hitter Marnie Triefenbach glides for the kill during Stanford's route of Washington Sept.
15. The Cardinal hopes to see much of the same tonight at its 7 p.m. home match against Cal.
