Barbara Ifejika

If good looks could kill, then freshman middle blocker Barbara
Ifejika must be one of the most beautiful women in the Pacif
ic 10 Conference. The Brampton, Ontario, Canada native has
started quite a murdering spree since her arrival on the top
ranked Stanford women's volleyball team. In the Cardinal's
Pac-10 opener against Washington on September 15, the 6-
foot-2 Ifejika dazzled the Maples Pavilion crowd with seven
kills and a .750 hitting percentage to accompany her 10 digs.
The next evening, she bettered her performance against
Washington State by hitting 1.000, a perfect eight kills on
eight swings to go along with five digs. If this streak continues,
expect Ifejika to appear on America's Most Wanted.


Jeremy Laster

Even in times of defeat there are moments of brilliance. Despite Stanford water polo's dis
appointing 12-11 loss to Cal in overtime last Saturday, junior Jeremy Laster came away
with a winning performance. Laster tied his career high by scoring five goals, including a
two-pointer, to lead the Cardinal attack during the entirety of the fiercely-fought game.
The multi-purpose polo athlete from San Clemente, Calif., is a member of the US Junior
National Team. An All-American candidate, he led the team last year with 51 points.
