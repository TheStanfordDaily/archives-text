## Men's soccer struggles with injuries, losses

"It's been a long weekend," said men's soccer head
coach Colin Lindores.
Indeed, when the weekend was all over, the team had
suffered two more losses and five players were out for
the season with injuries. Playing in the Saint Mary's
tournament, arch-rival Santa Clara University defeated
the Cardinal Friday, and on Sunday, St. Mary's College
stymied Stanford for the first time ever.
The Cardinal lost 3-1 to the Broncos in a tightly con
tested match. The game was originally scheduled to be
at home but ended up at St. Mary's in Moraga instead.
Stanford's luck turned from bad to worse in the second
half of the game when senior midfielder Jeff Kogl was
ejected.
"It is significant that we played most of the second
half, and the two overtime periods, with only 10 play
ers," Lindores said. "The ejection was a mayor factor in
the game because from that point
on they just wore us down. It was a
pretty even game going up to half
time."
At halftime the score was even at
1-1. After the ejection Santa Clara
was able to control the game and
outshoot Stanford.
"We tended to play much more
defensively and then counterat
tack," Lindores said.
Freshman Justin Leßlanc scored
Stanford's lone goal. It was the first
time Leßlanc found the back of the
net in collegiate competition.
"(Leßlanc is] doing well for us,"
Lindores said. "He's one of the nice
surprises."
Other players who had good
games against the Broncos were
senior Jim Masetti and freshman
Dan Wytock.
Stanford's overall personnel situ
ation did not look so good, however.
Mounting injuries to Stanford play
ers, many of which are season-end
ing, compounded the problem of the
ejection. The Cardinal headed into
the match-up with the Broncos
without midfielders junior Steve
Kirschbaum, freshman Shan Gaw,
sophomore John Manchester and
sophomore Paul Phillips.
"I think that it has definitely
affected us psychologically," Phillips
said. "It's a mental strain to see all
these guys who were playing and

starting sitting on the bench with
injuries."
Kirschbaum, in particular, was
expected to play a pivotal role in the
center for Stanford: "Steve was a
key," Phillips said. "From the begin
ning of the season the coach told us
that we were supposed to play
around and through him in the mid
dle."
In Sunday's game against the
Rattlers, Stanford fell 3-1 and lost
another one of its strongest players,
senior Ryan Collins, to a knee
injury. The Cardinal anticipated
Collins to be its primary scorer this
season.
After trailing 2-0 at half-time,
this young squad bounced back in
the second half with a goal by junior
Carmen D'Onofrio. However, with
out Collins, the extremely young
team with five freshmen starters
could not fend off the Rattlers.
"We played poorly, but we just
don't have the depth to take that
many injuries," Lindores said. "On
the plus side, lots of freshmen and
sophomores are getting lots of play
ing time, but we're losing the level of
competitiveness we need."
The coach added, "The freshmen
all come from good programs, but
this is a different level mentally and
physically.
Sunday's loss was the latest
chapter in a season that continues
to frustrate the coaches and players
and try their patience.
"It's been very disappointing, like
there's some kind of voodoo on us," Lin
dores said "Well just have to gut it out"
