# No action on women's self defense
## Stanford awaits decision regarding gender discrimination 
### Laura Shin Staff writer 
After sparking campus controversy last year, the
women's self-defense course remains in limbo this
fall as the University waits to hear from the U.S. De
partment of Education whether the class violates a
federal gender discrimination restriction.
Though the decision was not scheduled for a set
date, the Education Department's Office of Civil
Rights was slowed down by a late report from the
University and the Women Defending Ourselves
Collective, who currently teach the class off campus.
The brief — which outlines the reasons why the
class should remain open to women only — was de
layed for a month this summer because of a series of
conferences in which the University and the collec
tive hammered out the exact format of the material
presented, said collective member Kirsten Daehler.
The Civil Rights Office had originally expected

the decision to be made within a few months of the
report's submission.
"If the Office of Civil Rights is able to keep the
same timeline they originally projected, then we may
hear their response as soon as a month from now,"
Daehler said.
The Feminist Studies course "Issues in Self-De
fense for Women" first ran into trouble last fall
when an anonymous person challenged that its
women-only policy violated Title IX, a 1972 federal
regulation outlawing sex discrimination in schools
which receive federal funding.
Originally, the University asked the class to
change its format to either a coed class or a single-sex
physical education class that would be permissible
under Title IX, but the Collective did not find either
option viable.
The University and the collective asked the Office
of Civil Rights to make a legal
assessment of the issue last June,
in order to preclude future com
plaints.
In the brief submitted to the
Office of Civil Rights, the collec
tive contended that women have a
"preexisting disadvantage
[because] women are attacked
more often than men," Daehler
said, adding that the collective
believes that this class compen
sates women for past and existing
discrimination, and therefore is
permitted by Title IX.
Daehler mentioned that previ
ous cases involving possible viola
tions of Title IX have been argued

in a similar lasnion.
The collective also rejected the
idea of a strictly physical educa
tion class, because the self
defense class is meant to be onlj
one part physical education. The
other two parts teach assertive
ness in social situations, including
the classroom, and discuss vio
lence against women.
The University then went ovei
the report to see what parts it alsc
supported. The vast majority ol
the brief, according to Hodder
was submitted jointly by the Uni
versity and the collective.
The University and the collec
tive seem to agree on the impor
tance of this class for the commu
nity.
"The Feminist Studies Pro
gram would be happy to restore
'Issues in Self-Defense foi

Women' to its curriculum if the
Provost approves," said Estelle
Freedman, professor of history,
because "it's important to let
women students study and train
. . . in a single-sex environ
ment."
University Associate General
Counsel Iris Brest and another
collective member, Margaret llod
der, have been in contact with the
Civil Rights Office all summer.
"As far as we know, [the office
is] making progress towards a
decision," Daehler said.
Currently, the class will con
tinue to be held at the University
Lutheran Church on the corner of
Stanford Avenue and Bowdoin
Street. It begins this Saturday
morning, and sessions will be held
regularly on Wednesday and
Thursday evenings.
