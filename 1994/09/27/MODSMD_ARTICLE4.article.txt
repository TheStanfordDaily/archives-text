# House, Senate compromise on cuts to research funding
## Final appropriations bill axes $200M 
### Sarah Katz Editorial staff 
Ending months of speculation over
possible cuts in Defense Department
funding, a congressional conference com
mittee finished work yesterday, cutting
about $200 million from university re
search programs.
The final cuts are less than the $900
million — about half of the original $1.8
billion budget — that the U.S. House of
Representatives cut in its Defense appro
priations bill last July. In its own Defense
appropriations bill, later in the summer,
the U.S. Senate cut only $82 million.
The conference committee — made
up of negotiators from both the House
and the Senate — settled on a figure be
tween the two amounts. The final cut
represents about 11 percent of the origi
nal funding to universities, leaving $1.6
billion to be distributed nationally during
fiscal year 1994-95, said Larry Horton,
Stanford's director of government rela

tions.
As of last night, the Associated Press
was reporting the total defense research
budget to be only $1.4 billion. The office
of U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.),
however, confirmed the figure of $ 1.6 bil
lion.
"We're disappointed and we hope that
Congress will be able to restore those
funds next year," Horton said, "but it
could have been much worse."
According to Stanford's 1994-95 bud
get, 23 percent of this year's revenues —
$280 million — was expected to come
from federal support for research. About
15 percent of this total was to come from
the Defense Department.
Administrators said they do not know
exactly how the cuts will affect the Uni
versity.
"There's more to it than just the num
bers," said Dale Tate, the associate direc

it was not yet clear whether the federal
cuts would be taken from all universities

or from specific programs around the

However, Horton said, "a prudent
person would assume you get a cut at
least across the board."
In that case, administrators worry the
