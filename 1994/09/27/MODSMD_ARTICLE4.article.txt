# House, Senate compromise on cuts to research funding
## Final appropriations bill axes $200M 
### Sarah Katz Editorial staff 
Ending months of speculation over
possible cuts in Defense Department
funding, a congressional conference com
mittee finished work yesterday, cutting
about $200 million from university re
search programs.
The final cuts are less than the $900
million — about half of the original $1.8
billion budget — that the U.S. House of
Representatives cut in its Defense appro
priations bill last July. In its own Defense
appropriations bill, later in the summer,
the U.S. Senate cut only $82 million.
The conference committee — made
up of negotiators from both the House
and the Senate — settled on a figure be
tween the two amounts. The final cut
represents about 11 percent of the origi
nal funding to universities, leaving $1.6
billion to be distributed nationally during
fiscal year 1994-95, said Larry Horton,
Stanford's director of government rela

tions.
As of last night, the Associated Press
was reporting the total defense research
budget to be only $1.4 billion. The office
of U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.),
however, confirmed the figure of $ 1.6 bil
lion.
"We're disappointed and we hope that
Congress will be able to restore those
funds next year," Horton said, "but it
could have been much worse."
According to Stanford's 1994-95 bud
get, 23 percent of this year's revenues —
$280 million — was expected to come
from federal support for research. About
15 percent of this total was to come from
the Defense Department.
Administrators said they do not know
exactly how the cuts will affect the Uni
versity.
"There's more to it than just the num
bers," said Dale Tate, the associate direc
tor of governmental relations. Tate said
it was not yet clear whether the federal
cuts would be taken from all universities


Elise Wolfgram — Daily
or from specific programs around the
country.
However, Horton said, "a prudent
person would assume you get a cut at
least across the board."
In that case, administrators worry the
cuts could have serious ramifica
tions for Stanford's research pro
grams although they added that
it is too early to know what
effects it might have on Universi
ty budget cuts. The University is
currently trying to cut its budget
by $18 million over a three-year
period.
"This pretty much filters
through the budget and makes it
very hard for our faculty to get
research money, so initially that
means we'll be able to do less
research here," said Geoffrey Cox,
vice provost of institutional plan
ning, who is currently assuming
many of the budget duties nor
mally handled by Chief Financial
Officer Peter Van Etten.
"We're taking this very seri
ously," Cox added. "This is prob
ably the beginning of a trend that
we should be very worried
about."
The cut diverts federal funding
from academia to other defense
areas, such as military readiness.
For instance, Horton said the con
ference committee may have been
influenced by pressure over a pos
sible military commitment to

Haiti.
But Stanford administrators
took issue with the change, noting
that while the cut may yield
short-term military gains, in the
long term the country will suffer
for not investing in research.
"The kinds of technologies this
research money goes to support
have direct applications in indus
try, the kind of industry that can
fuel the country's transition from
a defense base to a peacetime
industrial base," said Biology
Prof. Craig Heller, the acting
dean of research.
"Therefore, it seems quite silly
for the DOD to cut funding from
the very areas that can best sup
port a conversion from industry
supported by the private sector,"
he said. "It seems extremely
short-sighted."
Although the conference
report must still be approved by
both houses, Tate said the money
allotted for university research
will probably receive little debate.
"From what I understand, [the
figure] was arrived at with a fair
degree of unanimity," she said,
noting that the House may take
up the report as early as tomor
row.
Although the push to cut
funding has been connected to a
dispute between various House

members, Horton said the
change is mainly a result of
"severe pressures" on the federal
budget.
"This is not a manufactured
crisis. There really is a severe cri
sis with the [federal] budget,"he
said.
Whether the original level of
funding will ever be restored is
impossible to know, Horton said.
"Appropriations is a political mat
ter, and Congress does go up and
down," he said.
Earlier this summer, the
House approval of the $900 mil
lion cut drew heavy criticism and
an outpouring of opposition lob
bying from such Stanford officials
as University President Gerhard
Casper and Chemistry Prof.
Richard Zare, a leader in the
attempt to increase campus
awareness concerning the mea
sure.
Casper and Zare both sent let
ters to every member of the U.S.
Senate, urging them to vote
against any cuts.
Casper also joined with the
presidents of the University of
California, USC and Caltech to
send a letter to all California rep
resentatives explaining the rami
fications that cuts of that magni
tude could have on university pro
grams.

an outpouring of opposition lob
bying from such Stanford officials
as University President Gerhard
Casper and Chemistry Prof.
Richard Zare, a leader in the
attempt to increase campus
awareness concerning the mea
sure.
Casper and Zare both sent let
ters to every member of the U.S.
Senate, urging them to vote
against any cuts.
Casper also joined with the
presidents of the University of
California, USC and Caltech to
send a letter to all California rep
resentatives explaining the rami
fications that cuts of that magni

grams.
Ending months of speculation over
possible cuts in Defense Department
funding, a congressional conference com
mittee finished work yesterday, cutting
about $200 million from university re
search programs.
The final cuts are less than the $900
million — about half of the original $1.8
billion budget — that the U.S. House of
Representatives cut in its Defense appro
priations bill last July. In its own Defense
appropriations bill, later in the summer,
the U.S. Senate cut only $82 million.
The conference committee — made
up of negotiators from both the House
and the Senate — settled on a figure be
tween the two amounts. The final cut
represents about 11 percent of the origi
nal funding to universities, leaving $1.6
billion to be distributed nationally during
fiscal year 1994-95, said Larry Horton,
Stanford's director of government rela

tions.
As of last night, the Associated Press
was reporting the total defense research
budget to be only $1.4 billion. The office
of U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.),
however, confirmed the figure of $ 1.6 bil
lion.
"We're disappointed and we hope that
Congress will be able to restore those
funds next year," Horton said, "but it
could have been much worse."
According to Stanford's 1994-95 bud
get, 23 percent of this year's revenues —
$280 million — was expected to come
from federal support for research. About
15 percent of this total was to come from
the Defense Department.
Administrators said they do not know
exactly how the cuts will affect the Uni
versity.
"There's more to it than just the num
bers," said Dale Tate, the associate direc
tor of governmental relations. Tate said
it was not yet clear whether the federal
cuts would be taken from all universities


Elise Wolfgram — Daily
or from specific programs around the
country.
However, Horton said, "a prudent
person would assume you get a cut at
least across the board."
In that case, administrators worry the
cuts could have serious ramifica
tions for Stanford's research pro
grams although they added that
it is too early to know what
effects it might have on Universi
ty budget cuts. The University is
currently trying to cut its budget
by $18 million over a three-year
period.
"This pretty much filters
through the budget and makes it
very hard for our faculty to get
research money, so initially that
means we'll be able to do less
research here," said Geoffrey Cox,
vice provost of institutional plan
ning, who is currently assuming
many of the budget duties nor
mally handled by Chief Financial
Officer Peter Van Etten.
"We're taking this very seri
ously," Cox added. "This is prob
ably the beginning of a trend that
we should be very worried
about."
The cut diverts federal funding
from academia to other defense
areas, such as military readiness.
For instance, Horton said the con
ference committee may have been
influenced by pressure over a pos
sible military commitment to

Haiti.
But Stanford administrators
took issue with the change, noting
that while the cut may yield
short-term military gains, in the
long term the country will suffer
for not investing in research.
"The kinds of technologies this
research money goes to support
have direct applications in indus
try, the kind of industry that can
fuel the country's transition from
a defense base to a peacetime
industrial base," said Biology
Prof. Craig Heller, the acting
dean of research.
"Therefore, it seems quite silly
for the DOD to cut funding from
the very areas that can best sup
port a conversion from industry
supported by the private sector,"
he said. "It seems extremely
short-sighted."
Although the conference
report must still be approved by
both houses, Tate said the money
allotted for university research
will probably receive little debate.
"From what I understand, [the
figure] was arrived at with a fair
degree of unanimity," she said,
noting that the House may take
up the report as early as tomor
row.
Although the push to cut
funding has been connected to a
dispute between various House

members, Horton said the
change is mainly a result of
"severe pressures" on the federal
budget.
"This is not a manufactured
crisis. There really is a severe cri
sis with the [federal] budget,"he
said.
Whether the original level of
funding will ever be restored is
impossible to know, Horton said.
"Appropriations is a political mat
ter, and Congress does go up and
down," he said.
Earlier this summer, the
House approval of the $900 mil
lion cut drew heavy criticism and
an outpouring of opposition lob
