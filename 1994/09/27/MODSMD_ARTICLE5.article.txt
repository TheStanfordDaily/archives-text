# Formed amid turmoil, groups discuss grape ban, ethnic studies
## 
### Allison Short Staff writer 
After spending the summer researching ethnic studies pro
grams and the national grape boycott debate, several newly
formed committees are meeting this week to plan how they will
report their unfinished findings.
The Asian-American Studies committee and the Chicano
Studies committee — formed in the wake of the hunger strike
and other protests last spring — worked this summer to exam
ine ethnic programs at Stanford and other universities, while
the committee on grapes considered whether the University
should support a grape boycott.
Their proposals must be turned in to Provost Condoleezza
Rice and Dean of Humanities John Shoven by the end of fall
quarter.
"The committees are well staffed and ready to go," Rice said.
While the committee on grapes does not have a definite first

meeting scheduled, it will choose the most convenient meeting
time and develop an agenda today, said Political Science Prof.
Luis Fraga, chair of the committee on grapes.
Fraga said he hopes to have the committee's report complet
ed by Thanksgiving.
According to Housing and Dining Services Director Keith
Guy, grapes are currently "part of the standard menu of the fruit
service." Until the individual residences vote on whether or not
to serve grapes with the standard fruit menu, grapes will remain
part of the normal meal, said Guy.
Over the summer, the committee examined literature on top
ics such as the effect of toxic pesticides on consumers and work
ers. Fraga also looked at other universities' decisions on the
grape boycott in order to understand how and why these deci
sions were reached.
"We will research everything and anything there is to do
about grapes," said junior Vanessa Alvarado, a Council of Presi-
dents member who is doing
research for the committee. "It's
going to be a hard report, but it has
to be perfect."
In the future, Fraga hopes to
hold organized public hearings and
publicly list all of the documents
and videos the committee is using.
"I would like to educate the
broader community as to this
issue," Fraga said. "We also want to
provide a clear educational role on
understanding all the background
information of whether or not to
support the boycott," Fraga said.
The Asian-American Studies
committee, chaired by Political
Science Prof. Daniel Okimoto, has
a meeting scheduled for this
Thursday.
Throughout the summer, the
committee tried to determine a
program which would best suit
Stanford, according to first-year
law student Leslie Hatamiya, a
summer research assistant for the

committee.
"We're currently looking at all
of the options and models that

exist which we
could emulate,"
Hatamiya said.
In addition to
examining back
ground informa
tion, Hatamiya
has started to
study Stanford's
existing interdis
ciplinary pro
grams, such as

the Jewish and Feminist Studies
programs, to see what they can
gain from working with similar
ethnic studies programs.
The Asian-American Studies
committee also spent a portion of
the summer working with the Chi
cano Studies committee, said Dean
of Undergraduate Studies Ramon
Saldivar, a member of the Asian-
American Studies committee and
chair of the Chicano Studies com
mittee.
"Whenever we found applicable
information we shared it with
them (the Asian-American Studies

committee) and vice-versa," Sal
divar said. "We established good
working relationships."
The Chicano Studies commit
tee, which will meet on Friday,
spent the summer researching
Stanford's existing departments,
as well as similar programs at
other universities to see what
would benefit Stanford.
"Our purpose is to explore what
is best and what we want here at
Stanford," junior Lubia Sanchez
said.
Saldivar said he spent the sum
mer researching background infor
mation and attending meetings
with leaders from departments
such as the African-American
Studies program and the Jewish
Studies program.
Currently, the committee is
focusing on a report to Shoven
about whether or not to proceed
with the Chicano Studies program,
said Saldivar.
"Once the report is in we can
think about long-term changes,"
Saldivar said.
"Right now our top priority is to
meet the deadline," Sanchez added.
