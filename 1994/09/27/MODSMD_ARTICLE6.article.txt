# Scalper crackdown at Stadium
## 
### Michael Slemmer Editorial staff 
The law draws a fine line between scalping tick
ets to events and merely selling them illegally.
But either way, Stanford Police are now crack
ing down on all ticket sellers who traditionally
hound spectators as they enter Stanford Stadium
for Saturday football games.
Responding to a University request, the po
lice are now enfotcing a law which prohibits
unauthorized people from selling tickets — at
any price — near the stadium. In previous years,
the police only enforced scalping laws, which
prohibit reselling a ticket for more than its face

value, said Sgt. John McMullen of the Stanford
Police.
"We didn't have a whole lot [of arrests] from
scalping as a whole," McMullen said. "[Now] you
have to be able to provide records that you are a
legitimate business" to sell the tickets legally.
Otherwise, "you can be arrested for a misde
meanor."
The decision to fully enforce ticket-selling laws
comes in light of 17 incidents of scalping tickets
this summer during the World Cup.
At last Saturday's football game, the average
price per ticket among illegitimate ticket sellers
was well below the face value of
the tickets. One seller offered $25
general admission tickets for $15,
while another was willing to sell
an $8 student ticket for as little as
$6.
"I buy students' tickets for two
bucks," said one seller who did

not disclose his name. "If I sell
them for six, I can make a pretty
good profit each week."
According to McMullen, being
convicted for the crime could
result in fines or even jail time.
"Some of the [ticket sellers]
migrate from game to game and
concert to concert," he said. "A lot
of times we'll already have war
rants for these people's arrest."
In their campaign against the
illegal ticket sellers at Saturday's

football game, however, the police
did not arrest any sellers. Instead,
they gave "no more than 10" one
time warnings, McMullen said.
"If we get them a second time,
we'll arrest them."
Despite the lack of arrests, he
said the enforcement seems to be
working. "The people we warned
seemed to understand that we are
serious in pursuing this policy,"
McMullen said. "Next week, we'll
see if any of them come back."
