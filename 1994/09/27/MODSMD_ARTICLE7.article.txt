# Serving time at the Law School
## Kochen new service law czar 
### T.W. Mark Hung 
Thanks to John Grisham's novels and glossy law
school brochures, the prevailing image of graduating
law students seems to be of smart, successful corpo
rate climbers pursued by many large and prestigious
law firms.
But not all law students fit this mold.
In recent years, Stanford students have become
known for their increasing interest in public service
litigation. Noting this rising student and faculty con
cern for public interest law, the Law School has hired
New York attorney Madeline Kochen as Director of
Public Interest Law Programs.
"My responsibilities are to present public interest
law to the students, and to represent the students in
the public interest law community," Kochen said.
"I will not be just providing career counseling," she
added, "But also advising students on what courses to
take and to present opportunities to them."
Paul Brest, dean of the Law School, agreed that

having a full-time director will be
a great asset to the students.
"This permanent full-time
position was created in order to
strengthen the public interest
programs and career opportuni
ties," said Brest. "A great deal of
the position will be developed at
the discretion of the director, and
(Kochen) is energetic enough to
bring a lot to the post."
The term "public interest" law
refers to any law that involves
working with the government,
the poor, the environment, civil
rights organizations or any other
non-profit organizations, Kochen
said.
"There is a lot of enthusiasm
for public interest law in this
school," she said, adding that a
large number of faculty teach
public interest law and the pro
grams that are already in place.
Kochen noted that increased
interest in public interest law is
not isolated to Stanford, but is a
nationwide phenomenon. New
public interest law programs have
been created at Harvard, New
York University and Columbia in
the last five years.
The situation was very differ
ent when Kochen got her law
degree in 1981, she said, crediting
her years of civil rights experience
as having shaped her into the ser
vice-minded lawyer she is today.

Kochen became a very religious
person as a teenager, "mostly
because of my grandparents," she
said. As a result, she attended
Yeshiva University and majored
in Jewish Studies. Before enter
ing law school, she studied Tal
mudic, or Jewish, law in Israel.
But the more she delved into
the subject, the more disenchant
ed she became.
"Judaism is centered on its
rich legal system," Kochen said.
"Education is valued, and its laws
cover everything from religious
rituals to day-to-day activities."
"Because it is a religious law, it
can have morality in it," she said.
"But because it is dated, it does
discriminate based on sex, and I
found it difficult to break in."
Kochen finally abandoned Tal
mudic law and pursued a career in
public interest law. She received
her law degree from Yeshiva and
became very active in women's
issues and working with the
under-privileged.
At one point, she worked for
three years as a lobbyist for the
American Civil Liberties Union, a
position which she said helped her
gain valuable experience dealing
with women's rights and other
public interest issues.
Her experience with civil rights
issues further expanded when she
worked as a law assistant for New
York Supreme Court Justice
Elliott Wilk (of Woody Allen-Mia
Farrow divorce case fame), she
said.
The experience led her to a new

interest: divorce law.
"While there have been
improvements in the last few
years, the legal views (on divorce)
are still old fashioned," Kochen
said. She started doing research
on the history of legal bondage
and suggested ways of improving
women's legal status in divorce
cases, she said.
Kochen was also at the fore
front of other emerging civil
rights issues. During her 14
years of practicing law, she ran
across several "flagship" cases,
one of which dealt with sexual
harrassment "long before sexual
harassment became popular,"
she said.
In this case, a Penthouse Pet
sued the publisher of Penthouse
because he promised her that he
would make her a movie star.
Instead, he made her sleep with
his clients. Wilk ruled in favor of
the woman because he said sexual
harassment may take place even
though it is not directly between
the victim and the harasser.
Such cases have given Kochen
the reputation and experience of
being an accomplished and ener
getic public interest attorney.
Although she has spent most of
her illustrious public interest law
career in New York, moving out to
California has always been in the
back of Kochen's mind.
"Basically, I couldn't take New
York City any more," she said. "I
have always wanted to move to
California. This is a great oppor
tunity . . . I'm excited to be here."

public interest law programs have
been created at Harvard, New
York University and Columbia in
the last five years.
The situation was very differ
ent when Kochen got her law
degree in 1981, she said, crediting
her years of civil rights experience
as having shaped her into the ser
vice-minded lawyer she is today.

Kochen became a very religious
person as a teenager, "mostly
because of my grandparents," she
said. As a result, she attended
Yeshiva University and majored
in Jewish Studies. Before enter
ing law school, she studied Tal
mudic, or Jewish, law in Israel.
But the more she delved into
the subject, the more disenchant
ed she became.
"Judaism is centered on its
rich legal system," Kochen said.
"Education is valued, and its laws
cover everything from religious
rituals to day-to-day activities."
"Because it is a religious law, it
can have morality in it," she said.
"But because it is dated, it does
discriminate based on sex, and I
found it difficult to break in."
Kochen finally abandoned Tal
mudic law and pursued a career in
public interest law. She received
her law degree from Yeshiva and
became very active in women's
issues and working with the
under-privileged.
At one point, she worked for
three years as a lobbyist for the
American Civil Liberties Union, a
position which she said helped her
gain valuable experience dealing
with women's rights and other
public interest issues.
Her experience with civil rights
issues further expanded when she
worked as a law assistant for New
York Supreme Court Justice
Elliott Wilk (of Woody Allen-Mia
Farrow divorce case fame), she
said.
The experience led her to a new

interest: divorce law.
"While there have been
improvements in the last few
years, the legal views (on divorce)
are still old fashioned," Kochen
said. She started doing research
on the history of legal bondage
and suggested ways of improving
women's legal status in divorce
cases, she said.
Kochen was also at the fore
front of other emerging civil
rights issues. During her 14
years of practicing law, she ran
across several "flagship" cases,
one of which dealt with sexual
harrassment "long before sexual
harassment became popular,"
she said.
In this case, a Penthouse Pet
sued the publisher of Penthouse
because he promised her that he
would make her a movie star.
Instead, he made her sleep with
his clients. Wilk ruled in favor of
the woman because he said sexual
harassment may take place even
though it is not directly between
the victim and the harasser.
Such cases have given Kochen
the reputation and experience of
being an accomplished and ener
getic public interest attorney.
Although she has spent most of
her illustrious public interest law
career in New York, moving out to
California has always been in the
back of Kochen's mind.
"Basically, I couldn't take New
York City any more," she said. "I
have always wanted to move to
California. This is a great oppor
tunity . . . I'm excited to be here."
