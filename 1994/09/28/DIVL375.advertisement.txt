"\Ne thought zee were
going to have two kids,
maybe three at most, but
that all changed when we
had the boys. I've been
really pleased with the aire
we've received at the Palo
Alto Medical Foundation.
Our pediatrician, Dr. Ross
DeHovitz, has been
wonderful. In fact, I've
been very impressed with
the entire pediatrics
department.
"We're really thrilled
about these guys and can't
imagine not having any
one of them. Having a
large family is a neat thing.
The boys are just great.
Until you'iv a jKinnit, you
can't even imagine the joy
children can bring."
