Wanna play IM's
this quarter?
Got a football team? Or a 6x6 volleyball team? Maybe some
3-on-3 hoops, or even a free throw tournament? Tennis or
racquetball anyone?
Sign up for these sports and more tomorrow starting at 7 a.m. at
Ford Center. Slots go quickly, so better line up early! Sign-ups should
end around 10 a.m.
Note: teams interested in playing football, volleyball or innertube water polo
need to bring a deposit check of $75 per team, which will be returned at the
end of the quarter if no games are forfeited.
Any questions? Call the I.M. office at 5-0753
