## ASSU to take over as new management of Tresidder Rec Center 
### Beth Berselli Senior staff writer 
Pending senate approval next Tues
day, the ASSU will assume management
of the Recreation Center on the ground
door of Tresidder Memorial Union as a
new business project.
This project marks the first time the
ASSU has planned a major expansion of
its business interest in Tresidder since
several years ago when poor manage
ment and financial difficulties forced the
ASSU to turn the Coffee House over to

Bon Appetit, which runs Tresidder's
other food services.
The ASSU is presently operating the
center, but it won't become an "official
business project of the ASSU" unless the
senate approves its budget on Tuesday,
said ASSU Financial Manager Gabe
Lucas.
Council of Presidents member Vanes
sa Alvarado said she is "optimistic" that
the proposal will win approval at Tues
day's meeting.
"This is a really good opportunity for
the ASSU to expand its business pro

jects," said Alvarado, a junior. "The Itec
Center provides an important service for
students and having it located in the stu
dent union is only logical."
The center was previously managed
by Tresidder administrators, but in
June the University brought in Stanford
Management Company's Shopping Cen
ter Division to manage the Union's retail
services and the center's management
fell to them.
In late July, Stanford Management
Company offered the ASSU a chance to
take over management of the center,
Lucas said.
If the proposal is voted down during
Tuesday's meeting, management
responsibilities for the center will revert
to Stanford Management Company.
However, most parties feel sure the
ASSU is the right management for the
center.
"We felt students would be better
equipped to perform the extensive on-site
management necessary for the center,"
said Dorothea Gregowski, assistant direc
tor of the Stanford Shopping Center.
"Staffing-wise it made more sense to let
students already on campus manage the
center than to hire new people to do it for
us. It just seemed to be a natural fit."
Since the ASSU already has "cash
operations" in Tresidder — such as the

Cardinal Collection, which replaced the
Shirt Shak this year, and ASSU Lecture
Notes — it will be easy to take over man
agement of the center, said Lucas, a
senior.
Lucas added that assuming manage
ment of the center will give the ASSU
the chance to work in partnership with
Stanford Management Company.
"We will have the opportunity to
show them that we have the ability to be
involved in the day-to-day activities of
Tresidder," he said.
Currently, the center houses a video
rental machine and a game room, com
plete with pool tables and video games.
Students am also register their bicycles
and rent camping equipment from the
center.
Lucas said the ASSU plans to
enhance the center's facilities by
installing automated pool tables, offer
ing a wider range of video games, and
improving the quality of the camping
equipment available for rental.
There are "not a lot of major changes

we're looking at, at least for the short
term," Lucas said. "But even doing the
little things to draw people in will be to
the ever)' one's benefit — from both a
service and financial standpoint."
The ASSU may look to expand the
center by trying out "some new and differ
ent ideas later in the future," Lucas said.
Although the center has operated in
the red previously, Lucas said he's confi
dent the ASSU won't lose money on the
project. "We won't have the high admin
istrative costs that Tresidder did when
they managed it,"he said.
Lucas said he expects the center to
net at the most several thousand dollars
per year, which will go into the ASSU's
operating budget to be used for current
and future business projects.
"We're not expecting it to be a cash
cow or anything, but it will help us main
tain our current services," he said.
Recreation Center manager Robert
Ernest said no more than five people will
staff the center, in addition to the three
managers.
