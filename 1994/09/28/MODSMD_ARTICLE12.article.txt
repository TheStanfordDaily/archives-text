# Clinton, Yeltsin debate arms
## Presidents discuss differences over Russian military sales to Iran 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” After pledges
of partnership, President Clinton and
Boris Yeltsin sat down to differences yes
terday about the war in Bosnia and Rus
sian arms sides to Iran.
Their emphasis was on business deals,
with hundreds of millions of dollars ear
marked for investments in Russia.
"Our nations are growing closer
together, replacing suspicion and fear
with trust and cooperation," Clinton said,
welcoming Yeltsin to the White House
with a handshake and a hug.
The burly Russian president said they
would prove skeptics wrong and make
"great progress" in two days of discus
sions. "It is fair to say that the United
Suites is a strong partner and not an easy
one to deal with, just like Russia," Yeltsin
said.
In search of informality, Clinton and

Yeltsin moved their talks from the Oval
Office to an outdoor garden patio. Accom
panied only by note-takers, they sat in
wrought iron chairs and tiilked for two
hours across a glass-topped table. Defense
and foreign ministers of the two countries
met separately in the Cabinet Room and
Roosevelt Room.
Clinton tried at length to persuade
Yeltsin to stop sales of submarines, mis
sile technology, air armaments and other
equipment to Iran, which Ls accused by
Washington of sponsoring terrorism. A
senior administration official said it was
unlikely Clinton would succeed.
Desperate for cash, Moscow is believed
to do a billion dollars worth of arms deals
annually with Iran.
More likely, officials said, was that
Russia would join the United States in
pledging voluntary reductions in nuclear

arsenals.
On a warm, sunny morning, Yeltsin
was welcomed with a 21-gun salute and
trumpet heralds on the South Lawn.
Clinton noted the absence of drama and
suspicion that frequently were a hallmark
of Cold War summits.
"Today we meet not as adversaries but
as partners in the quest for a more pros
perous and peaceful world," Clinton said.
"In so many areas our interests no longer
conflict; they coincide. And where we do
disagree, we can discuss our differences in
a climate of warm peace, not cold war."
Differences over the war in Bosnia imme
diately emerged as they settled into the Oval
Office for a half-hour of private Uilks.
Yeltsin bluntly said he would oppose
any move by Clinton to lift a IJ.N. embar
go in order to arm the Muslim-led Bosni
an government.
