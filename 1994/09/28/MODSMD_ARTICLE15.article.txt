With new grading policy,
faculty must recognize
responsibilities as well

LAST JUNK, THE Faculty
Senate earned nationwide
media attention by passing a
new grading policy which, among
other things, instituted an "NP"
grade for failed classes, tightened
add/drop deadlines and restricted
the policy for retaking courses.
The University drew wide praise
from pundits who perceived it as a
step toward eliminating grade infla
tion that many believe pervades
higher education. But aside from
giving the University a PR boost,
the new grading policy could have
far-reaching and dire implications
for students — and for the Univer
sity's standing as a respected insti
tution — unless the Faculty Senate
follows through on its commitment
to approach teaching and evalua
tion more seriously
At the June 2 meeting when the
Faculty Senate passed the new poli
cy, senators stressed that increased
faculty accountability had to follow.
Hut beyond lip service, there has
been no corresponding commit
ment as yet from the faculty to
ensure that students have the
information and materials they
need to approach their work
responsibly.
Too often in Stanford classes,
syllabi are produced late, course
readers and textbooks are not
immediately available and assign
ments and papers are not returned
promptly. Weeks often pass before
students have enough information
to discern whether they have
assumed a course load that is too
large or too difficult.
Such delays can be devastating to
students, especially at Stanford,
where an academic period is
squeezed into a ten-week quarter
rather than a fifteen-week
semester.

Delays are sometimes beyond a
professor's control. But often, they
can be avoided with a little careful,
conscientious planning — planning
that has as yet been woefully scarce
among much of Stanford's faculty
The previous, less stringent
grading policy offered students a
way to make up for a professor's
irresponsible behavior, allowing
them to drop courses until the end
of a quarter or retake courses in a
later quarter without penalty. But
now that the faculty has closed off
this escape route, it has become
even more urgent that they act
more responsibly in administering
courses.
The Faculty Senate should draft
a resolution condemning lax course
preparation by professors and
affirming the faculty's commitment
to prompt and accurate evaluation.
The resolution should be backed
by sound policy ensuring account
ability among professors. As a start,
the senate could establish a skele
ton system within department
offices through which students
could file complaints about improp
erly organized courses.
The senate should also work to
ensure that students receive some
sort of performance evaluation
before the fourth week of each
quarter. When possible, grades
should be accompanied by com
ments and suggestions that might
help students improve their perfor
mances.
The Senate should also take long
overdue steps toward forming a
coherent Dead Week policy, such as
creating two truly "Dead Days" at
the end of a quarter — a proposal
recommended by the Academic Cal
endar Committee of the Commis
sion on Undergraduate Education.
Last spring, the chair of the
Committee on Academic Appraisal
and Achievement, Geology Prof.
Gail Mahood, expressed hope that
the stricter grading policy would
"send a clear message to students
to take the life of the mind serious
ly." Now it's time the faculty got
that message too.
