## James V. Risser Is the media running out of Juice? 
### 
Lawyers have a say
ing that "hard
cases make bad
law." As the O.J. Simp
son case shows, they also
make bad journalism.
The way the media
hits run amok in its cover
age is an indication of
media trends today — a

fascination with the bizarre, a developing cult
of celebrity, and the triumph of tabloid jour
nalism, both print and broadcast.
On the ot her hand, the Simpson case is a
truly spectacular situation involving a
nationally famous former football star
allegedly stabbing his ex-wife to death. In
traditional journalistic terms, it's a great
story, and massive coverage was inevitable.
But the excess has been breathtaking,
beginning with the 112 reeway chase and con
tinuing all the way to the courtroom door
and this week's start of the jury selection
process.
"I'm so saturated by the irresponsibility
of the media that I'm beyond being out
raged," Judge Lance Ito said last week in
announcing that he was "contemplating
terminating" media coverage of the case.
Ito's ire was aroused by a mainstream
media outlet — the NBC station in Los
Angeles — twice airing a report about
bloody socks in Simpson's house that sup
posedly matched the blood of his former
wife. Ito called the report both unfair and
wrong, and, noting that he had put the sta
tion on notice after its first broadcast,
warned that the incident "impacts upon Mr.
Simpson's right to a fair trial."
As the jury selection process began, the
judge cooled off and seemed to back down on

his no-coverage threat. But media coverage
will continue to be a key issue in the ques
tion of whether Simpson am receive a fair
trial; it is certain to be raised on appeal if
Simpson is convicted.
A four-person panel at Stanford I>aw
School last week ended in a hungjury on the
fair-trial question. A former U.S. district
attorney and a national newsmagazine legal
reporter said Simpson am get a fair trial
despite the publicity barrage. A television
station news director and a law school pro
fessor who once headed a public defender
service said "no."
As the magazine writer pointed out, the
news media have no actual duty to guaran
ty a defendant a fair trial; that is the task of
the legal system. The system, represented
by prosecution and defense attorneys who
seem all too eager to leak juicy items to
reporters, has performed poorly.
Still, the chances are reasonably good that
even jurors who have been affected by the
saturation coverage can put aside their opin
ions and base their decision on the evidence
and the arguments made in the courtroom.
The more sweeping concern about the
media's fascination with the Simpson case is
what it says about today's trends in news
coverage.
The media have begun, as never before,
to feed a perceived public interest in the
immediate and in celebrities. Tabloid print
journalism is affecting the behavior of more
conventional newspapers and magazines
afraid of losing the fight for circulation and
advertising.
Television, always ready to air the super
ficial and to make simplistic pronounce
ments on complex matters, is even worse.
The so-called TV newsmagazines have

largely degraded the investigative broadcast
journalism begun by programs like "60
Minutes."
The result is that vast news resources —
personnel mid money — are devoted to
Simpson, Bobbitt and their ilk, while news
coverage of more far-reaching importance
to people's lives suffers.
There's an election in California this
November, in which voters will choose a
governor and a U.S. senator, decide on a
restrictive immigration proposal, and vote
"yes" or "no" on a single-payer health care
proposition.
But will the citizens notice? Opinion sur
veys and low voter turnouts attest to the
fact that Americans are losing interest in
government and public affairs. It's an open
question whether that's due to our deficient
education system, an understandable disil
lusionment with government or the superfi
cialities foisted upon us by the news media.
In any case, it won't do for the media to
fall back on the old excuse t hat "we give peo
ple what they want." The privileged role of
the media in American society demands
something more, a commitment to educate
people about the real issues and to help
them reach wise decisions.
But that requires creativity at the media
management level, smart reporters in the
field, and a devotion to matters of conse
quence. Unfortunately, it's much easier to
station dozens of satellite trucks and hun
dreds of print and broadcast journalists at
the courthouse steps.

question whether that's due to our deficient
education system, an understandable disil
lusionment with government or the superfi
cialities foisted upon us by the news media.
In any case, it won't do for the media to
fall back on the old excuse t hat "we give peo
ple what they want." The privileged role of
the media in American society demands
something more, a commitment to educate
people about the real issues and to help
them reach wise decisions.
But that requires creativity at the media
management level, smart reporters in the
field, and a devotion to matters of conse
quence. Unfortunately, it's much easier to
station dozens of satellite trucks and hun
dreds of print and broadcast journalists at
the courthouse steps.
