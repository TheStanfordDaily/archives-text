## 25 members named 
### Marc Lee Staff writer 
As part of the University's ef
fort to restructure the Medical
Center, the newly formed Stan
ford Health Services group has
formed an advisory committee to
deal specifically with issues aris
ing from the Stanford Hospital.
And less than a month after of
ficially taking office September 1,
the Stanford Health Services Hos
pital Board met last Wednesday to
begin laying the groundwork for
an improved health care system at
Stanford.
During an August 26 meeting,
t he board of directors for Stanford
Health Services ratified the 25 ap
pointees named by the University
Board of Trustees. The new ap
pointees include University
trustees Peter S. Bing and Isaac
Stein.
"The hospital board will focus
on community-based issues,
fund-raising issues and the quali
ty of patient care," said Peter Van
Etten, who is the SHS interim
president and chief executive offi
cer, as well as a hospital board
member.
At the first meeting, the hospi
tal board looked at the SHS board
of directors and its role, discussed
the SHS strategic plan and
looked at the organizational
structure of SHS.
William Davidow, vice chair of
the new hospital board, said he
sees the board as "a group of peo
ple interested in the hospital and
improving the quality of care,
improving relations with the com
munity, and making sure it can
support the community and aca
demic mission" of the Medical
Center.
"With all the trauma going on
in health care, a lot of the quality
of health care will be a direct
result of the interest the commu

nity takes in it," said Davidow, a
venture capitalist in Menlo Park
who has been interested in quali
ty and service issues, as well as
marketing, for a number of years.
Stanford Health Services is a
non-profit management group
that will merge and oversee the
clinical activities of Stanford Hos
pital and the former clinics of the
School of Medicine.
SHS originated from a review
ordered by University President
Gerhard Casper of how the Medi
cal Center conducts business.
The hospital board will act as
an advisory group to the SHS

Board of Directors, said Linda
Meier, a community leader from
Atherton who began serving on
the Stanford University Hospital
Board of Directors in 1978 and
will chair the hospital board. It
will examine community-based
health care, quality of care and
fund-raising issues. The board
will then establish relevant pro
grams.
Among other duties, it will also
act as the appellate body for med
ical staff issues, Meier said. It will
establish formal organizations for
operations of the medical staff
and will review and approve all

medical staff by-laws.
While the University trustees
also named the members of the
SHS board of directors, it has del
egated authority for that body to
oversee the SHS Hospital Board,
said Van Etten, who took a leave
from his position as the Universi
ty's Chief Financial Officer to
lead SHS.
The new board has three com
mittees designed to carry out its
goals: community outreach, devel
opment, and quality and organiza
tional improvement. These
committees have already been
formed and continue to meet.
