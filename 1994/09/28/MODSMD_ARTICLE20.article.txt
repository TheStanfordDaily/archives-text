Football fans depressed by early sea
son disappointments — including a big
loss to Arizona and the cancellation oi
the Big Game bonfire — have at least one
thing to celebrate as they await the clas
sic battle with UC-Berkeley.
Big Game tickets, which had beei:
available to students at half-price onlv
when purchased along with season tick
ets, are now available for individual salt
at the discount student price of $16.
The normal Big Game ticket price i>
$32, but the University decided to offer
the individual discounts in response t(

numerous student complaints about high
prices, according to ticket manager Konn
Rauschenbach.
In previous years, the Department of
Athletics has sold the Big Game tickets
separately, but its policy has changed
from year to year. According to
Rauschenbach, this year's decision was
based on the number of tickets available
to students, as well as student input.
Response to the change has so far been
good, and the ticket office has sold plenty of
season tickets anyway, Rauschenbach said.
Season tickets also continue to be avail
able for $40 and include the three remain
ing home games and Big Game, which is at
UC-Berkeley this year on Nov. 19.
