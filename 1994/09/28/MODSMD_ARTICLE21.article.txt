## Free electron lasers: Creating new research potential in many fields 
### Julie Sauer Editorial staff 
Hidden deep in the bowels of Stan
ford, protected by an elaborate warning
system, lies a machine that is advancing
the frontiers of science. This technology
is not an apparatus for mass destruc
tion, however, but a device for probing
small secrets of creation.
Housed in Hansen Labs, the
machine, known as the free electron
laser (FEL), was developed by a
research team including Todd Smith
and Alan Schwettman, professors of
Physics at Stanford.
The free electron laser produces
extremely short pulses of infrared radi
ation at wavelengths outside the range
of conventional lasers. The light wave
lengths emitted can be 'tuned' or
adjusted to match a desired wavelength.
The infrared pulses produced by the
FEL offer many possibilities for
research in the fields of chemistry,
physics, and biology. According to
Schwettman, FEL experiments have
proliferated mainly in the last four
years, although the first experiments
were conducted in the mid-19705.
Smith explained the reason for the
growing interest in FEL experimental
use: "In the infrared, particularly in the
10 to 100 micron range, there are no
competing sources [of light| . . .if you're
talking about the picosecond pulses of
light, the spectral purity, . . . and the
intensity of the light."
Schwettman and Smith's research
group helped to develop the supercon
ducting accelerator technology which is
now used to drive the FEL. The super
conducting cavities that provide fields
for electron acceleration in the FEL are
made of niobium, a material that
changes from a poor electrical conduc
tor to an excellent conductor below nine
degrees Kelvin.
As a result, the laser only operates at
extremely low temperatures. The FEL
is cooled by a helium refrigeration sys
tem. Helium at room temperature and
high pressure expands and does work on
a piston, loses energy, drops to two
degrees Kelvin, and circulates to cool
the laser cavity.

The refrigeration process takes a
week before the laser is operational.
The electron beam is generated from
a cathode, or an 'electron gun.' Smith
said that the cathode is nearly the same
as that in a TV set. "There's a piece of
hot material that boils electrons off of it
and they get accelerated by a fairly low
voltage (100,000 volts) to form a beam
that then gets accelerated farther by the
accelerating cavities," he said.
Hy the time the beam reaches the
body of the laser, it has an energy level
between 30 to 60 million electron volts.
The heart of the FEL is a magnetic
field known as a \viggler.' The perma
nent magnets of the wiggler generate a
magnetic field that goes across the axis
of the wiggler but changes sign every
three centimeters.
An electron travelling through the
field wiggles up and down. When the
electron beam changes direction, it radi
ates light that ultimately comes out
above the laser tunnel in rooms where
researchers conduct experiments.
The light generated by the electrons
is the same wavelength as the wiggler,
but it is shifted up in frequency by the
Doppler effect.
The Doppler effect occurs when the
frequency of sound or light waves
changes relative to the position of an
observer or a reference point. For exam
ple, when a train is approaching the sta
tion, an observer at the station will hear
an increase in pitch alt hough the engine
is emitting sound at a constant frequen
cy.
In the FEL, the light generated by
the electrons has the same three cen
timeter wavelength as the wiggler.
However, since this light is 'chased' by
electrons with velocities approaching
light speed, the frequency of the light
increases.
Because of the Doppler shift, the
light emitted from the FEL has wave
lengths that are shorter than the wave
length of the wiggler by factors 10,000
to 100,000.
The FEL has produced green visible
light, but it is most useful in the
infrared region because there are sim
pler lasers that produce visible light.
The ability to tune the FEL comes

from the Doppler shift. "It's tin* differ
ence between the velocity of the elec
tron and the velocity of light that is the
key," Smith explained. "The velocity of
the electron is affected by the energy of
the electron. If you change the energy of
the electron, you change its speed."
By adjusting the electron beam ener
gy or the magnetic field strength, the
light wavelength can be easily tuned.
"The technology for manipulating elec
tron beams is very, very, well developed
and much more flexible than the tech
nology for conventional lasers," Smith
said.
In the past, chemists and material
scientists had to design experiments
that used wavelengths available from
exist ing lasers, and that was restrict i\c.

"Now we don't have that restriction,"
Smith said.
The light emitted by the electrons
goes through the wiggler and bounces
back after hitting a mirror at the other
end. The returning pulse then coincides
with the next emitted pulse and is
amplified. Each time the pulse travels
through the wiggler, the amplification
process continues until there are mil
lions of watts light bouncing back and
forth.
A relatively small amount of the light
generated by the laser escapes through
the mirror and is used in the experi
mental rooms above the tunnel.
The laser is guarded by several
defense mechanisms that prevent user
injury, because the machine is danger
ous when operating. If the high veloci
ty electrons impact something, they
will generate 'breaking radiation' as
they stop, and they may ionize the tar
get. and cause cellular damage in a per
son. This could result in cataracts or
cancer.
Part of the laser is also radioactive,
but the strength of the radioactivity
drops rapidly as distance increases.
The Stanford FEL offers 1500 hours
of operating time each year in a series of
operational runs. The next run will
start near the end of October.
Stanford scientists who use the FEL
for research include Kristen Peterson
(physical chemist), Michael Fayer
(chemistry professor), and James Har
ris (Chesebrough professor of Electrical
Engineering). Peterson examines how
vibrational energy is stored and trans
ferred in enzymes and proteins, study
ing the protein myoglobin, found in

muscle cells, to see how individual
atoms interact with each other in the
molecule.
Fayer is using the machine's fast
infrared pulses to study the dynamics of
molecules in condensed phases systems.
His research group looks at the dynam
ics of molecular vibration in the interac
tion between carbon monoxide and
myoglobin. Fayer examines how energy
(lows out of the carbon monoxide (CO)
molecule and into the myoglobin when
the CO molecule is bound at the active
site of the protein.
"The FEL is the only device existing
that produces short pulses of infrared
light over the entire range of energies
relevant to molecules," Fayer said.
Lastly, Harris uses the FEL to devel
op light sources using non-linear optics.
His lab grows crystals at low tem
peratures so they will retain configura
tions that would otherwise be unstable.
The crystals form 'wells' and 'holes' to
trap electrons.
The electrons are spatially confined
by the wells and holes, so they emit
light more efficiently when they fall
into these compartments. The wave
length of the photons emitted depends
on the distance between different atoms
in the crystal layers.
By controlling crystal growth,
researchers can create photons of spe
cific wavelengths. The FEL helps mea
sure optical absorption and non-linear
optical coefficients that are necessary
for Harris' work.
"Not very often do you find a ten mil
lion dollar experimental tool that hap
pens to be a hundred yards away," he
said.
