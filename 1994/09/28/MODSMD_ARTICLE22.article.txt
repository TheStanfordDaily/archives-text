# Beyond Dervish:
## Many robotics projects thriving at Stanford

Stanford's robotics research
facilities emphasize making robots
autonomous and dexterous so they
can perform minute and delicate
tasks.
"The quest is taking a machine
and giving it more intelligence and
autonomy," said James Kuffner,
Ph.D. student in the computer sci
ence robotics lab. "The challenge of
programming is to come up with a
control algorithm to translate a task
into a series of motor actions," Kuffn
er added.
This process is called path plan
ning; it describes the problem of
making a car travel from point A to
point B or making a robot arm
move from one configuration to the
next.
Robotics programmers try to
make machines 'smarter' using
compiex computations that enable
robots to perform tasks that are
effortless for humans.
Robots differ from computers in
that robots must orient themselves
in a three dimensional world.
"Computers interact in a virtual
world, while robots interact in a
real world," Kuffner explained,
adding that robots must sense their
surroundings and anticipate how to
act in varying circumstances.
In the Aeronautics and Astro
nautics robotics lab, researchers
emphasize cooperation between
humans and robots. "What our lab
is trying to do is to work on human

robot teams," said Ph.D. student
David Meer. The lab would like to
develop human-robot interactions
at a high level, so the human could
direct the robot in general task
specification, Meer said.
Astronauts, for example, must
now move space shuttle robot arms
one joint at a time. The process is
slow and limits the tasks that can
be accomplished this way. Instead,
researchers want to make robots
more autonomous, so the machines
could perform tasks like catching
the Hubble space telescope.
Researchers in the robotics field,
or the field of 'artificial intelli
gence,' generally split into two
camps. Those who subscribe to
strong artificial intelligence (AI)
believe that "complex and intelli
gent behavior will emerge from
simple systems," Kuffner said.
"They think that the intelligence of
computers will surpass that of
humans."
On the other hand, proponents
of weak AI believe that humans can
build tools to aid the progress of sci
ence, but they cannot build a
machine that will have original
thought.
"In [the field of] AI you are hum
bled by the power of the human
brain," Kuffner said.
Making 'thinking' robots is not
the goal of the aero-astro lab either,
Meer said, adding that "until the
technology catches up to where
humans can be replaced by comput
ers, that [thinking robots] is not
what we want."
