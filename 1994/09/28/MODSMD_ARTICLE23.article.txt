# Getting underneath the skin

A: Well, before we go into an
in-depth discussion of itch
ing, let's get some terminol
ogy down. The technical name for
any kind of itching is pruritis. It's
interesting to note that this word
comes from the same Latin root

as prurient
(wanton,
lustful).
The neu
ral pathway
for itching
is actually
very similar
to that for
pain. In
fact, until
recently,
people
believed the
pathways
were the
same. They
noticed that

lightly stimulating certain
points on the skin caused an itch
or tickle sensation (like rubbing
a feather underneath you nose),
while stronger stimulation
could cause pain.
Scientists discovered that the
neurons that transmit itching
and pain are located in the same
nerve bundle. Different nerves
in the bundle carry each sensa
tion, but many of the same neu

rotransmitters are involved in
both processes.
This similarity makes sense,
since both pain and itch are
warnings that something
around you might be causing
problems for your body. Itching
probably evolved to alert the
body to parasites or other
creepy-crawly things that may
burrow into your skin.
As part of this self-defense, the
desire to scratch an itch is actual
ly a spinal reflex, like pulling your
hand away from a fire. (Next time
you get a random itch, notice
afterward that sometimes you
scratch without even consciously
thinking about it.) However,
humans do have a large amount
of control over this reflex.
People still aren't sure why
scratching relieves the itch. One
theory holds that scratching
actually damages the nerve end
ings that are transmitting the
itch, and it takes about 15 min
utes to repair the damage.
Another proposal is that all
that sensory input basically
over-rides the itch feeling. This
would be your body's way of say
ing, "I've noticed that some
thing weird is on my skin, and
I'm doing something about it, so
let me stop itching for a little
while."
So now that you know what
happens when you're itching,
what causes the tingly feeling?
Well, as mentioned above, gentle
touch stimulation can cause an
itch. These stimulations and the
random firing of the itch recep
tors are probably responsible for

most of the itches we get.
Itching is also a manifesta
tion of allergic reaction. When
ever your body initiates an aller
gic response, it releases his
tamines. These chemicals cause
runny noses, rashes, etc. His
tamines can also trigger itchi
ness, which is why poison ivy
rashes itch, and why you get an
itchy nose from pollen allergies.
Insect bites are usually an aller
gic reaction to something in the
insect saliva.
Some serious diseases can
cause itching, so pruritis isn't
always a matter to be brushed off.
There are also many parasites
that cause pruritis; the most
common is scabies, caused by a
small mite that crawls around
under your skin and leaves feces
that makes you itch. These mites
can infest you from bed sheets,
animals, or other people.
One interesting itching phe
nomenon is 'pig handler's itch.'
A group of dermatologists found
that fifteen farmers who let
their pigs roam freely in the
house developed cases of severe
itching. The farmers had gotten
scabies from contact with their
pigs.
There are few known meth
ods to prevent itching. Anti-his
tamines try to block the cause of
the itching in allergies. It has
been shown that warmth
increases the itching sensation,
so cold showers are often recom
mended.
Of course, you could try the
preventative approach: don't let
pigs run around in the house.
