## Bears give spikers a run for the win Cal fires up, rallies to four 
### Seth Goldstein Staff writer 
Cardinal 15 16 10 15

When freshman Kristin Folkl
knocked down the first of her
career-high 21 kills to give Stan
ford a 1-0 lead over the California
Golden Bears last night in Maples
Pavilion, it appeared that the Car
dinal would win as easily as expect
ed. No one had given California (2-
8, 0-3 in the Pacific 10 Conference)
much of a chance against the No. 1
Cardinal (9-0, 3-0 Pac-10), includ
ing Stanford head coach Don
Shaw.
Everyone was wrong.
The Cardinal's eventual 3-1 (15-
11, 16-14, 10-15, 15-5) win for was
certainly not an easy victory. The
Bears came very close to taking
each of the first two games, and
pulled off the third to hand Stan
ford only its second lost game on
the season.
"1 have to apologize to Cal,"
Shaw said. "I underestimated
them and they taught me a valu
able lesson. I give them a lot of
credit."
After Stanford confirmed
expectations and took the first
point of the match, Cal jumped out
to a 5-2 lead. A concerned Shaw
called a timeout to help his team
regroup.
It did. The Cardinal came out,
got the serve back and went on a
11-0 run. Despite the momentum
building up against them, the
Bears rallied to close within two
points before the Cardinal nailed
down the last two points for the
game.
Cal drew upon their spirited
performance in game one to take a
4-0 leed in the second. They
stretched the margin to six at 12-6
and had game point at 14-11. As
junior Danielle Mashey went back
to serve for the Bears, Shaw used a
timeout. When the squad went
back out onto the court, Mashey
punched the ball into the net. Stan
ford regained the serve and pro
ceeded to dig, set and spike its way

to five points and the game.
Stanford's rally did not prove as
successful in the third. After a 3-3
deadlock, Cal scored the next nine
points to take a 12-3 lead. Stanford
made it competitive at 13-10, and
then denied the Bears four game
points before eventually falling.
The Cardinal dealt with Cali
fornia more effectively in the
fourth game, though the Bears still
would not be declawed. Junior set
ter Car}' Wendell, freshman setter
hitter Lisa Sharpley and Folkl led
Stanford to a 15-5 victory in a
game tighter than the score sug
gests.
The surprisingly strong Bears
were led by Mashy with team highs
14 kills and 18 digs. Classmates
Jenny Swart and Heidi Emmrich
also contributed to the effort.
Swart had 10 kills, while Emmrich
had nine to go with a .368 hitting
percentage.
For the Cardinal, Wendell and
Sharpley set new career-highs in
assists with 36 and 28, respective
ly. Wendell also hit .438 with eight
kills and 15 digs, while Sharpley hit
.571 with 12 kills and 10 digs.
Folkl, who broke her own team
season-high in kills, led the team
with 17 digs. As a whole, the team
hit .321 with new season-highs in
kills, assists and digs.
"Statistically, we looked pretty
good," Shaw said. "But I'm not real
happy with the way we played. 1
think we showed a lack of aggres
sion and a lack of communication
on the court. We were real lucky
that we have a lot of talent, or Cal
would have taken that match."
The Bears' performance
showed how seriously most of the
players take the rivalry.
"It's Stanford and Cal and they
always come out fired up," said
senior blocker Anne Wicks. "The
rivalry is a little different in volley
ball than in football because Cal
isn't traditionally one of the better
teams in the Pac-10, but it's still
important for us to beat them. It'fe
a pride thing."
Rivalry or not, the lesson left by
the match is one to be remem
bered.
"Some teams are underrated
and don't get the credit they
deserve," Folkl said. "I think Cal is
probably one of those teams."

happy with the way we played. 1
think we showed a lack of aggres
sion and a lack of communication
on the court. We were real lucky
that we have a lot of talent, or Cal
would have taken that match."
The Bears' performance
showed how seriously most of the
players take the rivalry.
"It's Stanford and Cal and they
always come out fired up," said
senior blocker Anne Wicks. "The
rivalry is a little different in volley
ball than in football because Cal
isn't traditionally one of the better
teams in the Pac-10, but it's still
important for us to beat them. It'fe
a pride thing."
Rivalry or not, the lesson left by
the match is one to be remem
bered.
"Some teams are underrated
and don't get the credit they
deserve," Folkl said. "I think Cal is
probably one of those teams."
