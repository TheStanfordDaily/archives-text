## Polo gets 2nd chance 
### Kyle Utsumi Staff writer 
When the Stanford men's water
polo team takes to the pool this
Thursday, it will mark the first
time the Cardinal will have to
rebound after a loss. After falling to
California 12-11 in overtime Satur
day, the Cardinal (6-1 overall) is
ready to get back on the winning
track.
In its quest to defend the NCAA
title it won last year, No. 1 Stanford
will face off against UC-Santa Bar
bara tomorrow and Long Beach
State Friday. Both games will start
at 3 p.m. at deGuerre Pool.
In UCSB, Stanford faces a veter
an team which returns nearly
everyone from their 1993 squad.
The No. 8 Gauchos did add a new
coach, former player Joe O'Brien.
O'Brien replaces longtime UCSB
coach Pete Snyder.
"UCSB is a pretty good team,"
said Stanford coach Dante Detta
manti. "We worked hard to beat
them last year and [earlier] this
year." Stanford defeated Santa Bar
bara 12-3 two weeks ago.
Friday's match-up will feature
Stanford against a traditionally
strong program which has seen a
couple of uncharacteristically lean
years. Ixmg Beach St. opened the
season at No. 10, but has since
slipped to No. 12.
"Ixmg Beach has been down for
a few years now," Dettamanti said.
"They have lots of new people. They
were at the point where they could
have been very competitive this
year, but they have lost four or five
players to injury."
The two matches should put
Stanford back in the win column
after falling to No. 3 Cal Saturday
at Berkeley. Junior Jeremy L&ster,
playing in his first game of the sea
son after representing the United
States at the World Championships
in Rome, scored five times for tbe
Cardinal against the Bears, yet was
not satisfied by the result.
"During the game, we just did
not piny well," leister said. "We
were getting used to playing togeth
er. We tried out a new defense, but
we just didn't execute."
Although Iwjth of this week's
opponents are ranked considerably
lower than Stanford, which
retained the top spot in the most
recent national coaches' poll, the
Cardinal will not overlook either
the (Jauchos or the 49ers.
"These games will be a good
warm up for the weekend," Detta
manti said, referring to the North
ern California Tournament which
will take place Saturday and Sun
day at deGuerre Pool and will fea
ture several of the top collegiate
teams in the nation. The Cardinal
will face both Santa Barbara and
Long Beach St. again in bracket
play Saturday.
"This week, it's not a matter of
who our opponent is," Laster said.
"We just need to work hard for our
selves, play well and execute."
