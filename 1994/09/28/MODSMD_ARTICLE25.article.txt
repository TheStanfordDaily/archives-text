When the Stanford men's water
polo team takes to the pool this
Thursday, it will mark the first
time the Cardinal will have to
rebound after a loss. After falling to
California 12-11 in overtime Satur

players to injury."
The two matches should put

after falling to No. 3 Cal Saturday
at Berkeley. Junior Jeremy L&ster,
playing in his first game of the sea
