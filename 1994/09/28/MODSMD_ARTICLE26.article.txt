# Pricey players But they're worth it

It's too bad that the only
fall tribute to baseball this
year is some pathetic docu
mentary on PBS narrated by a
short, mousy, artsy-fartsy
pseudo-baseball fan.

This is the same guy who
eulogized the Civil War on
PBS last year; let's just hope
that his most recent project
isn't a premonitory symptom
of baseball's seemingly emi
nent death.
But before we go wishing
upon that fallen star, I want
Barry Bonds, Mike Piazza,
Ken Griffey Jr. and Tommy
Glavine to know this. Bud
Selig, Don Fehr and all the
other corporate- goons should
also listen up.
If this strike drives that
final wooden stake into the
corporate, blood-sucking
heart of Baseball Inc., so be it.
I think it's for the best.
Now don't get me wrong
here. I am definitely not anti
baseball, I am just opposed to
the entire situation baseball is
presently mired in. In fact, my
team, the Los Angeles
Dodgers, were in first place
and primed to make their first
pennant run since 1988 when
the season was unceremoni
ously shot in the leg.
For all you Bay Area fanat
ics, I was actually rooting for
Matt Williams to break Roger
