# Pricey players But they're worth it
## 
### 
It's too bad that the only
fall tribute to baseball this
year is some pathetic docu
mentary on PBS narrated by a
short, mousy, artsy-fartsy
pseudo-baseball fan.

This is the same guy who
eulogized the Civil War on
PBS last year; let's just hope
that his most recent project
isn't a premonitory symptom
of baseball's seemingly emi
nent death.
But before we go wishing
upon that fallen star, I want
Barry Bonds, Mike Piazza,
Ken Griffey Jr. and Tommy
Glavine to know this. Bud
Selig, Don Fehr and all the
other corporate- goons should
also listen up.
If this strike drives that
final wooden stake into the
corporate, blood-sucking
heart of Baseball Inc., so be it.
I think it's for the best.
Now don't get me wrong
here. I am definitely not anti
baseball, I am just opposed to
the entire situation baseball is
presently mired in. In fact, my
team, the Los Angeles
Dodgers, were in first place
and primed to make their first
pennant run since 1988 when
the season was unceremoni
ously shot in the leg.
For all you Bay Area fanat
ics, I was actually rooting for
Matt Williams to break Roger


Kathryn
Yang
Maris' record of HI dingers in a season.
Williams lukl 43 at List count, and so
did Griffey in the American League.
And then there was Frank
Thomas of the ChiSox who was
about to show us how a Triple Crown
was to be won. The man was batting
.353 with .'JB homers and 101 RBIs in
August!
And yet, despite all that I still say
haseball am be sacrificed ... to pre
served the integrity of the labor
union and the laborers. There are
very few lalxir situations in which
the merits so clearly rest with one
side as they do here.
The owners want a salary cap, eh?
Well, when we get through capping
the baseball players, why don't we
start on the lawyers — they really
made way too much money for their
little pencil-pushing jobs. Then those
Jaguar-driving societal leeches we
call doctors.
Why stop there? I hate my
plumber, the m;ui has the audacity
to charge me $250 for unclogging a
goddamned drain! I say, all techni
cians are overpaid. Cap them too.
Executive secretaries make $15 an
hour? For typing and filing? What
kind of skill is that? Then there are
the restaurants that charge $25 a
plate, the accountants, the actors,
the carpenters, the scientists, the
journalists, etc.
And when we're done capping the
working class and when the laborers
finish turning on themselves, the
economic royalists can laugh ;ill the
way to the bank.
The fact is that in t he sports world,
to be even a good baseball player,

much less a great one, may be a gift,
but it is a gift few individuals possess
— so few, in fact, that the scarcity has
driven up the price of each player
(almost the same scenario with tech
nicians mid other skilled workers).
To stop the upward spiral, the
owners want to impose a salary cap
— another name for a spending cap.
Under a cap, the players would agree
to limit their salaries and thus save
the owners from the folly of paying
those salaries. The players, under
standably, are refusing to do so.
At this point in the argument,
public relations goons come armed
with an anecdote: the .250 hitter who
earns $2 million a year. The impor
tant tiling for the owners is creating
vivid economic images, images with
shock value.
Baseball players have such high
visibility, they're especially suscepti
ble to this shenanigan. By the same
token, it is difficult to get inflamed
over the excesses of an owner,
because the owners mid their excess
es tire both indistinct.
Americans dream of being mil
lionaires like the baseball players,
but hundreds of millions, corporate
tax breaks, collusion ... it becomes
harder to comprehend the owners'
excesses. We cannot possibly
Ix-'grudge what we cannot even begin
to fathom.
Truth of the matter is baseball
isn't the only American tradition the
players are trying to save. Their bat
tle against the owners is almost as
old as the nation itself.
I'm rooting for Williams, Griffey,
Thomas and the others to go all the
way this season.

Kathryn, while probably not head
ed towards leechdom, is pondering
her future as a pencil-pusher.
