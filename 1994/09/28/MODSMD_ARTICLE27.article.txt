# Soccer looks for win despite injury plague
## 
### Jeremy Stone Staff writer 
Bruised but not beaten, the Stanford women's soc
cer team will search for its seventh consecutive win
tomorrow at Maloney field against Sacramento
State.
The fourth-ranked Cardinal is coming off a tough
1-0 win in its Pacific 10 Conference opener against
California in which the already injury-plagued team
lost yet another player. Freshman midfielder Rita
Hermiz was the latest to fall and will be sidelined
indefinitely.
Hermiz's absence leaves yet another hole in the
middle for Stanford, a position with the fewest veter
ans to begin with. Junior Carmel Murphy, called "one
of the most dangerous playmakers in the country" by
head coach lan Sawyers, suffered a broken nose over
a week ago during practice.
Senior Anna Patitucci, the team's premier defend
er in the midfield, has a torn anterior cruciate liga
ment which will likely sideline her for the season.
Alyze Lowen, who saw extensive action as a freshman
last year, underwent arthroscopic knee surgery and is
finished for 1994. Freshman Elie Foster sprained an
ankle in the Cardinal's 3-1 victory over Pacific last
Friday but will return shortly.
Sawyers attributes the injuries not to improper
conditioning, but simply bad luck.
"We've had a lot of freak injuries," said the coach.
"Most happened during warm-ups or practice."
The midfield casualties have led to unexpected
playing time for reserves and have caused some
players to switch from their customary positions.
Sophomore Danielle Hamacher and junior Dena
Dey, both forwards by trade, have especially shined
in their new roles. Hamacher scored two goals
against Pacific and Dey, who returns to the starting
line-up after injuries last year, has two goals on the
season.
As evidenced by her performance, Hamacher is not
fazed by the change of position.
"I'm happy just to get the chance to start," said
Hamacher, who appeared in only three games as a
freshman.
Fortunately, the Cardinal backfield (which has
allowed only 29 shots in six games) has remained
healthy with only a few exceptions. Sophomore Suzie
Boots, who started all but two games in 1993, has
mononucleosis, and senior Laura Wilkes has yet
another torn ACL. Sophomore Wendy Latimer, nor
mally a midfielder, has filled in for the defense, along
with junior forward Vicky Haring.
Senior Jennifer Poehler will remain in goal until
senior Leslie Garrard returns from a shoulder injury.
Poehler has allowed only three goals in 1994.

Junior forward Dena Dey keeps the action on the Cal side of the field during last Sunday's match. The Cardinal expects
to show similar control this weekend.
The forwards have remained
unaffected by the injury plague.
Although Haring has gone to the
backfield for the time being, sopho
more stand-bys Emily Burt and Erin
Martin have shouldered the scoring
load with nine goals between them.

Those nine scores are two shy
of the Hornets' mark as a team
through six games. Sacramento
State enters with a record of 3-3
after an extended vacation. CSUS
won its last outing at home vs.
(ionzaga on September IK.
Although not a soccer power
house, the Hornets have
remained fairly healthy so far
this season, not to go overlooked.
Freshman Paula (Juarda and

junior Tisha Smith pace the Hor
nets' scoring attack with three
goals apiece. Junior Katy Doyle
and senior Jeanette Plumley are
the mainstays in the midfield
with two goals each.
Sherie Brands and Gena Hern
don, both juniors, anchor a sus
pect defense that has yielded 113
shots on goal so far in 1994. Senior
goalkeeper Dawne Bailey has
allowed two goals a game this year,

including four each in losses to
San Francisco and UC-Davis. She
has yet to shut out an opponent.
After tomorrow's 4 p.m. game
comes a welcome sight for the
Cardinal time off to heal. With
the exception of Sunday's alumni
game, Stanford will have six days
to prepare for Bay Area rival St.
Mary's before wrapping up a six
game home stand Oct. 9 against
San Diego.
