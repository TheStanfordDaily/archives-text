Spending two weeks on an
island off the coast of Croatia,
three Stanford students worked
for two weeks thus summer at a
"camp"for Bosnian children who
had lost one or both parents dur
ing the war.
Sophomore Tin Gazivoda and
graduate students Mike Rothen
berg and Sheri Fink — all mem
bers of Students Against Genocide
— traveled to Badija, an island
south of Croatia to aid the Bosnian
children.
"We wanted to give [the chil
dren] some hope, memories to get
them through some tough times,"
Rothenberg said.
Gazivoda, Rothenberg and Fink
stayed on the island for two weeks
and interacted with the children
through games, sports and art.
"The kids swam four or five
hours a day," Rothenberg said.
"Sheri did arts and crafts with
them. We played soccer, volleyball,
and I showed them baseball.
"They .. . had a lot of fun. We
wanted to let them know that peo
ple care about them," Fink added.
Fink was impressed with the
courage and strong-heart edness of
the volunteers, she said. "There
was one woman . . . who lived on
the front line for so long but
refused to become angry because

that would make her just like [the
Serbs]," she explained.
The Bosnian children num
bered around 100 and were pri
marily from four refugee camps in
Bosnia and Croatia. According to
Rothenberg, almost all the chil
dren had at least one parent killed
in the war and that some even saw
their parents shot by snipers.
Unlike American kids, the
Bosnian children were generally
compliant, Fink said. "They did
not complain about the food or
anything. . . . They were just nor
mal kids," she said.
She was saddened to hear how
the children lived in the camps, she
added.
The program was sponsored by
Global Children's Organization in
Hawaii, which sent American vol
unteers to Europe during three
different sessions. Gazivoda,
Rothenberg and Fink participated
during the second session in early
August.
Of the almost 30 volunteers at
the camp, half were Americans
and half were social workers from
Bosnia and Croatia.
After two weeks at summer
camp, the children were sent back
to their original refugee camps.
Gazivoda said that in the future,
SAGE hopes to help extend the
program to create a permanent
safe haven for the Bosnian chil
dren.
