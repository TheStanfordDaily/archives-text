# Mixed reviews for summer storage
## After two-year hiatus, students and administrators differ on success of system 
### September Treviño Staff writer 
As returning students scurried
about, transporting suitcases and
boxes alike to their new housing,
some had a smaller distance to lug
their heavy belongings — they
had stored their stuff on campus.
Last spring, after intense lob
bying by student government,
University administrators
restored on-campus summer stor
age — almost two years after they
discontinued the originally free
service. Previously, they had cited
budget constraints and fire codes
as reasons for discontinuing sum
mer storage.
After its first summer back,
students and administrators alike
have something to say about pay
per-box storage system. While
most seemed satisfied with the
storage service, a handful of stu
dents had reason to complain.
"From our perspective it was
pretty successful," said Keith
Guy, director of I lousing and Din
ing Services.
Junior Felice Lin said she was
satisfied even though she was
concerned about the possible theft
of her computer. "There's no
insurance [for items stored under
the new service] so I did have to
worry about it being stolen," she
said.
One student, however, came
back and found that some of her
belongings had been moved.
"In general, I was happy with it
(storage), but it was frustrating to
go to Wilbur and find that my
computer had been moved from
Wilbur to Stern," said sophomore
Alexandra Fastov. "I don't have a
car so I had to coordinate two sep
arate trips."
Fastov also expressed concern
over the University's "txld-sized"
objects option. "If it's a towel rack
it doesn't make financial sense,"
she said.
Junior Mike Noren also said he
had problems after storing his
futon in the basement of Twain
Hall.
"I had it mostly covered by a
plastic bag when I stored it,"he

said. "But when I came back, it
had been moved, it had a big rust
colored stain on it and it was wet."
Noren added that mold spots
had "manifested themselves in
two areas" of the soggy futon, and
had soaked through the cover to
the padding itself.
Although the University
assumed no liability for lost, dam
aged or stolen goods, Assoc. Dir. of
Housing and Dining Services
Rodger Whitney said precautions
were taken to secure the facilities
and avoid potential damage. He
also said he had received no
reports of problems.
Many students had positive
experiences, citing the convenient
location as a primary advantage of
on-campus storage.
"It's definitely useful," said
senior Samuel Smith. "I've stored
off campus and it doesn't work."
Students also said the price for
storing their belongings seemed
reasonable. "If they had major
competition I'd question the
price, but for the services they do
it's not bad," Smith added.
"I felt it was reasonable consid
ering I didn't have to drive to get
to it," Lin said.
According to Whitney, "the
feedback from staff and students
has really been positive. We went
into it with the idea that we were
going to make it work."
The University set up storage
facilities in Wilbur Hall, Stern
Hall, Lagunita Court and Lamda
Nu after making necessary
changes and improvements to cre
ate stable facilities which met fire
codes.
Students stored small boxes
for $5, large boxes for $10, com
puters for $15, and bikes and
other odd-sized objects for $20,
and the University assumed no
liability for damaged items.
The University accommodated
the student demand, Whitney
said, while securing enough
income to meet this year's finan
cial target for covering the costs of
the program over a period years.
"We think we have a service we
can afford, that works mid meets
students needs," he said.

year hiatus, some were dismayed to find their belongings had
been moved over the summer. Worse still, some students say a
