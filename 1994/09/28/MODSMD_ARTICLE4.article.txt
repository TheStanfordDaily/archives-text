# Stanford's singing 'Dervish'
## Aging robot wins national award 
### Diane Chen Staff writer 
Though many people would
consider Dervish an obsolete
machine, Stanford's entry to the
National Mobile Robot Contest
took it by storm — make that by
song.

The singing Stanford robot
named Dervish, programmed
with the latest innovations in ar
tificial intelligence, traveled in
the back of a station wagon to the
contest in Seattle and returned to
home with a first place award —
beatingoutentriesfrom universi
ties, computer industries and

robot companies internationally
known like Carnegie Mellon Uni
versity and Lockheed Missiles
and Space Division.
Although Dervish was one of
the oldest robots in the contest
— utilizing some of the least
computing power and cheapest
robot sensory systems — the ar
tificial intelligence encased in
Dervish outsmarted newer,
faster and more powerful robots
augmented with lasers and in
frared sensors.
Stanford computer science
graduate students Stan Birchfield
and Illah Nourbakhsh and recent
ly graduated master's student
Rob Powers spent five months
and more than 1,000 hours creat
ing the elaborate code that al
lowed Dervish to win the office de
livery event of the third annual
contest.
The 4-and-a-half-year-old
Nomad 100 robot — the only
working robot of its kind in the
world — was transformed into
Dervish as a final project for last
year's Introduction to Robot Pro
gramming class.
Nourbakhsh, a teaching assis
tant, recruited the best projects
for the national competition —
which was sponsored by the
American Association for Artifi
cial Intelligence.
Dervish — named after a
whirling Dervish tribe from Iran
and Turkey — repeated a tune
and talked his way through the
