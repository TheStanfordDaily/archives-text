# Stanford's singing 'Dervish'
## Aging robot wins national award 
### Diane Chen Staff writer 
Though many people would
consider Dervish an obsolete
machine, Stanford's entry to the
National Mobile Robot Contest
took it by storm — make that by
song.

The singing Stanford robot
named Dervish, programmed
with the latest innovations in ar
tificial intelligence, traveled in
the back of a station wagon to the
contest in Seattle and returned to
home with a first place award —
beatingoutentriesfrom universi
ties, computer industries and

robot companies internationally
known like Carnegie Mellon Uni
versity and Lockheed Missiles
and Space Division.
Although Dervish was one of
the oldest robots in the contest
— utilizing some of the least
computing power and cheapest
robot sensory systems — the ar
tificial intelligence encased in
Dervish outsmarted newer,
faster and more powerful robots
augmented with lasers and in
frared sensors.
Stanford computer science
graduate students Stan Birchfield
and Illah Nourbakhsh and recent
ly graduated master's student
Rob Powers spent five months
and more than 1,000 hours creat
ing the elaborate code that al
lowed Dervish to win the office de
livery event of the third annual
contest.
The 4-and-a-half-year-old
Nomad 100 robot — the only
working robot of its kind in the
world — was transformed into
Dervish as a final project for last
year's Introduction to Robot Pro
gramming class.
Nourbakhsh, a teaching assis
tant, recruited the best projects
for the national competition —
which was sponsored by the
American Association for Artifi
cial Intelligence.

whirling Dervish tribe from Iran
and Turkey — repeated a tune

competition, saying such things as
"I see a closed door on my right."
For the contest, robots were
provided with limited information
— such as which room was in
which hallway, but were not given
dimensions or distances.
But the day before the contest,
the Stanford students "noticed the
robot behaving awfully badly —
bumping into things," Nour
bakhsh said. After finding one of
the sonars broken, the team
replaced it with the only sonar
from the original Nomad 100 that
was not being used.
Dervish — equipped with func
tional sonars — was ready to go.
During the contest, Dervish
was slow but sure. Other robots
failed to avoid a blockade in a hall
way, and any competitors were
eliminated when they could not
find an alternate entrance after
encountering a closed door.
"Robotics has a long way to go
before it can bring you coffee and
tie your shoelaces," he said. "It's
hard to get robots to reason with
common sense."
Out of 11 entries, only Stan
ford's talking robot was able to
successfully maneuver through a
simulated office and reach the goal
room.
The success of the Stanford
entry derives from its unusually
positioned sonars — the most inex
pensive kind of robot sensor — and
elaborate algorithms programmed
into two laptop computers that cre
ated the "brain" of Dervish.
Sonar works when the robot
makes a sound and listens to the
echo. Objects reflect the sound and
these responses allow the comput
er to judge distances.
