A wood carving portraying "two elon
gated abstract faces and a female figure"
was stolen from the New Guinea Sculp
ture Project near Roble Hall over the
weekend, according to project director
Jim Mason.
The eight foot by one foot piece was
taken sometime between Friday and Sun
day nights and was the only piece in the
collection not chained down, he said.
Mason said he plans to report the theft
to Stanford Police, but he has already of

fered a $250 reward for the return of the
piece or for any information leading to its
return.
"These artists have given the Stanford
community a significant gift," he said. "I

ask for the community's help in
protecting the pieces."
New Guinean artist Gutok
Yantaka, who returned to his
home country earlier this month,
carved the piece.
The sculpture garden, which
has yet to be completed, features
about 30 carvings by 11 promi

nent carvers from two New
Guinean cultural groups. The
carvings are primarily done in
wood and stone, with additional
painted pieces. Located at the
corner of Santa Teresa Street and
Lomita Drive, the project will
eventually become a permanent
outdoor garden.
Sculpting for the project began
in May. The garden combines tra
ditional elements of New Guinean
art with the artists' impressions
of life in the United States
