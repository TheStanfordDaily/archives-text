# Stanford, EPA settle on fines
## University agrees to pay $2.65 million for improperly stored, handled waste 
### Scott Van Winkle Staff writer 
Admitting to some 640 viola
tions of state law over a six-year
period, University officials yester
day announced a $2.65 million
settlement of charges made by the
California Environmental Protec
tion Agency in 1992 concerning
improper handling of hazardous
waste on campus.
The cost of the settlement
stems mostly from increased over
sight required by state law, but
the remainder — nearly $1 million
— will be paid to the state. Part of
this money will be paid as a puni
tive measure, part will reimburse
the agency for its enforcement ex
penses and the rest will go to envi
ronmental groups throughout
California.
As part of the settlement — the
largest ever against an education
al institution in California — the
University has agreed to train
everyone who either handles or
generates hazardous waste in a
wide variety of specific procedures
required by law, in addition to
paying for costly analysis of unla
beled waste.
The additional oversight will
cost an average of $825,000 a year
over the next two years, according
to University estimates.
During those two years, Stan

ford will attempt to change the
practices — both on campus and
in state offices — which led to the
costly citations.
To begin with, the University
will no longer store hazardous
waste on campus for longer than
90 days — a legal procedure, but
one which attracted the attention
of Santa Clara County inspectors
and the state's Department of
Toxic Substances Control.
Also, CEPA has agreed to par
ticipate in discussions with vari
ous research institutions that

could result in
more lenient
standards for ap
plying state laws
to the laboratory
setting.
While the Uni
versity avoided a
lengthy lawsuit
and a correspond
ing accumulation

of fines by settling with the state,
some University officials are not
completely pleased with the con
tents of the agreement.
However, Larry Gibbs, director
of the University's Environmen
tal Health and Safety department,
did say that the University is
"pleased to have the settlement
behind |itl."

Serious or trivial?
The extent and seriousness of
the violations is hotly contested.
DTSC spokesman Allan Hirsch
said the agreement "reflects the
fact that there were some serious
problems at Stanford."
The University insists most of
the violations were trivial, arising
from the difficulties of applying
industrial standards to the labo
ratory setting.
"The labels (mandated by state
law) are clearly designed for 55-
gallon drums," as opposed to the
25,000 to 30,000 small vials han
dled each year by the University,
Gibbs said.
Hazardous waste can range
from ink or motor oil to experi
mental substances; proper han
dling of such waste requires
everything from accurate dating
of labels to non-leaking contain
ers.
Hirsch said extensive DTSC
inspections made roughly once a
year since 1988 revealed a broad
spectrum of violations. "There

were problems each time," he
said, including an "exceptional
number" of accidents and other
incidents in which hazardous
material may have been released
into the environment.
Although regulatory agencies
wrote over 1,600 citations during
the six-year period, including 39
for environmental releases, Stan
ford admits to only four incidents
and insists no damage was done
to the environment or its occu
pants.
"There have been no reported
incidents from anybody working
with hazardous waste . . . that
resulted in any kind of worker's
compensation claim" of injury or
illness, Gibbs said.
Most reports involved spills that
took place indoors and were
cleaned up immediately, he
added.
A unique case
Another source of contention
during the 14 months of negotia
tions was the University's claim that
it was being singled out for stricter
enforcement of California law.
The University was unique
among educational institutions,
acknowledged Hirsch, because it

was the only one in the state with
an on-site hazardous waste stor
age permit. The permit allowed
the University to store larger
amounts of hazardous waste for
longer periods of time at the Envi
ronmental Safety Facility on Oak
Road, he said.
That doesn't mean University
facilities were treated unfairly,
Hirsch said. "We treated them the
same as we would any industry
that has the same permit," he
said.
Therein lies the problem,
University officials say. They
now acknowledge that obtaining
the permit was a mistake. "The
amount of space we have allocat
ed is not adequate" to meet Cal
ifornia requirements, Gibbs
said.
But the officials say the state
has unrealistic interpretations of
the law, which applies to oil
refineries and biotechnology
firms alike.
A major problem is "under
ground regulation," said Univer
sity General Counsel Michael
Roster, a process through which
state agencies interpret laws
without receiving input from the
public.

Changes for the future
University administrators'
concerns about current regula
tions led them to push for reform
of the agency as part of the settle
ment.
Because of the agreement, "the
state is committed in various
ways to try to develop written reg
ulations . . . that can be applied
rationally to research institu
tions," Roster said.
The negotiations attracted the
attention of several concerned
private research firms, Roster
said, some of whom considered
leaving the state as a result of
such severe regulations.
As the University moves on, a
new training program will move
to the foreground of compliance
efforts.
A multi-media training pro
gram developed by Gibbs and the
Stanford Interactive Television
Network could soon be on-line to
instruct waste handlers in proper
procedure.
The program would probably
save money in the long run,
Gibbs said, by preventing the
University from hiring even more
training personnel. The staff of
the chemical waste division has

already tripled from four to 12
since 1988.
The program would provide doc
umentation of training for every

one that logs on to the system,
which could include both graduate
and undergraduate students
involved in research, Gibbs said.

the agency for its enforcement ex
penses and the rest will go to envi
ronmental groups throughout
California.
As part of the settlement — the
largest ever against an education
al institution in California — the
University has agreed to train
everyone who either handles or
generates hazardous waste in a
wide variety of specific procedures
required by law, in addition to
paying for costly analysis of unla
beled waste.
The additional oversight will
cost an average of $825,000 a year
over the next two years, according
to University estimates.
During those two years, Stan

ford will attempt to change the
practices — both on campus and
in state offices — which led to the
costly citations.
To begin with, the University
will no longer store hazardous
waste on campus for longer than
90 days — a legal procedure, but
one which attracted the attention
of Santa Clara County inspectors
and the state's Department of
Toxic Substances Control.
Also, CEPA has agreed to par
ticipate in discussions with vari
ous research institutions that

could result in
more lenient
standards for ap
plying state laws
to the laboratory
setting.
While the Uni
versity avoided a
lengthy lawsuit
and a correspond
ing accumulation

of fines by settling with the state,
some University officials are not
completely pleased with the con
tents of the agreement.
However, Larry Gibbs, director
of the University's Environmen
tal Health and Safety department,
did say that the University is
"pleased to have the settlement
behind |itl."

Serious or trivial?
The extent and seriousness of
the violations is hotly contested.
DTSC spokesman Allan Hirsch
said the agreement "reflects the
fact that there were some serious
problems at Stanford."
The University insists most of
the violations were trivial, arising
from the difficulties of applying
industrial standards to the labo
ratory setting.
"The labels (mandated by state
law) are clearly designed for 55-
gallon drums," as opposed to the
25,000 to 30,000 small vials han
dled each year by the University,
Gibbs said.
Hazardous waste can range
from ink or motor oil to experi
mental substances; proper han
dling of such waste requires
everything from accurate dating
of labels to non-leaking contain
ers.
Hirsch said extensive DTSC
inspections made roughly once a
year since 1988 revealed a broad
spectrum of violations. "There

were problems each time," he
said, including an "exceptional
number" of accidents and other
incidents in which hazardous
material may have been released
into the environment.
Although regulatory agencies
wrote over 1,600 citations during
the six-year period, including 39
for environmental releases, Stan
ford admits to only four incidents
and insists no damage was done
to the environment or its occu
pants.
"There have been no reported
incidents from anybody working
with hazardous waste . . . that
resulted in any kind of worker's
compensation claim" of injury or
illness, Gibbs said.
Most reports involved spills that
took place indoors and were
cleaned up immediately, he
added.
A unique case
Another source of contention
during the 14 months of negotia
tions was the University's claim that
it was being singled out for stricter
enforcement of California law.
The University was unique
among educational institutions,
acknowledged Hirsch, because it

was the only one in the state with
an on-site hazardous waste stor
age permit. The permit allowed
the University to store larger
amounts of hazardous waste for
longer periods of time at the Envi
ronmental Safety Facility on Oak
Road, he said.
That doesn't mean University
facilities were treated unfairly,
Hirsch said. "We treated them the
same as we would any industry
that has the same permit," he
said.
Therein lies the problem,
University officials say. They
now acknowledge that obtaining
the permit was a mistake. "The
amount of space we have allocat
ed is not adequate" to meet Cal
ifornia requirements, Gibbs
said.
But the officials say the state
has unrealistic interpretations of
the law, which applies to oil
refineries and biotechnology
firms alike.
A major problem is "under
ground regulation," said Univer
sity General Counsel Michael
Roster, a process through which
state agencies interpret laws
without receiving input from the
public.

Changes for the future
University administrators'
concerns about current regula
tions led them to push for reform
of the agency as part of the settle
ment.
Because of the agreement, "the
state is committed in various
ways to try to develop written reg
ulations . . . that can be applied
rationally to research institu
tions," Roster said.
The negotiations attracted the
attention of several concerned
private research firms, Roster
said, some of whom considered
leaving the state as a result of
such severe regulations.
As the University moves on, a
new training program will move
to the foreground of compliance
efforts.
A multi-media training pro
gram developed by Gibbs and the
Stanford Interactive Television
Network could soon be on-line to
instruct waste handlers in proper
procedure.
The program would probably
save money in the long run,
Gibbs said, by preventing the
University from hiring even more
training personnel. The staff of
the chemical waste division has

already tripled from four to 12
since 1988.
The program would provide doc
umentation of training for every

one that logs on to the system,
which could include both graduate
and undergraduate students
involved in research, Gibbs said.

Admitting to some 640 viola
tions of state law over a six-year
period, University officials yester
day announced a $2.65 million
settlement of charges made by the
California Environmental Protec
tion Agency in 1992 concerning
improper handling of hazardous
waste on campus.
The cost of the settlement
stems mostly from increased over
sight required by state law, but
the remainder — nearly $1 million
— will be paid to the state. Part of
this money will be paid as a puni
tive measure, part will reimburse
the agency for its enforcement ex
penses and the rest will go to envi
ronmental groups throughout
California.
