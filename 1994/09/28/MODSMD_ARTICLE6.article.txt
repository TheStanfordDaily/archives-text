# Stanford, EPA settle on fines
## University agrees to pay $2.65 million for improperly stored, handled waste 
### Scott Van Winkle Staff writer 
Admitting to some 640 viola
tions of state law over a six-year
period, University officials yester
day announced a $2.65 million
settlement of charges made by the
California Environmental Protec
tion Agency in 1992 concerning
improper handling of hazardous
waste on campus.
The cost of the settlement
stems mostly from increased over
sight required by state law, but
the remainder — nearly $1 million
— will be paid to the state. Part of
this money will be paid as a puni
tive measure, part will reimburse
the agency for its enforcement ex
penses and the rest will go to envi
ronmental groups throughout
California.
As part of the settlement — the
largest ever against an education
al institution in California — the
University has agreed to train
everyone who either handles or
generates hazardous waste in a
wide variety of specific procedures
required by law, in addition to
paying for costly analysis of unla
beled waste.
The additional oversight will
cost an average of $825,000 a year
over the next two years, according
to University estimates.
During those two years, Stan

ford will attempt to change the
practices — both on campus and
in state offices — which led to the
costly citations.
To begin with, the University
will no longer store hazardous
waste on campus for longer than
90 days — a legal procedure, but
one which attracted the attention
of Santa Clara County inspectors
and the state's Department of
Toxic Substances Control.
Also, CEPA has agreed to par
ticipate in discussions with vari
ous research institutions that

could result in
more lenient
standards for ap
plying state laws
to the laboratory
setting.
While the Uni
versity avoided a
lengthy lawsuit
and a correspond
ing accumulation

of fines by settling with the state,
some University officials are not
completely pleased with the con
tents of the agreement.
However, Larry Gibbs, director
of the University's Environmen
tal Health and Safety department,
did say that the University is
"pleased to have the settlement
behind |itl."
