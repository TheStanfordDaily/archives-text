# CUE ready to give final report
## Recommendations could take up to two years to adopt 
### Sarah Katz Editorial staff 
After a summer spent condensing
its findings, the Commission on Un
dergraduate Education will present
its final report to the Faculty Senate
Oct. 13.
Although the report has only just
been written, most of the commis
sion's recommendations have been
well-known for a while, said History
Prof. James Sheehan, the commis
sion's chair.

"It's just what we knew. There are no surprises, I
hope," he said.
The presentation will be the culmination ofayear
long process in which the commission, formed by
University President Gerhard Casper, examined
every facet of undergraduate life at Stanford, from

distribution requirements to the role of technology in
the classroom.
Though the report will be debated in its entirety at
the senate meeting, the senate will not vote on the
study as a whole, Sheehan said.
After the initial presentation, the report will be
broken up and sent to various senate committees or
administrative depart ments — such as the Office of
the President — for furt her study or action, he added.
Some of the provisions, therefore, could take up to
two years to adopt, said Biology Prof. Robert Simoni,
the senate chair.
"Distribution requirements strike me as poten
tially complicated, while something like a new science
course is . . . relatively simple," he said.
Simoni added that there is also a question of re
source allocation. "The faculty doesn't control re
sources," he said. "One would hope that discussions

proceed in a way that resources
and faculty desires come along in
parallel."
Although the report repre
sents the "collective voice of the
commission," Sheehan said he
expects some debate and dissen
sion when it is finally presented.
"I assume it will not be adopted

by acclamation," he said. "It will
undoubtedly meet with some dis
sent. That's good — we wouldn't
want it otherwise. I hope it is the
subject of fruitful debate."
Like Simoni, Sheehan said he
felt distribution requirements
will be the most contentious
point in senate debate.
"It's a very interesting subject
that comes from the heart of the
enterprise," he said. "It invari
ably will invoke a variety of opin
ions."
