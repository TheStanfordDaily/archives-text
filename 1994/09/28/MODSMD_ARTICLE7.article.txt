well-known for a while, said History

the senate meeting, the senate will not vote on the
study as a whole, Sheehan said.

broken up and sent to various senate committees or
administrative depart ments — such as the Office of
the President — for furt her study or action, he added.

course is . . . relatively simple," he said.
Simoni added that there is also a question of re
source allocation. "The faculty doesn't control re
sources," he said. "One would hope that discussions
