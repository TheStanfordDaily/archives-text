# Diabetes walk strides to Stanford

Organizers of "Walktoberfest" are hoping that
Stanford's beautiful scenery will bring out more than
900 walkers to raise money Sunday for the American
Diabetes Association.
Rebecca Hickman, the event's chair at Stanford,
said 890 people had already registered to walk the
event's 10-kilometer route around campus. Hickman
expects Walktoberfest to raise about $60,000 for dia
betes research and education, she said.
"I think the wonderful turnout at the Stanford site
has to do with its location and beauty," she said. "I
think people enjoy the places of interest on campus
rather than walking through city streets."
Stanford was chosen as a site for a number of rea

sons, said Stephanie McKown, communications di
rector of the American Diabetes Association. The I)i
abetes Association gives approximately $270,000 an
nually to diabetes research at the School of Medicine,
she said.
The Stanford location will host the largest number
of participants of the five California sites chosen for
the organization's fourth annual Walktoberfest,
Hickman said.
"I think that it's safe to say that at least 80 percent
of money raised will go to research and education, and
20 percent to administration and organization of the
event," she added.
Hickman said the faculty and student response to
the event has been tremendous. The Stanford Volun-
teer Network helped coordinate
student group participation in the
walk-a-thon.
"One of the goals for the walk-a
thon was to get one or two repre
sentatives from every Stanford
student group to participate in the
walk," said Kris Ledesma, chair of
the network.
Ledesma and other volunteer
network members recruited stu
dents for the Walktoberfest at the
activities fair in White Plaza yes
terday.
Campus support came largely

from faculty and alumni, since
most organizing took place before
students arrived on campus, Hick
man said. The Stanford women's
faculty club was a large organizer
on campus, she added.
"We used electronic mail a lot to
recruit faculty and students on
campus," Hickman said.
The American Diabetes Associ
ation reports that an estimated 2.8
million Californians and 140,000
Santa Clara County residents have
diabetes.
The route begins and ends at
Nordstrom in the Stanford Shop
ping Center, and also passes
through the Rodin Sculpture (Jar
dens, the Quad and around Lake
Lagunita.
