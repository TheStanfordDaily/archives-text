The Federal Work-Study Funds for Community
Service Program will allow students who qualify to
be paid for working in non-profit community
agencies. Participants may be involved in direct
service, planning or community-sponsored
research activities. If you have work as part of your
financial aid package you may be eligible.
Funding will be allocated on a first-come, first
serve basis.
For more information, stop by the Haas Center for
Public Service Clearinghouse, across from the Bike
Shop.
