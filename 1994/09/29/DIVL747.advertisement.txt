THE CASE OF
LITTLE SWIFTY.

/■ I had )ust polished oil a crumbcake
doughnut and a steamin cup of
Joe when the phone rang.
A woman's voice
spoke, "Is this Nick
Canon, Print Detective? I
answered in the affirmative.
She told me she had a
lot on her mind and even
more on her desktop. A
phone, a computer, a key
board, a monitor, a mouse pad,
a scanner, and a personal printer
that in her words, "was as big and
slow as a dinosaur.'
"Not good',' I said. Then she got

lit upas we walked over to the BJ-200e.
"Its so sleek, so compact", she
whispered. I hit the print sample but

continued to whisper, "It's so fast,
and the output so crisp and
clean." I didn't want to name

From the tone of her voice, I could
tell she was running out of room and
running out of patience. So I asked,
You know Little Swifty' (A.K.A Ihe
Canon' BJ-200e) ?" She laughed, and said,
"Maybe if you hum a few bars.''
I like a lady with a sense
of humor, so I told her I'd meet
her at her favorite computer
store in 20 minutes. I arrived,
and immediately spotted her
in the printer section. She
looked the part. Successful.
Business-like. Except her eyes
were a little glazed.
"There are hundreds of
printers in the naked city,

was the price, and before she could even
ask I told her, "It's a steal."
Yep. She was happy all right. Come
to think of it, so was I. As we parted 1
wrote down a number she could call if
she had more questions, 1-800-848-4123.
And then, I looked in her big beautiful
eyes and told her what I tell everyone,
"Before you buy a printer, investigate."
