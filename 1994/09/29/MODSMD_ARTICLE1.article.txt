# 'More instances of violence, more instances of support'
## Gay history exhibit focuses on Stanford 
### Karen Heywood Staff writer 
In a flrst-of-its-kind exhibit
at Green Library, historian Ger
ard Koskovich's "Coming to
Terms: From Passionate
Friendships to Gay Liberation
at Stanford" highlights social
changes in student life at Stan
ford from 1891 to 1974.
Koskovich, who received his
master's degree from Stanford
in Art History in the early
1980s, curated the show in
hopes that it would "trace what
are some big changes in student
life at Stanford that explain the
visibility and organization of the
[lesbian, gay and bisexual 1 com
munity at Stanford," he said.
The exhibit, on display in the
Green lobby through October
12, focuses on a time period that
"people really don't know about

at all," said Koskovich, adding
that until now, virtually no one
has known much about gay and
lesbian Stanford-specific histo
ry-
Drawing primarily from Uni
versity archives, "Coming to
Terms" investigates aspects of
Stanford life which are repre
sentative of gay and lesbian his
tory in general, and those which
are distinctive to the campus,
Koskovich said.
The presentation is broken
down into four parts — pre-
World War I, World War I to
World War 11, the 1950s and
19605, and 1965 to 1974 — as
they pertain to life at Stanford.
Within these time periods,
Koskovich looks at the "conven
tions of affection and physical
interaction and friendship of

He uses the exhibit to examine
a number of "evolutions" in gay
and lesbian history at Stanford.
On a broad level, he studies the
"change in social construction of
gender roles" in the last decade,
but he also traces the birth and
growth of the gay and lesbian
presence on campus — from the
Stanford Gay Students Union
founded in 1970 to the currently
thriving Lesbian, Gay and Bisexu
al Community Center.

"Coming to Terms" is timed to
commemorate the 25th anniver
sary of the riots against a police
raid at the Stonewall Inn, a gay
bar in New York City, said David
Sullivan of the Department of
Special Collections.
Koskovich is scheduled give a
talk in conjunction with his exhib
it at 4:15 p.m. Oct. 10 in the
Cypress Room at Tresidder
Union. The lecture will be spon
sored by the Stanford Historical
Society.
