## Top Mexican official killed 
### 
MEXICO CITY (AP) - A young
man assassinated a key official of
Mexico's ruling party yesterday,
rocking a country already buffeted
by a turbulent year of violence and
rebellion.
Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu,
secretary-general of the Institu
tional Revolutionary Party (PRI),
was shot in the neck afler getting
into his car following a breakfast
at party headquarters. Shattered
glass from the passenger side win
dow was strewn on a side street off
the busy Paseo de la Reforma
boulevard.
A bank guard tackled the gun
man and turned him over to police.
Officials 'dentified him as an Aca
pulco resident, but did not give a
motive for what President Carlos
Salinas de Gortari described as "a
hideous crime."
"This is a day of mourning for
PRlistas. This is a day of mourning
for all Mexicans," said President
elect Ernesto Zedillo.
The killing shocked officials still
recovering from the March 23
assassination of PRI presidential

candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio,
shot at a Tijuana campaign rally.
Zedillo, his successor, won the Aug.
21 presidential election and takes
power Dec. 1.
Both Zedillo and Salinas were at
the Hospital Espanol where Ruiz
Massieu, his shirt ripped open and
soaked with blood, was rushed afler
the shooting. Doctors said Ruiz
Massieu had no pulse on arrival
and was pronounced dead at 10:30
a.m., an hour after the shooting.
Mexico also was shaken this
year by a New Year's uprising by
Mayan Indians in southern Mexico,
a wave of kidnappings of business
men and narcotics-related violence.
Despite the turbulence, the PRI,
which has governed Mexico since
1929, was able to gain 50 percent of
the vote in the national election.
Widely feared post-electoral vio
lence failed to materialize.
The assassination of Ruiz
Massieu, No. 2 in the ruling party,
jolted Mexico again just as the coun
try appeared to be settling down.
Deputy Attorney General Mario
Ruiz Massieu, the slain man's

brother, announced the death. He is
in charge of prosecuting drug traf
fickers for the federal attorney gen
eral's office, which has the suspect
ed gunman in custody.
Drug traffickers are accused of
murdering Roman Catholic Cardi
nal Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo
in a case of mistaken identity at
the Guadalajara airport in May
1993.
Ruiz Massieu, a 48-year-old
lawyer, was a rising figure in Mexi
can politics. He was elected to
congress in August and was selected
to lead the PRI delegation that
would dominate the lower house.
He was governor of the impover
ished western state of Guerrero,
where Acapulco is located, from
1987 to 1993 and was named PRI
secretary-general in May as the
party reorganized itself in the wake
of Colosio's murder.
Ruiz Massieu also represented
the PRI before the Federal Elec
toral Institute, which is in the midst
of reviewing challenges to the
August election and certifying the
results.
