on mil im n investment in Russia,

ation and joint efforts to combat
crime. In all, deals were signed for up
to $1 billion in ventures in Russia.
However, the most important
accord concerned nuclear arms.
The United States and Russia
agreed to speed up nuclear cutbacks
under the START II agreement
once it is ratified by both countries.
Clinton said the move would shave
several years from the timetable;
Yeltsin said perhaps seven years or
more.
"We will make the world safer
for all of us," Clinton said.
The treaty, reached last year,
calls for reducing long-range nucle
ar warheads to 3,000-3,500 on each
side by 2003.
There are doubts in Moscow that
the Russian parliament would rati
fy START II because of the expense
of dismantling missiles and the mil

itary's attachment to some of the
weapons. Yet, American officials
said they were confident of ratifica
tion.
The U.S. Senate has not
approved the treaty either.
The war in Bosnia regained a
point of dispute, with Yeltsin saying
Russia firmly opposes lifting an
arms embargo on the Muslim-led
Bosnian government, as Clinton
proposes. However, both sides got
some breathing room since the
Muslims suggested a six-month
delay on any action.
Yeltsin, asked if Russia would
exercise its veto in the U.N. Gener
al Assembly to keep the embargo
intact, said, "In six months we'll
take a look and see."
"We still have a potential differ
ence on that issue," Clinton said.
"There's no doubt about it."
