Haiti mission authorized
WASHINGTON (AP) — A House panel voted
yesterday to authorize a six-month mission for U.S.
troops in Haiti, bypassing objections from Republi
cans who said that was too long and complaints
from the administration about any deadline at all.
The House Foreign Affairs Committee, by a
party-line 27-18 count, said the U.S. military should
be authorized to remain in Haiti until March 1 —
with its role limited to protecting U.S. citizens, sta
bilizing security and helping provide humanitarian
relief.
In the Senate, Sen. Hank Brown, R-Colo.,
pushed for an earlier withdrawal deadline — Dec.
31 — in a non-binding amendment he offered to a
District of Columbia spending bill. There was no
immediate vote on Brown's amendment.
The congressional efforts to set a departure date
are part of an ongoing dispute with the White House
over who has ultimate authority over U.S. troops

abroad and anger that President Clinton refused to
seek the approval of Congress before committing
troops to Haiti.
UN program halted
KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) — The United Nations
called off its program to return thousands of
refugees to their homes in Rwanda yesterday, as
U.N. investigators began looking into allegations of
revenge killings by the new government's army.
Officials said they would also investigate how
much the United Nations' own refugee agency
helped create a new climate of fear in Rwanda.
The United Nations suspended convoys that
were to have taken up to 4,000 refugees a day, most
ly Hutus, from camps in southwest Rwanda back to
their homes in other parts of the country. Officials
said there were not enough people willing to go in
the convoys.
