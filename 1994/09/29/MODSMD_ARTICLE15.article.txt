Kudos to university
Registrar Roger Printup for
taking long-awaited steps
toward revamping Stanford's archa
ic identification system.
The Registrar's office has
announced that, by the beginning of
winter quarter, it will unveil a new
universal photo identification card to
be used by Stanford students, staff
and faculty.
The current policy is woefully lack
ing, as members of the Stanford com
munity have recognized for years.
Student IDs do not include photos
at present, rendering them easily
transferable and of little use beyond
the boundaries of the Stanford cam
pus. As many students have experi
enced when attempting to get stu
dent discounts at distant locations,
employees are often hesitant to
accept IDs which appear to be a prod
uct of medieval Europe.
The multi-purpose IDs will have a

variety of uses, so students will no
longer be forced to carry separate ID
and dinning cards. This change will
make life easier for everyone
involved.
Furthermore, the IDs will be used
for increasingly diverse purposes in
the future — ranging from purchas
es at Tresidder Express to transac
tions at Cowell Student Health Cen
ter — meaning that the whole sys
tem will ultimately be far more effi
cient and up to date.
The only difficulty which could
conceivably slow the arrival of the
new IDs is the magnitude of the pro
ject — it is estimated to affect
approximately 24,000 people on cam
pus — but Printup and his staff
should continue to make every effort
possible to avoid delay.
For many students, the Stanford
experience is a time to search for a
new identity. At present, it must also
be a time to search for a new ID.
