ASSU LEADERS, University
officials and U.S. Postal Ser
vice representatives have
taken an important step forward by
forming the Postal Advisory Board,
a new committee aimed at improv
ing service at the Stanford Post
Office.
Representatives from the U.S.
Postal Service deserve special praise
for their enthusiastic response to
the board's creation. Though it
would be easy for them to simply
shrug their shoulders and deny
their mistakes, the advisory board's
Postal Service representatives seem
eager to accept criticism and
respond with positive changes.
For years, the post office has
been a lightning rod of criticism
from students, faculty and staff,
who have complained of slow and
inadequate mail service. In the past,
attempts to improve postal service
have turned into bouts of finger

pointing. But finally, all the
involved parties have joined in a
concerted multilateral effort toward
a simple common goal — to improve
campus postal service.
According to committee member
Stephen Russell, the advisory
board's inquiries will delve deep
into the structure of the post office
— even questioning whether an on
campus post office is an appropriate
mail delivery system at Stanford.
Such a top-to-bottom study of the
post office is exactly what is needed.
One potential pitfall for the advi
sory board is that its work might
never expand beyond occasional
meetings and publicly issued plati
tudes. The committee members
must each make a special effort to
publicize the committee's progress
and solicit input from the outside.
The Postal Advisory Board's
efforts are long overdue. But it's
better late than never.
