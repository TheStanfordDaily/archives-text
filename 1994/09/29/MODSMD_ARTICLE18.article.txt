## Stephen Russell ASSU senator: Who carries the sword 
### 
I'VE BURNED MY
hand on the stove.
I've hopped fences
and swum streams.
And I've even twisted
my ankle jumping
from a swing set. I
tried again with an
umbrella over my head

as a parachute. That
didn't work. I've jumped from an air
plane, though, with a parachute for a
parachute. That worked.
Oh, well. They say what doesn't kill
you makes you stronger.
"They" say a lot of things, though I
am not too sure who "they" are. They
say anyone who doesn't walk on the
edge takes up too much room. Or at the
edge, it's a long way down, but an awful
ly pretty view. It wouldn't be so bad if
people weren't always getting pushed
off. Sometimes dangerous people crowd
the edge while a few wave their hands to
steady the mob. You probably know a
few people who live there.
Sometimes I wonder, though — how
did "they" get to be so wise? Probably
not by burning their hands on the stove
or hopping fences and swimming
streams. And it is almost certain that
they never jumped from a swing set
with an umbrella as a parachute. Maybe
they wrote a column in a newspaper.
More likely someone wrote about them.

Or maybe they just sat there on the
couch with a Grecian urn in one hand
and a candy bar in the other.
I think that George Bernard Shaw
might have a clue. He had a saying about
unreasonable folk — and progress. His
logic goes like this: reasonable people
conform to society, while the unreason
able make society conform to them.
Therefore, all true progress is made by
unreasonable people. 1 wonder if unrea
sonable people know this. I wonder if
unreasonable people ever burn their
hands on the stove. Do they carry pens
or torches? Salves or crowbars? They're
probably careful not to carry too much,
walking around on the edge.
I wish I knew a few more of them,
because sometimes they are hard to
spot. On some days, I'll walk through
White Plaza, down past the Clock
Tower and into the Quad. Sometimes
I'll hide a video camera under my coat. I
pay special attention to the people car
rying umbrellas. I watch the
rollerbladers on their pilgrimage over
rough tiles, cement and time capsules.
Rodin looks out on visiting children
holding hands, and workmen stretch
like Nietzsche's rope between buildings
damaged by the last earthquake. Some
times, I will see Gerhard Casper walk
ing out of Building 10. He walks past
the workers, the children and the
rollerbladers. When it rains, he carries

an umbrella.
I wonder if he is one of them. Great
leaders often are — some bad ones are,
too. Alexander the Great. Genghis
Khan. Caesar. Von Clausewitz. Grant.
Rommel. Patton. When they walked
the edge, I wonder if they looked in or
out, forward or down. Sometimes war
riors mistake themselves for politi
cians, and politicians mistake them
selves for warriors. It's worse when
someone who is neither mistakes him
self for both — or at least it's awfully
unreasonable. They say never send a
boy to do a man's job. Some of them
say that, anyway.
They like to tell stories, too. In one,
Zorba comes across an old man plantinf
a tree in the forest. The tree seemed si
very young and the man seemed so ver
old. Zorba asked why such an old mai
would plant such a young tree. He
would surely never live to see it grow.
"I live as though I will never die,"
replied the man.
"And I live as though I may die
tomorrow," responded Zorba. "Which
one of us is right?"
I don't know the answer to that ques
tion, but I do know who carried the
sword. Welcome to politics.
