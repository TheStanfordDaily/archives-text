# Koskovich: strain remains on Farm
## 
### Karen Heywood Staff writer 
For "Coming to Terms" cu
rator Gerard Koskovich, a
great deal can be learned from
the relationship between a so
ciety and its art.
So it should come as no
shock that Koskovich said he
feels the vandalism of George
Segal's Gay Liberation statue
may be an indicator of campus
tensions.
As a Stanford graduate and
an active surveyor of gay and
lesbian history, Koskovich said
although there is more acceptance
of homosexual lifestyles on cam
pus, strain still exists. He notes in
his exhibit that the gay and les
bian role throughout history has
not been clear-cut.
"We're in a period of time where
social changes have reconstructed
that role; there's not some system

atic progression," he said. "In
many ways there are more
instances of [anti-gay] violence, but
also more instances of support."
For instance, Koskovich point
ed out the irony of the University
preparing to unveil a exhib
it on gay history almost simulta
neously with the vandalism of the
statue last spring. These conflict
ing yet overlapping events "encap
sulate that dichotomy," he said.
David Sullivan of Green
Library Special Collections said,

"I don't know if [the timing of the
opening of "Coming to Terms"]
was a fortunate or unfortunate
coincidence."
The recent vandalism gives
homosexual issues visibility on
campus, Koskovich said. But he
feels the vandalism occurred long
enough ago to be "a historical and
critical remove" from some of the
feelings the event inspired.
Despite such recent anti-gay
sentiment, Koskovich said the on
campus movement has come a

long way.
"When I came to Stanford in
1979, no one could even tell me
when the gay student group was
founded," said Koskovich. Since
then the gay and lesbian move
ment has gathered more attention
from students as well as from the
University itself, he said. "Like
most academic institutions, there
remains a fair amount of debate
and contention about the appro
priate place and direction of this
kind of study."
