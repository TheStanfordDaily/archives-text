## 
### Allison Short Staff writer 
The judge deciding the lawsuit against the
University's speech code has postponed action on
the case, requesting more information from both
sides before he can reach a final decision.
According to Iris Brest, Stanford's associate gen
eral counsel, Judge Peter G. Stone of Santa Clara
County Superior Court "issued an order on Sept. 7
saying that he would like further briefing on the
application of the Leonard Law to Stanford."
The Leonard Law is a 1992 California statute
which extends free speech protection to students
at private universities. Last May, nine Stanford
students filed a lawsuit against the University
asserting that the 1990 Grey Interpretation of
the University's Fundamental Standard violates
the law, as well as the U.S. Constitution.
Stone asked the parties to brief the court on
both the speech code's history and any federal
cases with similar statutes, said Frank Hinman, a

lawyer with McCutchen, Doyle, Brown and
Enersen — the firm representing the University.
Brest said she believes the case will probably
not be decided until December.
The judge will rule specifically on the speech
code's constitutionality, not on its content, Hin
man said.
"Both parties agreed there were no disputed
fact issues. The code is what it is — the only ques
tion is whether the code is constitutional or not,"
he said. The parties agreed to submit the ques
tion to Stone, who will rule on a motion for an
injuction that suspends the Grey Interpretation.
The University aims to file its brief by Oct. 31,
while the plaintiffs may not file their papers until
Dec. 5, said Hinman. He added that he did not
know how soon after that the case would be
decided.

spokesman for the plaintiffs, could not be reached
