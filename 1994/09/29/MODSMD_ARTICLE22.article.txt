## A
						new outlook Men to tangle with Rams, Zips 
### Joseph Hei Staff writer 
This weekend, Stanford
men's soccer will finally play on
its own turf, and it hopes the
homecoming will mark a turn
ing point in the season.
Over the last four weeks,
Stanford (1-1-6 overall) has
played four consecutive away
tournaments and garnered only
one win out of eight games.
Tomorrow against Rhode Island
and on Sunday against the Uni
versity of Akron, the Cardinal
will try to bolster its losing
record.
"We're looking to find new
ways to try to win a game," said
senior goalkeeper Jim Masetti.
Because of its recent troubles,
Stanford is focusing on its own
strategy' this weekend instead of

concentrating on matching up
specifically against the Rams
and the Zips. In particular, the
Cardinal is trying to recapture
its winning mentality.
"When you're in a rut like
this, you have to look towards
the positive," Masetti said. "We
have to play with confidence and
not give up mentally just
because the other team scores
the first goal."
Head coach Colin Lindores
also emphasized the importance
of concentrating on more than
just strategy this week.
"We're capable of [winning!,"
Lindores said. "The players just
have to recognize what's possi
ble and execute."
Tactically, Stanford will take
an introspective approach by

day's game against Santa Clara. The Cardinal team as a whole
must control the tempo if they are to prevail this weekend.
