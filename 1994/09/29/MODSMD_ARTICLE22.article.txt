## A 						new outlook Men to tangle with Rams, Zips 
### Joseph Hei Staff writer 
This weekend, Stanford
men's soccer will finally play on
its own turf, and it hopes the
homecoming will mark a turn
ing point in the season.
Over the last four weeks,
Stanford (1-1-6 overall) has
played four consecutive away
tournaments and garnered only
one win out of eight games.
Tomorrow against Rhode Island
and on Sunday against the Uni
versity of Akron, the Cardinal
will try to bolster its losing
record.
"We're looking to find new
ways to try to win a game," said
senior goalkeeper Jim Masetti.
Because of its recent troubles,
Stanford is focusing on its own
strategy' this weekend instead of

concentrating on matching up
specifically against the Rams
and the Zips. In particular, the
Cardinal is trying to recapture
its winning mentality.
"When you're in a rut like
this, you have to look towards
the positive," Masetti said. "We
have to play with confidence and
not give up mentally just
because the other team scores
the first goal."
Head coach Colin Lindores
also emphasized the importance
of concentrating on more than
just strategy this week.
"We're capable of [winning!,"
Lindores said. "The players just
have to recognize what's possi
ble and execute."
Tactically, Stanford will take
an introspective approach by

establishing its own game plan and
dictating the pace of the play.
In Stanford's last few games,
many of its East Coast opponents
have chosen to take a very direct
style, using big kicks to move the

ball out of the bacUielu. The Cardi
nal responded to these straightfor
ward attacks and did not stick to its
own indirect, passing game.
The Rams are likely to use direct
tactics as well, but this time the
team is working hard to assert itself
on the field regardless of the oppo
nent's tactics.
"We're trying to work the ball
out of the back a little more," Maset
ti said. "The last couple of games

have been situations where we're
adjusting to other teams' levels and
play."
Finally, the team must find a
way to cope with the rash of injuries
that have beset it this season. Of the
five players out for the season with
serious injuries, four were starters
and two were to play key roles in
Stanford's game plan. Junior Steve
Kirschbaum was to be a key passer
in the center, and senior Ryan

Collins was to be the primary
goalscorer.
Also, all of these players were
midfielders; Stanford must find a
way to reinforce this critical but ten
uous link in the middle between the
offense and defense.
With all of these injuries, Lin
dores has enough to worry about
even without looking at the oppo
nent.
"I'm more concerned with the

product I put out on the field than
the product we face," Lindores
said. "It's a case of shuffling people
to get the maximum talent on the
field and hope it's sufficient to off
set the competition. There's no
other way."
Last year, Stanford ended with
strong performances in the second
half of the season, winning six
games in a row after starting the
season poorly. The team will try to

spark a similar turnaround for the
season this weekend.
"Every team has injuries;
we're going to find out if we have
the players to step in and do the
job," Lindores said. "We're hop
ing [junior forward Carmen]
D'Onofrio will step up and show
playing leadership, but you never
know — it could be a freshman or
a goalkeeper. Hopefully, the
whole team will do it."
