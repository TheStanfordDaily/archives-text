# Shooting for No. 1
## Hockey to face Cal for Pac-10 lead 
### Ratha Harntha 
First place. Revenge. And a new outlook.
That's what the Cardinal field hockey team (2-5
overall, 1-1 in the Northern Pacific League) will be look
ing for when they meet with the California Golden
Bears on Saturday and UC-Davis on Sunday.
"We are really fired up to play Cal," said freshman
goalie Kelly Naylor. "This is a critical game for us. Cal
will be really surprised [with Stanford's improved
play]."
The first-place Bears beat the Cardinal 3-0, on Sept.
16, while Davis has only played one game in its first
ever field hockey season. The winner of the California
game captures the lead in the NorPac Conference.
The Cardinal is definitely a different team from the
one that met the Bears 12 days ago, according te head
coach Sheiyl Johnson.
"Our team confidence is higher and we have gotten
better each game," said Johnson. "Our passing and
rebounding have improved, and we are getting a lot
more quality shots."
This improvement was evident in its most recent
game, a 2-1 victory over the Pacific Tigers last Satur
day. Before the Pacific game, Stanford had only scored
one goal for the season.
Saturday was also the first time that senior Elise
Morgan played the entire game at rnidfield, scoring
both of the goals against the Tigers. Morgan had missed
Stanford's first five games because of a pulled quad
muscle.
"Elise has the best ball control skills on the team,"
Johnson said. "She can maneuver the ball around any
body." The Cardinal had difficulty controlling the ball in
the rnidfield in the first Cal game, but that should change
with Morgan playing in the rnidfield, Johnson added.
Another difference in this Saturday's game with the
Bears is that Stanford will play on its home field. The
first game took place on California's Astroturf field,
whereas Saturday's game will be on Stanford's grass.
"It's a different game on grass," said junior defender
and tri-captain Leah Jacobs.
According to Jacobs, grass is not as smooth nor as
fast as Astroturf, which changes the entire strategy of
the game. On grass, the ball can be passed into spaces
since the ball does not travel as quickly. Astroturf forces
the passes to be much more accurate or the ball will go
out-of-bounds.
The home advantage will be a factor, accord
ing to Jacobs. "We're used to playing the bumps on
grass and the stick stopping is very different," Jacobs
said.
Stanford's home field advantage will not guarantee a
victory, however. Cal is still in first place in the NorPac.

According to Johnson, the Bears' strength lies in their
penalty corners, while their defensive line and goalie are
weaknesses.
Where the Bears are the Cardinal's old rivals, Davis
is a brand-new program that is looking to establish itself.
In their only game of the season, they fell 2-0 to Cal.
The Cardinal's experience will be a big factor, Jacobs
said. "It's their first year and we have played together
longer, but I'm sure they have good athletes. They are
really on the rise," she said.
Even with experience on their side, Stanford still has
to play on consecutive days. However, Johnson is not
concerned.
"That won't be a factor," Johnson said. "It's just like
a tournament set-up."
