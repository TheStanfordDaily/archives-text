# No superstition, just determination
## Women's soccer coach Sawyers aims to develop athletes as people 
### Jordan Wruble Staff writer 
In his days as a professional soccer player
in England, lan Sawyers was superstitious
about the way he tied his shoes, always lacing
the right before the left.
Now, in his second year as head coach of
the Stanford women's soccer team, Sawyers
has shed those rituals. He would, however,
like to start a tradition wherein new assis
tant coach and former Cardinal superstar
Sarah Rafanelli buys him a pizza after every
victory.
"But she never will," the coach sighed.
To this point, Rafanelli has saved herself
the cost of a lot of pizzas, as the squad is unde
feated heading into today's match against
Sacramento State. Last season, Sawyers' first
as Stanford's head coach, was the best in
Stanford history. The Cardinal went 18-2-2
and advanced to the Final Four of the NCAA
Tournament for the first time ever.
Bereft of pizza, Sawyers said he celebrates
winning quietly: "I sleep." But Sawyers hard
ly lays down on the job and his determination
as a coach is borne out by his record. Although
he admits wins and losses are the ultimate
measure of a coaches' success, he is also very
concerned with developing his athletes as peo
ple.
"If we can put our players in a successful
environment. . . then they are going to be suc
cessful, whether that be in the training envi
ronment or whether that be in life or personal
things or social life."
Sawyers' positive attitude stems from his
background as a teacher in England.
"One of the most important parts of being
a coach is being a teacher," Sawyers said.
"You've got to want to be able to pass things
on to young people and watch them develop.
That's one of the beautiful processes."
According to Sawyers, there are four com
ponents to soccer which he must develop in
his players: "Physical, technical, tactical and
mental." He considers the mental aspect the
toughest for a coach to affect and points out
that starting classes this week has impaired
his players in that dimension. "You see this
week, the kids get disrupted," Sawyers said.
"You've got to try to be patient with that and
try to help them through it."
As a former professional soccer player in
England, Sawyers knows how the game looks
from the field. His ability to relate to the play
ers dictates his approach to coaching them. He
avoids emotional outbursts and "Win-one-for
the-Gipper" type pep talks, preferring instead
to deal directly and honestly with his team.
"If you use tricks, I think that can be seen
through by the players," said Sawyers. "There
has got to be a belief . . . between the coach
and the player that each person has faith in
each other."
By developing a bond with his players and
gaining their trust, Sawyers is able to get
inside their minds and determine how to
motivate each individually. "With some play
ers you have to reaffirm how great they are,"

Sawyers explained. "Some want to be chal
lenged. They want to know when they are in
the wrong position."
What do Sawyers' players think of him?
"Right now?" he queried after some
laughter, knowing he has just finished
putting his players through another tough
practice. "There's going to be times when

you are very demanding of your players and
they will probably think, 'God! He was tough
on us today.' And there's times when they
are going to think 'Oh man, that was an easy
session.' Or, 'He really cares about us.' The
most important thing for me is that I want

kids after they've been here for
four years to say, 'Yeah, I did
everything I possibly could with all
the potential and ability I had.' "
At that, according to senior

fullback Melinda Minstrell, he is
successful. "He demands the best
from his players," said Minstrell.
"He won't let you drop below
what you should be. ... He
makes me do the best that I can
do." Although he is demanding,
Minstrell points out that
Sawyers also "knows when it's
time to chill out and say some

thing silly."
While Sawyer's knowledge of
soccer is extensive, he is humble
enough to seek the council of other
successful coaches at Stanford. "I
think the great thing about being
here is I can learn from people like
(tennis coach) Dick Gould and
(baseball coach) Mark Marquess
and (football coach) Bill Walsh. I

have great role models set in place
for me here," Sawyers said. "I
think it's important that I use
those people as a resource."
Sawyers is demanding of him
self and scrutinizes how his
actions affect team success. He is
also very competitive.
"Ultra-competitive," Minstrell
asserted, and then repeated it for

emphasis. When he wants to
loosen-up the squad — and also
show off his abilities — Sawyers
leads a "staff team" (which
includes Rafanelli) against the
starters. Sawyers enjoys these
challenge matches, saying, "We
trash talk our players. . . . We
have a lot of fun with that. We
poke fun at our kids and they love

playing against us — and kicking
me.
It is not unusual to find
Sawyers competing with his team.
It is rumored that after boasting of
his prowess in baseball, midfielder
Carmel Murphy has challenged
him to put up or shut up. Maybe if
he hits a home run, he will finally
get his pizza.
