# Sailers drown nation's elite
## 
### Daniel Kao 
Call it revenge. Call it
redemption. Call it what you
will, but at the Yale. Intersec
tionals, held the weekend of
Sept. 17-18, the Stanford
women's sailing team turned
the hostile waters of Connecti
cut into its own version of the
Red Sea.
The fourth-ranked Cardinal
women's sailing team came
away with its first out-of-dis
trict first-place finish at an
intersectional for the first time
in a decade.
To add to the satisfaction, the
victory marked the sailing
team's return to the site of last
year's nationals where the Car
dinal women's sub-par perfor
mance left them with a disap
pointing ninth-place finish. This
weekend, however, Stanford left
the rest of the field, which fea
tured 10 of the top 12 teams in
the nation, seeing red.
It wasn't all smooth sailing
for the Cardinal team, however.
Stanford started out poorly, per
haps conjuring visions of its last
trip to the home of the Elies.
After the first day of the regatta,
which featured the racing of the
slightly larger 420's, not the
Flying Juniors with which the
team are more accustomed, the
sailors found themselves in sev
enth place, 34 points behind the
leaders.
"We hadn't been sailing for
awhile and weren't really work
ing well together," said junior
skipper Cinnamon Hapikian,
one of four women sent to com
pete in the women's division.
"The weather was also tough to
deal with."
The physical, as well as
metaphoric, clouds that had
been hanging over the Cardinal
team in Connecticut apparently
parted during the second day of
the regatta.
"Things started clicking. We
picked it up. We pulled together,
and even the weather was bet

ter," Hapikian said.
The team rallied and came
away with an exceptional start
to a promising season with sec
ond-year coach Steve Bourdow.
With a balance of youth and
experience — all but four skip
pers are returning but only six
crews are back — Stanford
appears poised for a run for
number one.
The Cardinal features three
stand-out returning skippers:
Hapikian, junior Gretchen
Uznis and sophomore Alice
Manard. The co-ed team also
welcomes back senior Charles
Meade, who was named an Hon
orable Mention Ail-American
last season.
"We are one of three or four
teams that truly has a shot at
winning nationals. We're also
glad to have the West Coast
Nationals held in-state in San
Diego with FJ's [Flying

Juniors], the boats we are most
comfortable with," said Blake
Middleton, Stanford's director
of sailing.
The team's next challenge
will be in Newport Beach this
weekend, at the Singlehanded
Districts hosted by the UC-
Irvine Anteaters. Approximately
a dozen teams from the Pacific
coast will take part in the com
petition, the first meeting of the
season for schools located in the
west.
The top two finishers in both
the women's and co-ed divisions
qualify for nationals, so the
stakes aren't small. But the Car
dinal team expects nothing but
success.
"Our women should be the
best there. I wouldn't be sur
prised if two of them qualified. A
couple of people on our co-ed
team also have a good chance,"
Middleton said.
