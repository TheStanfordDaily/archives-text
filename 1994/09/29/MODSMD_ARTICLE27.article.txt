# Residence hall smoking ban implemented; proposed ban on cigarette sales eliminated
## 
### Heather Hardwick Staff writer 
A year after the enactment of a University
policy forbidding smoking in buildings, vehicles
and covered walkways, a complete ban on
smoking in residence halls has finally taken
effect.
The University extended the smoking ban to
include all residences on Sept. 1. The ban had
been postponed a year because at the time of
the original policy's implementation, the annu
al residence agreements had already been
signed without the inclusion of the no-smoking
ban.
Officials have received no complaints about
the month-old smoke-free residence policy.
Enforcement of the policy follows the lines of
the University's alcohol policy and Honor Code.
"It's a policy of the University and like any
other policy, we are depending on the students
to be monitoring what's going on in the resi
dences," said Ann Porteus, acting co-director of
Residential Education.
"My impression is that people around here
are used to a non-smoking environment," she
added. "People are pretty ready to jump up and

say to someone who's lighting up, 'Excuse me,
but this is a no-smoking area.' "
The year-old policy banning smoking in all
University buildings, vehicles and covered
walkways seems to have caused little contro
versy. Doug Dupen, an employee relations spe
cialist, said no violations of the policy have been
reported.
"The fact that I've not been called indicates
that whatever problems there may be, the
supervisors have taken care of it in the field,"
he said.
A proposed ban on campus cigarette sales
was eliminated last spring because of student
complaints, said Dean of Students Michael
Jackson.
Ken Shark, manager of retail services for the
Bookstore, said the University had considered
implementing the ban last year, then moved to
postpone its implementation, before lifting the
ban altogether. Tresidder Express rents its
space from the Bookstore.
"There's been a lot of controversy over
whether banning it was going too far in dictat
ing what people can and cannot do," Shark
said.
"It is my understanding that [University]

President [Gerhard | Casper had rescinded the
part of the policy that banned the sales of
cigarettes," said Bobbie Braden, director of
Tresidder Union.
Jackson agreed, explaining that the presi
dent lifted the ban afler talking to a number of
students who "said they should be able to make
their own decision" about buying cigarettes.
"We sell [cigarettesl in a very low key man
ner; it's behind the counter and there is no
advertising," Shark said. "We provide it but we
don't market it at all. We don't encourage the
use of a product that's not good for you."
Cigarette sales make up nine percent of sales
at Tresidder Express. Their potential absence
would have dealt a severe monetary blow to the
store.
"Unfortunately there isn't really anything
to substitute for it. From a sales point of view,
it's really just a loss of revenue," Shark said.
"It's not as if someone who normally buys
cigarettes is just all of a sudden going to switch
to buying something else."
Tresidder Express employees said that they
would continue selling cigarettes until their
lease runs out next year, after which the policy
will be renegotiated along with the lease itself.
