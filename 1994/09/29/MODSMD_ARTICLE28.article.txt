# Trailers to vanish, move clears space for grad housing
## 
### Shirley Park Staff writer 
The Manzanita Park trailers,
traditional housing for students
who fare poorly in the annual
Draw, will soon disappear from
campus forever. The trailers will
be moved to make room for a new
graduate student housing com
plex, one of two slated to be built
in the next several years.
It is uncertain exactly where
the 50 remaining trailers will go,
but they may be given to a non
profit organization. If no party
steps forward to claim the trail
ers, they will be discarded, said
Keith Guy, director of Housing
and Dining Services.
The new housing centers will
hold over 500 graduate students
upon completion, thus alleviating
the most pressing graduate hous
ing concerns.
Guy estimated that only 40
percent of graduate students are
housed on campus, forcing the
surplus number who apply for
housing — between 300 and 600
students — to seek off-campus
dwellings.
The new Manzanita dormitory
— with an expected capacity of
280 — would more than compen
sate for the loss of the trailers,
which fit 150 students.
The Manzanita proposal is
awaiting approval from the Board
of Trustees, which should come
this academic year, Guy said.
An additional 226-bed gradu
ate housing complex will be built
at the west end of Governor's
Corner, he added.
The Governor's Corner apart
ments are part of the capital
improvement plan, which allo
cates funds to be spent on updat
ing campus housing.

The University is in the pro
cess of successfully remodeling its
undergraduate housing, and has
now turned its attention to grad
uate housing to meet more imme
diate needs, said Rodger Whitney,
associate director of Housing and
Dining Services.
The dollars targeted for build
ing undergraduate housing have
been redirected to graduate hous
ing, added Whitney.
The Graduate School of Busi
ness hopes to make the new Man
zanita housing "operable and
occupyable" by the summer of
1997, said Guy, while the Gover
nor's Corner apartments are on a
"fast time track" to open by the
fall of 1996, Whitney said.
It is still unclear where the
University will get funds for the
Manzanita facility, Guy said.
"Frankly, if the Business
School hadn't been interested [in
constructing the Manzanita dor
mitory 1, I don't think we would
have been building as many beds
[for graduate students] as we
are," Guy said.
The new facility will not be
funded through the capital
improvement plan, as the idea
was first initiated by the Business
School — although Housing and
Dining Services is willing to work
in conjunction with the school,
Guy said.
The Manzanita dorm will pri
marily house Business School
students during the academic
year, and the building will be used
for a Business School executive
education program during the
summer.
The two new graduate housing
112 acilities will join Crothers Memo
rial, Escondido Village and Rains
in providing student graduate
housing.
