## EPA settlement adds training, alters waste-handling procedures 
### Scott Van Winkle Staff writer 
Tuesday's settlement of haz
ardous waste charges against the
University has implications ex
tending beyond budgetary and
legal concerns that could alter
standard procedure at hundreds of
campus laboratories.
Between 4,000 and 8,000 people
— including faculty, students and
waste management workers — will
be required to undergo training in
hazardous waste handling, offered
jointly by the University's Envi
ronmental Health and Safety de
partment and the Stanford In
structional Television Network.
Training requirements are not
new, said Materials Science and
Engineering Prof. John Bravman,
who chairs the faculty committee
on health and safety. But, Brav
man added, the new training pro

grams will be more comprehensive
in response to "enhanced surveil
lance" by the state.
"Regulations simply have to be
followed every time without fail,"
he said.
Under the terms of the agree
ment, the University must meet 10
separate deadlines for providing
documentation of far-reaching ad
ministrative changes. Along with
training, the University has agreed
to shut down various waste han
dling operations and revise its
emergency response policy.
After those deadlines, Bravman
said, an inspector could suddenly
appear on campus and demand
written proof that, for example, a
particular graduate student had
received proper training for han
dling hazardous waste.
