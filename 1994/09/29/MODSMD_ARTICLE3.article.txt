# Beyond fines:
## EPA settlement adds training, alters waste-handling procedures 
### Scott Van Winkle Staff writer 
Tuesday's settlement of haz
ardous waste charges against the
University has implications ex
tending beyond budgetary and
legal concerns that could alter
standard procedure at hundreds of
campus laboratories.
Between 4,000 and 8,000 people
— including faculty, students and
waste management workers — will
be required to undergo training in
hazardous waste handling, offered
jointly by the University's Envi
ronmental Health and Safety de
partment and the Stanford In
structional Television Network.
Training requirements are not
new, said Materials Science and
Engineering Prof. John Bravman,
who chairs the faculty committee
on health and safety. But, Brav
man added, the new training pro

grams will be more comprehensive
in response to "enhanced surveil
lance" by the state.
"Regulations simply have to be
followed every time without fail,"
he said.
Under the terms of the agree
ment, the University must meet 10
separate deadlines for providing
documentation of far-reaching ad
ministrative changes. Along with
training, the University has agreed
to shut down various waste han
dling operations and revise its
emergency response policy.
After those deadlines, Bravman
said, an inspector could suddenly
appear on campus and demand
written proof that, for example, a
particular graduate student had
received proper training for han
dling hazardous waste.
Officials from the California De-
partment of Toxic Substances
Control acknowledge the level of
scrutiny has been higher at Stan
ford than at other educational
institutions in the state.
The scrutiny is justified,
according to DTSC spokesman
Allan Hirsch, because "a lot of
[the University's] fundamental
handling practices really were not
safe."
Hirsch cited as proof a series of
inspections conducted by his
department since 1988, each of
which found at least one violation
of state law. The most significant
violations were found at the Uni
versity's central environmental
safety facility on Oak Road, he
said.
The University admits that the
facility was inadequate, but has
contested most of the depart
ment's findings. Director of the
University's Environmental
Health and Safety Department
Larry Gibbs pointed out that even
if the facility was mismanaged,
the punishment really doesn't fit
the crime.
"We participated in discus
sions that focused on operating
practices," which are primarily
the responsibility of environmen
tal safety officials, "but the regu
latory practices (required) take
place in the lab itself," he said.
The new programs will cost
$880,000 this year and $770,000
next year, according to the Uni
versity's budget. In addition, the
University has agreed to pay
$695,000 to the state and
$300,000 to California environ
mental groups, raising the cost of
ths settlement to $2.65 million
over the next two years.
University Director of Com
munications Terry Shepard said
that according to Charles Kruger,
vice provost and dean of research
and graduate policy, the increased

costs will reduce the amount of
funds available to support the
University's academic mission, or
its "teaching side."
Meeting state requirements in
a time of shrinking budgets has
necessitated some invention on
the part of the University.
A multi-media presentation
has been prepared by SITN pro
ducer Chris Madison that could
be used in about half of the Uni
versity's 1,700 labs to meet the
requirements. "It's a much more
productive way to train," she
said, because it provides retention
rates up to five times the rates of
lectures and avoids the hassles of
scheduling such a large group.
Innovation has also alleviated
one of the problems the Universi
ty has concentrated on through
out the discussions — labeling
hazardous waste. Strict require
ments for such labels, which seem
to require a larger label than
would fit on typical laboratory
containers, were designed for
heavy industry, officials say.
They cite, for example,

requirements that six data items
be included on labels, and rules
disallowing the use of abbrevia
tions to defme vial contents.
But a new label introduced
into the Stanford community a
month ago, which used the sug
gestions of a graduate student in
chemistry to meet state require
ments in a more user-friendly
manner, has proven workable,
Gibbs said.
Finally, the University is look
ing to reform the regulations
which govern University
research.
"We're working with the state
to develop training workshops,
and develop an interpretation of
the regulations that is just based
on common sense," Shepard said.
"In a research lab, for example, if
something is labeled 'CO' one
would think these people would
know that the vial contains car
bon monoxide. We're looking for
regulations that increase the safe
ty of individuals and the environ
ment but don't defy common
sense."

said.
The University admits that the
facility was inadequate, but has
contested most of the depart
ment's findings. Director of the
University's Environmental
Health and Safety Department
Larry Gibbs pointed out that even
if the facility was mismanaged,
the punishment really doesn't fit
the crime.
"We participated in discus
sions that focused on operating
practices," which are primarily
the responsibility of environmen
tal safety officials, "but the regu
latory practices (required) take
place in the lab itself," he said.
The new programs will cost
$880,000 this year and $770,000
next year, according to the Uni
versity's budget. In addition, the
University has agreed to pay
$695,000 to the state and
$300,000 to California environ
mental groups, raising the cost of
ths settlement to $2.65 million
over the next two years.
University Director of Com
munications Terry Shepard said
that according to Charles Kruger,
vice provost and dean of research
and graduate policy, the increased

costs will reduce the amount of
funds available to support the
University's academic mission, or
its "teaching side."
Meeting state requirements in
a time of shrinking budgets has
necessitated some invention on
the part of the University.
A multi-media presentation
has been prepared by SITN pro
ducer Chris Madison that could
be used in about half of the Uni
versity's 1,700 labs to meet the
requirements. "It's a much more
productive way to train," she
said, because it provides retention
rates up to five times the rates of
lectures and avoids the hassles of
scheduling such a large group.
Innovation has also alleviated
one of the problems the Universi
ty has concentrated on through
out the discussions — labeling
hazardous waste. Strict require
ments for such labels, which seem
to require a larger label than
would fit on typical laboratory
containers, were designed for
heavy industry, officials say.
They cite, for example,

requirements that six data items
be included on labels, and rules
disallowing the use of abbrevia
tions to defme vial contents.
But a new label introduced
into the Stanford community a
month ago, which used the sug
gestions of a graduate student in
chemistry to meet state require
ments in a more user-friendly
manner, has proven workable,
Gibbs said.
Finally, the University is look
ing to reform the regulations
which govern University
research.
"We're working with the state
to develop training workshops,
and develop an interpretation of
the regulations that is just based
on common sense," Shepard said.
"In a research lab, for example, if
something is labeled 'CO' one
would think these people would
know that the vial contains car
bon monoxide. We're looking for
regulations that increase the safe
ty of individuals and the environ
ment but don't defy common
sense."
