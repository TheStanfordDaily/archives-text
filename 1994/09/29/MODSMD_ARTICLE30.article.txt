## HEDGES 
### 
■yr a Trhile Michael Hedges may not be widely known
\/\ / throughout Stanford, his lengthy list ofaccomplish-
V V ments makes one wonder why he isn't a more com
monly heard name.
In addition to praise from David Crosby and Graham Nash,
Hedges is admired by guitar master Steve Vai: "There is not
anyone on the face of God's beautiful blue earth that plays the
guitar like [him]."
The esteem accorded Michael Hedges arises from his tech
nique: a complicated variety of percussion punctuation of gui
tar strings, like snapping and hammering of strings, intricate
finger-picking, and distorted strumming. This kinetic style of
playing creates the illusion of multiple guitars, when in fact,
Hedges is the sole player.
Since his debut album, "Breakfast in the Field", Hedges has
expanded and become widely known as an emissary for
acoustic guitar. Voted Best Acoustic Guitarist for five consecu
tive years in Guitar Player magazine's reader's poll, Hedges also
received recognition in the publication's twenty-fifth anniver
sary issue as one of the"25 Flayers who Shook the World."
Of the six albums released by Fledges, none can be said to
sound alike. Each album has reflected the personal (or psycho
logical) development of the artist — from a man trying to cre
ate his own mythology, as in "Taproot," to an individual in
volved in introspection, as in"The Road to Return", Hedges'
most recent release. 1 lis music tries to mirror what he lives, and
is thus apt to change.
Musically, his character has evolved from purely an instru
mental focus to now include a smorgasbord of sounds (mostly
performed by Hedges himself): vocals, acoustic guitar, electric
bass, flute, keyboards, drums, harmonica, and more.
Experimentation with musical genres has also contributed
to Hedges' ever-changing character. "Live on a Double Planet"
contains live selections, including Prince's "A Love Bizarre"
and Dylan's "All Along the Watchtower," while "Taproot"
draws Celtic, folk, and "heavy rock" inspiration.
With such accomplishments and accolades from his audi
ence and his colleagues, Hedges seems to have kept out of the
limelight. Is it the quiet removal of a musical genius or some
thing else which makes one curious about him?
In a sort of homecoming, Michael Hedges will be perform
ing at Dinkelspiel on October 1. This is not the first time
that the native of Mendocino, Calif., has performed in the
Palo Alto area. In the years since 1981 when he enrolled in a
computer music seminar at Stanford, Hedges has played
around town at the Varsity Theater and St. Mike's Alley.
This time around, however, Hedges, tour, called "New Age
Vaudeville," will resemble more a variety act than a typical con
cert performance.

Wishing to "frame the guitar" and have the audience appre
ciate it more, Fledges will include a recitation of Lewis Carroll's
"The Jabberwock," flute playing, a monologue, and a humor
ous version of Oklahoma's state song. Fie will also be joined by
bassist Michael Manring.
After having spoken with Michael Hedges a few days
before his tour was to begin in Seattle, I realized that
variety and balance were two pivotal ideas to him.
Balance, it appeared, would result only if Hedges understood
and accepted variety in life, and his music attempted to re
flect that need.
Speaking with Hedges proved easy. Fie has ability to slide into
a conversation without anxiety or pretense. 1 le was "just another
guy on the telephone" who just happened to be a guitar virtuoso.

During a conversation on the typecasting of Hedges in the
category of "New Age," he argued that he did not necessarily
mind the category.
"If you've changed, but others won't let you be somebody
else... that's kind of unfair." Yet, regardless of how stigmatized
New Age is, he does not "mind being considered that, but I
don't want to just be that. I've always not been one particular
thing. The idea of expansion — that's my main activity right
now, so I can't really stay in any one category."
The reason why so many have typecasted Hedges may stem
from the fact that he is produced by Windham Hill, one of the
country's best-known "New Age" labels. Without having to
elaborate on what many consider "hot tub music," "aural wall
paper," or whatever you wish to call it, there has been a consid
erable amount of criticism of New Age music, philosophy,
lifestyle, et cetera, by the mainstream.
Arguably, these critics are the types of people who irk
Hedges for not seeing past the label of "New Age" and not at
tempting to understand and uncover his music.
Perhaps, Fledges speaks of truisms when talking about ex
pansion and resisting categorization. Yet, he made this com
ment seem so much more real while explaining "Sister Soul,"
one of the songs on his newest release "The Road to Return".
Hedges stated that the song was written when he was trying
to strike balance between his masculine and feminine sides.
"I think that a lot of people in our culture think that in order
to be a true man, you have to be X, Y, and Z. But there's two
sides to everyone, 'girl' and 'boy.' "
When asked about the whip-wielding mannequin in one
of the photos accompanying the lyrics to "Sister Soul" in the
liner notes, Hedges revealed that it belonged to a friend who
was a dominatrix. The explanation of the photographed
whip was definitely unexpected — a departure which makes
one appreciate an individual more and which makes one see
the validity in I ledges' comment on wanting to be category
free.
It seems pretty obvious after having spoken with him on the

telephone that Hedges does not
wish to dissect and analyze his
music from afar, but communi
cates its meaning by focusing
on himself. Even his descrip
tion of his acclaimed guitar
technique turned into a unspe
cific explanation.
"Well, the technique is al
ways very important and I do
always concentrate quite a bit,
but the technique is intended to
serve the composition." ■
