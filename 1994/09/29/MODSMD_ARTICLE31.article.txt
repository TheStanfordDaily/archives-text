# 'Better once than never, for never too late'
## Free Shakespeare in the Park presents 'Taming of the Shrew' in an unstuffy setting — and the price can't be beat 
### Story by Rob Ross 
Shakespeare. Even the name
sounds snobby, bringing back
squeamish childhood memo
ries of uncomfortable clothes, in
comprehensible dialogue and Eng
lish accents. Certainly, not a tun way
to spend a couple of hours.
Methinks an afternoon with Free
Shakespeare in the Park might
change your mind.
We're not talking high-stress
Shakespeare anymore. We talking
simple sets, simple costumes. We're
talking outdoors, on a field moresuit
ed to a volleyball game than a theatri
cal presentation. We're talking an au
dience that has replaced the coat and
tie with tie-dye and bell bottoms.
We're talking a smell that hints of
ganja rather than Chanel No. 5. We're
talking planes flying overhead, babies
breast-feeding and children playing
their Nintendo Gameboys.
And in some strange way, the
greatest playwright in the English
language seems to fit snugly in this
environment, as the Free Shake
speare in the Park's rendition of"'J he
Taming of the Shrew" clearly
demonstrates.
The show, performed at the Liber
ty Tree Meadow in Golden Gate Park,
has two remaining installments this
Saturday and Sunday at 1:30 p.m. and
certainly makes for a cozy day in the
park. Bring a picnic, a blanket and
someone to chat with. You don't need

a wallet because the cost of admission
is the best price of ail — free.
The show itself is filled with the
three S's so common to Shakespeare
an comedies: sexism, slapstick and
sexual innuendo. One of Bill's most
famous plots, the title refers to the
breaking-in of a particularly acid
tongued "shrew" (the infamous char
acter Kate) by her new husband, the
irrepressible Petruchio.
Of course, being Shakespeare, the
plot has more twists and turns than a
cup of frozen yogurt. Kate's sister
Bianca is being pursued by three suit
ors, all of whom concoct various plots
to attract her attentions. In the mean
while, Petruchio marries Kate (over
her violent objections) and begins the
"taming" of his wife.
What was termed "taming" in the
Elizabethan period is akin to "psy
chological abuse" in our more-en
lightened time. Petruchio rejects his
wife's new clothes and food, purport
ing a demand for higher quality even
when she is completely satisfied. As
she wastes away in starvation, he is so
rude to his servants that she sheds her
ill-humor just to compensate for his
belligerency.
The ending brings all the play's
tribulations to a close. However, given
the modern audience, it should come
as no surprise that what Shakespeare
thought of as an appropriate resolu
tion is not regarded as such by the
present cast. So, in this rendition, the
words may cast the shrew as "tamed,"
but the actions tell of a different end
ing.
Perhaps the most awe-inspiring
technological feat is the unexpectedly
good sound quality in an uncon
ducive venue—you can actually hear
all the words. That in itself may not
seem like such a big deal, but in out
door, poorly-enclosed environments
like the Liberty Tree Meadow, dia
logue is often literally lost in the wind.

Understanding the dialogue is an
other question entirely, but you may
find that when the atmosphere is
comfortable and the words are loud,
following along with Bill is not as
hard as you may remember.
The two stars of the show, Hec
tor Correa (Petruchio) and Charla
Cabot (Kate) both bring fullness to
characters that border on stereo
typical. Correa takes the humor
ous, bumbling and devious Petru

chio and adds dimensions of senti
mentality, making this 20th-centu
ry villain at least somewhat under
standable.
Really, though, the magic is not in
the play itself, nor is it the quality of
the performance (which is good hut
certainly not heart-wrenching).
Rather, Free Shakespeare in the Park
is an experience unto itself, one that
can he relished without extravagance.
And you can't heat the price. ■
