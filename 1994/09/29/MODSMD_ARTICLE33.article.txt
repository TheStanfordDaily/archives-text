# Lush
## Looking across the Atlantic, chipping away at the American mainstream 
### Story by Arnold Pan 
It's the curse of being " British." Look
ing at Lush guitarist and songwriter
Emma Anderson, sitting with a

blank, almost frightful stare on her
pale face, the image of a pop star
doesn't come to mind, at least in our
sense.

dess in con
cert, she lounges

disinterestedly backstage,
cracking sunflower seeds
maniacally. Both seem
too aloof, too detached

and too . . . well
"British."

But ask the band
the standard "Aren't I
you shoegazers and
what's that all about?"

questions and they'll bristle to
action. Anderson launches in,

giving the Yanks a little his
tory lesson.

"Well, this thing
about the shoega/.ers is ,
that, in England, it wasf
sort of invented as a
joke," she explains with
an oh-so-quaint accent, j
"It was a hit of a negative '
term. But in America,

people have really taken it quite seri
ously it seems. In England, they don't talk
about it anymore, really. But people are still
asking us, 'What do you think about being
called shoegazers?'
"We didn't really like it in the first place.
And we've sort of forgotten about it now. Re
ally, saying you were shoega/ing was saying
you were shit live. It really didn't mean much
apart from that. But I think in America it's
been taken a lot more seriously than in Eng
land. It's quite strange."
If you're not intimidated at the start, both
musically and image-wise, you'll find that
Lush, which includes drummer Chris
Acland and bassist Philip King, is quite a
friendly bunch. With the band, there are no
aloof pretensions or affected attitudes: they
speak and sing to you, not down or at.
Actually, they're not stereotypically
"British" at all, neither melodramatic carica
tures like Blur or Suede nor business-as
usual no-names like Swervedriver. It's just
that our Alternative Nation doesn't get Lush
and the feeling is mutual.
Indeed, Lush has had a tough time break
ing into the American alternative main
stream, although they've gained a steady
foothold through their Lollapalooza appear
ance two years ago and as one ot the consis
tently highest charting college radio acts.
Back in Britain, where the overexcited
music press is more apt to build up then cut
down new bands with innovative sounds he
fore they even release an album, Lush rode
its six month wave of hype in 1989 to become
a steady fan favorite. Over here, unless you
recycle sounds as the Counting Crows and

Pearl Jam have done, it's difficult to he
come rock stars. And that's if you're

just a little different, not completely

off the beaten path like Lush is.
Lush's ethereal pop does take a
lot of getting used to for those ex
pecting listener-friendly jingle
jangle. Rather than hitting with
instant impact, the band's droning
wall of guitar fuzz lulls the listener
slowly. And while the words are a
bit difficult to make out and the
songs go long on occasion, the

music engulfs fully, swirling and
spinning a dizzy daze. Hypnotic
songs with catchy bass grooves — like

C» / c
"Nothing Natural" off 1991's "Spooky"
album and "Desire Lines" from this sum
mers "Split" — don't startle compellingly,
but compel soothingly. Like Calgon, l.ush
takes you away.
"Well, obviously, it would be nicer to get
bigger audiences 1 in the States]," Anderson
says. "But 1 think we're all a bit cynical about
this MTV, getting that one song, selling a
million albums. Then, it's like, 'What do you
do next?' A lot of bands have done that. So, I
think the way we look at it, it would be nice
to just gradually build it up. We've been
doing all right."
"Yeah, I suppose a lot of people think
about the band a bit differently than we do,"

Berenyi interjects. "We don't
think, 'This records has got to
be so successful.' We were

just happy with it because it
is very good. Obviously, it
would be nice to make a

bit of fucking money out
of it.

"Like you said, it's
got to the point where it's
like, 'We've got to get a hit'
1 •. II . . -

and it all centers on one
hook or something. Or,
'Can't you put the title of the

lyric in the chorus?"'
Yet even the band's more accessible
. ... 1 I u..

verse-chorus-verse moments have been by
passed by a larger public. "Hypocrite," the
first single off "Split," should have been one
of the smashes of the summer, Buzz Clipping
and power-playing the band to wider recog
nition. The bass line bounces like in the
Breeders' "Cannonball," but right at the sur
face the biting words smolder with riot grrrl
rage, giving it a little too much spunk for
your average radio hit.
These tweaked-up songs point out why
Lush is such a difficult proposition: the
sweetness and light layered on top both belie
and underline the dark tone of Anderson's
and Berenyi's sometimes buried vocals.
If only because the lyrics are included in

"Split"'s liner notes, the
new album shows how
the pretty sounds work
with the spitting words
more clearly. "The Invisible
Man" tinkles, then roars
ominously as Berenyi's
breathy voice gasps like
she's losing her breath. As
she repeats to herself,
"Please let me start scream
ing," in a rapid whisper, it
feels like something's clos
ing in on you, as it does on
her.

"Well, 1 think the
truth of the matter is that a
lot of the lyrics have been
very dark on all our
records," Anderson ex
plains. "But because peo
ple can't read them or hear
them very well, they as
sume ... well, they just
don't know what they're

about. But now that
they know what they're
about, they sort of say,
'Oh, wow."'

"I think people
just hear it, really,
and think it's about
(lowers, summer
and nice things,"

Berenyi pauses to
think as she inter
k rupts Anderson.
"Cause they think

.it's kind of 'de-
I de-de-de.' I read
a review going on

about 'Kiss Chase'
(the second track on

"Split"), saying that it's all

these dark subjects in it. And yet, it's just too
poppy a song to carry those lyrics. Well, I'm
like, 'Oh, so you can only sing those kind of
lyrics if you make songs like Nick Cave.' Like
if you're going to he in a pop hand, you're
going to have to sing ballads."
In many ways, "Split" stands as Lush's
defining moment, a truer document of both
the band's message and the way it gets that
message across. Take the production as an
example: rather than enlisting "Spooky"
producer and Cocteau Twin Robin Guthrie
to work the board for "Split," the band set
tled on Mike Hedges to engineer the project.
Whereas "Spooky" highlighted Guthrie's tal
ent to replace raw intensity with ambient
mood, "Split" features a livelier, more natur
al sound. Yet more than the influence of any
producer, the album is the product of more
experience, more confidence and better mu
sicianship.
"Well, obviously, you get influenced by
things you really don't think about," Ander
son says. "Hey, the music we listened to when
we were growing up. And the limitations you
have — I think that influences you a lot."
Perhaps as Lush breaks down their own
musical limitations, they'll break through
the fickle pop music boundaries and chal
lenge Lollapalooza Nation to re-examine
what it expects from alternative rock and
what that means. As Berenyi points out, "No
one else could make a fucking sound like that
and I'm glad we did. I like it." ■
