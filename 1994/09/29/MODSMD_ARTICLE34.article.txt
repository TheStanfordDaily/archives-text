Manhattan Beach, California
«nr story starts here. An ex-actor turned
director ... .111 ex-dancer turned actor
turned producer... a video store kmc
tinning as a makeshift film school.
It's here that Quentin larantino, sick of pro
ducers promising him the world and offering
him only rejection, decided that hewaslrustrat
ed with Hollywood and wasn't going to take it
anymore.
He'd been shopping a few scripts around
town — "True Romance," "Natural Horn
Killers" — for a while; and after plenty of noth
ing, decided it was time lor something new,
something cheap, something th.it would make
him the commander of his own destiny.
Fnter Lawrence Bender, a 30-something
New York transplant who'd done a little of
everything— he'd danced, he'd acted, he'd even
produced a low-budget horror flick for
$125,000 with Scott Spiegel and Sam Raimi.
Spiegel, who knew both men, kept insisting that
they meet. Bender was game, but l arantino kept
his guard up.
It turned out Bender was the first producer
he'd ever met with a film credit under his belt.
And that, coupled with the fact that he had pro
duced the movie for a song, went a long way to
ward softening the Video Archive clerk's Bron
sonian exterior. They became fast friends, and
even faster partners in crime, larantino was
convinced that with his artistic know-how and
Bender's frugal production savvy that his latest
idea, "Reservoir Dogs," could be made fast and
cheap.
Hut will) a little cajoling, Bender convinces
him to think bigger.

Tarantino's replies with something to the ef
fect of, "All right buddy, you've got a two month
option — count 'em, one ... two. If you can't
close a deal in that amount of time, I'm going to
make like Flvisand do it 'My Way, you got that?"
So Bender falls upon his task like a lion at his
prey, hittingup every connection he can think of
for advice or financial support. But the payoff
came, via several acquaintances, in the form of
production house Live Pntertainment, which
ultimately financed the project for SI .5 million.
The rest, as we say in entertainment, is histo
ry. Or is it?
Two years later, what began as .1 loose collab
oration built on a new friendship has blossomed
into A Band Apart, Tarantino's and Bender's
production company. And what's more, every
single script larantino has ever written
"Reservoir Dogs, "True Romance," "Natural
Born Killers," and most recently "Pulp Fiction"
has been turned into a movie that either he or
another director has made.
A little under a year ago, Warner Bros, re
leased Tony Scott's production of "True Ro
mance," Tarantino's "Bonnie and Clyde" for the
'Ws, and just last month "Natural Born Killers,"
a modern-day taleof mayhem and the media di
rected by Oliver Stone (for which larantino
only took story credit because he felt it veered
too lar from the original), opened in theaters
across the country.
T heir filmmaking talents took them all the
way to the Palme d'Or at (Cannes lor Tarantino's
second film, "Pulp Fiction." As both are very
found of putting it, they already knew what Hol
lywood thought of them. When you're every
studio's fantasy and every critic's darling, it's not
hard to tell.
But the coup at Cannes is a stamp of approval
of sorts for the two hot shots. It's the badge that
elevates larantino from overnight sen-

sation to bonafide auteur.

And for Bender,

36, it

will afford him a new credibility and flexibility
the next time he sets out to fund a project. And
that suits him just fine.
Stanford, (California.

Our story resumes here. Bui before we con-

tinue, a few hints for the ben-

efit of latecomers: an
ex-actor turned direc-

tor ... an ex-dancer
turned actor turned
producer .. . four
scripts.. .a Palmed' Or.

.. a meteoric rise.
My first call to Ben-

der's office was intercept
ed by his personal assis
tant, Courtney. Her tone
was no-nonsense hut help-

ful.
Courtney: Lawrence Bender's

office. \
Me: Hi Courtney. I'm calling
from The Stanford Daily. I'm
supposed t0...
Courtney: You're s'posed to talk

to Lawrence.
Me: Right.

Courtney: Well he's actually fin
ishing up 11 meeting that's run way
over schedule. Can I vet your num-

ber and have him call you hack? It
should probably be in about half an
hour.

The 30 minutes slowly morphed
into 90. But when Bender finally re
turned my call, he seemed genuinely

disappointed in himself for keeping
me waiting so long, as if to suggest that
he's not the producer 1 iollywood keeps
saying he is.

Bender: Victor, how arc you?
Me: Oh not to ba...

Bender: Sorry I took a little while to get to you
here.
Me: Not a problem. I imagine you're pretty busy
right...

o
Bender: Yeah, I'm producing two
movies.
Or maybe when you're be-

hind the scenes, as he is more often
than not, believing your own hype is

something you just can't afford. In Hol
lywood terms, Bender is still a young
producer with only four bonafide film

credits — "Reservoir Dogs," "Pulp Fic
tion," Boaz Yakin's "Fresh" and Roger
Avery's "Killing Zoe" — to his name.

1 ie's well aware of the fact that without
the success of Tarantino's two films, there'd
probably be no Band Apart, no deals for Averv

r / r « /
(a Video Archive alum of Tarantino's) or even
Yakin, who co-wrote Clint Eastwood's "The
Rookie" with Spiegel several years ago. But why
explain a filmmaking machine that isn't broken
... yet?
Besides, he'd rather talk about his two latest
projects. "One movie starts shooting very, very
soon. It's called (tentatively] 'White Man's Bur
den.' It's a movie about a world where the
African-American population of the United

States is the majority and the business owner
and the white people are the minority and th«
un-employed."

Horror, crime, "soulful" social
crime again, French crime, soulf

of productions that have made I
the most respected young produc
the business today. And while 1
that he caught the producer bug;
ago, the majority of his caree
around his relationship with lar
isn't more than a few years old.
"I made my first little movie'
years old actually," he said. "But
with the Maine Ballet before I st;

New York. And I was in acting for most of my
twenties.
"I was there for a long time, and I'm really
probably the only guy in my acting class that
didn't go off and become a well-known actor."
Bender was a starving artist for quite a long
time. So he decided to make his move from in
front of the camera to behind it, working in var
ious crew positions for a number of years.
But if you come to Hollywood to become a
movie star, even if you successfully manage to
ignore the impulse for a while, it'll keep calling
you until you return to it.
The little voice inside Bender's head followed
him everywhere, until he decided to give acting
another chance. But this time, he decided, he'd
avoid the mistakes of his early attempts by pro
ducing a film in which he could act.
Bender: There's a little circle of friends of mind
that are all making movies mow. One of them,
Boaz Yakin who directed 'Fresh.'
Me: Yeah, I saw that.
Bender: Oh, what did you think?
Me: As 'hood films go, it was sort of strange. I felt
as if I should have known where the narrative was
going, but I didn't. It was sort of like a 'hood film

gone noir. I thought it
worked though. It worked.

Bender: You know it's
funny. We never really

saw it as a 'hood
movie. We saw it as a

very soulful tnovie
about a kid who's

in a really bad
predicament,

and through
his relation-

ship with
his fa-

th e r,
he's

able
to

g e t
himself out in a

very Sergio Leone
way, ob\'ioiisly"

He continued, "So it can be re-

latedto [other] 'hood movies because it's
in that [genre], it's black people in a drug world.
But we always felt with the music and this kid,
there's less violence in the movie [in compari
son to] 'Menace to Society' and some of these
other movies that are about the stuff that goes
down..."
My "uh-huh" 's abound once again. He
doesn't even give me a chance to ask
him, "Why tell a black story if neither
you or Yakin seem willing or able to address
the images of the world you exploit?"
"With 'Fresh' and 'Killing Zoe' and 'Pulp Fic
tion' I feel extraordinarily lucky to be involved,"

Bender said. "And you know, to some degree,
I've had a lot of responsibility for all of this my
self. I just feel like our relationships are all very
symbiotic.
"One of the things I'm really good at is bring
ing people together and supporting people," he
said. "So I think because of that I was able to pull
these [projects] off. But I am kind of a lucky guy
to have a group of such talented friends."
Fortunately for Yakin and Avery, when Ben
der and Tarantino were finally able to break into
the system, they didn't forget about the friends
they made coming up.
"Because Quentin and I started getting some
power, and because the two of us are a very tight
unit — we really support each other a lot — we
were able to use that to support the other people
around us."
A Band Apart also speaks to this vision. Be
fore the funding of "Reservoir Dogs" had even
been solidified, both men knew that they need
ed to be working together.
"We felt really good about our relationship
and we really thought that we complimented
each other," Bender remembers. The title of an
early film by French New Wave director Jean
Luc Godard, "Band Apart" or "Band of Out
siders" says simply, concisely and with flair,
that these guys and the people they choose to
produce are liable to do anything with a cam
era.

And they owe it all to the crit
ical success of "Reservoir

Dogs." But don't think
the plan wasn't

calculat
ed.

r
The
"sole

pur
pose —

* besides
making a

good movie
— was to

make sure that
we could make

another movie."
With only a few

days to go before the
national release of

"Pulp Fiction," the "an-

other movie" is here, and

there isn't an important per
son in entertainment who doesn't at least men
tion it once a day.
If "Pulp" rakes in the success that some crit
ics are forecasting, it may help to change the way
the big Hollywood studios will choose to make
films in the near future. But the "if' we're talk
ing about is a big one. For now, it's safe to as
sume that Bender — along with Tarantino —
will continue to help raising the stakes in mod
ern American cinema. ■
