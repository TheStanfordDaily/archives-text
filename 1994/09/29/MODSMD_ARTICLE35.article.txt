## Public Enemy offers weak future-vision 
### 
It's December 31st, 1999, and the planet is falling apart.
Whoever isn't being destoyed by the quotidian earthquakes, vol
canoes, fire, and ice flooding this arid landscape, or being decimat
ed by the many incurable diseases that plague the earth, is being
brainwashed by a powerful mind-altering drug known as White
Nostalgia. An ex-Klan leader has become president of the newly in
corporated Euro-America and now proceeds to realize his former
home organization's wet dream: the complete domination of the so
called "Third World."
Welcome to Public Enemy's Danger Zone.
"Muse Sick-N-Hour Mess Age," PE's sixth album in seven years,
is Chuck D's quasi-sci fi vision of a very possible new world order —
set to music. While equipped with an apocalyptic, highly theatrical

"Muse Sick-N-Hour Mess Age "
Public Enemy

presentation, the Bomb Squad's dazzling production and PE's pow
erful bass lines, the new CD never makes it out of the conceptual
stage.
The lyrical brilliance of "Fight the Power," the catchy refrain of
"911 is a Joke," or the sheer rythmic power of "Welcome to the Ter
rordome," qualities that fostered the large PK following, are all but
absent on "Muse Sick." The fury is still quite present. Only now it's
accompanied by plodding base-lines, incredibly dense lyrics set to
wack rhymes and a schizophrenic array of musical styles and gim
micks.
The first track, "Whole Lotta Love Goin On in the Middle of
Hell," begins with the pronouncement "if you don't stand up for
something, you'll fall for anything." After that, all heck breaks loose.
News clips and snippets of various civilians denouncing their soci
ety combined with the sound of a rocket about to take off, and a re
lentless countdown which ends at 6666 ... interact as a frenzied
multi-media precursor to armageddon.
The problem is the global destruction of black people. Chuck's
solution is to clean house. So everyone from drug dealers and faux
gangstas "talkin that gattalk," to hip-hop critics who critisize PE's
music come under fire as well as Whitey. At one point, Chuck D
booms, "right vs wrong/good vs evil/God vs the devil/which side are
you on?" Never before has he come so simplisticly.
The songs that do work, like "Give it Up" which contains an in
terpolation of "Opus De Soul," rely heavily on sampling, TV news
clips, or lyrics done by members outside the group. In "Thin Line
Between Law and Rape," just before the didactic lyrics and rhythm-

less chanting reaches an unbearable point, a
nameless dub artist grabs the mike and chats
up a storm. Crooning "me say no sista no cry,
nooo sista no cry," and"I gotta make up me

mind to get me freedom/yes/me
no wanna take no sense/me want

me freedom," he infuses the
song with a shocking passion
and, dare I say it, vulnerability.
Buried within "Muse
Sick" is probably a very im
portant message. Unfortu
nately, few beyond die-hard
PE fans will have the pa
tience to wade through the
recycled music to hear it.
