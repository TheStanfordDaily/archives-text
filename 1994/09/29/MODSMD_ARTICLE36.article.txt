# All Petty, no apologies
## Musicians reinterpret, yet deliver reverent tributes to pop hero 
### 
So there is something gritty about
Tom Petty. All those years in my
youth when I reveled in the gentle,
non-offensive southern flavor of
Petty's whine. All those years when 1
cranked "Free Falling" to 11 and
melted in pop brilliance. All those
years, I never suspected that there
could be something uneven, some
thing downright noisy behind
Petty's catchiness.

"You Got Lucky:
A Tribute to Tom Petty"

I thought it was bubble gum so I
chewed.
Besides, who would want to com
plicate Tom Petty? The songs stood
on their own, bereft of irony or self
effacement, and we loved him for it.
It seems that a tribute album to Petty
should be grounded in reverence for
his unassuming appeal, not for his
little-known leanings towards feed
back and sonic delirium.
But the surprising thing about
"You Got Lucky: A Tribute to Tom
Petty" is that it makes no apologies
either, and in its best moments,
when the melodies are torn to pieces
and that hallmark catchiness is
chased out of the door, Petty seems
updated and vital.
Take Engine Kid's cover of
"Breakdown." It's noisy, caustic, and
exhilarating. Just making Tom Petty
sound like Primus would be enough
to turn people's heads, but Engine
Kid also injects a kind of punk fury
into the chorus that makes you want
to break something.
Likewise, when Nectarine revital

izes the bland mediocrity of "Even
the Losers," they turn a mid-eighties
testament to short shelf-life pop into
something quirky, idiosyncratic,
and once again noisy. A feedback
laden version of "You got Lucky" by
Edsel is similar: under-produced,
messy, excellent.
The great songs on this album do
not rise above their material. They
reinterpret, hinging on the pop in
stinct that's already there. They suc
cumb to these songs without protest
or reliance on irony, and it's reassur
ing to know that the bands that suc
ceed on this album are all down with
Tom Petty in some kind of meaning
ful way.
It's important to note, though,
that about half of the tracks on "You
got Lucky" are worthless. Certain

songs, especially "Here Comes my
Girl" by Throneberry and "Listen to
Her Heart" by Truck Stop Love,
sounds like a bunch of high-school
ers banging away at Tom Petty in the
garage. They sound like Petty just
enough to make you wish you were
listening to the original.
Overall, though, you have to like
an album with a song like Silk
worm's "Insider." It's spare and
quiet, mostly drums and a voice, and
it sounds like someone's late-night
take on a tune they used to listen to
way back when. The respect is still
there; it's irony-free and lovely, and
it's entirely new. The best moments
of this album are all like that — un
apologetic, different and respectful,
all at the same time.
