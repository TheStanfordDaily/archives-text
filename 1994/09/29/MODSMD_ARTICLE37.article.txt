# Peter Gabriel's 'Secret World Live' — the mark of a great artist
## 
### 
Too often the only difference between a live and stu
dio-recorded album is applause and screaming from the
audience on the live version. It is the mark of a truly
great artist to be able to release unique live and studio

recorded versions
of the same songs.
Peter Gabriel
more than quali
fies as a great
artist with his
new "Secret
World Live"

album. A combination of his most famous hits and
songs from his 1993 release "Us," the two-disc "Live"
version is by far Gabriel's best work ever.
Recorded on two nights in Italy in 1993, "Secret
World Live" demonstrates Gabriels immense musical
talent, incredible voice and his penchant to display
emotion to thousands of people.
Most of the lyrics on the "Us" album discuss Gabriel's
lost love, and the pain he endured by losing her is in
credibly apparent on the live album.
In addition, Gabriel's talented band and backup
singers, with their ability to improvise and play solos,
make the entire album musically diverse.
In "Digging in the Dirt" off "Us," Gabriel's frustration

"Secret World Live"
Peter Gabriel

as he describes a fight in a car is much more apparent in
the live version. He belts, "Don't say nothing, keep your
hands on the wheel/don't turn around, this is for real."
During one of the best songs on the album, "Secret
World," one can feel Gabriel's vulnerability just by lis
tening to his voice. He sings, "I stood in this unsheltered
place/so I could see the face behind the face."
By far the highlight of "Secret World Live" is the 11-
minute version of Gabriel's most popular song "In Your
Eyes." Often thought of as a love song, the lyrics are ac
tually about Gabriel's religious

beliefs. Gabriel begins the live
version with the words, "Accept
ing all I've done and said/I will
stand and stare again/til there's
nothing left in your eyes" and
later adds "Whatever comes and
goes/ I will lead your silent call."
Gabriel has long been known
for incredible sets and action in
his concerts. But "Secret World
Live" makes it very clear that
what the eye sees during a
Gabriel concert is just a beautiful
addition to what the ear hears.
