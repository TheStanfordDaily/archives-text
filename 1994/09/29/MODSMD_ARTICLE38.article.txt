# A 						heroine of substance
## Meryl Streep and supporting cast keeps 'River Wild' 
### 
There's nothing like a good, not-so
old-fashioned heroine.
Gail qualifies. She's far from the
weeping victim common to so many ac
tion flicks, the ones who dangle off
mountains and wait for some daring
He-man to come rescue them, who
touch the side of their eye with a hand
kerchief when dastardly villains have
them in their sights.
Instead, Meryl Streep's Gail is strong
— so strong that she's the one who
paddles when she takes her son and
sort-of-nerdy, workaholic husband
rafting through a treacherous "River

Wild."
But while Gail i."'
strong physically and
emotionally, she does
n't have the muscle
hound brawn of
Linda Hamilton in
"Terminator 2:
Judgment Day." Insteac
she's a real person.
For pete's sake,
she's a mom.
In"The River
Wild," it's Streep's
character and
her innate che
mistry with
son Roarke

that carry the film. When her son accus

him, Gail matter-of-factly replies, "I'rr

not on anybody's side. I'm on every
body's side. I'm a mother."

The River Wild

ner Streep, the family-oriented heroine
is a real change from the etherea
women with tragic pasts she has playec
in films such as "The French Lieu
tenant's Woman" and "Out of Africa."
In"The

River Wild," Streep has substantive
back-up. David Strathairn ("A Danger
ous Woman," "The Firm") perfectly
portrays the insecure, stressed-out hus

band who gradually grows and changes
through the run down the river.
Children of workaholics everywhere
will empathize with Roarke, whose fa
ther brings a notebook computer on the
family vacation. Thus, it'sc 'to under
stand why he falls for the malevolent,
mesmerizing, much cooler charms of
Wade (Kevin Bacon).
Bacon turns in a better performance
than anyone could reasonably expect
from the former dancing rebel of "Foot
loose" fame. Overall, he's kind of a mys
tery a.s an unpredictable, spooky force.
His creepy gaze and the magnificent

twists and turns of the river pro
vide the measure of suspense
that the largely predictable:
t plot lacks.

Here are the basics:
Couple with rocky mar
iagc take their son on raft
ing trip for his birthday.
Bad guys also float down
river. Figure it out from
there.

One lesson to
be learned
is that the
lighter the
boat, the
k. m ° r e
likely it is

to sur
vive the treacherous waters. If
that lesson is applied to film, mavbe the

lack of plot is fortunate.
Certainly the strength ofStreep's per
formance is more than enough to keep
the boat from sinking.
