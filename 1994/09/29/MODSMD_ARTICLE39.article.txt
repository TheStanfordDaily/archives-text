# Sloppy writing, dangling subplots cast clouds over 'Blue Sky'
## 
### 
She a nympho, he's a nerd. Together, what are they? A mar
ried couple who, between the two of them, cause more con
troversy on the military bases they've inhabited than the on
going push for a nuclear-testing ban.
Academy award-winning actor Tommy Lee Jones stars in
"Blue Sky" as nuclear physicist Hank, a lone rescuer manning
a sinking lifeboat and tossing innertubes to drowning blind
men. As a soldier/scientist responsible for measuring radia
tion levels at U.S. Army nuclear test sites

screens

during the heat of
the Cold War,
Hank gets shut-

Blue Sky

tied from base to
base each time he writes an honest re
port detailing dangerous practices.
On the homefront, his sensually
charged wife Carly (Jessica Lange)
suppresses a raging libido and a gnaw
ing age anxiety any way she can —
snatching from her grab bag every
thing from entertaining foreign ser
vicemen with erotic dancing to hook
ing up with 1 lank s boss, all while he's
away on business.
Also problematic, his teen-aged
daughter attempts to arrest her par
ents' attention by sneaking around

with a military brat. In the process, she nearly kills herself one
night when she unknowingly pulls the pin from a live grenade.
In the meantime, the protagonist brandishes a plastic
sword of denial in a pathetic effort to keep his crumbling
world in check. About the only thing in poor Hank's control
is his trusty Geiger counter.
With crazy characters and several dangling subplots, "Blue
Sky" tugs the audience's attention just enough to keep people

in the theater. Yet Rama Laurie
Stagner and her co-writers seem to
have tossed in more conflicts than
they can resolve.
After tantalizing viewers with

Cold-War politics, sexual psychoses, dysfunctional family life
and the promise of some sort of upheaval due to anti-nuclear
activism, Stagner leaves them suspended with no resolution
in sight. It's as if she forgot to write Act 111 in the family's tu
multuous saga.
By the time Carly rides into the sunrise astride a horse she's
never ridden before, embarking on an incredulous mission to
release her husband from the insane asylum to which she
naively committed him, the audience doesn't really care about
an ending.
That's about when we sympathize with the real victims of
the story — all us fools who plunked down seven bones for a
pointlessly open-ended, sagging screenplay.
