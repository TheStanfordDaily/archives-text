# Finding a new home
## Bridge may move 
### Bryan Sun 
Due to safety concerns about
the poor condition of its buildings,
the Bridge — along with its live-in
counselors — may be moving into
one of the smaller on-campus
dorms as early as next year.
The proposal, which was draft
ed by counselors from the campus
peer-counseling center, is current
ly under consideration by Residen
tial Education.
Res Ed and the Bridge are
scheduled to talk seriously about
plans for a peer counseling theme
dorm soon, and Res Ed may act on
the proposal within the next few
weeks, said Diana Conklin, acting
co-director of Res Ed.
The initial draft of the Bridge's

plan calls for the use of one of the
campus's smaller upperclass dor
mitories. Neither Res Ed nor the
Bridge would specify which dorm
they have in mind.
The dorm would resemble other
theme-based houses, with the pri
mary focus on counseling issues.
The initial plan calls for the dorm
to house peer counselors in order
to continue services currently of
fered by the Bridge, highlighted by
24-hour walk-in counseling.
The Bridge's relocation is a re
sult of a report released last year
that found the counseling center's
current office space in an unsafe
condition.
Since the inspection report's re-
lease, the Bridge has explored
several options. Counselors said
the Res Ed plan is one of their last
choices.
"We had three options. First,
there was keeping the Bridge and
making repairs, but the cost to fix
the Bridge was around half a mil
lion dollars. Second, we could find
other office space on campus. And
third, we could move into the Res
Ed system," said senior Chris Li,
a live-in counselor and one of the
plan's primary authors.
"There just was no other space
for us ... we couldn't fund the
repairs. [The Res Ed proposal) is
our last option," he added.
The switch from an indepen
dent building into a counseling
focused dorm will make some
changes to the Bridge's operation,
Li said. For example, the change
to a Res Ed system might require

a overhaul of how the counselors
provide services.
"Right now we're very inde
pendent. We have our own
fundraising, our own services,
and our own house, though we do
have an advisory board," he said.
"Res Ed complicates that. There's
the introduction of an RA (resi
dent assistant) and the problem
of drawing into the house, which
are things we haven't dealt with
before."
The Bridge's plan has yet to be
officially considered by Res Ed,
but preliminary reactions have
not suggested any serious prob
lems with the proposal.
Conklin said that she "sup
ports the organization" and that
the plan contains "nothing
against Res Ed's general policy."
But, she said, Res Ed has
"some questions and we have to
talk to Lthe students who pro
posed the idea] before we can
make a decision."
Li agreed that the general atti
tude toward the plan, at least in

the early stages, was supportive.
In the mean time, the Univer
sity has allowed the Bridge to
remain in its main building this
year.
"When I talked to the adminis
tration about the status of our
current building for next year,
they said we could wait until the
Res Ed option gets fleshed out,"
Li said. "Though the specifics
aren't for sure, I think we're get
ting administrative support."
Troy Gilbert, the assistant
director of student activities, also
expressed support for the plan,
voicing concern that students
would think the University was
intentionally trying to close down
the Bridge.
"Getting that building up to
par would require more money
that we don't have right now,"
Gilbert said. "I felt that the best
solution to the situation was to let
the Bridge community champion
their own options and come up
with their own solution ... I'm
glad to hear of this proposal."
