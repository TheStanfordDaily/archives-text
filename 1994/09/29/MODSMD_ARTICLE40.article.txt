## Justice for few in 'Shawshank' 
### 
About three quarters of the way through "The .Shaw
shank Redemption," the film's protagonist Andy
Dufresne, a once successful bank exec who's spent the
better part of 20 years behind bars serving a double life
sentence for a crime he didn't commit, has come to the
end of his rope.
lust ice is the phoniest of social ideas, Dufresne de
termines. And hope ... hope's for kids waiting for a
elimpse of Santa Clans on Christmas Eve. Determined

Shawshank Redemption

to end his miserable existence, Dufresne tells his friend
Red (Morgan Freeman) that it's time to either luirry
up livin' or hurry up dyin'. By morning, Dufresne's
successfully escaped through a hole in his cell wall.
The ex-businessman's dramatic decision to "hurry
up livin', " met enthusiastically by those of us perched
in the peanut gallery, is the recompense " The Shaw
shank Redemption" promises from the very start. It's
also newcomer director Frank Darabont's stylistically
heavy-handed way of reminding us that he's neither
interested in arguing for prison reform nor promoting
interracial friendship (Red is black).
He just called to remind us that a kangaroo court
can convict an innocent man and a lawless penal sys
tem can break him, but the truth has a funny way of
righting wrong situations.
The troubling thing is that the primary point of in
terest is supposed to be Dufresne's triumph over the
place and its crooked administrators. CConsequently,
Darabont misses the coded significance ot casting
Freeman as both the narrator of Dufresne's story and
his best friend in an otherwise all-white narrative.
1 le muddles a statement about institutionalization by
juxtaposing our man's yearning for freedom alongside a
paroled con's who's spent 50 years behind bars need for
eternal incarceration Darabont feels no remorse about
abandoning Red or anyone else once 1 )ufresne escapes.
It's a bunch of unnecessary untidiness.
Still, there is much to admire in "Shawshank." Rob
bins and Freeman are the stand-outs in a remarkably
capable cast. Stunningly naturalistic cinematography
from Roger Deakins place us on the grounds of the
prison and we experience the kind of direction that
we'd normally expect from a filmmaker more sea
soned than Darabont.
The director adapted his screenplay from one of
Stephen King's short stories. We can only hope that the
