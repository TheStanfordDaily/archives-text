Miyake Not quite the atmos
phere for a first date, but Miyake
certainly offers a dining experience
that won't soon be forgotten. Sushi
is accompanied by shouting waiters
and chefs, as well as a rather ram
bunctious clientele. Challenge the
waiter to a sake bomb count to

three in a combination
of Spanish and Japan
ese before chugging. If
you're with a small
party, try to sit at the
sushi bar, where mini
boats full of sushi circle
past, and you can
choose whatever takes
your fancy. A meal sans
sake bombs will usually
cost about $8- $15.
Reservations are not ac
cepted, so be prepared
to stand in line for
awhile. Located at 261
University Ave., Miyake
is open daily from 11:30
a.m.- 10 p.m. 323-9449.

Fuki-Sushi This restaurant is an
enormous sushi spot with many din
ing options, including sushi bar, ta
bles, and tatami rooms. The atmos
phere is elegant, the service is great,
and the selection of Japanese cuisine
is exceptional. However, vegetarian

fare is not the easiest thing to find on
the menu. The atmosphere corre
sponds with the price, as meals usu
ally run from $ 15- $25 per person.

Palo Alto, Fuki-Sushi is open every
