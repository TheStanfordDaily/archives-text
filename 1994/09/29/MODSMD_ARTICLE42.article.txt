Barcelona
Whit Stillman's new film "Barcelona"
benefits from not only the witty repar
tee of two American cousins but also
the cultural richness of the Catalan
capital, Barcelona. Stillman, director
of "Metropolitan" which was set in
New York City, utilizes intellectual
banter to create a brilliant comedy

The Cathedral of the old city serves
as a backdrop along with brightly lit
boulevards replete with "Trade Fair
girls" for two American cousins. One,
Fred, an ROTC Navy man, and the
other Ted, a sincere and ardent yup
pie obsessed with the culture of
sales, embark on a quest for ro
mance
Fred may seem boorish and Ted in
sufferable, yet it is worth it to tag
along with them on their adventures
through "Barcelona " Stillman's cere
bral comedy perhaps mirrors his owr
search. He married a woman from
Barcelona and his two daughters
were born there.
Clear and Present Danger
Harrison Ford's newest movie, "Clea
and Present Danger" is yet another
ill-fated attempt to put Tom Clancy's
best-selling novels on screen. The
movie recounts the adventures of
Jack Ryan, acting CIA Director,
played by Ford in a continuation of
his role in "Patriot Games." The fail
ures of this blockbuster movie follow
Ford to Clancy's newest cinematic
attempt A poor script and poor and
obvious camera work plague this
otherwise intriguing flick.
"Clear and Present Danger" does
abound in shining comic moments.
Indeed, there are enough killer one
liners to fill an HBO special. One lin
ers. however, do not a movie make.

Neither does an outstanding star.
Though seven bucks would be a
waste, "Clear and Present Danger"
makes a great matinee.
Eat Drink Man Woman
Ang Lee, director of last year's inter
national success "The Wedding
Banquet," serves up a delectable
new comedy of food, fatherhood,
fornication and filial relations. "Eat
Drink Man Woman" is a gourmet af
fair — a hearty feast for your eyes.
Filled with an abundance of sensa
tional Chinese dishes, this romantic
yet rueful celebration of basic
human desires reduces "Like Watei
for Chocolate's" impassioned fies
tas to a traditional Weight Watcher's
meal plan.
"Eat Drink Man Woman" is a fulfilling
banquet, both entertaining and hear
warming. Go with a big appetite. Bor
Appetit!
Quiz Show
Following in the footsteps of Oliver
Stone's "Natural Born Killers," Quiz
Show also examines the power of
the media. While Quiz Show doesn
rally the American public behind vi
cious mass-murderers, it does rap
the knuckles of the manipulative
hands of network television execu
tives.
The film recreates many of the actua
events that entwined the lives of

btempel (played Dy John l urturro),
Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes)
and Richard Goodwin (Rob Morrow)
in the late 1950'5.
"Twenty-One," NBC's weekly quiz
show, was investigated in 1959 by a
grand jury for fraud, after which its
findings were sealed by a judge.
Goodwin, intrigued by this, began his
own investigation for the Congres
sional Subcommittee on Legislative
Oversight, hoping to expose the
ways in which networks deceived the
public.
The film attempts to focus on the be
hind-the-scenes manipulation of
Twenty-One's producer Dan Enright
(David Paymer) Enright, driven by the
power of advertising dollars and the
need to compete with other shows,
gives millions of people a "friend" in
Van Doren, someone they can watch
and cheer along with in their own
homes.
Priscilla
Imagine a man in his mid-twenties
exquisitely decked out in a long, flow
ing gown complemented by heels,
layers of make-up and a thirty foot
train.
Seat hirn on top of a giant, sparkling
high-heel stage prop perched atop a
metallic pink bus. Now picture the
whole scene in the Australian out
back.
This improbable, yet hilarious situa

tion is the premise of "The Adven
tures of Priscilla Queen of the Desert,"
an Australian film following the travels
of three Sydney drag queens from
the city to Alice Springs, a resort near
the center of the country.
Spanking the Monkey
"Spanking the Monkey" is a new film
about a rather old and serious
theme. This first movie from David
Russell powerfully captures a muggy
summer day exuding Oedipal ten
sion and most disturbing incest. The
film is both authentic and convincing
with a believable plot and true-to-life
dialogue.
This is not another one of those feel
good family films of the summer, but
a bittersweet slice of American life
that most would rather avoid.
True Lies
Like many of director James
Cameron's other films, "True Lies" is
an action film of mega-proportions.
From start to finish — with every
camera angle, special effect and
spray of bullets — the director re
minds us of his duty to elevate us
high above the cheap and thrilling
stomping grounds of Jean Claude
Van Damme and Keanu Reeves to a
T.N.T.-laced nirvana of sorts, where
only Sigourney Weaver, Linda
Hamilton, Arnold Schwarzenegger
and Ed Harris dare tread.

The Cathedral of the old city serves
as a backdrop along with brightly lit
boulevards replete with "Trade Fair
girls" for two American cousins. One,
Fred, an ROTC Navy man, and the
other Ted, a sincere and ardent yup
pie obsessed with the culture of
sales, embark on a quest for ro
mance
Fred may seem boorish and Ted in
sufferable, yet it is worth it to tag
along with them on their adventures
through "Barcelona " Stillman's cere
bral comedy perhaps mirrors his owr
search. He married a woman from
Barcelona and his two daughters
were born there.
Clear and Present Danger
Harrison Ford's newest movie, "Clea
and Present Danger" is yet another
ill-fated attempt to put Tom Clancy's
best-selling novels on screen. The
movie recounts the adventures of
Jack Ryan, acting CIA Director,
played by Ford in a continuation of
his role in "Patriot Games." The fail
ures of this blockbuster movie follow
Ford to Clancy's newest cinematic
attempt A poor script and poor and
obvious camera work plague this
otherwise intriguing flick.
"Clear and Present Danger" does
abound in shining comic moments.
Indeed, there are enough killer one
liners to fill an HBO special. One lin
ers. however, do not a movie make.

Neither does an outstanding star.
Though seven bucks would be a
waste, "Clear and Present Danger"
makes a great matinee.
Eat Drink Man Woman
Ang Lee, director of last year's inter
national success "The Wedding
Banquet," serves up a delectable
new comedy of food, fatherhood,
fornication and filial relations. "Eat
Drink Man Woman" is a gourmet af
fair — a hearty feast for your eyes.
Filled with an abundance of sensa
tional Chinese dishes, this romantic
yet rueful celebration of basic
human desires reduces "Like Watei
for Chocolate's" impassioned fies
tas to a traditional Weight Watcher's
meal plan.
"Eat Drink Man Woman" is a fulfilling
banquet, both entertaining and hear
warming. Go with a big appetite. Bor
Appetit!
Quiz Show
Following in the footsteps of Oliver
Stone's "Natural Born Killers," Quiz
Show also examines the power of
the media. While Quiz Show doesn
rally the American public behind vi
cious mass-murderers, it does rap
the knuckles of the manipulative
hands of network television execu
tives.
The film recreates many of the actua
events that entwined the lives of

btempel (played Dy John l urturro),
Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes)
and Richard Goodwin (Rob Morrow)
in the late 1950'5.
"Twenty-One," NBC's weekly quiz
show, was investigated in 1959 by a
grand jury for fraud, after which its
findings were sealed by a judge.
Goodwin, intrigued by this, began his
own investigation for the Congres
sional Subcommittee on Legislative
Oversight, hoping to expose the
ways in which networks deceived the
public.
The film attempts to focus on the be
hind-the-scenes manipulation of
Twenty-One's producer Dan Enright
(David Paymer) Enright, driven by the
power of advertising dollars and the
need to compete with other shows,
gives millions of people a "friend" in
Van Doren, someone they can watch
and cheer along with in their own
homes.
Priscilla
Imagine a man in his mid-twenties
exquisitely decked out in a long, flow
ing gown complemented by heels,
layers of make-up and a thirty foot
train.
Seat hirn on top of a giant, sparkling
high-heel stage prop perched atop a
metallic pink bus. Now picture the
whole scene in the Australian out
back.
This improbable, yet hilarious situa

tion is the premise of "The Adven
tures of Priscilla Queen of the Desert,"
an Australian film following the travels
of three Sydney drag queens from
the city to Alice Springs, a resort near
the center of the country.
Spanking the Monkey
"Spanking the Monkey" is a new film
about a rather old and serious
theme. This first movie from David
Russell powerfully captures a muggy
summer day exuding Oedipal ten
sion and most disturbing incest. The
film is both authentic and convincing
with a believable plot and true-to-life
dialogue.
This is not another one of those feel
good family films of the summer, but
a bittersweet slice of American life
that most would rather avoid.
True Lies
Like many of director James
Cameron's other films, "True Lies" is
an action film of mega-proportions.
From start to finish — with every
camera angle, special effect and
spray of bullets — the director re
minds us of his duty to elevate us
high above the cheap and thrilling
stomping grounds of Jean Claude
Van Damme and Keanu Reeves to a
T.N.T.-laced nirvana of sorts, where
only Sigourney Weaver, Linda
Hamilton, Arnold Schwarzenegger
and Ed Harris dare tread.
