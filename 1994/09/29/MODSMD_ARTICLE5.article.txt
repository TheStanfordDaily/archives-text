# Halston Prize-winner Havel will speak today at Frost
## 
### Jamie Taylor Staff writer 
The reason the Law School's presti
gious Jackson H. Ralston Prize is given
out so infrequently — just six times in the
last 22 years — is not necessarily a lack of
deserving recipients.
Sometimes it's just too difficult to get
the prize-winners to come to campus.
But this year, the University has suc
ceeded in bringing President Vaclav Havel
of the Czech Republic to campus to receive
the Ralston Prize, which recognizes those

who provide outstanding original contri
butions to the world of law and interna
tional relations. As the prize's sixth recip
ient, Havel will be speaking today at 2:30
p.m. in Frost Amphitheater. He will be
speaking on civilization in the context of
contemporary politics, said Connie Helly
er, the communications director for Stan
ford Law School.
Finding someone who is able to come to
Stanford to receive the prize is difficult,
said Stanford Law School Dean Paul
Brest. Two years ago, the Law School
awarded Nelson Mandela the prize for his

efforts in the struggle for human rights,
only to discover that he was unable to
come to campus for a speech.
"Having somebody with [Havel's]
background, achievement and stature can
be an inspiration to those who work and
teach at Stanford," Brest said.
Over 5,000 tickets have been distrib
uted for the lecture. Joan Baez, a folk
singer and human rights activist will per
form before Havel begins his speech. Baez
and Havel have been close friends since
both participated in the Prague Spring
protest in 1968.

"His committment to individual free
dom, which began when he was a writer in
the 19605, and his willingness to stick his
neck out, even be imprisoned for his be
liefs, make Havel a perfect Ralston win
ner," Brest said.
Havel, whose award-winning plays
were banned by the communist Czech
government, began to protest governmen
tal censorship and promote democracy in
the late 19605.
He continued his political activism
throughout the 1960s and 19705. Czecho
slovakia's communist regime imprisoned

Havel numerous times for his open criti
cism, most recently from January to May,
1989.
As a political activist, Havel wrote plays
describing the struggle for individual free
dom, including "Temptation" and "Slum
Clearance." His continued political resis
tance to communism helped bring aboilt
the end of communist rule in Czechoslo
vakia, and in 1993, Havel was elected the
first president of the Czech Republic.
Recipients of the Ralston Prize are cho-
sen through a recommendation
made by the dean of the law
school to University President
Gerhard Casper, who then refers

it to the chief justice of the Cali
fornia Supreme Court and the
secretary general of the United
Nations.
Havel's endorsement came
from a Law School committee
chaired by Law Prof. Lawrence
Friedman.
Since its establishment in

1972, the Ralston Prize has been
awarded to such people as Tommy
Koh, ambassador to Singapore,
former President Oscar Arias of
Costa Rica, Prime Minister Pierre
Trudeau of Canada, Sweden's for
mer Prime Minister Olaf Palme,
and former President Jimmy
Carter.
