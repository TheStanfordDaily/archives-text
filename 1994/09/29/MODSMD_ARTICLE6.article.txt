# Taking a chance
## Walk-ins must sign housing contracts with few facts about their new homes 
### Beth Berselli Senior staff writer 
The Housing Center doled out
more than 100 walk-in housing
assignments last night for a vari
ety of residences, ranging from
four-class dorms to row houses
and co-operatives.
But some students left disap
pointed, frustrated by the Hous
ing Center's refusal to release
which rooms in a given residence
are available until after binding
contractual papers are signed.
At last night's meeting to as
sign walk-in housing spaces,
Housing Center Director Bill
Georges warned students not to
expect too much about their fu
ture room and roommate — with
out releasing any specifics.
"You should assume the worst
in accepting your housing assign
ment," Georges told about 120
undergraduate and graduate stu
dents who showed up at Tresid
der's Oak Lounge West.
"If there's a quad in the dorm,
chances are you'll get it," Georges
said. "If you're in a one-bedroom

apartment in Escondido Village,
you may end up sleeping in the liv
ing-room."
The walk-in option is available
for students who failed to receive
an assignment from the housing
wait list or who just recently ap
plied for on-campus housing.
Georges also warned students
last night that once they accept an
assignment, they are under a legal
contract and must pay rent until
the end of the year.
"So you can't accept your as
signment tonight and then decide
tomorrow that you don't want the
room," he said, stressing that stu
dents are not obligated to take a
space now and can instead join the
wait list for winter quarter hous
ing.
Students receiving assign
ments had mixed feelings about
the results.
Seniors Aaron Hallmark and
Ken Johnson said they were
happy about their housing assign
ment. The two students — who
drew together unguaranteed last
year, went unassigned and then
failed to receive an assignment off
the waiting list — placed into Pot
ter.
"It actually worked out pretty
well for us, hut that probably won't
be the case for anyone else in
there," I lallmark said. "For a lot of
people in there, it will be a much
more detrimental situation."
Anthropology graduate stu
dent I/ok Siu said she wasn't sat
isfied with her housing options.
Siu walked out of last night's
meeting because she didn't want
any of the spots available.
"All they had left was shared
housing," she said. "I really don't
feel like living in a living-room."
Siu added that for now she'll
continue to commute from her
Berkeley home, but she plans to
look for off-campus housing soon.
Some students were also con
cerned because they were not
given any information about their
future room or roommates when

assigned to walk-in spaces.
Senior Sylvia Chen, who got
into Kimball Hall, admitted it
would be helpful to know what
kind of room she will have.
Georges said that the Housing
Center can't give out the infor
mation because it does not make
the specific room assignments.
Rather, the individual residence
office or the Row Office does.
"It's the same process for the
draw," he said. "Students apply
for housing not knowing what
kind of room they'll get."
In the past, students have gone
to residences before assignments
are made to try and determine
which rooms are vacant.
Senior Evan Shin, a resident
assistant for Schiff House in Ster
ling Quad, said he has received a
number of questions about the
available rooms in the house, but
he didn't notice any potential res
idents checking out the vacant
rooms.
Chen also said that the Hous
ing Center didn't make any effort
to inform unassigned students
about their options.

"They didn't send you any
thing in the mail to let you know
what to do," she said. "I had to go
to the Housing Center and ask
what to do."
Fifty-two undergraduate
males attended last night's meet
ing to apply for 55 available
spaces, while 31 undergraduate
females sought one of the 37
available spots.
Serra House in Stern Hall and
Ujamaa House in Lagunita Court
had the most openings with 11
spaces each. Walk-in students
will move into their residences
today.
Male graduate students, how
ever, were not as lucky. Twenty
six male graduate students
fought for the 13 available spots.
Six females waited to claim one of
the eight available spots.
During the first round of walk
ins last week, 89 graduate stu
dents received housing assign
ments. Additional spaces may
open up for the unassigned grad
uate male students, Georges said,
adding that fall quarter housing
will be assigned until Nov. 11.

future room or roommates when

assigned to walk-in spaces.
Senior Sylvia Chen, who got
into Kimball Hall, admitted it
would be helpful to know what
kind of room she will have.
Georges said that the Housing
Center can't give out the infor
mation because it does not make
the specific room assignments.
Rather, the individual residence
office or the Row Office does.
"It's the same process for the
draw," he said. "Students apply
for housing not knowing what
kind of room they'll get."
In the past, students have gone
to residences before assignments
are made to try and determine
which rooms are vacant.
Senior Evan Shin, a resident
assistant for Schiff House in Ster
ling Quad, said he has received a
number of questions about the
available rooms in the house, but
he didn't notice any potential res
idents checking out the vacant
rooms.
Chen also said that the Hous
ing Center didn't make any effort
to inform unassigned students
about their options.

"They didn't send you any
thing in the mail to let you know
what to do," she said. "I had to go
to the Housing Center and ask
what to do."
Fifty-two undergraduate
males attended last night's meet
ing to apply for 55 available
spaces, while 31 undergraduate
females sought one of the 37
available spots.
Serra House in Stern Hall and
Ujamaa House in Lagunita Court
had the most openings with 11
spaces each. Walk-in students
will move into their residences
today.
Male graduate students, how
ever, were not as lucky. Twenty
six male graduate students
fought for the 13 available spots.
Six females waited to claim one of
the eight available spots.
During the first round of walk
ins last week, 89 graduate stu
dents received housing assign
ments. Additional spaces may
open up for the unassigned grad
uate male students, Georges said,
adding that fall quarter housing
will be assigned until Nov. 11.
