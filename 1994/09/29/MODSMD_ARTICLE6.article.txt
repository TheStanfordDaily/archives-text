# Taking a chance
## Walk-ins must sign housing contracts with few facts about their new homes 
### Beth Berselli Senior staff writer 
The Housing Center doled out
more than 100 walk-in housing
assignments last night for a vari
ety of residences, ranging from
four-class dorms to row houses
and co-operatives.
But some students left disap
pointed, frustrated by the Hous
ing Center's refusal to release
which rooms in a given residence
are available until after binding
contractual papers are signed.
At last night's meeting to as
sign walk-in housing spaces,
Housing Center Director Bill
Georges warned students not to
expect too much about their fu

out releasing any specifics.
"You should assume the worst
in accepting your housing assign

undergraduate and graduate stu
dents who showed up at Tresid
der's Oak Lounge West.
"If there's a quad in the dorm,
chances are you'll get it," Georges
said. "If you're in a one-bedroom

apartment in Escondido Village,
you may end up sleeping in the liv
ing-room."
The walk-in option is available
for students who failed to receive
an assignment from the housing
wait list or who just recently ap
plied for on-campus housing.
Georges also warned students
last night that once they accept an
assignment, they are under a legal
contract and must pay rent until
the end of the year.
"So you can't accept your as
signment tonight and then decide
tomorrow that you don't want the
room," he said, stressing that stu
dents are not obligated to take a
space now and can instead join the
wait list for winter quarter hous
ing.
Students receiving assign
ments had mixed feelings about
the results.
Seniors Aaron Hallmark and
Ken Johnson said they were
happy about their housing assign
ment. The two students — who
drew together unguaranteed last
year, went unassigned and then
