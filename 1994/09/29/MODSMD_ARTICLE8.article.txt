# De La Soul to perform on campus
## 
### Frank Guinan Staff writer 
Continuing its trend of bring
ing big-name music groups to
campus, the Stanford Concert
Network has just booked the hip
hop group De La Soul for a per
formance here next month.
De La Soul — scheduled to ap
pear at Dinkelspiel Auditorium
on Oct. 15 — is currently on tour
and will be part of a three-hour
show sponsored by the Concert
Network, the Black Community
Services Center and KZSU.
"I can't tell you how excited
we all are. ... We get really fired
up everytime we talk about it,"
said graduate student Bryan
Perez, director of Concert Net
work.
In addition to De La Soul, two
opening acts and a disc jockey are
scheduled for the show at Dinkel
spiel. Although plans for the first
act are not yet finalized, the jazz
group Alphabet Soup is set to per
form during the second act, while
DJ Kevvy Kev from KZSU will
entertain the audience between
the acts.
Tickets for students go on sale
at the Tresidder Ticket Office at
10 a.m. tomorrow, and Perez said
he expects the show to sell out on
campus over the weekend.
"Our goal really is to create a
community event for the stu
dents, by the students," Perez
said, adding that working with
other groups on campus should
help "raise multicultural aware
ness . .. [and] appeal to all the
students."
Blair Bowman, the BCSC's
interim director, said the center is

helping to plan and organize the
event, and trying to get support
from dorms and other student
groups.
Concert Network Promotion
Manager Michael Cohen said
there is a definite push to make
the show exclusive to the Stan
ford community.
"It should be a major student
event," Cohen said. "We're defi
nitely very excited to land a big
name group and to co-sponsor
the event with other student
groups."
The show will be held Dinkel
spiel, where folk singer Shawn
Colvin performed last year.
"We like Dinkelspiel," Cohen
said. "It's got a lot of character
and is very classy."
Although some acts can take
months to schedule, Perez said he
spent only three days negotiating
the arrangement with De La Soul,

one of the "fastest deals" he ever
made.
Ticket prices for students are
$14.50, down from the original
price of $15. "We had some more
room [in our budget] and wanted
to keep prices as low as possible,"
Perez said.
The Concert Network may
decide to sell tickets to the gener
al public starting next week.
Cohen said, however, that if tick
ets were sold to the general pub
lic, prices would be $2 more than
the student cost.
Over the past few years, the
Concert Network has brought to
campus popular musicians such
as Branford Marsalis, Cowboy
Junkies, Shawn Colvin and They
Might Be Giants.
This year, the student organiza
tion is "tiying to get alternative
acts currently on tour," Cohen
said.
