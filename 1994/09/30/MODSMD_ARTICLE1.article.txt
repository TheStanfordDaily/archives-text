# EV standards leave dwellers in filth, angry

Graduate student Janice Strong has not cooked
anything in her oven since she moved into her Escon
dido Village apartment two weeks ago — the oven is
too dirty.
When she moved in, she was told that it had been
cleaned and inspected. But what she found showed
otherwise — a broken, dirty oven, urine on the bath
room floor, stained bathroom walls, broken lights
and missing curtains.
"I lifted my little girl up to show her the grease on
the top of the fridge and she said, 'Oh my god.' ... It
seems so unhealthy to live in here," Strong said.
Though not all apartments are in substandard
condition, several graduate students, including
Strong, have recently moved into dirty and unmain
tained apartments in Escondido, and have spent
their first few weeks cleaning instead of preparing for
class.
Glenn Carroll, manager of apartment facilities for
Housing and Dining Services, however, said that he
was unaware that there were apartments in this con
dition passing inspection.
"From the reports we have been getting, we think
that we are turning out clean apartments," Carroll
said. "If these things are occurring, that would be un
fortunate and I would like to follow up the details to
how it happened."
Typically, residents are expected to clean their
apartments before they leave. Members of the hous
ing staff then inspect the units and charge for any
damages. Finally, apartments are professionally
cleaned and inspected again before the next family
moves in.
But Amber McLain, a former resident assistant at
Escondido, said that she has continued to witness
students moving into "dilapidated dumps" since she
moved in five years ago.
This week she started a flier campaign urging new
residents to complain if their apartments are in such
poor conditions. "Stanford is such a prestigious uni
versity, and they are letting people move into places
in this condition, and I'm sick of seeing it happen
time and time again," McLain said.
Once people complained enough, she said, the
problems were eventually corrected by Escondido
maintenance. However many residents said they
don't complain because they think that since the
apartment has already been inspected, nothing else
would be done.
"These apartments had supposedly passed inspec
tion," McLain said. "If the [tenants] had not com
plained they would have had to live in them as they
were and that's what makes me really mad."
Already many have responded to McLain's fliers,
including graduate student Don Matheson, who ar-
rived two weeks ago with his wife
and five-week-old baby.
Matheson decided to arrive
early because he said he had
heard "some bad stories" about
Escondido from colleagues at
work who had previously taken
courses at Stanford, he said.
He has only just now gotten
the apartment into a "livable
state," after spending about 30
hours gluing back loose asbestos
tiles, cleaning mildew from the
bath and making the kitchen
countertop "half-decent," he said.
"I planned for the worst — if I
had shown up a day before class it
would have been a disaster,"
Matheson said.
Matheson Filled in the "fix-it"
forms that Escondido mainte
nance provide but decided to fix
the things himself because he
"sensed it would be a while."
No one has come to fix any
thing yet, Matheson said, but
added that an exterminator did
come to deal with an ant problem
a week after he informed Escon
dido about it.
Carroll admitted that there is
a large back log of work orders at
the moment — one reason why
there is a delay in attending to
repairs.
Director of graduate resi

dences Chris Griffith said that
she is surprised to hear that stu
dents are moving into apart
ments that are in such poor con
dition. "I'm just not hearing that
it's happening . . . it's certainly
our goal not to have that hap
pen," she said.
But Griffith said she "feeis
good" that Escondido has done a
lot over the past year to reduce
the problem.
Even so, McLain said she will
continue to distribute the fliers in
hope that the responses will bring
about some "major changes" in
Escondido and "will force people
in higher positions to be aware of
what's happening," she said.

Dirty bathrooms are just a few of
the problems Escondido Village
residents face as they move in.
