# Stanford may help open E. Palo Alto clinic
## 
### Justin Pollard Staff writer 
Two Stanford health organizations may
join forces with the East Palo Alto-based
Drew Health Foundation to open a new clin
ic in East Palo Alto in the near future.
The newly formed Stanford Health Ser
vices and Lucile Salter Packard Children's
Hospital have begun "broad discussions
[with Drew] of how we all might work
together more effectively to meet the needs
of East Palo Alto," said Peter Van Etten,
president of SHS.
The group is currently exploring the feasi
bility of a new clinic, and Van Etten said he
expects it to achieve substantial progress
within a few months.
Under the proposed plan, Drew's existing
clinic would be replaced by a larger facility
which could serve 35,000 patients a year.
Officials say the $7 million clinic would
better serve the residents of East Palo Alto
and would also alleviate the burden on Stan
ford emergency rooms and clinics. They are

unsure of where the money would come
from, but are seeking both public and private
funding sources.
The Drew Health Foundation is a federal
ly funded health clinic in East Palo Alto
which provides primary care to 23,000
patients a year.
The clinic serves patients covered by Med
icaid, Medicare and private insurance com
panies, and also offers free health care to
uninsured patients, according to Dana Knoll,
operations director for Drew.
Many uninsured East Palo Alto residents
also come to Stanford to receive primary
care.
"By bringing this clinic to their commu
nity, we can do a much better job of taking
care of them," said Shelley Hebert, commu
nications director for the Children's Hospi
tal.
"Families without health insurance use
our emergency room for primary care,"
Hebert said. "That's not what emergency
rooms are meant for." In addition, she said
the new clinic would reduce unnecessary

trips to the emergency room.
Anticipated health care reform is another
reason for the alliance between the three
organizations, Hebert said. "In the changing
health-care environment, greater emphasis
is being placed on primary care.
"We have learned that it makes better
economic sense to keep people healthy" than
to treat their illnesses in emergency rooms,
she added.
Stanford Health Services is the product
of a review of all health services provided
by the University which was ordered by
University President Gerhard Casper. The
management group will oversee the merger
of Stanford Hospital and the clinics for
merly operated under the School of
Medicine.
Last February, Stanford Hospital and the
Children's Hospital started negotiations
with Palo Alto city officials to discuss plans
for expansion. At the time, hospital officials
said they hoped to expand their outpatient
services in an effort to comply with expected
health care reform.
