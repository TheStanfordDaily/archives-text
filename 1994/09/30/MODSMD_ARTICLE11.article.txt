First lady on health care
WASHINGTON (AP) - Hillary Rodham
Clinton, in an emotional address to medical
students, promised yesterday not to give up
the fight for universal health coverage.
"We've had some rough spots on the
road, but this journey is far from over," she
told future physicians at the George Wash
ington University School of Medicine.
"The future of this country, not just our
health care system, depends upon us con
tinuing our journey toward universal cover
age," she said in her first extended com
ments since Monday's declaration by
Democratic leaders that health reform was
dead for the year.
Mrs. Clinton was an architect and chief
saleswoman for her husband's plan to over
haul the country's health system. Critics
called it too big, too bureaucratic and too

costly. The White House lost the battle to
salvage its main feature, mandatory insur
ance contributions by all employers.
Estonia ferry still missing
TURKU, Finland (AP) — Salvage work
ers using sophisticated electronic equipment
scoured the Baltic Sea for the wreck of the
Estonia without success yesterday, as the
death toll from the ferry disaster topped 900.
Swedish and Finnish maritime officials
ordered inspections of all their ferries for
bow door problems similar to that reported
by a surviving crew member, who said water
rushed in through the door of the cargo hold.
Bjorn Erik Stenmark, Sweden's mar
itime safety director, said that since the acci
dent, shipping companies had been telling
him they had experienced similar problems
in the past but had not reported them.
