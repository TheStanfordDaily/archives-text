PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -
In an bloody attack on the U.S.-
orchestrated return to elected rule, a
grenade exploded yesterday in front of
a pro-democracy demonstration,
killing three Haitians and wounding
at least 31.
Hundreds of people fled in panic,
leaving the dead and injured in a cir
cle on the ground. U.S. soldiers and
military police who sped in to investi
gate detained three men after firing
more than 200 rounds into a ware
house.
But after they left, chaos reigned.
Hundreds of Haitians looted the
building of bags of cement, wooden
pallets for fuel, even iron bars pulled
from the foundation and windows
ripped from their frames.
Survivors wailed along the dusty
stretch of seaside Harry Truman

Boulevard.
"Are we never going to stop dying?
Are we never going to stop suffering?"
cried a 26-year-old woman, looking at
the wounded. She identified herself
only as Jesula.
One American soldier cradled a
seriously wounded Haitian man,
yelling: "Hang on, buddy! Hang on,
buddy!"
The U.S. military counted 40 casu
alties, but did not offer a breakdown
of dead and wounded. There were no
reports of any American casualties.
Among the injured were four chil
dren, including a 9-year-old boy.
The Associated Press and Red
Cross officials counted three dead at
the scene. General Hospital posted a
list of 31 wounded from the blast, but
a local radio reporter who was inside
the hospital said he counted 48 and

had a list of names.
The violence may complicate
efforts to ensure a peaceful transition
between army coup leaders and demo
cratically elected President Jean-.
Bertrand Aristide.
Angry chants of "Cedras has to
leave!" arose after the explosion,
referring to army chief Raoul Cedras,
who has agreed to step down by Oct.
15. "We are not going to wait for Oct.
15!" people shouted.
There was no immediate claim of
responsibility, but marchers widely
blamed pro-army gunmen who have
slain thousands in political violence
since soldiers deposed Aristide three
years ago Thursday. Many grenades
are known to be in private hands, and
disarmament has been a priority of
American soldiers seeking to aid the
transition to democracy.
