'Gay Liberation' crime
shows that Calif, hate
statute is incomplete

THE "GAY LIBERATION"
sculpture was reinstalled on
campus a week ago today,
without fanfare or ceremony. Its
quiet return was not marked by
passionate pleas for tolerance, but
rather by a tranquil blanket of rain.
The sculpture's defacement last
spring — allegedly by six Stanford
students — continues to make noise
in local news. Two prominent attor
neys — Santa Clara County Deputy
District Attorney Karyn Sinunu and
San Jose gay rights attorney Bruce
Nickerson — are now using the case
to push for a change in California's
hate crime law.
Sinunu and Nickerson have pro
posed that the current law be broad
ened to include acts intended to
intimidate a group of people. At pre
sent, the law is applicable only to
cases involving an individual or an
individual's personal property.
This proposed change is logical
and much needed.
In particular, the modification
would allow hate-motivated vandal
ism of public property to be designat
ed a hate crime. Surprisingly, this
possibility does not currently exist.
California law stipulates that "no
person . . . shall knowingly deface,
damage or destroy the real or per
sonal property of any other person"
for reasons related to the other per
son's "race, color, religion, ancestry,
national origin, disability, gender or
sexual orientation."
The hate crimes statute increases
the punishment handed down in
cases which violate this law.
For the same reasons that the
hate crime statute applies in this
case — reasons which are ultimately
tied to the U.S. Constitution — a
similar statute should apply in cases
which infringe upon the rights of a
general group of people.

How can the vandalism of public
property violate the right of a group of
people? Simply put, when a public
monument of importance to a certain
community is vandalized because of
what it represents, the crime is an
attack on that community.
So long as a public monument is
not intended to incite violence or
hatred, its existence does not
infringe on the rights of others. A
hate-motivated attack on such a
monument should be punishable
under the same terms that an identi
cal attack on private property could
be punished.
The statute, therefore, should be
reworded to broaden its scope.
Lawmakers, however, must avoid
drafting a statute so broad that it
could encompass acts other than
hate-related crimes.
Current hate crime law requires
"proof of specific intent to deprive
[an] individual of [rights] secured by
federal or state law." This type of
specificity must be equally applied to
public property crimes, which are
often more vague in motive.
Last spring's vandalism of the
"Gay Liberation" sculpture repre
sents this problem succinctly. Pros
ecutors say the six accused students
were involved in varying degrees,
meaning that the hate crime law —
if it did in fact relate to this case —
would not apply to all of them
equally.
Police have claimed that senior
Thomas Irwin and former student
Todd Laßocca were the main cul
prits, and therefore have charged the
two with felonies, while only charg
ing the other four students with mis
demeanors.
If found guilty, Irwin and Laßocca
should also be charged with hate
crimes. Police have alleged that they
were the two who smeared the sculp
ture with paint. Furthermore, at the
time of arrest police claim Laßocca
said he felt offended by the sculp
ture.

Until the law is changed to include
such actions under the hate crime
statute, California law will remain
sadly incomplete.
