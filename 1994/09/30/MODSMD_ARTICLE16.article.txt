## Jerry Chen Measuring standards: inches and centimeters 
### 
I'VE RECENTLY
LEARNED that
The Stanford Daily
charges $10.70 per
column inch to place
an advertisement, and
since I've gotten all
this space for free I
figure I should find
out exactly how much

I'm getting. Now a column inch isn't a
square inch or even 2 inches by 1 inch,
it's exactly 2 1-16 inches by 1 inch.
Exactly. Really, go ahead and measure
it.
Then again, I don't measure things
in column inches, so if I looked at this
column, I'd say it were 8 inches wide
and 5 1/2 inches high, Scott the Daily
advertising guy would say it was 16 1/2
column inches and if you were from
almost any country other than the
United States, you would say this col
umn was about 20 centimeters by 14
centimeters. Who's right? Or more
importantly, who's wrong?
Unfortunately, we're all raised to
make sure we're not the one in the
wrong. When my mom found the
kitchen window broken, "I didn't do
it." When my dad found the dent in the
car, "I didn't do it." When my tuition
check bounced, "I certainly didn't do
it."
But as a result of this wrong vs.

right mentality, we end up criticizing
people who measure things differently
than we do. So who's to say that the
guy who looks at this column and says,
"Yep, definitely 8 inches by 5 inches" ,"
is wrong, or that the guy who says,
"Yep, 20 centimeters by 14 centime
ters," is wrong or even the guy who
looks at this column and says, "Yep,
just big enough to line the bottom of
my bird cage," is wrong? No one is.
We've just accepted the inch as the
standard, the dollar as the norm, and
even Food Service as acceptable. We
accept a lot things without questioning
them first. Instead of asking, "Does
this measure up to standards," try, "Is
this the best standard?"
We all measure things in different
ways, we all look at different things in
different ways. If you look up at the
left corner of this column, you would
hopefully see a pleasant, well-adjusted
young man, or if you were a professor
of mine, hopefully you would see a
promising student with a bright future
after Stanford, or if you still need a
date for Screw-Your-Sib, well there you
go-
On the other hand, you could iuok at
my picture and say, he's Asian Ameri
can. What does that mean? I mean how
Asian am I, and how American am I?
Well, measure it. You can't. If you ask
my mom, she'd say I was more Asian,

and If you ask my Chinese 1 teacher,
she'd say I was way, way too American.
Who's right? How do you judge some
thing you can't measure?
I for one could never measure a
thing, which would probably explain
that C-f in wood shop back in the sev
enth grade. You may see a table with
four uneven legs, but I see a cross
between a coffee table and a rocking
chair.
You may look at Asian American
Studies and say, "Looks like a table
with one leg too short, useless," but I
see a new kind of table, a piece of furni
ture that every home can't do without,
sort of like a toaster oven.
You can't measure everything with
the same tape measure, and you can't
judge everything with the same stan
dard. Part of growing and maturing is
learning to see things in a different
light. If you never try to see things in a
different light, you'll end up in the
dark.
Never judge a person, a major, or a
piece of furniture, or even Food Service
until you've tried using a different tape
measure. There will be a community
meeting looking at Asian American
Studies Tuesday night. Come, and
leave your old rulers behind.
