Prof, clarifies views regarding Asian Americans

WHEN I ARRIVED to teach the
first class of Political Science
35, the entrances to Kresge
Auditorium were posted witn a flyer
with the following head:
"Do you know who is teaching your
class? Krasner's Anti-Asian Agenda." It
went on to elaborate on my supposedly
racist views and closed with the follow
ing exhortation: "Boycott Krasner."
At a meeting of the Academic Senate
last year, I made the observation that in
comparison with the population as a

whole, Jewish and Asian Americans
were overrepresented and that white
Christians were, again in comparison
with the United States population, the
most underrepresented group at Stan
ford.
It is a sad comment on the state of
discourse at Stanford that some stu
dents could have taken my remarks as a
criticism of the number of Asian Ameri
cans at Stanford. I am tempted to sug
gest that my critics read Jonathan
Swift, but I am afraid that in this
instance irony is too subtle a rhetorical

strategy.
So let me make my views on the
number of Asian Americans clear. The
high percentage of Asian Americans at
Stanford is great. It is a testimony to
what happens when America works at
its best. Individual achievement is
rewarded. Ascriptive characteristics like
ethnic identity are irrelevant. If the per
centage of Asian American students or
faculty or administrators was 40 per
cent or 60 percent or 90 percent, I for
one would applaud these individuals
and all the rest of us as well for sustain

ing the only multi-ethnic society in the
world that more or less works.
One of the questions the flyer raises
is: "Where were he and others for near
ly a century when whites were signifi
cantly 'overrepresented' among Stan
ford undergraduates?" Well, one of the
places I was was sitting in the Yale Uni
versity admissions office in 1959, being
told pretty directly that since I was a
Jew I would not be moving to New
Haven.
