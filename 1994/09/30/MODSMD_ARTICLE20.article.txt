# Next week, cable TV at a dorm near you
## 
### Cynthia Yu Staff writer 
Cable TV will premiere early next week in
selected campus residences in a new pilot pro
ject called Stanford Television, or STV.
STV will provide students living in the res
idences the opportunity to purchase basic
cable television programming, including
CNN, ESPN and MTV for $20 per month.
Students can also get premium channels such
as HBO and Cinemax for an added $9.50 per
month each.
"Basically, [Communication Services! is
running the pilot to see how well the program
is accepted by students and then how quickly
to expand to other residences," said Director
of Housing and Dining Services Keith Guy .
So far, Networking and Communication
Services has targeted Florence Moore Hall,
McFarland and Escondido Village buildings
88 and 116 for the pilot program. As with
phone service, the University will provide

STV to all students in these residences for the
first week. Afterward, the service will contin
ue only for students who subscribe to STV.
The new program is part of Network and
Communication Services' plan to reorganize
the old SUNet video system into three cate
gories: SUNet Academic, SUNet Residential
and STV.
The indirect impact that STV will have on
SUNet Residential — available in all resi
dences on campus — is that SUNet Residen
tial will no longer provide CNN or C-SPAN
because the University cannot afford to sub
sidize reception of these channels with the
increasing number of residential connections,
said Assistant Director of Communication
Services Maureen Trimm.
"SUNet Residential will continue to air
academic programming that is not charged by
the provider," Trimm said. "Anything that is
charged will be moved over to the STV side of
SUNet."
Campus libraries, however, will continue

to carry SUNet Academic, which still includes
both CNN and C-SPAN.
The proposal for STV came from a gener
al interest" survey last summer. Many stu
dents responded positively, according to
Trimm. But plans for expanding SIV to all
campus residences are still up in the air.
"There isn't a timetable yet because its a
pilot project," Trimm said. We plan to get
opinions as to what's happening ... whether
or not students are pleased with the service as
well as why students who are not subscribing
aren't." .
Trimm also added that they will begin to
survey students about 30 days after the pilot
program is installed. The program will con
tinue "at least through fall quarter, so we can
get an idea of what level of interest is there,
she said.
In the meantime, she said, students can
tune in to channel 23 for more up-to-date
information regarding SIV and the new
SUNet video system.
