## Cardinal to face Irish in emotional, physical battle A 						three-peat at South Bend? 
### Greg Collins Staff writer 
Still sorting through the damage done by Ari
zona last Saturday, Stanford now finds itself
facing its first major test of team unity and
strength as it travels to Notre Dame this week
end.
Comments made by sophomores Scott Frost
and Eliel Swinton, and an emotionally-charged
outburst by freshman Anthony Bookman, have
some members of the team questioning the
enthusiasm and direction of the team. What
may be more intriguing than the actual com
ments is the fact that they are coming from
some of the youngest players on the team, sug
gesting a shift in leadership.
"We've got to stop acting like Stanford
babies. We've got to be men," Bookman erupted
at practice Monday, echoing claims made by
Frost after the 34-10 defeat at the hands of Ari
zona that the team lost all emotion after falling
behind quickly. Agreeing with both players,
Swinton commented on how he wished he had
spoken up last year as a freshman when he saw
the same things happening.
However, head coach Bill Walsh did not seem
disappointed with the emotional level of his
players.
"I have no question or quarrel with the atti
tude of our athletes and our intensity," he said.
If this is the beginning of a challenge of team
leadership, the Cardinal (1-1-1) picked a bad
week as it must prepare to face No. 8 Notre
Dame (3-1). While the Cardinal has had success
at South Bend, winning the last two contests
there, few members of this year's team played
roles in either of the victories. Almost half of
Stanford's 22 regular starters are sophomores
or freshmen, but Walsh doesn't think the
team's inexperience will affect its play.
"We've played with poise at South Bend,
with determination," he said. "I don't think
we'll come unraveled at Notre Dame."
The Notre Dame-Stanford rivalry has devel
oped into a high point in both teams' seasons. In
1990, the unranked Cardinal upset then-No. 1
Notre Dame 36-31 behind the bludgeoning force
of four one-yard touchdown runs by Tommy
Vardell. Stanford again ventured into South
Bend in 1992 and walked away with a 33-16 vic
tory by scoring 33 unanswered points, handing
Notre Dame their only loss of the 1992 season.
The Fightin' Irish have repaid each favor
when they returned to the Farm, topping Stan
ford 42-26 in 1991 and 48-20 last year. After
this year's game, the series takes a two-year hia
tus before returning to action in 1997 and con
tinuing indefinitely.
As if the questioning of the team's character
'is not enough, Stanford also has some uncer

tainties in the injury department. Walsh said he
expects sophomores Quincy Jacobs and Adam
Salina and senior T.J. Gaynor to be at "100 per
cent form," which should help revitalize a run
ning attack that could be key to Stanford's suc
cess against the Irish. Sophomore Mike Mitchell
is listed as day-to-day and has not been practic
ing full speed, but Walsh expects him to be ready
by Saturday.
On the defensive side of the ball, freshman
Kailee Wong should be back but junior Pete
Swanson, who suffered a sprained left knee
against Arizona, will be out for 4 to 6 weeks.

The defense also gains the services of
linebacker Jason White, who returns from a
three-game suspension stemming from his
alleged involvement in the vandalism of the Gay
Liberation statue last spring. White, a junior,
gives the Cardinal more punch up front with his
speed and pass-rushing abilities, as well as his
experience.
Not all is dim on the Cardinal horizons.
Notre Dame has its share of injury problems, as
starting tailback Lee Becton is questionable for
the game due to a groin pull he suffered against

Dame. A sign of things to come?
Michigan State two weeks ago.
Randy Kinder has filled Becton's
shoes in the last two games, record
ing back-to-back 100-yard days.
"Notre Dame's really made an
effort to get their running game
going," Walsh said. "They're get
ting the most out of their backs,
and their offensive line has just
been outstanding."
That line has dominated other
teams, boosting Irish rushers to an
average of 255.8 yards per game.
This typical reliance on the run
ning game for Notre Dame has
given sophomore quarterback Ron
Powlus time to develop while guid
ing the Irish offense. Like any first
year player, Powlus has had his
share of highs and lows. Following
his 18-for-24, 291-yard perfor
mance against Northwestern, he
struggled against Michigan, going
10-for-30 for 161 yards and throw
ing four interceptions.
"They have excellent balance in
their football," Walsh said. "That is
part coaching and part talent, so
they are not about to do any
grievous gambling and do anything
foolish on the field."

zona that the team lost all emotion after falling
behind quickly. Agreeing with both players,
Swinton commented on how he wished he had
spoken up last year as a freshman when he saw
the same things happening.
However, head coach Bill Walsh did not seem
disappointed with the emotional level of his
players.
"I have no question or quarrel with the atti
tude of our athletes and our intensity," he said.
If this is the beginning of a challenge of team
leadership, the Cardinal (1-1-1) picked a bad
week as it must prepare to face No. 8 Notre
Dame (3-1). While the Cardinal has had success
at South Bend, winning the last two contests
there, few members of this year's team played
roles in either of the victories. Almost half of
Stanford's 22 regular starters are sophomores
or freshmen, but Walsh doesn't think the
team's inexperience will affect its play.
"We've played with poise at South Bend,
with determination," he said. "I don't think
we'll come unraveled at Notre Dame."
The Notre Dame-Stanford rivalry has devel
oped into a high point in both teams' seasons. In
1990, the unranked Cardinal upset then-No. 1
Notre Dame 36-31 behind the bludgeoning force
of four one-yard touchdown runs by Tommy
Vardell. Stanford again ventured into South
Bend in 1992 and walked away with a 33-16 vic
tory by scoring 33 unanswered points, handing
Notre Dame their only loss of the 1992 season.
The Fightin' Irish have repaid each favor
when they returned to the Farm, topping Stan
ford 42-26 in 1991 and 48-20 last year. After
this year's game, the series takes a two-year hia
tus before returning to action in 1997 and con
tinuing indefinitely.
As if the questioning of the team's character
'is not enough, Stanford also has some uncer

tainties in the injury department. Walsh said he
expects sophomores Quincy Jacobs and Adam
Salina and senior T.J. Gaynor to be at "100 per
cent form," which should help revitalize a run
ning attack that could be key to Stanford's suc
cess against the Irish. Sophomore Mike Mitchell
is listed as day-to-day and has not been practic
ing full speed, but Walsh expects him to be ready
by Saturday.
On the defensive side of the ball, freshman
Kailee Wong should be back but junior Pete
Swanson, who suffered a sprained left knee
against Arizona, will be out for 4 to 6 weeks.

The defense also gains the services of
linebacker Jason White, who returns from a
three-game suspension stemming from his
alleged involvement in the vandalism of the Gay
Liberation statue last spring. White, a junior,
gives the Cardinal more punch up front with his
speed and pass-rushing abilities, as well as his
experience.
Not all is dim on the Cardinal horizons.
Notre Dame has its share of injury problems, as
starting tailback Lee Becton is questionable for
the game due to a groin pull he suffered against

Brian Manning charges ahead for the Cardinal in last year's home matchup against Notre
Dame. A sign of things to come?
Michigan State two weeks ago.
Randy Kinder has filled Becton's
shoes in the last two games, record
ing back-to-back 100-yard days.
"Notre Dame's really made an
effort to get their running game
going," Walsh said. "They're get
ting the most out of their backs,
and their offensive line has just
been outstanding."
That line has dominated other
teams, boosting Irish rushers to an
average of 255.8 yards per game.
This typical reliance on the run
ning game for Notre Dame has
given sophomore quarterback Ron
Powlus time to develop while guid
ing the Irish offense. Like any first
year player, Powlus has had his
share of highs and lows. Following
his 18-for-24, 291-yard perfor
mance against Northwestern, he
struggled against Michigan, going
10-for-30 for 161 yards and throw
ing four interceptions.
"They have excellent balance in
their football," Walsh said. "That is
part coaching and part talent, so
they are not about to do any
grievous gambling and do anything
foolish on the field."
