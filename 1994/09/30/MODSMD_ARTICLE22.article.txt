# One step...
## Spikers off to Oregon 
### Seth Goldstein Staff writer 
Looming on the horizon for
the No. 1 Stanford women's
volleyball team (9-0 overall, 3-0
in the Pacific 10 Conference)
are next weekend's monster
matches against the No. 4
UCLA Bruins and the No. 13
USC Trojans. However, as
always, first things first.
With just the slightest
glance towards the future, the
Cardinal women will travel
north to duel with Oregon
State tonight and Oregon
tomorrow night.
"I know it's sounds corny,
but we have to take it one step
at a time," said freshman set
ter-hitter Lisa Sharpley. "We
know those matches [UCLA
and USC] are important and
we'll be ready for them, but we
can't worry about that until it's
time."
The two Oregon schools
have not yet won a Pac-10
match, but that does not mean
they will be easy meat for the
Cardinal. The Beavers and
Ducks played well against Ari
zona and Arizona State at home
before falling, and while they
struggled this past weekend on
the road at Washington and
Washington State, according to
Stanford head coach Don Shaw,
"they will be comfortable
enough at home to cause prob
lems."
The Beavers (8-5, 0-4) were
ranked in the top 20 earlier in
the season until conference
play began. After an early loss
to No. 3 Nebraska, OSU won 22
of their next 23 games before
embarking upon the recent
four-match losing streak.
"They're a strong team,
solid all around," Shaw said,
"although we'll see less of their
left side attack than other parts
of their game."
Leading the Beavers, sopho
more middle blocker Staci
Hintze is hitting .391, good for

second in the conference only to
Stanford freshman Kristen
Folkl, along with 151 kills and
61 blocks. Senior Tanya Lifa,
also a middle blocker, has some
impressive numbers with 107
kills and 76 blocks.
What has hurt the Beavers
has been the slow start of
senior Shelly Smith, who has
made the transition from mid
dle blocker to right-side hitter
this season. Smith, Oregon
State's traditional go-to player,
still has Shaw on the cautious
side.
"She's a player who makes
me say wishfully, she's still
there? Shouldn't she have grad
uated two years ago?'," he said.
"They've had to rely on her a
lot during her four years there,
and it's a testimony to her skills
that they've done so."
Oregon (6-6, 0-4) was picked
to finish ninth in the Pac-10 in
a pre-season survey of confer
ence coaches. However, they
may be a surprise this season.
"They're a young team capa
ble of playing real well," said
Shaw. "Yes, they're 0-4, but
their coach has done a real good
job, because they're definitely
improving."
The Ducks' top player is
senior right-side hitter Angee
Henderson. Last week, she and
Folkl were the only two play
ers in the Pac-10 to appear in
the top ten of three statistical
categories. First year sopho
more middle blocker Bettina
Roth of Switzerland has also
contributed. The foreign
import has been cited as a pos
sible reason for the Ducks' sur
prising play.
"[Roth is] an extremely hard
worker," said Shaw. "She adds
a lot to the team's attitude and
chemistry."
Probable starters for the Car
dinal include senior blocker Anne
Wicks, junior setter Caiy Wen
dell, junior hitter Marnie Triefen
bach, freshman hitter Barbara
Ifejika, Sharpley and Folkl.
