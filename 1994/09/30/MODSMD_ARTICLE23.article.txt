# Nostra Demas
## Reagan Demas faces off with Fred Savage in this week's picks 
### 
We all adored him for his cute
smile, cherished him for his inno
cent voice, and envied him for his
sexy girlfriend. But .now, "The
Wonder Years" star and Stanford
freshman Fred Savage is getting
down to serious business.
He's picking the spreads with
me in the college football games
of the week:
Stanford at Notre Dame
It's the Mother Teresa vs.
George Foreman title bout of col
lege football. The Cardinal may
be the only team to have beaten
the Irish twice in South Bend in
the past decade, but no historical
gimmick-playing or wishing upon
a star can change the facts —
Stanford is reeling with injuries
after last week's Desert Swarm
and outmatched defensively.
If the Stanford squad of pre
season hype appears, this game
could be a decent one. If any
Notre Dame team at all shows
up, it'll be an old-fashioned lam
basting.
A Stanford victory would take
divine intervention; in fact, I'd
bet the farm that half of the Irish
starting squad is actually of the
Catholic faith before putting my
money on a Cardinal conquest.
Unable to publicly wager
against his own university, Fred
is taking a hyperbolic stance on
Saturday's match. "If the offen
sive line keeps the pressure off, I
can see Steve [Stenstrom] collect
ing a few thousand yards in the
air. That just might be enough."
He may not be exaggerating.

Without a ground attack, the
Cardinal will be armed only with
air assaults. And let's face it —
you don't need Norman
Schwarzkopf to tell you that it's
impossible to get it done solely
through the air.
Fred's loyalty to Stanford and
his tremendous popularity all but
force him to play the eternal opti
mist. Fortunately, as a worthless
and unknown cog in the machi
nations of this gargantuan uni
versity, I am under no such obli
gation.
Fred (saving face):
Stanford by 90
Reagan (without face):
Notre Dame by 35
Oregon at USC
We both despise the Trojan
self-love. Fred loves the way a
football loss takes "a bite out of
the SC ego." I love the way the
Coliseum parking lots are always
full of German and Italian luxury
automobiles during USC home
games.
I see this game as the Ducks'
big chance. The Trojans are
mediocre at best this year, with a
lucky win against Washington as
their only bright spot this season.
They squeaked by Baylor last
week, after their star running
back was suspended while ques
tions regarding the legitimacy of
his ACT score were addressed.
Besides, Coliseum fans still have
to wield weapons in defense to
exit the stadium and reach their


cars on the streets of south-central
Los Angeles alive.
It all sounds like Oregon's first
Southern California victory in
years to me. Fred makes the safer
bet.
Fred: USC by 10
Reagan: Oregon by 3
UCLA at Washington
Don't expect the seventh
ranked Huskies to come out with
their heads hung low. Just because
they are still under probation from
the NCAA powers-that-be, there
was no lolly-gagging involved in
their 38-20 plowing of Miami last
week.
Fred's days spent in southern
California might have lured his
faith into the abilities of the Bru
ins. Insisting that UCLA usually
"starts out slow," he's calling even
odds on this weekend's game.
Yet the Bruins, unranked in
this week's polls, have under
achieved for too long this time.
Last week's screw-up fest against
Washington State highlighted the

worst UCLA had to offer, includ
ing a lousy return from injury by
wide receiver J.J. Stokes.
As flat as the Bruins have been,
they were soundly booed out of the
Rose Bowl last week. And if South
ern California fans actually takj
their precious time and effort to
boo a team, then there are some
serious problems.
Fred: Even
Reagan: Washington by 14
Washington State at Ten
nessee
No question that the smart
money would have been on the
Volunteers at the beginning of the
season. But after a 1-3 start, the
Tennessee squad is unranked,
uninspiring, and about as unified
as the Rwandan national militia.
The Cougars, however, are
undefeated and ranked No. 17 in
the country. The defense has not
allowed a touchdown in 1994, and
their visit last week to UCLA
won't be the only game they play
in the Rose Bowl this year.
Fred: Tennessee by 3
Reagan: WSU by 7
Oregon State at Arizona
The betting line calls Arizona by 22

over the Beavers, but Fred disagrees.
After the Cardinal lost by 25 to the
Wildcats, he thinks that a spre- d of 22
on the game implies that "Oregon
State is better than [Stanford)."
Game day is October 22 in Cor
vallis — may the best of the worst
win. Until then, may the worst be
the best at continuing to lose.
Fred: Arizona by 30
Reagan: Arizona by 35
San Jose State at California
Here's the joke of the Pacific 10
Conference — the Bears are tied
for the lead at 1-0, and yet they will
be lucky to finish in the top half of
the league come December. The
Spartans will be a welcome sight
for California, who might get a bet
ter day of practice scrimmaging a
Bay area Pop Warner squad.
Stanford flogged SJSU by 31
several weeks ago, and Cal should
administer a rare shellacking on
Saturday.
Even Fred can't please the
Stanford community by picking a
Spartan victory. But he does insist
that if the Cardinal beat SJSU by
31, "Cal can only beat them by 2."
You're too kind, Fred.

force him to play the eternal opti
mist. Fortunately, as a worthless
and unknown cog in the machi
nations of this gargantuan uni
versity, I am under no such obli
gation.
Fred (saving face):
Stanford by 90
Reagan (without face):
Notre Dame by 35
Oregon at USC
We both despise the Trojan
self-love. Fred loves the way a
football loss takes "a bite out of
the SC ego." I love the way the
Coliseum parking lots are always
full of German and Italian luxury
automobiles during USC home
games.
I see this game as the Ducks'
big chance. The Trojans are
mediocre at best this year, with a
lucky win against Washington as
their only bright spot this season.
They squeaked by Baylor last
week, after their star running
back was suspended while ques
tions regarding the legitimacy of
his ACT score were addressed.
Besides, Coliseum fans still have
to wield weapons in defense to
exit the stadium and reach their


cars on the streets of south-central
Los Angeles alive.
It all sounds like Oregon's first
Southern California victory in
years to me. Fred makes the safer
bet.
Fred: USC by 10
Reagan: Oregon by 3
UCLA at Washington
Don't expect the seventh
ranked Huskies to come out with
their heads hung low. Just because
they are still under probation from
the NCAA powers-that-be, there
was no lolly-gagging involved in
their 38-20 plowing of Miami last
week.
Fred's days spent in southern
California might have lured his
faith into the abilities of the Bru
ins. Insisting that UCLA usually
"starts out slow," he's calling even
odds on this weekend's game.
Yet the Bruins, unranked in
this week's polls, have under
achieved for too long this time.
Last week's screw-up fest against
Washington State highlighted the

worst UCLA had to offer, includ
ing a lousy return from injury by
wide receiver J.J. Stokes.
As flat as the Bruins have been,
they were soundly booed out of the
Rose Bowl last week. And if South
ern California fans actually takj
their precious time and effort to
boo a team, then there are some
serious problems.
Fred: Even
Reagan: Washington by 14
Washington State at Ten
nessee
No question that the smart
money would have been on the
Volunteers at the beginning of the
season. But after a 1-3 start, the
Tennessee squad is unranked,
uninspiring, and about as unified
as the Rwandan national militia.
The Cougars, however, are
undefeated and ranked No. 17 in
the country. The defense has not
allowed a touchdown in 1994, and
their visit last week to UCLA
won't be the only game they play
in the Rose Bowl this year.
Fred: Tennessee by 3
Reagan: WSU by 7
Oregon State at Arizona
The betting line calls Arizona by 22

over the Beavers, but Fred disagrees.
After the Cardinal lost by 25 to the
Wildcats, he thinks that a spre- d of 22
on the game implies that "Oregon
State is better than [Stanford)."
Game day is October 22 in Cor
vallis — may the best of the worst
win. Until then, may the worst be
the best at continuing to lose.
Fred: Arizona by 30
Reagan: Arizona by 35
San Jose State at California
Here's the joke of the Pacific 10
Conference — the Bears are tied
for the lead at 1-0, and yet they will
be lucky to finish in the top half of
the league come December. The
Spartans will be a welcome sight
for California, who might get a bet
ter day of practice scrimmaging a
Bay area Pop Warner squad.
Stanford flogged SJSU by 31
several weeks ago, and Cal should
administer a rare shellacking on
Saturday.
Even Fred can't please the
Stanford community by picking a
Spartan victory. But he does insist
that if the Cardinal beat SJSU by
31, "Cal can only beat them by 2."
You're too kind, Fred.
Fred: Cal by 2
Reagan: Cal by 28
We all adored him for his cute
smile, cherished him for his inno
cent voice, and envied him for his
sexy girlfriend. But .now, "The
Wonder Years" star and Stanford
freshman Fred Savage is getting
down to serious business.
He's picking the spreads with
me in the college football games
of the week:
Stanford at Notre Dame
It's the Mother Teresa vs.
George Foreman title bout of col
lege football. The Cardinal may
be the only team to have beaten
the Irish twice in South Bend in
the past decade, but no historical
gimmick-playing or wishing upon
a star can change the facts —
Stanford is reeling with injuries
after last week's Desert Swarm
and outmatched defensively.
If the Stanford squad of pre
season hype appears, this game
could be a decent one. If any
Notre Dame team at all shows
up, it'll be an old-fashioned lam
basting.
A Stanford victory would take
divine intervention; in fact, I'd
bet the farm that half of the Irish
starting squad is actually of the
Catholic faith before putting my
money on a Cardinal conquest.
Unable to publicly wager
against his own university, Fred
is taking a hyperbolic stance on
Saturday's match. "If the offen
sive line keeps the pressure off, I
can see Steve [Stenstrom] collect
ing a few thousand yards in the
air. That just might be enough."
He may not be exaggerating.

Without a ground attack, the
Cardinal will be armed only with
air assaults. And let's face it —
you don't need Norman
Schwarzkopf to tell you that it's
impossible to get it done solely
through the air.
Fred's loyalty to Stanford and
his tremendous popularity all but
force him to play the eternal opti
mist. Fortunately, as a worthless
and unknown cog in the machi
nations of this gargantuan uni
versity, I am under no such obli
gation.
