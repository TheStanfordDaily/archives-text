## Reagan Demas faces off with Fred Savage in this week's picks 
### 
We all adored him for his cute
smile, cherished him for his inno
cent voice, and envied him for his
sexy girlfriend. But .now, "The
Wonder Years" star and Stanford
freshman Fred Savage is getting
down to serious business.
He's picking the spreads with
me in the college football games
of the week:
Stanford at Notre Dame
It's the Mother Teresa vs.
George Foreman title bout of col
lege football. The Cardinal may
be the only team to have beaten
the Irish twice in South Bend in
the past decade, but no historical
gimmick-playing or wishing upon
a star can change the facts —
Stanford is reeling with injuries
after last week's Desert Swarm
and outmatched defensively.
If the Stanford squad of pre
season hype appears, this game
could be a decent one. If any
Notre Dame team at all shows
up, it'll be an old-fashioned lam
basting.
A Stanford victory would take
divine intervention; in fact, I'd
bet the farm that half of the Irish
starting squad is actually of the
Catholic faith before putting my
money on a Cardinal conquest.
Unable to publicly wager
against his own university, Fred
is taking a hyperbolic stance on
Saturday's match. "If the offen
sive line keeps the pressure off, I
can see Steve [Stenstrom] collect
ing a few thousand yards in the
air. That just might be enough."
He may not be exaggerating.

Without a ground attack, the
Cardinal will be armed only with
air assaults. And let's face it —
you don't need Norman
Schwarzkopf to tell you that it's
impossible to get it done solely
through the air.
Fred's loyalty to Stanford and
his tremendous popularity all but
force him to play the eternal opti
mist. Fortunately, as a worthless
and unknown cog in the machi
nations of this gargantuan uni
versity, I am under no such obli
gation.
Fred (saving face):
Stanford by 90
Reagan (without face):
Notre Dame by 35
Oregon at USC
We both despise the Trojan
self-love. Fred loves the way a
football loss takes "a bite out of
the SC ego." I love the way the
Coliseum parking lots are always
full of German and Italian luxury
automobiles during USC home
games.
I see this game as the Ducks'
big chance. The Trojans are
mediocre at best this year, with a
lucky win against Washington as
their only bright spot this season.
They squeaked by Baylor last
week, after their star running
back was suspended while ques
tions regarding the legitimacy of
his ACT score were addressed.
Besides, Coliseum fans still have
to wield weapons in defense to
exit the stadium and reach their
