Cardinal 14
Santa Barbara S

It took a while to get the ball rolling, but
the Stanford men's water polo team cruised
to victory yesterday, defeating UC-Santa
Barbara by a score of 14-5 at deGuerre Pool.
The top-ranked Cardinal (7-1) came out of
the gates slowly, falling behind the No. 8
Gauchos (3-4) midway through the first
quarter, 1-0. Cardinal head coach Dante Det
tamanti ascribed the slow start to impa
tience and the team's recent loss to Califor
nia.
"We were trying too hard to reestablish
dominance," said Dettamanti. "We were try
ing to win the game in the first two minutes
of the first quarter, forcing bad shots and
passes."
Two minutes after the Gauchos' goal,
however, Stanford reasserted its champion
ways as Ail-American Wolf Wigo tied the
match with a breakaway goal.
Santa Barbara opened the second quar
ter's scoring when Doug Wierenga found the
net for the second time, spinning inside and
lobbing the ball over Cardinal goalie Jack
Bowen. The 2-1 lead was the last the Gau
chos would enjoy, as Stanford exploded for
five goals in the next three minutes.
The offensive onslaught was sparked by
the shooting arm of junior Dan Hancock,
who countered Wierenga's goal by netting a
two-pointer of his own, turning the Cardinal
deficit into a 3-2 lead. Hancock scored again
