It took a while to get the ball rolling, but
the Stanford men's water polo team cruised
to victory yesterday, defeating UC-Santa
Barbara by a score of 14-5 at deGuerre Pool.
The top-ranked Cardinal (7-1) came out of
the gates slowly, falling behind the No. 8
Gauchos (3-4) midway through the first
quarter, 1-0. Cardinal head coach Dante Det
tamanti ascribed the slow start to impa
tience and the team's recent loss to Califor
nia.
"We were trying too hard to reestablish
dominance," said Dettamanti. "We were try
ing to win the game in the first two minutes
of the first quarter, forcing bad shots and
passes."
Two minutes after the Gauchos' goal,
however, Stanford reasserted its champion
ways as Ail-American Wolf Wigo tied the
match with a breakaway goal.
Santa Barbara opened the second quar
ter's scoring when Doug Wierenga found the
net for the second time, spinning inside and
lobbing the ball over Cardinal goalie Jack
Bowen. The 2-1 lead was the last the Gau
chos would enjoy, as Stanford exploded for
five goals in the next three minutes.
The offensive onslaught was sparked by
the shooting arm of junior Dan Hancock,
who countered Wierenga's goal by netting a
two-pointer of his own, turning the Cardinal
deficit into a 3-2 lead. Hancock scored again

less than two minutes later and the
rout was on.
"Dan really came through for
us," Dettamanti said. "He came off
the bench and scored a key goal right
when we needed it."

Stanford used superior passing
and counter-attacking to catch
Santa Barbara goalie Mike McMillen
either out of position or facing a Car
dinal shooter one-on-one.
"This was a game that was domi
nated by our fast break," Dettaman
ti said.
However, the coach added that
the team will try to slow things down
and set up the offense more in the

future.
"We just need to control the game
and wait for the good shots, and
eventually we'll just wear them
down," he said.
The easy shots put Stanford up
12-3 at the end of three quarters of
play, allowing Dettamanti to give his
whole squad playing time on the way
to the 14-5 final. Highly recruited
freshmen Crosby Grant and David

Hay added goals in the fourth quar
ter.
Wigo and Hancock led the Cardi
nal in scoring with three goals
apiece. Junior Jeremy Laster and
senior Frank Schneider chipped in
two points each, while sophomore
Dan Lehoczky and junior Josh
Leachman added one.
The Cardinal will face Long
Beach State today at 3 p.m. at

deGuerre Pool, before playing in the
Northern California Tournament
Saturday and Sunday.
The Nor Cal Tourney will feature
twelve collegiate teams, all ranked in
the nation's top-20. Hailed as the
country's toughest field, the Nor Cal
field will include the top eight rated
teams: Stanford, USC, California,
Pacific, UCLA, Pepperdine, UC-
Irvine and UC-Santa Barbara

In a coincidence of scheduling,
Stanford will compete in bracket
play with Santa Barbara (11:00
a.m.) and Long Beach St. (3:00 p.m.)
on Saturday.
In Sunday's championship
round, the Cardinal will likely face
either UCLA or Pacific at 9:00 am,
then either No. 2 USC or No. 3 Cal.
Stanford already captured first in
the Southern California Tourna
ment, held three weeks ago.
