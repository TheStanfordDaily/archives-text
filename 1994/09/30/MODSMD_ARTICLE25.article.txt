Carrying on a long-standing tradition in the
Stanford women's soccer program, the fourth
ranked Cardinal upped its record to 7-0 with an

easy 3-0 triumph over Sacramento State yester
day at Maloney Field.
The Cardinal has always been quick out of
the gates in past seasons, starting the 1991 sea
son with a team-record 12 straight wins. The
team had a 9-0 beginning in 1992, and a 10-1
mark to open last year. In those campaigns,
however, most players were healthy.
In 1994, injuries have been the norm. Stan
ford has managed to remain undefeated despite
injuries that have sidelined seven players for
multiple contests, and at least three players are
out for the season. Freshman mid fielder Rita

Hermiz was the latest to fall, tearing knee liga
ments in Sunday's contest against California.
Hermiz became the fourth player on the team to
suffer a major knee injury this season.
Despite the injuries, the wins just keep on
coming. In Thursday's pasting of the Hornets,
Stanford's depth proved key, as reserves Mandy
Tucker and Andrea Johnson provided all the
scoring.
Though the ball remained in the Sacramento
State half of the field for virtually the entire con-
test, the Hornets (3-4) managed to
hold Stanford to only three goals
and several near-misses. Second
year head coach lan Sawyers, who
earned his 25th career victory, was
pleased with the Cardinal domi
nance.
"It's very difficult to play with
that much possession," Sawyers
said. "When you get so much pos
session like that, sometimes you
lose concentration, but I think our
kids did a great job of keeping on
track with what we wanted to
achieve."
Stanford wasted no time
putting the Hornets into an early
hole, as sophomore Mandy Tucker
received Dena Dey's pass from the
right side and knocked it by the
near post at three minutes, 16 sec
onds into the first period.
After over forty minutes of
complete Stanford control but
nothing to show for it, Tucker
continued another trend for the
Cardinal — early second-half
scores. Her shot just 1:45 after
intermission barely crossed the
goal line for her second score of
the game, equaling her prior

career total. Dey registered her
second assist of both the game and
the season.
With slightly over 20 minutes
remaining, forward Andrea John
son, a steady scorer in each of her
first three years, notched her first
goal of the season with the help of
sophomore Wendy Latimer's first
career assist.

'I think any player
on the team can
definitely do the
job. That's a good
feeling to have.'
— Mandv Tucker

Defensively, the Stanford back
field seldom allowed penetration.
The Hornets managed only two
shots on goal (as compared to
Stanford's 23) and senior goal
keeper Jennifer Poehler made only
one save in her fourth shutout of
the campaign.
Keeping with the pattern of the
1994 season, the snake-bit Cardi
nal suffered another injury.
Sophomore forward Emily Burt

went down at 67:11 but was able
to walk oflf the field after about
two minutes.
The loss of Burt was ofTset by
the returns of freshman mid field
er Elie Foster and junior mid field
er Carmel Murphy. Foster had
missed the California match-up
with a sprained ankle, and Mur
phy had been sidelined for two
games with a broken nose. Foster
started and managed to get a shot
on goal. Though not in the start
ing line-up, Murphy saw plenty of
action, firing a team-high four
shots.
After becoming the latest in a
series of Cardinal reserves to step
in and contribute, Tucker saluted
the team's depth.
"We have very good players on
the team," she said. "I think any
player on the team can definitely
do the job. That's a good feeling to
have."
The healthy players now turn
their sights to defeating their
assistant coach, Cardinal all-time
scoring leader Sarah Rafanelli.
Rafanelli, National Team member
Julie Foudy, and about 40 other
former Stanford women's soccer
greats will square off against the
current squad Sunday in the
annual Alumni Game. The 9 a.m.
battle will take place at Maloney
Field.

Junior midfielder Carmel Murphy returns to the lineup after suffering a broken
nose. "She's on the road to taking care of things," said coach lan Sawyers.
