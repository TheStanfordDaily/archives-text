### 
CAPE TOWN, South Africa
(AP) — A man accused of
killing Stanford student Amy
Biehl said Wednesday that he
was chatting with a friend at
the time she was attacked, but
he said the friend was afraid
to testify in support of his
alibi.
It was a new twist in the
trial, at which prosecution wit
nesses have claimed they were
being threatened.
Mongezi Manqina, 22, one of
three young men being tried in
the death of the young woman
from Newport Beach, Calif.,
testified that on the day of the
murder he returned home from
school and cleaned the house
before going to a market. He
said he spoke for about 15 min
utes with a friend there, during
the time Biehl was slain by a
mob.
Manqina said that he and
his friend were members of the
Pan Africanist Congress and

that the friend was afraid of
being attacked by African
National Congress supporters
if he testified.
Manqina maintained that
the ANC and the more militant
PAC are bitter rivals and indi
cated his friend feared he
would be targeted if he was per
ceived to be helping a PAC
member.
But responding to the prose
cutor's questions, Manqina
said his mother and other fam
ily members were ANC mem
bers.
In the Cape Town area, the
two groups' members, while
politically at odds, rarely attack
each other.
Manqina, Mzikhona
Nofemela and Vusumzi Ntamo
have all pleaded innocent to
charges of murder, robbery and
public violence in Biehl's death.
Biehl, a 26-year-old white
Fulbright Scholar, was beaten
and stabbed to death by black

youths chanting racist slogans
in August 1993. She had driven
friends home to Cape Town's
Guguletu township, where she
had worked on voter education
projects.
