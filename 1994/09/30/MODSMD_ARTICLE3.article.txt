# LaRocca pleads no contest
## Irwin's preliminary hearing postponed in vandalism case 
### September Treviño Staff writer 
Todd Laßocca, a former Stanford student, pleaded
no contest to felony vandalism charges, while senior
Thomas Irwin, who pleaded not guilty in his first for
mal hearing, received a continuance at a joint prelim
inary hearing yesterday.
The two are part of a group of six Stanford stu
dents accused of defacing the campus "Gay Libera
tion" statue last spring.
At the hearing, the Municipal Court Judge Rise
Jones Pichon advised Laßocca that a plea of no con
test was essentially the same as pleading guilty.
She also informed Laßocca that a Superior Court
judge — who will be presiding over the sentencing
hearing — had already indicated that if he entered
such a plea, Laßocca would likely be sentenced to
serve 100 hours of community service, 100 hours of
graffiti clean up and no more than one year of proba
tion.

During the hearing, Pichon told Laßoeca that he
would also be required to attend educational classes,
with the understanding that he would not be expect
ed to serve any more jail time and could pay between
$200 and $10,000 in fines. In addition, she said that
Laßocca may be responsible for reimbursing "any
economic losses" stemming from the vandalism.
The maximum penalty for a felony vandalism is up
to three years in prison or probation for up to five
years.
Although Pichon accepted the sentencing yester
day, she informed Laßocca that a sentencing judge in
Superior Court could deliver a separate punishment.
Laßocca and Irwin had been initially placed in a
package disposition to be considered co-defendants.
While Laßocca's plea came as no shock to Deputy
District Attorney Valerie Marchant — whose office
made the decision to consider the two defendants sep
arately — the plea change was new to Irwin's attor
ney John Morrow Hackmann.

Giacalone pleads no contest to charges of felony
vandalism at his preliminary hearing held yester
day .
"I was informed by the DA's
office that they could not be
split," said Hackmann. Tony
Giacalone, Laßocca's attorney,
would not comment on the pro
ceedings.
Ultimately, deciding whether
or not to try the two together falls
within the authority of the Santa
Clara County District Attorney's
Office.
According to Marchant, there
was no reason not to try them
separately and she did not foresee
any problems with splitting the
defendants up.
Following Laßocca's hearing,
Irwin requested a continuance
because of the sudden change in
his status as a co-defendant and
his decision to add a new member
to his defense team.
"He wants as much legal help
as he can afford to have," said
Hackmann, following Irwin's
decision to hire lawyer Kevin

Morrison.
It has not yet been determined
whether Hackmann will step
down or stay on as advising coun
sel.
Laßocca and Irwin are the two
defendants in the vandalism case
who allegedly threw black paint
on George Segal's "Gay Libera
tion" sculpture, while four others
are believed to be aiders and abet
tors in placing a bench between
two of the figures.
According to Hackmann, how
ever, there is no justification for
the felony charges against Laßoc
ca and Irwin. "There's no clear
evidence that what one person
did was more than what the oth
ers did," he said.
Irwin's preliminary hearing
has been scheduled for Oct. 14 at
Palo Alto Municipal Court, while
Laßocca's hearing for formal sen
tencing is set for Nov. 29 at Santa
Clara County Superior Court.
The four other students appre
hended for the May 16 incident
face misdemeanor charges and
will attend a pretrial conference
scheduled for Oct. 11.
