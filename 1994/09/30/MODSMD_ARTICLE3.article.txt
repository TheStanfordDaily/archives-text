# LaRocca pleads no contest
## Irwin's preliminary hearing postponed in vandalism case 
### September Treviño Staff writer 
Todd Laßocca, a former Stanford student, pleaded
no contest to felony vandalism charges, while senior
Thomas Irwin, who pleaded not guilty in his first for
mal hearing, received a continuance at a joint prelim
inary hearing yesterday.
The two are part of a group of six Stanford stu
dents accused of defacing the campus "Gay Libera
tion" statue last spring.
At the hearing, the Municipal Court Judge Rise
Jones Pichon advised Laßocca that a plea of no con
test was essentially the same as pleading guilty.
She also informed Laßocca that a Superior Court
judge — who will be presiding over the sentencing
hearing — had already indicated that if he entered
such a plea, Laßocca would likely be sentenced to
serve 100 hours of community service, 100 hours of
graffiti clean up and no more than one year of proba
tion.

During the hearing, Pichon told Laßoeca that he
would also be required to attend educational classes,
with the understanding that he would not be expect
ed to serve any more jail time and could pay between
$200 and $10,000 in fines. In addition, she said that
Laßocca may be responsible for reimbursing "any
economic losses" stemming from the vandalism.
The maximum penalty for a felony vandalism is up
to three years in prison or probation for up to five
years.
Although Pichon accepted the sentencing yester
day, she informed Laßocca that a sentencing judge in
Superior Court could deliver a separate punishment.
Laßocca and Irwin had been initially placed in a
package disposition to be considered co-defendants.
While Laßocca's plea came as no shock to Deputy
District Attorney Valerie Marchant — whose office
made the decision to consider the two defendants sep
arately — the plea change was new to Irwin's attor
ney John Morrow Hackmann.
