# Havel speaks on multiculturalism
## 
### Scott Van Winkle Staff writer 
In selecting a theme for
yesterday's lecture at Frost
Amphitheater, Vaclav
Havel, president of the
Czech Republic, set aside the
specific political divisions
that continue to shape his
own country, and instead
chose a topic that has previ
ously sparked some contro
versy on this campus — mul
ticulturalism.
He delivered the address
before receiving the Jack
son H. Ralston Prize from
the Law School. The prize,
consisting of a cash grant
and lecture invitation, was
established in 1972 to re
ward diplomatic achieve
ments and intellectual lead
ership contributing to "the
development of the role of
law in international rela
tions."
Havel was joined at the
ceremony by folk singer Joan
Baez, who performed an a
cappella version of "Swing
Low, Sweet Chariot before

his speech." Havel is a noted
rock fan who lists Pink Floyd
and the Velvet Underground
among his favorites. He con
siders a 1989 Baez concert he
attended as a pivotal event in
his struggle against Commu
nism.
Havel stuck to the focus of
the event — international
law — while primarily ad
dressing a "conflict of cul
tures" that he saw as imped
ing the spread of freedom
around the globe.
While Havel called the dis
semination of Western val
ues "the only salvation of the
world today," he questioned
the Western assumption
that democracy "can be ex
ported like cars or television
sets."
He cited a lack of tran
scendental purpose and criti
cal self-examination as the
"forgotten dimension of
democracy." That is the
source of the shallow materi
alism the rest of the world
perceives in Western culture,
the former dissident play
wright said.

In conclusion, he warned
against renewed utopi
anism.
"The internalization of
democracy today can scarce
ly take the form of some new
doctrine," Havel said. "This
probably would have exactly

the opposite effect: To all the
mutually distrustful cultur
al currents there would only
be added others, ones that
would be very artificial be
cause they would not have
