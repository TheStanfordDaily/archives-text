# Havel speaks on multiculturalism
## 
### Scott Van Winkle Staff writer 
In selecting a theme for
yesterday's lecture at Frost
Amphitheater, Vaclav
Havel, president of the
Czech Republic, set aside the
specific political divisions
that continue to shape his
own country, and instead
chose a topic that has previ
ously sparked some contro
versy on this campus — mul
ticulturalism.
He delivered the address
before receiving the Jack
son H. Ralston Prize from
the Law School. The prize,
consisting of a cash grant
and lecture invitation, was
established in 1972 to re
ward diplomatic achieve
ments and intellectual lead
ership contributing to "the
development of the role of
law in international rela
tions."
Havel was joined at the
ceremony by folk singer Joan
Baez, who performed an a
cappella version of "Swing
Low, Sweet Chariot before

his speech." Havel is a noted
rock fan who lists Pink Floyd
and the Velvet Underground
among his favorites. He con
siders a 1989 Baez concert he
attended as a pivotal event in
his struggle against Commu
nism.
Havel stuck to the focus of
the event — international
law — while primarily ad
dressing a "conflict of cul
tures" that he saw as imped
ing the spread of freedom
around the globe.
While Havel called the dis
semination of Western val
ues "the only salvation of the
world today," he questioned
the Western assumption
that democracy "can be ex
ported like cars or television
sets."
He cited a lack of tran
scendental purpose and criti
cal self-examination as the
"forgotten dimension of
democracy." That is the
source of the shallow materi
alism the rest of the world
perceives in Western culture,
the former dissident play
wright said.

In conclusion, he warned
against renewed utopi
anism.
"The internalization of
democracy today can scarce
ly take the form of some new
doctrine," Havel said. "This
probably would have exactly

the opposite effect: To all the
mutually distrustful cultur
al currents there would only
be added others, ones that
would be very artificial be
cause they would not have

grown out of the nourishing soil
of myth-making eras. If a renais
sance of spirituality does occur, it
will far more likely be a multi-lev
eled and multi-cultural reflection,
with a new political ethos, spirit
or style."
Havel participated in a myth
making era of his own — the Vel
vet Revolution that overthrew
Czechoslovakia's Communist
government in 1989.
Before that moment, Havel had
been a government target, impris
oned repeatedly for resisting gov
ernment censorship both in his
plays and in organized protests.
Havel and other dissidents
defied government restrictions
during Baez's 1989 concert in
Prague when they joined her on
stage. Havel later called the event
"the drop that caused the cup to
spill over," Law School Dean Paul
Brest said.
In tribute to that concert, at
which Havel posed as a stage
hand, the statesman carried out
the singer's guitar for her closing
song today.

Since those momentous times,
the country has split into separate
Czech and Slovak republics.
Havel lost his bid to keep the
country together in early 1993,
but was later elected president of
the Czech Republic.
At the end of Havel's remarks
yesterday, the crowd, which filled

most of the amphitheater, rose to
its feet.
Slovak freshman Martin
Bruncko, who skipped his first
section of Structured Liberal Edu
cation to attend the speech, said it
was a "nice surprise" to discover
that his former president would
be speaking at Stanford.
Bruncko, who plans to major in
international relations, experi

enced first-hand both the dissolu
tion of Czechoslovakia and the
Velvet Revolution, when it seemed
"everything was possible."
Bruncko enjoyed the speech

but held back in his praise of the
guest of honor.
"He's great as a man," he said,
"but as a politician, he makes mis
takes."
