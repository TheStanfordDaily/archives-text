## ASSU expands Type & Design, creates new graphics center 
### Juthymas Harntha Senior staff writer 
In trying to meet the campus demand for nifty
looking business cards and brochures that was left
unfulfilled by the closing of Stanford Publications
Services' Graphics Center, the ASSU has created its
own graphics center to serve the University.
The ASSU Senate will vote on a bill to create the
center as an expansion of ASSU Type & Design at its
meeting next Tuesday. The bill proposes setting up
the business — called the Stanford Design Group —
for a trial period of six months, according to ASSU Fi
nancial Manager Gabe Lucas, who helped author the
bill.
"We hope and expect that it will be passed," said
ASSU Senate Chair Nawwar Kasrawi. "There's a
general feeling that this is a positive improvement."
The new subsidiary has been up and running for
about four weeks already. Lucas said he and several
ASSU senators on campus this summer decided to

create the group without the senate's approval be
cause of pressing circumstances.
"It all came up during mid-August," Lucas said.
Once the Graphics Center closed, off-campus design
companies began strongly soliciting University de
partments that were in need of graphics.
"We wanted to keep Stanford business on cam
pus," Lucas said, and quick action was necessary if
the Stanford Design Group were to regain the Graph
ics Center's old accounts. "I felt confident that our
OK would suffice until the ASSU gets back," he said.
In the meantime, they hired Patty Hoppe, a for
mer senior designer for the Graphics Center, and
purchased her computer equipment from the Uni
versity.
"We're being conservative," Lucas said. The sena
tors spent less than the $10,000 they had budgeted
for the group's startup costs.
University Director of Communications Terry
Shepard said he supports having
the design service on campus.
"We didn't have the money to
keep it up, but we're glad some
one's doing it,"he said.
While the Stanford Design
Group has more business than it
can handle at the moment, Lucas
said he expects it to grow even
more and eventually capture
some of the bigger accounts that
the Graphics Center once han
dled.
He predicted that "they will be
easily convinced to come back to
campus within a year."
Meanwhile, some of these
accounts — like the Admissions
and the Development Offices —
have continued working with the
same Stanford Publications Ser
vice designers they have worked
with in the past. After being laid
off by the University last month,
many of them have gone on to cre
ate their own companies or do
freelance work.
The Admissions Office is using
a new company called Artefact,
which is run by four former
Graphics Center designers who
were laid off, according to Vivian
Barry, the assistant dean of
administration in the Admissions
Office.
"We kept with them because
they had already had inside
knowledge about Stanford,"
Barry said. "If we had to go to an
entirely new company, we'd be in
a terrible spot."

She said the Admissions Office
— which spends about $130,000 a
year on publications — would
probably continue using Artefact
for at least the rest of this school
year.
Artefact also has the Develop
ment Office account, as well as
work in progress with the Law
School, summer session and some
small projects from the Hoover
Institution, according to Susan
Cretarolo, a partner at Artefact
and the former director of the
Graphics Center.
"We're riding on what we had
before," Cretarolo said. "We sell
them on the long-term relation
ship."
She said that many other
former co-workers at the
Graphics Center have done the
same — formed their own com
panies or begun free-lancing —
and taken their old accounts
with them.
Hoppe said that, meanwhile,
the Stanford Design Group has
been successful in its own right.
"We're not soliciting customers,
but business is doing pretty well,"
she said. "We're trying to keep
some Stanford identity, keep the
image continuing."
ASSU Type & Design Manager
Scott Kirk said many of the Uni
versity's departments like work
ing with the Stanford Design
Group because they think an on
campus organization is more
knowledgeable about Stanford's
style and image.
With an off-campus group,
Kirk said, "There's no one to say,
'No, you can't put the Stanford
seal in green.' "
