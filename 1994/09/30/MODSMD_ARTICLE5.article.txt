## ASSU expands Type & Design, creates new graphics center 
### Juthymas Harntha Senior staff writer 
In trying to meet the campus demand for nifty
looking business cards and brochures that was left
unfulfilled by the closing of Stanford Publications
Services' Graphics Center, the ASSU has created its
own graphics center to serve the University.
The ASSU Senate will vote on a bill to create the
center as an expansion of ASSU Type & Design at its
meeting next Tuesday. The bill proposes setting up
the business — called the Stanford Design Group —
for a trial period of six months, according to ASSU Fi
nancial Manager Gabe Lucas, who helped author the
bill.
"We hope and expect that it will be passed," said
ASSU Senate Chair Nawwar Kasrawi. "There's a
general feeling that this is a positive improvement."
The new subsidiary has been up and running for
about four weeks already. Lucas said he and several
ASSU senators on campus this summer decided to

create the group without the senate's approval be
cause of pressing circumstances.
"It all came up during mid-August," Lucas said.
Once the Graphics Center closed, off-campus design
companies began strongly soliciting University de
partments that were in need of graphics.
"We wanted to keep Stanford business on cam
pus," Lucas said, and quick action was necessary if
the Stanford Design Group were to regain the Graph
ics Center's old accounts. "I felt confident that our
OK would suffice until the ASSU gets back," he said.
In the meantime, they hired Patty Hoppe, a for
mer senior designer for the Graphics Center, and
purchased her computer equipment from the Uni
versity.
"We're being conservative," Lucas said. The sena
tors spent less than the $10,000 they had budgeted
for the group's startup costs.
