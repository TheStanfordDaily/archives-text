# Stein joins Stanford Board of Trustees
## 
### Beth Berselli Senior staff writer 
In his role as Stanford Univer
sity's newest trustee, Palo Alto
resident Isaac Stein said he hopes
to address issues ranging from
alumni satisfaction to the reorga
nization of the Medical Center.
Stein, 47, who graduated from
Stanford's business and law
schools, was elected to a five-year
term in June.
He brings a wealth of "experi
ence and expertise to the board,"
said John Freidenrich, chair of the
Board of Trustees. "He's an out
standing person with excellent

judgement. . . . He'll be an excel
lent trustee."
Stein is the president of Waver
ley Associates, Inc., a private in
vestment firm in Palo Alto. He is
also former chairman of the ap
parel company Esprit de Corp,
where he served as chief executive
officer and acting president from
1991 to 1992.
Stein's Stanford involvements
have included membership on the
national advisory board of the
Haas Center for Public Service,
the Law School Board of Visitors
and the Hospital Modernization
Project Committee.
For the last six years, Stein has

been instrumental in the reorga
nization of the Medical Center.
He was a member of the Stan
ford University Hospital Board of
Directors from 1988 to 1993, and
last year he served as vice chair of
a presidential task force that sug
gested creating Stanford Health
Services — a new organization
aimed at unifying patient-care op
erations of the Stanford Hospital
and the Faculty Practice Program.
Stein, who is the chair of the
board for SHS, said he wants to
work with the Board of Trustees
to create the affiliations Stanford
needs to succeed in the changing
health-care marketplace.
"What's clear in health care
today is you can't go it alone," he
said. "You've got to work with
outside groups."
Medical centers should partici
pate in research and teaching,
and not just make money, Stein
stressed.
As a trustee, Stein said he will
also examine ways to increase
alumni satisfaction and contribu
tion rates.
"I would like to develop a bet
ter understanding of how people
identify with the undergraduate
experience," he said. "Our giving

rates are low
compared to peer
institutions in
the East."
The Universi
ty needs to go
beyond fundrais
ing and instead
determine what
aspect of the
"undergraduate

experience creates this problem,"
he said.
Stein said he's excited about
serving on the board. "Stanford
has played a large part in my life,"
he said. "I went into Stanford,
and I never really came out."
"This is a time when there are
a lot of threats against education
in the United States," Stein said.
"I feel the role of the Board of
Trustees is, in a sense, the con

science of the institution. ... It
has to do what's necessary to
preserve the core of the institu
tion."
Stein earned a bachelor's
degree in economics and mathe
matics from Colgate University in
New York. After completing his
Stanford graduate degree in
1972, he became a partner in the
San Francisco law firm of Heller,
Ehrman, White & McAuliffe, spe
cializing in corporate and securi
ties matters.
From 1979 to 1983, he worked
at Raychem Corp., where he
served as chief financial officer
and general counsel. He formed
Waverley Associates in 1983.
Stein resides in Palo Alto with
his wife, Madeline, and their two
children, who attend Dartmouth
College and Princeton University.
