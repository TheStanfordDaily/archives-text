# Frustrated customer
## Man rages at post office 
### Michael Slemmer Editorial staff 
Is it possible to strong-arm the
Post Office into speeding up its
service? Yesterday afternoon, one
man seemed to think so.
An unidentified individual
took out his frustration with slow
service by standing in front of the
Stanford Post Office, waving in
the air what some witnesses said
was a baseball bat, and shouting
about poor service for nearly five
minutes.
According to Stanford station
manager Jim Ruiz, the individual
was Caucasian with short brown
hair and glasses and was carrying
a small brown suitcase. "He was
waving around what was either a
mailing tube or a baseball bat,"
Ruiz said.
Shortly before leaving the
vicinity of the post office in the di
rection of Braun Music Center,
Ruiz said, the man hit one of the
blue mail receptacles, leaving a
scratch and a small dent. "Either
he hit the mailboxes or threw
something at them," Ruiz said.
The individual "reminded me
of Michael Douglas from [the
movie] Falling Down," Ruiz said.
While police searched the
vicinity for about 30 minutes, the
individual was never found and
no police report had been filed by
last night, according to David Lee
of the Stanford Police.
Immediately after the incident,
deputy Allen James searched for
the individual in the vicinity of
White Plaza and Tresidder with a

witness, but he was unable to
locate the angered postal cus
tomer.
James was already in the
vicinity at the time of the inci
dent because of a shoplifting
incident at the Stanford Book
store.
Richard Hawkins, who wit
nessed the event, said the man
"was screaming about the post

office. ... He was walking back
and forth and he was banging his
suitcase around."
While witnesses on the scene
remembered little of what the
individual said, Hawkins recalled
that the enraged customer said he
"had bills to pay."
"I think he's just mad because
he didn't get his mail," Hawkins
said.
