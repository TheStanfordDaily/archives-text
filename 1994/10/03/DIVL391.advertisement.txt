CORE COURSE
CEOSPHERE
MWF at 9:00
Building 370, Room 370
3 units
The major focus explores aspects of geophysics and
geochemistry needed to approach problems of the
whole-earth system and global change.
Topics include the interactions between tectonics,
the rock cycle, oceans, atmosphere, and living organisms with an
eye towards applying these "big picture"
concepts to issues immediately connected to human activities.
