I â€¢ : -\
Last year's
twisters
tied us up
in knots.
Twisters in Kansas, Illinois, and
throughout the Midwest. Even time we
turned around another windstorm took
its toll Ml around the country. 55,(MM)
other disasters blew away the rest of our
disaster relief budget.
Last year was the most devastating year
in the history of Red Cross disaster relief
And unless we raise millions immediately
our ahilit\ to weather the coming storms
is in jeopardy. Please help.
