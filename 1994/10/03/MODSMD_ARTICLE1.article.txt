# NIH to unveil women's study
## $10M to go to Med Center 
### Marc Lee Staff Writer 
The National Institutes of Health has chosen
Stanford University Medical Center as one of 40 sites
that will collectively conduct the nationwide
Women's Health Initiative, a $628 million endeavor
focused on researching chronic diseases in post
menopausal women.
Stanford is among 24 new centers that will join the
16 established last year, the NIH announced Thurs
day. The Medical Center will receive $10 million for
the project over the next decade.
"I'm obviously very excited," said Marcia Stefan
ick, the project's principal investigator at Stanford.
"This is going to be the study of women's health."
Stefanick is a senior research scientist at the Stan
ford Center for Research in Disease Prevention.
The Women's Health Initiative project consists of
a clinical trial as well as an observational study, both
of which will examine heart disease, osteoporosis and
cancer, particularly of the breast.
Each of the 40 sites chosen will work toward the
national goal of recruiting 63,000 postmenopausal
women for the clinical trial and 100,000 for the ob
servational study.
The Women's Health Initiative, unlike previous
studies on men, is very committed to studying mi
nority women, Stefanick said. Indeed, one goal of the
massive, national research effort is to include at least
20 percent minority women to
expand the applicability of
results.
The goal for the Stanford Med
ical Center is to recruit 3,600 eli
gible volunteer women, including
1,400 women for the clinical trial
and 2,200 for the observational
study.
So far, the medical center has
established an advisory board to
help carry out the project. It also
plans to set up a clinic in north
ern San Jose to attract more
minority subjects, Stefanick said.
"It's really time for relation
ships to be developed outside of
Stanford," she said. "We're inter
ested in getting Asian women and
Hispanic women."
Most of the research will be
conducted at that new site,
although all gynecological studies
will be done at Stanford in con
junction with the Department of

Gynecology and Obstetrics, she
said.
Stefanick expects the trials to
begin in January or early Febru
ary.
The first step
The clinical trial will be divid
ed into three efforts run simulta
neously. The first will try to
determine whether a low-fat (20
percent) diet prevents breast can
cer, colon cancer and heart dis
ease. The second will discern
whether hormone replacement
therapy prevents osteoporotic
fractures and heart disease.
Women participating in either
of those two studies may also par
ticipate in a third, which will
assess whether calcium and vita
min D prevent colon cancer and
bone fracture.
Researchers will screen poten
tial participants via a mammo
gram, in vitro biopsy of the
uterus and blood samples.
"There are very few exclusion
ary criteria," Stefanick said.
However, women who already

have had a heart attack within
the six months prior to the study
or who have had breast cancer
will be among the ineligible.

'We really do see our participants as part
ners in our research. We do not see them as
guinea pigs.'

Prospective participants
who do not pass the screening
to enter the clinical project
may be followed by researchers
in the observational study,
which will look at the risk fac
tors for the diseases under
investigation.
Stefanick explained that it is
not yet known what those factors
are for women, although such
factors for corresponding dis
eases in men are known.
The observational study also
seeks to identify new biomark

ers, such as biochemical tests
and DNA markers, that may
anticipate the onset of cancer,
heart disease and osteoporotic

fractures.
A "bonding" commitment
Although the Women's Health
Initiative is officially searching
for a pool of women aged 50 to
79, Stefanick said that
researchers are expected to
recruit the vast majority of par
ticipants from women older than
60 to 65.
"We don't have much informa
tion on these older women," she
said. "Most of the work done so
far has been on men or younger

women."
Participants selected for the
study are expected to make a
commitment that will span
almost 11 years.
"We really do see our partici
pants as partners in our
research," Stefanick said,
explaining the "bonding relation
ship" that will form over such a
long time period.
"We do not see them as guinea
pigs," she stressed.
While results from the
Women's Health Initiative will
benefit women at large, the indi
vidual participants will gain from
additional medical attention
and monitoring, Stefanick said.
Researchers will not actually
treat the women but will work
with the women's personal physi
cians.
"It's a relationship we're strik
ing up. It's good for them (physi
cians) because they will have
access to specialists," Stefanick
said, adding that researchers will
not interfere with the relation
ship between patients and their

doctors.
"Leader in hormone research"
To be selected as one of the 40
sites, researchers had to submit a
200-page proposal describing the
demographics of the potential
study population, and give evi
dence of their success in recruit
ing and retaining women for pre
vious health projects, Stefanick
said.
Stanford was one of seven cen
ters working on a recently com
pleted, three-year NIH project
called the Postmenopausal Estro
gen Progestin Interventions Trial
and is currently conducting the
Heart and Estrogen-Progestin
Replacement Study.
"Stanford has really estab
lished itself as being a leader in
women's hormone research,"
Stefanick said.
The only other Bay Area site
chosen was the Kaiser Perma
nente Medical Care Program in
Oakland. That center received
about $8.5 million over a 10-year
period.
