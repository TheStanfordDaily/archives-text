# Parking shortage upsets students
## 
### Allison Short Staff writer 
Does it ever seem that there
are more cars than there are
parking spaces on this campus?
Some student drivers think
so — especially when they find
themselves continuously cir
cling their residence parking lot
for an open space.
But actually, according to
Jeffrey Tumlin, special projects
coordinator at the Transporta
tion Program Office, it may be
that students are simply not
informed about where to park
when all the spaces are taken.
There is always an overflow
parking lot for students unable
to find parking directly in
front of their residence, said
Tumlin.
"Part of the problem is that
there is so much information to
get out about where students
can park," he said. "People
either don't read it, or there
isn't enough time to show them
each lot where they are able to
park."
Students can pick up campus
parking maps at the Transporta

tion Center on Serra Street.
According to Tumlin, resi
dent parking permits are only
sold to people in those dorms.
However, the office sells as
many permits as the students
demand, meaning there could
be more permits sold than
there are spaces available in
each lot.
Still, students continue to
complain about the apparent
shortage of nearby spaces, and
say that parking lots further
away are inconvenient, often
full, and possibly unsafe during
the night.
"If I was by myself at night I
might feel tentative," said senior
Cathy Martin, a Governor's
Corner resident.
And sophomore Emily Tier
ney, a resident in Toyon Hall,
said that parking this year is
much worse for her. "I had to
figure out on my own where I
could park."
Senior Wendy Rhomadka, who
lives in Governor's Corner, said,
"There are limited spaces since
this is our only lot. The spaces are
also very small so the sides of your
doors get dinged up."

Part of the problem right now
is that during the first week of
school there are parents and vis
itors on campus in addition to
extra commuter students who
are shopping for classes, said
Tumlin.
Tumlin suggested that, when
they encounter full lots, stu
dents should look in overflow
lots, which are "always some
where in walking distance."
"We group the residential
parking areas together," he said.
For example, residents in Mir
rielees are also able to park in
the Escondido and Rains park
ing lots.
"There are always plenty of
open spaces where you're
allowed to park 24 hours a day,"
Tumlin added.
There has also been on-going
discussion about adding more
parking lots, Tumlin said.
But due to funding and the
low cost of resident parking per
mits, he doesn't see additional
lots in the near future. Instead,
Tumlin said he wants to pro
mote alternative options to
driving such as buses and
trains.
