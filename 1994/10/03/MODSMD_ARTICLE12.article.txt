General welcomes tribunal
GOMA, Zaire (AP) — The general who
led Rwanda's Hutu army to defeat says
he would welcome an international war
crimes tribunal — although his own
troops are blamed for many of the mas
sacres that killed at least 500,000 people.
"If there are Rwandan military forces
implicated, they must be judged," said
Maj. Gen. Augustin Bizimungu, chief of
staff of the exiled Hutu army.
"If they ask me any questions, I'm
ready to answer them."
There is no firm evidence that Biz
imungu, who has traded his uniform for
a blue business suit and considers him
self a refugee, participated directly in the

slaughters, in which most of the victims
were minority Tutsis.
Officials differ on Haiti

of Staff Leon Panetta said U.S. forces will
