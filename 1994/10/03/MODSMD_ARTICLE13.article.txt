### 
NEW DELHI, India (AP) -
Authorities tried to calm widen
ing panic over India's deadly
plague outbreak yesterday, and
two Persian Gulf states began
evacuating their citizens.
Neighboring Bangladesh and
Pakistan, meanwhile, reported
the first suspected cases of pneu
monic plague outside India.
Fear of contamination has
reached panic levels in New Delhi,
the capital of 11 million people.
Press Trust of India said the
number of suspected plague cases
reported rose from 2,848 on Sat
urday to 4,059 yesterday. Only
about 22 cases have so far been
confirmed. The majority have
turned out to be other diseases
such as tuberculosis and pneumo
nia, or even common colds.
The plague has killed at least
58 people in recent weeks, includ
ing 54 in Surat, the western city
where the outbreak began, and
four in New Delhi.
Many people in New Delhi
have told their maids to take

leave and ordered children to
stay indoors, fearing exposure to
the disease. Many people in the
city are wearing cloth face masks
in an effort to avoid contamina
tion.
The government asked folk
artists to use a major Indian reli
gious holiday to help quell panic.
Traveling stage actors in north
ern India will use Ramlila — a
10-day celebration that starts
Oct. 10 — to spread information
about how the plague can be
cured and how to prevent trans
mission.
In the first organized evacua
tion since the outbreak began, the
Persian Gulf state of Qatar evacu
ated 125 of its citizens from Bom
bay, United News of India report
ed. Gulf Air, the Manama-based
airline, will operate special flights
to evacuate Bahrain citizens
today, United News said.
In Pakistan, an 8-year-old boy
was hospitalized with flu-like
symptoms and was being tested
for the plague, said Dr. Mushtaq

Ahmed, a Health Ministry official
in Islamabad.
The boy arrived in Pakistan on
a special train from New Delhi for
Pakistanis stranded after their
government suspended regular
travel links with India because of
the outbreak.
In Bangladesh, yesterday's
newspapers said about 50 people
had been hospitalized with sus
pected plague, but no cases had
been confirmed.
In an effort to keep the plague
from spreading abroad, Indian
Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha
Rao has ordered doctors to exam
ine every passenger leaving India
by air or sea. No one has been
found with plague symptoms
since the checkup began Friday
night, an official at New Delhi air
port said yesterday.
The plague is carried by rats
and fleas, and can be spread by a
cough from an infected person. It
is easily cured with antibiotics if
caught early, but untreated it is
rapidly fatal.
