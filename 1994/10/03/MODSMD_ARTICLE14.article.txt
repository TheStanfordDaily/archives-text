### 
MEXICO CUT (AP) - A man who
confessed to a role in the assassination
of a top ruling party politician told
investigators yesterday the plot was
masterminded by a congressman upset
over plans to reform the party.
According to a statement from the
attorney general's office, Jorge
Rodriguez Gonzalez, who was arrested
over the weekend, told police the con
gressman, Manuel Munoz Rocha, hired
him and his brother, Fernando, to plan
last week's killing of Jose Francisco
Ruiz Massieu.
The congressman wanted Ruiz
Massieu killed because he was a member
of a new group of politicians trying to
reform the ruling Institutional Revolu
tionary Party (PRI), the attorney general

quoted Jorge Rodriguez Gonzalez as say
ing.
Ruiz Massieu, the PRl's No. 2 offi
cial, was shot in the neck and killed
Wednesday outside a Mexico City hotel.
The gunman was arrested at the scene
and has also confessed, police said.
The slaying was the latest in a series
of violent attacks that have rattled Mex
ico for more than a year. It also shook
the PRI, in power for 65 years, which
lost its first presidential candidate, Luis
Donaldo Colosio, to an assassin's bullet
in March.
The man who police say confessed to
shooting Ruiz Massieu, 28-year-old
horse trainer and farmhand Daniel
Aguilar Trevino, was arraigned in a
Mexico City criminal court for murder

and possession of a firearm prohibited
for civilian use, a federal felony. He was
being held yesterday night.
But authorities allege Trevino was
part of a wider conspiracy of at least five
men, all from Tamaulipas state.
Munoz Rocha is accused of hiring the
two brothers, who then hired Trevino as
the trigger man, authorities say.
Munoz Rocha and Fernando
Rodriguez Gonzalez, who is an aide to the
congressman, were being sought by police
for questioning. Police are asking
congress to impeach Munoz Rocha, who is
chairman of the House water commission,
the attorney general's statement said.
Another suspected accomplice, Carlos
Angel Cantu Narvaez, was questioned
yesterday after turning himself in.
