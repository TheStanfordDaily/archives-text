## Revamp Rec Center 
### 
WHEN CONSIDERING
STANFORD'S most popular
hang-out spots, Tresidder
Union's Recreation Center doesn't
exactly spring to mind. In fact, to
spend a Saturday night wallowing
behind one of the center's 14 video
games would be to renounce many of
one's claims to adulthood.
The ASSU, however, has an oppor
tunity to change this. Pending senate
approval tomorrow, the ASSU will
assume management of the Recre
ation Center.
In principle, the Recreation Cen
ter is currently being maintained by
Tresidder's new management team,
the Stanford Management Company.
Members of the Stanford Manage
ment Company, however, have cor
rectly pointed out that students
would be better equipped to make
decisions regarding the center.
The ASSU should capitalize on
this new opportunity by soliciting

student input on how best to revital
ize the space. While an indoor skat
ing rink might be overly ambitious,
surely the center could benefit from
a more diverse selection of entertain
ment possibilities.
At present, the center houses a
game room (complete with pinball
machines, video games and pool
tables), a video-rental machine and a
camping-equipment rental service.
The ASSU should update these ser
vices and, in turn, offer new ones
depending upon what students desire.
In the past, the ASSU's role in
business-related matters has been
spotted with shades of incompetence
— several years ago, for example, the
ASSU was forced to give up control
of the Coffee House, due to financial
difficulties and poor management.
The ASSU must avoid its past mis
takes, and instead transform the
Recreation Center into a place which
belongs on the Stanford campus.
