# Storage needs work
## 
### 
OVER THE SUMMER, the
University debuted a new
on-campus summer storage
service that drew praise from staff
and customers alike.
For many students, the program
offered a convenient storage option
at rates much lower than off-cam
pus commercial storage services
often charge.
For others, however, summer
storage was a nightmare.
Some students claimed that over
the summer, their belongings were
moved from one storage site to
another; for instance, from Wilbur
Hall to Stern Hall. Other students
said they found rust stains and
water spots on their stored items.
The University formerly provided
free summer storage. Under the new
storage system implemented this
summer, however, students were
charged between $5 and $20 per box
or item — primarily because the new

service would have to pay for itself,
Assoc. Director of Housing and Din
ing Services Rodger Whitney said
last spring. But charging a fee trans
forms summer storage from a gratu
itous service into a quasi-commercial
venture — and with that shift comes
added responsibility.
The University assumed no liabil
ity for lost, damaged or stolen goods.
But at the same time, students who
entrust their belongings to the stor
age service should be able to assume
that their belongings will be undis
turbed over the summer and that
the University will take reasonable
measures to prevent damage.
In the future, University officials
should take additional precautions
to ensure that students' belongings
are safe and secure. Unless they do
so, students will undoubtedly choose
off-campus storage options, doom
ing an otherwise promising pro
gram.
