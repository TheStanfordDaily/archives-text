Political art and art of politics are not the same

THE DAILY EDITORIAL board
thinks the vandalism of the Gay
Liberation sculpture on campus by
several Stanford students should be cov
ered by the hate-crime law (Sept. 30).
Wow. Does everyone understand what
the hate-crime laws are? They are laws
that punish thought crime, making
motivation punishable on a par with
harm or attempted harm. Many of us
think that thought-crime laws are
unconstitutional and certainly un-Amer
ican. But to make it a thought crime to
attack a blatantly political statement
like the "Gay Liberation" sculpture?
That is egregious beyond belief.
The George Segal "Gay Liberation"
sculpture is an in-your-face attempt to
force people to confront their instinctive

repulsion to homosexuality. Not only is
this kind of gratuitous confrontation
and arousal of repulsion political, it is to
my mind very ill-advised. Does The Daily
really think it should be canonized as
beyond disagreement? The real question
is whether criminal charges should be
brought at all.
Suppose pro-life activists were given a
central location on campus to install a
sculpture depicting abortion as murder.
If some angry pro-choice activist poured
paint on such a piece of "art," should
Stanford have the district attorney bring
felony charges? Wouldn't that confuse
political art with the art of politics?
Political art can be meritorious and
deserving of curatorship, but the art of
politics, never. That is dirty pool —

attacking politically while seeking pro
tection behind the curator's skirts —
and is exactly the game that is being
played with "Gay Liberation."
Surely Stanford has the option of
dropping the charges and imposing
internal sanctions only. Instead, it is
going to let the state prosecute and pos
sibly incarcerate six of its students for
responding in a nonviolent manner to a
University-imposed political statement. I
think I'd go for an entrapment defense.
If Stanford is going to insist on plac
ing this tableau in front of passersby,
where it must repulse — instead of in a
museum where people could go to see it,
or in some homosexual milieu where it
might be loved, let's at least treat it
explicitly as an attempt at social engi-

neering, with punishments for vandal
ism that are consistent with this pur
pose. If you paint it, you have to clean it
up. If you bend it, you have to unbend it.
If you destroy it, you have to recast it.
But let's not have any of this nonsense
about restoring it to some perfect condi
tion, as if this really were a piece of art
with any valuable perfection.
If homosexuals think this sculpture is
valuable as art, then remove it to some
protected, less public location. Of course,
that violates the intent of the tableau —
for people to confront it. But that just
proves that the intent is political, not
artistic, and political art as politics is not
to be curated.
