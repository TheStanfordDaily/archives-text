# Acquiring Ginsberg collection was not a well-thought decision
## 
### 
The acquisition of Allen Ginsberg's
treasures has the hallmarks of other
high-level decisions on campus: name
ly, secrecy, unpreparedness and lack of
perspective.
Does the undisclosed and evidently
substantial sum paid come from spe
cial funds or from an unidentified
benefactor? There is every reason for
members of the Stanford community
to fear a significant impact on their
salaries and (yes, library) services

because of future maintenance costs
associated with the outsize bulk of the
materials bought.
A Sept. 20 New York Times article
— quoting a Stanford English profes
sor as saying, "If he came down tomor
row, nine-tenths of the English depart
ment wouldn't turn out for him" —
undoubtedly generated many laughs at
Stanford's expense regarding the wis
dom of the purchase.
Which other faculty and staff mem
bers, besides the three English depart
ment professors who spurred on the
purchase, were consulted by Library
Collections Dir. Tony Angiletta before
he made the fateful decision? If "the
library was not even aware that items
like Ginsberg's beard clippings and
sneakers were in the archive" (The

Stanford Daily, Sept. 22), it seems
that haste, rather than careful study,
marked the buying strategy. Was it
not possible, it may be wondered, to
bid on and acquire only the
manuscripts, without much fear of
rivals for the sneakers and other bric
a-brac?
The expressed view of one faculty
member in favor of the acquisition, "I
know how important it is to keep
piles of trash" (San Jose Mercury
News, Sept. 7), is dismaying. More
over, Angiletta's reference to a future
exhibition of the archive suggests a
new era of library razzle-dazzle that
is painful for some of us to contem
plate.
