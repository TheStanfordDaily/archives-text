# Student T-shirt raises eyebrows at UC-Berkeley
## 
### Michael Slemmer Editorial staff 
In the days preceding Big Game, T-shirt vendors
will roam the halls of residences at both Stanford and
UC-Berkeley.
But before the T-shirt designers go to work, they
may want to keep one UC-Berkeley junior's experi
ence in the back of their minds. Last year, what Jason
Spire had to sell struck a sour note with women's
groups and other students.
The T-shirt he designed depicted a bear, wearing
the "Cal" insignia, which appeared to be raping a
Stanford cheerleader against a tree.
This year, UC-Berkeley administrators are taking
a closer look at whether such T-shirts, which may tar
nish the school's image, should be authorized by the
university.
Maria Rubinshteyn in UC-Berkeley's office of
Trademarks and Licensing framed the issue in terms
of possible illegal use of the university's copyrighted
logo.
But Spire said he feels attacks on his T-shirt are
more politically motivated.
"I look at the issue of the shirt more along the lines
of the concept of being politically correct," said Spire,
who sold 100 of the shirts before
last year's Big Game. "I didn't
make a profit really on it. ... I
did it more as fun for the Big
Game."
Though many have character
ized the scene depicted on the
shirt as a rape, Spire said he
tried to make the act look con
sensual. "If you look at the girl
[in the design], she's smiling so
it doesn't look like a rape," he
said.
Whatever Spire's motiva
tions, a number of UC-Berkeley
students were galvanized by a
letter which UC-Berkeley junior
Christina Laurisen wrote last
month to the Daily Californian,
saying that the shirt degrades "a
large portion of the student
body in the name of UC-Berke
ley."
Although Spire sold the shirt
independently of the university,
the UC-Berkeley student store
received complaints about it and
UC-Berkeley administrators
began to investigate.
But Spire said he feels the

campus reaction is misplaced. "If
you know me, you know I'm the
kind of guy that would do a stupid
joke like that," he said. Still,
Spire said he will not order any
more of the shirts this year.
Spire admitted that some of
his friends on campus did not find
the T-shirt's design or message
humorous. "Some of them told
me they thought it was degrad
ing," he said, adding that he
understands how some students
might have interpreted his shirt
as offensive.
UC-Berkeley officials have
ordered Inky Fingers, the print
ing company which manufac
tured the T-shirts, not to make
any more.
Rick Salsman, owner of Inky
Fingers, said because the uni
versity's insignia is a registered
trademark, in some instances,
UC-Berkeley can sue over inap
propriate use of the "Cal" logo.
Salsman said, however, that
the university has indicated it
will most likely not file suit
against his company for copy
right infringement.
"My mistake was not knowing
at the time I printed the shirts
that they needed to be licensed
[by UC-Berkeley]," Salsman said.

"We don't do much with licensed
artwork. I thought it was part of
the artist's prerogative to include
a rendering of the insignia."
But Salsman added that he
was always opposed to filling
Spire's order.
"Basically, the reason I did it
was [Spirel had already paid some
one in my office, and he threat
ened me with a lawsuit if I didn't
print the shirts," Salsman said.
Spire, on the other hand,

claims that Salsman had no prob
lems with the design and that he
"thought it was funny."
Salsman said the incident has
cost his business financially. "At
this point, we've had several
groups that had placed orders
with us ask for refunds," he said.
"I personally regret that this
T-shirt was ever printed," Sals
man said, adding that UC-Berke
ley has been "very civil in dealing
with the issue."
