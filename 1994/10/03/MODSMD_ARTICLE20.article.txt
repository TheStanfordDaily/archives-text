# Multicultural educator praises student help
## 
### 
Let me express my appreciation and
gratitude to Carolyn Baek, Sara Horsley,
and Linda Ramos for their excellent
work in producing this year's "Faces of
the Community" orientation program.
They worked tirelessly and diligently
throughout the summer to create the
program.
Judging from the feedback I have
received, the program engaged students
on many levels and stimulated many dis
cussions. I invite the community to join
me in applauding their service.
