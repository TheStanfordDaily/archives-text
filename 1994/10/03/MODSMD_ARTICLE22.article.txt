## Mayor Liz Kniss Palo Alto, bringing the 'town' to town-and-gown 
### 
Waving goodbye
to my parents
as I stood in the
college parking lot many
years ago, I remember
feeling far, far away
although I had grown
up less than 80 miles
from the school. This
was Boston; I had been

there often and yet nothing felt familiar.
For all of you new to the Palo Alto-
Stanford area, I know this may look very
different, and I would like to say welcome
and invite you to get to know and enjoy
Palo Alto. We very much want to help
make your transition here positive and
exciting; more on that later.
Palo Alto has about 57,000 people,
25,000 households and 75,000 jobs —
though if you're looking for housing, you
may think that the dwelling number has
shrunk recently. We're less than an hour
from San Francisco, around four hours
from good skiing, and about two hours
from Marin County and the wine country.
That's the straightforward part.
Of interest to many is how Palo Alto
and Stanford, both of whom are strong
and vocal forces in Silicon Valley, get along
together. Each has their own agenda and
plan for the future; they don't always coin
cide. Palo Alto is a fairly large city, incor
porated to provide services for 57,000 peo
ple; the University is charged with educat
ing some 14,000 students.
How do I view this relationship
between these two clearly bright and
somewhat arrogant neighbors, who some

times act like family and at other times
give the impression of being very distant
cousins? Especially as each of these brings
valuable but quite different qualities to
mind. Stanford, known as the Harvard of
the West, brings a distinct intellectual and
cultural flavor to this area, thousands of
acres of (sometimes) green open space and
special events unmatched in the Bay area.
The University is a magnet for milestones,
from World Cup soccer to Mikhail Gor
bachev, from the Joffrey ballet to V&clav
Havel. But additionally, Stanford is one of
the area's largest employers, and I know
many see Stanford as a business as well as
an educational institution.
Palo Alto, across the street, sees itself
— as a friend recently said — as "Perfect
Palo Alto." With beautiful tall trees, some
lovely and historic old homes and great
weather (the average daytime tempera
ture in October is a balmy seventy-plus
degrees), I'm not sure what could be miss
ing. Known for its public schools — and
Stanford is part of the school district —
Palo Alto students continue to test among
the top in the nation; of course, some go on
to Stanford. We are known also for a very
liberal attitude — in fact, we are recog
nized at times just for our attitude.
By now, you realize that the town-and
gown relationship is not always a calm and
peaceful one. I should mention that Stan
ford is not a part of Palo Alto, but is with
in the Santa Clara County limits.
Although not the governing body, Palo
Alto is a strong influence, and Stanford
exerts an equally strong influence on our
city. I do believe that each has a strong

admiration for the other, and each bene
fits from the close relationship. However,
like families, we can criticize each other,
but others don't have that same privilege.
In recent years, I think the relationship
has gotten a great deal better and more
open. More informal meetings are held
and less conflict can be seen. And I truly
see a change, although I believe that some
conflict is clearly unavoidable, given the
two strong players.
As students, I hope you won't just stay
down on the Farm, but will get involved
with us in Palo Alto. There are lots of ways
to do this: volunteer, join a group, or, as
some have done, intern at City Hall. In the
volunteer area, you can make a real con
tribution to kids; we have lots of need for
fall soccer coaches and recreation supervi
sors as well as opportunities at unique
facilities like the Community Association
for the Retarded, where swimming coach
es are always in demand for children with
special needs.
A great group to join is the 21st Century
Committee, who will be running the closing
ceremonies for our 1994 Centennial Cele
bration on Oct. 8 and 16. With a cadre of
active young Palo Altans who have a mail
ing list of over 600, it's a great way to vol
unteer and meet others — even date them.
Lots to do, lots to see, many opportuni
ties and a great chance to be part of a
town-and-gown saga that has gone on for
over 100 years. Don't miss out — you may
only be here for four years!

Liz Kniss is the mayor of the City of Palo
Alto.
