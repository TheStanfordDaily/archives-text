## University plans development 
### Justin Pollard Staff writer 
Stanford is putting the finish
ing touches on a proposal to
extend Sand Hill Road, build a
major housing development in the
area known as Stanford West and
expand the Stanford Shopping
Center.
As currently proposed, Sand
Hill Road would be widened from
two lanes to four lanes from
Junipero Serra Boulevard to
Arboretum Road, and extended
to El Camino Real. Quarry Road
would also be expanded to four
lanes, and a connector road
would be constructed between
Sand Hill Road and Campus
Drive West.
Stanford is also planning to
build 630 multi-family rental
units and 388 senior condomini
ums on the Stanford West site, a
70-acre field located between
Sand Hill Road and San Fran
cisquito Creek.
In addition, the University is
proposing to expand the Stanford
Shopping Center by 160,000
square feet, or 11.5 percent of its
current size. Additional parking
areas would also be constructed.
"The proposal and application
for Stanford West are being
worked on now, and later this fall
will be referred to the City of Palo
Alto," said Andy Coe, the Univer
sity's director of community rela
tions.
Coe said the next step will be
for the City of Palo Alto to pre
pare an environmental impact
report, at which point the City

Council will vote on whether to
approve the proposal. He expects
the entire process to take about
16 to 18 months.
"The people of Palo Alto are
very much in favor of the exten
sion of Sand Hill Road; the senior
project is extremely popular, and
. . . there is support for [the
apartment housing] as well," said
Coe.
He added that the project
would be "beneficial to surround
ing communities as well as Stan
ford" and said the University has
made "significant efforts to pre
serve open space and protect San
Francisquito Creek."
Menlo Park must approve
Stanford's plans as well, because
part of Sand Hill Road passes
through its city limits. But, so far,
many Menlo Park residents are
critical of the proposal.
The development project is
expected to benefit Stanford by
meeting demands for housing,
improving the flow of traffic, and
bringing in substantial revenue
from the rental of the housing
units and the expansion of the
shopping center. Palo Alto would
receive over $600,000 a year in
additional sales tax revenues.
"I am among those who think
that the city and the region would
benefit from additional housing,"
said Joe Simitian, vice mayor of
Palo Alto, adding that "Sand Hill
(Road) has not been terribly func
tional" in its current form, com
ing to a dead end at the shopping
center.
But Simitian added that
"we've got a long, long way to go

before we can make a decision.
There is a lot of information we
need to get, and a lot of comments
we need to hear."
Menlo Park would not reap any
benefits, and will likely be hurt by
the project, said Gail Slocum, a
member of the Menlo Park City
Council.
"As it is currently proposed, I
could not support this project,"
she said. "I don't think Stanford
has done enough to listen to the
concerns [about the project], espe
cially of Menlo Park."
"This is probably the biggest
development that the area has
seen in 20 to 30 years, and has sig
nificant effects on the environ
ment, residential quality of life,
San Francisquito Creek, and the
downtowns of Palo Alto and
Menlo Park," Slocum said.
Traffic on Sand Hill Road
would increase by 12,000 to
25,000 cars a day if it were
expanded to a four lane "express
way," greatly increasing traffic
congestion in Menlo Park, Slocum
said.
She said she fears that
motorists will turn off of Sand
Hill into residential districts to
avoid traffic, thereby decreasing
property values in surrounding
neighborhoods.
Slocum also said she believes
that the increased commercial
space in the shopping center may
hurt businesses in downtown
Palo Alto and Menlo Park.
Other community members
are particularly concerned about
the environmental impact of the
proposed development.

"We are opposed to Stan
ford's current plan primarily
because of the impact of the
development on the creek," said
Pauline Lord, president of tin-
Committee for Green Foothills,
an organization which attempts
to preserve open space through
out the Bay Area.
If the Palo Alto or Menlo Park
city councils do not block the pro
posal, Lord is certain that some
sort of legal action would be
taken, perhaps by concerned citi
zens, to prevent the develop
ment.
Stanford West "is the last big
open space along San Fran

cisquito Creek," said Peter Drek
meier, co-director of Bay Area
Action, a Palo Alto-based environ
mental organization.
"With added development and
paved areas, the level of San
Francisquito Creek tends to rise,"
said Drf>kmeier
"People are worried about a
100-year flood," he added. "This
could be prevented if there wasn't
so much development in the
9)
area.
More paved surfaces in the
area would also increase pollution
and storm water runoff into the
creek, said Steve Schmidt, chair of
Menlo Park's Environmental

Beautification Commission.
"Since school has just gotten
started, Students for Environ
mental Action at Stanford has not
yet had a chance to reach consen
sus on the project," said Abdi
Soltani, a member of SEAS. "But
a lot of individual members are
very concerned."
The need for affordable hous
ing in the area is clear, and com
pact housing like apartments
destroys much less open space
than more expensive homes built
on large lots, Soltani said. He did
suggest, however, that a better
site for the apartment complex
would be the golf course.

worked on now, and later this fall
will be referred to the City of Palo
Alto," said Andy Coe, the Univer
sity's director of community rela
tions.
Coe said the next step will be
for the City of Palo Alto to pre
pare an environmental impact
report, at which point the City

Council will vote on whether to
approve the proposal. He expects
the entire process to take about
16 to 18 months.
"The people of Palo Alto are
very much in favor of the exten
sion of Sand Hill Road; the senior
project is extremely popular, and
. . . there is support for [the
apartment housing] as well," said
Coe.
He added that the project
would be "beneficial to surround
ing communities as well as Stan
ford" and said the University has
made "significant efforts to pre
serve open space and protect San
Francisquito Creek."
Menlo Park must approve
Stanford's plans as well, because
part of Sand Hill Road passes
through its city limits. But, so far,
many Menlo Park residents are
critical of the proposal.
The development project is
expected to benefit Stanford by
meeting demands for housing,
improving the flow of traffic, and
bringing in substantial revenue
from the rental of the housing
units and the expansion of the
shopping center. Palo Alto would
receive over $600,000 a year in
additional sales tax revenues.
"I am among those who think
that the city and the region would
benefit from additional housing,"
said Joe Simitian, vice mayor of
Palo Alto, adding that "Sand Hill
(Road) has not been terribly func
tional" in its current form, com
ing to a dead end at the shopping
center.
But Simitian added that
"we've got a long, long way to go

before we can make a decision.
There is a lot of information we
need to get, and a lot of comments
we need to hear."
Menlo Park would not reap any
benefits, and will likely be hurt by
the project, said Gail Slocum, a
member of the Menlo Park City
Council.
"As it is currently proposed, I
could not support this project,"
she said. "I don't think Stanford
has done enough to listen to the
concerns [about the project], espe
cially of Menlo Park."
"This is probably the biggest
development that the area has
seen in 20 to 30 years, and has sig
nificant effects on the environ
ment, residential quality of life,
San Francisquito Creek, and the
downtowns of Palo Alto and
Menlo Park," Slocum said.
Traffic on Sand Hill Road
would increase by 12,000 to
25,000 cars a day if it were
expanded to a four lane "express
way," greatly increasing traffic
congestion in Menlo Park, Slocum
said.
She said she fears that
motorists will turn off of Sand
Hill into residential districts to
avoid traffic, thereby decreasing
property values in surrounding
neighborhoods.
Slocum also said she believes
that the increased commercial
space in the shopping center may
hurt businesses in downtown
Palo Alto and Menlo Park.
Other community members
are particularly concerned about
the environmental impact of the
proposed development.

"We are opposed to Stan
ford's current plan primarily
because of the impact of the
development on the creek," said
Pauline Lord, president of tin-
Committee for Green Foothills,
an organization which attempts
to preserve open space through
out the Bay Area.
If the Palo Alto or Menlo Park
city councils do not block the pro
posal, Lord is certain that some
sort of legal action would be
taken, perhaps by concerned citi
zens, to prevent the develop
ment.
Stanford West "is the last big
open space along San Fran

cisquito Creek," said Peter Drek
meier, co-director of Bay Area
Action, a Palo Alto-based environ
mental organization.
"With added development and
paved areas, the level of San
Francisquito Creek tends to rise,"
said Drf>kmeier
"People are worried about a
100-year flood," he added. "This
could be prevented if there wasn't
so much development in the
9)
area.
More paved surfaces in the
area would also increase pollution
and storm water runoff into the
creek, said Steve Schmidt, chair of
Menlo Park's Environmental

Beautification Commission.
"Since school has just gotten
started, Students for Environ
mental Action at Stanford has not
yet had a chance to reach consen
sus on the project," said Abdi
Soltani, a member of SEAS. "But
a lot of individual members are
very concerned."
The need for affordable hous
ing in the area is clear, and com
pact housing like apartments
destroys much less open space
than more expensive homes built
on large lots, Soltani said. He did
suggest, however, that a better
site for the apartment complex
would be the golf course.

Traffic is expected to increase dramatically on Sand Hill Road if developers proceed with the contro
versial Stanford West project.
Stanford is putting the finish
ing touches on a proposal to
extend Sand Hill Road, build a
major housing development in the
area known as Stanford West and
expand the Stanford Shopping
Center.
As currently proposed, Sand
Hill Road would be widened from
two lanes to four lanes from
Junipero Serra Boulevard to
Arboretum Road, and extended
to El Camino Real. Quarry Road
would also be expanded to four
lanes, and a connector road
would be constructed between
Sand Hill Road and Campus
Drive West.
Stanford is also planning to
build 630 multi-family rental
units and 388 senior condomini
ums on the Stanford West site, a
70-acre field located between
Sand Hill Road and San Fran
cisquito Creek.
In addition, the University is
proposing to expand the Stanford
Shopping Center by 160,000
square feet, or 11.5 percent of its
current size. Additional parking
areas would also be constructed.
"The proposal and application
for Stanford West are being
worked on now, and later this fall
will be referred to the City of Palo
Alto," said Andy Coe, the Univer
