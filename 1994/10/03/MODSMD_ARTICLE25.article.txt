George Leland Bach died Thursday of Parkin
son's disease in Portola Valley at the age of 79.
Bach, the founding dean of the Carnegie-
Mellon University Business School, was nation
ally renowned for his role in making business
school a respectable place to get an eduation.
"If you're thinking about getting an MBA
today, as many students are. . . you never would
have thought about it in the 19505, before Lee
entered the scene," said Business Prof. Emeri

tus Harold Leavitt, one of Bach's colleagues.
Bach's work at Carnegie-Mellon business
school became a model for business schools all
over the country, Leavitt said.
"He made it academically more respectable,
brought faculty in from other disciplines,"
Leavitt said. "This was followed by a rise in the
quality of business students."
In particular, Bach helped people realize
that "leaders and managers were going to be
important, that you shouldn't just be teaching
them accounting," Leavitt said.
Bach, a native of Victor, lowa, helped start
the Carnegie-Mellon University Graduate
School of Industrial Engineering in 1946, leav

ing in 1962 to teach at Stanford. Ho retired
from the University in 1983.
An economist by trade, Bach's textbook,
"Economics: An Introduction to Analysis and
Policy," was first published in 1954, and has
since gone through 11 editions and been print
ed in four different languages.
Bach also won several teaching awards in
his lifetime, including the Bower Medal for dis
tinguished education and the Dow Jones
Award for contributions to economic educa
tion. He was also a fellow of the American
Academy of Arts and Sciences.
"He was an extraordinary man,' Leavitt
said.
