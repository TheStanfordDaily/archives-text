# Research cuts pass
## 
### 
Taking the final step in cut
ting federal research funding to
universities, the U.S. Congress
last Thursday approved a
Department of Defense appro
priations conference report
that docks about $200 million
from research money nation
wide.
The action comes at the
heels of a summer-long debate
which began in July when the
U.S. House of Representatives
passed a bill that cut $900 mil
lion — about half of the total
research funds — from the
Department of Defense budget.
Later in the summer, the
U.S. Senate passed its own ver

sion of the Defense appropria
tions bill, cutting only $82 mil
lion in research funding. The
conference commiteee — com- , 1
posed of negotiators from both
the House and the Senate — set
tled on aii amount between the }
two numbers early last week.
The final cut represents
about 11 percent of the total
research funding to universi
ties, leaving about $1.6 billion
to be distributed nationwide.
Last week, Stanford adininis- '
trators said they will not know
how it will affect the University
until they learn exactly how the j
cuts are to be made across the *
country.
