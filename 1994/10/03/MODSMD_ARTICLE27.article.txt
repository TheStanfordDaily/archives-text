## Cardinal blitzkrieg penetrates but falls short 34-15

Cardinal 15
Irish 34

Last Saturday, Stanford dom
inated the statistical battle but
was again reminded that the
only numbers which truly mat
ter are those displayed on the

scoreboard. And that inevitable
fact — a lopsided 34-15 Notre
Dame victory — sent the Cardi
nal home with another loss
despite outplaying the Irish for
the first 30 minutes of the game.
Judging by the raw numbers,
Stanford (1-2-1) should have

demolished the eighth-ranked
Fighting Irish (4-1). Time of pos
session (35 minutes, seven sec
onds to 24:53), total plays (95 to
50), first downs (29 to 16) and
total yards (421 to 384) all
favored the Cardinal. And in the
first half alone, Stanford held
the ball for an unheard of 22:08,
compared to Notre Dame's 7:52.
However, the lack of any Car
dinal big plays kept Stanford
from a victory. Not until a 24-
yard run by sophomore Quincy
Jacobs with 5:10 remaining in
the game did Stanford gain more
than 19 yards on a single play.
"We took a real beating today
from a really solid, typical Notre
Dame team," said head coach
Bill Walsh. "I thought in the
first half we played on almost
equal terms. Then the battle of
attrition started and Notre
Dame just has bigger, stronger
guys in a lot of positions and it
really started showing up."
Even a record day by senior
quarterback Steve Stenstrom
could not make up for a decimat
ed running game, as sophomore
Mike Mitchell did not play (ankle
sprain) and sophomore Adam
Salina saw limited action (shoul
der bruise). Stenstrom threw 59
passes and completed 37 (both
career highs) for 360 yards and
two touchdowns.
He also became only the third
quarterback in Pacific 10 Con
ference history to throw for
more than 9,000 yards. His
9,349 career passing yards
(including bowl games) ties him
with Stanford's John Elway
(1979-1982) for second in Pac-10
history, and places him only 44
yards behind leader Eric Wil
helm of Oregon State (1985-
1988).
"Stenstrom again demon
strated that he's one great foot
ball player," Walsh said. "You
saw a gallant performance by a
guy who wouldn't quit."
Taking the opening kickoff,
Stanford looked like the offen
sive juggernaut the coaching
staff knew it could be, marching
75 yards down to the Irish two

yard line. Using a balanced
attack, the Cardinal threw eight
passes and ran six times. Howev
er, a touchdown pass from Sten
strom to senior Justin Armour
was nullified because of a pass
interference penalty, moving the
ball back to the 17-yard line.

'We came close to a
perfect execution in
the first half, but we
should have had a
couple of touchdowns.
We did everything
but score'
- Bill Walsh

Stenstrom and freshman
Anthony Bookman almost con
nected on a miraculous catch on
the next play. The ball was
tipped just before reaching Book
man at the two-yard line. He
managed to twist his body so the
ball fell into his fingertips for a
split-second, however, Notre
Dame free safety Brian Magee
laid a vicious hit on Bookman
which knocked the ball loose.
Stanford had to settle for a 34-
yard field goal by junior Eric
Abrams and an early 3-0 lead.
After holding the Irish to
three plays and out, a botched
punt attempt by senior Aaron
Mills on Stanford's next drive
gave the ball back to Notre
Dame. A 10-man rush by the
Irish broke through Stanford's
line and Mills was forced to
scramble. Notre Dame's Scott
Sollmann knocked the ball loose
and recovered it at the Cardinal
20-yard line.
Using its "best athletes" on
punt protection put Stanford at
a large disadvantage, according
to Walsh. "Our best athletes are
190 pounds, their best athletes
are 240 pounds. We've got small
men doing big men's jobs."
Three plays later, Irish quar

terback Ron Powlus lofted a 15-
yard touchdown pass to Charles
Stafford, five yards behind the
coverage of Jami Webb to give
Notre Dame the lead for good.
Stanford continued its domi
nance of the ball for the rest of
the half, putting together a
mammoth 21-play, 65-yard drive
which consumed nearly nine
minutes. All that work went for
naught as Abrams missed a 32-
yard field goal wide right.
"We came close to a perfect
execution in the first half, but
we should have had a couple of
touchdowns. We did everything
but score," Walsh said. "We were
moving the ball but not getting
in the end zone."
Notre Dame looked ready to
take control of the game late in
the first half when fullback Ray
Zellars broke three tackles and
rambled 58 yards down to the
Stanford six yard line. The Car
dinal defense held strong and
dropped the Irish for a loss on
three consecutive plays. The
Irish then converted a 43-yard
field goal by Scott Cengia, giving
Notre Dame a 10-3 lead at the
half.
Heading into halftime, Stan
ford had 144 yards of total
offense, compared to Notre
Dame's 61. Except for Zellars'
long run, the Irish managed only
three yards of offense and three
first downs.
"We sensed at that time [half
time] we could win the game,"
senior nose tackle Jason Fisk
said. "We knew that if everyone
gave all we had and we played
flawless football we would have
won the game because we were
playing right there with them."
However, the Irish burst out
of halftime with a renewed fury,
marching the ball 88 yards on
their first drive before Powlus
connected with Derrick Mayes
for a 10-yard touchdown pass.
Five and a half minutes later,
Powlus avoided a heavy rush by
junior Jason White and found
Michael Miller wide open at the

Stanford three-yard line for a
47-yard touchdown pass. Sud
denly, it was 24-3 Notre Dame
and the Cardinal was reeling.
"We felt we had to blitz Ron
(Powlus) and they did a great job
picking it up and he did a good
job recognizing it," sophomore
free safety Scott Frost said.
Notre Dame also changed
defensive schemes, as they dis
carded their zone pass coverage
in favor of a traditional man-to
man. This change limited Sten
strom's short passing ability
and essentially took senior tight
end Tony Cline out of the game.
Cline finished with eight catch
es for 78 yards, but only two
catches came in the second half
while he was battling both the
Irish's tough coverage and leg
cramps.
In the third quarter, the Irish
outgained Stanford 157-41 in
total yardage and turned the
tables in the time of possession
battle, holding the ball for 9:45.
"Their continuous pass rush
wore us out," Walsh said. "We
pass-protected extremely well
early, but we just got worn out
and they started to break us
down."
At one point, Powlus com
pleted eight straight passes en

route to an 11-for-14, 166-yard
performance. After running
back Ray Kinder was held to
just three yards in the first half,
he exploded for 104 yards after
halftime and gave Notre Dame
the type of consistent offensive
attack that the Cardinal lacked.
Stanford added two touch
downs late in the fourth quarter
on nine and 19-yard scoring
passes from Stenstrom to senior
Mark Harris, but the game had
already been decided. Place
kicker Abrams continued his
difficult season by having an
extra point blocked.
"I got plenty of elevation," he
said. "It's just when they jump
from five yards out rather than
eight [because of excellent pene
tration] they cut down the
angle."
Despite the loss, Stanford
saw glimpses of how this team is
capable of performing. The
effective use of the short pass
ing game made up for a running
game which gained 61 yards on
36 carries. However, removing
Stenstrom's negative 26 yards
and the 23-yard-loss charged to
Mills on the botched punt
attempt, Cardinal running
backs gained 110 yards. Jacobs
led the attack with 32 yards on
four carries.
"We played really good ball
about 80 percent of the time
today, but it wasn't quite
enough," Fisk said.

gave the ball back to Notre
Dame. A 10-man rush by the
Irish broke through Stanford's
line and Mills was forced to
scramble. Notre Dame's Scott
Sollmann knocked the ball loose
and recovered it at the Cardinal
20-yard line.
Using its "best athletes" on
punt protection put Stanford at
a large disadvantage, according
to Walsh. "Our best athletes are
190 pounds, their best athletes
are 240 pounds. We've got small
men doing big men's jobs."
Three plays later, Irish quar

terback Ron Powlus lofted a 15-
yard touchdown pass to Charles
Stafford, five yards behind the
coverage of Jami Webb to give
Notre Dame the lead for good.
Stanford continued its domi
nance of the ball for the rest of
the half, putting together a
mammoth 21-play, 65-yard drive
which consumed nearly nine
minutes. All that work went for
naught as Abrams missed a 32-
yard field goal wide right.
"We came close to a perfect
execution in the first half, but
we should have had a couple of
touchdowns. We did everything
but score," Walsh said. "We were
moving the ball but not getting
in the end zone."
Notre Dame looked ready to
take control of the game late in
the first half when fullback Ray
Zellars broke three tackles and
rambled 58 yards down to the
Stanford six yard line. The Car
dinal defense held strong and
dropped the Irish for a loss on
three consecutive plays. The
Irish then converted a 43-yard
field goal by Scott Cengia, giving
Notre Dame a 10-3 lead at the
half.
Heading into halftime, Stan
ford had 144 yards of total
offense, compared to Notre
Dame's 61. Except for Zellars'
long run, the Irish managed only
three yards of offense and three
first downs.
"We sensed at that time [half
time] we could win the game,"
senior nose tackle Jason Fisk
said. "We knew that if everyone
gave all we had and we played
flawless football we would have
won the game because we were
playing right there with them."
However, the Irish burst out
of halftime with a renewed fury,
marching the ball 88 yards on
their first drive before Powlus
connected with Derrick Mayes
for a 10-yard touchdown pass.
Five and a half minutes later,
Powlus avoided a heavy rush by
junior Jason White and found
Michael Miller wide open at the

Stanford three-yard line for a
47-yard touchdown pass. Sud
denly, it was 24-3 Notre Dame
and the Cardinal was reeling.
"We felt we had to blitz Ron
(Powlus) and they did a great job
picking it up and he did a good
job recognizing it," sophomore
free safety Scott Frost said.
Notre Dame also changed
defensive schemes, as they dis
carded their zone pass coverage
in favor of a traditional man-to
man. This change limited Sten
strom's short passing ability
and essentially took senior tight
end Tony Cline out of the game.
Cline finished with eight catch
es for 78 yards, but only two
catches came in the second half
while he was battling both the
Irish's tough coverage and leg
cramps.
In the third quarter, the Irish
outgained Stanford 157-41 in
total yardage and turned the
tables in the time of possession
battle, holding the ball for 9:45.
"Their continuous pass rush
wore us out," Walsh said. "We
pass-protected extremely well
early, but we just got worn out
and they started to break us
down."
At one point, Powlus com
pleted eight straight passes en

route to an 11-for-14, 166-yard
performance. After running
back Ray Kinder was held to
just three yards in the first half,
he exploded for 104 yards after
halftime and gave Notre Dame
the type of consistent offensive
attack that the Cardinal lacked.
Stanford added two touch
downs late in the fourth quarter
on nine and 19-yard scoring
passes from Stenstrom to senior
Mark Harris, but the game had
already been decided. Place
kicker Abrams continued his
difficult season by having an
extra point blocked.
"I got plenty of elevation," he
said. "It's just when they jump
from five yards out rather than
eight [because of excellent pene
tration] they cut down the
angle."
Despite the loss, Stanford
saw glimpses of how this team is
capable of performing. The
effective use of the short pass
ing game made up for a running
game which gained 61 yards on
36 carries. However, removing
Stenstrom's negative 26 yards
and the 23-yard-loss charged to
Mills on the botched punt
attempt, Cardinal running
backs gained 110 yards. Jacobs
led the attack with 32 yards on
four carries.
"We played really good ball
about 80 percent of the time
today, but it wasn't quite
enough," Fisk said.

Cardinal 15
Irish 34

Last Saturday, Stanford dom
inated the statistical battle but
was again reminded that the
only numbers which truly mat
ter are those displayed on the

scoreboard. And that inevitable
fact — a lopsided 34-15 Notre
Dame victory — sent the Cardi
nal home with another loss
despite outplaying the Irish for
the first 30 minutes of the game.
Judging by the raw numbers,
Stanford (1-2-1) should have

demolished the eighth-ranked
Fighting Irish (4-1). Time of pos
session (35 minutes, seven sec
onds to 24:53), total plays (95 to
50), first downs (29 to 16) and
total yards (421 to 384) all
favored the Cardinal. And in the
first half alone, Stanford held
the ball for an unheard of 22:08,
compared to Notre Dame's 7:52.
However, the lack of any Car
dinal big plays kept Stanford
from a victory. Not until a 24-
yard run by sophomore Quincy
Jacobs with 5:10 remaining in
the game did Stanford gain more
than 19 yards on a single play.
"We took a real beating today
from a really solid, typical Notre
Dame team," said head coach
Bill Walsh. "I thought in the
first half we played on almost
equal terms. Then the battle of
attrition started and Notre
Dame just has bigger, stronger
guys in a lot of positions and it
really started showing up."
Even a record day by senior
quarterback Steve Stenstrom
could not make up for a decimat
ed running game, as sophomore
Mike Mitchell did not play (ankle
sprain) and sophomore Adam
Salina saw limited action (shoul
der bruise). Stenstrom threw 59
passes and completed 37 (both
career highs) for 360 yards and
two touchdowns.
He also became only the third
quarterback in Pacific 10 Con
ference history to throw for
more than 9,000 yards. His
9,349 career passing yards
(including bowl games) ties him
with Stanford's John Elway
(1979-1982) for second in Pac-10
history, and places him only 44
yards behind leader Eric Wil
helm of Oregon State (1985-
1988).
"Stenstrom again demon
strated that he's one great foot
ball player," Walsh said. "You
saw a gallant performance by a
guy who wouldn't quit."
Taking the opening kickoff,
Stanford looked like the offen
sive juggernaut the coaching
staff knew it could be, marching
75 yards down to the Irish two

yard line. Using a balanced
attack, the Cardinal threw eight
passes and ran six times. Howev
er, a touchdown pass from Sten
strom to senior Justin Armour
was nullified because of a pass
interference penalty, moving the
ball back to the 17-yard line.

the next play. The ball was
tipped just before reaching Book

managed to twist his body so the
ball fell into his fingertips for a

laid a vicious hit on Bookman
which knocked the ball loose.
Stanford had to settle for a 34-

pleted eight straight passes en

route to an 11-for-14, 166-yard
performance. After running
back Ray Kinder was held to
just three yards in the first half,
he exploded for 104 yards after
halftime and gave Notre Dame
the type of consistent offensive
attack that the Cardinal lacked.
Stanford added two touch
downs late in the fourth quarter
on nine and 19-yard scoring
passes from Stenstrom to senior
Mark Harris, but the game had
already been decided. Place
kicker Abrams continued his
difficult season by having an
extra point blocked.
"I got plenty of elevation," he
said. "It's just when they jump
from five yards out rather than
eight [because of excellent pene
tration] they cut down the
angle."
Despite the loss, Stanford
saw glimpses of how this team is
capable of performing. The
effective use of the short pass
ing game made up for a running
game which gained 61 yards on
36 carries. However, removing
Stenstrom's negative 26 yards
and the 23-yard-loss charged to
Mills on the botched punt
attempt, Cardinal running
backs gained 110 yards. Jacobs
led the attack with 32 yards on
four carries.
"We played really good ball
about 80 percent of the time
today, but it wasn't quite
enough," Fisk said.
