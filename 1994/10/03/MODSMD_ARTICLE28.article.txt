# Water polo wins Nor Cal Tournament
## 
### Kyle Utsumi Staff writer 
After having its season-opening six game win
ning streak broken a week ago by California, the
Stanford men's water polo team looked to turn
things around.
Coach Dante Dettamanti's No. 1 squad got
just what the doctor ordered this weekend, as it
racked up six wins in three days, including the
championship of the 12-team Northern Califor
nia Tournament, held at deGuerre Pool.
The Cardinal (12-1) started its latest unbeaten
streak by downing No. 8 UC-Santa Barbara on
Thursday, 14-5. Friday, Stanford played host to
No. 12 Cal State Long Beach, handing the 49ers a
14-7 defeat.
The same teams faced off again on Saturday in
the opening round of the Nor Cal Tourney, with
the Cardinal prevailing 12-8 over Santa Barbara
and 12-4 over Long Beach St. to qualify for Sun
day's semi-final round.
In semi-final action, Stanford handed No. 4
UCLA a 13-12 loss. The close final score did not
paint an accurate picture of the game, according
to Dettamanti.
"We just couldn't quite put them away," Det
tamanti said. "We got ahead by three goals four
different times in the game, but it seemed like
they just kept plugging back. We had control the
whole way."
Stanford held a two-point advantage at 13-11
when a Cardinal player committed an ejection
foul. Dettamanti instructed his team to protect
against a two-point shot, giving the Bruins an
easy one-pointer which provided the game's final
goal with just a few seconds left in the contest.
"We had the lead from the second quarter on,"
Dettamanti said. "Once you get a lead in a semi
final, you tend to rest up a little because you know
you have one more game to go."
The game was highlighted by Stanford's
strong inside play. Senior holeman Frank Schnei
der led the team with four goals, scoring from
close range three times. Sophomore Brian Wallin
added a pair of goals.
"The key to the game was mismatches at two
meters," Dettamanti said. "We knew that UCLA
didn't have enough defense to guard all three of
our holemen."
In the other semi-final matchup, No. 2 USC
handed No. 3 Cal their worst defeat in several
years, completely dominating the Golden Bears
on the way to a 12-6 victory.
The explosive USC offense was held in check in
the final, however, as the Cardinal played tightly,
allowing only seven goals and frustrating the Tro
jan shooters. The final score of 8-7 marked the
second time Stanford has defeated USC this year.

ber, with Stanford prevailing 15-11.
Dettamanti was pleased with his
team's victory, which was earned
without the services of leading scorer
and captain, senior Wolf Wigo. Wigo
played in Saturday's games before
going out of town for family business
on Sunday.
"The key to winning this game
was keeping the score down," Detta
manti said "They have some guys
who can really light it up."
Two of USC's newcomers this
year are sophomores Marko Zagar
and Hrvoje Cizmic, both from Croat
ia Both were held in check by Stan
ford defenders for most of the con
test.
,f We did a good job, considering
our two-meter guards were in foul
trouble early," Dettamanti said.
Juniors Jeremy Laster and Josh

Leachman both picked up their sec
ond personal fouls in the second
quarter. A player fouls out on the
third infraction.
"Brian Wallin stepped in and did a
good job for us," Dettamanti said.
"They (USC) are really physical in
there."
In a game that was close through
out — Stanford never trailed, but
never led by more than two goals —
junior Dan Hancock provided offen
sive spark for the Cardinal. He
scored to put Stanford up 6-4 in the
third period and again just one
minute into the final stanza to give
the Cardinal a 7-6 lead.
"Dante told us to go out and take
open shots," Hancock said. "We had
the green light. In the second half,
you could see that we were shooting
more aggressively."
Due to an injury to starter
Andrew Tinseth, the Trojans played
defense behind their second string
goaltender, Brendan Grubbs.
"We were challenging him, mak
ing him make difficult saves," Han

cock said. "Those are shots we prac
tice all day long."
Stanford also rallied behind the
outstanding goalie play of Jack
Bowen, who collected 13 saves in the
match.
"Jack had a great game," Detta
manti said. "They were so frustrated
they started shooting lob shots from
way out."
The game and the tournament
championship was sealed with 1:44
remaining when Schneider lobbed
the ball over the outstretched arms
of Grubbs at the end of a Cardinal
fast break.
For USC, the sight of Schneider
putting the final nail in their coffin is
all too familiar — it was his goal late
in the fourth quarter that clinched
the national championship for the
Cardinal at the NCAA Tournament.
For Stanford, this season contin
ues to parallel 1993. In defending its
titles at both the Southern Cal and
Nor Cal Tournaments, the Cardinal
continues to focus on its ultimate
goal — defending the NCAA crown.

"The key to winning this game

our two-meter guards were in foul

Juniors Jeremy Laster and Josh

quarter. A player fouls out on the
third infraction.
"Brian Wallin stepped in and did a

"They (USC) are really physical in
there."
In a game that was close through
out — Stanford never trailed, but
never led by more than two goals —
junior Dan Hancock provided offen
sive spark for the Cardinal. He
scored to put Stanford up 6-4 in the
third period and again just one
minute into the final stanza to give
the Cardinal a 7-6 lead.
"Dante told us to go out and take
open shots," Hancock said. "We had
the green light. In the second half,
you could see that we were shooting
more aggressively."
Due to an injury to starter
Andrew Tinseth, the Trojans played
defense behind their second string
goaltender, Brendan Grubbs.
"We were challenging him, mak
ing him make difficult saves," Han

cock said. "Those are shots we prac
tice all day long."
Stanford also rallied behind the
outstanding goalie play of Jack
Bowen, who collected 13 saves in the
match.
"Jack had a great game," Detta
manti said. "They were so frustrated
they started shooting lob shots from
way out."
The game and the tournament
championship was sealed with 1:44
remaining when Schneider lobbed
the ball over the outstretched arms
of Grubbs at the end of a Cardinal
fast break.
For USC, the sight of Schneider
putting the final nail in their coffin is
all too familiar — it was his goal late
in the fourth quarter that clinched
the national championship for the
Cardinal at the NCAA Tournament.
For Stanford, this season contin
ues to parallel 1993. In defending its
titles at both the Southern Cal and
Nor Cal Tournaments, the Cardinal
continues to focus on its ultimate
goal — defending the NCAA crown.
After having its season-opening six game win
ning streak broken a week ago by California, the
Stanford men's water polo team looked to turn
things around.
Coach Dante Dettamanti's No. 1 squad got
just what the doctor ordered this weekend, as it
racked up six wins in three days, including the
championship of the 12-team Northern Califor
nia Tournament, held at deGuerre Pool.
The Cardinal (12-1) started its latest unbeaten
streak by downing No. 8 UC-Santa Barbara on
Thursday, 14-5. Friday, Stanford played host to
No. 12 Cal State Long Beach, handing the 49ers a
14-7 defeat.
The same teams faced off again on Saturday in
the opening round of the Nor Cal Tourney, with
the Cardinal prevailing 12-8 over Santa Barbara
and 12-4 over Long Beach St. to qualify for Sun
day's semi-final round.
In semi-final action, Stanford handed No. 4
UCLA a 13-12 loss. The close final score did not
paint an accurate picture of the game, according
to Dettamanti.
"We just couldn't quite put them away," Det
tamanti said. "We got ahead by three goals four
different times in the game, but it seemed like
they just kept plugging back. We had control the
whole way."
Stanford held a two-point advantage at 13-11
when a Cardinal player committed an ejection
foul. Dettamanti instructed his team to protect
against a two-point shot, giving the Bruins an
easy one-pointer which provided the game's final
goal with just a few seconds left in the contest.
"We had the lead from the second quarter on,"
Dettamanti said. "Once you get a lead in a semi
final, you tend to rest up a little because you know
you have one more game to go."
The game was highlighted by Stanford's
strong inside play. Senior holeman Frank Schnei
der led the team with four goals, scoring from
close range three times. Sophomore Brian Wallin
added a pair of goals.
"The key to the game was mismatches at two
meters," Dettamanti said. "We knew that UCLA
didn't have enough defense to guard all three of
our holemen."
In the other semi-final matchup, No. 2 USC
handed No. 3 Cal their worst defeat in several
years, completely dominating the Golden Bears
on the way to a 12-6 victory.
The explosive USC offense was held in check in
the final, however, as the Cardinal played tightly,
allowing only seven goals and frustrating the Tro
jan shooters. The final score of 8-7 marked the
second time Stanford has defeated USC this year.

Dettamanti was pleased with his
team's victory, which was earned
without the services of leading scorer
and captain, senior Wolf Wigo. Wigo

going out of town for family business
