# Water polo wins Nor Cal Tournament
## 
### Kyle Utsumi Staff writer 
After having its season-opening six game win
ning streak broken a week ago by California, the
Stanford men's water polo team looked to turn
things around.
Coach Dante Dettamanti's No. 1 squad got
just what the doctor ordered this weekend, as it
racked up six wins in three days, including the
championship of the 12-team Northern Califor
nia Tournament, held at deGuerre Pool.
The Cardinal (12-1) started its latest unbeaten
streak by downing No. 8 UC-Santa Barbara on
Thursday, 14-5. Friday, Stanford played host to
No. 12 Cal State Long Beach, handing the 49ers a
14-7 defeat.
The same teams faced off again on Saturday in
the opening round of the Nor Cal Tourney, with
the Cardinal prevailing 12-8 over Santa Barbara
and 12-4 over Long Beach St. to qualify for Sun
day's semi-final round.
In semi-final action, Stanford handed No. 4
UCLA a 13-12 loss. The close final score did not
paint an accurate picture of the game, according
to Dettamanti.
"We just couldn't quite put them away," Det
tamanti said. "We got ahead by three goals four
different times in the game, but it seemed like
they just kept plugging back. We had control the
whole way."
Stanford held a two-point advantage at 13-11
when a Cardinal player committed an ejection
foul. Dettamanti instructed his team to protect
against a two-point shot, giving the Bruins an
easy one-pointer which provided the game's final
goal with just a few seconds left in the contest.
"We had the lead from the second quarter on,"
Dettamanti said. "Once you get a lead in a semi
final, you tend to rest up a little because you know
you have one more game to go."
The game was highlighted by Stanford's
strong inside play. Senior holeman Frank Schnei
der led the team with four goals, scoring from
close range three times. Sophomore Brian Wallin
added a pair of goals.
"The key to the game was mismatches at two
meters," Dettamanti said. "We knew that UCLA
didn't have enough defense to guard all three of
our holemen."
In the other semi-final matchup, No. 2 USC
handed No. 3 Cal their worst defeat in several
years, completely dominating the Golden Bears
on the way to a 12-6 victory.
The explosive USC offense was held in check in
the final, however, as the Cardinal played tightly,
allowing only seven goals and frustrating the Tro
jan shooters. The final score of 8-7 marked the
second time Stanford has defeated USC this year.
