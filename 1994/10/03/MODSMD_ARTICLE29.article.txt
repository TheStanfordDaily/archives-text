# Spikers shoot Ducks, skin Beavers
## 
### Seth Goldstein Staff writer 
With the spotted owl protected
by federal government, the No. 1
Stanford women's volleyball team
decided to hunt ducks and beavers
on its northwest excursion this
weekend.
The Cardinal handed Oregon
State (9-6 overall, 1-5 in the Pacif
ic 10 Conference) a straight-game
(15-4, 15-12, 15-1) loss in Corvallis
on Friday night and registered
another sweep (15-2, 15-7, 15-9)
over Oregon (6-8, 0-6) in Eugene
on Saturday. The victories, Stan
ford's first Pac-10 road wins of the
young season, ran Stanford's
record to an unblemished 11-0
overall and 5-0 in the conference.
"We played well," said Stanford
head coach Don Shaw. "Those
were some pretty convincing victo
ries in unfriendly territory. They
were both good wins for us."
Isn't any win a good win, by def
inition? Not necessarily, according
to Shaw. If an opponent doesn't
play well enough to make a team
work for a victory, then the win
doesn't teach the victor anything
useful for the future. Luckily for
the Stanford squad, the Oregon
schools played tougher than the
scores might suggest.
"This being my first [collegiatel
year, I don't know what to expect,
so I assume that every team is
going to be competitive," said
freshman hitter Kristin Folkl.
"The Oregons didn't prove me
wrong. Both were extremely scrap
py defensively and both were good
blocking teams."

The tough defense of the
Beavers and Ducks forced Stanford
to fine tune its offensive scheme.
In the Oregon State match, six
players had over 10 attack

attempts.
"The smarter shots worked
more than the power game," Folkl
said. "We had to work to find the
open spots in their defense, instead

of just hitting through them."
Shaw agreed with this assess
ment.

Senior captain Anne Wicks goes for the dig against California last week. This past weekend, Wicks
helped the Cardinal prevail over both Oregon and Oregon State in straight games.
"The key to both matches was
good passing," he said. "We were
able to spread the floor really well
so they couldn't gang up on any
one of our hitters, while we forced
them to rely on only one or two of
theirs."
The Beavers were held to just a
.028 hitting percentage, while the
Cardinal managed a more than
respectable .294. Folkl led the way
with 13 kills and a .423 average,
while classmate Lisa Sharpley
added seven kills and a .357 per
centage to go with her team-high

19 assists. Junior hitter Marnie
Triefenbach also contributed with
nine kills.
For the first time this year,
Shaw tried to stay with just a few
of the players from his talented
group. Folkl, Sharpley, Triefen
bach, freshman blocker Barbara
Ifejika, junior setter Cary Wendell
and senior blocker Anne Wicks
started and saw most of the play
ing time. Up to this point in the
season, the Cardinal had used a
dozen different lineups while try
ing to learn where each player's
special talent or skill was.
"We were playing two good
teams at their home courts and I
felt that going into this stretch we
needed to get some continuity into

the lineup," Shaw said. "Our main
goal was to go up there with a set
lineup and have them play togeth
er."
Shaw's machinations worked
out quite well. By the Oregon
match, the Stanford squad looked
like a well-oiled machine. This
bodes well for the Cardinal, which
faces fourth-ranked UCLA and
No. 13 USC on consecutive
evenings this upcoming weekend.
"Our offense is definitely com
ing around," Shaw said. "And
we're siding out real well. That's
great, because no matter how hard
the other team hits the ball, as
long as you keep siding out, even if
you're not scoring, they can't
either."
