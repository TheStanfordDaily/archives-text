# Spikers shoot Ducks, skin Beavers

### Seth Goldstein Staff writer 
With the spotted owl protected
by federal government, the No. 1
Stanford women's volleyball team
decided to hunt ducks and beavers
on its northwest excursion this
weekend.
The Cardinal handed Oregon
State (9-6 overall, 1-5 in the Pacif
ic 10 Conference) a straight-game
(15-4, 15-12, 15-1) loss in Corvallis
on Friday night and registered
another sweep (15-2, 15-7, 15-9)
over Oregon (6-8, 0-6) in Eugene
on Saturday. The victories, Stan
ford's first Pac-10 road wins of the
young season, ran Stanford's
record to an unblemished 11-0
overall and 5-0 in the conference.
"We played well," said Stanford
head coach Don Shaw. "Those
were some pretty convincing victo
ries in unfriendly territory. They
were both good wins for us."
Isn't any win a good win, by def
inition? Not necessarily, according
to Shaw. If an opponent doesn't
play well enough to make a team
work for a victory, then the win
doesn't teach the victor anything
useful for the future. Luckily for
the Stanford squad, the Oregon
schools played tougher than the
scores might suggest.
"This being my first [collegiatel
year, I don't know what to expect,
so I assume that every team is
going to be competitive," said
freshman hitter Kristin Folkl.
"The Oregons didn't prove me
wrong. Both were extremely scrap
py defensively and both were good
blocking teams."

The tough defense of the
Beavers and Ducks forced Stanford
to fine tune its offensive scheme.
In the Oregon State match, six
players had over 10 attack

attempts.
"The smarter shots worked
more than the power game," Folkl
said. "We had to work to find the
open spots in their defense, instead

of just hitting through them."
Shaw agreed with this assess
ment.
