## Cardinal wins Invite 
### Todd Bernstein 
During last Saturday's Stan
ford Invitational, cross country
teams expecting to run their races
amidst the lush, green fairways of
the Stanford Golf Course were
greeted instead with a host of red
ahead of them.
The third-ranked Cardinal
women continued their winning
ways, finishing first in both the
open and invitational races, while
their 16th-ranked male counter
parts placed second in both meets
behind a strong Arizona team.
In regard to the women, Stan
ford won the invitational with 63
points, leaving national power
Brigham Young (91) and Pacific
10 Conference contender UCLA
(87) well behind. Two freshmen,
Sarna Renfro and Kortney Dun
scombe, paved the way for the
women in red, coming in third
and fifth, respectively. Renfro
posted a time of 17 minutes and
39 seconds, while Dunscombe
came in at 17:42. Also finishing
in the top-20 were sophomores
Leila Burr, who came in 16th,
and Monal Choksi, who placed
19th.
Unfortunately for the Cardi
nal's future opponents, Stanford
did not put together its best meet,
according to head coach Vin
Lananna.
"It wasn't our best perfor
mance," Lananna said. "We got a
little anxious and went out too
fast, but that's all part of it.
We've been progressing nicely . . .

anytime you can beat five teams
in the top 20 you're doing well."
In the open race, the Stanford
women finished two in the top
five en route to a 53 point victory.
Freshman Ryan Thomas lead the
way finishing third with a time of
19:01. Senior Andrea Garner,
also turned in a strong perfor
mance, placing just one second
behind Thomas for fifth.
"It's really important for our
program for the women to do so
well in the open race," Lananna
said. "It shows our depth, in that
we have so many strong, young
runners."
As for the Cardinal men, the
squad's 57 points in the invita
tional race placed them well
ahead of UCLA (135), California
(145) and BYU (163) and just 10
points short of the Wildcats (47).
Sophomore Greg Jimmerson fin
ished the day as the Cardinal's
top performer, coming in fifth
overall with a time of 25:04. His
high placement was not only
important to the team â€” it held
significance for Jimmerson per
sonally.
"I think the race for me was a
big step in the right direction for
what I want to do in the season
and in the Pacific 10 Conference
championships," he said.
Sophomores J.J. White and
Bryan Zmijewski also turned in
notable performances for the Car
dinal, capturing tenth and
eleventh place respectively.
