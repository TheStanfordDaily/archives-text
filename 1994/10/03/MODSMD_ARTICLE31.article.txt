# Golfers dive in
## Women open season in Nike Intercollegiate tournament against NCAA champ Sun Devils 
### Emory Chen Staff writer 
Tiger Woods — he of the great golf
name — may grab all the headlines, but
do not make a mistake by overlooking
the Stanford women's golf team.
Coming off last year's seventh-place
finish at the NCAA Championships, the
Cardinal, currently ranked sixth by Golf
World Magazine, will again make an
attempt for the national title, beginning
its quest today and tomorrow in the
Nike Intercollegiate held in Corvallis,
Oregon.
The 18-team tournament will test
Stanford with the likes of two-time
defending national champion Arizona
State, third-ranked UCLA, and 12th
ranked Arizona.
For most teams, the tourney will be
their second or third of the year. Stan
ford, however, will make its '94-'95 sea
son debut at the Intercollegiate.
"We may be a little rusty at the start
but we should be very competitive," said
coach Tim Baldwin.
Indeed, four returning starters,
including two pre-season All-Americans,
look to guide the Cardinal to victory at
the Intercollegiate and perhaps to an
eventual national crown.
Mhairi McKay, a First Team All-

American last year as a freshman and a
pre-season All-American, will lead the
Cardinal as the squad's No. 1 golfer.
McKay, Stanford's outstanding fresh
man woman athlete last year, is assisted
by Andrea Baxter, who will start at No.
2. Baxter, a sophomore, is Stanford's
other pre-season All-American. She
exploded into the national spotlight
after a semifinalist finish at the US
Amateurs this summer.
Senior Jamille Jose will swing at No.
3 for the Cardinal. Jose tied for 32nd in
the NCAA Championships last season
and is looking to improve. Another
senior, Amy Lawrence, will start at
number four and Vicky Strada, a junior,
rounds out the starting lineup.
Whether or not the women feel pre
pared to embark on their title quest
beginning with such a major tourna
ment, the Intercollegiate gets underway
today with a shotgun start at 8:00 a.m.
and continues at 1:00 p.m. with the sec
ond round.
The final round will take place tomor
row at 8:00 am. Even if Stanford fails to
take home first place, the team will have
many chances to prove its ability, as
Stanford will play in more than 10 tour
naments this season, culminating in the
NCAA Championships, held this year in
Wilmington, N.C.
