# ASSU plans year without funding
## University subsidy discontinued 
### Beth Berselli Senior staff writer 
As the ASSU begins its first
year without any financial sup
port from the University, senate
leaders are altering the group's fi
nancial strategies in order to com
pensate for the lack of funds.
The ASSU has begun looking
for new ways to support its pro
grams — by rethinking long-term
investment strategy and expand
ing its business projects to include
the Stanford Design Group and
the Recreation Center.
For example, the ASSU is con
sidering creating an endowment,
which would allow the organiza
tion to invest a portion of its re

serve funds in a long-term, inter
est-bearing account, said ASSU
Financial Manager Gabe Lucas, a
senior.
The University began curtail
ing its funding of the ASSU three
years ago. It contributed $47, 540
last year, compared to $154,517 in
1991-92.
Last year's University subsidy
paid for the ASSU audit, the
salaries of two students on the
University Nomination Commit
tee and the ASSU banking system,
which is used by all on-campus
student groups, Lucas said.
In the past, the University also
has funded the ASSU spring elec

to establish an

ASSU endowment, which last
year's financial manager, Brian
Hillger, began researching. Cur
rent ASSU leaders will work with
the group's professional consul
tants to explore such a plan's fea
sibility, Lucas said.
If the senate decides to estab
lish an endowment, the ASSU
must also develop a policy on the
use of endowment funds, includ
ing how long to invest and at what
percentage, Lucas said.
The ASSU already has long
term investments — generating
$60,000 in this year's budget. But
the endowment would be "one
step further to creating greater
yields," Lucas added.
The \SSU will also study ways
to improve and expand its busi
ness projects, Lucas said.
"We'll look at how we can
lower expenses and raise incomes
of all t he projects," he said.

The senate is expected to
approve two new business pro
jects tomorrow, increasing the
total number of projects to nine.
Lucas said the Stanford Design
Group and the Recreation Center
will serve as "blankets of insur
ance" to help reach the $90,000
estimated income from all ASSU
business projects.
The loss of University support
has positive and negative ramifi
cations, "depending on whom you
talk to," Lucas said.
On the negative side, the ASSU
now has a much "leaner budget
and can no longer as easily pro
vide programs and services that it
did just a few short years ago,"
Lucas said.
Some students, however, say
the elimination of University
funding won't hurt the ASSU.
Senior Mork Murdock, a Coun
cil of Presidents member, said the

change will instead put the organi
zation "in a position of autonomy."
Lucas agreed that "decision
making is now in the hands of the
ASSU."
While the ASSU has always
been "ostensibly" independent
from the University, in previous
years it's been "unclear whose
role is what," Lucas said.
Deciding what the new rela
tionship between the University
and the ASSU will be is "clearly
an issue," Lucas said, adding that
student leaders plan to consider
the matter.
The loss of University funding
is a good move in the long run,
said ASSU Senate Chair Nawwar
Kasrawi, a co-terminal student.
"It completes our separation
from the University," Kasrawi
said. "We're essentially in control
of our own affairs. We see it as a
challenge."
