# No free speakers for fee-refunders
## 
### Jamie Taylor Staff writer 
Almost 5,000 students last year
logged on to Axess to get their spe
cial-fee money back from the
ASSU.
But this year, the Speakers Bu
reau wants students to think twice
before asking for another check.
The group plans to charge stu
dents who request their refunds
from the Speakers Bureau $7.50
for each Speakers Bureau-spon
sored event they attend.
"Fee refunds are killing us,"
said Scott Moss, director of the
Speakers Bureau, a student group
sponsored by the ASSU that
brings various speakers to campus
and also sponsors panel discus
sions and debates.
"Last year, nearly 40 percent of
students refunded their fee, and

then attended our events," Moss
said. "It's dishonest."
The Speakers' Bureau has lined
up Naomi Wolf, John Sununu and
Camile Paglia to come to campus
this fall, with James Carville, Is
abel Allende and Edward Albee
speaking in the winter and spring.
Although Moss said that the
Bureau is happy with the speakers
coming this year, he added that "if
this (fee refunding) keeps up, we
will have fewer and lousier speak
ers on campus."
Refund rates for ail ASSU spe
cial fee-funded groups have been
rising for the past two years, from
19 percent in 1992 to 25 percent in
1993 to the current rate of 39 per
cent, Moss said.
Attributing this rise to the
growing awareness that refunds

tin refund policy.

which students requested refunds
from them and deny them free
services.
Senate chair Nawwar Kasrawi
said this right had always existed
in the ASSU constitution, but
added that there was a conflicting
by-law which required the Speak
ers Bureau to provide free admis
sion to all Stanford affiliates.
"It's important that people
understand the commitment they
assume, when they refund a fee,
not to use services that student
fees support," Kasrawi said.
Moss said, however, that he
believes many refunders don't
honor this commitment.
Although the Speakers Bureau
refund rate has more than dou
bled in the last two years, he said,
attendance at its events has sky

rocketed.
"The refund system is inane,"
he said. "There is no way to
enforce it — it relies on good faith.
Call me a cynic, but good faith is
falling apart."
The Speakers Bureau, howev
er, has more power than other
groups to supervise refunders.
"For example, KZSU can't con
trol who listens to the radio
waves," Moss said. "Rut because
we sell tickets, we can check to
see who has refunded their fee."
The Speakers Rureau will have
a list of all refunders available
where tickets for its events are
sold. Moss stressed that "this is
going to be of no inconvenience. . .
. It only takes a few extra seconds
to look up someone's name in a
book."

Other services sponsored by
student fees have already asserted
their right to deny service to those
who have refunded their money.
The ASSU Legal Counseling Ser
vice, which provides free legal aid,
has always denied refunders; its
refund rate is one of the lowest
among all student-sponsored
organizations.
While Moss said he anticipates
general support for the new policy,
he added that he suspects that
"maybe some of those 39 percent
(of fee refunders) will get ticked, so
there's a risk in this, because we
have to get approved every year by
a majority of the students."
The Speakers Rureau also
charges people who are not affili
ated with Stanford $50 per series
to attend their events.
