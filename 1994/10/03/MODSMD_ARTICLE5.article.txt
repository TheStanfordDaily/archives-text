# No free speakers for fee-refunders

### Jamie Taylor Staff writer 
Almost 5,000 students last year
logged on to Axess to get their spe
cial-fee money back from the
ASSU.
But this year, the Speakers Bu
reau wants students to think twice
before asking for another check.
The group plans to charge stu
dents who request their refunds
from the Speakers Bureau $7.50
for each Speakers Bureau-spon
sored event they attend.
"Fee refunds are killing us,"
said Scott Moss, director of the
Speakers Bureau, a student group
sponsored by the ASSU that
brings various speakers to campus
and also sponsors panel discus
sions and debates.
"Last year, nearly 40 percent of
students refunded their fee, and

then attended our events," Moss
said. "It's dishonest."
The Speakers' Bureau has lined
up Naomi Wolf, John Sununu and
Camile Paglia to come to campus
this fall, with James Carville, Is
abel Allende and Edward Albee
speaking in the winter and spring.
Although Moss said that the
Bureau is happy with the speakers
coming this year, he added that "if
this (fee refunding) keeps up, we
will have fewer and lousier speak
ers on campus."
Refund rates for ail ASSU spe
cial fee-funded groups have been
rising for the past two years, from
19 percent in 1992 to 25 percent in
1993 to the current rate of 39 per
cent, Moss said.
Attributing this rise to the
growing awareness that refunds
