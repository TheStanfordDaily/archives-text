coordinators have a little more cause
for excitement as they gear up for the
coming year. Today, they usher in a
new director whose enthusiasm and
hopes for the program loom high.

Adrienne Jamison, a political sci

places Communications Prof. Emeri
tus Elie Abel, who is ret'ring from the
Washington program. Jamison will
work part-time on campus until mid-
November, and then move to Washing
ton at the end of the quarter.
"I think it's an absolutely terrific se

lection," said program coordinator,
Jeanne Wahl Halleck, who has known
Jamison for more than eight years.
According to Halleck, the selection
committee is delighted with Jamison —
who was chosen in August —and be
lieves she will make a "great director."
"I'm extremely pleased," said Jami
son. "It's a wonderful position in that

there's a real mix in what's involved."
Before accepting the Stanford in
Washington directorship, Jamison, age
40, worked six years as assistant direc
tor of UC-Berkeley's Institute of Gov
ernmental Services, a research insti
