# New SIW director heads to the Farm today
## 
### September Treviño Staff writer 
This fall, Stanford in Washington
coordinators have a little more cause
for excitement as they gear up for the
coming year. Today, they usher in a
new director whose enthusiasm and
hopes for the program loom high.

Adrienne Jamison, a political sci
ence professor from UC-Berkeley, re
places Communications Prof. Emeri
tus Elie Abel, who is ret'ring from the
Washington program. Jamison will
work part-time on campus until mid-
November, and then move to Washing
ton at the end of the quarter.
"I think it's an absolutely terrific se

lection," said program coordinator,
Jeanne Wahl Halleck, who has known
Jamison for more than eight years.
According to Halleck, the selection
committee is delighted with Jamison —
who was chosen in August —and be
lieves she will make a "great director."
"I'm extremely pleased," said Jami
son. "It's a wonderful position in that

there's a real mix in what's involved."
Before accepting the Stanford in
Washington directorship, Jamison, age
40, worked six years as assistant direc
tor of UC-Berkeley's Institute of Gov
ernmental Services, a research insti
tute specializing in American politics
and public policy.
She also taught American pol
itics at Berkeley for the past three
years while pursuing a Ph.D. in
political science, and is currently
finishing her dissertation.
Jamison has already spent con
siderable time in the nation's cap
ital. Upon completing her mas
ter's degree in public policy at
Berkeley, Jamison worked in
Washington for the U.S. Senate,
the Congressional Budget Office

and the Environmental Law
Institute.
As director of Stanford in
Washington, some of Jamison's
responsibilities will include plac
ing students in internships and
teaching a few required seminars.
The Stanford in Washington
Program is "the best of its sort"
for undergraduates, said Jami
son, adding that she believes its
greatest asset is the quality of its
students, internship placements
and teaching.
"Students have a real opportu
nity to get involved in the policy
making process," Jamison said.
Jamison hopes to expand the

range of internships, increase the
number of faculty who participate
in the program, possibly create a
more formal summer program,
and eventually develop new "spe
cial topics" like winter quarter's
environmental theme.
But how does Jamison feel
about turning in her blue and gold
for cardinal red?
"I don't know what I'll do on
Big Game weekend," Jamison
said, laughing.
The Stanford in Washington
directorship is an endowed posi
tion sponsored by George and
Mary Lou Boone, members of the
Stanford in Washington Council.
