# Olympian visits Farm
## Morales back in familiar waters 
### Allyson Mizoguchi Editorial staff 
Pablo Morales, the most suc
cessful swimmer in NCAA histo
ry and three-time Olympic gold
medalist, returned to the Stan
ford scene to sign autographs at
the Track House last Friday af
ternoon. The exceedingly talent
ed yet modest champion signed
posters and pictures, answered
questions and chatted with fans
for several hours.
Morales, 29, led Stanford to
three consecutive NCAA crowns
during his collegiate career from
1984 through 1987. A master at
both the 100 and 200-meter but
terfly and the 200-meter indi
vidual medley, he captured an
unprecedented 11 NCAA titles.
"The Stanford experience
was thoroughly enriching acad
emically, athletically and social
ly," he said, looking back on his
years at the Farm. "Athletically,
it was a great experience for me,
having such fine athletes to
train with. It was as if Stanford
was a Utopia ... I couldn't have
asked for a better situation."

For his many achievements,
Morales was selected to the 1987
Academic All-American First
Team and was the co-winner in
the 1987 A 1 Masters Award,
Stanford's most prestigious
honor for athletic and academic
leadership.
Morales keeps close ties with
Stanford today by appearing at
public events on campus, and
stays particularly active with
the swimming program through
training and coaching. He re
turns such favors to the univer
sity because he attributes much
of his success to his college
years.
Believing he is "goal-orient
ed, not afraid to fail, friendly
and happy," Morales said, "I
think Stanford has a lot to do
with all that."
The swimmer had just en
tered college when he estab
lished an American record in the
200-meter butterfly at the 1984
Los Angeles Olympics. It was a
hugely successful summer for
Morales, as he took home one
gold and two silver medals. The
