# Olympian visits Farm
## Morales back in familiar waters 
### Allyson Mizoguchi Editorial staff 
Pablo Morales, the most suc
cessful swimmer in NCAA histo
ry and three-time Olympic gold
medalist, returned to the Stan
ford scene to sign autographs at
the Track House last Friday af
ternoon. The exceedingly talent
ed yet modest champion signed
posters and pictures, answered
questions and chatted with fans
for several hours.
Morales, 29, led Stanford to
three consecutive NCAA crowns
during his collegiate career from
1984 through 1987. A master at
both the 100 and 200-meter but
terfly and the 200-meter indi
vidual medley, he captured an
unprecedented 11 NCAA titles.
"The Stanford experience
was thoroughly enriching acad
emically, athletically and social
ly," he said, looking back on his
years at the Farm. "Athletically,
it was a great experience for me,
having such fine athletes to
train with. It was as if Stanford
was a Utopia ... I couldn't have
asked for a better situation."

For his many achievements,
Morales was selected to the 1987
Academic All-American First
Team and was the co-winner in
the 1987 A 1 Masters Award,
Stanford's most prestigious
honor for athletic and academic
leadership.
Morales keeps close ties with
Stanford today by appearing at
public events on campus, and
stays particularly active with
the swimming program through
training and coaching. He re
turns such favors to the univer
sity because he attributes much
of his success to his college
years.
Believing he is "goal-orient
ed, not afraid to fail, friendly
and happy," Morales said, "I
think Stanford has a lot to do
with all that."
The swimmer had just en
tered college when he estab
lished an American record in the
200-meter butterfly at the 1984
Los Angeles Olympics. It was a
hugely successful summer for
Morales, as he took home one
gold and two silver medals. The

100-meter butterfly world
record he set at the World
Championship trials in 1986
still stands.
Following graduation,
Morales trained for the 1988
Olympic Games, only he failed
to qualify.
This disappointing setback
altered his life course, as soon
afterwards he decided to work
in a law firm and then studied
law at Cornell University for
two years. He still had his
sights on the 1992 Olympic
Games, however.
In preparation for the next
Games, Morales took a break
from law school and trained
with the Stanford men swim
mers.
His rigorous training paid
off as he clinched the gold in
the 100-meter butterfly by just
three one-hundredths of a sec
ond. He brought home a sec
ond gold medal from Barcelona
in the 400-meter medley relay,
helping the USA team tie the
World Record with his butter
fly leg.
This inspirational comeback
for Morales was a springboard
into stardom, yet the athlete
insists that he is the same per
son with or without the
Olympic medals.
"In all honesty, I don't see
myself as famous," he said.
"I'm a normal person . . .If
somebody recognizes me on
the street, it's a surprise."
In May of this year, Morales
graduated from Cornell and
begins work today at a law
firm in San Jose. While he
embarks on this new life, how
ever, he retains the dedication
to athletics which made him so
successful.
"Athletics are great
whether you have aspirations
to be a gold-medal athlete or
not," Morales said. "A lot of
lessons that I've learned in life
come from swimming
. . .learning to deal with adver
sity, learning goal orientation
and how to focus."
Although he no longer
trains seriously, Morales
remains very involved in
sports in order to balance out
his non-athletic responsibili
ties.
"An active body is a healthy
body," he said. "I'm a believer
in making the most of mind
and body."
