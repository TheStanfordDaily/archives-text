# After controversial predecessors...
## New Irish group forms 
### Megan Himan Staff writer 
Organizers of the Stanford
Irish Association weren't con
cerned about picking sides in last
Saturday's football game against
the Fighting Irish of Notre Dame.
Electrical engineering gradu
ate student Todd Whitehurst, one
of the student organizers of the
group, didn't even know that
Stanford was playing the Irish.
Sports definitely isn't the focus
of the Stanford Irish Association,
nor is the group a social club, ac
cording to Asian Languages grad
uate student Paul Atkins.
"Our emphasis for the group is
educational," Atkins said. "We
are interested in dispelling a lot of
the stereotypes people have about
Ireland and Irish culture. I want
to stress that we are very serious."
In the spring of 1993, seniors

ever, was not formed in response
to any such issues, Curran said.
"People just assumed that the
only reason we would start a
group like that would be as a
statement against multicultural
ism," Curran said. "We never
were a white backlash group."
Most of the protest stemmed
from ignorance about the group,
Curran added.
"Part of the reason there were
so many questions is that we re
ceived so much publicity so fast,"
he said. "We received national
media coverage before we even
had our second meeting."
On campus, the group received
a lot of criticism. "[Student]
groups thought we were joking,"
Hammel said. "They thought that
we were parodying multicultural
ism."
The group dissolved due to a
lack of time commitment by its or
ganizers. "The leadership last
year didn't have enough time to
get things off the ground," Cur
