# After controversial predecessors...
## New Irish group forms 
### Megan Himan Staff writer 
Organizers of the Stanford
Irish Association weren't con
cerned about picking sides in last
Saturday's football game against
the Fighting Irish of Notre Dame.
Electrical engineering gradu
ate student Todd Whitehurst, one
of the student organizers of the
group, didn't even know that
Stanford was playing the Irish.
Sports definitely isn't the focus
of the Stanford Irish Association,
nor is the group a social club, ac
cording to Asian Languages grad
uate student Paul Atkins.
"Our emphasis for the group is
educational," Atkins said. "We
are interested in dispelling a lot of
the stereotypes people have about
Ireland and Irish culture. I want
to stress that we are very serious."
In the spring of 1993, seniors
Chip Curran and Jim Hammel at
tempted to found a similar group
focusing on Irish education, but it
just "fizzled out," Whitehurst
said.
Named the Irish American
Student Association, the group
received national attention be
cause many people perceived it as

linked to the multiculturalism de
bate on campus. The group, how
ever, was not formed in response
to any such issues, Curran said.
"People just assumed that the
only reason we would start a
group like that would be as a
statement against multicultural
ism," Curran said. "We never
were a white backlash group."
Most of the protest stemmed
from ignorance about the group,
Curran added.
"Part of the reason there were
so many questions is that we re
ceived so much publicity so fast,"
he said. "We received national
media coverage before we even
had our second meeting."
On campus, the group received
a lot of criticism. "[Student]
groups thought we were joking,"
Hammel said. "They thought that
we were parodying multicultural
ism."
The group dissolved due to a
lack of time commitment by its or
ganizers. "The leadership last
year didn't have enough time to
get things off the ground," Cur
ran said.
This September, sitting in a
local Irish pub, Whitehurst and
Atkins decided to form a new
group with the objective of "edu
cating ourselves about issues in
Ireland today and celebrating
Irish history and culture," White
hurst said.
The group received a new
name, the Stanford Irish Associa
tion, mainly because they "didn't
want anyone who wasn't Irish-
American or a student to be
excluded," Curran said.
Though many former Irish
American Student Association
members are active in the new
group, the Stanford Irish Associa
tion is trying to disassociate itself
from the former group, White
hurst said.
Nonetheless, Curran said he still
expects the Stanford Irish Associa
tion to receive some of the negative
campus reactions that the Irish
American Student Association
received in the past.
"No matter how well we run

the organization, people who
don't know much about us will
always be skeptical," he said. "I
just hope that people who are
informed about us will respect
what we are doing."
About 20 people met for an
organizational meeting last
Thursday in which they discussed
goals and ideas for the year,
including an Irish film series and
an Irish literature reading group,
Atkins said.
Human rights in Ireland and
the current political situation there
will also be topics of the group's
educational efforts, Hammel
added.
The group is also trying to edu
cate Stanford students about Ire
land and Irish culture through lit
erature and history classes. "If we
can show a history professor, for
example, that there is sufficient
interest perhaps they would teach
a class on modern Irish history,"
Curran said.
For winter quarter the group is
planning an early celebration of
St. Patrick's Day (since the holi
day coincides with finals), possibly
by holding an Irish film festival,

Atkins said.
The students had a table in
White Plaza daring the activities
fair last Tuesday, and about 80
interested people came by to
hear about the group, Curran
said.
"Our group is a bit distinctive
in that we're reaching out to
undergraduates and graduate stu
dents," Atkins said.
Despite their serious focus,
Whitehurst said that the group
will not be strictly academic. "A
few of us that are graduate stu
dents would like the opportunity
to get together at the local Irish
pub and listen to some music and
drink some Irish beer," said
Whitehurst.
The owner of O'Connells, an
Irish pub in Palo Alto, is support
ive of the group and has offered
his pub as a meeting spot for
them, Whitehurst said.
Members of the group, howev
er, emphasized that their events
would not be alcohol-based. "We
want to dispel the cheesy stereo
types about Ireland that include
Guinness beer and leprechauns,"
Hammel said.
