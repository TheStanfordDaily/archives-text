HOW TO HANG ON TO YOUR DOUGH.
( WITHOUT CRAMPING YOUR STYLE.)
Separate "needs" from "wants."
Hint: A bed is a need. A Mr. Microphone
is a want.
Split the bill but only pay your share.

if all you got was soup?
Set aside money for emergencies.
Unless youd rather call your parents

Have a Citibank Classic card in case you

emergency cash, a new card usually within
24 hours and help replacing vital documents.
