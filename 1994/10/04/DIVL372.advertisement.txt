Whether you're an undergraduate
or graduate student, Citibank has a
student loan to meet your needs.
If you're short on funds this semester, you're
not alone. During the 30 years we've been
in the student loan business, students have
often told us that they need extra money
during the course of the semester to pay for
tuition, books, and other expenses. If this
sounds familiar, you can count on Citibank,
the nation's Number One student loan
lender, to provide you with the best financial
aid products and services with these
important benefits:
■ No payments while you are in school
■ Low interest rates
■ Loans for students of all incomes
■ Monthly payments as low as $50
■ No penalty for early repayment
■ You don't have to be a current Citibank
customer to qualify!
The faster you respond, the faster we can
get you the funds you need. Or call us at
1-800-692-8200, ext. 614. Call today,
and we'll get an application out to you the
next business day!
