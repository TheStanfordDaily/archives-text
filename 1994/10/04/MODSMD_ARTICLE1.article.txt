# Minimal response
## Few professors making voluntary retirement plans 
### Josh Gohlke Staff writer 
When mandatory retirement in
universities became illegal last
year, Stanford tried to replace
force with persuasion.
Last May, the University insti
tuted the Faculty Retirement In
centive Program, which includes a
special cash bonus of twice their
salary for all professors over the
age of 60 who announce their re
tirement before the end of 1994.
But five months into the new
program, the University's schools
have not seen a major increase in
faculty retirements.
"We're not seeing major
changes because the program's so
young," said Kathy Gillam, associ
ate provost for student affairs. "It
didn't start until the end of last
year, so it's hard to say whether
more people are retiring than
would have retired without it."
Seven faculty members retired
at the end of the 1993-94 year, and
three more have announced that
they will retire during this acade
mic year, Gillam said.
"It's not as many as in the last
couple years," Gillam said. "A lot
of people retired under the old
plan, so we don't have a large
group of faculty waiting to retire."
Until 1993, faculty members
had to retire by the age of 70, and
the system in effect rewarded indi
viduals on the basis of several fac
tors, one of the most important of
which was the number of years
employed by the University.
John Shoven, dean of the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences, said only a "handful" of fac
ulty members in the school have
announced plans to retire. But he
said he would be "surprised" if the
number was not more than aver
age by the end of December.
"It's a little too soon to tell,"
Shoven said. "I expect a consider
able number of people will be tak
ing up the offer."
The new offer has so far not
had much effect in the Law
School either, said Frank Bruca
to, the school's associate dean for
administration.
Brucato said there has not
been a large exodus because of the
school's small number of senior
faculty and the fact that the new
program is not "overly generous."
All faculty who have taught for
at least 15 years are eligible for
the new program, which offers a

bonus based on the salaries and
ages of retiring faculty. The
salary is multiplied by two for
ages 60 to 65, 1.8 for age 66, 1.5
for age 67, 1.1 for age 68, and 0.6
for age 69. After age 69 the pro
gram offers no bonus.
However, all faculty members
age 60 or over — a total of about
200, Gillam said — will receive a
bonus equal to twice their salary
if they announce plans for retire
ment before the end of December.
This special one-time offer,
which Shoven once called a
"grand opening sale," would give
more to faculty members over the
age of 65, and especially those
over 69, who would receive less or
nothing under the new plan
beginning next year.
Gillam said she plans to send

letters to faculty members for
whom Dec. 31 is a "real live dead
line" to remind them of the possi
ble benefits.
Although the new system was
conceived primarily because of
the end of mandatory retirement,
it was also developed in order to
ensure revitalization through the
"infusion of younger faculty,"
Shoven said.
Gillam noted that Provost
Condoleezza Rice is interested in
recruiting junior faculty for new
spots, regardless of the outcome
of the program.
Younger faculty also represent
more starting salaries and less
tenured professors, and therefore
savings to the University that are
expected to eventually offset retire
ment bonuses currently offered.
