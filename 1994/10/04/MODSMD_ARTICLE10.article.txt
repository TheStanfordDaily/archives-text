# University to buy more bike racks
## 
### Laura Shin Staff writer 
Finding bike racks around
campus that are both safe and
easy to use may soon get a little
simpler.
The Transportation Pro
grams Planning Office has
decided to buy "more and better
bike racks" for the campus, in
order to ease overcrowded walk
ways and deter theft, said
Transportation Consultant
Patrick Siegman.
The Planning Office is cur
rently working on the design
and then will likely hire contrac
tors to build the racks. The
office has not yet decided which
locations will get the first of the
newly designed bike racks.
The office will be "starting
with . . . [areas wherel bikes are
getting locked to everything in
sight," he said.
The most problematic loca
tions include the Bookstore,
Tresidder Union, the History
Corner and Cubberley Auditori
um, "where [bikesJ get piled up
and block all the disabled access
ways," he said.
The office is still considering
purchasing ready-made bike
racks, instead of building its
own. But Siegman said none of
the commercially built ones
were as "durable and as thief
proof as we would like."

In a study conducted last
April, upside-down "U" racks —
such as the ones outside Green
Library — were found to be the
safest. The new ones will be sim
ilar in design, although they
need not be cemented into the
ground, Siegman said.
Two bars will lie at the bot
tom of both sides of the "U" to
hold four hoops each — for a
total of eight bikes per rack —
nullifying the need for cement
ing the racks into the ground.
Custom-built racks, Siegman
said, are often "cheaper to get"
than manufactured ones, which
must be shipped and are more
complex than the ones the Plan
ning Office favors.
Money for the project will
come from the University's
General Plant Improvement
Fund, Siegman said.
The Planning Office is also
exploring two other forms of
bike security: enclosed dorm
bike garages and bike lockers.
The bike lockers, primarily for
commuters, are more expensive,
costing about $850 each, and
have a separate key for each
locker rather than one key for
the entire garage.
In addition to easing the con
cern over bike theft, the Plan
ning Office hopes to prevent stu
dents from blocking disabled
access ramps with their bikes.
Carol Dunn, assistant direc

tor of the Disabilities Resources
Center, said it is difficult to
maneuver a wheelchair in these
pathways "any time a ramp is
blocked, even by one bike."
She said more bike racks in
more visible areas would help
prevent people from leaving
their bikes in pathways for dis
abled.
The area between Green and
Meyer is "especially" notorious
for this problem, Dunn said.
Last April, the Planning
Office hired Nicole Freedman,
then a senior, to survey pedes
trian zones on campus, identify
shortages of bike racks and find
out how many were needed.
"Basically, we're going to
keep buying good racks until we
have enough for everyone on
campus," Siegman said. The
bike racks will be tested out on a
small scale before they are
installed campus-wide.
Richard Swent, a member of
the Stanford Hike Coalition,
which urged Transportation
Programs to upgrade the bike
racks, said the old racks were
too easily stolen.
He said that housing coordi
nators often have to buy 10
racks a year because they get
stolen.
The new racks "in the long
run . . . will save money and
keep more bikes safe," Swent
said.
