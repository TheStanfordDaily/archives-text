## U.S. seizes Haiti headquarters Troops raid headquarters of paramilitary thugs and take prisoners

PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti
(AP) — In the most dramatic
strike yet at Haiti's ruling mil
itary, U.S. soldiers raided the
headquarters of a hated pro
army militia yesterday, seizing
weapons and arresting more
than three dozen people.
A joyous crowd of Haitians
gathered to cheer the Ameri
cans.
As the soldiers pulled away
from the paramilitary head
quarters, the Haitians surged
forward in a jubilant mass and
gleefully trashed the place,
smashing everything they
could lay hands on.
"We love you! We love you!"
Haitians shouted at the sol
diers who had raided the head
quarters of the Front for the
Advancement and Progress of
Haiti, known as FRAPH.
The club-wielding demon
strators smashed furniture
and beat on mattresses, water
bottles, refrigerators, tele

phones — anything associated
with FRAPH. One man even
turned his anger on a stapler,
repeatedly throwing it to the
ground.
The raid came hours after
Haitians in the southwestern
town of Les Cayes shot and
wounded a U.S. Special Forces
soldier — the second American
casualty since U.S. troops
arrived two weeks ago.
The wounded soldier was
identified as Staff Sgt. Donald
M. Holstead of Tampa, Fla.,
assigned to the 3rd Special
Forces Group in Fort Bragg,
N.C.
He was making good
progress after surgery for a
bullet wound in the abdomen,
officials said.
He is believed to have
wounded two of his assailants,
who fled and left a trail of
blood.
"His prognosis is great,"
said Lt. Gen. Hugh Shelton,

U.S. commander in Haiti.
There was no indication the
raid was in response to the
shooting.
Rather, it seemed part of a
more aggressive effort by the
United States to pave the way
for the return of exiled Presi
dent Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
As recently as Friday, the
Americans stood back while
FRAPH members shot and
killed pro-Aristide demonstra
tors.
U.S. forces also raided
FRAPH headquarters yester
day in Cap-Haitien, the
nation's second largest city,
and detained 75 people, a Pen
tagon official said in Washing
ton on condition of anonymity.
Troops raided three other
sites in Port-au-Prince, includ
ing two suspected weapons
caches, where they found shot
guns, grenades, rifles, pistols
and explosives, the official
said.
