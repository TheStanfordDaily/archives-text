WASHINGTON (AP) - Agriculture
Secretory Mike Espy resigned yesterday,
saying an investigation into gifts he
accepted from people and companies that
do business with his department was too
distracting for him to remain. He pre
dicted he would be exonerated.
"I owe it to the president to allow his
agenda to go through with a minimum of
distraction," Espy said in announcing he
would leave the Cabinet effective Dec. 31.
President Clinton readily accepted the
resignation from one of his most ardent
and loyal supporters. But a separate inves
tigation by the White House turned up
more damaging information: that Espy's
girlfriend, Patricia Dempsey, had accepted
a $1,200 scholarship from a foundation
run by Arkansas-based Tyson Foods Inc.
The Arkansas company has longtime
ties to President Clinton.
"Although Secretary Espy has said he
has done nothing wrong, I am troubled
by the appearance of some of these inci

dents and believe his decision to leave is
appropriate," Clinton said.
Clinton said he had asked White
House counsel Abner Mikva to continue
his review of the case. An investigation
by court-appointed Independent Counsel
Donald C. Smaltz will also continue.
Smaltz, a Los Angeles lawyer, is inves
tigating a range of conduct by Espy,
including whether he violated rules gov
erning contacts with Tyson and other
companies that do business with the
Agriculture Department.
A senior White House official, speak
ing on the condition of anonymity, said
officials there had learned of the scholar
ship only last week and that Dempsey
had returned the money.
Some of Espy's transgressions were
"more modest than others," the official
said, but "We just felt that, when you
added them all together, there were seri
ous concerns."
Both Espy and his attorney said there

was no evidence any government practice
or policy was affected by the gifts to Espy
or Dempsey.
"I must personally overcome the chal
lenge to my good name," said Espy, 40,
who added he planned to spend more time
with his two children in Mississippi.
Questions have been raised about
Espy's acceptance of tickets to sports
events, travel and lodging from Tyson.
Espy denied any wrongdoing, and has
repaid more th.in $7,600 in expenses.
"I believe that I have succeeded in serv
ing the country and in fulfilling my oath of
office," Espy said, "but in as much as I was
careless in managing some of the details of
my personal activities, I have failed myself,
and for that, I apologize to the president
and to the loyal people who have served so
well."
But he said allegations he improperly
billed the government for travel or other
expenses were untrue and unfounded but
could no longer bear "twisting in the wind."
