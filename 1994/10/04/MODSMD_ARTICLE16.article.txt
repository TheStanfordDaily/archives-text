## Domestic atrocities 
### 
Thorough inspection and
repairs needed to make
EV sanitary and livable

UPON ENTERING THE
dilapidated corridors of
Stern Hall for the first time
each year, undergraduates can find
solace in the fact that, if nothing
else, their rooms will be sanitary
and adequately maintained.
Graduate students living in
Escondido Village, however, were
not so lucky this fall.
A substantial number of the cur
rent residents in this sprawling
apartment complex moved in to
filthy units two weeks ago. Greeted
by domestic atrocities ranging from
broken ovens to urine-infested
bathroom floors, it is no surprise
that some graduate students did
not have favorable first impressions
of Stanford.
According to Amber McLain, a
former Escondido Village resident
assistant who has lived there for
the past five years, the only thing
peculiar about this year's quagmire
was that people actually took the
time to relay their feelings of dis
gust to the University. Housing and
Dining Services' casual oversight of
Escondido Village, in other words,
is nothing new.
While it is certainly true that the
complaints regarding Escondido
Village only come from a minority
of its total population, the problem
warrants serious attention
nonetheless. It is high time the
University develops a fool-proof
method for ensuring the general
cleanliness and upkeep of its gradu
ate housing facilities.
Under the current practice,
departing residents in Escondido
Village are expected to clean their
apartments before they leave.
Members of the housing staff then
inspect the units and charge for any
damages incurred during the year.
Finally, apartments are profession

ally cleaned and inspected again
before the next residents move in.
While there appears to be little
room for oversight in this suppos
edly stringent process, appearances
obviously deceive. Either Housing
and Dining Services has employed
inspectors with poor decision-mak
ing skills, or the system is not actu
ally being implemented as it
should.
Assuming the latter, Housing
and Dining Services must avoid
careless oversight in the future, by
ensuring they have the necessary
staff to fully inspect every unit in
the village.
Glenn Carroll, manager of apart
ment facilities for Housing and
Dining Services, has admitted that
there is presently a large back log of
work orders coming from Escondi
do Village. The hiring of more staff
members would not only increase
the speed at which maintenance
requests could be answered, but
also help eliminate the sub-stan
dard conditions which necessitate
them in the first place.
Given that Escondido Village is
geared toward family housing, the
condition of certain apartments is
especially inappropriate. Young
children, of all people, should not be
forced to live in unsanitary condi
tions due to the carelessness of Uni
versity staff.
After recent renovations to both
Wilbur Hall and Florence Moore
Hall, the University should turn its
attention to graduate housing con
cerns. The Manzanita trailer park
has long been a symbol of the sec
ond-rate treatment some graduate
students receive when it comes to
on-campus housing, and now it
seems that Escondido Village
should be added to the list.
By taking a more careful
approach to the inspection and up
keep of Escondido Village, Universi
ty staff can provide graduate stu
dents with the type of living condi
tions any human being is deserving
of.
Graduate students, after all, are
people too.
