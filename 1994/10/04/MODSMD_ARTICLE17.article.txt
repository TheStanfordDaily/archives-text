'Model minority' discourse dangerous for society

THIS IS A RESPONSE to the let
ter that Professor Stephen Kras
ner wrote to the Daily on Friday
September 30. Let me first state that I
am familiar neither with Professor
Krasner nor his work. Moreover, I was
not present at the Academic Senate
when Professor Krasner commented
on the enrollment of Jewish and Asian
Americans at Stanford, nor did I see
the flyer concerning these statements.
My comments, then, should be con
strued as neither an attack on Profes
sor Krasner nor as support for the
authors of the flyer. Rather, I would
like to comment on Professor Kras
ner's letter, and how his discourse,
whether intentional or not, is complic
it with a narrative that is dangerous
for Asian Americans, other people of
color and indeed American society as a
whole.
I am referring specifically to the
implication that the high percentage of
Asian Americans at Stanford, and in
higher education as a whole, is some-

how demonstrative of America's suc
cess as a multi-ethnic society. This
implication is dangerous for several
reasons. First, this discourse of the
"model minority" has often been
deployed to suggest that the lack of
similar "successes" among other peo
ples of color in the United States is not
a result of any structural racism in the
United States, but rather of some fault
of these peoples themselves. Compar
isons of this sort are sloppy, unwar
ranted and certainly inconclusive. But
they continue to exert influence on an
ideological level.
Second, the entire issue of "repre
sentation" hides certain disparities.
Most importantly, the difference
between demographic and political rep
resentation is significant. While Asian
Americans do indeed constitute
approximately 25 percent of the under
graduate student population, the num
bers drop off drastically in graduate
student enrollment, faculty, and
administration. For example, as Assis

tant Professor David Palumbo-Liu
pointed out at a press conference last
year, despite the high number of Asian
American undergraduate students,
there was no Asian American repre
sentation on the University's commis
sion which was charged with reevalu
ating the undergraduate curriculum
here. This disparity also reaches out
side of the academy, where Asian
Americans have considerably less
political and economic power than
Caucasian Americans with equal levels
of education.
And thirdly, the blanket term of
"Asian American" skews the issue of
"representation" still further. Asian
Americans are comprised of many peo
ples with many different nations of
origin, and widely differing patterns of
immigration, settlement, and experi
ences of discrimination in this coun
try. To lump them all together in order
to demonstrate their over-representa
tion disguises the severe under-repre
sentation of certain Asian American

groups, particularly Philipinos (who
comprise the largest Asian/Pacific
Islander group both in California and
nationwide) and Southeast Asians. In
short, reading the large percentage of
Asian American Stanford students as a
sign of the success of American multi
culturalism is both deceptive and dan
gerous. On the contrary, the übiqui
tous use of the political symbolism of
Asian Americans as a "model minori
ty" speaks to a central problem with
current racial discourse in America.
This issue goes beyond Professor
Krasner's remarks. Indeed, it is only
within the context of the larger narra
tive of race relations in this country
that Professor Krasner's remarks gain
resonance. I would ask the Stanford
community to consider these issues
carefully, and to be sensitive to the
ideological baggage that their words
carry.
