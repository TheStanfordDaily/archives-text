## A 						femi-nazi show-and-tell 
### 
IMAGINE OUR SURPRISE when we
entered the Publications Board only
to be greeted by a huge banner
emblazoned with the words "The Stan
ford Review." Why should this horrify
us? Because, in the words of Aman Ver
jee, editor-in-chief of The Stanford
Review, we are "maniacal war hogs,
wild-eyed concubines [who). . . look like
refrigerators with heads." We are no
less than "man-hating femi-nazis who
every so often infest White Plaza with
[our) 'YES MEANS NO' sloganeering."
What deems us worthy of such praise?
We are members of "the radical feminist
fringe," co-project directors of A
Woman's Guide to Stanford.
Maniacal, maybe.
Sloganeering, never.
Hey, Aman, our femi-nazi ways began
long before we walked into the domain of
The Stanford Review. To make our point,
we thought we'd embarrass ourselves with
some not-so-serious but awfully enlighten
ing experiences in this, our very first (and
probably very hist) public show-and-tell.
Even as Sarah was learning the
alphabet in kindergarten, her revolu
tionary brain was quickly developing.
Her teacher Mrs. Laskowski used a
series of inflatable letters, known as
the Letter People, to make her lessons
more fun. But Sarah noticed something
was askew — the boys and girls in Let
ter Land were not equal. Sarah asked
her teacher why the female vowels
(even with representation by the

hermaphroditic "y") were clearly out
numbered by the male consonants.
While Mrs. Laskowski ignored Sarah's
five-year-old pestering, the femi-nazi
seed was planted.
Early on, Melinda's teachers tried to
relegate her to the world of boys — a
vowel among consonants, Sarah might
say. Though Melinda was taller than
most of the boys, and looked like most of
the boys (thanks, mom, for that lovely
bowl haircut), she wasn't good at boy
things. She ran slow, and wasn't coordi
nated enough for kickball. But she
didn't want to play dumb girlie games
like four square, either. (Should she be
considered the "y" in this story?)
Noticing inequality or avoiding gen
der stereotypes as kids? Was this the
impetus for writing A Woman's Guide to
Stanford? Probably not. However, we
included the stories as more than just
filler. They highlight the fact that our
lives are affected by gender.
Avoiding gender stereotypes and cre
ating a balanced picture of women's
lives at Stanford were two goals we had
in writing the woman's guide. So, the
guide isn't about stereotypical women's
issues like finding the perfect guy or
taking off those pesky unwanted
pounds. Nor does it reveal the top ten
back-to-school beauty tips. It does, how
ever, address real-life relationships,
good health and emotional well-being.
Though the guide is for women
specifically, this is not to say that the

issues addressed aren't relevant to both
sexes. Indeed, if we had the money, we
would distribute to all Stanford stu
dents. Nonetheless, the guide is based
on the idea that, while issues surround
ing academics, spirituality and sexuality
affect each of us, men's and women's
perspectives on such topics are not
always parallel. We spent our summer
with "The Stanford Review" banner
looming over our heads in order to detail
some of these unique experiences and
resources available to Stanford women
— issues a little more complex than
inflatable Letter People and little girls
with bad haircuts.
Okay, so working at the Publications
Board/bachelor pad wasn't so bad. It
was empty most of the summer, which
left us the freedom to blast (and, worse,
to sing to) Aretha Franklin. When the
Review staffers were there, no one called
us "wild-eyed concubines" or said we
looked like "refrigerators with heads."
But then again, we never encoun
tered Aman. . . .
