# Stanford to end administrative role in Rome's Center for Classical Studies

To the disappointment of both Stanford's
Overseas Studies Program and the Classics
Department, the University has decided to
relinquish its administrative role in the Inter
collegiate Center for Classical Studies in Rome.
Over the next two years, Stanford will
begin transferring its duties at the ICCS to
another organization in order to concentrate
more on its own Overseas Studies Program.
The ICCS — an important training and
study ground for American classical scholars
— allows more than 72 undergraduates from
the United States to spend a semester in
Rome studying Roman, Renaissance and
Baroque art history, Roman language and lit
erature, and Roman history. The program is
supported by a Stanford-led consortium of
almost 75 colleges and universities.
"It's a very important center," said Corbin
Smith, deputy director of Stanford's Overseas
Studies Program. "It's had a major influence
on young classicists in this country."

Smith stressed that the decision to termi
nate Stanford's administrative role at the
ICCS was a difficult one to make.
The main reason for this move is the need
for Overseas Studies staff members to con
centrate on Stanford's own programs abroad,
Smith said, adding that money was not an
issue.
"The work we're doing in our own centers
requires much more of us," he said. "It's that
the demands of our own centers are such that
we need to focus our attention there."
Under Stanford's leadership, the ICCS has
played a major role in the education of many
American classics scholars. Most students
who have studied at the center cite it as a vital
part of their academic development, Smith
said. He added that the ICCS does not pri
marily focus on Stanford students.
In the past 29 years, 96 Stanford students
— mostly classics majors — have attended the
ICCS.
Classics Department faculty are particu
larly concerned about the termination of the
University's duties at the center.
"The University as a whole will be less

active in the area of classics, and so it will then
seem as if (Stanford's) Classics Department is
weakened," said Classics Prof. Susan Treggia
ri. "I'm extremely sorry this has happened.
The Classics Department is very disappoint
ed, and students of ICCS that I've spoken to
are also very sad."
Stanford will transfer its duties at the cen
ter once a new management organization is
chosen, Smith said.
The Rome classics center is "in good shape
academically and financially. We'd like to see
it stay that way, so we want to be careful
about the transfer," Smith said.
The ICCS was founded in 1965 by Brooks
Otis, a Stanford classicist.
"Brooks Otis was an important inspiration
for putting together the center," Smith said.
"He had an administrative infrastructure
that could run the Rome center. It's a nation
al program — Stanford had the administra
tive infrastructure in place to run it."
Stanford's decision to relinquish its man
agement role will not affect Stanford stu
dents' ability to attend the Rome Center,
Smith said.
