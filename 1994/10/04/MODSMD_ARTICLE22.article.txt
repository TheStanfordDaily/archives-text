## Stanford finally gets monkey off its back...er...deck Sailers qualify for Singlehanded Nationals 
### Daniel Kao 
Oh what a difference a year makes
. . . or two years ... or three ... or
four.
After failing to qualify for the Sin
glehanded Nationals more times than
Stanford sailing fans would care to
remember, two Cardinal sailors per
formed well enough this past weekend
in the UC-Irvine-hosted Singlehanded
Districts Regatta to compete in nation
als this fall.
"It's always close, but this is the
first time in four or five years that we
qualified for singlehanded competition
in the Nationals," said coach Steve
Boudrow. "Last year [senior] Charles
Meade finished third. This year he
qualified, and he will definitely be a
factor at the Nationals."

"Factor" would be an understate
ment. Meade, who came into the Dis
tricts as one of the favorites, sped past
his adversaries to finish first by a wide
margin of 23 points. Meade faced some
stiff competition, sailing against two of
the hometown hopefuls, not to men
tion the nation's best, in senior
Anteaters Andy Beckman and Peter
Wells. After the first day, the leader
board was tight, with Meade ahead by
just one point.
In the final day of competition, with
just six races left, the winds kicked up,
and with them, Meade's fortunes.
With the stronger winds, the Cardinal
sailor's greater size provided the edge
he needed to pull away from the rest of
the pack. With the lead, Meade began
to sail in a more cerebral and conserva
tive manner, just trying to navigate his

one-man Laser mistake-free. He left
the mistakes for the rest of the field.
"Meade did not have a bad race at
the end," Boudrow said. "The other
sailors were making mistakes while he
sailed conservatively. That was enough
to put him in a really good position to
win. He stayed on top mentally, and
this was a big win to boost his confi
dence."
That added confidence may be all it
will take to vault Meade to the top at
the Singlehanded Nationals, held at
St. Mary's in Maryland November 4-6.
The rest of the Stanford co-ed team
fared impressively as well. All six
members survived the first day of cuts
which pared the field of 28 down to 16.
Freshmen Danny Zimbaldi and John
Meade placed fourth and fifth, respec
tively, coming within nine points of the

crucial second-place finish needed to
qualify.
"I thought they both could have
done it. But it was new to them, and
they didn't have that much practice
under their belts," Boudrow said.
"Also, the two Irvine skippers definite
ly had a lot more experience which
became a big factor at the end."
On the women's side of the regatta,
Stanford had hoped to perform a little
better. Boudrow had been expecting a
"one, two" finish. Nevertheless, sopho
more Alice Manard qualified for
nationals coming in second, five points
behind San Diego State's first place
skipper. Manard held the top spot after
the first day, a lead she was able to
hold on to in order to qualify.
"It wasn't my best regatta, but
