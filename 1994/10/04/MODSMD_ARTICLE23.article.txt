Alumni 3

The Stanford women's soccer
team has overcome a barrage of
injuries to stand as the lone
remaining undefeated and untied
squad in NCAA Division I. On Sun
day morning, not even a group of
former Cardinal soccer greats
could topple the current crop, as
the varsity defeated the alumni 5-3
in an exhibition match at Maloney
Field.
Julie Foudy, a 1993 graduate
and member of the 1991 World
Cup team, and all-time scoring
leader turned assistant coach
Sarah Rafanelli led the alumni
squad, which scored as many times
as all seven Cardinal opponents
have this season combined.
"They did llook sharp], didn't
they?" said varsity head coach lan
Sawyers, who officiated the con
test. "All the players who came to
play were great. They've all kept in
shape and looked like they're still
playing."
The alumni crumbled in the sec
ond of three 30-minute periods as
the varsity scored three times in a
four-minute, 21-second span to

pull away. Significantly, Foudy and
Rafanelli both sat out the middle
period but returned for the third.
The two U.S. national team
members were not the only stand
outs for the alumni, however.
"Obviously you have Foudy and
Rafanelli.. .but all the people who
are still not playing at that level
were really gung-ho to play,"
Sawyers said. "It was great to see
them all out there."
The alumni got on the score
board while the field was still cov
ered with morning dew as 1992
graduate Kim Petersen scored on
an assist from Foudy at the 11:50
mark. The goal counted despite the
objections of the varsity squad,
who complained that an offsides
penalty should have been called.
"I couldn't see it from where I
was," said Sawyers, who seldom
strayed from his perch at midfield.
"I looked at my linesperson and she
had no clue."
Out of nowhere, the varsity
countered. Current Cardinal scor
ing leader Erin Martin evened the
sore at 26:18 with a sudden shot
past diving goalkeeper Helen Nor
ton ('B5). Currently a lawyer in
Washington, D.C., Norton stayed
busy in goal, playing the entire
game. She received her biggest
workout early in the second period,
when the varsity effectively put the
game out of reach. Martin fired a
goal into the lower left corner of
