## Cardinal overcomes alumni 
### Jeremy Stone Staff writer 
Cardinal 5

Alumni 3

The Stanford women's soccer
team has overcome a barrage of
injuries to stand as the lone
remaining undefeated and untied
squad in NCAA Division I. On Sun
day morning, not even a group of
former Cardinal soccer greats
could topple the current crop, as
the varsity defeated the alumni 5-3
in an exhibition match at Maloney
Field.
Julie Foudy, a 1993 graduate
and member of the 1991 World
Cup team, and all-time scoring
leader turned assistant coach
Sarah Rafanelli led the alumni
squad, which scored as many times
as all seven Cardinal opponents
have this season combined.
"They did llook sharp], didn't
they?" said varsity head coach lan
Sawyers, who officiated the con
test. "All the players who came to
play were great. They've all kept in
shape and looked like they're still
playing."
The alumni crumbled in the sec
ond of three 30-minute periods as
the varsity scored three times in a
four-minute, 21-second span to

pull away. Significantly, Foudy and
Rafanelli both sat out the middle
period but returned for the third.
The two U.S. national team
members were not the only stand
outs for the alumni, however.
"Obviously you have Foudy and
Rafanelli.. .but all the people who
are still not playing at that level
were really gung-ho to play,"
Sawyers said. "It was great to see
them all out there."
The alumni got on the score
board while the field was still cov
ered with morning dew as 1992
graduate Kim Petersen scored on
an assist from Foudy at the 11:50
mark. The goal counted despite the
objections of the varsity squad,
who complained that an offsides
penalty should have been called.
"I couldn't see it from where I
was," said Sawyers, who seldom
strayed from his perch at midfield.
"I looked at my linesperson and she
had no clue."
Out of nowhere, the varsity
countered. Current Cardinal scor
ing leader Erin Martin evened the
sore at 26:18 with a sudden shot
past diving goalkeeper Helen Nor
ton ('B5). Currently a lawyer in
Washington, D.C., Norton stayed
busy in goal, playing the entire
game. She received her biggest
workout early in the second period,
when the varsity effectively put the
game out of reach. Martin fired a
goal into the lower left corner of

the net at 33:53, and fellow
sophomore Danielle Hamacher
scored 38 seconds later to pad
the lead. At 38:14, sophomore
Mandy Tucker drilled a shot
over the outstretched Norton to
pull the varsity ahead 4-1.
After Tucker was credited
with a goal on a ball that slipped
through Norton's hands to open
the third quarter scoring, the
crowd got what it wanted to see
— some alumni magic.
Rafanelli led the charge, as
she assisted 1984 grad Sue
Moore on a score to the upper
right corner of the net at 75:44.
The current assistant coach
closed out the scoring 3:26 later
with a beautiful unassisted goal
that was vintage Rafanelli.
Hope you saw that one,
Coach.
While the jury remains dead
locked about Sawyers as a refer
ee, nobody is questioning his
capability as a coach. After
North Carolina's four year, 92-
game winning streak came to an
end in a scoreless tie with Notre
Dame Sunday, and Portland lost
to Oregon State, the third
ranked Cardinal has the only
unblemished record in the
nation heading into Wednes
day's match-up against No. 20
St. Mary's. The game will start
at 4 p.m. at Maloney Field.
The Gaels (6-3-1) have fallen
on hard times after opening the
season with five consecutive
wins and climbing into the top
10 in the nation. After a 2-2 tie
vs. West Coast Conference foe
Pepperdine September 18,
starting goalkeeper Sylvia
Keller was injured and has not
returned. In her absence, St.
Mary's lost three straight as
sophomore Nicole Barbacovi
struggled in Keller's stead. The

Gaels rebounded with a 5-1 vic
tory over San Diego State on
Sunday.
Though struggling somewhat
defensively, the St. Mary's
offense has been potent. With
24 goals in 10 games, the Gaels
pose the stiffest test yet for a
Cardinal defense that has yield
ed only three goals all year.
Senior forward Lori Hoker
son is the main cog in St. Mary's
scoring machine. With 11 goals
and five assists to her name in
1994, she and sophomore for
ward Monika Larsson (five
goals, five assists) will keep All-
American sweeper Jessica Fis
cher and company busy.
Sawyers downplayed the
Gaels' recent struggles and
insisted that the Bay Area rivals
would pose a major threat.
"They're a great team,"
Sawyers said. "They're a very
good, well organized defensive
unit, and they're dangerous on
the break."
For the Cardinal, sophomore
forward Emily Burt, who was
injured in the Sacramento State
contest last Thursday and sat
out Sunday's exhibition, is
questionable. Hamacher, who
was injured but walked off the
field in the second period Sun
day, is expected to play. Mid
fielders Elie Foster, a freshman,
and Carmel Murphy, a junior,
are also probable after partici
pating in the alumni game.
Senior goalkeeper Leslie Gar
rard, who has not played so far,
is rehabilitating well from a
shoulder injury and will proba
bly return soon. Fortunately for
Stanford, senior Jennifer
Poehler, who has backed up Gar
rard since they arrived together
in 1991, boasts a 0.43 goals
against average for the season.
"She's worked hard over the
last three years to get herself
ready for this time and she's
doing a really good job with it,"
Sawyers said.

as all seven Cardinal opponents
have this season combined.
"They did llook sharp], didn't
they?" said varsity head coach lan
Sawyers, who officiated the con
test. "All the players who came to
play were great. They've all kept in
shape and looked like they're still
playing."
The alumni crumbled in the sec
ond of three 30-minute periods as
the varsity scored three times in a
four-minute, 21-second span to

pull away. Significantly, Foudy and
Rafanelli both sat out the middle
period but returned for the third.
The two U.S. national team
members were not the only stand
outs for the alumni, however.
"Obviously you have Foudy and
Rafanelli.. .but all the people who
are still not playing at that level
were really gung-ho to play,"
Sawyers said. "It was great to see
them all out there."
The alumni got on the score
board while the field was still cov
ered with morning dew as 1992
graduate Kim Petersen scored on
an assist from Foudy at the 11:50
mark. The goal counted despite the
objections of the varsity squad,
who complained that an offsides
penalty should have been called.
"I couldn't see it from where I
was," said Sawyers, who seldom
strayed from his perch at midfield.
"I looked at my linesperson and she
had no clue."
Out of nowhere, the varsity
countered. Current Cardinal scor
ing leader Erin Martin evened the
sore at 26:18 with a sudden shot
past diving goalkeeper Helen Nor
ton ('B5). Currently a lawyer in
Washington, D.C., Norton stayed
busy in goal, playing the entire
game. She received her biggest
workout early in the second period,
when the varsity effectively put the
game out of reach. Martin fired a
goal into the lower left corner of

the net at 33:53, and fellow
sophomore Danielle Hamacher
scored 38 seconds later to pad
the lead. At 38:14, sophomore
Mandy Tucker drilled a shot
over the outstretched Norton to
pull the varsity ahead 4-1.
After Tucker was credited
with a goal on a ball that slipped
through Norton's hands to open
the third quarter scoring, the
crowd got what it wanted to see
— some alumni magic.
Rafanelli led the charge, as
she assisted 1984 grad Sue
Moore on a score to the upper
right corner of the net at 75:44.
The current assistant coach
closed out the scoring 3:26 later
with a beautiful unassisted goal
that was vintage Rafanelli.
Hope you saw that one,
Coach.
While the jury remains dead
locked about Sawyers as a refer
ee, nobody is questioning his
capability as a coach. After
North Carolina's four year, 92-
game winning streak came to an
end in a scoreless tie with Notre
Dame Sunday, and Portland lost
to Oregon State, the third
ranked Cardinal has the only
unblemished record in the
nation heading into Wednes
day's match-up against No. 20
St. Mary's. The game will start
at 4 p.m. at Maloney Field.
The Gaels (6-3-1) have fallen
on hard times after opening the
season with five consecutive
wins and climbing into the top
10 in the nation. After a 2-2 tie
vs. West Coast Conference foe
Pepperdine September 18,
starting goalkeeper Sylvia
Keller was injured and has not
returned. In her absence, St.
Mary's lost three straight as
sophomore Nicole Barbacovi
struggled in Keller's stead. The

Gaels rebounded with a 5-1 vic
tory over San Diego State on
Sunday.
Though struggling somewhat
defensively, the St. Mary's
offense has been potent. With
24 goals in 10 games, the Gaels
pose the stiffest test yet for a
Cardinal defense that has yield
ed only three goals all year.
Senior forward Lori Hoker
son is the main cog in St. Mary's
scoring machine. With 11 goals
and five assists to her name in
1994, she and sophomore for
ward Monika Larsson (five
goals, five assists) will keep All-
American sweeper Jessica Fis
cher and company busy.
Sawyers downplayed the
Gaels' recent struggles and
insisted that the Bay Area rivals
would pose a major threat.
"They're a great team,"
Sawyers said. "They're a very
good, well organized defensive
unit, and they're dangerous on
the break."
For the Cardinal, sophomore
forward Emily Burt, who was
injured in the Sacramento State
contest last Thursday and sat
out Sunday's exhibition, is
questionable. Hamacher, who
was injured but walked off the
field in the second period Sun
day, is expected to play. Mid
fielders Elie Foster, a freshman,
and Carmel Murphy, a junior,
are also probable after partici
pating in the alumni game.
Senior goalkeeper Leslie Gar
rard, who has not played so far,
is rehabilitating well from a
shoulder injury and will proba
bly return soon. Fortunately for
Stanford, senior Jennifer
Poehler, who has backed up Gar
rard since they arrived together
in 1991, boasts a 0.43 goals
against average for the season.
"She's worked hard over the
last three years to get herself
ready for this time and she's
doing a really good job with it,"
Sawyers said.
Cardinal 5

Alumni 3

The Stanford women's soccer
team has overcome a barrage of
injuries to stand as the lone
remaining undefeated and untied
squad in NCAA Division I. On Sun
day morning, not even a group of
former Cardinal soccer greats
could topple the current crop, as
the varsity defeated the alumni 5-3
in an exhibition match at Maloney
Field.
Julie Foudy, a 1993 graduate
and member of the 1991 World
Cup team, and all-time scoring
leader turned assistant coach
Sarah Rafanelli led the alumni
squad, which scored as many times
as all seven Cardinal opponents
have this season combined.
