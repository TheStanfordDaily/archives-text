"It was both discouraging and
encouraging," said Stanford men's
soccer head coach Colin Lindores.
That basically sums up the Car
dinal's experience in last week
end's home tournament against
the University of Rhode Island
and the University of Akron. The
team lost two more games, but it
also showed signs of progress.
Indeed, in its 2-1 loss in Fri
day's game versus the Rams, Stan
ford held the ball on Rhode
Island's side of the field for most of
the first half and put heavy pres
sure on the Rams offensively.
Both teams were scoreless at half
time but in the second half Stan
ford let down some of the pressure
and allowed the Rhode Island
attack to blossom.
Sophomore goalkeeper Ryan
Craig stopped several shots,
including some on early break
aways, but let past two goals on
Cardinal defensive breakdowns.
"We were definitely the better
team," Craig said. "We were play
ing well, probably the best this
year. Then, we bad our character
istic lapse, and from that point on
we are always struggling to catch
up."
The Cardinal can take consola
tion in the fact that it carried out
the first half according to the style
of play it has been aiming to devel
op. The players executed Lin
dores's game plan to work the ball
up the field instead of just kicking
it forward.
"I'm happy overall," Lindores

said. "We played a good game. It
was a game that we put lots of
things together we were hoping
for. We were playing our type of
game, not helter skelter."
"However, we didn't score the
goals on the opportunities that we
created," the coach added. "If we
don't put opportunities away, it
costs us."
Sunday's game versus the Zips
yielded much the same results.
The play was even for the most
part, with both teams scoring
three goals each in regulation
time. However, Stanford eventual
ly lost in the second 15-minute
overtime period.
While Lindores admits to feel
ing disheartened by the season's
record, one of the lowest he has
amassed, he remains optimistic
about the very young Stanford
squad's play against the Zips.
"There were seven freshmen
playing and I saw some good
things from them," Lindores said.
"I was encouraged by it. I saw a lot
of positive things, but the longer
the game goes, then the more
there are opportunities for errors.
They just need a win to enhance
what they're doing."
One freshman starter, midfield
er/forward Justin Leßlanc, made
the all-tournament team along
with senior midfielder Jeff Kogl.
With both disheartening tour
nament results but also signs that
it can play the style and level it
desires, Stanford can only look for
ward to the coming weekend and
the start of Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation conference
play.
"It's coming around," Kogl
said. "We just have to pick our
heads up and start playing for the
conference."
Coach Lindores echoed Kogl's
sentiment.
"There's a renewal of the sea
son on Friday," Lindores said.
"It's the beginning of league play.
Maybe we can turn some of these
negative experiences into positive
ones."
