# Never Say Die
## A 						long time it has been, but we will win again 
### 
A short 10 years ago, my San Diego Padres were
on their way to the World Series Playoffs against
the Chicago Cubs.
Yes, the San Diego Padres. The team that has
since blundered and bumbled its way through the
National League, trading away All-Stars and spiral -
ing downwards into the realm of sub-.500 seasons
and sub-10,000 fan turnouts.
Today they are the laughing stock of the league,
the team where next year is always "The Year" and
this year is always a building one. A far cry from a
decade ago.
The Padres sprang into the hearts of San Diego

fans ill 1984 with
their ugly brown
and orange uni
forms, creeping
up the standings
when no one was
looking. I, too,
jumped on the
bandwagon; I
wore the "Cub-
Busters" t-shirts,
donned a Padre
hat and pinned a

pennant to my wall. Along with thousands of San
Diegans, I caught the fever through and through.
Something funny happens when you become a
sports fan, and only the die-hards know the feeling.
A team suddenly becomes a channel for energy,
something to take pride in, root for and believe in.
It is no longer a team, but my team, almost as if
they are close friends or family. When they win it is
a very personal victory, and when they lose it is an
emotional disaster.
Granted, being a fan is a strange concept. How can
a bunch of people whom I have never even met have
such an impact on my life? Who really cares if they
win? The world will still revolve, I'll still live and there
are more important things to devote my time to.
I suppose the most rational explanation is that
it's simply fun. It is fun to watch Jerry Rice catch a
mid-air pass; it is almost magical to cheer for the
Cardinal women's basketball team and see them
broadcast on national television; it is a thing of
beauty to see Brevin Knight deliver an alley-oop.
That's my team.
This still doesn't explain, however, my uncan
ny and somewhat ridiculous devotion to the
Padres. How can watching errors, strike-outs and
ninth-inning losses be fun? Strangely, unlike
probably the entire city of San Diego, I failed to
jump off the bandwagon once the ride got a little
rocky. I never lost the fever and the pennant is
still on the wall.
I suppose the fever burns because I still believe. I
remember the feeling of ecstasy as I watched Steve
Garvey punch a last-second home run over the wall
at Jack Murphy Stadium, and suddenly it was me —
it was San Diego — that was going to the World
Series. We ended up getting eaten alive by the Tigers,
but I have never been more enamored with a team
than I was then; I have never seen a city so unified or
spirited than I experienced in San Diego in 1984.
The days of Steve Garvey, Alan Wiggins and
Graig Nettles — not to mention a simple win every
week or so — seem so foreign now. The die-hards
are dying off and most of San Diego seems to have
lost its patience. Prior to the strike, fans were fed
up. Even the marketing ploy changed from "Let's
go Padres" to "Hey, it's baseball." As in, hey, at
least it's a ball and a bat and those are real guys try
ing hard to make them connect.
It breaks my heart to know that the entire All-
Star teams from both leagues recently have been
made up of former Padres. Fans of the Marlins,
Rockies, Blue Jays, Cubs, Reds and even the Giants


Allyson

have the Padres to thank for
their valuable additions. It
breaks my heart to realize that
another trip to the Series is as
likely as a Big Game Bonfire in
the lake bed. Maybe next year, I
keep telling myself.
They may not be the 1984
Padres, but they are the Pads.
They try hard, they win occa
sionally and they are certainly
up against endless ridicule and
torment. Not bad for a team
with no money and no manage
ment.
I'm loyal because it saddens
me to watch others lose faith at
the slightest disappointment.

Being a fan means cheering a
team on no matter what others
say (and they say a lot about
those Pads, I assure you). It
means taking pride in every
win, suffering through every
loss. Going in for the long haul.
Okay, so ten years is a long
time to stay on the wagon. But I
remember what it was like to
watch my team take it almost
all the way. It happened then; it
could happen again. And then,
only then, I will relish in the
four little words that all die
hard fans dream of shouting at
the top of their lungs:
I told you so.

A Pads fan 'till the end, Allyson's
devotion as editor of the sports
page runs almost as deep as her
dedication to her team.
