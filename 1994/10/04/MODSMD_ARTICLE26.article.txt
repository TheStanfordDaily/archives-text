# Hockey checks Cal for NorPac lead

"Awesome."
That's how field hockey
coach Sheryl Johnson described
her team's turn around over the
weekend.
In two weeks, the Cardinal
went from a 3-0 loss to Califor
nia to dominating the Golden
Bears by a 3-1 margin last Sat
urday at Stanford for a first
place tie in the Northern Pacif
ic Conference. The Cardinal
also demolished UC-Davis, 5-1,
on Sunday to raise its record to
4-5 overall, 2-1 in the confer
ence.
"We had good intensity
[throughout both weekend
games]," Johnson said. "We're
gaining confidence with each
game."
Sophomore forward Kory
Taylor led the Cardinal attack
with two goals while sophomore
midfielder Amy Marfil added
the third. Stanford's first goal
against the Bears came off the
stick of Marfil. Junior defender
Rachel Timbie began the play
off a sideline hit by tapping the
ball to Marfil, who found the
back of the net.
Taylor's first score was set
up by sophomore forward
Baochi Nguyen. Nguyen, who
had controlled the ball at mid
field, whipped a pass up the
field to Taylor, who preceded to
beat the last California defend
er and the goalie, allowing her
to tap the ball into the goal.
Taylor also added a goal in the
second half to round out Stan
ford's scoring.
"It is really nice to beat Cal,"
said junior midfielder and tri
captain Elise Morgan. "We
showed we're a good team.
We're really excited."
The Cardinal was better pre
pared than the Golden Bears,
according to senior midfielder
and tri-captain Tina Syer.
"We have had much tougher
practices [since the first Cali
fornia game]," she said. "At the
end of the game we still had an
attack. We were going hard the
whole game."
Playing on grass in front of
the Stanford crowd also helped
the team.

"We played with more
aggression and confidence,"
Johnson said. "We're getting
better every game."
The Cardinal validated John
son's assessment against the
Aggies, controlling the ball the
entire game. Davis scored the
first goal of the game on one of
the few times it had possession
of the ball. The rest of the
game, however, saw the Cardi
nal attacking and forcing the
action on offense.
The Cardinal's first goal of
the game came on a penalty
shot by Morgan. Stanford was
awarded the penalty shot when
the Davis goalie, in an attempt
to make a save, swung her stick
at the ball. The Cardinal's
other first half goal came when
Marfil fired a bullet from the
top left of the circle past a cou
ple of defenders and under the
goalie's left leg.
The second half was no dif
ferent, with the Cardinal scor
ing three goals, all off penalty
corners.
Syer scored twice and Marfil
added her second goal of the
game. Syer's first goal came
when she controlled the ball at
the top left of the circle, drib
bled into the middle of the field
and put the ball past the
goalie's left.
Her second score came when
Davis was unable to clear the
ball. The rebounded ball was
passed into the middle of the
circle where Syer controlled it,
shot and scored.
Marfil's second goal came
late in the game. The ball was
passed around at the top of the
circle. When it came to Marfil,
she blasted a shot just under
the goalie's outstretched leg.
The Aggies, in their first
year of field hockey, showed
their youth by allowing Stan
ford to attempt numerous
penalty corners, Johnson said.
On the other hand, Stan
ford's young team keeps getting
better as the new starters gain
more experience and learn to
play with each other.
"We're looking forward to
playing our next games," Syer
said. "I think we're really confi
dent."
