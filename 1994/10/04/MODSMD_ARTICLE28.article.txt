# Battling construction chaos: a list of projects on campus
## 
### September Treviño Staff writer 
In the last week, dodging con
struction crews, barricades and
newly erected fences has become
second nature to students dash
ing off to class.
Though a few of the construc
tion projects around campus are
nearing completion, students will,
for the most part, have to bear the
noise and inconvenience a while
longer.
Some of the construction is a
part of the University's ongoing
program to repair buildings dam
aged by the 1989 Loma Prieta
Earthquake, while other con
struction projects will provide
new facilities:
• Buildings 80 and 20 in the
Inner Quad are currently under
going repairs and structural rein
forcements. Building 80 will be
completed in the next few weeks
and Building 20 will be finished in
the spring, said Facilities' con
struction manager Maggie Bur
gett.
The Geology and Language
corners are among the buildings
next in line for restoration. Also
up for repairs in the Inner Quad
are buildings 30 , 90, 100 and 110.
This construction is "part of
the University's ongoing seismic
strengthening and restoration
program of Main Quad build

ings," said Mark Jones, director
of Facilities Project Management.
• Construction on Green
Library's west wing, which is also
closed, has not yet begun, and the
budget and construction plans

This is 'part of the
University's ongoing
seismic strengthen
ing and restoration
program of Main
Quad buildings.'
— Mark Jones

have yet to be determined.
Burgett said the work crews
set up just beyond the entrance to
the Main Quad facing Green
Library and the School of Educa
tion are examining utility lines to
facilitate in the reconstruction of
Green Library West.
Some of the money needed to
restore the west wing and por
tions of the Inner Quad will come
from the $38.5 million the Feder
al Emergency Management Agen
cy has agreed to pay the Universi
ty for building repairs related to
the 1989 earthquake.
Donations will also support

repairs to the west wing, said
Jones.
• Construction of the Gates
Information Sciences Building
and the extension of the Center
for Integrated Systems began in
August. The two projects are
scheduled for completion in
December and November of 1995,
respectively.
However, the construction on
these buildings has sparked some
concern over student safety. Bur
gett said she is concerned about
curtailing the traffic around the
construction cites.
"People are confused that Serra
(Street) is no longer a thru-way,"
said Burgett. "People pull in that
gate and it really is hazardous."
The bike lane that currently
runs by the Gilbert Biological Sci
ences Building will be widened
this week, Burgett added. "We're
working on better access around
the project," she said.
The Gates Building will bring
the Computer Science Depart
ment under one roof.
Funds for the $34 million
Gates project were generated by
various donations, namely a $6
million gift from Microsoft Corpo
ration founder Bill Gates.
The $17.5 million budget for
the CIS building was sponsored in
part by Near West Campus
Regional Funds, Departmental
Funds and other tnfts.
