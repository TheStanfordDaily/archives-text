## ASSU to discuss Rec Center, Design Group at first meeting 
### Kevin Wack Staff writer 
The ASSU Senate will discuss two
major business bills and several ad
ministrative matters tonight at its
first meeting of the academic year, as
well as announcing a new special-fee
task force.
The senate will be asked to ap
prove the ASSU takeover of the
Tresidder Recreation Center and the
budget for the new Stanford Design
Group.

Both projects, which should boost the ASSU's in
come, are expected to be approved.
Approval of the Rec Center bill would transfer con
trol of the center — which houses a video rental ma

chine and a game room with video games and pool ta
bles — from the Stanford Management Company's
Shopping Center Division to the ASSU.
Although the center has operated in the red in past
years, ASSU leaders have said they believe it can turn
a profit and will generate some money for the ASSU.
The other major item on the agenda would establish
another ASSU business, the Stanford Design Group,
which would provide an on-campus printing service.
The bill would set up the business for a trial basis of six
months.
Senate Chair Nawwar Kasrawi said he is hopeful
that both bills will pass.
Senator Smeeta Ramarathnam, a junior, said she
had gotten the impression from senators on the com
mittees handling the two measures that the bills would
nrobablv Dass.
