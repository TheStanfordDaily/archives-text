## ASSU to discuss Rec Center, Design Group at first meeting 
### Kevin Wack Staff writer 
The ASSU Senate will discuss two
major business bills and several ad
ministrative matters tonight at its
first meeting of the academic year, as
well as announcing a new special-fee
task force.
The senate will be asked to ap
prove the ASSU takeover of the
Tresidder Recreation Center and the
budget for the new Stanford Design
Group.

Both projects, which should boost the ASSU's in
come, are expected to be approved.
Approval of the Rec Center bill would transfer con
trol of the center — which houses a video rental ma

chine and a game room with video games and pool ta
bles — from the Stanford Management Company's
Shopping Center Division to the ASSU.
Although the center has operated in the red in past
years, ASSU leaders have said they believe it can turn
a profit and will generate some money for the ASSU.
The other major item on the agenda would establish
another ASSU business, the Stanford Design Group,
which would provide an on-campus printing service.
The bill would set up the business for a trial basis of six
months.
Senate Chair Nawwar Kasrawi said he is hopeful
that both bills will pass.
Senator Smeeta Ramarathnam, a junior, said she
had gotten the impression from senators on the com
mittees handling the two measures that the bills would
nrobablv Dass.

Senator Michelle Gee, also a
junior, said she expects a little
controversy over the Rec Center
proposal, but expects the Design
Group proposal to pass.
The Design Group — which
has actually been running for over
four weeks now — serves as a
branch of ASSU Type & Design
and will attempt to fill the void in
the area of on-campus printing left
by the closure of Stanford Publica
tions Services' Graphics Center.
Kasrawi said he and several
ASSU senators decided to create
the center this summer because of
the obvious demand. Campus
groups had been going to off-cam
pus businesses for such services as
the printing of business cards and
brochures, he said.
In the wake of last year's ASSU
elections — in which 18 student
groups were denied their special
fee requests — senate leaders will
also announce the formation of a
new task force to study the special
fee request process in today's
meeting, said senior Mork Mur
dock, a COP member.
Murdock said students will vote
on the task force's final proposal in
a special election scheduled to be
held the second week of winter
quarter.
Also on the senate's agenda is a
bill to approve an honorarium for

Naomi Wolf — scheduled to speak
on campus later this year — and a
bill requesting a leave of absence
for two senators, Sanford Dickert
and Nancy Salas.
Dickert, a non-voting graduate
senator, said he is taking a leave
because of a job he has with IBM.
Salas could not be reached last
night.
Kasrawi also promised a lot of
announcements, scheduling of
committee meeting times, and
other administrative details.
Although this is the ASSU's
first official meeting of the year,
Kasrawi said new senate uniforms
would not be ready until later this
quarter.
Last year, students approved an
amendment to the ASSU constitu
tion which makes identifying
sweatshirts mandatory for sena
tors on meeting days. The sweat
shirts, designed to promote visibil
ity of the senate, are to read "What
is an ASSU Senator?" on the front,
and "I'm an ASSU Senator, silly!"
on the back.
"It will be about one week to
two, but hopefully they'll be ready
in time for next week's meeting,"
Kasrawi said.
Ramarathnam said she wasn't
sure whether last year's bill man
dating the sweatshirts had also
authorized their funding.
Gee expressed excitement over
the ASSU's new calendar year.
"I'm looking forward to this year
because it seems the people really
get along better," she said.
