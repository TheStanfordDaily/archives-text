# University uses incentives to keep students, employees off the road
## 
### Allison Short Staff writer 
Facing a need to reduce parking
demands and to meet the stan
dards of the Clean Air Act, Stan
ford's Transportation Programs
office has opted this year to actual
ly pay off-campus students and
employees not to drive.
Off-campus commuters have
already begun receiving several
new benefits — such as gift certifi
cates and free parking permits —
for finding some other mode of
transportation.
The Stanford Clean Air Credit

Program "has received tremen
dous response," said Jeffrey Tum
lin, special projects coordinator at
Transportation Programs. "Peo
ple are really excited about it."
Employees and students who
commute to campus can "cash in"
if they stop or limit their daily com
mutes.
Drivers who use their car less
than 87 days a year will receive ap
proximately $70 in credits for giv
ing up their right to drive and park
on campus every day.
Credits cannot be redeemed for
cash, but can be used for other
transportation benefits and prod

ucts. For example, people can re
ceive 18 free one-day "A" parking
permits, valid in "A" or "C" lots, or
receive credits toward carpool
parking permits.
Those who do not own a car can
receive free gift certificates for the
Track House or the campus bike
shop. Off-campus commuters can
also receive free transit passes,
such as CalTrain tickets.
"As far as we can tell, the pro
gram is already successful," Tum
lin said.
Transportation Programs has
already sold twice as many train
passes this month as in previous
months, Tumlin said, adding that
his office has given away hundreds
of bike helmets to those "cashing
in" some of their credit.
Most people divide their credits
among daily permits, bike helmets
and gift certificates, said Tumlin.
The Clean Air Credit Program
was created by several Transporta
tion Programs staffers in order to
meet the Clean Air Act's federal pro
visions. Among other things, the law
requires the University to reduce
the number of car trips to campus.
The program was also a
response to complaints about the
lack of on-campus parking.
Only off-campus residents are
eligible for the program because of
the numerous free services avail
able to on-campus residents, such
as free shuttles, Tumlin said. In
addition, residents' parking per
mits are not valid across campus so
there is no need to drive.
Although there has been an
enormous positive response to the
new program, the office has also
received a few complaints from
some students and employees who
were upset that they didn't qualify
for the program, Tumlin said.
For example, groups such as the
Stanford Management Company do
not qualify because the company
subsidizes its employees' parking.
Tumlin said most people were not
upset because "we're not taking any
thing away from anyone. For the
first time, we're looking at trans
portation instead of just parking."
