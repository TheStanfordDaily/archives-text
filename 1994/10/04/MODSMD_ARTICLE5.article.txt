# Sex assault educator position eliminated
## 
### Beth Berselli Senior staff writer 
The position of Stanford's full-time sexual
assault prevention educator has been elimi
nated, and operations at the Sexual Assault
Resource Center have come to a temporary
halt due a severe lack of funding for staff
members.
As a result of losing its ASSU special-fee
funding last spring, the Coalition Against
Sexual Assault — the umbrella organization
that supports these services — may also have
to cut other programs such as the annual Ori
entation production "Sex in the '905."
"At this moment the [Sexual Assault Re
source) center is not running," said senior
Virginia Duplessis, the coalition's treasurer
and a volunteer at the center, housed Cowell
Student Health Center.
"It's really pathetic," she said. "We give
out all these resource sheets saying call or
drop in any time, but if students did show up
there would be a closed door. That is a real in
justice to students."
The coalition requested $55,731
in special-fee funding last spring to
pay for the position of sexual
assault prevention educator, the
resource center itself and campus
education programs, including
"Sex in the '90s" and liape Aware
ness Week.
Kven though 55 percent of stu
dents voted for the funding, the fee
was denied because the coalition's
"yes" vote did not reach the
required level of 15 percent of the
student body.
As a result, the coalition was
unable to renew the paid full-time
position of former Sexual Assault
Prevention Educator Angelina
Cheney after August 15 of this year.
Cowell administrators, howev
er, agreed to pay her salary until
last Friday so that she could com
plete work on the Orientation pro
gram "Sex in the '905," Duplessis
said.
Cheney, who will soon be mov
ing to Wisconsin, was responsible
for staffing the resource center as
well as running "Sex in the '905."
She could not be reached last night.
When the ASSU originally cre
ated the center and Cheney's posi
tion three years ago, it did so with
the understanding that the Uni
versity would assume the financial
responsibilities after one year.

The University, however, is not
planning to supplement its current
funding for the coalition, which
pays only for a half-time coordina
tor position for the Sexual Assault
Prevention Program, said Dean of
Students Michael Jackson.
Trace Shapiro, who previously
filled the half-time position, left
the University when her term
ended in August.
The University has committed
itself to funding Shapiro's former
position for an additional two
years, and Cowell administrators
are searching for her replacement.
Hut several students say paying
for this half-time position is not
enough, and it is Stanford's duty to
provide funding for other coalition
services.
"It's the University's responsi
bility, as well as the students',' said
senior Sarah Horsley, a member of
the Women's Center Collective.
And senior Sally Matlin, a coali
tion member, said "Sex in the '90s"
must occur next fall.
This summer, the University
contributed $3,000 as one-time
funding for "Sex in the '905," Jack
son said.
But in terms of providing addi
tional funds "it's pretty difficult to
pick and choose which groups get
funding when students voted it down
in the first place," Jackson said.
Instead, the University will
work with a newly formed ASSU
Senate task force to address prob
lems regarding the special-fee

request process, he added.
Director of Student Activities
Nanci Howe said the University
shouldn't automatically fund
Cheney's position or "Sex in the
'90s" because "we're going
through severe budget cuts."
The University should examine
what services it currently provide*
to determine the best way to sup
port women on Stanford's campus,
said Howe, who is a member of the
Women's Center's Advisory Board
Coalition members, however,
plan to press University adminis
trators to provide financial sup
port, Duplessis said.
"To some extent the adminis
tration has helped us already, but
now is the critical time," Duplessis
said. "Many times they've
expressed their commitment to
these issues, but they need to put
money where their mouth is."
Coalition members are also
working with Cowell's Health Pro
motion Program to develop a class
that would train students to staff
the Sexual Assault Resource Center.
The coalition — which first
applied for funding in 1992 — had
never previously had its special-fee
request denied, said Duplessis,
adding that the coalition plans to
reapply for its special-fee funding
this spring.
Cheney's annual salary —
which was $22,000 plus benefits —
was funded by the coalition's spe
cial-fee request, as was the $8,000
for "Sex in the '905."

Cheney, who will soon be mov
ing to Wisconsin, was responsible
for staffing the resource center as
well as running "Sex in the '905."
She could not be reached last night.
When the ASSU originally cre
ated the center and Cheney's posi
tion three years ago, it did so with
the understanding that the Uni
versity would assume the financial
responsibilities after one year.

The University, however, is not
planning to supplement its current
funding for the coalition, which
pays only for a half-time coordina
tor position for the Sexual Assault
Prevention Program, said Dean of
Students Michael Jackson.
Trace Shapiro, who previously
filled the half-time position, left
the University when her term
ended in August.
The University has committed
itself to funding Shapiro's former
position for an additional two
years, and Cowell administrators
are searching for her replacement.
Hut several students say paying
for this half-time position is not
enough, and it is Stanford's duty to
provide funding for other coalition
services.
"It's the University's responsi
bility, as well as the students',' said
senior Sarah Horsley, a member of
the Women's Center Collective.
And senior Sally Matlin, a coali
tion member, said "Sex in the '90s"
must occur next fall.
This summer, the University
contributed $3,000 as one-time
funding for "Sex in the '905," Jack
son said.
But in terms of providing addi
tional funds "it's pretty difficult to
pick and choose which groups get
funding when students voted it down
in the first place," Jackson said.
Instead, the University will
work with a newly formed ASSU
Senate task force to address prob
lems regarding the special-fee

request process, he added.
Director of Student Activities
Nanci Howe said the University
shouldn't automatically fund
Cheney's position or "Sex in the
'90s" because "we're going
through severe budget cuts."
The University should examine
what services it currently provide*
to determine the best way to sup
port women on Stanford's campus,
said Howe, who is a member of the
Women's Center's Advisory Board
Coalition members, however,
plan to press University adminis
trators to provide financial sup
port, Duplessis said.
"To some extent the adminis
tration has helped us already, but
now is the critical time," Duplessis
said. "Many times they've
expressed their commitment to
these issues, but they need to put
money where their mouth is."
Coalition members are also
working with Cowell's Health Pro
motion Program to develop a class
that would train students to staff
the Sexual Assault Resource Center.
The coalition — which first
applied for funding in 1992 — had
never previously had its special-fee
request denied, said Duplessis,
adding that the coalition plans to
reapply for its special-fee funding
this spring.
Cheney's annual salary —
which was $22,000 plus benefits —
was funded by the coalition's spe
cial-fee request, as was the $8,000
for "Sex in the '905."
