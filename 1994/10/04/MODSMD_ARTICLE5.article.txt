# Sex assault educator position eliminated
## 
### Beth Berselli Senior staff writer 
The position of Stanford's full-time sexual
assault prevention educator has been elimi
nated, and operations at the Sexual Assault
Resource Center have come to a temporary
halt due a severe lack of funding for staff
members.
As a result of losing its ASSU special-fee
funding last spring, the Coalition Against
Sexual Assault — the umbrella organization
that supports these services — may also have
to cut other programs such as the annual Ori
entation production "Sex in the '905."
"At this moment the [Sexual Assault Re
source) center is not running," said senior
Virginia Duplessis, the coalition's treasurer
and a volunteer at the center, housed Cowell
Student Health Center.
"It's really pathetic," she said. "We give
out all these resource sheets saying call or
drop in any time, but if students did show up
there would be a closed door. That is a real in
justice to students."
