# Other groups face special fee losses

### Beth Berselli Senior staff writer 
While the Coalition Against Sexual
Assault may have been hit most visibly
by the loss of its special-fee, the other 17
groups denied funding last spring are
also facing financial constraints.
Student funding has been cut back so
substantially that the ASSU Senate is
taking steps to address problems with
the special fee request process, said se
nior M6rk Murdock, a COP member.
Senate leaders will announce the forma
tion of a new task force to study the prob
lem at today's senate meeting.
For the most part, leaders of student
groups which lost their special-fees say
that, although no major pro
grams will be eliminated this year,
most organizations must stream
line their programs and make
renewed efforts to fund raise.
For example, Stanford-in-Gov
ernment will significantly reduce
many of its activities, including its
"Public Policy Program" that
brought big-name speakers such
as Paul Tsongas and Marlin
Fitzwater to campus last year,
said junior Jon Oram, the organi
zation's treasurer.
"The Public Policy Program
will happen this year, but in a far
different way than in the past,"
Oram said.
SlG's staff will try to schedule
local speakers who won't require a
fee or expensive transportation,

he said.
"We have the ability to make it
through this year, but next year
there is a danger this organization
may not exist if funding is denied
again," Oram added.
The loss of funds will hamper
several groups' ability to sponsor
certain events at all.
For example, MEChA — a Chi
cano/Latino student organization
— may be unable to sponsor such
programs as the Raza Conference
during winter quarter and the
Cinco de Mayo celebration, said
sophomore Felipe Barragan, co
chair of MEChA.
To make up for the lost funds,
many student groups plan to con
centrate on fundraising efforts,
including soliciting alumni contri
butions.
The You Can Make A Differ
ence Conference will also pursue
fundraising activities, said Jackie
Schmidt-Posner, staff advisor for

the conference.
Student leaders hope to earn at
least $10,000 to cover the cost of
the conference, including fees for
publicity and speakers, Schmidt-
Posner said.
Although most student groups
are resigned to fundraising, sonic
aren't so pleased at the prospect.
"I don't have time to bake
cookies and sell them," said senior
Sally Matlin, chair of the Rape
Education Project.
The ASSU task force — which
will be composed of both under
graduate and graduate students
— will study the special fee
request process, determine what
the system's problems are and
propose a solution to the student
body, Murdock said.
Students will vote on the task
force's proposal during a special
election to be held the second
week of winter quarter, he
added.
