# Up in arms over 187
## Students organizing to fight proposition 
### Frank Guinan Staff writer 
During an election year, voters can usu
ally expect to see a host of propositions at
tached to the ballot.
But California's Proposition 187 —
which would make undocumented, illegal
immigrants ineligible for public education,
public health care and social services — has
some students and faculty extremely con
cerned and even up in arms over the conse
quences of the measure.
Numerous Stanford student and faculty
organizations are planning to speak out
against the bill in the coming weeks, includ
ing MEChA and the Stanford Latino Law
Students Association.
"For me, personally, I am against it and
everything it stands for," said Felipe Barra
gan, co-chair of the Chicano/Latino student
group MFjChA. "It blames the innocent
children of undocumented workers."

MEChA's first meeting is set for today,
and Barragan said the measure is "definite
ly on Itheir] agenda."
"We'll probably be working with other
organizations on campus and around Cali
fornia" to oppose Proposition 187, he said.
An informal student coalition also was
organized recently to lobby against the
measure. The organization met last Friday
and attracted close to 100 students.
Sophomore Kris Hayashi, a member of
the coalition, said the group only has "a
week and a month before the elections,"
adding that the coalition plans to do the
"basic things," such as encourage voter reg
istration and educate the public.
Proposition 187 is a highly controversial
state measure aimed at curbing the flow of
illegal immigrants into California. Law
makers claim that illegal immigration costs
the state's taxpayers billions of dollars each
year, and must be addressed. Polls
show California residents cur
rently favor the proposal 2-to-l.
Proponents of the hill argue
that it is unfair for state residents
to pay for the education and
health care of non-taxpaying
immigrants. Opponents, on the
other hand, argue that Proposi
tion 187 is racist, mainly targeting
those of Mexican descent. They
also contend that the measure will
not convince immigrants to
return home, and some helieve it
may contribute to crime and
poverty.
A faculty group in the Center

for Chicano Research's Public
Outreach Program has also been
looking into the issue of immigra
tion since last January, said Polit
ical Science Prof. Luis Fraga, the
center's director.
Fraga said Proposition 187 has
come up in meetings and the
group plans to write some opinion
articles soon to address the issue
of immigration.
Although no formal vote has

I think there's a misconception that 187 is
solely against illegal immigrants, but the
truth is that it will affect all of us.'

taken place in his group regarding
the measure, Eraga said, "No one
is in favor of it presently."
Frank Wu, a teaching fellow at
the Law School, took a leave of
absence from his law practice in
San Erancisco to lobby specifically
against Proposition 187 and spoke
at the student coalition's meeting
Friday.
"I think there's a misconcep
tion that 187 is solely against ille

gal immigrants," he said, "but the
truth is that it will affect all of us."
At the Hoover Institution, polit
ical scientist and Visiting Scholar
Bill Evers agreed that Proposition
187 targets all immigrants, not
just the undocumented. Evers said
he does not know of anyone at the
institution who supports the bill,
but said he knows of several anti
-187 efforts on campus.
According to Wu, statewide
support for the bill is currently at
57 percent.
Despite this figure, Barragan
said, "There's still time. ... If we
work hard enough, the bill will
not pass."
Spanish and Portuguese Prof.
Mary Pratt added, "A lot of people
believe the bill will pass. I don't
want to give up that easily.
