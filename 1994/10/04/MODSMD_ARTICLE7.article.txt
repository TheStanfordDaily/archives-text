# Up in arms over 187
## Students organizing to fight proposition 
### Frank Guinan Staff writer 
During an election year, voters can usu
ally expect to see a host of propositions at
tached to the ballot.
But California's Proposition 187 —
which would make undocumented, illegal
immigrants ineligible for public education,
public health care and social services — has
some students and faculty extremely con
cerned and even up in arms over the conse
quences of the measure.
Numerous Stanford student and faculty
organizations are planning to speak out
against the bill in the coming weeks, includ
ing MEChA and the Stanford Latino Law
Students Association.
"For me, personally, I am against it and
everything it stands for," said Felipe Barra
gan, co-chair of the Chicano/Latino student
group MFjChA. "It blames the innocent
children of undocumented workers."

MEChA's first meeting is set for today,
and Barragan said the measure is "definite
ly on Itheir] agenda."
"We'll probably be working with other
organizations on campus and around Cali
fornia" to oppose Proposition 187, he said.
An informal student coalition also was
organized recently to lobby against the
measure. The organization met last Friday
and attracted close to 100 students.
Sophomore Kris Hayashi, a member of
the coalition, said the group only has "a
week and a month before the elections,"
adding that the coalition plans to do the
"basic things," such as encourage voter reg
istration and educate the public.
Proposition 187 is a highly controversial
state measure aimed at curbing the flow of
illegal immigrants into California. Law
makers claim that illegal immigration costs
the state's taxpayers billions of dollars each
