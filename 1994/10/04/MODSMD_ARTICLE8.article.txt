# Capturing Nepal's future on film
## Students spent summer, University grant helping children 
### Solveig Pederson Staff writer 
Riding elephants as jungle transportation, helping
Nepalese children and surviving a bus accident were
all part of last summer's unpaid work for Stanford stu
dents Beatriz de la Mora and Natasha Deganello.
Graduate students de la Mora and Deganello used a
$2000 stipend they received as Donald Kennedy Pub
lic Service Fellows to photograph disadvantaged chil
dren in Nepal.
Although Deganello — a Venezuelan master's stu
dent in journalism — and de la Mora — a Colombian

Ph.D. student in Spanish and Portuguese — have al
ways been interested in public service and children, it
was Deganello's idea to go to Nepal, the fourth poorest
nation in the world.
"We wanted to go as Third World people realizing
that this is a Third World country completely different
from ours," Deganello said.
In their original grant proposal, the students no
ticed that Educate the Children, a small Nepalese or
ganization, needed to be more self-promoting and re

ganizations.
To serve these needs, de la
Mora and Deganello said they
proposed photographing children
from Chepang villages (who come
from the lowest Nepalese caste)
in the south central rain forest.
Nepalese organizations could
then use the photos of children in
trouble in their brochures and
posters, the two proposed.
The two visited various groups
throughout Nepal, walking days
to reach remote villages, and hir
ing an elephant and driver in the
rain forest.
"There were children we met
who had never seen a camera,"
Deganello said. "We took a
Polaroid camera expecting this,

so they could see the picture
almost instantly."
"Most are working children by
the age of 6; working in carpet
factories and other places,"
Deganello said.
These photos will be used to
increase awareness of the child
workers, she said.
"It's a cultural problem and
not everything should be blamed
on the government," de la Mora
said. "It's a way of life, it's a fact
of life; if they don't work, they
don't eat."
During their stay in Nepal,
Deganello and de la Mora stayed
in the homes of the Nepalese peo
ple.
"Nepalese people are very
open, friendly, warm — they're
wonderful people," de la Mora
said. "Not once did we encounter
any hostility."

Ironically, the two never ended
up working with the Chepang,
who were the original focus of
their proposal.
On their way back to Katman
du to wrap up the summer and fly
home, they decided to stop at
Chitwan to see the Chepang vil
lages. Fifteen minutes from
Chitwan the bus flipped over
twice on the slippery, rainy road.
Deganello was the only person
aboard the overcrowded bus who
was uninjured. Three people died
in the accident.
"It was like being in a
blender," de la Mora said. She
suffered an injured back and deep
cuts on her elbow which left visi
ble scars.
"They drive like maniacs,"
Deganello said. "This is the Third
World." Accidents like this are
common in Nepal and receive lit

tie or no public attention, she
said.
"The accident made us post
pone everything," de la Mora
said. "We never saw the Chepang
at all."
The duo spent the week after
the accident recovering in bed.
"Afler that, we stayed one more
week to tie up loose ends and fin
ish the project," Deganello said.
From their summer of photog
raphy and research, the two have
almost 70 rolls of undeveloped
film of children in need of help.
But until de la Mora and
Deganello raise the money to
develop the film, using the photos
will be impossible. The money
from the fellowship was only
enough to cover about 80 percent
of de la Mora's and Deganello's
expenses; they said that they pro
vided the rest.

Nonetheless, back at Stanford,
the two are busy planning how
their efforts can best help
Nepalese children.
Deganello and de la Mora are
currently designing posters to
inform tourists how to help the
street children. The posters will
display their photos taken during
the summer, and will dissuade
tourists from giving children
handouts.
"Children see tourists as mil
lionaire gods who have lots of
money; it's a way of life to ask
tourists for money," Deganello
said.
The funds for the Donald
Kennedy Public Service Fellow
ship were provided by an anony
mous donor in 1986, with the
stipulation that it be named in
honor of former University Pres
ident Donald Kennedy after his

retirement.
"It's to really honor his com
mitment to public and communi
ty service, which is what his
administration was known for,"
said Sue Gray, Local Programs
and Undergraduate Fellowship
coordinator at the Haas Center.
The fellowship is intended to
allow students an opportunity to
volunteer their efforts as well as
augment their education.
"We come from countries
where you see children on the
street so you're aware of these
things and you keep working with
them from your youth," de la
Mora said.
"It was expanding our bound
aries," Deganello agreed. "A place
we've never been to, a country
we've never visited — although it
was lumped in with our countries
as a Third World country."
