The Care You Need, The Caring You Deserve
Last September, Diane Bradford gave birth to four boys - the first quadruplets ever born to
Palo Alto Medical Foundation patients. The birth, not linked to fertility dmgs, was a one in
700,(XX) shot. Born at Stanford University Hospital, five-and-a-half-weeks premature, the
boys recently celebrated their first birthdays and are doing very well.

"We thought roe were
going to have two kids,
maybe three at most, but
that all changed when we
had the boys. I've been
really pleased with the aw
we've received at the Palo
Alto Medical Foundation.
Our pediatrician, Dr. Ross
DeHovitz, has been
wonderful. In fact, I've
been very impressed with
the entire pediatrics
department.
"We're really thrilled
alxmt these guys and can't
imagine not having any
one of them. Having a
large family is a neat thing.
The boys arc just great.
Until you'iv a parent, you
ain't even imagine the joy
children can bring."
