Coup leader flees Haiti
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP)
Police chief Michel Francois sneaked out
of Haiti in the dark yesterday, the first
coup leader to abandon the struggle
against American soldiers who poured
into Haiti to install a democratic govern
ment.
Several hours later, a militia leader
renounced violence and called off his
opposition to the planned return next
week of exiled President Jean-Bertrand
Aristide.
"No more violence," said Emmanuel
Constant, the leader of the pro-army
militia FRAPH, whose headquarters
were taken over by the American soldiers
Monday.
Constant told reporters: "I'm asking
everyone to put down the stones, to put

down the tires and to put down the
guns."
Mandela speaks in D.C.
WASHINGTON (AP) - Grateful for
past help and seeking more, Nelson Man
dela asked Americans yesterday to
expand the support they gave South
Africa in the victory against apartheid â€”
this time by helping revive his nation's
economy.
"Come and invest in our country," he
said. "I come here . . . knowing I will not
go back with empty hands."
President Clinton welcomed Mandela
to an exuberant White House ceremony
underscoring the 76-year-old African
leader's rise from imprisonment in the
apartheid state to the presidency of
South Africa's new democracy.
