# Earthquake hits north of Japan
## 16 dead, 200 wounded in strongest regional tremor since 1968 
### 
TOKYO (AP) — A major undersea
earthquake killed at least 16 people in
Russia's remote Kuril Islands late yester
day, jolted Japan and triggered tidal
waves on both sides of the Pacific.
A quake with a preliminary magnitude
of 7.9 hit near the sparsely populated
Kuril Island chain north of Japan. About
200 people in northern Japan were
injured by broken glass and falling
objects.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center
in Hawaii issued a tidal wave warning for
all Pacific islands and coastal areas,
including the west coast of the United
States and Canada.
In Moscow, Russia's Ministry for
Emergency Situations said the bodies of
at least 16 people were found on three
islands in the chain.
Ministry spokesman Anatoly Streltsov

did not say whether the victims were killed
by huge tidal waves reported in the region.
One hit the small island of Zelyony,
home to a border guards unit and fisher
men's settlement. Officials did not imme
diately know what happened to the resi
dents, Streltsov said.
Aftershocks were continuing. In some
parts of the Kurils, 18-inch cracks were vis
ible in the earth after the quake, he said.
By early this morning, about 40 small
tsunami waves had been observed in
Japan. Most were less than three feet
high, although one was six feet. There
were no reports of any damage.
Hawaii closed its public schools and
beaches and ordered residents of coastal
areas to evacuate.
Most of the damage and injuries from
the quake in Japan occured on the north
ernmost main island of Hokkaido, but

buildings shook as far as 650 miles away in
Tokyo.
The quake — which lasted more than
a minute — was centered 13 miles
beneath the Pacific Ocean floor, near the
southern end of the Kuril chain. Japan's
Central Meteorological Agency estimated
the quake's prelimary magnitude at 7.9,
making it the strongest to hit the region
in 26 years.
On Japan's lightly populated Hokkaido
island, the late-night quake cracked roads,
caused gas leaks and flooded streets. One
fire was reported in the town of Nemuro,
and more than 13,460 households in east
ern Hokkaido lost electric power, said
Kazuhiro Kojima of Hokkaido Electric Co.
Television stations broadcast warnings
for people in low-lying areas to flee, show
ing maps of Japan with endangered areas
flashing in red.
