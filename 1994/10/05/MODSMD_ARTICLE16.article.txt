University should leave
its mistakes behind and
improve waste handling

THE UNIVERSITY'S research
and education facilities have
made history again. This
time, however, the headlines
weren't about a scientific discovery
but a $2.65 million settlement the
University reached with the Cali
fornia Environmental Protection
Agency — the largest settlement
ever against a California education
al institution.
CEPA claimed Stanford had
committed about 640 violations
over a six-year period, ranging
from errors as minor as an
improperly dated label to more
serious violations such as a leak
ing container of toxic waste.
Officials from the Department
of Toxic Substances Control have
claimed that Stanford's haz
ardous waste violations were
numerous and extensive. DTSC
spokesperson Allan Hirsch said
inspections had uncovered an
"exceptional number" of acci
dents and serious problems with
Stanford waste management
practices.
The University's representa
tives, on the other hand, have
repeatedly asserted that Stan
ford's violations were mostly
labeling and paperwork errors
that posed no danger to Stanford
personnel or to the environment.
University Director of Environ
mental Health and Safety Larry
Gibbs has claimed that many reg
ulations were designed for an
industrial environment and can
not be practically applied to a lab
oratory environment such as
Stanford's.
Few may ever know whose
story lies closer to the truth, but
Stanford's previous violations lie
in the past. What matters now is
that having agreed to the settle

ment, the University has accepted
an obligation to comply with all
regulations specified by law and
by the CEPA settlement. With
proper training and precautionary
measures, small, costly mistakes
like improper labeling — as well
as potentially life-threatening
errors — can be easily avoided in
the future.
The University has already
pledged $1.65 million to that end.
But it's a shame that for Stanford
— one of the world's premier
research institutions — minimal
compliance is a goal rather than a
given.
As it implements new person
nel-training and compliance mea
sures, the University should take
a serious look at its commitment
to hazardous waste management,
considering not just what is legal
ly required but also what is best
for the environment and the
health and safety of faculty, staff
and students.
Stanford might even take a step
forward, breaking new ground in
health and safety management
and setting an example for other
research institutions to follow.
At the same time, the Universi
ty should also work with the state
to ensure that environmental reg
ulations are fine-tuned to treat
research institutions in a realistic
manner — a process already
being planned, according to Vice
Provost and Dean of Research
and Graduate Policy Charles
Kruger.
During those negotiations, Uni
versity officials must be ready to
acknowledge that many regula
tions which may seem unreason
ably cumbersome may serve a
valid purpose in terms of health
and safety.
The conflict with CEPA will
always remain an embarrassing
blemish on Stanford's fine repu
tation as a research facility. But
with a little work, the University
can learn from its past mistakes
and turn them into positive
changes in the future.
