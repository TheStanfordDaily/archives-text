££ HINESE peo-
I pie do not nor-
V-ymally share
their deepest feelings in
public, but today is a day
to speak openly about
our feelings. It is also a
day to end the mystery
about love, marriage and
family in traditional Chi
nese society."

These were my opening words to Jack
(a Stanford alumnus and former resident
assistant) and Hedy at their wedding two
weeks ago. I was a groomsman and one of
the honored few whom Jack and Hedy
invited to share a secret about how to
maintain magic in marriage.
Their wedding was beautiful and
unique. It was designed to be multicul
tural, and the ceremony offered many
lessons; each person and activity con
tributed to an infinite number of lessons
about multicultural life. It promoted
social unity without requiring cultural
uniformity. The wedding was an art
form, speaking volumes about Jack and
Hedy's values and feelings about commu
nity.
There were powerful images through
out the day. Arnold, an African Ameri
can, and Lew, a European American, per
formed the ceremony together. Arnold
invoked the spirit of our ancestors to
open; they offered a Native American
prayer to close; classical flute and violin
music ushered in the wedding party and

a pop tune ushered us out. A black jazz
ensemble played during the reception.
Jack's mom gave her blessing in Chinese;
Jack's romantic vows made us cry.
Hedy's mom made us roar with laughter
when offering her first advice. She said,
with tongue in cheek, "Learn to keep
your mouth shut sometimes!"
Surrounding all of us in the wedding
party at the Palace of Fine Arts were peo
ple of different hues, sprinkled with
interracial marriages, biracial children,
immigrant parents and grandparents.
Even weekend strollers stopped to watch,
to listen and to cheer. This was a differ
ent kind of an American dream, not a
melting pot drowning those who pre
ferred a salad bowl. Perhaps this was the
"Chinese Hot Pot" poet Wing Tek Lum
wrote of:
My Dream of America
is like da bin louh (Chinese Hot Pot)
with people of all persuasions and tastes
sitting around a common pot
chopsticks and basket scoop here and
there
some cooking squid and others beef
some tofu or watercress
all in one broth
like a stew that really isn't
as each one chooses what s/he wishes to
eat
only that the pot and fire are shared
along with the good company
and the sweet soup
spooned out at the end of the meal.
The benefits of multiculturalism were

very evident this day. The wedding
stirred my idealism and hopes for a world
without borders and where Mother
Earth's resources would support all of
her children without regard to artificial
boundaries. It would be a world that
would be unafraid of aliens.
I was also happy that day that I was
fortunate enough to enjoy an education
that included Asian-American Studies,
an education that opened my eyes to a
multicultural life. It enabled me to
reevaluate my life and synthesize my
Asian and American heritage. It allowed
me to have pride in myself because I
could interpret the ways I related to the
world. For example, it allowed me to
define Asian men's stoicism in a more
favorable light at Jack's wedding.
"Instead of openly expressing affec
tion, Asian men are known to buy their
wives refrigerators to express their love."
The crowd roared with laughter. "How
ever, buying refrigerators is inextricably
linked to the concept of duty and obliga
tion to marriage and family. The buying
of appliances and practicing duty and
obligation are born from a powerful, uni
fying principle that undergirds tradition
al Chinese life: it is better to give love
than to receive love." I could feel Arnold
and Lew nodding their approval behind
me.

tural Educator. His wife reminds him that
he bought her a vacuum cleaner.
