'Gay Liberation 9 attack was more than a thought crime

IN HIS LETTER to The Daily, Alexan
der Rawls wants to tell the Stanford
community what the "real question is"
concerning the vandalism of the George
Segal sculpture. Mr. Rawls should go one
step further and ask himself what the
"real question is" behind his own faulty
thinking and blatant misrepresentation. I
would suggest that the word "homopho
bia" stands at the real center of his letter.
Mr. Rawls dismisses hate-crime laws as
"thought crime" laws without realizing
that there is a difference between thinking
something and translating that thought
into a violent action. When those thoughts
become the impetus to act, they are consid
ered motivations. The motivation behind a
criminal act is as crucial in determining
the appropriate punishment as identifying
the act itself. Actions rarely originate in a
mental vacuum. Hence, premeditated mur
der is considered a far worse crime than
manslaughter. Similarly, the defacement
of the sculpture, if intended to validate
hatred against an established and visible
community, is a worse crime than an act of
simple drunken vandalism.
Mr. Rawls thinks he knows how to easi
ly distinguish between a work of art and a

political statement. The reality is that
works of art are never created independent
of cultural, historical and political influ
ences and interests. Determining whether
a given object is a "work of art" or a "work
of politics" in an objective manner is gen
erally a futile task when the range of possi
ble responses to a work is as wide as the
range of possible human experiences. The
more relevant questions to ask may be
what effect a created object attempts to
achieve aesthetically and politically and
what role the work plays in its community.
With its white plaster figures and quiet,
discreet poses — a pair of men standing
next to one another, a female couple seated
— "Gay Liberation" is a gentle call for
understanding and acceptance on a cam
pus which attempts to support ideals of
toleration and mutual respect. Hardly a
radical statement, but certainly a beautiful
one in many eyes. Accordingly, the sculp
ture should be treated with respect,
whether or not one "agrees" with it.
Mr. Rawls entirely misrepresents the
statues, asserting that they are merely a
crude political gesture. It should first be
noted that they are located between the
Quad and the Physics Tank — unfortu-

nately, rather far from the center of cam
pus for many people. I usually see them
while rushing between classes, dodging
bikes and rollerbladers — not really the
best way to notice a piece of art. Between
their out-of-the-way location and their
inobtrusiveness, the statues are about as
"in-your-face" as a grove of trees. As far as
political statements go, Segal's sculptures
are pretty discreet, more like a gentle
whisper for a community to wake up than
a slap in the face. In contrast to Mr. Rawls'
narrow-minded view, I would suggest that
the statues (which I have admired since
freshman year, when I had no idea they
were entitled "Gay Liberation" or that
they had any political intention) are an ele
gant melding of art and politics, beloved by
much of the Stanford community, gay and
straight. It deserves far better treatment
than either drunken vandalism or Mr.
Rawls' crude, hostile misrepresentation.
I am further saddened to realize that
some people still believe that there exists
something such as an "instinctive repul
sion to homosexuality." Where exactly
would Mr. Rawls like to locate the biologi
cal basis for his imaginary instinct? There
is much social conditioning which tells

many people that they must hate homosex
uality, just as there was once much social
conditioning that said that Jews were evil
and had horns. To my ears it is blatantly
obvious, but perhaps I should mention
that gays, bisexuals and lesbians are
human beings who deserve all the rights,
respect, privileges, protections, responsibil
ities and freedoms given to straight men
and women. I would suggest that a failure
to understand this is the real cause of Mr.
Rawls' belief that homosexuality is repul
sive.
In the end, the vandalism of the Segal
sculptures was a criminal act, a particular
ly hateful one, and should be treated
accordingly. The persons responsible
should be prosecuted without any prefer
ential treatment for being Stanford stu
dents. And I would hope that more people
would slow down for a moment to admire
the quiet elegance of the sculptures and
contemplate the fact that comradeship and
love — whether between a man and a
woman, two men or two women — is a
thing of great beauty to be cherished and
made into art.

In the end, the vandalism of the Segal
sculptures was a criminal act, a particular
ly hateful one, and should be treated
accordingly. The persons responsible
should be prosecuted without any prefer
ential treatment for being Stanford stu
dents. And I would hope that more people
would slow down for a moment to admire
the quiet elegance of the sculptures and
contemplate the fact that comradeship and
love — whether between a man and a
woman, two men or two women — is a
thing of great beauty to be cherished and
made into art.
