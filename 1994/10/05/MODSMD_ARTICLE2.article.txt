# Undergrad science gets $1.8M boost
## 
### Michael Slemmer Editorial staff 
The Howard Hughes Medical Insti
tute announced yesterday that the
University will receive a $1.8 million,
four-year grant to foster undergradu
ate science — a continuation of a six
year-old program already in place at
Stanford.
The funding is part of a total $86
million in grants which the institute is
awarding to 62 universities nationally
as part of its $290 million Undergradu
ate Biological Science Education Pro

gram.
According to Biological Sciences
Prof. Craig Heller, an associate dean of
research, the grant will be applied to a
variety of programs both for students
on campus and in the surrounding com
munity, providing opportunities rang
ing from incentives for minority and fe
male students to purchases of equip
ment and increased laboratory space.
In addition, the money will go to
sponsor classes and summer programs
for high school students in the hopes of
stimulating their interest in science
and medicine.

The grant money will encourage
students who otherwise might not have
participated in research to consider the
option, Heller said.
He said that the additional money
for chemistry research will extend the
Hughes program already in place from
students majoring in biology to stu
dents in other majors like chemistry
and human biology.
"They're taking advantage of the
physical and intellectual resources of
the University and getting excited
about research careers," he said in a
statement.
Undergraduate students who
take advantage of the program
will, in most cases, receive
grants for honors research to be
conducted during the summer
before their senior year — cul
minating in a senior thesis
which reports on the research
already completed.
Though the amount of money
awarded to each student under
the program will vary, in the
past five years Hughes has pro
vided grants for more than 200
undergraduate biology majors
each year to participate in labo
ratorv research.
