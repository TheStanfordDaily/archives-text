## Gene codes may decipher incriminating evidence 
### Sara Bhargava 
Debates about DNA testing to identify criminal sus
pects are heating up courtrooms across the country,
most notably in the well-publicized case of O.J. Simp
son.
DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, encodes inherited
genetic information specific to an individual and serves
as an important indicator of a person's identity.
DNA consists of four molecules that form two sets of
complementary base pairs. "On the average, two indi
viduals vary in one of every 500 base pairs," said Dr.
David Botstein of the Stanford Medical Center.
This is a large amount of diversity, considering the
billions of base pairs in a strand of human DNA, Bot
stein said, adding that the variation among individuals'
DNA sequences provides a method of personal identifi
cation, a sort of molecular signature.
Because variations in DNA molecules can uniquely
identify an individual, genetic typing has gained
increasing importance as a tool in criminal investiga
tions over the last decade. DNA found in human body
fluids at crime scenes can be extracted and matched to
samples drawn from suspects.
Since the first use of DNA testing in a 1986 trial in
Pennsylvania, two techniques of genetic determination
have increased in popularity.
The technique of restriction fragment length poly
morphism, or RFLP, requires a large amount of intact
DNA and therefore a larger specimen sample. RFLP
genetic identification uses a restriction enzyme which
cleaves DNA at specific locations of certain base pair
sequences. This results in a set of fragments of varying
lengths which are then separated by gel electrophore
sis.
This technique places samples on a gel and sends
electric current through the material. Larger frag
ments separate from smaller ones, because the differ
ent sized samples travel at different velocities through
the gel. Laboratory analysis compares two genetic sam
ples to determine if they match.
Another DNA testing technique known as poly
merase chain reaction, or PCR, is based on the amplifi
cation of small polymorphic fragments of DNA. A poly
morphic gene is one with a sequence that varies
between different people. For example, the set of genes
that code for eye color and hair color are considered
polymorphic.
The PCR test would not be informative if the genet

ic sequences were identical, explained Dr. Henry
Ehrlich, director of human genetics at Roche Molecular
Systems.
PCR amplification produces millions of copies of
the genes on any fragment of DNA. The process
involves synthesizing a primer, a small series of base
pairs, which then binds to the specified gene. The
primer directs DNA polymerase, the enzyme involved
in DNA replication, to make copies of the gene in ques
tion.
PCR is extremely valuable as a forensic technique
because it can be performed on small samples, even "a
single hair or saliva from a cigarette butt or an enve
lope," Ehrlich said. The former post-doctorate from
Stanford worked on developing the PCR technique for
genetic typing.
Although the PCR method often takes longer than
RFLP, the necessary sample can be "the size of a pin
head as opposed to a dime," said a member of the FBl's
Evidence Response Team. PCR is now being used
quite widely, he said. Several different types of PCR
genetic tests are used in hundreds of labs around the
world.
A response from a crime lab using RFLP can take as
a little as one week or as long as six, and with each suc
cessive test, investigators glean additional information.
The information gained becomes more and more spe
cific. "You know some things right away and some
things later," the Response Team member said.
Matching an increased number of genes enhances
the significance of the results. For instance, if one hun
dred possible base pair sequences exist for a certain
gene location, the chances of a match are one percent.
When two sequences are identified the frequency of
matches becomes one in ten thousand.
Gathering DNA for the tests generally involves
scraping a sample from the scene of a crime. The spec
imens used in DNA testing can be blood, semen, hair,
or "anything in which a few cells might be left behind,"
said Botstein.
The results of genetic typing of a specimen are then
compared to similar typing of a sample, usually of
blood, from the suspect. This reference sample can also
be non-invasive such as a cheek scrape or a strand of
hair.
If the samples do not match, an 'exclusion' results.
"This is a very important aspect of genetic typing,"
Ehrlich said.
Proving the innocence of someone who has already

been convicted who is serving a jail sentence can be
vital to justice. "Exclusion is pretty straightforward,"
he added.
On the other hand, a matching set of samples is
called an 'inclusion.'
"The significance of this is dependent on the fre
quency of that genetic type in the population.. .one in
ten is much less significant than if fthe match isl one in
a million," Ehrlich said.
DNA tests are different from other identification
procedures such as fingerprinting. The FBI agent
explained that the DNA testing procedures are based
on percentages and not exact matches.
A suspect may have a chance of matching a DNA
sample genetically, but matching samples do not neces
sarily prove the suspect's guilt. Matches between infre
quent genetic types may be stronger indications of guilt
than matches between more common gene sequences.

Questions about the reliability of such procedures
still plague some legal systems. Most scientists agree
that DNA testing is a useful forensic tool; genetic typ
ing is "very reliable if it is done right," said Botstein.
The FBI team member warned, however, that one
would be foolish not to say there is the possibility of
human or laboratory error in the process of genetic typ
ing.
As DNA testing becomes a standard procedure in
criminal investigations, the FBI is creating a nation
wide bank of DNA typing results of convicted crimi
nals.
"A good number of states are well on the way to set
ting up databases," said the FBI agent. He added that
the nationwide database will be established by consoli
dating those of individual states.
California is already collecting genetic information
from violent felons being released from prison.
