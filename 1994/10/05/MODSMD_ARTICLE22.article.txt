A joint US. — European space
mission will investigate the
'music of the spheres' with the
new SOHO spacecraft, which con
tains equipment to chart acoustic
waves travelling through the
sun's interior.
Stanford astronomy professor
Philip Scherrer is part of a com
bined effort between NASA, the
European Space Agency, Lock
heed, and universities around the
world to conduct helioseismology
experiments in space.
Helioseismology studies the
sun's interior by examining the
sound waves propogating through
the star.

The mission is scheduled for
NASA launch next July. "It is an
opportunity to measure charac
teristics of the inside of a star,"
Scherrer said.
Acoustic waves travelling
through the sun are created by
turbulence in the photosphere,
the sun's upper layer. The turbu
lence emerges as granulations, or
puffs of convection energy, that
travel outward from the star's hot
core.
The alternating compression
and elongation of solar gases along
the direction of wave travel cre
ates acoustic wave propagation.
Solar temperatures range from
ten million degrees at the core to
about 5000 degrees in the outer
layers of gas. Since sound travels

faster with increasing tempera
tures, acoustic waves in the sun
are moving through a medium of
increasing sound speed as they
move toward the core.
Waves are refracted away from
mediums of increasing sound
speed. "That same phenomenon
is what we use to study the sun,"
Scherrer said.
Sound waves that travel into
the sun are refracted back as the
approach the hot, high sound
speed core. Near the surface, the
waves are reflected back down
towards the interior because of
the sharp drop in temperature
and density at the surface of the
star.
As a result, the sun forms a
concentric spherical cavity that
traps a wave of any given wave
length. "It's just like a resonant
cavity in a musical instrument,"
Scherrer explained. "You can
excite it with acoustical energy
and then observe it to find that it
resonates in normal modes of
oscillation," he continued.
A mode of oscillation is the
path that the wave follows in the
sun's interior. The period of the
wave and the integral of the
sound travel time provide infor
mation about the sound speed.
If two modes penetrate the
same solar cavity, there is a slight
difference in travel time between
the modes. These differences in
travel times, as well as the sound
speed for the regions between the
waves, provide information for
maps of sound speed vs. depth
and temperature vs. depth.
The sun oscillates in ten mil
lion different modes at the same
time. Each mode is a result of
energy from the photosphere
granulations.
Scherrer likened the sound
waves excited by this convection

energy to the ringing of a bell in a
sandstorm. Blowing sand hits the
bell from all directions, and each
impact excites acoustic waves in
the bell.
In a similar manner, the sun is
'ringing' from the energy in the
granulation puffs. Even one spot
on the sun's surface may be oscil
lating with amplitudes of a few
hundred meters per second. The
different acoustic modes have dif
ferent shapes, like the variety of
wave patterns that roll across the
surface of a drum.
The SOHO (solar and helio
spheric observatory) craft will
help scientists investigate the
solar interior because it will pro
vide continuous measurements
for six years.
Solar observation stations on
earth cannot gather such exten
sive data because of gaps pro
duced by sunsets and bad weath
er. Compiling data from instru
ments at different stations also
causes data distortion.
Researchers need to look at
each acoustic mode for many
times its lifetime and measure
oscillations continuously for long
time periods. Obtaining continu
ous data may enable scientists to
map rotation and structural ele
ments of the interior, as well as
the dynamics of large scale con
vection.
Scherrer described the prob
lems of analyzing acoustic waves
to measure the sun. "It's like
measuring a dent in a trumpet
cone by listening to the trumpet,
measuring all frequencies, and
trying to model exactly the shape
of the horn," he said. "We're try
ing to find the dents in the sun."
Data gathered from the SOHO
craft will be analyzed and com-
