Visitors walking up the stairs to the sec
ond floor of Meyer library shouldn't expect to
see shelves and shelves of musty books.
Ancient tomes have been replaced by state
of-the-art electronic equipment, transform
ing Meyer's second floor into an interactive
multimedia center for Stanford students and
faculty.
The pilot media center, Meyer Media and
Computing Center, is part of a coalition
including twenty-two educational institutions
and nine major multimedia companies. As
part of the center, the Curriculum Develop
ment Lab (CDL) has been available since last
winter quarter. Lab director Charles Kerns
said he hopes that the center will be useful to
students as well as faculty.
The CDL has been busy since the center

opened, Kerns said, adding that the library is
now opening a new multimedia studio espe
cially for students as part of the CDL. "We
want to have two separate areas, one for fac
ulty and one for the students, because they
have different needs," Kerns said.
As an interactive media center, the facili
ties on Meyer's renovated second floor provide
a variety of services. The new equipment
includes twelve video digitizing stations which
allow users to digitize and edit various clips to
create movies.
For example, if a student wanted to show
differences between an original film and a
remake, he or she could do so by comparing
and contrasting clips from various scenes.
Normally the student would have to explain
this without the use of video images.
However, Kerns noted some limitations to
editing possibilities. For full-screen, VHS

quality video, the entire movie must be less
than ten minutes, because the disk array can
only hold about ten minutes of full-screen
video. Longer film segments must be edited in
sections.
Sets of video clips which last longer that an
hour but are smaller than the full screen can
be transferred to a CD-ROM. There is a rela
tively small fee (less than twenty dollars) for
this service; other services are free of charge.
Editing facilities also allow users to note
desired changes and then make alterations
later while piecing the clips together. This
option permits creative style changes like fad
ing in and out on a scene.
The center's analog editing station permits
users to edit film clips longer than ten min
utes. The station is much older than the digi-
