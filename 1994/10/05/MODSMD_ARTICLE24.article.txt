# Your worst nightmare:
## Snores chase the slumber away 
### Cris Niell Staff writer 
e:My roommate snores so
loudly that our neighbors
go running for the earth
shelters. What can I do to
make her stop ?
â€” Sleepless in Serra
A:lt seems like you have been
cursed with one of the most
severe roommate

challenges. It's probably
almost as annoying as
being Fred Savage's room
mate and hearing that
background voice come on
at the beginning and end
of each day.
Snoring is actually
the vibration of the tis
sues at the back of the
mouth and nose as you
breathe in. It works
kind of like a whoopee
cushion in your throat.
As you breathe in,
negative air pressure is
created in the respirato-

ry tract, which makes your throat
want to contract, like when you
suck on a straw too hard. Nor
mally the muscles in the throat
resist this pressure and keep your
airway clear.
When you are asleep, however,
these muscles relax somewhat,
and the airway can partially close
when you breathe in. At this point
the whoopee cushion effect sets
in, and you get the annoying buzz
saw sound. Sleeping on your back,
or in any other position which
forces the airway closed, exacer
bates this effect.
Several factors are significant
in whether or not a person snores.
One of the most influential is age.
Few young people snore, but half
of all people over 35 snore, so along
with the Hair Club for Men and
working at real jobs, this is one
more thing to make you worry
about getting old.
Another determining factor is
sex. Men are about 50 percent
more likely to snore than women.
Although this isn't completely
understood yet, one suggestion is
that the female hormone proges
terone increases the muscle tone
in the upper throat, which would
help keep the airway open when
you sleep. Another idea is that
men spend more time breathing
through their mouth when they
sleep, which increases the
chances of snoring.

Being overweight also greatly
increases the chances of snoring,
since some of that weight gets dis
tributed as fatty tissue in the
throat. In addition to constricting
your airway, this extra tissue acts
as a sounding board which actual
ly amplifies the noise.
Very intense snoring, especial
ly if the person sounds like they
are gasping for air, may actually
lead to obstructive sleep apnea.

This condition occurs
when constriction of
the airway completely
stops the airflow.
This is bad
news for several rea
sons. First of all, people
with sleep apnea are
always tired, because
they fall asleep for a
while, and then wake
up because they can't
breathe. Also, lack of
oxygen for over ten sec
onds many times a
night can cause health
problems.
So what can vou

do about snoring, you ask? Well,
one of the journals suggested
sewing a tennis ball into the back
of the accused snorer's pajama's
to keep them from sleeping on
their back. Sounds like a fun idea
even if they don't snore. There
are also various devices that keep
your neck in the right position for
your airway to stay clear.
The only drug known to help
snoring is caffeine, which keeps a
person in light sleep. Snoring usu
ally occurs in the deeper stages of
sleep.
In drastic cases, where snoring
may actually be a health hazard, a
uvulopharyngopalotoplasty can
be performed. This is basically a
big word for an operation where
they take a chunk out of the back
of your throat.
Of course, before you whip out
your pocketknife and attempt
this on your roommate be fore
warned that this operation has
serious risks and is usually only
performed in life-threatening sit
uations.
However, if your roommate is
still keeping you up all night, just
keep a shoe handy near the bed; if
you have good enough aim you
can probably wake them up long
enough for you to fall asleep.
