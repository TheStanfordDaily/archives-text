## Couch spuds unite

Television for a sports fan is
like an aphrodisiac for the sex
crazed.
Without television, closet
weekend sports warriors
couldn't live out pathetic, vicar
ious lives through their heroes
on the tube. Grown men
wouldn't be able to sprint
around their living rooms and
flop on the couch, grunting and
roaring after Emmitt Smith
goes over the top for a rushing
touchdown.

How about the nine-to-five
computer consultant who gets
down with his buddies and
attempts the Super Bowl Shuf
fle after Steve Young connects
with Jerry Rice? The armchair
quarterback who sprains an
ankle trying to jump off his
extended La-Z-Boy recliner?
Where would all those
pathetic images of a lazier, fatter
America fade away to if it wasn't
for television — the little black
box which gives you College
Game Day on NBC, NFL on
FOX, Monday Night Football,
Notre Dame Saturday, Wide
World of Sports on ABC, not to
mention other sports during
other seasons?
Maybe you and I could pick
up gardening or something,
maybe take a nice CIV book
(Gilgamesh, perhaps) up to the
Dish and suntan for a day? Or
better yet, we can hang out at
Escondido Village and watch
them play boccie ball, or whatev
er they do there.
I'm serious, the übermensch
behind this entire sports televi
sion thing understands all your
wants and needs, and your
weekend sports intake will be
subtly tailored to stimulate all
your senses.
Besides the adrenaline rush
