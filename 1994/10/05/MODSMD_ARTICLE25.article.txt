## Couch spuds unite 
### 
Television for a sports fan is
like an aphrodisiac for the sex
crazed.
Without television, closet
weekend sports warriors
couldn't live out pathetic, vicar
ious lives through their heroes
on the tube. Grown men
wouldn't be able to sprint
around their living rooms and
flop on the couch, grunting and
roaring after Emmitt Smith
goes over the top for a rushing
touchdown.

How about the nine-to-five
computer consultant who gets
down with his buddies and
attempts the Super Bowl Shuf
fle after Steve Young connects
with Jerry Rice? The armchair
quarterback who sprains an
ankle trying to jump off his
extended La-Z-Boy recliner?
Where would all those
pathetic images of a lazier, fatter
America fade away to if it wasn't
for television — the little black
box which gives you College
Game Day on NBC, NFL on
FOX, Monday Night Football,
Notre Dame Saturday, Wide
World of Sports on ABC, not to
mention other sports during
other seasons?
Maybe you and I could pick
up gardening or something,
maybe take a nice CIV book
(Gilgamesh, perhaps) up to the
Dish and suntan for a day? Or
better yet, we can hang out at
Escondido Village and watch
them play boccie ball, or whatev
er they do there.
I'm serious, the übermensch
behind this entire sports televi
sion thing understands all your
wants and needs, and your
weekend sports intake will be
subtly tailored to stimulate all
your senses.
Besides the adrenaline rush


Kathryn
Yang
that accompanies all sports games,
and disregarding the emotional sat
isfaction/devastation sports create,
have you ever counted the number
of phallic symbols presented during
each sportscast?
For the guys especially (since
sportscasts are still molded to male
tastes, but females can't help but

notice), why is it that after every
exciting play the television station
cuts to a beer commercial? There's
nothing wrong with that, but they
rarely show canned beer; it's always
longneck bottles and it's always
foaming.
Yeah, I know I shouldn't believe
everything they tell me on 20/20,
but it's at least a thought you can
share at your next Mass Comm. or
Econ. section.
Despite all that, though, there is
a positive side to televised sports.
First, it's cheap. Imagine flying to

South Bend for the Stanford-Notre
Dame game and then to Washing
ton for the UCLA-Washington
game on Saturday, and then shut
tling to Candlestick Park on Sunday
to catch the 49ers and the Eagles
before a cross-country red-eye out to
see the Pats and Green Bay. That's
not to mention the quick stop in
Pittsburgh the next day for the
Monday Night matchup.
And second, televised sports
forces you to be somewhat social
when you scratch those hard-to
reach-places while lounging in your

underwear on the weekends.
Invite your floor down to watch
us get clobbered by the Fighting
Irish. Bond with your housemates
as Randall Cunningham stomps all
over Steve Young. Get completely
smashed during the Seahawks
game. Practice synchronized spew
ing in the lounge during the Mon
day Night contest.
Then again, and-socialitis might
be a direct result of couch-potato
inbreeding. For all the group orgies
in front of the television on Monday
nights. there are lonely spoils fanat

ics who yell themselves silly and
sweat along with the band at half
time while popping pretzels from
their 10-lb. Price Club bulks.
There are also fans who celebrate
touchdowns with their pets, obvi
ously gaining immense pleasure by
recapping the scoring drive to their
feline/canine/equine/etc. friends.
How about synchronized slam
dunks with Michael Jordan when
you're all alone? MJ's basket is 10
feet high, your Nerf hoop slouches
on the door frame.
That's not necessarily sad or

depressing; it's just a fact. The sheer
quantity of televised sports isn't
exactly a good thing, but who's
going to be the first to lash out at it,
considering the Mighty Morphin
Power Rangers and Roseanne share
the same demented air waves?
No matter how socially unaccept
able or corrupted television may be,
I still want my suped-up cable. I
want my ESPN.

lust plop Kathryn down on Saturday
afternoon and hand her the remote,
oh yeah, hold her phone calls too.

want my ESPN.

lust plop Kathryn down on Saturday
afternoon and hand her the remote,
oh yeah, hold her phone calls too.
