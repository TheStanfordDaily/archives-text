# D'Onofrio gets his kicks on Cardinal team
## Well-traveled junior has the stats 
### Joseph Hei Staff writer 
Carmen D'Onofrio is an Italian, raised
in Canada, recruited in Cuba, to play in
the United States. Not the average back
ground for a collegiate soccer player.
D'Onofrio has played in more coun
tries than most people have read about
with the Canadian National Soccer Team
program since the age of 14, and will
likely represent Canada in the Atlanta
Olympics. Not the average resume,
either.
In his third year at Stanford,

D'Onofrio surprises
you not only with his
extraordinary
achievements, but
also with his great
attitude and ready
smile.
"I think statistical
ly this is my best sea
son," D'Onofrio said,
"but I don't look at
stats too much. I just
kind of go out there
and play; I'm not real
ly one to grab the
spotlight. I just do my
job and try to win."
D'Onofrio remains,
in spite of his elite
soccer pedigree, one of
the most unassuming
athletes you will ever

meet. He can tell you with a smile that he
plays soccer because he "just loves the
game." More importantly, he can make
you believe this statement and realize
that for him, soccer is a life, not just a
sport.
"Soccer's so big, most of my good
friends play, two of my brothers play.
Just playing is good enough for me; I love
it. Even during the season we're having I
still really want to play. I wouldn't know
what to do with myself if I didn't," he
said.
This season, Stanford (1-8-1) has lan
guished under the weight of five starters
lost to season-ending injuries. In spite of
this disheartening record, D'Onofrio has
notched up his level of play. So far, the
junior forward has scored four goals, the
most of any Cardinal, and is the team's
highest percentage scorer as well. He has
started in every game but one.
"Carmen has real breadth as a play
er," said head coach Colin Lindores.
"We're looking to Carmen to provide
some leadership this year. He's the kind
of player that the other players will play
for."
A soccer enthusiast since the age of
five, D'Onofrio grew up surrounded by a
family that was preoccupied with the
game to the point of obsession. At age 11,
he faced a decision of whether to contin
ue with soccer or with hockey, not an

easy choice growing up in Vancouver,
British Columbia. D'Onofrio chose soc
cer and has not stopped since in his run
to the top of the game.
He started training with the National
Team as one of the youngest players in
the program. He played in the under-20
World Cup with the National team in his
home city, where he and his teammates
met the legendary Pele. Definitely not
the average opportunity for a teenage
soccer player.
D'Onofrio's fortune only got better.
During the 1991 Pan-American games in
Cuba, Lindores saw D'Onofrio play while

the coach was assist
ing the U.S. Team.
Lindores recruited
him to play for the
Cardinal but
D'Onofrio deferred
for one year to play
for five months with
the Atlanta reserve
team in Italy.
This was all
before he set foot on a
college playing field.
Now, in addition to
collegiate play.
D'Onofrio starts on
the Canadian squad
slated to play in the
'96 Olympics.
To hear D'Onofrio
speak, one would

think these hectic
years of playing have all been easy, happy
times. When pressed about the extreme
discipline involved with this high level of
play, and with playing for so much of his
life, he reveals that beyond his affable
laugh, he is fiercely determined in his
sport.
"I was 16 years old, with the under-18
team, training in Victoria and staying at
the Naval Base there," he said. "So you
can picture this, living in the barracks,
getting up at six in the morning, being
there for the raising of the flag, the
whole thing. We practiced three times a
day. If you didn't like it, if you weren't
willing, you would just quit or not play.
They wanted players that were commit
ted."
D'Onofrio rarely directly comments
on his own frustrations in the game or
plays up his own attributes. However,
when he startingly drops his smile at the
end of telling this story, one has no
doubts about his level of commitment.
Even more appropriately, as you talk
to D'Onofrio about soccer, you realize
that his smiling attitude towards the
game is a part of his fiery competitive
spirit and is closely connected to his suc
cess.
"The most important thing is winning
games, that's always more fun. Winning

and having fun go hand in hand,"
he said.
Although D'Onofrio makes soc
cer sound like summer camp, his
past experiences with coaches have
not been completely rosy.
D'Onofrio's ability to play and enjoy
soccer even without much cheer
leading reveals the measure of his
personal dedication to the sport.
"I never needed to be cheered
on. It wasn't in my family or my
coaches to do that," he said. "If you
messed up, you would hear it; if
you played well you would maybe
get a comment like, 'good game.'
You basically play more for your
self than others."
During his time at Stanford,
D'Onofrio has directed some of
this self-motivation to making the
transition from a direct style of
soccer played in Canada to the
American college style of play — a
shift which has not been complete
ly smooth.
"The college game is different,"
D'Onofrio said. "Before, I would
only get one or two touches on the
ball because otherwise you would get
hurt. When you're 15 or 16 and play
ing with 19-year olds you learn what
you can and can't do physically.
"I have had to adapt, it's been a
learning process. I think this year
I'm finally coming to grips with the
fact that I can take a couple more
touches."
D'Onofrio is not on the field
because of future prospects or star
dom; he's simply plays because he
likes to and he needs to.
"I'll always want to play; to
compete, to be around the boys,
the camaraderie," he said. "I can
picture myself being some 40-year
old on the field with my kids on the
sidelines. I won't be able to run
anymore, but I'll still want to
play."

cer and has not stopped since in his run
to the top of the game.
He started training with the National
Team as one of the youngest players in
the program. He played in the under-20
World Cup with the National team in his
home city, where he and his teammates
met the legendary Pele. Definitely not
the average opportunity for a teenage
soccer player.
D'Onofrio's fortune only got better.
During the 1991 Pan-American games in
Cuba, Lindores saw D'Onofrio play while

the coach was assist
ing the U.S. Team.
Lindores recruited
him to play for the
Cardinal but
D'Onofrio deferred
for one year to play
for five months with
the Atlanta reserve
team in Italy.
This was all
before he set foot on a
college playing field.
Now, in addition to
collegiate play.
D'Onofrio starts on
the Canadian squad
slated to play in the
'96 Olympics.
To hear D'Onofrio
speak, one would

think these hectic
years of playing have all been easy, happy
times. When pressed about the extreme
discipline involved with this high level of
play, and with playing for so much of his
life, he reveals that beyond his affable
laugh, he is fiercely determined in his
sport.
"I was 16 years old, with the under-18
team, training in Victoria and staying at
the Naval Base there," he said. "So you
can picture this, living in the barracks,
getting up at six in the morning, being
there for the raising of the flag, the
whole thing. We practiced three times a
day. If you didn't like it, if you weren't
willing, you would just quit or not play.
They wanted players that were commit
ted."
D'Onofrio rarely directly comments
on his own frustrations in the game or
plays up his own attributes. However,
when he startingly drops his smile at the
end of telling this story, one has no
doubts about his level of commitment.
Even more appropriately, as you talk
to D'Onofrio about soccer, you realize
that his smiling attitude towards the
game is a part of his fiery competitive
spirit and is closely connected to his suc
cess.
"The most important thing is winning
games, that's always more fun. Winning

and having fun go hand in hand,"
he said.
Although D'Onofrio makes soc
cer sound like summer camp, his
past experiences with coaches have
not been completely rosy.
D'Onofrio's ability to play and enjoy
soccer even without much cheer
leading reveals the measure of his
personal dedication to the sport.
"I never needed to be cheered
on. It wasn't in my family or my
coaches to do that," he said. "If you
messed up, you would hear it; if
you played well you would maybe
get a comment like, 'good game.'
You basically play more for your
self than others."
During his time at Stanford,
D'Onofrio has directed some of
this self-motivation to making the
transition from a direct style of
soccer played in Canada to the
American college style of play — a
shift which has not been complete
ly smooth.
"The college game is different,"
D'Onofrio said. "Before, I would
only get one or two touches on the
ball because otherwise you would get
hurt. When you're 15 or 16 and play
ing with 19-year olds you learn what
you can and can't do physically.
"I have had to adapt, it's been a
learning process. I think this year
I'm finally coming to grips with the
fact that I can take a couple more
touches."
D'Onofrio is not on the field
because of future prospects or star
dom; he's simply plays because he
likes to and he needs to.
"I'll always want to play; to
compete, to be around the boys,
the camaraderie," he said. "I can
picture myself being some 40-year
old on the field with my kids on the
sidelines. I won't be able to run
anymore, but I'll still want to
play."
Carmen D'Onofrio is an Italian, raised
in Canada, recruited in Cuba, to play in
the United States. Not the average back
ground for a collegiate soccer player.
D'Onofrio has played in more coun
tries than most people have read about
with the Canadian National Soccer Team
program since the age of 14, and will
likely represent Canada in the Atlanta
Olympics. Not the average resume,
either.
In his third year at Stanford,

D'Onofrio surprises
you not only with his
extraordinary
achievements, but
also with his great
attitude and ready
smile.
"I think statistical
ly this is my best sea
son," D'Onofrio said,
"but I don't look at
stats too much. I just
kind of go out there
and play; I'm not real
ly one to grab the
spotlight. I just do my
job and try to win."
D'Onofrio remains,
in spite of his elite
soccer pedigree, one of
the most unassuming
athletes you will ever

meet. He can tell you with a smile that he
plays soccer because he "just loves the
game." More importantly, he can make
you believe this statement and realize
that for him, soccer is a life, not just a
sport.
"Soccer's so big, most of my good
friends play, two of my brothers play.
Just playing is good enough for me; I love
it. Even during the season we're having I
still really want to play. I wouldn't know
what to do with myself if I didn't," he
said.
This season, Stanford (1-8-1) has lan
guished under the weight of five starters
lost to season-ending injuries. In spite of
this disheartening record, D'Onofrio has
notched up his level of play. So far, the
junior forward has scored four goals, the
most of any Cardinal, and is the team's
highest percentage scorer as well. He has
started in every game but one.
"Carmen has real breadth as a play
er," said head coach Colin Lindores.
"We're looking to Carmen to provide
some leadership this year. He's the kind
of player that the other players will play
for."
A soccer enthusiast since the age of
five, D'Onofrio grew up surrounded by a
family that was preoccupied with the
game to the point of obsession. At age 11,
he faced a decision of whether to contin
ue with soccer or with hockey, not an
