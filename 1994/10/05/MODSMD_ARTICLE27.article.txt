As a fifth-year senior returning to the rebuilding Cardinal football team,
Steve Stenstrom brings savoir faire to the quarterback position. Despite this
weekend's loss at Notre Dame, he completed 37 out of 59 passes (both career
high numbers) for 360 yards and two touchdowns, becoming only the third
quarterback in Pac-10 history to throw for more than 9,000 yards. His 9,349
career passing yards tie him with John Elway (Stanford 1979-1982), and are
just 44 yards shy of Pac-10 leader Eric Wilhelm of Oregon State.

While Stenstrom epitomized experience at Notre Dame, freshman Sarna
Renfro brought youthful talent to athletic performances this weekend.
With a time of 17 minutes and 39 seconds, Renfro finished in third place
overall to lead the Cardinal women's cross country team to an impressive
victory in both open and invitational races at the Stanford Invite this past
weekend. Renfro, from Federal Way, Wash., is one of several frosh who
have already made a consistent impact on the third-ranked team.
