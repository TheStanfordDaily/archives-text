# Golf wins Invite
## Women's team shines in rain 
### Emery Chen Staff writer 
"Total domination" are two
words that could accurately
describe what took place at the
Nike Invitational.
Coach Tim Baldwin character
ized the Stanford women's action
as "the best golf I've ever seen."
The Cardinal golfers, ranked
sixth in the country by Golf World
Magazine, proved they were wor
thy of the rating as they took the
top two spots and four out of the
top eight places to capture the
Invitational by 20 strokes. Going
into the final round Tuesday, the
Cardinal had a 27 stroke lead.
Stanford finished the three
rounds on the Trysting Tree Golf
Course in Corvallis, Ore., with a
total score ofB9B, compiling three
of the five best team rounds
including the two lowest scores.
All of this was accomplished
despite the high winds and the
cold which accentuated the rough
condition of the golf course. "All
of them stayed focused despite
the conditions," Baldwin said.
The one golfer that stayed the
most focused throughout the
three rounds was Andrea Baxter.
The sophomore shot a final round
score of 77, five over par, to win
the individual tourney. Baxter,
named a pre-season All-American
after making the semifinals of the
US Amateurs, won by six strokes.
Going into the final eighteen
holes, Baxter had a seven stroke
lead. She was the only one to have
a round of better than 72 by
shooting a 70 and 71 on Monday.
"She scrambled well and
putted well," Baldwin said. "She's
a terrific athlete, a terrific golfer
and a terrific person."
Other standout performances
included senior Jamille Jose's sec
ond place tie with a total score of
224 after rounds of 75, 73 and 76

and Vicky Strada's tie for sixth
after shooting 75 in the final
round. A junior, Strada finished
nine strokes off the pace. Senior
Amy Lawrence tied for eighth
with 229 after shooting a 77 over
the final 18 holes.
1994 First Team All-American
and pre-season All-American
Mhairi McKay tied for 24th in the
tourney. Since the team scores
include only the four best rounds
of the day, none of McKay's
rounds counted towards the Car
dinal's totals.
"It was uncharacteristic golf
for her," said Baldwin of the
sophomore. "She's had a long
summer of golf. She was playing
for Great Britain.. .and she just
flew in last Monday."
Third-ranked UCLA finished
second in the invite while USC
ended up third 35 strokes behind.
Oregon finished fourth and
twelfth-ranked Arizona rounded
out the top five. Top-ranked Ari
zona State did not compete as a
team although they did send
three players as independents.
Going into the tournament,
Baldwin had his doubts about
how the Cardinal was going to do.
"People were asking me about
how the team looked," Baldwin
said. "I was saying that they were
really rusty."
Stanford has another chance
to rule the Pacific Northwest
when it travels to Seattle, Wash.,
for the University of Washington
Intercollegiate. More top teams
will compete on the Sahalee Golf
Course, one that Baldwin
describes as the "best course we'll
play on all year." Fourth-ranked
Tulsa will be there along with Ari
zona, UCLA, Oklahoma and
Oklahoma State.
"The competition will be real
keen," Baldwin said. "(However!
our five players can give any team
a real fight."
