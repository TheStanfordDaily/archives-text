# Biz projects pass ASSU
## Takes over Rec Center, Design Group 
### Kevin Wack Staff writer 
The ASSU
Senate voted last
night to approve
the budgets of
two new business
ventures project
ed to net more
than $35,000 in
profits over the
next year.
The budgets

for the Stanford Design Group —
a newly created division of ASSU
Type & Design — and the Tresid
der Recreation Center were ap
proved nearly unanimously.
Senate Chair Nawwar Kasrawi
also announced the official cre
ation of a task force to study the
ASSU's special-fee system.

The group currently includes
three graduate and two under
graduate senators. According to
Council of Presidents member
Mork Murdock, two more sena
tors will be appointed to the task
force before it begins delibera
tions. COP member Anietie
Ekanem, Assistant Director of
Tresidder Nanci Howe and Linda
Whitcomb, who supervises the
ASSU in Tresidder Union, will
serve as ex-officio members of the
task force.
Throughout its eight-week
study of the ailing fee system —
which funds campus student
groups — the group will tackle is
sues such as last year's high fee
refund rate and the poor perfor
mance of many fees in the spring


Kasrawi
elections, Murdock said. During
winter quarter, it will propose an
amendment to the ASSU Consti
tution which will alter the fee sys
tem.
In additon, a $69,780 budget
for the Design Group, which has
been running for more than four
weeks now, passed with only
graduate senator Donald Aing
worth dissenting. The bill
includes a provision that the sen

ate decide in six months whether
or not to continue operating the
new division.
Financial Manager Gabe Lucas
told the senate that he and Kas
rawi decided to form the group
late in the summer after the Stan
ford Publications Services'
Graphics Center closed, leaving a
void in on-campus printing facili
ties.
"There's a lot of business out
there," Lucas said. "We decided
this was an opportunity not to be
missed [with the SPS closing].
Essentially we decided to approve
an extension that would have

many advantages by being on
campus."
Among the advantages listed in
the bill were on-line billing ser
vices, free pick-up and delivery
services and proximity to campus
departments and students. Open
ing the new division basically con
sisted of adding one full-time staff
member, Lucas said.
The Rec Center proposal
passed unanimously, after an
amendment providing the same
six-month evaluation period was
added. The vote officially changed
the center's management from
the Stanford Management Com

pany to the ASSU.
Lucas stressed that approving
the transfer of the Rec Center and
its budget meant that the center
would close after six months if the
senate decided not to renew fund
ing at that point.
He said that although the
Stanford Management Company
has no further interest in operat
ing the facility, the ASSU should
be able to turn a profit on the
facility because it would have
smaller overhead costs.
And Lucas said that changes
may be made in services provided
at the Rec Center. "This is by no

means a final issue," he said.
Senate members, acting with
out the sweatshirt uniform they
are mandated to wear according
to a new constitutional amend
ment, passed six bills in all, with
none facing any serious opposi
tion.
Kasrawi said the money for the
sweatshirts had been appropriat
ed in last year's amendment, but
logistical problems prevented
them from being available on
time. He said the sweatshirts will
be ready by the next senate meet
ing on Oct. 18.
Among the other bills passed

last night was one changing the
speaking rules at Senate meet
ings, another redefining the role
of the group's Steering Commit
tee and one granting graduate
senator Sanford Dickert a leave of
absence, along with a bill approv
ing a $9,000 honorarium for guest
speaker Naomi Wolf.
Also discussed was this year's
upswing in sales of Flicks passes
and the current status of the Taco
Bell project, which is on hold
because food and ventilation
codes in Tresidder Union would
not allow the project to be built at
its original location.
