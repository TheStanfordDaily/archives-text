# Biz projects pass ASSU
## Takes over Rec Center, Design Group 
### Kevin Wack Staff writer 
The ASSU
Senate voted last
night to approve
the budgets of
two new business
ventures project
ed to net more
than $35,000 in
profits over the
next year.
The budgets

for the Stanford Design Group —
a newly created division of ASSU
Type & Design — and the Tresid
der Recreation Center were ap
proved nearly unanimously.
Senate Chair Nawwar Kasrawi
also announced the official cre
ation of a task force to study the
ASSU's special-fee system.

The group currently includes
three graduate and two under
graduate senators. According to
Council of Presidents member
Mork Murdock, two more sena
tors will be appointed to the task
force before it begins delibera
tions. COP member Anietie
Ekanem, Assistant Director of
Tresidder Nanci Howe and Linda
Whitcomb, who supervises the
ASSU in Tresidder Union, will
serve as ex-officio members of the
task force.
Throughout its eight-week
study of the ailing fee system —
which funds campus student
groups — the group will tackle is
sues such as last year's high fee
refund rate and the poor perfor
mance of many fees in the spring
