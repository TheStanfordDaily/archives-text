# Field hockey to face weekend competition

Riding the momentum of a three-game winning streak,
the Cardinal field hockey team (4-5 overall, 2-1 in the North
ern Pacific Conference) is looking to extend its victory run to
six as it takes on Davis and Elkins College, University of the
Pacific and Santa Clara this weekend.
During their current winning spree, the Cardinal has
exploded on ofTense, scoring 10 goals in the three games. By
comparison, in its first six games Stanford had only managed
to score once.
"It was rocky at the beginning of the season," said junior
tri-captain Elise Morgan. "A let of people are starting who
didn't start last year."
While the very young Cardinal, which includes 11 fresh
men and sophomores and only one senior, has at times strug
gled, the younger players are using each game as instruc
tional experience. The Cardinal players are getting used to
each athlete's particular style as well as their teammates'
strengths, according to senior tri-captain Tina Syer.
Stanford head coach Sheryl Johnson believes Stanford
has shown many signs of progress so far this season, but she
still sees room for improvement.
"We gain more confidence each game. Now, we're trying
to gain consistency," Johnson said. "Everyone's working
hard, we need to be more consistent with marking [guarding
an opponent] and rebounding. And we could always score
more."
The Cardinal hopes its winning pace will continue
through this weekend's games, especially as it faces Pacific
on Saturday. The Cardinal slipped past the Tigers 2-1 in
their first meeting of the year on Sept. 24.
"UOP is really feisty and scrappy," Morgan said. "You
have to go hard the whole game to get to the balls."
The Tigers are last in the NorPac at 0-2 and have not won
any of their six games, but they are still a conference oppo
nent and the Cardinal must be ready, Syer said.
Though Stanford dominated the last meeting on paper by
outshooting Pacific 25-18, the Cardinal win was only
clinched with a late goal by Morgan to win the game. The
Cardinal will gain an advantage on Saturday that it did not
enjoy last month — a home field.
Unlike Pacific, the Cardinal has not played Davis and
Elkins or Santa Clara. In fact, little is known about either
college's field hockey program. Davis and Elkins is a small
school from Canada, and Santa Clara just started its field
hockey program this year.
"Davis and Elkins is a question mark," Syer said. "We
have to play our game and stay up to our level."
Since the Cardinal knows little about its Friday opponent,

the team's only strategy will be to play by its own game plan,
according to Johnson. "We have to play them hard," she said.
Santa Clara is similar to UC-Davis, Stanford's opponent
last Sunday, because they are both brand new programs and
are club, not varsity, teams. Stanford crushed Davis, 5-1, but
things may be a little different when it plays Santa Clara on

Sunday. The game will be the Cardinal's third in three days,
and fatigue could be a significant factor for the small team
which does not substitute often.
"It's hard to play three games in three days," Morgan
said. "On Sunday, hopefully we can hold out and be at the top
of our game."
