# Seeds in space
## Alum's science project blasts off, will study vegetable seed growth

Last week, Stanford graduate
Teddy Johnson waved good-bye
to eight years of work as he
watched the space shuttle En
deavour blast off into orbit â€” car
rying an experiment he helped
devise.
"It was a great feeling, but it's
been going on for so long it was
more of a feeling of relief, finally
it's gone," said Johnson, who was
present at the shuttle's liftoff
Friday at the Kennedy Space
Center at Cape Canaveral.

The experiment will examine
the early stages of germinating
tomato, turnip and cucumber
seeds under microgravity, and
the results will then be compared
to a control group on Earth, he
said.
Although this is not the first
experiment of its kind, Johnson,
who graduated in 1993, is looking
forward to studying the cells for
insight into the effects of micro
gravity on such cell functions as
the direction of root and stem
growth.
