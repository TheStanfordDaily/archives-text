# Seeds in space
## Alum's science project blasts off, will study vegetable seed growth 
### Jo Marshall Staff writer 
Last week, Stanford graduate
Teddy Johnson waved good-bye
to eight years of work as he
watched the space shuttle En
deavour blast off into orbit — car
rying an experiment he helped
devise.
"It was a great feeling, but it's
been going on for so long it was
more of a feeling of relief, finally
it's gone," said Johnson, who was
present at the shuttle's liftoff
Friday at the Kennedy Space
Center at Cape Canaveral.

The experiment will examine
the early stages of germinating
tomato, turnip and cucumber
seeds under microgravity, and
the results will then be compared
to a control group on Earth, he
said.
Although this is not the first
experiment of its kind, Johnson,
who graduated in 1993, is looking
forward to studying the cells for
insight into the effects of micro
gravity on such cell functions as
the direction of root and stem
growth.
Johnson proposed the idea
eight years ago as a high school
student at Space Camp. "They
asked us to come up with ideas,
and I said 'Well I don't know,
why don't we grow seeds in
space,' " he said.
In 1989, his idea was approved
by the Get Away Special program
— a Space Camp program
designed to encourage experi
ments in space — and he was
teamed up with three other camp
students who had submitted sim
ilar proposals, he said.
The four students worked "on
and off' growing several differ
ent varieties of seeds in space

like conditions to find seeds that
would best germinate and grow
rapidly in total darkness.
Johnson said that once the
experiment was approved, they
expected it would be completed
within a few years. They never
made a concentrated effort to
complete the project, however,
because they were all at different
schools.
But by the time Johnson was a
junior, the experiment had devel
oped enough to require funding.
Johnson applied for and received
a $500 grant from the Under
graduate Research Opportunities
office.
"Things were going slow . . .
we were kind of wondering how
the experiment would happen
without any money," Johnson
said.

There's a point
where academic con
nects with the real
world — that's what's
exciting.'
— Laura Selznick

URO Director Laura Selznick
said that Johnson's proposal was
a wonderful project "with real
scientific purpose and promise"
and was overwhelmed that he
was able to get his project on a
shuttle.
"It's amazing the amount of
foresight needed to do this,"

she said. "There's a point
where academic connects with
the real world — that's what's
exciting."
Once the group had developed
the experiment and found the
best seeds, Johnson concentrated
on refining the temperature-con
trol mechanisms within the
chamber, since a similar experi
ment had previously failed when
seeds froze in the shuttle's
exposed payload bay.
Aboard the shuttle, the seeds
were placed between sheets of fil
ter paper in an airtight, light
proof growth chamber and are
supplied water via an electric
pump.
The chamber was then placed
in a Get Away Special Canister —
owned by the U.S. Space and
Rocket Center and designated for

use by students of the Space
Camp — with three other experi
ments, and will remain in the
shuttle's payload bay.
Johnson said he is excited
about studying the results and
hopes to put another experiment
into space in the future. He said
he also wouldn't mind accompa
nying it.
"I definitely want to be an
astronaut ... I really enjoy
being in the space program," he
said.
For the present, however, he's
glad that at least one Stanford
graduate, Steve Smith, is
presently accompanying his
experiment on the Endeavor.
Smith, an engineer from San
Jose, was one of the six astro
nauts aboard the Endeavour at
its liftoff last week.
