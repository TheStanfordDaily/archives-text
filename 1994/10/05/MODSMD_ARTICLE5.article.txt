# Budget still worries University trustees
## Increased giving does not ease concerns 
### Scott Van Winkle Staff writer 
Despite reports of a record year from the
University's fund-raising division, the Board
of Trustees left yesterday's meeting with lit
tle hope that Stanford's budget would cease
shrinking.
During the two-day meeting, the trustees,
who hold the pursestrings of the University,
heard a report from Vice President for Devel
opment John Ford that the University re
ceived $226.1 million in donations during the
last fiscal year.
The record total, a 24.2 percent increase
over the previous year, reflects a generous
economic climate and an increase in alumni
giving, Ford said. A number of large gifts,
such as the $25 million endowment created

by the founders of Hewlett-Packard to sup
port young researchers, also contributed to
the result, he said.
Board of Trustees Chair John Friedenrich
praised the donors' generosity, saying it
"demonstrates a lot of confidence" in the Uni
versity's leadership, but stressed that the in
crease would not have much impact on the
budget process.
Many of the donations come with strings
attached, he explained, so that the University
can only spend those funds for a specific pur
pose — such as a new building or endowed
professorship.
Such "restricted funds" become separate
segments of the University's $1.2 billion bud
get, over which University decision-makers
have no control.
The University last year cut $6
million from its budget, a small
amount relative to the overall
budget, but significant in terms of
operating costs. Over the next two
years, the University plans to
reduce the budget by an addition
al $12 million.
Ford said the section of dona
tions most directly related to the
operating budget — the Annual
Fund — also experienced signifi
cant growth over last year. The
fund swelled to $21.4 million last
year, providing for athletic schol
arships and other annual expens
es.
Increasing the level of commit
ment among alumni has been a
longtime goal of the Development
Office, because an increased base
gives the University more flexibil

ity, Ford said.
The University has ranked
among the nation's top fund-rais
ers over the past few years. Three
years ago, it ranked second in total
giving, and two years ago it ranked
fourth behind Harvard Universi
ty, the University of Pennsylvania
and Cornell University.
The University's alumni dona
tion rate, on the other hand, has
lagged far behind those of other
top schools, which range in the 50
percent category. Ford said that
last year 30.3 percent of alumni
donated money to the University,
a 5 percent increase over the pre
vious year.
The University has made a
great effort to increase the alumni
donation rate because large num
bers of small gifts are usually less
restricted, Ford said.
"A large complex university like
Stanford can't be dependent on
just a handful of people," he said.
"Over time you have to be willing
to turn to new generations."
