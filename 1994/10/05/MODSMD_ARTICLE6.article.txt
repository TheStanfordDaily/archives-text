# Asian-American Studies group discusses options
## 
### Frank Guinan Staff writer 
In the first of two meetings with the
Stanford community, the Asian-American
Studies Committee discussed possible
course requirements for an Asian-American
Studies program.
The approximately 40 people who attend
ed the meeting suggested courses in law,
public policy, media, sociology and psychol
ogy — all with an Asian-American focus —
for a core curriculum.
The meeting began with Political Science
Prof. Daniel Okimoto, chair of the commit
tee, stating the two central questions which
the committee must address.
"One, should we have [an Asian-Ameri
can Studies] program?" he said. "Two, what
form should it take?"
Along with the core requirements, com
mittee members debated about the extent of
the program's slant toward comparative
study.
Modern Thought and Literature gradu-
ate student Davina Chen said she
believes any course in Asian-
American studies is inherently
comparative because it would
focus on how Asian Americans
live among other groups.
And Anthropology Prof. Sylvia
Yanagisako, a committee mem
ber, pointed out that more faculty
could be attracted with a broader
comparative curriculum.
Opponents, however, claimed
that such a broad program would
lose its focus on the Asian-Ameri
can culture.
Those at the meeting also dis
cussed the feasibility and useful
ness of an Asian-American
resource center — an idea which
garnered the support of several
alumni.
Sandra Yuen, president of the
Stanford Asian/Pacific-American
Alumni Club, said while she was a
student, it was "hard to find men
tors and colleagues in [her] field."
She added that it was hard to col
lect data for her research, which

focused on the ethnic self-esteem
of Chinese children.
Multicultural Educator
Tommy Woon urged those at the
meeting to discuss the philosophi
cal reasons behind instituting an
Asian-American Studies program.
"The country is waiting for one
of its top universities to provide a
solid Asian-American Studies pro
gram," he said. Woon also said
that he believes graduating
seniors do not have cultural
understanding when they leave
the University.
"We need to have higher goals
and a better vision," he said.
"There's a whole country waiting
for our leadership."
The committee's next step is to
meet with alumni as well as
Asian-American Studies scholars
from other colleges, including pos
sibly UCLA and UC-Berkeley.
Members currently are meeting
every week, and the first draft of
their report is due out on the
week of Oct. 31.
The committee will then meet
with the Stanford community
again in early November, and
after the report is revised, the
committee plans to turn it in to

John Shoven, dean of the School
of Humanities and Sciences on
the week of Nov. 21.
"In a rapid time frame, we plan
to go from deciding on a philoso
phy to presenting solid propos
als," said junior Jerry Chen, a
committee member.
The committee was formed last
spring in response to student out
cries calling for the institution of
an Asian-American Studies pro
gram. The formation followed an
interruption of the May 12 Facul
ty Senate meeting by members of
the "Concerned Students for
Asian-American Studies" collec
tive.
Committee members were
selected in June and includes
eight professors and three stu
dents.
Over the summer, Law School
student and committee member
Leslie Hatamiya compiled some
background research of other eth
nic programs at Stanford — such
as the Jewish and Feminist Stud
ies — and at other universities to
get background information and
to see how such an ethnic pro
gram could work for the Stanford
community.
