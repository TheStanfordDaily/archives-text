# Asian-American psych class canceled this year
## 
### Cynthia Yu Staff writer 
Despite high levels of student interest,
the Psychology Department will not hold
its Asian-American psychology course
this quarter pending a review of the de
partment's curriculum.
According to Dr. Karen Huang — a
Cowell staff psychologist for counseling
and psychological services who was to
teach "Peer Counseling: Asian-American
Community" this quarter — the depart
ment decided not to support the course
until it had finished conducting the re
view.
Psychology Department Chair Ellen
Markman would not comment on
the cancellation, except to state
that she "is continuing to explore
the issue."
Though now under a different
title, the course would have been
a repeat of the "Introduction to
Asian-American Psychology"
class offered last fall which origi
nated as a peer counseling course
geared toward the Asian-Ameri
can community.
"The class was a great way for
students to learn how a tradi
tional academic field like psy
chology relates to Asian-Ameri
cans," said junior Jerry Chen,
who took the course last year.
"Dr. Huang really did a great job
of introducing the subject."
The course has its foundations
as one of a series of ethnic-orient
ed peer counseling classes spon
sored by Cowell. The original
course focused on peer counseling
techniques sensitive to Asian-
American issues. Huang, along
with Lance Chov, an assistant

director of the Career Planning
and Placement Center, served as
the lecturers for the course when
it began back in 1988.

It s definitely not a
case of low interest
or enrollment.'

est, however, the course eventu
ally "evolved from a peer-coun
seling class to an academic,
research-oriented course,"
Huang said. Last fall quarter,
Huang received permission from
the Psychology Department in a
one-time agreement to teach the
course as "Introduction to Asian-
American Psychology."
The department did not renew
the agreement for this year —
the primary reason why it was
canceled for this quarter.
The department's curriculum
review could shift the Asian-
American course back to a peer
counseling focus. However,
Huang feels that the course

would be "mislabeled" under peer
counseling, especially in light of
the course's current content.
Lack of student interest did
not contribute to the course's
cancellation; Huang said that she
had to turn away students for
the class last year.
"It's definitely not a case of
low interest or enrollment," she
said. "Students are very interest
ed because it's really relevant to
Asian-Americans and there's no
other class like it.
"There is tremendous interest
on the part of students ... in the
Asian-American psychological
issue. I think students were real
ly disappointed not to be able to
take it," said Asian-American
Community Center Director Rick
Yuen. "I would like to see recon
sideration by the Psych Depart
ment to offer this course." Yuen
is currently working to seek
funding for the course.
Chen said that he felt the situa
tion made it less likely for such
courses to be offered in the future.
"Because of the lack of resources
and support, it just isn't worth it
for professors like Dr. Huang to
teach these courses," he said.
