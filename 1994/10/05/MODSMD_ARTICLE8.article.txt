# 'It's a large commitment...but working with this team is exciting'
## Visiting law prof joins Simpson defense team 
### Jo Marshall Staff writer 
On June 30, Gerald Uelmen expected
that he would be relaxing in a quiet corner
of the Stanford Law Library. Instead, he
took center stage at the Los Aiigeles Superi
or Court — defending O. J. Simpson in
what many have called the most famous
murder case in American history.
"I had visions of having my feet up in the
library this fall and getting into this case
was a bit of surprise," he said, remembering
day one of Simpson's pre-trial.
After eight years as Dean of the Santa
Clara University Law School, Uelmen
planned to begin a sabbatical at Stanford on
June 30 to do some research he had "put on
the back burner," he said.
Two weeks before he was expected to

Attorney Robert Shapiro asked visiting Law Prof. Gerald
Uelmen to join the Simpson defense team this summer.
begin at Stanford, however, he
was asked to join Simpson's
defense team — lead by Robert
Shapiro, who he had previously
worked with on the Christian
Brando case.
Uelmen decided to take the trial
and postpone his sabbatical
because he said he believed it was a
"once in a lifetime opportunity"
due to the nature of the evidence,
the decree of the public attention
and the lawyers he would be work
ing with.
"Also I would be putting a lot of

study and reflection into practical
use and that reinvigorates you," he
said.
Even though it has been hard
work, and he has had little spare
time recently, Uelmen said he has
enjoyed being part of the defense
team.
"It's taking a large commitment
of energy but working with this
team is exciting," he said.
Although Uelmen may have
spent most of his legal career
teaching at and running a law
school, he occasionally represents
defendants in criminal cases at
federal and state courts. In addi
tion, he takes two or three cases a
year on a consulting basis, he
said.

"It's nice to have a steady diet —
to move from courtroom to library
to classroom," he said. "It's the
best of both worlds."
Uelmen's changing interests
have thrust him into one of the
most unique cases in history. He
said he has never witnessed such
extensive coverage of a case.
"I've never seen anything com
parable to this before," he said.
"It's going to make jury selection
more difficult but it's still do-able."
Although the long process of
jury selection — which he predicts
will be completed by Oct. 17 — has
delayed the start of the trial, Uel
men said he still believes the media
should continue to film the trial
once it begins.

"Using cameras in the court
room is healthy and eliminates
speculation of what's going on," he
explained. "What does worry me
though is that people think this is a
typical case."
Even though Uelmen didn't
make it to Stanford this fall he still
hopes to "break loose" from the
trial in time to teach a course on
Criminal Procedure at Stanford in
January, he said.
"I'm really looking forward to
working with the faculty at Stan
ford Law School," he said. "Stan
ford has the best law faculty in the
country."
Uelmen's expertise in criminal
procedure was used by the defense
during the pre-trial in an attempt

to suppress evidence they claimed
was seized unconstitutionally from
Simpson's estate shortly after the
murders.
Law Prof. Kim Taylor-Thomp
son is already using the case as a
teaching tool for demonstrating
theoretical issues of criminal pro
cedure. She said she hopes Uel
men will be able to use examples
from the Simpson case in his own
class.
"He will be a tremendous addi
tion to the faculty and give the stu
dents the opportunity to under
stand what criminal procedure is
all about," Taylor-Thompson said.
"It will bridge the gap between the
ory and practice."
Taylor-Thompson also said

that, while Criminal Procedure is
normally a popular course, she
expects people will "flock to it if
Uelmen teaches it.
If Uelmen does come to Stan
ford in January, he said he plans
to use lots of examples from the
case "to the extent" that he can.
Robert Weisberg, professor of
law, has previously taught the
class in criminal procedure and he
said Uelmen's "fine academic
scholarship" of criminal law and
pragmatic involvement with crim
inal justice will be very useful for
the students.
"We are delighted to have him
because he is a fine scholar and we
are in need of a visitor," he said. "I
do hope he'll be able to make it."
