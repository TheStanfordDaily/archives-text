# Too much Juice? Professors ponder media role in O.J. case

Has sensationalistic media coverage
deprived O.J. Simpson of his right to a
fair trial?
Stanford professors say they are con
cerned about the media's role in the
Simpson case, a question that experts
around the country have considered in
the past few weeks.

the bloody

Simpson's

house, the American public has been in
undated by Simpson case reports in
broadcast and print media — some fac
tual and some false.
"I'm so saturated by the irresponsi
bility of the media that I'm beyond being
outraged," said Superior Court
Judge Lance Ito, who is presiding
over the case, in a public
announcement last week.
Stanford faculty members
agree that the media has clouded
the case. "The problem in effect is
a clash between two rights," said
Law Prof. Miguel Mendez.
"O.J. has the right to a fair
trial in front of an impartial jury
which has not been influenced by
the media," he said, "and the
media have a First Amendment
right to follow the case and report
what they want."
Ito has threatened to terminate

all electronic media coverage of
the Simpson case, and will hold a
hearing Nov. 7 to determine if he
will continue to allow television
coverage, audio broadcasts and
photography in the courtroom.
In a written statement, he said
that his actions were a result of
irresponsible reporting by the Los
Angeles television station KNBC
TV. According to the statement,
the station falsely reported that a
bloody sock had been found at
Simpson's residence, and has also
broadcast the faces of jurors from
another trial.
Some observers have suggest
ed that Ito is, in effect, putting
the media on probation to encour
age more responsible reporting.
In this type of case, "the risk is
that the defendant will not get a

fair trial" because the jurors will
have been "contaminated" by inac
curate media reports, Mendez said.
"I think it would be unfortu
nate" to censor the media, he
added, but said he thinks it is "far
more important that O.J. get a
fair trial than that the media keep
doing what they've been doing."
Communications Prof. James
Risser said he too believes that
the media acted irresponsibly by
printing or televising unsubstan
tiated evidence, but added he feels
that "despite the publicity it is
possible for the legal system to
guarantee [Simpson] a fair trial."
Risser said he thinks it is
impossible to find jurors who
have not heard of the case — and
that if they hadn't he would have
serious questions about their

qualifications — but that "it is
possible to put together a jury
who can put aside [what they
have heard] and listen to the evi
dence presented in the court
room."
In contrast, Law Prof Robert
Weisberg said that he doesn't
think it is "too hard for jurors to
listen to a case objectively."
"If there's a problem with bias
one way or another, it is more
likely to have to do with inherent
predispositions of the jurors"
such as those regarding race, the
police, sports celebrities, or
domestic violence, Weisberg
added.
Nevertheless, "keeping the
cameras out of the courtroom
would probably be a good idea,"
Weisberg said.
