HOT ON THE TRAIL
OF THE COST Cll H
COLOR PRINTER.
I just cleared up I lie Case O!
The Vanishing Ink, and was
cleaning oil my desk when it hit me
like a ream ot paper: even my most
brilliant work looked dull.
The reason? Everything was in
black and white. So 1 said to myself,
"Mr. Print Detective, you need a color
printer. 1 made a phone
call and received a tip
from one of my sources
at 1-800-848-4123, The
Canon BJC-600 is a
sure thing lor color.
It sounded good, but
had to investigate. After all, I
am Nick Canon, Print Detective.
Now, there are a lot gray areas in
color printers. Like cost-per-page,
color quality and speed. So I made a
bee-line to the lab to have a little
chat with my pal, Specs. I knew he
knew what 1 needed to know.
u The facts prove the
BJC-600 costs
about half as much
to operate as
most other color
ink jet printers.
•NICK
His desk looked like a bomb had gone
off. There were printer parts everywhere.
"Specs, you ever seen a Canon BJC-600'
He peered up through his
specs,"You're looking at
