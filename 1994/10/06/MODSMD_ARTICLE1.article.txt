# After a year, Rice settles in job
## Provost looks back at year of budget cuts and student protests 
### Beth Berselli Senior staff writer 
During her first year on the job,
Provost Condoleezza Rice cut $6 mil
lion from the University's budget, ne
gotiated with Chicano students
hunger-striking in the Main Quad last
spring and traveled constantly to raise
funds for Stanford — all the while
managing to keep up her piano prac
tice.
"I think all in all it's been a pretty
eventful year," Rice said in an inter
view yesterday."I think we achieved a
couple of very important things" in
terms of both the budget and acade
mics.
Now, as she begins her second year

as Stanford's chief budget and acade
mic officer, a more experienced Rice
has new goals but is facing many of the
same concerns she dealt with last year.
While the provost must still find a way
to cut another $12 million from Stan
ford's budget over the next two years,
she said she has also learned that she
needs time away from the office.
"I find myself captive in this office
more than I would like to be, and peo
ple end up coming to me instead of me
to them," Rice said, adding that, more
than anything, she missed spending
time with students last year.
Rice, known as a woman of action,
has already taken steps to assure her
self more student contact by agreeing
to teach a spring quarter seminar for

seniors on European politics.
"I really miss being in the class
room," she said. "I really hated the
fact that every time I engaged stu
dents it was about the budget and not
about intellectual or academic issues,
or for that matter what's going on in
the world."
Rice's hours cooped up in her office,
however, also yielded significant
lessons. She said she was proud to be
able to present a balanced budget to
the University's Board of Trustees
last June.
"It was difficult because we had to
make $6 million in cuts, and after hav
ing made almost $40-plus million in

At an interview in her office yesterday, Provost Condoleezza Rice spoke about how she
dealt with difficult events she faced last year.
cuts over the last three or four
years, it was not the easiest thing
in the world to find places to con
tinue to cut," she said. "Obvious
ly, I think we had to make some
cuts that impacted students and
were difficult for people."
Several of Rice's budgetary
decisions were met with anger by
students from Stanford's various
ethnic communities.
The Chicano community was
particularly upset when Cecilia
Burciaga — the highest-ranking
Chicana administrator and a resi
dent fellow at Casa Zapata — was
laid off last spring due to budget
cuts. To protest Burciaga's layoff,
Chicano students staged a hunger
strike in the Quad last May.
Although she didn't expect last
spring's specific events, Rice said
she anticipated that "it would not
be easy for people to get accus
tomed to a budget process that
was maybe not as wide-ranging as
the ones with lots and lots of com
mittees, as we've had in the past."
Rice's colleagues, however,
were quick to praise her work on
the budget, citing her effective
handling of both student and fac
ulty concerns.
Thanks to Rice's direction, the
budget-cutting process was "real
ly done with a remarkable spirit
of cooperation by all," said Geof
frey Cox, vice provost for Institu
tional Planning.

By making it clear early on
what her budgetary goals were,
Rice "really made all of our jobs
easier," Cox said. "She's really
done a remarkable job."
Rice assumed the position at
the worst possible time in terms
of budget constraints, but she dug
in and made the necessary tough
decisions, said Biology Prof.
Robert Simoni, chair of the Facul
ty Senate.
Despite the tough times, how
ever, Rice said her first year as
provost had many highlights, one
of which was her "wonderful
working relationship" with Uni
versity President Gerhard Casper.
"Our working relationship
couldn't be better," she said. "I
don't think there has been an issue
in which one of us won the argu
ment and the other one lost it."
Instead, the two talk about the
issues and usually reach an agree
ment, she said. A similar sense of
humor and shared values about
academia have helped keep their
relationship "very easy and
open," Rice said.
"One thing I've learned is that
— to make it through — you real
ly need to have the same sense of
humor, and find the same things
upsurd," she added.
Despite working 11- and 12-
hour days last year, Rice said she
has managed to take time out for
herself.
"I learned a long time ago that
you're not very effective if you
don't take time to see friends . . .
or in my case play the piano or
play tennis," she said, adding that

she exercises every morning at 6
a.m. to maintain physical fitness.
Rice studied to be a concert
pianist until her sophomore year
at the University of Denver.
As for where she sees Stanford
in a year's time, Rice said she
expects the University to be in the
process of implementing the Com
mission on Undergraduate Edu
cation's proposals. The commis
sion — created by Casper in April
1993 to conduct a comprehensive,
year-long study of virtually every
area of undergraduate academics
— will present its findings at the
Oct. 13 Faculty Senate meeting.
In addition, Rice said she antic
ipates the new Commission on
Technology in Teaching and
Learning will have taken real
steps toward developing Universi
ty technology policy.
The standing commission,
formed last April by Casper, is
beginning to examine educational
technology, such as interactive
media and global electronic net
works.
The commission's work will be
essential to Stanford's future as a
technological leader, Rice said.
"It would be absolutely nuts —
sitting here in the heart of Silicon
Valley — for Stanford not to be on
the leading edge. And that proba
bly means we'll have to put
resources into it," Rice said.
In the midst of academic and
administrative matters, however,
Rice added one final wish for the
upcoming year.
"Hopefully, we'll have beaten
Cal," she said with a grin.
