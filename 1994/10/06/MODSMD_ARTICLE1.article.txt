# After a year, Rice settles in job
## Provost looks back at year of budget cuts and student protests 
### Beth Berselli Senior staff writer 
During her first year on the job,
Provost Condoleezza Rice cut $6 mil
lion from the University's budget, ne
gotiated with Chicano students
hunger-striking in the Main Quad last
spring and traveled constantly to raise
funds for Stanford — all the while
managing to keep up her piano prac
tice.
"I think all in all it's been a pretty
eventful year," Rice said in an inter
view yesterday."I think we achieved a
couple of very important things" in
terms of both the budget and acade
mics.
Now, as she begins her second year

as Stanford's chief budget and acade
mic officer, a more experienced Rice
has new goals but is facing many of the
same concerns she dealt with last year.
While the provost must still find a way
to cut another $12 million from Stan
ford's budget over the next two years,
she said she has also learned that she
needs time away from the office.
"I find myself captive in this office
more than I would like to be, and peo
ple end up coming to me instead of me
to them," Rice said, adding that, more
than anything, she missed spending
time with students last year.
Rice, known as a woman of action,
has already taken steps to assure her
self more student contact by agreeing
to teach a spring quarter seminar for

seniors on European politics.
"I really miss being in the class
room," she said. "I really hated the
fact that every time I engaged stu
dents it was about the budget and not
about intellectual or academic issues,
or for that matter what's going on in
the world."
Rice's hours cooped up in her office,
however, also yielded significant
lessons. She said she was proud to be
able to present a balanced budget to
the University's Board of Trustees
last June.
"It was difficult because we had to
make $6 million in cuts, and after hav
ing made almost $40-plus million in
