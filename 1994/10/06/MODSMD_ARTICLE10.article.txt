Prof. Juan Carlos Simo passed
away in Madrid last week of can
cer, leaving behind mourners
who remember both his bril
liance in his academic field and
his determination to lead an
active life outside teaching and
researching.
Simo, chair of Stanford's
Mechanical Engineering
Department's Applied Mechan
ics Division since September
1993, helped bring "internation
al stature" to the department,
said Prof. Ronald Hanson,
department chair.
Mechanical Engineering
Prof. David Barnett said Simo
was "one of the most brilliant
people I've ever met."
Simo, 42, was especially
known for his work in computa
tional methods in mechanics.
He produced about 80 publica
tions — a "phenomenal" num
ber for someone so young, Bar
nett said.
While producing top-quality

research, Simo also invested
time and effort into working
with his graduate students. He
was regarded as an approachable
professor who was willing to
pour a "contagious enthusiasm"
into teaching, Barnett said.
For this reason, Simo was
"more than liked — he was
loved by his students," Barnett
said.
Simo, who had been on sab
batical since early this year,
became a full professor in fall
1993, concurrent to his promo
tion to division chairman.
Barnett — Simo's division
chairman for five years — said
writing Simo's promotion
papers posed no difficulty since
"his record was outstanding."
Widely schooled, Simo
received several master's
degrees as well as a doctorate
from three universities in two
countries. He first came to Stan
ford in 1985 as an assistant pro
fessor of mechanical engineer
ing and later received tenure as
an associate professor in 1990.
Simo enjoyed various outdoor
sports and drove around on a

red motorcycle. The overall
effect, Hanson said, made Si mo
appear "almost more like a grad
uate student than a professor."
The cancer which caused
Simo's death on Sept. 26 belied
his active embrace of life. "I
can't picture him being
unhealthy," Hanson £aid.
"He never stopped going, and
when he wasn't working, he had
fun," Barnett said.
Barnett recalled Simo — a
native of Spain — telling him
about running with the bulls in
Pamplona. "I told him he was
crazy, but that was Juan. He'd
have to try anything at least one
time," Barnett said.
"Actually, he wasn't crazy,"
Barnett added. "He really felt
like he had to experience every
thing he could."
People of all ages were drawn
to Simo, who had many friends
both within and outside of his
career scope. "I've never heard
anyone make a negative com
ment about him," Barnett said.
"I don't know if he slept — I
don't think he had that much
time," he added.
