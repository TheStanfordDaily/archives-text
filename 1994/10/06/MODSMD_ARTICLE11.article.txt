Officials work to postpone agreement

WASHINGTON (AP) -
Struggling to save a huge global
trade agreement, Democratic
and Republican leaders were
shaping a deal yesterday to post
pone a House vote on the mea
sure until after the election.
Under the agreement taking
shape, a key procedural vote
would occur before Congress
goes home this week, said House
Democratic Whip David Bonior
of Michigan. It would set the
rules for debating a bill imple
menting the accord negotiated
under the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, he said.
The procedural vote also
would set a date certain for the

House to return and pass final
judgment on GAIT, around the
same time as the Senate, which is
scheduled to vote Dec. 1, Bonior
said. He cautioned, however, that
House leaders were still putting
the finishing touches on the
agreement yesterday evening.
The GATT bill has become
caught up an election-year strug
gle that has dominated the final
weeks of the congressional session.
Republicans anxious to deny
President Clinton a victory
before the Nov. 8 midterm elec
tions and Democrats wary of
angering union supporters have
been pushing to postpone consid
eration.

Embargo lightened in Yugoslavia

BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP)
— A Russian jet landed in Bel
grade yesterday, taking advan
tage of a small but promising first
crack in the economic embargo
the United Nations imposed on
Yugoslavia 28 months ago.
The United Nations relaxed
the sanctions just wide enough
yesterday to allow international
flights and cultural and sports
events. It was responding to
reports from U.N. monitors that
Serb-led Yugoslavia has honored
a recent pledge to stop sending
war supplies to the Bosnian Serb

forces it had armed for 2 1/2
years.
Meanwhile, the Bosnian Serbs
continued their push to expel all
non-Serbs from the 70 percent of
Bosnia they control, forcing out
dozens of Muslims yesterday.
The dazed refugees, mostly
women, children and elderly,
were expelled from Serb-held
areas around Rogatica, about 30
miles east of the capital, Sarajevo.
The Muslim-led Bosnian govern
ment, which was prepared for an
agreed exchange of war prison
ers, immediately halted the swap.

18 found dead in Canada, Switzerland

CHEIRY, Switzerland (AP) —
Twenty-one bodies made a neat
circle on the floor of a red, mirror
lined chapel hidden beneath a
burning farmhouse.
Some were dressed in red,
black and white ceremonial robes.
Ten had plastic garbage bags tied
around their necks with cords,
and some had their hands bound.
Twenty had bullets in their heads.
In three ski chalets 90 miles
away, police discovered more bod
ies, badly burned by fires appar

ently set by remote control.
In all, authorities found 48
bodies yesterday, and indications
of a mass murder-suicide by a cult
they hadn't known existed.
Clues led to Canada, where two
bodies were found a day earlier in
the charred wreckage of an unex
plained arson fire. Police said the
owner of the burned duplex, Luc
Jouret, led apocalyptic cults in
both Canada and Switzerland and
had rented one of the ski chalets
where the bodies were found.
