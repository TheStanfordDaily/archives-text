WASHINGTON (AP) â€” Capping two days of
pomp and ceremony with Nelson Mandela, Pres
ident Clinton announced a $100 million fund to
help entrepreneurs in southern Africa and a
high-level commission to boost energy, education
and development projects.
"The new South Africa with Nelson Man
dela's wise leadership has won the fight for free
dom. Now it stands at the crossroads of hope,"
Clinton said yesterday with the South African
president at his side.
"The old and deep wounds of apartheid are
not small ones," Clinton said, "but you can be
certain that the United States will continue to do
everything in our power to support the new
nation."
The new $100 million fund will be heavily tar
geted toward South Africa in hopes that it can

become an economic engine and model for the
region.
Clinton earlier had pledged $600 million in
assistance over a three-year period, and $220 mil
lion of that already has been committed. He said
the help will include U.S. loans to guarantee con
struction of nearly $500 million in new housing,
and contributions of $50 million to help provide
electricity and $30 million for basic health care.
In addition, Peace Corps volunteers next year
will travel for the first time to South Africa to
work on sanitation, agriculture, education and
rural health care.
"You have shown us the way and we look for
ward, Sir, to walking down the road with you,"
Clinton told Mandela.
Mandela thanked Clinton for U.S. support,
and credited the American president with

"ensuring that Africa does not become a forgotr
ten continent."
Mandela said he is still considering Clinton's
request to provide police or military support for
the U.S.-led military action in Haiti. He said the
decision would be made in consultation with
other countries of southern Africa, and that "we
are keen to answer collectively as a region."
He also said he would meet with exiled Haitian
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide while in Wash
ington. Clinton said he was grateful for that
because "the Haitian people will see that you can
bring a countiy where there have been deep, even
bloody divisions, together."
Clinton said the $100 million Southern Africa
Enterprise Development Fund will be directed to
all of southern Africa and chaired by former
Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young.
