VLADIVOSTOK, Russia (AP)
— Bad weather hindered relief
efforts yesterday on the Kuril
Islands following a massive earth
quake that devastated the remote
Pacific chain and sent residents
fleeing to higher ground.
The undersea quake late Tues
day had a magnitude of 8.2, the
strongest in the world this year. It
killed at least 10 people, destroyed
buildings, tossed boats ashore and
produced 9-foot-high waves that
swamped coastal areas.
Many islanders fled to higher
ground, fearing the dozens of
aftershocks which rattled the
region yesterday would set off
deadly tidal waves. Seismologists
said the aftershocks, measuring
up to magnitude 6, would contin
ue for days.
"They are in the hills with no
food, no water or personal belong
ings," said Yevgeny Kulkov, a
reporter on Sakhalin Island who
spoke on Vladivostok radio. "Heli
copters have been unable to reach
those in the hills because of bad
weather."
Rescue crews from Moscow,
Siberia and the Far East flew to

the islands north of Japan on yes
terday to begin evacuating the
injured and restoring emergency
services knocked out by the earth
quake.
No new damage or injuries
were reported yesterday, on the
Kurils or on the Japanese island
of Hokkaido. But high winds ham
pered relief efforts, according to
Yevgeny Krasnoyarov, the gover
nor of Sakhalin Island, west of the
chain.
The quake was centered about
100 miles east of Japan's northern
coast, near the Kurils. Most of the
damage was borne by the south
ern Kurils, where about 50,000
Russians live, including several
thousand soldiers.
In Moscow, Sergei Shoigu, the
minister for emergency situa
tions, said Russia and Japan
would join forces to provide
humanitarian and financial assis
tance to cope with damage esti
mated at $35 million.
Conflicting reports circulated
yesterday about the casualty toll,
and damage to power and tele
phone lines complicated efforts to
assess the disaster.
