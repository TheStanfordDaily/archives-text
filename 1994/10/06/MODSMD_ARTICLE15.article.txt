## The 						kids wanna rock 
### 
ON SATURDAY, OCTOBER 15th,
students will be able to rock
the night away to the tunes of
De La Soul in Dinkelspiel Auditori
um, thanks to the coordinating
efforts of the Stanford Concert Net
work. While the hip-hop group's per
formance is a sign that the Farm still
attracts popular groups, the top acts
seem to bypass Palo Alto, many en
route to Berkeley's Greek Theatre.
Not that Stanford lacks a venue in
which to hold such headliners as
Sting, the Indigo Girls and 10,000
Maniacs. Frost Amphitheater,
arguably one of the most beautiful
outdoor concert sights in the coun
try, has gone virtually unused in
recent years. Frost's inability to
draw these major acts is due to its
lack of facilities â€” it does not have a
loading dock large enough to accom
modate the massive equipment used
by top performers, nor permanent
bathroom installments.
The University should invest the

money necessary to polish this
underutilized jewel. While preserv
ing Frost's unique aesthetics, these
improvements would make the
amphitheater a much less expensive
place to put on a show. A potentially
revenue generating concert arena,
Frost would have a much better
chance at attracting promoters and,
in turn, the truly big names. Ticket
sales would soon pay for the renova
tion costs as many acts would entice
concert-goers from all over the Bay
Area.
Too few University dollars are
channeled towards student interests
and activities. Making this campus a
fun place to spend four years has
taken low priority compared to con
struction and research expendi
tures. These relatively simple
improvements to Frost would go a
long way to increase Stanford's
allure and at the same time boost
student morale.
We want the Dead back.
