# Support the Bridge
## 
### 
The bridge is looking
for a new home. Faced with
an inspector's report con
cluding its present building to be
unsafe, counselors have been
forced to explore other housing
options — only to find they actual
ly don't have much of a choice.
Unable to independently fund the
half million dollar renovation to
their present facility, and having
fruitlessly searched for other office
space, counselors are now contem
plating their third option — the
creation of a peer-counseling
theme dorm.
While the colaboration with Res
idential Education would solve the
live-in counselors' unsafe housing
problems, the creation of another
theme dorm would not be a wise
long-term solution.
Even theme dorms with the
most enthusiastic of focus staffs
suffer from a lack of student inter

est. Houses such as Murray, the
American studies house, and Shiff,
the performing arts house, consis
tently rank low on students' draw
cards. A peer counseling dorm
might attract students directly
involved with the Bridge but would
also inevitably house many others
placed there by default. As often
happens with theme dorms, the
apathy and disinterest of those
attracted primarily by the accomo
dations weaken the dorm's pro
gramming and spirit.
Instead of trying to move the
Bridge into a dorm, the University
should invest the money necessary
to renovate the building or assist
the counselors in finding a suitable
office and live-in space. Fixing the
facility — costly as it might be —
would provide a permanent, stable
home for an organization which is
supposed to solve others' problems,
not hassle over its own.
