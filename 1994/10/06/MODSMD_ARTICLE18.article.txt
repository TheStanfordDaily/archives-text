## Tim Stanton Public service connects classroom with reality 
### 
IN HIS ADDRESS to
new students on Sept.
22, President Casper
named public service as
one answer to the ques
tion "Why should you be
at Stanford?" He said,
"Members of a university
community, whatever
their views, must not shy
away from the social and

political issues of their time, from shaping
the social and political values of society,
from engaging in public service. Stan
ford's culture is very supportive of these
endeavors. Pursuing them at a university
provides the chance to make them as effec
tive as possible by applying the same criti
cal reasoning to public service that is oth
erwise prized in the university."
With these words, President Casper
calls for more than voluntary action on
the part of Stanford students. Reminding
us that we engage in service as members
of an academic community, he recom
mends that "critical reasoning" be joined
with service to help ensure thoughtful
action and positive impact. Indeed, while
churches, YMCA's, or local governments
can effectively recruit and supervise vol
unteers, academic communities have a
further obligation to ensure that the ser
vice they support is guided by relevant
theory and knowledge.
To this end the Haas Center for Public
Service has worked with faculty to
increase students' ability to make "study
service" connections. These efforts have
resulted in some 40 "service-learning"
courses in which students integrate reflec

tion on public service experience with aca
demic study. Service-learning lecture
courses and small, intensive seminars
exist across the curriculum. With support
from the School of Humanities and Sci
ences, a Public Service Scholars program
was initiated this fall to bring together a
cross-disciplinary group of students who
are undertaking public service-related
honors research. As a result, Stanford stu
dents — guided by faculty — are con
tributing sustained, high quality assis
tance on action and policy research in our
neighboring communities, across the
country and overseas.
However, education-based public service
has another benefit not mentioned by Pres
ident Casper. It enables students to hear
and understand voices, experiences and
knowledge of people and communities off
campus, thereby connecting classroom
learning with social and political realities.
With faculty support, students learn to rea
son about service experience in the context
of relevant knowledge. Just as they use
knowledge to improve their service, their
service provides a base from which to test
and expand knowledge, to raise questions
about how knowledge is used and to gener
ate new questions for research.
In a statement about her struggle to
connect "the classical ways of learning"
with a deeply felt "responsibility to my
community at home," Public Service
Scholar Luz Herrera wrote, "Behind every
statistic, there are faces, there are difficult
experiences, there are real live people,
with real emotions and beliefs.... Objec
tivity, analysis, and experimentation do
not mean much to me if they do not trans-

late into something I can put into practice.
... I have learned to question the most
basic of assumptions in my academic and
personal life." Another Scholar, Brita
Lombardi, wrote, "Service-learning has
provided me an opportunity to connect
theory with practice, ideology with actual
ity. It provides a lens by which to explore
the relationship between abstract and
concrete — to match faces and organiza
tions with impersonal statistics."
Luz and Brita are just two of the
numerous students who exemplify Presi
dent Casper's challenge to the class of
1998. They feel the urgency of a challenge
to the academy made many years ago by
Oscar Handlin, that "our troubled planet
can no longer afford the luxury of pursuits
confined to an ivory tower. Scholarship
has to prove its worth, not on its own
terms, but by service to the nation and to
the world."
Community service experience, when
connected with rigorous, reflective
inquiry, is an essential method for meet
ing both Casper and Handlin's challenges.
It enables students to provide effective
assistance off campus and expand academ
ic knowledge. It offers fruitful opportuni
ties to connect learning with value-laden
questions at both the personal (e.g., what
is my responsibility to others as a well
educated citizen?) and institutional (e.g.,
what is the relationship of scholarly
inquiry to the common good?) levels. We
are indeed fortunate that these endeavors
are supported at Stanford.
