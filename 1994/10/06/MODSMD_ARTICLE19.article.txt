Politicization of higher education dangerous, cowardly

PRESIDENT CASPER GREETED
the incoming class with advice to
analyze critically what they are
told. Indeed.
Let's begin with the official line, held
by almost all top administrators, that no
serious damage was done to humanistic
study by the politicization of higher edu
cation beginning roughly in 1968.
This baldfaced lie, almost as shame
less as the statement "Those gas cham
bers in concentration camps were only
for delousing," was totally scotched by
an assembly of many of the finest minds
of America at Stanford last April: Czes
law Milosz (called the greatest living
poet by his fellow Nobel laureate Joseph
Brodsky), Richard Wilbur (our poet lau
reate, seriously compared to Keats and
Shakespeare; T.S. Eliot's favorite Ameri
can poet), George Steiner (perhaps our
top critic), James Q. Wilson (our leading
social thinker, author of the "best book
of 1993" according to George Will), Rene

Girard (on a list published in France of
Sartre's worthiest successors), Robert
Conquest (the greatest historian of the
Soviet Union and an eminent poet) and
Ricardo Quinones (the eminent com
paratist), all testified — in submitted
texts or orally — to the tragic situation
on our best-known campuses. Milosz
spoke of the "cowardice" of the faculties
and administrators in the face of the
militant onslaught on quality. Like
Havel, he denounced the harebrained
view of "multiculturalism" that all cul
tures are equal — Milosz observed the
need to "prioritize," just as Havel saw
Western values as the salvation of the
world.
To ignore the testimony of these
great voices is like refusing to heed the
warning of Hesse, Mann, Einstein and
Freud that truth and decency were tak
ing an awful beating in Nazi Germany.
But that is exactly what our adminis
tration deliberately chose to do. Not

only did they stay away in droves, but
apparently even the secretaries have
been instructed not to acknowledge
reception of a videotape of the event. By
contrast, the man who many of us
regard as the most honest and authen
tic university president in America —
John Silber of Boston University —
requested the tape and pronounced it
"truly inspiring."
Following this event, Ricardo
Quinones went on to launch the Associa
tion of Literary Scholars and Critics.
Hundreds of leading figures have
already joined — the likes of Denis
Donohue, John Hollander, Richard
Poirier, E.D. Hirsch, Roger Shattuck,
Rene Girard and Christopher Ricks —
and thousands more are expected.
They are rigorously non-political, call
ing for the study, in depth and disinter
estedly, of literature as literature. At the
wonderful Boston kick-off convention in
September, it was decided not to indulge

in polemics.
This makes the whole enterprise sus
pect and non grata to the politicized (or
cowed) majority at Stanford, where, it
seems, the Association has no intention
of meeting in the foreseeable future.
That alienation is a grave matter —
particularly for our graduate students
— because the Association will certain
ly, in time, set the tone for serious
study in our field, and jobs will be at
stake.
Like President Casper said, look at
these matters critically. It is amazing
what you see when you stand aside from
the herd. Young people have a shot at
this — they haven't yet been co-opted in
the System. They have a chance not to
carry into the future the heavy burden
of moral guilt for a "spiritual holocaust"
from which George Will, for one, worries
we may never recover.
