# Stanford gets $3.6 million for digital libraries

As part of a $24 million research
project to create digital libraries in
American universities, Stanford has
received $3.6 million to research ways
to integrate library collections with
personal and research databases.
The four-year grant will allow
Stanford to work with NASA's Ames
Research Center and other private re
search companies to make informa
tion more organized and accessible
through advances in computer tech
nology.
"We're trying to take some ideas of
networking and apply them to a broad
audience that libraries and companies

are used to dealing with," said Com
puter Science Prof. Terry Winograd, a
principal scientist in the project.
"To society at large, the project
takes a step towards . . . making on
line information available to all kinds
of people," he said. "In the short run,
it will provide a fertile soil in which to
develop new ideas."
From a pool of 73 applicants, Stan
ford and five other universities were
awarded parts of the grant by the Na
tional Science Foundation, the Na
tional Aeronautics and Space Admin
istration and the Advanced Research
Projects Agency of the Defense De
partment.
Stanford's proposal to build a
multi-media database was submitted

in February as a combined effort of
Stanford computer science faculty and
library officials, said Sponsored Pro
jects Contract Officer Ruth Kaempf.
"The libraries can add the expertise
of librarians into the test-bed ... so a
product developed way, way, way
down the road will be able to deal with
real inquiries asked at the reference
desk," said Rebecca Lasher, head li
brarian and bibliographer at the
Mathematics and Computer Science
Library.
Initially, the research project will
only create a model, but a long term
goal might include placing whole texts
on the network and making them
available to everyone.
Research on digital libraries could

result in a network linking university
library resources to a national net
work of information. "The existing In
ternet is like a big library but is disor
ganized and chaotic," Winograd said.
The project aims to organize the infor
mation through client interfaces and
user-friendly information maps.
In addition, researchers hope to
make published materials available
over the computer system while pro
tecting intellectual property rights
and "providing a return for labor,"
Winograd said. "The result of the
four-year project will be a demo sys
tem to test our research ideas."
The researchers emphasize that
the grant is for research and not
product development.
Although other universities
are working on specific types of

media, Stanford is working on a
multi-media approach. "Our
focus is how to make it fit
together," Winograd said.
"We're the glue."
The researchers plan on hir
ing several full-time employees
and involving some students in
the project.
