# Proposition 187 would affect Asian Americans, all immigrants of color
## 
### 
We are writing in response to the
Proposition 187 article published in the
Oct. 4 edition of The Daily. We feel that
the article did not provide an adequate
explanation of the law.
Proposition 187 would force doctors,
teachers, social service providers and
police officers to act as Immigration and
Naturalization Service agents. This is not
their job. In effect, it would force them to
violate their own codes of ethics and con
fidentiality.
INS agents must deny services to any
one suspected of being undocumented,
and report them to the INS for deporta
tion. Who will be suspected? Anyone who

appears foreign. In a country where the
norm is white European Americans, this
points the finger at people of color.
Proposition 187 is not only a "Latino"
issue. This is a devisive tacit used by pro
ponents of the bill and the media to sepa
rate communities of color. The Daily arti
cle presented the campaign against
Proposition 187 on campus as mainly
Latino. The only groups cited as planning
to speak out in opposition were MEChA
and the Stanford Latino Law Students
Association. Opponents were said to
"argue that Proposition 187 is racist,
mainly targeting those of Mexican
decent." However, the law is not this nar
row if you read between the lines. This
anti-immigrant legislation targets all
immigrant communities of color, includ
ing the Asian community. It is false and
ignorant to present it as otherwise.
Asian Americans are already harassed
and assumed to be foreign — regardless of

where they were born — as a result of
how they look and/or speak. Proposition
187 would serve to exacerbate and institu
tionalize this racial harassment, making
Asians a greater target for suspicion. This
law rides on a tide of Japan bashing, anti-
Asian violence and anti-Asian stereotypes,
and has a strong basis in such racist mea
sures as the Chinese Exclusion Act and
the internment camps of World War 11.
We need to examine Proposition 187
in a larger context. Looking back in histo
ry, the United States has embraced immi
grants in times of economic boom,
exploiting them as cheap labor, only to
shut them out when economic conditions
worsen. It is also important to note that
many immigrants come to this country
because of the direct influence of the
United States' imperialistic policies
toward their countries.
Proposition 187 blames immigrants
for the economic hardships of California.

This flimsy logic uses immigrants as a
scapegoat. The proponents are playing on
the stereotype that undocumented immi
grants come to California to get free ser
vices and live off of welfare. The 1992
Immigration and Naturalization Service
study of undocumented residents proves
this supposition a fallacy. It states that
less than one percent of illegal immi
grants received General Assistance or
Social Security benefits, and that less
than 0.5 percent illegally received food
stamps.
Proposition 187 is just one law in a
larger attack on immigrants, the poor,
the homeless and people of color. This
law would serve to institutionalize the
racism and classism which already exist
in our society.
