### Kyle Utsumi Staff writer 
When the No. 1 Stanford
men's water polo team faces off
with No. 4 UCLA (8-3) today at
deGuerre Pool, coach Dante Det
tamanti's squad plans to get
straight to business.
Coming off a first-place finish
at last weekend's Northern Cali
fornia Tournament, the Cardinal
(12-1) meets a UCLA team that is
enjoying great improvement. The
Bruins return to the Bay Area
after surprising No. 3 California
to capture third place in the Nor
Cal Tourney on Sunday.
"UCLA has really improved,"
Dettamanti said. "They are a
much younger team than we are
and they keep getting better."
Although Dettamanti
expressed surprise at the Bruins'
victory over Cal, he believes that
if his team plays up to its poten
tial, the outcome should favor
the Cardinal.
"If we play our best and they
play their best, we should beat
them," Dettamanti said. "But
they will be very psyched up.
This is a big road trip for them."
Following their match against
the Cardinal, UCLA will face Cal
at Spieker Pool in Berkeley
tomorrow.
This third match-up between
the two league rivals will be the

first meeting in Mountain Pacif
ic Sports Federation action, and
will be the first time the squads
face each other at full strength.
Stanford defeated the Bruins
in the Southern California Tour
nament last month, 7-3. Sopho
more Jim Toring of UCLA and
Cardinal junior Jeremy Laster
did not play because they were in
Rome competing for the United
States at the World Champi
onships. The two are the only
collegiate athletes currently on
the U.S. National Team.
On Sunday, the Cardinal beat
UCLA 13-12 in the semi-finals of
the Nor Cal Tourney. Although
the final score was close, Stan
ford led several times during the
match by as many as three goals
despite the absence of senior All-
American Wolf Wigo.
"We were always up by two or
three goals, and then we'd make
a dumb mistake," Laster said.
"We let them stick around in the
game the whole time."
The Bruins field a team which
is physically smaller than Stan
ford, but which possesses excel
lent speed and driving ability.
The Cardinal will rely on finding
defensive mismatches, especially
at the center-forward position.

and Brian Wallin combined to
score five times from the center
forward position.
Dettamanti has stressed the
importance of remaining focused
afler the big tournament win last
weekend.
"We have a tendency after win
ning big games to come back and
not work out as well as we'd like,"
Dettamanti said. "[Last month]
we won the Southern Cal Tourna
ment, then lost to Cal. We've won
the tournaments, but we are cer
tainly not dominating anyone.
We'll be trying to guard against
being too confident."
Laster commented on the
importance of today's match. "It's
pretty important that we come out
and really beat UCLA," he said.
"Because they are No. 4, there is a
good chance we might meet them
in the second round of NCAAs.
Because they beat Cal, they might
rationalize that they can beat us.
We need to squash any hopes they
have of beating us."
Dettamanti believes that play
ing tight team defense and keep
ing a high level of concentration
and discipline on defense will be
keys to the game.
"We play well when we are wor
ried about the other team, like
against USC, but we have to play
good defense against everybody,"
Dettamanti said.
In particular, the Cardinal will
aim to shut down Toring, Mark
Sutter and Scott Turner, the
Bruin's team captain.
"We want to force the rest of
the team to beat us," Laster said.
"That will make it pretty tough
for them to win."
