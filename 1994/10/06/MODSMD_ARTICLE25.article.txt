# Lananna shows the ups and downs
## Leads the topranked runners 
### Jordan Wruble Staff writer 
"There's this little cartoon,"
joked head cross country coach Vin
Lananna. "It says, 'There's the
starting line. Get back here fast.' or
'Just keep making left turns [on the
track].' "
In a sport that basically every
one knows how to physically carry
out, running, Vin Lananna refers
to these two sayings which tend to
simplify his role as the men's and
women's head coach.
Lananna is amused by the cari
cature, but knows the reality of
coaching runners to be otherwise.
As evidenced by this year's success
— the Cardinal women are ranked
third, and the men are 17th —
there is much more to coaching
runners than simply telling them to
run.
"I see myself as an educator,"
Lananna said. While quarters end,
classes change and professors come
and go, Lananna's presence in the
lives of the athletes he trains is an
enduring one. And though he must
teach proper mechanics and effi
cient form, he also conditions his
athletes to help them focus mental
ly — Lananna wants the skills
developed in running to transcend
sports.
"I can't think of an example [of
another sport] where what you do
as an individual and how you deal
with your disappointments can
have a more lasting effect," said the
former captain of the C.W. Post
College cross country team in New
York. "I know I learned a lot about
myself. When you're out there at
three and a half miles, it's real easy
to just shut down."
From the outside, cross country
does not seem like a "team" sport.
Although the success is measured
by the team score, athletes run
against each other. Lananna
emphatically refutes this concep
tion of cross country.
"It is hardly an individual sport.
It is probably the ultimate team
sport," he said. "You are only as
good as your fifth person."
For this reason, Lananna is
quick to point out the strong bond
which develops between runners on
the team.
"The team atmosphere is creat
ed out of an appreciation that >our
teammates have for what you are
all after," Lananna explained. "You
get a common focus ... a common
sense of purpose."
"In cross country, it's very easy
to create a team atmosphere," he
added. "If one person doesn't do
well, no one else can recover it part
way through. In basketball, you
take a bad shot, someone else can
rebound it and take a shot. In cross

country and track — it's you. You
can't stop and put a substitute in."
Lananna considers cross coun
try unlike other sports for another
reason. "It's not fun. There's no
ball," Lananna said, almost with
derision for such sports. "It's you

testing your physical conditioning."
The toughness required for the
sport makes coaching more of chal
lenge. Lananna strives to enhance
his athletes' self-esteem. He
encourages competitors to deal
with disappointment by looking at

the big picture.
"You've got to keep things in
perspective," Lananna said. He
even diagrams a picture. Life is the
big circle, Stanford a smaller part of

Vin Lananna knows that being a coach, like being a runner, takes patience, teamwork, and a sense
of humor.
it, and any given race a minutely
small piece of it all. Do the runners
throw it back at him when he push
es them to work harder? "All the
time. I always hear about the anal
ogy of the big picture," he said.
While Lananna tells the runners
to maintain perspective, he is

unable to view his own achieve
ments from such a distance. "I'm a
terrible loser, in spite of all my great
philosophical comments."
Lananna also admits to showing
emotion, although he tries to quell
his visible anger and frustration.
Lananna believes he does not need
to be a fiery, "bang-my-head
against-the-wall-type coach."
"I think that if you create an
atmosphere where the athletes
depend upon one another . .. that

will take care of motivation. The
students here are already motivat
ed."
is willing to try the
unusual to inspire his team. In his
first year coaching at Dartmouth,
needed a way to bring
together a talented but under
achieving team going into a meet
against then-undefeated Harvard.
The Dartmouth te;im had failed to
win at that point in the season, and
had succumbed to Harvard "many,

many years in a row." After
attempt ing to play down the eager
ly anticipated meet, Lananna lost
his cool.
"I'd just had it,"he explained.
Lananna threatened to pull anyone
off the course who did not stay close
to the Harvard runner with whom
they were supposed to keep pace.
He decided that at the two mile
mark, any Dartmouth runner not
close enough to put his hand on the
Harvard runner's shoulder would

not be allowed to finish. Dart mouth
won.
Lananna had even forgotten
his threat until one of his athletes
reached out and placed his hand
on a Harvard runner's shoulder a
half-mile from the finish. The
sight allowed the normally intense
coach a moment of levity. "It was
a breakthrough for our team.
From then on we did quite well,"
he said.
Lananna confesses to the viabili

ty of such ploys. "Sometimes you've
got to do this kind of weird thing."
Although he has not found the
right scheme here yet, it has not
stopped him from trying. Focused
on the goal of reaching the NCAA
championship meet with both
teams, Lananna said his runners
try to goad him into bets.
"If [the men's team] had beaten
Cal last year in a dual meet, I was
going to have to shave my beard."
Maybe this year.
