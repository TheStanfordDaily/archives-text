# Lananna shows the ups and downs
## Leads the topranked runners

"There's this little cartoon,"
joked head cross country coach Vin
Lananna. "It says, 'There's the
starting line. Get back here fast.' or
'Just keep making left turns [on the
track].' "
In a sport that basically every
one knows how to physically carry
out, running, Vin Lananna refers
to these two sayings which tend to
simplify his role as the men's and
women's head coach.
Lananna is amused by the cari
cature, but knows the reality of
coaching runners to be otherwise.
As evidenced by this year's success
— the Cardinal women are ranked
third, and the men are 17th —
there is much more to coaching
runners than simply telling them to
run.
"I see myself as an educator,"
Lananna said. While quarters end,
classes change and professors come
and go, Lananna's presence in the
lives of the athletes he trains is an
enduring one. And though he must
teach proper mechanics and effi
cient form, he also conditions his
athletes to help them focus mental
ly — Lananna wants the skills
developed in running to transcend
sports.
"I can't think of an example [of
another sport] where what you do
as an individual and how you deal
with your disappointments can
have a more lasting effect," said the
former captain of the C.W. Post
College cross country team in New
York. "I know I learned a lot about
myself. When you're out there at
three and a half miles, it's real easy
to just shut down."
From the outside, cross country
does not seem like a "team" sport.
Although the success is measured
by the team score, athletes run
against each other. Lananna
emphatically refutes this concep
tion of cross country.
"It is hardly an individual sport.
It is probably the ultimate team
sport," he said. "You are only as
good as your fifth person."
For this reason, Lananna is
quick to point out the strong bond
which develops between runners on
the team.
"The team atmosphere is creat
ed out of an appreciation that >our
teammates have for what you are
all after," Lananna explained. "You
get a common focus ... a common
sense of purpose."
"In cross country, it's very easy
to create a team atmosphere," he
added. "If one person doesn't do
well, no one else can recover it part
way through. In basketball, you
take a bad shot, someone else can
rebound it and take a shot. In cross

country and track — it's you. You
can't stop and put a substitute in."
Lananna considers cross coun
try unlike other sports for another
reason. "It's not fun. There's no
ball," Lananna said, almost with
derision for such sports. "It's you

testing your physical conditioning."
The toughness required for the
sport makes coaching more of chal
lenge. Lananna strives to enhance
his athletes' self-esteem. He
encourages competitors to deal
with disappointment by looking at

the big picture.
"You've got to keep things in
perspective," Lananna said. He
even diagrams a picture. Life is the
big circle, Stanford a smaller part of

Vin Lananna knows that being a coach, like being a runner, takes patience, teamwork, and a sense
of humor.
