Great defense, two Erin Martin goals and a ner
vous freshman lifted the third-ranked Stanford
women's soccer team (8-0) to a 2-0 victory over No.
20 St. Mary's (6-4-1) yesterday at Maloney Field.
With the victory, Stanford boasts the lone unblem
ished record in Division I-A.
A bipartisan crowd of 350 people witnessed the
battle of the Bay Area's nationally-ranked powers
and the debut of Stanford freshman fullback Jen
Royval. Her task was to contain St. Maiy's senior
forward Lori Hokerson, who entered the contest tied
for sixth in the nation in goal-scoring with 11 in only
10 games.
Royval and the Stanford defense held the Gael
offense, which had averaged 2.4 goals per game on
the season, to a mere five shots on goal. While Hok
erson had three of those five attempts, she and the
rest of the St. Mary's squad struggled to generate
quick scoring opportunities.
"What a great game fßoyval] played," said head
coach lan Sawyers. "We wanted to use Jen's speed to
counteract their quick player [Hokerson], and I
thought she did an unbelievable job."
After a scoreless first half with few real scoring
threats from either team, the Stanford offense final
ly broke through less than five minutes after the
break. Royval was taken down near the right side of
the St. Mary's box, setting up a free kick over the
objections of Gael fans, who felt the freshman was
acting.
Senior fullback Melinda Minstrell received the
kick and passed to Martin, who scored her sixth goal
of the year from close range. Minstrell's second assist
