St. Mary's 0

Great defense, two Erin Martin goals and a ner
vous freshman lifted the third-ranked Stanford
women's soccer team (8-0) to a 2-0 victory over No.
20 St. Mary's (6-4-1) yesterday at Maloney Field.
With the victory, Stanford boasts the lone unblem
ished record in Division I-A.
A bipartisan crowd of 350 people witnessed the
battle of the Bay Area's nationally-ranked powers
and the debut of Stanford freshman fullback Jen
Royval. Her task was to contain St. Maiy's senior
forward Lori Hokerson, who entered the contest tied
for sixth in the nation in goal-scoring with 11 in only
10 games.
Royval and the Stanford defense held the Gael
offense, which had averaged 2.4 goals per game on
the season, to a mere five shots on goal. While Hok
erson had three of those five attempts, she and the
rest of the St. Mary's squad struggled to generate
quick scoring opportunities.
"What a great game fßoyval] played," said head
coach lan Sawyers. "We wanted to use Jen's speed to
counteract their quick player [Hokerson], and I
thought she did an unbelievable job."
After a scoreless first half with few real scoring
threats from either team, the Stanford offense final
ly broke through less than five minutes after the
break. Royval was taken down near the right side of
the St. Mary's box, setting up a free kick over the
objections of Gael fans, who felt the freshman was
acting.
Senior fullback Melinda Minstrell received the
kick and passed to Martin, who scored her sixth goal
of the year from close range. Minstrell's second assist

of the campaign ties her with Mar
tin and junior forward Dena Dey
for the team lead.
The nail in the Gael coffin came
at 72 minutes, 38 seconds, with
Martin's second goal of the game,
thanks to sophomore forward
Emily Hurt's first assist of 1994.
"It was a really good cross from
Wendy [Latimer], and then Emily
got her head on it," said Martin,
who fired 10 shots on goal in the
contest. "It was an awesome flick
to me. I was in the right position
and just tapped it in."
Senior goalkeeper Jennifer
Poehler was also in the proper spot
when St. Mary's attempted to
score. Poehler, who entered the
game ranked seventh nationally
among goalkeepers, lowered her
goals-against average to 0.375 with
her fifth shutout of the season.
On the other hand, the Gaels
have struggled recently in goal.
Since senior goalkeeper Sylvia Kel
ley broke her fibula and dislocated

her ankle two weeks ago, sopho
more Nicole Barbacovi had allowed
11 goals in four games. Neverthe
less, Sawyers did not panic with a
0-0 tie at the break.
"Actually at halflime we just
wanted the kids to keep playing the
way they were. We were getting
our rhythm going, it was just in 10-
minute spurts," Sawyers said.
"They did a good job of applying
themselves in the second half."
Though Royval tired late in the
game, the post-game talk centered
around the lightning-quick fresh
man fullback.
"She's got great speed, which
helps out on defense a lot," said
Martin. "She did a really great job
stepping in there for the first time
and starting. She just dominated
[Hokerson]." Royval attributed her
success to anxiety.
"It was a little nerve-wracking,"
said Royval. "I usually play better
when I'm nervous. It gives me a lot
of energy."
Royval may return to the start
ing lineup in the Cardinal's next
home match against San Diego on
Sunday which will wrap up the six
game homestand for Stanford.
