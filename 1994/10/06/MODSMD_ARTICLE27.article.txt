## A 						new coach 
### Allyson Mizoguchi Editorial staff 
Come springtime, the Cardinal women's soft
ball team will have a new leader when it takes the
field.
Former UCLA standout softball player Kristy
Howard, 23, was recently hired to the Stanford
staff as assistant coach. A four-year shortstop as
a Bruin, as well as a talented athlete in tennis
and soccer, she is expected to bring plenty of
expertise to the position. Howard was selected
All-Pacific 10 Conference every season of her col
legiate career, and led the UCLA team to nation
al championships in 1990 and 1992 and second
place finishes in 1991 and 1993.
"We are very fortunate to be able to have
Kristy join our program," said Stanford head
coach Sandy Pearce. "Her experience playing in
championship games and in the Pac-10 will be
very beneficial to our program."
Howard's senior year at UCLA is testimony to
both her academic and athletic prowess. While
completing her degree in social psychology, she
started on the women's soccer team and shot her
way to ranking as the team's second-highest
scorer with three goals and 10 assists.
Switching sports once again, Howard compet
ed for the Bruins' nationally-ranked tennis team
as sixth on the singles ladder. This was all in
addition to hitting .321 during her senior soft
ball season with three homeruns and 33 RBl's.
She posted an impressive collegiate total of 175
hits, 75 RBl's, and a career batting average of
.262. Howard was a three-sport chameleon in
high school as well, as she was named San Diego
area player of the year in softball, soccer and
tennis at Monte Vista High School in Spring Val
ley, Calif.
Howard is known for sparking her teams with
both skill and personality, which will be a wel
come addition to the Cardinal squad. Voted
"Most Inspirational" on UCLA's soccer team, she
is a naturally gifted athlete who leads by exam
ple.
"Kristy is a fantastic athlete and a terrific per
son," Pearce said. "I am excited that she has cho
sen to enter the coaching profession."
