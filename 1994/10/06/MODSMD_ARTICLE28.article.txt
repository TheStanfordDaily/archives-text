# Men's soccer looking to turn year around
## 
### Joseph Hei Staff writer 
In the cutthroat world of college athlet
ics, not many teams get a second chance.
The Stanford men's soccer team will actu
ally get one this season, starting with this
weekend's games at Cal State-Sacramento
and the Air Force Academy.
This weekend marks the beginning of
play in the Mountain Pacific Sports Fed
eration, the Cardinal's league. Even
though Stanford's record so far is lack
lusuter (1-8-1), the team's post-season
hopes rest only on their league record.
"We're lucky," said junior forward Car

men D'Onofrio. "We're
in a fortunate situation
because we can fall
back on league play."
All of the Cardinal's
efforts and attention
have been focused on
turning this season
around and making a
run for the division
title.
Surprisingly, a
major impetus for this
rejuvenation of Stan
ford's winning attitude
and hunger were last
weekend's games

'Everybody on the team
is pretty positive and
we're definitely looking
at our losses in a good
light. We're practicing
the same, but now with
a refreshed attitude.'

against Rhode Island and the University
of Akron. Though the Cardinal lost both
match-ups, the team finally started to
play the style and pace of game it had been
working on all season. Also, head coach
Colin Lindores reported that many of the
freshmen in Stanford's extremely young
line-up started to exhibit high levels of
play.
"I think we're on an upswing. [Sacra
mento Statel will be the warm-up to our
winning streak," said freshman midfield
er/forward Justin Leßlanc.
Although Leßlanc's statement's might
sound overly optimistic, last season does
provide a precedent. After having a dismal
starting half of the season, the Cardinal
closed out last year with a streak that
included six wins in a row.
However, the Hornets and the Falcons
will prove to be challenging obstacles for
Stanford to overcome. The Hornets (4-3)
are not a premier team in the division, but
they do have players who could damage

the Cardinal. Chief among these is sopho
more forward Jamel Mitchell. Mitchell is
tied for the eighth highest scoring in the
division with eight points, and also ties for
fourth in the goals department with four
goals.
The Falcons (5-4) have had a strong
season and will prove to be the more diffi
cult team to topple. They boast a power
ful offensive lineup this season. In partic
ular, there are three players that Stan
ford will have to stymie in order to clip
the Air Force's wings. Freshman sensa
tion midfielder Drew Dougherty has
already scored 11 points so far this sea
son, fifth highest in the division. Sopho

more midfielder Dan
Clayton and senior mid
fielder Gerald Fortuna
each have nine points
for the season and rank
seventh in the point
totals.
"Air Force will
be tough," D'Onofrio
said, "not only because
of the team, but also
mainly because of the
altitude and the adjust
ment we'll have to
make."
Stanford does
not rank well on the

individual statistics, with only senior goal
keeper Jim Masetti eighth on the goal
keeping count, but the lineup is filled with
talent that could pay off in the second half
of the season.
"A lot of players have stepped up this
year," D'Onofrio said. The freshmen have
been essential, filling in for injured play
ers. Leßlanc, Jeff Szekeres, Eric Vande
velde and Dan Wytock (who suffered a
knee injury last weekend) are among the
freshmen who have performed well for the
Cardinal.
"I think we can take the MPSF, despite
our injuries," Leßlanc said. "Everybody
on the team is pretty positive and we're
definitely looking at our losses in a good
light. We're practicing the same, but now
with a refreshed attitude."
D'Onofrio offers a more tempered view.
"We can definitely salvage the season.
Colin has been giving us a lot of encour
agement. Practices have been going well,
so I feel good about this," he said.
