# Children's Hospital takes to the streets

Doctors don't usually pay house
calls these days, but a new program
at Stanford's Lucile Salter Packard
Children's Hospital will let them
make occasional neighborhood vis
its.
The Children's Hospital recent
ly received a $1 million grant from
Blue Cross of California to imple
ment a mobile pediatric care unit,
which would bring health care to
disadvantaged children in the Bay
Area.
The Comprehensive Pediatric
Mobile Medical Program was de
signed to provide free primary
health care to "children that are
falling through the cracks," said
Peggy Gibbs, director of corporate
and foundation relations for the
Children's Hospital.
The 40-foot van will serve as a
"pediatric office on wheels" for chil
dren from Marin County to the city

of San Luis Obispo, Gibbs said.
"Access is the big issue," said
Jean Tips, public relations manag
er for the Children's Hospital. "We
are going directly into apartments
and day care centers to provide care
to those children who are the poor
est of the population."
The grant will pay for the van
and supplies, and will cover two
years of the program's operating
costs, Tips said.
The original grant proposal
called for the expansion of the Chil
dren's Hospital's current program
of free mobile immunizations, the
two-year-old MOVE! for Kids pro
ject.
"MOVE! for Kids is a project
that combines the efforts of the
[Children's Hospital] and the local
East Palo Alto community to pro
vide free vaccinations to children in
this area," Tips said.
The MOVE! program, which op
erates two half-days each week, has
seen more than 1,400 children and
administered 1,800 vaccinations in
the last two years. "The goal of the
new mobile program is to bump up
the services of MOVE! to a com
prehensive primary care unit,"
Tips said.
Through work on the MOVE!
project, Children's Hospital volun
teers have already seen the need for
a more comprehensive children's
care. MOVE! frequently encoun
ters sick children who need more
intensive attention, Tips said.
"The MOVE! program actually
did do some check-ups and was
able to refer children to other pri
mary care locations," she added.
"In one instance we even were able
to detect a heart defect in a child."
The Comprehensive Mobih
Unit will continue to refer children
to other health care providers, and
help "plug children into the sys
tem," Tips said.
Although it offers referral ser
vices and vaccinations, the MOVE!
project is unable to provide contin
uing medical services. "A big ele
ment of the comprehensive mobile
program is to do follow-up work
and make sure that any problem is
being tracked," Tips said.
The new mobile program will be
staffed by paid medical personnel,
Gibbs said. Tips added that the
MOVE! program wasn't able to do
much comprehensive care because
it was a volunteer program.
A third-party needs assessment
group might be used to determine

target areas for the program, but
Gibba said organizers already have
a good idea of local needs from the
MOVE! experience.
The children to be served by the
new mobile unit, and who are cur
rently served by the MOVE! pro
gram, are those living in poverty and
without insurance, or with minimal
insurance coverage, Gibbs added.
Currently, the MOVE! program
treats children "without asking
any questions," said Sherri Sager,
director of governmental affairs for
the Children's Hospital. Yet Cali
fornia Proposition 187 — a mea
sure on this year's ballot which
would make undocumented, illegal
immigrants ineligible for health
care services except in an emergen
cy — could change the way the
mobile outreach treats children.
"If the proposition passes we
would certainly comply with all
Laws," Sager said. "But Lf a child came
to the van in an emergency situation
we would certainly treat them."
Gibbs said that the program will
be flexible — able to provide ser
vices "when and where the need
is," which could include mobile van
trips to neighborhoods during
night and weekend hours.
Organizers at the Children's
Hospital looked at other mobile
health units to help design the
Comprehensive Mobile Medical
Program. The Children's Health
Fund in New York and nine other
units were used as models to plan
the program, Gibbs said.
The Blue Cross grant only pro
vides program funding for two
years, but Gibbs said the Chil
dren's Hospital is planning ahead
to find future operating funds.
