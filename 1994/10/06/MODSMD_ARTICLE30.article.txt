# Dallin speaks about Russian economy
## 
### Jason Waggoner Staff writer 
Alexander Dallin, emeritus professor of
history and political science, fed an audience
of about 40 his version of "Russia Redefined,
1991 - " last night in the History Corner.
Dallin not only provided the audience
with information on the state of the econo
my, Russian alcoholism and the recent
appearance of outrageously priced kiwi
fruits in Moscow, he also addressed the issue
that concerned the audience most: What
effect has the United States had on Russia's
transition from a command economy to a
market economy?
Dallin, who maintains many friends in
the former Soviet Union, said, "The symbol
of the Americanization of Russia is the
Snickers bar — not because it is an American
food product but because of the snickers at
American commercial influence."
Dallin's lecture is the first talk in the
"Stanford Series in the Humanities" which
according to the Stanford Alumni Associa
tion is bent on "examining fascinating con

temporary and historical topics."
The Series in the Humanities replaced the
Series in the Arts, which was confined to the
impact of the arts on contemporary culture.
The expansion gives the alumni association
latitude to bring in more varied speakers,
said Jim Dawson, program director for Con
tinuing Education Alumni Programs.
The Series in the Humanities now encom
passes such broad topics as "Berlin Between
the Wars" and "Stanford Authors at Work."
Lectures are open to the general public.
Dallin talked about many of the problems
facing Russia in 1994, such as the rise of
crime and corruption, the threat of opposi
tion groups to the regime and an incompe
tent judicial system.
While other command economies have
gained something in the switch to a market
economy, Russia has lost its positive direc
tion, Dallin said.
Looking ahead to the future, Dallin said
he worried about the lack of leadership in
Russia's political system. "A demigod could
take advantage of the situation where a
political vacuum exists," he said.

The series which Dallin kicked off, "Rus
sia Redefined, 1991- ", features five of
America's leading authorities on Russia con
textualizing the recent dissolution of the
Soviet empire and providing a framework for
understanding the new Russia, Dawson said.
The next lecture will be given on Oct. 12
by Gail Lapidus, who will examine the new
challenges Eastern Europe and Central Asia
face in the transition to democratic govern
ments. Lapidus is a senior fellow at the Insti
tute for International Studies at Stanford
University and a professor emeritus of polit
ical science at UC-Berkeley.
Rounding off the lecture series will be
Gregory Freidin, professor of Slavic lan
guages; Michael Bernstam, senior research
fellow at the Hoover Institution; and David
Holloway, co-director of the Center for Inter
national Security and Arms Control.
This series will be followed by the "Berlin
Between the Wars" series. The series, led off
by Robert Hamrdla — the first director of
the Stanford Program in Berlin — will probe
that city as the center of the best and worst
of human creativity.
