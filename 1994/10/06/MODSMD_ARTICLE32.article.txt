# The 						Crash Test Dummies
## Singin' about sex death and God

Here on earth I'll have my cake
Gonna eat it too, make no mistake
'Cause if it's a question of to be or not to be
I'll put on my boots and go see what I can see
These lyrics written by Brad Roberts,
lead singer and songwriter of Crash
Test Dummies, largely reflect the road
the band from Winnipeg, Canada, has taken
to reach their current status as a top musical
act.
Roberts' musical career began in the late
1980s. A student at the University of Win
nipeg, Roberts and his band played mostly
cover tunes at local clubs. The budding song
writer, who was actually planning a future of
graduate study in English literature, put
some of his songs on a demo tape, and from
there the Crash Test Dummies' reputation
began.
"When Brad made the demo tape, we were
not a serious group," said Crash Test bassist,
Dan Roberts. "After the tape, we started get
ting offers for Canadian record deals. In
1989, we went from being strictly recreation
al to becoming a 'real band.'"
The changes of the year were once a blessing
But this year they're the seasons of my discon
tent
But I cannot rewrite my old diaries
I can only recall all the things that came and
went
The band's first album release, "The
Ghosts That Haunt Me," offered a dis
tinct look into Robert's mind as a
songwriter and a thinker. His easily recogniz
able bass baritone voice relates the light com
parison between Tarzan and Superman on
the record's biggest hit, "Superman Song."
The album also introduced several of the
features which set Crash Test Dummies apart
from other young bands. The harmonica of
Benjamin Darvill was an integral part of the
lilting, country rhythms which characterize
"The Ghosts That Haunt Me."
In addition to Darvill's harmonic mastery,
the melodious background vocals of Ellen
Reid add body to the group's music, con
tributing to the full, rich sound that is associ
ated with it.
This debut effort by Crash Test Dummies,
however, is a work that the group would like
to leave in the past.
"The direction of writing was one of com
bining genres," Dan Roberts said. "It was
done for fun — it was a fun time for the band.
It was a very green stage for everyone."
"The Ghosts That Haunt Me," produced
in a mere two weeks, did well in Canada,
going triple platinum. The album was not as
well known in the United States, and sold
only 200,000 copies. Although many Ameri
cans are now discovering the 1991 release, the
band does not necessarily agree that it is a

great work.
"It is less than what we would like," Dan
Roberts said. "It was done with a very recre
ational approach. No one in the band likes
that album very much."
The mixed genres found on the release in
clude organic elements, country nuances and
old-time rhythms and flavorings. With their
newest album, "God Shuffled His Feet," the
Crash Test Dummies toss the frivolity

out the window in favor
of an aggressive
rhythm-section-driven,
densely-textured, con
sistently inventive

style.
With the help
of MTV, college
radio and com
mercial radio
catering to "al
ternative"
sounds, the
group's second
offering has en
joyed staggering
success. Led by
the single,
"Mmm Mmm

Mmm Mmm," the
album reflects the
thoughtful writing

o o
style and recurring
subject matter of Brad
Roberts' songs.

The people sipped their wine
And what with God there,
they asked him questions

Like — do you have to eat
Or get your hair cut in heaven?
And if your eye got poked out in this life
Would it be waiting up in heaven with your
wife?
Such musings can be expected from
Roberts, who as an undergraduate ma
jored in both English literature and phi
losophy. Roberts claims he simply writes
songs about the things people think about
most — sex, death and God.
While musically, "God Shuffled His Feet"
sounds much different from the bands' first
recording, the topical matter and writing
style remain similar.
"(Brad's) songwriting style is still the
same," said Dan Roberts. "This effort is more
lush as a whole. This is more heavily pro
duced, uses more keyboards and has a differ
ent sound texture. "God Shuffled..took us
four months — we worked more as a group,
with everyone arranging their parts. We all
had more depth on this album."
On the effects of Brad's diverse education
on his songwriting, Dan said, "His education
has a certain amount of effect on his work.

He's a broad thinker."
"Brad is fascinated by subjects that reflect
on that," he continued. "These are topics that
interest him — his writing is not autobio
graphical and is not heavy-handed. He is
never preachy about his writing — it's more
food for thought."
Won't you come

To my funeral when my days are done
Life's not long
And so I hope when I am finally dead and gone
that you'll gather round when I am lowered
into the ground
What does she think when she foretells a dis
ease?
Would she keep it a secret if death stood before
me?
What could some cards hold, where is her
foothold
Can I escape what she sees?
The ever-inquisitive Brad Roberts has
led his band past musical boundaries
to the top of musical charts. "God
Shuffled His Feet" has made the group's pop
ularity skyrocket in the United States, a fact
that Dan Roberts attributes to simple airplay.
When asked if their neighbors to the south
might have different tastes in music than
Canadians, Dan Roberts said, "No, I think
they are pretty similar. People heed what they
are fed. In Canada, radio fed people our first
album — here they didn't. Americans just
didn't hear that record."

Although the media has classified the
Crash Test Dummies as an alternative act,
the band does not agree with this labeling.
Acknowledging that "alternative" is a
widely-used yet quite ambiguous term in
the music industry today, Dan Roberts
identified the Crash Test Dummies as, "a
pop band performing pop music."
This pop music has given the group a

chance to tour around the world, performing
for enthusiastic crowds of thinkers, philoso
phers and lovers of music.
"Touring is an enjoyable part of this job,"
Dan Roberts said. "We get to see a lot of differ
ent places. It does take up a lot of time though.
And it's tough doing the same songs for a year
and a half."
Fans in the Bay Area who are waiting to
hear Brad Roberts wax philosophical in
concert, need not look too far into the fu
ture. Roberts will bring his thoughts, beliefs,
questions and the "Crash Test Dummies" to
a crash-landing in the Bay Area this Friday,
playing the Warfield in San Fransisco. ■
