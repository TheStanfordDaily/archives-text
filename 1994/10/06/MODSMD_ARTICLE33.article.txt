# Coming ATTRACTIONS
## 'I don't think we're on Broadway anymore' San Jose theater company a long way off 
### Linda Friedlieb 
The City Lights Theater Company bills
themselves as "off-off-Broadway." Really,
it should be more like "off-off-off-off
off-off-off-Broadway."
And maybe then some.
City Light's latest production, "Coming At
tractions," is basically a one-note show, and
after about 10 minutes, even that note gets
repetitive in that kind of shrill, piercing way
conducive to splitting migraines.
"Coming Attractions" is a spoof on the
media featuring a cynical con-man I agent
named Manny who uses a petty criminal
named Lonnie to manipulate the media and
become rich and famous. It's just another twist
on the American dream.
Pretending to be a reporter, Manny (John
Kovac) meets Lonnie (Owen Baker-Mynn)
while the latter is botching up a petty crime and
holding three hostages captive. Manny con
vinces lonnie to turn himself in to the cops and

then allow Manny to remake him in the image
of a truly eclectic, psychopathic mass-murderer.
As a comedy, the show lacks a little some
thing called humor. Many of the lines are so
over-the-top that you have no choice but to
laugh a little or cry out in pain.
"He lacked a true weirdness factor — you
know the kind of thing that makes newspapers
jump out of the rack," says Manny, a.k.a. the
walking cliche.
While wearing a 1 lalloween disguise of a
skeleton, mass-murderer-to-be cries,
"How do you expect me to murder someone
when I feel ridiculous?"
Playwright Ted 'Lilly's writing is so bad that
1 quickly began to feel sorry for the actors, who
were clearly doing the best with the terrible
lines they had no choice but to utter.
One truly sad lesson can be gleaned from
this play— how not to do a spoof. If the open
ine nicht audience was not full of friends and

family members of the theater company and
cast, full-fledged hisses might not have been
stifled.
Wasted potential looms throughout, as
"Coming Attractions" can't help but bring to
mind thoughts of the O.J. Simpson spectacle
currently haunting the boob tube. But there s
no relevant critique of the media; instead we're
stuck with string upon string ofbad one-liners.
The worst part (yes, it does get worse) is that
the play offends, and not just because of the bad
jokes. A skit featuring a terrorist comedian from
an unnamed Middle Eastern country spews
forth his jokes in garbled mock-Arabic while
handling a machine gun with great pizzazz.
He offended long before he asked a groan
ing audience, "What are you, Jews?"
The only thing more sparse than good jokes
in City Lights' San Jose theater is scenery. The
theater, which the company just moved into
earlier this year, is a converted garage with 99

movable chairs for audicnce.
Ultimately, "Coming Attractions" shows
the dangers of sensationalizing crime.
But what the play really teaches is that small
theater companies should choose their mater
ial more carefully.
After all, you can't trust everyone who picks
up a pen.■
