# Flirting with Fame: Collective Soul's Shane Evans
## 
### Tasneem Campwala 
Give me a word
Give rue a sign
Show me where to look
Tell me what will I find...
Oh, heaven let your light shine down...
the hit track from Collective Soul's
debut album "Hints, Allegations, and Things
Left Unsaid" (Atlantic), is an ironic combina
tion of lyrical picas for heavenly inspiration and
grungy guitar riffs. And judging from Collective
Soul's chart-topping success, heaven has indeed in
terceded by placing this quintet of rockers in the spot
light.
"Fame really bites you in the butt," drummer Shane
Evans says with a Southern drawl that reveals his Geor
gian roots. He is talking to me over the phone from his
hotel room in Houston, where Collective Soul is on tour. Al
though Evans and 1 talk about the routine interview topic
such as fame and the meaning of the band's music, he adroit
ly sets me at ease with his friendly and flirtatious manner.
"Success changes things. Of course, there's the
money. And it's great to go to McDonald's at home
and hear people say, 'Wow, that's Shane, he's from
Collective Soul' while before they'd say, There's
Shane. Why doesn't he go to college or get a real
job?' "
But success has been a long time in coming for
Collective Soul. The band spent a number of years try-

ing to get a record deal. They tried different styles of music,
different band names, but nothing seemed to work. In 1992,
frustrated by the lack of favorable response, Ed Roland, Col
lective Souls lead singer, dissolved the band and decided to try
a different tack — songwriting and publishing.
With the help of Evans — who refers to himself as "the
band's lowly drummer" — and Ross Childress, the lead gui
tarist, Roland finished up with his demos by spring of 1993.
"Shine" was one of the tracks that appeared on Roland's song
writing demos.
Originally plugged by a local college station in Atlanta, the
song caught on at radio stations everywhere. In short order,
"Hints" began selling out in local stores. Ironically, it was their
radio success that ultimately brought Collective Soul to the at
tention of Atlantic Records.
rhe members of Collective Soul seem to have come a
long way from the days as down-on-their-luck rock
ers. Presently, they are on tour as the opening band for
Aerosmith.
"It's cool," Evans says. "We get to play for sold-out shows.
Lots of people haven't heard of us yet, but the audience always
responds enthusiastically."
In their spare time, Collective Soul gains additional expo
sure by doing radio shows — "It's great, lots ol free I -shirts,
quips Evans.

"So you probably don't have to go shopping for clothes any
more," I say.
"Actually, we should have a tour-bus garage sale."
"Sure, you could sell those T-shirts tor a couple hundred
dollars."
"Yeah, I could hold this one up and say, 'I sweated in this
one last night,' " Evans says in his typical joking manner.
They continue to play small clubs, about which Evans says
the band is enthusiastic, since Collective Soul gets to play
longer and to feel closer to its audience.
The songs on "Hints, Allegations, and Things Left Unsaid"
range from pop ballads to alternative tunes to the heavier
sounds of hard rock. Evans says that what he likes about Col
lective Soul's music is that it can be both "alternative and
mainstream at the same time."
"We're alternative in the sense that we can be spontaneous
and try new things," he explains. "I think we're mainstream
because we can appeal to lots of different people and our lyrics
are straightforward."
JT ~T~ ints" is a solid album, its strength lying in the origi-
I t nality and uniqueness of each cut on the CD. lake
M M for instance, "Pretty Donna "an instrumental piece

performed by a full-string ensemble. On the other
end of the spectrum lies "Sister Don't Cry," a tune in
fluenced by gospel sounds.
Evans' heavy drums and Roland's gravelly growl give
an edge to "Breathe," while the sweeter-sounding,
f acoustic "Heaven's Already Here" hints at country-blues.
Finally, "Scream" is a piece of old-fashioned rock n roll.
Evans claims he has been most strongly influenced by
classic rockers like Led Zepplin and Black Sabbath.
Roland is a fan of everyone from Elton John to Michael
Penn, AC/DC to King's X.
"Of course, we all listened to the Beatles. But then
again, everyone says they were influenced by the Beat
les," Evans remarks with a laugh. As tor Southern music,
Evans says that they've certainly listened to Southern
bands and may have adopted similar styles in their songs,
but points out, "We're not Southern-fried."
The underlying characteristic of Collective Soul's music,
which unifies the seemingly divergent styles of the 13 tracks
on the album, is the message of spirituality in the lyrics.
For instance, Roland sings about his grandfather's
bout with leukemia in "Goodnight, Good Guy": "I'll break
the bread of a new day and wonder/ if faith will carry me
along/ but days are longer and my heart gets weaker, and/
1 can only stay so strong."
Roland, the son of a minister, manages to convey
hope, optimism and faith in his lyrics without sounding
preachy.
"1 wouldn't say that our music is particularly religious; it's
about having fun. But we like to have fun and have a spiritual
message, too," Evans said.
"Hints, Allegations, and Thing Left Unsaid" is a refreshing
album, striking a perfect balance between the extremes of
Nine Inch Nails' dark cynicism and George Michael's perkier
pop-style.
Collective Soul will appear with Aerosmith in the Bay Area
on Saturday. The band also expects to finish their next album
by the end of this year and to go on tour in Australia, Japan,
and Europe next year.
~W \ vans and company seem to be handling their heady
A/ prospects for the future with equanimity and light-
A. / heartedness.
"Doesn't fame ever get to you?" 1 ask.

"It's a lot of fun, but I'd like
to hang on to the simpler
things in life, like my apart
ment and my dogs. Maybe I'll
get myself a wife, too."
"Where?" I ask. "On the
road?"
"Sure, at the end of every
show, I'll stand up and an
nounce, 'I'm available!' " ■

the bread of a new day and wonder/ if faith will carry me
along/ but days are longer and my heart gets weaker, and/
1 can only stay so strong."
Roland, the son of a minister, manages to convey
hope, optimism and faith in his lyrics without sounding
preachy.
"1 wouldn't say that our music is particularly religious; it's
about having fun. But we like to have fun and have a spiritual
message, too," Evans said.
"Hints, Allegations, and Thing Left Unsaid" is a refreshing
album, striking a perfect balance between the extremes of
Nine Inch Nails' dark cynicism and George Michael's perkier
pop-style.
Collective Soul will appear with Aerosmith in the Bay Area
on Saturday. The band also expects to finish their next album
by the end of this year and to go on tour in Australia, Japan,
and Europe next year.

"Doesn't fame ever get to you?" 1 ask.

"It's a lot of fun, but I'd like
to hang on to the simpler
things in life, like my apart
ment and my dogs. Maybe I'll
get myself a wife, too."
"Where?" I ask. "On the
road?"
"Sure, at the end of every

Give me a word
Give rue a sign
Show me where to look
Tell me what will I find...
Oh, heaven let your light shine down...
the hit track from Collective Soul's
debut album "Hints, Allegations, and Things
Left Unsaid" (Atlantic), is an ironic combina
tion of lyrical picas for heavenly inspiration and
grungy guitar riffs. And judging from Collective
Soul's chart-topping success, heaven has indeed in
terceded by placing this quintet of rockers in the spot
light.
"Fame really bites you in the butt," drummer Shane
Evans says with a Southern drawl that reveals his Geor
gian roots. He is talking to me over the phone from his
hotel room in Houston, where Collective Soul is on tour. Al
though Evans and 1 talk about the routine interview topic
such as fame and the meaning of the band's music, he adroit
ly sets me at ease with his friendly and flirtatious manner.
"Success changes things. Of course, there's the
money. And it's great to go to McDonald's at home
and hear people say, 'Wow, that's Shane, he's from
Collective Soul' while before they'd say, There's
Shane. Why doesn't he go to college or get a real
job?' "
But success has been a long time in coming for
Collective Soul. The band spent a number of years try-

ing to get a record deal. They tried different styles of music,
different band names, but nothing seemed to work. In 1992,
frustrated by the lack of favorable response, Ed Roland, Col
lective Souls lead singer, dissolved the band and decided to try
a different tack — songwriting and publishing.
With the help of Evans — who refers to himself as "the
band's lowly drummer" — and Ross Childress, the lead gui
tarist, Roland finished up with his demos by spring of 1993.
"Shine" was one of the tracks that appeared on Roland's song
writing demos.
Originally plugged by a local college station in Atlanta, the
song caught on at radio stations everywhere. In short order,
"Hints" began selling out in local stores. Ironically, it was their
radio success that ultimately brought Collective Soul to the at
tention of Atlantic Records.
rhe members of Collective Soul seem to have come a
long way from the days as down-on-their-luck rock
ers. Presently, they are on tour as the opening band for
Aerosmith.
"It's cool," Evans says. "We get to play for sold-out shows.
Lots of people haven't heard of us yet, but the audience always
responds enthusiastically."
In their spare time, Collective Soul gains additional expo
sure by doing radio shows — "It's great, lots ol free I -shirts,
quips Evans.

"So you probably don't have to go shopping for clothes any
more," I say.
"Actually, we should have a tour-bus garage sale."
"Sure, you could sell those T-shirts tor a couple hundred
dollars."
"Yeah, I could hold this one up and say, 'I sweated in this
one last night,' " Evans says in his typical joking manner.
They continue to play small clubs, about which Evans says
the band is enthusiastic, since Collective Soul gets to play
longer and to feel closer to its audience.
The songs on "Hints, Allegations, and Things Left Unsaid"
range from pop ballads to alternative tunes to the heavier
sounds of hard rock. Evans says that what he likes about Col
lective Soul's music is that it can be both "alternative and
mainstream at the same time."
"We're alternative in the sense that we can be spontaneous
and try new things," he explains. "I think we're mainstream
because we can appeal to lots of different people and our lyrics
are straightforward."
JT ~T~ ints" is a solid album, its strength lying in the origi-
I t nality and uniqueness of each cut on the CD. lake
M M for instance, "Pretty Donna "an instrumental piece

performed by a full-string ensemble. On the other
end of the spectrum lies "Sister Don't Cry," a tune in
fluenced by gospel sounds.
Evans' heavy drums and Roland's gravelly growl give
an edge to "Breathe," while the sweeter-sounding,
f acoustic "Heaven's Already Here" hints at country-blues.
Finally, "Scream" is a piece of old-fashioned rock n roll.
Evans claims he has been most strongly influenced by
classic rockers like Led Zepplin and Black Sabbath.
Roland is a fan of everyone from Elton John to Michael
Penn, AC/DC to King's X.
"Of course, we all listened to the Beatles. But then
again, everyone says they were influenced by the Beat
les," Evans remarks with a laugh. As tor Southern music,
Evans says that they've certainly listened to Southern
bands and may have adopted similar styles in their songs,
but points out, "We're not Southern-fried."
The underlying characteristic of Collective Soul's music,
which unifies the seemingly divergent styles of the 13 tracks
on the album, is the message of spirituality in the lyrics.
For instance, Roland sings about his grandfather's
bout with leukemia in "Goodnight, Good Guy": "I'll break
the bread of a new day and wonder/ if faith will carry me
along/ but days are longer and my heart gets weaker, and/
1 can only stay so strong."
