# 'She sings so hard, she takes my breath away...'
## An evening at the Warfield with Sarah McLachlan One writer's perspective on the concert, the music and the voice 
### 
September 29. The Warfield Theater, San
Francisco.
The esoteric opening band, "Single <.inn
Theory," had almost finished by the
time I found a seat. I wove through the
floor section of the Warfield on the look out
for a gap in the crowd.
The floor was lined with packed cocktail
tables, the patrons busy scanning the menu
for a cheap way to heat the two-drink mini
mum. frowning waitresses bumped elbows
and chairs on their way through the crowd
while Single (iun I heory pranced to the end
of their spacey, pretentious set. I he guy next
to me ordered nachos and a gin and tonic.
The lights bla/ed up for the set change. I or
dered my first three-dollar (!oke.
:J would be Hie one to holdjjou down
kissjjou so lurd J'll take jour breath
away "Possession"
"Possession" appears twice on Sarah
McLachlan's newest release, "Fumbling To
wards Kcstasy." On the first version, her
lyrics, images of longing and aggression,
struggle above the menacing drum track and
the muted, buzzing guitar.
On the other, the quieter close to the
album, the same lyrics compete with only a
piano. In this version, the violence and des
peration in her words easily surface above the
music into an aching and unsettling lullaby.
And when she sings "I won't be denied" at the
end of the song, her voice rings out unguard
ed and soaring.

Both versions
have impact. But
they contrast in ex
pressions of musical
depth versus stark
minimalism. This is
McLachlan's trick:
this tension in her
music between
quiet and complexity

M hurt me more tluii J eivr could haw
imagined you made nuj world stand still...
- "Plenty"
Sarah Mcl achlan stood on the Warfield
stage between two large sheets of filmy cot
ton. She held the acoustic guitar that hung
across her body by the neck. I could barely see
the band members and backup singers be
hind the sheer drapes.
She played a few chords and began "Plen
ty" 112 rom her new album without backup. She
got through the first verse and then paused
and stage hands rushed out, tore the billow
ing drapes down and the band blared out the
next chord. It was loud, and we lost her gor
geous voice for just a second, but the specta
cle made up for it.
Covering the stage were manic, swerving
colored lights, three guitarists, a drummer
and a keyboardist. Standing above it all on a
platform was a waif of a soprano. The lights
lit up the audience and I saw people putting
their drinks down, leaning around each other
to see. Sarah went on playing her acoustic,
but I couldn't hear it anymore.

After the clamor was
over, she remained stand
ing, looking demure, even embarrassed, as if
she didn't mean to make such a loud noise.
"Thanks," she said, through the applause.
J will stare into the sun until its light
doesn't blind me... - "Jnto thelTire"
Sarah McLachlan was born in Halifax,
Nova Scotia in 1968, and 19 years later a five
record contract from Arista pulled her out of
art college and into a studio. "Touch," her
first album arrived in 1988, and brought her
popular attention, reaching (iold status in
Canada. Her second album, "Solace," drew
nearly unanimous acclaim and placed her in
the spotlight with comparisons to the likes of
Tori Amos and Kate Bush. I remember buy
ing that album myself on the strength of her
pop hit, "Into the l ire." It was the driving
chorus and funky bass of the song which
brought me in.
The rest of the album was a surprise: more
contemplative, moody, less instantly gratify
ing than "Into the Fire." She said that she
doesn't write singles, and "Solace" is proof.
The songs on her sophomore effort fade into
each other, strung along by the lushness of
her voice. I istening to that album is a drowsy
experience. In time 1 even stopped noticing
the pop interjection of "Into the I ire.'
That night at the Warfield, though, when
she played it — the whole stage lit up,
bleached in white light, like an overexposed
photograph.
'Hold on, hold on to yourself for this is
jonna hurt like he11... - '"Hold on"
I needed to go to the bathroom during
"The Path of Thorns," a mediocre song from
"Solace." My over-priced Coke had gone
straight through me, but I stayed. I was afraid
of missing the next song or one of her quirky
interludes. Farlier in the set she had intro
duced "Good Enough" by rejecting suspi
cions of male bashing. "I love penises," she
said with a laugh.
So, for fear of missing another comment
or introduction, 1 decided to wait it out,
crossing my legs resolutely. I noticed my
neighbor's spilt gin and tonic creeping to
wards me on the table. I tried to read my
watch in the dark.

After ecstatic ap
plause (apparently I
was the onlv one who

didn't like that song) she waited silently tor
one of her guitarists to switch to an acoustic
before she began the next song. The ensuing
"Hold On ripped out with a startling ag
gression. It sounded top-heavy, noisv and
caustic.
I he song describes the searching, helpless
emotion of a woman who discovers her lover
has AIDS. There is a fortifying hopelessness
in the lyrics, communicating compassion
and strength without sentiment. It is a
painful song despite McTachlan's stirring
vocal work, and the guitarist threw himself
into it, slashing at his acoustic relentlessly.
The bathroom forgotten, it took my breath
away.
Afterwards, I watched the guitarist flex
and shake his wrist experimentally, wincing a
little.

"Ice Cream' seems to stand out as a respite
on the album "112 umbling Towards Ecstasy."
Amid songs of disaffection, it comes along as
a message of happiness and hope. "Your love
is better than icecream / better than anything
else that I've tried. It moves along with a
ja/./y, jaunty up-tempo that sounds even
playful.
but then listen to the next track "Tear"
and its utter hopelessness. Tangled up in
your embrace / There's nothing I d like
better than to fa 11... It seems set as a con
trast to the buoyancy of "Ice ( ream." In
"Tear," something feels adrift and fragile.
McTachlan's vocals, usually the most solid
element in her songs, seem strung so high
and thin, so tenuous, they're like nothing
at all.
Now listen again to "Ice ( ream.' Its
brightness fails on second impression. "It's
a long way down, she croons mournfully
in the chorus. This time the song seems
caught up in the inevitability of heart
break.
"Ice ('ream" then seems coupled with
"Tear" in some meaningful, unexpected way.
Relationships in McLachlan's music center
around loss; love is neither a revelation nor an

antidote to loneli
ness. She told Bill
board magazine,
"I.ove is meant to
shine a light rather
than fix a gap;
that's the feeling I
wanted to achieve."

J helieiv this is lieaoen to no one else but
me and JII defend it as long as J can,.,
- "elsewhere"
McLachlan visited (Cambodia and Thai
land with a charity organization in 1993 after
touring for "Solace" for fourteen months.
She has taken inspiration tor her newest
album from Rilke's "Letters to a Young Poet."
She was included on Arista's AIDS benefit
album "No Alternative."
At the Warfield she hammered at her gui
tar violently.
She danced playfully back from the edge
of the stage during solos.
She called the crowd "nice" and then
changed her mind and called lis "fucking
brilliant."
■dli the fear has left me now J'in not
frightened anymore..,
- "Jumbling Towards tcstasu"

McLachlan once
said, "To work
through this stull
and conic out on the
other side. That's
the ecstasy."
1 is t en i 11 g
straight through
Mcl.achlan's latest
album i.in he an ex
hausting experi
ence. Romance is a
liability in her
music; relationships
are preambles to
loss and disillusion
ment — "What kind
ot love is this that
keeps me hanging
on despite every
thing it's doing to
me?" she asks on
"Circle." And from
"Ice" a touch of dis
tasteful sexuality
"You enter into me a
lie upon your lips /
offer vvli.it you can,
I'll take all that I can

get ... And disappointment on "Wait" —
"1 would not lei myself believe that you
would stray..
The last track, though, "fumbling In
wards Lcstasy" stands as a kind of reconcilia
tion, a quiet recapturing ol hope. This song
thrills by finding joy in the struggle lor love.
She doesn't reject the pitfalls of relationships;
instead, she validates their difficulties. "If I
shed a tear 1 won't cage it /1 won't fear love /
and it I feel a rage I won't deny it /1 won't tear
love." t here's something rewarding here in
the usefulness of desperation. "Peace in the
struggle to find peace / comfort on the way to
comfort."
McLachlan ended her second encore with
this song. I lie audience stood on their feet,
urging her to play more. The cocktail tables
and chairs in the front had been pushed back
to make room tor the people in the back
working their way forward.
I was still on a high from "Ice Cream." It
had been spare and quiet. Most of the band
had left the stage and I was glad. Her songs
had begun to feel too produced. Lasers and
overly enthusiastic synth loops had left me a
little tired. The simplicity of "Ice Cream"
served as a nice respite.
"Fumbling..." sounded great despite the
fact that I was a little distracted. She had
played for a long time, and I still had to go to
the bathroom, but the lyrics weren't lost on
me.
I ler voice is just so damn good. ■

had left the stage and I was glad. Her songs
had begun to feel too produced. Lasers and
overly enthusiastic synth loops had left me a
little tired. The simplicity of "Ice Cream"
served as a nice respite.
"Fumbling..." sounded great despite the
fact that I was a little distracted. She had
played for a long time, and I still had to go to
the bathroom, but the lyrics weren't lost on
me.
I ler voice is just so damn good. ■

September 29. The Warfield Theater, San
Francisco.
The esoteric opening band, "Single <.inn
Theory," had almost finished by the
time I found a seat. I wove through the
floor section of the Warfield on the look out
for a gap in the crowd.
The floor was lined with packed cocktail
tables, the patrons busy scanning the menu
for a cheap way to heat the two-drink mini
mum. frowning waitresses bumped elbows
and chairs on their way through the crowd
while Single (iun I heory pranced to the end
of their spacey, pretentious set. I he guy next
to me ordered nachos and a gin and tonic.
The lights bla/ed up for the set change. I or
dered my first three-dollar (!oke.
:J would be Hie one to holdjjou down
kissjjou so lurd J'll take jour breath
away "Possession"
"Possession" appears twice on Sarah
McLachlan's newest release, "Fumbling To
wards Kcstasy." On the first version, her
lyrics, images of longing and aggression,
struggle above the menacing drum track and
the muted, buzzing guitar.
On the other, the quieter close to the
album, the same lyrics compete with only a
piano. In this version, the violence and des
peration in her words easily surface above the
music into an aching and unsettling lullaby.
And when she sings "I won't be denied" at the
end of the song, her voice rings out unguard
ed and soaring.

Both versions
have impact. But
they contrast in ex
pressions of musical
depth versus stark
minimalism. This is
McLachlan's trick:
this tension in her
music between
quiet and complexity

M hurt me more tluii J eivr could haw
imagined you made nuj world stand still...
- "Plenty"
Sarah Mcl achlan stood on the Warfield
stage between two large sheets of filmy cot
ton. She held the acoustic guitar that hung
across her body by the neck. I could barely see
the band members and backup singers be
hind the sheer drapes.
She played a few chords and began "Plen
ty" 112 rom her new album without backup. She
got through the first verse and then paused
and stage hands rushed out, tore the billow
ing drapes down and the band blared out the
next chord. It was loud, and we lost her gor
geous voice for just a second, but the specta
cle made up for it.
Covering the stage were manic, swerving
colored lights, three guitarists, a drummer
and a keyboardist. Standing above it all on a
platform was a waif of a soprano. The lights
lit up the audience and I saw people putting
their drinks down, leaning around each other
to see. Sarah went on playing her acoustic,
but I couldn't hear it anymore.

After the clamor was
over, she remained stand
ing, looking demure, even embarrassed, as if
she didn't mean to make such a loud noise.
"Thanks," she said, through the applause.
J will stare into the sun until its light
doesn't blind me... - "Jnto thelTire"
Sarah McLachlan was born in Halifax,
Nova Scotia in 1968, and 19 years later a five
record contract from Arista pulled her out of
art college and into a studio. "Touch," her
first album arrived in 1988, and brought her
popular attention, reaching (iold status in
Canada. Her second album, "Solace," drew
nearly unanimous acclaim and placed her in
the spotlight with comparisons to the likes of
Tori Amos and Kate Bush. I remember buy
ing that album myself on the strength of her
pop hit, "Into the l ire." It was the driving
chorus and funky bass of the song which
brought me in.
The rest of the album was a surprise: more
contemplative, moody, less instantly gratify
ing than "Into the Fire." She said that she
doesn't write singles, and "Solace" is proof.
The songs on her sophomore effort fade into
each other, strung along by the lushness of
her voice. I istening to that album is a drowsy
experience. In time 1 even stopped noticing
the pop interjection of "Into the I ire.'
That night at the Warfield, though, when
she played it — the whole stage lit up,
bleached in white light, like an overexposed
photograph.
'Hold on, hold on to yourself for this is
jonna hurt like he11... - '"Hold on"
I needed to go to the bathroom during
"The Path of Thorns," a mediocre song from
"Solace." My over-priced Coke had gone
straight through me, but I stayed. I was afraid
of missing the next song or one of her quirky
interludes. Farlier in the set she had intro
duced "Good Enough" by rejecting suspi
cions of male bashing. "I love penises," she
said with a laugh.
So, for fear of missing another comment
or introduction, 1 decided to wait it out,
crossing my legs resolutely. I noticed my
neighbor's spilt gin and tonic creeping to
wards me on the table. I tried to read my
watch in the dark.

After ecstatic ap
plause (apparently I
was the onlv one who

didn't like that song) she waited silently tor
one of her guitarists to switch to an acoustic
before she began the next song. The ensuing
"Hold On ripped out with a startling ag
gression. It sounded top-heavy, noisv and
caustic.
I he song describes the searching, helpless
emotion of a woman who discovers her lover
has AIDS. There is a fortifying hopelessness
in the lyrics, communicating compassion
and strength without sentiment. It is a
painful song despite McTachlan's stirring
vocal work, and the guitarist threw himself
into it, slashing at his acoustic relentlessly.
The bathroom forgotten, it took my breath
away.
Afterwards, I watched the guitarist flex
and shake his wrist experimentally, wincing a
little.

"Ice Cream' seems to stand out as a respite
on the album "112 umbling Towards Ecstasy."
Amid songs of disaffection, it comes along as
a message of happiness and hope. "Your love
is better than icecream / better than anything
else that I've tried. It moves along with a
ja/./y, jaunty up-tempo that sounds even
playful.
but then listen to the next track "Tear"
and its utter hopelessness. Tangled up in
your embrace / There's nothing I d like
better than to fa 11... It seems set as a con
trast to the buoyancy of "Ice ( ream." In
"Tear," something feels adrift and fragile.
McTachlan's vocals, usually the most solid
element in her songs, seem strung so high
and thin, so tenuous, they're like nothing
at all.
Now listen again to "Ice ( ream.' Its
brightness fails on second impression. "It's
a long way down, she croons mournfully
in the chorus. This time the song seems
caught up in the inevitability of heart
break.
"Ice ('ream" then seems coupled with
"Tear" in some meaningful, unexpected way.
Relationships in McLachlan's music center
around loss; love is neither a revelation nor an

antidote to loneli
ness. She told Bill
board magazine,
"I.ove is meant to
shine a light rather
than fix a gap;
that's the feeling I
wanted to achieve."

J helieiv this is lieaoen to no one else but
me and JII defend it as long as J can,.,

McLachlan visited (Cambodia and Thai
land with a charity organization in 1993 after
touring for "Solace" for fourteen months.
She has taken inspiration tor her newest
album from Rilke's "Letters to a Young Poet."
She was included on Arista's AIDS benefit
album "No Alternative."
At the Warfield she hammered at her gui
tar violently.
She danced playfully back from the edge
of the stage during solos.
She called the crowd "nice" and then
changed her mind and called lis "fucking
brilliant."

The last track, though, "fumbling In

She doesn't reject the pitfalls of relationships;
instead, she validates their difficulties. "If I

the usefulness of desperation. "Peace in the

McLachlan ended her second encore with

struggle to find peace / comfort on the way to
comfort."
McLachlan ended her second encore with
this song. I lie audience stood on their feet,
urging her to play more. The cocktail tables
and chairs in the front had been pushed back
to make room tor the people in the back
working their way forward.
I was still on a high from "Ice Cream." It
had been spare and quiet. Most of the band
had left the stage and I was glad. Her songs
had begun to feel too produced. Lasers and
overly enthusiastic synth loops had left me a
little tired. The simplicity of "Ice Cream"
served as a nice respite.
"Fumbling..." sounded great despite the
fact that I was a little distracted. She had
played for a long time, and I still had to go to
the bathroom, but the lyrics weren't lost on
me.
I ler voice is just so damn good. ■

September 29. The Warfield Theater, San
Francisco.
The esoteric opening band, "Single <.inn
Theory," had almost finished by the
time I found a seat. I wove through the
floor section of the Warfield on the look out
for a gap in the crowd.
The floor was lined with packed cocktail
tables, the patrons busy scanning the menu
for a cheap way to heat the two-drink mini
mum. frowning waitresses bumped elbows
and chairs on their way through the crowd
while Single (iun I heory pranced to the end
of their spacey, pretentious set. I he guy next
to me ordered nachos and a gin and tonic.
The lights bla/ed up for the set change. I or
dered my first three-dollar (!oke.
:J would be Hie one to holdjjou down
kissjjou so lurd J'll take jour breath
away "Possession"
"Possession" appears twice on Sarah
McLachlan's newest release, "Fumbling To
wards Kcstasy." On the first version, her
lyrics, images of longing and aggression,
struggle above the menacing drum track and
the muted, buzzing guitar.
On the other, the quieter close to the
album, the same lyrics compete with only a
piano. In this version, the violence and des
peration in her words easily surface above the
music into an aching and unsettling lullaby.
And when she sings "I won't be denied" at the
end of the song, her voice rings out unguard
ed and soaring.

Both versions
have impact. But
they contrast in ex
pressions of musical
depth versus stark
minimalism. This is
McLachlan's trick:
this tension in her
music between
quiet and complexity

M hurt me more tluii J eivr could haw
imagined you made nuj world stand still...
- "Plenty"
Sarah Mcl achlan stood on the Warfield
stage between two large sheets of filmy cot
ton. She held the acoustic guitar that hung
across her body by the neck. I could barely see
the band members and backup singers be
hind the sheer drapes.
She played a few chords and began "Plen
ty" 112 rom her new album without backup. She
got through the first verse and then paused
and stage hands rushed out, tore the billow
ing drapes down and the band blared out the
next chord. It was loud, and we lost her gor
geous voice for just a second, but the specta
cle made up for it.
Covering the stage were manic, swerving
colored lights, three guitarists, a drummer
and a keyboardist. Standing above it all on a
platform was a waif of a soprano. The lights
lit up the audience and I saw people putting
their drinks down, leaning around each other
to see. Sarah went on playing her acoustic,
but I couldn't hear it anymore.

After the clamor was
over, she remained stand
ing, looking demure, even embarrassed, as if
she didn't mean to make such a loud noise.
"Thanks," she said, through the applause.
J will stare into the sun until its light
doesn't blind me... - "Jnto thelTire"
Sarah McLachlan was born in Halifax,
Nova Scotia in 1968, and 19 years later a five
record contract from Arista pulled her out of
art college and into a studio. "Touch," her
first album arrived in 1988, and brought her
popular attention, reaching (iold status in
Canada. Her second album, "Solace," drew
nearly unanimous acclaim and placed her in
the spotlight with comparisons to the likes of
Tori Amos and Kate Bush. I remember buy
ing that album myself on the strength of her
pop hit, "Into the l ire." It was the driving
chorus and funky bass of the song which
brought me in.
The rest of the album was a surprise: more
contemplative, moody, less instantly gratify
ing than "Into the Fire." She said that she
doesn't write singles, and "Solace" is proof.
The songs on her sophomore effort fade into
each other, strung along by the lushness of
her voice. I istening to that album is a drowsy
experience. In time 1 even stopped noticing
the pop interjection of "Into the I ire.'
That night at the Warfield, though, when
she played it — the whole stage lit up,
bleached in white light, like an overexposed
photograph.
'Hold on, hold on to yourself for this is
jonna hurt like he11... - '"Hold on"
I needed to go to the bathroom during
"The Path of Thorns," a mediocre song from
"Solace." My over-priced Coke had gone
straight through me, but I stayed. I was afraid
of missing the next song or one of her quirky
interludes. Farlier in the set she had intro
duced "Good Enough" by rejecting suspi
cions of male bashing. "I love penises," she
said with a laugh.
So, for fear of missing another comment
or introduction, 1 decided to wait it out,
crossing my legs resolutely. I noticed my
neighbor's spilt gin and tonic creeping to
wards me on the table. I tried to read my
watch in the dark.

After ecstatic ap
plause (apparently I
was the onlv one who

didn't like that song) she waited silently tor
one of her guitarists to switch to an acoustic
before she began the next song. The ensuing
"Hold On ripped out with a startling ag
gression. It sounded top-heavy, noisv and
caustic.
I he song describes the searching, helpless
emotion of a woman who discovers her lover
has AIDS. There is a fortifying hopelessness
in the lyrics, communicating compassion
and strength without sentiment. It is a
painful song despite McTachlan's stirring
vocal work, and the guitarist threw himself
into it, slashing at his acoustic relentlessly.
The bathroom forgotten, it took my breath
away.
Afterwards, I watched the guitarist flex
and shake his wrist experimentally, wincing a
little.

"Ice Cream' seems to stand out as a respite
on the album "112 umbling Towards Ecstasy."
Amid songs of disaffection, it comes along as
a message of happiness and hope. "Your love
is better than icecream / better than anything
else that I've tried. It moves along with a
ja/./y, jaunty up-tempo that sounds even
playful.
but then listen to the next track "Tear"
and its utter hopelessness. Tangled up in
your embrace / There's nothing I d like
better than to fa 11... It seems set as a con
trast to the buoyancy of "Ice ( ream." In
"Tear," something feels adrift and fragile.
McTachlan's vocals, usually the most solid
element in her songs, seem strung so high
and thin, so tenuous, they're like nothing
at all.
Now listen again to "Ice ( ream.' Its
brightness fails on second impression. "It's
a long way down, she croons mournfully
in the chorus. This time the song seems
caught up in the inevitability of heart
break.
"Ice ('ream" then seems coupled with
"Tear" in some meaningful, unexpected way.
Relationships in McLachlan's music center
around loss; love is neither a revelation nor an

antidote to loneli
ness. She told Bill
board magazine,
"I.ove is meant to
shine a light rather
than fix a gap;
that's the feeling I
wanted to achieve."

J helieiv this is lieaoen to no one else but
me and JII defend it as long as J can,.,
- "elsewhere"
McLachlan visited (Cambodia and Thai
land with a charity organization in 1993 after
touring for "Solace" for fourteen months.
She has taken inspiration tor her newest
album from Rilke's "Letters to a Young Poet."
She was included on Arista's AIDS benefit
album "No Alternative."
At the Warfield she hammered at her gui
tar violently.
She danced playfully back from the edge
of the stage during solos.
She called the crowd "nice" and then
changed her mind and called lis "fucking
brilliant."
■dli the fear has left me now J'in not
frightened anymore..,
- "Jumbling Towards tcstasu"

McLachlan once
said, "To work
through this stull
and conic out on the
other side. That's
the ecstasy."
1 is t en i 11 g
straight through
Mcl.achlan's latest
album i.in he an ex
hausting experi
ence. Romance is a
liability in her
music; relationships
are preambles to
loss and disillusion
ment — "What kind
ot love is this that
keeps me hanging
on despite every
thing it's doing to
me?" she asks on
"Circle." And from
"Ice" a touch of dis
tasteful sexuality
"You enter into me a
lie upon your lips /
offer vvli.it you can,
I'll take all that I can

get ... And disappointment on "Wait" —
"1 would not lei myself believe that you
would stray..
The last track, though, "fumbling In
wards Lcstasy" stands as a kind of reconcilia
tion, a quiet recapturing ol hope. This song
thrills by finding joy in the struggle lor love.
She doesn't reject the pitfalls of relationships;
instead, she validates their difficulties. "If I
shed a tear 1 won't cage it /1 won't fear love /
and it I feel a rage I won't deny it /1 won't tear
love." t here's something rewarding here in
the usefulness of desperation. "Peace in the
struggle to find peace / comfort on the way to
comfort."
McLachlan ended her second encore with
this song. I lie audience stood on their feet,
urging her to play more. The cocktail tables
and chairs in the front had been pushed back
