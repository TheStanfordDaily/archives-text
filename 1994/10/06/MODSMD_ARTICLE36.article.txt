A big, white space. Sometimes, everyone's Friday night can be
summed up with such a picture. No car? No cash? No friends? No
place to go?
Try a rental. But, instead of grabbing "Star Wars" or "When
Harry Met Sally" for the umpteenth time, how about a little cul
ture? Or, cult-culture at least?
Impress your friends. Startle your roommate. I )az/le your date
with your knowledge of movies everyone talks about, but no one
has really seen. Better yet, when everything's missing from the
"New Releases"

section, these se
lections will al
ways he waiting
for you in the

A little something different

"Classics" or "Foreign*' shelves.
•Cat on a Hot Tin Roof Yes, the Tennesse Williams play. But
get the old one, the one with Burl Ives as a powerful Big Daddy
and a young Paul Newman in the lead role as the alcoholic athlet
ic has-been with homoerotic tendencies. Williams' play-turned
film is a graphic illustration of a gritty, anti-C losby show life drip
ping with "mendacity."
Just remember, "Truth is paying your taxes, sleeping with the
same woman for forty years th.it you don't love, and only getting
your name in the paper when you die." Or something like that.
•Citizen Kane Widely considered one of greatest American
films ever made, "Citizen Kane" cemented Orson Well's status as
a landmark filmmaker. The story traces the history ot the Hearst
family and the answer to the question, "Who was Rosebud?'
•II Conformista — Before "l ittle Buddha" and " I'he l ast Em
peror," Bernardo Bertolucci made his filmmaking presence no
ticed with this allegorical mafia tale. The storyline is simple: Man
who is insecure about his masculinity gets tangled up with the
mafia, is ordered to murder a former professor, falls in love with
the professor's wife and much trouble ensues.
But watch "II Conformista" for the spectacular cinematogra
phy and absolutely stunning mastery of the filmmaking craft that
Bertolucci displays and never quite recaptures in his later pro
jects. Lighting master Vittorio Astorare proves why he and
Bertolucci are such a formidable combination.
•RAN — Yes it's in Japanese, but even if you're illiterate you no
doubt know Shakespeare's "King Lear," so just throw it in me
dieval Japan as opposed to England. The battle scenes are amaz
ing, the colors are stunning and the cinematography is breath
taking. 1 know, too many superlatives, but if you can sit still for
three hours, it's quite a treat.

•Brief Encounter — A surprisingly
small number of Americans have seen
this British World War 11 flick, which is
the "Casablanca" of every self-respecting
Englishperson's film vocabulary. Noel
Coward and company paint a poignant
and dramatic portrait of wartime extra
marital affairs.
Being the 1940s romance film that it
is, "Brief Encounter" gets a little over
bearing on the cheese factor once in a
while, but somehow, it all works out in
the end.
