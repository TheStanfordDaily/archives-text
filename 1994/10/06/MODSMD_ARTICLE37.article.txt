# Sleep with me
## : The real Generation X 
### 
We're young. We exist in
constant ennui. And we believe that

W a trio packs a meaner ode to love than a
duet. On the big screen these days, the con-

— - -p / '
temporary paradigm of relationships preaches nothing
but the geometry of the problematic triangle.
While "Reality Bites" and "Threesome" veer per
ilously close at times to overly self-conscious MTV aes
thetics, this latest exercise in Generation X-angst and
indecision is unafraid to parade protagonists who are
equally savvy in making conversation as they are at co
ordinating wardrobes.
In other words, Eric Stolz, Meg Tilly and Craig Shef
fer are good enough such that "Sleep With Me" avoids
coming across as an unintended spoof of "The Real
World." Indeed, their characters negotiate the treacher
ous tightrope stretched between friendship and love
with as much abandon and anxiety as those of us who
are honest enough to admit it.
Their crisis begins at the wedding of Sarah (Tilly)
and Joseph (Stolz), where his roommate in college,
Frank (Sheffer), discovers that his unspoken affections

for Sarah are in fact mutual. Once-buried stirrings of
unrealized passion now threaten to rip apart all pristine
pretensions of fraternal loyalty.
One high point of the movie — team-scripted by six
good pals, including director Rory Kelly — is the won
derful believability of its secondary characterizations,
particularly the wacky circle of friends among which
the trio of protagonists socially inhabit. As such, their

Sleep with Me

gatherings at each other's homes account tor most of
the story's action, complete with the razor-sharp ex
changes only possible among people whose quick
tongues give them no reason to be inhibited.
Brimming with offbeat pleasures like the uncontrived
use of quirky inter-titles to mark its narrative milestones,
the movie articulates the pitfalls of post-modern passion
with unbridled vivacity. Its somewhat-titillating title
notwithstanding, "Sleep With Me" extends an invitation
that would be a shame to refuse.
