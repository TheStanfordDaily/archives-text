# 'Jason's Lyric' snuffs out own potential
## 
### 
"Jason's Lyric" is like a cheap box of chocolates.
It looks really good on the surface, but when you take a
bite it's not as good as you thought.
"Lyric" is the latest in a long line of violent urban tales
that try to bring a romantic love story into the violent
world of the ghetto, or in this case, the "wards" of Hous
ton, Texas. The film begins with a loving father, Maddog
(Forrest Whitaker), playing with his two sons in a beauti
ful, wide open field. The scene is one of beauty and is in
deed quite touching.
However, the next glimpse of Maddog we get is post-

Jason's Lyric

Vietnam and the Maddog we knew and loved is now dis
abled and a bitter drunk. Whitakers ("The Crying Game,"
"Good Morning Vietnam") performance is sincere and
powerful,
Then, in a beautifully directed sequence of flashbacks,
we witness the tragic murder of Maddog at the hands of
his eldest son iason (Allen Payne).
The strength of the film lies in the Cain-and-Abel saga

that evolves after the murder. Jason becomes the guardian
angel of the family, always looking after his mother and
his oft-paroled brother Joshua (Bokeem Woodbine).
However, when Jada Pinkett ("The Inkwell") enters the
film as Jason's love interest, Lyric Greer, the film steadily
declines into what most would call "trashy."
The love story doesn't work for two main reasons.
First, Pinkett can't act. This shortfalling makes it hard for
any of screenwriter Bobby Smith's lines to be effective.
Second, Greer is portrayed as a morally stringent, self
respecting woman. To her peers, a prude, if you will. The
whole love story is one of chivalric courting and innocent
banter. Then, with a pan of the camera, Lyric and Jason
are buck naked and having sex in a manner that is not
only inconsistent with the nature of their courtship, but is
just tasteless as far as love scenes go.
The problem is that the film as a whole does not come
together. While the violent world of teens growing up in a
ghetto is accurately and emotionally portrayed, the
strengths of the film are dragged too far down by the
stomach-churning love story, which only leaves us with a
bad taste in our mouths.
