## Album shifts focus south of Seattle 
### 
Seattle isn't the capital of Washington state. And even with
tlie unprecedented indie lahel Suit Pop, the Kmerald
(aty may not be home to the state s most thriving punk scene.
Rather, both distinctions go seventy miles south to
Olympia, where the do-it-yourselfers roam free on the college
radiowaves, run their own labels and studios and hold punk
music love-ins. All this makes Olympia stand out as a roman
tic and mythical place to us on the outside looking in: music is
idealistic and political, a way of life that endures beyond fad
and fashion. Or perhaps it's life itself.
With its latest compilation, "Rock Stars Kill," homegrown
label Kill Rock Stars gives that glimpse into the indie ghetto
with 23 tracks from Olympia and non-Olympia punk won

dors. The tracks show off varied and sometimes-picturesque
soundscapes, featuring bands you may have heard of but have
never heard (Boredoms, Clod Is My Co-Pilot), a familiar face
(Sonic Youth's Kim (iordon and her project Free Kitten) and
hordes of obscure bands (Mukilteo fairies, Star Sign Scorpio).
"Rock Stars Kill is already ahead of the compilation pack,
it only because Helium and theSpinanes are in the line-up. Un-

fortunately, I lelium comes
up a bit short with their
contribution, a collabora
tion with something
known as The Bird of Par
adise, called "Puffin Stars."
The Boston trio's signature
stop-and-start dynamics

"Rock Stars Kill"
a compilation

and evocative instrumental work are present and accounted
for, but singer Mary Timony's chillingly detached voice is
muddled in the mix, rendering one of the band's most power
ful means of expression ineffective.
The Spinanes' offering, "Stupid Crazy," is more up to snuff,
matching up to their upbeat songs with Rebecca Gates' surly
guitar and Scott Ploufs distinctive drumming.
Of course, the compilation includes its fair share of clunk

ers, but there's always something to suit any taste just a few
tracks away. If the silly ska stylingson Rancid's "Brixton" annoy
you, just wait for 112 ree Kitten's frantic "Feed the Tree."
There's also a number of charmingly quirky songs littered
throughout, from Smog's twangy 10-ti folk on "37 Pushups" to
"Anatomically Correct" by (loci Is My Co-Pilot, a spoken
monologue backed by a wheezing saxaphone, on through
Fifth Column's groovy spookhouse instrumental "Detox
Killer."
The best is saved lor last, a simple girl-and-a-guitar tune
starring Bikini Kill's Kathleen llanna called "I Wish I Was
1 lim." At First, the song seems nothing more than a humorous
ditty about image and envy, with Fianna pining over some
indie hero's flannel shirts and "cool friends." But beyond her
superficial yearnings for free records and to understand Pave
ment songs, I lanna makes it clear all she wishes to be is herself.
So what it"he thinks he can be a girl better than |her|," that he
might be perfect?
"Rock Stars Kill'' stands as the best sort of compilation,
showcasing plenty of good bands making music that offers
wearied ears an alternative to the alternative. It might take a
more difficult, less trodden road to get there, but a visit to
Olympia is worth the trouble.
