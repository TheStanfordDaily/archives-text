# A 						boost for Bay babies
## Children's Hospital helps Fremont nursery 
### Jose J. Gutierrez Staff writer 
Hoping to improve its commit
ment to maternal patients and
their newborn children, Washing
ton Hospital in Fremont is joining
hands with Stanford's Lucile
Salter Packard Children's Hospi
tal to implement a new "level two"
nursery facility.
Currently there are no "level
two" nurseries — used to care for
newborns with minor medical
challenges such as prematurity —
in the Fremont area.
Steve Sowisky, senior policy
advisor at the Children's Hospi
tal, said discussion and planning
for the project has been ongoing
for the past year, and the nursery
is expected to become operational
in the spring of 1995.
The new nursery will be staffed
by a team of 10 to 12 physicians,
specialists and nurses from the
Children's Hospital, in collabora
tion with pediatricians from the

community, he said.
Nancy Farber, chief executive
of operations at Washington Hos
pital, said the hospital must focus
on developing the high-tech as
pect of its facility to better serve
the Tri-Cities area, which in
cludes Fremont, Newark and
Union City.
"We're not the little sleepy
community that we used to be 10
years ago," Farber said. "We serve
about 300,000 people and are pro
viding a service in a community
that can warrant a facility of this
sort."
Farber explained that new
borns are monitored in one of
three categories of nurseries ac
cording to the child's health sta
tus at birth.
"Level one" nurseries care for
healthy, normal babies born with
out complications, while "level
two" facilities handle those babies
who are not critically ill but have
problems like low birth weight.
"Level three" nurseries monitor
newborns who are critically ill
and in need of intensive care such
as respiratory aid.
Presently, "level two" children
must be transferred from Fre-

Mont to hospitals in Oakland or
Stanford to receive the special
ized treatment they need, said
Farber, adding that the commute
between cities is not only incon
venient but also costly.
"It's difficult, when a mother
wants to maintain a breast feed
ing relationship with her baby
during the early stages, to have to
commute out of town to do so,"
she said. "Also, many of these

families have children at home to
care for."
In addition, "they have to pay
bridge toll charges and find park
ing in areas they are not familiar
with. There is definitely a need
for a 'level two' nursery in this
community," she said.
Washington Hospital will
assume the cost of development
of the new center, which is esti
mated at $707,397, Farber said.
