# R.E.M.'s latest no 'Monster'
## 
### 
I lave you heard the R.H.M. countdown the
ory?
Loony as it may sound, some fans of the
Athens, Cia., super-group believe that the
band's most recent albums have been as
signed numbers in descending chronological
order. A "4" is clearly superimposed over the
"R" on the cover ol the l c >88 "tireen" album;
a case can he made for both three and two ap
pearing in obscure guise on 199Is "Out of
Time," and 1992 s "Automatic for the People"
contains a track called "New Orleans Instru
mental No. 1."

"Monster
R.E.M.

Then there's "Monster," the group's latest
offering, which doesn't quite seem like a zero,
but can't he called a 10 either.
The new album has a wide range of songs
and a definite sense of style, but at times it lacks
the heart of K.E.M.'s earlier efforts. Along with
solid rock-pop tunes such as "What's the Fre
quency, Kenneth?," the album contains some
interesting and unexpected explorations ot sex
appeal ("Crush with Eyeliner" and "Strange
Currencies"), as well as some real duds ("I
Took Your Name").
The group has abandoned the hugely suc
cessful studio sound of their last two albums in
order to produce good high energy vibes tor
their upcoming tour, and they deserve credit
for taking risks and coming up with an entire
ly new sound.
Nevertheless, in their determination to
produce an album for the stage, the band
seems to have risked few new stylistic ideas, re-

suiting in a somewhat Hat overall effect.
Inexplicably, the band has attempted to give
the album a looser sound by adopting slapdash
production values — allowing such unlikely
recording devices as a telephone and a hand
held tape player — and emphasizing guitar
feedback.
Those sound effects interfere with more
lyrical elements of the songs — especially to
ward the end of the CI). The new album's best
song, "l et Me In," would be just as haunting
without all the static in the guitar riffs.
besides, anyone who has heard the live B
side version of "Belong" knows that even
RT.M.'s most subdued songs can find a re
sponsive audience. If only the band had given
careful songwriting a chance to speak for it
self.
Michael Stipe's lyrics are as distinctive as
ever — sometimes incomprehensible and
obscure, sometimes direct and crystal clear
— but with an edge of sexual self-awareness
that hasn't been brought out to this extent
before.
I n the many appeals to a lover that he makes
on this album, Stipe adopts a tone of obses
sional control and inner vulnerability that sug
gests some sort of exploitation.
He uses a provocative metaphor to de
scribe an unhappy reunion in "Tongue":
"Caramel tongue on a dusty apology — it
crawls all over me." Another time, he asks his
dream lover, "Do you give good head? Am I
good in bed?"
The album as a whole is fitful and hard to
digest, but it should provide enough fodder,
when combined with top-notch stage design,
for a magnificent tour.
Oh, and as for that countdown theory —
check out the graphic that dominates the back
cover of the CI). It looks suspiciously like an
"0" to me.
