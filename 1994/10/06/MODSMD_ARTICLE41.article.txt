# Confident and defiant
## Sinead O'Connor's rage becomes quieter, more complex spins 
### 
It's not easy growing up in the public eye.
To have hundreds of stern parents and thou
sands of fickle friends who consider your least
slip-upor most minute contradiction as reason
to comment, congratulate, or castigate, is un-

Sinead O'Connor

doubted Iv a version of Dante's ninth circle of
hell.
Yet from the moment she baldly released her
first album seven years ago, this is precisely the
life that Sinead O'Connor, 27, has been leading.
Not an unlikely fate for a rising celebrity
who entreats an audience of millions to "fight

the real enemy" while ripping up a picture of
the Pope. It's just excruciatingly painful.
Knough to drive even the best of us to check

Musically speak

dexterity and grace.

The release of Sinead O'Connor's latest album, "Universal Mother," coincided with a
media blitz about the singer's fight with substance abuse.

cian — a far cry from the raw vocalist who ac
quired insta-fame for her banshee wail in
"Nothing Compares 2 U" — confident enough
to explore new musical rhythms and styles
while retaining a consistent thematic integrity.
So you listen to it once and you think, that's
a nice little album. You listen to it again and
hmm, you wonder if she hasn't somehow lost
something. Could motherhood have taken the
edge off of the banshee? You read the lyrics and
you think, no, the rage and the pain are certain
ly there, along with the searing poetry that at
tracted you to her music in the first place. No,
you conclude, it's all there, but...
And then it comes to you like a soft whisper in
the ear — it's not just all there, there's even more.
And, darn it, she is contradictory. She moves
from a song like "Fire on Babylon" with lines
like, "she's taken everything I liked/she's taken
every lover/and all along she gave me lies/just to
make me think I loved her," to a song titled
"John I Love You." In a similarly contradicting

pair, O'Connor contrasts "My Darling Child," a
beautifully sung lullaby accompanied by the
Irish Chamber Orchestra, with "Am I
Human?" a tiny tunc written and performed by
her seven-year-old son.
One of the most beautiful songs on the
whole CD is a cover of the late Kurt Cobain's
"All Apologies." Like a defiant manifesto,
O'Connor sings, "I wish I was like you/easily
amused/find my nest of salt/everything's my
fault." No matter how vulnerable she might
seem, she'll never be broken.
There is even a rap track on the album called
"{•'amine." And you know what? It's not bad.
On a whole, "Universal Mother" moves like
an epic poem. It takes you by the hand through
a naive utopic terrain of quiet maternal mo
ments, then drops you into the murky territory
of physical abuse and spiritual desecration,
only to lure you towards a curious sense of tri
umph and deep fulfillment. At times the album
may slip, but it never misses. O'Connor's musi
cal integrity is too developed for that.
And if her critics give her a hard time for it,
to hell with them.
