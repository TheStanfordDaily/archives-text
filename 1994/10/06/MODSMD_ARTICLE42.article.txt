# Jeff Buckley's soulful debut album captures the magic of his live music
## 
### 
Sitting in Sin-£ three years ago listening to
Jeff Buckley, I never thought that his musical
talent could be captured in a mass-mar
ketable medium. Playing live was part and
parcel of Buckley, and those who regularly
followed him around New York City felt his
presence whenever he crooned into the mi
crophone about love and lovesickness.
It was as if he performed with an intensi
ty that was meant for a small, intimate set
ting.
Yet, it is quite obvious that "Grace," Buck
ley's debut album, captures his emotion. To
gether with a new backup band, he fills out
an eclectic repertoire with a profound, if not
mercurial sound.
The album includes an ethereal, choirboy
version of Benjamin Britten's "Corpus
Christi Carol," and an original composition,
"Lover, You Should've Come Over" which
typify the musical intensity and diversity of

"Grace." Its soulful cadences undulate, dis
playing a vocal virtuosity akin to that of
Robert Plant or Freddie Mercury.
Of the remaining two covers (Leonard
Cohen's "Hallelujah" and James Shelton's
"Lilac Wine") and host of other originals,
Buckley's style spans the musical gamut,
from blues to folk to Middle Eastern to a
harder crash-and-burn rock.
The musical arrangements are inventive
and varied. "Grace" unfolds a full-bodied,
confluence of sounds — from conventional
guitar, bass and drums to tabla and dul
cimer ... plus, Jeff Buckley's amazing voice.
Except for "Eternal Life," which sounded
less packaged on Buckley's four-track solo
release "Live at Sin-£," "Grace" is an extraor
dinary first album. Buckley evinces a pas
sionate strength in his music that reinvents
itself with each song.
