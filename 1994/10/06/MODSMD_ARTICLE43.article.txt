Barcelona
Whit Stillman's new film "Barcelona
benefits from not only the witty
repartee of two American cousins
but also the cultural richness of the
Catalan capital, Barcelona. The
Cathedral of the old city serves as a
backdrop along with brightly lit

boulevards replete with "Trade Fair
girls" for two American cousins.
One, Fred, an ROTC Navy man, and
the other Ted, a sincere and ardent
yuppie obsessed with the culture of
sales, embark on a quest for ro
mance. Stillman's cerebral comedy
perhaps mirrors his own search. He
married a woman from Barcelona
and his two daughters were born
there.
Blue Sky
She a nympho, he's a nerd. Togeth
er, what are they? A married couple
who, between the two of them,
cause more controversy on the mili
tary bases they've inhabited than
the ongoing push for a nuclear-test
ing ban. Academy award-winning
actor Tommy Lee Jones stars in
"Blue Sky" as nuclear physicist
Hank, a soldier/scientist responsi
ble for measuring radiation levels at
U.S. Army nuclear test sites during
the heat of the Cold War. With crazy
characters and several dangling
subplots, "Blue Sky" tugs the audi
ence's attention just enough to
keep people in the theater. Yet
Rama Laurie Stagner and her co
writers seem to have tossed in more
conflicts than they can resolve.
Overall, it's not worth the price of
admission.

Eat Drink Man Woman
Ang Lee, director of last year's inter
national success "The Wedding
Banquet," serves up a delectable
new comedy of food, fatherhood,
fornication and filial relations. "Eat
Drink Man Woman" is a gourmet af
fair — a hearty feast for your eyes.
Filled with an abundance of sensa
tional Chinese dishes, this romantic
yet rueful celebration of basic
human desires reduces "Like Water
for Chocolate's" impassioned fies
tas to a traditional Weight Watcher's
meal plan. "Eat Drink Man Woman"
is a fulfilling banquet, both entertain
ing and heartwarming. Go with a big
appetite. Bon Appetit!
Quiz Show
Following in the footsteps of Oliver
Stone's "Natural Born Killers," Quiz
Show also examines the power of the
media. While Quiz Show doesn't rally
the American public behind vicious
mass-murderers, it does rap the
knuckles of the manipulative hands
of network television executives. The
film recreates many of the actual
events that entwined the lives of
Stempel (played by John Turturro),
Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes)
and Richard Goodwin (Rob Morrow)
in the late 1950'5. "Twenty-One,"
NBC's weekly quiz show, was inves

tigated in 1959 by a grand jury for
fraud, after which its findings were
sealed by a judge. The film attempts
to focus on the behind-the-scenes
manipulation of Twenty-One's pro
ducer Dan Enright (David Paymer)
Enright, driven by the power of ad
vertising dollars and the need to
compete with other shows, gives mil
lions of people a "friend" in Van
Doren, someone they can watch and
cheer along with in their own homes.
The River Wild
There's nothing like a good, not-so
old-fashioned heroine. Gail qualifies.
She's far from the weeping victim
common to so many action flicks, the
ones who dangle off mountains and
wait for some daring He-man to
come rescue them, who touch the
side of their eyes with a handkerchief
when dastardly villains have them in
their sights. Instead, Meryl Streep's
Gail is strong — so strong that she's
the one who paddles when she takes
her son and sort-of-nerdy, workaholic
husband rafting through a treacher
ous "River Wild." In"The River Wild,"
it's Streep's character and her innate
chemistry with son Roarke (Joseph
Mazzello, best known for facing
down the dinosaurs in "Jurassic
Park") that carry the film. When her
son accuses her of taking sides with

Dad against him, Gail matter-of-factly
replies, "I'm not on anybody's side.
I'm on everybody's side. I'm a moth
er." One lesson to be learned is that
the lighter the boat, the more likely it
is to survive the treacherous waters.
If that lesson is applied to film, maybe
the lack of plot is fortunate. Certainly
the strength of Streep's performance
is more than enough to keep the
boat from sinking.
Spanking the Monkey
"Spanking the Monkey" is a new film
about a rather old and serious
theme. This first movie from David
Russell powerfully captures a
muggy summer day exuding Oedi
pal tension and most disturbing in
cest. The film is both authentic and
convincing with a believable plot
and true-to-life dialogue. This is not
another one of those feel-good fami
ly films of the summer, but a bitter
sweet slice of American life that
most would rather avoid. Without
cliches and with humor, Russell
strikes a chord that brings to light
tension between a dysfunctional
family and the people that surround
it. This film includes attempted, but
unsuccessful suicide, self-loathing
and a dog with bad gums that en
joys long walks. "Spanking the Mon
key" is only for the intrepid.

another one of those feel-good fami
ly films of the summer, but a bitter
sweet slice of American life that
most would rather avoid. Without
cliches and with humor, Russell
strikes a chord that brings to light
tension between a dysfunctional
family and the people that surround
it. This film includes attempted, but
unsuccessful suicide, self-loathing
and a dog with bad gums that en
joys long walks. "Spanking the Mon
key" is only for the intrepid.
Barcelona
Whit Stillman's new film "Barcelona
benefits from not only the witty
repartee of two American cousins
but also the cultural richness of the
Catalan capital, Barcelona. The
Cathedral of the old city serves as a
backdrop along with brightly lit

boulevards replete with "Trade Fair
girls" for two American cousins.
One, Fred, an ROTC Navy man, and
the other Ted, a sincere and ardent
yuppie obsessed with the culture of
sales, embark on a quest for ro
mance. Stillman's cerebral comedy
perhaps mirrors his own search. He
married a woman from Barcelona
and his two daughters were born
there.
Blue Sky
She a nympho, he's a nerd. Togeth
er, what are they? A married couple
who, between the two of them,
cause more controversy on the mili
tary bases they've inhabited than
the ongoing push for a nuclear-test
ing ban. Academy award-winning
actor Tommy Lee Jones stars in
"Blue Sky" as nuclear physicist
Hank, a soldier/scientist responsi
ble for measuring radiation levels at
U.S. Army nuclear test sites during
the heat of the Cold War. With crazy
characters and several dangling
subplots, "Blue Sky" tugs the audi
ence's attention just enough to
keep people in the theater. Yet
Rama Laurie Stagner and her co
writers seem to have tossed in more
conflicts than they can resolve.
Overall, it's not worth the price of
admission.

Eat Drink Man Woman
Ang Lee, director of last year's inter
national success "The Wedding
Banquet," serves up a delectable
new comedy of food, fatherhood,
fornication and filial relations. "Eat
Drink Man Woman" is a gourmet af
fair — a hearty feast for your eyes.
Filled with an abundance of sensa
tional Chinese dishes, this romantic
yet rueful celebration of basic
human desires reduces "Like Water
for Chocolate's" impassioned fies
tas to a traditional Weight Watcher's
meal plan. "Eat Drink Man Woman"
is a fulfilling banquet, both entertain
ing and heartwarming. Go with a big
appetite. Bon Appetit!
Quiz Show
Following in the footsteps of Oliver
Stone's "Natural Born Killers," Quiz
Show also examines the power of the
media. While Quiz Show doesn't rally
the American public behind vicious
mass-murderers, it does rap the
knuckles of the manipulative hands
of network television executives. The
film recreates many of the actual
events that entwined the lives of
Stempel (played by John Turturro),
Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes)
and Richard Goodwin (Rob Morrow)
in the late 1950'5. "Twenty-One,"
NBC's weekly quiz show, was inves

tigated in 1959 by a grand jury for
fraud, after which its findings were
sealed by a judge. The film attempts
to focus on the behind-the-scenes
manipulation of Twenty-One's pro
ducer Dan Enright (David Paymer)
Enright, driven by the power of ad
vertising dollars and the need to
compete with other shows, gives mil
lions of people a "friend" in Van
Doren, someone they can watch and
cheer along with in their own homes.
The River Wild
There's nothing like a good, not-so
old-fashioned heroine. Gail qualifies.
She's far from the weeping victim
common to so many action flicks, the
ones who dangle off mountains and
wait for some daring He-man to
come rescue them, who touch the
side of their eyes with a handkerchief
when dastardly villains have them in
their sights. Instead, Meryl Streep's
Gail is strong — so strong that she's
the one who paddles when she takes
her son and sort-of-nerdy, workaholic
husband rafting through a treacher
ous "River Wild." In"The River Wild,"
it's Streep's character and her innate
chemistry with son Roarke (Joseph
Mazzello, best known for facing
down the dinosaurs in "Jurassic
Park") that carry the film. When her
son accuses her of taking sides with

Dad against him, Gail matter-of-factly
replies, "I'm not on anybody's side.
I'm on everybody's side. I'm a moth
er." One lesson to be learned is that
the lighter the boat, the more likely it
is to survive the treacherous waters.
If that lesson is applied to film, maybe
the lack of plot is fortunate. Certainly
the strength of Streep's performance
is more than enough to keep the
boat from sinking.
Spanking the Monkey
"Spanking the Monkey" is a new film
about a rather old and serious
theme. This first movie from David
Russell powerfully captures a
muggy summer day exuding Oedi
pal tension and most disturbing in
cest. The film is both authentic and
convincing with a believable plot
and true-to-life dialogue. This is not
another one of those feel-good fami
ly films of the summer, but a bitter
sweet slice of American life that
most would rather avoid. Without
cliches and with humor, Russell
strikes a chord that brings to light
tension between a dysfunctional
family and the people that surround
it. This film includes attempted, but
unsuccessful suicide, self-loathing
and a dog with bad gums that en
joys long walks. "Spanking the Mon
key" is only for the intrepid.
