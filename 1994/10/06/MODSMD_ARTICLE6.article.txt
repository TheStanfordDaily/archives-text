# Response to tea party revolt
## Task force to examine grad special fees 
### Jo Marshall Staff writer 
A year after a graduate student revolt against the
ASSU special-fee system, the formation of a task
force aimed at addressing the ailing system suggests
that their voices may have been heard.
Graduate student Karen Seta — one of the coor
dinators of last year's revolt — will be chairing the
task force assigned to study the ASSU's special-fee
system, said Council of Presidents member Mork
Murdock.
"Certainly in part it is a response to what was
voiced by graduate students last year," Murdock
said.
Last fall graduate students, dissatisfied with pay
ing fees they felt mostly benefited undergraduates,
formed the Graduate Student Tea Party to educate
students about the refund process. The process al
lows students to receive a refund of portions of their
special fee for student groups they don't want to
fund.
By demonstrating the importance of graduate
student special fees, the group hoped to pass the
Fair Funding Amendment — a proposed alteration
of the ASSU Constitution that would split special
fee votes into graduate and undergraduate divi
sions. This would then allow each population to de
cide separately whether to fund a group through
special fees.
Due to the large increase in graduate students
requesting refunds, special-fee refund rates in
creased dramatically last year — about 32 percent
fall quarter and about 39 percent winter quarter
compared to an average of 25 percent previous
years. The amendment, however, failed by 2 per
centage points.
Although the bill failed to pass, Seta said that she
is glad that something positive came from the initia
tive. She admitted the campaign wasn't the most
constructive way of drawing attention to graduate
issues but said she felt the campaign was the only
way to make "people sit up and take notice."
"The Tea Party last year was a reaction to the
Graduate Student Association getting voted [down
as a special fee during the previous year's General
Election] and also to make a statement. . . . We felt
that the best way to make an impact was to hit them
in their pocketbooks," she said.
Seta said neither she nor Michael Grant, her co
coordinator of the Tea Party, are actively planning
any more protests. However, Grant said conditions
could change as this spring's election approaches.
The task force presently consists of Seta, sen
ate chair Nawwar Kasrawi, two graduate sena
tors and two undergraduates. At the next senate
meeting Oct. 18, that body will elect two more
senators — one graduate and one undergraduate
— to serve on the task force.
