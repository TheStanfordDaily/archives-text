Graduate School of Busi
ness Prof. Alain C. Enthoven
will be presented Oct. 10 with
the first Clifton J. Latiolais
Honor Medal for his contribu
tions to managed health care.
The award honors En
thoven for his theory of man
aged competition, which pro
posed that competition among
health care provider organiza-

tions could lead to higher-quality and less ex
pensive care. The theory formed the basis of
many managed health care plans examined by
Congress this year.
"Dr. Enthoven was especially singled out for
his outstanding contributions to society and
managed health care in particular," said Den
nis Santo, chairman of the Latiolais Honor
Medal Committee, in a statement.
One of the founders of the Jackson Hole
Group, a think tank supporting managed com
petition, Enthoven has been called "the father
of health care reform." He advocates cost con
tainment and high quality care for patients.

"Enthoven started a multi-year campaign to
introduce managed competition which controls
cost while decreasing the amount of administra
tion involved in health care," said David Baron,
associate academic dean of the Business School.
"He has had much success within Congress in
getting managed care taken seriously, and also in
having it done in practice around the country."
Santo added that Enthoven "is clearly a
giant in the area of consumer-centered health
care, and is an authority on health care as it re
lates to economics and public policy."
