# Profs say DRs need overhaul
## 
### Scott Van Winkle Staff writer 
The highly anticipated recom
mendations of the Commission on
Undergraduate Education are
due next week, which may be just
in time for Stanford's distribu
tion requirements system — one
of the major reasons behind the
commission's creation.
More than a year after the
commission began its work, how
ever, professors continue to be
concerned about the DR system
— so much so that some are re
moving their courses from the list
of DRs.
Each academic department an
nually designates those classes
which it thinks should fulfill a
DR. A subcommittee of the Facul
ty Senate's Committee on Under
graduate Studies then approves
any new classes on the list, based
on the course syllabus and a ques
tionnaire filled out by the in
structing professor.
The departments' need to bal
ance "marketing" concerns with
academic rigor makes the DR sys
tem a "curious" one, History
Prof. John Rakove said.
Rakove submitted one of his
courses to be listed as a DR last
year, but the subcommittee did
not approve it. After a while, he
was invited to reapply, but he de
cided not to.
Aside from wanting students
to take his course "because they
want to take it," Rakove said he
was fed up with the entire system.
"DRs work to kind of maintain
a certain level of (student) de
mand," making them a kind of
tool to increase a department's in
fluence in the University, he said.
"The system depends on a good
faith wish on the part of faculty."
American Studies Prof.
Richard Gillam has also decided
to withdraw his class from the DR
list, though for different reasons,
he said.
The American Studies Pro
gram had grown so large that
there just wasn't room for the
additional students brought in by
DRs. Also, he said he needed
"flexibility" in planning a course
that might not cover all the spe
cific areas of the "American Cul
tures" requirement.
The DR system as a whole has
"become unwieldy," Gillam
added. "We've managed to gener
ate enough of these requirements
that it puts a heavy burden on
students," he said, causing many
students to put out minimal
effort in DR classes.
Despite such concerns over the
old system, some professors are
dubious that the Commission on
Undergraduate Education will be
able to bring about radical
change.
"If there were truly an obvious
solution, I think we would have
converged on it long ago," said
Chemistry Prof. John Brauman.
The University and its faculty
are committed to providing a
broad education to students, he
said. The problem is that since
1980, when the DR system was

adopted, the aims of the program
have proven virtually impossible
to implement.
"There's a great deal of sup
port for the general idea of DRs,"
Brauman said. "Students need to
have an education that's suffi
ciently structured . . . [so] that
they get exposure to areas they
might not otherwise [choose to
explore!."
Brauman said he suspects that
such goals are "compromised sub
stantially" by the wide range of
courses that satisfy DRs. He said
he would love for more students
to take his course — Chemistry
33, which satisfies the natural sci
ences DR — but that it simply
can't compete with "less ardu
ous" alternatives.
Classes with catchy names or a
less rigorous style soon become
"canonical" among students, he
said, limiting their response to
more sober introduction-level
classes. The chemistry depart
ment's attempts to draw stu
dents with such classes have
achieved only modest results, he
added.
Geology Prof. Gail Mahood,
who sees many DR students come
through her Geology 1 class, said
that the system works for her,
despite such concerns over stu
dents' seriousness.
"This course is definitely not
'Rock for Jocks,' " she said. "It's
an entree into science that many
students . . . would find appeal
ing."
