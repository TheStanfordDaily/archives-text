# Profs say DRs need overhaul
## 
### Scott Van Winkle Staff writer 
The highly anticipated recom
mendations of the Commission on
Undergraduate Education are
due next week, which may be just
in time for Stanford's distribu
tion requirements system — one
of the major reasons behind the
commission's creation.
More than a year after the
commission began its work, how
ever, professors continue to be
concerned about the DR system
— so much so that some are re
moving their courses from the list
of DRs.
Each academic department an
nually designates those classes
which it thinks should fulfill a
DR. A subcommittee of the Facul
ty Senate's Committee on Under
graduate Studies then approves
any new classes on the list, based
on the course syllabus and a ques
tionnaire filled out by the in
structing professor.
The departments' need to bal
ance "marketing" concerns with
academic rigor makes the DR sys
tem a "curious" one, History
Prof. John Rakove said.
Rakove submitted one of his
courses to be listed as a DR last
year, but the subcommittee did
not approve it. After a while, he
was invited to reapply, but he de
cided not to.
Aside from wanting students
to take his course "because they
want to take it," Rakove said he
was fed up with the entire system.
"DRs work to kind of maintain
a certain level of (student) de
mand," making them a kind of
tool to increase a department's in
fluence in the University, he said.
"The system depends on a good
faith wish on the part of faculty."
