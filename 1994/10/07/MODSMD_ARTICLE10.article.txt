# Feinstein, Huffington debate
## Two Stanford graduates spar on TV as Senate race heats up 
### 
(AP) â€” After months of hurling long
range bombs across the air waves, Sen
ate candidates Dianne Feinstein and
Mike Huffington sat inches apart yes
terday and fought hand-to-hand.
The Democratic Feinstein and
Republican Huffington snarled at each
other on CNN's "Larry King Live,"
bringing up few new issues but display
ing the depth of their animosity.
Miscarriages, attacks on religious
beliefs and simplification of issues were
the order of business. The debate was
about name-calling and mudslinging.
Feinstein emerged the likely winner,
largely because she referred authorita
tively to her long government record.
Huffington proved that he could be
shrill and ideological, and seemed to see
conspiracies everywhere.

When one caller from Los Angeles
asked Huffington why he lived in Texas
in the late 1980s while his wife gave
birth to their children in California,
Huffington replied by unfolding a piece
of paper.
"The Feinstein campaign sent out
four questions to people to ask," Huffin
gton said. "This is from her campaign."
"You answer the question," Fein
stein demanded.
"This is typical of a career politician
who wants to stay in office," Huffington
replied.
Then he launched a lengthy explana
tion about having to stay in Houston to
earn a living in the family oil and gas
business, while his wife stayed at their
home in California to be close to her
family. Arianna Huffimrton had suf

fered an earlier miscarriage, and he did
not want her commuting during subse
quent pregnancies, Huffington said.
Critics have contended Huffington
maintained his legal residence in Texas
to avoid higher California taxes.
"I can't believe you are using that,"
Huffington demanded of Feinstein.
"Have you ever lost a kid?"
Huffington also criticized Feinstein
and state Democratic Party Chair Bill
Press of dragging Arianna Huffington's
religious beliefs into the campaign.
"Did your campaign pass out this
stuff?" Huffington demanded.
"I am not part of any of it," Feinstein
replied.
But Huffington said Press had been
seen handing out infonnation on Arianna
Huffington's ties to a religious cult leader.
