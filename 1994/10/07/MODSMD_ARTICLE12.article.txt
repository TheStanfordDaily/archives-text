## Grading the faculty 
### 
Faculty, not students,
hold full responsibility
for fair, accurate grades

IN DISCUSSING THE year
ahead, Faculty Senate chair
Robert Simoni has said that the
senate will likely study students'
grades and grade distributions once
again, this time in an attempt to
curb grade inflation.
This comes in the wake of a
tumultuous spring when the senate
passed a new grading policy aimed
at changing a student's transcript
from a "record of achievement" to a
"historical transcript."
"If one thinks of grades as a kind
of language we use to communicate
... it is clear our vocabulary has lost
a lot of meaning" because of grade
inflation, said Geological and Envi
ronmental Sciences Prof. Gail
Mahood, who was at the forefront of
the movement to change the grad
ing policy last spring.
During the grading policy debate,
however, it often seemed that stu
dents were at fault for receiving the
grades they did — it was due more to
luck than to hard work or determi
nation if a student received an 'A.'
The attitude that the system need
ed change is understandable. But now,
to suggest undertaking a study of
grade inflation after the system has
been changed seems ridiculous.
There is a very simple solution to
grade inflation: if every professor
gives the grades he or she thinks his
or her students deserve, grade infla
tion will be minimized. There will be
students who will drop a class at the
end of the term and receive a 'W,'
but they will be few in number. Also,
fewer students will be retaking
classes because it will be recorded on
their transcripts.
Outside these few exceptions, the
only reason for grade inflation is
that the grades professors give are
too high. If every professor makes a
pledge to grade fairly, the problem

should be solved.
But it doesn't seem that easy. No
one seems to want to listen to the
argument that high grades are a
natural occurrence. Admissions at
Stanford and other prestigious uni
versities have become more compet
itive over the years. The average
SAT scores and grade point averages
of incoming freshmen has continued
to rise. It only makes sense that
these students would receive higher
grades. If faculty don't want to
believe that, the only people they
have to blame are themselves.
So maybe this new call to study
grade inflation is a cheap substitute
for a call for faculty to communicate
with one another and self-regulate.
With the new grading policy in
place, students will no longer
"cause" grade inflation by dropping
and retaking classes. It is time for
the faculty to put up or shut up. No
more studies, no more talk about
the problem of grade inflation —
either do something or stop making
students feel like the grades they
have worked hard for are a gift.
There is a growing tension
between faculty and students that
could prove to be very harmful if it is
not dealt with accordingly. The fac
ulty has a lot of shaping up to do
themselves. Syllabi need to be dis
tributed earlier, papers and exams
need to be returned promptly and
fair grades need to be given.
The faculty at Stanford are some
of the most successful academics in
the world. With doctorates from
Harvard, MIT and Stanford, it is
very easy for them to look down on
students and say that "everybody
gets an A." In fact, not everyone gets
an A, and those who do may very
well deserve it. It is time for the fac
ulty to start looking at themselves
and to try to understand where stu
dents are coming from. If a profes
sor feels he or she is giving out too
many A's, he or she alone has the
power to change that. So either it's
time for personal action from the
faculty or it's time to let the issue
die. Whatever happens, the faculty
should leave students out of it.
