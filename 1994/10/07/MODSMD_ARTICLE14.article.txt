## A 						peek into the windows of Building 10

ACT I. Introduction
to the Mysteries of
the Inner Quad.
Between the Classics
Department (Building 20,
currently unclassical
behind a cyclone fence)
and the Office of the Dean
of Humanities and Sci
ences (Building 1), lies the
Office of the President

and the Provost (Building 10). Such order
ing causes justifiable bewilderment for new
students first entering the Quad, particu
larly those hailing from linear New York or
Chicago. Fortunately, most students have
higher matters on their mind as they head
on the diagonal from Philosophy and
Human Existence (Building 90) to Master
pieces of American Literature (Building 50)
or on the straight and narrow from Human
Prehistory (Building 110) to Zen Buddhism
(Building 70). Fear not, freshmen, you will
figure it out quickly. And remember that
Memorial Church always serves as a reas
suring reference point. Mysteries of the
Outer Quad will be covered at a later date.
Act 11. Unlocking the Mysteries of
Building 10.
The title on the door promises the
"Office of the President and Office of the
Provost." Those who venture inside are
first greeted by the seemingly dour, gray
haired David Starr Jordan, Stanford's first
president (1891-1913), whose portrait
hangs next to the elegant 1905 grandfa
ther clock. Most students have a reason
able idea of what the role of Stanford's
President is (although a few have difficulty
with the spelling of Gerhard Casper, oflen
adding a't' after the'd' or replacing an 'e'
with an 'a').
The responsibilities of the Provost pre
sent more difficulty. Random House help
fully suggests the bailiff of a medieval
manor, but that's a little before Stanford's

time. In fact, the Provost is simply the
chief academic officer and, at Stanford, the
one to whom the deans of all seven schools
report.
The Provost also has an array of vice
provostial reports, three of whom are
housed on the crowded second floor of
Building 10: the Vice Provost and Dean of
Research and Graduate Policy, the Vice
Provost for Faculty Recruitment and
Development and the Vice Provost for
Institutional Planning and Financial
Affairs — brevity is not a consideration in
administrative titles. This trio of vice
provosts has as neighbors the Secretary to
the Board of Trustees, the Budget Direc
tor, and an Associate Provost for Facilities
Planning. Once the work spaces for the
indispensable support staff are added in,
no room is left on the second floor for
much more than the necessary copy
machine, the supplies room and the
"ladies" room.
Act 111. Responding to the Mysteries of
the Mail in Building 10.
Few students are seen on the second
floor of Building 10, but quite a number
find reason to come to the frequently
bustling first floor, which houses the Presi
dent, the Provost and their immediate
staff. One of these staff members collects
the daily mail — usually enough to fill one
carry-cart — from the post office. The let
ters include an interesting but relentless
set of invitations for both the President and
the Provost to appear at a variety of events:
student organizations; performances and
athletic events; faculty conferences; staff
meetings; alumni reunions; local city coun
cil gatherings; talks in Silicon Valley;
lunches with newspaper editorial boards;
discussions with the federal government;
dinners for major donors, etc. Despite the
President's willingness to accept as many
invitations as he can reasonably fit into a
24-hour day (and still do some thinking,

planning, writing and other essential work
for Stanford), the President's secretary last
year had to decline 317 invitations.
In addition to invitations and the pre
dictable sets of letters about academic
affairs, fundraising, facilities and legal
matters, the daily mail brings an amazing
array of requests for the President to
resolve some problem. Just since Orienta
tion, these requests have included: a par
ent complaining about his daughter's
experience with the advising system, a
developer wanting to establish a satellite
campus, an alumnus objecting to the
acquisition of the Allen Ginsberg papers, a
community member's appeal to protect
the ground-squirrel habitat near Palm
Drive, an overseas university seeking to
develop an academic exchange program, an
undergraduate complaining about his
housing, a staff member complaining
about another staff member's perfor
mance, a French couple requesting help in
renting a historical chateau, a faculty
member seeking help on a research project,
a VIP uncle appealing his niece's admis
sions decision, an author seeking guidance
in publishing a book on dyslexia, an alum
nus concerned that the Athletics Depart
ment is censoring the Stanford Band,
another alumnus objecting to Stanford's
"politically correct academic priests," a
graduate student complaining about the
treatment of animals in Stanford laborato
ries and local homeowners concerned
about the development of Sand Hill Road
(order unranked!). Every single one of
these writers expects — and receives — a
response.
So, when you've sorted out the geogra
phy of the Quad and identified Building 10,
write, call, or visit with those questions
unsuitable for the Science Bug. We'll try to
set you straight.

Chicago. Fortunately, most students have
higher matters on their mind as they head
on the diagonal from Philosophy and
Human Existence (Building 90) to Master
pieces of American Literature (Building 50)
or on the straight and narrow from Human
Prehistory (Building 110) to Zen Buddhism
(Building 70). Fear not, freshmen, you will
figure it out quickly. And remember that
Memorial Church always serves as a reas
suring reference point. Mysteries of the
Outer Quad will be covered at a later date.
Act 11. Unlocking the Mysteries of
Building 10.
The title on the door promises the
"Office of the President and Office of the
Provost." Those who venture inside are
first greeted by the seemingly dour, gray
haired David Starr Jordan, Stanford's first
president (1891-1913), whose portrait
hangs next to the elegant 1905 grandfa
ther clock. Most students have a reason
able idea of what the role of Stanford's
President is (although a few have difficulty
with the spelling of Gerhard Casper, oflen
adding a't' after the'd' or replacing an 'e'
with an 'a').
The responsibilities of the Provost pre
sent more difficulty. Random House help
fully suggests the bailiff of a medieval
manor, but that's a little before Stanford's

time. In fact, the Provost is simply the
chief academic officer and, at Stanford, the
one to whom the deans of all seven schools
report.
The Provost also has an array of vice
provostial reports, three of whom are
housed on the crowded second floor of
Building 10: the Vice Provost and Dean of
Research and Graduate Policy, the Vice
Provost for Faculty Recruitment and
Development and the Vice Provost for
Institutional Planning and Financial
Affairs — brevity is not a consideration in
administrative titles. This trio of vice
provosts has as neighbors the Secretary to
the Board of Trustees, the Budget Direc
tor, and an Associate Provost for Facilities
Planning. Once the work spaces for the
indispensable support staff are added in,
no room is left on the second floor for
much more than the necessary copy
machine, the supplies room and the
"ladies" room.
Act 111. Responding to the Mysteries of
the Mail in Building 10.
Few students are seen on the second
floor of Building 10, but quite a number
find reason to come to the frequently
bustling first floor, which houses the Presi
dent, the Provost and their immediate
staff. One of these staff members collects
the daily mail — usually enough to fill one
carry-cart — from the post office. The let
ters include an interesting but relentless
set of invitations for both the President and
the Provost to appear at a variety of events:
student organizations; performances and
athletic events; faculty conferences; staff
meetings; alumni reunions; local city coun
cil gatherings; talks in Silicon Valley;
lunches with newspaper editorial boards;
discussions with the federal government;
dinners for major donors, etc. Despite the
President's willingness to accept as many
invitations as he can reasonably fit into a
24-hour day (and still do some thinking,

planning, writing and other essential work
for Stanford), the President's secretary last
year had to decline 317 invitations.
In addition to invitations and the pre
dictable sets of letters about academic
affairs, fundraising, facilities and legal
matters, the daily mail brings an amazing
array of requests for the President to
resolve some problem. Just since Orienta
tion, these requests have included: a par
ent complaining about his daughter's
experience with the advising system, a
developer wanting to establish a satellite
campus, an alumnus objecting to the
acquisition of the Allen Ginsberg papers, a
community member's appeal to protect
the ground-squirrel habitat near Palm
Drive, an overseas university seeking to
develop an academic exchange program, an
undergraduate complaining about his
housing, a staff member complaining
about another staff member's perfor
mance, a French couple requesting help in
renting a historical chateau, a faculty
member seeking help on a research project,
a VIP uncle appealing his niece's admis
sions decision, an author seeking guidance
in publishing a book on dyslexia, an alum
nus concerned that the Athletics Depart
ment is censoring the Stanford Band,
another alumnus objecting to Stanford's
"politically correct academic priests," a
graduate student complaining about the
treatment of animals in Stanford laborato
ries and local homeowners concerned
about the development of Sand Hill Road
(order unranked!). Every single one of
these writers expects — and receives — a
response.
So, when you've sorted out the geogra
phy of the Quad and identified Building 10,
write, call, or visit with those questions
unsuitable for the Science Bug. We'll try to
set you straight.

Jean Fetter is Assistant to the President
