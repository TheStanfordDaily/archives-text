## Romania walks the tightrope of democracy 
### 
BUCHAREST, ROMANIA
I've just started writing, and already I've
come to a block. For the past month,
with help from a URO grant, I have
been doing research on freedom of the
press in the former communist country of
Romania. But now, when I try to set pen to
paper and describe my feelings about this
country, I find myself in a trap.
The pollution in the streets of
Bucharest and the seeming lack of com
mon courtesy from everyday people are
juxtaposed against the beautiful Carpathi
an Mountains and the amazing hospitality
you notice when you get to know the peo
ple and go into their homes. When a Roma
nian asks me the simple question of
whether I like Romania (as they often do),
I find myself stuttering over various pros
and cons and not quite ever coming up
with a definitive answer. The best one I can
give is that life is at the very least interest
ing, with change the only constant in the
everyday lives of post-revolutionary Roma
nians.
But although many changes have

occurred, in some ways things are much
the same. The downfall of Nicolae Ceaus
escu's Stalinist regime brought freedom in
many areas of life, yet the connections
forged by members of the former commu
nist apparatus served to help these former
elites become the main beneficiaries of
newborn capitalism. As one journalist I
spoke with explained, in communist times
the members of the Romanian nomen
klatura hid their wealth and privileges,
but now they have no need to be so dis
creet.
The newfound freedom in Romania was
followed in 1990 by a wave of political
interest. People would wait in line to buy
newspapers and would then buy several at
a time. Everyone was hungry to learn
about things which had previously been
seen only through the lens of the commu
nist party.
Yet now the excitement seems to be
dwindling. The press has shrunk rapidly
since 1990. That which has flourished is
the kind of sensationalist press which has
little to do with helping to develop a civil
society in a country where people have yet

to learn what it means to live in a democ
racy.
Even though freedom of the press exists
in Romania's constitution, real freedom is
somewhat more questionable. Constitu
tional guarantees for freedom of the press
were written in the communist constitu
tion as well. The government still has a
monopoly in the national system of distri
bution and controls the only newsprint fac
tory in the country. Through these devices,
newspapers can be manipulated economi
cally. And when prices have to be raised
due to costs of publication, even fewer peo
ple can afTord to buy them, and in a vicious
circle, circulation is driven down even fur
ther.
The most powerful form of mass media
is doing fine. The government still runs the
two state television channels, and it is
mandated by law that they will not be pri
vatized. In many of the more rural parts of
Romania, government-controlled televi
sion is the only access people have to what
is going on in national politics.
I am often asked by Romanians what
people in the United States think about

their country. I usually tell them that most
people couldn't find Romania on a map and
that about the only thing many Americans
know about it is Transylvania and Dracula
— a myth inspired by Romanian history. I
also tell them that because most people in
the United States believe the Cold War is
over and the United States won, there is
little interest in the former communist
states.
While the Cold War may have ended, a
kind of new Cold Civil War is emerging, to
use the phrase of a journalist I spoke with.
And in this new era, it is not so easy to
identify who is right or wrong, good or bad,
truthful or deceitful. There is a kind of
dual society between those who are profit
ing off the fruits of capitalism and those
who are doing worse than before.
Inflation is still rampant here — the
exchange rate has more than doubled from
a year ago — yet salaries often lag behind.
Many times the only way to make a real
profit is to bend the rules a bit. The bribes
and favors that were present under the
communist system have yet to entirely dis
appear.

The West must not turn its back on the
developing democracies in Central and
Eastern Europe, and the United States
must be especially vigilant to suppress its
isolationist tendencies in international pol
itics. It is in this critical transition period
that the West can provide assistance that
will help further the cause of democracy.
People often ask me where the Ameri
cans were 45 years ago when Romania was
given away to Russian influence at Yalta.
They tell me that they have been waiting
for the Americans all their lives, but they
never came. They are still waiting.

Burt, who is at Stanford in Moscow this
quarter, sends greetings and wants every
one to know he has only been sick once so
far (from Romanian wine and plum
brandy). This column is the first in a series
from Stanford Daily staff members abroad.
