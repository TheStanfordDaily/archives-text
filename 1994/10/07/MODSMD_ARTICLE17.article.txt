## Home vs. UCLA, USC Spikers ready to battle for Pac-10 lead 
### Seth Goldstein Staff writer 
Stultum est timere quod vitare
non potes.
It is foolish to fear that which
you cannot avoid.
Words spoken over two thou
sand years ago by Julius Caesar,
but ones that still hold value today.
The prospect of facing No. 11 USC
and No. 3 UCLA at 7 p.m. on con
secutive evenings this Friday and
Saturday at Maples Pavilion may
be a chilling one, but it is one that
the No. 1 Stanford women's volley
ball team has no choice but to bat
tle head on.
"We've hit the meaty part of our
schedule," said Stanford head
coach Don Shaw. "We've played 11
matches against pretty good
teams, but now we have to deal
with four of the top 15 teams in the
nation, in USC, UCLA and the Ari
zonas (next weekend). Now it's up
to us to find out where we are in
terms of our ability to deal with
such good opponents."
USC (9-2 overall, 3-1 in the
Pacific 10 Conference) features
two of the best middle blockers in
the nation — seniors Meika Wagn
er and Lauri Yust. Shaw described
Wagner as the quickest middle
blocker he has ever seen.
Yust is no slouch, either. She
leads the Pac-10 in blocks with 71.
Junior setter Monika Cavaliere is
avera <T ing 13 assists per game, sec

ond in the conference.
The Cardinal holds a 28-8 edge
in the all-time series with the Tro
jans. Despite dropping a three
game match last year in Los Ange
les, Stanford has won 11 of the last
12 matches and 16 in a row at
home.
However, Stanford has not been
as successful against UCLA (14-1,
4-0), a school that has become syn
onymous with women's volleyball.
The Bruins lead the all-time series
29-12 and beat the Cardinal three
times last season, including the
match that knocked Stanford out
of the NCAA tournament.
UCLA will be a major obstacle
again this year. Senior outside hit
ter Annett Buckner leads the con
ference in kills with an average
5.18 per game. Sophomore Kim
Krull, last year's Pac-10 Freshman
of the Year, and junior Alyson
Randick are the squad's talented
middle blockers. Krull is second in
the Pac-10 in blocks average, while
Randick is third in hitting percent
age with a .371 average.
"These are the quickest,
biggest, most athletic teams we've
seen so far this season," Shaw said.
"They're strongest in the middle,
but they can threaten from every
where."
As talented as these two squads
may be, neither has looked spectac
ular in Pac-10 play thus far, often

engaging in four or five-game
matches with teams the Cardinal
took in three. This fact is mislead
ing, however, according to Shaw.
"They don't have much depth.
They stick with only six or seven
players," he said. "And when one
or two of them have an off match,
they're going to lose a game here
and there. But the real fact is that
they won all those matches."
Being pushed to the edge can
have positive effects on a team.
According to Shaw, it gives them a
confident feeling and lets them
know that they have it in them to
come back.
"They've been tested," he said.
"We haven't been in that situation
yet. Maybe it's because we're deep
enough to avoid it, but it's some
thing that they have and we don't."
Playing the Los Angeles schools
may be the volleyball equivalent of
crossing the Rubicon, but the Car
dinal may be as brilliant a volley
ball team as Caesar was a general.
Stanford ranks first in the confer
ence in hitting percentage and hit
ting percentage defense. So while
the matches will be tough, the
team remains confident, if wary.
"We have to block well," Shaw
said. "Our blocking game is based
on position and timing and lately
it's been a little off."
Freshman blocker Barbara Ifeji
ka also felt that blocking was
important.

"We need to focus on our side of
the net," she said. "We have to con
centrate on ball control and block
ing to take them out of their
offense."

Ifejika and her fellow spikers
will definitely have their hands full
this weekend. As Shaw put it,
"We've been picked No. 1. Now, we
get to find ouf if we are No. 1."

However, Stanford has not been
as successful against UCLA (14-1,
4-0), a school that has become syn
onymous with women's volleyball.
The Bruins lead the all-time series
29-12 and beat the Cardinal three
times last season, including the
match that knocked Stanford out
of the NCAA tournament.
UCLA will be a major obstacle
again this year. Senior outside hit
ter Annett Buckner leads the con
ference in kills with an average
5.18 per game. Sophomore Kim
Krull, last year's Pac-10 Freshman
of the Year, and junior Alyson
Randick are the squad's talented
middle blockers. Krull is second in
the Pac-10 in blocks average, while
Randick is third in hitting percent
age with a .371 average.
"These are the quickest,
biggest, most athletic teams we've
seen so far this season," Shaw said.
"They're strongest in the middle,
but they can threaten from every
where."
As talented as these two squads
may be, neither has looked spectac
ular in Pac-10 play thus far, often

engaging in four or five-game
matches with teams the Cardinal
took in three. This fact is mislead
ing, however, according to Shaw.
"They don't have much depth.
They stick with only six or seven
players," he said. "And when one
or two of them have an off match,
they're going to lose a game here
and there. But the real fact is that
they won all those matches."
Being pushed to the edge can
have positive effects on a team.
According to Shaw, it gives them a
confident feeling and lets them
know that they have it in them to
come back.
"They've been tested," he said.
"We haven't been in that situation
yet. Maybe it's because we're deep
enough to avoid it, but it's some
thing that they have and we don't."
Playing the Los Angeles schools
may be the volleyball equivalent of
crossing the Rubicon, but the Car
dinal may be as brilliant a volley
ball team as Caesar was a general.
Stanford ranks first in the confer
ence in hitting percentage and hit
ting percentage defense. So while
the matches will be tough, the
team remains confident, if wary.
"We have to block well," Shaw
said. "Our blocking game is based
on position and timing and lately
it's been a little off."
Freshman blocker Barbara Ifeji
ka also felt that blocking was
important.

"We need to focus on our side of
the net," she said. "We have to con
centrate on ball control and block
ing to take them out of their
offense."

Ifejika and her fellow spikers
will definitely have their hands full
this weekend. As Shaw put it,
"We've been picked No. 1. Now, we
get to find ouf if we are No. 1."
