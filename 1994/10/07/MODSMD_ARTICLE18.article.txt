Most athletic coaches don't like to
make predictions.

However, Stanford men's water
polo coach Dante Dettamanti devised
a game plan as well as a prediction for
his No. 1 squad's match-up with No.
4 UCLA that ended up coming very
close to telling the story of the con
test.
"Before the game, I told them that
we have to start playing better
defense," Dettamanti said. "We want
to hold teams to seven goals or less.
Our offense should score 10 or more

goals."
Dettamanti knows his squad's
capabilities well, as the Cardinal
improved its season record to 13-1 by
defeating the Bruins (10-5) 13-7 at
deGuerre Pool yesterday.
The two teams played evenly
through the first quarter, with Stan
ford leading 3-1 at the period's end.
Senior Wolf Wigo nailed a two-point
shot to break an early 1-1 tie. Wigo,
the Cardinal's leading scorer, fuiished

the game with three goals to boost his
season total to 31.
After trading goals with the Bru
ins at the beginning of the second
quarter, Stanford's offense exploded
while the defense held tight. The Car
dinal went on a 7-0 run to break the
game open after UCLA had tied the
score at 4-4. The Bruins failed to
score over a period of ten and a half
minutes, as the Cardinal sealed the
contest by the end of the third period.
Leading Stanford's offensive attack
was senior Frank Schneider, who
found the net a career-high four times,
including three goals from the center
forward position.
"I feel really comfortable setting
against UCLA," Schneider said.
"Teams like USC and Cal have
stronger two-meter guards. Against
teams like UC-Santa Barbara and
UCLA, I feel I can go to a straight
power game."
The smaller Bruins team, which
focuses on quickness both offensively
and defensively, rotated defenders but
none were able to successfully guard
Schneider.
"I knew that if I got consecutive
sets, I would be getting my shots,"
Schneider said.
As has been the case with many of
Stanford's games this season, every
starter found the net at least once.
On the defensive end, the Cardinal
played up to Dettamanti's expecta
tions, limiting many of UCLA's goals
to times when Stanford committed
major fouls.
"The difference in the game was
clearly defense," Dettamanti said.

"Jack [Bowen] had a great game in
the goal."
The junior goaltender was
extremely active against the Bruins,
coming out of the goal to make sev

eral steals from the UCI-A holemen.
"We wanted to really concen
trate on defense today," Bowen
said. "We were really pressing the
wings tightly. It was mostly [sopho
more Dan] Lehoczky and (junior
Dan] Hancock over there — that
defense lets me come out (of the
goal). Any steals I make are because
of good defensive play."

The team defense was evident
throughout the game, as several
steals were made by Stanford play
ers crashing back to help a team
mate.
"The guys knew the importance
of this game," Dettamanti said.
"Every aspect of our game came
into play today and we did well in all
areas."
