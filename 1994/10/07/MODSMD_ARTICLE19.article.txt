# Today California, tomorrow the nation
## Women kickers look to complete sweep of California schools 
### Jeremy Stone Staff writer 
"California Dreaming" would be an
appropriate theme song for the Stan
ford's women's soccer squad, as it has
swept a five-game, three-week home
stand against intrastate rivals.
The Cardinal hopes to extend its
perfect record to 9-0 this Sunday
against the University of San Diego at
Maloney Field. The 3 p.m. contest will
be Stanford's last taste of the home
turf until Oct. 26, when San Francisco
comes to town.
Head coach lan Sawyers, who has
compiled a .900 winning percentage
(26-2-2) since taking over last season,
is trying to keep his team focused on
the 5-5 Toreros.
"We've got to make sure we don't
look ahead to North Carolina and
Duke," said Sawyers, whose team will
play against the Tar Heels and Blue
Devils in the Texas Adidas/Chevron
Tournament on Oct. 14-16. "I don't
think [looking past San Diego] will be
a problem. We've done a very good job
of organizing from game to game."
While only .500 overall, San Diego
has recently shown signs of promise.
In the Toreros' last two outings, they
garnered a 3-2 victory over St. Mary's
(whom the Cardinal defeated Wednes
day), and a 4-0 overtime win at West
Coast Conference rival Loyola Mary
mount. The four overtime scores
against the Lions illustrate the poten
tial explosiveness of the San Diego

attack, which averages 2.3 goals per
contest.
Freshman forward/midfielder
Jenny Jonjegan paces the Toreros
with six goals on the season. She has
made an immediate impact since
arriving from San Francisco's St.
Ignatius High School. Jonjegan will
receive help from San Diego career
scoring leader Michele Kennedy, who
has seven assists in only six games in
1994.
The bulk of San Diego's experience
lies at fullback, where junior Dawn
Birdsall and junior Michelle Bush
have both played 41 games in their
collegiate careers. Birdsall also leads
the team in shots on goal, a rare dis
tinction for a fullback.
As goalkeeper, sophomore Allison
Worden has seen the most playing
time. She has posted a 1.53 goals
against average in nine starts.
Sawyers believes the defense will be
the key, especially since the Cardinal
has never before played against San
Diego.
"They're a very tenacious team,"
Sawyers said. "They're obviously
going to play aggressive defense
against us as every team has this year
to try and shut us down. We're going
to have to try and get into our rhythm
while they're fighting to try and stop
us."
Bush and Birdsall will have the
task of containing sophomore forward
Erin Martin, whose two goals Wednes
day bring her season total to seven.

Martin and the Stanford offense have
fired nearly 23 shots per game, but
average an even three goals per con
test.
While not alarmed, Sawyers would
like to see more of those shots find the
net.
"We've got to start increasing our
percentages of finishing," Sawyers
said. "We're taking so many shots a
game, and I think our forwards are
anxious to reap the benefits of that."
Three goals per game have been
plenty for Stanford so far, as it has
allowed only three goals all year.
Senior goalkeeper Jennifer Poehler,
who has backed up Leslie Garrard for
three seasons, saw her career goals
against average drop to a minuscule
0.28. Garrard is steadily recovering
from a shoulder injury.
Freshman fullback Jen Royval was
the latest to join Poehler among the
Cardinal reserves who have stepped
up their performances. Royval's
tremendous defensive effort against
St. Mary's in her debut provides
Sawyers with yet another name to
think about when filling out the start
ing lineups.
"I think she's done a great job of
really putting her case forward,"
Sawyers said. "She's done everything
in her power to say, 'Coach, hey, you
should play me.'"
Royval would like to see more time
but will take it in stride.
"I hope so," she said. "But you
never know."
