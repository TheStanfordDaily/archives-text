# On to Arizona St.
## To win, Cardinal must shed media as well as tacklers 
### Greg Collins Staff writer 
After three Super Bowl victo
ries, three bowl victories and
numerous coach of the year
awards, has football genius Bill
Walsh finally been caught with his
pants down?
According to Walsh, the answer
is an emphatic "no."
During Tuesday's press confer
ence, Walsh struck back at the
local press for its coverage of
sophomore Eliel Swinton's com
ments regarding the team's leader
ship and emotion following the loss
to Arizona.
"Some of this stuff is laughable,
this stuff of chaos on our team,"
Walsh said. "I would have to drop
off way down, I mean you guys
would have to see me up here with
my pants unzipped — forgetting to
zip them up — before I would go so
far down as a coach that this pro
gram would be in chaos. I don't
think that is a problem. It is behind
us."
Starting as an admission of his
guilt and a laying "bare of my own
soul" behind the collapse of the
program, Walsh's five-minute dia
tribe fmallv broke down and his

cutting wit took control. Talking of
the "blockbuster revelations"
which had surfaced, he sarcastical
ly compared the work of the press
to the investigative reporting of
"Siskel and Ebert, no, who were
the guys on Watergate, [Wood
ward! and Bernstein."
Walsh's threats of indecent
exposure aside, there is still a foot
ball game to be played Saturday.
Stanford (1-2-1, 0-1 in Pacific 10
Conference) journeys to Arizona
State (1-3,1-1) for the first of seven
straight conference games for the
Cardinal.
"I ASU has] always been a major
problem for Stanford," Walsh said.
"Typically a faster team, they've
found a way to make the big play
against us."
Due to the rash of Cardinal
injuries, Walsh will start a fourth
different offensive backfield in five
games. Sophomore Quincy Jacobs
will get the starting nod at running
back, along with sophomore Adam
Salina at fullback. Sophomore
Mike Mitchell and freshman
Anthony Bookman are both nurs
ing injured ankles. Junior John
Sims, a back-up fullback, has a
thigh bruise and is most likely out,
also.
Injuries have also shifted the
defensive lineup, with sophomore
linebacker Brian Batson most like
ly out for the year after suffering a
broken right fibula against Notre
Dame last weekend.
Defensive coordinator Fred
vonAppen has tabbed freshman
Jon Haskins to start in Batson's
place, but Walsh also expects
senior Nate Olsen to see playing
time at that position. Swinton,
who started the first three games
of the season at cornerback, may
not play due to a hip flexor and a
strained quadricep.
The trip to Arizona State marks

the beginning of a "second season"
for the Cardinal as it moves on
from back-to-back losses to top 10
teams. Several key breaks have
gone against Stanford, but the
offense has shown what it is capa
ble of and there can be little doubt
that the defense is much improved
from last year.
"It takes breaks to win," said
senior tight end Tony Cline. "Last
year, players were just getting beat,
and this year it's just a couple of
mistakes and the other team gets
the momentum and beats us."
As for Arizona State, the Sun
Devils bring in a defense which
gives up points almost as fast as
the Cardinal. Surrendering just
over 28 points a game (compared to
32 for Stanford), the Sun Devils
are ranked eighth in the Pac-10 in
total defense, yielding 396 yards
per game.

Offensively, Arizona State is
still feeling the loss of All-Pac-10
performer Mario Bates, who
jumped to the NFL after last year.
Junior Chris Hopkins has filled in
adequately, but the Sun Devils lack
the big play potential of Bates.
An inconsistent running game
means that head coach Bruce Sny
der must focus the offense on
sophomore quarterback Jake
Plummer. Unfortunately for Sny
der, Plummer has yet to shine, as
Arizona State is averaging just
over 300 yards of total offense per
game, ninth in the Pac-10. Despite
this mediocre performance, he still
remains dangerous, according to
Walsh.
"He can move, he can avoid and
he's got a darn good arm," Walsh
said. "They get him outside with
the ball, which puts a lot more
pressure on everybody."
