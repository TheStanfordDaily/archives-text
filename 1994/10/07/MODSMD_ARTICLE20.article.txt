# On to Arizona St.
## To win, Cardinal must shed media as well as tacklers

After three Super Bowl victo
ries, three bowl victories and
numerous coach of the year
awards, has football genius Bill
Walsh finally been caught with his
pants down?
According to Walsh, the answer
is an emphatic "no."
During Tuesday's press confer
ence, Walsh struck back at the
local press for its coverage of
sophomore Eliel Swinton's com
ments regarding the team's leader
ship and emotion following the loss
to Arizona.
"Some of this stuff is laughable,
this stuff of chaos on our team,"
Walsh said. "I would have to drop

"Siskel and Ebert, no, who were
the guys on Watergate, [Wood
ward! and Bernstein."
Walsh's threats of indecent
exposure aside, there is still a foot
ball game to be played Saturday.
Stanford (1-2-1, 0-1 in Pacific 10
Conference) journeys to Arizona
State (1-3,1-1) for the first of seven
straight conference games for the
Cardinal.
"I ASU has] always been a major
problem for Stanford," Walsh said.
"Typically a faster team, they've
found a way to make the big play
against us."
Due to the rash of Cardinal
injuries, Walsh will start a fourth
different offensive backfield in five
games. Sophomore Quincy Jacobs
will get the starting nod at running
back, along with sophomore Adam
Salina at fullback. Sophomore
Mike Mitchell and freshman
Anthony Bookman are both nurs
ing injured ankles. Junior John
Sims, a back-up fullback, has a
