He's perhaps one of the most
recognized faces on campus, yet few
of us know him by name. He's N.B.
Hammond, long-time employee of
the Stanford Post Office and full
time sports fan. And neither rain,
sleet, snow, nor hail, can prevent
N.B. from delivering his package o'
predictions with me in the NCAA
games of the week:
Stanford at Arizona State
In the cheesy horror flicks of the
late '80s, you'll remember that the
bad guys never won. Nevertheless,
we fretted and worried throughout
each movie, expecting the worst.
So goes the scheme of my mind
when I ponder the Cardinal/Sun
Devil game on Saturday. As sure as
I am that Stanford simply cannot
lose, I still have recurring convic
tions that an ASU victory could
transform a mediocre Stanford sea
son into a dismal failure.
N.B. likes ASU in this one, pri
marily because of their air attack.
"They've got a quarterback who
can chuck the ball," he said.
Arizona State may be better this
season than in years of past, but
Stanford is coming off a respectable
performance against Notre Dame

(360 passing yards, 29 first downs)
and is prepared to restore it's shop
worn dignity. Besides, even the Sun
Devils can't revert the trend of
modern horror films — the mon
sters never win, especially when
they're as perpetually lousy at foot
ball as the Devils.
N.B. Hammond: ASU by 3
Reagan: Stanford by 7
UCLA at California
Had the English language not
developed from European dialects
over a thousand years ago, I'd think
that the word "choke" was first
used to describe the performance of
the 1994 UCLA football squad.
Unfortunately for the reeling Bru
ins, their last three games have
been so hideous there are literally
no words in the English dictionary
to describe them.
UCLA is 0-3 in its last three con
tests, having lost by margins of 21
or more and yielding 107 points in
the nightmarish manage & trois.
They scored 10 points in the last
two games, including a shut-out
against WSU two weeks ago.
Without J.J. Stokes, N.B. gives


UCLA little chance. I agree, and
you can give this game to our cross
bay rivals. In fact, don't be sur
prised if this "battle of the bears"
turns out to be a mauling.
N.B. Hammond: Cal by 14
Reagan: Cal by 6
Florida State at Miami
If the spineless Hurricanes are
so confident in their football abili
ties, why did they adjust their
schedule before the season so they
played pathetic Georgia Southern
at home before Washington to set
the record for most consecutive
home victories?
The Huskies snapped that 58-
game streak last week. Still, N.B.
insists that the team rated higher
in this contest perennially loses the
game. "I think the Hurricanes are a
little embarrassed by last week's
loss. They'll start a new streak

against the Seminoles."
N.B. likes the Hurricanes, but
I'd return that prediction to sender.
The demise of the Miami squad of
the late '80s/early '90s is almost
complete — a second-straight loss
in their coveted Orange Bowl
should transcend any remnants of
the past.
N.B. Hammond: Miami by 3
Reagan: Florida State by 7
Notre Dame at Boston College
Even Vegas isn't naive
enough to think BC can pull off
another miracle against the
Irish. Last year's 41-39 last-sec
ond victory may have cost Notre
Dame the championship, but the
Irish won big over the Eagles in
the teams' previous four encoun
ters.
It'll be Boston College again,
says N.B. "There are some teams
that just have a jinx over you. You
can beat everybody in the world and
still be scared to meet that one
team." Sure, without its two top
running backs, the Irish might be

slow on offense. But the Eagles'
Cinderella outfit of last year is get
ting old, and the dress is simply too
tattered and worn to impress any
body at this year's ball.
N.B. Hammond: BC by 3
Reagan: Notre Dame by 13
Oregon at Washington State
The Cougars deserted me last
week, regressing to the mediocrity
of previous years during their one
point loss to Tennessee. Oregon
shocked the world by proving they
can actually play some semblance of
modern-day football, when they
beat USC by 15.
N. 8., like myself, doesn't have
the guts to predict a second-straight
victory for an Oregon football
squad. Expect the superhero Ducks
of last week to fly the coop in Pull
man.
N.B. Hammond: WSU by 14
Reagan: WSU by 14
Last week:
Fred — 3 for 6
Reagan — 5 for 6
