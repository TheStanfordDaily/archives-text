He's perhaps one of the most
recognized faces on campus, yet few
of us know him by name. He's N.B.
Hammond, long-time employee of
the Stanford Post Office and full
time sports fan. And neither rain,
sleet, snow, nor hail, can prevent
N.B. from delivering his package o'
predictions with me in the NCAA
games of the week:
Stanford at Arizona State
In the cheesy horror flicks of the
late '80s, you'll remember that the
bad guys never won. Nevertheless,
we fretted and worried throughout
each movie, expecting the worst.
So goes the scheme of my mind
when I ponder the Cardinal/Sun
Devil game on Saturday. As sure as
I am that Stanford simply cannot
lose, I still have recurring convic
tions that an ASU victory could
transform a mediocre Stanford sea
son into a dismal failure.
N.B. likes ASU in this one, pri
marily because of their air attack.
"They've got a quarterback who
can chuck the ball," he said.
Arizona State may be better this
season than in years of past, but
Stanford is coming off a respectable
performance against Notre Dame

(360 passing yards, 29 first downs)
and is prepared to restore it's shop
worn dignity. Besides, even the Sun
Devils can't revert the trend of
modern horror films â€” the mon
sters never win, especially when
they're as perpetually lousy at foot
ball as the Devils.
N.B. Hammond: ASU by 3
Reagan: Stanford by 7
UCLA at California
Had the English language not
developed from European dialects
over a thousand years ago, I'd think
that the word "choke" was first
used to describe the performance of
the 1994 UCLA football squad.
Unfortunately for the reeling Bru
ins, their last three games have
been so hideous there are literally
no words in the English dictionary
to describe them.
UCLA is 0-3 in its last three con
tests, having lost by margins of 21
or more and yielding 107 points in
the nightmarish manage & trois.
They scored 10 points in the last
two games, including a shut-out
against WSU two weeks ago.
Without J.J. Stokes, N.B. gives
