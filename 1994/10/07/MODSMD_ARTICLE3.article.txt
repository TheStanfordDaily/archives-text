# Grade policy under fire
## Fac Sen chair Simoni defends new grading system to frustrated students 
### Li-Cheng J. Wang 
In the first public forum on the new
grading policy since its approval late
last year, Biology Prof, and Faculty
Senate Chair Robert Simoni defended
the policy's merits to students crowded
into the Ujamaa lounge last night.
Although Simoni declared that he
was not there "to defend the policy, just
to explain," he spent most of his time
debating several determined and skep
tical students.
The new grading policy — which

passed the Faculty Senate last June —
limits the ability of students to retake
and drop courses by denoting an "RP"
for repeated courses and a "W" for
withdrawn courses on students' tran
scripts.
Hot issues of contention at the
meeting included grade inflation, the
impact of student input in the policy's
formulation and the lack of freshman
notification about the changes.
Sophomore Victoria Pettibone
voiced the common concern that the re
strictive dropping policy would hurt

students' incentive to experiment with
classes.
Simoni responded that the new poli
cy balanced the need for focus and in
novation by "creating an incentive to
takes classes more seriously at the
start, instead of the end. "
He also noted that students still will
have until the fourth week of the quar
ter to change or drop courses without
penalty. He argued that by the fourth
week, "students can see if the classes fit
them and their intellectual goals, irre
spective of grades," and said that stu

dents who dropped courses past the
fourth week were "foolish, because the
effort will be wasted, and it compromis
es your (students') time."
While Simoni claimed that 40 per
cent of students in recent polls backed
the new grading policy, an informal
poll of the discussion participants by
Council of Presidents member Mork

and diversify their courses due to the

changes.
Several students said that
grades are a decisive factor in
their course selection process and
therefore, even slight policy alter
ations would have a restrictive
influence.
Sirnoni responded that this
"was purely cosmetic. One 'C' is
not going to foreclose any
options." In any case, Simoni said,
the obsession with grades is the
wrong criteria to use when decid
ing on classes.
Murdock and fellow COP
member Lisa Lee spoke about the
concurrent need for faculty
changes.
Lee asked Simoni if any action
was pending to force faculty mem
bers to be responsible to the stu
dents, to make them "less loose in
giving out [syllabi], assignments,
scheduling mid-terms and giving
back homework."
Simoni agreed that some
changes needed to be made, and
said proposals "will be in front of

the Faculty Senate by early next
year. The faculty does need to be
evaluated."
When pressed on specifics,
Simoni could only refer U) peer pres
sure and salaiy settings as major
tools for achieving faculty reform.
Simoni contended that the

"grading systems had begun to
collapse and the average grade
was close to an A-." Therefore,
graduate schools were devaluing
the Stanford transcript.
But he conceded that Stanford
grade inflation is "very similar to
other Ivy League schools."
