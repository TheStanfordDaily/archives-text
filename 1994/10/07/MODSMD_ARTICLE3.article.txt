# Grade policy under fire
## Fac Sen chair Simoni defends new grading system to frustrated students 
### Li-Cheng J. Wang 
In the first public forum on the new
grading policy since its approval late
last year, Biology Prof, and Faculty
Senate Chair Robert Simoni defended
the policy's merits to students crowded
into the Ujamaa lounge last night.
Although Simoni declared that he
was not there "to defend the policy, just
to explain," he spent most of his time
debating several determined and skep
tical students.
The new grading policy — which

passed the Faculty Senate last June —
limits the ability of students to retake
and drop courses by denoting an "RP"
for repeated courses and a "W" for
withdrawn courses on students' tran
scripts.
Hot issues of contention at the
meeting included grade inflation, the
impact of student input in the policy's
formulation and the lack of freshman
notification about the changes.
Sophomore Victoria Pettibone
voiced the common concern that the re
strictive dropping policy would hurt

students' incentive to experiment with
classes.
Simoni responded that the new poli
cy balanced the need for focus and in
novation by "creating an incentive to
takes classes more seriously at the
start, instead of the end. "
He also noted that students still will
have until the fourth week of the quar
ter to change or drop courses without
penalty. He argued that by the fourth
week, "students can see if the classes fit
them and their intellectual goals, irre
spective of grades," and said that stu

dents who dropped courses past the
fourth week were "foolish, because the
effort will be wasted, and it compromis
es your (students') time."
While Simoni claimed that 40 per
cent of students in recent polls backed
the new grading policy, an informal
poll of the discussion participants by
Council of Presidents member Mork
Murdock revealed that a clear majority
would be less likely to experiment with
and diversify their courses due to the
