# New course pivotal to Asian-American efforts
## 
### Emily Bazar Editorial staff 
Every war has a pivotal battle,
its own "Gettysburg" that can
change the course of history.
For some members of the
Asian-American community,
"Asian Americans and Immigra
tion Policy" — a new course of
fered though the American Stud
ies Program — is their victory at
Gettysburg. They see the course as
an important step in the creation
of a successful Asian-American
Studies Program.
American Studies 233 was a
joint response of the Law School
and the School of Humanities and
Sciences to student demand for
more Asian-American Studies
classes, said Assoc. Law Prof. Bill
Ong Hing, who is teaching the
course.
Citing a lack of faculty re
sources and course offerings in
Asian-American Studies, junior
Jerry Chen — a member of the
Asian-American Studies Commit
tee — said the class helps fill a hole

in the discipline's curriculum.
"The class is definitely a positive
step," he said. "Although it's far
short of the amount of classes we
want offered, it proves that student
voices do work."
Hing normally teaches immi
gration law and policy courses at
the Law School. But when history
Prof, and then Asst. Dean of Hu
manities and Sciences A 1 Camarillo
approached him last year to design
a course for undergraduates, the
Law School agreed to release Hing
part time during autumn quarter.
"It was my and the Law School's
effort to help respond to the need
for Asian-American Studies Cours
es," Hing said.
Students who rallied for more
Asian-American Studies courses
late last year see the new course
as a step in the right direction —
and as a potential model for fu
ture Asian-American Studies
classes.
The course will focus on immi
gration policies over the last 100
years in order to understand the
evolution and specific traits of cer
tain Asian-American communities,
Hing said.
"Today, with the exception of
Japanese Americans, where Asian
Americans live, what kind of jobs
they have and their gender ratios
are a direct relation to the immi
gration policies in effect over the
last 100 years," he said.
The course will examine a vari
ety of issues related to immigra
tion and investigate how policy
shapes the way individuals think
about themselves, he added. Voter
participation, educational perfor
mance and anti-Asian sentiment
will also be discussed.
The class is particularly timely
in light of recent political develop
ments focusing on immigration.
The topic is a contentious one,

having spurred both debate and
controversial legislation.
"The class is really relevant
now, especially with what's going
on now in California with Propo
sition 187," said Patty Tsai, a
master's student taking the class.
If passed, Proposition 187
would deny state services to illegal
immigrants. Hing sees the propo
sition as one in a string of recent
proposals aimed against immi
grants and hopes to analyze ori
gins of such sentiments.
Since "Asian Americans and
Immigration Policy" delves into
varied disciplines and topics, some
see it as a model course for the
Asian-American Studies Program.
If a comprehensive program is
instituted, students and adminis
trators alike would like it to con
sist of classes which appeal to var
ious students in interdisciplinary
subjects.
Camarillo said Hing's class is
an excellent opportunity for stu

dents not only because of its
Asian-American slant, but
because of its accessibility and
pertinence to all students.
He said the course has benefits
because it fits many interests
including Asian-American, politi
cal and immigration issues.
"The course benefits all stu
dents because it increases the cur
riculum for all undergraduates, not
only for Asian Americans," he said.
Chen said the course is a good
example of how Asian American
Studies can relate to several differ
ent programs because it charts "how
law affects culture and society."
But Camarillo stressed that if a
program in Asian American Studies
becomes it a reality, it must have
the potential to engage all members
of the student population.
"It might have particular
meaning for particular groups,
but it must add to the undergrad
uate curriculum in general," he
said.
