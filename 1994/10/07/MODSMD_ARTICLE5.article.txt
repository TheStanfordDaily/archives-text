# Survey shows most support honor code

### Frank Guinan Staff writer 
Despite recent doubts about the Honor
Code's effectiveness, a survey released yes
terday by the Judicial Affairs Office says that
close to 90 percent of the University's under
graduate population supports the code.
Fifty-five percent of the undergraduates
who filled out the survey said they strongly
believe in the Honor Code, while 35 percent
said they believe "it is a good idea." Only 1
percent said they felt it should be abolished.
"In general. .. what I've found so far is
strong support for the Honor Code, higher
than in any previous survey year," said Judi
cial Affairs Officer Sally Cole, pointing out
that only nine percent of undergraduate re
spondents said they would ignore an incident
of someone copying during an exam.
University President Gerhard Casper
asked the Student Conduct Legislative
Council to take a comprehensive look at the
Honor Code last fall after several widely pub
licized cheating incidents in March 1993. In

addition, the number of Honor Code viola
tions which received penalties doubled in the
1991-92 and 1992-93 academic years.
The survey was mailed to 2,000 randomly
selected students in early May, receiving a

Question: How strongly committed
are you to Stanford's Honor Code?
Michael Slemmer — Dally
42-percent response rate, with 397
undergraduates and 444 graduate
students returning the question
naire, according to graduate stu
dent Derek Miyahara, who served
as staff support for the SCLC last
year.
While the survey contained
questions which have been asked
on similar surveys at Stanford
and other universities, the SCLC
addressed some new topics as
well, such as student collabora
tion.
"There was a growing tendency
to look into group projects ... and
how (they] should be treated," said
Philosophy Prof. John Dupre, for
mer chair of the SCLC. "We felt
that it wasn't adequately discussed
in courses .. . and might have con

tributed to academic dishonesty,"
Dupre added.
According to the survey, more
than twice as many undergraduate
students today have collaborated
on an assignment, when the
instructor specifically required
individual work, than had done so
18 years ago.
"When students work so closely
with each other ... the individual
write-up is sometimes impossible
to distinguish," Cole said.
Of the undergraduates who
answered the survey, 30 percent
said they "sometimes" received
unclear instructions for acceptable
collaboration on assignments or
take-home exams, while 13 percent
said they "often" faced such situa
tions.
"There are more faculty mem
bers encouraging collaboration ...
and students are more enthusiastic
about collaborating," Cole said.
Forty percent of undergraduate

respondents said that in a group
setting, they "sometimes" worked
with group members who were
unclear on each person's individual
role.
"It is important to distinguish
between students who are valuing
collaboration from those who are
deliberately getting an unfair
advantage," Cole added. "We want
ed to fmd how faculty can assess
individual mastery. . . . SCLC
agreed it was an interesting focus
to take."
Many of the questions on the
survey are carry-over questions
from previous surveys, according
to Cole. This allowed the SCLC to
compare student attitudes to those
10 to 30 years ago.
In 1976, only 20 percent of
Stanford's undergraduates said
they were "strongly committed" to
the Honor Code. In a survey con
ducted eight years later, that num
ber rose to 42 percent. According to

last May's survey, that figure now
stands at 55 percent.
The percentage of undergradu
ates who admitted to using cheat
sheets during a test or exam rose
from nine to eleven percent
between 1990 and 1994. Mean
while, the figure for those who
admitted to copying from another
student during an exam remained
constant at 14 percent.
Although the degree to which
the respondent population repre
sents the student body has not yet
been verified, Miyahara said he
saw no reason that the survey
would be biased.
"It was a completely random
sample ... so I imagine we got a
pretty representative group," he
said.
The SCLC is an annually
appointed council composed of six
appointed faculty members and five
students, including the ASSU Sen
ate Chair and a member of the COP.
