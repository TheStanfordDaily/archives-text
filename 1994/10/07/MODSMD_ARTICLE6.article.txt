# Honor code in review
## After 73 years document virtually unchanged 
### Frank Guinan Staff writer 
Although attitudes about the Honor
Code have changed over the years, studies
and surveys about the 73-year-old docu
ment have changed the original statement
little.
The code says that students, individual
ly and collectively, will not "give or receive
aid in examinations" or in-class work. It
also holds students to the standard of tak
ing "an active part in seeing to it that oth
ers ... uphold the spirit and letter of the
Honor Code."
In 1961, a national survey was conduct
ed regarding scholastic honor codes, and
100 Stanford students participated. The
survey served as a "database" for questions
in future surveys, according to Judicial Af
fairs Officer Sallv Cole.

The next study of the Honor Code took
place in 1976 when then-University Presi
dent Richard Lyman asked the Student
Conduct Legislative Council — the Univer
sity body in charge of overseeing Honor
Code changes — to take a comprehensive
look at the code's effectiveness.
The study ended with the SCLC author
ing and adopting several guidelines and
specific interpretations "to assist students
and faculty in understanding their rights
and obligations under the University's
Honor Code."
Another survey was conducted in 1980
by the Honor Code Commission but yielded
no significant results. The 1984 survey pro
duced the most recent change to the Honor
Code, when the SCLC gave a clearer mean
ing of what "proctoring an exam" meant.
In 1990, another national sur
vey was conducted — with Stan
ford as one of 33 participating
schools. The survey was intended
to compare the levels of personal
honesty of students at schools
with an honor code and those at
schools without one. Stanford's
Honor Code, however, was not
affected by the survey.
Throughout all the surveys,

commonly asked questions
included those concerning the use
of "cheat sheets," copying during
an exam and collaborating on an
assignment.
Such common questions pro
vided data which could be used to
compare different time periods
and allowed the University to
contrast attitudes of students in
the past with those of the present,
Cole said.
"I don't think there's any
other school with this wealth of
historical information" on honor
code questions, she added.
