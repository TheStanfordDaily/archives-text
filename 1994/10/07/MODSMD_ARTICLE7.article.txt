# Car break-ins hit new high in September

If you've always thought Stanford seemed safe
enough to leave your car unlocked at night, think
again.
According to Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemey
er, 65 car break-ins were reported during the month
of September, compared with only 60 between Janu
ary and July of this year.
"They're hammering us," he said, adding that the
thefts have occurred "all over the place — from Es-

condido Village to Governor's Cor
ner ... wherever there are large
numbers of cars."
After the rash of car break-ins
this past month, Niemeyer is recom
mending that students take care not
to leave valuables in their cars and, if
possible, take precautionary mea
sures like buying a car alarm.
"Most of the vehicles have been
locked ... the biggest deterrent is a
bier nnHihlp nlnrm " hp qju'H "Whpri

they hear [the alarm] they go running."
Though there have been some auto thefts on cam
pus, Niemeyer stressed that the recent burglaries
have been limited mostly to such items as car stereos.
"We've had problems like this before," he said.
"They take whatever's valuable. ... These are hand
to-nose characters."
The police have not apprehended any suspects in
this string of burglaries, but Niemeyer said they have
found partial fingerprints at some of the scenes. "But
a lot of the times, the prints we pick up are the vic
tim's," he noted.
In order to facilitate apprehending the burglars, he
suggested that students keep an eye out for suspicious
people on campus.
"Guys going down a line of cars looking in windows
— that's a clue," Niemeyer said. "If people see some
one doing that kind of thing, they should call us as
soon as possible."
This kind of burglary spree is not unprecedented.
According to Niemeyer, last year the police nabbed a
group of "San Jose crooks" for similar crimes.
