Cult deaths investigated
CHEIRY, Switzerland (AP)— Investi
gators struggled yesterday to explain the
mass deaths of 48 followers of the myste
rious Order of the Solar Tradition, amid
revelations that some victims had been
injected with a powerful drug and the
discovery of more bodies at a house in
Canada owned by cult leader Luc Jouret.
There was still no sign of Jouret, and
authorities said they did not know if he
was dead or alive.
Initial investigations suggested that
some of the cult members committed sui
cide, while others were murdered.
Police detained several past and pre
sent members of the cult for questioning
yesterday and launched an international
search for Jouret.
Documents showed that several of the

cult members were entangled in a dis
pute with the cult's leaders over money,
the investigating judge said.
Sex survey released
CHICAGO (AP) - The hotbed of sex
in America turns out to be the marriage
bed, according to a landmark study of the
nation's sexual habits released yesterday
by researchers at the University of
Chicago and the State University of New
York at Stony Brook.
The study, billed as America's most
comprehensive survey of sexual behavior,
debunks many popularly held notions on
who is doing what with whom.
Among other things, it found that
married people have better sex, and have
it more often, than single people who
don't live with a boyfriend or girlfriend.
