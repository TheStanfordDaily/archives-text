# Tired of inaction, students fight for rape prevention
## 
### Beth Berselli Senior staff writer 
Citing a long history of inaction, some
students are speaking out against the
University's alleged failure to protect
them from sexual assault and provide re
lated services.
In response to a 37-page paper writ
ten on the subject by second-year law
student Isabel Traugott, the University
has formed a new task force to study the
University's Policy on Sexual Assault.
This move follows in the wake of last
week's temporary closure of the Sexual
Assault Resource Center and the elimi
nation of a full-time sexual assault pre
vention educator position — both the re
sult of insufficient funds.
The center's money troubles arose
last spring, when students failed to ap
prove the special-fee request for the

Coalition Against Sexual Assault, which
funded a variety of campus sexual-as
sault programs including the resource
center and the Orientation program
"Sex in the '905."
The loss of the coalition's special fee is
just the latest, however, in nearly a half
decade of setbacks to sexual assault pre
vention dealt both by the students and
the administration.
Taking action to reverse the tide,
Traugott — also the founder of Sexual
Assault Legal Advocates — wrote a
paper last year charging that the Univer
sity is in violation of the Ramstad
Amendment of the Higher Education
Act of 1992 because its sexual assault
policy doesn't provide students with suf
ficient information about options and
available resources.
Saying that Traugott's paper served
as an "impetus," Vice Provost and Dean

for Student Affairs Mary Edmonds said
the task force will examine the viability
of the University's Policy on Sexual As
sault since the Ramstad Amendment
went into effect in September 1993.
The amendment requires universities
receiving federal funding to include cer
tain data in their sexual assault policies,
such as information regarding preven
tion, education and response services,
Traugott said.
"We need to make sure that what we
have now is in compliance with the law,"
Edmonds said.
Formed during the summer, the task
force — composed of students and staff
— will also look at how well Stanford is
doing in terms of providing students
with information and resources about
sexual assault, Edmonds said, adding
that it will hold its first meeting
soon and should complete its rec
ommendations within the aca
demic year.
But as the task force begins its
work, the administration is left
with questions about whether the
University can deal effectively
with issues surrounding sexual
assault.
'Not students' responsibility'
Many students maintain that
responsibility for funding the Sex
ual Assault Resource Center, the
prevention educator position and
programs such as "Sex in the
'905," belongs with the University
and not the students.
Traugott said the creation of
the student-funded Sexual
Assault Legal Advocates in 1993
is a perfect example of how the
University has failed to fulfill its
responsibility as outlined in the
Ramstad Amendment.
The idea behind the organiza
tion was to train law students to
provide victims with legal advice
regarding sexual assault, she said.
But Traugott said this service
is not the students' responsibility,
but instead the University's.
"The University needs to . ..
provide this advice to students.
That's what the Ramstad Amend
ment requires them to do," she
said.
Gail Prichard, the coordinator
for the Campus Sexual Assault
Response and Recovery Team (C
-SARRT), said the University does
support providing these services,
as evidenced by the Office of Resi
dential Education's commitment
to "Sex in the '905."
"I have no doubt about the
level of commitment to it,"
Prichard said, although Res Ed
did not fund the program.
Stanford's existing sexual
assault policy — enacted in accor
dance with a 1991 California law
requiring universities to imple
ment such policies — puts the
University's commitment to pre
vention in writing.
But Traugott criticized the pol
icy, saying it violates the Ramstad
Amendment because it doesn't
provide sufficient information
about University services for sex

ual assault, and the little informa
tion that is provided in the policy
is "vague."
For example, although Stan
ford's policy lists C-SARRT as an
"emergency service available to
victims," it doesn't describe the
organization or what services it

provides, Traugott said.
"Most people don't know what
C-SARRT is," she said, adding
that she surveyed about 35 stu
dents last spring and "almost
nobody had heard of C-SARRT."
"The policy is very vague about
who you would contact for what,"
she said. "It doesn't notify students
about their options including where
to go and what to do if they're sexu
ally assaulted.... It's just this big
mystery to people. That indicates
what a big problem this is."
The policy also fails to inform
"the accused" about possible
penalties, she said.
Stanford 'far behind'
In addition to pointing out the
policy's shortcomings, Traugott
examined the services the Univer
sity offers students in the area of
sexual assault. In her paper,
Traugott argued that the Univer
sity's prevention, education and
response mechanisms are insuffi
cient.
She said Stanford "is pretty far
behind a lot of universities" in
terms of providing services for
students.
Senior Virginia Duplessis, trea
surer of the coalition, agreed that
Stanford probably provides fewer
services for students than a lot of

other universities.
"When [former Sexual Assault
Prevention Educator] Angelina
Cheney was still here, we proba
bly were about the same as other
schools, but now since her posi
tion has been eliminated, we've
regressed," Duplessis said.

The University used
a lot of 'delay-tactics'
such as forming
committees to study
the issues.

Because Cheney's position was
funded by the coalition's special
fee request, her last day of work
was Sept. 30.
Senior Angel Foster — director
of "Sex in the '90s" for the last
three years — said Brown Univer
sity is known for having an excel
lent sexual assault program.
Brown University offers stu
dents a Sexual Assault Peer Edu
cator Program, said Assoc. Dean
for Student Life Toby Simon.
About 80 to 100 students volun
teer to work in the program and
Simon serves as the program's
director, she said.
Brown also funds a mandatory
freshman Orientation program,
"Sex Without Consent: Implications
for Brown Students," Simon said.
In addition, five University
employees devote part of their
time to serve the Sexual Assault
Advocacy Program, which coun
sels victims.
For the last 18 years, Brown
has operated a "Women on Call"
program that acts as a rape-crisis
response team. Six university
employees devote part of their
time to that, Simon added.
In comparison, UC-Berkeley
funds two full-time health educa
tor positions who work in the
Rape Prevention Education Pro

gram, said Abby Rincon, one of
the health educators.
Also, students from the Peer
Education Group are trained to
deal with issues of sexual assault
and lead discussions around cam
pus, Rincon said. Students earn
academic credit for serving as
peer educators, she added.
A history of struggle
Students have repeatedly tried to
get the University to commit fund
ing for sexual assault programs and
positions, but have met with little
success, according to Susan Epstein,
a 1991 Stanford graduate who
served as the first Sexual Assault
Prevention Educator during the
1991-92 academic year.
The Sexual Assault Resource
Center was established in 1991
when the ASSU Senate approved
$45,000 in funding for sexual
assault prevention and education
on campus.
The original bill was meant to
compensate for the University's
inability to fund recommenda
tions of the 1990 Sexual Assault
Task Force. The ASSU committed
to funding the programs for one
year, with the understanding that
the University would then
assume financial responsibility.
Epstein said she met with for
mer University President Donald
Kennedy in the spring of 1991,
and he told her the University
would fund the Sexual Assault
Resource Office, "Sex in the '90s"
and weekend self-defense classes.
However, none of this funding
appeared, Epstein said. The Uni
versity used a lot of "delay-tac
tics" such as forming committees
to study the issues, she said.
The coalition sought a special
fee request in 1992. Students
approved special fees of $49,000 in
1992 and $52,280 in 1993 — which
were used to fund the sexual
assault prevention educator posi
tion, the Sexual Assault Resource
Center and "Sex in the '905."
Epstein — who is currently a
third-year law student at the Uni
versity of Chicago — said the spe
cial fee was always used as a "last
resort because we felt it was the
responsibility of the University to
fund the position and the center."
The University did commit to
funding a part-time position for a
coordinator of the Sexual Assault
Prevention Program in 1992.
However, Trace Shapiro — who

previously filled the half-time
position — left the University
when her term ended in August.
Interviews for the position will
begin this week and a new coordi
nator will be hired "as soon as
possible," Prichard said.
One student's solution
Considering that the main
problem with the University's
current services is a "lack of cohe
sion," Traugott said there needs
to be a clearly identifiable, central
structure independent from the
University and therefore free
from "a lot of University politics."
"The way it is now everybody's
operating by themselves as opposed
to together," she said. "The way
these services operate now is finan
cially ineffective because there's
overlap and contradiction."
In addition, there's a "weird
system of reporting," Traugott
said. For example, even though in

past years Stanford students have
paid for Cheney's salary and she
reported directly to the ASSU
Senate, Cheney was also account
able to Carol Pertofsky, director
of Cowell Student Health Cen
ter's Health Promotion Program,
Traugott said.
Centralizing the University's
services for sexual assault would
solve many of these problems,
Traugott said.
For her part, Prichard said she
believes the University should
look at what services it offers and
evaluate which ones are needed
most.
She said that, for example,
there may be less need for preven
tion services and instead more
need for the kinds of services pro
vided by Sexual Assault Legal
Advocates. "My hope is that we're
becoming more aware and our
needs are shifting to become more
sophisticated," Prichard said.

Interviews for the position will
begin this week and a new coordi
nator will be hired "as soon as
possible," Prichard said.
One student's solution
Considering that the main
problem with the University's
current services is a "lack of cohe
sion," Traugott said there needs
to be a clearly identifiable, central
structure independent from the
University and therefore free
from "a lot of University politics."
"The way it is now everybody's
operating by themselves as opposed
to together," she said. "The way
these services operate now is finan
cially ineffective because there's
overlap and contradiction."
In addition, there's a "weird
system of reporting," Traugott
said. For example, even though in

past years Stanford students have
paid for Cheney's salary and she
reported directly to the ASSU
Senate, Cheney was also account
able to Carol Pertofsky, director
of Cowell Student Health Cen
ter's Health Promotion Program,
Traugott said.
Centralizing the University's
services for sexual assault would
solve many of these problems,
Traugott said.
For her part, Prichard said she
believes the University should
look at what services it offers and
evaluate which ones are needed
most.
She said that, for example,
there may be less need for preven
tion services and instead more
need for the kinds of services pro
vided by Sexual Assault Legal
Advocates. "My hope is that we're
becoming more aware and our
needs are shifting to become more
sophisticated," Prichard said.

Citing a long history of inaction, some
students are speaking out against the
University's alleged failure to protect
them from sexual assault and provide re
lated services.
In response to a 37-page paper writ
ten on the subject by second-year law
student Isabel Traugott, the University
has formed a new task force to study the
University's Policy on Sexual Assault.
This move follows in the wake of last
week's temporary closure of the Sexual
Assault Resource Center and the elimi
nation of a full-time sexual assault pre
vention educator position — both the re
sult of insufficient funds.
The center's money troubles arose
last spring, when students failed to ap
prove the special-fee request for the

Coalition Against Sexual Assault, which
funded a variety of campus sexual-as
sault programs including the resource
center and the Orientation program
"Sex in the '905."
The loss of the coalition's special fee is
just the latest, however, in nearly a half
decade of setbacks to sexual assault pre
vention dealt both by the students and
the administration.
Taking action to reverse the tide,
Traugott — also the founder of Sexual
Assault Legal Advocates — wrote a
paper last year charging that the Univer
sity is in violation of the Ramstad
Amendment of the Higher Education
Act of 1992 because its sexual assault
policy doesn't provide students with suf
ficient information about options and
available resources.
Saying that Traugott's paper served
as an "impetus," Vice Provost and Dean

for Student Affairs Mary Edmonds said
the task force will examine the viability
of the University's Policy on Sexual As
sault since the Ramstad Amendment
went into effect in September 1993.
The amendment requires universities
receiving federal funding to include cer
tain data in their sexual assault policies,
such as information regarding preven
tion, education and response services,
Traugott said.
"We need to make sure that what we
have now is in compliance with the law,"
Edmonds said.
Formed during the summer, the task
force — composed of students and staff
— will also look at how well Stanford is
doing in terms of providing students
with information and resources about
sexual assault, Edmonds said, adding
that it will hold its first meeting
soon and should complete its rec
ommendations within the aca
demic year.
But as the task force begins its
work, the administration is left
with questions about whether the
University can deal effectively
with issues surrounding sexual
assault.
'Not students' responsibility'
Many students maintain that
responsibility for funding the Sex
ual Assault Resource Center, the
prevention educator position and
programs such as "Sex in the
'905," belongs with the University
and not the students.
Traugott said the creation of
the student-funded Sexual
Assault Legal Advocates in 1993
is a perfect example of how the
University has failed to fulfill its
responsibility as outlined in the
Ramstad Amendment.
The idea behind the organiza
tion was to train law students to
provide victims with legal advice
regarding sexual assault, she said.
But Traugott said this service
is not the students' responsibility,
but instead the University's.
"The University needs to . ..
provide this advice to students.
That's what the Ramstad Amend
ment requires them to do," she
said.
Gail Prichard, the coordinator
for the Campus Sexual Assault
Response and Recovery Team (C
-SARRT), said the University does
support providing these services,
as evidenced by the Office of Resi
dential Education's commitment
to "Sex in the '905."
"I have no doubt about the
level of commitment to it,"
Prichard said, although Res Ed
did not fund the program.
Stanford's existing sexual
assault policy — enacted in accor
dance with a 1991 California law
requiring universities to imple
ment such policies — puts the
University's commitment to pre
vention in writing.
But Traugott criticized the pol
icy, saying it violates the Ramstad
Amendment because it doesn't
provide sufficient information
about University services for sex

ual assault, and the little informa
tion that is provided in the policy
is "vague."
For example, although Stan
ford's policy lists C-SARRT as an
"emergency service available to
victims," it doesn't describe the
organization or what services it

provides, Traugott said.
"Most people don't know what
C-SARRT is," she said, adding
that she surveyed about 35 stu
dents last spring and "almost
nobody had heard of C-SARRT."
"The policy is very vague about
who you would contact for what,"
she said. "It doesn't notify students
about their options including where
to go and what to do if they're sexu
ally assaulted.... It's just this big
mystery to people. That indicates
what a big problem this is."
The policy also fails to inform
"the accused" about possible
penalties, she said.
Stanford 'far behind'
In addition to pointing out the
policy's shortcomings, Traugott
examined the services the Univer
sity offers students in the area of
sexual assault. In her paper,
Traugott argued that the Univer
sity's prevention, education and
response mechanisms are insuffi
cient.
She said Stanford "is pretty far
behind a lot of universities" in
terms of providing services for
students.
Senior Virginia Duplessis, trea
surer of the coalition, agreed that
Stanford probably provides fewer
services for students than a lot of

other universities.
"When [former Sexual Assault
Prevention Educator] Angelina
Cheney was still here, we proba
bly were about the same as other
schools, but now since her posi
tion has been eliminated, we've
regressed," Duplessis said.

The University used
a lot of 'delay-tactics'
such as forming
committees to study
the issues.

Because Cheney's position was
funded by the coalition's special
fee request, her last day of work
was Sept. 30.
Senior Angel Foster — director
of "Sex in the '90s" for the last
three years — said Brown Univer
sity is known for having an excel
lent sexual assault program.
Brown University offers stu
dents a Sexual Assault Peer Edu
cator Program, said Assoc. Dean
for Student Life Toby Simon.
About 80 to 100 students volun
teer to work in the program and
Simon serves as the program's
director, she said.
Brown also funds a mandatory
freshman Orientation program,
"Sex Without Consent: Implications
for Brown Students," Simon said.
In addition, five University
employees devote part of their
time to serve the Sexual Assault
Advocacy Program, which coun
sels victims.
For the last 18 years, Brown
has operated a "Women on Call"
program that acts as a rape-crisis
response team. Six university
employees devote part of their
time to that, Simon added.
In comparison, UC-Berkeley
funds two full-time health educa
tor positions who work in the
Rape Prevention Education Pro

gram, said Abby Rincon, one of
the health educators.
Also, students from the Peer
Education Group are trained to
deal with issues of sexual assault
and lead discussions around cam
pus, Rincon said. Students earn
academic credit for serving as
peer educators, she added.
A history of struggle
Students have repeatedly tried to
get the University to commit fund
ing for sexual assault programs and
positions, but have met with little
success, according to Susan Epstein,
a 1991 Stanford graduate who
served as the first Sexual Assault
Prevention Educator during the
1991-92 academic year.
The Sexual Assault Resource
Center was established in 1991
when the ASSU Senate approved
$45,000 in funding for sexual
assault prevention and education
on campus.
The original bill was meant to
compensate for the University's
inability to fund recommenda
tions of the 1990 Sexual Assault
Task Force. The ASSU committed
to funding the programs for one
year, with the understanding that
the University would then
assume financial responsibility.
Epstein said she met with for
mer University President Donald
Kennedy in the spring of 1991,
and he told her the University
would fund the Sexual Assault
Resource Office, "Sex in the '90s"
and weekend self-defense classes.
However, none of this funding
appeared, Epstein said. The Uni
versity used a lot of "delay-tac
tics" such as forming committees
to study the issues, she said.
The coalition sought a special
fee request in 1992. Students
approved special fees of $49,000 in
1992 and $52,280 in 1993 — which
were used to fund the sexual
assault prevention educator posi
tion, the Sexual Assault Resource
Center and "Sex in the '905."
Epstein — who is currently a
third-year law student at the Uni
versity of Chicago — said the spe
cial fee was always used as a "last
resort because we felt it was the
responsibility of the University to
fund the position and the center."
The University did commit to
funding a part-time position for a
coordinator of the Sexual Assault
Prevention Program in 1992.
However, Trace Shapiro — who

previously filled the half-time
position — left the University
when her term ended in August.
Interviews for the position will
begin this week and a new coordi
nator will be hired "as soon as
possible," Prichard said.

inability to fund recommenda
tions of the 1990 Sexual Assault
Task Force. The ASSU committed
to funding the programs for one
year, with the understanding that
the University would then
assume financial responsibility.
Epstein said she met with for
mer University President Donald
Kennedy in the spring of 1991,
and he told her the University
would fund the Sexual Assault
Resource Office, "Sex in the '90s"
and weekend self-defense classes.
However, none of this funding
appeared, Epstein said. The Uni
versity used a lot of "delay-tac
tics" such as forming committees
to study the issues, she said.
The coalition sought a special
fee request in 1992. Students
approved special fees of $49,000 in
1992 and $52,280 in 1993 — which
were used to fund the sexual
assault prevention educator posi
tion, the Sexual Assault Resource
Center and "Sex in the '905."
Epstein — who is currently a
third-year law student at the Uni
versity of Chicago — said the spe
cial fee was always used as a "last
resort because we felt it was the
responsibility of the University to
fund the position and the center."
The University did commit to
funding a part-time position for a
coordinator of the Sexual Assault
Prevention Program in 1992.
However, Trace Shapiro — who

previously filled the half-time
position — left the University
when her term ended in August.
Interviews for the position will
begin this week and a new coordi
nator will be hired "as soon as
possible," Prichard said.
One student's solution
Considering that the main
problem with the University's
current services is a "lack of cohe
sion," Traugott said there needs
to be a clearly identifiable, central
structure independent from the
University and therefore free
from "a lot of University politics."
"The way it is now everybody's
operating by themselves as opposed
to together," she said. "The way
these services operate now is finan
cially ineffective because there's
overlap and contradiction."
In addition, there's a "weird
system of reporting," Traugott
said. For example, even though in

past years Stanford students have
paid for Cheney's salary and she
reported directly to the ASSU
Senate, Cheney was also account
able to Carol Pertofsky, director
of Cowell Student Health Cen
ter's Health Promotion Program,
Traugott said.
Centralizing the University's
services for sexual assault would
solve many of these problems,
Traugott said.
For her part, Prichard said she
believes the University should
look at what services it offers and
evaluate which ones are needed
most.
She said that, for example,
there may be less need for preven
tion services and instead more
need for the kinds of services pro
vided by Sexual Assault Legal
Advocates. "My hope is that we're
becoming more aware and our
needs are shifting to become more
sophisticated," Prichard said.

Citing a long history of inaction, some
students are speaking out against the
University's alleged failure to protect
them from sexual assault and provide re
lated services.
In response to a 37-page paper writ
ten on the subject by second-year law
student Isabel Traugott, the University
has formed a new task force to study the
University's Policy on Sexual Assault.
This move follows in the wake of last
week's temporary closure of the Sexual
Assault Resource Center and the elimi
nation of a full-time sexual assault pre
vention educator position — both the re
sult of insufficient funds.
The center's money troubles arose
last spring, when students failed to ap
prove the special-fee request for the

Coalition Against Sexual Assault, which
funded a variety of campus sexual-as
sault programs including the resource
center and the Orientation program
"Sex in the '905."
The loss of the coalition's special fee is
just the latest, however, in nearly a half
decade of setbacks to sexual assault pre
vention dealt both by the students and
the administration.
Taking action to reverse the tide,
Traugott — also the founder of Sexual
Assault Legal Advocates — wrote a
paper last year charging that the Univer
sity is in violation of the Ramstad
Amendment of the Higher Education
Act of 1992 because its sexual assault
policy doesn't provide students with suf
ficient information about options and
available resources.
Saying that Traugott's paper served
as an "impetus," Vice Provost and Dean

for Student Affairs Mary Edmonds said
the task force will examine the viability
of the University's Policy on Sexual As
sault since the Ramstad Amendment
went into effect in September 1993.
The amendment requires universities
receiving federal funding to include cer
tain data in their sexual assault policies,
such as information regarding preven
tion, education and response services,
Traugott said.
"We need to make sure that what we
have now is in compliance with the law,"
Edmonds said.
Formed during the summer, the task
force — composed of students and staff
— will also look at how well Stanford is
doing in terms of providing students
with information and resources about
sexual assault, Edmonds said, adding
that it will hold its first meeting
soon and should complete its rec
ommendations within the aca
demic year.
But as the task force begins its
work, the administration is left
with questions about whether the
University can deal effectively
with issues surrounding sexual
assault.
'Not students' responsibility'
Many students maintain that
responsibility for funding the Sex
ual Assault Resource Center, the
prevention educator position and
programs such as "Sex in the
'905," belongs with the University
and not the students.
Traugott said the creation of
the student-funded Sexual
Assault Legal Advocates in 1993
is a perfect example of how the
University has failed to fulfill its
responsibility as outlined in the
Ramstad Amendment.
The idea behind the organiza
tion was to train law students to
provide victims with legal advice
regarding sexual assault, she said.
But Traugott said this service
is not the students' responsibility,
but instead the University's.
"The University needs to . ..
provide this advice to students.
That's what the Ramstad Amend
ment requires them to do," she
said.
Gail Prichard, the coordinator
for the Campus Sexual Assault
Response and Recovery Team (C
-SARRT), said the University does
support providing these services,
as evidenced by the Office of Resi
dential Education's commitment
to "Sex in the '905."
"I have no doubt about the
level of commitment to it,"
Prichard said, although Res Ed
did not fund the program.
Stanford's existing sexual
assault policy — enacted in accor
dance with a 1991 California law
requiring universities to imple
ment such policies — puts the
University's commitment to pre
vention in writing.
But Traugott criticized the pol
icy, saying it violates the Ramstad
Amendment because it doesn't
provide sufficient information
about University services for sex

ual assault, and the little informa
tion that is provided in the policy
is "vague."
For example, although Stan
ford's policy lists C-SARRT as an
"emergency service available to
victims," it doesn't describe the
organization or what services it

provides, Traugott said.
"Most people don't know what
C-SARRT is," she said, adding
that she surveyed about 35 stu
dents last spring and "almost
nobody had heard of C-SARRT."
"The policy is very vague about
who you would contact for what,"
she said. "It doesn't notify students
about their options including where
to go and what to do if they're sexu
ally assaulted.... It's just this big
mystery to people. That indicates
what a big problem this is."
The policy also fails to inform
"the accused" about possible
penalties, she said.
Stanford 'far behind'
In addition to pointing out the
policy's shortcomings, Traugott
examined the services the Univer
sity offers students in the area of
sexual assault. In her paper,
Traugott argued that the Univer
sity's prevention, education and
response mechanisms are insuffi
cient.
She said Stanford "is pretty far
behind a lot of universities" in
terms of providing services for
students.
Senior Virginia Duplessis, trea
surer of the coalition, agreed that
Stanford probably provides fewer
services for students than a lot of

other universities.
"When [former Sexual Assault
Prevention Educator] Angelina
Cheney was still here, we proba
bly were about the same as other
schools, but now since her posi
tion has been eliminated, we've
regressed," Duplessis said.

The University used
a lot of 'delay-tactics'
such as forming
committees to study
the issues.

Because Cheney's position was
funded by the coalition's special
fee request, her last day of work
was Sept. 30.
Senior Angel Foster — director
of "Sex in the '90s" for the last
three years — said Brown Univer
sity is known for having an excel
lent sexual assault program.
Brown University offers stu
dents a Sexual Assault Peer Edu
cator Program, said Assoc. Dean
for Student Life Toby Simon.
About 80 to 100 students volun
teer to work in the program and
Simon serves as the program's
director, she said.
Brown also funds a mandatory
freshman Orientation program,
"Sex Without Consent: Implications
for Brown Students," Simon said.
In addition, five University
employees devote part of their
time to serve the Sexual Assault
Advocacy Program, which coun
sels victims.
For the last 18 years, Brown
has operated a "Women on Call"
program that acts as a rape-crisis
response team. Six university
employees devote part of their
time to that, Simon added.
In comparison, UC-Berkeley
funds two full-time health educa
tor positions who work in the
Rape Prevention Education Pro

gram, said Abby Rincon, one of
the health educators.
Also, students from the Peer
Education Group are trained to
deal with issues of sexual assault
and lead discussions around cam
pus, Rincon said. Students earn
academic credit for serving as
peer educators, she added.
A history of struggle
Students have repeatedly tried to
get the University to commit fund
ing for sexual assault programs and
positions, but have met with little
success, according to Susan Epstein,
a 1991 Stanford graduate who
served as the first Sexual Assault
Prevention Educator during the
1991-92 academic year.
The Sexual Assault Resource
Center was established in 1991
when the ASSU Senate approved
$45,000 in funding for sexual
assault prevention and education
on campus.
The original bill was meant to
compensate for the University's
inability to fund recommenda
tions of the 1990 Sexual Assault
Task Force. The ASSU committed
to funding the programs for one
year, with the understanding that
the University would then
assume financial responsibility.
