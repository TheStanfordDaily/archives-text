# Tired of inaction, students fight for rape prevention
## 
### Beth Berselli Senior staff writer 
Citing a long history of inaction, some
students are speaking out against the
University's alleged failure to protect
them from sexual assault and provide re
lated services.
In response to a 37-page paper writ
ten on the subject by second-year law
student Isabel Traugott, the University
has formed a new task force to study the
University's Policy on Sexual Assault.
This move follows in the wake of last
week's temporary closure of the Sexual
Assault Resource Center and the elimi
nation of a full-time sexual assault pre
vention educator position — both the re
sult of insufficient funds.
The center's money troubles arose
last spring, when students failed to ap
prove the special-fee request for the

Coalition Against Sexual Assault, which
funded a variety of campus sexual-as
sault programs including the resource
center and the Orientation program
"Sex in the '905."
The loss of the coalition's special fee is
just the latest, however, in nearly a half
decade of setbacks to sexual assault pre
vention dealt both by the students and
the administration.
Taking action to reverse the tide,
Traugott — also the founder of Sexual
Assault Legal Advocates — wrote a
paper last year charging that the Univer
sity is in violation of the Ramstad
Amendment of the Higher Education
Act of 1992 because its sexual assault
policy doesn't provide students with suf
ficient information about options and
available resources.
Saying that Traugott's paper served
as an "impetus," Vice Provost and Dean

for Student Affairs Mary Edmonds said
the task force will examine the viability
of the University's Policy on Sexual As
sault since the Ramstad Amendment
went into effect in September 1993.
The amendment requires universities
receiving federal funding to include cer
tain data in their sexual assault policies,
such as information regarding preven
tion, education and response services,
Traugott said.
"We need to make sure that what we
have now is in compliance with the law,"
Edmonds said.
Formed during the summer, the task
force — composed of students and staff
— will also look at how well Stanford is
doing in terms of providing students
with information and resources about
sexual assault, Edmonds said, adding
