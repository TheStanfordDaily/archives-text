# Facelift for museum planned
## Changes to Rodin garden and new amenities slated 
### September Treviño Staff writer 
As the Stanford Art Museum
prepares to undergo earthquake
repairs, directors are hoping to
give the museum a facelift of their
own.
"One of our initiatives is to try
to reinvent the museum," said
Bernard Barryte, the museum's
associate director.
The "reinvention" is intended
to spark new interest in the muse
um through such amenities as a
new restaurant, a bookstore and a
multi-purpose room for lectures,
dancing and "most any form of
expression you can imagine."
These facilities will be included
in a new wing, which will also
house a gallery for modern and
contemporary art and temporary
exhibition space for traveling art
shows.
In addition to the new wing,
the restoration and expansion
efforts will include enhancement
of the Rodin Sculpture Garden
and structural repairs to the
museum's main building, which
was damaged in the 1989 Loma
Prieta Earthquake. The museum

has been closed for nearly five
years.
The museum staff is currently
packing up its 18,000-piece collec
tion and preparing to transport it
to Encina Gym, where it will be
stored for the next two years dur
ing the construction.
Once the artwork is moved,
work crews will begin removing
hazardous materials, such as
asbestos and lead, from the build
ing.
Construction is scheduled to
begin in the spring and will be
completed in 1997.
There will be an emphasis on
maintaining the building's histor
ical integrity. For example,
although previous construction
plans eliminated one of the two
original rotundas, the current
plan will restore both.
"The same historical fabric will
remain intact," said Barryte. In
addition, all mosaics will be
restored, he said. Modern touches
will include such features as a
state-of-the-art climate control
system and a new security system.
The $29 million museum
restoration project will be funded
primarily by private donors,

including a $10 million gift from
Iris and B. Gerald Cantor, who
have supported Stanford arts for
more than 25 years. The Federal
Emergency Management Agency
will contribute $6 million to cover
earthquake repairs.
While construction crews work
on restoring the building struc
ture, museum staff members will
be working to revitalize the muse
um's atmosphere, Barryte said.
He added that there will be a
strong push to increase visibility
through publicity and "more
active exhibition programs,"
including special previews, invita
tions to faculty for special events
and open houses for new students.
The Rodin Sculpture Garden
will also be expanded to include 37
additional sculptures donated last
year by the Cantors, who original
ly established the University's
Auguste Rodin collection. Works
by the French sculptor's 19th
Century predecessors will be
installed in the garden as well.
The museum also plans to
acquire more modern works to
bring the sculpture garden "more
into the 20th Century," Barryte
said.

The Stanford Museum — closed for the last five years — will soon undergo two years of renovations
which will add such features as a restaurant and a bookstore to the historic building.
