## Clinton sends troops to Persian Gulf Iraq masses 60,000 troops along the Kuwait border 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The United States
began massing "a formidable military force"
of warplanes, high-tech missiles and ground
troops in the Persian Gulf, yesterday, as
administration officials warned Iraqi leader
Saddam Hussein any attack against Kuwait
would be soundly defeated.
President Clinton interrupted a Columbus
Day holiday weekend at Camp David and met
for 90-minutes at the White House with his
national security team.
"It looks as though there is hostile intent,"
said United Nations Ambassador Madeleine
Albright, pointing out that Iraq had massed
(36,000 to 70,000 troops near Kuwait — some
within miles of the border — and that tanks
were positioned to "indicate hostility, rather
than just parking there."
"The main message ... to Saddam Hussein
is, 'Do not make a mistake. Do not cross that
border. Do not create circumstances that will
force us to act," Albright added in an inter
view on CNN's "Tate Edition."
At the White House, national security advi
sor Tony Lake told reporters that Clinton had
been told that close to one division of Iraqi sol
diers were poised within two kilometers (1.2
miles) of the demilitarized zone separating
Iraq from Kuwait.
Lake also said Clinton was briefed about the
Pentagon's plans for the coming days and

week, but did not say whether that meant fur
ther U.S. troop deployments were in the works.
Meanwhile, 18,000 Marines from Camp
Pendleton, Calif., were put on alert for possi
ble deployment to the gulf and the first of
some 4,000 Army soldiers from Fort Stewart,
Ga., began boarding planes for the region.
Late yesterday, the aircraft carrier USS
George Washington was slated to pass
through the Suez Canal and enter the Red
Sea, a position from which its combat aircraft
could strike Iraq. And two amphibious assault
ships with 2,000 Marines on board were
already in the northern Persian Gulf.
Over the next several days, administration
officials said, about 180 U.S. warplanes and
support aircraft will be in position around
Kuwait, ready to unleash an airborne attack
against any Iraqi armored units that might
cross the border.
"We have Marines on alert to go at an
appropriate time. We have deployed many
squadrons of tactical air — F-15s, F-16s, A
10s, AWACS," Defense Secretary William
Perry told reporters.
"All in all, this is a formidable military
force," he said.
Pentagon officials said Perry was referring
to the F-15 fighter jets departing from Lang
ley Air Force Base in Virginia; 24 A-10 tank
killers, 18 F-16s capable of dropping laser

guided bombs and 14 C-130 transports being
dispatched from Pope Air Force Base in North
Carolina to bolster the more than 100 aircraft
now in the region.
Also, KC-10 and KC-135 tankers, AWACs
radar planes and C-141 transports were also
being sent, military officials said.
RC-135 reconnaissance aircraft from
Offutt Air Force Base in Omaha, Neb.; U-2
spy planes from Beale, Calif., and EC-130
communication jammers from Davis-Mon
than Air Force Base in Arizona were also
being deployed, they added.
But Perry also noted that two of Iraq's pre
mier Republican Guard units were still moving
into position, and would not be ready to mount a
strike against Kuwait until the end of the week.
Asked whether U.S. forces might attack
Baghdad, Perry declined to answer, saying
only, "We're prepared to respond with robust
force, and we would be very successful in that
response. ... If the Iraqis enter Kuwait, they
will be soundly defeated."
Top administration officials left no doubt
they intended to be ready, no matter what
action Iraq took.
"We are not going to allow the must; ikes of the
past to be repeated," White House Chief of Staff
Leon Panetta told NBC's "Meet the Press." He
said Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein "shouldn't
underestimate the resolve or the will of the U.S."
