PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP)
Lt. Gen. Raoul Ccdras will step down
Monday as Haiti's military leader,
clearing the way for exiled President
Jean-Bertrand Aristide's homecoming.
But violence against Aristide support
ers continued yesterday when a bus
plowed into a pro-democracy march,
killing 14 people.
Cedras will transfer power to the
army's No. 2 commander, Maj. Gen. Jean-
Claude Duperval, under a plan approved
Saturday in Washington by Haitian offi
cers and representatives of exiled Presi
dent Jean-Bertrand Aristide, said Col.
Jean-Robert Gabriel, a spokesman for the

Haitian high command.
Also set to leave is Brig. Gen.
Philippe Biamby, the army chief of staff
and a leader of the September 1991
coup that ousted Aristide. The resigna
tions would pave the way for Aristide's
expected return on Saturday.
Gabriel, speaking to reporters from
the second-floor balcony of army head
quarters, said the ceremony would be
held Monday morning. He declined to
elaborate.
Cedras met for 45 minutes yesterday
with Lt. Gen. Hugh Shelton, the U.S.
military commander in Haiti. He also
met with provisional President Emile

Jonaissant. Details of the discussions
weren't disclosed.
Outside the capital in the southern
town of Djimenzen, a bus plowed into
pro-Aristide marchers yesterday,
killing 14 people. U.S. Special Forces
officers on the scene said the bus driver
deliberately ran down the marchers. It
wasn't immediately known if there
were arrests.
Aristide supporters also were sad
dened by news yesterday that an out
spoken pro-Aristide artist, Stevenson
Magloire, was beaten to death in broad
daylight. There were no immediate
arrests in that incident.
