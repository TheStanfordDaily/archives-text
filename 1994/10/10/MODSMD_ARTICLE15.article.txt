Terorists attack Israelis
JERUSALEM (AP) - Two Palestini
ans armed with automatic rifles and
grenades attacked Israelis and tourists
yesterday on a downtown street crowded
with outdoor cafes before being shot to
death, witnesses and police said.
One other person was killed and 15
wounded, including six seriously, in the
attack in central Jerusalem shortly
before midnight, hospital officials said.
Angry Israelis shouted "Death to the
Arabs!" as police led away two Palestini
ans from the scene, their arms raised

over their heads. About 300 people sur
rounded the Palestinians and beat them
before police could get them into a van.
The attack occurred a few blocks from the
King David Hotel, where Secretary of State
Warren Christopher was staying. Police
barricaded the road leading to the hotel.
It wasn't immediately known if the
attack was timed to coincide with
Christopher's visit, said Police Minister
Moshe Shahal.
Israel army radio quoted police as say
ing one of the attackers was from the
Gaza Strip and a known member of the
Islamic fundamentalist group Hamas.
