## Fight sexual assault 
### 
University should fund
programs and resources
to combat sexual assault

EVERY STUDENT receives
the "New Stanford Farm
Almanac" at the beginning of
each year, summarizing on-campus
safety and security resources. Four
pages of the pamphlet are dedicat
ed to sexual assault, covering pre
vention programs as well as medi
cal and counseling options avail
able to victims.
Unfortunately, if students need
additional materials regarding sex
ual-assault education, they will
find the Sexual Assault Resource
Center closed, the campus's only
full-time educator position vacant
and the future of "Sex in the '90s"
in jeopardy. Having spent a great
deal of time and energy establish
ing a full-time position for a sexual
harassment advisor, the University
now needs to take on another lead
ership role and work to ensure that
a similar full-time resource is avail
able for sexual assault issues.
When the ASSU created the
Resource Center over three years
ago as a place to provide informa
tion on sexual assault, it was
understood that the University
would assume funding after one
year. Three years have passed with
out such funding, and since the
Coalition Against Sexual Assault
was denied its special-fee request in
last year's ASSU election, the
Resource Center has shut down.
Granted, the University has
committed itself to funding a part
time position in the Sexual Assault
Prevention Program, an arm of the
Resource Center. But now, even
that position is vacant, as Program
Coordinator Trace Shapiro's term
expired in August and no replace
ment has yet been found.
Dean of Students Michael Jack
son was correct in saying that the
University cannot come to the res

cue of every program that loses its
funding. Besides straining the lim
its of the University's resources in
these tight times, it would also put
the administration in the awkward
position of choosing the benefit of
one group over another.
However, the Sexual Assault
Resource Center is a resource the
administration should reconsider.
Compared to many universities —
such as UC-Berkeley, which has two
full-time educators — and its com
mitment to providing other safety
resources, Stanford lags far behind
in the services it provides for sexual
assault. If so much time is spent
educating resident assistants, resi
dent fellows and incoming freshmen
on how to recognize, prevent and
respond to sexual assault, then the
University has to make a commit
ment to ensure that clear options
for further education and programs
are available to all students.
The administration and mem
bers of the Resource Center and
Prevention Program need to work
together to see how best to consoli
date and coordinate resources.
Instead of just looking for a part
time coordinator for the Prevention
Program, the University should
search for a full-time director for
the Coalition Against Sexual
Assault. This person could work
with a core group of students and
counselors to hold information
hours at both the Resource Center
and the Prevention Program, as
well as coordinate dorm workshops.
With regard to "Sex in the '905,"
the $8,000 needed for this program
could be put to more effective use.
While the presentation in Memori
al Auditorium has become an Ori
entation tradition, it is really the
dorm discussions afterward that
are the most beneficial. Instead of
paying for early arrivals and tech
nical expertise, the Coalition could
use the money to make a first-class
film based on the skit's script. This
tape would only need to last five
years, time enough for the new
educator to prepare "Sex in the
21st Century."
