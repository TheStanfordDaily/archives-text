DEATH. The Great Beyond. The

The End.
All our lives, we are confronted with
death in one form or another. We read
about it in the news; we see it on televi
sion an average of 3,723.8 times a year, on
our windshields and not so gratefully,
even at rock concerts. It hits our acquain
tances, our friends, our family and even
tually, most of us. Death appears to be at
least as übiquitous as life. In fact, some
sociopsychologists have postulated that
our preoccupation with death and our
fear thereof motivates our entire moral
and economic behavior during our life
times, not just afterwards.
Why this obsession with death? Well,
for one, it ranks right up there with sex
and food as a fairly pervasive human phe
nomenon. Second, it's considerably less
well-understood than food, and only a
shade easier to figure out than sex.
Theories concerning death abound. To
some, death leads to a state of eternal
bliss, accompanied by harp music, lots of
good food and/or a phalanx of virgins
untouched by human hand. Most who
believe in this scenario have also proposed
a converse outcome, distinguished by fire,
brimstone, horned goats and a hell of a lot
of pain.
Others see death as a new beginning,

the opportunity to start all over again and
to get it right the next time. Many view
this picture as a rather repetitious routine
and hope for an apocalyptic destruction of
the universe in order to put an end to the
tedium.
Yet others believe death is indeed the
end. Given recent attempts to character
ize humans as just another ingenious
amalgam of hardware and software, capa
ble of being designed by an engineering
member of Stanford's class of 2045, this
view is not at all surprising. Life is seen as
effectively digitizable, and thus death is
nothing but a division by zero.
Fact is, despite the assurances of David
Koresh and the members of the Cult of
the Solar Temple, no one knows for damn
sure. Unfortunately, not too many people
have come back to tell us all about it.
Many people believe Jesus succeeded, but
what he had to say dealt more with life
than with what comes next. Harry Houdi
ni tried, but to all appearances didn't
quite make it. Elvis may have, but if so,
he's been limiting himself to cameo roles
in "Forrest Gump."
Without arguing for or against any of
these scenarios, let's just sit back for a
moment and take a look at the structure
of space-time. Yes, space-time. Some say
space-time is not, in fact, a world con
stantly changing over the course of time,
but rather a pretty static state of affairs
where time is just another direction, like
up. According to this interpretation, the

apparent passage of time is not real but
an illusion due to the way our brains
work, the second law of thermodynamic
and some other jazz. So there's no partic
ular significance to "now," "the past?"
"the future" and so on. Something that
was true in 1955 will always be true
1955. Someone who was alive in 19£f5
(even if not in 1994) will always be alive in
1955. >
So death kind of loses its sting. If time
is just another dimension in space-timfc,
then the transition from life to death js
more like the transition from me to the
rock I'm sitting on.
Of course, despite the philosophical
babblings, death will always be hard to
deal with. Recovering from the loss of
someone you care for is still a tough
task, accomplished only through
patience, quiet contemplation and ulti
mately, a lot of love. Even Einstein can't
help much there. Let alone the guy who
hangs out in White Plaza with a placard
in one hand and the wrath of God in the
other.
In the meantime, there's a hell of a lot
of fun stuff to do out there before Charon
shows up on the doorstep.
