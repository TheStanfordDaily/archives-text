History Prof, explains views on distribution requirements

I WOULD LIKE to correct several
pieces of information and statements
attributed to me in the Oct. 7 article
on overhauling distribution require
ments.
First, a point of privilege: I am not
now, nor have I ever been, John. My
given name is Jack, and I carry it proud
ly in Anglicized memory of my grandfa
ther, Yaacov.
Second, though I certainly favor sim
plifying the DR system, I am not "fed
up" with it, as stated in the story. I have
found few experiences in my fifteen
years at Stanford more rewarding or

challenging than teaching Cultures,
Ideas and Values, which I did last year
and look forward to doing again next
quarter. In my modest opinion, the
Stanford DR system is overly refined in
its architecture and perhaps too spotty
at times in the choices it offers students,
but I have no philosophical disagree
ment with it in principle.
Third, my passing experience with
the American Cultures requirement
needs explanation. I had a marginal role
in the revision of that requirement as it
was initially proposed several years ago,
and at that point I submitted my own

lead-off segment of the American histo
ry survey for inclusion in the new area.
I did so after extensive conversations
with the then-chair of the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies, my colleague
and squash partner Peter Duus, who
assured me that my course was just
what they had in mind. I was surprised,
therefore, when the course was subse
quently not approved by the relevant
subcommittee.
Though I still think my course meets
the criteria, I have not resubmitted it.
But my reservations about doing so go
beyond personal pique.

I would rather teach a course where
I have a better chance to learn every
one's name, where I would have
enough teaching assistants to go
around, and where I could be confident
that students are there because they
want to be. And that in turn explains
why I think our existing system of cre
ating requirements and then hoping
that professors will volunteer courses
to meet them sometimes produces
uneven results in terms of supply and
demand.
