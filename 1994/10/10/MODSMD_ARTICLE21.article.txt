# SIG treasurer disputes statements in ASSU ad about fee-refund system
## 
### 
On Friday, Oct. 7, The Daily ran an
advertisement from the ASSU detailing
the special-fee refund process. The ad
warned, "Certain groups (Legal Coun
seling, SURE, Speakers Bureau, Stan
ford in Government and others) will
deny you their services if you request a

refund from them!" As a representative
of Stanford in Government, I would like
to correct the inaccuracies in this state
ment.
1. SIG has never denied services to
any member of the Stanford community.
SIG provides resources and fellowship
opportunities to all students, regardless
of year, or degree status. Despite
the fact that SIG suffered a tremendous
ly high fee refund rate last year, we
never denied services to anyone â€” in
fact, SIG provided $1,450 fellowship
stipend checks to students who had

requested refunds!
2. When you log on to request a fee
refund this year, you won't even see
Stanford in Government on the list of
funded groups. Despite earning 52 per
cent of the student vote (including 75
percent of the undergraduate vote), SIG
lost its special-fee bid last year because of
a little-known ASSU bylaw. Therefore,
SIG will not be part of the refund pro
cess this year, since the ASSU special fee
provides us with no financial support.
What troubles myself and other SIG
board members is the suggestion that

SlG's doors are closed to any of Stan
ford's students. Our office is located on
the first floor of the Haas Center for
Public Service. We invite all students to
come in and check out our internship
resources, for we offer assistance for
students of all majors and backgrounds
who want to work in government or
influencing government. Get involved!
You won't even have to pay a 39-cent
special fee to do it.
