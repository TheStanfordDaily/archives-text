## Stanford wins some crucial battles but not the war ASU prevails 36-35 on last-second field goal 
### Greg Collins Staff writer 
After nearly four years at the
helm of Stanford's offense, senior
quarterback Steve Stenstrom final
ly became the most prolific passer

[Cardinal 35
j Arizona St. 36

in Pacific 10 Conference history.
But this record, like almost every
other one he's set as a Cardinal,
can do little to soothe the heart
break of Saturday night's last-sec
ond 36-35 loss to Arizona State.
A 37-yard field goal with six sec
onds left to play pushed the Sun
Devils (2-3, 2-1 in the Pac-10) over
the top in a dramatic contest
marked by game-breaking
turnovers. A career-day by Arizona
State quarterback Jake Plummer
cemented his name in the Sun

Devil legend as he guided Arizona
State on a miraculous final drive in
which he converted three fourth
down plays.
"Well, we're stricken," said head
coach Bill Walsh, as his Cardinal
fell to 1-3-1 overall, 0-2 in Pac-10
competition. "Our hats are off to
Arizona State for making a series
of fourth-down plays that we did
not stop."
That final drive, a 16-play, 58-
yard slugfest which took over five
minutes, contained all the excite
ment a college football fan could
want. A fumble by Sun Devil Par
nell Charles on the first play of the
drive bounced back into his grasp,
but it put Arizona State back to
their own 14-yard line. Stanford's
defense pushtxl the Sun Devils to
the edge of defeat three times, but
each time a big play on fourth down
kept Arizona State's hopes alive.
"We stayed in zone most of the
time, but they hit two big plays on
us when we were in man-to-man
coverage," said sophomore free
safety Scott Frost . "It's a defense
where we try to get to the quarter
back and we just didn't get there.
He made a couple of good throws."
On fourth-and-12 at their own
31, Plummer scrambled for 13
yards down the right side of the
field. Plummer later connected
with wide receiver Clyde McCoy for
a 16-yard gain on fourth-and-11
with one minute, two seconds left
in the game. A 25-yard completion
from Plummer to Keith Poole got
the ball down to Stanford's 21-yard
line, setting up Jon Baker's game
winning field goal.
For the game, Plummer com
pleted 23-of-39 passes for 274
yards and two touchdowns, all of
which tied or set career highs for
the sophomore quarterback in the
biggest game of his collegiate
career.
"They were all single coverage
plays," Walsh said. "Our defenders
were just not responding to the
break of the receiver. They threw it
15 or 20 yards and our defender
wasn't even near where he should
have been."

After an anemic first half in
which the Cardinal only gained 97
yards of total offense, Stanford
came out firing in the second half.
Stenstrom completed 15-of-21 pass
as for 211 yards after the break. For
the game, he was 28-of-36 for 313
yards and one touchdown. Howev
er, even with Stenstrom completing
78 percent of his passes, the lack of
a running game made it difficult for
the Cardinal to run the clock down
after taking a 35-27 lead with 12:27
left in the game.
The only two bright spots in the
first half were Stenstrom's record
setting pass and a 100-yard kickofT
return for a touchdown by fresh
man Damon Dunn. Stenstrom set
the all-time Pac-10 record for
career passing yards with 3:59 left
in the second quarter when he con
nected with senior wide receiver

Justin Armour on a 19-yard com
pletion. That throw pushed Sten
strom past Oregon State's Eric Wil
helm, who previously held the
record with 9,393 yards. Stenstrom
now has 9,662 career yards passing.
Down 20-8 at halftime, Stanford
proceeded to score 28 points in the
second half. Despite the lack of an
established running game, sopho
more Adam Salina did his best
Tommy Vardell imitation by scor
ing touchdowns of five, three and
one yards. Stenstrom added a 24-
yard touchdown pass to sophomore
flanker Brian Manning, who
caught seven passes for 126 yards.
It was Manning's third game of
over 100 yards receiving this year.
"We came out fired up in the
second half," Armour said. "The
offense got things clicking and the
defense was stopping them."

Three of Stanford's second-half
scoring drives covered 80 yards or
more, including an 11-play, 98-yard
masterpiece which put Stanford up
35-27. However, even this long
drive only took 4:08 off the clock.
None of the three other second-half
scores took more than 1:58.
Contrary to Stanford's luck ear
lier this season, the Cardinal
received important breaks in its
favor. A fumble by Sun Devil run
ning back Terry Battle at the Stan
ford 10-yard line was recovered by
junior cornerback Kwame Ellis,
ending a first quarter drive just
short of an Arizona State score.
Freshman strong safety Kadar
Hamilton also intercepted a Plum
mer pass at the Sun Devil 26-yard
line and returned it to the 11, set
ting up one of Salina'a three scores.
