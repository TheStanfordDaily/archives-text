School's in. And this year, there's a new
schoolmaster.
Stanford's women's volleyball program has
always been very competitive. However, this
weekend's victories over No. 11 USC and No. 3
UCLA reinforce the top-ranked Cardinal as the
standard by which other teams are judged this
year. Instead of merely passing tests, Stanford
may now be in a position to give such examina
tions to other squads.
Friday night Stanford swept the Trojans 3-0
(15-13, 15-5, 15-13) and on Saturday evening
the Cardinal dealt longtime nemesis and
defending Pacific 10 Conference champion
UCLA a 3-1 defeat (15-6, 8-15, 15-13, 15-9).
"I've been voting them No. 1 all along," said
Bruin head coach Andy Banachowski. "I'm cer
tainly not going to change it now. They are def
initely the strongest team we've played."
Banachowski's squad had previously faced
and been beaten by No. 4 Penn State. Trojan
head coach Lisa Love also ranked the Cardinal
ahead of the more talented teams in the nation.
"They are the best team we've faced so far,"
she said. "More talented than Ohio State or
Arizona, our other two losses. They kept us
back on our heels the whole match." The Buck
eyes and Wildcats are currently ranked sixth
and 14th, respectively.
Stanford head coach Don Shaw remains
wary, despite the high praise for his squad.
According to Shaw, the Cardinal must remain
focused and keep looking towards what is yet to
come, not to what has already transpired.
"We've passed a lot of tests that we hadn't at
this point last year," he said. "We hadn't
played teams of such caliber this season. Now
we have and so far, so good. But there's still
more to come."
"You can count on us seeing the Bruins two
more times this season — once in Los Angeles
and once in the [NCAA] tournament," he con
tinued. "That's partly because of the way the
tournament is structured, but mostly because
of what type of team UCLA is."
The match against the Bruins was a defen
sive battle. UCLA managed only a .149 hitting
percentage, while the Cardinal, the top hitting
team in the conference, registered a .204 aver
age, over a 100 points lower than its season
average.

"Our blockers were definitely doing their job
against UCLA," said Shaw. Freshman setter
Lisa Sharpley, freshman middle blocker Bar
bara Ifejika and junior outside hitter Marnie
Triefenbach all had five blocks.
Shaw was not as thrilled with the Stanford
offensive attack in the UCLA match.
"If we had passed like that last year against
UCLA, we would've been blown out," he said
"Luckily, this year we have a couple of hitters
who can win us games even when we're not
passing so well."
One of these hitters is freshman Kristen
Folkl, last week's Pac-10 Player of the Week.
Folkl had 17 kills in the match and her play
drew comparisons to that of UCLA's outstand
ing senior Annett Buckner, a Player of the Year
candidate who came up with 18 kills Saturday
night. Both players were the subject of much
consideration by the opposing team's defense.
"You know who's over there on the other
side," Shaw said. "So there's no surprises. But
that's why they're great players. You know
they're going to get the ball more often than
not, yet they still come through. The scary
thing is that one's a senior and the other's a

freshman. We've had to see Annett for four
years and now they're going to have to see Kris
ten for four."
While Folkl provided a large portion of Stan
ford's power, it was fitting that a Triefenbach
kill ended the match and gave the Cardinal the
victory. The junior had a team-high 20 kills to
top off a weekend of inspired volleyball.
Triefenbach, recovering from a leg fracture,
had begun the season "in a slump," as she put
it. The slump has ended, if her performance
against the Los Angeles schools can be trusted.
"I've finally gotten over some things, in vol
leyball and out of volleyball," she said. "Coach
Shaw showed that he had a lot of confidence in
me and that really pumped me up."
"She's starting to come on strong," Shaw
said. "Hitting is a known quantity with her,
she's always been a strong hitter, but when she
does well defensively like she did tonight [Sat
urday], we've got the complete package."
Triefenbach also had 15 kills on Friday
against the Trojans in a true offensive struggle.
