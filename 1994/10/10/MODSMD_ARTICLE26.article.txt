Saturday afternoon the Cardinal men's water polo team held
their traditional Alumni match at deGuerre Pool, which fea
tured approximately 25 Stanford water polo alums. Four ex-
Cardinal Olympians joined forces on the Alumni squad: Chris
Dorst, '77, on the 1980 and 1984 Olympic teams; Jody Camp
bell, '82, a three-time Olympian (1980, 1984, and 1988); Allen
Mouchawar, *82, on the 1988 Olympic team; and Craig Klass,
'87, an Olympian in 1988 and 1992. Historically, the Alumni
team has captured the match, although victory is not always
gained by solely legitimate means. "It's fairly serious for a
while, and then towards the end it breaks down. We have some
fun out there, and it's a good experience for our guys to play
the grads," said head coach Dante Dettamanti. Apparently the
alum strategy of extra athletes in the pool, loose reffing and
slipping in extra points worked: Alums took the match, 14-13.
