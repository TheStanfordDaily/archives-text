# Soccer beats USD 2-0 to remain undefeated
## 
### Jeremy Stone Staff writer 
Cardinal 2
San Piego 0

A crowd of 650 people collec
tively held its breath at 3:15 p.m.
yesterday at Maloney Field, when
sophomore forward Erin Martin
of the Stanford women's soccer
team went down on the field.
Unlike most of the Cardinal
injuries this season, however,
Martin's was not serious. She
returned in the second half and
scored both goals to lead No. 3
Stanford (9-0) to a 2-0 victory
over San Diego (5-7), the Cardi
nal's fourth consecutive
shutout.
Head coach lan Sawyers has
made the long, slow trip out onto
the field many times in this
injury-filled season. To his relief,
Martin was able to walk off after
a little over a minute.
"As soon as it's an ankle, even
if they roll it, that's not so bad,"
Sawyers said. "The problem is
that as soon as a kid goes down,
we've had so many injuries,
they're psyching themselves out.
It's, 'Oh god, I've got a bad ankle,
I'm done for the year.'"
Martin, however, was not
fazed by her fall.
"You really can't think about
injuries at all," said Martin, who
paces the Stanford scoring attack
with nine goals. "If you play hop
ing not to get hurt, you're going
to end up getting hurt."
Martin's injury was a key fac
tor in a scoreless first half. Stan
ford thoroughly dominated to

the tune of 12 shots on goal to
one, but only had a handful of
missed opportunities to show for
it. With five fullbacks and four
midfielders, the Toreros sacri
ficed some offense by bolstering
the defense.
"At halftime, I said it's going
to be a struggle because the other
team's bunkering," Sawyers said.
"They just packed it in [on the
defensive 6ide]. I told [the play
ers], 'You've got to find a way to
win.'"
Martin would do just that in
the second half. Showing no ill
effects from the bad ankle, she
was streaking towards the goal
when junior midfielder Carmel
Murphy delivered a perfect pass.
Martin fired from the top of the
box over lunging goalkeeper Alli
son Worden.
"It was just the perfect ball to
me," Martin said, crediting Mur
phy for her second assist of the
season. "I ran through the
defense and put it in the far
post."
The "world class goal," as
Sawyers called it, came at 57
minutes, 22 seconds, and contin
ued a second-half scoring streak
for Stanford, which has secured
at least one goal after intermis
sion in 16 consecutive games dat
ing back to last October.
Martin put the game away
with under 20 minutes to play.
Senior fullback Melinda Min
strell centered a pass from just
beyond the right side of the
penalty box. As Worden dove for
the ball and came up empty, Mar
tin punched it into the open net.
Minstrell thus became the team's
unlikely leader in assists with
three.
Martin's second consecutive
two-goal game came exactly one

year after she accomplished the
feat previously. She also had both
goals in last Wednesday's victory
over St. Mary's.
Though the sophomore for
ward claimed the show's spot
light yesterday, freshman mid
fielder Elie Foster also proved
herself an important factor
offensively. After registering
only eight shots on goal in her
seven previous starts, Foster led
the Cardinal with seven yester
day.
"I wanted to get more involved
in the offense because I feel I'm
always going backwards," Foster
said. "I wanted to try and get the
ball forwards and get the attack
going, especially since they were
flooding the backs. We were try
ing to take shots from the out
side."
San Diego failed to take many
shots at all in sticking to its
defensive strategy. Senior goal
keeper Jennifer Poehler once
again did little in notching her
sixth shutout of the year.
While the Cardinal defense
continues to do the job, the
offense is still searching for a
breakthrough game.
"We're still struggling to fin
ish," Sawyers said. "We're get
ting players in great positions,
but we're just not quite putting
the final touches on it. Hopefully,
it's just a matter of time."
Though Stanford allowed the
Toreros to remain close until the
latter stages, Sawyers saluted his
team's effort.
"It wasn't our best game,"
Sawyers said. "We really strug
gled in the first half, and we
struggled a little bit in the second
half. That's the positive thing
that comes out of games like this.
We found a wav to win."

Martin's injury was a key fac
tor in a scoreless first half. Stan
ford thoroughly dominated to

the tune of 12 shots on goal to
one, but only had a handful of
missed opportunities to show for
it. With five fullbacks and four
midfielders, the Toreros sacri
ficed some offense by bolstering
the defense.
"At halftime, I said it's going
to be a struggle because the other
team's bunkering," Sawyers said.
"They just packed it in [on the
defensive 6ide]. I told [the play
ers], 'You've got to find a way to
win.'"
Martin would do just that in
the second half. Showing no ill
effects from the bad ankle, she
was streaking towards the goal
when junior midfielder Carmel
Murphy delivered a perfect pass.
Martin fired from the top of the
box over lunging goalkeeper Alli
son Worden.
"It was just the perfect ball to
me," Martin said, crediting Mur
phy for her second assist of the
season. "I ran through the
defense and put it in the far
post."
The "world class goal," as
Sawyers called it, came at 57
minutes, 22 seconds, and contin
ued a second-half scoring streak
for Stanford, which has secured
at least one goal after intermis
sion in 16 consecutive games dat
ing back to last October.
Martin put the game away
with under 20 minutes to play.
Senior fullback Melinda Min
strell centered a pass from just
beyond the right side of the
penalty box. As Worden dove for
the ball and came up empty, Mar
tin punched it into the open net.
Minstrell thus became the team's
unlikely leader in assists with
three.
Martin's second consecutive
two-goal game came exactly one

year after she accomplished the
feat previously. She also had both
goals in last Wednesday's victory
over St. Mary's.
Though the sophomore for
ward claimed the show's spot
light yesterday, freshman mid
fielder Elie Foster also proved
herself an important factor
offensively. After registering
only eight shots on goal in her
seven previous starts, Foster led
the Cardinal with seven yester
day.
"I wanted to get more involved
in the offense because I feel I'm
always going backwards," Foster
said. "I wanted to try and get the
ball forwards and get the attack
going, especially since they were
flooding the backs. We were try
ing to take shots from the out
side."
San Diego failed to take many
shots at all in sticking to its
defensive strategy. Senior goal
keeper Jennifer Poehler once
again did little in notching her
sixth shutout of the year.
While the Cardinal defense
continues to do the job, the
offense is still searching for a
breakthrough game.
"We're still struggling to fin
ish," Sawyers said. "We're get
ting players in great positions,
but we're just not quite putting
the final touches on it. Hopefully,
it's just a matter of time."
Though Stanford allowed the
Toreros to remain close until the
latter stages, Sawyers saluted his
team's effort.
"It wasn't our best game,"
Sawyers said. "We really strug
gled in the first half, and we
struggled a little bit in the second
half. That's the positive thing
that comes out of games like this.
We found a wav to win."
