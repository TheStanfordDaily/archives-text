# Merger 'running lean and mean'
## Stanford administrative offices streamline into ITSS 
### Frank Guinan Staff writer 
Chief Information Officer Glen Mueller presented
a preliminary outline of the structure of the recently
formed Information Technology Systems and Ser
vices and said he expects a staff realignment to be in
place by Dec. 1 at a town meeting Friday morning.
"We want to align ourselves for a successful
launch . . . [and] then re-evaluate [the organization]
in 18 months," Mueller told approximately 100 em
ployees.
The new organization merges the former depart
ments of Libraries and Information Resources, Data
Center, Networking and Communication Systems,
Business Information Applications (BISA)
and Network for Student Information.

Provost Condoleezza Rice formed ITSS last
month to facilitate computing services and update
the University's administrative computing technolo
gy to keep Stanford competitive, said Marilyn Wills,
former manager of training and publications at
EISA.
At the meeting, Mueller listed the purposes for
creating ITSS, which included reducing overall ad
ministrative costs and providing a new infrastruc
ture that is "intuitive and serves the diverse technol
ogy needs of Stanford's instruction, research and ad
ministrative activities."
"We need to increase the focus on raising service
level and customer satisfaction . . . and that includes
faculty, students, school and academic department
administrators," Mueller said.
Another reason delineated was
to improve software flexibility
and development productivity, he
added.
Mueller went on to describe
the offices and job descriptions of
those who will be under his direct
supervision. Finance and Busi
ness Operations, Human
Resources, and Architecture
Planning and Standards are the
three areas which will be part of
the new Office of the Chief Infor
mation Officer.
Five line operating units will

handle other tasks, including
Information Distribution Services
— headed by former Data Center
director John Sack — and Infor
mation Systems — headed by
former BISA director Dave
Koehler.
These two offices, Mueller said,
will be "running lean and mean"
and will be the ones primarily
looking into the construction and
assembly of ITSS.
"I need your help in seeing how
[the reorganization] will look,"
Mueller told his audience.
"[Koehler, Sack and I] will be
working very closely together to
build the Stanford of the future."
In addition to the task of
realignment, Mueller pointed out
other significant elements which

presently affect the workplace.
The administration of University
President Gerhard Casper and
the school's three-year budget
reduction program are among the
factors employees will have to
face on top of the inter-office
changes.
The next steps for completing
realignment are for an ITSS tran
sition project manager to be desig
nated and for project teams to be
formed to plan and implement the
realignments.
Beginning in January, ITSS
will look into upgrading adminis
trative computing services,
including those in the Office of
Financial Aids and other student
information systems.
"The plan is not to build from

scratch but to find marketplace
solutions," Mueller said.
Twenty-two application pro
grams throughout the University
are included in an upgrade plan
for the next five years. In addi
tion, ITSS plans to migrate
toward a client / server system.
No layoffs have occurred since
the start of the reorganization.
"We won't know until the realign
ment is complete" whether there
will be any layoffs, Mueller said.
"The purpose is not for layoffs.
We have a lot of work to be done."
He added that they do not
expect any current projects or ser
vices to be interrupted by the
realignment process. "That's our
first priority — for everything to
be business as usual."
