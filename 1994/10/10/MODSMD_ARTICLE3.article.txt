Chief Information Officer Glen Mueller presented
a preliminary outline of the structure of the recently
formed Information Technology Systems and Ser
vices and said he expects a staff realignment to be in
place by Dec. 1 at a town meeting Friday morning.
"We want to align ourselves for a successful
launch . . . [and] then re-evaluate [the organization]
in 18 months," Mueller told approximately 100 em
ployees.
The new organization merges the former depart
ments of Libraries and Information Resources, Data
Center, Networking and Communication Systems,
Business Information Applications (BISA)
and Network for Student Information.

Provost Condoleezza Rice formed ITSS last
month to facilitate computing services and update
the University's administrative computing technolo
gy to keep Stanford competitive, said Marilyn Wills,
former manager of training and publications at
EISA.
At the meeting, Mueller listed the purposes for
creating ITSS, which included reducing overall ad
ministrative costs and providing a new infrastruc
ture that is "intuitive and serves the diverse technol
ogy needs of Stanford's instruction, research and ad
ministrative activities."
"We need to increase the focus on raising service
level and customer satisfaction . . . and that includes
faculty, students, school and academic department
