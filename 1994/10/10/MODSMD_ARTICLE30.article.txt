The Cardinal women's
golf team has another shot
to prove its coach wrong.
After last week's convinc
ing 20-stroke victory in the
Nike Invitational, some are
questioning head coach Tim
Baldwin's previous assess
ment that the Cardinal
would be veiy rusty in its
opening tournament.
The significant margin
between Stanford and sec
ond-place UCLA proved that
the Cardinal is once again
capable of challenging for
the national championship.
The University of Washing
ton Intercollegiate, held
today through Wednesday,
gives sixth-ranked Stanford
another chance to defeat
some top-ranked opponents.
Sophomore Mhairi McKay,
despite some initial difficul
ties in the tourney last week,
again leads the Cardinal. The
pre-season First Team All-
American finished 19 strokes
back, for a 24th-place tie on
the Trysting Tree Golf
Course last weekend.
Her teammate, last
week's champion and fellow
sophomore pre-season All-
American Andrea Baxter
will start at number two.
Baxter won the Invitational
by six strokes over another
Cardinal, Jamille Jose. Jose,
a senior, will start at number
three for Stanford.
Junior Vicky Strada and
senior Amy Lawrence will fill
the final two starting spots.
The pair finished last week's
tournament tied for sixth
and eighth respectively.
The Stanford five will be
tested by third-ranked
UCLA, fourth-ranked Tulsa
and No. 12 Arizona at the
Intercollegiate.
"The competition should be
tough," Baldwin said. "[How
ever] the five on the team are
really a close-knit group and
can give any team a real fight."
