# Student misconduct standard makes rape, sexual assault hard to prosecute, some say
## 
### Jamie Taylor Staff writer 
Calling the code archaic and unfair,
critics of Stanford's student misconduct
policy say the University must change its
standard of proof — especially its applica
tion to rape and sexual assault on campus.
Since Harvard changed its policy two
years ago, Stanford is the only school in
the nation to have a standard of proof re
quiring "beyond a reasonable doubt" for
prosecuting those accused of violating a
University code. This is the same stan
dard used in California criminal courts.

"It's an impossible standard to meet in
99.9 percent of sexual assault cases on
campus," said Gail Prichard, coordinator
for the Campus Sexual Assault Response
and Recovery Team, a part of Cowell Stu
dent Health Center's Counseling and
Psychological Services.
Separate standards
.
The standard of "beyond a reasonable
doubt" usually indicates the need for ei
ther an eyewitness or physical evidence,
both of which are difficult to obtain in
cases of rape or sexual assault,
"especially in cases of acquaintance
rape," Prichard said.
"This burden of proof is com
pletely inappropriate in a universi
ty system," said second-year law
student Isabel Traugott, founder of
Sexual Assault Legal Advocates. "I
think it Ls really an irresponsible
thing to have a criminal standard
at a school."
Senior Angel Foster, who has
directed the Orientation program
"Sex in the '90s" for the last three
years, said although she appreciat
ed Stanford's "beyond a reasonable
doubt" standard for average com
plaints, "for issues of sexual assault
it's a very difficult burden of proof."
Within the last year, only two
rapes have been reported at the Uni
versity, said Stanford Police Capt.
Raoul Niemeyer. "I hear that a lot of
rapes and other things go on on
campus, but they can't be verified
unless they're reported," he said.
Prichard said she believes that
the low number of reports is not
indicative of the amount of sexual
assault that occurs on campus.
Instead, she said, students do not
notify the University because "they
don't have faith in our judicial sys
tem."
"Even though Stanford deals
with rape compassionately and
seriously, the standard of proof of
'beyond a reasonable doubt' Ls a
great deterrent for filing a Funda
mental Standard violation com
plaint," Prichard said.
"Definitely our standard of
proof is ridiculous," said senior Vir
ginia Duplessis, treasurer of the
Coalition Against Sexual Assault.
A better standard?
Most schools employ a "prepon
derance of evidence" standard,
meaning that the evidence must
demonstrate the guilt to be "more
likely than not, but not much more
likely," said Iris Brest, associate
general counsel to Stanford.
Brown University employs a "pre
ponderance of evidence" standard,
said Brown Assoc. Dean of Student

Life Toby Simon. Each year,
between six and 12 students report
sexual assault incidents, she said.
Princeton University, also using
the "preponderance of evidence"
standard, "does not require physi
cal evidence," said Janet
Waronker, director of Princeton's
Sexual Harassment Assault Advis
ing Resources Education.
"There should be a difference
between a legal proceeding and a
university disciplinary process,"
Waronker said. "You aren't out to
convict the student, but you should
ask, 'Did they violate a university
policy? Did they violate their
responsibility as a student?' "
Attempts at change
Although many Stanford stu-

dents lament the University's
apparent apathy to their com
plaints and concerns, the student
body has served as the obstacle to a
less strict standard of proof con
cerning sexual assault on campus.
Two years ago, the Committee of
15 — made up of faculty members
and chaired by I>aw Prof Deborah
L. Rhode — attempted to alter
Stanford's legal policy to make it
easier to find someone in violation
of a University code. The ASSU
Senate, however, voted to maintain
Stanford's current standards.
The Committee of 15 recom
mended lessening the burden of

proof from "beyond a reasonable
doubt." The committee suggested a
standard of "clear and convincing
evidence," a high burden of proof,
but not as stringent as "beyond a
reasonable doubt."
Graduate student Sanford Dick
ert, who served on the senate at the
time, said the ASSU voted the
alteration down because the revi
sions went beyond sexual assault.
"Nobody believed rape
shouldn't be addressed . .. but [the
proposed change] would make it
easier to prosecute all cases. It
wasn't because the senate didn't
want stronger faction] on sexual
assault cases," Dickert said. "The
way (Judicial Affairs Officer) Sally
Cole discussed it made it seem to
senators that it would make it eas-

'Nobody believed
rape shouldn't be
addressed ... but
[the proposed
change] would
make it easier to
prosecute all cases.'

ier for someone to get prosecuted."
A new standard?
The need for a high burden of
proof applies outside of a campus
setting when consequences include
jail and relinquishment of some
one's fundamental rights, Trau
gott said. However, when a univer
sity is trying to maintain a safe
community for people in their role
as students and not as citizens,
both the standards and the punish
ments should reflect this differ
ence, she added.
"The current standard of
'beyond a reasonable doubt' ought

to change," Cole said. "I think that
an intermediate standard of proof
provides ample protection for stu
dents that didn't commit a viola
tion. The standard now is so high
that it allows a lot of student mis
conduct that needs to be addressed
to go unproveable."
Prichard said she agrees that
Stanford's standard needs to be
lowered, especially in cases of sexu
al assault.
"If the standard was lessened,
survivors would feel that their
experience is met with an appropri
ate response by the institution,"
she said. "Right now, there are no
sanctions. Students need to know
that assaulting behaviors have con
sequences. This also serves as its
own deterrent for further assault."
Traugott agreed that Stanford
should attempt to change the poli
cy, but says that "if the University
really wants to take sexual assault
cases seriously, it should change the
standard simply for those cases."
Lessening the standard of proof
would make it easier for the Uni
versity to prosecute sexual offend
ers, but advocates doubt that it
would substantially increase the
number and nature of complaints.
"There is a general fear that
hearsay evidence would end up
convicting someone, especially
because sexual assault is one per
son's subjective experience versus
another's," Prichard said. "The
process is honorable and trustwor
thy. More than hearsay is and
would be required."
Beyond trusting that University
officials would not allow only cir
cumstantial evidence to convict
someone accused of sexual assault,
Traugott also said she believes that
false charges of rape probably
would not occur.
"People don't make frivolous
claims," Traugott said. "I can't see
a rash of claims coming forward if
the standard was changed."
"There's a lot of stigma attached
to people who report rapt 1 ," she
added. "It's the responsibility of a
university to overcome that stig
ma, especially at a place like Stan
ford that's supposed to be an intel
lectual and liberal place where we
have an opportunity to change peo
ple's concepts of sexual assault."
