# President, Provost give extra funds to four campus groups
## $450K total grant awarded to CTL and other organizations 
### Laura Shin Staff writer 
University President Gerhard Casper and Provost
Condoleezza Rice have awarded grants totaling
$450,000 to four on-campus organizations which
serve undergraduates.
"Organizations that have made a good case on
their commitment to undergraduate teaching" re
ceived awards, Rice said.
The Center for Teaching and Learning will receive
$150,000, while the Martin Luther King Jr. Papers
Project, Undergraduate Research Opportunities and
Stanford in Washington will each receive $100,000.
Rice said the funding for the awards comes from
the Stanford Annual Fund — "the principle source of
unrestricted funding not from tuition" — and the
source of a recent $200,000 grant to campus ethnic
centers.
The CTL award was decided last spring, while the
rest were awarded over the summer, Rice said. The
center is the only group which has had time to con
sider what to do with the additional funds.
"In these days of reduced funding, almost any kind
of additional funding is welcome," said Michele Mar
incovich, director of the center.
History Prof. Clay Carson, director of the papers
project, said he especially appreciates the grant be
cause it "demonstrates [thatj the administration . . .
recognizes the value of what you're doing."

The CTL plans to conduct "a survey of [teaching
assistants] to . . .update our knowledge about TAs —
what's good and where there are problems" and then
use the money to train teaching assistants for acade
mic departments, Marincovich said.

While CTL found out about the
grant previously, it waited "to lay a
foundation to use it well" with spe
cific goals already in mind, Marin
covich said.
"Undergraduates will benefit be
cause we will be able to do more
work with TAs and help them be
come better teachers," said Marin
covich.
The papers project allows under-

graduates to conduct original research connected to
the publication of the King papers. With this extra
funding, Carson said they plan to continue that effort.
Carson said it was "great to be recognized . . . par
ticularly because people think teaching takes place
only in the classrooms and lectures."
"Students learn much more by doing than hearing
how things are done," he added.
Laura Selznick, director of the URO, said she was
"just tickled and delighted" about the money.
Though she could not yet say what the URO in
tended to do with the money, she said the "honor and


Rice
responsibility" of having the
money serves as incentive for the
URO to "spend it wisely and well
and make [Casper and Rice] glad
they gave it to us."
The URO provides funding to
undergraduates working on origi
nal research, especially those
researching in preparations for

honors theses. Last year, the
office gave out $380,000 in grants
to 387 students; the money was
raised from sources outside of the
University.
The program has demonstrat
ed its dedication and importance
to undergraduate teaching, show
ing growth "while university
resources have been shrinking,"
Selznick said. This new money,
she added, "means more opportu
nities for students to do
research."
