### Sarah Katz Editorial staff 
Black Student Union leaders,
University administrators and
faculty members met Friday night
to discuss programming and plan
ning for the upcoming year, with
an emphasis on academic projects.
The "summit" was the first of
its kind for the organization, said
Vice Provost and Dean for Student
Affairs Mary Edmonds, who helped
organize the event at the request of
BSU President Jaasi Munanka.
"Jaasi asked me this summer if
I'd be willing to get faculty and
staff to come to this," Edmonds
said. "It was an opportunity for
faculty, staff and students to get
together and hear ideas about how
we could get more involved."
Dean of Students Michael Jack
son, who also attended the meeting,
said he has seen similar meetings in

the past and believes such summits
are important. "I think what it in
spired was that faculty, staff and
students need to get together on a
regular basis," he added.
The group spent the evening re
viewing program ideas presented
by the students and discussing
new initiatives. "It was a chance to
have a dialogue," said sophomore
BSU member Kesha Weekes.
"The faculty and staff were able to
point us in the right direction."
Weekes said that many of the
ideas which came out of the meet
ing were for academic projects
such as a study hall program
staffed by teaching assistants
from different departments.
"The load of it was a focus on
academics, on ways to help black
students out," she added.
Edmonds said faculty and ad
ministrators supported the acade
mic ideas presented by the stu

dents. "We want to see how we can
assist [students]," she said.
The BSU has also recently re
ceived support from black mem
bers of the University Board of
Trustees and from black alumni,
she said.
BSU members met last week
with the three black trustees to
"learn what black alumni want to
do to get more involved in the com
munity" and to help BSU mem
bers reach their goals, she said.
Weekes said she thought the
summit was productive, although
"not as much progress was made
as either side would have liked."
"It was Friday night. .. and no
body was putting their best foot
forward," she said.
Edmonds said she and other ad
ministrators hope to continue to
meet throughout the year.
