## New additions to the Zapata family 
### Karen Heywood Staff writer 
For returning "Zapatista" Sally
Matlin, the Casa Zapata "familia"
is still very much intact — and has
plenty of room to welcome Arcadio
and Ellen Morales.
"I feel like Casa Zapata is sort of
an extension of the love [the
Moraleses] show for [their 2-year
old son] Pablo," she said. "It's great
to have people that care so much."
Despite the controversy that led
to their appointment as the new
resident fellows of Casa Zapata —

Stanford's Chicano/Latino theme
house — the Moraleses are looking
forward to sharing their family
with the larger Zapata "familia."
"When we considered becoming
resident fellows, we really felt
strongly that the strength of our
own family would be a great char
acteristic to lend to Casa Zapata,"
Ellen Morales said.
The Moraleses were hired to re
place longtime resident fellows
Cecelia and Tony Burciaga after
Cecelia Burciaga's administrative
position with the University was
abruptly terminated last spring —

an event that sparked protest in
the Chicano/Latino community.
Stepping in to take over for the
popular Burciagas has not given
the Moraleses, who both work in
Stanford's Office of Development,
much time to adapt.
"We know that this is a transi
tion year but we're not focusing on
it as a year of transition," Ellen
Morales said. "We want very much
to just look ahead, to carry on the
traditions that have been estab
lished, and move forward; not be

mired in the past."
Sighting his 11 years of
involvement in Student Affairs,
including former positions as Bay
Area Regional Coordinator of the
Latina/Latino Leadership Oppor
tunity Program and Director of
Upward Bound, Arcadio Morales
said that he "thinks someone
with less experience would have
had a difficult time coming in
right away and carrying on."
He also has experience run
ning residential programs, work
ing in dorms and helping with
student development, he said.
In spite of the outcry from the
Chicano/Latino community at the
dismissal of the Burciagas, the
Moraleses have yet to encounter
any negativity, they said.
The recruitment and inter
viewing committee for prospec
tive Casa Zapata resident fellows
was comprised of Chicano/Latino
faculty members, students and
staff members, Arcadio Morales
said, calling it "a community rep
resentative body."
"My perception is that it was
sanctioned by the community,"
he said, "Otherwise I don't think
we would have applied for the
position."
Although residential staff
members at Casa Zapata were
hired prior to the appointment of
the Moraleses, they were "picked
with the knowledge that the Bur
ciagas would not be the resident
fellows, and they were interest
ed," Arcadio Morales said.
"[The staff is] very commit
ted," Ellen Morales said, "And
they bring so much with them."
Some staff members were
motivated to apply because the
Burciagas would not be return
ing, Arcadio Morales said.
"They themselves felt a
responsibility to lend some
continuity — to carry on some of
the working traditions that had
been established," he said.
Such traditions include the
annual Zoot Suit Week, a Hal
loween Haunted House for East

Palo Alto youth, Cinco de Mayo
Festivities and residence-based
programming — such as a Chicano
theater class being offered this
quarter in the Casa Zapata lounge.
The Moraleses hope to bring
some new traditions to Casa Zap
ata as well. Among them, they are
working to set up a pen-pal pro
gram with Chicano elementary
school students and a mentoring
program for sixth to eighth grade
bilingual students at Kennedy
Middle School in Redwood City.
The new RFs also hope to extend
Casa Zapata programming to grad
uate students, inviting them to
"grad chats" to talk to Zapata resi
dents about continuing education.
While the Moraleses currently
have a two-year arrangement
with the University, Arcadio
Morales said they'd "love to stay
here as long as we can continue to
be effective — as long as students
are receptive to having us."
But, said Ellen Morales, "I
think the [Chicano] community
at large feels the ideal resident
fellow for Casa Zapata would be a
Chicano faculty member, so we're
here with that understanding."
"A faculty member with tenure
is not as vulnerable as a staff
member," Arcadio Morales added.
Although some of Zapata's staff
members feel it is too early in the
year to draw conclusions about the
resident fellow change, Theme
Associate Matlin is optimistic.
"I'm excited that we have peo
ple who are excited about being
here," Matlin said.
The staff was unsure about
what to expect at the end of last
year, because "the University's
announcement of the Moraleses
getting the appointment was
poorly handled; the staff wasn't
even officially told until Arcadio
contacted us," she said.
Nonetheless, Matlin said she
thinks the Moraleses bring a
blend of old and new to a commu
nity in need of their support.
"The Burciagas were heaven,
so at first I was uneasy," Matlin
said, adding "It's like a different
tune, but the same kind of music.
[The Moraleses] have the same
concerns for the community, with
a different approach."

at large feels the ideal resident
fellow for Casa Zapata would be a
Chicano faculty member, so we're
here with that understanding."
"A faculty member with tenure
is not as vulnerable as a staff
member," Arcadio Morales added.
Although some of Zapata's staff
members feel it is too early in the
year to draw conclusions about the
resident fellow change, Theme
Associate Matlin is optimistic.
"I'm excited that we have peo
ple who are excited about being
here," Matlin said.
The staff was unsure about
what to expect at the end of last
year, because "the University's
announcement of the Moraleses
getting the appointment was
poorly handled; the staff wasn't
even officially told until Arcadio
contacted us," she said.
Nonetheless, Matlin said she
thinks the Moraleses bring a
blend of old and new to a commu
nity in need of their support.
"The Burciagas were heaven,
so at first I was uneasy," Matlin
said, adding "It's like a different
tune, but the same kind of music.
[The Moraleses] have the same
concerns for the community, with
a different approach."
For returning "Zapatista" Sally
Matlin, the Casa Zapata "familia"
is still very much intact — and has
plenty of room to welcome Arcadio
and Ellen Morales.
"I feel like Casa Zapata is sort of
an extension of the love [the
Moraleses] show for [their 2-year
old son] Pablo," she said. "It's great
to have people that care so much."
Despite the controversy that led
to their appointment as the new
resident fellows of Casa Zapata —

Stanford's Chicano/Latino theme
house — the Moraleses are looking
forward to sharing their family
with the larger Zapata "familia."
"When we considered becoming
resident fellows, we really felt
strongly that the strength of our
own family would be a great char
acteristic to lend to Casa Zapata,"
Ellen Morales said.
The Moraleses were hired to re
place longtime resident fellows
Cecelia and Tony Burciaga after
Cecelia Burciaga's administrative
position with the University was
abruptly terminated last spring —

an event that sparked protest in
the Chicano/Latino community.
Stepping in to take over for the
popular Burciagas has not given
the Moraleses, who both work in
Stanford's Office of Development,
much time to adapt.
"We know that this is a transi
tion year but we're not focusing on
it as a year of transition," Ellen
Morales said. "We want very much
to just look ahead, to carry on the
traditions that have been estab
lished, and move forward; not be

mired in the past."
Sighting his 11 years of
involvement in Student Affairs,
including former positions as Bay
Area Regional Coordinator of the
Latina/Latino Leadership Oppor
tunity Program and Director of
Upward Bound, Arcadio Morales
said that he "thinks someone
with less experience would have
had a difficult time coming in
right away and carrying on."
He also has experience run
ning residential programs, work
ing in dorms and helping with
student development, he said.
In spite of the outcry from the
Chicano/Latino community at the
dismissal of the Burciagas, the
Moraleses have yet to encounter
any negativity, they said.
The recruitment and inter
viewing committee for prospec
tive Casa Zapata resident fellows
was comprised of Chicano/Latino
faculty members, students and
staff members, Arcadio Morales
said, calling it "a community rep
resentative body."
"My perception is that it was
sanctioned by the community,"
he said, "Otherwise I don't think
we would have applied for the
position."
Although residential staff
members at Casa Zapata were
hired prior to the appointment of
the Moraleses, they were "picked
with the knowledge that the Bur
ciagas would not be the resident
fellows, and they were interest
ed," Arcadio Morales said.
"[The staff is] very commit
ted," Ellen Morales said, "And
they bring so much with them."
Some staff members were
motivated to apply because the
Burciagas would not be return
ing, Arcadio Morales said.
"They themselves felt a
responsibility to lend some
continuity — to carry on some of
the working traditions that had
been established," he said.
Such traditions include the
annual Zoot Suit Week, a Hal
loween Haunted House for East

Palo Alto youth, Cinco de Mayo
Festivities and residence-based
programming — such as a Chicano
theater class being offered this
quarter in the Casa Zapata lounge.
The Moraleses hope to bring
some new traditions to Casa Zap
ata as well. Among them, they are
working to set up a pen-pal pro
gram with Chicano elementary
school students and a mentoring
program for sixth to eighth grade
bilingual students at Kennedy
Middle School in Redwood City.
The new RFs also hope to extend
Casa Zapata programming to grad
uate students, inviting them to
"grad chats" to talk to Zapata resi
dents about continuing education.
While the Moraleses currently
have a two-year arrangement
with the University, Arcadio
Morales said they'd "love to stay
here as long as we can continue to
be effective — as long as students
are receptive to having us."
But, said Ellen Morales, "I
think the [Chicano] community
at large feels the ideal resident
fellow for Casa Zapata would be a
Chicano faculty member, so we're
here with that understanding."
"A faculty member with tenure
