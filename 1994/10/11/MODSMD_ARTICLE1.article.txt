# Hewlett, Packard donation to fund new quad
## $77.4 million to construct engineering, science facilities, raze old structures 
### Scott Van Winkle Staff writer 
Capping a decade-long drive to reshape
a large portion of the Stanford campus,
University President Gerhard Casper yes
terday announced a $77.4 million grant
that will allow the University to build a
new science and engineering campus west
of the Quad.
Stanford alumni and Silicon Valley en
trepreneurs David Packard and William
Hewlett jointly offered the gift — the
largest single donation in the University's
history — which will pay for most of the
planned $110 million facility.
Four new buildings will be erected and
five existing structures — the Physics
Tank, Sequoia Hall, the Electronics Re
search Laboratory and the Applied Elec
tronics Laboratory and the Electrical En
gineering Department offices — will be
demolished by 1999 to create a new arena
for academic interaction.

The Physics Tank will be demolished to
make way for a palm-lined walkway that
will connect the existing Quad with the
new science and engineering facility,
which remains as yet unnamed.
New lecture space will be provided at a
teaching complex near the soon-to-be
completed Gates Information Science
Building.
The two buildings flanking the Physics
Tank — the McCullough Building and
Varian Laboratory — will be renovated to
provide updated laboratory space for ma
terials science research.
The electrical engineering department
will be housed in a new, separate building,
as opposed to its current spread over

seven different facilities. Completing the
additions will be a new statistics depart
ment building — replacing Sequoia Hall
— located next to the mathematics de
partment in the Quad.
Construction will take place along the
lines of plans created at the University's
centennial, and should be completed by
the time the University enters the next
millennium.
The gift caps a remarkable string of do
nations from the pair of entrepreneurs. In
1986, Packard gave $70 million to found
the Lucile Salter Packard Children's Hos
pital at the Medical Center, and the two
combined last year to pay for the $25-mil
lion Terman Fellows program, which is
meant to encourage young engineering
professors in their research.
In total, Hewlett and Packard have do
nated more than $300 million to the Uni
versity, Vice President for Development
John Ford estimated.
A long time in the making
Plans for a "second quad" were
launched in 1986 with a $40- million
"Centennial Campaign" contribution
from Hewlett.
But many unforeseen changes — such
as the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake and
the indirect-cost controversy — delayed
the plans.
"We didn't have the money to proceed
with (the project) with a reasonable sense
of priorities," said James Gibbons, dean of
the School of Engineering.
The current plan has been altered from
the earlier "near west campus" plan pri
marily by the decision to renovate existing
buildings instead of building new ones,
Gibbons said.
Physics Department Chair Douglas
Osheroff said the earlier plan caused a
"near revolt" in the Faculty Senate when
a report found the plan might increase the
percentage of research funds used to pay
for overhead costs.
As the plans underwent revision,
Hewlett and Packard stepped in with
funding. Joseph Jezukewich, who retired
this August from directing the Universi
ty's Electrical Engineering Research Ad
ministration, described an apocryphal
event that may have hastened the pro
ject's completion.
When Packard visited the campus a
few years ago to attend the dedication of
the Green Earth Sciences Building, he is
said to have noticed the nearby electrical
engineering laboratories and remarked,
"I didn't realize those buildings were still
there."
President Casper described the donors'
role as pivotal, saying the gift will "renew

facilities that were aging and that we
could not possibly have renewed without
support before the next century."
The University still must provide $32
million to complete the project — money
which will come from the capital budget,
other donations and a $2 million grant
from the National Science Foundation.
The expenditure was approved by the
Board of Trustees at its meeting last Mon
day. The design, created by New York
based architect James Ingo Freed, was
chosen from among four possibilities by
University Architect David Neuman and
presented to the board at that same meet
ing.
David Zinman, a student at the Gradu
ate School of Business and member of the
board's subcommittee on buildings and
land, said that the project must still earn
final approval by the board before ground
can be broken. And while cost concerns
were not foremost on the board's mind at
the Monday meeting, more detailed ac
counting will likely be included in later ap
provals, he said.

Adjusting to the changes
Osheroff said he was not entirely sur
prised when he learned of the changes. He
had expected an announcement about two
weeks ago, he said, and had heard that the
Physics Tank might be demolished in ear
lier discussions of the near west campus
plan.
He had "sentimental" reasons to tem
per his enthusiasm for the new facilities,
as well as the annoyance of having to find
parking for some 100 vehicles that will
probably be blocked from using the Vari
an parking lot, OsherofTsaid.
Nevertheless, he said he appreciated
Hewlett's and Packard's generosity, and
looked forward to the new facilities.
One problem the plan will solve, Os
herofT said, is the contention over the
physics department's virtually exclusive
use of the physics tank. Large biology and
chemistry lectures previously had to be di -
verted "all across campus," he said, be
cause physics demonstrations took so long
to set up.
Along with updated audio-visual capa

bilities, the new lecture complex will pro
vide a "false wall" that will allow instruc
tors to prepare demonstrations while
other lectures are going on, he said.
Along with a 450-seat lecture hall, the
complex will include another hall seating
200 people and three smaller lecture
rooms.
Gibbons praised the overall conception
of the new facility. The corner of the new
quad that brings together electrical engi
neering, the Gates building and the Cen
ter for Integrated System will soon be
come a "nucleus" of innovative, interdis
ciplinary research, he said.
With the University's "extremely rare"
combination of faculty, students and facil
ities, Gibbons said, the University has "an
outstanding opportunity for making
major contributions to the future of those
fields."
A specific area of research that Gibbons
said the new intermingling of disciplines
could help is the development of precise
