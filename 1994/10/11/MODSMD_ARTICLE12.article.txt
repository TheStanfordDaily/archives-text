## Editorial TA's need assistance 
### 
Departments should
establish practices to
ensure quality of TA's

THE QUALITY OF teaching
assistants at Stanford is as
diverse as the meatloaf in
Wilbur Dining Hall. Some TA's
speak with the confidence and
understanding of a well-versed
professor, while others appear to
have abandoned their communi
cation skills back in grade school.
Whether competent or not,
teaching assistants play a crucial
role in every undergraduate's
education. Given the size of many
classes, TA's are inevitably left to
handle important administrative
details, the most obvious of which
is grading.
Based on this power, TA's have
the unique ability to influence the
future of countless young minds.
Are you aspiring to a top graduate
school or law school? Not if your
TA disapproves of your writing
style.
This situation is exacerbated
by the inconsistent quality of
TA's, which causes students to
question in whose hands their
education ultimately lies. To pay
top-dollar for the opinion of a
first-year graduate student —
although not necessarily prob
lematic — certainly merits skepti
cism.
Obviously the solution does not
reside in the elimination of teach
ing assistants. Besides being wild
ly unfeasible, this proposal would
undermine a system which does
work when implemented proper
ly-
Instead, the respective academ
ic departments must ensure that
all TA's begin on a common
ground, with a fundamental
understanding of their purpose.
More thorough preparation of
TA's, for example, would help
ensure that they have basic pre

sentation and communication
skills necessary for successful
instruction.
Moreover, weaker TA's must
learn to approach their sections
as part of a larger framework
which, ideally, should treat every
student consistently. When one
TA lacks mastery over an impor
tant subject, the section is imme
diately put at a disadvantage to
the others.
Because TA's are often the only
direct source of knowledge for
students, those who fail to take
their role seriously jeopardize the
learning process. This is not to
say that responsibility for learn
ing lies fully with the teacher and
never with the student. Rather,
Stanford simply owes its under
graduates consistency with
regard to learning opportunities.
This concern speaks equally to
the issue of language-mastery,
which continues to be a problem
in too many courses. Although
the TA's in primarily quantitative
classes need not speak fluent
English to understand concepts
and theories, communication dif
ficulties inhibit their ability to
pass this knowledge along.
This is not a question of lan
guage snobbery or intolerance.
The simple truth is that no Stan
ford student deserves second-rate
instruction due to language barri
ers.
For obvious reasons, Stan
ford's undergraduate students
must have full mastery over the
English language — but appar
ently this rule does not apply as
stringently to teaching assistants.
While TA's certainly do not need
to speak impeccable English in
order to teach successfully, there
should be a guideline set in order
to ensure they meet reasonable
standards.
For good or bad, TA's have an
extraordinary influence on the
undergraduate education at Stan
ford. Academic administrators
should take careful steps to
ensure the former.
