Fair is fair: student supports grading policy changes

I BELIEVE IN being fair only when I
get the short end of the stick, and
I'm getting it right now. In lay
man's terms, its called "getting shaft
ed. " It happens when you walk into any
class that's graded on a curve and a
third of those taking it are there for the
second or third time. Call me unreason
able — but is this fair?
Under our previous grading system,
there existed no penalty for taking a
class as many times as one could
endure it. This system was self-perpet
uating. It pushed the "first timers" tak
ing a given class down on the curve,
while rewarding high grades to repeat
offenders. Is it any surprise that such
"first timers" became repeat offenders
too?
I don't give a damn about grade
inflation. The fact that we have the

same "inflation" as every other top
institution makes it 100 percent moot.
Besides, who here has not joked that
$112,000 over a four year period is a
heck of a lot of money to pay for a piece
of paper with the word "Stanford" on
it, while also being forced to admit that
they think it's well worthwhile. I can't
imagine a business corporation or grad
uate school saying "Well, he went to
Stanford but you know I hear there's
grade inflation there, so let's take the
guy from San Jose State instead." And
my sarcasm isn't arrogance, for all you
nittpickers out there — it's reality.
What truly matters, in other words, is
how we come out of Stanford relative to
one another.
I thought it sucked (there being no
pleasant way to say it) that when I
entered a science or math class I would

more than likely be up against
"repeaters." Shouldn't they be the ones
handicapped with an "RP" rather than
me being handicapped by the fact that I
have better things to do with my time
than take a class for the third time?
As for experimentation, just by
numbers alone — for those of us who
can't afford to stay here forever — a
given student will take more classes,
hence a greater diversity of classes, if
he/she can't repeat classes already
taken.
In addition, will Faculty Senate
chair Robert Simoni please be reason
able? His statement that choosing
courses according to an obsession with
grades is wrong is as naive a statement
as I have ever heard. It's easy for him
to say — he's already a Stanford pro
fessor. Is he also going to shake his fin

ger at businesses, and tell them that
they should weigh an applicant's pur
suit of intellectual curiosity more heav
ily? Is he the one who has to call home
to parents — who are already upset
over the University bill they received a
couple of weeks ago — and tell them
that a C plus is all right because their
son is in pursuit of knowledge? Like it
or not, the majority of Stanford's
undergraduates are pre-professionals,
not scholars.
To conclude this windy letter, I want
to say that I am in favor of the new
grading policy — it's about time that
we stopped getting pampered like two
year-olds. To all you students who
think I'm a turncoat — Whhhhhaah!
I've got some Gerber for you.
