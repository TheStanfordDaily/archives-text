## Preserving a spiritual high 
### 
Trekking through the
Himalayas of India and Nepal
this past year, I found myself
constantly lambasting "American cul
ture." Growing accustomed to meeting
strangers who would spontaneously
invite me in for free food and lodging, I
was integrated into a new family night
ly. Cultural and language barriers were
transcended by a general respect for
humanity — my hosts recognized my
needs and provided for them without
question. I was so overcome by the gen
eral calm amongst these natives that I
couldn't help contrasting it with the
stress of life in the United States. My
ability to connect with these people was
so powerful that at times I doubted its
reality.
Amidst the sense of community I felt
there, I dreaded the thought of return
ing to the self-centeredness and super
ficiality of the U.S. "That's not me," I
said. "I'm not a part of that." I clung to
the hope that my six months of travel
had been sufficient to counteract the 23
previous years of hectic life. How could
I preserve that high? Surrounded by
snowcapped mountains, the frenzy of
home seemed ridiculous and dysfunc
tional.
I thought specifically of the Bay
Area — with its sprawling suburbs —
where shrubs or a fence mean "this is
my land, stay away." Or the shopping
malls, where hundreds of individuals
brush arms but don't really interact,
just forging independent trajectories
through the maze of superstores. Or
Stanford itself, with competition for
grades, tenure and the Axe. It was all

disturbing to ponder. Yet I returned,
completely of my own volition. Why
did I freely choose to get on a plane to
return to a society which so outra
geously represents the chaos I detest?
Basically, I was convinced that I could
import and preserve the values I had
witnessed throughout my travels. I
pledged to keep the crazed pace of aca
demics and student life at bay, and
maintain the commitment to meaning
ful human contact that the world's
highest mountains had inspired.
I would not be controlled by our fre
netic culture, I convinced myself. I
would be exceedingly respectful of
myself, my local community and the
global environment. Yet I already felt
myself slipping. After promising to
leave early for class to avoid a tense
last-minute rush, I found myself speed
ing down Sand Hill Road 10 minutes
late. After committing myself to leav
ing sufficient time for my friends, my
appointment book was reduced to one
tedious commitment after another.
After pledging to seek only sincere and
constructive interaction with my peers,
I heard myself in the hallway regurgi
tating, "Fine, how are you?" to the
question "What's up?" What a mockery
of the commitment to meaningful dia
logue that I had so emphatically made.
The instinctive reaction in a situa
tion like this may be to feel powerless,
at the mercy of our greater system. Is it
our "fault" if incessant stress leads us
to occasionally answer a question with
a completely illogical answer? Isn't the
continual compression of time and
space an inevitable byproduct of the

modern world? Does the jetstream of
activity even allow for reflection on
these issues? Ultimately, the common
culture is blamed, and any remnants of
responsibility are transferred. We miss
an appointment, call someone the
wrong name, throw paper into the
trash rather than the recycling bin, and
chalk it up to unmanageable stress
imposed by society at large. As if we
had no choice.
Returning here from my trip, I fell
for the same trap. This is the USA, I
told myself. I'm part of the car culture,
the fast-pace culture, the competition
culture, the capital culture. I can't
fight that. I'd just have to accept my
tailpipe emissions, my self-centered
appointment book and the general blur
of existence as unavoidable. American
common culture was a giant, and I was
just another pawn.
What a copout! I had sold-out, given
up and surrendered. I had abandoned
the values that I had learned on my
trip. We, as individuals, still control
our lives through individual choice.
The stresses of our common culture are
not forced upon us. We are all capable
of decisions which bring peace back
into our lives. Otherwise, we have only
ourselves to blame.
