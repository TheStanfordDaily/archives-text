## Cardinal travels to Texas Tennis looks to affirm selves as lone star 
### Courtney Mann 
The Stanford men's tennis team will jump-start its
season this week by taking its No. 1 national ranking on
the road to the Indoor Tennis Association Ail-American
Championships at the University of Texas.
Despite only four short days of practice, assistant
coach John Whitlinger and five members of the nine
person squad traveled to Texas early yesterday morning
to attend this tournament, which annually features the
best collegiate tennis talent from around the country.
Stanford's representatives, three juniors and two fresh
men, provide an interesting combination of experience
and youth.
Starting today, 64 players will compete for four spots
in Thursday's 32-man championship bracket. Junior
Jeff Salzenstein and freshman Scott Humphries have
received guaranteed positions in the championships,
while juniors Jim Thomas and Ricky Becker and fresh
man Paul Goldstein will attempt to work their way
through the competition. Humphries and Goldstein will
also test themselves in the doubles competition as they
received an automatic bid in that championship brack
et.
Based on their limited amount of practice, the play
ers as well as the coach do not feel substantial pressure
to produce superior results.
"We're going to see the competition and do the best we
can," Whitlinger said. "This tournament is so early, and
our main focus is way down the road in May [when the

NCAA Championships take place]." Whitlinger also men
tioned that within the four practice days, the coaching
staff made some significant changes in the players' games
that will require time in order to achieve precision.
The players echo this opinion of working towards a high
er goaL "We're just looking at it as a step to building a bet
ter team," Salzenstein said
Lack of pressure, however, does not coincide with a
lack of expectations for this year's squad. The entire
team received a No. 1 preseason ranking, while the indi
viduals that make up the whole boast an impressive list
of credentials as well. Salzenstein is ranked 24th in the
country. Humphries, Goldstein and Thomas follow at
42nd, 45th and 53rd respectively. As a doubles team, the
Humphries and Goldstein duo cracked the preseason
top 10 at number nine.
The young careers of Goldstein and Humphries have
already seen much success, as they are no strangers to big
tournaments. Goldstein embarks upon his college career
with three consecutive U.S. National Junior champi
onships under his belt. Humphries reigns as the Junior
Wimbledon champion. Their play as a doubles team has
brought them a U.S. National Junior championship in
that category as well.
Loaded with such talent, the squad in general is
eager to compete.
"It's a good opportunity to see the competition's new
players," Whitlinger said. "I'm also looking forward to
seeing how our juniors have done over the summer and
to watch our freshmen play."
