"This might sound trite, because
our record was so bad in pre-league
play, but we are looking to starting
anew. As a team we really think we
can win the [Mountain Division]."
Sophomore goalkeeper Ryan
Craig's words might seem overly
confident considering his team has
only two victories to its name. How
ever, entering conference play this
weekend right after one win and
one tie, the Stanford men's soccer
squad (2-8-2) has good reason to be
upbeat. The Cardinal defeated Cal
State Sacramento 3-1 last Friday
and fought Air Force to a 1-1 tie on
Sunday.
"All along we've felt we're a good
team," said freshman midfielder
Eric Vandevelde. "We've just not
gotten the results we wanted."
Defeating the Hornets was defi
nitely a result the team wanted and
needed. Counting on weekend vic
tories to be the springboard into a
winning streak in conference play,
the Cardinal's hopes and expecta
tions do not seem unfounded.
Versus the Hornets, the Cardi
nal executed well on both offense
and defense and dominated the
pace of the game. Stanford thwart
ed Cal State by controlling the ball
for most of the game, forcing the
I lornets to adjust their game plan.
"Sac. State is traditionally one of
the lesser teams in the conference
but we've had trouble with them,"
Craig said. "We played through the
middle, we controlled the midfield,
and we frustrated them — they had
to change their style."
The Cardinal's freshmen took
the lead in this frustration effort.
This season, Stanford has started
and played most of its freshmen,
fielding as many as six on at the
same time because of injuries to
established starters. These young
players have emerged as standouts
on the squad, as evidenced by Van
develde's two goals against the
Hornets. The third goal was scored
by senior midfielder Jeff Kogl.
"Our freshmen have stepped up
and done some pretty significant

things," Craig said.
Stanford also held defensively
against the Hornets' direct, long
ball attack by spotting the tactic
early and shutting it down in the
backfield.
On Sunday, Stanford survived
the tremendous home field advan
tage of high altitude enjoyed by the
Falcons. Another sign of the Cardi
nal's improving and more consis
tent play is the fact that the potent
Falcon attack only managed to slip
in one goal — a significant feat con

sidering three Falcons rank
amongst the top-10 scorers of the
Mountain Division.
Stanford played well in the
game but did not come up with a
score to match the Falcons' lone
goal until late in the game. Junior
forward Carmen D'Onofrio
scored on a clutch shot taken with
only 15 minutes left in regulation
time. Neither team scored in
overtime.
"We played very well in the first
half," Craig said, "then we fell apart

a little in the second half. We domi
nated in overtime though and had
some very, very good opportunities
to put the game away."
Head coach Colin Lindores felt
the team executed well against a
Falcon squad that was not playing
badly considering the conditions
that were very unfavorable to the
Stanford players.
"The number one thing about
this weekend is that we didn't come

out with any injuries," Lindores
said. "We played two good
games."
Stanford demonstrated to
itself this weekend that it can
play up to the level of its potential
and that it can surmount the sig

nificant mental hurdle of a losing
record.
"I don't know what caused it,
but we just put our record behind
us and didn't have everything
hanging over our heads," Vande
velde said. "When we won, part of
the reaction was just realizing we
were doing what we can do, and
part of it was being ecstatic."
