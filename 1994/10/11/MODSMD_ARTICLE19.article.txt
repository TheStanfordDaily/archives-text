### Allison Otto 
This year's club ice hockey season promises
to be one of the most exciting, if not the best, in
recent Stanford history.
Coming off last year's sixth-place finish in
the Club Hockey Nationals after a disappoint
ing loss to the University of Kentucky, team
captains Eric Haug and Luke Winter are opti
mistic about the upcoming season.
"I believe we can do even better this year
than last year," Haug said.
Winter commented that the team has at
least three solid lines of both offense and
defense, although they have had to spend the
past several days dragging prospective players
"out of the woodwork." The team is currently
ranked sixth in the nation.
One of the team's new recruits is Sami Jo

Small, the first female goal tender ever to play
on the traveling team. A freshman, Small
played AAA Midget hockey last year in Canada,
an experience which will possibly lead her to
standout status this year on the Stanford team.
"I'm very excited about this opportunity,"
said Small. "It'll definitely be an interesting
experience, since I'm used to a different style of
hockey."
Small has been on the ice since the age of
four, and is accustomed to being the only
female on the team. "It's nothing new to me,
but it probably will be for some of the guys,"
she said.
Another player to watch will be team co-cap
tain Luke Winter, a senior who led the Pacific
Coast Hockey Association last year in scoring,
making a significant contribution in the Cardi
nal'sl7-9 season.

Other returning players include sophomore
Brian Browder, junior Stefan Teitge, and
senior Kane Lai, all of whom are forwards.
Head coach Ernie Ferrari is optimistic about
this year's squad, despite the fact that it lost
several players to graduation. "Last year we
never played as a complete team until Nation
als," he said. "This season looks very promis
ing. We have more depth this year than we did
last year, which is encouraging."
Although most of the team's players have
experience playing hockey, Haug and Winter
would like to emphasize that anyone is welcome
to come practice with the team. Practices are
held at the Ice Oasis in Redwood City every Mon
day at 10:20 p.m. and Wednesday at 9:50 p.m.
The season, which usually lasts throughout fall
and winter quarters, officially begins on Oct. 21
when the team travels to the University of Oregon.
