# Mourning, memories
## Friends, family honor McCormick 
### Amy Slucter 
Under the expansive domes of
Memorial Church, friends and fam
ily gathered together yesterday to
celebrate the life of Bart Mc-
Cormick.
Rather than a time of sadness,
the memorial service was a time to
honor the strength and courage of
McCormick, a Stanford sophomore
who died of cancer this summer.
Although he was only 20, Mc-
Cormick was called an "old soul"
throughout the service, largely be
cause his four-year battle with can
cer had given him wisdom and
knowledge that was uncommon
among others his age.
"Bart had thought more deeply
and more widely about what life is
and what makes life worth living
than anyone I've ever met," Eng
lish Prof. David Schmid wrote in a
memorial tribute. "His maturity
and deeply felt humanity were both
astonishing and moving."
During the service, seven of Mc-
Cormick's closest friends shared
memories of his introspective na
ture and his inherent charisma —
painting a picture of an incompara
ble and irreplaceable individual.

one of her son's best friends and fraternity brothers, at a memorial
service Monday. McCormick died during the summer of cancer.
"What kind of courage, what
kind of energy Bart had," said
sophomore Ed Maklauf. "Bart
could see that the tedium of life
was its very fabric.... I hope more
than anything that Bart knew that
I loved him and that we all loved
him."
Sophomore Layla Burr affirmed
McCormick's reputation as an
intensely airing person. "He was
full of expression and life and had a
strong sense of compassion for oth
ers," she said.
McCormick, a Sigma Chi
pledge, lived in Twain last year.
"Bart had style," said junior
Gavin Turner, one of McCormick's
closest friends in the fraternity.
"Style in the way he dressed him
self and in the way he carried him
self. Me always seemed genuinely
interested in other people."
At the memorial service, the

brothers of Sigma Chi performed
their traditional White Rose Cere
mony. Each member stood holding
a single white rose while the con
gregation recited the Lord's
Prayer, then placed their roses
next to McCormick's urn.
"For over 130 years we have
used this ceremony to celebrate
and mourn the passing of a broth
er," said Turner. "It was very sym
bolic for us because most of us
know Bart through the fraterni
ty."
Jess Jones, McCormick's step
father and a Sigma Chi member,
also took part in the ceremony. "I
have been in Sigma Chi longer
than many of you have been
alive," a visibly moved Jones
said. "I would like to thank you
all because that was a very mean
ingful Sigma Chi experience for
me."
Jones described McCormick as
a fierce competitor and a scholar.
Jones and his wife Marcie,
McCormick's mother, both said
they felt it was McCormick's

determination to spend a year at
Stanford that made it possible for
him to fight his cancer with such
vigor.
McCormick's family said they
made a "pilgrimage" from his
home town of Carmel, Ind. to Stan
ford for the memorial service —
both so his friends here could also
express their love for him and so all
of the mourners could find a sense
of "closure."
Yesterday was a particularly
significant day for the service
because it was also McCormick's
mother's birthday. "He and I had a
wonderful relationship," said Mar
cie Jones. "I was with him through
every moment that I could be. We
did chemotheraphy and blood
transfusions at home."
McCormick suffered from
osteogonic sarcoma, a form of can
cer that grows on the bone. He was
diagnosed with the disease at age
16 and, in order to combat the ill
ness, had a knee replacement that
same year. After this surgery, the
cancer receded.

On the night that McCormick
was originally scheduled to leave
for Stanford, however, the cancer
reappeared and he was forced to
put off enrollment for a year.
Determined to make it to Stanford,
he arrived a year later, after
months spent in and out of the
hospital.
Although McCormick was still
not free from his illness and had to
undergo two lung operations last
year, friends said he refused to
allow his life to be defined by his
disease. "When you looked at Bart,
you didn't see a sick person," said
Burr. "Bart wanted to stand on his
own and live a normal, healthy
life."
"I think that Bart's desperate
desire to live ... his unwillingness
to give up, is a real part of our cele
bration here at Stanford together,"
said Rev. Cleda Anderson, the fam
ily's minister and close friend.
"The truth is that while many of
us prayed for a miracle in his body,
he became a miracle in both body
and soul."

At the memorial service, the

brothers of Sigma Chi performed
their traditional White Rose Cere
mony. Each member stood holding
a single white rose while the con
gregation recited the Lord's
Prayer, then placed their roses
next to McCormick's urn.
"For over 130 years we have
used this ceremony to celebrate
and mourn the passing of a broth
er," said Turner. "It was very sym
bolic for us because most of us
know Bart through the fraterni
ty."
Jess Jones, McCormick's step
father and a Sigma Chi member,
also took part in the ceremony. "I
have been in Sigma Chi longer
than many of you have been
alive," a visibly moved Jones
said. "I would like to thank you
all because that was a very mean
ingful Sigma Chi experience for
me."
Jones described McCormick as
a fierce competitor and a scholar.
Jones and his wife Marcie,
McCormick's mother, both said
they felt it was McCormick's

determination to spend a year at
Stanford that made it possible for
him to fight his cancer with such
vigor.
McCormick's family said they
made a "pilgrimage" from his
home town of Carmel, Ind. to Stan
ford for the memorial service —
both so his friends here could also
express their love for him and so all
of the mourners could find a sense
of "closure."
Yesterday was a particularly
significant day for the service
because it was also McCormick's
mother's birthday. "He and I had a
wonderful relationship," said Mar
cie Jones. "I was with him through
every moment that I could be. We
did chemotheraphy and blood
transfusions at home."
McCormick suffered from
osteogonic sarcoma, a form of can
cer that grows on the bone. He was
diagnosed with the disease at age
16 and, in order to combat the ill
ness, had a knee replacement that
same year. After this surgery, the
cancer receded.

On the night that McCormick
was originally scheduled to leave
for Stanford, however, the cancer
reappeared and he was forced to
put off enrollment for a year.
Determined to make it to Stanford,
he arrived a year later, after
months spent in and out of the
hospital.
Although McCormick was still
not free from his illness and had to
undergo two lung operations last
year, friends said he refused to
allow his life to be defined by his
disease. "When you looked at Bart,
you didn't see a sick person," said
Burr. "Bart wanted to stand on his
own and live a normal, healthy
life."
"I think that Bart's desperate
desire to live ... his unwillingness
to give up, is a real part of our cele
bration here at Stanford together,"
said Rev. Cleda Anderson, the fam
ily's minister and close friend.
"The truth is that while many of
us prayed for a miracle in his body,
he became a miracle in both body
and soul."
