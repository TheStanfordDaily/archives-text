# Mourning, memories
## Friends, family honor McCormick 
### Amy Slucter 
Under the expansive domes of
Memorial Church, friends and fam
ily gathered together yesterday to
celebrate the life of Bart Mc-
Cormick.
Rather than a time of sadness,
the memorial service was a time to
honor the strength and courage of
McCormick, a Stanford sophomore
who died of cancer this summer.
Although he was only 20, Mc-
Cormick was called an "old soul"
throughout the service, largely be
cause his four-year battle with can
cer had given him wisdom and
knowledge that was uncommon
among others his age.
"Bart had thought more deeply
and more widely about what life is
and what makes life worth living
than anyone I've ever met," Eng
lish Prof. David Schmid wrote in a
memorial tribute. "His maturity
and deeply felt humanity were both
astonishing and moving."
During the service, seven of Mc-
Cormick's closest friends shared
memories of his introspective na
ture and his inherent charisma —
painting a picture of an incompara
ble and irreplaceable individual.
