# Memories become nightmares
## Sailers place third 
### Daniel Kao 
The Stanford sailing team got
caught in a time-warp this past
weekend at the Stoney Burke
Invitational, forced to face old
adversaries it thought were long
gone. The Cardinal could have
done without this trip down
memory lane as it finished third,
28 points behind first-place Long
Beach State, in this clash of
Pacific Coast sailing powers.
After winning the regatta last
year, Stanford had hoped to
repeat and finish atop the field of
14 teams. Those hopes were
quickly dashed by the surprise
return of 49er skippers Kirk
Gooding and Kevin Taugher.
Gooding and Taugher were
seniors last year, and had been
expected by many — including
the major college sailing polls
who had left Long Beach State
unranked — to have graduated.
However, the two still had half a
season of eligibility left, just
enough time to ruin the Cardi
nal's chances.
"I think it was a big surprise
for a lot of people to see those two
sailing again this season," said
coach Steve Bourdow. "They are
definitely the best on Long Beach
State's team. I thought they had
graduated last season, and I'd
never have to see them back
again."

But they were back, and along
with two star skippers from the
second-place UC-Irvine team,
Andy Beckman and Peter Wells,
they wreaked havoc for the Car
dinal team right from the start.
The two Southern Californian
teams took advantage of the light
wind conditions and racked up
some fast starts to cruise ahead
early in the competition. After
the first day of the regatta, which
featured the Flying Junior two
person boats, the frustrated
Stanford team was already down
by 20 points.
"The fast start by the other
two teams definitely had an
effect on us," Bourdow said.
"The UC-Irvine team particular
ly focused on us from the outset,
playing a variety of mental
games. That's what they do best,
and at this stage of the season,
we didn't handle it very well."
To compound the difficulties
for Stanford, the Division A team
of senior skipper Charles Meade
and sophomore crew Letitia
Yang, which had been expected
to carry much of the load for the
young Cardinal team, had solid
but unimpressive races.
"It was disappointing," Meade
said. "We just weren't as fast as
we needed to be. I didn't feel like
