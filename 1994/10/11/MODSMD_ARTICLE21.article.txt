# The 						sport of chess?
## 
### 
In a brilliant performance
this weekend, junior Joe Smith
of Southwestern Maine St. Uni
versity led the Crimson Squir
rels to another thrashing of
archrival East Connecticut
Tech. Smith's 13-move check-

mate of Tech senior Doe John
broke the morale of the Fight
ing Sea Monkeys, who suc
cumbed 0-5 to SMSU.
"I looked Doe in his eyes and
told him, 'You're mine,"' Smith
said. "And then I went out and
did just that. My Queen's Gam
bit / Indian Attack combination
was too much for him."
Statistically, it was evident
that the Squirrels completely
outclassed Tech. SMSU cap
tured four queens, six bishops,
three knights, five rooks and 18
pawns, while the Monkeys only
garnered two rooks, one queen,
seven pawns and two bishops.
All right you sports fans.
Enough is enough. I'll come to
my point.
Recently, it was brought to
my attention that the "sport" of
chess doesn't get much coverage
in newspapers. In particular, it
was brought to my attention

that I don't even know if Stan
ford has a chess team that com
petes intercollegiately, and that
perhaps I should find out and
provide coverage of the team, if
one exists.
Here's what I have to say
about that. Although I believe
chess to be a marvelous contest
of wit, calculation and even
courage — having won a state
championship myself in my
younger days — I cannot call it
a sport. Putting aside the issue
of whether or not the game is
actually physically strenuous
(physical exhaustion may come
from mental activity), there are
many other reasons why I don't
consider chess a sport per say.
And here they are, in conve
nient Dave Letterman fashion :
10. No trash talk. You're going
to do WHAT to my body with
your bishop?
9. No real element of chance.
Sure, you can feel sick on a par
ticular day and thus not have a
good match, but it's not as if
you can throw a last-second
Hail Mary pass, have it bounce
off two defensive backs and
have the ball land in your
receiver's hands for a touch
down. Where's the drama?
Where's the emotional upset
dictated not by skill, but by
sheer fate?
8. "Give me another one, just
like the other one!" Sorry, you
can't cheer any time during a
match. And you thought golf
was stringent!
7. No cool injuries. I did see


Sam
Wu
someone jam his pinkie on the
chess clock during one of my
matches though.
6. Home court advantage?!?!
5. The only pre-game warm
ups I've ever seen a team do is
to run around the chess tables
and then drop down for 10
push-ups.
4. No controversy. The last
second off-sides call didn't make
you lose your queen.
3. Neerad says so.
2. Remember the Dream Team
II video of Shawn Kemp and
company dunking all over inter
national competition set to the

tune of The Offspring's "Come
Out and Play?" I dare you to
accompany your 1994 World
Chess Championships highlight
footage with Michael Jackson's
"Black or White."
1. It would be one of the few
sports where you, an expert, can
still be utterly embarrassed by a
5-year-old.
That just about summarizes
my sentiments. So, you can
probably guess that while I'm
still editor, you will never see a
"chess beat" in the sports sec
tion.

While Sam doesn't do many laps
around chess tables, you might see
him jogging around campus at
some very odd hours.
