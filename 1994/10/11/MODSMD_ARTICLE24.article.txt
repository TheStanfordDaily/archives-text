# 'Hermanos' form new brotherhood
## 
### Shirley Park Staff writer 
The ideals of Latino brotherhood and commu
nity service spurred the formation of the new student
organization "Los Hermanos de Stanford."
Brothers of Stanford — as translated from Span
ish — was created for the express purpose of provid
ing "positive Latino role models from within the
Stanford community in the areas of academia, ser
vice to the community and cultural awareness,"
according to the group statement submitted to the
Office of Student Activities last Thursday.
Student Activities approved the group's constitu
tion and statement of purpose the next day — thus
recognizing Los Hermanos as a legitimate organiza
tion and allowing the group to begin service-focused
projects.
The group has already brains to rmed ideas, such
as a Buddy Day Program scheduled for Nov. 11-12,
which would bring in about 10 youths from local
junior highs and pair them with members of Los Her
manos.
The group has requested funds from the Commu
nity Service Board to help cover the project's inciden
tal expenses. This way, if a child expressed an inter
est in anthropology, for example, the funds could pay
for an anthropology book from the Bookstore, said
senior David Valle, the group's manager.
Although Los Hermanos joins a horde of commu
nity-service oriented associations on campus, it hopes
to distinguish itself from the start as a fiercely com
mitted, tightly bonded group of students who pledge
to "work together like clockwork" to accomplish its
stated goals, Valle said.
To reinforce the idea of strong commitment,
weekly meetings and planned activities will be
mandatory, said president Art Pacheco, a sopho
more.
Officers have been elected for practical purposes,

but the work load is fairly divided among the mem
bers, Pacheco said.
Although Los Hermanos may appear as a group of
males with the same intents and purposes as a fra
ternity, members are shying away from using this
expression to characterize themselves.
"The term could probably be applied, but for our
own use, we prefer the woni 'brotherhood,' " Valle
said.
Pacheco said he has nothing against fraternities,
but added that Los Hermanos deliberately chose to
be labeled instead as a brotherhood to avoid the neg
ative connotations often associated with fraternities.
The group has been retaining open communica
tion lines with Gamma Zeta Alpha, a community-ser
vice Latino fraternity with chapters at five California
universities.
At this moment, Los Hermanos is not affiliated
with Gamma Zeta Alpha — which does not have a
chapter at Stanford — although Valle voiced the
group's intention of becoming associated with the
fraternity by the end of this school year, provided a
plurality of the group agrees.
Los Hermanos registered with Student Activities
as a voluntary student organization, which is distinct
from fraternities.
The group's criteria for membership — a strong
dedication to community service and to underprivi
leged youth — is open, distinguishing it from a fra
ternity, said Fraternal Affairs Advisor Heather
Dunn. Fraternities rely on subjective criteria in
selecting members, she added.
In keeping with the stated open criteria, students
of all races and ethnicities are welcome to join Los
Hermanos, Pacheco said. Members currently total
about 20, which appears to be an ideal number to
maintain, Valle said.
Pacheco added that the group's existence spread
by word-of-mouth, as publicity was kept "low-pro
file."
