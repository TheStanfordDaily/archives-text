# Fac Sen aims to improve record on women's issues
## 
### Laura Shin Staff writer 
Nearly a year ago, news of Stanford's poor record
in recruiting and retaining women faculty induced
the Faculty Senate to devise new ways to alleviate
the problem.
Now, changes are slowly occurring throughout
the University as it works to follow up on its promis
es with more specific plans to attract women to Stan
ford — and to keep them here.
Some improvements have already been made in
hiring women faculty and eliminating salary dis
crepancies between men and women, University ad

ministrators and faculty members said.
Other University committees are also working on
modifying Stanford's family-leave policy and the
"tenure clock," as well as making child care more ac
cessible for working parents.
"There's definitely been progress," said Myra
Strober, interim dean of the School of Education and
chair of last year's Provost's Committee on the Re
cruitment and Retention of Women Faculty, which
produced the controversial report.
Among other things, the group found that Stan
ford lagged behind most Ivy League and Pacific-10
Conference schools in its recruitment
and retention of women faculty — a
finding that most faculty members
found extremely unsettling.
Though improvements will come
gradually, Law Prof. Robert Weis
berg said the University is making
sure they don't take too long.
"Stanford is small enough that
changing just a few" faculty mem
bers will change the makeup great
ly with more recruitment, he said.
Questions about raises
Weisberg, who oversees Stan
ford's effort to increase the num
ber of women faculty in his role as
vice provost for faculty recruit
ment and development, has been
available since his appointment
last April to answer faculty mem
bers' questions about their salary
levels.
"A disproportionate number of
women" seek his help on such mat
ters, he said — but only because
"they are underpaid more often
than men."
These discussions often result
in a conference between the faculty
member and his or her department
chair. "Adjustments get made all
the time," Weisberg said.
"While some of this has been
going on over the past several
years," Strober said, "it's my
impression that the number of
women who were 'paid whole,' so
to speak, this year has been larger
than it's been before."
Modifying family leave
In addition to creating salary
equity, the University is changing
its family-leave policy with the
President's Committee on Faculty
and Staff Benefits.
History Prof. Judith Brown, the
committee's chair, said that the
first draft is being perused by Stan
ford's Legal Office.
"There will not be major
changes, but we are making modifi
cations," mostly in response to fed
eral and state legal changes about
family leave and the women's facul
ty report last year, said Assoc.
Provost for Faculty Affairs Kathy
Gillam, a committee member.
Gillam said she expects the new
policy to be approved this quarter.
The Office of Child and Family
Services is now working on a new
child-care center. Brown said the
committee hopes this new center
will be prepared in time for the

next academic year.
The Children's Center of the
Stanford Community requires par
ents to spend a few hours a week in
the classroom, but faculty members
cannot put in the time, Brown said.
Targeting women faculty
Weisberg has also been working
closely with school deans to hire
more women faculty, as well as
more tenure-track women faculty.
John Shoven, dean of the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences, said that the school is "more
systematic and diligent all the time
in looking for women," especially
after the publicity of last year's
report.
Provost Condoleezza Rice has
often stated her commitment to
specific hiring practices. "I expect
(deans] to look for women and
minority faculty," she said.
Overall, though, the number of
tenure-track women hired Univer
sity-wide last year remained large
ly unchanged from previous years,
Weisberg said.
One problem is that women candi
dates sometimes decline offers
because their spouses cannot find
jobs in the area, said Business Prof.
David Baron, a former associate dean
in the Graduate School of Business.
A friendlier environment
In addition to striving for
numerical changes, the University
is also working to promote a
female-friendly atmosphere.
Jim Gibbons, dean of the School
of Engineering, said he tries to eat
lunch regularly with the school's
women faculty members.
The lunches are a chance for
them "to be able to discuss with
me and my senior associates what
the issues are, what the problems
are," Gibbons said, adding that he
is particularly interested in having
women faculty serve as role mod
els for female engineering stu
dents.
The small number of tenured
women faculty, however, means it
can be difficult to find appropriate
mentors in every department.
But according to Earth Science
Dean Gary Ernst, the lack of a
strong female presence among the
faculty does not deter female pro
fessors from taking the offers Stan
ford makes.
"There aren't all that many
positions," he said, and "people are
so ambitious [that] they'll come
anyway."

Other University committees are also working on
modifying Stanford's family-leave policy and the
"tenure clock," as well as making child care more ac
cessible for working parents.
"There's definitely been progress," said Myra
Strober, interim dean of the School of Education and
chair of last year's Provost's Committee on the Re
cruitment and Retention of Women Faculty, which
produced the controversial report.
Among other things, the group found that Stan
ford lagged behind most Ivy League and Pacific-10
Conference schools in its recruitment
and retention of women faculty — a
finding that most faculty members
found extremely unsettling.
Though improvements will come
gradually, Law Prof. Robert Weis
berg said the University is making
sure they don't take too long.
"Stanford is small enough that
changing just a few" faculty mem
bers will change the makeup great
ly with more recruitment, he said.
Questions about raises
Weisberg, who oversees Stan
ford's effort to increase the num
ber of women faculty in his role as
vice provost for faculty recruit
ment and development, has been
available since his appointment
last April to answer faculty mem
bers' questions about their salary
levels.
"A disproportionate number of
women" seek his help on such mat
ters, he said — but only because
"they are underpaid more often
than men."
These discussions often result
in a conference between the faculty
member and his or her department
chair. "Adjustments get made all
the time," Weisberg said.
"While some of this has been
going on over the past several
years," Strober said, "it's my
impression that the number of
women who were 'paid whole,' so
to speak, this year has been larger
than it's been before."
Modifying family leave
In addition to creating salary
equity, the University is changing
its family-leave policy with the
President's Committee on Faculty
and Staff Benefits.
History Prof. Judith Brown, the
committee's chair, said that the
first draft is being perused by Stan
ford's Legal Office.
"There will not be major
changes, but we are making modifi
cations," mostly in response to fed
eral and state legal changes about
family leave and the women's facul
ty report last year, said Assoc.
Provost for Faculty Affairs Kathy
Gillam, a committee member.
Gillam said she expects the new
policy to be approved this quarter.
The Office of Child and Family
Services is now working on a new
child-care center. Brown said the
committee hopes this new center
will be prepared in time for the

next academic year.
The Children's Center of the
Stanford Community requires par
ents to spend a few hours a week in
the classroom, but faculty members
cannot put in the time, Brown said.
Targeting women faculty
Weisberg has also been working
closely with school deans to hire
more women faculty, as well as
more tenure-track women faculty.
John Shoven, dean of the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences, said that the school is "more
systematic and diligent all the time
in looking for women," especially
after the publicity of last year's
report.
Provost Condoleezza Rice has
often stated her commitment to
specific hiring practices. "I expect
(deans] to look for women and
minority faculty," she said.
Overall, though, the number of
tenure-track women hired Univer
sity-wide last year remained large
ly unchanged from previous years,
Weisberg said.
One problem is that women candi
dates sometimes decline offers
because their spouses cannot find
jobs in the area, said Business Prof.
David Baron, a former associate dean
in the Graduate School of Business.
A friendlier environment
In addition to striving for
numerical changes, the University
is also working to promote a
female-friendly atmosphere.
Jim Gibbons, dean of the School
of Engineering, said he tries to eat
lunch regularly with the school's
women faculty members.
The lunches are a chance for
them "to be able to discuss with
me and my senior associates what
the issues are, what the problems
are," Gibbons said, adding that he
is particularly interested in having
women faculty serve as role mod
els for female engineering stu
dents.
The small number of tenured
women faculty, however, means it
can be difficult to find appropriate
mentors in every department.
But according to Earth Science
Dean Gary Ernst, the lack of a
strong female presence among the
faculty does not deter female pro
fessors from taking the offers Stan
ford makes.
"There aren't all that many
positions," he said, and "people are
so ambitious [that] they'll come
anyway."
