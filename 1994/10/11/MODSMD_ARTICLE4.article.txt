# Med Center growth moves ahead

### Justin Pollard Staff writer 
Plans to expand the Stanford
Medical Center by up to 400,000
square feet are moving ahead de
spite a few stumbling blocks, Uni
versity and Palo Alto officials said.
The Medical Center announced
plans for the expansion in May, and
officials expect the project —
which will increase outpatient ser
vices — to be completed by the year
2000, though no plans have been
drawn up yet.

The figure of 400,000 square
feet is an "outside projection of
what we may need," said Don Gib
bons, director of the Office of Com
munications of the Medical Center.
But first, the Palo Alto City
Council must approve Stanford's
controversial Sand Hill Road exten
sion plans — which the University
expects to submit to the city soon —
to accommodate the increased traf
fic flow certain to be created by the
Medical Center expansion.
Stanford's plans also call for
four- to six-story buildings, exceed
ing the city building height limit of

50 feet, meaning the University
must receive permission from the
city to change the zoning law.
But Gibbons said he feels the
University can make a good case for
exceeding the height limit because
taller buildings would be much
more efficient and would improve
the quality of the facilities for both
patients and staff.
Palo Alto Mayor Liz Kniss was
also optimistic about the plans, say
ing that it is time for area hospitals
"to handle the public needs for re
duced health care costs," and that
Stanford's new facilities will be a
good start.
Stanford does not "even need to
come to [the City of Palo Alto] in
order to expand," Kniss said. But
Palo Alto does give an advisory vote
to Santa Clara County, she said, and
Stanford has sought input from the
city in the planning process.
"The primary reason for the
new building is to provide cost
effective health care," said Peter
Van Etten, president of Stanford
Health Services.
Half of the building will be used

for ambulatory surgery, outpa
tient surgery and medical treat
ment requiring short stays, while
the other half would be for cancer
treatment, Van Etten said.
, "Health care is moving toward a
system where it is provided more
and more on an outpatient basis,"
he said.
Gibbons said that a combination
of technological advances and
changes in health insurance poli
cies have caused the increased
demand for outpatient care.
Technology has made it possible
to treat more patients without
keeping them overnight, and insur
ance companies have made it
increasingly necessary by demand
ing reductions in costs, he added.
The new facilities would serve

the Stanford University Clinics
and the Lucile Packard Children's
Hospital, which is 160,000 square
feet.
The Children's Hospital "has
no definite plans for expansion"
said Children's Hospital Commu
nications Director Shelley Hebert,
and the estimates are only projec
tions of what the hospitals may
need in the future.
"What we would probably be
looking at would be increased out
patient facilities," Hebert said,
since the Children's Hospital does
not envision needing any addition
al inpatient care in the near future.
Hebert said the Children's Hos
pital saw nearly 7,000 more patients
in their clinics than the 45,000 they
forecast for the last fiscal year.
