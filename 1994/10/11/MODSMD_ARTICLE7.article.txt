# Not quite a false alarm
## New Branner fire protection system failed to alert fire department 
### Ben Sussman 
Branner Hall residents were surprised to
learn Sunday night that their brand new fire
alarm system was not completely functional —
perhaps because of the severe time pressure
under which summer work crews operated.
The alarm system did activate successful
ly, but failed to electronically notify the
emergency dispatch center in Palo Alto. A
relatively minor amount of smoke from an
unknown source set off the alarm.
According to Arleen Stanford fire
protection systems manager, the breakdown
in the system was caused by an incorrectly
programmed electric switch in the fire
alarm.
The switch prevented the alarm system
from communicating with the dispatch cen
ter, as all campus alarms are normally pro
grammed to do, she said.
Alarm technicians found that of the nine
separate fire alarms in the Branner system,
only the alarm that went off Sunday night

was programmed incorrectly.
Technicians discovered the cause of the
malfunction quickly and called the alarm
contractor to fix the problem. By Monday,
the alarm had been correctly reprogrammed.
"You do have things that can go wrong,"
Musci said, "and unfortunately, that went
wrong."
However, Joe Jackson, a Stanford fire
alarm technician, said he believes severe
time constraints during the summer may
have contributed to the faulty alarm pro
gramming.
"We were being pushed to get the system
done," he said. Jackson added that three
separate people — the contractor, an inspec
tor and a safety reviewer — were responsible
for checking the system. "Somebody missed
the ball," he said.
Not expecting a fire drill that night, Bran
ner residents evacuated to their emergency
assembly point shortly after midnight, and
waited for firefighters to arrive.
Resident assistant Aaron Lehman said

residents guessed that the alarm system was
not functioning properly after waiting for
more than 10 minutes, and called 9-911 from
another dorm.
The smoke that set off the alarm either
originated from or drifted into the hall.
Branner RAs would not comment on the
source of the smoke.
According to Musci, had the smoke been
confined to a single dorm room, only the
room smoke detector would have gone off.
Whatever its origin, the smoke that
caused the alarm turned out to be harmless.
The entire incident, however, raised some
concerns among Branner residents about
the safety of their dorm.
"I feel reasonably safe, because the fire
alarm went off," said Mark Lippert, another
Branner RA. "But the fire department not
coming does raise concerns."
Other fire alarm malfunctions plagued
Roble Hall last February. In that case, how
ever, false alarms were caused by fluctuating
water pressure in the sprinkler system.
