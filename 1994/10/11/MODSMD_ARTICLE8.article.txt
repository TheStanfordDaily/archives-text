Americans win Nobel Prize
STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) - Two
Americans won the Nobel Prize in
medicine yesterday for shedding light on
how cells communicate to speed the
spread of killer diseases like cholera and
diabetes throughout the body.
Alfred G. Gilman and Martin Rodbell
will split the $930,000 prize for determin
ing how a certain group of proteins can
help transmit and modulate signals in
cells, much like a biological switchboard.
Their discoveries, products of two
decades of work, have been "paramount"
in helping scientists understand diseases
that affect tens of millions of people
around the globe, said Professor Bertil
Fredholm of the Karolinska Institute's
Nobel Assembly.
While their research, carried out over

two decades, has not netted treatments
yet, the institute said it ultimately might.
Cult master found dead
lAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) - The
financial mastermind of the doomsday cult
at the center of 53 deaths in Switzerland
and Canada perished in the carnage, police
said yesterday, deepening the mystery sur
rounding the fate of the cult's other leader.
Pathologists using dental records identi
fied Joseph di Mambro among the burned
bodies found in three charred chalets in the
southwestern Swiss village of Granges-sur-
Salvan, Valais state police said.
Di Mambro, a 70-year-old French-Cana
dian, was widely described as the grand mas
ter and financial power of the cult, called the
Order of the Solar Tradition in Switzerland,
with links in France, Canada and Australia.
