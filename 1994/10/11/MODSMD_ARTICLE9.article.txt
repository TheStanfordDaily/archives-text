# Iraqi troops pull out of Kuwait
## 
### 
KUWAIT (AP) — America's deter
mined effort to protect Kuwait appeared to
pay off yesterday: Hours after U.S. soldiers
landed, Iraq declared an end to its menac
ing five-day buildup and said its troops
were pulling back.
The tens of thousands of Iraqi soldiers
sent to the border had revived memories of
1990, when Iraq swept aside Kuwait's
army and seized the oil-rich country. It was
seven months before a U.S.-led coalition
ousted the occupiers.
This time, Washington was determined
to send a firm signal — invade Kuwait and
the United States will respond. Washing
ton began amassing a force of nearly
70,000 in the region, 54,000 already
assigned plus 15,000 on standby.
The first contingent of3oo U.S. soldiers
arrived in Kuwait City yesterday.
Hours later, Iraq's ambassador to the
United Nations, Nizar Hamdoon, said
Iraqi forces would withdraw from the

Kuwaiti border and "are already on the
move." He said they would be sent to a site
north of Basra.
In Baghdad, Foreign Minister
Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf said troops
would be deployed to "other locations in
the rear" to finish military exercises.
He told the official Iraqi news agency
the withdrawal was ordered in response to
appeals from "friends" and"in view of the
fact that the troops' presence might be
used as a pretext to maintain sanctions."
The crushing U.N. sanctions were
imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in
August 1990. Iraq has aggressively sought
to have the sanctions eased, particularly a
4-year-old oil embargo that has devastated
the economy.
Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein may have
conceived the buildup as a warning that he
could still cause trouble if the sanctions
were not lifted.
The United States and Kuwait reacted

cautiously to word of a withdrawal.
"I haven't seen anything like that, no,"
said Gen. John Shalikashvili, chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
Kuwait's information minister, Sheik
Saud al-Sabah, said there was no evidence
Iraq had begun pulling back any of the esti
mated 80,000 soldiers on the border. "We
will believe it when we see it,"he said.
Vesselin Kostov, spokesman for the
1,100-member U.N. observer mission on
the border, told The Associated Press he
could not confirm that Iraqi troops were
moving but said "the situation within the
DMZ remains calm." The 9-mile-wide
demilitarized zone was set up after the
1991 Gulf War.
Pentagon officials have not said to what
extent Iraq would have to pull back before
the United States ended its buildup.
U.S. forces continued to arrive yester
day to confront the Iraqi force, which
includes 20,000 Republican Guards.
