YOU ARE NOT ALONE
AN ADULT CHILDREN OF
ALCOHOLICS GROUP at C.A.RS.
AJ Cooper, Ph.D., and Mary Ann Aposhian, Ph.D., invite you to an 8 week, semi-structured
Adult Children of Alcoholics (A.CA.) group. If you are an A.C.A., you probably have problems
with intimacy, co-dependent relationships, intense feelings of loneliness, control issues, and a
tendency to overextend yourself. But you are not alone. Twenty-eight million Americans, (or
one out of eight Americans) have at least one alcoholic parent. More than 50% of today's
alcoholics had an alcoholic parent. A.C.A.'s have a 5 to 8 times greater risk of becoming
alcoholic than nonAC.A.'s. A recent study at UCSB found that 11% of the respondents
identified themselves as A.C.A.'s; related studies at other universities demonstrate similar
findings. Over the past six years, this specifically designed A.CA. group has been refined and
improved. If you are an A.CA. and would like a rewarding but intensive experience, call A.C.A.
for pre-screening. Space is limited. Two separate groups are available: Fridays, from 3:00 to
4:30, beginning Oct. 14, or Tuesdays, from 12:00 to 1:30, beginning Oct. 18. C.A.PS. offers a
variety of groups each quarter, with groups ranging from topics which have included
procrastination, sexual identity, ethnic women's issues, and shyness. Groups can often be an
enlivening and intensive way of creatively healing ourselves. Call CAPS, at 723-3785 for more
information on the A.C.A. groups, and a listing of other groups which are currently available.
