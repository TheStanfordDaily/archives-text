FACES BEHIND THE
SHADOWS OF
HATE
AN ISRAELI'S JOURNEY INSIDE
.GERMANY'S NEO-NAZI MOVEMENT
YARON SVORAY, an Israeli paratrooper, infiltrated the
Neo-Nazi underworld for eight months. Using the cover "Ron
Furey," Svoray discovered (and documented with hidden cameras
and microphones) that the Neo-Nazis were not merely skinhead
thugs, but that their ranks include lawyers, "respectable
politicians," professors, police officers, and military personnel. This
eye witness account is not an alarmist tract but a powerful expose
of the danger posed by Germany's radical right.
Learn about extremist organizations
in Germany and throughout the world.
A call for all people of conscience
to hear his story and respond.
This presentation is free and open to all student, faculty, and staff
at Stanford University.
