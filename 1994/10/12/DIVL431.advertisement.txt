systems, business process
technology is the next strategic
challenge. For this reason, many
forward thinking companies
have already put the R/3 System
to work. Like our proven R/2
mainframe software, SAP's
client/server based R/3 is a fully
integrated package, managing
company-wide applications from
Manufacturing, Finance and
Order Processing to Human
Resources functions.
SAP's dedication to superior
technology has made us one of
the largest, most successful, and
fastest-growing software compa
nies in the world. Our software
solutions are enterprise-wide, i
allowing our clients a complete
business solution across all
business functions.
SAP dedicates nearly 25% of
our revenues to R&D - nearly
twice the industry average. Our
integrated software is multi
language, multi-currency and
runs on virtually any platform.
Which is why SAP has over 2,600
clients (including 9 of the top 10
Fortune 100 Companies) in 35
countries around the world.
