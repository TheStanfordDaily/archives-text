# Where we are now
## Vice provost gives report on Student Affairs 
### Frank Guinan Staff writer 
In her third annual State of Student Affairs ad
dress, Vice Provost and Dean for Student Affairs
Mary Edmonds exhorted her colleagues to help her to
curb alcohol consumption on campus.
Speaking yesterday afternoon in Kresge Auditori
um, Edmonds cited "frightening" data from a recent
Columbia University study.
According to the study, 42 percent of students
from several colleges admitted to participating in
binge drinking — defined as having four or more
drinks in a very short time span — and 8 percent said
they consumed 16 or more drinks in one week.
"Alcohol has a ripple effect on the community...
with crime, injuries, suicide attempts," she said.
Edmonds said that results from a recent study
conducted at Stanford showed figures comparable to
those in the Columbia study.
"We need to turn our attention to binge drinking.
.. and rethink substance abuse as 'a rite of passage.' "
Edmonds said.
The University also must "continue to do more in
depth research on who's coming to Stanford," she
said. A better understanding of the current genera-
tion — which she described as
being labeled everything from
"the MTV generation" to "the
baby busters" — would allow bet
ter student services and under
standing, she said.
Edmonds also promised to
launch a search for a permanent
director for the Office of Residen
tial Education. Ann Porteus cur
rently holds the position of acting
co-director of Res Ed.
In addition, Edmonds dis
cussed the University budget and
how cuts would affect her depart
ment this year.
During the budget cuts last
year, she said, "there developed a
sense among students that the
administration is the enemy."

She encouraged Student Affairs
staff to act as a community to "get
rid of that 'us and them' atti
tude."
Due to budget cuts last year,
Student Affairs slashed more
than $1 million from its operat
ing budget without significantly
reducing student services,
Edmonds said.
"The major reductions are
behind us . . . IbutJ the job is not
yet complete," she said. "We need
to decide what we could afford to
do, what we can no longer do and
what we could do in a more cost
effective way."
Provost Condoleezza Rice
also spoke at the program,
telling the audience that Stu
dent Affairs received a dispro
portionately high share of last
year's budget cuts. This year,
however, the office can "expect
far less cutting," she said.
"You are the people responsi
ble for the most important peo
ple here at Stanford — the stu
dents," she said. "[University
President Gerhard Casper and I]
understand your value . . . and
want you to know your mission is
appreciated."
Edmonds noted the accom
plishments of the past year in her
speech.
Among these "positive
things," she cited the renovations
of Florence Moore Hall and sev
eral Row houses this summer, as
well as the results of a survey
released last week by the Judicial
Affairs Office which could lead to
changes in the Honor Code.
Among lessons learned last
year, she said that need-blind
admissions "must be preserved."
