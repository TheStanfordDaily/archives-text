In yesterday's story on women
faculty recruitment and reten
tion, Professor of History Judith
Brown was incorrectly quoted as
saying that the President's Com
mittee on Faculty and Staff Bene

fits is currently planning a new
child-care center. Actually,
Brown said that the group is
proposing a new, "non-co-op"
option for the current Children's
Center of the Stanford Communi
ty. The Daily regrets the error.
