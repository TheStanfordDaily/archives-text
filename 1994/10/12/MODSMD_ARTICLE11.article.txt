## Troops wait warily in Gulf 
### 
KUWAIT (AP) — Skepticism
over Saddam Hussein's intentions
prevailed yesterday, with the Unit
ed States and its allies continuing
their massive military buildup in
the Persian Gulf despite reports
that Iraqi troops were pulling away
from Kuwait.
Washington was assembling its
biggest military force since the
1991 Gulf War to face down the
Iraqi leader: Tens of thousands of
Americans were still ordered into
the Gulf along with hundreds of
the most potent U.S. aircraft and
warships.
The Pentagon acknowledged
some of the 80,000 Iraqi units men
acing Kuwait may be "moving from
their combat positions."
But "considerable (Iraqi) units"
remain in the area, said Gen. John
Shalikashvili, chairman of the
Joints Chiefs of Staff.
The Iraqi deployment toward
the Kuwaiti border "wasn't just
some innocent exercise that they

were on and we misread it," Sha
likashvili said. "Far, far from
it. . .I'm not at all prepared to say
the crisis is over in any way."
Baghdad claimed its forces
began moving Monday night to a
position north of Basra, 35 miles
north of the Kuwaiti border.
The official Iraqi News Agency,
monitored in Cyprus, quoted For
eign Minister Mohammed Said al-
Sahhaf as saying the pullback was
largely completed yesterday. Only
two brigades, about 8,000 men,
were still near the border and
would withdraw soon, al-Sahhaf
said.
Another agency dispatch said
the Foreign Ministry has asked the
Russian and Chinese embassies to
send their military attaches to ver
ify the pullback.
Journalists on the road to Basra
said troops and military equipment
were moving in both directions,
with heavy artillery heading south.
Baghdad had claimed the

buildup was a routine rotation and
training exercise. But the mobiliza
tion was alarmingly similar to the
one that preceded Iraq's August
1990 invasion of Kuwait.
Kuwait's information minister,
Sheik Saud al-Sabah, told The
Associated Press yesterday that he
was skeptical of the Iraqi with
drawal announcement.
"They could withdraw a couple of
tanks north... and send them back
the next day,"he said. "We cannot
tolerate this kind of cat-and-mouse
game being played. Saddam has
always been playing these games
with us for the last two years."
Iraq's claims of a troop pullback
have been called into question since
Iraqi officials first made them
Monday.
"We will just simply stay on
course and judge what we should
do as events unfold," President
Clinton said yesterday when he
announced that Western deploy
ments would continue.
