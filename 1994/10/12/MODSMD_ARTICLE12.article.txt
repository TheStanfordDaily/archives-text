# Democrats blast North

WASHINGTON (AP) - Wad
ing into Virginia's testy Senate
race, the White House said yes
terday that Oliver North was
"giving aid and comfort" to Sad
dam Hussein by suggesting U.S.
forces could not stop an Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait.
"It is despicable, it is unpatri
otic and as is often the case with
statements from Oliver North,
it is also patently untrue," Vice
President A 1 Gore said in
attacking the former Reagan
White House aide.
"He has put the rankest form
of partisanship ahead of the
national interest in a manner
which is insulting to our armed
forces, to our flag, to the sol
diers who are prepared to go
into battle if necessary."
North, in a statement, did
not offer the apology Gore
demanded. Instead, he sought
to turn the tables, saying "it is
shameful and opportunistic that

a White House would use an
international crisis — where
American lives are at stake — to
promote their own selfish, polit
ical agenda."
North is in a tight race with
Democratic Sen. Charles S.
Robb, and both Clinton and
Gore have campaigned on
Robb's behalf.
North, in turn, has labeled
Robb a Clinton lackey, in the
hopes of taking advantage of
Clinton's poor political standing
in Virginia. The race is a major
battleground in the GOP's
effort to capture a Senate
majority.
So the administration rushed
to join the fight over North's
weekend remarks about U.S.
military preparedness, hoping
to damage North's standing
among military families in a
state whose economy is heavily
reliant on naval and other
defense-related installations.
