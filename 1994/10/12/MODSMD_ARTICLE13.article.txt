Ruble plummets
MOSCOW (AP) - Panicky
Muscovites gutted savings
accounts and dashed to buy
refrigerators and stereos, gaso
line and food yesterday as the
Russian ruble suffered its worst
one-day plunge against the dol
lar in two years.
Shock waves from "Black
Tuesday" spread as money
exchanges ran out of dollars and
kiosks closed so enterprising
merchants could mark up mer
chandise. "This country is going
down the drain," said Yaroslav
Sychevsky, who stood in line at a
currency exchange.
"Our government is brain
less!" said a stunned Nikolai
Romantsov as he surveyed the
prices at a downtown food shop.
The ruble lost one-fourth of
its value against the dollar yes

terday in the worst one-day drop
since trading began in 1992. It
closed at 3,926 to the dollar at
the Moscow Interbank Currency
Exchange, a drop of 845 points.
Amendment ruling
DENVER (AP) - The anti
gay rights amendment that set
off a nationwide boycott of Col
orado was declared unconstitu
tional yesterday by the state
Supreme Court, which said it
denies homosexuals an equal
voice in government.
"The right to participate
equally in the political process is
clearly affected by Amendment
2," Chief Justice Luis Rovira
wrote for the court's 6-1 majority.
The amendment "angles out one
form of discrimination and removes
its redress from consideration by the
normal political process," Rovira said.
