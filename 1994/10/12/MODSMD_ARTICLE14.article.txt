PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP)
— Hundreds of U.S. troops took over
the National Palace yesterday,
sweeping away the last vestiges of
Haiti's military-backed administra
tion before President Jean-Bertrand
Aristide's return.
About 500 American soldiers
entered the sprawling white building
and other ministries, escorting out
employees of the government set up
by the military leaders who over
threw Aristide in 1991.
"This to facilitate an orderly tran
sition of power. No members of the
past government will be allowed back
Ln," Army Lt. Col. Ed Sullivan said.
Aristide's Cabinet ministers fired
all employees hired under a civilian
figurehead government installed in
May by militaiy strongman Raoul
Cedras, who resigned Monday.
Several hundred Aristide support
ers crowded outside the gates of the
palace grew agitated when they saw
public hospital director George
Dubuche trying to leave in a govern

ment car.
Shouting at him to stop, they sur
rounded the car and let the air out of
its tires. Soldiers escorted Dubuche
to a private car and he drove away
unharmed.
One Aristide backer, Hilaire
George, tried to calm the crowd.
"From now on, we the people are
responsible for the country," he said.
"I don't agree with people who try to
destroy, preventing the country from
going forward."
Aristide's ministers were to
return to their offices today, U.S. sol
diers on the scene said.
"We can now roll up our sleeves
and begin to rebuild democracy in
the spirit of reconciliation," Aris
tide's commerce minister, Louis
Dejoie 11, said in an interview.
The government of Robert Mal
val, Aristide's prime minister,
announced yesterday it would take
over the government ministry
offices, and the American soldiers
arrived in the afternoon to help.
