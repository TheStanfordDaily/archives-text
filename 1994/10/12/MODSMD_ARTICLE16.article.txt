## Clarify Honor Code 
### 
Changes are needed to
prevent violations caused
by student collaboration

WRITTEN IN 1921, the
Stanford Honor Code was
designed to provide "a stan
dard of honesty." While this code
was implemented at the request of
students to ensure a sense of collec
tive responsibility on campus, it is
encouraging to see that 90 percent
of the student body still agrees with
what the code stands for.
However, even though every stu
dent must sign their allegiance to
this code with the submission of
every written exam, each year stu
dents are unclear as to how this
code applies to them outside of the
classroom â€” a sign that the docu
ment needs to be updated.
In the same poll, 30 percent stat
ed that they have received unclear
instructions regarding the applica
tion of the Honor Code to their
work. This is a particularly large
and important discrepancy, as many
students evidently do not under
stand how the Honor Code applies
to their work, especially in groups.
While group collusion is becom
ing an increasingly popular way
among professors and students to
complete projects, too often these
groups are more preoccupied with
whether or not their discussions
may be overstepping the bounds
of acceptable collaboration.
Reciprocally, students may be dis
couraged from working with oth
ers if professors who originally
encouraged going to classmates
for help later question students
who have arrived similarly at an
answer.
Granted, copying answers is of
no educational benefit to anyone.
But is there a difference between
students who work through a prob
lem together and those who come to
the same answer because they took
advantage of the TA's office hours?

Plagarism, whether intentional
or not, is an automatic Honor
Code violation. A similar state
ment needs to be formulated with
regard to sharing information.
But creating a general rule relat
ing to group work may be hard to
apply to the individual depart
ments, as a mechanical engineer
ing professor may allow for more
collaboration than a professor in
the computer science or physics
department. While many profes
sors give explicit guidelines on
acceptable group cooperation in
labs or on problem sets, those in
the same department who do not
create awkward and confusing sit
uations for the students.
The present Honor Code states
that any procedures creating temp
tations to violate the code, such as
"limits of acceptable collaboration
in course work" have to be mini
mized by the faculty. This state
ment needs to be explicitly clarified.
Therefore, perhaps it would be in
the best interest of each depart
ment to form a committee of facul
ty members and students to look
into what they define as acceptable
group work. This simple statement
could then be handed out along
with syllabi at the beginning of each
quarter, to ensure there are no
questions about what students can
or cannot do.
Once students are fully aware of
how closely they can work within
the boundaries of the code, they
must then fulfill their "third-party
responsibility" as well. While many
times students believe the Honor
Code does not work because of
unclear instructions from faculty
members, the greatest responsibili
ty rests with the students.
Since students are very comfort
able taking unproctored exams, they
have to be just as comfortable and
confident in confronting someone
they believe has cheated. Until stu
dents fully understand what they
are signing with every exam, the
students who believe the Honor
Code is a joke will be the ones laugh
ing when final grades are given.
