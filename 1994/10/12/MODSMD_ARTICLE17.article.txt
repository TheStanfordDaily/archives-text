Stanford will go beyond EPA waste requirements

IN READING THE Daily's editori
al on Wednesday, October 5
regarding Stanford's settlement
with the California Environmental
Protection Agency, I was surprised
to see the statement "But it's a
shame that for Stanford. . .minimal
compliance is a goal rather than a
given."
There should be no misunder-

standing: Stanford intends to fully
comply with all hazardous waste reg
ulations. In fact, by agreeing to the
terms of the settlement, Stanford
will be adhering to much more strin
gent standards than those presently
enforced at any other university in
the state. We will also be working
constructively with the state author
ities to improve an awkward regula

tory system.
As I said in a letter to all faculty,
students and
staff, which was published in the
September 28 edition of Campus
Report, "I call on each member of
the Stanford research community to
inform himself or herself of the rules
governing the management of haz
ardous waste on campus and to take

personal responsibility for
complying with these rules."
We are fully committed to the pro
tection of the environment, to the
health and safety of faculty, students
and staff, and to compliance with
applicable laws and regulations.
