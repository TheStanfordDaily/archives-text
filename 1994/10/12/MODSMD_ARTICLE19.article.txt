## Question without apologies 
### 
SEVERAL MONTHS AGO in
Berkeley I saw a yellow-eyed man
standing on the street corner, cry
ing out to anyone who passed by him.
Listening to the man, I was keenly
aware that although he had no assur
ance that anyone would listen, he cried
out just the same, somehow impelled to
tell all who might hear that if he was
crazy to be sick and tired of racism and
sexism and AIDS, well then, he was
crazy. I was touched by his urgency; he
had broken things down into such clear
pictures that reactions were irrelevant
— he had to speak. When I stopped, he
gently tied a red ribbon to my backpack,
grasped my hand and told me to go on,
in peace.
Two weeks ago when Czech Republic
President Vaclav Havel spoke at Frost
Amphitheater, I felt in his quiet voice
the same pitch of necessity. His clear
belief that we can only begin to resolve
the current conflict of civilizations
when we realize the spiritual dimension
of our humanity — our common experi
ence of transcendence — seems to me so
essential that I was at once inspired and
reassured.
And so I regret that at Stanford
Havel felt compelled, like the Berkeley
street-walker, to lace his logic with a
sort of apology. Midway through his
speech he acknowledged that "saying all
this here, I am running the risk that
whole armies of scientists and journal
ists will label me a mystic who is abus
ing this renowned forum to speak his
obscure opinions." Seemingly unsure

whether acts of faith hold up at Stan
ford, Havel nonetheless bravely contin
ues to remind us that we cannot remain
silent about things our own experiences
persuade us are true.
In"The Politics of Hope," an essay
written several years before Czechoslo
vakia's democratic revolution in 1989,
Havel discusses what he calls the "self
momentum" of a power or system, a
"blind, unconscious, irresponsible,
uncontrollable and unchecked momen
tum that is no longer the work of peo
ple, but which drags people along with
it and therefore manipulates them."
Sadly, it seems to me that in the com
plex of powers that is Stanford this
momentum barrels forward largely
unchecked. Most here claim to be driven
by a love of learning, yet many also feel
that we have strayed from that course,
What makes it so difficult to confront
contradictions like these?
Perhaps we feel we lack the wisdom
to criticize, or a voice strong enough to
be heard. Some of us seem to prefer to
quietly take what we can and move on.
Most of us will move on, into other
forums large and small where people
may ask what we have to say. We expect
that as Stanford graduates, our role will
be that which Havel ascribes to the
intellectual: to warn, to constantly dis
turb, to be "provocative by being inde
pendent" and to doubt and rebel against
"all hidden and open pressure and
manipulations" of various systems. But
of that future I can only speculate,
because right here and now we seem in

some respects to be living up to our rep
utation for apathy.
Words today are not at a premium,
and I have no doubt that if we do not
speak out for ourselves and each other,
someone else will be happy to have the
air time. But we have the responsibility
to ask our own questions, to talk about
the things that matter to us — not what
our parents think is important or what
our professors find interesting. As stu
dents and teachers and human beings,
we cannot wait for someone to call upon
us to counteract the disembodied tide of
self-momentum.
In his writings, Havel makes clear
that history — the narrative of our liVes
— is no such abstract force. Our history
takes place in the present, he says, and
we are the ones in charge of making it.
While at times it seems as if school is
merely a playground of ideas, those
ideas have consequences both here at
Stanford and beyond the boundaries of
the University. I am not here to tell you
what questions to ask, but to ask my
own, and to express my hope that you
will discover and have the courage to
ask yours, without apology.
