### Hussein Kanji 
After a lengthy pre-trial conference at the Palo Alto
Municipal Court, Judge Douglas K. Southard an
nounced yesterday that the case against four students
charged with misdemeanor vandalism will continue to
another pre-trial hearing.
Senior Mark Butterfield, junior Jason White, junior
Robert Gardner and former Stanford student Brian
Dallimore were arrested last May for allegedly vandal
izing George Segal's "Gay Liberation" statue and pled
not guilty to misdemeanor vandalism. The four were
not present at the conference.
After nearly two hours of heated discussion in
chambers, Judge Southard warned that if an agree
ment could not be reached by the next preliminary
hearing on Oct. 27, the case would go to a jury. The
judge said, however, that they are "close to resolving
the case."
"One, if not two" key points would have to be cleared
up between the two parties to reach a settlement, Judge
Southard said.
