# Vandalism case nears settlement
## Pre-trial hearing held for 4 
### Hussein Kanji 
After a lengthy pre-trial conference at the Palo Alto
Municipal Court, Judge Douglas K. Southard an
nounced yesterday that the case against four students
charged with misdemeanor vandalism will continue to
another pre-trial hearing.
Senior Mark Butterfield, junior Jason White, junior
Robert Gardner and former Stanford student Brian
Dallimore were arrested last May for allegedly vandal
izing George Segal's "Gay Liberation" statue and pled
not guilty to misdemeanor vandalism. The four were
not present at the conference.
After nearly two hours of heated discussion in
chambers, Judge Southard warned that if an agree
ment could not be reached by the next preliminary
hearing on Oct. 27, the case would go to a jury. The
judge said, however, that they are "close to resolving
the case."
"One, if not two" key points would have to be cleared
up between the two parties to reach a settlement, Judge
Southard said.
One of these points is deter
mining the final damage esti
mate of the statue, according to
Deputy District Attorney Diane
Doolittle.
The statue has been repaired
meaning a final University
damage estimate should be avail
able — but neither party seems
to be able to agree on the esti
mate, she said.
Robert Burmeister, the attor
ney defending Jason White,
refused to say whether the dis
pute over the estimate is the
reason for the ongoing litiga
tion.
The other three lawyers
could not be reached for com
ment.
Though the misdemeanor
charge carries a maximum penal
ty of one year in prison and a
$10,000 fine, the students are
most likely to get "community
service over and above what
Stanford [has] imposed," Doolit
tle said.
University officials have yet to

announce the Stanford punish
ment.
The case is "really totally in
[the defense attorneys'] hands,"
she said.
Senior Thomas Irwin, who
was also allegedly involved with
the statue incident, has been
charged with felony vandalism
and has pled not guilty.
He is scheduled for a prelimi
nary hearing on Oct. 14 at the
Palo Alto Municipal Court.
Deputy District Attorney
Valerie Marchant, who is prose
cuting Irwin, said that he likely
won't get the maximum sentence
of three years in prison. Like the
others, she expects him to get
"community service and restitu
tion."
If Irwin, who has a new
lawyer, were to continue to trial,
Marchant said his sentence could
be harsher — possibly up to two
to three years in prison.
Former Stanford student
Todd Laßocca, the sixth student
involved in the case, pled no con
test to the charge of felony van
dalism at his preliminary hear
ing on Sept. 29. His formal sen
tencing hearing will be held on
Nov. 29.
