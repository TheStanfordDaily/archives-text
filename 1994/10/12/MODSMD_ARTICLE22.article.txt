## U.S., Japan to share in technology growth Center aids intellectual and cultural exchange 
### Jeremy Thibeaux 
Researchers at Stanford University's
U.S.—Japan Technology Management
Center (USJTMC) are working to cross
the spatial gulf between the countries by
building an information highway.
Under the direction of Richard Dash
er, the Center hosted a conference last
Wednesday on the future of Japan's
national information infrastructure —
hoping to serve as a bridge between the
two countries.
The Center's goal, according to former
director Dr. Robert Burmeister, is to pro
vide U.S. scientists and engineers with
"advanced education and training oppor
tunities in the area of Japanese technolo
gy management." The gathering was the
result of efforts to achieve this goal.
The conference clarified the status
and accessibility of the Internet in Japan
for companies hoping to capitalize on it.
Business delegates from corporations on
the West Coast and Japan attended, and
some students were also present.
Dasher described three current direc
tions of the Center's research: advanced
computing and networking, sophisticated
manufacturing, and flat panel displays.
Researchers at the center follow trends
within these broad areas.
Major projects currently underway
include intelligent manufacturing sys
tems (IMS), machine translation (MT),
and flat panel displays.
The IMS Program is designed to elim
inate unnecessary duplication of research
and development in the U.S. and Japan,
and to increase standardization of tech
nology on a global scale.
Ideally, international companies
would cooperate with each other during
initial product design phases—a policy
that could save millions of dollars in
redundant research and development
and help to establish global technology

standards.
The USJTMC informs and updates
West Coast manufacturing companies
about the IMS program and solicits their
participation.
While noting the benefits of coopera
tion on the Pacific Rim, American compa
nies want to ensure that each country
contributes equally to the information
exchange.
In addition to the IMS program track
ing, the Center is testing a machine
translation system developed by a major
Japanese electronics company. The
machine transcribes Japanese docu
ments into English; the Center has
installed one at Stanford for testing pur
poses.
The MT system allows Stanford facul
ty and students to translate Japanese
technical documents into English in
exchange for their evaluation of the prod
uct. Finished evaluations are sent to the
MT originator in Japan.
In this way, USJTMC provides access
to Japanese technical documents other
wise inaccessible to people who cannot
read Japanese. The companies that devel
oped the MT technology also benefit,
because the feedback helps the manufac
turer improve future models of the sys
tem.
The Center also investigates the eco
nomic factors in manufacturing the color
flat panel displays that appear on
portable computers. Current research
seeks to predict the future costs of manu
facturing these displays. In addition to
research activities, the Center provides
many services to the University, includ
ing a World Wide Web site accessible to
Stanford undergraduates.
PC Computing magazine heralds the
Web terminal as "a crucial site for any
US firm dealing in Japan." The Web pro
ject is managed by Project Manager Bur
ton Lee and Associate Project Manager

Michael Bayle.
The World Wide Web computer maga
zine allows Internet users to access pages
all over the world. Through 'links,' repre
sented by an underlined word on the
page, a user can jump from one page to
another.
When the user desires more informa
tion about a subject, he or she can view
the next page by clicking on a 'link' word.
The pages come complete with pictures,
but, to save time consumed by graphical
data transmission, the pictures can be
turned off and only text will be displayed.
The Center's Web site accesses a vari
ety of technical and non-technical infor
mation about Japan. By starting at the

Web's home page, the user can scroll
through a variety of information about
Japan.
For example, overseas studies pro
grams, presidential speeches, and
Japanese language and technology are a
mere mouse click away. Some of the links
will land the user onto Web sites within
Japan itself.
Although USJTMC primarily employs
graduate students, the Web site encour
ages undergraduate participation by hir
ing students to help construct Web pages.
In discussing the various offerings
that the Center has for undergraduates,
Dasher emphasized the many classes and
seminars that originate through

USJTMC. In conjunction with the for
eign language department, the Center
offers courses in Modern Japan and
Reading Technical Japanese.
The variety of seminars, often led by
guests visiting from Japanese companies,
cover a full range of subjects from optical
electronics to surviving as a gaijin (for
eigner) in Japan.
Another service offered by the Center
is a 'video bridge' to Japan. In May of
1993, the Center linked two live video
conferences from Tokyo to Stanford.
Since then, the USJTMC has retained
the technology to transmit live video con
ferences between the two countries over
telephone wires.

facturing these displays. In addition to
research activities, the Center provides
many services to the University, includ
ing a World Wide Web site accessible to
Stanford undergraduates.
PC Computing magazine heralds the
Web terminal as "a crucial site for any
US firm dealing in Japan." The Web pro
ject is managed by Project Manager Bur
ton Lee and Associate Project Manager

Michael Bayle.
The World Wide Web computer maga
zine allows Internet users to access pages
all over the world. Through 'links,' repre
sented by an underlined word on the
page, a user can jump from one page to
another.
When the user desires more informa
tion about a subject, he or she can view
the next page by clicking on a 'link' word.
The pages come complete with pictures,
but, to save time consumed by graphical
data transmission, the pictures can be
turned off and only text will be displayed.
The Center's Web site accesses a vari
ety of technical and non-technical infor
mation about Japan. By starting at the

Web's home page, the user can scroll
through a variety of information about
Japan.
For example, overseas studies pro
grams, presidential speeches, and
Japanese language and technology are a
mere mouse click away. Some of the links
will land the user onto Web sites within
Japan itself.
Although USJTMC primarily employs
graduate students, the Web site encour
ages undergraduate participation by hir
ing students to help construct Web pages.
In discussing the various offerings
that the Center has for undergraduates,
Dasher emphasized the many classes and
seminars that originate through

USJTMC. In conjunction with the for
eign language department, the Center
offers courses in Modern Japan and
Reading Technical Japanese.
The variety of seminars, often led by
guests visiting from Japanese companies,
cover a full range of subjects from optical
electronics to surviving as a gaijin (for
eigner) in Japan.
Another service offered by the Center
is a 'video bridge' to Japan. In May of
1993, the Center linked two live video
conferences from Tokyo to Stanford.
Since then, the USJTMC has retained
the technology to transmit live video con
ferences between the two countries over
telephone wires.
