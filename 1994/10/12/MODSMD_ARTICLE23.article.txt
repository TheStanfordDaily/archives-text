# Many interactions among particles in the universe
## Theory of Everything would unite forces

Tower accelerates to painful
velocities, or what bronzes sun
bathers on Wilbur field? Better
yet, is there a connection between
the two?
Physicists have studied the
reasons for diverse actions and
interactions in the universe and
determined that the forces are in
fact related. Current research
tries to unify the four universal
forces, electromagnetism, weak
and strong forces and gravity,
into a comprehensive "Theory of
Everything."
Lance Dixon, associate profes
sor at SLAC, explained that such
a theory would reflect the ele
gance and order of the universe
by explaining its observable inter
actions.
Scientists define four univer
sal forces according to observed

fundamental interactions
between matter and energy. The
strong force binds together
quarks inside protons, while the
weak force causes radioactive
nuclear decay, including the pro
cess that emits beta particles
from atomic nuclei.
Electromagnetic forces exist in
different forms of radiation like
visible light, radio waves, X-rays
and other frequencies of the elec
tromagnetic spectrum. Gravity
shapes planetary orbits, causes
oceanic tidal patterns, and
anchors physical objects to the
earth's surface.
In the 19705, theories emerged
to unify three of the four forces.
The various models fused into
form grand unified theories.
Despite the successful incorpora
tion of three forces, gravity was
the pariah in the proposed mod
els; the force of gravity did not fit
into theoretical explanations
describing the other three forces.

Einstein's theory of general
relativity explained gravity, but
relativity did not describe gravita
tional forces in quantum mechan
ical terms. Quantum mechanics,
the study of interactions between
subatomic particles, remained
irreconciled with gravity until the
reappearance of superstring theo
ry.
Superstring theory previously
existed as an explanation for
strong interactions, Dixon said.
The theory is constructed in a
quantum mechanical framework
and also offers a theoretical expla
nation for gravity. In the effort to
unite the four universal forces,
superstring theory found
renewed life as a potential 'Theo
ry of Everything.'
Superstring theory advances
string theory, which addresses
the nature of subatomic particles.
According to string theory, basic
particles like electrons and pro

tons are not unique, point-like
particles, but are actually the
same string-shaped particles in
different vibrational modes or
states.
The different modes give rise
to particles of distinct behavior
and appearance. Dixon described
the graviton, photon, weak boson
and gluon as the corresponding
particles mediating between the
four forces: gravity, electromag
netism, weak and strong forces.
String theory offers a promising
model because it explains all par
ticles at a fundamental level.
Superstring theory enhances
string theory by adding super
symmetry to the theory. Sub
atomic particles are described in
terms of different spin states;
supersymmetry relates particles
with different spins to each other.
For example, supersymmetry
pairs subatomic fermions like
electrons with bosons like the
photon.
To test the Theory of Every
thing, physicists compare the pro
posed theory to current knowl
edge about elementary particles
and their interactions.
The generally accepted Stan
dard Model divides elementary
particles into two classes: matter
particles like fermions or quarks,
and force carriers like bosons or
photons.
The Standard Model summa
rizes this information and is the
general model against which new
theories are tested. Tests of
superstring theory indicate that
it is consistent with the Standard
Model.
Superstring theory describes
space-time in ten dimensions,
Dixon said. The extra six dimen
sions are "compacted" or rolled
up into tiny structures, he added.
Superstring theorists treat the
extra six dimensions differently,
producing a multitude of alterna
tive models.
Each model explains gravity as
well as the other three forces.
However, some proposals have
been eliminated, because they
imply the existence of particles
that contradict experimental
observations.
The variety of string theories
provides opportunities for farther
investigation. Many superstring
theorists have abandoned the
attempt to analyze each of the
theories individually.
Instead, they are focusing on the
more fundamental aspects of
superstring theory. By doing so,
researchers hope to find a general
theoretical model that will reconcile
gravity with quantum mechanics.
