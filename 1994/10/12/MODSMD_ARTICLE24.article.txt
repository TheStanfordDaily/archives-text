—Burned in Branner
A: Don't tell me you're one of
those people who painted
stuff all over their body at the
first football game and ended up
three days later with a huge tree

burned into their chest
or "Branner Rules" writ
ten down their arm.
Don't worry, it'll proba
bly be gone by the time
you go home for Thanks
giving (as the Bug
learned from experi
ence).
So you want to know
how you got into this
uncomfortable situa
tion? Well, as you know,
the sun puts out more
than just the light we
can see. It also emits
radio waves, infrared
waves (that's what

makes you feel warm when
you're laying out), and ultravio
let (UV) radiation.
It's the UV that's treating you
wrong; UV does more damage
than its solar relatives. As higher
frequency radiation, UV light
carries more energy. It pummels
your protective skin layer, and
the UV rays tear apart whatever
they encounters. Several dam
aging effects emerge in the wake
of this destruction.
First, the solar bombardment
destroys the proteins in your
skin that make it rubbery and
resilient. Your body replaces
them with a substance called ela
stone that does a below average
job of holding your skin tight.
You end up prematurely wrin
kled and saggy.
UV also rips into your DNA
and can actually change the
genetic code for cells by knocking
out parts of the molecule. Some
times this simply kills the cell,
but other times it makes the cell
grow uncontrollably. These psy
chotic cells are the basis of skin
cancer.
Amidst all this havoc, soma of
your pain sensors get damaged.
The cells are the same ones that
tell you when you have your
hand in the fire, so they evoke a
similar reaction.
The sensors begin simply by
bringing more blood up to the

damaged area to help the repair
process. Rising blood makes the
burned area red and also makes
it feel warm. Contrary to popular
opinion, a sunburn does not feel
warm because of residual heat
escaping through the surface of
the skin. Instead, it's just all the
warm blood coming to the res
cue.
If the damage gets worse,
your body starts to protect itself
by sending up more fluids and

white bloods cells,
and you end up with
a blister.
When the body
realizes it's being
harassed by radia
tion, it starts to
defend itself. Cells
increase production
of melanin, a pig
ment which acts as a
natural sunblock to
absorb ultraviolet
radiation.
Melanin is pro
duced deep within
the skin and slowly
snreads ud to the sur-

face. This explains why you burn
quickly but the tan doesn't
appear until several days later.
Now on to sunblock. Most
sunblock is simply moisturizer
with a chemical to absorb ultra
violet radiation; it allows visible
light to pass through so the skin
doesn't look pigmented after
applying the lotion.
Of course, we're provided
with a natural sunblock of sorts
— the ozone layer. Ozone gas
consists of three oxygen
molecules bonded together. The
vapor is actually poisonous to
breathe. Ozone gas exists in a
layer in the upper reaches of the
atmosphere and absorbs ultravi
olet radiation while allowing the
transmission of other types of
solar radiation.
Unfortunately, ozone is a rel
atively unstable molecule, and
all the noxious chemicals we're
throwing up there are starting to
deplete the ozone layer. The bot
tom line — you'd have to put on
a lot of suntan lotion to achieve
the level of protection that ozone
provides.
Glass also acts as a sunblock.
Because it does not transmit
ultraviolet light, you can't get a
tan by driving in a car or sitting
by a window.

know that there are actually two
ranges of ultraviolet radiation:
UV—A and UV—B. Damaging
UV—A frequencies actually burn
you, while UV—B triggers your
skin cells to start the tanning
process. That's how some sun
blocks allow you to get a deep
bronze tan without getting
burned first.
You may also be wondering
why your skin turns dark in the
sun, but your hair turns light.
The main difference is that skin
is alive, whereas the hair is dead.
Living skin constantly produces
new melanin.
However, once part of your
hair leaves the follicle, it already
contains all the pigment it will
ever have. The sunlight can slow
ly bleach these pigments and
lighten your hair, but no new pig
ment comes to the rescue.
Well, this is probably more
than you really wanted to know
about the sun. Just keep it all in
mind if you plan on breaking out
the paint again for Big Game.
