## No. 1 volleyball focused despite ranking Grace under pressure 
### Seth Goldstein Staff writer 
In 1992, the currently No. 1 and undefeated Stan
ford women's volleyball team won the National Cham
pionship. It had been ranked No. 2 most of the season,
just behind Pacific 10 Conference rival UCLA. But in
the all-important NCAA tournament, the Cardinal
upset a Bruin club that had been hailed as one of the
greatest teams ever and captured the title of champion
for itself.
Last year, because of its status as defending cham
pion, the Stanford team was named the pre-season No.
1 pick. But this ranking fell by the wayside when the
Cardinal traveled to Los Angeles and fell to both USC
and UCLA. After being eliminated in the Sweet Sixteen
by the Bruins, Stanford finished the '93 campaign
ranked tied for sixth in the nation.
As a result, over the last two years the team has
learned some valuable lessons about No. 1 rankings
and other predictions, and what exactly they mean.
And they feel that these lessons will help them keep the
No. 1 ranking in perspective and bear the burden of
being labeled the best team in the nation.
"It really doesn't mean anything," said head coach
Don Shaw of the ranking. "It's just paper. We could
afford to lose it now, because the [NCAA] tournament
is what matters."
"So we started at No. 1," said junior setter Cary
Wendell. "But we know it's only a ranking. We still
have to prove it, first to ourselves and then to everyone
else."
Wendell was with the team last year and experi
enced the squad's fall from the pinnacle of the volley
ball world. This year, she contends, things are different
— and not just in terms of talent.
"I don't like to compare this year to last year," she
said. "We're a whole new team this year. Some of the
components are the same, but as a whole it's different.
We have a whole new approach this year."
This approach includes coming out strong and
aggressive for each and every match. At times last year,
Wendell felt the team may have been playing more ten
tatively than it should have been. Not this year.
"We are definitely more aggressive this year. We
want to go out and hammer every opponent," Wendell
continued. "We're not playing just to avoid losing and
keep the ranking, but to have fun."
This is the attitude to have, according to Shaw.
Still, he maintains that the team must balance the
push for excellence with a tolerance for less than excel
lent days.
"There starts to be a pressure to play perfectly all
the time," he said. "But even when you're winning, you

don't play perfectly all the time. If you're disappointed
with your wins, then you're not having fun and what
good is that?"
Players believe that this pressure comes from inside
and not from the hype that surrounds the No. 1 rank
ing and an unblemished record. This being the case,
they say it's a good thing.
"I wouldn't even call it pressure," said freshman set
ter Lisa Sharpley. "It's more like desire. We think of it

as reaching for our potential. I think we've done a pret
ty good job so far."
Even as Shaw keeps his squad looking towards
what's to come, he admits that he needs the players to
keep him focused.
"It's more the players reminding me fnot to worry
about the ranking), than me reminding them," he said.
