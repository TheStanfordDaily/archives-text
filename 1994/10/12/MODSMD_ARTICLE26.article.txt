Knocking the Cardinal out of
first place in the Northern Pacif
ic Conference, University of the
Pacific ended the Stanford field
hockey team's four-game win
ning streak with a 3-1 victory on
Saturday. The Cardinal (2-2 in
NorPac, 5-6 overall) redeemed
itself by capturing its other two
games this weekend, 3-0 over
Davis and Elkins College and 11-
0 over Santa Clara.
"We played really well on Fri
day [against Davis and Elkins],"
said head coach Sheryl Johnson.
"We didn't play as well [against
Pacific!.. .we just weren't on our
game."

Pacific opened the scoring, but
Stanford came right back, tying
the game on a penalty corner.
After the ball was passed in,
senior midfielder Tina Syer
stopped the ball for sophomore
Amy Marfil, who put her shot in
the back of the net.
The Tigers took control of the
game in the second half. Pacific
forward Emily Dushane scored
12 minutes into the half and
Emily Porter's goal five minutes
later clinched the victory for the
Tigers.
"Emily Dushane was totally
on her game," said Syer. "The
defense had a tough time stop
ping her."

Saturday's game.
The Cardinal' played without
junior midfielder Elise Morgan,
who partially tore the lateral collat
eral ligament in her knee in Fri
day's win over Davis and Elkins.
Late in the first half, Morgan went
for a pass in the middle of the circle,

where she was knocked on her right
side with her foot still planted. In
the Cardinal's first meeting with
the Tigers on Sept. 24, Morgan
scored both goals in Stanford's 2-1
win.
"I don't think Ithe game against
Pacificl was one of our better
games," Marfil said.
In the Friday game, Syer assist
ed on all three of the Cardinal's
goals. Late in the first half, Syer cut

from the left side of the field toward
the goal. After she was cut off, she
passed the ball off to freshman mid
fielder Paige Mader, who then
scored her first goal for Stanford.
Syer's second assist came when she
drove from the right side of the field
and set up junior forward Jennifer
Glueck.
Stanford scored its final goal off
a penalty corner in the second half.
Syer stopped the inbound pass from

sophomore forward Melissa
Mueller, and Marfil then fired the
ball past the Senator's goalie for the
score.
The Cardinal defense dominated
throughout the contest, limiting
the Senators to two shots. Stanford
had 23 shots on goal.
"We played extremely well on
Friday," Syer said. "Davis and
Elkins was better than we
thought."

In its last game of the weekend,
the Cardinal thrashed Santa Clara,
a club team, in a scrimmage game
which does not count towards Stan
ford's overall record.
Cardinal players scored 10 goals
in the first half, two each by Syer,
Marfil and sophomore forward
Susan Fishman. Marfil shot four
goals in the three weekend games to
raise her season total to seven.
In the second half, freshman goalie

Kelly Nay lor played for Santa Clara,
whose goalie was injured, and she lim
ited the Cardinal to just one goaL
Stanford used the game to
experiment with players in differ
ent positions and to hone their
skills, Marfil said.
The weekend games had their
ups and downs, according to Syer.
"At times, it was the best we've ever
played together," she said. "It was a
mixed bag."
