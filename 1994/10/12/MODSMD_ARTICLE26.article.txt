Knocking the Cardinal out of
first place in the Northern Pacif
ic Conference, University of the
Pacific ended the Stanford field
hockey team's four-game win
ning streak with a 3-1 victory on
Saturday. The Cardinal (2-2 in
NorPac, 5-6 overall) redeemed
itself by capturing its other two
games this weekend, 3-0 over
Davis and Elkins College and 11-
0 over Santa Clara.
"We played really well on Fri
day [against Davis and Elkins],"
said head coach Sheryl Johnson.
"We didn't play as well [against
Pacific!.. .we just weren't on our
game."

Pacific opened the scoring, but
Stanford came right back, tying
the game on a penalty corner.
After the ball was passed in,
senior midfielder Tina Syer
stopped the ball for sophomore
Amy Marfil, who put her shot in
the back of the net.
The Tigers took control of the
game in the second half. Pacific
forward Emily Dushane scored
12 minutes into the half and
Emily Porter's goal five minutes
later clinched the victory for the
Tigers.
"Emily Dushane was totally
on her game," said Syer. "The
defense had a tough time stop
ping her."
