# Ego come, money go

### 
I have never experienced the degenerate
habits which flourish in the seedy underbelly of
society.
Never stuck my face into the undeoderized
arinpit of

obsessive com
pulsive behav
ior. Never once
compromised
my apathetic X
generation
standing by
doing anything
worthy of
debate or even
dinner conver
sation.

And then I was flattered. Seduced and but
tered up in the most irresistible way. Like an ego
maniac being orgasmically pleasured by a seaful
of sirens harmonizing praise and adulation. Like
a naive calf afforded an extra suckle at its moth
er's nipple. I was weak, I couldn't resist — the
fruit was just too damn tempting.
One nice word, one barely detectable inflec
tion in his voice which indicated a compliment
was all that was needed. And while I idiotically
stumbled over monosyllabic expressions of
thanks, he popped a question — the question.
"Do you want to join a weekly football pool?"
"Ugghhhhuh," was my eloquent (and singu
lar) contribution to the conversation.
That obviously translated into an affirmative
response, and he proceeded to educate this
dullard in the art of betting against the line and
picking scores to preclude a tie in his elaborate
setup.
No problem, home teams are in caps, the
favored team in the left column, the underdog in
the right and the spread in the middle. If you
pick the favorite, that team has to cover the
spread.
Sleek system. Cool bookie. New temptation —
a little different than underaged drinking, but
nonetheless worthy of experimentation.
I admit, I gave into temptation. He hit the
egomaniac's G-spot, and I was instantly willing
