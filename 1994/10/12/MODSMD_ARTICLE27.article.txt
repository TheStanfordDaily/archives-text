# Ego come, money go
## 
### 
I have never experienced the degenerate
habits which flourish in the seedy underbelly of
society.
Never stuck my face into the undeoderized
arinpit of

obsessive com
pulsive behav
ior. Never once
compromised
my apathetic X
generation
standing by
doing anything
worthy of
debate or even
dinner conver
sation.

And then I was flattered. Seduced and but
tered up in the most irresistible way. Like an ego
maniac being orgasmically pleasured by a seaful
of sirens harmonizing praise and adulation. Like
a naive calf afforded an extra suckle at its moth
er's nipple. I was weak, I couldn't resist — the
fruit was just too damn tempting.
One nice word, one barely detectable inflec
tion in his voice which indicated a compliment
was all that was needed. And while I idiotically
stumbled over monosyllabic expressions of
thanks, he popped a question — the question.
"Do you want to join a weekly football pool?"
"Ugghhhhuh," was my eloquent (and singu
lar) contribution to the conversation.
That obviously translated into an affirmative
response, and he proceeded to educate this
dullard in the art of betting against the line and
picking scores to preclude a tie in his elaborate
setup.
No problem, home teams are in caps, the
favored team in the left column, the underdog in
the right and the spread in the middle. If you
pick the favorite, that team has to cover the
spread.
Sleek system. Cool bookie. New temptation —
a little different than underaged drinking, but
nonetheless worthy of experimentation.
I admit, I gave into temptation. He hit the
egomaniac's G-spot, and I was instantly willing

to discard my suburbian, middle
class values and disillusion myself
with grandeurs beyond the capaci
ty of my bump-on-the-log exis
tence.
Like the middle-aged, middle
of-the-road, going-nowhere-this
hfetime statistic-of-a-person who
pathetically clings to her weekly
lottery ticket as her only hope of
earthly salvation, I too, wanted
easy money.
How hard could it be? Our pal
Hillary made a killing in the
futures market, and football must
be a shade easier to predict than
pork bellies and various other live
stock innards.
And how effortless it was. I e
mailed my predictions, secured an
1.0. U. on the bet and slowly
slipped into that catatonic state
common to most fans who begin
watching football on Saturday and
finally remember to blink after the
conclusion of the Monday Night
game.
During that 48-hour stretch 1
actually experienced emotions
spurred by a Rams turnover or a
Saints fumble. Who in their right
minds cares if the Rams turned the
ball over or not? Why was I so dis
appointed when the Prudential
Halflime report announced that
the Broncos had won?
Why in the world was 1 pump
ing my fist and slamming on the
walls after the Raiders beat the
Pats? Why did I watch so many
damned football games?
It's absurd, emotionally drain

ing and academically destructive.
Like a freshman salivating over
the prospects of Fruit Loops as a
healthy Food Service alternative, I
was desperately starved for a little
substance, a little something to
keep me going.
Forgive me Father, for I have
sinned. I picked Phoenix over Dal
las with a 13 point spread because
Euddy Ryan made me believe (Dal
las won 38-3), and it was all down
hill from there.
Sentimentality, senility, and
gullibility tormented me as I
picked the Chiefs over the Charg
ers. After that, the Broncos
mauled me while I was down. Like
a snowball headed for hell, the
Boston College victory over Notre
Dame sealed my fate. Who woulda
thunk it?
Even with Stanford's purported
grade inflation, I still fell miserably
below the mean, flying off the
steep end of the curve, not even
deserving of a C-. I failed.
My ego, which had been stroked
and pampered only days before,
now lies bruised, battered and
drunk with delirium in some rat
infested sewage drain. I fell for the
old carrot on a stick routine. My
ego will hate me forever.
One little insinuation about my
(obviously non-existent) football
savvy sent me into a morally com
promising tailspin. Yeah, whether
or not to suffer the slings and
arrows of outrageous fortune.
Tomorrow I mail out that $2
check I owe.

Kathryn will spend the rest of the
week nursing her bruised ego and
rebuilding her confidence before
Saturday's football game.
