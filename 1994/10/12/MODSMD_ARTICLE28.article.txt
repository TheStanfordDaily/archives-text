# The 						ruggers return
## Cardinal rugby ready for action 
### John Lawson 
Quick, what was the most popu
lar sport on the Stanford campus
from 1906 to 1919?
Football? Nope.
Baseball? Guess again.
Basketball? Not even close.
No, it was the sport of rugby —

you know the one, where men in lit
tle shorts run around a field in what
looks like complete chaos.
Since American football was
banned by the University President
for being too violent, Stanford
rugby represented the school for 14
years in Big Game, sometimes
drawing crowds of 25,000 specta

tors. Although football came back to
campus in 1919, Stanford still pro
vided most of the players for the
United States Rugby National
Team, which won gold medals at
the 1920 and 1924 Olympic Games.
Into this tradition of excellence
marches the 1994-95 Cardinal
men's rugby team. Demoted to club

status with the retirement of leg
endary coach Pete Kmenovic in
1977, the Cardinal has been resur
rected under the guidance of
French-born Franck Boivert, who
has coached the team since 1988. In
recognition of his prowess to devel
op a team to its potential, Boivert
was named head coach of the U.S.
women's rugby team in 1993.
"We are really fortunate to have
him," said senior club vice-presi
dent Robert Blunt. "He is one of
the most recognized coaches in the
sport; he knows his stuff." Boivert
is returning to Stanford tomorrow
from New Caledonia in the South
Pacific where he spends his sum
mers as the national team's rugby
director.

Under Boivert's leadership, the
men's rugby team has exceeded the
expectations of many of its detrac
tors. Along with winning the pres
tigious Santa Barbara Tourna
ment in 1992, the team has fin
ished with a second-place ranking
in the Pacific Coast region twice in
the last four years, including last
season.
As is the trademark of Boivert's
teams, last year's squad entered
the year with very few experienced
rugby players. But through hard
work and a winning attitude, the
team took down those from UC-
Santa Barbara and Cal Poly San
Luis Obispo in the Pacific Coast
Championships. Both had beaten

the Cardinal in early-season
matches.
The ruggers lost the champi
onship game to Cal, who went on to
defeat Navy in the national finals.
The title was an unprecedented
seventh straight for Cal, a streak
that senior rugby president Jeff
Freund would love to end in his last
year at Stanford.
"As always, we lost a few players
to graduation last year," he said.
"But we still have a good nucleus of
veterans to complement the
tremendous number of freshmen
(48) who turned out this fall. Any
one is beatable on a given day, and
I think we have the talent to give
Cal a run for their money this

year."
Freund and Blunt were delight
ed to see such a large freshman
turnout, as was senior rugby cap
tain Nathan Dunn.
"Lots of the guys who came out
are in the mold of a football play
er," Dunn said. "We've been rela
tively small compared to other
schools and the big guys should
really help us out this year."
The season gets underway the
last weekend of October when the
team travels to Los Angeles to play
against UCLA and either Long
Beach State or USC. The Cardinal
has a few match-ups scheduled for
the fall, including the Alumni
match and the Stanford Tens

Tournament, but the season kicks
into high gear during winter quar
ter with home games at Maloney
Field against Sacramento St., UC-
Davis, and Colorado.
The team plans to travel to
either England or Canada during
spring break in preparation for the
Big Game against Cal on April 8.
It's then on to the Pacific Coast
Playoffs the following week, and
hopefully, the national finals the
week thereafter.
"The winner of the [Pacific
Coast] playoffs should have a free
walk to the national champi
onship," Dunn said.
Although teams from the Ivy
League and military colleges are

competitive and more people from
the East Coast know about the
sport, western teams have long
dominated those from the east.
The trifecta of Freund, Blunt,
and Dunn encourage all those
interested in getting some exercise
and competing for a national cham
pionship to come to a rugby prac
tice. Because there are A, B, and C
teams, all those who stay with the
sport get to play in the games.
"Don't be afraid to come out and
play," urges Blunt. "None of us had
really played an organized match
until we came to Stanford, but that
hasn't stopped us from beating
teams with more experienced play
ers."

Santa Barbara and Cal Poly San
Luis Obispo in the Pacific Coast
Championships. Both had beaten

the Cardinal in early-season
matches.
The ruggers lost the champi
onship game to Cal, who went on to
defeat Navy in the national finals.
The title was an unprecedented
seventh straight for Cal, a streak
that senior rugby president Jeff
Freund would love to end in his last
year at Stanford.
"As always, we lost a few players
to graduation last year," he said.
"But we still have a good nucleus of
veterans to complement the
tremendous number of freshmen
(48) who turned out this fall. Any
one is beatable on a given day, and
I think we have the talent to give
Cal a run for their money this

year."
Freund and Blunt were delight
ed to see such a large freshman
turnout, as was senior rugby cap
tain Nathan Dunn.
"Lots of the guys who came out
are in the mold of a football play
er," Dunn said. "We've been rela
tively small compared to other
schools and the big guys should
really help us out this year."
The season gets underway the
last weekend of October when the
team travels to Los Angeles to play
against UCLA and either Long
Beach State or USC. The Cardinal
has a few match-ups scheduled for
the fall, including the Alumni
match and the Stanford Tens

Tournament, but the season kicks
into high gear during winter quar
ter with home games at Maloney
Field against Sacramento St., UC-
Davis, and Colorado.
The team plans to travel to
either England or Canada during
spring break in preparation for the
Big Game against Cal on April 8.
It's then on to the Pacific Coast
Playoffs the following week, and
hopefully, the national finals the
week thereafter.
"The winner of the [Pacific
Coast] playoffs should have a free
walk to the national champi
onship," Dunn said.
Although teams from the Ivy
League and military colleges are

competitive and more people from
the East Coast know about the
sport, western teams have long
dominated those from the east.
The trifecta of Freund, Blunt,
and Dunn encourage all those
interested in getting some exercise
and competing for a national cham
pionship to come to a rugby prac
tice. Because there are A, B, and C
teams, all those who stay with the
sport get to play in the games.
"Don't be afraid to come out and
play," urges Blunt. "None of us had
really played an organized match
until we came to Stanford, but that
hasn't stopped us from beating
teams with more experienced play
ers."
