A sophomore hailing from Arcadia, Calif., Erin Martin has had a sensa
tional season thus far on the undefeated women's soccer squad. Leading
the team with nine points, she contributed all of the Cardinal's goals in
the team's last two games against USD and St. Mary's. Although she
twisted her ankle in the first half of Sunday's game, it did not prevent
her from finding the back of the goal twice. Against the Toreroes, Mar
tin notched her second consecutive two-goal game, exactly one year after
achieving the same distinction last season.

Freshman midfielder Eric Vandevelde has taken up much of the slack
despite several injuries to his teammates, shining particularly bright
against the Hornets. Scoring two of the team's three goals on Friday*,
he displayed the experience of a veteran in helping to redirect the team
to its winning ways. I
