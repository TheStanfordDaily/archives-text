## Students start ballet group to fill classical dance void 
### Karin Geldfeld 
Until recently, Stanford dance has been as
sociated more with modern genres than classi
cal ballet. But a new student dance company,
the Stanford Ballet, is now preparing to take
center stage on campus.
In the past, with only two ballet classes of
fered here, students with previous ballet expe
rience have had to stop dancing. Last spring,
however, former professional dancers Julia
Ball and Jennifer Mott — both juniors — de
cided to change this, forming their own ballet
company.
"I thought about [starting the group] before
I came to Stanford because there isn't a whole
lot of ballet here," Ball said. "Basically, there
are very good dancers here, and they've had to
quit since they've come."
Some members of the new student group
have danced for up to 13 years before coming to
Stanford, she added.
Senior Sondra Ward, who said she had
danced all of her life, is one such member.
"It's hard to come [to Stanford] with serious
ballet background since there's not a lot of at
tention to ballet here," she said.
Although Ward has practiced various dance
forms on campus — such as jazz and dancing
with the Dollies — she finds that "having an ac-

tual ballet company opens up a
lot of new opportunities."
Starting the group was some
what difficult said Ball, the direc
tor.
She and Mott, the business
manager, founded the group dur
ing spring quarter last year and
because of their late start-up,
they missed the cycle for ASSU
funding.
Consequently, they held free
ballet classes every Sunday for
anyone who was interested, but
didn't put on any performances.
They also participated in the
Dance Department's end of the
quarter showing.
"We've had to struggle and
met up with barriers," Ball said.
"Some people weren't very sup
portive."
Finding times and places for
rehearsals and performances
was not always easy, she added,
but now the group has gotten on
its feet and is preparing to per
form Tchaikovsky's holiday

classic the Nutcracker in
December.
Both Ball and Mott said there
is little funding available for bal
let, and that the dance depart
ment is more focused on modern
dance rather than classical bal
let.
Last weekend, the group held
a car wash, raising $200, and
worked for the Alumni Associa
tion — both as fundraisers. They
hope to spark the interests of
alumni who are interested in bal
let and receive donations. They
have also applied for ASSU funds
this year.
At the Activities Fair, Stan
ford Ballet had a table and
received enthusiastic responses
from over 50 students, almost all
of whom are in the cast for the
Nutcracker, as well as under
studies.
"We've tried to involve people
in any possible way," Ball said.
The range of dance experi
ence in the group varies from
having completed the second
ballet level at Stanford to pro
fessional dancers, like Ball and
Mott.
Starting last week, the Stan

ford Ballet began rehearsing
every Friday from 5 to 8 p.m. at
Roble. Rehearsals are open.
"It went really well, every
body got along great and we
taught most of the dance," Mott
said.
"We taught a lot more than we
expected, and now we can
rehearse for the next seven
weeks,"she added.
"[Ball and MottJ run the
rehearsals very professionally,"
said freshman Kate Stinger, a
member of the group. "IStanford
Balletl is different in that they
care about their dancers."
Aside from rehearsing for the
December performance, the
group will also be performing at
various senior citizen homes and
children's hospitals.
They have three performances
scheduled for December, before
their Nutcracker performance on
campus.
Ball, who choreographs and
chooses musical selections, said
dancing is "special and unique on
a spiritual level ... I feel like I
can express myself through
dance — that I am best revealed
through dance."
