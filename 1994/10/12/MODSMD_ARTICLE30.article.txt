# Eight men out
## Joy riders caught in stolen golf cart 
### September Treviño Staff writer 
The case of a stolen golf cart
was solved quickly last week
when police stopped several
men joy riding across campus
in the vehicle.
Last Wednesday night
around 11 p.m., a Suites resi
dent reported that the golf cart
she had parked just outside of
her Governor's Corner resi
dence was missing.
Just minutes after the
authorities had been alerted,
police deputies spotted a golf
cart packed with eight males
proceeding south past the
Lambda Nu House.
Deputies stopped the men
and detained them for ques
tioning, but decided not to
press charges.

Raoul Niemeyer said it "looks
like a fraternity bunch of guys"
were involved.
"They picked up their bud
dies," he said. "They were rid
ing around and got caught."
The scope of possible
charges ranged upward from
joy riding — a misdemeanor —
to possession of stolen proper
ty, which is a felony.
But "in the interests of justice,"
Niemeyer said, the police did not
charge the eight men, since
they cooperated with the police,
there was no sign of drunken
ness or unruly behavior, and the
golf cart sustained no damages.
"The cart was returned to
the young lady and she's
happy," Niemeyer said.
Authorities believe the inci
dent was a prank and that the
eight men intended to return
the vehicle.
