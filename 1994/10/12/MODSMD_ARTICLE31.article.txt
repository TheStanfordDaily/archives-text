Who says Stanford alumni
don't give money?
Taking over from the ASSU, a
group of Stanford graduates will
be awarding an entrepreneurial
grant of $10,000 to the best
undergraduate business proposal
submitted by next January.
The ASSU, which created and
administered the $10,000 grant
last year, is still involved in the
competition that it began last
year. Now, however, Trilogy — a
Texas-based software-engineer
ing company — has stepped to the
forefront and will provide the sole
funding for the grant.
Trilogy was founded by a
group of Stanford graduates who
developed their start-up idea five
years ago, while they were still
students. Their idea for software
engineering was so successful
that they received a million-dollar
contract from Hewlett Packard to

produce software.
Five years later, their business
is thriving and the founders want
to give something back to similar
ly enterprising students.
"Trilogy has strong ties to the

community and it is a credit to
their company that they are
attempting to reward the
entrepreneurial spirit," said
ASSU Financial Manager Gabe
Lucas, who will be working close
ly with Trilogy during the appli
cation process.
Last year, the ASSU voted on a
bill to create and provide funding
for the grant, which essentially
became an ASSU business pro
ject, Lucas said. In addition, a

board was elected to oversee the
distribution of funds.
Lucas said the ASSU is "more
of a facilitator rather than an ini
tiator this year. Senate approval
won't be needed because the
grant doesn't involve ASSU
money.
"Also, the ASSU can play more
of an advisory role, with its
knowledge and expertise gained
from a year ago," he added.
Last year's grant winner,
senior Jason Garoutte, started
the "Disc Connection," a CD store
located on the second floor of
Tresidder. The store opened on
Sept. 28.
"Everything involved in the
grant program has run fairly
smoothly, and the ASSU has been
in an amiable partnership,"
Garoutte said.
The ASSU, in conjunction
with Trilogy, will be at the Career
Faire this Friday, Oct. 14, to
answer questions about the com
petition.
