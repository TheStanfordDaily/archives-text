## Large turnouts hopeful en route to Nationals 
### Cindy Buchner 
Stanford is the ultimate place.
From pick-up games to organized teams that
vie for the national collegiate title, it's one
school where ultimate frisbee is enjoyed by
almost everyone.
The Stanford men's ultimate team is spend
ing this fall training for the National Champi
onships in the spring. After finishing second at
last year's nationals, the Cardinal is looking to
capture it all this year.
"We want to focus from day one," said coter
minal student Azran Osman-Rani.
With only half of last year's A-team members
returning, Stanford will look to a fresh crop ot
players this season.
"There is a good opportunity for new players
to step up and be on one of the best teams in the
nation," said junior Mike Payne, a second year
player.
According to Osman-Rani, approximately 60
to 70 people have turned out for the team, liken
able to "a sea of bodies." The Cardinal will also
be drawing from the B-team players and return
ing A members, who will serve a very fundamen
tal role on the team, he said. The co-captains
perform the role of coaches and will be aided by
alumni during the teaching and building period
this fall.
The sport of ultimate has undergone a build
ing period of its own since the invention of the
disc 37 years ago and the game's conception ten
years later. Ultimate involves lots of running
and making big plays that include diving and
jumping.
These "adrenaline-type moves are a way to
get really pumped-up," Osman-Rani said. Play
ers are proud of bruises that result from these
spectacular athletic moves, as explained by their
motto "disc over body."
In the true spirit of the game, both teams
applaud when a player makes a thrilling move.
Similarly, athletes call their own fouls in ulti
mate; the absence of referees takes off the edge
of competition and is a symbol of the cama
raderie.
The unique spirit of the sport is also reflected
in the ultimate team names.
The Stanford men call themselves Blood
thirsty while the women are dubbed the Disco
Inferno. Their choice of dress is yet another
form of ultimate players' self-expression. These
vary from men's skirts to tie-dyed t-shirts to tra
ditional uniforms.
For those interested in joining the action,
practices are held Monday, Wednesday, and Fri
day at 3:15 on Roble field.

Jesse Roach aim high.
