# Rice reveals next phase of budget plan
## 
### Scott Van Winkle Staff writer 
After a year of cuts marked by stu
dent protest and controversy, the Uni
versity's budget-reduction process
will likely shift from basic belt-tight
ening to a less visible, more structural
phase this year, University Provost
Condoleezza Rice said in an interview
yesterday.
Even in the wake of record contri
butions from individual donors and
the University's fund-raising division,

fiscal trimming must continue, she
said.
The problems remain in part be
cause the nature of giving to Stanford
remains unchanged, with large major
gifts and other "restricted funds"
going to specific projects and not as a
lump sum contribution to the Univer
sity. Therefore, even with generous
donors, the University faces a recur
ring shortfall in discretionary or unre
stricted funds.
In addition, the University incurs
costs as a result of projects completed

using restricted
funds, Rice said, and
it often has to pay for
these costs using un
restricted funds.
Vice Provost for
Institutional Plan
ning Geoffrey Cox
said that the Univer
sity is also looking
into methods to make

the distinction between unrestricted
and restricted funds less significant,
such as consolidating the budget.

Because of this division in funds,
the Provost's office directly controls
only about $350 million of the Univer
sity's $1.28 billion budget, said Uni
versity Budget Director Tim Warner.
Rice's stated goal is to save $ 12 mil
lion of that operating budget over the
next two years — a difficult task, espe
cially since the budget has already
shrunk by $71 million over the last
five years.
Continuing to cut requires a new

nating layers of paperwork
approvals with a simple computer
rubric.
Such reforms are more struc
tural and less likely to draw atten
tion than last year's reforms, Rice
said, so they can be carried out
with less input from outside the
administration.
But that doesn't mean more
visible divisions of the University
will escape the budget axe.
Along with revisiting the
strategic plans prepared by most
of the University's administrative
units last year to see if further
savings can be found, Rice said she
would also expect the University's
faculty to "make choices" in set
ting priorities and funding levels.
She said, though, that the Stu

approach, Rice said. "I think
we've cut about as much as we
can in this sort of old-fashioned
belt-tightening," she said.
For that reason, the Provost
created a restructuring task force
a few months ago — headed by
Vice Provost for Institutional
Planning Geoffrey Cox — to "re
engineer" several aspects of the
University's day-to-day opera
tions.

and pays for materials, for exam

dent Affairs unit, responsible for
the administration of ethnic cen
ters and other student services,
will likely be spared from having
to make many cuts this time
around.
After ethnic centers were
asked to consider cutting 15 to 20
percent of their budgets as part of
strategic plans for the next three
years, students launched several
protests to protect the centers.
In the end, Student Affairs

achieved $1.1 million in cuts —
primarily through streamlined
administration and by turning
over management of Tresidder
Student Union to an outside firm
— without trimming ethnic cen
ter budgets.
Rice said one part of the divi
sion, Cowell Student Health Cen
ter, would face greater scrutiny
this year. Cowell Director Ira
Friedman, hired last year, has
now had enough time to identify

the center's strength and weak
nesses, she said.
No particular target has been
set for the academic departments'
budgets, Rice said, because they
are primarily the responsibility of
tenured faculty.
Nonetheless, she said the
administration would continue to
encourage the use of "best prac
tices" among the departments.
Therefore, if one department per
forms some administrative task
more efficiently than others, the
less expensive practice will be
used as a "benchmark" that other
departments will be encouraged
to adhere to, Rice said.
The continued scrutiny is nec
essary to hold cost increases to no
more than 1 percent over infla

tion, she added.
Rice pledged to meet that stan
dard when this year's budget was
approved by the Board of
Trustees last June.
The trustees also approved an
0.5 percent increase in the rate at
which money would be paid to the
University from its endowment
or founding grant at that meet
ing.
Rice said the increase height
ens pressure to control costs,
because of the need to "maintain
(the endowment's) purchasing
power."
A 4.75 percent payout rate
means the endowment must be
well invested in order to avoid an
erosion of the fund's real worth,
Rice said.

Because of this division in funds,
the Provost's office directly controls
only about $350 million of the Univer
sity's $1.28 billion budget, said Uni
versity Budget Director Tim Warner.
Rice's stated goal is to save $ 12 mil
lion of that operating budget over the
next two years — a difficult task, espe
cially since the budget has already
shrunk by $71 million over the last
five years.
Continuing to cut requires a new

Such reforms are more struc
tural and less likely to draw atten
tion than last year's reforms, Rice
said, so they can be carried out
with less input from outside the
administration.
But that doesn't mean more
visible divisions of the University
will escape the budget axe.
Along with revisiting the
strategic plans prepared by most
of the University's administrative
units last year to see if further
savings can be found, Rice said she
would also expect the University's
faculty to "make choices" in set
ting priorities and funding levels.
She said, though, that the Stu

approach, Rice said. "I think
we've cut about as much as we
can in this sort of old-fashioned
belt-tightening," she said.
For that reason, the Provost
created a restructuring task force
a few months ago — headed by
Vice Provost for Institutional
Planning Geoffrey Cox — to "re
engineer" several aspects of the
University's day-to-day opera
tions.

dent Affairs unit, responsible for
the administration of ethnic cen
ters and other student services,
will likely be spared from having
to make many cuts this time
around.
After ethnic centers were
asked to consider cutting 15 to 20
percent of their budgets as part of
strategic plans for the next three
years, students launched several
protests to protect the centers.
In the end, Student Affairs

achieved $1.1 million in cuts —
primarily through streamlined
administration and by turning
over management of Tresidder
Student Union to an outside firm
— without trimming ethnic cen
ter budgets.
Rice said one part of the divi
sion, Cowell Student Health Cen
ter, would face greater scrutiny
this year. Cowell Director Ira
Friedman, hired last year, has
now had enough time to identify

the center's strength and weak
nesses, she said.
No particular target has been
set for the academic departments'
budgets, Rice said, because they
are primarily the responsibility of
tenured faculty.
Nonetheless, she said the
administration would continue to
encourage the use of "best prac
tices" among the departments.
Therefore, if one department per
forms some administrative task
more efficiently than others, the
less expensive practice will be
used as a "benchmark" that other
departments will be encouraged
to adhere to, Rice said.
The continued scrutiny is nec
essary to hold cost increases to no
more than 1 percent over infla

tion, she added.
Rice pledged to meet that stan
dard when this year's budget was
approved by the Board of
Trustees last June.
The trustees also approved an
0.5 percent increase in the rate at
which money would be paid to the
University from its endowment
or founding grant at that meet
ing.
Rice said the increase height
ens pressure to control costs,
because of the need to "maintain
(the endowment's) purchasing
power."
A 4.75 percent payout rate
means the endowment must be
well invested in order to avoid an
erosion of the fund's real worth,
Rice said.
