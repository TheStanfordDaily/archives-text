# Rice reveals next phase of budget plan

### Scott Van Winkle Staff writer 
After a year of cuts marked by stu
dent protest and controversy, the Uni
versity's budget-reduction process
will likely shift from basic belt-tight
ening to a less visible, more structural
phase this year, University Provost
Condoleezza Rice said in an interview
yesterday.
Even in the wake of record contri
butions from individual donors and
the University's fund-raising division,

fiscal trimming must continue, she
said.
The problems remain in part be
cause the nature of giving to Stanford
remains unchanged, with large major
gifts and other "restricted funds"
going to specific projects and not as a
lump sum contribution to the Univer
sity. Therefore, even with generous
donors, the University faces a recur
ring shortfall in discretionary or unre
stricted funds.
In addition, the University incurs
costs as a result of projects completed

using restricted
funds, Rice said, and
it often has to pay for
these costs using un
restricted funds.
Vice Provost for
Institutional Plan
ning Geoffrey Cox
said that the Univer
sity is also looking
into methods to make

the distinction between unrestricted
and restricted funds less significant,
such as consolidating the budget.

Because of this division in funds,
the Provost's office directly controls
only about $350 million of the Univer
sity's $1.28 billion budget, said Uni
versity Budget Director Tim Warner.
Rice's stated goal is to save $ 12 mil
lion of that operating budget over the
next two years â€” a difficult task, espe
cially since the budget has already
shrunk by $71 million over the last
five years.
Continuing to cut requires a new
