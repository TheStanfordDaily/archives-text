# Grad senators want more student involvement
## 
### Jo Marshall Staff writer 
Meeting for the first time outside
the ASSU Senate, several graduate
student senators gathered last night
to identify ways to communicate with
the large and decentralized graduate
population.
Council of Presidents member
Mork Murdock, who is working this
year with graduate affairs, chaired the
meeting and emphasized the need for

stronger ties between the ASSU and
graduate students.
"The fundamental question is
'How do we feel we can really reach
graduate students?' and 'Do we really
want to reach graduate students more
than we are?,' " Murdock said at the
beginning of the meeting.
The 10 senators attending the half
hour meeting spent most of the time
discussing those questions, as well as
the ASSU's value to graduate stu
dents.

Some senators said graduate pro
grams, such as the Law School, that
have their own student government
may not use the ASSU to voice their
problems.
"You don't see many law graduate
students walking through White
Plaza (with undergraduates)," said
graduate senator Marc Oppenheimer.
The group recognized, however,
that many graduate schools did
not have their own student govern
ment. Also, there was full agreement

that issues such as housing and the
special-fee policy were problems that
would be better brought to the forum
oftheASSU.
Murdock also added that there
were many ASSU services available
for graduate students that they may
not be aware of, including the SURE
Escort Service, legal counseling,
Flicks and the Shirt Shak's Cardinal
Collection.
(it dilute senator Curtis Kin
-.lid that • eater graduate involve
ment in the ASSI might also be
beneficial to undergraduates.
If graduates know how the
system works up front, they
might top pulling money out,"
he .said, referring to last year's
drive to entourage graduate stu
dent to request special-fee
refunds.
Murdo' i < iit on to address
w y to t ;it i : ively reach the grad
uate , cxplair.ii : that there was a
problem witl the "diversity of
graduate tudents," many of
whom live off campus.
"It ; obviously going to be eas
ier to re.idi people on campus,"
Murd oc k said.
The group made tentative
plan ton •.••.iduate students
through a variety of methods, like
working with the graduate school
government, and posting notices
by e-mail and on department bul
letin boards.
V\ \< t<> reach them, but
what i; the best way to do it?,"
(jut . ined ( i;iduate senator Rob
Jonas.
The natur: decided that, ini
tially, the would go to graduate
housing meetings attended by
graduate re ident assistants —
starting with the Escondido Vil
lage Family Council meeting
being held tonight to ascertain
whether gi duate are interested
in becoming more involved with
the as.su.
Murdock also suggested that
they or: > in open forum and
invite graduate student RAs and
representatives from various
graduate schools to attend in
order to plain t.o them what the
senators want to accomplish.
"\V want to Iv to work out a
relat ion.- lip i hem, he said.
Ihe graduate nators left the
meeting with mixed feelings
about v. omplished. But

"Id» t t ink we came to any
conch * it brought a lot of
