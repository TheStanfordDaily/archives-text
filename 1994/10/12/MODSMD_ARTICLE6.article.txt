# Grad senators want more student involvement
## 
### Jo Marshall Staff writer 
Meeting for the first time outside
the ASSU Senate, several graduate
student senators gathered last night
to identify ways to communicate with
the large and decentralized graduate
population.
Council of Presidents member
Mork Murdock, who is working this
year with graduate affairs, chaired the
meeting and emphasized the need for

stronger ties between the ASSU and
graduate students.
"The fundamental question is
'How do we feel we can really reach
graduate students?' and 'Do we really
want to reach graduate students more
than we are?,' " Murdock said at the
beginning of the meeting.
The 10 senators attending the half
hour meeting spent most of the time
discussing those questions, as well as
the ASSU's value to graduate stu
dents.

Some senators said graduate pro
grams, such as the Law School, that
have their own student government
may not use the ASSU to voice their
problems.
"You don't see many law graduate
students walking through White
Plaza (with undergraduates)," said
graduate senator Marc Oppenheimer.
The group recognized, however,
that many graduate schools did
not have their own student govern
ment. Also, there was full agreement

that issues such as housing and the
special-fee policy were problems that
would be better brought to the forum
oftheASSU.
Murdock also added that there
were many ASSU services available
for graduate students that they may
not be aware of, including the SURE
Escort Service, legal counseling,
Flicks and the Shirt Shak's Cardinal
Collection.
