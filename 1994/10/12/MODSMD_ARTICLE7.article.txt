# A 						Nobel feat
## Alum, now at Cal, wins top prize in economics 
### 
BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) -
People, companies and nations do
not act blindly — that realization
overthrew classical theories and
led retired professor and Stanford
alumnus John Harsanyi to a Nobel
Prize in Economics, he said yester
day.
The University of California at
Berkeley economic theorist found
that the strategy of chess, poker
and other games provided a better

tool for analyzing human interac
tions.
The U.S. government tapped
that knowledge in the 1960s to
guide arms control negotiations,
universities now teach his theories
as fundamental economics, and
yesterday the Nobel Committee
awarded him its highest prize.
"Perhaps in the long run. . .this
will help all of us have a higher
standard of living and a peaceful,
cooperative world," he said at a
campus news conference.
Harsanyi, 74, the son of a phar
macist, knows games.
In 1944, in the biggest gamble
of his life, the Hungarian-born Jew
calmly walked away from a
Budapest train station where his
group awaited a train to Austria
and ultimately a Nazi death camp.
First he took off his arm band
and other identifying insignia.
"I quietly left the station," said
Harsanyi. "There was a gendarme
there that could have asked for my
papers — but he didn't."
Hidden by Jesuits until the war
ended, Harsanyi soon found him
self in trouble with Hungary's
communist government, and left
in 1950 for Australia and eventual
ly the United States.
Harsanyi had studied sociology,
but was unhappy with its lack of
predictability. He was drawn to
economics, he said, because at least
there were orodictive theories in

that discipline.
But classical economic theory
treated people and institutions as
following blind self-interest. After
studying mathematics and eco
nomics at Stanford, he became
convinced reality was far more
complex — especially in industries
with only a few major participants.
Each entity develops a strategy
that depends in part on the strate
gy of other participants — just as
in chess or poker.
Co-winner John F. Nash of
Princeton University was singled
out for refining the "Nash Equilib
rium," a formula in which players
are given optimal information
about each other's positions to
form their own strategies.
Reinhard Selten of the Univer
sity of Bonn, who co-wrote a book
with Harsanyi on equilibrium
selection in games, was the third
sharing in the prize.
The trio's work was ground
breaking at the time.
"There was no systematic way
to approach this problem,"
Harsanyi said. They "developed a
game of incomplete information,
where each participant knows
much less (about the other) than
he would like to."
