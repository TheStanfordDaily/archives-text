# Campus religious groups come out to support gays
## 
### Rachel Marshant 
In honor of National Coming
Out Day, campus religious leaders
affirmed their commitment to the
gay, lesbian and bisexual commu
nity at a rally in White Plaza yes
terday.
Representatives of campus
Catholic, Episcopalian, Jewish
and Protestant communities par
ticipated in the rally, which was
designed to increase the aware
ness of gay, lesbian and bisexual

religious issues, said organizer
Michael Latz, the program direc
tor for Hillel, a Jewish student or
ganization.
"It's important that clergy
and religious leaders are aware of
the needs and diversity of the
gay, lesbian and bisexual com
munity," Latz said. "The gay,
lesbian and bisexual community
also needs to hear that clergy
support them."
In several short speeches, all the
clergy who attended demonstrated
their support for gays, lesbians and
bisexuals and invited them to join
their respective religious commu
nities.
"United Christian Ministries
joins with the other churches and
welcomes you as full human
beings," Rev. Dona Smith-Powers
said.
While recognizing past and
existing prejudice, the speakers
both expressed hope for the future
and provided a plan for positive
action.
"I think many gays, lesbians
and bisexuals realize religion has
been repressive and the enemy,"
said Rev. Herb Schmidt of the Uni
versity Lutheran Church.
But, he said, "there are many of
us who want to work with them for
full equality, acceptance and jus
tice."
Schmidt outlined a plan for
action which included promoting
acceptance of same-sex marriages,
allowing all men and women —
regardless of sexual orientation —
to be pastors, pursuing justice for
victims of sexual-orientation dis
crimination and encouraging free

discussion.
Smith-Powers pointed to the
recent hiring of a lesbian seminary
intern by the United Campus
Christian Ministry as a step in the
right direction.
Those witnessing the rally wel
comed the support. "It was very
positive to hear how affirming
campus religious organizations
are," said Jeff Shelby, who gradu
ated last year. "As a gay person I
have struggled with my own reli
gion, which is not generally very
accepting."
"I was really impressed by the
extent of the support. It gave me
hope," said junior Allyson Ford.
Latz also said he thinks the pro
gram impacted those who are not a
part of the gay, lesbian and bisexu
al community. "I noticed a lot of
people walking by. For many, it
may have piqued their curiosity,"
he said.
"The more contact people have,
the more used to it they will
become. It will not be such an
anomaly to be religious and homo
sexual," said senior Kerren Hed
lund, who stopped to watch the
rally for a few minutes.
Hearing religious leaders pub
licly supporting gays, lesbians and
bisexuals may also change people's
attitudes, Shelby said.
However, freshman Eric Jack
son said he believes the rally won't

have such an impact. "There
weren't that many people there
and it was mostly for people who
share those views. Personally, it
had no effect on me and I don't
think it will have an effect on the
Stanford population," he said.
Regardless of its effect, Latz
said he believes that the rally was
necessary. "It's important for gays,

lesbians and bisexuals to celebrate
and mark our achievements. It's
important not to be complacent.
We need to keep pressing at the
door and pressing at them to make
room for us," Latz said.
"The gay, lesbian and bisexual
community doesn't need to choose
between religious and sexual iden
tity," he said.
