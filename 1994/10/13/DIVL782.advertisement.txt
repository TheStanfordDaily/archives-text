OPEN YOUR MIND!
TRILOGY is awarding up to $10,000 to a Stanford undergraduate to apply towards the
start-up of his or her dream company. Our company began on the Stanford campus —
we know what it's like to have big ideas and we want to help you. Pick up
applications at the ASSU or at the TRILOGY table at the career fair October 14th.
Submit a developed business plan to the ASSU by January 13 and turn your ideas into
reality.
It's been known to happen...
Five years ago a group of ambitious Stanford undergrads set out to prove they could do
anything they set their minds to. By assembling a team of the most talented, creative, and
dedicated people they knew, they formed Trilogy. Together they developed a software
product that is "revolutionizing the way business is done" (Wall Street Journal), and
turned Trilogy into one of the fastest growing software companies in the country. We
think you can do the same. We'd like to promote creative minds — that's all. Questions?
Please contact Gabe Lucas at the ASSU. 725-1461.
Stop by the Career Fair this Friday!
Learn more about a future with Trilogy, one of Fortune's 25 Coolest Companies.
We're looking for people who will help us stay that way!
TRILOGY is looking for brilliant people, fuzzy or techie, with enough ambition and ener
gy to grow with us. You must demand high responsibilities and high rewards, seek
extreme personal advancement, and accomplish aggressive goals. If you feel the need to
make an impact, to set yourself apart from the rest, WE WANT TO TALK TO YOU. More
information in the CPPC.
