To Paint Her Life:
Charlotte Salomon in the Nazi Era
(HarperCollins, $27.50)
Charlotte Salomon produced a life
time's work in a few short, nightmarish
years. Born in Germany in 1917, she died
at Auschwitz at age 26, leaving behind
more than 700 autobiographical paint
ings. The great vibrancy and graphic
power of the paintings make a visual
equivalent to the diaries of Etty Hillesum and Anne Frank. To Plaint Her
Life is the gripping story of a young woman determined finally to paint
her life rather than take her life—only to
have it taken by the Nazis.
"Felstiner moves fluidly between biogra
phy, history (with a feminist angle), and
art criticism as she fleshes out the brief
life of Charlotte Salomon...an unusual
biography of an artist who herself painted
an unusual autobiography..."—Kirkus
(starred)
Mary Lowenthal Felstiner is a profes
sor of history at San Francisco State
University.
