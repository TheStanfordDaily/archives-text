FACES BEHIND THE
SHADOWS OF
HATE
AN ISRAELI'S JOURNEY INSIDE
«
.GERMANY'S NEO-NAZI MOVEMENT
YARON SVORAY,
an Israeli paratrooper, infiltrated the
Neo-Nazi underworld for eight
months. Using the cover "Ron
Furey," Svoray discovered (and
documented with hidden cameras
and microphones) that the Neo-
Nazis were not merely skinhead
thugs, but that their ranks include
lawyers, "respectable politicians,"
professors, police officers, and
military personnel. This eye witness
account is not an alarmist tract but
a powerful expose of the danger
posed by Germany's radical right.
Learn about extremist organizations in
Germany and throughout the world.
A call for all people of conscience to
hear his story and respond.
This presentation is free and open to all student, faculty, and
