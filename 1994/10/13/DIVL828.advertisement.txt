Welcome to Chef Chu's
Chef Chu's offers customers dishes adapted from authentic
Chinese recipes which appeal to both the Chinese and
American palate. The restaurant received the Epicurean
Rendezvous Award given for Best Chinese Restaurant in
Northern California. And recently, the readers of San
Francisco Focus Magazine awarded him the same honor.
For over twenty-four years Chef Chu's has used the
freshest ingredients to prepare exotic dishes. Friendly,
caring, efficient service has always been our tradition. Relax
and let your senses guide you. You be the judge.
