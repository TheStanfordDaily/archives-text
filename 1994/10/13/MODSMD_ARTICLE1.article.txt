## EV council meets on housing complaints 
### Jo Marshall Staff writer 
The Escondido Village Family
Council kicked off its first meeting
of the year last night with a heated
discussion about the continuing
problem of unsatisfactoiy housing
conditions in Escondido Village.
The two-hour meeting touched
on parking issues and bike theft,
but most of the evening was spent
addressing the endemic problem of
the lack of Escondido housing
maintenance.
"I'm still getting calls from peo
ple who still aren 't getting anything
done," said Amber McLain, an Es
condido resident who was recently
involved in a flier campaign encour
aging fellow residents to complain if
they moved into unclean and un
maintained apartments.
McLain was invited to the meet
ing to report on the progress of her
campaign. Six Escondido family
representatives, graduate senator
Juan Toboas and Council of Presi
dents member for graduate affairs
Mork Murdock also attended the
meeting.
"One resident reported that
they had been here three weeks be
fore [maintenance] came to fix a
leaking faucet," McLain said. She
also told the group that a graduate
resident assistant had informed her
that 50 percent of Escondido new
move-ins were not cleaned and in
spected because of a backlog.
The group reached a consensus
that the backlog should be handled
by contracting the work out — dur
ing the busy turnover period of Sep
tember — rather than employing
more "incompetent" Stanford
maintenance workers.
Family Council member Benson
Honig added that the same problem
doesn't exist for undergraduates
"because mom and dad see the kids
in their dorm and wouldn't pay for
them to live in a pigsty like we have
to."
The group spent more than an
hour telling various horror stories
of people moving into dilapidated
houses.
Family Council member Joe
Howarth suggested a protest out
side University President Gerhard
Casper's office to bring attention
to the problem. "I think it's time to
take some drastic action," he said.
Other ideas for enacting change
included going on a rent strike,
petitioning Vice Provost and Dean
for Student Affairs Mary Edmonds
and informing the local media.
However, the group decided to
start its campaign for better hous
ing by first holding a Town Hall
meeting Oct. 26 to discuss the issue
of inspection and maintenance of
housing. Members said they hope to
invite a number of administrators.
Murdock said the COP would
pay for photocopying fliers and
advertisements for the meeting.
"I want to help them get their
issues addressed by the adminis
tration. Clearly this is inappropri
ate for these conditions to exist,"
he said.
