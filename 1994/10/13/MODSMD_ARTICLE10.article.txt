Mexican officials implicated

MEXICO CITY (AP) - Con
gressmen and senators have
been implicated in the plot to
assassinate the No. 2 man in the
ruling party, the attorney gen
eral's office said yesterday,
sending a new earthquake
through Mexican politics.
The testimony by congres
sional aide Fernando Rodriguez
Gonzalez appears to confirm
fears that bloodshed has erupt
ed from resistence to reforms
within the Institutional Revolu
tionary Party, or PRI, which
has ruled Mexico for 65 years.
Rodriguez Gonzalez admit

ted that his boss, fugitive Con
gressman Manuel Munoz
Rocha, ordered the Sept. 28
murder of Jose Francisco Ruiz
Massieu "by orders of the
group" to which he belonged.
Rodriguez Gonzalez said fed
eral deputies, among them
Munoz Rocha, had a goal "to
recover the country's leadership
positions for those who have
been displaced, regardless of the
means they would have to use,"
according to a statement read on
national television by Mario Ruiz
Massieu, the deputy attorney
general and the victim's brother.

Immigration visas to be given to 6,000 Cubans

WASHINGTON (AP) - The
Clinton administration an
nounced plans yesterday to dis
tribute 5,000 to 6,000 immigra
tion visas to Cubans by a lottery,
giving a chance at resettlement
to Cubans who thus far have
been excluded.
Until now, visas have been
largely restricted to Cubans who
qualify for refugee status or
those with close relatives in the
United States who are American
citizens.
Details of how the lottery will
be run will be announced by
Nov. 1.
The State Department
announcement said Cubans

selected through the lottery will
be allowed to bring their spouses
and minor children with them to
the United States.
The announcement provided
details on the migration agree
ment the United States and
Cuba signed on Sept. 9. Under
that agreement, Cuba agreed to
curb the exodus of Cubans from
the island by boat while the
United States promised to grant
a minimum of 20,000 visas
annually.
The lottery is aimed partly at
Cubans who until now were
tempted to escape the island by
boat because normal emigration
channels were closed to them.

Russian finance minister fired

MOSCOW (AP) - Scram
bling to shore up Russia's eco
nomic recovery, President Boris
Yeltsin fired his finance minis
ter yesterday and asked law
makers to sack the Central
Bank chairman for letting the
ruble collapse.
The bank moved to prop up
the Russian currency after its
alarming 27 percent plunge on
"Black Tuesday."

The ruble regained 4.8 per
cent of its value after a nearly
$90 million bailout by the bank
on the Moscow interbank cur
rency exchange.
The slight recovery failed to
assuage either a worried public
or the government, fearful of
new political troubles that
could derail the economy, which
has shown signs of stabilization
in past months.
