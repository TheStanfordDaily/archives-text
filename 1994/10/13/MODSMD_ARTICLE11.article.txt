# Kidnapped Israeli soldier pleads on TV

JERUSALEM (AP) - A fright
ened Israeli soldier, only months
out of high school, told his mother
yesterday his captors would kill
him unless Israel released Pales
tinian prisoners.
In the televised appeal, a
masked gunman stood behind 19-
year-old Nachshon Waxman and
prompted him to ask for release of
the Palestinians.
"If not, they will kill me," said
Nachshon Waxman, who holds
dual American-Israeli citizenship.
The young soldier's abduction
by the militant Islamic group
Hamas shocked Israel and thrust
the Middle East peace process into
its deepest crisis yet.
Hamas, the leading opponent of
the Palestinian autonomy accord,
said it would kill Waxman unless
200 imprisoned Palestinians are
freed by Friday.
Waxman is the 10th Israeli to
have been kidnapped by Islamic
militants since 1989. All the previ
ous captives were killed.
Israeli leaders said they held
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
responsible for the soldier's safety,
and threatened to freeze talks on
expanding Palestinian self-rule if
Arafat did not act decisively to win
his release.
In a videotaped appeal yester
day, a dazed-looking Waxman
urged Rabin to comply with his
captors' demands. "I ask you to do
all you can so I get out of here
alive," Waxman said.
A militant holding an assault
rifle, a red-checkered headdress

covering his face, prompted Wax
man several times with questions
in Hebrew and placed a hand on
the soldier's shoulder at the end of
the tape.
"What do you have to say to your
mother?" the gunman asked.
"If my parents are watching me,
I am all right now, and I hope to
return to you if Rabin decides to
release the prisoners," Waxman
replied. The thin, dark-haired
teen-ager spoke in clipped military
terms and appeared to try to
steady his voice.
It was not known when or
where the tape, broadcast on
Israel's Channel Two, was filmed.
Waxman disappeared Sunday
night, and it is believed he was
abducted somewhere in central
Israel while hitchhiking.
In Jerusalem, his tearful mother
Esther, 47, who immigrated from
New York City 25 years ago, called
on the U.S. government "to save my
son who is an American citizen."
She also pleaded with the kid
nappers: "We have the same God
... and I hope they return him safe
and sound, for God's sake."
Secretary of State Warren
Christopher, who returned to
Jerusalem yesterday night after
stops in Syria and Jordan, said the
United States would do everything
possible to assist Israel.
Rabin, speaking to Arafat by
telephone yesterday, said Israel had
proof Waxman was being held in
the PLO-controlled Gaza Strip and
stressed Arafat's "absolute respon
sibility" for the soldier's safe return.
