# Iraq 'no drive' zone gets cool response

UNITED NATIONS (AP) -
The U.S. proposal for a "no-drive"
zone in southern Iraq yesterday
received a cool response from
France and Britain — allies whose
support would be vital.
Britain and France had joined
the United States in imposing "no
fly" zones in northern and south
ern Iraq after the Gulf War,

intended to protect restive Kurds
in the north and Shiites in the
south from Iraqi air attacks. The
three allies patrol the two zones.
But enthusiasm for yet another
zone to exclude tanks and other
heavy armor in southern Iraq
appeared to be lacking. The two
existing zones were imposed by the
allies without Security Council

approval because China had
threatened a veto.
China is believed to consider
such zones violations of sovereign
ty that could set unfortunate prece
dents and signal intervention by
big powers. If another zone were to
be established, it almost certainly
would be without U.N. blessing.
The five permanent Security

Council members — the United
States, Britain, China, France and
Russia — were meeting privately
yesterday to discuss the crisis and
whether other steps could be taken
to guarantee Kuwait's security
from Iraqi aggression.
The Clinton administration
itself began backing away from a
new "no-drive" zone.
