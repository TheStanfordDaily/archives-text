## Strengthen advising 
### 
Freshmen, sophomores
need advising system
with greater definition

WITH THE RELEASE of the
Report of the Commission
on Undergraduate Educa
tion, Stanford will once again turn
its attention to the needs of its
youngest 6,000 students. One of the
first and most important relation
ships an undergraduate enters is
with his or her freshman advisor. In
some cases, the two connect quickly
and the advisor becomes the stu
dent's mentor and friend. Unfortu
nately, in many other cases, the
advisor is a distant figure who
appears once or twice a quarter for
an advisor dinner but does not
become the accessible confidant con
fused first-year students often need.
The CUE report correctly identi
fies one basic problem with the cur
rent system — the need to clarify
the nature of the advisor-advisee
relationship. According to Under
graduate Advising Center Director
Hector Cuevas, approximately one
third of freshman advisors are facul
ty members, while staff members,
graduate students and other mem
bers of the Stanford community
make up the other two-thirds.
One need not be a professor to be
a good advisor, but potential under
graduate advisors should be subject
to some minimum requirement,
such as having at least three years of
experience with the Stanford under
graduate community, whether as a
student or a staff or faculty member.
Part of what clouds the defini
tion of the advisor are the con
stantly changing needs of advisees.
During freshman year, the advisor
acts as a consultant about every
thing from Cultures, Ideas and Val
ues requirements to graduate
school admissions to new friend
ships. Since freshmen have fairly
limited class choices and many
maintain broad academic pro

grams, many freshman advisors
can easily fulfill their many roles.
During sophomore year, howev
er, this relationship often breaks
down. As students branch out into
more specific areas of study, ones in
which their advisors are only some
times knowledgeable, the two tend
to lose touch. Too often, their only
contact occurs when the student
calls for his or her approval code,
briefly running through a study list
in exchange for four digits.
It is precisely at this point that
students need clear guidance.
Faced with decisions about majors,
graduate study and the close-loom
ing future, sophomores should be
encouraged to discover their own
academic interests while still bene
fiting from continued interaction
with their freshman advisors.
Advisors should be strictly held to
their responsibilities until the stu
dent declares a major; many times
this includes almost all of sopho
more year. While weak advisor
advisee relationships should not be
unnaturally continued over this
time, advisors should make it a point
to periodically check up on their stu
dents, even if it just means a month
ly phone call. The UAC could facili
tate this continued contact by creat
ing some kind of formal gathering of
sophomores and advisors — a sort of
sophomore advisor dinner.
The UAC should also establish
channels whereby advisors, AAs
and their advisees could all confi
dentially evaluate the advising rela
tionship. An ideal system would be
flexible enough to allow everything
from an advisor blowing the whis
tle on a delinquent AA to an advisee
offering constructive criticism to
his or her advisor.
The UAC must also make
greater efforts to inform students
of the wealth of advising resources
it offers in Sweet Hall. With more
accessible preprofessional advising
and better publicity efforts, stu
dents could come to think of the
UAC as a second stop down the
advising road, not as a last resort.
