Heart of education lies in scholarly inquiry, not in grades

IAM WRITING in response to Phillip
Pang's Oct. 11 letter supporting the
University's new grading policy. Or
perhaps I should clarify: I am writing
in anger and dismay, in an impassioned
attempt to defend everything I and my
education stand for, and everything I
feel I have been taught. This, clearly, is
a very tall order, and I hope that my
words are up to the task.
Much of what I believe about the
purpose of my education I learned
freshman year. When I came to Stan
ford as a freshman, I entered the pro
gram in Structured Liberal Education
very excited and very scared. On the
first day of SLE, it was explained to me
that we would not be receiving grades
for individual papers, nor would we at
any time during the quarter know what
our current grade (made up from a tra
ditional sample of papers, discussion,
and final exam) was. "What's the point
of taking a class if you don't have a
grade?" a fellow student asked — and
the question was an honest one, and a
valid one.
All my life I had had grades, and
now I would only have my writing
tutor, and my section leader, and
myself to judge how well I was doing.

For me, it was, at first as if a great bur
den was taken off my back. I went in to
my first SLE lecture confident, and
casual. I left terrified. There was much
to learn, I wasn't sure I could get it all
in; Mark Mancall, the lecturer and a
professor of history, had just bent my
mind in such a way I never thought it
would bend back again. The fear that
had consumed me about my grades in
high school and up to this point had
transformed itself into a fear of not
knowing — a fear that I would not
learn enough, or have time to learn
enough. I came to consider this fear
substantive, and real, and helpful, and
most of all, personal, unlike my previ
ous fear of grades, which came from
pure competition. It did not require me
to justify my failings and celebrate my
accomplishments for myself; the quest
for good marks asked me to learn what
I had to in order to be "better" than
others.
It is not my purpose in this educa
tion at Stanford University to do well
in relation to other students; it is my
purpose to achieve the best I can. I
woulu question anyone who would
attempt to compare me, an English
major and sometime actress, to Phillip

Pang, a biology major. In the overused
yet wise words of someone famous, yet
forgotten by me, these comparisons are
odious. And, I might add, useless.
Then, a further question arises, one
that Pang took it upon himself to
answer in his letter: are we, then, to
be compared by our "marketability,"
not our intellectual curiosity? Accord
ing to Pang, we are all "preprofession
als, not scholars." I refuse to present
an extended argument with this state
ment, because it is incorrect. I wonder
how he defines "preprofessional" — as
anyone who wants to have a job after
they graduate? This does not exclude
one from being a scholar — in the dic
tionary, "a learned or erudite person."
I consider myself a scholar, and I
behave as such. I love learning, and I
love learning more than the promise of
a well-paying job after graduation.
When I worry about my grades, I do it
because I worry about how well I
understand and think critically about
the material I study. I take classes
pass/no credit when I feel grades are
completely useless, in the arts and in
creative writing. When I graduate, I
will work to find a job in a field, or
with an organization, that values

intellectual curiosity more than the
competitive spirit Pang seems to
espouse.
I have said much, perhaps too much.
As a matter of fact, like Pang, I don't
believe there is any reason why any
person should get to retake a class at
all. Most of the grading reform sits
quite well with me — it is this attitude
behind it that makes me want to
scream. I wonder if Pang would ever
take a class that interested him, and
that he didn't think he would be good
at, like I have done. I wonder if the pay
check he, the "preprofessional," dreams
of when he's completed his finals every
quarter will satisfy him as much as the
endless excitement I am convinced I
will get as the reward for my "scholar's
life" here at Stanford. When I gradu
ate, I indeed intend to "shake my finger
at businesses, and tell them that they
should weigh an applicant's pursuit of
intellectual curiosity more heavily." I
wish Pang would consider doing the
same thing, instead of inflicting upon
the rest of us a "reality" that is not
only an easy choice but also a danger
ous one.
