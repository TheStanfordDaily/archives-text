## Chasing those Bat-fantasies 
### 
ATHLETICS 059 IS pummeling my
fantasy life. Listed as Gymnastics:
Beginners, it is turning my plans
to Play-Doh.
For years I had honestly believed I had
it in me — somewhere. Way down and
dormant I possessed the mental and phys
ical prowess for the job. Now I find I can't
even do a handspring on a flat surface.
My whole life I have wanted to be Bat
man. I don't mean like I used to want to
be a fireman. And I don't mean the pansy
assed Adam West KAPOWEE version.
More than any ol' adolescent fantasy
about cars or boobs or bonking my RA, I
want to be the Bat.
Graceful and twisted and majestic, the
Batman represents the Übermale who
uses His human brain, human body and
inherited means to make others believe
that He is, indeed, inhuman.
He exists in an animated, sinister world
of half-truth that needs Him. In forlorn
Gotham, Evil lurks in tangible, defeatable
form, granting an effect for His somewhat
questionable cause. This Evil can be
thwarted through physical performance,
so the better He is at being the ultimate
warrior the less others will suffer.
Instant validation of neuroses is a
rare treat.
It's in my blood already. When I see
someone ride by on a bike that looks like
the one(s) I had stolen I instinctively reach
for the Batarang on my belt. Rooftops
remind me of hiding places and I feel most
comfortable in a cape. All this is true.
Pre-adolescent resources for imple
mentation were limited, but I was deter
mined. A hand-me-down dirt bike
became a bad-ass Batmobile. Makeshift
swords and gadgets were fashioned for
battle and I had the best damn Ninja
phase of anyone I knew.
But formal training was to begin here at
Stanford, Mondays and Wednesdays at

1:15 — the Dark Knight never eats too big
a lunch. This would suffice until after
graduation when I could finally study mar
tial arts in Japan and criminology in Scot
land Yard. Begin with simple tumbling to
get my body ready for the true battle.
I showed up last Monday at the Ford
Center, pumped and ready — fired up in
those funky Calvin Klein undies 'neath
my Umbros. I even jogged there. A
stocky guy in tights called my name off a
list as I bounced across a Nerf room in
anticipation of my aerobic birthright.
The class began with stretching and I
learned, quite quickly, that I'm pretty
inflexible for someone who isn't fat. I
couldn't reach my toes. I could see them
all right, but like the view of Kimball
from Wilbur, it was all look and no touch.
Things got worse. Somersaults gave
me a headache. I fell on the headstands
and knocked others down. I believe I
looked like what my elementary school
gym teacher would call a "Wuss." Walk
ing home — slowly — I reassured myself
that the process would take time and
eventually I'd be buff enough to look
good in tights myself.
The next morning I was so sore I
couldn't move.
Now this was just physical disappoint
ment. As we all know, Bruce Wayne is
also a master chemist and so I consoled
myself thinking that at least I had the
brains part covered. Until I remembered
how I dropped Chem 31.
It was time to panic. A storeroom full
of fantasies, but only one for venting
heroic ideation. That damn class forced
me to recognize that these grandiose
plans of mine just might be pre-empted
by genetics.
When I took my shirt off and took a
good look at myself in a mirror, my pecs
actually started to giggle. When I asked
them what was so funny, they said (in a

southern accent, no less), "Face it
shorty. You's a 5'7" Jew-boy with a nose
that'd git busted up 'afore you git a glove
on that there Bat-A-Rangy."
So there it was. Twenty-one and it
finally strikes me that I am not Bruce
Wayne. I'm not even Alfred.
I can't do a cartwheel. I'm scared of
heights. My parents, thankfully, were
not killed in front of me — though I did
once see my Dad lose his keys.
And what would happen if I, careen
ing across the New York City rooftops in
the garb of the Dark One, kicked the crap
out of someone selling crack to 13 year
olds? I'd end up with a subpoena up my
Bat-butt and some other schmuck would
take over his street corner 20 minutes
after he stopped bleeding.
Sure I'm disheartened, but I refuse to
concede. I'm resigned to work with what
I've got. After all, it's not about being
perfect, it's about emulating whatever
god there might be by eliminating Evil
and replacing it with Good. Being a doc
tor is the closest thing I can think of, but
that means taking chemistry again.
I suppose I should have anticipated
disappointment all along, but one should
never have to face the destruction of a
fantasy without at least having another
one fulfilled the same day.
I still haven't had sex wearing a
Polarfleece condom in a hot air balloon . .
. there may be hope yet.
