# Love or hate? Assessing the Physics Tank
## 
### Crystal Carreon 
People around campus seem to either love
or hate the 15,992-square foot building infa
mously known as the Physics Tank.
As Stanford plans to demolish existing
buildings to make way for the new science and
engineering complex west of the Main Quad,
students and staff have expressed mixed emo
tions about its impending demise.
"It's the ugliest building I've ever seen on
campus. It's hideous," said junior David
Barba, a former physics major. Barba, now

an English major, is not alone in his disgust of
the "aesthetically unappealing" lecture hall.
As plans to build the new quad came into
focus Tuesday, it was announced that the
Physics Tank will be razed, along with
Sequoia Hall, the Applied Electronics Lab, the
Electrical Engineering Department offices
and the Electronics Research Lab. The new
quad's creation is due in large part to a $77.4
million grant from alumni David Packard and
William Hewlett.
"I knew that the Tank's days were num
bered," Physics Department Chair Douglas

Osheroff said.
Osheroff, who also served on the Futures
Committee — a group which worked on the
idea of a new quad — said the Physics Tank is
expendable and, although it has served its pur
pose well, there will be no tears over its loss.
A New Jersey transplant, Osheroff likens
the demise of the physics tank to his former
home. "I'd thought I'd miss the change of sea
sons, miss the snow. It was nostalgic . . . but I
haven't missed New Jersey," Osheroff said.
"New Jersey is to California as the Physics
Tank is to the new lecture hall."
To others, however, the Physics Tank is a
landmark of sorts. Junior Jan Leu, a Stanford
tour guide, lamented its upcoming loss.
"I like the Tank. On tours, it is always a
topic of interest. People are curious about it,"
she said. "The Tank is a relic of old, gaudy
1950s architecture — it stands out."
The building, erected in 1957, clashes with
the predominantly Spanish, mission architec
ture of the general campus. Putting the "aes
thetic" appearance aside, University Architect
David Neuman said that structurally, the
building is not situated well in relation to the
rest of the campus.
"It does not link with the Main Quad; it is
an impediment to circulation, the ability to
connect to various departments," he said.
According to Mario Vallejo, facilities man
ager of the west quad area, the buildings of the
1950s have served their function well, but
need to be updated. This is particularly true of
the Physics Tank, he added.
"We can see that it [the Tankl can still
operate, but basically it should be replaced,"
he said. "The building has already served its
life purpose. It's old."
Construction of the new quad is set to
begin at the end of fall quarter.

The Physics Tank — loved and hated by all — will be no more once construction on the new
Science Quad begins.
