# CUE report to be presented today
## Casper readies 64-page document 
### Beth Berselli Senior staff writer 
Almost a year and a half after
calling for a comprehensive
study of Stanford's undergradu
ate program, University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper will pre
sent the Commission on Under
graduate Education's findings
to the Faculty Senate today.
In its 64-page report, the
commission recommends devel
oping a new science course for
non-science majors, creating the
position of vice provost for un
dergraduate education, redefin
ing the Cultures, Ideas and Val
ues courses, and strengthening
Stanford's writing and language
requirements, as well as its ad
vising system.
Speaking to members of the
press yesterday, Casper empha
sized that the commission's re
port is only the beginning of a
process of reflection about un
dergraduate education's proper
role at Stanford.
Casper created the commis
sion in April 1993 to re-examine
virtually every facet of Stan
ford's undergraduate experi
ence — the first such undertak
ing at the University in nearly a
quarter of a century. Many of

the recommendations must re
ceive the approval of the Faculty
Senate before they can be imple
mented.
The commission — composed
of 14 faculty, two students, two
alumni and an administrator —
was charged to "articulate the
educational goals of Stanford's
undergraduate program."
"I think the commission has
made a wonderful beginning and
it understands in particular that
we must be engaged in continu
ous evaluation and renewal,"
