# CUE report to be presented today
## Casper readies 64-page document 
### Beth Berselli Senior staff writer 
Almost a year and a half after
calling for a comprehensive
study of Stanford's undergradu
ate program, University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper will pre
sent the Commission on Under
graduate Education's findings
to the Faculty Senate today.
In its 64-page report, the
commission recommends devel
oping a new science course for
non-science majors, creating the
position of vice provost for un
dergraduate education, redefin
ing the Cultures, Ideas and Val
ues courses, and strengthening
Stanford's writing and language
requirements, as well as its ad
vising system.
Speaking to members of the
press yesterday, Casper empha
sized that the commission's re
port is only the beginning of a
process of reflection about un
dergraduate education's proper
role at Stanford.
Casper created the commis
sion in April 1993 to re-examine
virtually every facet of Stan
ford's undergraduate experi
ence — the first such undertak
ing at the University in nearly a
quarter of a century. Many of

the recommendations must re
ceive the approval of the Faculty
Senate before they can be imple
mented.
The commission — composed
of 14 faculty, two students, two
alumni and an administrator —
was charged to "articulate the
educational goals of Stanford's
undergraduate program."
"I think the commission has
made a wonderful beginning and
it understands in particular that
we must be engaged in continu
ous evaluation and renewal,"


Henry Hsu — Daily
University President Gerhard Casper laid out the recommendations from the Commission on Under
graduate Education at a press conference in Bldg. 10 yesterday. With him was CUE chair James Shee
han, pictured at right, and Provost Condoleezza Rice.

Casper said.
Histoiy Prof. James Sheehan,
chair of the commission, agreed that
the report is "very much an evolu
tionary document."
Casper also stressed yesterday
that the report is aimed at the Stan
ford community and is not meant to
serve as a "blueprint for the world."
"In appointing the commission I
wanted to make sure that Stan
ford's undergraduate program is
characterized to the fullest extent
possible by rigor, responsibility and
coherence," Casper said. "As far as
I'm concerned this commission was
not appointed to fix a problem, but
to engage in quality control."
Ln formulating their recommen
dations, commission members tried
to gather a wide array of student
opinion, Sheehan said.
"Our recommendations are
based on what is happening out
there in classrooms and how stu
dents are reacting to it,"he said.
A look at DRs
The commission's report makes
a number of recommendations
regarding Stanford's distribution
requirements.
Most revolutionary is a proposal
to replace the current DRs in math
ematical sciences, natural sciences,
and technology and applied sciences
(Areas 4,5, and 6) with a new three
quarter sequence tentatively titled,
"Introduction to the Natural Sci
ences, Quantitative Analysis and
Technology."
Problem solving, experimental
work and computer literacy are

some subjects that would be consid
ered in the new course.
Casper said the course will
ensure that all students receive a
"serious exposure to math and sci
ence."
The earliest the course could be
implemented is fall quarter 1997,
but even then it would be not be
completely refined, said Mathemat
ics Prof. Brad Osgood, a member of
the Faculty Senate and the commis
sion.
The commission also recom
mends that the current DRs in the
humanities and social sciences core
(Areas 7, 8 and 9) be abandoned.
Instead, students would have to
take three courses in the humani
ties or social sciences outside their
m^jor.
The commission also proposes
that the University take steps to
restore a sense of common purpose
and curricular consistency to the
Cultures, Ideas and Values require
ment (Area 1).
When CIVs revision is finished
— which the report said should take
place by 1998 — the World and
American Cultures requirements
(Areas 2 and 3) will be abolished.
The commission also recom
mends that, starting next year, stu
dents be required to complete one
year of college language instruction
or pass a proficiency exam. Students
can fulfill the present requirement
with three years of high school
instruction.
In addition, the University's
writing requirement will be expand
ed so that all majors will require at
least one writing-intensive course.
These revisions to the DR system
should reduce the number of
breadth requirements by two, Shee
han said.

Other recommendations
Saying that advising "receives
uniformly low marks," the commis
sion said the University should
strengthen its system of peer advis
ing and encourage more faculty to
serve as advisers.
Provost Condoleezza Rice said
yesterday that she has formed a
small task force to study the advis
ing system further. "Advising is in
many ways the core of what we do,"
she said.
The commission also proposes
that advisers help interested stu
dents plan out a shortened degree
program, recognizing that some stu
dents prefer to graduate early.
Regarding the possibility of cre
ating a formal three-year option, the
group concluded that Stanford
should not "push students to gradu
ate early."
Other commission recommenda
tions include developing more effec
tive teaching evaluation methods,
establishing regular reviews of all
departments and creating a new
post of vice provost for undergradu
ate education.
It also suggests forming new task
forces to examine areas such as
technology in the classroom and the
grading system.
The administration has already
implemented two of the recommen
dations. Rice has named English
Prof. Ramon Saldivar as the new vice
provost for undergraduate education.
Saldivar — who is currently an
associate dean in the School of
Humanities and Sciences — will
remain in his current position, but
will assume extra duties as vice
provost in January, Rice said.
Casper also created a permanent
Commission on Technology in

The report of the Commis
sion on Undergraduate Educa
tion includes the following rec
ommendations:
First, the commission has
developed a number of specific
proposals to increase the rigor,
coherence, and clarity of the
undergraduate program:
• creation of a new core
requirement to teach science,
mathematics and technology to
non-scientists
• redefinition of the social
science and humanities breadth
requirement to enable students
to focus on coherent sets of
courses of their own choosing
• clarifying the purpose and
increasing the cohesion of the
Cultures, Ideas and Values
requirement by developing
courses that focus on the histor
ical evolution and comparative
analysis of cultural traditions
• extension of the writing
requirement to include at least
one writing-intensive course in
each student's mayor
• development of courses in
oral communication
• strengthening the foreign
language requirement to one
year of college instruction or the
passing of a proficiency exami-

Teaching and Learning last spring.
A timeline?
Work on all of the recommenda
tions will begin this year, said Vice
Provost for Institutional Planning
Geoffrey Cox.
Cox — a commission member

nation
• steps to enhance the role of
foreign languages in the under
graduate curriculum, including
the creation of a language center
• definition of criteria for an
effective major program and
establishment of University
wide reviews of all depart
ments
• introduction of an optional
minor to encourage students to
use their electives more effec
tively
• limitation on the number of
courses in which a student may
use the Credit-No credit option
and clarification of the meaning
of academic credit and credit
units
Second, the commission pro
poses a number of processes
that would lead to long-term
improvements in undergraduate
education:
• establishment of a task
force to encourage the effective
use of technology in teaching
and learning
• establishment of a group to
study the grading system and
ways it might be improved
• examination of ways the
academic calendar might be
used more flexibly, both by the

who is in charge of monitoring its
progress — said administrators are
currently trying to determine who
should be responsible for imple
menting each recommendation. A
timeline to carry out the group's
proposals will be completed this fall,
he added.

University and by individual
students
• clarification of the role of
general advisors, more effec
tive use of the Undergraduate
Advising Center, and expan
sion of opportunities for first
and second-year students to
work clpsely with faculty mem
bers
• improvements in the evalu
ation of teaching in all its forms,
including more effective means
of measuring student opinion
and the introduction of peer
evaluations
• introduction of ways to
assess all aspects of Stanford's
educational program, including
the effectiveness of writing and
language instruction, and the
regular review of University
requirements ,and major pro
grams
• more rigorous evaluation of
teaching and advising and more
prominent recognition of these
activities in faculty appoint
ments, promotions and compen
sation
• appointment of a vice
provost for undergraduate edu
cation to represent the needs
and interests of undergraduates
at the center of University gov
ernance

At today's Faculty Senate meet
ing, members will have the chance
to ask questions about the report,
Sheehan said.
Osgood said he anticipates that
the recommendations will probably
receive "strong support from the
senate."
