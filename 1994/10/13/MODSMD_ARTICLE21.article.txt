# New buildings may influence research cost over long-term
## Potential effect on indirect cost rate is a concern 
### Sarah Katz Editorial staff 
As Stanford rejoices over a
donation from William Hewlett
and David Packard which adds
$77.4 million to its coffers, some
on campus have noted that the
extra funding could in the long
run subtract from the Universi
ty's budget if the money drives up
Stanford's indirect-cost rate.
Indirect costs of research rep
resent the amount the University
is reimbursed by the federal gov
ernment for expenses, such as
utilities or building depreciation,
that cannot be attributed to any
specific research project.
"When you [build] a facility
that is dedicated to government
research, opportunity and capital
costs can in theory be recovered
through the indirect-cost rate,"
said Geoffrey Cox, the vice provost
for Institutional Planning.
The indirect-cost rate is the
number of cents per dollar of
sponsored direct research Stan
ford receives for overhead expens
es.
A new building, with higher
overhead costs, could drive up the

indirect-cost rate, which current
ly stands at 61 percent, Cox said,
meaning Stanford might bill the
government for more money.
Years ago, when the plan for a
"near west campus" renovation
was first under consideration,
Faculty Senate members were
alarmed that the renovations
might increase the already-high
rate, cutting into research funds.
"At the time, the faculty were
enormously concerned about the
high indirect-cost rate and what
it \as doing to our research
funding," said Biology Prof.
Robert Simoni, the Faculty Sen
ate chair.
"People saw the government
getting ticked off and were wor
ried they couldn't get grants to
support graduate students and
their own research," said Statis
tics Prof. Bradley Efron.
This time around, however,
Simoni and Cox said they don't
know what to expect. The indi
rect-cost rate is fairly low — due
in large part to past congressional
investigations of Stanford's
billing practices.
"The impact on campus was
going to be substantial back then,

and we don't know what the new
impact will be," said Physics
Dept. Chair Douglas Osheroff.
"But let me say that several of my
faculty have voiced a concern."
Raising concern further, the
government last year enacted
Federal Circular A-21, which
places fiscal caps on indirect-cost
rates for administrative and stu
dent services.
The new regulations mean
that if the rate cannot go up, the
University will be responsible for
paying the extra costs created by
the new buildings, Cox said. "We
have some leeway in it, but any
thing we choose not to charge the
government, we will have to pay,"
he added.
But Simoni said new buildings
are worth the extra cost. "It's a
matter of survival," he said. "You
can't do 21st-century research in
a 19th-century building."
Meanwhile, Cox said, the Uni
versity is studying "the cost of
operating this many facilities so
far in the future," running fore
casts and trying to decide how
much of the cost should be includ
ed in Stanford's bill to the gov
ernment.
