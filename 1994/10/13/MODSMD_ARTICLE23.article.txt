# New building will store campus toxic waste
## Science and engineering quad lab may help Stanford bounce back from hefty EPA fines

As Stanford struggles to make amends for
recent violations of state environmental law,
University administrators say the new sci
ence and engineering complex west of the
Quad will include a building for storing all
hazardous and toxic waste materials.
The building — called the Laboratory for
Advanced Materials — comes in the wake of a
settlement last month between Stanford and
the California Environmental Protection
Agency, which involved some 640 violations of
state law over a six-year period.
Stanford officials admitted to being guilty
of the violations and the University will pay a
$2.65 million settlement, in addition to agree
ing to many terms set down by the EPA.
According to University Architect David Neu-

The new buildings are an
opportunity to help create a
number of resources, improve
laboratories and basically
bring everything uplo date.'

man, the Laboratory for Advanced Materials —
as well as the rest of the new buildings — will be
built to comply with all of the new environmen
tal standards and with all toxic gas ordinances.
"The new buildings are an opportunity to
help create a number of resources, improve
laboratories and basically bring everything up

to date," said John Holmes, acting director of
the University's Environmental Health and
Safety department.
"The new Laboratory for Advanced Materi
als will allow most activities involving any
hazardous and toxic waste, which are now tak
ing place in the McCullough Building, to take
place there instead," Neuman said, adding
that this change will free up McCullough for
lectures and classes.
Buildings such as the Laboratory for
Advanced Materials are common at research
universities, said Allen Hirsch, a spokesman
for the Department of Toxic Substances.
Since Stanford must list all of its waste
accumulation areas as part of the settlement,
the laboratory will ease the burden on the
University by centralizing hazardous and
toxic wastes, he added.
