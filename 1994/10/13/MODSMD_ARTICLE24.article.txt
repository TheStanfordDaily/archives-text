Sprinkler floods Harvard dorm
A flood in one of Harvard University's
residential halls Friday night caused $80,000
in damages, estimated Cambridge police.
The Harvard Crimson reported that the
flood started when a freshman, who put a
clothes hanger on his ceiling sprinkler, tried
to take the hanger off the head, setting off
the building's sprinkler system.
Six rooms were flooded with up to two
inches of water. In addition, the student set
off several fire alarms and two residence
halls were completely evacuated, the Crim
son reported. Residents thought it was a fire
drill, and some complained that the fire
department took too long to arrive.
Though initially slated to find lodging in
the Sheraton Commander Hotel, the stu
dents were told later that night to sleep in
their waterlogged rooms.
Demonstration disturbs BYU campus
An Oregon preacher disrupted Brigham
Young University's Mormon campus and
shouted accusations at students, reported
the Daily Universe. His anti-Mormon, anti
organized religion demonstration lasted for
about 25 minutes.
The man and his group handed out pam
phlets while holding banners and a wooden
cross. According to the Daily Universe, the
man shouted to the students, "You guys

don't know Jesus Christ. You are Mormon
scumbags," and declared that students were
going to hell. The disturbance ended when
the man was handcuffed, taken away and
fined $100.
Princeton considers stadium overhaul
The University is considering major
repairs to its stadium, including the possibil
ity of demolishing it, reported the Daily
Princetonian. An engineering study done
during the summer revealed extensive struc
tural problems.
One option being considered is the
replacement of the most damaged sections,
leaving the larger structure intact. The uni
versity is trying to avoid interrupting the
football and track seasons, though the teams
may be displaced briefly.
Room quarantine at Columbia
The effects of a radioactive waste spill at
Columbia University last May linger on,
according to the Columbia Spectator. An
accidental spill contaminated a radioactive
waste storage room in the Morningside
Heights campus, and the clean-up will not be
completed until mid-October.
The room remains quarantined, and the
university is revising its rules for handling
radioactive waste. David Brenner, the chair
of the university's Radiation Safety Commit

tee, told the Spectator, "what happened was
a case of human error. It was a 4:30 on a Fri
day afternoon and all of the procedures that
could have been followed were not."
Atlantic Monthly blasts UCSD professor
Peter Irons, a University of California at
San Diego professor of political science, was
blasted by The Atlantic Monthly for his work
on a collection of audiotapes containing oral
arguments from famous Supreme Court
cases, The UCSD Guardian reported.
The Monthly accused Irons of "astonish
ing carelessness with constitutional law,"
and of fictionalizing the cases presented.
Irons called the article a "personal violent
attack," and is demanding an opportunity to
defend himself in the pages of the magazine.
The controversy began last year with the
threats of a lawsuit from the Supreme Court.
Michigan may cut Comm Department
The University of Michigan is considering
an overhaul or complete elimination of its
Department of Communication. According
to the Michigan Daily, the troubled depart
ment is changing course offerings and degree
requirements. The changes will mostly affect
freshmen and sophomores. Department fac
ulty are being told to use caution in advising
lower division students.
