# Humanities Center looks for new director
## 
### Brian Singer 
The Stanford Humanities Cen
ter is soliciting nominations to
replace its current director, Art
Prof. Wanda Corn, who will step
down in June after completing her
three-year term.
Corn will forgo the traditional
second term to participate in a
grant recently awarded to the Art
Department to enlarge and build
Stanford's program in American
Art and Material Culture.
"I hate to leave the center, but
I've also got new challenges ahead,"
Corn said, adding that she was
excited about returning to under
graduate teaching.
"She was terrific. She brought
new perspective to the center," said
George Dekker, professor of
English and associate dean of grad
uate policy, who is chairing the
search committee.
Both Corn and Dekker empha
sized the center's ability not to con
fine itself to one particular track.
"The center is healthiest when it
broadly serves all the humanities at
Stanford, and I hope I've done so
[as director]," Corn said.

Housed near the Law School,
the Stanford Humanities Center,
established in 1980, allows faculty
and graduate fellows to pursue
research projects and interact,
Dekker said.
Approximately 15 faculty mem
bers from Stanford and other insti
tutions are selected to work with
the center, along with 10 graduate
students and one dissertation fel
low.
Dekker leads the search com
mittee, comprised of six other facul
ty members. He said the committee
will narrow the search from 15 to
five before submitting the list to
Charles Kruger, dean of research
and graduate policy, who will make
the final selection.
"We're looking for someone
with quite eclectic interests â€” a
good people person," Dekker said.
Nominees must be current Stan
ford faculty members,.
Although the committee tries to
vary directorship among the differ
ent humanities departments,
Dekker said that realistically, this
is not always the case. "In the end,
we choose the person rather than
the discipline," he said.
