## FOOTBALL MID-SEASON REPORT Lack of running game keeps hopes, ball in air 
### Greg Collins Staff writer 
Imagine the fastest, most tech
nologically advanced fighter jet in
the world, capable of striking
quickly and quietly without its
opponent even aware of what is
happening. That was the image of
Stanford's offense for the first
two games of 1994.
Now imagine the same jet sud
denly without its landing gear and
high-tech It can still fly
just as fast, but now is unable to
attack with the same proficiency
and essentially is stuck in the air.
That is what the Cardinal
offense has turned into over the
past three weeks, as it has seen its
running game dwindle into near
oblivion. And while the passing
game has had little trouble mov
ing the ball, the lack of a running

game has forced Stanford to
throw much too often and kept it
from controlling possession of the
ball.
Offensive coordinator Terry
Shea, in his third year with the
Cardinal, has noticed these short
comings amid a remarkable sea
son for senior quarterback Steve
Stenstrom. Even as the top
offense in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence, Stanford has only one win to
show for its offensive pyrotech
nics.
"I feel like we've come out and
been able to move the ball when
we wanted to do it or when we
needed to do it," Shea said. "I
don't feel like we've produced as
much as we can inside the 25-yard
line. We just have not added up
the touchdowns, and that's prob
ably the one factor that's holding
us back from being maybe a top

scoring team."
First the good news — Shea is
correct in his view of the execu
tion of the offense. Along with
averaging 439.8 yards per game,
the Cardinal is tops in the confer
ence in first downs, averaging 23
a game. It is second in third-down
conversions, turning a remark
able 48.6 percent of its third
downs into firsts.
Even Stanford's scoring aver
age of 30.4 per game seems to run
counter to Shea's idea that the
Cardinal isn't one of the top scor
ing threats in the country. How
ever, when contrasted with the
number of chances Stanford has
had to score inside the 20-yard
line, it appears that the execution
tends to decrease in the "red
zone."
The Cardinal has journeyed
inside the 20-yard line 21 times in
five games, scoring 15 touch
downs and one field goal. Howev
er, junior place-kicker Eric
Abrams has missed three kicks
from inside the 20. This inability
to rely on the "automatic" field
goal has forced the offense into a
greater sense of urgency to score a
touchdown.
Aside from pure efficiency
numbers, Stanford also seems to
lack the big plays capable of blow
ing a game wide open. Aside from
one special teams touchdown
(Damon Dunn's 100-yard kickoff
return against Arizona State),
only five Cardinal touchdowns
have come on plays originating
outside the 20-yard line.
Shea has several hopes to recti
fy this situation. He believes that
it will take "a running back to
break a big run or a receiver to
break a tackle and make a big play
— take the ball 60-some yards.
Until that happens, we're at the
mercy of our execution."
Citing three long passes that
have slipped through sophomore
receiver Brian Manning's finger
tips as one of the types of plays
the offense needs to explode onto
the scoreboard, Shea is also look
ing for a great individual effort
after the catch.
"I'd like to see somebody make
that catch or run and take a few
hits or make a few touchdown
type moves and score on a play
that nobody thought you would
score on," he said. "When [the
players] see one of their team

mates have that passion to score
with a great play, I think that
jacks everybody up."
As for the running game, Shea
commented how the only con
stant in what looked to be a very
promising year has been the play
of the offensive line and the fact
that the same five players have
started each game. Although the
line has given up 20 sacks
through five games, Shea thought
that this was not a bad number,
considering the Cardinal throws
almost 40 times a game. On a
sacks-per-attempt basis, Stanford
gives up one sack every 9.8
attempts, compared to the Pac-10
average of one sack every 9.1
attempts.
For Stenstrom, it has been a
year of fulfilled expectations,
albeit sooner than he expected.
Although he did break the Pac-10
record for career passing yardage
last week, he was hoping that an
established running game would
keep him accumulating the huge
numbers he currently has until
the sixth or seventh game.
Through five games, Stenstrom
is 130-for-194 for 1573 yards and
eight touchdowns with only two

interceptions. Currently, Sten
strom ranks third nationally in
total offense per game and is
ranked 13th nationally in passing
efficiency. After starting the 1994
season with a wealth of quality
quarterbacks in the Pac-10, Sten
strom has clearly risen to the top
with his consistency and durability.

'We're good enough
to be able run the
ball with more
success than what
we've been able
to do.'
— Terry Shea

As polished and powerful as
the passing game looks, the run
ning game has taken on the char
acteristics of your aunt's mystery
casserole — every time you try it,
you think it might turn out okay.
But invariably you push it aside
and go back to the consistency of
Mom's fried chicken.

In Stanford's case, the running
game has left a bad taste the col-Til
lective mouths of the Cardinal"'
over the past three games. Fight
ing through injuries to starters
Greg Cornelia and Mike Mitchell,
and backups Adam Salina and
Anthony Bookman, Stanford now
appears to have everyone except
Cornelia back either at or near
100 percent.
However, Shea doesn't entirely
pass the Cardinal's dismal rush
ing efforts of the past three games
on to injury. Against Arizona,
Notre Dame and Arizona State,
Stanford ran for a total of 116
yards — a far cry from the 489 it
totaled after the first two games.
"We're good enough to be able
run the ball with more success
than what we've been able to do,"
Shea said. "I've always main
tained that you need to have a
running back step into your hud
dle and give that huddle some
electricity, and we were starting
to reach that style with Mitchell."
Heading into the second half of
the season with a backfield almost
completely healthy, Shea will look

for that electricity to return to the
offense. By more effectively mix
ing up the run and pass, the
offense will be able to use its flex
ibility as a weapon, rather than
being forced into passing 40 or 50
times a game.
When this offense has time to
set up its diversified attack (30-40
percent more complex than most
colleges, according to Shea), it
becomes nearly unstoppable, as
shown against San Jose State.
Although the competition may

not have been at a Pac-10 level,
the success of the running game
made each play-action pass and
misdirection play that more effec
tive.
However, until the running
game is rediscovered, expect
Stanford to pile up huge passing
numbers but remain unable to
control the offensive flow of a
game, making for a long and frus
trating season which had started
with such promise.

offense. By more effectively mix
ing up the run and pass, the
offense will be able to use its flex
ibility as a weapon, rather than
being forced into passing 40 or 50
times a game.
When this offense has time to
set up its diversified attack (30-40
percent more complex than most
colleges, according to Shea), it
becomes nearly unstoppable, as
shown against San Jose State.
Although the competition may

not have been at a Pac-10 level,
the success of the running game
made each play-action pass and
misdirection play that more effec
tive.
However, until the running
game is rediscovered, expect
Stanford to pile up huge passing
numbers but remain unable to
control the offensive flow of a
game, making for a long and frus
trating season which had started
with such promise.

Next week: An interview with
defensive coordinator Fred von-
Appen reveals insights to Stan
ford's deceptively improved
defense.
Imagine the fastest, most tech
nologically advanced fighter jet in
the world, capable of striking
quickly and quietly without its
opponent even aware of what is
happening. That was the image of
Stanford's offense for the first
two games of 1994.
Now imagine the same jet sud
denly without its landing gear and
high-tech It can still fly
just as fast, but now is unable to
attack with the same proficiency
and essentially is stuck in the air.
That is what the Cardinal
offense has turned into over the
past three weeks, as it has seen its
running game dwindle into near
oblivion. And while the passing
game has had little trouble mov
ing the ball, the lack of a running

game has forced Stanford to
throw much too often and kept it
from controlling possession of the
ball.
Offensive coordinator Terry
Shea, in his third year with the
Cardinal, has noticed these short
comings amid a remarkable sea
son for senior quarterback Steve
Stenstrom. Even as the top
offense in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence, Stanford has only one win to
show for its offensive pyrotech
nics.
"I feel like we've come out and
been able to move the ball when
we wanted to do it or when we
needed to do it," Shea said. "I
don't feel like we've produced as
much as we can inside the 25-yard
line. We just have not added up
the touchdowns, and that's prob
ably the one factor that's holding
us back from being maybe a top

scoring team."
First the good news — Shea is
correct in his view of the execu
tion of the offense. Along with
averaging 439.8 yards per game,
the Cardinal is tops in the confer
ence in first downs, averaging 23
a game. It is second in third-down
conversions, turning a remark
able 48.6 percent of its third
downs into firsts.
Even Stanford's scoring aver
age of 30.4 per game seems to run
counter to Shea's idea that the
Cardinal isn't one of the top scor
ing threats in the country. How
ever, when contrasted with the
number of chances Stanford has
had to score inside the 20-yard
line, it appears that the execution
tends to decrease in the "red
zone."
The Cardinal has journeyed
inside the 20-yard line 21 times in
five games, scoring 15 touch
downs and one field goal. Howev
er, junior place-kicker Eric
Abrams has missed three kicks
from inside the 20. This inability
to rely on the "automatic" field
goal has forced the offense into a
greater sense of urgency to score a
touchdown.
Aside from pure efficiency
numbers, Stanford also seems to
lack the big plays capable of blow
ing a game wide open. Aside from
one special teams touchdown
(Damon Dunn's 100-yard kickoff
return against Arizona State),
only five Cardinal touchdowns
have come on plays originating
outside the 20-yard line.
Shea has several hopes to recti
fy this situation. He believes that
it will take "a running back to
break a big run or a receiver to
break a tackle and make a big play
— take the ball 60-some yards.
Until that happens, we're at the
mercy of our execution."
Citing three long passes that
have slipped through sophomore
receiver Brian Manning's finger
tips as one of the types of plays
the offense needs to explode onto
the scoreboard, Shea is also look
ing for a great individual effort
after the catch.
"I'd like to see somebody make
that catch or run and take a few
hits or make a few touchdown
type moves and score on a play
that nobody thought you would
score on," he said. "When [the
players] see one of their team

mates have that passion to score
with a great play, I think that
jacks everybody up."
As for the running game, Shea
commented how the only con
stant in what looked to be a very
promising year has been the play
of the offensive line and the fact
that the same five players have
started each game. Although the
line has given up 20 sacks
through five games, Shea thought
that this was not a bad number,
considering the Cardinal throws
almost 40 times a game. On a
sacks-per-attempt basis, Stanford
gives up one sack every 9.8
attempts, compared to the Pac-10
average of one sack every 9.1
attempts.
For Stenstrom, it has been a
year of fulfilled expectations,
albeit sooner than he expected.
Although he did break the Pac-10
record for career passing yardage
last week, he was hoping that an
established running game would
keep him accumulating the huge
numbers he currently has until
the sixth or seventh game.
Through five games, Stenstrom
is 130-for-194 for 1573 yards and
eight touchdowns with only two

interceptions. Currently, Sten
strom ranks third nationally in
total offense per game and is
ranked 13th nationally in passing
efficiency. After starting the 1994
season with a wealth of quality
quarterbacks in the Pac-10, Sten
strom has clearly risen to the top
with his consistency and durability.

'We're good enough
to be able run the
ball with more
success than what
we've been able
to do.'
— Terry Shea

As polished and powerful as
the passing game looks, the run
ning game has taken on the char
acteristics of your aunt's mystery
casserole — every time you try it,
you think it might turn out okay.
But invariably you push it aside
and go back to the consistency of
Mom's fried chicken.

In Stanford's case, the running
game has left a bad taste the col-Til
lective mouths of the Cardinal"'
over the past three games. Fight
ing through injuries to starters
Greg Cornelia and Mike Mitchell,
and backups Adam Salina and
Anthony Bookman, Stanford now
appears to have everyone except
Cornelia back either at or near
100 percent.
However, Shea doesn't entirely
pass the Cardinal's dismal rush
ing efforts of the past three games
on to injury. Against Arizona,
Notre Dame and Arizona State,
Stanford ran for a total of 116
yards — a far cry from the 489 it
totaled after the first two games.
"We're good enough to be able
run the ball with more success
than what we've been able to do,"
Shea said. "I've always main
tained that you need to have a
running back step into your hud
dle and give that huddle some
electricity, and we were starting
to reach that style with Mitchell."

the season with a backfield almost
completely healthy, Shea will look
