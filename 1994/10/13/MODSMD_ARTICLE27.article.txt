# Trojans once again
## Polo to face No. 2 USC in third battle 
### Kyle Utsumi Staff writer 
While college football and basketball
may go all season without getting their
dream No. 1 vs. No. 2 match-ups, colle
giate water polo is treated to such games
just about every other week.
When USC comes into town this Sat
urday to meet Stanford, it will mark the
third time this season that the No. 1 and
No. 2 teams have come to battle. So far,
the top-rated Cardinal (13-1) has kept the
Trojans (9-3) at bay, winning both the
Southern California and Northern Cali
fornia championship games against USC.
The Trojans played bridesmaid to
Stanford last season as well, losing to the
Cardinal in the NCAA championship
match at Belmont Plaza Olympic Pool in
Long Beach, Calif.
When the teams clash in the water
this weekend, Stanford coach Dante Det
tamanti expects the toughest game thus
far for his squad.
"They usually come up here and give
us a good game," Dettamanti said. "The
only advantage we will have is that they
play against Cal on Friday."

Another advantage the Cardinal will
enjoy is a full starting lineup against the
Trojans. In each of its previous victories
over USC, Stanford was missing an Ail-
American â€” junior Jeremy Laster was
absent from the 15-11 win at the South
ern Cal Tourney, while senior co-captain
Wolf Wigo was missing from Stanford's 8-
7 triumph at the Nor Cal Tourney.
"I'm pleased we will have a full team
this time when we play them," Detta
manti said. "We can't afford to miss a
key guy against USC."
One player who has been especially
effective for the Cardinal lately has been
senior co-captain Frank Schneider. In
the Nor Cal final, Schneider tallied the
winning goal to down the Trojans. He
followed that game by scoring a career
high four goals against No. 4 UCLA last
week.
"We need to get fired up and put
[USC] away," said Schneider. "We want
to reinforce our dominance over them."
While Schneider was nearly unstop
pable at the center-forward position
against the Bruins, he expects a greater
