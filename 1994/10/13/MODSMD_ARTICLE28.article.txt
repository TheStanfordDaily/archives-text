"Hail to the victors valiant! Hail to the conquer
ing heroes! Hail to the Cardinal, the leaders of the
west!"
The Stanford cross country teams looks to
rewrite the Michigan fight song this weekend as
they travel to Ann Arbor for the Michigan Invita
tional.
The women's squad, coming off a first-place fin
ish at the Stanford Invitational two weeks ago, looks
to continue solidifying itself as a powerhouse of the
sport. The team began the season by upsetting No.
1-ranked Arkansas at the UC-Irvine Invitational
last month. The Cardinal is currently ranked third
in the country, although it has not run outside the
state of California.
"This will be a good opportunity for us to get
exposed to others outside our league," said head
coach Vin Lananna.
While some may believe that the cold weather in
Ann Arbor could adversely affect the team, fresh
man sensation Kortney Dunscombe thinks differ
ently.
"I'm not sure how the weather will affect each
individual, but I think we're strong enough to over
come it," she said.
Lananna also believes that the weather, although
a challenge, will not be a significant factor.

disadvantage to Stanford," he
said. "It'll affect all teams the
same way."
Besides providing the squad
with a test of resiliency, this
weekend could give an indication
of how the Cardinal has pro
gressed since its last competition.
"I think we're becoming more
of a team. We've grown a lot and
learned a lot since the beginning
of the season," Dunscombe said.
This weekend will show exact
ly how much the runners have
come together, as they face some
of the toughest competition of the
year. The meet will feature 11 of
the top teams in the country,
namely Michigan and Notre
Dame. Lananna anticipates that
the race will be especially close
between Stanford and Michigan.
"Michigan is a very, very
strong team. It will definitely be a
competitive battle between the
two of us," Lananna said.
Although the race will be
tough, the team is fired up.
"We're getting into the meets
that really count. We're going
there to win," said freshman
Sarna Renfro, who has led the
way for the Cardinal women this
season.
The men's team is also riding
high after a second-place finish at
the Stanford Invitational. Cur

rently ranked No. 17, the men
surprised many by defeating sev
eral top-rate teams at that event,
including BYU and UCLA. Previ
ously, the men placed second to
Northern Arizona at the Irvine
Invite.
"The men's team has really
come around, and I'm expecting
great things from them [this
weekend]," Lananna said.
The Cardinal's performance
two weeks ago haa significantly
lifted the team morale.
"We've become a much
stronger pack. We have much
more confidence, and all [team
members] are showing a lot more
strength and perseverance," said
sophomore J.J. White.
Like the women, the men will
also face eleven of the nation's
strongest running teams, includ
ing top-ranked Tennessee, Notre
Dame and Arizona.
"If we walk away from Michi
gan with a strong finish, it would
carry over to future meets and
build our confidence even more,"
White said.
This contest marks the middle
of the season for both the
women's and men's teams, which
also signals a slight change in
focus.
"[Michigan] is a means to an
end. We are still putting some
touches on the team," Lananna
said. "Now we're focusing on the
end of the season, like we did last
year, and this is just a step along
the way."
