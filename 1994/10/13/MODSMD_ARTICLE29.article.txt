# Sailors to Navy Fall Invite
## 
### Daniel Kao 
It's showtime.
This weekend, the Stanford
sailing team will travel to the site
of the Navy Fall Invitational,
Annapolis, Md., in hopes of prov
ing to the collective world of colle
giate sailing that the West Coast
can be as tough as anywhere.
There's no better arena, either.
The United States Naval Acade
my has long been a name synony
mous with legendary visions of
aquatic prowess and maritime tri
umphs. And, unlike many of the
weaker Pacific Coast regattas, the
competition, provided by many of
the eastern schools, will be strong
and plenty.
Kight of the top 10 co-ed teams
in the nation are from the East
Coast, including No. 1-ranked
Navy. The Cardinal co-ed team is
currently ranked ninth. The
greater the challenge, however,
the greater the glory.
"This regatta is really big for
us because we get to go against
the top competition in the East

Coast," said sophomore crew
Letitia Yang. "Those are the same
teams we'll face again at the
Nationals, teams like top-ranked
Navy, second-ranked Tufts, and
third-ranked Charleston. To
experience this level of competi
tion is extremely important.
We're all looking forward to it."
The regatta is structured to
have four divisions. Divisions A
and B will feature the use of both
the two-person 420's and Flying
Juniors. Divisions C and D, how
ever, will be raced with the single
person Laser boats.
"With four divisions, all the
teams have to be deep," said coach
Steve Bourdow. "You can't win
with just one or two good skippers."
Stanford possesses the kind of
depth needed to succeed, but the
question mark lies on the team's
youth. Bourdow has tentatively
scheduled to start two of the talent
ed young freshman skippers, John
Meade and Danny Zimbaldi. Meade
will be sailing alone in the Division
D while Zimbaldi will be paired up
with junior crew Sibyl Diver.

"The two freshmen are sailing
their first really major event,"
Bourdow said. "But they've
shown that they are definitely
players. They're close to the top
as far as talent already."
The rest of the lineup will have
senior skipper Charles Meade and
Yang competing in Division A,
and junior skipper Adam Lowry
racing in Division C.
"With the four divisions, it's
hard to predict how well we'll do,"
Meade said. "This is the biggest
regatta of the fall and the compe
tition will be tough."
Bourdow hopes for a top-five
finish which would definitely
catch the attention of the rest of
the sailing world.
"Navy always puts on a really
good event with ideal conditions.
There are no excuses for some of
the less-than spectacular races
we've had there," Bourdow said.
"After finishing about ninth last
year, a finish in the top five would
be great. It would show that our
team is just as tough as the top
teams on the East Coast."
