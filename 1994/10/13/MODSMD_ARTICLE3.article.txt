# University considers logistics of new Science Quad

As plans to raze, renovate and rebuild
the area west of the Main Quad are set into
motion, members of the Stanford commu
nity are beginning to discuss the logistics of
one of the most complex construction pro
jects in the school's history.
In the upcomingyears, five buildings will
be torn down to clear the way for the re
modeling project made possible by a recent
$77.4 million donation from Stanford alum-

ni David Packard and William Hewlett.
Replacing the aging buildings will be a
$110 million science and engineering quad
consisting of four new structures. The pro
ject will begin in 1995 and be completed by
1999.
For now, though, professors and campus

planning officials are concerned with the
transition period, during which the Univer
sity will need to provide adequate lecture
and office space for those who are displaced
by the construction.
Considering the intense activity of cur
rent construction and the limited availabil
ity of space, this will be no simple feat.
"We understand the importance of main
taining continuity in an area that will be
under construction for a number of years,"
said Assoc. Provost of Facilities Planning

Jacqueline Wender.
"Because that is very complicated and
difficult, we are working carefully to devel
op a detailed sequencing plan," she said.
Wender added that it was still too early to
provide specifics on the construction plans.
The work will be completed in separate
phases, said Facilities Project Manager
Mark Jones. "We plan to carefully choreo
graph the work in a series of sequenced con
struction packages," he said.
