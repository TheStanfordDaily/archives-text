# University considers logistics of new Science Quad
## 
### Amy Slucter 
As plans to raze, renovate and rebuild
the area west of the Main Quad are set into
motion, members of the Stanford commu
nity are beginning to discuss the logistics of
one of the most complex construction pro
jects in the school's history.
In the upcomingyears, five buildings will
be torn down to clear the way for the re
modeling project made possible by a recent
$77.4 million donation from Stanford alum-

ni David Packard and William Hewlett.
Replacing the aging buildings will be a
$110 million science and engineering quad
consisting of four new structures. The pro
ject will begin in 1995 and be completed by
1999.
For now, though, professors and campus

planning officials are concerned with the
transition period, during which the Univer
sity will need to provide adequate lecture
and office space for those who are displaced
by the construction.
Considering the intense activity of cur
rent construction and the limited availabil
ity of space, this will be no simple feat.
"We understand the importance of main
taining continuity in an area that will be
under construction for a number of years,"
said Assoc. Provost of Facilities Planning

Jacqueline Wender.
"Because that is very complicated and
difficult, we are working carefully to devel
op a detailed sequencing plan," she said.
Wender added that it was still too early to
provide specifics on the construction plans.
The work will be completed in separate
phases, said Facilities Project Manager
Mark Jones. "We plan to carefully choreo
graph the work in a series of sequenced con
struction packages," he said.
Along with the four new build
ings, new utilities will be installed
and a road to service the buildings
will be constructed.
"We are going to move ahead as
rapidly as we can," said David Glen,
director of the Office of Develop
ment. "Obviously it takes time, but
now we are going to get down to the
specifics."
Programs that now operate in
the existing structures will be relo
cated by following a "musical
chairs" approach to remodeling,
Jones said. For example, the
Physics Tank will not be destroyed

until the new Regional Teaching
Facility, which will replace it, is
built.
The Facilities Project Manage
ment Office plans to hire an outside
construction management firm to
help them create a step-by-step
approach to handling the logistics of
the transition. Details of the project
will then be reviewed by those aca
demic departments affected by the
remodeling.
"We are experienced as a campus
at maintaining active construction
sites while maintaining active teach
ing and research programs," Jones
said. "We will continue to follow the
safety programs that are standard."

Current construction on the east
side of the Quad will continue until
1999 as part of a seismic strength
ening effort. Work on the Gates
Computer Science Building and the
Center for Integrated Systems (CIS)
building — both essential parts of
the new science and engineering
quad, Jones said — also should be
completed by the end of 1995.
"We lived through Gilbert (Bio
logical Sciences Building), now we're
living through Gates and CIS," said
Physics Department Chair Douglas
Osheroff. "That's the price you pay
for nice new buildings."
Although Osheroff said he is not
concerned about the University's

ability to sustain operations, he
added he is worried that parking
may be both inconvenient and a
safety hazard during the transition.
The Varian parking lot usually
utilized by faculty and students will
be unusable because of surrounding
construction, possibly forcing
motorists to park far away.
Osheroff pointed out that a long
walk would discourage him from
carrying heavy physics equipment
for demonstrations, and could also
be a threat to female students
whose classes finished at night.
However, Glen did not think that
parking was a major concern.
"When we remove parking spaces,

there are provisions for parking
replacement that will include costs
... they will probably be costs that
the University takes care of."
Detailed architectural and logis
tical preparations are more pressing
matters, Jones said.
"The Near West Campus project
is a massive construction job that
must be accomplished without dis
rupting teaching and research," he
said. "That is task number one."
Field construction on the first of
the new buildings will begin toward
the end of 1995. Work on the new
utilities will precede this in mid- to
late 1995 and current buildings will
not be demolished until 1996 or later.

Despite the grand plans for
reconstruction, there are a few pro
fessors who have expressed a fond
ness for the older buildings.
"Sequoia Hall is a wonderful
building, nearly 100 years old," said
Statistics Prof. Bradley Efron,
whose office is located there. "It's
nicely designed so that faculty and
students get to mix a lot. I hope our
new building will include its best
features."
But others disagreed with
Efron's assessment of the current
building. "Sequoia Hall is an
ancient building," said Statistics
Prof. Abraham Wyner. "If there is a
new building, it can only be better."

transition period, during which the Univer
sity will need to provide adequate lecture
and office space for those who are displaced
by the construction.
Considering the intense activity of cur
rent construction and the limited availabil
ity of space, this will be no simple feat.
"We understand the importance of main
taining continuity in an area that will be
under construction for a number of years,"
said Assoc. Provost of Facilities Planning

Jacqueline Wender.
"Because that is very complicated and
difficult, we are working carefully to devel
op a detailed sequencing plan," she said.
Wender added that it was still too early to
provide specifics on the construction plans.
The work will be completed in separate
phases, said Facilities Project Manager
Mark Jones. "We plan to carefully choreo
graph the work in a series of sequenced con
struction packages," he said.
Along with the four new build
ings, new utilities will be installed
and a road to service the buildings
will be constructed.
"We are going to move ahead as
rapidly as we can," said David Glen,
director of the Office of Develop
ment. "Obviously it takes time, but
now we are going to get down to the
specifics."
Programs that now operate in
the existing structures will be relo
cated by following a "musical
chairs" approach to remodeling,
Jones said. For example, the
Physics Tank will not be destroyed

until the new Regional Teaching
Facility, which will replace it, is
built.
The Facilities Project Manage
ment Office plans to hire an outside
construction management firm to
help them create a step-by-step
approach to handling the logistics of
the transition. Details of the project
will then be reviewed by those aca
demic departments affected by the
remodeling.
"We are experienced as a campus
at maintaining active construction
sites while maintaining active teach
ing and research programs," Jones
said. "We will continue to follow the
safety programs that are standard."

Current construction on the east
side of the Quad will continue until
1999 as part of a seismic strength
ening effort. Work on the Gates
Computer Science Building and the
Center for Integrated Systems (CIS)
building — both essential parts of
the new science and engineering
quad, Jones said — also should be
completed by the end of 1995.
"We lived through Gilbert (Bio
logical Sciences Building), now we're
living through Gates and CIS," said
Physics Department Chair Douglas
Osheroff. "That's the price you pay
for nice new buildings."
Although Osheroff said he is not
concerned about the University's

ability to sustain operations, he
added he is worried that parking
may be both inconvenient and a
safety hazard during the transition.
The Varian parking lot usually
utilized by faculty and students will
be unusable because of surrounding
construction, possibly forcing
motorists to park far away.
Osheroff pointed out that a long
walk would discourage him from
carrying heavy physics equipment
for demonstrations, and could also
be a threat to female students
whose classes finished at night.
However, Glen did not think that
parking was a major concern.
"When we remove parking spaces,

there are provisions for parking
replacement that will include costs
... they will probably be costs that
the University takes care of."
Detailed architectural and logis
tical preparations are more pressing
matters, Jones said.
"The Near West Campus project
is a massive construction job that
must be accomplished without dis
rupting teaching and research," he
said. "That is task number one."
Field construction on the first of
the new buildings will begin toward
the end of 1995. Work on the new
utilities will precede this in mid- to
late 1995 and current buildings will
not be demolished until 1996 or later.

Despite the grand plans for
reconstruction, there are a few pro
fessors who have expressed a fond
ness for the older buildings.
"Sequoia Hall is a wonderful
building, nearly 100 years old," said
Statistics Prof. Bradley Efron,
whose office is located there. "It's
nicely designed so that faculty and
students get to mix a lot. I hope our
new building will include its best
features."
But others disagreed with
Efron's assessment of the current
building. "Sequoia Hall is an
ancient building," said Statistics
Prof. Abraham Wyner. "If there is a
new building, it can only be better."
