# Engineer, triathlete, and most of all — coach
## The
						many sides of Cardinal water polo leader

"I don't believe in superstition.
I don't believe in luck. Luck is
when preparation meets opportu
nity. ... If you're prepared, there
is no luck involved."
The words of men's water polo
coach Dante Dettamanti convey
his basic philosophy — success
demands preparation.
Maybe the attitude stems from

his experience as a lieutenant
with the Army Corps of Engi
neers. During the Vietnam War,
Dettamanti was building a road
near the Korean border when his
men were attacked.
"The North Koreans fired into
our camp with machine guns,
killed three guys and wounded
25," Dettamanti said. "We didn't
have any weapons."
In the pool, Dettamanti's
teams always come out firing.

Practice is an ongoing dialogue.
Dettamanti won't let little mis
takes go by uncorrected; he is
always pushing to be prepared.
"I really get into the practice,
everything about it," Dettamanti
said. "I try to make sure every
thing is going right. I'm really a
perfectionist."
Dettamanti certainly knows
water polo. In his 17 years as
Stanford's coach, the Cardinal
squad has finished in the top four
a remarkable 14 times, including
six national championships. The
man with the lyrical name has
been named NCAA Coach of the
Year four times and Pacific 10
Conference Coach of the Year on
eight occasions.
"I didn't start out to be a
coach," Dettamanti explained
with some irony. He was a swim
mer and water polo player at UC-
Davis, where he graduated with a
degree in engineering. So why
coach? "I never really liked engi
neering," he said.
Fortunately for Stanford, Detta
manti does like coaching. He gets
closely involved with his teams.
"I'm a hands-on coach," he
said. "I like to be right out there
by the side of the pool. If I were a
basketball coach, I'd walk right
out on the middle of the court."
Dettamanti extended the bas
ketball metaphor to his team's
style of play, and compared them
to the Golden State Warriors. "I
think |our style] is exciting for the
fans to watch . . . fast breaks,
quick movements, high scoring."
While he no longer gets into
the water to show his team how
it's done, he still talks a good
game. "I lie to them a lot and tell
them what a great player I was.
And I tell them that I never made
mistakes when I was a player."
Dettamanti also likes to talk
about the great teams he had here
in the 1980s. His 1980 and 1981
squads both won national champi
onships. His 1983 team, comprised
mostly of freshmen, was the only
team in 17 years to post a losing
record. That group returned in
1984 to take second in the NCAAs.
In 1985, they won a national cham
pionship. The 1986 squad, like the
one in 1981, went undefeated.
After all their successful

accomplishments in the pool, Det
tamanti likes to remember what
those players have achieved since
leaving Stanford.
"One thing I am really proud of
is that the people we get here at
Stanford go on to be so successful
in so many other endeavors," he
said. "For instance, our 1980 team
had six doctors, three Olympians,
and one astronaut [Steve Smith,
who was on the recently completed
mission of the space shuttle
Endeavour]."
Dettamanti is modest about his
role as a mentor to his players.
"I'm not a coach that tries to mold
their lives. I'm not that good at
doing that."
After some thought, he admit
ted that perhaps he has had some
positive influence, saying, "I
think in some way that I don't
realize and they don't realize, I
have shaped their lives."
Dettamanti's dedication to his
sport has at times replaced his
personal life.
"I never got married and part of
that might be the time commitment
from water polo and the amount I
put into water polo," he said. "I
think if I had gotten married and
still done all these things, my mar
riage probably would have gone bad

because I put water polo first." He
does not regret the lifestyle.
Success seems to follow Detta
manti, but not without reason. He
is exceptionally determined.
"I compete," he explained. "I
always said, 'Nobody is going to
prepare better than I do.' I'm
going to be in the best shape, I'm
going to be ready to play.
If somebody beats me, it's
going to be because he's better
than I am."
In explaining his philosophy,
Dettamanti mentioned casually
that he competed in triathlons. In
fact, the first triathlon he entered
was The Ironman Triathlon, one of
the toughest and most prestigious
trials in sports. He revealed how he
finished only after being asked.
"I came in sixth place overall."
In his first triathlon. At 38 years
old.
"I trained for 6 months, that's
all I did," he said. "I focused on it
and put everything into it. I beat a
lot of people that just didn't know
how to prepare for it."
There are some things which
Dettamanti himself failed to pre
pare for. For instance, after win
ning the championship last year,
