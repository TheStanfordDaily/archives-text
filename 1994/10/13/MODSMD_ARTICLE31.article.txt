## Five of Cardinal team finish in top seven at Invite 
### Emery Chen Staff writer 
Maybe this game isn't so
tough.
Stanford's women's golf team
continued to roll, defeating all
comers to take the Edean
Ihlanfeldt Invitational Tourna
ment by 27 strokes, the second
championship in two tries for the
Cardinal this season.
The tournament, held on the
Sahalee Country Club in Red
mond, Wash., included fourth
ranked Tulsa and 12th-ranked
Arizona.
"We proved to everyone that
last week wasn't a fluke," said
sophomore Andrea Baxter.
"It was an all-out team effort,"
said coach Tim Baldwin. "Our
five players finished in the top
seven. The five are a really tight
group."
The Cardinal golfers were con
sistent throughout the three days
with scores of 298-297-301 for a
total of 896. Second place Tulsa,
with two World Cup players, shot
923.
"The course is the best one

we'll play on all year," Baldwin
said. "It's a really narrow course
and Douglas firs line the fairways.
It's going to host the 1996 PGA
Championships."
All-American Mhairi McKay
performed up to the expectations
of many by shooting 221 over the
three rounds to win the individu
al championship. The sophomore
had scores of 73-73-75 on the par
72 course to come from behind
and take the tournament by two
strokes.
Going into the 17th hole dur
ing the final round, McKay had a
comfortable three-stroke lead.
However, she put her tee shot
into the water on the par-three
hole.
"I was just trying to get on the
green," McKay said. "I had some
negative thoughts going through
my mind on the tee and that
wasn't good. I was pretty
annoyed."
McKay ended up double bogey
ing the hole to drop to a one
stroke lead going into the final
hole, a tough par five.
"The 18th is a really tough par
five," Baldwin said. "[McKay's

performance! was really beauti
ful."
"I ended up around 20 yards
short of the green," McKay said.
"I got up and down. I pitched to
about 10 or 12 feet and knocked it
down."
The birdie sealed the victory
for McKay over Sara Beautell of
Tulsa, Spain's top-ranked play
er.
Finishing tied for fourth were
Vicky Strada, a junior, and senior
Jamille Jose. The pair ended up
five strokes off the pace.
"Vicky Strada is one of the best
players," Baldwin said.
"She's [a] very long [hitter]
and strong. She ran into difficulty
on every round but came back
really well and Jamille was really
steady."
Baxter, last week's champion
in the Nike Invitational and a pre
season Ail-American, was tied for
seventh with a 229.
"Andrea's really talented,"
Baldwin said.
"She was coming off of her vic
tory and took a lot of risks but
some backfired. But who am I to
change her ways."

"I didn't play the greatest,"
Baxter said. "I was a little ner
vous and tried to do really
well."
Senior Amy Lawrence also tied
for seventh. Baldwin anticipates
that she will soon join Baxter and
McKay with a victory.
"I wouldn't doubt in a minute
that she will win a tournament
this year," Baldwin said.
Lawrence will get her chance
Oct. 28-30 on the Bayonet Golf
Course in Fort Ord, Monterey.
"While the Sahalee is the best,
the Bayonet Golf Course is going
to be the toughest we'll play on all
year," Baldwin said.
The competition will also be
difficult. Top-ranked Arizona
State, No. 2 San Jose State, and
Tulsa will appear in addition to
North Carolina and other top
teams.
After that, it doesn't get any
easier. The last tournament of
the fall quarter for the Cardinal
will be at the Golf World tourna
ment in Hilton Head, N.C., Nov.
11-13. The top 12 ranked
women's teams will take part in
the action.
