# The 						evolution of BLUES Chris Duarte brings his brand of rock-blues fusion to the Coffee House
## intermission. 
### Seeta Gangadharan 
For Texan musician Chris Duarte, the
quickest way from the head and heart
to the guitar is the blues.
"From an artist's standpoint, the blues is
true self expression," Duarte said in a phone
interview. "It's not just patterns every night.
It's different because you're not the same
everyday. I try go out and say what's on my
mind and in my heart."
This is not traditional blues, however. You
won't see Duarte playing traditional gunk-a
gunk-a-gunk blues. Performing at the Coffee
House next Wednesday, Duarte will bring us
his own brand of R&B: Texas style (i.e. BIG),
aggressive, and pfunky.
Bluer than thou?
Because of his (mostly) white, Texan
roots, Duarte has been frequently
compared to the late Stevie Ray
Vaughan. The association, while an apt char
acterization or indication of the level of
Duarte's talent, is not entirely complimenta
ry-
"l'm not a musician who is striving to be
like anybody else although I've been com
pared to a lot of greats like Stevie Ray," Duarte
said. "I'm just trying to take those [artists']
inspiration, picking up what they gave us, the
next generation, and hopefully evolving
them into something else."
Thus drawing from blues and jazz (Buddy
Guy, Junior Wells, and John McLaughlin) as
well as rock/punk forms (Sex Pistols, Dead
Kennedys, Deadboys and Jimmi Hendrix),
Duarte flaunts a rather unique R&B style.
In his debut release "Texas Sugar/Strat
Magik," Duarte wields his axe (down in
Texas, that's what they call guitars) with fierce
flavor of hard-edged pfunky blues. Duarte
cultivates a wild style, working together with
bassist John Jordan and drummer Brannen
Temple.
Who can be blue?
Inventing his own niche in the blues
world, Duarte seems to recognize the
honesty in his fusion style. While he
reveres traditional blues artists who root
themselves in genre's history (and subse
quently do everything old school from outer
wear to equipment), Duarte is confident of
himself and of the path he wants to take his
music down.
"Everyone starts in some sort of garage
band," he joked in reference to his earliest
musical experiences. From AC/DC to Hen
drix to Howlin' Wolf, Duarte shifted to a
blues orientation without ever forgetting his

hard rock background.
Since the birth of blues, modern music has
borrowed from the style through and
through. Made popular by Jelly Roll Morton,
Albert King, 8.8. King and Muddy Waters
amongst other legends, the blues chord was
the "lost chord" and when discovered by a
music publisher in 1903, became the "Song
of the 20th Century."
Duarte is quick to qualify that "our music
is definitely R&B based, but it also has a lot of
roots in rock."
Blue.
Blues in the 19905, it seems, has depart
ed from its historic roots. Listeners
pay a pricey fee — say, at the San
Francisco Blues Festival or the Monterey Jazz
Festival — to see some artist get down and
sing about being poor. And they groove right
along with him or her, convincing themselves
that they, too, know the blues.
Hence, it is comforting that next week
Duarte is performing for free at an intimate
venue like the Coffeehouse, where he can
communicate his blues, playing off his band
and the audience.
Of course, this is a somewhat of an abso
lutist (and maybe flat-out myopic) charac
terization of the blues and blues audience.
And the characterization may be a bit unfair.
Everyone has a some kind of blue in him or
her, regardless of when and where they listen
to the music, and even of the ticket price.
And more importantly, blues, as a musical
genre, has evolved since its creation into all
sorts of hybrid forms. It is an evolution which
new artists, such as Texas bluesman Chris
Duarte, wish to exploit and build upon.
"Music," Duarte explained, "evolves it
self just the way organisms do and the way
people do through time. Whether it be
picking up new technology or [innovating]
through sheer boredom, music always
evolves itself.
"True, we do have recu/rences of [musi-
cal 1 eras. But still, true artists are trying to
think of new ways to do it and new ways to say
it,"he said. "And that's why I hope I'm doing
justice in evolving it in a correct manner and
not just rehashing it." ■

Magik," Duarte wields his axe (down in
Texas, that's what they call guitars) with fierce
flavor of hard-edged pfunky blues. Duarte
cultivates a wild style, working together with
bassist John Jordan and drummer Brannen
Temple.
Who can be blue?
Inventing his own niche in the blues
world, Duarte seems to recognize the
honesty in his fusion style. While he
reveres traditional blues artists who root
themselves in genre's history (and subse
quently do everything old school from outer
wear to equipment), Duarte is confident of
himself and of the path he wants to take his
music down.
"Everyone starts in some sort of garage
band," he joked in reference to his earliest
musical experiences. From AC/DC to Hen
drix to Howlin' Wolf, Duarte shifted to a
blues orientation without ever forgetting his

hard rock background.
Since the birth of blues, modern music has
borrowed from the style through and
through. Made popular by Jelly Roll Morton,
Albert King, 8.8. King and Muddy Waters
amongst other legends, the blues chord was
the "lost chord" and when discovered by a
music publisher in 1903, became the "Song
of the 20th Century."
Duarte is quick to qualify that "our music
is definitely R&B based, but it also has a lot of
roots in rock."
Blue.
Blues in the 19905, it seems, has depart
ed from its historic roots. Listeners
pay a pricey fee — say, at the San
Francisco Blues Festival or the Monterey Jazz
Festival — to see some artist get down and
sing about being poor. And they groove right
along with him or her, convincing themselves
that they, too, know the blues.
Hence, it is comforting that next week
Duarte is performing for free at an intimate
venue like the Coffeehouse, where he can
communicate his blues, playing off his band
and the audience.
Of course, this is a somewhat of an abso
lutist (and maybe flat-out myopic) charac
terization of the blues and blues audience.
And the characterization may be a bit unfair.
Everyone has a some kind of blue in him or
her, regardless of when and where they listen
to the music, and even of the ticket price.
And more importantly, blues, as a musical
genre, has evolved since its creation into all
sorts of hybrid forms. It is an evolution which
new artists, such as Texas bluesman Chris
Duarte, wish to exploit and build upon.
"Music," Duarte explained, "evolves it
self just the way organisms do and the way
people do through time. Whether it be
picking up new technology or [innovating]
through sheer boredom, music always
evolves itself.
"True, we do have recu/rences of [musi-
cal 1 eras. But still, true artists are trying to
think of new ways to do it and new ways to say
it,"he said. "And that's why I hope I'm doing
justice in evolving it in a correct manner and
not just rehashing it." ■
