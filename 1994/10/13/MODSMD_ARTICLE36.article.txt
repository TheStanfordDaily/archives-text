# San Jose's Showcase Theatre turns a MEASURE of incongruous allegory into a production of great MEASURE

### Linda Friedlieb 
A Shakespearean play set in
1930s Austria.

Director David Higginbotham infuses
"Measure" with a 20th-century
morality lesson, as he positions the

character of Angelo as an unthinking en

not the only ways in which
"Measure" deviates from his-

torical practice in performance. ()neespecial
ly interesting choice is the race-blind casting
evident in the choice of African-American
actor San ford Marshall in the role ofClaudio.
Undeniably a fine actor, Marshall's ap
pearance on stage in one of the first scenes
standing next to the very Caucasian, ex
tremely pregnant Juliet (Jessica Teeter) leads
us to think this performance is going to be a
stunning racial commentary.
When we realize that in reality interpret
ing Angelo as a Nazi cannot help but suggest

another connotation oi the word race, the
casting becomes almost ironic. But in the
end, we can't help but wonder if one of the
reasons Angelo comes down so hard on
Claudio is the threat of miscegenation.
The mere presence of the quasi-Na/is
(after all they're never definitively called
members of the I litier's National Socialist
Party) is disturbing on its own, but in the end
Shakespeare's decidedly odd notions of jus
tice perturb even more.
The character of Lucio is the comic re
lief. With too much makeup and too
many exaggerated lines and move
ments, he's the kind of jester that appears
during tense moments in many Shakespeare
an comedies.
At one point, 1 ucio spends his time lambast
ing the absent Duke (who unbeknownst to
I ucio is the friar listening to his comic critique)
When the Duke finally frees himself from
his religious robe, it could be argued that the
boisterous but harmless I ucio bears a tar more
severe punishment than the quiet yet dastard
ly Angelo.
But then that all depends on how we judge
both crime and punishment.
Hither way, this cup of drama is one worth
measuring. ■

Director David Higginbotham infuses
"Measure" with a 20th-century
morality lesson, as he positions the

character of Angelo as an unthinking en
forcer of the laws.
A large red cloth stripe hanging as a back
drop during scenes set in governmental of
fices further suggests the Nazi backdrop in
which Shakespeare's 16th-century words
seem incongruous but the enduring strands
of his plot are oddly appropriate.
With typical blond good looks and a re
served self-restraint, wearing a black uni
form with a red arm band, Dennis Kirchoff
I udwick's Angelo suggests the epitome of the

This characteriza
tion ot Angelo is very dif-

ferent from other produc
tions of "Measure" in which
he is portrayed as passion
ately evil.
However, the setting and

Angelo's characterization arc
not the only ways in which
"Measure" deviates from his-

torical practice in performance. ()neespecial
ly interesting choice is the race-blind casting
evident in the choice of African-American
actor San ford Marshall in the role ofClaudio.
Undeniably a fine actor, Marshall's ap
pearance on stage in one of the first scenes
standing next to the very Caucasian, ex
tremely pregnant Juliet (Jessica Teeter) leads
us to think this performance is going to be a
stunning racial commentary.
When we realize that in reality interpret
ing Angelo as a Nazi cannot help but suggest

another connotation oi the word race, the
casting becomes almost ironic. But in the
end, we can't help but wonder if one of the
reasons Angelo comes down so hard on
Claudio is the threat of miscegenation.
The mere presence of the quasi-Na/is
(after all they're never definitively called
members of the I litier's National Socialist
Party) is disturbing on its own, but in the end
Shakespeare's decidedly odd notions of jus
tice perturb even more.
The character of Lucio is the comic re
lief. With too much makeup and too
many exaggerated lines and move
ments, he's the kind of jester that appears
during tense moments in many Shakespeare
an comedies.
At one point, 1 ucio spends his time lambast
ing the absent Duke (who unbeknownst to
I ucio is the friar listening to his comic critique)
When the Duke finally frees himself from
his religious robe, it could be argued that the
boisterous but harmless I ucio bears a tar more
severe punishment than the quiet yet dastard
ly Angelo.
But then that all depends on how we judge
both crime and punishment.
Hither way, this cup of drama is one worth
measuring. ■
