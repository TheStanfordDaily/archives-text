# THE
						HISTORY OF REGGAE
## FROM SKA TO FEMALE DANCEHALL 
### PHIL LECKMAN 
To most people, reggae is synonymous
with Bob Marley, the Jamaican super
star whose brand of political music
made him a household word during the 19705.
But reggae is actually a complex and long-last
ing genre, reaching from the ska and rocksteady
of the 1960s to the dancehall sounds of today.
This year's "Reggae in the Park" festival, a
two-day event in San Francisco's Golden Gate
Park this weekend, brings together many of the
diverse threads that make up modern reggae,
from its cutting edge to its most respected elder
statesmen.
Two of the featured bands this year represent
the opposite ends of this spectrum, from The
Skatalites, the seminal ska band, to Worl-A-
Girl's crossover female dancehall reggae.
THE SKATALITES
Modern reggae music, as played by
Bob Marley, grew directly out of ska,
a fast-paced, high-octane blend of
numerous musical influences and styles, from
jazz to R&B, and the first distinctly Jamaican
musical form to gain popularity outside the is
lands.
The band which did the most to popularize
ska was the Skatalites, led by legendary saxman
Tommy McCook. "I've been 51 years on the
road, since 1943 when I was a teenager, and I'm
still there holding on," McCook says in a phone
interview.
Before founding the Skatalites in 1964, Mc-
Cook and the rest of the band members were
popular studio musicians for the Jamaican
music producers of the era, backing up solo
artists like Desmond Dekker, Jimmy Cliff and
others who would go on to become reggae
greats, including Bob Marley.
The Skatalites were formed to gain more
money and fame for these studio musicians, and
to share in the rising popularity of ska, at that
time "the hottest music that came on the Ja
maican scene," according to McCook. For fifteen
months the Skatalites "reigned" over Jamaican
music, performing "from Kingston to Montego
Bay" and providing the music for the young Bob
Marley's first hit single, "Simmer Down."
When ska's popularity eventually faded as
the slower reggae beat began to take over, the
Skatalites broke up and its members started
their own bands or returned to freelance work.
McCook formed the Supersonics, a band that
became "a force to be reckoned wit'" in the reg
gae world.
About this time, McCook also made a major
contribution to popular music by "sending Bob
Marley on de reggae trail." McCook was friends
with Bob, Bunny Wailer and Peter Tosh—Mar
ley's original Wailers—since he often passed by
the studio they worked for on the way to his own
rehearsal.
At the time the Wailers were popular — "re
ally wailing" in McCook's words — but they
had little creative freedom, and the studio they
worked for took most of the profit from their
work. One day when he was sharing a smoke
with Bob, McCook says he suggested the future
reggae superstar "try some fe' yourself? You
can't do any worse." A few weeks later Bob took

this advice, and McCook

organized the horn

section for
"Catch A
Fire," the
Wailers'
first in
terna-
tionally re

album. The

for the next

few years,
earning liv

cians. The early '80s
saw a resurgence in the

popularity of ska, and after a
successful reunion per
formance in
1983

for Sunsplash in Jamaica, McCook saw that
once again "ska could make a go."
With most of the band members living in the
U.S., McCook reformed the band and began to
tour again, bringing his music to the next gen
eration of ska fans. With a new record on the
Shanachie label to "pay tribute to our 30 years of
struggle," McCook and the rest of the Skatalites
are not content to simply rest on their reputa
tions. The new album, "Hi-Bop Ska," features
guest appearances from many of the performers
who have worked with the Skatalites over their
long history, and McCook says they "had a ball"
making it.
Looking back on his long career, McCook
says"I wouldn't have done anything else mon
... I raised a family from music and I'm still
earning from music, I'm happy. I have a lot to be
thankful for that Jah has guided me and pre
served me and my family until now ... nine
teen -ninety-and- four."

REGGAE IN THE PARK COMES TO
THE CITY

turing of "dancehall" and the romantic
sounds of "lover's rock."
Dancehall's increased popularity has attract
ed the attention of the hip-hop community, and
many of today's groups are poised to crossover
to mainstream success in the same way Bob
Marley once did. Worl-A-Girl, the first all-fe
male dancehall group, is in the forefront of this
new movement.
They've released only one album, but have
already performed with well-established acts
like Gregory Isaacs and Jimmy Cliff and put in
appearances on the Arsenio Hall and David Let
terman shows. Charmaine Reid, one of the
group's singers, is optimistic about increased
success.
"Reggae today is where hip-hop was fifteen
years ago," she says from a New York studio,
where Worl-A-Girl is working on a song for their
new album. "Hip-hop will incorporate more
and more reggae in the future—it's not a fad, it's
here to stay." Worl-A-Girl counts on being part
of dancehall reggae's expanding popularity.
Each of the four women in Worl-A-Girl is
originally from a different country. Charmaine
is the only Jamaican in the group, while the oth
ers — Sabrina, Sensi, and Miss Linda — hail

from Trinidad, England, and the U.S. Worl-A-
Girl formed in 1990, when, as solo artists, they
performed together at a showcase in New York
called Reggae Ladies of the Nineties.
Their collaboration finale, a song they had
written together called "Chemis Ina Dis," re
ceived a great response. They recorded the tune,
which received substantial radio play, but they re
mained on their own until the success of a second
single in 1991 encouraged the four performers to
become a full-fledged group. Since then, accord
ing to Charmaine, their efforts have received
more press than their work as solo artists.
When one of their producers referred to
them as "worl-a-girl" (world of girls) a popular
saying among the dancehall crowd, they took
the phrase as their name and had everything
they needed to start down the road to fame.
They signed a deal with Columbia, refined an
album they had already been working on, and
released it as their self-titled debut.
The members of Worl-A-Girl share diverse
musical backgrounds: while Charmaine origi
nally performed as a "lover's rock" singer like
Maxi Priest or Gregory Isaacs with cites blues
and jazz as her favorite musical styles, the other
members have backgrounds in R&B singing,
American hip-hop, and gospel as well as in
straight reggae.
"Worl-A-Girl was always intended as a
crossover," Charmaine explains, "it's not pure
dancehall or pure lover's rock." There is also a
strong hip-hop influence as well: Worl-A-Girl
has been called the "dancehall Salt-N-Pepa."
And like Salt-N-Pepa, Worl-A-Girl is fight
ing for acceptance in a genre that is often chau
vinistic and sexually exploitative.
Up until now, dancehall has been character
ized by performers like Shabba Ranks, who
makes hits like "Trailerload A Girls" and pub
licly advocates the crucifixion of homosexuals.
According to Charmaine, succeeding without
the use of "slackness," or sexually explicit mate
rial, is a real challenge.
"When someone makes it big with 'slack'
material, it's a roadblock to anybody who wants
to succeed without obscenity or violence. The
genre gets stereotyped and people start to think
that's all that sells," she says. Worl-A-Girl doesn't
dodge sexual issues, but does prefer to "leave
something to the imagination."
Ultimately, Charmaine says, Worl-A-Girl is
in the music business because of their fans.
When the audience is "into it"and reacts to their
music in an intense way, she says, is when Worl-
A-Girl is happiest to be performing.
"Our music appeals to everybody," she says.
"We love people. That's the main thing ofWorl-
A-Girl — we do this for our audience — so
come out and see our show." ■
