Prelude
They're coming. To take over your T.V.,
your homes, your impressionable chil
dren. They will appear on billboards in
your neighborhoods, radio programs playing
quietly in your office, the 24-hour video store
nearest you. They promise to push the limits of
our social imagination by any means necessary.
Worst of all, in those rare moments, when all you
want to do is relax, perhaps enjoy a good movie,
they will leap out at you like a tree in the night, hi
jacking the screen with paradigms you've never
perceived before. These people will color your
life forever.
Sound like a Pete Wilson Yes-on-187 cam
paign? Guess again.
Welcome to independent black filmmaking
101.
In 1986, Spike Lee surprised Hollywood with
the success of his independent feature hit, "She's
Gotta Have It." His übiquitous mass media entry
spawned a renaissance of independent black
filmmaking from the likes of Robert Townsend
and Keenan Ivory Wayans (of "In Living Color"
fame), to, more recently, folks like Julie Dash
("Daughter's of the Dust"), and Leslie Harris
("Just Another Girl on the IRT"). Armed with
impressive scripts, puny budgets and a healthy
dissatisfaction with Hollywood narratives, these
filmmakers pushed thematic and cinematic
boundaries in order to get their stories told.
Seeing the money on the wall, Hollywood de
cided to get a piece of the action. But that script's
title read like "Mo' Gangsta Movies" as the mass
media conglomerate ghetto-ized black cinemat
ic life by supporting directors like the Hughes
Brothers ("Menace II Society") to the exclusion

of all else.
Meanwhile, a young black and Irish woman
by the name of Darnell Martin was moving on
up. After attending Sarah Lawrence College, she
moved on to NYU film school where, among
other things, she began to learn the craft. Money
was tight until, one day, Martin decided to quiet
ly begin working on her own project — a script
for a movie about a Puerto Rican family living in
the Bronx.
Today, with the staggered release of her Co
lumbia Picture, "I Like it Like That," Martin has
distinguished herself as the first African-Ameri
can woman to direct a movie from a major studio.
ACT I — The Movie
A fiercely enterprising Puerto Rican
woman, a macho husband, three young
children in various stages of rebellion, a
transvestite brother/sister, a domineering moth
er, a touchy-feely boss and a husband-snatching
vixen combine to form the colorful cast of" I Like
it Like That."
Lauren Wlez plays Lisette Linares, a young
mother of three thrust into single-parenthood
after her errant husband Chino (Jon Seda) lands
himself in jail for stealing a stereo. After a brief
stint on welfare, Lisette breaks with her hus
band's wishes and decides to get a job.
With the perky aid of her transvestite sister's
fake' tetas! a formerly flat-chested Lisette hustles
her way into a modeling job for a record label
exec named Price (Griffin Dunne). She quickly
earns a more permanent position as the exec's as
sistant by helping him create a marketable image
for the singing duo the Menendez Brothers,
played by the hit group, "The Barrio Boyz."

The family falls into a chaotic
vortex of events that lead to Lisette
moving out, L'il Chino running
with the neighborhood bad boys
and selling drugs, and Chino ca
vorting in an adulterous affair.
At times, the script threatens
to fall into the dangerous cycle of
overwrought cliches. Alexis
(Jesse Borego), Lisette's sister,
skirts the edge of that awful sensi
tive-gay-man-next-door type —
she babysits for Lisette and
Chino, generously lends out her
tetas, gets beat up by her homo
phobic father and is rejected by
both her parents. All the while
she manages to represent an in
exhaustible supply of stability
and spirituality for the entire
community. She even owns the
neighborhood botanica.
"I don't like defining people
by their sexuality, or their gender,
or their race," Martin herself says
of Alexis. "To me that's just bad
writing.
"He's a transvestite, yes. I
made him a transvestite. But the
quality that defines him is that
family is very important to him.

He has a very strong sense of self. He's about being
a woman so in a sense you could call him a femi
nist Because he gives that sense of self to his sister.
"Jesse Borrego was also just amazing in that
role," Martin adds.
Fortunately, both Borrego and Wlez never let

their characters
revert to type. Vet
eran of the hit se
ries, "Fame," Bor
rego errs on the
side of the roman
tic to create a gen
uinely three-di
mensional por
trait as Lisette's
loving, outra
geous sister.
TomasMelly, a 10-
year-old orphan
cast to play L'il
Chino, turns in an
indelible perfor
mance as the
Linares' defiant
young son. Many
of the movies most
potent moments
revolve around
him and his quietly
rebellious behavior.
Martin says
meeting Melly
was one of the
highlights of
doing the movie.
"Many wonderful
things came out of
making the film.
But the best thing
that came out of
this movie was
meeting Tommy."

His striking on-screen presence prompted
her to refer to him as "the Christ child," she says.
"I used to call him that and everyone would
make fun of me."
At the film's heart are issues of familia, cotn
munidad, respetos, love and power. The external
forces affecting the Linares family, brought on by
the harsh economic reality of the Bronx, serve to
heighten the more intimate tensions and con
cerns between the various characters.
Stripped down, "I Like it Like That," breaks
no new ground thematicnlly. Where it does
score, however, is in its nuanced exploration of
family and community and its adventurous por
trayal of people simply living. Although firmly
located in the Puerto Rican Bronx, Martin's solid
directorial debut reaches on* to a universal com
munity of viewers whose affinities transcend
race, class, gender, and neighborhood.
Interlude
The film's publicists invite journalists to
Mill Valley, where the city's film festival
featurs" I Like It Like That", to interview
the two leads of the movie and the director. It is a
warm, sunny day and I look forward to the scenic
trip. Unfortunately, a good proportion of the San
Francisco Bay Area decides to take this same
drive and we spend an excruciating 45 minutes
inching closer and closer to the Golden Gate
Bridge...

But then, Eureka. I saw, I bit, I chewed.
ACT II — The Woman
It took about a year and a half to write the
script," says Martin, sinking into a large
couch. She picks up a pesticide-infected
apple off of the table in front of her and consid
ers it for a moment.
"When it was done I sent it out to all the agen
cies. All the agencies said, no, they weren't inter
ested," she continues explaining that initially
only Newline was interested in the film — but at
a miniscule $2 million budget.
While she was negotiating with Newline, a
friend offered to show Martin's script to Colum
bia Pictures. Those weren't her only friends in
high places.
"The Hudlin Brothers (the twins who pro
duced "House Party" and "House Party II")
were running around telling everyone in Holly
wood about [the movie], which was great They
were so supportive.
The heat was on not long after that.
"Everybody found out about it, and wanted to
do it. But I chose to go with Columbia," Martin
says. With a contract that she is reluctant to dis
cuss, she finally went ahead and made her movie.
"I think you have pay your dues, somewhere,
so you choose where you're gonna pay them. If
you're gonna try to get a script out, whip out a
draft that's just almost there, but not quite.
