then? Attaching a star? Or, can I pitch really

and discusses her Christ-child allusion.

ACT lll—The Leads
When Lauren Wlez saw the casting ad
for "Blackout," — eventually
named "I Like it Like That," — it
didn't take her long to analyze the situation.
"I read it and I said — they wanted a flat
chested, dark-skinned Latina—and I said, okay,
there's no way I'm gonna get this because I'm not
flat-chested. And I know when Hollywood
wants dark-skinned Latina, they mean Rita
Moreno with a tan, they don't mean dark
skinned."
Vdez nevertheless got an agent and sent in a
picture.
"I never thought that anything would come
of it," she says. Having seen her startling talent on
the big screen, this is hard to believe.
"I really didn't," she insists. "I wanted it so
bad. But, I just said there's no way they're gonna
cast me. Hollywood is very ignorant about types,
and people of color all fall under the same um
brella, unfortunately. They just don't get it. So it's
just like, I don't know when I'll see a Latina like
me on the screen.
"And they proved me wrong," she laughs.
How 'bout that.
It's difficult to find good material to work
with as an actor, period. For many actors of
color, this feat becomes a near impossibility. And
so for both Wlez and her leading man Jon Seda,
finding "I Like it Like That," was akin to discov
ering the gold at the end of the rainbow.
"When I got the script I was like 'What! Look
at this, this is real,'" Seda enthused. "I know peo
ple that live like this—my cousins, my friends —
I've seen this type of lifestyle with this family. I
said this is amazing, and this is Latino, and this is
positive. It shows us in a different light It's not
stereotyped."
V£lez was also attracted to the rare chance to
play someone with an emotional range as wide
as Lisette's.

"It reminded me of my younger sister Maria,
who's very much like Lisette. I've always wanted
to be that kind of a person who just says what's
on their mind, who's really emotional.
This is an opportunity seldom afforded Lati
no actors in Hollywood. "Usually when you see
scripts for Latinos," explains Seda, "it's like, bam!
Drugdealer. Bam! Gang member. Bam! The wel
fare case. I saw the script and was like, I can do
this. I want to do this."
He had one concern. "I didn't mind if I lost
out on the role, but I wanted to lose out to a Lati
no. The way Hollywood is right now, I lose out to
Americans playing Latinos."
Audience expectations are inevitably affected
by this situation. "People keep saying, It's noth
ing at all like I expected," says V6lez. "People
thought somebody was gonna die, somebody
was gonna 0.D., or somebody was gonna what
ever, and I keep saying why? It's an ethnic cast
and you expect doom and gloom?"
Sadly enough, with the kinds of mainstream
movies dealing with black or Latino people, this
is not such an unreasonable expectation.
"That's the problem," laments Wlez. "People
get these expectations and say 'oh, is that the Latin
experience?' I'm like, no. It's not the Latin experi
ence, it's a Latin experience. This family could be
Polish, they could be Italian, they could be any
thing. They just happen to be Puerto Rican."
Unfortunately, "just happening" to be Puerto
Rican wasn't enough. In an effort to target black
as well as Latino audiences, Coulmbia Pictures
billed "I Like it Like That" as a black and Latino
tug-of-war. This decision was met by fierce
protest from the lead actors and the director.
"It really made me angry," says Wlez, "cause
they made it sound like it was this jungle fever,
which, if you're gonna take Lisette's cultural

identity away from
her, then why not
make Chino white? It
makes it sound like
that's the issue when
it's not the issue."
If both Seda and
V£lez had problems,
they weren't directly
related to the produc
tion of the movie.
Martin's keen intellect
as a director ensured
that their experiences
were productive. Of
course, there was the
small matter of Mar
tin's appearance to get
over.
"When my manag
er first saw her, he said,
'she looks like she's 12,
she's the director?'
says Wlez. "I looked at
her and I said, I guess
she's Latin. Darnell
Martin, Dar-nell Mar
tin. And she's all little
and stuff?'
The doubts were
swiftly erased as cast
and crew got going.
"Working with [Mar
tin ] was the best work
ing experience I've had

with a director male or female," she says. "She
was incredibly generous to me, and supportive,
and gave me all the room I needed, let me do
anything 1 needed to do for the character. Ask
from her anything I needed. She's like the mighty
train."
Interlude
Martin walks by while we're talking.
"Lies, lies, all lies!" she cries out, with
out having heard a single word. Then
she looks straight at me and exclaims, "Braces!
Retainers! I had those once. Aren't they a pain?"
I nod in deep empathy.
"I dropped them," she continues, baring her
teeth. "Look. See how they're going back?"
I don't. And then Martin is off on her merry
way.
The hype surrounding "I Like it Like That"
is generated by several things. For those
caught up in the notion of firsts, the film
is a gold mine — a first-time director, the first
black woman to get a major motion picture deal,
and the first complex portrayal of Latino life on
the big screen. For the movie's cast, Martin's
biggest accomplishment is that her script ex
pands previously limited horizons, not only for
Latino actors and directors, but for the entire mo
tion picture industry as well
"This could be the big start of a new era in
Hollywood for the Latinos. I really feel it Like
1995 is the year of change. I'm getting my foot in
the door, and I'm holding it open to let all the
Latinos come in."
They're coming.
And neither myopic governors nor paranoid
institutions can stop them. ■

There's a couple things wrong with it but you
think, ah, whatever," she says. "What's the hook
then? Attaching a star? Or, can I pitch really
good, is that it?
"Or you can just really work and work and
work on your script until it's so hot that people
don't want to put it down 'cause they think
somebody else will make money and they'll look
stupid."
And you chose door number...
"I chose to work until my script was actually
there."
So what was shooting in a primarily residential
neighborhood like?
"We wanted to be somewhere that wanted us.
So we talked to different neighborhoods, and
this one wanted us. We got them involved be
hind the scenes, on the production end of it, but
also in the movie as well. It all worked out great"
What about the actor who plays L'il Chino?
Martin leans forward with a penetrating stare
and discusses her Christ-child allusion.
"There's a picture of this baby, and the way it's
painted by this brilliant artist, is that your eyes
just pass through the adults, through every sin
gle thing, and are drawn to the child," she says.
"You can almost see his soul, emanating from his
body. As if it's too big for his body. That is the ul
timate expression of life. And when you look at
Tommy, that's what you see."
"And I'm not crazy for saying that."
ACT lll—The Leads
When Lauren Wlez saw the casting ad
for "Blackout," — eventually
named "I Like it Like That," — it
didn't take her long to analyze the situation.
"I read it and I said — they wanted a flat
chested, dark-skinned Latina—and I said, okay,
there's no way I'm gonna get this because I'm not
flat-chested. And I know when Hollywood
wants dark-skinned Latina, they mean Rita
Moreno with a tan, they don't mean dark
skinned."
Vdez nevertheless got an agent and sent in a
picture.
"I never thought that anything would come
of it," she says. Having seen her startling talent on
the big screen, this is hard to believe.
"I really didn't," she insists. "I wanted it so
bad. But, I just said there's no way they're gonna
cast me. Hollywood is very ignorant about types,
and people of color all fall under the same um
brella, unfortunately. They just don't get it. So it's
just like, I don't know when I'll see a Latina like
me on the screen.
"And they proved me wrong," she laughs.
How 'bout that.
It's difficult to find good material to work
with as an actor, period. For many actors of
color, this feat becomes a near impossibility. And
so for both Wlez and her leading man Jon Seda,
finding "I Like it Like That," was akin to discov
ering the gold at the end of the rainbow.
"When I got the script I was like 'What! Look
at this, this is real,'" Seda enthused. "I know peo
ple that live like this—my cousins, my friends —
I've seen this type of lifestyle with this family. I
said this is amazing, and this is Latino, and this is
positive. It shows us in a different light It's not
stereotyped."
V£lez was also attracted to the rare chance to
play someone with an emotional range as wide
as Lisette's.

"It reminded me of my younger sister Maria,
who's very much like Lisette. I've always wanted
to be that kind of a person who just says what's
on their mind, who's really emotional.
This is an opportunity seldom afforded Lati
no actors in Hollywood. "Usually when you see
scripts for Latinos," explains Seda, "it's like, bam!
Drugdealer. Bam! Gang member. Bam! The wel
fare case. I saw the script and was like, I can do
this. I want to do this."
He had one concern. "I didn't mind if I lost
out on the role, but I wanted to lose out to a Lati
no. The way Hollywood is right now, I lose out to
Americans playing Latinos."
Audience expectations are inevitably affected
by this situation. "People keep saying, It's noth
ing at all like I expected," says V6lez. "People
thought somebody was gonna die, somebody
was gonna 0.D., or somebody was gonna what
ever, and I keep saying why? It's an ethnic cast
and you expect doom and gloom?"
Sadly enough, with the kinds of mainstream
movies dealing with black or Latino people, this
is not such an unreasonable expectation.
"That's the problem," laments Wlez. "People
get these expectations and say 'oh, is that the Latin
experience?' I'm like, no. It's not the Latin experi
ence, it's a Latin experience. This family could be
Polish, they could be Italian, they could be any
thing. They just happen to be Puerto Rican."
Unfortunately, "just happening" to be Puerto
Rican wasn't enough. In an effort to target black
as well as Latino audiences, Coulmbia Pictures
billed "I Like it Like That" as a black and Latino
tug-of-war. This decision was met by fierce
protest from the lead actors and the director.
"It really made me angry," says Wlez, "cause
they made it sound like it was this jungle fever,
which, if you're gonna take Lisette's cultural

identity away from
her, then why not
make Chino white? It
makes it sound like
that's the issue when
it's not the issue."
If both Seda and
V£lez had problems,
they weren't directly
related to the produc
tion of the movie.
Martin's keen intellect
as a director ensured
that their experiences
were productive. Of
course, there was the
small matter of Mar
tin's appearance to get
over.
"When my manag
er first saw her, he said,
'she looks like she's 12,
she's the director?'
says Wlez. "I looked at
her and I said, I guess
she's Latin. Darnell
Martin, Dar-nell Mar
tin. And she's all little
and stuff?'
The doubts were
swiftly erased as cast
and crew got going.
"Working with [Mar
tin ] was the best work
ing experience I've had

with a director male or female," she says. "She
was incredibly generous to me, and supportive,
and gave me all the room I needed, let me do
anything 1 needed to do for the character. Ask
from her anything I needed. She's like the mighty
train."
Interlude
Martin walks by while we're talking.
"Lies, lies, all lies!" she cries out, with
out having heard a single word. Then
she looks straight at me and exclaims, "Braces!
Retainers! I had those once. Aren't they a pain?"
I nod in deep empathy.
"I dropped them," she continues, baring her
teeth. "Look. See how they're going back?"
I don't. And then Martin is off on her merry
way.
The hype surrounding "I Like it Like That"
is generated by several things. For those
caught up in the notion of firsts, the film
is a gold mine — a first-time director, the first
black woman to get a major motion picture deal,
and the first complex portrayal of Latino life on
the big screen. For the movie's cast, Martin's
biggest accomplishment is that her script ex
pands previously limited horizons, not only for
Latino actors and directors, but for the entire mo
tion picture industry as well
"This could be the big start of a new era in
