As election day approaches, an unlikely
coalition of Asian-American, public service
and conservative student groups has
formed to sponsor a speaker series about
Asian Americans in politics.
The "Asians in Politics '94" series is an
attempt to bring speakers from both major
political parties to talk about topics of in
terest to Stanford students, particularly
Asian Americans, said senior Jekit Lam,
organizer of the series and a resident assis
tant in Okada.
Yesterday, the series featured Matt
Fong, California's highest-ranking Asian-
American elected official, who challenged

all Stanford students to assert themselves
in politics.
"The debt in California is not going to be
paid by people over 50, but rather by people
of your generation," said Fong, vice chair
man of the State Board of Equalization
and Republican candidate for state trea
surer. "The bottom line is that all public
policy will have an impact on your life."
Fong was the third of six speakers in the
series, which will continue until election
day.
"The purpose is to showcase Asian
Americans involved in politics and also to
encourage Asian Americans that are inter
ested to get involved," Lam said.
