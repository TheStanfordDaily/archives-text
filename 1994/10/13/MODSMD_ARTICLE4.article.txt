# New speaker series brings Asian politicians to Farm
## 
### Megan Himan Staff writer 
As election day approaches, an unlikely
coalition of Asian-American, public service
and conservative student groups has
formed to sponsor a speaker series about
Asian Americans in politics.
The "Asians in Politics '94" series is an
attempt to bring speakers from both major
political parties to talk about topics of in
terest to Stanford students, particularly
Asian Americans, said senior Jekit Lam,
organizer of the series and a resident assis
tant in Okada.
Yesterday, the series featured Matt
Fong, California's highest-ranking Asian-
American elected official, who challenged

all Stanford students to assert themselves
in politics.
"The debt in California is not going to be
paid by people over 50, but rather by people
of your generation," said Fong, vice chair
man of the State Board of Equalization
and Republican candidate for state trea
surer. "The bottom line is that all public
policy will have an impact on your life."
Fong was the third of six speakers in the
series, which will continue until election
day.
"The purpose is to showcase Asian
Americans involved in politics and also to
encourage Asian Americans that are inter
ested to get involved," Lam said.
In addition, the series is a way
to encourage voter turnout
among Asian Americans, Lam
said. "Nationally only one-third
of Asian Americans vote," he
noted.
The Stanford College Republi
cans, The Stanford Review, the
Asian-American Activities Center
and the Haas Center for Public
Service sponsored Fong's speech
and a lecture Tuesday by Dr. Glo
ria Horn, chairwoman of the
Santa Clara County Republican
Party. The College Republicans
and the Review will not, however,
sponsor Democratic-focused
series events scheduled for the
next few weeks.
Aman Verjee, editor in chief of
The Stanford Review, said that
the Review was not endorsing

Fong, "but we will do anything to
make him heard," he added.
"With the election coming up
we are interested in sponsoring as
much debate as possible," Verjee
said.
Fong spent most of the lecture
discussing his political platform,
but also addressed his work
toward political and economic
empowerment of minorities.
He discussed the political
strength of Asian Americans at
local levels, such as school boards,
and said that it was his responsi
bility to "help pull others up."
Students questioned Fong
about his opinions on California
Proposition 187, the controver
sial measure that aims to deny
public services to illegal immi
grants.
"It is a symbolic message that
the problem needs to be fixed,"
Fong said. "We need more leader
ship in trying to crack down on
illegal immigration."

But he said he is also con
cerned that the measure could be
used to justify discrimination.
"Proposition 187 in its best light
is trying to focus on those who are
here illegally, and in its worst
light could promote discrimina
tion against those people of Asian
or Mexican descent."
The federal government
should give California funds to
tighten borders and deal with ille
gal immigrants in the state, Fong
added. "Fiscally, illegal immigra
tion is a significant problem to
any border state," he said. "States
are being asked to pay for what I
consider foreign aid."
One student also asked Fong
what he thinks of the campus
movement for an Asian-American
Studies major.
"It is important to address cul
tural issues," Fong said, "but I
am concerned that we might be
moving away from the core skills
that students need in the future."
