# Ed Wood holds fast: It's the story, stupid

### 
Direct the worst films in all of Ameri
can cinematic history and what happens
to you? Hollywood recreates your life on
the silver screen.
Producer/director Tim Burton's latest
filmatic endeavor docs just that. "Ed
Wood" delves into the relatively un
known public and curious private life of
the inept horror flick director with a ten
derness and understanding usually re
served for mainstream heroes and mar
tyrs.
Though the real Wood continually
sailed against the wind, producing flop
after flop and eventually sinking into an
nagging alcohol habit until he died at age
53, the story not only depicts Wood as
emotionally resilient but as an immense
ly idealistic visionary.

Ed Wood

Burton directs actor Johnny Depp as a
bright-eyed, Beaver Cleaver-like Wood so
he comes across like the crappy actors in
his films. Even so, the portrayal only un
derscores the filmmaker's perception of
Wood as an unwavering idealist; one who
puts the purity of the big picture before all
else. So what if a set looks fake or a se
quence of scenes are shot inconsistently?
It's the story, stupid.
Wood's heart comes across most
strongly in one of the film's subplots
which depicts the relationship between
Wood and the down-and-out, veteran
actor Bela Lugosi (Martin Landau). We
see Wood struggling harder to create act
ing opportunities for the drug-addicted
Lugosi than to follow his own movie
making dreams.
In what leads into the film's most
poignant scene, Wood adds a section of
dialogue to one of his films especially for
his aging, sickly star. Hardly subtle, yet ef
fective nonetheless, the short confession
from the villain (played by Lugosi) paral
lels what Lugosi himself wishes he could
scream to an oblivious Hollywood.
Though 74 years old and strung out on
morphine, Lugosi still has what it takes —
a mastery of form and the ability to move
an audience. Landau brilliantly resurrects
Lugosi's last great moment in a resound
ing baritone fluttering near the edge of
emotional breakdown.
Scenes like this litter "Ed Wood,"
demonstrating the filmmakers' fascina
tion with Wood's legacy. After experienc
ing Burton's vision of Wood, one can't
help but leave the theater with a smile.
