## First dates devastate in Noonan's world 
### 
She is a secretary in a law firm, but writes chil
dren stories on weekends as a hobby. He is a co
worker who, unlike his fellow paralegals, goes to
the office in a suit. They get along amiably
enough; then one day, she invites him home for
dinner.
One can imagine that a 90-minute movie

What Happened Was ...

which is edited more-or-less in real time and
never leaves a Manhattan studio apartment is not
going to qualify as Hollywood's bet for the sum
mer box-office sweepstakes.
In fact, for almost half of "What happened was
... ," it appeared equally baffling how this inde
pendently-made film could have been the toast of
Sundance Film Festival early this year, where it
won the Grand Jury prize.
At best, the movie's awkward-first-date sce
nario could barely pass for a second-rate Woody
Allen-esque exercise in New Yorker neurosis,
with a mildly amusing case of intellectual dispar
ity thrown in, and a loud clash of dietary palates
— "1 just don't like the word seafood." — to
match.
However, just when the smut; condescension

of Michael, the Har
vard-educated para
legal played by
writer-director Tom
Noonan, toward the
working-class born

and bred Jackie (Karen Sillas) begins to
grate on the viewer's sensibility, the script takes a
sharp turn into a realm of humanity more sober
ing than anything Hollywood can hope to come
up with.
Appropriately enough, it is Jackie who turns
the tables on Michael. Revealing her secret pen
chant for creating gothic "children's" tales of in
cestuous cannibalism, Jackie forces Michael to
confront his own holier-than-thou facade of
anti-establishment intellectualism.
Noonan also places his characters squarely in
their milieu: the on-screen images frequently cut
away from the couple to zoom right past the win
dows of neighboring apartments, in which televi
sion sets are perpetually tuned into pornography
or violence.
If it is the sheer density of Manhattan's
cityscape that ironically degrades interpersonal
intimacy — neither Jackie nor Michael is capable
of sustaining a decent dinner conversation —
and compels individuals to cage themselves into
involuntary solitude, there are few other visions
of human alienation laid bare so brutally as Noo
nan's.
Detractors who accuse the film of excessive
theatricality have obviously missed the point —
Noonan's camera contrives to unearth extraordi
nary insights about ordinary people in extreme
close-up. Theatrical or otherwise, the end results
are indisputably devastating.
