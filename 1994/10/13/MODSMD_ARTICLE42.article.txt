# Seeking soulmates Chemistry, destiny unite in 'Only You'
## 
### 
"Life's not like it is in the movies, is it?" Faith
Corvatch (Marisa Tomei) grumbles to her sister-in
law Kate (Bonnie Hunt).
It is just days before her safe, practical marriage
to a nice-but-boring podiatrist. Faith, the hopeless
romantic, is just beginning to realize that life is

Only You

rarely about true love and happily-ever-afters. Kate,
whose own marriage is in shambles, commiserates
with Faith with a tearful, knowing look in her eye.
But then, surprise, Faith receives a phone call from
her fiance's old school buddy, Damon Bradley who is
on his way to Italy. Faith is stunned — Damon Bradley.

Though Faith has never met the man

she recognizes the name as
the one that a fortune teller

had said belonged to

her "soul mate.'

Damon

Bradley,
Faith, with
Kate in

tow, set
off for

Italy, where "people come to find what they can't find
anyplace else." As she combs the streets of Rome for
Damon Bradley, Faith bumps into Mr. Right, or more
precisely, Mr. Peter Wright (Robert Downey Jr.).
Another firm believer in fate, Peter is convinced
that Faith is the woman meant for him. Boyish and
utterly charming, Downey's Peter is willing to use
any means and to go to whatever lengths necessary
to get Faith to fall in love with him. Unfortunately,
Faith remains equally convinced that Damon is her
destiny and spurns Peter's advances. "1 can't believe
that you'd let a few letters of the alphabet keep us
apart," Peter argues exasperatedly about his name.
Perfectly cast as the star-crossed lovers, Tomei
and Downey's chemistry lights up the screen. For
Downey, "Only You" is familiar territory; the film is

similar to his other magical,
romantic comedies, such as
"Heart and Souls" and
"Chances Are." Tomei also
displays a great feel for com
edy, and the screenplay
showcases her abundant nat
ural charm.
At once sweet and funny,
"Only You" is definitely a
heart-warming movie. Go

see it — maybe you'll
meet the one you're des
tined for in the popcorn
line.
