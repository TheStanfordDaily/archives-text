# Backwards-looking 'Strategem' won't turn heads, big or otherwise
## 
### 
Remember back in the eighties when new
music was so hopeless and unexciting that
classic rock all of the sudden got really big?
For a while, you couldn't turn on MTV
without the Monkees confronting you in
mid-sixties technicolor, "Rolling Stone" fea
tured ecstatic blurbs on the new Joe Cocker
album. The Who's reunion tour took a
strangle hold on pop culture and we all kind
of forgot where we were for awhile.

"Strategem"
Big Head Todd and . *
the Monsters * *

The nineties, though, have taken the "al
ternative" out of music that would have
seemed downright deviant eight years ago.
Vet the influence of classic rock has not
disappeared. A growing tension in modern
music between H.0.R.D.E.-esque groove
and I.ollapaloo/a-esque thrash splits bands
into separate camps with only hints of com
mon ground in between.
Big 1 lead Todd and the Monsters, howev
er, did find something in the middle with
last year's Gold album, "Sister Sweetly."
Songs like "Broken Hearted Savior" and
"Circle" strung groove licks along a ragged
guitar edge and came out sounding like a hy
pertensioned Blues Traveler without the
harmonica.

There was something up to date in the
catchiness of those songs, something that
funked and grooved and hit really hard all at
the same time.
The band's new release, "Strategem," falls

back some though, sounding retrospective,
cliched and nowhere near as good.
"Kensington Line," the first track on the
album, sets the tone. "I work on a wreckin'
wall / lust off the liquor tracks" Mohr

twangs shamelessly. It's a rowdy truck stop
anthem all the way through, and with it, Big
I lead Todd leaves behind its swooning alter
na-pop demographic. Hard to go Gold with
an album that begins with the sound of a
revving Harley, guys.
It's not that Harleys are bad; it's just that
this raunchy country sound is something
we've all heard before. Listen past the first
track and more cliches abound. "Wearing
Only Flowers," sounds like a Allman Broth
er's cover song. Not a good thing.
The catchy songs on "Strategem," and
there are a few, come off as somewhat grati
fying, but exude short shelf lives. "Magdeli
na" is a pretty, languid piece that nonethe
less comes across as hollow and lifeless.
"In the Morning," the first single, and a
sure-fire hit, does grab your attention, but
after a few trials starts to sound suspiciously
like a cross-between the Spin Doctors and
Gin Blossoms. Pop 101, anyone?
"Strategem" is not, however, without its
one unqualified winner. "Candle 99"
doesn't sound at all derivative, and its
smart, syncopated rhythm recalls the best of
"Sister Sweetly." The song is multi-layered,
complex, and infinitely catchy. Best of all,
the humming, messy guitar in the back
ground makes it feel up to date. Just the
thing this relentlessly backwards-looking
album needs.
