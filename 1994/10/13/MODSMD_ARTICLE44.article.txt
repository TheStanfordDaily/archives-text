obtrusive post-feminist dance music.
Or something to that effect.
Luscious Jackson consists of tour
cool girls who just kind of groove out
without the fanfare of Hetties typically
found to populate the House and
Disko circles. Finally, cool girl artists

dance music
that speaks of

tops, hot pants,
and "Kiss me
you fool!"
I do not
mean to imply
that Luscious
Jackson's debut
album "Natur
al Ingredients"
has a definitive
commitment
to any sort of

"anti-Betty position." These Supert
reak girls, as they call themselves, en
compass a lot of different angles.
Luscious compositions blend 70 s
lounge and punk-funk which makes
one ponder or nod in agreement (as
the case may be) to the lyrics, as well
as move one's body.
A little dose of sexual politics
comes out in "Strongman" — "It
takes a strong man to stand by a
strong woman'' — while a vignette of
sorts describes living in NYC' in
"Citvsong" — "I'm about to go crazy
'cause I'm still living here ... 'cause
this city tells me what it is like to live."
Some critics have ventured to call
Luscious Jackson "Beastie Ciirls"
when describing the Grand Roval-ly
sponsored group (whose drummer
Kate Schellenbach played with the B-
Boys during their Polywagdays). True
enough, both the Beasties and Lus
cious have made cross-breeding punk
and funk their main priorities.
Yet, the connection stops there.
While Luscious does slip a Curtis
Mayfield sample here and there, they
rely less on crafty mixing compared to
their fellow Beasties. 1 hey wax a style
that seems to be more a product of
basement jams than studio sampling.
With Luscious Jackson, you defi
nitely get the impression that these
Superfreaks work it from the source...
I guess that's why they call their
album "Natural Ingredients."
