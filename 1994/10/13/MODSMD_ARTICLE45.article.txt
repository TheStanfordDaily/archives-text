# 2Pac goes lower than low

When Public Knemy took rappers to task for
"talkin' that gangsta shit" and asked "which side
are you on?" in their latest album, "Muse-Sick-N-
Hour-Mess-Age," they didn't name names.
Chanting "gangs, drugs, guns and money" as a
subliminal rhythm, the group left listeners to pick
out the perpetrators from an extended line up.
With the release of "Thug I ife," there can be
no doubt as to where 2Pac is aligned. I lis newly
formed group on "Out Da Gutta'/Interscope
Records, also named "Thug Life," consists of

"Thug Life''
2Pac
*

Syke, Macadosis, The Rated Rand Mopreme,
2Pac's elder brother by four years. Together they
produce boring music and create an internally
repetitive vision of life in the ghetto.
It wasn't so long ago that 2Pac made a hit sin
gle while consoling black women to keep their
heads up. On "Thug Life," however, he just
doesn't love them hoes. In the first and best track
of the album, "Bury Me a C •," 2Pac sings, "I ain't
got time for bitches/gotta keep my mind on my
muthafuckin' riches/and even when I die they
won't worry me/mama don't cry bury me a G."
1 le's simply too hard for us.
And when 2Pac says he doesn't have time, he's
really not kidding. Singing about sex with some
random woman, he goes even further. "I tuckin
get up, I'll let you know/I'll be a ten minute broth-

er for a two dollar ho." That's
sad, because 2Pac's metallic
baritone and the lulling loop

from the Iscly Brothers' "For the Love of You" re
ally hook the song up. It's one of the few songs on
"Thug Life" that you could actually nod to.
2l'ac seems to have reached an all time low
where both his music and his messages are con
cerned. His legal woes, which include getting
sued for assaulting director Allen I lughes ("Men
ace II Society"), a concealed weapons charge and
a sodomy and sex abuse indictment, seemed to
have atrophied his lyrical imagination to the
point where fake-ass niggas and Real G's sipping
their gin and sucking on blunts are the only vi
sions that fit.
Indeed "Thug Life," takes an entire CD to es
tablish just how hard they are. In "Don't Get it
Twisted," Mopreme raps, "I'm feel in' like a
muthafuckin' psychopath/and if you got beat
best leave it in the freezer/'cause Mopreme is
straight loc and you could get smoked." These de
clarations turn into a joke when you remember,
Mopreme's rap debut on Toni Tony Tone pop sin
gle "It Feels Good."
Musically, the CD is passable, but nothing to
get excited about. The album falls away after the
first track and doesn't pick up again until the sev
enth or eighth song.
by "Under Pressure," we have died and been
reborn more times than a cat. The rest of the
album goes down a little more smoothly. As
"Thug I.ife," reacquaints themselves with the
musical concepts of groove and flow, the tracks
pick up momentum and we get something one
could possibly ride to.
Unfortunately for this CD, it's too little much
too late.
