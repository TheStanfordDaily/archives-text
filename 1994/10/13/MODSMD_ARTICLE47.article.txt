Barcelona
Whit Stillman's new film "Barcelona"
benefits from not only the witty
repartee of two American cousins
but also the cultural richness of the
Catalan capital, Barcelona. Stillman,
director of "Metropolitan" which was
set in New York City, utilizes intellec
tual banter to create a brilliant come
dy.
The Cathedral of the old city serves
as a backdrop along with brightly lit
boulevards replete with "Trade Fair
girls" for two American cousins.
One, Fred, an ROTC Navy man, and
the other Ted, a sincere and ardent
yuppie obsessed with the culture of
sales, embark on a quest for ro
mance.
Fred may seem boorish and Ted in
sufferable, yet it is worth it to tag

along with them on their adventures
through "Barcelona." Stillman's
cerebral comedy perhaps mirrors
his own search. He married a
woman from Barcelona and his two
daughters were born there.
Blue Sky
She a nympho, he's a nerd. Togeth
er, what are they? A married couple
who, between the two of them,
cause more controversy on the mili
tary bases they've inhabited than
the ongoing push for a nuclear-test
ing ban.
Academy award-winning actor
Tommy Lee Jones stars in "Blue
Sky" as nuclear physicist Hank, a
lone rescuer manning a sinking
lifeboat and tossing innertubes to
drowning blind men. As a
soldier/scientist responsible for
measuring radiation levels at U.S.
Army nuclear test sites during the
heat of the Cold War, Hank gets
shuttled from base to base each
time he writes an honest report de
tailing dangerous practices.
With crazy characters and several
dangling subplots, "Blue Sky" tugs
the audience's attention just enough
to keep people in the theater. Yet
Rama Laurie Stagner and her co
writers seem to have tossed in more
conflicts than they can resolve.
Overall, it's not worth the price of ad
mission.
Clear and Present Danger
Harrison Ford's newest movie,
"Clear and Present Danger" is yet
another ill-fated attempt to put Tom
Clancy's best-selling novels on
screen. The movie recounts the ad
ventures of Jack Ryan, acting CIA
Director, played by Ford in a contin
uation of his role in "Patriot Games."
The failures of this blockbuster

movie follow Ford to Clancy's
newest cinematic attempt. A poor
script and poor and obvious camera
work plague this otherwise intrigu
ing flick.
"Clear and Present Danger" does
abound in shining comic moments.
Indeed, there are enough killer one
liners to fill an HBO special. One lin
ers, however, do not a movie make.
Neither does an outstanding star.
Though seven bucks would be a
waste, "Clear and Present Danger"
makes a great matinee.
Jason's Lyric
"Jason's Lyric" is like a cheap box of
chocolates.
It looks really good on the surface,
but when you take a bite it's not as
good as you thought.
The film climaxes with a violent,
powerful encounter, complete with
automatic weapons, more sex and
your standard massacre. To give
credit where it's due, though, the di
rection of Doug McHenry in this
scene is outstanding.
The problem is that the film as a
whole does not come together.
While the violent world of teens
growing up in a ghetto is accurately
and emotionally portrayed, the
strengths of the film are dragged too
far down by the stomach-churning
love story, which only leaves us with
a bad taste in our mouths.
Quiz Show
Following in the footsteps of Oliver
Stone's "Natural Born Killers," Quiz
Show also examines the power of
the media. While Quiz Show doesn't
rally the American public behind vi
cious mass-murderers, it does rap
the knuckles of the manipulative
hands of network television execu
tives.

The film recreates many of the actu
al events that entwined the lives of
Stempel (played by John Turturro),
Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes)
and Richard Goodwin (Rob Morrow)
in the late 1950'5.
"Twenty-One," NBC's weekly quiz
show, was investigated in 1959 by a
grand jury for fraud, after which its
findings were sealed by a judge.
Goodwin, intrigued by this, began
his own investigation for the Con
gressional Subcommittee on Leg
islative Oversight, hoping to expose
the ways in which networks de
ceived the public.
The film attempts to focus on the be
hind-the-scenes manipulation of
Twenty-One's producer Dan Enright
(David Paymer) Enright, driven by
the power of advertising dollars and
the need to compete with other
shows, gives millions of people a
"friend" in Van Doren, someone
they can watch and cheer along with
in their own homes.
River Wild
There's nothing like a good, not-so
old-fashioned heroine.
Gail qualifies. She's far from the
weeping victim common to so many
action flicks, the ones who dangle
off mountains and wait for some dar
ing He-man to come rescue them,
who touch the side of their eyes with
a handkerchief when dastardly vil
lains have them in their sights.
Instead, Meryl Streep's Gail is
strong — so strong that she's the
one who paddles when she takes
her son and sort-of-nerdy, worka
holic husband rafting through a
treacherous "River Wild."
In"The River Wild," it's Streep's
character and her innate chemistry
with son Roarke (Joseph Mazzello,
best known for facing down the di-

nosaurs in "Jurassic Park") that
carry the film. When her son accus
es her of taking sides with Dad
against him, Gail matter-of-factly
replies, "I'm not on anybody's side.
I'm on everybody's side. I'm a moth
er." One lesson to be learned is that
the lighter the boat, the more likely it
is to survive the treacherous waters.
If that lesson is applied to film,
maybe the lack of plot is fortunate.
Certainly the strength of Streep's
performance is more than enough
to keep the boat from sinking.
Sleep With Me
While "Reality Bites" and "Three
some" veer perilously close at times
to overly self-conscious MTV aes
thetics, this latest exercise in Gener
ation X-angst and indecision is un
afraid to parade protagonists who
are equally sawy in making conver
sation as they are at coordinating
wardrobes. In other words, Eric
Stolz, Meg Tilly and Craig Sheffer are
good enough such that "Sleep With
Me" avoids coming across as an un
intended spoof of "The Real World."
Indeed, their characters negotiate
the treacherous tightrope stretched
between friendship and love with as
much abandon and anxiety as those
of us who are honest enough to
admit it.
Brimming with offbeat pleasures like
its claim to love being little but a
poker game — "In the end, you can
be left with nothing" — and the un
contrived use of quirky inter-titles to
mark its narrative milestones, the
movie articulates the pitfalls of post
modern passion with unbridled vi
vacity. Its somewhat-titillating title
notwithstanding, "Sleep With Me"
extends an invitation that would be a
shame to refuse.

movie follow Ford to Clancy's
newest cinematic attempt. A poor
script and poor and obvious camera
work plague this otherwise intrigu
ing flick.
"Clear and Present Danger" does
abound in shining comic moments.
Indeed, there are enough killer one
liners to fill an HBO special. One lin
ers, however, do not a movie make.
Neither does an outstanding star.
Though seven bucks would be a
waste, "Clear and Present Danger"
makes a great matinee.
Jason's Lyric
"Jason's Lyric" is like a cheap box of
chocolates.
It looks really good on the surface,
but when you take a bite it's not as
good as you thought.
The film climaxes with a violent,
powerful encounter, complete with
automatic weapons, more sex and
your standard massacre. To give
credit where it's due, though, the di
rection of Doug McHenry in this
scene is outstanding.
The problem is that the film as a
whole does not come together.
While the violent world of teens
growing up in a ghetto is accurately
and emotionally portrayed, the
strengths of the film are dragged too
far down by the stomach-churning
love story, which only leaves us with
a bad taste in our mouths.
Quiz Show
Following in the footsteps of Oliver
Stone's "Natural Born Killers," Quiz
Show also examines the power of
the media. While Quiz Show doesn't
rally the American public behind vi
cious mass-murderers, it does rap
the knuckles of the manipulative
hands of network television execu
tives.

The film recreates many of the actu
al events that entwined the lives of
Stempel (played by John Turturro),
Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes)
and Richard Goodwin (Rob Morrow)
in the late 1950'5.
"Twenty-One," NBC's weekly quiz
show, was investigated in 1959 by a
grand jury for fraud, after which its
findings were sealed by a judge.
Goodwin, intrigued by this, began
his own investigation for the Con
gressional Subcommittee on Leg
islative Oversight, hoping to expose
the ways in which networks de
ceived the public.
The film attempts to focus on the be
hind-the-scenes manipulation of
Twenty-One's producer Dan Enright
(David Paymer) Enright, driven by
the power of advertising dollars and
the need to compete with other
shows, gives millions of people a
"friend" in Van Doren, someone
they can watch and cheer along with
in their own homes.
River Wild
There's nothing like a good, not-so
old-fashioned heroine.
Gail qualifies. She's far from the
weeping victim common to so many
action flicks, the ones who dangle
off mountains and wait for some dar
ing He-man to come rescue them,
who touch the side of their eyes with
a handkerchief when dastardly vil
lains have them in their sights.
Instead, Meryl Streep's Gail is
strong — so strong that she's the
one who paddles when she takes
her son and sort-of-nerdy, worka
holic husband rafting through a
treacherous "River Wild."
In"The River Wild," it's Streep's
character and her innate chemistry
with son Roarke (Joseph Mazzello,
best known for facing down the di-

nosaurs in "Jurassic Park") that
carry the film. When her son accus
es her of taking sides with Dad
against him, Gail matter-of-factly
replies, "I'm not on anybody's side.
I'm on everybody's side. I'm a moth
er." One lesson to be learned is that
the lighter the boat, the more likely it
is to survive the treacherous waters.
If that lesson is applied to film,
maybe the lack of plot is fortunate.
Certainly the strength of Streep's
performance is more than enough
to keep the boat from sinking.
Sleep With Me
While "Reality Bites" and "Three
some" veer perilously close at times
to overly self-conscious MTV aes
thetics, this latest exercise in Gener
ation X-angst and indecision is un
afraid to parade protagonists who
are equally sawy in making conver
sation as they are at coordinating
wardrobes. In other words, Eric
Stolz, Meg Tilly and Craig Sheffer are
good enough such that "Sleep With
Me" avoids coming across as an un
intended spoof of "The Real World."
Indeed, their characters negotiate
the treacherous tightrope stretched
between friendship and love with as
much abandon and anxiety as those
of us who are honest enough to
admit it.
Brimming with offbeat pleasures like
its claim to love being little but a
poker game — "In the end, you can
be left with nothing" — and the un
contrived use of quirky inter-titles to
mark its narrative milestones, the
movie articulates the pitfalls of post
modern passion with unbridled vi
vacity. Its somewhat-titillating title
notwithstanding, "Sleep With Me"
extends an invitation that would be a
shame to refuse.
Barcelona
Whit Stillman's new film "Barcelona"
benefits from not only the witty
repartee of two American cousins
but also the cultural richness of the
Catalan capital, Barcelona. Stillman,
director of "Metropolitan" which was
set in New York City, utilizes intellec
tual banter to create a brilliant come
dy.
The Cathedral of the old city serves
as a backdrop along with brightly lit
boulevards replete with "Trade Fair
girls" for two American cousins.
One, Fred, an ROTC Navy man, and
the other Ted, a sincere and ardent
yuppie obsessed with the culture of
sales, embark on a quest for ro
mance.
Fred may seem boorish and Ted in
sufferable, yet it is worth it to tag

along with them on their adventures
through "Barcelona." Stillman's
cerebral comedy perhaps mirrors
his own search. He married a
woman from Barcelona and his two
daughters were born there.
Blue Sky
She a nympho, he's a nerd. Togeth
er, what are they? A married couple
who, between the two of them,
cause more controversy on the mili
tary bases they've inhabited than
the ongoing push for a nuclear-test
ing ban.
Academy award-winning actor
Tommy Lee Jones stars in "Blue
Sky" as nuclear physicist Hank, a
lone rescuer manning a sinking
lifeboat and tossing innertubes to
drowning blind men. As a
soldier/scientist responsible for
measuring radiation levels at U.S.
Army nuclear test sites during the
heat of the Cold War, Hank gets
shuttled from base to base each
time he writes an honest report de
tailing dangerous practices.
With crazy characters and several
dangling subplots, "Blue Sky" tugs
the audience's attention just enough
to keep people in the theater. Yet
Rama Laurie Stagner and her co
writers seem to have tossed in more
conflicts than they can resolve.
Overall, it's not worth the price of ad
mission.
Clear and Present Danger
Harrison Ford's newest movie,
"Clear and Present Danger" is yet
another ill-fated attempt to put Tom
Clancy's best-selling novels on
screen. The movie recounts the ad
ventures of Jack Ryan, acting CIA
Director, played by Ford in a contin
uation of his role in "Patriot Games."
The failures of this blockbuster

movie follow Ford to Clancy's
newest cinematic attempt. A poor
script and poor and obvious camera
work plague this otherwise intrigu
ing flick.
