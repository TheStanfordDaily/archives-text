■ If you haven't seen it yet, it's time to make
amends. If you have seen it, relive the journey
and see it again. The quintessential road flick,
"Easy Rider," starring Dennis Hopper, Peter

Fonda and Jack Nicholson, remains timely
and applicable even twenty-five years after its
production, due to the inevitable feelings of
alienation and angst that we, the members of
Generation X, must feel. "Easy Rider" is playing
through Oct. 15 at the Red Vic, located at 1727
Haight St.in S.F. Call 668-3994 for more informa
tion.
FRI/14
■ Enjoy the exploration of love and death
through the avant-garde theatrical mono
logues of Sam Shepard and Joseph Chaikln's
works: "Savage/ Love" and "Tongues." Both
the content and the performance itself are beau
tiful and subtle, and the actors do a fine job in
bringing out the mysterious and elusive ele
ments of both works. "Savage/ Love" and
"Tongues" will be at the Magic Theatre at Fort
Mason, Bldg. D, at the corner of Laguna and Ma
rina in S.F. until Oct. 16. Performances are at
8:30 p.m. except for Sunday, when they are at 2

■ And you always wondered why movies tend to
portray muted versions of reality. The Stanford
Theatre presents a series of films including
"The Public Enemy", a James Cagney and Mae
Clarke flick that was produced before Warner
Bros.' 1934 Production Code. The Code was an
industry-wide system of self-censorship that was in
stituted due to the racy and often outrageous con
tent of films made in the decade before. Hence,
The Public Enemy" and others contain material
that shocked both contemporary and modem audi
ences. The series of films will run until Oct. 28, but
"The Public Enemy" will only be shown until Oct.
18. The Stanford Theatre is located at 221 Universi
ty Ave. Call 324-3700 for more information.

Theater at 2180 Bryant St.in S.F. The show starts
