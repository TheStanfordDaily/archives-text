# A 						new transplant program
## Stanford joins SF hospital in starting project 
### Allison Short Staff writer 
California Pacific Medical Center
(CPMC), a leading San Francisco hospital,
has agreed to combine resources with
Stanford University Hospital and the Lu
cile Salter Packard Children's Hospital to
create an extensive new liver and kidney
transplant program at Stanford.
Plans to create the program were final
ized this week, and the University will as
sume control of the transplant program by
the end of this year.
According to the agreement signed Oct.
10, Stanford will run the pediatric kidney
transplant program for the three hospi
tals, as well as the adult and pediatric liver
transplant programs.

Adult kidney, heart and other organ
transplants will continue to be managed
individually at CPMC and Stanford Hospi
tal.
"Stanford is a wonderful institution
with a medical environment particularly
well-suited with research to support these
programs," said CPMC's Dr. Oscar Sal
vatierra, who will direct the pediatric kid
ney transplant program at Stanford.
Ten physicians from the CPMC liver
and kidney transplant program will be
come employees at Stanford.
Salvatierra said all three hospitals will
benefit from the collaboration.
The move "complements our research
facilities. Significant changes will result
from our research. Everyone at the Uni-
versity is quite pleased," said
Peter Van Etten, chief executive
officer of Stanford Health Ser
vices, the management body that
oversees Stanford's hospital net
work.
Salvatierra added that CPMC's
capabilities will also be enhanced
by Stanford's research facilities
and information.
Financial concerns may have
contributed to the decision to
share facilities. CPMC lost
approximately $3 million last
summer. And Stanford is also
working to provide more efficient
health care services to its
patients.
Salvatierra said all the doctors
from CPMC were pleased with
the move and excited with the
research questions it might help

It must have been a
significant issue to
lead them to choose
Stanford.'

them answer.
In particular, he added that he
and his colleagues want to "work
out a way to best assure us the
best survival rate in the chil
dren."
Van Etten said he and other
employees at the Stanford Hospi
tal also share Salvatierra's enthu
siasm and are honored to have
such extensive research and
transplants taking place on their
facilities.
"Liver transplants require
enormous resources," Van Etten

said. "It must have been a signifi
cant issue to lead them to choosc
Stanford." He added that the
Medical Center was chosen
because of its excellent research
facilities.
The new program "will cer
tainly be the leading transplant
program on the West coast, if not
in the country," Salvatierra said.
Directing the combined liver
and kidney transplant programs
will be Dr. Donald Dafoe, cur
rently a professor of surgery and
director of the Multi-Organ
Transplant Program at Stan
ford. Dr. Carlos Esquivel, direc
tor of the CPMC liver trans
plant program, will head the
liver transplant program at
Stanford, along with his CPMC
colleague Dr. Kenneth Cox, a
pediatric gastroenterologist.
Salvatierra and CPMC physi
cian Dr. Susan Conley will
direct the pediatric kidney
transplant program at Stanford.
