## Group to play MemAud next month 
### Neha Gupta 
In yet another attempt to bring big-name music
groups to Stanford, the Stanford Concert Network has
finalized a concert date with the alternative group
Jesus & Mary Chain.
Mazzy Star will join the group for a performance on
Nov. 21 in Memorial Auditorium.
The Stanford community will have the exclusive op
portunity to purchase tickets for one day, after which
the performance will be open to the general public.
Stanford tickets go on sale tomorrow morning at
Tresidder and will not be sold to the general public until
Bass Tickets opens on Saturday.
"We want students to get first priority at getting the
best seats, better than any of the general public can on
Saturday," said Michael Cohen, the Concert Network's
promotion manager.
The group will play at Memorial Auditorium — the
campus' biggest indoor facility — because the Concert
Network expects a large turnout, Cohen said. The audi
torium's 1,600 seats, however, mean a sell out might
not be possible. "We expect to sell well, but it's hard to
say," said Cohen. "We will be very pleased if students
respond well and buy a majority of the seats," he added.
Cohen said negotiations began last summer, contin
uing a "revival" that started last spring to bring big
name groups to campus. Shawn Colvin, the Cowboy
Junkies and They Might Be Giants performed at Stan
ford spring quarter.
The Concert Network is bringing the hip-hop group
De La Soul to campus to play Saturday at Dinklespiel
Auditorium. The organization has also booked some
Coffee House performances, including one by funk
group Aquarium Rescue Unit.
"We have people working here who are dedicated to
go after [the groupsl as complete professionals," Cohen
said. "We want the groups to think of us as another pro
moter, not a bunch of college kids."
Tickets are $17.50 for students and $19.50 for the
general public, Cohen said.
Once details for the Jesus & Mary Chain show have
been settled, the Concert Network will start booking
groups for winter quarter.
