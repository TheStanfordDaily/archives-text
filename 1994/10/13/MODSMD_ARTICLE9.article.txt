# Homecoming to bring 4,700 alums back to school
## 
### Elizabeth Goldman 
More than 4,700 alumni from 10 Stan
ford classes will flock back to campus this
weekend to attend the 1994 Stanford
Reunion Homecoming, which kicks off
tonight and continues through Sunday,
culminating with the Stanford Homecom
ing/Palo Alto Centennial Parade.
Activities will include lectures, speeches,
dinners and a keynote address by Supreme
Court Justice Stephen Breyer.
The annual "All Right Now" parade
holds special significance this year, said
Cindy Pearson, director of classes for the
Alumni Association, since the event began
as part of Stanford's Centennial in 1991
and will conclude Palo Alto's own 100 th
year celebration.
A number of Stanford and Palo Alto
groups will participate, and registration is
still open, Pearson said.
Another highlight of this year's weekend
is the record number of alumni attending
their 50th year reunion. More members of
the Class of 1944 have registered than from
any other 50th reunion class on record,
Pearson said.
Though the weekend draws thousands

of alumni to campus, most events — such
as the keynote address — are also open to
current students.
Supreme Court Justice Stephen G.
Breyer, a 1959 Stanford graduate, will give
the address at 11:30 a.m. Sunday morning
at Frost Amphitheater.
"We're absolutely delighted," Pearson
said about Breyer's appearance. "I think he
is exactly the kind of speaker we were hop
ing for."
Before the speech, University President
Gerhard Casper will lead a ceremonial com
mencement for the members of the Class of
1944 who were unable to attend graduation
because of their participation in World War 11.
The ceremony — which was performed
last year for the class of 1943 — is "really a
touching and special thing," Pearson said.
"It's just a way to honor them for service in
World War II."
A special interfaith memorial service for
alumni honoring fellow class members who
have died will also be held Sunday morning,
Pearson said.
Tonight's activities include a pre-dinner
speech for alumni by John Gardner, the
Miriam and Professor of Public Service in
the Graduate School of Business Peter

Haas, a Stanford graduate himself.
In addition, Hoover Fellow John Bunzel
will give his popular presentation of "A
Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the
Farm," which will be open to all in Memo
rial Auditorium.
Friday's events begin with a forum on
"Protecting Our Planet and People: The
Politics of Sharing the Earth" at 9 a.m. in
Frost Amphitheater.
Organizers arrived at the topic after dis
cussions with the School of Earth Sciences,
the graduate school that is being highlight
ed for this year's reunion weekend, Pear
son said.
Classes Without Quizzes, an event
which opens 50 classes to the alumni, will
be held Friday afternoon.
As part of an effort to involve the stu
dent body in the weekend, current sopho
mores will be on hand to introduce profes
sors, Pearson said.
"We're trying to get students more
involved in the program," she said. "Usual
ly homecomings are student-initiated and
student-run," Pearson explained. "At Stan
ford, we've kind of come at it from the
other end."
This year, she said, students are helping

with registration and driving some alumni
to events, as well as participating in several
programs.
On Saturday, members of this year's
reunion classes — classes ending in nine or
four, from 1944 to the present — will gath
er for tailgate parties before the homecom
ing football game against the University of
Southern California.
This year's senior class will participate,
too, in celebration of its "zero-year
reunion," Pearson said.
In another effort to get students involved,
sophomores are invited to return to their
freshman dorms for dinner Friday. "The
food service has been great in supporting
that," Pearson said. "They're making spe
cial dinners and they've been really flexible."
Also, Saturday at 11 a.m., alumni will be
able to attend an open house at the Arrilla
ga Family Sports Center, which was not
open for last year's reunion.
Sunday's events begin at 8 a.m. with the
Theta Breakers Stanford 1994 Homecom
ing Run. Proceeds will go to Child Advo
cates of Santa Clara and San Mateo coun
ties. This is the first year that the Alumni
Association has co-sponsored the run,
Pearson said.
