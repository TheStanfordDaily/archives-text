ADVANCED AEROBICS
Looking for a new challenge?
Learning to fly is no easy task. But
Stanford Flying Club makes it fun.
We'll take you all the way from your
first lesson to your pilot's license in no
time. Most Stanford students complete a
Solo Pilot LicenstTcourse with only
10-20 hours of flying time.
After that you might try one of our
advanced training or aerobatics
classes. And as a non-profit club, we
can get you flying for Tar cheaper than
vou might think: our aircraft rates are
15-35% less than Bay Area commercial
flight schools offer.
Call between 1:00-5:00 and ask Penny or an Instructor for more details.
