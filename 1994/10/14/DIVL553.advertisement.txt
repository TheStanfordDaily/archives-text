/ Hear a Symphony:
African Americans Celebrate Love
(Anchor Books, $27.95)
This powerful anthology explores the many dimensions of Black
love through a powerful combination of poetry, love letters, and
excerpts from speeches, essays, novels, and plays. Each of the
seven sections of the book focuses on a particular type of love: from
self-love to love of community; from love of family to romantic love.
These writings aire accented and complemented by a striking selec
tion of full-color works of African American art.
While speaking directly to the Black experience, I Hear a Symphony
communicates love in a way that can be universally understood. The
contents of this anthology will have you sighing, crying, and nod
ding in recognition.
