## ABC crews disrupt Branner residents 
### Rachel Marshak 
An ABC news crew illegally
filmed a segment in Branner earli
er this week, breaking University
policy and prompting Stanford to
demand an apology to Branner
and its residents.
The crew, filming for "Prime
time Live" about the University's
handling of a 1993 cheating scan
dal, was denied permission to tape
in Branner last Tuesday, but did
so anyway, according to Branner
Resident Fellow Kennell Jackson.
"I told them no," Jackson said.
"I never gave them permission to
come here."
University policy regularly al
lows news crews to film exterior
shots. However, permission is re
quired to film in classrooms or
dorms, said Assoc. Director of
Stanford News Service Jack Hub
bard.
"They came in (Branner) with
out permission and started shoot
ing," Hubbard said. "They were
asked not to do so and to leave, but
they did neither."
Branner Resident Assistant
Lauren Dekoven said when she en
tered the hallway the crew had not
started filming yet. "I asked them
to wait. I went to go find Kennell
(Jackson) and when I came back,
they had just finished filming.
"They knew they weren't sup
posed to be there," she added.
While filming, the camera crew
reportedly treated Branner stu
dents in a very impolite manner.
Freshman Brandon Morris said
that when the ABC reporters
came down the hall, "They said
rudely, 'Go into your rooms.' "
Freshman Sally Rosen added
that "they said we had to be quiet
and stay in our rooms. They told
us we couldn't be in the hallway."
According to Rosen, the crew
also fUmed — without her permis
sion — the door to her residence,
which displayed both her name
and home town.

Hubbard took a dim view of the
news crew's actions.
"It's the equivalent of coming
into someone's house with the
camera rolling. It's not appreciat
ed or allowed," he said. "[The
crew| violated their privacy."
As a result of their actions,
Hubbard demanded an apology
from the ABC team.
"I told them that they were out
of line and this was not to be done
again," he said. "I told them if
they didn't apologize then they
were gone."
Subsequently, the ABC pro

ducer apologized to Jackson, Hub
bard said.
"With crews we can never have
total control. Anyone can come in
and shoot without telling us —
local news crews do it all of the
time," Hubbard said. "There is a
certain element of trust. (The
ABC crew] was out of line."
Last Wednesday, the ABC
news crew was allowed to film
students in the lounge of Adams.
Adams Resident Fellow John Rick
said that in the process, they blew
out a circuit breaker by using too
many lights.
