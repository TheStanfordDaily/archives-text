## Iraq may recognize Kuwait Hussein attemps to diffuse tension in Persian Gulf 
### 
BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) — Saddam Hussein offered
early today to recognize Kuwait as a sovereign state
with the understanding it would lead to the United
Nations easing a stifling embargo after six months.
The proposal came in a statement issued after a
meeting between the Iraqi leader and Russian For
eign Minister Andrei Kozyrev, who arrived in Bagh
dad yesterday to try to defuse tensions between Iraq
and a U.S.-led coalition backing Kuwait.
Saddam's offer, broadcast early Friday in Iraq,
echoed one made by his U.N. ambassador on
Wednesday. The statement did not specify when
Baghdad would recognize Kuwait, which it has long
maintained was part of Iraq.
The 1991 Persian Gulf War cease-fire resolution
calls for lifting the oil embargo after Iraq had elimi
nated its weapons of mass destruction and a moni
toring program is in place to make sure Iraq doesn't
try to rebuild them.
U.N. weapons inspectors told the Security Coun
cil on Tuesday that the sophisticated monitoring
system was ready.
The Iraqi-Russian statement said Iraq "has
agreed to resolve the issue of Kuwait's sovereignty"

as the U.N. Security Council has demanded.
Once it does so, Russia said it would support acti
vating a six-month test period for the monitoring
system, the statement said. After that test period,
the Security Council should lift the sanctions on
Iraqi oil sales without any additional conditions.
There was no immediate comment on Saddam's
offer at the United Nations. Kozyrev was expected
to brief the Security Council next week on his meet
ing.
On Wednesday, Iraqi U.N. Ambassador Nizar
Hamdoon told The Associated Press Iraq would rec
ognize Kuwait "provided that Iraq gets assurances
that there will be a lifting of the (oil) sanctions with
in a short, clear-cut period."
France has also expressed support for a six
month probation period for Iraq once it recognizes
Kuwait's borders.
Both France and Russia had strong commercial
ties to Iraq in the past and recently have signed
lucrative trade pacts to become effective once sanc
tions are lifted. Iraq also owes billions of dollars to
cash-strapped Russia for arms purchases during the
1980-88 Iran-Iraq war.
