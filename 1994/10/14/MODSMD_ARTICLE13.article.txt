PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP)
— Haiti's former military ruler
arrived in exile in Panama yester
day looking weary, and asked
understanding for the hard times
he said he and his family are suf
fering.
Raoul Cedras was accompa
nied by Philippe Biamby, his chief
of staff and the No. 3 man in
Haiti's most recent military dicta
torship.
Many Panamanians opposed
the decision to take in Cedras, a
leader of the coup that toppled
Haiti's democratically elected
president and installed a brutal
three-year military rule. Opposi
tion politicians said Panama
risked becoming a "world class
garbage can" for tyrants and dic
tators.
"We say thank you to the pres
ident (of Panama) and to the

Panamanian people who receive
us," Cedras, flanked by family
members, said upon arrival at the
airport.
"We are a family that is pass
ing through very difficult times,"
he said in halting Spanish, adding
that he and his family sought
only peace and tranquillity.
Cedras, 45, had traded his
khaki military uniform for a dark
blue suit, and took no questions
after his brief statement. Biamby
made no comment.
The chartered jetliner carrying
the Haitians arrived at Tocumen
International Airport at 4:10 a.m.
(5:10 a.m. EDT) from Haiti.
Washington, the ousted
Haitian president Jean-Bertrand
Aristide and the Organization of
American States had urged Pana
ma to take in Cedras, who
resigned Monday.
