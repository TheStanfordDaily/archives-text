Japanese author wins Nobel Prize
STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) — Kenzaburo Oe, whose brain
damaged child became a primary symbol in his works showing the
dark side of postwar Japan, won the Nobel prize in literature yester
day.
Oe, 59, invented a vivid, almost assaultive writing style, a far
departure from traditional Japanese literary expression.
Among his most important works was the 1967 novel "The Silent
Cry," which deals with people's relationship in a world where
"knowledge, passions, dreams, ambitions and attitudes merge into
each other," the academy said.
Kenzaburo Oe (pronounced Ken-za-boo-roh OH-eh) is the second
Japanese writer to win the Nobel literature prize. In 1968, the
academy honored Yasunari Kawabata.
Oe said yesterday that he was heavily influenced by authors like
the playwright and novelist Kobo Abe and novelist Masuji Ibuse,
both of whom died last year.
Search for kidnapped soldier
GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) — Under intense pressure from
Israel and the United States, Palestinian police arrested more than

100 Islamic militants in a hunt through the Gaza Strip for a kid
napped Israeli soldier.
The unprecedented crackdown by 9,000 of PLO leader Yasser
Arafat's police was a major showdown with the fundamentalist
Hamas movement, which has sworn to wreck the Israel-PLO peace
process.
Hamas leaders angrily accused the Palestine Liberation Organi
zation of doing Israel's "dirty work" and threatened violence.
A leaflet issued yesterday by the group's underground military
wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, renewed the threat to kill
19-year-old Cpl. Nachshon Waxman if Israel did not release the
founder of Hamas and 200 other prisoners by 9 p.m. today.
"The soldier will be immediately executed a short while after the
deadline" if the imprisoned Palestinians, including Sheik Ahmed
Yassin, are not released, warned the leaflet sent to The Associated
Press.
The leaflet, addressed to Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin,
contradicted Israel's claim that the soldier was being held in Gaza,
saying he was in "an area you are occupying and not in a silly
autonomous one."
A videotape of Waxman released Wednesday showed the soldier
imploring Rabin to save his life by answering his captors' demands.
