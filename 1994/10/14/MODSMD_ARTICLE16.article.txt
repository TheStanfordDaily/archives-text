AS APPLICATION DEAD
LINES for jobs and summer
internships rapidly ap
proach, consider this:
You're applying for a job, an
internship or perhaps an academic
program abroad. You've dutifully
updated your resume, tailored
your cover letter and filled out all
the required forms.
But there's one slight problem.
The glowing letter of recommen
dation from your summer employ
er sits locked away in a room —
and can't be touched for another
(fill in any amount of time beyond
when the application is due).
It's an inconvenience that many
students must endure at the Career
Planning and Placement Center.
The CPPC offers students a
wonderful service that keeps let
ters of reference on file free of
charge until they are needed. This
system of storing letters can be
particularly convenient for depart
ing students because potential
employers often prefer confiden

tial letters and it is not always con
venient to ask a former employer
to send a recommendation directly.
However, the system can only be
utilized meaningfully by a small
portion of students — those who
are within three quarters of grad
uation. Other students may have
recommendations sent to the
CPPC, but their letters lie locked
away until they become eligible.
For many Stanford students who
new opportunities, broader aca
demic experiences or even a head
start in the job market, the cur
rent system can cramp their style.
Career-planning services like
the reference service should be
open to students in any stage of
their Stanford careers. If admin
istrative difficulties are a prob
lem, the CPPC could charge stu
dents not in their final year of
study a small fee to release a ref
erence letter.
After all, it's the little things
that make the biggest difference in
life.
