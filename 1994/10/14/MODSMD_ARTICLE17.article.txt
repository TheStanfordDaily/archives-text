# Science quad a boon
## 
### 
Good things don't
always come in small pack
ages.
This week, the University
received news that it would
become the beneficiary of a brand
new $110 million science and engi
neering quad.
The facility, made possible
mainly by a record $77.4 million
gift from alumni David Packard
and William Hewlett, will be a wel
come addition to campus and a
boon to Stanford's research and
teaching capabilities well into the
next century.
The demolition of four old build
ings, including the notorious
Physics Tank, may inspire senti
mental feelings in some. And the
construction of five new buildings
will mean a few years of displaced
classes and offices as well as plenty
of noise and the typical construc
tion clutter.

But the end product sounds like
it will be well worth the annoyance.
New classrooms with state-of-the
art technology and more innovative
uses can only provide students with
a better learning environment.
In addition, the five new build
ings, the Center for Integrated
Systems and the Gates Informa
tion Science Building will be closer
together, making collaboration
among researchers and sharing of
facilities all the more convenient.
Overall, the contribution from
longtime donors Hewlett and
Packard, stands to benefit both
"techies" and "fuzzies."
Without it, the aging laborato
ries, lecture halls and research facil
ities on the west side of the campus
would not have been replaced for
several more years. And while that
would not have been a tragic step
backward, the new buildings
ensure an exciting step ahead.
