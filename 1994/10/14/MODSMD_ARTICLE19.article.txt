# Friday Forum
## Ann Porteus Carving away at the Res Ed monolith 
### 
OVER TIME, Resi
dential Education
has been the
object of much comment
on this campus, from its
mission ("cramming
multiculturalism down
students' throats," "the
Res Ed liberal agenda,"
"political correctness")
to its relationship with

the academy ("impeding academic
progress by holding events that 'compete'
with the curriculum," "teaching courses
in the residences that are not up to Stan
ford standards") to its role in the person
al development of students ("too much
hand-holding") to its methods ("I moved
to the Row to get away from Res Ed and
all those 'canned' programs). Res Ed —
the monolith, the amorphous "they," the
"thought police."
In my years as a resident fellow, I
found it frustrating when our own staff
of resident assistants, not to mention the
residents, talked about Res Ed in mono
lithic terms. When I asked residents or
staff who they thought "Res Ed" was, it
always seemed to come as a revelation to
them that they were it. And now, as an
administrator of the program, I continue
to push against the same monolith men
tality, and so I eagerly accepted the invi
tation to contribute this Friday Forum.
If not a monolith, then what is Resi
dential Education? Residential Educa

tion — you will almost never hear me say
"Res Ed" — is a diverse system of 85
undergraduate housing units each pro
viding a wide array of educational set
tings — theme and focus houses, stu
dent-managed and cooperative resi
dences, apartments, suites, all-freshman,
four-class and upperclass houses. Resi
dential Education includes 37 RFs; hun
dreds of student residence staff mem
bers, from RAs to focus assistants to Row
house financial managers; faculty and
staff advisors; the residence office coordi
nators who serve each of the 10 residence
clusters and, most importantly, more
than 6,000 students who live in the
undergraduate residential system. A
monolith we are not — indeed, getting
agreement about anything is basically
impossible!
So what is Residential Education?
Residential Education is about the whole
person. In addition to supporting stu
dents' academic progress, it entails, in
varying degrees, students' intellectual,
cultural, personal, social, spiritual, emo
tional and physical development. Resi
dential Education is a collection of people
— residence staff and students —
engaged in a conscious and deliberate
process of learning and community build
ing. Community is the foundation of the
work in the residences which is strongly
linked with students' academic success
and the achievement of responsible citi
zenship.

The goal is to build pluralistic commu
nities where each student feels fully
included; where the environment is char
acterized by mutual concern, empathy,
the active exchange of views and the free
dom to differ intellectually, culturally
and politically.
The goal is to build intellectual com
munities that nurture critical thinking,
risk taking, experimentation, creativity
and free exchange of ideas.
The goal is to build learning commu
nities where students teach and learn
from each other; where individuals and
the community as a whole grow by con
sciously attending to the important
issues of the day.
The goal is to build reflective commu
nities where residents take time to reflect
on their experiences; to question them
selves and their ideas and assumptions.
The goal is to build responsible com
munities where respect for oneself and
others is the norm and where students
are accountable for their actions.
And the goal is to have fun — to be a
little crazy; to do some mindless, but not
thoughtless, things.
Residential Education is both proac
tive and reactive, forward-looking and
reflective. The role of the residence staff
is to deliberate — to watch for events
(local, national or international) and to
consciously turn those events into oppor-

tunities for social learning and
intellectual and personal growth.
We try to create comfortable (not
conflict-free), safe, nongraded
environments where students can
discuss key cultural and social
assumptions in order to actively
enrich and (re)construct their
social and intellectual identities.
We seek to create space for stu
dents to learn in different ways;
to offer private spaces as well as
community spaces where stu
dents can feel safe to do the things
they like to do. We seek to engage
and involve residents in every
aspect of building community.
How does this happen? Resi
dential Education is decentralized
and dynamic. Each year, steered
by a few guiding principles, resi
dences are formed anew and com
munity is rebuilt through the
dynamic that arises from differ
ent people living together and
bringing their ideas and experi
ences to bear. The building of
communities happens through
careful planning, through
serendipity, through chemistry
and sometimes through sheer

luck. It is magical and powerful
when it works — and most of the
time it does — but it is painful
and onerous when it doesn't
work.
It happens in as many ways as
there are good ideas and people
willing to act on those ideas —
through faculty visits, informal
late-night discussions, debates,
watching the news together, shar
ing of interests and talents, read
ing articles or books, dinner-table
discussions, residence-based
advising, residence-based courses,
formal and informal tutoring,
guest speakers, trips off campus,
community service projects, bul
letin boards, intramurals, social
events etc.
Does it all work? In many
ways, yes; in some ways no. Do we
have an "agenda"? Yes — of
human rights, of learning, of
reflection. Does it get "crammed
down people's throats"? Some
times, by some overzealous indi
viduals. Do some voices get cut
off? Sometimes, when people
don't listen to opinions or beliefs
they don't share. Can students
escape "Res Ed"? No, because all
students living in undergraduate
residences are part of Residential
Education. Can students escape
"canned" programs? Most cer

tainly, because each house decides
its own programming, and stu
dents are never forced to attend
any of it. Do we interfere with
academic progress? I don't think
so, but some students do get side
tracked by some very interesting
noncurricular alternatives. Do we
"hand-hold too much"? Perhaps
once in a while.
My hope is that the next time
anybody — including you —
makes generalizations about "Res
Ed," you'll take time to ask what
piece of Residential Education
you are talking about. Is the gen
eralization based on an anecdote,
on personal experience, on rumor;
on a single isolated incident? As
University President Gerhard
Casper advised incoming stu
dents, "think critically," and
"search not just for the evidence,
but for the counterevidence as
well."
Most importantly, I invite you
to get to know and personally
invest in this incredible, ever
adapting, multifaceted experience
and experiment of living and
learning together. The possibili
ties are endless.

nities where residents take time to reflect
on their experiences; to question them
selves and their ideas and assumptions.
The goal is to build responsible com
munities where respect for oneself and
others is the norm and where students
are accountable for their actions.
And the goal is to have fun — to be a
little crazy; to do some mindless, but not
thoughtless, things.
Residential Education is both proac
tive and reactive, forward-looking and
reflective. The role of the residence staff
is to deliberate — to watch for events
(local, national or international) and to
consciously turn those events into oppor-

tunities for social learning and
intellectual and personal growth.
We try to create comfortable (not
conflict-free), safe, nongraded
environments where students can
discuss key cultural and social
assumptions in order to actively
enrich and (re)construct their
social and intellectual identities.
We seek to create space for stu
dents to learn in different ways;
to offer private spaces as well as
community spaces where stu
dents can feel safe to do the things
they like to do. We seek to engage
and involve residents in every
aspect of building community.
How does this happen? Resi
dential Education is decentralized
and dynamic. Each year, steered
by a few guiding principles, resi
dences are formed anew and com
munity is rebuilt through the
dynamic that arises from differ
ent people living together and
bringing their ideas and experi
ences to bear. The building of
communities happens through
careful planning, through
serendipity, through chemistry
and sometimes through sheer

luck. It is magical and powerful
when it works — and most of the
time it does — but it is painful
and onerous when it doesn't
work.
It happens in as many ways as
there are good ideas and people
willing to act on those ideas —
through faculty visits, informal
late-night discussions, debates,
watching the news together, shar
ing of interests and talents, read
ing articles or books, dinner-table
discussions, residence-based
advising, residence-based courses,
formal and informal tutoring,
guest speakers, trips off campus,
community service projects, bul
letin boards, intramurals, social
events etc.
Does it all work? In many
ways, yes; in some ways no. Do we
have an "agenda"? Yes — of
human rights, of learning, of
reflection. Does it get "crammed
down people's throats"? Some
times, by some overzealous indi
viduals. Do some voices get cut
off? Sometimes, when people
don't listen to opinions or beliefs
they don't share. Can students
escape "Res Ed"? No, because all
students living in undergraduate
residences are part of Residential
Education. Can students escape
"canned" programs? Most cer

tainly, because each house decides
its own programming, and stu
dents are never forced to attend
any of it. Do we interfere with
academic progress? I don't think
so, but some students do get side
tracked by some very interesting
noncurricular alternatives. Do we
"hand-hold too much"? Perhaps
once in a while.
My hope is that the next time
anybody — including you —
makes generalizations about "Res
Ed," you'll take time to ask what
piece of Residential Education
you are talking about. Is the gen
eralization based on an anecdote,
on personal experience, on rumor;
on a single isolated incident? As
University President Gerhard
Casper advised incoming stu
dents, "think critically," and
"search not just for the evidence,
but for the counterevidence as
well."
Most importantly, I invite you
to get to know and personally
invest in this incredible, ever
adapting, multifaceted experience
and experiment of living and
learning together. The possibili
ties are endless.

OVER TIME, Resi
dential Education
has been the
object of much comment
on this campus, from its
mission ("cramming
multiculturalism down
students' throats," "the
Res Ed liberal agenda,"
"political correctness")
to its relationship with

the academy ("impeding academic
progress by holding events that 'compete'
with the curriculum," "teaching courses
in the residences that are not up to Stan
ford standards") to its role in the person
al development of students ("too much
hand-holding") to its methods ("I moved
to the Row to get away from Res Ed and
all those 'canned' programs). Res Ed —
the monolith, the amorphous "they," the
"thought police."
In my years as a resident fellow, I
found it frustrating when our own staff
of resident assistants, not to mention the
residents, talked about Res Ed in mono
lithic terms. When I asked residents or
staff who they thought "Res Ed" was, it
always seemed to come as a revelation to
them that they were it. And now, as an
administrator of the program, I continue
to push against the same monolith men
tality, and so I eagerly accepted the invi
tation to contribute this Friday Forum.
If not a monolith, then what is Resi
dential Education? Residential Educa

tion — you will almost never hear me say
"Res Ed" — is a diverse system of 85
undergraduate housing units each pro
viding a wide array of educational set
tings — theme and focus houses, stu
dent-managed and cooperative resi
dences, apartments, suites, all-freshman,
four-class and upperclass houses. Resi
dential Education includes 37 RFs; hun
dreds of student residence staff mem
bers, from RAs to focus assistants to Row
house financial managers; faculty and
staff advisors; the residence office coordi
nators who serve each of the 10 residence
clusters and, most importantly, more
than 6,000 students who live in the
undergraduate residential system. A
monolith we are not — indeed, getting
agreement about anything is basically
impossible!
So what is Residential Education?
Residential Education is about the whole
person. In addition to supporting stu
dents' academic progress, it entails, in
varying degrees, students' intellectual,
cultural, personal, social, spiritual, emo
tional and physical development. Resi
dential Education is a collection of people
— residence staff and students —
engaged in a conscious and deliberate
process of learning and community build
ing. Community is the foundation of the
work in the residences which is strongly
linked with students' academic success
and the achievement of responsible citi
zenship.

The goal is to build pluralistic commu
nities where each student feels fully
included; where the environment is char
acterized by mutual concern, empathy,
the active exchange of views and the free
dom to differ intellectually, culturally
and politically.
The goal is to build intellectual com
munities that nurture critical thinking,
risk taking, experimentation, creativity
and free exchange of ideas.
The goal is to build learning commu
nities where students teach and learn
from each other; where individuals and
the community as a whole grow by con
sciously attending to the important
issues of the day.
The goal is to build reflective commu
nities where residents take time to reflect
on their experiences; to question them
selves and their ideas and assumptions.
The goal is to build responsible com
munities where respect for oneself and
others is the norm and where students
are accountable for their actions.
