More respect, better facilities for 'marginalized'programs

SINCE I HAVE been a student at
Stanford, I have seen quite a few
buildings erected around campus:
the economics building, the earth sci
ences building, the athletics building,
the Haas Center for Public Service, vari
ous buildings around the Medical Cen
ter, and the Gates Computer Science
Building currently under construction.
In addition, there are plans for a new
science and engineering quad and for
further expansion of the Medical Center
and the possible construction of apart
ments in that vicinity.
I do not want to make judgments on
the worth of such buildings, but I would
like to shed light on some academic pro
grams with insufficient and demeaning
facilities. The Wilbur Modules (those
ugly trailers sitting at the perimeter of
campus outside Wilbur) house the Pro
gram in African and Afro-American
Studies, the French and Italian Depart

ment, the Spanish and Portuguese
Department, the Slavic Languages and
Literatures Department, and the Writ
ing and Critical Thinking Program. The
Center for Latin American Studies is
located in Bolivar House on Alvarado
Row, between Chi Theta Chi and Ham
marskjold. The Feminist Studies Pro
gram is located in a rickety old building
across from the bike shop. The Chi
cano/a Fellows Program is located in a
tiny space at the back of El Centro Chi
cano.
Out of sight, out of mind, the loca
tions of these programs illustrate a lack
of recognition and respect for tradition
ally marginalized programs. If the Uni
versity ever does fund programs such as
Asian American Studies, Native Ameri
can Studies, and Queer Studies, I won
der what obscure, remote places it will
find for them. And I have not even
begun to address the amount of funding

any of the programs I have mentioned
receive; I have only observed their rela
tive locations.
Well, goes the argument, Hewlett,
Packard, Gates, and friends give money
for specific buildings, and so they are
built. Thus the situation I am describing
is an inadvertent one, and therefore a
moot point. So it's like Monopoly —
whoever has the most money has the
most buildings, is the most popular, and
wins the game. But wait a minute! Isn't
there something more to our education?
I want an education that will teach
me to examine the world critically and
find ways to make it better. The ethnic
studies programs and the Feminist
Studies Program exist as a challenge to
our traditional education. They ask the
questions about what is lacking in our
education and what makes the systems
of power in the world the way that they
are. Pushing them, as well as the pro-

grams that deal with places not consid
ered worthy of academic study (Latin
American Studies and Slavic Languages
and Literatures), to the outskirts of our
campus silences and belittles these ques
tions.
We do need science and technology,
but we need something else, as well. I
am fairly certain that the new science
quad will not help me explain or amelio
rate the present crises of the inner
cities, the ethnic conflicts, the people
suffering in Haiti, or the billions of peo
ple who don't have access to a basic
meal a day, let alone the Internet. I
guess I just came to the wrong school.
When I sit up at night listening to
gun shots, I don't think about designing
technology that will block out the noise.
So I run off to Stanford and let the Uni
versity do it for me.
