# Proposition 187 would place abuse victims in even greater jeopardy
## 
### 
I write to express my views about
Proposition 187.
I plan to vote against Proposition 187,
also known as "Save our State," because
of the negative effect it would have on
women and children. I am particularly
concerned with the effect it would have
on undocumented immigrants who are
also victims of domestic violence.
Battered women who are also undocu
mented immigrants are particularly vul
nerable. Having limited language and/or
cultural skills, they may be even more
trapped and afraid than other battered
women. Many abusive spouses use the
threat of deportation as an additional tool
of control. These women and their chil-

dren have enough problems dealing with
the physical abuse, torture and threats
that come from their violent marriages â€”
California does not need to compound
those problems by slamming the door
when a woman reaches out for help.
Stanford is not free from the problems
of domestic abuse that plague the rest of
our state. In 1991, when I first started
volunteering at the Support Network for
Battered Women, a local shelter and ser
vice agency, the first woman I helped to
get a restraining order was a Stanford
graduate student from another country.
For her, as for all battered women, to
complete the restraining order papers,
show up in court and tell her story to the
judge was a frightening and overwhelm
ing ordeal. She contemplated quitting the
process more than once. I honestly think
that if she had faced one more barrier,
one more obstacle, she might have decid
ed it just was not worth it. As she was a
woman of color who would have been

questioned about her documentation sta
tus, Proposition 187 could have present
ed that one obstacle. And even though
she could have proven her status, I won
der if, at that point, she would have felt
like trying.
If Proposition 187 passes, battered
women who cannot prove their docu
mentation status will not be able to get
help. If Proposition 187 passes, already
overworked and understaffed battered
women's shelters will have to spend
their scarce time and resources checking
the immigration status of each woman
and child who comes seeking help. If
Proposition 187 passes, any battered
woman who flees her home in an emer
gency and neglects to take the proper
paperwork will not be able to enter an
emergency shelter.
I trust we can come up with "solu
tions" better than this.
