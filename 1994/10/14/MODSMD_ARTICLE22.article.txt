# Letters Policy
## 
### 
The Daily welcomes letters from
its readers. Letters will be published
at the editor's discretion and are sub
ject to editing. All letters must include
the author's name, phone number
and Stanford affiliation, if any. Sub
missions with more than five signa
tures must designate a representa
tive.
Disks should have the owner's
name written clearly on the front and
may be picked up two business days
after they have been dropped off.
Letters should be turned in on a
Macintosh disk in Microsoft Word
format with a paper copy of the sub
mission, or e-mailed to:
ops@daily.stanford.edu
