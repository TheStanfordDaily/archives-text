## Stanford in Paris: back to l'ecole secondaire 
### 
PARIS, FRANCE
STUDENTS GO TO Stanford, in
theory, to get away from high
school. But for those of you who
still hold some fond memories of your
final four years at home, there is a way
to relive it for a quarter or two.
Attend Stanford in Paris.
Sick of all that typing you have
to do in college? Forget it, it's not
really expected in France — and you get
brownie points from easily impressed
instructors if you do word process your
papers. One warning, however: the
equipment in the high-tech-sounding
salle micromegas was probably imported
from your high school after it decided to
enter the computer age. (Remember the
Macintosh SE?) In addition, you have to
master the crazy French keyboard,
which forces you to use the shift key to
type a period. Go figure.
Miss living at home? No problem,
in Paris you can live with a family who
feeds you a breakfast and dinner that

makes Chez Kimball look like a soup
kitchen. There are even some advan
tages over home (wine with meals,
cheese and dessert every night). And
although Stanford in Paris stresses that
the families are not obligated to do your
laundry, most seem eager to offer.
Concerned about lunch money?
Don't worry, Stanford comes to the res
cue by depositing 40 francs (a little less
than eight dollars) daily into your bank
account for le dejeuner — and you get
even more for weekends, when families
aren't expected to feed you at all (but if
they do, nothing stops you from blowing
the cash on something else). And relax,
you don't have to open the bank account
yourself. Mom, uh, I mean Stanford in
Paris, takes care of the heavy paperwork
— the French love bureaucracy — in
advance, so your ATM card is ready
when you arrive. Unfortunately, this
also makes it possible for the program
administrators to remove money (for
textbooks and copying fees) from your

account as well. At least you're the only
person who knows your PIN.
Longing for that high school
atmosphere? Dream no more, at Stan
ford in Paris you are based at the Ecole
Superieure de Commerce de Paris, a
French business school of just a thou
sand students in the heart of Paris' 11th
arrondissement. The "campus" is remi
niscent of an urban high school; between
and after classes, it seems the entire
school convenes in the central court
yard/parking lot to smoke, just like the
cool kids in 9th grade. The age of the
ESCP — which is celebrating its 175 th
anniversary this year — is reflected in
the condition of some of its buildings,
but not, unfortunately, in the quality
and depth of its library. (One indication:
various old issues of The Daily, which
are mailed to Stanford in Paris and kept
here, lie disorganized on a side table,
apparently untouched since last spring.)
Your high school's library might even
outclass this bibliothcque in some

respects. The ESCP's definition of a
"multimedia center," for example, is a
couple of VCRs and a few dozen movies.
Though in a good location, the ESCP
is hardly a quick bike ride from the rest
of Paris. There's no sleeping until five
minutes before class here. My morning
trip from the banlieue (suburbs) — via
commuter rail followed by the Metro —
is a solid 35 minutes. The situation is
not much better for the students who
choose to live in the international dormi
tory, which is also a good distance from
the ESCP. (The concept of a college cam
pus as Americans know it, with lots of
open space and conveniently located stu
dent housing is as foreign to the French
as the stand-up shower.) In short, you
have to get up early for class, probably
for the first time since ... high school.
The similarities continue. The staff at
Stanford in Paris is always helpful, but
for some reason the atmosphere feels
more like that of a New England board
ing school than a university overseas

program. Perhaps it's the loud clapping
that the director of Stanford in Paris
does when she wants the classroom to
quiet down. Very effective, by the way.
The high school aura of Stanford in
Paris is compounded by the often strict
rules of behavior. For example, at the
first meeting, the program's coordina
tors announced that no talking would be
permitted in the Stanford "library"
(read: dorm study room). They also
warned us that eating during class is an
American habit that should be quickly
broken — although French professors
apparently don't mind clouds of
cigarette smoke billowing around the
room as they teach.
Other aspects of Stanford in Paris
academics also support the perception
that we aren't quite as free as our Cali-

fornia counterparts. Case in
point: students were warned
early on that if we miss more
than three of our 9 a.m. French
classes, we will fail — excuse me,
"NC" — the course. In addition,
all Stanford instructors are
given a photocopy of everyone's
mug shot to refer to — a Stan

ford in Paris froshbook, if you
will. And I thought Paris was lib
erated from fascism 50 years
ago
A final comment: Although the
Paris program technically follows
the Stanford grading system, it
apparently does not adhere to the
New World's unwritten bylaws
concerning grade inflation. All
instructors — French university
professors and those employed by
Stanford — grade us under the
French system, where grades

range from 1 (inconceivably bad)
to 20 (A+). At the end of the quar
ter, the program director uses a
strict scale to "translate" each
grade to its American equivalent;
inflating the grade is not part of
the equation.
My gosh, all that and an equi
table grading system — this is
high school.

Matt would like to thank fellow
Stanford Parisien Jason Hool for
his help.
