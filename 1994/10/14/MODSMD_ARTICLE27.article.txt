## No vacation Spikers to face 'Zonas 
### Seth Goldstein Staff writer 
No rest for the weary.
Last weekend the No. 1 Stanford women's vol
leyball team defeated Pacific 10 Conference arch
rivals No. 3 UCLA and No. 11 USC. But those
who think that these two victories give the Cardi
nal a chance to relax should think again.
This weekend Stanford (13-0 overall, 7-0 in the
Pac-10) travels to the Valley of the Sun to take on
another pair of talented opponents in No. 16 Ari
zona (8-4, 4-3) and No. 14 Arizona State (9-5, 4-3).
Stanford head coach Don Shaw certainly
doesn't think the team can afford a letdown. As
soon as he stepped into the press room after Sat
urday evening's win over the Bruins, he said, "We
still have the Arizonas to face. They struggled this
(past) weekend in Washington. They'll have some
tough practices this week and they'll be ready for
us."
A few days later, the twin triumphs over the
Los Angeles schools were barely even a fond mem
ory.
"That's already in the past," Shaw said. "We
can't think about that anymore. We're just looking
to the future." And the immediate future holds
two top-20 opponents.
The Wildcats pack a powerful punch. Left-side
hitters Barb Bell, a sophomore hitting .229, and
Melissa Ferris, a senior hitting .247, are the Pac
10's top kill combination, ranked fourth and sixth,
respectively. Setting for the two talented spikers is

assists per game with 13.
Arizona is also an excellent block
ing club. Senior Charita Johnson and
sophomore Tamika Dennis rank
sixth and 10th in blocking in the Pac
-10. Johnson, especially, could give
the Cardinal "some real problems",
according to Shaw.
Junior Christine Garner, a mem
ber of the U.S. Team at the Goodwill
Games this past summer, will lead
the Sun Devils. The left-side hitter
ranks fifth in the conference in both
kills and aces and ranks sixth in digs
average.
"Both these teams cause match
up problems," Shaw said. "They're
very aggressive. They like to just go
up and bang it home all the time."
Stanford holds an all-time record
of 25-1 against Arizona, but that one
loss came the last time Stanford
faced the Wildcats. The Sun Devils
also defeated the Cardinal in the last
match the two squads played.
"When we went down there last
year, we really struggled with them,"
Shaw said. "They embarrassed us. So
we'll be up for those matches."
Revenge is definitely on the minds
of some Stanford spikers.
"We had a tough time last year,"
junior setter Cary Wendell said. "So
we'll be extremely fired up. We want
to prove that last year was a fluke."
To accomplish this goal, Shaw
brings a Cardinal team that is first in
the conference in hitting percentage
with .315, over 40 points higher than
second-ranked USC. Stanford is also
first in kills and assists per game.
Defensively, the Cardinal is hold
ing opponents to only 12 kills and 11
assists per game — both league lows.
Stanford's adversaries are only hit
ting .164, a mark which ranks second
in the Pac-10.
Individually, freshman outside
hitter Kristen Folkl leads the confer
ence in hitting with an amazing .423,
50 points higher than the next play
er. Classmate Lisa Sharpley holds
the fifth spot in that category and
Wendell ranks eighth.
Another talented spiker, junior
hitter Marnie Triefenbach, captured
the American Volleyball Coaches
Association Player of the Week
award for her performances against
USC and UCLA. She is the first Car
dinal to win the national award since
the program was started last year.
Definitely not a sign of a squad
resting on its laurels.
