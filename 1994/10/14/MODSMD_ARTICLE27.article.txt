## No vacation Spikers to face 'Zonas 
### Seth Goldstein Staff writer 
No rest for the weary.
Last weekend the No. 1 Stanford women's vol
leyball team defeated Pacific 10 Conference arch
rivals No. 3 UCLA and No. 11 USC. But those
who think that these two victories give the Cardi
nal a chance to relax should think again.
This weekend Stanford (13-0 overall, 7-0 in the
Pac-10) travels to the Valley of the Sun to take on
another pair of talented opponents in No. 16 Ari
zona (8-4, 4-3) and No. 14 Arizona State (9-5, 4-3).
Stanford head coach Don Shaw certainly
doesn't think the team can afford a letdown. As
soon as he stepped into the press room after Sat
urday evening's win over the Bruins, he said, "We
still have the Arizonas to face. They struggled this
(past) weekend in Washington. They'll have some
tough practices this week and they'll be ready for
us."
A few days later, the twin triumphs over the
Los Angeles schools were barely even a fond mem
ory.
"That's already in the past," Shaw said. "We
can't think about that anymore. We're just looking
to the future." And the immediate future holds
two top-20 opponents.
The Wildcats pack a powerful punch. Left-side
hitters Barb Bell, a sophomore hitting .229, and
Melissa Ferris, a senior hitting .247, are the Pac
10's top kill combination, ranked fourth and sixth,
respectively. Setting for the two talented spikers is
junior Laura Bartsch, who leads the conference in
