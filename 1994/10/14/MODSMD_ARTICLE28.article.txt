## Cardinal to face Trojans 
### Greg Collins Staff writer 
Beaten and bruised from a
three-game losing streak, Stanford
has seen its New Year's Day
dreams quickly disappear amid a
wash of injuries and chronic mis
takes.
Now, with almost all of its run
ning backs finally healthy, the Car
dinal looks to return to the bal
anced attack that saw it score 92
points in the first two games of the
season.
Stanford (1-3-1,0-2 in the Pacif
ic 10 Conference) faces Pac-10
nemesis USC (3-2, 2-1) Saturday
at 4 p.m. in a crucial game for the
Cardinal's fortunes. However, at
this point an argument can be
made that every game is crucial for
Stanford.
"We're struggling, period," said
head coach Bill Walsh. "As I men
tioned last week, we expect that at
some point we're going to knock
somebody off. It could be this week
but it might not be for quite a few
weeks."
Even a win Saturday might be
too late for this team. Last week's
crushing last-second defeat pushed
Stanford into the bowels of a
underpowered Pac-10 this year.

"We have to be able to overcome
these, as coach Walsh says, these
life lessons," sophomore fullback
Adam Salina said. "Coming back
as hard as you can and still losing is
a life lesson, and it's something we
have to learn from."
The good news for Stanford's
offense is that freshman Anthony
Bookman will definitely play
against USC. Sophomore Mike
Mitchell is still ailing from a mus
cle strain in his lower leg which has
kept him out of the last three
games.
"I don't think we'll suit him up
for Saturday," Walsh said. "We'll
just wait another week. We have to
be patient."
Defensively, the team continues
to win the statistical battles but
lose the games. Ranked sixth in the
Pac-10 in total defense, Stanford is
giving up a whopping 33 points a
game. Although the defense starts
three freshmen and five other
first-year starters, inexperience
can no longer be used as an excuse
for all the mistakes.
"There comes a point where
you're only a young player for so
long and those guys need to step up
and have stepped up," senior
