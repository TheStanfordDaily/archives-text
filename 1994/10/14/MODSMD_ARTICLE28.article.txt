## Cardinal to face Trojans 
### Greg Collins Staff writer 
Beaten and bruised from a
three-game losing streak, Stanford
has seen its New Year's Day
dreams quickly disappear amid a
wash of injuries and chronic mis
takes.
Now, with almost all of its run
ning backs finally healthy, the Car
dinal looks to return to the bal
anced attack that saw it score 92
points in the first two games of the
season.
Stanford (1-3-1,0-2 in the Pacif
ic 10 Conference) faces Pac-10
nemesis USC (3-2, 2-1) Saturday
at 4 p.m. in a crucial game for the
Cardinal's fortunes. However, at
this point an argument can be
made that every game is crucial for
Stanford.
"We're struggling, period," said
head coach Bill Walsh. "As I men
tioned last week, we expect that at
some point we're going to knock
somebody off. It could be this week
but it might not be for quite a few
weeks."
Even a win Saturday might be
too late for this team. Last week's
crushing last-second defeat pushed
Stanford into the bowels of a
underpowered Pac-10 this year.

"We have to be able to overcome
these, as coach Walsh says, these
life lessons," sophomore fullback
Adam Salina said. "Coming back
as hard as you can and still losing is
a life lesson, and it's something we
have to learn from."
The good news for Stanford's
offense is that freshman Anthony
Bookman will definitely play
against USC. Sophomore Mike
Mitchell is still ailing from a mus
cle strain in his lower leg which has
kept him out of the last three
games.
"I don't think we'll suit him up
for Saturday," Walsh said. "We'll
just wait another week. We have to
be patient."
Defensively, the team continues
to win the statistical battles but
lose the games. Ranked sixth in the
Pac-10 in total defense, Stanford is
giving up a whopping 33 points a
game. Although the defense starts
three freshmen and five other
first-year starters, inexperience
can no longer be used as an excuse
for all the mistakes.
"There comes a point where
you're only a young player for so
long and those guys need to step up
and have stepped up," senior
linebacker Mike Hall said. "At this
point, we're just victimizing our
selves. At times we put together
strings where we play really well,
but we just keep coming into trou
ble. We can't close the door when
we need to."
Hall also cited numerous penal
ties and individual breakdowns
which have prolonged opponents'
drives, including several late hits
iigainst Arizona State.
The defense should also see
some relief from the injury bug, as
sophomore cornerback Eliel Swin
ton returns from a hip
flexor/quadricep injury. His pres
ence should help bolster a strug
gling secondary which was picked
apart by the Sun Devils last week.
Senior safety John Henton also
returns after missing the last four
games and joins Stanford's nickel
pass coverage.
As for the Trojans, they expect
senior quarterback Rob Johnson to
be ready to play, despite a nagging
ankle injury. Johnson, a high
school teammate of Steve Sten
strom, has posted strong numbers
in USC's up-and-down season. He
has completed 83-of-122 passes for
951 yards, with three touchdowns
iind two interceptions.
If Johnson is unable to play,
Weber State transfer Brad Otton
will step in and guide the offense.
In Johnson's place last week,
Otton led the Trojans back from an
early 11-point deficit to beat Ore
gon State 27-19.
Along with a powerful air
attack, head coach John Robinson

has somewhat managed to put the
running game back into a school
which has been referred to as
"Tailback U." Shawn Walters leads
the Trojans with 478 yards on 103
carries, an average of 95.6 per
game. The running game is
anchored by left tackle Tony Bosel
li, an All-American candidate.
'They have a very powerful
offense and a big offensive line, and
they're very capable of moving the
ball," Hall said.
Last year, that offense had little
trouble rolling up yards against

Stanford in a 45-20 Trojan win.
Johnson passed for 349 yards and
three touchdowns in guiding USC
to 497 yards of total offense. After
being behind only 24-17 at half
time, the Cardinal gave up 21 third
quarter points in a frustrating loss.
After opening the season with a
win over Washington (a team
Walsh calls the best in the western
half of the country), USC has post
ed a series of unpredictable results.
An embarrassing loss to Penn State
was followed by a win over a strong
Baylor team, but the week after

that the Trojans again stumbled.
Dropping a 22-7 decision to Ore
gon at home, USC continued to
struggle last week against Oregon
State before pulling out a win.
However, the return of Johnson
puts USC back in the hunt for a
bowl game, with an outside shot at
the Rose Bowl.
"This is going to be our biggest
game of the year," Salina said. "It
could be a huge turning point for
us in terms of a confidence booster
and just to set the tone for the rest
of the season."

Curtis Conway has his way on the ground against the Cardinal last year. Although Conway no longer
plays for the Trojans, Stanford still must worry about the rushing abilities of Tailback U.
