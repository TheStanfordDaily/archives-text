## Regan Demas takes on Dr. Zimbardo in a clash of college football psyches 
### 
Perhaps his ability to hypno
tize others and explore the depths
of social interaction gives him a
greater capacity to predict the
future. Regardless, renowned
Stanford psychology professor
Philip Zimbardo is prepared to
apply his years of cultural study
around the world to one weekend
of college football action on the
turf.
His famed "prison experiment"
illustrated the ability of humans
to adjust to character roles when
placed in those environments, and
Dr. Zimbardo is himself about to
slip into the role of college football
prognosticator extraordinare as
he picks the spreads with me in
the games of the week:
uSC at Stanford
I've finally figured it out. All
Stanford needs to do is stop
Southern Cal's offense and the
Cardinal will have no trouble
beating the Trojans on Saturday.
Trouble is, Stanford will have
to stop them before the USC team
bus reaches the stadium in the
morning — perhaps even some
where along 1-5 between here and
L.A. Because once the Trojan
offense hits the field, any hopes of
thwarting another hammering in
the offensive stats line will be

beyond the abilities of the Cardi
nal.
Zimbardo sees this match-up
as "a season-turning-around
game" for Stanford. "The offense
will do what it did in the first
game, and the defense will do
what it should have been able to
do all year."
I'm more willing to bet the
defense will also do what it has
done all year — absolutely noth
ing. The offense may very well
continue to produce; unfortunate
ly, the combined offensive power
of the U.S. Armed Forces couldn't
compensate for the dismal
defense.
Still, Dr. Z thinks Stanford will
show up with a new look. "I think
it and I hope it."
I've thought about it a lot, but
the word hope just doesn't seem
to be in my Stanford football
vocabulary anymore.
Zimbardo: Stanford by 10
Reagan: USC by 6

Dr. Z thinks the Bears will go
into hibernation following the
loss of quarterback Dave Barr for
the season.
"It's a big minus," he said. "I
