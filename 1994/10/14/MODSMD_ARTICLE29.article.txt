## Regan Demas takes on Dr. Zimbardo in a clash of college football psyches 
### 
Perhaps his ability to hypno
tize others and explore the depths
of social interaction gives him a
greater capacity to predict the
future. Regardless, renowned
Stanford psychology professor
Philip Zimbardo is prepared to
apply his years of cultural study
around the world to one weekend
of college football action on the
turf.
His famed "prison experiment"
illustrated the ability of humans
to adjust to character roles when
placed in those environments, and
Dr. Zimbardo is himself about to
slip into the role of college football
prognosticator extraordinare as
he picks the spreads with me in
the games of the week:
uSC at Stanford
I've finally figured it out. All
Stanford needs to do is stop
Southern Cal's offense and the
Cardinal will have no trouble
beating the Trojans on Saturday.
Trouble is, Stanford will have
to stop them before the USC team
bus reaches the stadium in the
morning — perhaps even some
where along 1-5 between here and
L.A. Because once the Trojan
offense hits the field, any hopes of
thwarting another hammering in
the offensive stats line will be

beyond the abilities of the Cardi
nal.
Zimbardo sees this match-up
as "a season-turning-around
game" for Stanford. "The offense
will do what it did in the first
game, and the defense will do
what it should have been able to
do all year."
I'm more willing to bet the
defense will also do what it has
done all year — absolutely noth
ing. The offense may very well
continue to produce; unfortunate
ly, the combined offensive power
of the U.S. Armed Forces couldn't
compensate for the dismal
defense.
Still, Dr. Z thinks Stanford will
show up with a new look. "I think
it and I hope it."
I've thought about it a lot, but
the word hope just doesn't seem
to be in my Stanford football
vocabulary anymore.

California at Oregon
Dr. Z thinks the Bears will go
into hibernation following the
loss of quarterback Dave Barr for
the season.
"It's a big minus," he said. "I

don't think his replacement is
going to pull it off."
Barr's bad break will certainly
bait the Bears. But they are play
ing an Oregon football squad,
and it's been open season on
Duck in college football for
decades. New Cal QB Kerry
McGonigal had a decent second
half against UCLA after Barr left
the game, going 6-for-9 for 82
yards.
The Ducks should be out
matched offensively, even with
the Barr injury. And if all that
reasoning doesn't convince you,
keep in mind that the last time
an Oregon football squad was
above .500 in mid-season, Bill
Walsh was sucking a pacifier and
playing with Lincoln Logs.

No. 3 Penn State at No. 5
Michigan
There's a lot the 5-0 Nittany
Lions will have to overcome to
remain undefeated: 1) a double
barrel pair of Michigan running
backs, who consistently collect
nearly 300 yards combined on
the ground, 2) the disadvantage
of playing in Ann Arbor, 3) the
emotional let-down of having a
bye last week, 4) the horrible
drawback of playing in Ann
Arbor, 5) the recognition that if
it wasn't for Colorado's godsend
Hail Mary touchdown pass sev
eral weeks ago against the
Wolverines, PSU would be fac
ing the second- or third-ranked
team in the country, and 6) the
very thought of playing in Ann
Arbor.
Zimbardo dissents. "Paterno
always creates a very disciplined
team fat PSU]. Michigan will be
emotional, but that could lead to
mistakes."
There's more to this Michigan
squad than its No. 5 ranking
illustrates. And don't forget —
the game's in Ann Arbor. You've
never seen a hundred thousand
psychotic college kids until
you've seen them packed into
Michigan Stadium.

No. 14 Arizona at No. 20
Washington State

The nation's top defense has
slipped a bit in the past few
weeks, and last week's loss to
Colorado State showed that
Arizona's offense might be
unable to pick up the defensive
slack. Zimbardo is confident
that the Wildcats will "be
angry at [themselves! for hav
ing lost" and beat the talented
Cougars.
While not endowed with Dr.
Z's team psychology skills and
knowledge of animal/group
behavior instincts, I agree.
Had Arizona not lost last
week I'd pick WSU in a second.
But the nation's number one
ranked team at the beginning of
the season is not going to fall out
of the top 25 before the year is
up. Fortunately even an unedu
cated doof'us like myself, without
the doctorate and years of exper
imentation under my belt can
deduce that.

No. 22 Oklahoma at No. 4
Colorado
For two weeks in a row Col
orado has relied on last second
heroics to capture narrow vic
tories. But the luck stops
here.
Zimbardo senses that the
undefeated Colorado herd will
trample 3-2 Oklahoma. I can't
shake the feeling that home field
advantage won't be enough to
keep the Sooners from staking a
claim to the Buffaloes' home on
the range.

No. 6 Auburn at No. 1 Florida
Dr. Z predicts the upset of
the year. I just don't have the
guts.
This Florida squad is the best
team in college football in several
years. Auburn's Tantalus-like
fate is about to be relived — the
Tigers go undefeated in their
first six or seven games and
break into the top 10, only to col
lapse in the second half of the
season and finish on the lousy
end of a bowl game score. It's
deja vu all over again for the
Tigers.
