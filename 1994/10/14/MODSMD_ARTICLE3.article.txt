# Fac Sen deliberates over CUE specifics
## Rice creates committees to study implementation 
### Beth Berselli Scott Van Winkle Senior staff writers 
Yesterday, at the first meeting of this
academic year, members of the Faculty Sen
ate voiced concerns about the process for
implementing the recommendations of the
Commission on Undergraduate Education.
Attempting to clarify the senate's role in
the upcoming changes to Stanford's under
graduate program, Provost Condoleezza Rice
presented a plan for implementing the com
mission's proposals — which include develop
ing a new science core for non-science majors,
creating the position of vice provost for under
graduate education, redefining the Cultures,
Ideas and Values courses, and strengthening
Stanford's writing and language require
ments, as well as its advising system.
"Clearly a lot of the major recommenda-

tions will require action by
the senate because they are
matters of curricular or de
gree requirements," Rice
told senators yesterday.
Rice's plan will divide the
responsibilities between
the administration, various
senate committees and
three new "design commit
tees," which will study in

further detail the University's distribution
requirements.
One committee will redesign CIV, and a
second committee will look at the DRs in the
humanities and social sciences.
The third committee will study the possi
bility of developing a new three-quarter sci
ence course to replace the current DRs in


Rice
mathematics, natural sciences,
and technology and applied sci
ences.
These committees should
begin work during winter quar
ter, Rice said.
In response to English Prof.
George Dekker's question as to
how members of the design com
mittees will be chosen, Rice said
she will consult with deans and
various senate committees when
deciding on committee members.
"The only requirement to be on
the committee is that you're will
ing to teach in the [science and
CIV| core," she said.
With regards to ASSU Senate
Chair Nawwar Kasrawi's concern
about further student involve
ment, Rice said that there will
definitely be student input.

Hut Rice added that she has
reservations about student mem
bership on the committees
because faculty committee mem
bers will actually design and teach
the courses.
However, English Prof. John
Bender commented that the com
mittees should definitely consider
"who the consumers are."
During the 90-minute discus
sion yesterday, several senators
expressed concern about the sen
ate's role in implementing the
proposals.
English Prof. Regenia Gagnier
said she was unclear about exact
ly what the senate's role is.
"Is the senate just going to
react to these design committees
or will they be involved in the gen
eral discussions?" she asked.
Bender said the senate should
discuss the various recommenda
tions "in principle." For example,
the senate should discuss whether
it supports the idea of implement

ing a science core.
"It seems to me that this is
being treated as a foregone con
clusion that we will have this sci
ence core," Bender said.
Rice said that such a discussion
would be "an excellent idea," but
ultimately the senate needs to get
down to examining the "nuts and
bolts" of the recommendations.
Stressing that interaction
between the committees and the
senate is vital, Rice said the com
mittees will not "go into quaran
tine. ... I would hope that con
versation goes on."
"I hope we don't get lost in
jurisdiction battles about what
should be done," Rice added. "I
am very conscious of the senate's
role in curriculum reform."
History Prof. James Sheehan,
chair of the commission, said com
mittee members will "constantly
consult the senate to make sure
that they're not building a house
that nobody wants to live in."

"The real issue now is at what
points in the process the senate
can be involved," he added.
Gagnier asked if the senate's
Steering Committee could provide
some clarification about the sen
ate's actual role in the implemen
tation process at the next meet
ing.
The Steering Committee will
decide whether to act on this
request, decreed Biological Sci
ences Prof. Robert Simoni, chair
of the senate.
During yesterday's meeting,
University President Gerhard
Casper told senators that the
"single most important recom
mendation is the one about the
breadth requirements."
Expressing hope that this pro
posal is "attended to quickly,"
Casper said the exact costs of
implementing the recommenda
tions are unclear at this time.
"We don't know at this point
what the price tag is," he said.

Several senators yesterday said
they agreed with the general prin
ciples set forth in the commis
sion's report.
"I read the report thoroughly
last night and I found myself nod
ding my head 'yes,' more than
nodding my head 'no,' " said
Statistics Prof. Brad Efron.
After the meeting, several sen
ators said that yesterday's discus
sion presented no surprises.
"I had figured that there would
be concern about jurisdiction and
implementation," Simoni said.
Geological and Environmental
Sciences Prof. Gail Mahood said
the discussion was "predictable in
that some people had concerns
about how the recommendations
are implemented."
In its 64-page report released
Wednesday, the commission —
which was created by Casper in
April 1993 — proposed several
major reforms to Stanford's
undergraduate program.

Casper charged the commis
sion with re-examining virtually
every facet of Stanford's under
graduate experience — the first
such undertaking at Stanford in
nearly a quarter of a century.
The commission — composed
of 14 faculty, two students, two
alumni and an administrator —
was asked to "articulate the edu
cational goals of Stanford's
undergraduate program."
In other senate business, sena
tors approved a proposal to
streamline the senate's function
by removing non-controversial,
routine items from the agenda.
Under the proposal, an adminis
trative session of the Steering
Committee will replace one or more
senate meetings per quarter to
carry out routine business of the
senate, including changes to degree
lists and rules of the senate.
This proposal will allow the
senate more time for discussion of
important topics, Simoni said.
