# Fac Sen deliberates over CUE specifics
## Rice creates committees to study implementation 
### Beth Berselli Scott Van Winkle Senior staff writers 
Yesterday, at the first meeting of this
academic year, members of the Faculty Sen
ate voiced concerns about the process for
implementing the recommendations of the
Commission on Undergraduate Education.
Attempting to clarify the senate's role in
the upcoming changes to Stanford's under
graduate program, Provost Condoleezza Rice
presented a plan for implementing the com
mission's proposals â€” which include develop
ing a new science core for non-science majors,
creating the position of vice provost for under
graduate education, redefining the Cultures,
Ideas and Values courses, and strengthening
Stanford's writing and language require
ments, as well as its advising system.
"Clearly a lot of the major recommenda-

tions will require action by
the senate because they are
matters of curricular or de
gree requirements," Rice
told senators yesterday.
Rice's plan will divide the
responsibilities between
the administration, various
senate committees and
three new "design commit
tees," which will study in

further detail the University's distribution
requirements.
One committee will redesign CIV, and a
second committee will look at the DRs in the
humanities and social sciences.
The third committee will study the possi
bility of developing a new three-quarter sci
ence course to replace the current DRs in
