## Women's water polo on the rise 
### Zachary Foreman 
They're serious.
And next year the women's
water polo team will also be varsi
ty and, possibly, defending
national champions. Even before
this season has begun, 15 return
ing players and several talented
newcomers have been practicing
daily. Pool work-outs two to three
times a week, weight training ses
sions and running two stadiums
round out a grueling schedule —
all for the greater glory of
women's water polo.
Although the season is months
away, only one goal looms on
these players minds — the
National Championships at the
end of May.
"We're going to nationals, def
initely," said sophomore returnee
Alice Cathcart. "Last year was
the first year we had Ben [Quit
tner] and he jumped into it and
got us going."
When not an assistant coach
with the men's squad, Quittner
heads the women's team with
assistant Andrea Milano. Quit
tner, who spent 15 years on the

Hungarian national team, holds
an optimistic outlook of the com
ing season.
"The whole department is very
excited." the coach said. "Last
year I expected a lot but [the
team] wasn't sure. They are
much more confident and experi
enced."
"Last year I was hoping to
make it to nationals. This year
I'm expecting to make it," Quit
tner added with a smile.
Last season the team was 6-7
in tournament games and fin
ished sixth in the region. Because
of its dominance of the Western
Region, such a performance sug
gests that Stanford could proba
bly have been called the seventh
or eighth in the nation, according
to senior co-captain Nicki
Bergstrom.
Even as the Cardinal women
are poised to "get serious," so is
women's water polo on a national
level. Women's water polo isn't
governed by an organized body
and is often poorly publicized.
Even though Stanford won the
national championship as recent
ly as 1989, women's water polo
still isn't recognized as a con
tending force in Stanford's
champion-rich sporting commu
nity.
The Cardinal's determination
Ihas already paid off. With varsity
the Cardinal will be able
to recruit high school prospects
with scholarships.
I "Basically we're going to have
'recruits and veterans coming in,
~but if you prove yourself this
•year, you'll have a spot on a var
.sity team," Bergstrom said.
