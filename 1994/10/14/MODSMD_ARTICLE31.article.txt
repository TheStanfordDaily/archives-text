# Women's soccer to confront Goliath
## 
### Jeremy Stone Staff writer 
Perfection has its rewards.
For the No. 3 Stanford
women's soccer team, the team
with the last perfect record in
NCAA Division I-A, the reward is
the opportunity to meet the pre
eminent dynasty in college sports.
At this weekend's Adidas/
Chevron Texas Challenge Tourna
ment, the Cardinal will go up
against top-ranked North Caroli
na (13-0-1) and fifth-ranked Duke
(11-1-1). Stanford will have its
hands full against both Atlantic
Coast Conference schools. Howev
er, to maintain its unblemished
mark, the Cardinal will have to do
what only one team has done in
the past nine seasons — beat the
Tar Heels.
Stanford will face the task
without the services of goalkeeper
Leslie Garrard, who has not
played all season due to a shoul
der injury. Until recently, the
prognosis for Garrard's return
was improving, but now the
senior's collegiate career may be
over.
"She had another problem in
practice," said head coach lan
Sawyers. "Whatever deadlines we
did have, we're going to have to
push them back a little further."
Fortunately for the Cardinal,
senior Jennifer Poehler has
shined in Garrard's stead.
Her 0.333 goals-against aver
age is third in the nation and first
in the West. However, with only
12 saves in nine games, she has
not yet been tested.
If Duke fails to test her today,
the Tar Heels, who have been shut
out once this decade, will certainly
keep Poehler entertained.
The list of Carolina's accom
plishments resembles an encyclo
pedia that never ends. Here is a
brief glimpse at Volume I:
The Tar Heels boast a 99-game
unbeaten streak dating back to
September 22, 1990, a 3-2 over
time loss to Connecticut. The cur
rent streak is not even the NCAA
record, since the loss to Connecti
cut ended a similar 103-game
string. That's right: UNC has suf
fered one loss in the last 203 con
tests.
North Carolina has won eight con
secutive national championships.
In the 12 years the NCAA has gov
erned the sport, North Carolina
has taken the title every year

except 1985.
Head coach Anson Dorrance, who
started the varsity program from
scratch in 1979, makes Dean
Smith's record look like Dean
Martin's. He is 311-8-10, for an
unheard-of .960 career winning
percentage.
Nobody on the current squad has
ever tasted defeat in a college
game. Of course, the class of 1989

accomplished the same feat.
Despite this impressive list, a
few signs indicate that the
dynasty may be not quite as invin
cible as it once was. A scoreless tie
vs. No. 2 Notre Dame on Sept. 30
ended an NCAA-record 92-game
winning streak and gave the Tar
Heels their worst season in four
years. Twice this year, the Tar
Heel offense has been held under
two goals, something that had not

happened at all since 1991. The
defense, which yielded a school
record 15 goals last year, has sur
rendered four this year, including
two to now-No. 6 Santa Clara,
whom the Cardinal defeated
handily by a score of 3-1 on Sept.
18.
Still, there is no doubt who
Goliath is in the world of women's
soccer. This year's crew has 10

seniors and is paced by two stars
with northern California roots.
Midfielder Tisha Venturini of
Modesto is trying to join 1993
graduate Kristine Lilly among the
only players to be named first
team All-America four times.
Defender/midfielder Keri Sanchez
of San Jose was a 1993 first-team
All-American and is a pre-season
All-American this year.
"Carolina's whole squad is
made up of top players," Sawyers
said. "Venturini's their main
focus; that's who they go through.

So we may ask one of our rookies
to mark her out of the game, who
knows?"
Venturini leads the top-scoring
offense in the nation (4.86 goals
per game) with 12 goals and 10
assists, placing her in a four-way
logjam for sixth place nationally.
Sophomore forward Debbie Keller
is tied for 12th with 11 goals and
eight assists, and senior midfield
er Danielle Egan, a second-team
All-American in 1993, ranks
fourth in the country in assists
with 11.
Defensively, three-year starter
Shelly Finger ranks sixth in the
nation with a 0.430 goals-against
average but has split time with
junior Tracy Noonan, who has

yielded only one goal.
Carolina will open the tourna
ment vs. No. 19 Vanderbilt (11-2)
before trying to put an end to the
nation's second-longest unbeaten
streak, Stanford's 18-game run,
on Sunday. Ironically, the last
Stanford loss came last year at
this very tournament, 3-1, to none
other than North Carolina. (Last
year's NCAA semifinal againt
George Mason, which the Cardi
nal lost on penalty kicks, is offi
cially recorded as a tie.)
Stanford also faced Duke in the
tournament last year, taking a 1-0
win on a goal by current assistant
coach Sarah Rafanelli. This year,
the Blue Devils are led by junior
forward Kelly Walbert, who is

close to shattering Duke's single
season records for goals and
points. With 12 goals and 27
points, she needs three goals and
five points respectively to eclipse
the mark. Her next goal will give
her 28 for her career, which would
also tie a school record.
"Duke had a good recruiting
year," Sawyers said. "They've got
some good players up top and
some good players in the mid
field."
Freshman Andi Melde, a for
ward, and junior midfielder
Katherine Remy, who shares
Duke's career assist record with
Walbert, have added five goals and
seven assists apiece.
The Duke defense has general

ly been successful but showed
signs of weakness in a 5-0 defeat
to Notre Dame. Junior goalkeeper
Melissa Carr has a 0.77 goals
against average on the season.
Although wins against the two
teams would likely vault Stanford
to the top spot in the national
polls, Sawyers downplayed their
significance.
"They're just two games,"
Sawyers said. "You don't get any
more points on the scale if you
beat Carolina. You don't get
looked at any different if you win.
"The key thing for us is to try
and find our playing rhythm."
Sophomore forward Erin Mar
tin echoed Sawyers' sentiments.
"We're going to stick with the

same thing that we've been
doing," Martin said. "We try not
to prepare any differently, because
you try to prepare for every team
like it's the top team."
Statistically, the Cardinal pales
in comparison with both schools.
Stanford has posted 2.89 goals per
game, the lowest in the tourna
ment and only fifth in the Western
Region. Stanford's leading goal
scorer, Martin, has nine goals,
ranking eighth in the West Region
but out of the national leader
board.
"Stats are not a concern, never a
concern," Sawyers said. "The only
stat we worry about is the W stat."
In that statistic, the Cardinal is
perfect.

Region. Stanford's leading goal
scorer, Martin, has nine goals,
ranking eighth in the West Region
but out of the national leader
board.
"Stats are not a concern, never a
concern," Sawyers said. "The only
stat we worry about is the W stat."
In that statistic, the Cardinal is
perfect.
Perfection has its rewards.
For the No. 3 Stanford
women's soccer team, the team
with the last perfect record in
NCAA Division I-A, the reward is
the opportunity to meet the pre
eminent dynasty in college sports.
At this weekend's Adidas/
Chevron Texas Challenge Tourna
ment, the Cardinal will go up
against top-ranked North Caroli
na (13-0-1) and fifth-ranked Duke
(11-1-1). Stanford will have its
hands full against both Atlantic
Coast Conference schools. Howev
er, to maintain its unblemished
mark, the Cardinal will have to do
what only one team has done in
the past nine seasons — beat the
Tar Heels.
Stanford will face the task
without the services of goalkeeper
Leslie Garrard, who has not
played all season due to a shoul
der injury. Until recently, the
prognosis for Garrard's return
was improving, but now the
senior's collegiate career may be
over.
"She had another problem in
practice," said head coach lan
Sawyers. "Whatever deadlines we
did have, we're going to have to
push them back a little further."
Fortunately for the Cardinal,
senior Jennifer Poehler has
shined in Garrard's stead.
Her 0.333 goals-against aver
age is third in the nation and first
in the West. However, with only
12 saves in nine games, she has
not yet been tested.
If Duke fails to test her today,
the Tar Heels, who have been shut
out once this decade, will certainly
keep Poehler entertained.
The list of Carolina's accom
plishments resembles an encyclo
pedia that never ends. Here is a
brief glimpse at Volume I:
The Tar Heels boast a 99-game
unbeaten streak dating back to
September 22, 1990, a 3-2 over
time loss to Connecticut. The cur
rent streak is not even the NCAA
record, since the loss to Connecti
cut ended a similar 103-game
string. That's right: UNC has suf
fered one loss in the last 203 con
tests.
North Carolina has won eight con
secutive national championships.
In the 12 years the NCAA has gov
erned the sport, North Carolina
has taken the title every year

except 1985.
Head coach Anson Dorrance, who
started the varsity program from
scratch in 1979, makes Dean
Smith's record look like Dean
Martin's. He is 311-8-10, for an
unheard-of .960 career winning
percentage.
Nobody on the current squad has
ever tasted defeat in a college
game. Of course, the class of 1989

accomplished the same feat.
Despite this impressive list, a
few signs indicate that the
dynasty may be not quite as invin
cible as it once was. A scoreless tie
vs. No. 2 Notre Dame on Sept. 30
ended an NCAA-record 92-game
winning streak and gave the Tar
Heels their worst season in four
years. Twice this year, the Tar
Heel offense has been held under
two goals, something that had not

happened at all since 1991. The
defense, which yielded a school
record 15 goals last year, has sur
rendered four this year, including
two to now-No. 6 Santa Clara,
whom the Cardinal defeated
handily by a score of 3-1 on Sept.
18.
Still, there is no doubt who
Goliath is in the world of women's
soccer. This year's crew has 10

seniors and is paced by two stars
with northern California roots.
Midfielder Tisha Venturini of
Modesto is trying to join 1993
graduate Kristine Lilly among the
only players to be named first
team All-America four times.
Defender/midfielder Keri Sanchez
of San Jose was a 1993 first-team
All-American and is a pre-season
All-American this year.
"Carolina's whole squad is
made up of top players," Sawyers
said. "Venturini's their main
focus; that's who they go through.

So we may ask one of our rookies
to mark her out of the game, who
knows?"
Venturini leads the top-scoring
offense in the nation (4.86 goals
per game) with 12 goals and 10
assists, placing her in a four-way
logjam for sixth place nationally.
Sophomore forward Debbie Keller
is tied for 12th with 11 goals and
eight assists, and senior midfield
er Danielle Egan, a second-team
All-American in 1993, ranks
fourth in the country in assists
with 11.
Defensively, three-year starter
Shelly Finger ranks sixth in the
nation with a 0.430 goals-against
average but has split time with
junior Tracy Noonan, who has

yielded only one goal.
Carolina will open the tourna
ment vs. No. 19 Vanderbilt (11-2)
before trying to put an end to the
nation's second-longest unbeaten
streak, Stanford's 18-game run,
on Sunday. Ironically, the last
Stanford loss came last year at
this very tournament, 3-1, to none
other than North Carolina. (Last
year's NCAA semifinal againt
George Mason, which the Cardi
nal lost on penalty kicks, is offi
cially recorded as a tie.)
Stanford also faced Duke in the
tournament last year, taking a 1-0
win on a goal by current assistant
coach Sarah Rafanelli. This year,
the Blue Devils are led by junior
forward Kelly Walbert, who is

close to shattering Duke's single
season records for goals and
points. With 12 goals and 27
points, she needs three goals and
five points respectively to eclipse
the mark. Her next goal will give
her 28 for her career, which would
also tie a school record.
"Duke had a good recruiting
year," Sawyers said. "They've got
some good players up top and
some good players in the mid
field."
Freshman Andi Melde, a for
ward, and junior midfielder
Katherine Remy, who shares
Duke's career assist record with
Walbert, have added five goals and
seven assists apiece.
The Duke defense has general

ly been successful but showed
signs of weakness in a 5-0 defeat
to Notre Dame. Junior goalkeeper
Melissa Carr has a 0.77 goals
against average on the season.
Although wins against the two
teams would likely vault Stanford
to the top spot in the national
polls, Sawyers downplayed their
significance.
"They're just two games,"
Sawyers said. "You don't get any
more points on the scale if you
beat Carolina. You don't get
looked at any different if you win.
"The key thing for us is to try
and find our playing rhythm."
Sophomore forward Erin Mar
tin echoed Sawyers' sentiments.
"We're going to stick with the

same thing that we've been
doing," Martin said. "We try not
to prepare any differently, because
you try to prepare for every team
like it's the top team."
Statistically, the Cardinal pales
in comparison with both schools.
Stanford has posted 2.89 goals per
game, the lowest in the tourna
ment and only fifth in the Western
Region. Stanford's leading goal
scorer, Martin, has nine goals,
ranking eighth in the West Region
but out of the national leader
