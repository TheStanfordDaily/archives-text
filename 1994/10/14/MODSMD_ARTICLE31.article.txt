# Women's soccer to confront Goliath

Perfection has its rewards.
For the No. 3 Stanford
women's soccer team, the team
with the last perfect record in
NCAA Division I-A, the reward is
the opportunity to meet the pre
eminent dynasty in college sports.
At this weekend's Adidas/
Chevron Texas Challenge Tourna
ment, the Cardinal will go up
against top-ranked North Caroli
na (13-0-1) and fifth-ranked Duke
(11-1-1). Stanford will have its
hands full against both Atlantic
Coast Conference schools. Howev
er, to maintain its unblemished
mark, the Cardinal will have to do
what only one team has done in
the past nine seasons — beat the
Tar Heels.
Stanford will face the task
without the services of goalkeeper
Leslie Garrard, who has not
played all season due to a shoul
der injury. Until recently, the
prognosis for Garrard's return
was improving, but now the
senior's collegiate career may be
over.
"She had another problem in
practice," said head coach lan
Sawyers. "Whatever deadlines we
did have, we're going to have to
push them back a little further."
Fortunately for the Cardinal,
senior Jennifer Poehler has
shined in Garrard's stead.
Her 0.333 goals-against aver
age is third in the nation and first
in the West. However, with only
12 saves in nine games, she has
not yet been tested.
If Duke fails to test her today,
the Tar Heels, who have been shut
out once this decade, will certainly
keep Poehler entertained.
The list of Carolina's accom
plishments resembles an encyclo
pedia that never ends. Here is a
brief glimpse at Volume I:
The Tar Heels boast a 99-game
unbeaten streak dating back to
September 22, 1990, a 3-2 over
time loss to Connecticut. The cur
rent streak is not even the NCAA
record, since the loss to Connecti
cut ended a similar 103-game
string. That's right: UNC has suf
fered one loss in the last 203 con
tests.
North Carolina has won eight con
secutive national championships.
In the 12 years the NCAA has gov
erned the sport, North Carolina
has taken the title every year

except 1985.
Head coach Anson Dorrance, who
started the varsity program from
scratch in 1979, makes Dean
Smith's record look like Dean
Martin's. He is 311-8-10, for an
unheard-of .960 career winning
percentage.
Nobody on the current squad has
ever tasted defeat in a college
game. Of course, the class of 1989

accomplished the same feat.
Despite this impressive list, a
few signs indicate that the
dynasty may be not quite as invin
cible as it once was. A scoreless tie
vs. No. 2 Notre Dame on Sept. 30
ended an NCAA-record 92-game
winning streak and gave the Tar
Heels their worst season in four
years. Twice this year, the Tar
Heel offense has been held under
two goals, something that had not

happened at all since 1991. The
defense, which yielded a school
record 15 goals last year, has sur
rendered four this year, including
two to now-No. 6 Santa Clara,
whom the Cardinal defeated
handily by a score of 3-1 on Sept.
18.
Still, there is no doubt who
Goliath is in the world of women's
soccer. This year's crew has 10

Sophomore forward Erin Martin muscles her way to the ball against San Diego last weekend. She will
need to be even stronger this weekend to help her team prevail against the No. 1 Tar Heels.
