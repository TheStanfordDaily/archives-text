# Men's soccer to take swing at UW, OSU
## 
### Joseph Hei Staff writer 
The Stanford men's soccer team's season
could be compared to the movement of a pen
dulum.
Currently tied with Washington for second
place in the Mountain Division, the Cardinal
swung to the losing side during pre-conference
play. But in defeating Cal State Sacramento
and tying with the Air Force Academy last
weekend, the Cardinal started what it hopes
will be a movement in the opposite direction.
At Maloney Field today and Sunday, the
Cardinal (2-8-2) must tackle formidable foes
in Washington (8-4-1) and Oregon State (4-6-

2) to maintain the pendulum's shift.
The Beavers, whom the Cardinal faces
today, will launch a very balanced attack. This
season, 12 players have found the back of the
net for OSU, including standout Sterling Wis
mer. Wismer has five goals and 13 points so
far this season.
However, the Cardinal has traditionally
been the stronger team in this match-up. Last
season, the Beavers took a 4-0 beating from
Stanford. In addition, OSU has yet to prove
itself thus far this year.
Admittedly, one division loss of the Beavers
came against Fresno State, the team to beat
this season with a record of 11-1-1 overall and
2-0-1 in conference play. However, Oregon's

other misstep came against Cal State San
Jose, an often victimized team in the confer
ence.
"OSU is sitting with two losses [in the
Divisionl, but they're coming in with a very
good record," said senior midfielder JefT Kogl.
"They have improved tremendously since last
year."
The Huskies come to the Farm as a much
bigger challenge. The battle between Wash
ington and Stanford has see-sawed over the
years, with the Huskies holding a 9-6 edge in
the series. Senior Huskie forward Eric Penner
has led his team in goals, assists and scoring
for the past three seasons, and has
four goals and 10 points so far this
year. Washington will field three
players who are scoring double digits.
The Huskies defeated San Jose
State for their division victory and
I tied Fresno State. This tie broke
the Bulldogs' 10-match winning
streak and is the only "T" on Fres
no's record. However, the only "L"
on the Bulldog's record was dealt
by Stanford earlier this season.
"I think our worst enemy is still
ourselves," Kogl said. "We just
have to come out and battle. We're
basically going to have to fight all
through the match. We're doing
well right now."
Besides concentrating on a pos
itive, winning attitude, another
key factor of Stanford's recent suc
cess has been the solid contribu
tion from freshmen. Midfielders
Eric Vandevelde, Justin Leßlanc
and Filip Vanacht have all played
well for the Cardinal.
"Spring has sprung early,"
head coach Colin Lindores said.
"We are seeing everything now
from the freshman that we nor
mally look at in spring."
Stanford will be looking for the
right combination of young talent,
positive attitude and teamwork
this weekend.
"We really came together as a
team for the last two games," Kogl
said. "If we come together and play
like those matches, then I think
we can do it. We just have to work
hard and stay confident."
