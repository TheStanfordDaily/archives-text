CAPE TOWN, South Africa
(AP) — Witnesses who said they
saw Stanford student Amy Biehl
being stabbed to death made up
their testimony for political rea
sons, the lawyer for the three
defendants said Wednesday.
In his final summation, lawyer
Justice Poswa said the state failed
to prove Mongezi Manqina,
Mzikhona Nofemela and Vusumzi
Ntamo killed Biehl, a Fulbright
scholar from Newport Beach,
Calif
The three have pleaded inno
cent to charges of murder, public
violence and robbery. They could
face the death sentence if convict
ed of murder. Judge Gerald Fried
man said he would announce his
verdict on Oct. 24.
Biehl, 26, was beaten and
stabbed to death in Guguletu
township outside Cape Town on
Aug. 25, 1993.
Poswa said three black women
who testified in closed court they
saw Manqina and Nofemela stab
bing Biehl made up the story
because they supported the
African National Congress and
wanted to harm the defendants,
who belonged to the rival Pan
Africanist Students' Organiza
tion.

The women, who agreed to testi
fy in closed court to avoid being
identified publicly, said they saw
Manqina and Nofemela stabbing
Biehl after she had fled from her
car and run to a gas station for help.
Poswa said it was strange the
women never mentioned seeing
Ntamo, who admitted in a confes
sion accepted by the court that he
struck Biehl with a brick.
If the women had not testified,
Manqina would have been acquit
ted while Nofemela could only
have been convicted of malicious
damage to property, Poswa said.
Most of the 11-month trial
involved a separate hearing on
whether the defendants were
forced by police to make state
ments.
Friedman accepted the written
confessions of Ntamo, who said
he had thrown stones at Biehl's
car, and Ntamo, who said he hit
her on the head three times with a
brick.
Only Manqina testified in his
own defense, denying he was pre
sent when Biehl was killed. Poswa
said that according to South
Africa's new constitution, Ntamo
and Nofemela had the right to
avoid testifying and could not be
penalized for that decision.

While judges can still impose
the death sentence, South Africa
has suspended executions pend
ing a decision by the new govern
ment formed after the nation's
first all-race election in April.
Justice Minister Dullah Omar
said Tuesday he expected the sus
pension of executions to continue
and for executions eventually to
be banned under the new consti
tution that took effect with the
election.
