# Hold your horses
## Equestrians to begin season 
### Emery Chen Staff writer 
The Stanford Equestrian team
could ride off into the sunset Sat
urday. However, the team would
have to eventually return the
horses to their rightful owners.
The club team is traveling to
Fresno State for its first show of
the year. Starting at 10 a.m., rid
ers will compete in various events
including jumping, English fiat,
and walk/trot against some of the
top regional competition.
Nine teams will vie for the title
including the host, Oregon, Uni
versity of Nevada at Reno, UC-
Davis, Cal Poly Pomona and
use.
To ensure fairness in the show,
the teams will not know which
horses they will be riding on until
the draw. The draw, which
matches horses and riders, will
take place just before the compe
tition commences.
"This is done . . . collegiately
so that it determines the best
rider, not the one that can afford
the best horse," said senior Quito
Perlman. "Judging is on the
rider's ability to control the horse
and perform the various tasks
asked by the judges."
Another interesting feature in
the show is the hidden rider. Each
coach designates or points to a
rider for each event and that
rider's score is used to tabulate
the team total. The chosen ones
are kept secret.

"This is good because there is
less pressure on the riders this
way," Perlman said.
The team is coached by Gwyn
Gordon, also responsible for co
founding the team 10 years ago.
Two years ago, Stanford finished
second in the region and last year
it finished fifth.

We don't know how good
the competition is going
to be but we expect to
have a strong season.'

Over 30 members are on the
roster with 15 of them traveling
to the show. The team has a wide
range of equestrian experience
from people who are currently
riding on the circuit to beginners.
Some of the top riders on the
team include Pascaline Cure, a
freshman who will ride in the
English open division, and senior
Duane Kracke, who will compete
in the Western Open.
A top rider, Amanda Hoche,
will not appear for the Cardinal
since she is currently on the East
Coast competing on the circuit.
Despite her absence, Perlman
expects the team to perform well.
"We don't know how good the
competition is going to be but we
expect to have a strong season,"
Perlman said.
