# Hockey to play in encore
## Stanford to battle Cal for NorPac lead 
### Ratha Harntha Contributing Writer 
Everything is on the line this weekend for the
Stanford field hockey team when it faces Northern
Pacific Conference leader California at Berkeley this
Saturday.
"It's do or die to stay alive for [the NCAA Cham
pionships], ' said senior tri-captain Tina Syer.
In order to make the playoffs, Stanford must win
NorPac. Last Saturday's 3-1 loss to the University of
Pacific dropped the Cardinal to 2-2 in the confer
ence, one game behind the 3-1 Bears. Having split

their first two games, the winner of tomorrow's
game will own the tie-breaker. Stanford must win to
have any chance at winning the division. If it loses,
California will essentially have an insurmountable
three-game lead because of the tie-breaker.
The Cardinal will be at a disadvantage this week
end playing on California's astroturf. Stanford prac
tices and plays its home games on grass and is used
to the natural surface. The ball travels much more
quickly on turf, so passes have to be very accurate or
the ball will go out-of-bounds.
"We don't get to practice on turf," head coach
Sheryl Johnson said. "It will be a factor."
The first game between the two teams on Sept. 16
was at Berkeley and the Bears prevailed, 3-0. In
their most recent meeting on Oct. 1, the Cardinal
won, 3-1, on Stanford's grass.
"We know how they play and they know how we
play," sophomore midfielder Amy Marfil said. "We
have improved a lot since the last time we played on
turf."
Another disadvantage for the Cardinal is that
junior midfielder and tri-captain Elise Morgan will
not be able to play. She partially tore her lateral col
lateral ligament in last Friday's game against Davis
and Elkins. In Stanford's six games without Mor
gan, it has won just one. However, the Cardinal
played five of those matches on its tough eastern
trip, where it faced teams such as No. 1 North Car
olina.
Morgan has great control of the ball and is an
excellent passer, according to Syer. "Elise is instru
mental," she said.
Although the loss of Morgan will affect the team,
it is just one of many factors, according to Johnson.
Even if Morgan could compete, the rest of the team
still has to step up and play strongly.
Sophomore Baochi Nguyen will move from her
regular forward spot and take Morgan's place at
midfield.
"Baochi is a weapon we didn't know we had up
front," Syer said.
However, with Morgan's injury, the Cardinal is
not only losing field hockey skills, but also the tri
captain's experience. The team is very young with
five freshmen and six sophomores, and though these
players have matured over the season, they have yet
to play a game with this much on the line.
"We must be smart," Syer said.
Specifically, the key to the match-up will be
whether the Cardinal can adjust to the field condi
tions and maintain control of the ball at midfield.
Warm-ups will be very important for the Cardinal
because it will be the team's time to get in sync on
the turf. With the quicker ball, the Cardinal must
get its shots and passes off quickly.
"This game is huge," Marfil said. "Lose and there
is no post-season."
