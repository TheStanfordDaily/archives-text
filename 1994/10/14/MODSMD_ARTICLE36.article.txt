## Alumni swimmers challenge current Cardinal 
### Cindy Buchner Contributing Writer 
The Stanford men's and
women's swimming teams' first
meet this weekend may be the only
one they are in jeopardy of losing.
At 9 a.m. Saturday mourning,
the Cardinal will take on its prede
cessors in the annual Alumni
Meet at deGuerre Pool. The com
petition is unique in that the races
will only be sprints and relays.
Senior co-captain Becky Crowe
described the easy-going attitude

behind the meet. "It is basically a
fun opportunity to meet the
alumni."
Nearly 20 women alumni are
expected to race, including
Olympians Janel Jorgenson and
Susan van der Lippe. Van der
Lippe was better known as Susan
Itapp while at Stanford.
Olympians Pablo Morales and
John Moffet are rumored to be
joining the alumni men. And
could always always surprise
alumni.
The men's student team has a

long-standing record of losing to
the alumni. Senior co-captain
Kurt Grote attributed this fact to
the workout that precedes the
meet, the speed of the alumni
and questionable scoring tech
niques.
Crowe remembers the alumni
taking liberties such as running
the 200 yard relay with eight peo
ple each swimming half the dis
tance of the legal four person team.
"It seems no matter how well
we are doing, we are losing," said
Grote.
