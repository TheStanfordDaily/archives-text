# Lead lawsuit settled

### Crystal Carreon 
Stanford settled a lawsuit out of court yes
terday contending that the University failed
to notify families in Escondido Village of pos
sible exposure to hazardous levels of lead.
The suit — filed by a former grad student
and an environmental law firm — contend
ed that the University violated Proposition
65, the Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Act.
Former Law School student Sarah Den
nison- Leonard, her husband Charles and
their daughter Carlie, along with the Oak
land-based Environmental Law Founda
tion, Fded the suit in Santa Clara County in
December 1992.
Under terms of the settlement, which go
into effect in two weeks, Stanford will pro
vide warnings and educational material to
student parents about the dangers of lead,
implement an inspection program to ad
dress paint damage in apartments as it is re
ported, provide free blood tests to Escondido
residents under the age of seven
and pay a $166,265 "settlement
sum" to the plaintiffs.
"Stanford has taken a very pos
itive step to prevent childhood
lead poisoning. This agreement
contains key elements which
should be included in any pro
gram to reduce lead hazards in
California's housing," Ellen
Widess, Executive Director of
Lead Safe California said in a
statement.
In terms of helping to educate
the public, Susan Jordan, Super
vising Attorney for ELF, likewise
commended the University.
"This agreement puts Stanford
in front of other private housing
units as far as addressing public
health," she said.
Although the settlement does
oblige the University to "provide
all current residents of 'family
units' at the Escondido Housing
complex" guidelines for reducing
possible exposure to lead hazards,
University Senior Counsel Lee
Thompson maintains that Stan
ford "would have done this any
way," even without the threat of a
lawsuit.

"It seems to me that [the set
tlement] is not a big story. I don't
think that we are in a position
that is very different from where
we would be anyway," Thompson
said. "Before the suit was filed,
Stanford actually began a lead
management program."
He said that Stanford has
taken a "pro-active" role in
redressing the Dennison-
Leonards' and the Environmental
Law Foundation's concerns over
lead levels in relation to Proposi
tion 65. The proposition, passed
by California voters in 1986, pro
vides certain standards for notify
ing individuals of possible health
risks in public areas.
According to Thompson, the
two year hiatus between when the
suit was filed and the agreement
arrived at yesterday, is due in part
to mixed interpretations over the
proposition's meaning.
"The plaintiffs thought that if
you can detect lead in the paint,
then that triggers Proposition 65.
That was their point," he said.
Since the lawsuit was filed,
according to a statement from the
Environmental Law Foundation
offices, significant improvements
have been made at Escondido.
However, the Dennison-
Leonards question the motives
behind the changes. In a tele

phone interview from his home
in Lake Oswego, Ore., Charles
Dennison-Leonard said that he
believes the University has been
lackluster in addressing the
potential lead hazard in Escondi
do from the start. He said he is
pleased with the settlement, but
that he is still somewhat "bit
ter."
Regarding his experiences with
the University, Charles Denni
son-Leonard said that, beginning
in the fall of 1991, he and his wife
had concerns over possible lead
hazards in their apartment
because it was an old building in
which lead-based paint on the
walls was suspect.
At the time, Sarah Dennison-
Leonard said the University took
some lead samples of the area and
subsequently added their apart
ment to a study which Stanford
was conducting in Escondido.
The University maintained
that there was no problem with
the lead amounts found in the
home, Charles Dennison-Leonard
said. However, Sarah said that
the fluoroscope — the device used
to detect lead — did indeed pick
up varying degrees of lead on the
wall and floors of the apartment,
and this concerned her.
Sarah said that the University
remained "generally unrespon

sive" to her concerns.
In June 1992, an intent to sue
was filed.
"They weren't doing anything
until we filed the suit," Sarah
said. "They were doing some
things [as far as testing for lead)
but they didn't think to test the
swing sets and playground where
the children were playing, or the
radiator covers in the apartments.
The highest levels of lead were
found there."
According to a statement from
the Environmental Law Founda
tion, the testing of the playground
equipment, sand and benches
with peeling lead paint "showed
that most, but not all lead levels
were low, but still exceeded Cali
fornia's strict Prop. 65 stan
dards."
Although the lawsuit was set
tled in court, Sarah Dennison-
Leonard, who graduated in June
1994, remains unsettled in her
opinion of Stanford University.
"Settlements are compromises;
neither side gets what [itj hopes
for," she said. "Now that it's
done, I hope that [the University]
will address situations because
it's the right thing to do, not
because of a lawsuit."
"1 worry, not only about my
child, but other people's children
in Escondido Village."
