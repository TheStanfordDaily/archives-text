# Where
## to start 
### Elise Wolfgram 
So you want a positive cash flow,
health benefits and company par
ties and picnics. You want to leave
the cozy world of academics and
become one of those suits who eats
frozen TV dinners because you're too
tired to cook. And you're really hoping
that the $100,000 your parents forked
over will pay off.
Well, your plan just may work out
with a little effort on your part. In fact,
finding a job is more time consuming
than it is difficult. And knowing where
to start is a big part of the answer.
The best place at Stanford to get
started is the Career Planning and
Placement Center, which is located
next to the Clock Tower near White
Plaza. The CPPC is not just a haven
for investment banker wannabes, but
has loads of information on every
thing from public service careers to
alumni contacts.
The easiest way to become familiar
with the CPPC is to attend a "Getting
Started at the CPPC" workshop. The
half-hour session includes a slide
show and a tour of the CPPC (there is
no tour for introductions held outside
of the CPPC). Upcoming workshops at
the CPPC will be held on Oct. 17, Oct.
21, Oct. 27 and Nov. 1.
Once you're familiar with the
CPPC's resources and layout, it's best
just to dive in and start figuring out
what you want to do, what kind of
company you would like to work for,
and where you want to be. There are
numerous resources within the CPPC
to help you with this.
One option is to sign up for a work
shop on the Strong Interest Inventory.
This may help you better define careers
that are well-suited for you. The next
inventory workshop is on Oct. 19,
The CPPC also offers counseling for
job hunters. These sessions come in
two forms: 45-minute sessions with a
CPPC counselor and same-day, 15
minute appointments for quick ques
tions. The longer session is intended to
help students assess their interests,
skills and values; identify goals and
objectives; translate that information
into a meaningful career or first job;
and help the student understand the
nuts and bolts of obtaining such a job.
Appointments for either type of coun
seling can be made by calling 725-
1789. Same-day appointments fill up

early, so it's best to call right when the
CPPC opens at 8:30 a.m.
Another great resource the CPPC
has to offer is the Career Resource
Library. The library has two main
parts, both of which are very useful to
job hunters.
The Career Exploration area con
tains information on hundreds of
careers and is aimed at helping you
figure what you want to do. The mate
rials in this section provide back
ground information on different
careers. Once you know what careers
you are interested in, it's probably
time to move on to the job search area
of the library. Also included in the
Career Exploration area are handouts
on careers by major, and information
on alumni to contact. Several fields are

wannabes, but has

public service careers
to alumni contacts.

covered,including Arts/Media/ Com
munication, Business, Education,
Engineering/Computer
Science, Environment, Health/Sciences/
Biotechnology, Law, and Public Service.
In the Job Search area, there are
binders of currently available jobs,
both full-time and part-time. In addi
tion, there are several "how-to" books
on writing resumes and cover letters
and finding employment in specific
geographical areas.
Other resources in the library
include a Media Room with audio
tapes of several important CPPC
events, the Rainbow File (which
includes information on over 500
selected nonprofit and public organi
zations), and Multicultural Resources
which is aimed at helping students in
minority communities.
After searching through piles of
binders, many students decide to take
part in on-campus recruiting. Over
400 companies and organizations —

in fields ranging from management
consulting to engineering — come to
Stanford each year with the hopes of
hiring a few soon to be graduates.
In order to participate in on campus
recruiting, students must attend a 90-
minute introduction or watch a video
tape of the introduction to take part in
the program. A videotape will be
shown on Oct. 17.
Students who take part in on-campus
recruiting should begin doing their
research now. Interviews begin on Oct.
24 and will continue until the end of the
year. There are two ways to get an
interview at the CPPC: through
Employee Preselect, where the company
chooses to interview you, and through a
bid process. More information on this
process is available at the CPPC.
Recruiting, contrary to popular
belief, is not the number one way stu
dents find jobs. As far as careers in
public service go, the CPPC will hold
a public service career and internship
faire on Jan. 31. There will also be a
workshop on "Breaking in to a Public
Service Career" on Oct. 18.
The CPPC also hosts World
Opportunities Week from Oct. 31 to
Nov. 4. The week includes numerous
workshops on topics such as interna
tional law, international public ser
vice, and international banking.
In addition to the CPPC, a similar
organization, the Career Action
Center in Palo Alto, can assist you in
your search for the wonder-job. The
center has an extensive library, com
pany descriptions and job listings.
The center also maintains network
ing groups and offers workshops on
such topics as creativity, the biotech
industry, international marketing
and career mastery for African
Americans. There are membership
costs to use the Career Action Center.
Students should call 324-1710 for
more information.
Regardless of the route students
plan to take to find a job after gradua
tion, the most important thing is to
start early. A typical job search lasts
several months and can last up to a
year or more.
Finally, keep in mind that your first
job after Stanford probably won't be
your last. In fact, the typical Stanford
grad stays at his or her first job for
only two years.
The Career Action Center is located
at 445 Sherman Ave. in Palo Alto. It's
open Monday, Wednesday and Friday
from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Tuesday and
Thursday 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. and
Saturday, for members only, from 9
a.m. to 1 p.m. One-year memberships
cost $65, and one-day user fees are
$10. There is a 30-minute orientation
every day at 10 a.m.

shown on Oct. 17.
Students who take part in on-campus
recruiting should begin doing their
research now. Interviews begin on Oct.
24 and will continue until the end of the
year. There are two ways to get an
interview at the CPPC: through
Employee Preselect, where the company
chooses to interview you, and through a
bid process. More information on this
process is available at the CPPC.
Recruiting, contrary to popular
belief, is not the number one way stu
dents find jobs. As far as careers in
public service go, the CPPC will hold
a public service career and internship
faire on Jan. 31. There will also be a
workshop on "Breaking in to a Public
Service Career" on Oct. 18.
The CPPC also hosts World
Opportunities Week from Oct. 31 to
Nov. 4. The week includes numerous
workshops on topics such as interna
tional law, international public ser
vice, and international banking.
In addition to the CPPC, a similar
organization, the Career Action
Center in Palo Alto, can assist you in
your search for the wonder-job. The
center has an extensive library, com
pany descriptions and job listings.
The center also maintains network
ing groups and offers workshops on
such topics as creativity, the biotech
industry, international marketing
and career mastery for African
Americans. There are membership
costs to use the Career Action Center.
Students should call 324-1710 for
more information.
Regardless of the route students
plan to take to find a job after gradua
tion, the most important thing is to
start early. A typical job search lasts
several months and can last up to a
year or more.
Finally, keep in mind that your first
job after Stanford probably won't be
your last. In fact, the typical Stanford
grad stays at his or her first job for
only two years.
The Career Action Center is located
at 445 Sherman Ave. in Palo Alto. It's
open Monday, Wednesday and Friday
from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Tuesday and
Thursday 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. and
Saturday, for members only, from 9
a.m. to 1 p.m. One-year memberships
cost $65, and one-day user fees are
$10. There is a 30-minute orientation
every day at 10 a.m.
So you want a positive cash flow,
health benefits and company par
ties and picnics. You want to leave
the cozy world of academics and
become one of those suits who eats
frozen TV dinners because you're too
tired to cook. And you're really hoping
that the $100,000 your parents forked
over will pay off.
Well, your plan just may work out
with a little effort on your part. In fact,
finding a job is more time consuming
than it is difficult. And knowing where
to start is a big part of the answer.
The best place at Stanford to get
started is the Career Planning and
Placement Center, which is located
next to the Clock Tower near White
Plaza. The CPPC is not just a haven
for investment banker wannabes, but
has loads of information on every
thing from public service careers to
alumni contacts.
The easiest way to become familiar
with the CPPC is to attend a "Getting
Started at the CPPC" workshop. The
half-hour session includes a slide
show and a tour of the CPPC (there is
no tour for introductions held outside
of the CPPC). Upcoming workshops at
the CPPC will be held on Oct. 17, Oct.
21, Oct. 27 and Nov. 1.
Once you're familiar with the
CPPC's resources and layout, it's best
just to dive in and start figuring out
what you want to do, what kind of
company you would like to work for,
and where you want to be. There are
numerous resources within the CPPC
to help you with this.
One option is to sign up for a work
shop on the Strong Interest Inventory.
This may help you better define careers
that are well-suited for you. The next
inventory workshop is on Oct. 19,
The CPPC also offers counseling for
job hunters. These sessions come in
two forms: 45-minute sessions with a
CPPC counselor and same-day, 15
minute appointments for quick ques
tions. The longer session is intended to
help students assess their interests,
skills and values; identify goals and
objectives; translate that information
into a meaningful career or first job;
and help the student understand the
nuts and bolts of obtaining such a job.
Appointments for either type of coun
seling can be made by calling 725-
1789. Same-day appointments fill up

early, so it's best to call right when the
CPPC opens at 8:30 a.m.
Another great resource the CPPC
has to offer is the Career Resource
Library. The library has two main
parts, both of which are very useful to
job hunters.
The Career Exploration area con
tains information on hundreds of
careers and is aimed at helping you
figure what you want to do. The mate
rials in this section provide back
ground information on different
careers. Once you know what careers
you are interested in, it's probably
time to move on to the job search area
of the library. Also included in the
Career Exploration area are handouts
on careers by major, and information
on alumni to contact. Several fields are

covered,including Arts/Media/ Com
munication, Business, Education,
Engineering/Computer
Science, Environment, Health/Sciences/
Biotechnology, Law, and Public Service.
In the Job Search area, there are
binders of currently available jobs,
both full-time and part-time. In addi
tion, there are several "how-to" books
on writing resumes and cover letters
and finding employment in specific
geographical areas.
Other resources in the library
include a Media Room with audio
tapes of several important CPPC
events, the Rainbow File (which
includes information on over 500
selected nonprofit and public organi
zations), and Multicultural Resources
which is aimed at helping students in
minority communities.
After searching through piles of
binders, many students decide to take
part in on-campus recruiting. Over
400 companies and organizations —

in fields ranging from management
consulting to engineering — come to
Stanford each year with the hopes of
hiring a few soon to be graduates.
In order to participate in on campus
recruiting, students must attend a 90-
minute introduction or watch a video
tape of the introduction to take part in
the program. A videotape will be
shown on Oct. 17.
