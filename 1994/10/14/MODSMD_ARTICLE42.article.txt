# The
						resume: Just a piece of paper?

### Elise Wolfgram 
It may just be a piece of paper, but
a resume is probably the first impres
sion you will make upon a company
for whom you wish to work. Within
that one page you want to entice the
employer into meeting with you.
Resume writing is a difficult task,
yet with a little work and guidance an

exceptional resume can be created.
There are a few simple rules to keep
in mind that can make the difference
between an average resume and one
that stands out.
"Employers want to be able to iden
tify key skills you've developed or
used elsewhere which you could apply

to the new job," according to A 1 Levin,
assistant director of graduate coun
seling and programs at the Career
Planning and Placement Center.
These skills are what should be high
lighted in a resume.
