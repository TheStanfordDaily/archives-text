# The 						resume: Just a piece of paper?

### Elise Wolfgram 
It may just be a piece of paper, but
a resume is probably the first impres
sion you will make upon a company
for whom you wish to work. Within
that one page you want to entice the
employer into meeting with you.
Resume writing is a difficult task,
yet with a little work and guidance an

exceptional resume can be created.
There are a few simple rules to keep
in mind that can make the difference
between an average resume and one
that stands out.
"Employers want to be able to iden
tify key skills you've developed or
used elsewhere which you could apply

to the new job," according to A 1 Levin,
assistant director of graduate coun
seling and programs at the Career
Planning and Placement Center.
These skills are what should be high
lighted in a resume.

Although it is tempting to pack
one's resume with everything one has
ever done, it is important to remem
ber that employers will probably look
at each resume for 10 to 20 seconds.
Therefore, being concise and high
lighting your strongest experience is
more important than including every
detail. A resume should not be more
than one page.
The first thing to do when you're
writing your resume is to choose a
format. This is important because it
will help determine what you will
and will not include in your resume.
There are three standard formats for
a resume: chronological, functional
and combination.
A chronological resume lists one's
experience starting with the most
recent and moving backwards in
time. This resume is most useful for
people with strong histories of direct
ly relevant experiences. It is also the
most commonly used.
A functional resume organizes
your most relevant experiences into
skill areas or functions. This resume
is especially effective if you are
searching for a job in a field which is

well-matched with your experience.
Finally, a combination resume is a
combination of the chronological and
functional resumes and often lists
experience according to theme areas.
If you choose this format, be sure
your most relevant and impressive
qualifications are near the top of the
resume.
When choosing a resume format, be
sure to keep your reader in mind. It is
necessary to decide whether an
emphasis on education, employment
experience and titles — all including
dates — is more important, or
whether a format emphasizing skills
rather than details, or a combination
of both styles, is better for you.
Once you have chosen a format
and begun writing, there are several
points to keep in mind. Some of
these are to be sure to use active
verbs and descriptive phrases as
much as possible; to print out the
resume on good quality bond paper,
either white or conservative tones;
and to use bold, italics and underlin
ing minimally so they stand out on
the page.
At the top of your resume should
be your name centered in bold print.
Below that should be your address

and telephone numbers. Some people
include both their permanent
address and their school address. If
you are looking for a job in a particu
lar geographical area and want the
employer to know where you're from,
it's beneficial to include your perma
nent address.
If you're looking for a position in a
specific job field, students may want
to opt for a "job objective" heading in
their resume. By designating a some
what specific job title, two skills
which you would like to use in that
particular job, and emphasizing the
general type of company you are
interested in working for, you can
highlight a certain degree of focus in
their search.
Finally, it is important to remem
ber that the resume is merely an
introduction for employers, acting
more as an outline of work experi
ence and personal skills. Be sure to
write a good cover letter as well to
convey your interests, goals and
objectives, to fill in the gaps in a
resume and give a more personal
touch to the job process.
Then maybe, just maybe, you'll be
lucky enough to have the bills and
cash start rolling in.
