# Surviving the third degree: the job interview
## 
### Rajiv Chandrasekaran 
Three years of resume packing.
Three weeks of shopping for the
perfect suit. Three days of ago
nizing over your resume: Palatino, or
Times?
Three hours combing your hair.
And it all comes down to the next 15
minutes.
Sure, going to all those get-acquaint
ed-at-the-CPPC workshops was time
consuming, getting the Mac in your
computer cluster to properly format
your resume made you scream, and
receiving one of those oh-so-tiny rejec
tion postcards felt worse than bombing
a final.
But, according to those who have
gone career hunting, the interview is
undoubtedly the most harrowing expe
rience along the path to a $40,000-a
-year, BMW-in-the-garage, I-got-the
best-job-among-my-friends existence.
It's also the most important, they
say.
"A resume and a cover letter is sim
ply a way to get an interview. The
interview really decides whether or
not you get the job," says Kathy
Campbell of the Career Planning and
Placement Center. "If you don't come
across well in an interview, you don't
get the job."

'When people ask you
a question about
yourself, it shouldn't
appear like you've
never thought about
it.'

To be more than just another name
in a thick stack of resumes, you must
leave a strong — positive — impres
sion with the interviewer. That sort of
"success" isn't that hard, say career
counselors. The key, they maintain, is
preparation.
"Before you go into an interview —
just like an exam — do your home
work," says Campbell, who teaches an

interviewing-skills workshop at the
CPPC. "An interview is not the time to
learn about an organization."
She advises interviewees to research
three specific areas:
• Themselves. Job hunters should
sit down and think about their skills,
occupations that interest them, what
they do well and what they have to
offer an employer, among other topics.
"When people ask you a question
about yourself, it shouldn't appear like
you've never thought about it,"says
Campbell.
• The occupation. "Know about the
field you want to go into," says
Campbell. "What is a typical day like?
What skills are needed?"
She advises interviewees to contact
Stanford graduates for a real-life per
spective on potential careers. The
CPPC and Bowman Alumni House
have binders with alumni contact
numbers which are available for stu
dents to browse through.
The CPPC also has books, pam
phlets and other information on a vari
ety of careers.
• The employer. Career counselors
suggest job hunters familiarize
themselves with a corporation before
the interviewing process. "The

employer wants to think you want to
work for them," says Campbell. "If
they leave literature [at the CPPC],
read it."
Recommended reading includes
annual reports, informational
brochures and news articles about new
products or large changes in the com
pany. The CPPC keeps some informa
tion on file, but Campbell recommends
a trip to the library at the Graduate
School of Business. The library's
Rosenberg Collection has information
regarding a myriad of companies,
including articles and annual reports,
available on CD-ROM.
Although this research process is
often tedious and seemingly useless,
career counselors and those on the
other side of the table —job interview
ers — strongly recommend it.
"Preparation is the biggest thing,"
says Greg Paquin, a senior employ
ment consultant with Apple
Computer's research and development
group. "You don't have to read 401-Ks,
but you should know the basic infor
mation."
That knowledge, Paquin says, will
be helpful when the interviewer asks
