# To hire or not to hire
## The 						ups and downs of the job application process 
### Angie Chuang 
Anyone searching the job market
today will soon become accustomed
to fielding a lot of questions. And
while there may not be right or
wrong answers on job applications,
some are more right than others.
Very specific questions, on subjects
ranging from salary to software, can
have a strong influence on an
employer's decision to hire or not to
hire — and applicants sometimes
have to pull out some quick pop psy
chology to answer them.
A pamphlet published by Nelson
Personnel Services in
Menlo Park offers sug

gestions on answer
ing the question

that's sure to
make all job
seekers squirm

"What kind of
salary are you
looking for?'

An applicant
should not commit to a

specific figure, but
instead ask for the salary
range for the position
Aii : : i. _ t*T» i

Otherwise, write, "I m look
ing for a fair and equitable

salary in line with what is
comparable with other positions in
the area," the pamphlet advises.
Before answering the personal
character questions, such as "Why do
you want to join our company?" and
"What are your strengths and weak
nesses?" the pamphlet recommends
that job-seekers do a little homework.
Research the specific company to
prepare for the former, it suggests.
And comment on yourself by empha
sizing strengths and turning weak
nesses into positive statements for
the latter.
Soft for software
Some skills that may at first seem
peripheral often take center stage in
the hiring process.

For instance, computer expertise is
a bog boon for job-hunters, according
to David Hamilton of Manpower
Temporary Services, who said
employers often want to know which
computer software an applicant
wants to use.
He said manpower offers training
in various types of software, but that
"the more versed in different soft
ware an applicant is," the better.
Hamilton recommends undergrad
uates "dabble in as many different
kinds of software as possible [and]
be fluent in all sorts of weird stuff

— keep abreast of new soft
ware."
Right now, the most popular
kinds of software used by employ
ers are Microsoft Word and Excel for
the Macintosh and Word Perfect,
Lotus and Windows for the IBM,
according to Hamilton.
'How do you feel today?'
Amid the more technical questions,
Hamilton said he has always
found one of his company's stan
dard questions unusual and
somewhat amusing. "We have this
mood question that basical
ly asks, 'How do you feel
today?' " he said. "There are
choices that the applicant
checks off ranging from 'very
good and professional' to
'lousy, sick and ornery.' "
While most of the informa
tion requested by potential
employers is fairly straight
forward, job-seekers will occa
sionally encounter such unex
pected questions — ranging
from the obscure to the illegal.
Tina Galvin of Personnel
Solutions Palo Alto — a job
placement agency — said char
acter questions tend to catch recent
graduates off-guard because they
require abstract answers and a bit of
soul-searching.

"Questions like 'What motivates
you as a person?' can require a little
more thought than the typical educa

tional background and pr«

ous employer questior

Galvin said.
A recent
graduate inter
ested in working
in "grassroots"
public service jobs,
said one of the more
thought-provoking

questions she is often
asked is, "What is your

commitment to your com
munity?"

Watching for what's illegal

Although employers can get
very specific in their questions,
some areas are legally off-limits.
For instance, employers cannot ask
for information as seemingly basic as
age and marital status in applica
tions, questionnaires or interviews,
said Steve Burke of Personnel
Solutions, adding that these prohibi
tions are based on "about half a
dozen different anti-discrimination
laws."
But neither employers nor
applicants tend to be aware of
these nuances in federal and state
employment law, Burke said.
The fact that employers can
find out much of the illegal infor
mation anyway — through tax
forms once someone is hired —
complicates the situation, he
added.
Furthermore, employers can
phrase questions in different
ways to elicit illegal informa
tion from an applicant in a
legal manner.
"An employer cannot ask someone
whether or not they have a car, but
they can ask, 'How would you plan on
getting to work?' " Burke explained.
