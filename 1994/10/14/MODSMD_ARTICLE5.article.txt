# EV residents, staff still have some worries

Yesterday'a settlement by the Uni
versity over lead paint in Escondido Vil
lage may have ended one couple's two
year struggle, but some graduate stu
dents living in the residences say they
are far from satisfied.
The conditions of yesterday's settle
ment — which include a payment of
$166,000 and the implementation of free
blood tests for Escondido children — do
not provide for lead removal, but ensure
that current and incoming residents will
be warned of the lead in their homes.
"It's no small thing," said plaintiff
Charles Dennison-Leonard of the new
warning. He said it had been extremely
difficult to obtain information
from the University about lead
when he and hia wife first became
concerned about their daughter's
exposure. New residents will now
have an extended warning to read
and sign when they come to pick
up their keys.
Janet Gleason, the Health and
Safety Coordinator for Housing
and Dining Services, has been
working closely with the Escondi
do Village Family Council on the
lead issue and was pleased with
the outcome.
M I think Stanford feels this is a
positive settlement, and that they
feel the most important thing is
people have all the information to
make their own choices," Gleason
said.
Director of Housing and Din
ing Services Keith Guy agreed
that the notification agreement
was a satisfactory outcome of the
suit.
"We're pleased to have the set
tlement completed at this point,"
Guy said. "We're happy that the
outcome will allow us to improve
service to families in the Village."
Guy added that he believes the
situation there is "minimal in
terms of any danger."
Charles Dennison-Leonard
said, however, that he wished the
University had gone further to
remove lead sources. Although
lead-painted swingsets and
benches have been removed, he
said he was disappointed the Uni
versity had opted for the less per
manent solution of repair rather
than removal of radiator covers
and screen doors, some of which
are in bad repair.
Gleason said she feels Stanford
already has an adequate system
to deal with such problems.
"What we've consistently felt was

an appropriate procedure was
that if we found paint in poor con
dition, that was above [the legally
acceptable) lead content, and that
was accessible to children, we
removed it."
The University will deal with
doors and radiator covers on a
similar case-by-case basis. "If
people see anything they want
investigated, they can call," Glea
son said. She said that while rou
tine six-month maintenance
checks would be possible, it could
be difficult both to perform
checks and to respond promptly
to complaints.
According to members of
Escondido Village's Family Coun
cil, however, lack of a regular
maintenance program remains
the chief problem there.
"This suit will not change
their maintenance schedule,"
said Benson Honig, representa
tive to the Family Council. "I've
been here five years and never
had a single maintenance inspec
tion."
Family Council Chair Jim
Hansen agreed that the settle
ment was not a particularly great
victory for Escondido Village resi
dents.
"I don't expect there's going to
be a lot of difference in the way
[University officials] respond to
things," Hansen said of the set
tlement. "It doesn't call for them
to do anything other than notifi
cation. Quite frankly, I don't
think [that is] very much skin off
their nose."
Hansen said he hoped the law
suit would encourage Stanford to
get into a more preventive mind
set rather than simply "putting
out fires" after a problem has
developed.
Guy said, however, that at pre
sent there are no additional pro
grams planned "that would alert
us to (problems] that aren't
brought to our attention through
the normal process."
