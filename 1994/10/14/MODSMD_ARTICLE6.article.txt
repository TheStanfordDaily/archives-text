## Neo-Nazi insider tells story of hate 
### Brian Singer 
A search for diamonds and the increasing Neo-
Nazi movement in Germany — on the surface the
two may seem completely unconnected.
Enter Yaron Svoray. A whimsical search for dia
monds along the French-German border paved his
road to reporting on the aggrandizement of Neo-
Nazis to the entire world.
Svoray, who infiltrated Germany between 1992
and 1993 under the name Ron Furey, spoke of his
penetration of the Neo-Nazi movement and his book
"In Hitler's Shadow" yesterday before 150 people in
Kresge Auditorium.
"The Germans don't know what is happening to
them," he said. "I saw [racism and hate] on an hourly
basis."
After moving to the U.S. from his native Israel,
Svoray — who was then an American journalist —
took the advice of an acquaintance who had knowl
edge of hidden diamonds along the French-German
border.
Svoray said that, while querying a local German
historian on the diamonds' whereabouts, the histori
an suddenly looked at him and said, "You know, I
fought in the best army in the world."
"Me too," Svoray responded, referring to his stint
in the Israeli army.
"I saw action," the man said.
"I saw action too," Svoray responded.
"I was in the SS," the man replied.
Svoray stopped laughing.
"I thought to myself, he had to be a war criminal,"
Svoray said. "I felt very weird. I stayed there, but I
didn't know why."
Svoray said he was introduced to the man's
nephew, who took him to the outskirts of Frankfurt
where seven of his friends were waiting, all dressed in
authentic Nazi uniforms.
The lights were turned down and the men
watched a short clip of Hitler before viewing a 20
minute film of a group of men raping a young girl,
then stabbing her to death.
"I was shattered," Svoray said. After the incident,
he took the next flight back to Israel. "As a human
being, sitting with a bunch of men masturbating
while a girl got killed, I figured I had to do some
thing," he said.
Svoray traveled to the Simon Weisenthal Center
