## Neo-Nazi insider tells story of hate 
### Brian Singer 
A search for diamonds and the increasing Neo-
Nazi movement in Germany — on the surface the
two may seem completely unconnected.
Enter Yaron Svoray. A whimsical search for dia
monds along the French-German border paved his
road to reporting on the aggrandizement of Neo-
Nazis to the entire world.
Svoray, who infiltrated Germany between 1992
and 1993 under the name Ron Furey, spoke of his
penetration of the Neo-Nazi movement and his book
"In Hitler's Shadow" yesterday before 150 people in
Kresge Auditorium.
"The Germans don't know what is happening to
them," he said. "I saw [racism and hate] on an hourly
basis."
After moving to the U.S. from his native Israel,
Svoray — who was then an American journalist —
took the advice of an acquaintance who had knowl
edge of hidden diamonds along the French-German
border.
Svoray said that, while querying a local German
historian on the diamonds' whereabouts, the histori
an suddenly looked at him and said, "You know, I
fought in the best army in the world."
"Me too," Svoray responded, referring to his stint
in the Israeli army.
"I saw action," the man said.
"I saw action too," Svoray responded.
"I was in the SS," the man replied.
Svoray stopped laughing.
"I thought to myself, he had to be a war criminal,"
Svoray said. "I felt very weird. I stayed there, but I
didn't know why."
Svoray said he was introduced to the man's
nephew, who took him to the outskirts of Frankfurt
where seven of his friends were waiting, all dressed in
authentic Nazi uniforms.
The lights were turned down and the men
watched a short clip of Hitler before viewing a 20
minute film of a group of men raping a young girl,
then stabbing her to death.
"I was shattered," Svoray said. After the incident,
he took the next flight back to Israel. "As a human
being, sitting with a bunch of men masturbating
while a girl got killed, I figured I had to do some
thing," he said.
Svoray traveled to the Simon Weisenthal Center
in Los Angeles, and after much
persuasion, won approval and
backing to return to Germany.
He posed as a right-wing jour
nalist writing the Nazi side of the
story, he said. A nine-day trip
lasted nine months.
After realizing that the thou
sands of Neo-Nazi youths were
being manipulated by an outside
force, Svoray decided to climb the
hierarchy of the Neo-Nazi move
ment.
"These people were bankers,

lawyers, and policemen," Svoray
said. Posing as an American Nazi
trying to get involved in the Ger
man movement, he met family of
former Nazi leaders — Hermann
Goering's daughter, Adolph
Hitler's butler and Heinrik
Himmler's daughter.
Svoray met Wolfgang Juhim
who, Svoray said, is "the Hitler
in-waiting." Svoray witnessed vio
lent "war games" in which youths
inflict pain on other youths to
prove that Nazis do not flinch.
Leaving Germany with hun
dreds of documents, pictures and
tape recordings, Svoray reported
his findings to the world on April
20, which was not-so-coinciden

tally Hitler's birthday.
"I really did a good police job,"
Svoray said.
Svoray said he was horrified
the lack of a German response not
only to his reports but to the Neo-
Nazi movement as a whole.
Though Germany has many laws
against pro-Nazi behavior, they
are easy to circumvent, he said.
Though he was taken in by Ger
man police four times, he was
never arrested, he said.
"The only country which never
reacted [to the reports) was Ger
many," Svoray said.
The apathy of the German citi
zens is so great, he said, that peo
ple hang laundry over the

"killing" wall at the Dachau con
centration camp.
"There are three types of Ger
mans," Svoray said. "Type one
looks into your eyes and says, 'I'm
sorry |for the Nazi massacre of 10
million people during the Holo
caust].' Type two looks into your
eyes and says, 'I don't care.' And
type three smiles and says, 'You're
an idiot for believing this propagan
da. I've researched it, and less than
400,000 Jews died. I'm embar
rassed to be talking to you.' "
The documents which Svoray
collected are on display in the
Museum of Tolerance at the
Simon Weisenthal Center in Los
Angeles.
