# Hoover Fellow tells of life on the funny Farm
## 
### Cecilia Balli 
More than 1,000 Stanford alumni
began their homecoming weekend on
campus yesterday by sharing some
good laughs and picking on Stanford's
rival for this Saturday's football game.
"Today no (USC) football player can
get his varsity letter unless he can iden
tify it," John H. Bunzel said jokingly of
the University of Southern California's
effort to focus more on academics.
Bunzel, a Senior Research Fellow at
the Hoover Institution and a known

radio and television commentator,
kicked off this year's Stanford Reunion
Homecoming last night at Memorial
Auditorium with his satirical speech "A
Funny Thing Happened on the Way to
the Farm."
This is the second year that Bunzel
has spoken at the reunion. He was
asked to open up the event because of
his popularity at last year's program.
"Of all of the programs last year for
Reunion Homecoming this one re
ceived the most overwhelmingly en
thusiastic responses," said Lauren

Black, associate director for the Alum
ni Association. "It seemed like a natur
al thing to do this."
Members of Stanford classes from
the past 50 years filled the auditorium
to listen to Bunzel's humorous look at
everything from politics to the football
craze on college campuses.
"On many campuses they're trying
to build a university that the football
team can be proud of," Bunzel said.
After commenting on Stanford's na
tionally known football coach, he
added, "but I don't think I want to pick

on Bill Walsh because he's about the
closest thing we have to God here at
Stanford."
Bunzel also reflected on the rapid
changes in society since his generation
went to school.
"I know a woman who still remem
bers her first kiss but has a daughter
who can't even remember her first hus
band," he said. "Our attitude towards
marriage certainly has changed."
But a different kind of change was
on some of the onlooking alum
ni's minds.
"When I went to school all
there was the Quad and a few
other buildings," Class of '49
member Bob Benson recalled
before the event. "[Stanford is)
huge. It's very beautiful, but it's
very big now."
Back in his years at Stanford,
what are now known as Sunday
Flicks were free, Benson said.
"They weren't really good
movies, but you could avoid
studying a little longer that way,"
he said as a paper airplane landed
on the stage and the crowd broke
into applause.
Audience member Laurence
Wingerter, a 1964 graduate who
flew from Texas to be at the

reunion, remembered shabby
temporary buildings left from
World War II when he attended
Stanford.
"Thank goodness those are
gone," Wingerter said. "They've
paved a lot of stuff, (but) Stanford
feels very comfortable like an old
shoe."
Some 5,000 Stanford alumni
are expected to step on campus
for Reunion Homecoming this
weekend, Black said. Among the
activities planned are a number of
forums, tours, receptions and
dances.
Football fans will fill the stadi
um Saturday for the football
game and the weekend will con
clude with a parade down Palm
Drive to University Avenue on
Sunday.
Reunion Homecoming is being
sponsored by the Stanford Alum
ni Association and the Univers
ty's Office of Development.
