Anticipating a radical change
in the way students and universi
ties work, University President
Gerhard Casper urged the Com
mittee on Technology in Teach
ing & Learning yesterday to
make Stanford a trendsetter in
utilizing modern technology to
promote higher education.
The committee, which Casper
introduced last spring as a
keynote of his State of the Univer
sity address, met for the first time
in a two-hour session to discuss
the merger of modern technology
and teaching. The floor was
opened for a heated question-and
answer session after Casper's
lengthy opening remarks.
"[We have] the opportunity to
become a leader," Casper told the
committee. "[Yet], as an insti
tute, we are incapable of putting
it all together."
With representatives from the
major branches of the Universi
ty, the committee's goal is to "not
think in terms of 2 years from
now. . . [but] to very quickly
come to some interesting issues
. . . [and develop] a set of recom

mendations," Casper said.
"The rest of our peers are tak
ing too lackadaisical a view,"
Casper insisted. "We should be
different ... we have the poten
tial to be different."
Telling the committee that
this undertaking will be "more
important than anything else
[they] will ever do," Casper an
nounced his vision to change the
infrastructure and the way Stan
ford looks at technology.
This could mean interlinking
classrooms and students via com
puters, connecting overseas
studies programs with the Uni
versity, and even bringing alum
ni back to campus through the
use of modern technology.
However, Casper made it ab
solutely clear that he would
"never break up the undergradu
ate college" by replacing the tra
ditional physical presence of the
student with a professor in a box.
Casper also emphasized the
benefits of linking Stanford to
the general public with recent
technological advances. Pro
grams of continuing education,


University President Gerhard Casper presents the newly created Technology Task
Force with broad guidelines for the future yesterday.
