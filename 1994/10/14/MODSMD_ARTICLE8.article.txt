# Casper's technological trendsetters meet

Anticipating a radical change
in the way students and universi
ties work, University President
Gerhard Casper urged the Com
mittee on Technology in Teach
ing & Learning yesterday to
make Stanford a trendsetter in
utilizing modern technology to
promote higher education.
The committee, which Casper
introduced last spring as a
keynote of his State of the Univer
sity address, met for the first time
in a two-hour session to discuss
the merger of modern technology
and teaching. The floor was
opened for a heated question-and
answer session after Casper's
lengthy opening remarks.
"[We have] the opportunity to
become a leader," Casper told the
committee. "[Yet], as an insti
tute, we are incapable of putting
it all together."
With representatives from the
major branches of the Universi
ty, the committee's goal is to "not
think in terms of 2 years from
now. . . [but] to very quickly
come to some interesting issues
. . . [and develop] a set of recom

mendations," Casper said.
"The rest of our peers are tak
ing too lackadaisical a view,"
Casper insisted. "We should be
different ... we have the poten
tial to be different."
Telling the committee that
this undertaking will be "more
important than anything else
[they] will ever do," Casper an
nounced his vision to change the
infrastructure and the way Stan
ford looks at technology.
This could mean interlinking
classrooms and students via com
puters, connecting overseas
studies programs with the Uni
versity, and even bringing alum
ni back to campus through the
use of modern technology.
However, Casper made it ab
solutely clear that he would
"never break up the undergradu
ate college" by replacing the tra
ditional physical presence of the
student with a professor in a box.
Casper also emphasized the
benefits of linking Stanford to
the general public with recent
technological advances. Pro

involving high schools and out
reach programs provide a number
of possibilities.
"[There arej bright people
which we could bring into our cir
cuit if only we found ways to
reach them," Casper said.
Led by Senior Assoc. Dean of
Humanities and Sciences John
Etchemendy, the committee
adopted six working groups to
address Casper's ideas, staffed by
University officials from various
departments.
According to Etchemendy, the
subgroups would take "signifi
cant commitment and energy"
and produce a "series of pilot pro
jects, quarterly reports and white
papers."
"(We want) to make something
happen," Linguistics Prof. Stanley
Peters said. The committee is sup
posed to operate on a level between
dictating policy and implementing
it, Etchemendy added.
There was some disagreement
among committee members on
making a Stanford education

accessible to the general public.
By marketing it as a product to
the general population, some
members felt it would cheapen
the value of a Stanford education.
"The hardest part [of Stan
ford] is being admitted," said
Tony Siegman, professor of elec
trical engineering. By marketing
the Stanford education, "we make
it available to people not admit
ted," he said.
On the other hand, Etchemendy
said that "[the Stanford education]
is a very good product ... [that
would] not hurt the society if we
can expand it ... If we could help
and get something out of it, that
would not be inconsistent with our
mission."
Although yesterday's meeting
was purely inspirational and
organizational, the committee
was able to decide upon several
suggestions, including the need to
adapt technology into the under
graduate education.
The group was also informed
that a possible outside advisory
group, with representatives from
Apple and Hewlett-Packard, may
be a resource for them.
The next meeting of the com
mittee is scheduled for Nov. 16.
