# Stenstrom re-writes Cardinal record book
## 
### Christian Leone Editorial staff 
It was only a matter of time.
With a 19 yard strike to senior Justin Armour in
the second quarter of last Saturday's game at Ari
zona State, Steve Stenstrom surpassed Oregon
State's Erik Wilhelm to become the most prolific
passer in Pacific 10 Conference history.
And today against the Trojans, more records are
likely to fall as Stenstrom looks to replace Cardinal
great John Elway in three more categories. Sten
strom needs only 105 yards through the air to break
Elway's Pac-10 record for career total offense. In ad
dition, the El Toro, Calif, native needs only 68 yards
to become Stanford's all-time leading passer (includ
ing bowl games).
With 29 strikes today against USC, Stenstrom
will also become the school's all-time completions
leader. His 9,282 passing yards currently place him
19th in NCAA Division 1-A history and make him
one of only three Pac-10 quarterbacks to break the
9,000 yard mark.
This season Stenstrom has already passed for
1,573 yards and eight touchdowns and, despite hav
ing just one win against San Jose State to show for
his efforts, there is no denying that he is one of the
most talented NFL prospects in the nation.
