# Stanford/USC Match-Ups
## 
### 
Stenstrom and Johnson both
projected Heisman Trophy candi
dates when the season began
were teammates at El Toro High
School. Stenstrom has been noth
ing short of spectacular in his se
nior season at Stanford. In last
Saturday's loss to Arizona State,
Stenstrom threw for 313 yards and
became the Pac-10 Conference's
all-time leading passer. Johnson
was predicted to be the No. 1 pick
in the 1995 NFL draft by The
Sporting News, and, despite sitting
out last week against Oregon
State, he has completed 68% of his
passes for 951 yards on the year.

Jason White has only played two
games in 1994 due to a University
suspension, but his return to the
gridiron has strengthened a ques
tionable Cardinal defense. He has
recorded 11 tackles and one sack
in 1994. Boselli is a returning Ail-
American offensive lineman who
is a candidate for both the Lom
bardi Award and the Outland Tro
phy. The 6' 8", 305 pound senior
anchors a Trojan line which has
had its difficulties in 1994, rank
ing last in the conference in sacks
allowed.

Kadar Hamilton has emerged as
one of the Cardinal stars of the fu
ture, cementing himself as a
starter in the Stanford secondary.
The true freshman is used to
being a newcomer and played his
high school ball at four different
schools. Hamilton recorded a
timely interception in last week's
loss to Arizona State. Ken Grace
leads the Trojans in receptions
with 23 on the season for a 10.4
yards per catch average. Grace
has caught a pass for USC in 14
consecutive games and looks to be
a favorite target for Rob Johnson.

Jason Fisk anchors a Cardinal de
fense which has improved signifi
cantly from a year ago but is still
hampered by youth and inexperi
ence. Fisk a fifth year senior
is one of only a handful of upper
classmen in the starting line-up
and has recorded 33 tackles and
five sacks on the season.Walters is
Southern Cal's latest running
back prospect and is looked upon
to regain USC's reputation of
"Tailback U.". He led the Trojans
in rushing last season as a fresh
man with 711 yards gained and
has already run for 478 yards this
season.

Though fullback Adam Salina has
only gained 69 yards on the year
for the Cardinal, he seems to have
the potential to be the power run
ner that Stanford so desperately
needs. Last week against Arizona
State, Salina rushed for three
touchdowns and got the Cardinal
out of a difficult situation deep in
it's own territory with three
straight carries. Inside linebacker
Jeff Kopp led the Trojans in tack
les a year ago with 83 and has
picked up right where he left off.
Kopp already has 54 tackles on
the season and has been listed as a
candidate for the prestigious
Butkus Award.

While USC may have beautiful
"people", southern California
sun, a dignified marching band,
and a great mascot we have The
Tree.
