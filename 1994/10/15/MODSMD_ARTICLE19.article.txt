# Robinson guides Trojans
## Southern Cal coach and Walsh travel the same path 
### Tom Baranowski 
University of Southern Califor
nia head coach John Robinson
knows a lot about what it means to
live and die in L.A. just ask him
about his desire to act.
"When they make the Bill
Walsh movie, I'll apply with Bill to
play the lead. I'll have to lose
about 20 pounds, dye my hair
gray, and have that kind of con
fused look on my face, but I think
I'd fit in," he said.
Robinson may fit in well in this
movie, but for USC fans he's an
even better fit with their football
program. In his nine seasons as
head coach, Robinson's Trojans
have compiled a 78-21-2 record,
ranking him the third winningest
active Division 1-A coach.
Like Stanford's own Bill Walsh,
Robinson's name has become syn
onymous with winning. His 78.3
winning percentage against other
Pacific 10 Conference teams is the
third best mark in league history.
Unfortunately for Robinson,
who returned to the collegiate
ranks last season after nine years
at the helm of the Los Angeles
Rams, all of that winning has
made expectations exceedingly
high for his program.
Couple those expectations with
a disappointing start to the 1994
season and the recipe for frustra
tion is almost complete on the L.A.
campus. USC has opened the year
with a 3-2 record, including an em
barrassing loss to Penn State and
a shocking upset at the hands of
Oregon. In all it lends itself to a sit
uation all too familiar to Stanford
fans a fact that is not lost on
Robinson.
"At USC we have a team, prob
ably a lot like Stanford, that is
going to be significantly better in
the next two years, and has really
good, young personnel," he said.
Robinson also recognizes paral
lels between himself and Walsh.
Both returned to college coaching
after long NFL stints Robinson
with the Rams and Walsh with the
49ers and short television ca
reers Robinson with CBS and
Walsh with NBC. In fact, the two
coaches' careers seem to mirror
one another in an uncanny fash
ion.
Just as Walsh did in 1992 at
Stanford, last season Robinson
guided USC to a share of the Pac
-10 title in his first year back in col
lege football. But both Walsh's
Cardinal and Robinson's Trojans
were forced to watch another con
ference foe compete in the Rose
Bowl Washington in 1992 and
UCLA in 1993.
Walsh had little trouble finding
commonalities between himself

and the USC coach.
"I really didn't expect to coach
again, period, and I'm sure there
was a period of time in his life
when he did not expect to coach
again at the college level," Walsh
said last year. "But if he ever were
to return, it would have only been
at USC, and in my case it would
only have been at Stanford. In a
sense, we both stand for the same
kinds of things... I'm a big admir
er of his."
But the return to college athlet
ics has not been all glory for the
two coaches, who have each expe
rienced their difficulties in 1994.
"Bill and I are building pro
grams, and I think our situations
are somewhat similar," Robinson
said. "The next step is to go back
and start with a recruiting class
and start to build the kind of ath
lete that we would both like to
have. There's a wait in the middle
there, though, and we're both
going through that right now."
In spite of the struggle for a
Rose Bowl birth and the pressures
of coaching, Robinson has been
able to hold on to his sense of
humor and his flair for the dra
matic. When asked about his good
friend and rival Bill Walsh, he was
quick to reply, "Is Bill still coach
ing at Stanford? He's probably
Athletic Director by now."
However, Robinson insists that
neither he nor Walsh has lost sight
of the long-term goal of building
successful football programs.
"I think I have a pretty clear
idea of what we have to do to get

our program back on top, and I
suspect that Bill, in spite of his ad
vanced age, would know the same
thing," he said.
In the meantime, both coaches
have had to respond to questions
about their teams' performances.
Walsh has been under fire in the
press over the past few weeks, not
only because of the Cardinal's dis
appointing start to the 1994 sea
son, but also because of comments
made by sophomore cornerback
Eliel Swinton, who questioned
Walsh's leadership skills.
Walsh has also been criticized
for statements attributed to him
in a recently published book,
"Rough Magic", which chronicles
Stanford's 1992 season: While
Robinson hasn't faced these types
of problems, he was quick to come
to the defense of his friend.
"I think sometimes people ex
aggerate the feelings that many of
us have about people who criticize
you when you don't win or don't
live up to the expectations of
somebody else," Robinson said. "I
mean, [college football] is sup
posed to be fun, and people aren't
supposed to be so damn serious
about everything."
But how does Robinson feel
about Walsh reportedly attacking
USC, referring to the school as
"Yesterday U."?
"We're supposed to enjoy (foot
ball) and if you kid somebody or
say a barb about somebody that's
part of sports," Robinson said.
"You should hear some of the
things I've said about Stanford."

guided USC to a share of the Pac
-10 title in his first year back in col
lege football. But both Walsh's
Cardinal and Robinson's Trojans
were forced to watch another con
ference foe compete in the Rose
Bowl Washington in 1992 and
UCLA in 1993.
Walsh had little trouble finding
commonalities between himself

and the USC coach.
"I really didn't expect to coach
again, period, and I'm sure there
was a period of time in his life
when he did not expect to coach
again at the college level," Walsh
said last year. "But if he ever were
to return, it would have only been
at USC, and in my case it would
only have been at Stanford. In a
sense, we both stand for the same
kinds of things... I'm a big admir
er of his."
But the return to college athlet
ics has not been all glory for the
two coaches, who have each expe
rienced their difficulties in 1994.
"Bill and I are building pro
grams, and I think our situations
are somewhat similar," Robinson
said. "The next step is to go back
and start with a recruiting class
and start to build the kind of ath
lete that we would both like to
have. There's a wait in the middle
there, though, and we're both
going through that right now."
In spite of the struggle for a
Rose Bowl birth and the pressures
of coaching, Robinson has been
able to hold on to his sense of
humor and his flair for the dra
matic. When asked about his good
friend and rival Bill Walsh, he was
quick to reply, "Is Bill still coach
ing at Stanford? He's probably
Athletic Director by now."
However, Robinson insists that
neither he nor Walsh has lost sight
of the long-term goal of building
successful football programs.
"I think I have a pretty clear
idea of what we have to do to get

our program back on top, and I
suspect that Bill, in spite of his ad
vanced age, would know the same
thing," he said.
In the meantime, both coaches
have had to respond to questions
about their teams' performances.
Walsh has been under fire in the
press over the past few weeks, not
only because of the Cardinal's dis
appointing start to the 1994 sea
son, but also because of comments
made by sophomore cornerback
Eliel Swinton, who questioned
Walsh's leadership skills.
Walsh has also been criticized
for statements attributed to him
in a recently published book,
"Rough Magic", which chronicles
Stanford's 1992 season: While
Robinson hasn't faced these types
of problems, he was quick to come
to the defense of his friend.
"I think sometimes people ex
aggerate the feelings that many of
us have about people who criticize
you when you don't win or don't
live up to the expectations of
somebody else," Robinson said. "I
mean, [college football] is sup
posed to be fun, and people aren't
supposed to be so damn serious
about everything."
But how does Robinson feel
about Walsh reportedly attacking
USC, referring to the school as
"Yesterday U."?
"We're supposed to enjoy (foot
ball) and if you kid somebody or
say a barb about somebody that's
part of sports," Robinson said.
"You should hear some of the
things I've said about Stanford."

USC's John Robinson and Stanford's Bill Walsh shake hands after
last season's Trojan victory. Both coaches turned their backs on the
NFL to return to college football.
University of Southern Califor
nia head coach John Robinson
knows a lot about what it means to
live and die in L.A. just ask him
about his desire to act.
"When they make the Bill
Walsh movie, I'll apply with Bill to
play the lead. I'll have to lose
about 20 pounds, dye my hair
gray, and have that kind of con
fused look on my face, but I think
I'd fit in," he said.
Robinson may fit in well in this
movie, but for USC fans he's an
even better fit with their football
program. In his nine seasons as
head coach, Robinson's Trojans
have compiled a 78-21-2 record,
ranking him the third winningest
active Division 1-A coach.
Like Stanford's own Bill Walsh,
Robinson's name has become syn
onymous with winning. His 78.3
winning percentage against other
Pacific 10 Conference teams is the
third best mark in league history.
Unfortunately for Robinson,
who returned to the collegiate
ranks last season after nine years
at the helm of the Los Angeles
Rams, all of that winning has
made expectations exceedingly
high for his program.
Couple those expectations with
a disappointing start to the 1994
season and the recipe for frustra
tion is almost complete on the L.A.
campus. USC has opened the year
with a 3-2 record, including an em
barrassing loss to Penn State and
a shocking upset at the hands of
Oregon. In all it lends itself to a sit
uation all too familiar to Stanford
fans a fact that is not lost on
Robinson.
"At USC we have a team, prob
ably a lot like Stanford, that is
going to be significantly better in
the next two years, and has really
good, young personnel," he said.
Robinson also recognizes paral
lels between himself and Walsh.
Both returned to college coaching
after long NFL stints Robinson
with the Rams and Walsh with the
49ers and short television ca
reers Robinson with CBS and
Walsh with NBC. In fact, the two
coaches' careers seem to mirror
one another in an uncanny fash
ion.
Just as Walsh did in 1992 at
Stanford, last season Robinson
guided USC to a share of the Pac
-10 title in his first year back in col
lege football. But both Walsh's
Cardinal and Robinson's Trojans
