# Cal, Arizona and Washington St. lead Pac-10
## Winless Stanford's Rose Bowl hopes dwindle as Wildcats appear favorites in weak conference race 
### Christian Leone Editorial staff 
This week, for the first time this season,
every Pac-10 team will play a conference
game.

1. Arizona Wildcats
(2-0 in the Pac-10,4-1 overall)
Coming off their first loss of
the season a 21-16 beat
ing at the hands of 6th

ranked Colorado State 14th ranked Ari
zona will face Washington State today. The
Wildcats will look to All-American defensive
end Teddy Bruschi and free safety Brandon
Sanders to shut down a less than average
Cougar offense that has only put up 85
points in its first five games.

2. Washington St. Cougars
(2-0 in the Pac-10,4-1 overall)
The Cougars have allowed
only 29 points all season, an
average of 5.8 a game, their
only loss coming from Ten-

nessee earlier this season by a score of 10-9.
Today they host the Wildcats in a battle of
undefeated Pac-10 teams.

3. California Golden Bears
(2-0 in the Pac-10, 3-2 overall)
After completely embarrass
ing themselves with back-to
back losses against San Diego
State and Hawaii to open the
season, the Golden Bears have

found themselves atop the Pac-10 (keep in
mind their two conference wins were

against a miserable UCLA team and an av
erage Arizona St. squad). With Dave Barr
out for the season Cal won't be on top of the
conference for long. Don't be surprised if
the Cardinal gets revenge of last year's Big
Game thrashing. Cal is likely to get beat up
in Arizona and then Washington in the two
weeks prior to the big Nov. 19 meeting.

4. USC Trojans
(2-1 in the Pac-10, 3-2 overall)
The Trojans opened the season
with an impressive win against
Washington but have been less
than noteworthy since. Led by

quarterback Rob Johnson, USC brings the
Pac-10's second most efficient passing of
fense to Palo Alto. Look for a lot of points to
be scored through the air today; Stanford is
allowing 33 points a game while USC's 425
yards allowed per game is by far the worst in
the conference.

5. Arizona State Sun Devils
(2-1 in the Pac-10, 2-3 overall)
Coming off last week's victory
over the Cardinal, the Sun Dev
ils will travel to Washington
this week to take on the
Huskies. ASU is a mediocre

team (Bth in the Pac-10 in total offense and
defense) that somehow has managed to
come up with two conference wins. They are
stuck in the middle of a weak Pac-10 but
have high hopes for today's game against
Washington; last year, despite Kaufman's
119 yards on 16 carries, the Sun Devils
shutout the Huskies in the second half to
come away with a 32-17 victory.

6. Oregon Ducks
(1-1 in the Pac-10, 3-3 overall)
The Ducks beat an inconsistent
USC team before losing to a
stingy Washington State
squad. This weak they meet the

overachieving Golden Bears in Eugene.
With the loss of quarterback Danny O'Neil
(who passed for over 3,000 yards last year)
the Ducks will have to be effective on the
ground, where much of the responsibilities
lie in the hands of the reliable Dino Philyaw,
who is averaging almost 67 yards a game.

7. Stanford Cardinal
(0-2 in the Pac-10,1-3-1 overall)
Winless in the Pac-10 and miles
from the Top 25, Stanford's Rose
Bowl hopes seem to be fading fast.
After tying Northwestern in a

shootout to open the season and losing to a
sub-par Arizona State team, Stanford finds
itself up against an erratic USC team who has
beaten the Cardinal 49 times in their last 72
meetings. The offense leads the Pac-10 but
has only been good enough to come away with
one win this season. If the Cardinal hopes to
do anything in the post-season, the inexperi
enced defense will have to step up.

8. UCLA Bruins
(0-3 in the Pac-10, 2-4 overall)
What a difference a year
makes. Last year the Bruins
went to the Rose Bowl; now

they're conference cellar-dwellers. Wayne
Cook currently has the worst quarterback
rating in the Pac-10 and UCLA has the
worst scoring offense in the conference.

Heisman hopeful wide receiver J.J.
Stokes was supposed to help UCLA domi
nate the gridiron from the air this year
but injuries have forced him to miss much
of the season.

9. Oregon State Beavers
(0-3 in the Pac-10,1-4 overall)
Led by senior halfback J.J.
Young and sophomore option
quarterback Don Shanklin, the

Beavers dominate the Pac-10 in rushing
yards per game with an average of over 278.
However their complete inability to pass the
ball (an average of 63.6 yards a game) hurt
them against Arizona St, Arizona and USC,
leaving them winless in the conference. It
should be a battle in Pasadena as two of the
worst teams in the Pac-10 face off today
when Oregon State meets UCLA.

10. Washington Huskies
(1-1 in the Pac-10,4-1 overall)
Probably the best team in the
Pac-10, the 9th-ranked
Huskies have shown that

they can play football with anyone. Led by
Heisman Trophy candidate Napoleon Kauf
man, who is averaging over 224 all purpose
yards per game, the Huskies got off to a dis
appointing start this season with a loss to
USC. They rebounded by soundly beating
Ohio State before journeying to Miami.
There they did the unthinkable, breaking
the Hurricaines' 58 game home winning
streak. But even if they finish the season 11-
1, Washington has nothing to look forward
to because they are ineligible for post-sea
son play.

ing themselves with back-to
back losses against San Diego
State and Hawaii to open the
season, the Golden Bears have

found themselves atop the Pac-10 (keep in
mind their two conference wins were

against a miserable UCLA team and an av
erage Arizona St. squad). With Dave Barr
out for the season Cal won't be on top of the
conference for long. Don't be surprised if
the Cardinal gets revenge of last year's Big
Game thrashing. Cal is likely to get beat up
in Arizona and then Washington in the two
weeks prior to the big Nov. 19 meeting.

4. USC Trojans
(2-1 in the Pac-10, 3-2 overall)
The Trojans opened the season
with an impressive win against
Washington but have been less
than noteworthy since. Led by

quarterback Rob Johnson, USC brings the
Pac-10's second most efficient passing of
fense to Palo Alto. Look for a lot of points to
be scored through the air today; Stanford is
allowing 33 points a game while USC's 425
yards allowed per game is by far the worst in
the conference.

5. Arizona State Sun Devils
(2-1 in the Pac-10, 2-3 overall)
Coming off last week's victory
over the Cardinal, the Sun Dev
ils will travel to Washington
this week to take on the
Huskies. ASU is a mediocre

team (Bth in the Pac-10 in total offense and
defense) that somehow has managed to
come up with two conference wins. They are
stuck in the middle of a weak Pac-10 but
have high hopes for today's game against
Washington; last year, despite Kaufman's
119 yards on 16 carries, the Sun Devils
shutout the Huskies in the second half to
come away with a 32-17 victory.

6. Oregon Ducks
(1-1 in the Pac-10, 3-3 overall)
The Ducks beat an inconsistent
USC team before losing to a
stingy Washington State
squad. This weak they meet the

overachieving Golden Bears in Eugene.
With the loss of quarterback Danny O'Neil
(who passed for over 3,000 yards last year)
the Ducks will have to be effective on the
ground, where much of the responsibilities
lie in the hands of the reliable Dino Philyaw,
who is averaging almost 67 yards a game.

7. Stanford Cardinal
(0-2 in the Pac-10,1-3-1 overall)
Winless in the Pac-10 and miles
from the Top 25, Stanford's Rose
Bowl hopes seem to be fading fast.
After tying Northwestern in a

shootout to open the season and losing to a
sub-par Arizona State team, Stanford finds
itself up against an erratic USC team who has
beaten the Cardinal 49 times in their last 72
meetings. The offense leads the Pac-10 but
has only been good enough to come away with
one win this season. If the Cardinal hopes to
do anything in the post-season, the inexperi
enced defense will have to step up.

8. UCLA Bruins
(0-3 in the Pac-10, 2-4 overall)
What a difference a year
makes. Last year the Bruins
went to the Rose Bowl; now

they're conference cellar-dwellers. Wayne
Cook currently has the worst quarterback
rating in the Pac-10 and UCLA has the
worst scoring offense in the conference.

Heisman hopeful wide receiver J.J.
Stokes was supposed to help UCLA domi
nate the gridiron from the air this year
but injuries have forced him to miss much
of the season.

9. Oregon State Beavers
(0-3 in the Pac-10,1-4 overall)
Led by senior halfback J.J.
Young and sophomore option
quarterback Don Shanklin, the

Beavers dominate the Pac-10 in rushing
yards per game with an average of over 278.
However their complete inability to pass the
ball (an average of 63.6 yards a game) hurt
them against Arizona St, Arizona and USC,
leaving them winless in the conference. It
should be a battle in Pasadena as two of the
worst teams in the Pac-10 face off today
when Oregon State meets UCLA.

10. Washington Huskies
(1-1 in the Pac-10,4-1 overall)
Probably the best team in the
Pac-10, the 9th-ranked
Huskies have shown that

they can play football with anyone. Led by
Heisman Trophy candidate Napoleon Kauf
man, who is averaging over 224 all purpose
yards per game, the Huskies got off to a dis
appointing start this season with a loss to
USC. They rebounded by soundly beating
Ohio State before journeying to Miami.
There they did the unthinkable, breaking
the Hurricaines' 58 game home winning
streak. But even if they finish the season 11-
1, Washington has nothing to look forward
to because they are ineligible for post-sea
son play.










This week, for the first time this season,
every Pac-10 team will play a conference
game.

1. Arizona Wildcats
(2-0 in the Pac-10,4-1 overall)
Coming off their first loss of
the season a 21-16 beat
ing at the hands of 6th

ranked Colorado State 14th ranked Ari
zona will face Washington State today. The
Wildcats will look to All-American defensive
end Teddy Bruschi and free safety Brandon
Sanders to shut down a less than average
Cougar offense that has only put up 85
points in its first five games.

2. Washington St. Cougars
(2-0 in the Pac-10,4-1 overall)
The Cougars have allowed
only 29 points all season, an
average of 5.8 a game, their
only loss coming from Ten-

nessee earlier this season by a score of 10-9.
Today they host the Wildcats in a battle of
undefeated Pac-10 teams.

3. California Golden Bears
(2-0 in the Pac-10, 3-2 overall)
After completely embarrass
ing themselves with back-to
back losses against San Diego
State and Hawaii to open the
season, the Golden Bears have

found themselves atop the Pac-10 (keep in
