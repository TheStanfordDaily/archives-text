# From high school teammates to pro prospects
## Steve Stenstrom and Rob Johnson meet on gridiron for final time in their collegiate careers 
### Kevin Wack Staff writer 
Stanford's Steve Stenstrom
and USC's Rob Johnson are two of
the best quarterbacks ever to come
out of El Toro High School, in Or
ange County, Calif. They are also
two of the best quarterbacks in the
Pacific 10 Conference, and two of
the best quarterbacks in all of col
lege football.
Their story has been well docu
mented. When Stenstrom, the
new all-time leading passer in Pac
-10 history, was a high school se
nior, one of his favorite receiving
targets was Johnson, then a junior
at El Toro.
"Rob was my go-to guy," Sten
strom told the Los Angeles Times.
"He played quarterback before
moving to wide receiver so he had
a natural sense for how pass
routes should be run. We were on
the same wavelength."
Of course, Stenstrom's pres
ence meant that Johnson couldn't
play at his natural position
quarterback until his senior
year at El Toro. But Johnson
claimed there was not any animos
ity between the two in high school.
"I don't think there was a rival
ry between us on the football
field," he said. "It was more of a
friendly competition. I knew he
was the guy, and he knew it. I had
no bad feelings about it at all. We
are always trying to be better than
one another, so we'll always have
our little competition."
Johnson said that although the
two are friends, they find it diffi
cult to find the time to see each
other as much as they'd like to be
cause of their schedules.
The situation in high school
was made even more complex by
the fact that El Toro's coach, Bob
Johnson, is Rob's father.
"Steve was being recruited at
quarterback so I moved Rob to re
ceiver for that one year," the elder
Johnson told the Sporting News.

"Both are similar quarterbacks
but Rob might be a little more ath
letic."
The younger Johnson said that
playing for his father in high school
was a positive experience which
helped him develop into one of the
nation's most efficient passers.
"Playing for Dad was fun, and it
was also demanding," he said. "I
knew he was going to be harder on
me than on anyone else on the
team.
"My dad is an excellent quarter
back coach, and my brother is an
excellent quarterback, so being
around those two people who are
influential helped me become a
better athlete and a better quar
terback. I really had an advantage
over a lot of other kids. Still, they
didn't force me to work hard. They
were there to help, but I still had to
have the drive to work hard and
practice on my own."
And having each other to push
themselves certainly helped both
Stenstrom and Johnson develop
into major college quarterbacks.
Both were touted in the preseason
as Heisman Trophy candidates,
and although disappointing play
by both of their teams has quieted
the talk, their accomplishments
are still tremendous.
"I've seen Steve develop from a
wide-eyed sophomore to a poised
fifth-year senior," said senior
Justin Armour one of Sten
strom's favorite receiving targets
who was also recruited by Stan
ford as a quarterback.
"His knowledge of the game
and of coach Walsh's system have
improved. He's been able to re
move himself from all of the Heis
man hype," he added.
Stenstrom became the Pac-10
career passing leader last week,
when his 313 yards against Ari
zona St. gave him 9,662 for his ca
reer. Stenstrom now holds nearly
every Pac-10 passing record, in
cluding passing yards in a season
(3,627), total offensive yards in a

season (3,398), total offensive
yards per game in a season (308),
and total pass completions in a
season (300).
Johnson has put up some im
pressive numbers as well. He's sec
ond on USC's career passing list;
his 5,973 yards place him behind
only current Dallas Cowboys' quar
terback Rodney Peete. Johnson
holds nine USC offensive records
and is coming off an outstanding
junior season that started talk of a
possible run at the Heisman.
And despite a slow start in the
'94 season, Stanford coach Bill
Walsh is still quite wary of John
son's ability.

"Johnson is a great talent and a
great player," he said. "He's very
confident, poised, and well
coached. I think the best player in
the Pac-10 and probably in the
country— is [Napoleon] Kaufman
from Washington, but aside from
him, people like Steve Stenstrom
and Rob Johnson are right in the
hunt."
Walsh was just as generous in
his praise of the El Toro graduate
he coaches everyday Stenstrom.
"Steve's way ahead of [all the
other quarterbacks I've seen] at
this stage of his career," Walsh
said. "He's a better quarterback
than Joe [Montana] was at Notre

Dame. Mechanically and decision
wise he's a more polished quarter
back than any guys I've ever
worked with at this stage.
"[Stenstrom's] about as far
along in his ability to execute his
offense, his poise, and his funda
mentals as any quarterback. In
those areas, I'm sure he's the best
quarterback in the nation."
Today's game may not mark
the last meeting between Steve
Stenstrom and Rob Johnson
both figure to take their talents to
the National Football League next
season but it will be their last
college meeting. Just a little extra
incentive for both men.
