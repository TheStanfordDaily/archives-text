# Newcomers infiltrate Stanford's starting line-up, look to provide future success
## Cardinal freshmen make immediate impact 
### Emery Chen Staff writer 
Less than six months ago their
biggest worries were about the
prom and high school graduation
parties.
Today, their life is consumed
with team meetings, grueling prac
tices and long road trips when
they're not going up against the
quickest and strongest collegiate
athletes the nation has to offer.
"The quality of this year's
freshmen is one of the best in the
country," said Damon Dunn,
aflrst year flanker from Arlington,
Texas.
Five have already earned their
way into the starting line-up, in
cluding an unprecedented four on
defense. They include defensive
back Kadar Hamilton, defensive
end Kailee Wong, linebackers
Chris Draft and Jon Haskins, and
all-purpose guys Anthony Book
man and Dunn.
"We typically start four [fresh
men] on defense," said coach Bill
Walsh. "I don't think anyone's
done that in a major college
game."
The statistics, although ordi
nary, stand out when compared to
last year, which saw the Cardinal
finish 103 rd out of 106 schools
which play Division 1-A football in
total defense. Stanford is current
ly ranked 46th in the nation in
total defense and 39th in rushing
defense.
However, the Cardinal is still
dead last in the Pac-10 in scoring
defense and ranks 98th nationally.
But not all blame should fall on
the defense's shoulders 35 per
cent of the opposition's points in
1994 have come as a direct result
of offensive turnovers.
The improvement is cause for

optimism. In this year's first five
games, the Cardinal defense has
sacked opposing quarterbacks 20
times, whereas only 17 were
racked up in all of last season.
Much of the improvement is di
rectly attributable to the new
workers on the Farm.
The four defensive starters
Wong, Haskins, Draft and Hamil
ton have stepped in quickly to
fill the holes that were evident the
previous season.
"They recruited to meet defen
sive needs," said Bookman. "They
plugged the holes with the re
cruits."
At times the freshmen have
performed brilliantly. Hamilton is
fourth on the team in tackles with
30 half of them unassisted
and recorded a key interception in
last week's game at Arizona State.
"I chose Stanford for the acade
mics, but another reason I came
here was the ability to come right
in and play," said Hamilton,
whose father Ray played nine
years in the NFL.
Hamilton is used to being a
newcomer after having played at
four different high schools the
past four seasons.
"I'm just looking forward to
being in the same place for a
while," he said. "The guys on the
team really make you feel at home
and don't treat you like a fresh
man."
Hamilton is not the only true
freshman who has given the de
fense a lift. Draft is fifth on the
team with 19 tackles, 12 of which
were solo and has also recorded
two sacks. In addition, Wong
recorded a sack and has knocked
away two passes.
As a group, however, they have
not been mistake-free. In a press
conference on Tuesday, Walsh
said that there were five mistakes
made in the game last week that
were crucial. All five erfors were
made by freshmen.
"I could point each one out, but
I don't know if you would need an
explanation," he said. "The fresh
men are gaining experience but at
the expense of some wins."
Walsh also commented on spe
cific players, saying that Wong
would need to step up his perfor
mance if the Cardinal defense
wanted to be effective against
use.
One player that Bill Walsh had
nothing but praise for was Dunn,
who returned a kickoff for a touch
down last week at Arizona State.
"He's going to be a terrific play
er," said Walsh. "Every time he
touches the ball, the team feels
something will happen."
That something happened
against Arizona State when Dunn
took a kickoff at his own goal line
and ran through the Sun Devils'
special teams for a score. The 100-
yard return is the longest in the

Pac-10 this year and equals Bob
Bryan's longest return in Stan
ford history.
"I got to play some against Ari
zona State and I made a few good
contributions," Dunn said. "I ex
pected to be a role player and I've
been slowed by injuries. I pulled
my hamstring during my second
day on campus."

Listed as possessing great
speed in the Stanford media guide,
Dunn recorded a time of 10.4 sec
onds in the 100 meter dash.
"Stanford had a lack of speed at
wide receiver," Dunn said. "Once I
know the system, then I will be a
deep threat.
"A lot of teams are keying in on
[wide receiver Brian] Manning.
I'm going to be coming in on the
three wide sets and try to take

some of the pressure off of him."
Dunn also hopes that his abili
ties will help open things up for
the Cardinal's struggling ground
attack.
"We haven't been able to run"
he said. "Opposing defenses have
been stacking the line with nine
guys. We'll try to complete some
deep passes."

Surprisingly, Dunn was rated
only the second best wideout from
his state to commit to Stanford.
The top ranked wide receiver from
Texas was Anthony Bookman,
whom Walsh has converted to a
running back.
Bookman, a smallish back in
the mold of former Stanford star
Glyn Milburn, is a significant con
tributor to Stanford's offense. A
consensus All-American out of

high school, he played in four
games missing the last against
Arizona State with a twisted ankle
and started once.
Bookman has also been a key on
special teams, returning 14 kicks
for a total of 285 yards.
"I've been playing a bigger role
than expected," he said. "I expect
ed to play a spot role."
The Grand Prairie, Texas, na
tive, however, is unhappy with his
performance and refuses to make
excuses.
"I'm a perfectionist. I don't
play into that 'l'm just a fresh
man' [mentality]."
The new recruiting class has
played a major role in the first half
of the season for the Cardinal and
will continue to do so for years to
come.
"We're not afraid of putting it
on the line," Dunn said.
"Team-wise, we've had a lot of
bad breaks," added Bookman.
"We'll make a lot of mistakes,
[but eventually] we'll get our
breaks."
And, with the way the 1994 sea
son has shaped up, the freshmen
are likely to see significant playing
time throughout the year.
"Coach Walsh got all of us to
gether at the end of preseason,"
said Hamilton. "He told us that we
didn't have any more time to be
freshmen."

optimism. In this year's first five
games, the Cardinal defense has
sacked opposing quarterbacks 20
times, whereas only 17 were
racked up in all of last season.
Much of the improvement is di
rectly attributable to the new
workers on the Farm.
The four defensive starters
Wong, Haskins, Draft and Hamil
ton have stepped in quickly to
fill the holes that were evident the
previous season.
"They recruited to meet defen
sive needs," said Bookman. "They
plugged the holes with the re
cruits."
At times the freshmen have
performed brilliantly. Hamilton is
fourth on the team in tackles with
30 half of them unassisted
and recorded a key interception in
last week's game at Arizona State.
"I chose Stanford for the acade
mics, but another reason I came
here was the ability to come right
in and play," said Hamilton,
whose father Ray played nine
years in the NFL.
Hamilton is used to being a
newcomer after having played at
four different high schools the
past four seasons.
"I'm just looking forward to
being in the same place for a
while," he said. "The guys on the
team really make you feel at home
and don't treat you like a fresh
man."
Hamilton is not the only true
freshman who has given the de
fense a lift. Draft is fifth on the
team with 19 tackles, 12 of which
were solo and has also recorded
two sacks. In addition, Wong
recorded a sack and has knocked
away two passes.
As a group, however, they have
not been mistake-free. In a press
conference on Tuesday, Walsh
said that there were five mistakes
made in the game last week that
were crucial. All five erfors were
made by freshmen.
"I could point each one out, but
I don't know if you would need an
explanation," he said. "The fresh
men are gaining experience but at
the expense of some wins."
Walsh also commented on spe
cific players, saying that Wong
would need to step up his perfor
mance if the Cardinal defense
wanted to be effective against
use.
One player that Bill Walsh had
nothing but praise for was Dunn,
who returned a kickoff for a touch
down last week at Arizona State.
"He's going to be a terrific play
er," said Walsh. "Every time he
touches the ball, the team feels
something will happen."
That something happened
against Arizona State when Dunn
took a kickoff at his own goal line
and ran through the Sun Devils'
special teams for a score. The 100-
yard return is the longest in the

Pac-10 this year and equals Bob
Bryan's longest return in Stan
ford history.
"I got to play some against Ari
zona State and I made a few good
contributions," Dunn said. "I ex
pected to be a role player and I've
been slowed by injuries. I pulled
my hamstring during my second
day on campus."

Listed as possessing great
speed in the Stanford media guide,
Dunn recorded a time of 10.4 sec
onds in the 100 meter dash.
"Stanford had a lack of speed at
wide receiver," Dunn said. "Once I
know the system, then I will be a
deep threat.
"A lot of teams are keying in on
[wide receiver Brian] Manning.
I'm going to be coming in on the
three wide sets and try to take

some of the pressure off of him."
Dunn also hopes that his abili
ties will help open things up for
the Cardinal's struggling ground
attack.
"We haven't been able to run"
he said. "Opposing defenses have
been stacking the line with nine
guys. We'll try to complete some
deep passes."

Surprisingly, Dunn was rated
only the second best wideout from
his state to commit to Stanford.
The top ranked wide receiver from
Texas was Anthony Bookman,
whom Walsh has converted to a
running back.
Bookman, a smallish back in
the mold of former Stanford star
Glyn Milburn, is a significant con
tributor to Stanford's offense. A
consensus All-American out of

high school, he played in four
games missing the last against
Arizona State with a twisted ankle
and started once.
Bookman has also been a key on
special teams, returning 14 kicks
for a total of 285 yards.
"I've been playing a bigger role
than expected," he said. "I expect
ed to play a spot role."
The Grand Prairie, Texas, na
tive, however, is unhappy with his
performance and refuses to make
excuses.
"I'm a perfectionist. I don't
play into that 'l'm just a fresh
man' [mentality]."
The new recruiting class has
played a major role in the first half
of the season for the Cardinal and
will continue to do so for years to
come.
"We're not afraid of putting it
on the line," Dunn said.
"Team-wise, we've had a lot of
bad breaks," added Bookman.
"We'll make a lot of mistakes,
[but eventually] we'll get our
breaks."
And, with the way the 1994 sea
son has shaped up, the freshmen
are likely to see significant playing
time throughout the year.
"Coach Walsh got all of us to
gether at the end of preseason,"
said Hamilton. "He told us that we
didn't have any more time to be
freshmen."

Freshmen Kailee Wong (13) and Kadar Hamilton (24) converge on Notre Dame running back Randy
Kinder in South Bend. Four freshmen start on defense for the Cardinal.
Less than six months ago their
biggest worries were about the
prom and high school graduation
parties.
Today, their life is consumed
with team meetings, grueling prac
tices and long road trips when
they're not going up against the
quickest and strongest collegiate
athletes the nation has to offer.
"The quality of this year's
freshmen is one of the best in the
country," said Damon Dunn,
aflrst year flanker from Arlington,
Texas.
Five have already earned their
way into the starting line-up, in
cluding an unprecedented four on
defense. They include defensive
back Kadar Hamilton, defensive
end Kailee Wong, linebackers
Chris Draft and Jon Haskins, and
all-purpose guys Anthony Book
man and Dunn.
"We typically start four [fresh
men] on defense," said coach Bill
Walsh. "I don't think anyone's
done that in a major college
game."
The statistics, although ordi
nary, stand out when compared to
last year, which saw the Cardinal
finish 103 rd out of 106 schools
which play Division 1-A football in
total defense. Stanford is current
ly ranked 46th in the nation in
total defense and 39th in rushing
defense.
However, the Cardinal is still
dead last in the Pac-10 in scoring
defense and ranks 98th nationally.
But not all blame should fall on
the defense's shoulders 35 per
cent of the opposition's points in
1994 have come as a direct result
of offensive turnovers.
