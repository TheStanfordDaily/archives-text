# Five years later...
## Living with the legacy of the Loma Prieta Earthquake 
### Justin Pollard Staff writer 
Five years after the Loma Prieta Earth
quake rocked the Stanford campus, "sur
vivors" can still vividly remember what they
were doing at 5:04 p.m. on Oct. 17, 1989.
"I was in Memorial Church listening to a
harpist recite the poems of Sappho for CUV
class," said Kurt Hurtado, who was a fresh
man at the time.
"All of a sudden there was a loud rumbling
sound coming from the Quad which got loud

er and louder. Then one of my friends who was
from San Francisco yelled, 'Earthquake!' and
braced himself in the doorway," Hurtado said.
Within a few seconds, however, "everyone
piled out the door," knocking Hurtado's
friend into the Quad.
"As we were running out, pieces of the ceil
ing were falling out," Hurtado said. "All of the
palm trees in the Quad were swaying in unison,
and the stones in the Quad felt like jelly under
your feet during the aftershocks," he said.
Stanford — along with San Francisco,
Santa Cruz, and the rest of the Bay Area —

suffered major damage from the 1989 Loma
Prieta Earthquake, which registered 7.1 on
the Richter scale.
Several buildings were forced to close,
more than 500 students were evacuated from
their residences into dorm lounges, and the
earthquake caused more than a dozen chemi
cal spills and leaks around campus. Classes
were also canceled the day after the quake.
The University has spent the past five
years recovering from the earthquake and
