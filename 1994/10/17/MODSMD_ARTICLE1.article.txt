# Five years later...
## Living with the legacy of the Loma Prieta Earthquake 
### Justin Pollard Staff writer 
Five years after the Loma Prieta Earth
quake rocked the Stanford campus, "sur
vivors" can still vividly remember what they
were doing at 5:04 p.m. on Oct. 17, 1989.
"I was in Memorial Church listening to a
harpist recite the poems of Sappho for CUV
class," said Kurt Hurtado, who was a fresh
man at the time.
"All of a sudden there was a loud rumbling
sound coming from the Quad which got loud

er and louder. Then one of my friends who was
from San Francisco yelled, 'Earthquake!' and
braced himself in the doorway," Hurtado said.
Within a few seconds, however, "everyone
piled out the door," knocking Hurtado's
friend into the Quad.
"As we were running out, pieces of the ceil
ing were falling out," Hurtado said. "All of the
palm trees in the Quad were swaying in unison,
and the stones in the Quad felt like jelly under
your feet during the aftershocks," he said.
Stanford — along with San Francisco,
Santa Cruz, and the rest of the Bay Area —

suffered major damage from the 1989 Loma
Prieta Earthquake, which registered 7.1 on
the Richter scale.
Several buildings were forced to close,
more than 500 students were evacuated from
their residences into dorm lounges, and the
earthquake caused more than a dozen chemi
cal spills and leaks around campus. Classes
were also canceled the day after the quake.
The University has spent the past five
years recovering from the earthquake and

implementing strong measures
to prepare itself for future
quakes.
Geologists agree that there will
be more earthquakes in the
future, but University officials
say that Stanford will be better
prepared for the next "big one."
Shaken finances
Stanford suffered more than
$160 million in damage from the
devastating quake. Memorial
Church, the Stanford Art Muse
um and parts of the Quad are
among the many buildings which
were severely damaged and closed
for several years.
The Loma Prieta Earthquake
caused considerable strain on the
University's budget, and "created
circumstances where we had to
plan for our capital needs very
carefully," said Geoffrey Cox, vice
provost for institutional plan
ning.
"We have been very fortunate
to have had great generosity on
the part of friends of Stanford
who have supported the restora
tion of campus," said University

budget director Tim Warner.
Fund raising has been "a criti
cal piece in moving forward on
repairs and restoration of damage
from the earthquake," he said.
"The bulk of the work will be
completed by 1999," Cox said. But
Stanford will be paying for the
cost of earthquake repairs for
much longer, since the University
financed most of the repair costs
by taking on considerable debt, he
added.
The University issued $150
million in bonds in March, Warn
er said. Funds from the bond sales
have been designated for refi
nancing existing debt, repairing
earthquake damage and strength
ening older buildings.
The University's bonds received
a AAA rating, the highest rating
given by the federal government,
and were sold to institutional
investors at a rate of 7.01 percent.
Although the University has
over $2 billion in its endow
ment, it made better economic
sense to pay a relatively low
interest rate on bonds than to
withdraw endowment funds
from investments where they
are earning much higher rates
of return.
Stanford also received financial
assistance for earthquake repair

from the California government
and the Federal Emergency Man
agement Agency. Negotiations
with FEMA are still in progress,
but the agency has already com
mitted $38.5 million to the Uni
versity. The state of California
gave Stanford $5 million in aid as
well.
Repairing the campus
After the earthquake, the Uni
versity not only began to repair
the many damaged buildings but
also continued a program of seis
mic strengthening already under
way before the quake, said Valerie
Veronin, former acting director of
facilities project management.
The program reviewed the
structural strength of all Univer
sity buildings to determine which
ones needed additional seismic
bracing, Veronin said.
The review "looked at build
ings from all sorts of points of
view, including age, structure,
and how an earthquake would
affect it," she said. For example,
if a building was big, old and built
of unreinforced masonry — like
many of the buildings in the
Quad — it would be classified as
high-risk and in need of struc
tural strengthening, Veronin
said.

Most campus
structures are
being reinforced
to withstand an
earthquake on
the mid-penin
sula section of
the San Andreas
Fault measuring
7.5 on the
Richter scale,
Veronin said.
This means that
buildings "will
not collapse, but
may suffer dam
age, and that
people can safely
exit," she said.
The Universi
ty is most con
cerned with "life
safety strength
ening," said
Jacqueline Wen
der, associate
provost for facili
ties.
Has the Uni
versity done
enough to pre
pare for future
earthquakes?
"It's never
enough," said
Helmut Krawin
kler, dirprt.or of
the Blume Earth
quake Engineer
ing Center. But
the University
"does the best it
can within the
constraints of
time and avail
able funds," he
said.

Preparing for earthquakes "is
an ongoing process" and will take
at least another five to 10 years,
Krawinkler said. The "biggest
problems have been dealt with,"
he said, and today we are "signifi
cantly better off than we were five
years ago."
Memorial Church was
reopened in the fall of 1992, and
the Jackson Business Library and
most of the damaged residences
have been repaired as well.
Restoration of the Geology and
Language corners is expected to
be completed by June 1996, and
the west wing of Green Library
will open by spring 1998, Wender
said.
The schedules for repair were
"driven in large part by negotia
tions with FEMA," she added.
"There were a lot of things
being reviewed by FEMA, and a
lot of processes, but there was not
a lot of closure," said Veronin,
who worked closely with the agen
cy.
Veronin said the agency was
trying to adhere very strictly to
rules and regulations and
required "a whole lot of data"
from the University, stalling final
decisions for long periods of time.
After the Clinton administra
tion took over the White House,
FEMA had an "attitude shift" and
negotiations began progressing
more quickly.
Readying a response
In addition to strengthening
buildings, the University is taking
measures to ensure that students,
faculty and staff are ready for the
next earthquake.
Since the 1989 earthquake
Residential Education has done a
lot "in terms of presenting infor
mation to RAs, who we expect to
provide leadership" in the event
of a major earthquake, said Chris
Griffith, director of graduate resi
dences.
Griffith said many University
officials who would be responsible
for both policy and operations
during an earthquake took part in
a simulation of a 7.1 temblor last
week.
"Those kinds of exercises are
very helpful because they get peo
ple thinking about responses" to
an earthquake, Griffith added.
"The downside is that the fur
ther away we get from a major
event, the more apathetic we get,"
Griffith said. "We're still finding
things we can be doing better" to
prepare for earthquakes, especial
ly increasing education of the
Stanford community, she added.
The next big one
Geologists agree that there is
no doubt that there will be more
major earthquakes on the nearby
San Andreas and Hayward fault
lines. They say it is just a matter
of time before the next "big one"
hits.
"There are more earthquakes
in Stanford's future — that we

can be sure of," said Geology
Prof. Paul Segall. The best course
of action, he said, is for the Uni
versity and individuals to prepare
for earthquakes as much as possi
ble.
While "there are always finan
cial limitations," said Segall, "the
University has taken a prudent
course by undergoing seismic
retrofitting. Those buildings
which had already been
retrofitted [before the 1989
quake] did well, and those which
hadn't, didn't."
Segall said that Stanford is
"not in too bad of an area" in
terms of potential earthquake
damage. The areas which are
most susceptible are those built
on fill, such as San Francisco's
Marina district, and hilly areas
which pose a danger of landslides,
he said.
In addition to the obvious dan
ger of a major quake on Uie San
Andreas Fault, such as the. 8.3
temblor whicn nearly leveled i3an
Francisco in 1906, Segall said the
University should be concerned
about possible quakes occurring
on smaller faults — some of which
actually run through the Stanford
campus.
Stanford is at risk from an
earthquake on the Hayward,
Monte Vista, Calaveras, and San

Gregorio fault lines, in addition to
the San Andreas Fault, said Mike
Rymer, a geologist with the Unit
ed States Geologic Survey. The
epicenter of the Loma Prieta
quake was located 55 miles south
west of Stanford, in Hollister.
Geophysics Prof. Robert
Kovach said there are many faults
on the Stanford campus — such
as a fault campus geologists just
finished studying on French
man's Road — which are sub
sidiaries of larger ones like the
San Andreas Fault.
Although most smaller faults
cannot generate truly large earth
quakes, Rymer said that even a
6.0 would be "devastating" if it
occurred in an urban zone, as last
year's Northridge earthquake
proved.
"This area has been very
quiet" and is a potential "hotspot"
on the San Andreas Fault, Kovach
said. He added that there will cer
the next 50 years to tension
that has built bn the San Andreas
and Hayward Faults.
"The best way to prepare for
the next quake is to make build
ings stronger, which is why we're
spending money on the inner
quad. The faults themselves
aren't going to go away," Kovach
added.
