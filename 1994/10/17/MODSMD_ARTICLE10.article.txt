# Network supporting gay grads
## Gradnet Lambda still providing supportive community 
### Jamie Taylor Staff writer 
While Stanford's awareness of lesbian, gay and
bisexual issues seems to be growing — due in part to
last year's vandalism of the "Gay Liberation" stat
ues and ever-increasing campus activism — these
issues are nothing new to the community itself.
But even before the growth of campus awareness,
Gradnet Lambda quietly remained a supportive net
work for the graduate student segment of this Stan
ford community.
The group, specifically designed to meet the needs
of lesbian, gay and bisexual graduate and profes
sional students at Stanford, has an e-mail distribu
tion of about 120 people.
Gradnet Lambda has been formally recognized by
the ASSU for the last three years, but creators
began forming ideas more than a year before that,
said R. J. Fleck, a graduate student in music and a
member of the group.
"I think that graduate students have an identifi
ably different set of needs and expectations," Fleck
said. "For example, undergraduates tend to live on
campus in group settings, which helps to provide a
community-forming environment. Graduate stu
dents tend to be more dispersed."
Steve Pitts, a chemistry doctoral student and a
member of Gradnet Lambda, agreed that because

graduate students are scattered on and off campus,
it is more difficult for lesbian, gay and bisexual grad
uate students to form a coherent community.
"One of the issues we discuss a lot is the degree to
which the graduate housing program directs itself to
queer students," he said.
Pitts added that "Gradnet Lambda has really
helped to create a sense of community with queer
grads."
"The great thing is that [Stanford 1 is a great place
for people to come out," said Jason P. Lorber, anoth
er member of Gradnet Lambda. "I, for one, have
realized that the straight people here aren't homo
phobic."
Last Thursday night, Gradnet Lambda hosted its
first event of the year, an orientation gathering. The
group hosted social gatherings every other Thursday
at the Bridge last year, as well as a number of other
programs including presentations by Stanford facul
ty members. English Prof. Ron Rebholz, for exam
ple, presented a speech on homoeroticism in Shake
spearean sonnets.
Many of Stanford's professional graduate pro
grams have lesbian, gay and bisexual community
groups within their specific schools.
Lorber said that "you can belong to a city, a state,
and a country, and this is sort of the relationship
between the business school group and Gradnet
Lambda — it just makes us a bigger family."
