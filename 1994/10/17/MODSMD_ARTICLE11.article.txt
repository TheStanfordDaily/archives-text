## Aristide returns to Haiti Many difficulties still lie ahead for troubled country 
### 
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) - Strains of
Handel's "Messiah" flooded a pro-democracy church
where hundreds of Haitians gathered yesterday to
give thanks for President Jean-Bertrand Aristide'
return to power.
But in an illustration of the difficulties still
ahead as the country emerges from three years of
military repression, about two dozen vigilantes
wielding machetes, clubs and rocks went from
house to house in a Port-au-Prince slum, looking
for members of a paramilitary group known to have
killed and brutalized Aristide supporters.
Led by a man with "Lavalas" shaved into his
head, the name of Aristide's popular movement,
the vigilantes took stereos and televisions from the
cinderblock houses in Cite Soleil and stomped on
them.
They found a suspected militia member and
bloodied his wife's face as she told them to leave her
husband alone. A neighbor finally convinced them
to leave.
The rampage yesterday afternoon came less
than 24 hours after Aristide preached peace and
reconciliation to the Haitian people in a victori

ous speech at the sprawling white National
Palace.
Aristide's government already was moving to
identify human rights violators among Haiti's mili
tary so they could disarm and fire them, sources
close to the government said yesterday.
"That first process. . .is supposed to be happen
ing now," Mike Levy, an American aide to the Aris
tide government, told The Associated Press yester
day.
He said special attention would be paid to the
anti-gang units, which arrested and tortured Aris
tide supporters during the military regime that
ended this month with the departure of the men
who orchestrated the 1991 coup.
Aristide plans to trim the 7,450-member army to
1,500. Some of those identified for retirement will
be assigned to U.S.-funded retraining or re-educa
tion programs.
But the large number of Haitian soldiers aban
doning their posts in recent days makes the number
uncertain.
"There may not even be 1,500 people in the army
right now," Levy said.
