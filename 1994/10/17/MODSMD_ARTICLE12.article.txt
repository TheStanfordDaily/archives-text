JERUSALEM (AP) - Israel agreed yes
terday to resume talks with the Palestini
ans on extending autonomy in the occupied
lands, after they were suspended last week
over the kidnapping of an Israeli soldier by
Islamic militants.
A spokesman for Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin said negotiations would
resume in Cairo, Egypt, on Tuesday. PLO
leader Yasser Arafat declined comment, but
Palestinian sources said privately that they
would attend the talks.
The Israeli Cabinet also reopened the
Gaza Strip, sealed off during the kidnap
ping crisis. But ministers emphasized they
expected Arafat to continue with his
crackdown against Hamas, the militant
fundamentalist group that captured the
soldier.
Talks were suspended following the
abduction of 19-year-old Nachshon Wax
man, who was killed by his captors Friday
night when Israeli commandos stormed
their hideout near Jerusalem. A commando

and three militants also died in the raid.
Fallout from the raid was still felt yes
terday in Gaza, where hundreds of Pales
tinian police blocked roads in central Gaza
City to prevent riots, then joined Israeli sol
diers in defusing protests by hundreds of
Islamic militants near an isolated Jewish
settlement.
Violence also was reported in the West
Bank, where soldiers shot and killed a
Palestinian, 22-year-old Emad Edabe, near
Hebron after he refused orders to halt. The
army said Edabe had appeared to be com
mitting a theft.
Under intense pressure from Rabin, who
believed incorrectly that Waxman was
being held in Palestinian-controlled Gaza,
Arafat arrested 160 fundamentalists in a
two-day sweep last week.
Arafat had been reluctant to crack down
on 1 lamas since autonomy was established
in Gaza and Jericho in May, because the
movement has considerable support, in the
strip.
