U.S. warns Iraq
WASHINGTON (AP) - The United States will not
wait to retaliate the next time Saddam Hussein sends his
troops south to threaten Kuwait, Secretary of State War
ren Christopher said yesterday.
The warning came a day after the U.N. Security Coun
cil unanimously voted to demand that Iraq end all "hos
tile or provocative" actions against Kuwait.
"The message is clear," President Clinton said yester
day. "Iraq must complete its withdrawal. It must not
threaten its neighbors in the future."
Christopher, speaking on NBC's "Meet the Press," also
said it was improbable that Saddam can stay in power
even if he complies with all the U.N. resolutions required
to bring about a lifting of economic sanctions.
Christopher emphasized that the United States has all the
necessary authority it needs under existing U.N. resolutions
to attack Iraqi forces moving toward the Kuwaiti border.
"Next time, we'll probably not wait. We will take
action, strong action against him," the secretary said.
Christopher's warning was echoed by U.S. Ambassador

to the U.N. Madeleine K. Albright, who said the Mideast
region is vital to U.S. national interests and the United
States is prepared to go it alone to stop Iraqi aggression.
German election results
BONN, Germany (AP) — Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
government squeaked by with the thinnest of majorities
in yesterday's election, and the opposition, smelling
blood, predicted the imminent collapse of his 12-year-old
conservative coalition.
The results, including a strong showing by former East
German communists, marked a dramatic shift for the 80-
million-strong nation at the center of Europe.
Kohl's coalition was projected by the ARD television
network to win 329 seats in the 656-seat parliament, a
one-seat majority that Kohl called "workable."
The coalition "will be confirmed — barely — but
remains a coalition of losers," said Rudolf Scharping,
leader of the Social Democrats, the main opposition. "If
we don't take over now, we'll be in power by 1998, if not
sooner."
