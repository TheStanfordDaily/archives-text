CUE's science core idea
must be discussed openly
before committee action

ONE OF THE MAJOR recom
mendations in the Commis
sion on Undergraduate Edu
cation's report is the creation of a
core series for non-science majors
to replace the current distribution
requirements for mathematical sci
ences, natural sciences and tech
nology and applied science.
This recommendation is one of
the most important ideas the com
mission developed, as far too many
students graduate from Stanford
lacking substantial quantitative
reasoning skills. To fulfill the sci
ence DRs, non-science majors often
take courses such as Natural Haz
ards and Human Survival and
Chance and Strategy — many times
under the pass/no credit option.
In the interest of academic
breadth, science and engineering
majors are already required to take
Cultures, Ideas and Values. It is
similarly crucial that humanities
and social sciences majors gain
exposure to quantitative reasoning
through a required science core.
Yet in many ways, the commis
sion's idea seems a nightmare in
the making. It will require a huge
commitment from the faculty to
teach the core, and a number of
questions will need to be answered
beforehand. What textbooks will be
used? How can the core be
sequenced to maintain a coherent
theme? What departments will the
teaching assistants come from?
The commission recognizes
these concerns in its report: "We
want to emphasize that to become
part of our requirements, the
course must have broadly based
support among the faculty and a
clear, long-term claim on institu
tional resources. If the course
depends on the participation of a
few individuals and short-term

financial support, it will prove as
ephemeral as have previous experi
ments of this sort."
The science core is now in the
hands of a design committee for
implementation appointed by Uni
versity Provost Condoleezza Rice.
This committee is responsible for
answering all the logistical ques
tions and devising a plan detailing
exactly how the core would work.
But in many ways, this approach
seems backward.
Once the idea reaches a commit
tee, it will lose the momentum it
gained from the commission, and
one of two things will likely hap
pen. Either the idea will die
because of a lack of commitment or
resources, or a specific plan will
emerge for the core. Neither case
leaves much room for debate about
what is best for Stanford and its
undergraduates.
There seems to be a strong sense
from the commission that things
need to be changed, but it is not
clear that this sense pervades the
University. Before this idea is
shipped off to the committee, it
needs to be debated before the Fac
ulty Senate and throughout cam
pus. Is this science core series
something that all of Stanford will
stand behind and support? Or is it
something that sounds good in the
ory but will fall apart when depart
ments find they need to provide
TAs?
The Faculty Senate, science and
engineering departments, students
and other bodies on campus need to
discuss the possibilities and deter
mine how much support — finan
cial and otherwise — exists for the
core. Only after the University has
a clear sense of the mission of the
science core — and the reasoning
behind the DR system in general —
should the design committee begin
its work.
Otherwise, if it is simply passed
on to a committee without Uni
versity-wide discussion, the sci
ence core may wither and die and
a remarkable idea may be lost for
ever.
