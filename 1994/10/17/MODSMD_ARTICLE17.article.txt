## Liberation by the Quad 
### 
ON ONE OF my not-so-infrequent
walks around campus, I took the
time to relax on a bench near the
Quad. It was a warm, breezy, Stanfordy
day, so lots of couples and families were
up and about, enjoying the sunshine. A
pair of rollerbladers pirouetted and leapt
by, followed by a couple who were less
acrobatically inclined
A small group of people approached â€”
two men and two women. One of the lat
ter plopped down next to me, clearly
exhausted from hobbling around on heels
too high for her own good. The other
woman, casually dressed and with long,
flowing hair, joined her, placing her hand
gently on the high-heeled woman's knee.
Without eavesdropping, of course, I
happened to listen in on the ensuing con
versation.
"Why do you think they did this to us?"
the first one asked, putting her hand on
the other's. The long-haired woman
looked pensive for a moment, gazing out
at another herd of rollerbladers. She had
a pretty face, I thought, then remembered
this was a thought best not printed in a
column at a politically correct university.
"They probably didn't mean it, Katie.
You know how it goes, after a party, they
probably got drunk, and. . .." Her voice
tapered off, apparently doubting the
truth of what it was uttering.
Katie was less hesitant. "Oh, Jenny,
don't defend them! They certainly did
mean it, those [expletives deleted]. Sam

still hasn't quite recovered, you know."
Sam was indeed hunching over a bit,
supported by his companion, who was
whispering something in his ear.
"It was hatred, Jenny, pure hatred!
They don't like the way we live, the
things we do and the way we do them.
They're making us responsible for the
entire moral decay of society, as if we're
part of some sort of subversive plot.
They're goaded on by quailing hatemon
gers and talk-show hosts who feel their
sexuality threatened and want to take it
out on us."
"They're just scared, Katie. They
don't understand us, and ignorance
breeds fear, which in turn breeds hatred.
They see a sound-bitten distortion of our
lifestyle, and feel that theirs is put at
risk." Jenny paused a moment. "Besides,
they're probably just jealous we can
screw around as much as we want with
out getting pregnant."
At that, Katie cracked a slight smile,
which quickly turned rueful as she
thought of where some of Sam's friends
were now.
A wedding party emerged from
beneath the arches. The groom looked
rather uncomfortable and bewildered in
his rented tux, while the bride was clad in
an unblemished white gown, albeit
slightly bulging at the waist. A gaggle of
photographers herded them over to the
scenic steps of the soon-to-be-demolished
Phvsics Tank, where thev underwent a

barrage of snapshots.
Katie looked wistfully at the wedding
party for a long while. "Why should they
dictate whom we're permitted to sleep
with and what we're allowed to do in our
bedrooms? Who are they to tell me whom
I have the right to love and care for?
What right do they have to tell me how to
lead my life and whom to lead it with?"
The breeze had picked up a little and
was getting slightly chilly. Jenny stood
up and quietly pulled Katie to her feet.
"They have no such right, Katie. They're
caught in a web of ignorance and dis
trust. But the more they know, the more
they will learn to be tolerant, and the
more they will abandon their false preju
dices and fears. Then they, too, will be
truly free." The four of them began mak
ing their way to the parking lot.
I sat for a few minutes, gazing after
them, then started on my walk home.
Sidestepping a stumbling rollerblader or
two, I wondered to myself how many
times I had stooped to contempt, con
demnation or ridicule. And the more I
thought about it, the more I hoped that
the winds of freedom would never again
breed hatred, ignorance or fear, but
rather tolerance and understanding.

Jonathan Huston wonders if the
Burghers of Calais are talking about him
behind his back again.
