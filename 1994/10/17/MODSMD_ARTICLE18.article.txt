At CTL, efforts are underway to improve TA system

THE DAILY'S OCT. 11 editorial
("TAs need assistance") stressing
the importance of teaching assis
tants and TA training at Stanford was a
welcome contribution to an ongoing pro
cess of discussion, debate and program
development.
By focusing attention on the
"extraordinary influence" that TAs
have on undergraduate education, you
helped shed light on how critically
important it is that teaching assistants
receive the very highest levels of train
ing, supervision, evaluation and sup
port. As The Daily reported Oct. 10,
University President Gerhard Casper

and Provost Condoleezza Rice have
recently allocated new term funding to
the Center for Teaching and Learning
to work with departments in enlarging
existing programs of TA training and
establishing new TA training initia
tives. These efforts are now underway
and, we hope, will soon be showing
results in even better educational expe
riences for undergraduate and gradu
ate students alike.
Where The Daily's editorial may
have omitted relevant information,
however, was in its criticism of TAs
who do not have "full mastery over
the English language." Stanford is, of

course, an international institution
with graduate students from every
part of the globe, but, in point of fact,
TAs who are not native English speak
ers are thoroughly screened and pro
vided with specially designed course
work through a comprehensive and
effective program run by Beverley
McChesney, director of the English for
Foreign Students Program in the Lin
guistics Department.
Research elsewhere also indicates
that when undergraduates are told that
an instructor is not a native speaker
(even when that is not in fact the case),
they evaluate the person's instruction

more negatively. In other words, stu
dents sometimes assume that they will
have problems in a class with an inter
national TA simply because the TA is
not a native speaker of English. We
hope that this is not the case with stu
dents here and that undergraduates
will work with TAs and departments to
make sure that sections are successful
for all concerned.
