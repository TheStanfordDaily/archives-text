# Sand Hill Road projects will ease traffic woes
## 
### 
I want to address an impression given
by Menlo Park City Council Member
Gail Slocum in the Oct. 3 article, "Uni
versity Plans Development."
Slocum suggested that increased traf
fic on a Sand Hill Road connected to El
Camino Real will lead to an increase in
traffic on residential streets. It will actu
ally do just the opposite. Traffic analysis
shows that an improved Sand Hill Road
connected to El Camino will draw traffic
off of nearby residential streets and onto
Sand Hill Road. Many motorists now
choose to drive on the residential streets
because Sand Hill Road is not available.
An improved Sand Hill Road, in tandem
with an improved Quarry Road, will be a
much more functional and efficient
route than the existing Sand Hill Road,
which currently dead-ends in the Stan
ford Shopping Center parking lot.
The traffic, environmental and eco
nomic impact of the Sand Hill Road pro
jects will be further analyzed and dis
cussed in the Environmental Impact
Report (EIR), which will be prepared by
professional consultants hired by and

under the direction of the City of Palo
Alto. There will be much public discus
sion of these issues and public testimony
will be taken.
We are confident that the public will
recognize the many benefits these pro
jects will have for the entire community.
