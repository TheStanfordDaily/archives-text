# A 						shaken institution?
## Language depts, admissions yield and budget still suffering 
### Frank Guinan Staff writer 
Despite the closure of several struc
tures on campus and a drop in the yield
rate for incoming freshman classes, Uni
versity officials assert that the 1989 Loma
Prieta Earthquake has had little effect on
the school's academic caliber or long
range outlook over the last five years.
"I think the impact on Stanford's rep
utation . . . has been nil," said Stephen
Peeps, associate vice president of the De
velopment Office.

But the quake's effects on several
University resources — effects that may
be damaging the long-term health of the
institution — have not been so easily
overlooked.
Among those structures still closed
due to the 7.1 quake are Green Library
West, the Stanford Art Museum and the
Language and Geology Corners in the
Main Quad.
The closures have become part of
everyday life for many. But for those who
worked in the now-closed buildings, the
resources lost and the amount of time it

has taken to begin reconstruction are
still a concern.
Foreign languages suffer
According to Ralph Hester, chair of
the French and Italian Department, the
quake has had a "tremendous impact" on
the foreign language departments on
campus.
Before the quake, the Language Cor
ner (Building 260) housed the Spanish
and Portuguese, French and Italian, and

incurred in the quake.
Slavic Languages departments.
Since the quake, however, the
departments have been housed at
the Wilbur Modules.
At Stanford, foreign language
"has been held isolated," Hester
said. The movement of the
departments from the Main Quad
has "tended to confirm what peo
ple thought [about the isolation]
before the quake," he added.
Decreasing enrollment also has
been a problem for the foreign
languages since the Loma Prieta
Earthquake.
Lazar Fleishman, chair of the
Slavic Languages and Literature
Department, attributes his
department's decreasing figures
to the relocation at the modules.
"We've had decreases of 50 per
cent in some courses," Fleishman
said. "We don't know for sure that
it was due to the quake, but that's
what we suspect."
Spanish and Portuguese Prof.
Mary Pratt also said her depart
ment has suffered a decrease in
morale since it moved from the
Quad.
"Space is symbolically impor
tant," she said. "To be stuck in
the edge of campus is a significant
thing."
A generation loses out
The Language Corner is not
the only inconvenience students
and faculty have had to deal with
over the past five years. The Geol
ogy Corner, Green Library West
and the museum are resources the
senior class has yet to see or use.
"It's very compelling when we
talk to donors and tell them a

whole generation of students com
pleted their Stanford careers with
out the use of [these resourcesl,"
said Jack Hickethier, acting direc
tor of major gifts at the Develop
ment Office.
Stanford has taken numerous
steps, however, to improve the sit
uation. The University's recent
settlement with the Federal
Emergency Management Agency
this spring has set the stage for
the reconstruction of these build
ings. (see related story)
However, another two or three
classes will have graduated by the
time the restoration of Green
Library West, the museum and
the Geology and Language Cor
ners is completed.
Most campus officials, though,
believe the loss of these resources
has not significantly affected the
school's image or academic reputa
tion in the community or nation.
"The main effect [of the earth
quake] has been on the checkbook
of Facilities," said William Stone,
president of the Alumni Associa
tion. "The institution has been
unharmed though."
Plans for restoring and
strengthening earthquake-dam
aged buildings have been long and
drawn out, mainly because of the
inability to convince alumni and
community members that con
struction still needs to be done.
"I don't think people have
realized yet what has closed
down," Peeps said. "People on
campus know, but people at large
are pretty clueless."
Peeps added that alumni who
visited the campus this weekend
for their class reunions were often
surprised at what structures were
still closed down.
"The earthquake has left the
school with holes that we've had

problems convincing everybody
we have," he said.
Peeps said he believes even
University President Gerhard
Casper was surprised at what
problems Stanford faced because
of the earthquake when he took
office two years ago.
"It's been he who said it's a
bigger problem than everyone
realizes," he said.
Admissions concerns
Concern about Stanford's aca
demic credibility and attraction also
arose shortly after the quake and
was, in fact, backed by admissions
figures before and after the temblor.
In the spring of 1989, the yield
rate — the percentage of admitted
students who chose to enroll at
Stanford — stood at 59.7 percent,
which was comparable to the 60
percent average yield rate
throughout the 1980s. The yield
rate in the spring of 1990 dropped,
however, to 56.7 percent.
A more telling comparison
comes from looking at the num
ber of students applying to Stan
ford, which dropped from 14,912
in 1989 to 12,950 in 1990.
"Earthquakes are clearly on
the minds of students, especially
outside California," said James
Montoya, dean of admissions and
financial aids.
Montoya added that the decrease
in yield rate was "a drop which we
have never recovered from." The
yield rate for this year's freshman
class was 54 percent.
Julie Taylor, associate director
of admissions, said that on a
recent visit to high schools in the
southeast, the question of earth
quakes was "inevitable."

"It comes up a lot in schools
especially east of the Mississippi,"
she said, adding that when stu
dents come to visit the campus,
they "notice the [reinforced wood
en] arches [in the Quadl and
always ask about it."
In addition, speculation has
arisen that the decreasing yield rate
may have caused a decline in the
quality of students here and affect
ed Stanford's place in the popular
U.S. News and World Report rank
ings of undergraduate colleges.
Peeps, however, contended
there was no correlation at all
between the rankings and the
earthquake.
"That is a crazy speculation,"
he said. "The rankings are based
on academic resources ... [and]
the most weight is put on faculty
quality."
Stanford was ranked number
one in the 1987 poll, but dropped
to sixth in 1989 just before the
quake hit. In the poll the follow
ing year, the University's ranking
actually jumped to number two.
Stanford is currently ranked fifth.
Projects postponed
Estimates for the renovation
efforts on campus have ranged
from $150 million to $200 million.
Such figures have led to questions
about how attention and money
have been diverted away from
other projects on campus.
An example of such a project is
the science and engineering quad,
which was originally planned in
1986.
Hickethier remembered in the
early years of the Centennial
Campaign, the school was "very
actively fund raising for the sci

ence quad." The activity stopped
after the quake and only now has
been rejuvenated by the $77.4
million gift from Silicon Valley
entrepreneurs William Hewlett
and David Packard.
"In any given time, there are

things the University plans to do,"
said Geoffrey Cox, vice provost for
institutional planning. "The earth
quake has put extra pressure on
the budget... [but] there has been
no conscious choice not to fund
certain things."

Many students were displaced after Loma Prieta as four houses
were closed for the remainder of the school year.
