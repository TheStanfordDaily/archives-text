# University should set aside parking space to revive tailgate tradition
## 
### 
The construction of the new Arrilla
ga Family Sports Center and the land
scaping of the area between Maples
Pavilion and DeGuerre Pool was an all
around success and boon for the stu
dent body. But there was one unfortu
nate side effect. Prior to construction,
the old lacrosse field (where Arrillaga
now stands) was available for football
tailgate parking. While anyone could
park there for free, it was the tradition
al place for student-group tailgaters.
Fraternities, sororities, club sports,
graduate schools, and other clubs all
had their tailgaters on the field, and it

was a place for a healthy mingling of
students and a burgeoning of school
spirit. Alumni affiliated with these
groups would get a chance to relive
their days as eager Stanford football
fans. Fun was had by all.
With the disappearance of a central
ized, commonly agreed-upon location
for student tailgaters, much of the fla
vor and excitement of the football
games disappeared as well. Now, small
groups of students are dispersed
throughout the general parking area
surrounding the stadium. It is hard to
find other students, much less your
own group's tailgater, and inviting
other students to revel in the sun is
much more difficult. It's not so fun
anymore.
It would be a simple matter for the
Athletic Department to set aside, say,
Angell Field or one half of one intramu
ral field for student parking. An adver
tisement in The Daily and a big sign on
game day would probably suffice. It
wouldn't have to be a prime parking
location (the old lacrosse field wasn't).
Furthermore, pedestrian traffic around
the stadium would likely be reduced and
not-so-friendly interaction of home and
visitor fans would also likely be reduced,
easing the burden of crowd manage-

ment.
I've heard this complaint from many
students. For me and for others, football
games just aren't as fun.
Bring back the Cardinal spirit!
