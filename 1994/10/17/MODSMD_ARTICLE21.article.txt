# Student objects to N.J., Physics Tank analogy

### 
I am a lifelong and proud resident
of the state of New Jersey and there
fore feel that I have an obligation to
refute comments made in the Oct. 13
edition of The Daily by Physics
Department Chair Douglas Osheroff
("Love or Hate? Assessing the Physics
Tank").
Specifically, I take exception to his
analogy, used in a discussion of the
Physics Tank's aesthetics and useful
ness, that "New Jersey is to California
as the Physics Tank is to the new lec
ture hall." While New Jersey has its
share of both problems and eyesores, it
is not nor has ever been anywhere near
as ugly as the Physics Tank.
