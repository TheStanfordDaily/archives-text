## USC capitalizes on mistakes and edges Cardinal 27-20 Penalties, fumble and chaos disrupt Stanford

USC 27

Week in and week out, Stanford continues to find
new ways to lose football games.
A costly penalty for too many men on the field, a
fumbled kickoff, failing at fourth-and-one at the two
yard line and a freakish two-play exchange late in the
fourth quarter sealed the Cardinal's doom as USC
came away with a 27-20 victory Saturday at Stanford
Stadium.
Despite losing last year's All-Pacific 10 Confer
ence quarterback Rob Johnson to an ankle sprain in
the second quarter, the Trojans (4-2, 3-1 in Pac-10)
played error-free football long enough for Stanford
(1-4-1, 0-3) to make enough mistakes to lose.
"We played extremely well at times, and self
destructed as we've done in a number of games ear
lier," head coach Bill Walsh said. "A lot of these are
freshmen mistakes. I can see many ways in which we
could have won that game."
Three distinct moments stand out as turning
points in the field. The first one occurred in the sec
ond quarter, with Stanford up 10-7. Johnson had
just left the game and sophomore transfer Brad
Otton had taken over at quarterback. After two wild
ly incomplete passes, the Trojans were forced to punt
and the Cardinal was prepared to take over at its
own 20-yard line.
However, a 15-yard penalty against Stanford for
having 12 men on the field gave the ball back to USC
at the Cardinal 27-yard line. Two plays later, Shawn
Walters bowled over junior cornerback Kwame Ellis
for the go-ahead touchdown.
"It is mind-boggling," Walsh said of the penalty,
caused by a freshman who failed to come off the
field. "We rehearse and practice, but people get emo
tional. It happens."
On the ensuing kickoff, freshman Damon Dunn
coughed up the ball and the Trojans took over at the
Cardinal 31-yard line. USC ran the last three-and-a
half minutes off the clock before Cole Ford kicked a
19-yard field goal, giving the Trojans a 17-10 half
time lead.
The second harbinger of doom came on Stanford's
first possession of the second half. After driving
down 85 yards to the USC two-yard line, sophomore
fullback Adam Salina was stopped for no gain on
fourth-and-one, turning the ball back over to the
Trojans.

USC then drove 92 yards on 16 plays, culminating
in Ford's 23-yard field goal. The five minute, 39 sec
ond drive took away any momentum Stanford may
have had starting the second half.
"We're just not getting the breaks this year," said
freshman running back Anthony Bookman. "We just
make key mistakes and the mistakes we make kill
us."

After Eric Abrams' 33-yard field goal in the begin
ning of the fourth quarter made it 20-13, the Cardi
nal was again poised to get back into the game. How
ever, four plays into an impressive drive by Stanford,
the ceiling fell in on the Cardinal's hopes with 4:07
left on the clock.
