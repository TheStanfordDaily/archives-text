## USC capitalizes on mistakes and edges Cardinal 27-20 Penalties, fumble and chaos disrupt Stanford 
### Greg Collins Staff writer 
USC 27

Week in and week out, Stanford continues to find
new ways to lose football games.
A costly penalty for too many men on the field, a
fumbled kickoff, failing at fourth-and-one at the two
yard line and a freakish two-play exchange late in the
fourth quarter sealed the Cardinal's doom as USC
came away with a 27-20 victory Saturday at Stanford
Stadium.
Despite losing last year's All-Pacific 10 Confer
ence quarterback Rob Johnson to an ankle sprain in
the second quarter, the Trojans (4-2, 3-1 in Pac-10)
played error-free football long enough for Stanford
(1-4-1, 0-3) to make enough mistakes to lose.
"We played extremely well at times, and self
destructed as we've done in a number of games ear
lier," head coach Bill Walsh said. "A lot of these are
freshmen mistakes. I can see many ways in which we
could have won that game."
Three distinct moments stand out as turning
points in the field. The first one occurred in the sec
ond quarter, with Stanford up 10-7. Johnson had
just left the game and sophomore transfer Brad
Otton had taken over at quarterback. After two wild
ly incomplete passes, the Trojans were forced to punt
and the Cardinal was prepared to take over at its
own 20-yard line.
However, a 15-yard penalty against Stanford for
having 12 men on the field gave the ball back to USC
at the Cardinal 27-yard line. Two plays later, Shawn
Walters bowled over junior cornerback Kwame Ellis
for the go-ahead touchdown.
"It is mind-boggling," Walsh said of the penalty,
caused by a freshman who failed to come off the
field. "We rehearse and practice, but people get emo
tional. It happens."
On the ensuing kickoff, freshman Damon Dunn
coughed up the ball and the Trojans took over at the
Cardinal 31-yard line. USC ran the last three-and-a
half minutes off the clock before Cole Ford kicked a
19-yard field goal, giving the Trojans a 17-10 half
time lead.
The second harbinger of doom came on Stanford's
first possession of the second half. After driving
down 85 yards to the USC two-yard line, sophomore
fullback Adam Salina was stopped for no gain on
fourth-and-one, turning the ball back over to the
Trojans.

USC then drove 92 yards on 16 plays, culminating
in Ford's 23-yard field goal. The five minute, 39 sec
ond drive took away any momentum Stanford may
have had starting the second half.
"We're just not getting the breaks this year," said
freshman running back Anthony Bookman. "We just
make key mistakes and the mistakes we make kill
us."

After Eric Abrams' 33-yard field goal in the begin
ning of the fourth quarter made it 20-13, the Cardi
nal was again poised to get back into the game. How
ever, four plays into an impressive drive by Stanford,
the ceiling fell in on the Cardinal's hopes with 4:07
left on the clock.

Although he's no bologne, senior quarterback Steve Stenstrom finds himself sandwiched between to
Trojans last Saturday.
On first-and-ten at the USC
33-yard line, a Stenstrom pass was
blocked up into the air by Trojan
linebacker Errol Small. The loose
ball fell right into Small's waiting
hands, ending yet another promis
ing Stanford drive.
On the very next play, Walters
rim around the right side of the line,
cut between two Cardinal defenders
and exploded down the sideline for a
61-yard touchdown run, putting
USC up 27-13 with four minutes
left. It was a fitting end to a stun
ning performance by Walters as he
carried 31 times for 234 yards and
two touchdowns in the night.
"They hit us in a blitz and
popped it through," senior nose
tackle Jason Fisk said. "If you have
a blitz on, once you get past some
guys you have some running room."
These three slices of self-destruc
tion happened in only seconds, but
they are the kinds of mistakes which
have made the difference between
Stanford's present 1-4-1 record and
a very possible 4-2 mark.
"You can't compete at this level
when you're kicking yourself in the
shins like that," Armour said. "It's
just no-win football."
Walsh had similar views on Stan
ford's mistake-prone team.
"These are the kind of things
that, because we are on such a nar
row ledge playing football, those
things can really kill us because we
depend heavily on execution,"
Walsh said. "We're not demonstrat

ing the resourcefulness to make the
big play. Justin Armour makes
tremendous catches downfield and
Steve Stenstrom moves and avoids
people and throws the ball, but
we're not making the big play out of
nowhere."

Stenstrom and Armour teamed
up severed times on the day, includ
ing three crucial catches on Stan
ford's final scoring drive. Stenstrom
was 27-for-44 for 344 yards with
one touchdown and two intercep
tions. One of those interceptions

was a meaningless errant throw at
the end of the first half, and the
other came on a play Armour said
that "never happens in the history
of the world except against us."
Another record-setting day by
Stenstrom was soured by the loss as
he surpassed two records held by
Stanford's John Elway. A 65-yard
screen pass in the first quarter
broke Elway's career passing record
at Stanford and Stenstrom later
topped Elway's Pac-10 record for
career total offense. Stenstrom now
has 9,626 yards passing (bowl
games not included) and 9,298
yards of total offense (bowl games
included).
In the fourth quarter alone, Sten
strom was 11-for-20 for 175 yards,
including seven passes for 140 yards
to Armour. For the night, Armour
caught eight balls for 153 yards.
Despite closing the score to 27-20
with a late four-yard touchdown
pass from Stenstrom to sophomore
flanker Brian Manning, Stanford
couldn't get the ball back until there
were only 14 seconds left on the
clock. Two Hail Mary passes fell
incomplete and the Cardinal lost its
fourth in a row.
What makes the loss even hard
er to stomach was the regained
ground attack Stanford displayed.
Rushing 35 times for 150 yards,
the Cardinal showed ability to
move the ball on the ground when
necessary. Bookman had his best
day as a collegian, carrying 10
times for 73 yards and one beauti
ful 20-yard touchdown run where
he scampered around the right side
behind crushing blocks by Armour
and senior tight end Tony Cline.

Senior Ethan Allen, starting in
place of the injured Mike Mitchell,
proved Stanford's most flexible
offensive weapon. Running 10 times
for 64 yards, he also had 96 yards
receiving on six catches, highlighted
by the 65-yard screen pass.
However, the Cardinal's ground
game paled in comparison to USC's,
as the Trojans picked up 266 yards
on 39 carries behind the powerful
running of Walters.
"You establish a great running
game and you win the game, just
like SC, that's what they do," Book
man said. "We ran the ball, but they
ran it much more efficiently."
Defensively, Stanford gave up
489 yards and forced no turnovers.
Several key missed tackles show
cased this defense's inability to
come up with the big stop time and
time again. Although Walsh contin
ues to use inexperience as an expla
nation, Fisk disagrees.
"By now, you've had half the sea
son to play," he said. "Those mis
takes can plague you your first day
out but by the time you've played
five, six games you should be ready
to go. There's no excuse saying inex
perience is hurting us. Those guys
should be experienced. They've got
to make tackles, plain and simple."
Looking up at the Rose Bowl race
from the cellar of the Pac-10, Stan
ford once again faces a week of
introspection.
"We've got five games left to
regain a little respect and to fmd out
what we're worth," Armour said. "If
you're going to buckle up and roll
over and die when you lose a couple
of football games, then you're going
to be a pathetic person later on."
