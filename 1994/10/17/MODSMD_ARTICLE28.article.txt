# Stanford loses due to basics, not ability
## 
### Kathryn Yang Senior staff writer 
The anything-that-can-go-wrong-will-go-wrong
type of football game Stanford played on Saturday
was just begging for abuse and criticism in the next
day's papers.
And sure enough, the Sunday sports pages turned
out to be public stonings for the offense, defense and
anyone even remotely associated with the squad. Cri
tiques ranged from calling Stanford a poorly coached
team to eulogizing an already lost cause.
Everyone put in their two cents about the demise
of Cardinal football, but no one fully realized the tal
ent and potential that has been on display thus far.
Despite a dismal 1-4-1 start, Stanford's season is
salvageable. Using a hackneyed piece of football lingo,
the Cardinal just "have to go back to the basics." The
27-20 loss to USC was not due to an overmatching, it
happened because Stanford did not execute and did
not perform the fundamentals well enough to deserve
a victory.
How many times have coaches drilled the phrase
"you must not lose a game on penalties" into the
heads of players, fans and other faithfuls?
The Stanford players must have nightmares about
that warning, dating back to their Pop Warner foot
ball days. But on Saturday against the Trojans, that
football tenet was carelessly flouted and the results
were disastrous. Not once but twice, the best academ
ically-rated NCAA Division I football team had too
many men on the field.
The first time Stanford paraded 12 men onto the
field occurred in the second quarter. Having secured
an early 10-7 lead, the Cardinal defense forced the
Trojans to punt on a fourth-and-four situation, but
the illegal procedure called against Stanford nullified
the punt and awarded USC with an automatic first
down.
The men of Troy then marched the remaining 42
yards down the field and posted an easy touchdown
for a lead they never did relinquish.
"We played extremely well at times and self
destructed as we've done a number of other times,"
said head coach Bill Walsh.
Equally as important as the penalties — not to
mention, equally as distressing — the issue of
turnovers managed to steal the spotlight one too
many times during the game.
What's true in basketball, hockey and other fast
paced sports is also true in football — if you hold onto
the bell, your chances of scoring improves dramatical
ly-
After USC took the lead 14-10 on Stanford's men
tal error, the Cardinal suffered another brain spasm
on the ensuing kick off. Freshman
kick returner Damon Dunn was
stripped of the ball by USC's Ger
ald Caruthers. The Trojans then
connected on a 19-yard field goal
for a 17-10 lead.
Ijate in the fourth, Bill Walsh's
new prodigy, quarterback Steve
Stenstrom, had a chance to perform
the miracle Walsh's previous stu
dent had perfected into an art form
— the come-from-behind victory.
Down '20-13 on the Trojan's 39,
Stenstrom scooted out of the pock
et with plenty of time and misfired
into the hands of Errol Small. USC
tailback Shawn Walters then

sprinted for a 61-yard touchdown
on the next play.
Subtract a couple turnovers and
penalties from Stanford's perfor
mance and you have an entirely
new ball game. Both crucial
turnovers and the most devastat
ing penalty occurred when the Car
dinal had momentum on its side.
Stanford almost put it all
together. With 150 yards on the
ground and 344 in the air, the Car
dinal will remain the best offensive
threat in the Pac-10. The defense
even had flashes of brilliance
against the Trojans.
But only one thing can save the
Cardinal from waking up on Sun
days and finding themselves pub
licly pillorized in print — again.
It's got to be back to the basics
for Walsh and his boys.
