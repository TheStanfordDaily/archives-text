Cardinal 18

Knock-out.
The heaviest hitting between Stanford and USC
this weekend may not have happened on the grid
iron. In the waters of deGuerre Pool, the two schools
engaged in a physical slugfest between the No. 1 and
No. 2 teams in the nation.
In the end, top-ranked Stanford (14-1) delivered
the final blow, winning 18-10, although the Trojans
(10-4) instigated most of the extracurricular violence.

Led by Ail-American co-captain Wolf Wigo, who
scored a career-high six goals, the Cardinal bounced
back from an early 2-0 deficit to gain its third victory
this season over USC.
"That was definitely our most physical game of
the year," Wigo said. "We expected that, because we
heard that they played Cal pretty rough the day
before. Once we got up on them, they got really phys
ical. It wasn't only in the hole, there was a lot of fight
ing everywhere."
After the Trojans grabbed a 4-2 lead in the first
quarter, the game was all Stanford. At the end of the
opening period, sophomore Daniel Lehoczky scored a
goal with one second remaining to close the score to
4-3.
Then Wigo took over.
