Cardinal 18

Knock-out.
The heaviest hitting between Stanford and USC
this weekend may not have happened on the grid
iron. In the waters of deGuerre Pool, the two schools
engaged in a physical slugfest between the No. 1 and
No. 2 teams in the nation.
In the end, top-ranked Stanford (14-1) delivered
the final blow, winning 18-10, although the Trojans
(10-4) instigated most of the extracurricular violence.

Led by Ail-American co-captain Wolf Wigo, who
scored a career-high six goals, the Cardinal bounced
back from an early 2-0 deficit to gain its third victory
this season over USC.
"That was definitely our most physical game of
the year," Wigo said. "We expected that, because we
heard that they played Cal pretty rough the day
before. Once we got up on them, they got really phys
ical. It wasn't only in the hole, there was a lot of fight
ing everywhere."
After the Trojans grabbed a 4-2 lead in the first
quarter, the game was all Stanford. At the end of the
opening period, sophomore Daniel Lehoczky scored a
goal with one second remaining to close the score to
4-3.
Then Wigo took over.

manti.
"He just dominated," Dettaman
ti said. "He missed a shot early then
got punched — I think he got mad
and just took the game over. He's
the best player in the country and
he showed that."
Co-captain Frank Schneider,
who tossed in three goals of his own,
was also duly impressed. "Six goals
is amazing, especially against the
No. 2 team," he said. "It's an amaz
ing accomplishment, but that's the
type of player he is."
While Dettamanti has known
what type of player Wigo is, he is
pleased to be finding out what type

of team he has.
"This game was one of streaks for
us," Dettamanti continued, referring
to the 7-0 run and two other 3-0
runs. "The teams in 1981 and 1986
were also capable of having streaks
and exploding for goals. They had
the ability to be in a close game then
all of a sudden, it was over."
The Cardinal put USC away pri
marily by out-swimming the Tro
jans on the counter-attack.
"USC has a lot of big guys who
am really shoot," Dettamanti said.
"But as far as team speed, we're all
over them. We played great defense
and our counter went crazy."
The defense was led by goal
tender Jack Bowen and junior hole
guard Jeremy Laster, who had the
assignment of shutting down USC
holeman Hrvoje Cizmic.
"Jeremy held Cizmic down all

game," Dettamanti said. "He didn't
foul until the fourth, and he had lots
of steals. That's the best I've ever
seen him play two-meter defense."
Laster was able to contain 6-foot
5-inch, 220-pound Cizmic by close
awareness of his tendencies.
"He has one move, which is a
great move," said Laster, who also
contributed four goals on offense.
"He's really strong. If you try to foul
him normally, he just keeps going
like you're not there. I just tried to
get a piece of his shots and let Jack
block them."
Schneider called the win the
most satisfying league victory of his
Stanford career.
"We were able to completely con
trol our opposition," he said.
"That's the way we should consis
tently be playing, at a level above
everyone else."
