## Disputed documents delay Irwin hearing 
### September Treviño Staff writer 
Prosecution and defense teams
in the "Gay Liberation" statue
vandalism case argued heatedly
Friday over the delivery of certain
museum documents subpoenaed
by the defense, leading the judge
to set a separate hearing to settle
this dispute.
The conflict arose during the
preliminary hearing of senior
Thomas Irwin, one of she students
accused of defacing the statue last
spring. Irwin has pleaded not guilty
to charges of felony vandalism.
John Hackmann, Irwin's attor
ney, was concerned that he re
ceived only some of the docu
ments he subpoenaed last Thurs
day from the Stanford Art Muse
um, while other documents were
withheld by the prosecution.
The documents detail the dam
ages to the statue both before and
after the vandalism. Hackmann
said he wanted to reduce Irwin's
felony charges to misdemeanor —
a point that rests largely on the
appraisal of the sculpture's dam
ages. The crime can only be con
sidered a felony if damages exceed
$5,000.
Deputy District Attorney
Valerie Marchant said the muse
um was uncertain how to proceed
when it received the subpoena.
Museum officials delivered all
documents to Marchant's office
Friday before the hearing, she
said, because they did not know
which ones to give to the defense.
Marchant said she delivered rele
vant documents to Hackmann just
before the preliminary hearing, but
Hackmann asked that all docu
ments be turned over to the defense.
Palo Alto Municipal Court Judge
Rise Jones Pichon, concerned that
the issue would unnecessarily delay
Irwin's hearing, set a separate hear
ing to settle the dispute over docu
ments later this month.
The first witness at Friday's
hearing, Susan Roberts-Manganel
li, head of registration and conser
vation for the museum, was allied
by the prosecution to answer ques
tions about the physical and finan
cial damages to the sculpture. The
cost of repairing the sculpture
totaled $9,400.
During cross examination,
Hackmann questioned Roberts-
Manganelli about the condition of
the statue before the vandalism
on May 16.
Though some minor repairs
were needed prior to the vandal
ism incident, Roberts-Manganelli
said the statue was in "pretty
good condition."
Irwin's hearing will continue
Oct. 25, when the defense will fin
ish cross-examining Roberts-
Manganelli and the prosecution
will call two Stanford police offi
cers to the stand. The defense will
call on Museum Director Tom
Seligman to testify.
Todd Laßocca, a former Stan
ford student, also faces felony van
dalism charges. He pleaded no
contest at his preliminary hearing
and is awaiting formal sentencing.
The other four students charged
with the vandalism face misde
meanor charges and await a contin
uance of their pre-trial hearing
scheduled for later this month.
