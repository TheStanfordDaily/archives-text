## Disputed documents delay Irwin hearing 
### September Trevi√±o Staff writer 
Prosecution and defense teams
in the "Gay Liberation" statue
vandalism case argued heatedly
Friday over the delivery of certain
museum documents subpoenaed
by the defense, leading the judge
to set a separate hearing to settle
this dispute.
The conflict arose during the
preliminary hearing of senior
Thomas Irwin, one of she students
accused of defacing the statue last
spring. Irwin has pleaded not guilty
to charges of felony vandalism.
John Hackmann, Irwin's attor
ney, was concerned that he re
ceived only some of the docu
ments he subpoenaed last Thurs
day from the Stanford Art Muse
um, while other documents were
withheld by the prosecution.
The documents detail the dam
ages to the statue both before and
after the vandalism. Hackmann
