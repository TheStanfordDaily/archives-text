## Freshmen spikers help sweep Sun Devils, Wildcats 
### Seth Goldstein Staff writer 
The heat is brutal in the desert
during the day. But as soon as the
sun goes down, it cools off in a
hurry.
This pattern holds just as well to
women's volleyball as it does in
nature. All of the fire shown by the
No. 16 Arizona (9-5, 5-4) and No.
14 Arizona State (10-6, 5-4) squads
early in their matches with top
ranked Stanford (15-0, 9-0) went
for naught as the Cardinal placed
the freeze on the Valley of the Sun.
Stanford prevailed 3-0 (16-14,15-8,
15-4) over the Wildcats on Friday
evening and completed another
sweep (15-12, 15-10, 15-5) over the
Sun Devils on Saturday.
The decisive victories allowed
the Cardinal to rid itself of the
memory of 1993's trip to the Grand
Canyon state. Arizona State swept
Stanford the last time the teams
met and a demoralized Cardinal
met defeat against Arizona the
very next night to complete a week
end which Stanford head coach
Don Shaw called "embarrassing."
"We all wanted revenge on the
Sun Devils," said sophomore block
er Eileen Murfee. "To get them
back and make them pay."
"We had made a pact not to talk
about it," said sophomore setter
and defensive specialist Catherine
Juillard. "It was a real sore spot for
us."
The Cardinal started soothing
that sore spot in Phoenix, where
Arizona head coach David Rubio
had told local papers that he
expected victory if his 'Cats played
well.
The Wildcats did come out of the
chute fast in game one, taking a 7-
3 lead. Or at least they came out
faster than the Cardinal did. Nei
ther team really took control of
matters in what soon became a
back-and forth, grind-it-out affair.
Stanford eventually got into a
groove and overtook the Wildcats
11-9.
"We came out flat because we
wanted to beat them so badly,"
Juillard said. "But we calmed down

and settled in."
The Wildcats, bolstered by the
emotional play of sophomore left
side hitter Barb Bell and senior
blocker Charita Johnson, fought
back to deadlock the score at 14.
However, despite some missed
opportunities, the Cardinal tri
umphed 16-14, taking the game on
a Johnson hitting error.
With that opening loss, Arizona
seemed to lose some of its ferocity.
The Wildcats fell behind 8-3, and
although they closed the gap to 10-
8 at one point, Stanford knocked
out the next five points to win

game two. Junior outside hitter
Wendy Hromadka, substituting for
freshman Kristen Folkl, had a
large hand in the victory.
"Kristen had struggled in the
first game," Shaw said. "And
Wendy had been playing well in
practice and in previous games.
This gave me a chance to give her
some time and she came through."
In the third game, the Cardinal
wasted no time in running out to a
10-0 head start. Arizona managed
to stall Stanford's spikers at that

point and get on the scoreboard,
but the effort was more reminis
cent of an animal in its death
throes than a team with a serious
shot at victory.
Shaw pointed to his team's
bench depth, a source of strength all
season, as a key to the victory. When
a match runs long, as this one did,
the Cardinal's advantage grows,
according to Shaw. Other teams
cannot put away tired or struggling
players as well as Stanford.
"There were lots of rotations in
the Arizona match," he said. "And
some key substitutions. Arizona
used up its subs and got caught
with a few players they might not
normally have out there."
The next evening, amidst a
howling Sun Devil crowd intent
upon reminding Stanford of last
year's loss, the Cardinal struggled
early on and ASU took a 7-1 lead.
Neither the crowd nor the deficit
fazed the resilient Stanford squad
as the spikers caught the Devils at
9 and triumphed 15-12. Paradoxi
cally, ASU registered a hitting per
centage over a hundred points
higher than Stanford's in the
game, but still lost.
"We were a little rusty on
offense. There were lots of
unforced hitting errors," Murfee
said. "But the defense was great
— on both sides."
Despite the hitches in its early
steps that night, the team
remained focused.
"We realize when we make mis
takes, but we don't count them,"
she continued. "You just move on
and hit the next ball in."
The second game was another
battle. ASU's Christine Garner
and her powerful jump serve gave
the Devils a 3-0 lead. After a series
of ties, ASU led 10-8 and Shaw
took a time-out. The squad
regrouped and went on a 7-0 run
to win game two. Game three was
similar to its counterpart from the
previous night, with the Cardinal
winning easily.
Veteran leadership paved the
way for the hard-fought win over
the Sun Devils.
"I know the freshmen have been
getting a lot of attention," Shaw
said. "But in the Arizona match, it
was the older players — Anne
Wicks, Marnie Triefenbach, Cary
Wendell — that really did it for us.
The freshmen struggled a bit."
