Goliath may not have killed
Stanford, but the Cardinal final
ly has a dent in its armor.
The No. 3 Stanford women's
soccer team (10-1) lost for the
first time this season yesterday,
succumbing 1-0 to top-ranked
North Carolina (15-0-1) in a
defensive struggle in Houston.
The Cardinal had not lost in 52
weeks, dating back to last Oct.
17, in the same tournament and
to the same foe.
Stanford split its two contests
in the tournament by defeating
No. 5 Duke (11-2-1) 2-1 on Fri
day.
Yesterday's game proved
much more difficult for North
Carolina than most of the previ
ous 100 in its four-year unbeaten
streak. The eight-time defending
national champions had led the
nation in scoring with 71 goals in
15 games before play yesterday,
and had been held under two
goals only three times since 1991
(all this season).
Senior midfielder Danielle
Egan, named a second-team Ail-
American by Soccer News, posted
the only score of the rain-soaked
day at 50 minutes, 30 seconds.
Though Egan was the only Tar
Heel to find the back of the net,
her teammates certainly tried.
Three-time All-American Tisha
Venturini fired seven shots on
goal, and North Carolina's 22
attempts of the afternoon consti

tuted a season high for Cardinal
opponents.
Senior Jennifer Poehler, who
entered the game third in the
country in goalkeeping, made 10
saves, second in her career to the
11 shots she stopped against
Duke on Friday.
Stanford mustered a season
low five shots on goal and went
shut out for the first time since a
scoreless tie versus San Diego
State on Oct. 10, 1993.
Before his team fell from the
ranks of the unbeaten, Stanford
head coach lan Sawyers predict
ed that the run of perfection
would eventually come to an end.
"I don't think you can go

through a season without some
kind of blemish to your record,"
Sawyers said. "There's too much
parity now. Somewhere along the
line, we're not going to play well
and some team's going to take
advantage of us."
Stanford also struggled
against Duke as the defense bent
but refused to break in Friday's
match-up. The Blue Devils domi
nated on the stats sheet but
failed to convert 21 shots on goal
until the game's final minute.
For the first time in 1994,
Stanford made fewer shots on
goal than an opponent, with only
11. However, the Cardinal, which
has struggled at times to trans
late scoring opportunities into
goals, turned the tables on the
Blue Devils. Poehler's career
high 11 saves came only one shy
of her season total prior to the
game.
While Poehler kept Duke off

the score board, goalie Melissa
Carr could not prevent Stanford
from posting an early lead. Con
sensus All-American Jessica Fis
cher powered a direct free kick
past Carr from 25 yards away to
give Stanford an advantage only
10 minutes into the contest. The
junior sweeper, "one of the most
talented women players in the
world today" according to
Sawyers, now has three goals on
the season, all on free kicks or
penalty kicks.
The Cardinal clung to its per
ilous lead until the second half,
when junior midfielder Carmel
Murphy scored from 12 yards
away on sophomore forward

Emily Burt's second assist of
1994. Though Murphy has only
two goals this season (after nine
in 1993), both have been game
winners.
The insurance goal became
necessary only after Duke mid
fielder Cara Lyons ruined the
shutout just before the buzzer.
Freshman forward Andi Melde
notched her team-leading eighth
assist of the year. Lyons' fourth
goal of the season did not affect
the game's outcome, but it was
the first in 497 minutes, 57 sec
onds to get by Poehler, who was
seeking her seventh shutout of
the season.
The competition should cool
down a little as Stanford contin
ues its stretch of tournaments.
This weekend in Colorado, the
Cardinal will face host Colorado
College and Nebraska before
returning home to battle San
Francisco on Oct. 26.

advantage of us."
Stanford also struggled
against Duke as the defense bent
but refused to break in Friday's
match-up. The Blue Devils domi
nated on the stats sheet but
failed to convert 21 shots on goal
until the game's final minute.
For the first time in 1994,
Stanford made fewer shots on
goal than an opponent, with only
11. However, the Cardinal, which
has struggled at times to trans
late scoring opportunities into
goals, turned the tables on the
Blue Devils. Poehler's career
high 11 saves came only one shy
of her season total prior to the
game.
While Poehler kept Duke off

the score board, goalie Melissa
Carr could not prevent Stanford
from posting an early lead. Con
sensus All-American Jessica Fis
cher powered a direct free kick
past Carr from 25 yards away to
give Stanford an advantage only
10 minutes into the contest. The
junior sweeper, "one of the most
talented women players in the
world today" according to
Sawyers, now has three goals on
the season, all on free kicks or
penalty kicks.
The Cardinal clung to its per
ilous lead until the second half,
when junior midfielder Carmel
Murphy scored from 12 yards
away on sophomore forward

Emily Burt's second assist of
1994. Though Murphy has only
two goals this season (after nine
in 1993), both have been game
winners.
The insurance goal became
necessary only after Duke mid
fielder Cara Lyons ruined the
shutout just before the buzzer.
Freshman forward Andi Melde
notched her team-leading eighth
assist of the year. Lyons' fourth
goal of the season did not affect
the game's outcome, but it was
the first in 497 minutes, 57 sec
onds to get by Poehler, who was
seeking her seventh shutout of
the season.
The competition should cool
down a little as Stanford contin
ues its stretch of tournaments.
This weekend in Colorado, the
Cardinal will face host Colorado
College and Nebraska before
returning home to battle San
Francisco on Oct. 26.
