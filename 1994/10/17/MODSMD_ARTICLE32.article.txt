# Compromise Swimmers, alumni split

### Cindy Buchner Staff writer 
"If we can all remember how to
spell Leland, we are going to have
a great cheer," one alumnus
announced before the annual
alumni swim meet on Saturday.
Despite loud — and accurate —
cheering by both alumni and var
sity teams, the varsity women
and alumni men walked away
with the highest scores at the
meet.
It was a casual event in all
respects: the line-ups were made
through sign-ups the morning of
the races, the coaches did not
carry watches, the men wore their
big, red drag suits and the varsity
teams had been working out for
two hours prior to the meet.
The alumni were aided by loose
scoring procedures in which addi
tional heats of alumni were
scored, but secondary heats of
varsity swimmers did not count.
The varsity teams also had to fol
low applicable swimming rules,
from which the alumni were
exempt. Despite the rules in their
favor, the alumni used fins, illegal
turns and running jump starts to
catch up to the younger athletes.
The varsity women dominated
the returnees. The best the
women alumni placed was a sec
ond in the 200-yard medley relay,
anchored by Olympian Janel Jor
genson. Olympian Susan Rapp
came in a close third behind
NCAA butterfly finalist Becky
Crowe and Olympian Jenny
Thompson in the 50-yard fly.
The alumni men picked up
wins in three events. Ricky Gould

swam mostly underwater to take
the 50 backstroke. In the shortest
race of the meet, the 25 freestyle,
the alumni placed an impressive
first, second and third. They also
placed first in the 200 free relay
— aided by almost every type of
cheating possible.
Freshman Sabir Muhammad
swam a quick 50 butterfly to beat
1987 graduate and Olympian
Pablo Morales.
Current men's head coach Skip
Kenney named Tom Haynie the
honorary coach of the alumni due
to his prior experience as the
Stanford coach from 1946 to
1960. Kenney also welcomed the
graduates of 1984 who were
attending their 10th year
reunion. The '84 graduates were
special to Kenney because they
were members of the first class he
recruited as coach for Stanford.
The alumni spanned as far back
as 1954 graduate Bill Mclvor, who
has been a regular at the alumni
meet for many years. Other partic
ipating alums included the current
assistant coach for the men's team
and former Cardinal swimmer,
Ted Knapp, who swam in the 25
free and the 200 free relay.
While the event was geared
towards competition, all involved
used the time to catch up on each
others' lives. One alumnus raced
while she was five months preg
nant, and another wore orange
water wings during warm-up,
presumably borrowed from his
child.
"It's so much fun walking
around and chatting. Nobody
wants to talk about swimming too
much," Knapp said.
