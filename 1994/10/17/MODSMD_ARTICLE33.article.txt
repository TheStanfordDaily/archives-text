### Ratha Harntha Contributing writer 
After its 1-0 loss to California on Saturday at
Berkeley, the Stanford field hockey team 'e battle
looks a little steeper as it attempts to scale the hill
leading towards the NCAA Championships.
"We played a really good game," said head
coach Sheryl Johnson. "The defense played great,
but the offense didn't play as well as it normally
does."
Even with junior midfielder Elise Morgan out
of the game with a knee injury she suffered on
Oct. 7, the Cardinal had no trouble controlling the
ball in the inidfield. But when Stanford got with
in 25 yards of the goal, it stuggled to get shots.
Morgan claimed her absence was not a factor aa
she praised the play of her replacement, junior
Rachel Timbie.
"As a team, we didn't have multiple shots on
goal, which is what we needed," Johnson said.
"The midfield played awesome, but we didn't have
an attack I inside 25 yards]."
The Cardinal finished the match with only two
shots on goal. After gaining control at midfield,
the Cardinal repeatedly lost possession when it
tried to deliver the ball to the forwards. According
to senior midfielder Tina Syer, the pressure to
score made Stanford rush its passing and shots,
causing it to lose possession.
The only goal of the gamo came with approxi
mately twelve minutes left on a short corner.
After the ball was put in-bounds, it was stopped
and passed to Cal's Elsa Ackerman, who placed a
shot into the left corner of the net.
The loss drops Stanford to 2-3 in the Northern
Pacific Conference and 5-7 overall, while the
Bears move to 4-1 in the NorPac. In order to
make the playoffs, the Cardinal must defeat Uni
versity of the Pacific on Nov. 1 and the Bears
have to lose to the Tigers. Stanford would then
play California in the NorPac Championship
game to determine the winner of the conference.
Overall, the team was still pleased with its per
formance.
"We're coming,together as a team and every
one was happy with the way we played," Syer said.
"And that's a really good feeling."
