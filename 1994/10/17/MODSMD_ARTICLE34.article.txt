Stanford men's soccer is trying
to pull out of the gravitational field
of its pre-conference record and
streak towards post-season play.

This weekend, the Cardinal fired
its boosters with a 4-1 victory over
Oregon State and decelerated with
a 2-0 loss to the University of Wash
ington.
Friday's blowout of the Beavers
maintained Stanford's (3-9-2) win
ning momentum built up during its
last two games against Air Force
and Sacramento State.
Four different Cardinal players
scored in the game: freshman mid
fielder/forward Justin Leßlanc,
sophomore forward / midfielder
John Manchester, senior back
Ryan Estevez, and freshman mid
fielder Eric Vandevelde. It was
Manchester's first game of the sea

son.
"We created more opportunities
in this game and we finished them,"
said head coach Colin Lindores.
However, the Stanford players
claimed the outcome reflected the
results of erratic officiating.
Both teams ended up playing
short of players due to ejections —
by the end of the game, the Beavers
were only left with eight players to
face Stanford's 10.
"The ref tried to control the
game instead of just mediate it,"
said sophomore goalkeeper Ryan
Craig. "He gave out four red cards
in the space of five minutes. I felt
sorry for the Oregon guys."
Unfortunately, one of the red
card recipients was Vandevelde,
who in the last few games has
developed into a major offensive
weapon for the Cardinal. Vande
velde was rendered ineligible to
play in Sunday's game versus the
Huskies.
Stanford lost two other key
starters on Friday, but on a more
permanent scale.
Leßlanc suffered a severe, bone
deep cut, and junior forward Car
men D'Onofrio aggravated the tear
in the medial collateral ligament of
his left knee. Both are questionable
for upcoming Mountain Division
games.
Stanford's loss to the Huskies
came as a result of key mistakes and
a failure to assert its more indirect
passing style.
"We played pretty fast and didn't
settle down," said sophomore back
Duncan Hill. "In the last few games
we've been controlling the pace our
selves. We let [the HuskiesJ come at
us and just tried to kick the ball
away."
Sophomore back Brad Davies

asserted that the Cardinal's switch
away from its traditional strategy
was not wholly dictated by the
Huskies.
"We went to a more direct style
because we were down 2-0 in the
game," he said.
As a result of this transition, the
Huskies were able to put pressure
on the Cardinal in the backfield and
controlled the ball much of the
game.
The Cardinal did not respond
effectively and failed to capitalize on
the opportunities that it did create.
Also, the team has reached a
point where injuries have forced
many of its starters to the bench,
leaving Lindores with limited choic
es when deciding the starting line
up.
"This was just one those games
where even if we had been playing
for a week we couldn't score," Lin
dores said. "The game came down
to mistakes — their first goal
turned out to be critical."
Lindores conceded that the
Huskies were much more athletic
than the Beavers. However, the
result was due to Stanford's lack of
execution rather than particularly
inspired play on Washington's
part.
"Like the coach said, we gave
them this game," Davies said. "We
should have and could have beat
them."
The Cardinal's hopes of break
ing into the stratosphere of post
season play have been dampened
but not smothered.
"We still have a chance," Hill
said. "We just need a couple of lucky
things to happen and to keep on
playing well."
The Cardinal's engines are still
glowing.
