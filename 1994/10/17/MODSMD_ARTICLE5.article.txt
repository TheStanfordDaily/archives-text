## After 50 years, actor Palance gets degree 
### Solveig Pederson Staff writer 
Some Stanford students stop
out for a quarter or two. Academy
Award-winning actor Jack
Palance stopped out for almost
half a century.
The 73-year-old "graduated"
from Stanford Friday when he
gave a speech that fulfilled the one
remaining unit needed for his de
gree in speech and drama.
Palance — who won a Best Sup
porting Actor Oscar for his role as
Curly in "City Slickers"— attend
ed Stanford for five quarters, be
fore leaving for New York to start
his career on Broadway.
Palance spoke to Drama Depart
ment alumni in Little Theater, as
part of Homecoming activities. The
preparation for the talk, together
with his life experience, fulfilled re
quirements for Drama 190, "Indi
vidual Research."
"There was always a reason for
my not being able to get [my de
gree]," Palance said, after his talk.
"There were certain things I

took that I had to take, like biology,
which I loathed," he said. "I left
here needing to take another biolo
gy class. I didn't want to wait
around for another three months."
But as it happened, Palance
had satisfied University require
ments and did not need to take an
other biology course.
"We went back and researched
his transcript," said Drama Chair
Michael Ramsaur. "According to
the Registrar's Office, he met the
[University] requirements for
graduation, and we attested that
he could meet Drama require
ments, but there was a unit dis
crepancy with the Registrar's Of
fice, which said he had 179 units."
Palance transferred to Stan
ford in the spring of 1945 from the
University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill after serving in the Air
Force and qualifying for the GI
Bill, which provided college funds
to returning soldiers.

After leaving Stanford in 1949, Jack Palance earns his final units for
graduation this weekend.
Stanford's football team, Palance
appeared in nine plays.
"Every time I got in a play (at
Stanford!," Palance said in his
husky, roughened voice, "They
gave me a light or comedic role."
He remembers going to his
director at Stanford, F. Cowles
Strickland, and asking for a more
serious part.
"It won't work— you're going
to be a comedic actor the rest of
your life," Strickland replied.
"They're not going to cast you as
a dramatic actor because they're
going to laugh at you."
Ironically, Palance's first role
on Broadway was as a Russian
soldier in"The Big Two," — defi
nitely not a comedic role, and the
beginning of his long dramatic
career.
After appearing in a few plays
at Stanford, Palance changed his
major from journalism to speech
and drama. He had found his call
ing on the stage.
While reminiscing in the Little
Theater, where many of his pro
ductions were staged, Palance
gestured toward the theater's
glass doors.
"I remember sitting here one
day and some guy walked in that
door and he hit the door with his
face," Palance said. "I was sitting
here thinking — 'What a horse's
ass,' and it was Bob Hope!"
The eternally clowning Hope
was on campus in the fall of 1945
to broadcast one of his shows
from Memorial Auditorium.
Somewhat of a clown himself,
Palance is a personable character
in real life as well as on screen —
engaging and humorous.

His speech began with a story
about Marilyn Monroe, once a
lunch companion of his when he
was working in Hollywood. Ironi
cally, the experience was not an
ego booster, he remembers.
"I was the lucky one that day,"
Palance quipped. Monroe and
Jane Russell were filming "Gen
tlemen Prefer Blondes," and
Monroe was very scantily clad
when Palance arrived at the set.
"She didn't want to put any
thing else on," Palance said, "so
we walked the four or five blocks
to the restaurant" with Monroe
turning heads all the way.
The real ego crusher came
afterward, Palance said, when a
friend of his called him that
night, raving about having seen
Monroe walking down the street.
"Was there anyone with her?"
Palance asked.
"God, I think there was," his
friend answered, "but 1 can't
remember."
Stanford's newest graduate's
upcoming projects include a tele
vision miniseries called "Buffalo
Girls," about the Buffalo Bill cir
cus period, with Anjelica Huston
and Melanie Griffith. His other
project is a film called "Three
Against Tomorrow," a story of
three people trapped behind the
lines in Vietnam.
Palance has also been nomi
nated for Academy Awards for his
performances in the films
"Shane" and "Sudden Fear." In
addition, he hosted the television
series, "Ripley's Believe It or
Not."
In his free time, Palance paints
"bizarre landscapes" and writes
poetry and fiction, along with tak
ing care of his ranches in Califor
nia and Pennsylvania. He will
officially receive his Stanford
diploma in January.
