## After 50 years, actor Palance gets degree 
### Solveig Pederson Staff writer 
Some Stanford students stop
out for a quarter or two. Academy
Award-winning actor Jack
Palance stopped out for almost
half a century.
The 73-year-old "graduated"
from Stanford Friday when he
gave a speech that fulfilled the one
remaining unit needed for his de
gree in speech and drama.
Palance — who won a Best Sup
porting Actor Oscar for his role as
Curly in "City Slickers"— attend
ed Stanford for five quarters, be
fore leaving for New York to start
his career on Broadway.
Palance spoke to Drama Depart
ment alumni in Little Theater, as
part of Homecoming activities. The
preparation for the talk, together
with his life experience, fulfilled re
quirements for Drama 190, "Indi
vidual Research."
"There was always a reason for
my not being able to get [my de
gree]," Palance said, after his talk.
"There were certain things I

took that I had to take, like biology,
which I loathed," he said. "I left
here needing to take another biolo
gy class. I didn't want to wait
around for another three months."
But as it happened, Palance
had satisfied University require
ments and did not need to take an
other biology course.
"We went back and researched
his transcript," said Drama Chair
Michael Ramsaur. "According to
the Registrar's Office, he met the
[University] requirements for
graduation, and we attested that
he could meet Drama require
ments, but there was a unit dis
crepancy with the Registrar's Of
fice, which said he had 179 units."
Palance transferred to Stan
ford in the spring of 1945 from the
University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill after serving in the Air
Force and qualifying for the GI
Bill, which provided college funds
to returning soldiers.
In addition to writing for The
Daily and playing fullback for

After leaving Stanford in 1949, Jack Palance earns his final units for
graduation this weekend.
