# Breyer, at reunion, discusses judiciary
## 
### Brian Singer 
In yesterday's keynote speech
of the 1994 Homecoming Reunion
Weekend, newly appointed
Supreme Court Justice Stephen
Breyer stressed the importance of
an independent judiciary system
in America.
"The inside story on how theju
diciary works is that there is no in
side story," said Breyer, who grad
uated from Stanford in 1959.
"That's a good thing. The inde
pendence of the judges is in fact a
further guarantee that liberty will
in fact be applied."
In a speech he termed "infor
mal," Breyer told an audience of
about 500 at Frost Amphitheater
of his trip to Russia in 1992, when
the country's judicial system was
attempting to rid itself of party in
fluences.
He said it took Russian judges a
while to believe that American
judges could not be influenced by
political organizations.

"They would say, 'Suppose
someone really important called
you and told you what they
thought you should do,"' Breyer
recalled.
"I'd say, 'They wouldn't do
that.'"
The judges were not easily per
suaded by his claim, Breyer said,
but once he explained the Ameri
can belief in judicial neutrality,
they began to understand.
"The reason that judges are in
dependent is 200 years of history,
it's people's expectations, it's the
way we are brought up, it's what
we learn in high school and col
lege," he said. "And not just us, but
249 million other people. That's
what creates expectations which
turn words on paper into practice."
Breyer also described several
other events — such as his July
confirmation hearings — that in
fluenced his notion of American
democracy.
