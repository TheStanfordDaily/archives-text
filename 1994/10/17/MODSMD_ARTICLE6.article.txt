# Breyer, at reunion, discusses judiciary
## 
### Brian Singer 
In yesterday's keynote speech
of the 1994 Homecoming Reunion
Weekend, newly appointed
Supreme Court Justice Stephen
Breyer stressed the importance of
an independent judiciary system
in America.
"The inside story on how theju
diciary works is that there is no in
side story," said Breyer, who grad
uated from Stanford in 1959.
"That's a good thing. The inde
pendence of the judges is in fact a
further guarantee that liberty will
in fact be applied."
In a speech he termed "infor
mal," Breyer told an audience of
about 500 at Frost Amphitheater
of his trip to Russia in 1992, when
the country's judicial system was
attempting to rid itself of party in
fluences.
He said it took Russian judges a
while to believe that American
judges could not be influenced by
political organizations.

"They would say, 'Suppose
someone really important called
you and told you what they
thought you should do,"' Breyer
recalled.
"I'd say, 'They wouldn't do
that.'"
The judges were not easily per
suaded by his claim, Breyer said,
but once he explained the Ameri
can belief in judicial neutrality,
they began to understand.
"The reason that judges are in
dependent is 200 years of history,
it's people's expectations, it's the
way we are brought up, it's what
we learn in high school and col
lege," he said. "And not just us, but
249 million other people. That's
what creates expectations which
turn words on paper into practice."
Breyer also described several
other events — such as his July
confirmation hearings — that in
fluenced his notion of American
democracy.
The more than 22 hours of
Senate hearings, he said, were "a
moderately stressful experience."
He said the only advice — and
the best advice — he got from the
White House was threefold. First:
"You don't have to jump in right
away [with an answer). Stop.
Think about it. Nothing will hap
pen if you pause. They can't force
you to answer."
"Number two is answer the
question," Breyer said. "Look at
the person asking the question
and answer the question.
"Number three is don't get
interested in your own answer. Let
other people worry about that," he
said.
Breyer said he does not mind
that nine senators voted against
his confirmation. "It's good that
in a democracy there is a kind of
democratic check. We live in a
country where, ultimately, the
power flows from the 250 million
people who live here."
He also told the crowd he

believes the reason for America's
recent interest in the court sys
tem stems from its long history of
peaceful diversity.
"Despite differences of opinion
from potentially warring groups,
people have managed to live togeth
er in relative freedom and harmony
productively for a very long time,"
he said. "To do that, they've created
a lot of ground rules they call laws
and basic fundamental rules put in
the Constitution.
Breyer spent the weekend at
Stanford attending his first col
lege reunion since graduation.
Breyer, who was sworn in as
the nation's 108 th Supreme
Court Justice in August, has
served as chief counsel to the Sen
ate Judiciary Committee and as
chief judge of the Ist U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals. He is the fourth
Stanford graduate currently sit
ting on the high court.
Following Breyer's speech, 30
alumni from the class of 1944 for
mally received their diplomas from
University President Gerhard
Casper. Although all the men were
considered Stanford graduates,
they missed the original ceremony
to fight in World War 11.
