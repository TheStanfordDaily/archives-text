## Master key stolen, all Flo Mo rekeyed 
### Jennifer Rosen Staff writer 
The "master-master" key to
Florence Moore Hall, which opens
every possible locked door in the
complex, was discovered stolen
Thursday.
Police continue to patrol the
area with round-the-clock surveil
lance, even though the residence's
exit doors were rekeyed Friday
and the inside doors are being
rekeyed today.
Resident assistants have alert
ed students about possible dan
gers, ""d pr-jcautionary measures
have pro\ i effective so far, said
Alison Hart, a RAin Faisan. Flo
Mo RAs discussed safety strate
gies at an emergency RA meeting
held immediately after the key
was discovered stolen.
Hart said the key was stolen
from a custodial key ring. None of
the residents know who was re
sponsible, and the exact time of
the burglary remains unknown,
she added.
"It was stolen from an employ
ees lounge â€” somehow someone
entered and stole it," said Stan
ford Police Sgt. David Lee. "There
are no suspects or witnesses."

The burglary has been met
with varying reactions through
out the residences, said Faisan RA
Adam Fingerhut. Some joke about
the security loss while others are
seriously concerned.
"Some people are really wor
ried that their stuff might be
stolen or they might be in danger,
" said Alex Shin, another Faisan
RA. "It was an eye-opening experi
ence."
RAs have been spending the
last few days tracking down resi
dents and providing them with
new keys, she said.
"It's like playing telephone
tag," Shin said, adding that she
was inconvenienced by the bur
glary.
Lee said this is the first time he
can ever recall a master key being
stolen from a residence, although
he added the Law School's key had
once been taken.
Cardenal RA Tamara Jones
said many people did not even re
alize that a master key which
opened all locks existed.
"I am really disappointed. It's
such a pain. I have some nice stuff
in my room that I don't want to be
stolen, Jones said. "Its scary to
think that people could enter
your room any hour of the
evening."
Lee said, however, that no bur
glaries have been reported since
the key's disappearance.
Jones has encouraged resi
dents to look out for one another
and to report any suspicious per
sons they see wandering the
dorm. She also reminded them to

call 911 if they sense danger.
So far, students seem to have
been heeding the warnings well.
Some even became suspicious of
legitimate workers who came to
check the cable television box,
Jones said. "Although they were
really TV guys, it's good to be
cautious," she added.
"The residents more or less
recognize each other by face,"
Paloma RA Mary Kelsey said.
"No resident would question the
integrity of another resident.
People are a little more cautious,
but still keep their doors open
and gab in the halls."
