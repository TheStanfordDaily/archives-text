### Jennifer Rosen Staff writer 
The "master-master" key to
Florence Moore Hall, which opens
every possible locked door in the
complex, was discovered stolen
Thursday.
Police continue to patrol the
area with round-the-clock surveil
lance, even though the residence's
exit doors were rekeyed Friday
and the inside doors are being
rekeyed today.
Resident assistants have alert
ed students about possible dan
gers, ""d pr-jcautionary measures
have pro\ i effective so far, said
Alison Hart, a RAin Faisan. Flo

the security loss while others are
seriously concerned.
"Some people are really wor

RA. "It was an eye-opening experi

RAs have been spending the
last few days tracking down resi
dents and providing them with
new keys, she said.
"It's like playing telephone
tag," Shin said, adding that she
was inconvenienced by the bur
glary.
Lee said this is the first time he
can ever recall a master key being
stolen from a residence, although
he added the Law School's key had
once been taken.
Cardenal RA Tamara Jones
said many people did not even re
alize that a master key which
opened all locks existed.
"I am really disappointed. It's
such a pain. I have some nice stuff
in my room that I don't want to be
