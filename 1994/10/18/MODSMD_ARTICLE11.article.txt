# Record return rates
## Bookstore rebates top $500K 
### Ben Sussman 
In the largest rebate in its his
tory, the Stanford Bookstore is
returning more than $570,000
to its customers this week.
For the third year in a row,
the Bookstore rebated 15 per
cent of the purchase price of
textbooks, course readers and
commercial books, said Book
store Director of Operations
Ken Shark.
The rate was determined
from the total value of eligible
receipts turned in between May
1, 1993 and June 30, 1994, and
the amount of money available
for rebate.
Unlike previous years, this
year's checks also cover pur
chases made with credit cards,
Shark added.
Students carrying Stanford
IDs can pick up checks in front
of the Bookstore from 8:30 a.m.
to 4:30 p.m. through the end of
the week. Unclaimed checks will
be mailed to their recipients.
Because it is a nonprofit orga
nization, the Bookstore must
rebate its profit to customers.

Shark said the $570,000 total
rebate is "essentially the Book
store surplus for the year."
This year's rebate substan
tially exceeds the $450,000
returned in each of the past
two years, and is nearly double
the $300,000 returned for the
1991-1992 school year.
The existence of surpluses
has led many students — who
claim that the price of course
materials could be easily low
ered if the rebate were elimi
nated — to question the Book
store's pricing policy.
Reducing book prices
"would be another way to dis
tribute the profit," Shark said.
He noted, however, that
such a policy would leave little
buffer for the Bookstore for
unexpected contingencies dur
ing the year.
Shark said textbook prices
are set by the publisher. "There
can be a misconception, particu
larly on the part of the students,
that the Bookstore is charging
too much for textbooks," he
added. "We don't make any
money from them."
