PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide
preached anew for reconciliation from
behind his bulletproof shield yesterday,
hours after a mob torched the family
home of Haiti's new army commander.
Fifteen buildings were set afire and one
man killed in the coastal town of Gonaives
after a false rumor spread Sunday night
that Maj. Gen. Jean-Claude Duperval had
led a coup attempt against Aristide.
After three years of army rule, Aris
tide faces a major challenge in persuad
ing his nation to put aside the desire for
vengeance.

At the same time, concern for Aris
tide's security has practically made him
a prisoner of the National Palace, where
his appearances have been from behind
a bulletproof shield on the palace steps.
The mob attack in Gonaives, 100
miles north of Port-au-Prince, occurred
after Aristide summoned Duperval to the
National Palace on Sunday to discuss
how to dismantle the military, including
cutting the army roster by 80 percent.
U.S. troops guarding the palace unload
ed Duperval's normal sidearms, prompt
ing unfounded rumors to spread that the
army chief had tried to topple Aristide.

At least 10 houses and five stores
were burned in the city of Gonaives,
including one belonging to Duperval's
mother and another belonging to the
grandmother of former junta leader Lt.
Col. Michel Francois. A grain depot
owned by the Brandts, one of Haiti's
richest families, was looted.
Radio Signal FM said U.S. and
Haitian soldiers arrested 109 people in
putting down the violence in Gonaives.
In a brief speech yesterday at the
National Palace, Aristide urged "creat
ing a state of law like all modern soci
eties."
