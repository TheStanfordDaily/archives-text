# Jordan, Israel draft treaty
## Move puts pressure on Syria to end long-running conflict 
### 
AMMAN, Jordan (AP) — Jordan and Israel ini
tialed a draft treaty yesterday to end nearly a half
century of hostility, intensifying pressure on Syria
to move toward ending one of the world's longest
running conflicts.
The accord, reached after an all-night session
that resolved disputes over water rights and bor
ders, was expected to be quickly ratified by the Jor
danian and Israeli legislatures. The Israeli Cabinet
approved it within hours after it was signed.
After yesterday's ceremony, Israeli President
Ezer Weizman said Syrian President Hafez Assad
"should look around and see. ... He may be the last
in line" to make peace with Israel.
But in Damascus, where government-run news
papers have said daily that Israel was not to be trust
ed, Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa said:
"We hope the Israeli government will realize the fact
that without achieving peace with Syria and
Lebanon, there will be no peace in the region. .. .
This is the reality."
King Hussein of Jordan, who maintained clan
destine contacts with Israeli leaders for years
despite the state of war between the two countries,
insisted the treaty heralded a new era. "Hopefully, it
is a fresh beginning and a fresh start," he said.
And Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel
called it a "historically unique moment," and said he
hoped a Cull-fledged treaty would be signed by the
end of next week.
Israel TV said the full accord would be signed Oct.
27 on the Jordan-Israel border and that President
Clinton had been invited to take part. Clinton admin
stration officials said Clinton would probably attend.

Israel and Jordan signed a non-belligerency pact
in Washington on July 25, and since then had been
working to resolve differences that stood in the way
of a full-fledged peace treaty.
"I believe this peace is an important achieve
ment," a weary Rabin told reporters in Jerusalem
after returning from yesterday's ceremony and the
overnight meetings in Jordan. "I think it will also
have repercussions where Syria and the Palestinians
are concerned."
Peace talks with Syria have lagged over Damas
cus' demand that Israel relinquish the Golan
Heights captured in the 1967 Middle East war. Polls
show most Israelis oppose giving up the Golan.
Yesterday's accord, signed by Rabin and Prime
Minister Abdul Salam Majali of Jordan, came after a
rocky week for peace talks with the Palestinians.
Israel suspended negotiations with the PLO after
Islamic militants kidnapped an Israeli soldier. The
soldier was killed by his captors Friday as Israeli
commandos stormed their hideout, but talks are to
resume Today in Cairo.
Clinton said he was "delighted" by the develop
ments in Amman, adding: "This agreement reminds
us that moderation and reason are prevailing."
Jordan is only the second Arab country to make
peace with Israel. Egypt broke ranks to do so in
1979.
Jordan and Israel last fought in the 1967 Middle
East war, when Israel seized the West Bank and east
Jerusalem, but a state of war has existed between
the countries since 1948.
Syria fought Israel in 1948, as well as in 1967,
1973 and during Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon.
