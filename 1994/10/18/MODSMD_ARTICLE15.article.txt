U.N. convoy seized
SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina
(AP) â€” Bosnian Serbs yesterday com
mandeered a U.N. convoy carrying med
ical supplies to Sarajevo, forced it to a
Serb hospital and unloaded its supplies,
a U.N. relief spokesman said.
Kris Janowski, spokesman for the
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees,
said it was the first time in the 30-month
siege of Sarajevo that an entire convoy
had been hijacked and looted.
The hijacking appeared to reflect a grow
ing need by the Bosnian Serbs for basic

goods after Yugoslavia closed its border to
most supplies 10 weeks ago to underline its
desire for peace in Bosnia.
USDA cuts food supplies
WASHINGTON (AP) - Food
pantries across the country say they will
have to turn away hungry Americans
this winter as the federal government
cuts its contributions to their shelves.
The Agriculture Department, in a
money-saving move proposed by the
Clinton administration, will spend $25
million this fiscal year to supply food
banks and other programs for the poor.
