Students should still be
included in deliberations
about science core, DRs

IF A MAJOR company were
planning to drastically change
one of its products, it would
probably consult its consumers at
some point.
The company would likely seek a
broad range of consumer opinions
to find out what people like, what
they hate, what they would tolerate
and why — in order to come up
with the best product possible for
both the company and its con
sumers.
In a university, things don't
always work this way. And with
good reason. Otherwise, the main
consign ors — students — would all
get straight, A's and great room
assignments, and they wouldn't
have to take classes in subjects they
didn't like.
Still, a university must pay some
attention to student concerns,
especially when the situation
involves a drastic overhaul of a
major focus of student life — class
es.
Specifically, as Stanford plans
to revamp its system of distribu
tion requirements, it should con
tinue including student input to
come up with the best possible
courses.
One of the major changes pro
posed by the Commission on
Undergraduate Education is the
creation of a new coro sequence to
replace the current math, science
and technology DRs.
This proposed three-quarter
sequence, tentatively called "Intro
duction to the Natural Sciences,
Quantitative Analysis and Technol
ogy" would incorporate problem
solving, experimental work and
computer literacy training.
While trying to bring more order
to the current set of remotely sci
ence-related DRs is an admirable

goal, the faculty's desire to do this
without student involvement is a
bad start.
Unfortunately, many professors
at last week's Faculty Senate meet
ing expressed just this desire.
Provost Condeleezza Rice, for
instance, said she has reservations
about student membership on com
mittees since faculty members will
actually design and teach the
courses.
However, faculty members
should remember that, when it
comes to judging classes, students
are often the experts.
Though students certainly can
not devise a brand new curriculum
as seasoned professors can, they
can and should be able to help steer
the planning process in the right
direction.
This input is especially impor
tant when approaching such an
ambitious attempt as the one at
hand. Combining several disci
plines into one coherent core is a
difficult task, and the process
would only be helped by student
input.
The inclusion of a few well
informed students on the commit
tee, for example, would ensure that
the newly created classes adequate
ly meet students' needs. In addi
tion, a student-included group
could help foresee and avoid future
problems with the new classes,
based on past, firsthand experi
ence.
As the University begins ventur
ing into new academic territory
with the Commission on Under
graduate Education's hefty report,
it should be careful not to leave its
main resource behind.
The report's findings and its
impacts on students are too great
for the University not to include
them during the implementation
stage — this goes for the revamp
ing of the science requirements as
well as other proposed changes.
Because for all the planning and
deliberating faculty can do, the
ultimate success of the changes will
still depend on the students.
