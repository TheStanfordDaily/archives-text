## Study lists are always due 
### 
AS A MEDICAL student, my study
list is made ridiculously simple.
Along with the other 85 first-year
students, I take anatomy, embryology,
histology and a few other classes
inevitably ending with "y." The average
time pondering the few choices which
exist amounts to an estimated 30 sec
onds. In medicine, there are certain
things that one must know, and the cur
riculum reflects that. I consider this to be
reasonable and appropriate.
As a freshman advisor, I see the oppo
site extreme. Flexibility is much greater,
and I confer with students agonizing over
how many units to take, looking for that
perfect formula for a dynamic quarter.
They want to know exactly what their
exam schedule will be and how that fits in
with their plane flight home. I was a
Stanford freshman once myself, and I did
the same thing. This too is perfectly
acceptable and appropriate.
What bothers me is what happens
after those lists are turned in. Most of us,
undergraduates and graduates alike, go
to our appointment books — we block off
class time, exam time, this time and that
time and suddenly we can say where
we're going to be in six weeks at 2:15 in
the afternoon. Of course, changes take
place and some of us do switch classes
midway through the quarter (although
that may not be possible if we're under
grads intent on graduating in three
years, a topic unto itself).

But the general pattern is to reflect
little on the itinerary that we have self
designed. We wake up in the morning
and know what we need to do for most of
the day. We forget that the page in our
calendar was formed weeks earlier,
before we knew about the infinite inde
scribable changes that would take place
in ourselves and our perceptions of the
world. We don't take time to ponder
whether what we had planned weeks
before is still the most productive outline
for our growth as human beings.
This mentality manifested itself
recently as I looked for company to go
hear Vaclev Havel, the President of the
Czech Republic, speak in Frost Amphithe
ater. The near-unanimous response from
my classmates was, "But we have class at
that time." As if I didn't know. Complete
ly innocently, they made me feel uncom
fortable for missing a part of that day's
class. As it turned out, the speech was
very stimulating, and the class apparently
was not. But I regret that I needed that
result to confirm the value of what I had
done. I regret that I wasn't confident in
my decision througl out. Why does adjust
ment of one's pre-arranged schedule seem
such an anomaly? (If th.s doesn't seem an
anomaly for you, congratulations —
you're in the minority).
When I returned for the rest of class, I
was feeling good. The speech had given
me much-needed perspective; it was liter
ally and figuratively a breath of fresh air.

I was contemplative and appreciative of
the new channels of thought the event
had inspired. I reflected on how my study
of anatomy enhances my appreciation of
the sculptures in the Rodin Garden, adja
cent to our anatomy labs. Then someone
remarked, "When I go to look at art, 1
don't even want to think about anato
my." Ouch.
How have we become so compartmen
talized? Why is there so often a dichoto
my between academics and our private
lives? We are paying the Unive sity a lot
of money to be educated. But your tuition
comes with no guarantees. There is no
correlation between the organization of
our appointment books and the degree to
which our knowledge becomes meaning
ful. Meaningful knowledge is enhanced
by spontaneity and interrelations, build
ing connections which cannot be pre
determined.
When I give my advisees their study
list approval codes, I do so with fear. All I
want to approve is their ability to reflect
as often as possible on what they are
studying and how it affects their daily
lives. Every day is unique, and the oppor
tunities within can never be predicted in
advance. Our study lists are always due.

Chris Carlsten didn't even tell his
advisees about the pass/no credit dead
line last Sunday.
