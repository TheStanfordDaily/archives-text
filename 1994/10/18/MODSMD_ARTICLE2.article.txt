# Hoover may trim 10 percent of budget
## 
### Megan Himan Staff writer 
In yet another example of campus
cost-cutting, the Hoover Institution will
slice between seven and 10 percent of its
operating budget in the next two years.
These cuts are simply an "accelera
tion of budget cuts that are already on
the calendar," said John Raisian, direc
tor of the institution.
The cutbacks — intended to reduce
the institution's dependence on its en
dowment — were originally forecast to
be completed by the 1996-97 fiscal year,
Raisian said. The new timetable moves

the process up a full
year, he added.
Raisian said he did
not know whether the
measures would involve
cutting the number of
Hoover fellows or elimi
nating other programs,
although he added, "the
cuts that are anticipated
may involve some more

fundamental programmatic decisions."
Specific cuts will be announced at the
beginning of next year, when decisions
are finalized, Raisian said. "We are as
sessing all of the various options that we

have, and decisions will be made in Jan
uary or February," he added.
The institution currently has an oper
ating budget of $18 million, of which $4
million comes from the University for
the Hoover Library and Archives. The
remainder comes from the investment
income of the institution's original $140
million endowment from Herbert
Hoover, and from individual and corpo
rate donations.
Raisian said he does not expect any
change in the level of Stanford's funding
to Hoover.

Although Raisian said he has
conducted meetings with some
Hoover fellows about the nature
and size of the cuts to be taken
this year, many members of the
institution said they did not know
the extent of the planned cuts.

"I haven't even heard about any
big cutbacks," said Senior Hoover
Fellow Dr. Mel Krauss. But he
added that Hoover fellows and
administrators have discussed that
"we're going to have to balance our
budget, like everyone else."
Eligible Hoover fellows have
been given possible retirement
options as a budget-cutting mea
sure, said Senior Hoover Fellow
Dr. Ramon Mvers.

Raisian said the process of
reducing the budget has been
ongoing for four years, adding that
when he took over as director in
1990, the budget was $17 million.
"Due to the normal cost of liv
ing growth the budget would have
grown to $20-21 million [in 1994)
holding the real size of Hoover con
stant," Raisian said. Instead the
budget is currently between $17
and $18 million this year, he said.

The institution has sought
other means of funding to limit
the extent of the budget cuts. The
number of donors to Hoover has
increased significantly, as has the
dollar amount of some gifts from
individuals, corporations and
foundations, Raisian said.
Myers said the budget measures
are very "unsettling" but added,
"we will try to do the best that we
can" in the midst of cutbacks.
