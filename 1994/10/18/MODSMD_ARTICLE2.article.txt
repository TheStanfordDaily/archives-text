# Hoover may trim 10 percent of budget

In yet another example of campus
cost-cutting, the Hoover Institution will
slice between seven and 10 percent of its
operating budget in the next two years.
These cuts are simply an "accelera
tion of budget cuts that are already on
the calendar," said John Raisian, direc
tor of the institution.
The cutbacks — intended to reduce
the institution's dependence on its en
dowment — were originally forecast to
be completed by the 1996-97 fiscal year,
Raisian said. The new timetable moves

the process up a full
year, he added.
Raisian said he did
not know whether the
measures would involve
cutting the number of
Hoover fellows or elimi
nating other programs,
although he added, "the
cuts that are anticipated
may involve some more

fundamental programmatic decisions."
Specific cuts will be announced at the
beginning of next year, when decisions
are finalized, Raisian said. "We are as
sessing all of the various options that we

have, and decisions will be made in Jan
uary or February," he added.
The institution currently has an oper
ating budget of $18 million, of which $4
million comes from the University for
the Hoover Library and Archives. The
remainder comes from the investment
income of the institution's original $140
million endowment from Herbert
Hoover, and from individual and corpo
rate donations.
Raisian said he does not expect any
change in the level of Stanford's funding
to Hoover.
