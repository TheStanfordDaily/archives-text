High-powered motorcycles: too high a price for freedom

I PICKED UP a news story the other
day about a motorcycle accident. A
young man flew over his motorcycle
after striking the rear end of a car, and
landed on his stomach. He was sitting
up and talking at the scene shortly
after the accident, but died in the hos
pital the next morning from a ruptured
spleen.
This story is painfully familiar. Too
many of us have our own painful memo
ries — images and excruciating pains
that are carved in our hearts forever.
My younger brother was a motorcycle
enthusiast. He loved the freedom and
the acceleration. He drove a unique bike
called the Hurricane, a sleek-looking
machine that hugs the road. The Hurri
cane is a rocket bike with a l,ooocc
engine, 130 horse power, a top speed of
160 mph, and the power to race up to a
fourth of a mile in 10 and a half sec
onds.
My brother enjoyed riding with his
buddies. The night after his biggest real
estate transaction, he went riding with
two friends on the Hurricane. He was
racing straight down the road at about
60 miles per hour when the accident
occurred. Roy had the right of way, but
the driver of the car coming toward him
cut him off with a left turn. The driver
had his blinker on but miscalculated
the time he would have to make the
turn. He thought he could beat the
bike.
Roy had a second to react; he saw one
window, accelerated, but it was too late.
He hit the car, catching the motorcycle
handle on the front windshield of the
car, flew into the air some 68 feet, and
crashed into the pavement. His shoes
went flying as he was propelled through
the air. His helmet stayed on.
If anyone could have escaped from
this accident, found a tiny window to
slide through, it was Roy. But in this
case, he had no window and he was
thrown into the path of another car.

There was absolutely no opportunity to
cheat death. The driver of the other car
didn't even know what had happened;
he was simply in the wrong place at the
wrong time.
The entire accident, from the
moment Roy hit the first car to the
moment the other car dragged his body
back to the point of impact, took
approximately three seconds. The coro
ner said that death was instantaneous;
that was the only consolation for any of
us. Roy's motorcycle buddies weren't
sure that Roy was dead, but they left
him behind nonetheless. He was 28
years old.
My brother's story is not unique.
"The Eye of the Hurricane" by David
Wilcox is a moving, melodic ballad
about the death of a woman who used
to ride a rocket bike. The song tells a
story like my brother's: "We saw her
ride so fast last night, racing by, a flash
of light. Riding quick, the street was
dark. The shiny truck she thought was
parked. It blocked her path, stopped
her heart, not the Hurricane. She saw
her chance to slip the trap but then it
moved, closed the gap. She never felt
the pain."
Stories appear every day about young
people being hurt, disfigured, paralyzed
and killed in motorcycle accidents. Dur
ing the last decade, over 3 million motor
cycle accidents occurred and approxi
mately 40,000 motorcyclists were killed.
This is one reason why emergency room
physicians often refer to motorcyclists as
prospective heart donors.
Rocket bikes in particular are
designed for speeds that far exceed the
capabilities of most riders and most
drivers of other vehicles. They simply
race too fast for an ordinary road. Fur
ther, they entice their young riders into
even greater speeds by offering racing
power beyond the needs of any traffic
situation.
As part of the Easy Rider, Arlo

Guthrie motor "side" generation, I
embraced the freedom and indepen
dence associated with this American
phenomenon. I still bridle under exter
nal, governmental infringements on my
Constitutional rights and personal liber
ties. However, I do believe, as Amatai
Etzioni eloquently stated, that some
limitations to our freedoms are neces
sary and reasonable in a complex demo
cratic society.
And as a student of history, I recog
nize too that infringements that are
difficult for us to accept may seem triv
ial to future generations. Historians
may look back at this period in disbe
lief that people would argue for the
right to propel themselves into space at
extraordinary speeds without any pro
tective barrier between them and the
pavement — not to mention the eco
nomic burden of medical costs, rehabil
itation, and perhaps lifetime disability
benefits for those fortunate enough to
survive such an impact. According to
the Hurt report on motorcyle accident
cause factors, "less than 10 percent of
the motorcycle riders involved in (the
accidents studied) had insurance of any
kind."
Clearly traffic laws are no deterrent
to motorcycle racing. Helmet laws are
necessary and admirable, but they
aren't enough; my brother was wearing
a helmet. Education is critical. The
overwhelming majority of motorcyle rid
ers "are essentially without training."
The Motorcyle Safety Foundation pro
vides lifesaving motorcyle rider training
programs. Since "students comprise
most of the accident-involved motorcy
cle riders," we as educators (both stu
dents and faculty) also have a special
responsibility to expose the student
body to such educational resources as
the foundation and to the full range of
issues associated with this choice. This
can be accomplished within existing res
idential education programs.

In addition, since "injury severity
increases with speed, alcohol involve
ment and motorcycle size," we need to
address these issues as well. In particu
lar, one way to reduce the number of
fatalities is to reduce the speed at which
accidents happen. We regulate many
vehicles for safety; I think it is time to
consider regulating the power of these
rocket bikes.
On an ordinary road, with an ordinary
rider, the rocket bike if a vehicular
assault weapon. And as with automatic
and semiautomatic assault rifles, we
need first to talk about solutions and
then to act, educate, mandate and legis
late to reduce the danger to riders and
others who are swept away in the eye of
the Hurricane.
