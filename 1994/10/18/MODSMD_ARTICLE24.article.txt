## Never again Spikers vow not to overlook lowly Bears

Ever dance with the devil in the pale moonlight?
Tonight, the rival California Golden Bears will be
forced to tango with a Cardinal red demon when the
No. 1 Stanford women's volleyball team pays a visit
to Berkeley. The Cardinal squad, first in the Pacific
10 Conference, brings a perfect 15-0 record to this
evening's match.
On the other side of the court, California's 3-13
record falls on the less successful side of the spec
trum. The 1994 campaign has been difficult for the
Bears.
"It's tough playing in the Pac-10 without a true
impact player," said California head coach Dave
DeGroot. "We don't have a Kristen Folkl or an
Annett Buckner. We have to play a more balanced
game."
"We keep trying to go out and play smart volley
ball," he continued. "It's tough to do that consis
tently with such a young group. We've taken a lick
ing the last couple of weekends. That's why it's a
good time to play Stanford."
Wait a minute. It's a good time to play the
nation's top-ranked team when you've been strug
gling? DeGroot has an explanation for those who
may think he has taken a leave of his senses.
"We haven't been playing well," he said. "So let's
just go for it. We have nothing to lose."
Cal also has a reason to believe it has something
to gain. When the Bears came to Maples Pavilion a
few short weeks ago, they gave a heavily favored
Stanford squad some unanticipated trouble. In fact,
California forced the Cardinal into a fourth game —
an achievement matched only by top-10 teams
IJCI.A and Florida.
"We played competitively against IStanford]
before," DeGroot said. "That gives us a little confi
dence coming into Tuesday's match."
The Bears used their relatively successful perfor
mance against the Cardinal as a springboard for
their next few matches. When California traveled to
Oregon the following Friday, it picked up its lone
Pac-10 victory. In addition, the Bears gave Oregon
State, UCIJ\. and USC something to think about
before succumbing in the end.
Stanford will attempt to deny the Berkeley spik
ers such a momentum builder this time around. The
Cardinal players want to return home to the Farm
as soon as they can.
"We're out to take care of Cal as quickly as possi
ble," freshman middle blocker Barbara Ifejika said.

Freshman outside hitter Lisa Sharpley rises to the occasion against USC two week
ends ago. Sharpley and the rest of the women's volleyball team heads north tonight to
take on the Golden Bears. " .
"Last time, we lost a game to
them and that shouldn't have
happened. We'll definitely take
them more seriously this time."
Meanwhile, this past week
end's victories over Arizona and
Arizona State marked the
halfway point in Stanford's Pac
-10 schedule. Nine matches, nine
wins.
"We're all happy and looking
forward to the rest of the season
and Ilegionals and Austin (the
site of this year's National Cham
pionships) and all the rest of it,"
sophomore blocker Eileen Murfee
said.
Nonetheless, the Cardinal
women are not ready to lower the

amount of pressure they place
upon themselves.
One area Stanford wants to
focus on tonight is its offense.
The team leads the conference in
hitting percentage, but recently
the squad has seen production fall
off a little. Against the Sun Dev
ils, the Cardinal hit a season low
.163, well below its average.
"We were a little rusty on
offense early on," Stanford head
coach Don Shaw said. "And it
wasn't good blocking on [the Sun
Devils'l part. We had a lot of
unforced hitting errors."
Ifejika hopes that the Cardinal
improves, plain and simple.
"In terms of winning, we're
achieving our goals," she said.
"But we're by no means compla
cent. We still want to keep
improving our play. Every match
is an opportunity to do that."
