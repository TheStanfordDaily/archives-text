# Male runners outshine all at Michigan
## 
### Todd Bernstein Staff writer 
The Stanford men's cross country team stole
the spotlight from the women this past weekend
as it sprinted to first place in the Michigan Invi
tational.
Coming ofT an impressive second-place finish
two weeks ago at the Stanford Invitational, the
men outran fifth-ranked Tennessee, ninth
ranked Arizona, and llth-ranked Michigan.
The men's team has finished stronger with
every meet, due in large part to the maturation of
the team.
"The men ran intelligently; they executed the
plan they were supposed to, and ran well," said
coach Vin Lananna.
The plan Lananna refers to is simple. The
men must run conservatively at the beginning
and move through the pack as the race pro
gresses.
Sophomore Greg Jimmerson, leading the
men in red and white, finished fourth overall
with a time of 25 minutes. Sophomore J.J.
White and freshman Matthew Farley crossed
the line next for the Cardinal, coming in 11th
and 16th respectively.
"It's a definite confidence booster for us going
into the championship part of the season," said
sophomore Brian Zmijewski, who placed 21st
overall at Michigan.
The victory not only provided the team with
a morale boost, but it holds great significance for
the post season.
Only 22 teams qualify for the NCAA National
Championships. Of those, 16 qualify by finishing
first or second at their respective district champi
onships Nov. 12. The other six teams are select
ed through a wild-card system based on the
team's district finish as well as its regular season
record.
"Beating so many teams from other districts
this weekend takes the pressure off later in the
season," Lananna said.
In addition, the players know the team is com
ing together. "It's going to be exciting because
we've got everyone involved — we're bonding
really well now," Zmijewski said.
As for the Cardinal women, eighth-ranked
Stanford finished behind sixth-ranked Michigan,
but finished ahead of rivals Arizona and Wash
ington.
While some may think finishing second might
be a disappointment for the team, Lananna
believes otherwise.
"The women needed out-of-district competi
tion in order to see what they needed to work
on," he said. "We accomplished that. We now
know we need to work on packing our group
up."
Freshman Kortney Dunscombe continued
her success by finishing third overall with a time
of 17:37. Freshman Sarna Renfro and sopho
more Leila Burr followed Dunscombe, capturing
seventh and 16th place, respectively.
"I think we were focusing on the meets
ahead," Dunscombe said. "The Michigan meet
made us realize that we need to work together as
a team and run more as a pack."
