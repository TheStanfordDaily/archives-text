# Tough but good
## Men's tennis returns from U. Texas with optimism 
### Courtney Mann 
The Stanford men's tennis
squad returned from Texas and
its early season test this weekend
with impressive play under its
belt and a highly optimistic out
look on the upcoming year.
Despite attending only four
practices before participating in
the Indoor Tennis Association
Men's All-American Champi
onships held at the University of
Texas last week, assistant coach
John Whitlinger and the players
involved came away satisfied
with their performance in the
tournament as they sent one
Cardinal representative, junior
Jeff Salzenstein, to the semifi
nals of the championship singles
bracket.
"This is a tough tournament
regardless of how much practice
you've had," said Whitlinger. "It
was nice to get going and see
what we need to work on."
Salzenstein had received an
automatic bid to the champi
onship bracket, and he took full
advantage of vaunted status. In
the first round of the 32-man
tourney, he rolled over Steven
Baldas from the University of
Georgia 6-4, 6-3. He then won
two consecutive matches over
Gil Kovaleski from the Univer
sity of Miami and Damon
Henkel of the University of
Florida.
Against Kovaleski, Salzen
stein cruised early, taking the
first set 6-1. He then lost a close
second set 6-7 before advancing
with a 6-4 victory in the third
set. Salzenstein prevailed in sim
ilar fashion in the fourth round
as he defeated Henkel 6-4, 5-7, 6-
0.
Salzenstein was finally elimi
nated in the semifinals 6-1, 6-7,
6-1 at the hands of Chad Clark of
the Longhorns. Salzenstein's
finish displayed remarkable

improvement over last year,
when he exited this same tourna
ment in the first round.
"Both Jeff and I felt really
good about his game lagainst
Clarkl," Whitlinger said. "I felt
he didn't play a great first set,
which he lost. Clark really didn't
beat him. But [Jeff] thinks
through matches well. He fought
back and really took the second
set as opposed to Clark giving it
to him. Clark just played a
tremendous third set to beat
Jeff."
Stanford's other representa
tive in the championship brack
et, freshman Scott Humphries,
advanced to the second round by
defeating Lars Hjarrand from
the University of Minnesota.
Humphries' determination
carried him through his first
round match. Humphries
secured the first set 7-6, but
Hjarrand took the second by a
score of 3-6. Humphries then
trailed in the third set 5-3 and
had to fight off three match
points to narrow the gap to 4-5.
He then went on to break serve
twice and hold his own serve,
giving him the match 7-6, 3-6, 7-
5.
"I basically told him to find a
way to break his serve and win
the match," Whitlinger said. "It
would've been easy for him to
fold, but he didn't."
Humphries put himself in a
similar situation in the second
round but couldn't manage to
win the third set. His opponent,
Tad Berkowitz of the University
of New Mexico captured that
match 6-2, 4-6, 6-3.
The Cardinal also saw three of
its players competing to earn a
spot in the championship brack
et through the qualifying tour
nament held prior to the official
event. None of the three players
