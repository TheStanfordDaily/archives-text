## Stanford ranked No. 1

"The best of both worlds."
That's how Assistant Direc
tor of Admissions John Bunnell
assesses Stanford. "It's a place
where students have a chance to
compete in the classroom and
on the playing field," he said.
Apparently, this is true. In a
recent study released by the
Boston Globe surveying univer
sities that excel in both aca
demics and athletics, Stanford
ranked first in the nation. With
269 NCAA individual champi
onships, 63 NCAA team titles,
and Scholastic Aptitude Test
scores ranging up to 1440 and
above, Stanford succeeds in cre
ating an environment in which
athletics and academics are
both pursued at the highest
level.
Consider also the beautiful
campus, the brand new sports
facilities and the top-ranked
coaches and academic depart
ments, and it's easy to under
stand why approximately
15,000 high school seniors
applied to Stanford last year for
a freshman class of 1,500.
According to Bunnell, admis
sions officers look at various cri
teria when reviewing an appli
cant's file. These include the
academic record, personal
achievements, and any special
talents. In addition, Bunnell
stated, admissions tries to look
at the "whole person" beneath
the statistics in order to create a
diverse freshman class.
Women's volleyball coach
Don Shaw emphasized that,

"Athletes have to have the
total package when they're
accepted here. They have to be
solid academically, not afraid of
a challenge, mature, and the
best athletically in the nation."
He added that Stanford stu
dent-athletes are "surrounded
by excellence" both in the
classroom and on the field and
that this often serves as an
even greater motivation to suc
ceed.
This year's Stanford field
hockey team, coached by Sheryl
Johnson, includes six athletes
that made last year's Academic
All-American Team. In order to
qualify an athlete must have a
3.4 or higher GPA and have
been a team starter or impor
tant reserve. Johnson stressed
that academics are the first fac
tor considered when recruiting
a prospective Stanford athlete,
and that any athlete who is
weak academically would not be
admitted.
"The people they [Stanford]
recruit are competitive, period
— whether they're on the court
or in the classroom," said fresh
man women's volleyball player
Kristin Folkl, who was named
Top Recruit of the Past Decade
by Volleyball Monthly
Cardinal running back
Anthony Bookman, a First-
Team Ail-American selection by
ESPN and the sixth best wide
receiver prospect in the country
according to Blue Chip, agreed.
"There's a strong work ethic
in the class and on the field at
Stanford," he said.
For athletes like Bookman and
Folkl who practice every day in
addition to having weekend
games, "learning to manage time
wisely" is the key. They both
added that for athletes this can
sometimes mean missing out on
the more social aspects of life on
the Farm.
However, Bookman believes
that Stanford was the best choice
for him.
"I came to Stanford for the
education," he said. "Even if [an
injury] ends my football career, a
degree from Stanford will last a
lifetime — and it's a respected
degree."
