# Courting — a female's view
## Gender dynamics in pickup basketball 
### 
Playing pickup basketball after four years of
high school hoops is like entering the battle
fields at Gettysburg with a background in
Risk. The first is real. The second is for pansies.
Indeed, the world of pickup is fraught with dan
ger: sweaty, smelly players edge and elbow their
way for the ball amidst a distinct absence of rules
and larger-than-life egos. It's a jungle of grunts and
groans, a testosterone-fed war. Most importantly,
it's a show — a theatrical production where the
prevailing attitude is, "Who cares, as long as it
looks good."
What makes it even more perilous — and inter
esting — is being the sole woman on the asphalt.
Playground ball actually provides a very good study
in sexism and the male "macho thing." It glaringly
brings to light disparities between the genders that
usually surface only at the most sensitive of times
concerning the most important of issues. Abortion.
Marriage. Equal pay.
Pickup hoops.
The first thing I noticed when I ventured onto
the playground as a frosh is that men generally
sweat more than women do, and their sweat is
smellier. When I guard a guy, especially a tall one,
my nose is virtually in his armpit if I'm going to
have a chance at denying him the ball. What's
amazing is that the men don't even notice the per
vading stench.
Of course, sweat is simply a fact of life. It's not
something that needs to provide impetus for a
heated discussion on gender differences, and I
don't mind it all that much. After a couple hours on
the courts, I certainly do not smell like a bed of
roses either.
Far from it, I'm afraid, because the fact of the
matter is, I'm working very hard out there. Being
the only woman also means being the first one

down the court in the futile hope of getting the long
pass.
It means shooting twice as well and making mis
takes half as much.
It means having to prove myself from the second
I step onto the court.
The guide to pickup etiquette states somewhere

that once
you've got
the ball, do
someth ing.
Don't pass,
don't be nice.
Take the
opportunity
to show the
others what
you've got,
and look
good while

you're doing it. Otherwise, best of luck getting the
ball back again.
For a woman, the rules apply to the extreme. To
begin with, the actual privilege of receiving a pass
usually comes after I've pushed and shoved my way
through the burly masses to get open.
More likely, there is nowhere else to pass, and
the point guard is forced between taking the long
shot himself or dishing off to the girl. So in the true
spirit of chivalry, he fulfills his female passing
quota and takes the chance.
Once I've caught the pass, the real fun begins.
The fundamental concern is simply to do some
thing effective at the very least. Otherwise, I won't
be seeing a pass until the next eclipse and I may as
well guard the pine for a while. Pickup etiquette
