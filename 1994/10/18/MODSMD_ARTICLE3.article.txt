# Police nab 2 suspected pickpockets
## Several football fans 'lost' items at game 
### September Treviño Staff writer 
Two suspects were formally
charged yesterday for allegedly
pickpocketing fans at Saturday
evening's football game against
USC, according to Stanford Police.
Police patrolling the stadium
received more than five separate
reports from football fans who
said they missed belongings after
being bumped by two suspicious
looking individuals in the con
course area, said Stanford Police
Capt. Raoul Niemeyer. He added
that police believe three suspects
were involved in the robberies —
two males and one female.
Police arrested 33-year-old An
thony Weaver of Oakland and 34-
year-old Shajauana Perry of
Berkeley Saturday at the game.
Niemeyer said Weaver has "an ex
tensive criminal record," while
there are outstanding traffic war
rants for Perry's arrest.
The third suspect, a tall black
male approximately 30 years old,
ran away from police, Niemeyer
said.
After meeting with police yes
terday, the Palo Alto District At
torney's office filed charges
against both Weaver and Perry.
While both face charges of
grand theft person, Weaver is also
charged with possession of stolen
property, destruction of evidence
and resisting arrest. He will also
be charged with being under the
influence of cocaine.
Perry faces additional charges
for outstanding traffic warrants
and possession of Mace with out a
license.
Authorities spotted Weaver in
action Saturday and detained him
for questioning, Niemeyer said.
While frisking Weaver, deputies
recovered a metal vial they allege
contained a quarter of a gram of
cocaine. They also found a knife
and a stolen solid gold money clip
holding $200 in cash, he said.
When police recovered the vial,
Weaver grabbed it and dumped
out the contents, Niemeyer said.
Some residue remained in the
vile, however, and authorities
said they hope it is enough to
identify the substance and con
firm suspicions.

Detective Mark Swineford,
working from witnesses' descrip
tions, spotted Perry conversing
with the third suspect and
stopped her for questioning.
While police detained Perry,
the third suspect ran away from
police and out of the stadium.
The authorities are working with
the San Francisco and Oakland
police departments to locate him.
Authorities sent Weaver to
San Jose Main Jail, while Perry
was taken to the Women's Facili
ty in Elmwood.
According to Niemeyer, the
pickpockets used "the classic
bump and hook technique." One
individual will bump into the vic
tim and while he or she is distract
ed, the "hook" will pick the vic
tim's pocket from behind, he said.
Although police were able to
recover one man's gold money
clip — valued at $1,000 — and
$200 in cash, they believe the
third suspect got away with most
of the stolen goods.
