# Sailing team gathers wind
## Cardinal places fifth at tauted Navy event 
### Daniel Kao Contributing writer 
The great Captain Alfred
Thayer Mahan, grand aficionado
of naval warfare and author of
such maritime classics as The
Influence of Sea Power Upon His
tory and The Interest of America
in Sea Power, Present and
Future, would probably overlook
the Stanford sailing team's fifth
place finish this weekend at the
Navy Fall Intersectional in
Anapolis, Md.
But that would be a mistake —

a big mistake because the rest of
the world of collegiate sailing cer
tainly won't any time soon.
Participating in a pool of 20
teams, 13 of which are ranked in
the top 20, the Cardinal sailors
gave the big boys from the east
coast a run for their money. The
ninth-ranked Cardinal finished
just 13 points out of third place,
beating third-ranked Charleston
among others. Host Navy domi
nated the field, followed by
Atlantic coast powerhouses St.
Mary's, Tufts and Old Dominion.
"The fifth-place finish was

pretty much on goal," said coach
Steve Bourdow. "We sailed as
expected, but suffered some
tough breaks. There were some
stupid mistakes in the beginning.
I wish they hadn't happened, but
they're correctable. I'm just
happy because we didn't get any
really bad finishes which is easy
to do in such a tough field of
teams."
Sailing in Division A, one of
the two dinghy divisions featur
ing the Flying Junior and 420
boats, senior skipper Charles
Meade and sophomore crew Leti
tia Yang scorched the waters at
the outset of the regatta. They
finished first in their first two
races and second in their third.
The duo led the pack after the
first half-day of competition, but
then a "stupid mistake" kicked
in. After being well ahead in one
of their races, Meade and Yang
crossed what they thought was
the finish line only to realize that
they had crossed the marker for
the starting line instead. The
error cost them 15 points, and
Meade and Yang eventually fin
ished second in their division
behind a tough Midshipmen
squad.
"They were running a lot of
race courses near each other,"
Yang said. "That and the fact
that the waves were very choppy
made the markers really hard to
see. It happened to a lot of other
schools too."
Freshman skipper Danny
Zimbaldi and junior crew Sibyl
Diver sailed in the other dinghy
division, which was also won by
Navy. Zimbaldi and Diver fin
ished sixth but were a mere six
points behind third. The two
sailed well in the Flying Juniors
but also suffered their share of
mishaps.
Under the stupid mistake cat
egory, Zimbaldi and Diver, after
also winning their first race,
were confused by marks in their
second race which cost them a
possible first-place finish. The
young freshman was also sailing
the 420's for the first time and
their pace fell off considerably
between the FJ's and the larger
420's.
In Division C, one of two sin
gle-handed Laser divisions,
junior Adam Lowry was a model
of consistency, finishing sixth by

avoiding much of the misfortune
plaguing other teammates. He
finished in the top 10 in all but
one race and had six top five fin
ishes as well. St. Mary's won the
division.
"I didn't have any extraordi
nary races, but I didn't have any
bad ones either," Lowry said. "I
think the team needed me to be
consistent and I was."
The Cardinal had freshman

John Meade racing in Division
D, the other Laser division.
Meade also had trouble with the
markers for the finish line but
came through down the stretch
to finish second to Charleston's
sailor.
"John won four out of his last
five," Bourdow said. "Those
strong finishes held the team up
at the end."
So while mistakes were made,

markers were missed, and wrong
lines were crossed, Stanford still
finished impressively, and the
question now is what could it do
if it didn't make these mistakes.
"We're happy about the way
things went. We're frustrated by
the mistakes because in the end
we were only out of third by 13
points," Lowry said. "The mis
takes were little, and through the
season, they'll be ironed out."

As Lowry suggests, this regat
ta proved not only that Stanford
is the power of the West, but that
Stanford could be the power of
the entire nation.
"It's amazing. 1 didn't expect
us to do so well," Yang said. "It's
only early October, and we've
only had about five practices. I
can't wait until we really develop
the great depth that we have.
Then, it'll be something."

Steve Bourdow. "We sailed as
expected, but suffered some
tough breaks. There were some
stupid mistakes in the beginning.
I wish they hadn't happened, but
they're correctable. I'm just
happy because we didn't get any
really bad finishes which is easy
to do in such a tough field of
teams."
Sailing in Division A, one of
the two dinghy divisions featur
ing the Flying Junior and 420
boats, senior skipper Charles
Meade and sophomore crew Leti
tia Yang scorched the waters at
the outset of the regatta. They
finished first in their first two
races and second in their third.
The duo led the pack after the
first half-day of competition, but
then a "stupid mistake" kicked
in. After being well ahead in one
of their races, Meade and Yang
crossed what they thought was
the finish line only to realize that
they had crossed the marker for
the starting line instead. The
error cost them 15 points, and
Meade and Yang eventually fin
ished second in their division
behind a tough Midshipmen
squad.
"They were running a lot of
race courses near each other,"
Yang said. "That and the fact
that the waves were very choppy
made the markers really hard to
see. It happened to a lot of other
schools too."
Freshman skipper Danny
Zimbaldi and junior crew Sibyl
Diver sailed in the other dinghy
division, which was also won by
Navy. Zimbaldi and Diver fin
ished sixth but were a mere six
points behind third. The two
sailed well in the Flying Juniors
but also suffered their share of
mishaps.
Under the stupid mistake cat
egory, Zimbaldi and Diver, after
also winning their first race,
were confused by marks in their
second race which cost them a
possible first-place finish. The
young freshman was also sailing
the 420's for the first time and
their pace fell off considerably
between the FJ's and the larger
420's.
In Division C, one of two sin
gle-handed Laser divisions,
junior Adam Lowry was a model
of consistency, finishing sixth by

avoiding much of the misfortune
plaguing other teammates. He
finished in the top 10 in all but
one race and had six top five fin
ishes as well. St. Mary's won the
division.
"I didn't have any extraordi
nary races, but I didn't have any
bad ones either," Lowry said. "I
think the team needed me to be
consistent and I was."
The Cardinal had freshman

John Meade racing in Division
D, the other Laser division.
Meade also had trouble with the
markers for the finish line but
came through down the stretch
to finish second to Charleston's
sailor.
"John won four out of his last
five," Bourdow said. "Those
strong finishes held the team up
at the end."
So while mistakes were made,

markers were missed, and wrong
lines were crossed, Stanford still
finished impressively, and the
question now is what could it do
if it didn't make these mistakes.
"We're happy about the way
things went. We're frustrated by
the mistakes because in the end
we were only out of third by 13
points," Lowry said. "The mis
takes were little, and through the
season, they'll be ironed out."

As Lowry suggests, this regat
ta proved not only that Stanford
is the power of the West, but that
Stanford could be the power of
the entire nation.
"It's amazing. 1 didn't expect
us to do so well," Yang said. "It's
only early October, and we've
only had about five practices. I
can't wait until we really develop
the great depth that we have.
Then, it'll be something."

Cardinal sailers surged to a fifth-place finish at the Navy Fall Intersectional last weekend. Stanford was pleased with its performance, as
the regatta featured 13 of the nation's top-20 teams.
