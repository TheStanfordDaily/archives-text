# Sailing team gathers wind
## Cardinal places fifth at tauted Navy event 
### Daniel Kao Contributing writer 
The great Captain Alfred
Thayer Mahan, grand aficionado
of naval warfare and author of
such maritime classics as The
Influence of Sea Power Upon His
tory and The Interest of America
in Sea Power, Present and
Future, would probably overlook
the Stanford sailing team's fifth
place finish this weekend at the
Navy Fall Intersectional in
Anapolis, Md.
But that would be a mistake â€”

a big mistake because the rest of
the world of collegiate sailing cer
tainly won't any time soon.
Participating in a pool of 20
teams, 13 of which are ranked in
the top 20, the Cardinal sailors
gave the big boys from the east
coast a run for their money. The
ninth-ranked Cardinal finished
just 13 points out of third place,
beating third-ranked Charleston
among others. Host Navy domi
nated the field, followed by
Atlantic coast powerhouses St.
Mary's, Tufts and Old Dominion.
"The fifth-place finish was

pretty much on goal," said coach
Steve Bourdow. "We sailed as
expected, but suffered some
tough breaks. There were some
stupid mistakes in the beginning.
I wish they hadn't happened, but
they're correctable. I'm just
happy because we didn't get any
really bad finishes which is easy
to do in such a tough field of
teams."
