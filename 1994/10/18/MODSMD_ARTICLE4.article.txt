# Drastic changes or fine tuning?
## Students, professors ponder CUE impact 
### Beth Berselli Senior staff writer 
As students and faculty digest the proposed changes
included in the Commission on Undergraduate Educa
tion's final report, one question seems to surface: What
did this year-long, intensive study of Stanford's under
graduate program actually accomplish?
Many contend that the recently released report
proposes no major changes to the University. But
several students and some faculty members are con
cerned that the report could drastically alter Stan
ford's undergraduate experience.
Commission members say the report was never
intended as a sweeping reform of the system, but was
instead meant to improve on an already-excellent
undergraduate program.
The report's recommendations are "not drastic in
any sense," said History Prof. James Sheehan, the com
mission 's chair. "A headline for a story about our report
could read, 'Stanford doing well, could do better.' "
If the report's recommendations are implemented,
however, incoming freshmen several years down the
road could be faced with a revamped and renamed
Cultures, Ideas and Values course, a year-long foreign
language requirement and a
mandatory three-quarter science
core for non-scientists.
"As a freshman, CIV and
English alone were a major bur
den. If there was a science core, it
would limit your options. Stu
dents need room to experiment,"
said sophomore Erin Leydig.
But regardless of their opin
ions about the recommendations,
many students and faculty realize
that the proposed changes are not
set in stone. The University's
financial constraints and
unknown faculty sentiment
toward the proposals have left
some wondering whether imple
mentation of any dramatic
changes will ever occur.
A drastic report?
The report's recommendations
include developing a new science
course for non-science majors,
creating the position of vice
provost for undergraduate educa-

tion, redefining
the CIV courses
and strengthen
ing Stanford's
writing and lan
guage require
ments, as well as
its advising sys
tem.
"It's not a
dramatic new
breakthrough,"

said English Prof. Robert Polhe
mus, a member of the Faculty
Senate. "It's not a revolutionary
report. It's not a reactionary
report. I think the general princi
ples will be accepted."
Statistics Prof. Bradley Efron,
a senate member, agreed that the
report wasn't drastic.
"It reflects University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper a lot in that
it's a moderate report centered on
academic values rather than
social issues," he said.
Casper — who created the
commission in April 1993 to con
duct the first comprehensive
study of Stanford's undergradu
ate program in nearly a quarter of
a century — has repeatedly said
the group was not meant to fix a
specific problem, but rather to
engage in "quality control."
But some faculty and students
said they believe the commis
sion's recommendations will

make major changes in Stanford's
undergraduate program.
Economics Prof. Roger Noll, a
senate member, said the proposed
changes are "very dramatic and
drastic." He added he believes the
biggest change of all would be the
development of the new science
core.
Several students also expressed
concern that a science core would
be a "burden" and would limit
students' flexibility in choosing
courses.
"It's fine to make students
experiment in other disciplines,
but I think these recommenda
tions go too far," Leydig said.
Requiring a three-quarter sci
ence core, in addition to increas
ing the writing and foreign lan
guage requirements, will serious
ly limit students' freedom to
choose courses, Leydig said.
Sophomore Kerri Persons,
however, said she supports the
development of a science core.
"Everyone should have to take
that math and science because it's
such an integral part of society
once you get out of college," she
said.
"If you're a techie, they make
you take fuzzy courses like CIV,"
she said. "But for fuzzy people
they don't require or demand the
same level of learning in the sci
ence and math areas."
Many students would probably
prefer a more flexible science
core, said sophomore Houman
Hemmati, who served on the Stu
dent Advisory Group on Under
graduate Education, which
advised the commission last year.
Students should be able to take
one or two quarters of the core,
instead of the mandatory three
quarter sequence recommended
by the commission, Hemmati
said.
By absorbing the World and
American Cultures distribution
requirements (Areas 2 and 3) into
a redefined CIV course, the rec
ommendations would actually
reduce the number of DRs by two.
The recommendations would
also allow students the option to
choose any three classes in the
Humanities and Social Science
DRs (Areas 7, 8 and 9). Under this
proposed system, for example, an
engineering student could take
three English classes to fulfill her
DRs — never taking a social sci
ence class at Stanford.
The report states, that stu
dents would be "required to
define some thematic connection

among these three courses, which
would have to be approved by
their advisors."
Hemmati added that most of
the report's proposals coincided
with those recommended by the
student advisory group.
Successful implementation?
Now that the commission has
completed its recommendations,
the major question remaining is
whether they will be implement
ed.
Most of the commission's pro
posals will be instituted in some
form or another, said Biological
Science Prof. Pat Jones, former
chair and current member of the
senate. University financial con
straints and faculty support, how-

ever, could be
major deterrents
to implementing
the recommen
dations.
"What it's
going to come
down to is if fac
ulty are willing
to participate,"
Polhemus said.

Faculty must be willing to
serve on the two new design com
mittees, which will develop the
science and culture cores, he said.
The commission's report stipu
lates that only faculty willing to
teach classes in the core will be
allowed to serve on the design
committees.
Noll said the science core has
about a "50-50 chance" of being
implemented.
"Not only will it take a major
commitment by the faculty, but a
serious budgetary commitment
by the University," he said.
Many faculty said they are con
fident that the University admin
istration is committed to provid
ing financial support for the rec
ommendations.
"I think Gerhard Casper will
make sure most of it gets passed.
I'm confident he will put
resources toward it," Efron said.
The administration has not
identified the exact cost of imple
menting the recommendations,
but Casper and Provost Con
doleezza Rice have both pledged
to provide the necessary
resources.
"This is at the core of what we
do," Rice said at a press confer
ence last Wednesday. "Obviously
we're going to try to find money
for it."
Before any of the recommenda-

If you're a techie,
they make you take
fuzzy courses like
CIV. But for fuzzy
people they don't
require or demand
the same level of
learning in the
science and math
areas.'

tions are implemented, however,
broad discussion needs to occur,
said English Prof. Regenia Gag
nier, a senate member.
"The Faculty Senate needs to
discuss at large the general rec
ommendations," Gagnier said.
"They must be discussed before
we move forward. It shouldn't be
considered a fait accompli."
Student input necessary
Faculty and students alike
agree that gathering student
input is an essential part of the
implementation process.
"It would be foolish for the
community to proceed without
student consultation," said Span
ish and Portuguese Prof. Mary
Pratt, a senate member. "Student
views are critical in the discus
sions about the DRs."
One way for students to effec
tively contribute their opinions
about the recommendations is
to allow them to serve on the
two design committees, Pratt
said.
Student membership on these
committees is vital, said cotermi
nal student Luz Herrera, the lone
undergraduate on the commis
sion.
"The students have been a
driving force in many of these
changes," said ASSU Senate
Chair Nawwar Kasrawi. "Stu
dents need to be included on these
committees."
At last Thursday's Faculty
Senate meeting, Rice expressed
reservations about student mem
bership on the design committees.
However, she did say student
input will definitely be sought out
and considered.
