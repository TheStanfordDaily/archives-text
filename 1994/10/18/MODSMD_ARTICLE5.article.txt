'As a freshman, CIV and Eng
lish alone were a major bur
den. If there was a science
core, It would limit your op
tions. Students need room to
experiment.'
'The Faculty Senate needs to
discuss at large the general
recommendations. It
shouldn't be considered a
fait accompli.'
'It would be foolish for the
community to proceed with
out student consultation. Stu
dent views are critical in the
discussions about the DRs.'
It's not a dramatic new
breakthrough. It's not a revo
lutionary report. It's not a re
actionary report. I think the
general principles will be ac
cepted. '
