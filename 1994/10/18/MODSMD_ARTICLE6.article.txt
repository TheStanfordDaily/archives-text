# Committee will explore undergrad admissions
## Decreasing yield rate source of some concern 
### Frank Guinan Staff writer 
Although admissions officers claim
Stanford is attracting smarter and more di
verse students than ever, the Office of Ad
missions and Financial Aids recently
formed a committee to look into reforming
the admissions process.
Among the changes the committee will
consider are more faculty involvement in
undergraduate admissions and an early de
cision program.
"To attract students, we have to have the
best faculty," said James Montoya, dean of
admissions and financial aids. "We need to
find the best way to feature our faculty in
the recruitment process."
Montoya asked for the committee's for

mation last week, partly in response to the
decreasing yield rates of incoming fresh
man classes. Yield rates represent the per
centage of students accepted who choose to
attend Stanford.
The move follows on the heels of a letter
to the editor written by former Stanford
News Service director Bob Byers. The letter
— published in Campus Report — stated
that "among the top scholars identified by
the editors of USA Today, 16 chose Har
vard, none came to Stanford."
Byers also related the drop in Stanford's
yield rate to a downsizing of the admissions
staff.
According to Montoya, Stanford's yield
rate stood at around 60 percent during the
1980s. In 1990, it dropped to 56.7
percent, and it has been steadily
declining ever since. The rate for
this year's freshman class was 54
percent.
The committee will be chaired
by Assoc. Director of Admissions
John Reider and Physics Dept.
Chair Doug Osheroff. According
to Reider, the committee's main
responsibility will be to devise
ways to increase faculty interac
tion with prospective students,
even before notification of accep
tance is given out.
"We want to get at students
earlier, have faculty call or write
to them," Reider said, adding that
newsletters serve as an example
of how faculty can provide more
information about their respec
tive departments.
Montoya said the admissions
office is already working with the
Math Department to identify top
math students in the country and
encourage them to apply.
"We want to adapt that model
with faculty in other fields," Mon
toya said.
He added that students are
currently asking a different set of
questions which no longer can be
answered by admissions officers.
These questions "can only be
answered by faculty," he said.
Although the committee has
not met yet, Osheroff said he
believes members will be trying to
see how Stanford can be more
aggressive.

"We need to look at what is the
acceptance ratio and whether we
are getting the mix of people we
want," said. "Faculty involvement
will help in both those areas."
The committee will also be con
sidering implementing an early
decision / early admission program.
"Stanford notifies everyone on
the same date," Osheroff said.
"This puts us at a competitive dis
advantage with other [universi
ties] who have early admissions."
Montoya said such a move
would be "the single biggest
change in admissions" since the
University got rid of interviews.
