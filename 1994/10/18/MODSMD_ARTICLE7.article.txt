# 'We can no longer think of ourselves as the passive victims of history.'
## Wolf speaks on power feminism 
### Amy Slucter 
Noted author Naomi Wolf
challenged a Memorial Auditori
um audience last night to look be
yond the connotations of the
word "feminist" and seek the de
mocratic ideal of equality.
"Nowadays, feminism has be
come negatively associated as
anti-humanistic and anti-male.
But it is only the logical extension
of the democratic ideal — that
women are human beings," she
told a group of several hundred
Stanford men and women in a
speech sponsored by the ASSU
Speaker's Bureau.

A Yale graduate and Rhodes
Scholar as well as author of "The
Beauty Myth," Wolf held an inti
mate rapport with the audience
last night, leaving the stage to
stand on the main floor of the au
ditorium. She even encouraged a
few women to share their girl
hood fantasies about power and
recognition, declaring, "Let's
play Oprah!"
Wolf pointed out that little
girls are not all sugar and spice.
"Little girls want to rule the
world," she said. However, girls
are taught to cover over conflict
and "think nice."
As little girls mature, Wolf

said, they tend to sublimate their
desire for power in order to fit the
traditional roles of women as
kinder and more peaceful than
men. Such roles perpetuate what
Wolf calls "victim" feminism.
Wolf draws a sharp contrast
between "victim" feminism and
"power" feminism. "The only
way to be a feminist under the
'victim' line of thinking is to go to
a convent in Vermont and ignore
currency," Wolf said.
In contrast, Wolfs idea of fem
inism — "power feminism" —
does not allow women to with

draw themselves from the social
arena.
"Power to bring about political
equality for women is now within
our grasp," said Wolf. "We can no
longer think of ourselves as the
passive victims of history. We are
no longer even the co-pilot. We
are flying the plane."
The secret to flying the plane,
Wolf said, is simple: economic
clout. If every woman who could
afford the expense would con
tribute $6 to a feminist group,
women would have a $600 million
budget to support 250,000 female

candidates in what Wolf called "a
national gender coup."
Such economic power is, in
Wolf s mind, the "secret of the
revolution," while the ideology of
"victim" feminism is not.
Wolf criticized "victim" femi
nists for creating a political agen
da that alienates many women
from the movement. Many
women embrace equality but
reject "feminism" because of the
negative connotations associated
with the word, she said.
While "victim" feminists may
assert that "all sex is rape" and
"the penis is the enemy," Wolf
said, "a lot of women go home at
night after a long, hard day at
work and feel that the penis is
their friend."

Discrediting men is not what
"power feminists" hope to do,
Wolf said. "Power feminism" is
based on a humanistic approach
to sharing both responsibility and
recognition.
In many cases, women per
ceive that in order to be a femi
nist they must be democratic, lib
eral, vegetarian and pro-choice.
Wolf argues, however, that the
true concerns of the movement
include eliminating unequal pay,
sexual assault and sex discrimi
nation.
The goal of feminism is to cre
ate "a better and fairer world for
our daughters," Wolf said, and
not to quibble over what is super
fluous to the main thrust of the
movement: equality.

The notion of improving soci
ety for future generations is espe
cially significant to Wolf since she
is pregnant. Wolf asserts that the
new child, whether male or
female, will "be a feminist."
Last night was the final stop on
Wolfs tour to promote her new
book "Fire With Fire: the New
Female Power and How It Will
Change the 21st Century."
Senior Scott Moss, director of
the speakers bureau, was glad
that Wolf was able to find time to
include Stanford in her tour. "She
is on the cutting edge of things,"
Moss said after the speech.
"Naomi Wolf maybe had more to
say to women because of their
shared experiences — but men
maybe had more to learn."
