# 'Isolated glimmers of hope'
## Stanford grads join Inner-City Teaching Corps 
### Heather Knight 
It's just another day in Chicago's inner
city schools.
Children confide in their journals that win
ter is their favorite season because it is too cold
for drug dealers to loiter outside their school.
Robert talks back to his teacher — she later
finds that his anger is due to his constant expo
sure to domestic violence. On Back-To-School-
Night, a local gang throws a Molotov cocktail
into the principal's car, leaving it in flames.
Such alarming occurrences leave young
students four or five years behind in their
education and often distrusting adults.
But the Inner-City Teaching Corps —
founded in 1991 — is trying to combat these
problems by sending college graduates to
teach in disadvantaged classrooms on a
largely volunteer basis (the teachers'
salaries amount to $5 a day).

Among its 21 volunteers are two '94
Stanford graduates, Maria Maxfield and
Rick Rutherford.
Though the two have only been teaching
for five weeks, Rutherford already describes
his experience as "the most difficult thing I
have ever done in my life without question,"
partially because ICTC schools are in the
worst neighborhoods of Chicago. Ruther
ford teaches eighth grade at Our Lady of
Angels — which is 90 percent African-
American — while Maxfield instructs sixth
graders at a mostly Hispanic school, St. Pro
copius. Both neighborhoods are stricken
with poverty and centered in drug-dealer
territory. Thirteen deaths occurred on the
street behind St. Procopius last year alone.

ICTC, describes Maxfield and Rutherford

as having, "a passion for service
and boundless enthusiasm"
which help them withstand the
rigors of their demanding jobs.
Rutherford describes a typical
day as waking up at 6 in the morn
ing, teaching a hectic class from
8:20-2:20, disciplining kids who
did not complete their homework,
coaching basketball, getting home
around 6 p.m., helping with
chores, grading papers, calling
parents and finally getting to sleep
sometimes as late as 3:00 a.m.
However, the pay — or lack
thereof — has not been a major
problem. Rutherford and Maxfield
live with five other ICTC teachers
in a convent (without the nuns).
Rutherford describes the living
situation as similar to MTV's "Real
World." ICTC provides teachers
with cars and $3 a day for food.
To make ends meet, the seven
pool their money so that they can
buy in bulk at warehouses.

"Living on $5 a day has been
really easy because the program
takes care of us, but I don't have
much money to go out on the
weekends," Maxfield said.
These private Catholic schools
save $3000 per teacher by employ
ing volunteers. With this extra
money, they are able to provide
tuition for the needy students,
which is about $80 to $100 a month.
Rutherford said his hard work
does not have an immediate
impact. "The problems are really
deep, it is not a quick fix," he said.
Sometimes, when the students
are misbehaving or when he reads
in their journals that they "hate
him and school sucks," Ruther
ford says he feels like yelling, "Do
you realize I am working for free
to educate you?"
Though much of the time
spent with students is frustrat
ing, both Rutherford and Max
field have had their share of
rewarding moments.
Rutherford stayed after school
with a small group of students
recently to show them a simple
science demonstration. He had
them take toothpicks and rub the

inner sides of their cheeks. When
the students saw their cheek cells
under a microscope, they were
mesmerized and called Ruther
ford "the coolest guy."
He said experiences like these
make all the difference. "They are
isolated glimmers of hope which
keep me going," he said.
When Maxfield was having
problems with her students mak
ing negative comments, she imple
mented a new policy. Students
had to make positive comments
after saying something negative in
order to go to lunch.
The students had a hard time at
first with this rule and it resulted in
some fights. But with time, it has
become a contest to see who can
make the most positive comments.
"At first it started off with the
students saying simple things
like, 'I hope we have a good day'
or Teacher is nice', but now they
are really complimenting each
other by saying things like 'Our
class is smart'. . .It has been real
ly rewarding to have them trying
so hard this early on," she said.
Though both Rutherford and
Maxfield had participated in com

munity service at Stanford, neither
expected to be where they are today.
Rutherford planned to go to medical
school while law school was Max
field's goal. They are both consider
ing following through with their
original plans after their two-year
volunteer commitment Ls over, but
are also thinking about teaching.
According to Swanson ICTC
is, "the most competitive volun
teer program of its type." This
year ICTC had 130 applicants
for 15 positions. Swanson and
others are working to expand
ICTC to Boston and more neigh
borhoods in Chicago. The
changes may be implemented as
soon as next fall.
The principals of the 12 schools
where ICTC is currently active
want more ICTC volunteers. This
year, there were requests for 100
teachers, meaning that 79 requests
could not be met.
Swanson attributes the pro
gram's success to teachers like
Rutherford and Maxfield.
"The children get a young,
enthusiastic, talented teacher
who brings a whole new perspec
tive and energy to the children."
