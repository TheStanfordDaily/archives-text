# 'Isolated glimmers of hope'
## Stanford grads join Inner-City Teaching Corps

It's just another day in Chicago's inner
city schools.
Children confide in their journals that win
ter is their favorite season because it is too cold
for drug dealers to loiter outside their school.
Robert talks back to his teacher — she later
finds that his anger is due to his constant expo
sure to domestic violence. On Back-To-School-
Night, a local gang throws a Molotov cocktail
into the principal's car, leaving it in flames.
Such alarming occurrences leave young
students four or five years behind in their
education and often distrusting adults.
But the Inner-City Teaching Corps —
founded in 1991 — is trying to combat these
problems by sending college graduates to
teach in disadvantaged classrooms on a
largely volunteer basis (the teachers'
salaries amount to $5 a day).

Among its 21 volunteers are two '94
Stanford graduates, Maria Maxfield and
Rick Rutherford.
Though the two have only been teaching
for five weeks, Rutherford already describes
his experience as "the most difficult thing I
have ever done in my life without question,"
partially because ICTC schools are in the
worst neighborhoods of Chicago. Ruther
ford teaches eighth grade at Our Lady of
Angels — which is 90 percent African-
American — while Maxfield instructs sixth
graders at a mostly Hispanic school, St. Pro
copius. Both neighborhoods are stricken
with poverty and centered in drug-dealer
territory. Thirteen deaths occurred on the
street behind St. Procopius last year alone.
