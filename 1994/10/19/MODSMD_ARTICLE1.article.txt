# U.S., University settle indirect-cost dispute
## Government drops claims of wrongdoing 
### Scott Van Winkle Senior staff writer 
Ending more than fouryears of pub
lic dispute that has cost Stanford mil
lions of dollars and no small portion of
its prestige, the federal government
yesterday dropped all claims that the
University overbilled it by $185 million
in research costs over a period of 12
years.
The federal Office of Naval Re
search had questioned the validity of
payments made to the University from
1981 to 1992, settling yesterday for a
$1.2 million fee and the withdrawal of
the University's counter-claim against
the government for $56 million.
The office said it would withdraw
any claims that the University engaged
in fraud, misrepresentation or other
wrongdoing in disbursing some of the
funds intended to cover the indirect
costs of government-sponsored re
search.
Though other schools — such as
MIT and Caltech — were also involved
in the indirect-cost controversy, Stan
ford was the focus of the charges and of
the press attention, which lead to con
gressional hearings on the issue and
the 1992 resignation of then-Universi
ty President Donald Kennedy.
Indirect costs, or the percentage of
grant money that can be used to cover
costs of government-sponsored re
search, are costs that cannot be attrib
uted to a single project, such as build-

ing depreciation. The
indirect-cost rate is
set by negotiation be
tween an individual
university and the
ONR
At the center of the
settled charges are
"memoranda of un
derstanding" — writ
ten agreements be-

tween the University and the govern
ment that allow certain interpreta
tions of the laws governing indirect
cost reimbursement.
In April 1991, ONR canceled all but
one of the more than 100 Stanford
MoUs, then slashed the University's
indirect cost rate for 1991 and 1992.
Stanford's claim against the govern
ment stemmed from this reduction,
which it said resulted in an inadequate
reimbursement for the University's
real costs.
The government office found $185
million of the $734 million in indirect
cost payments made during the 12 au
dited years questionable.
Most of that money, the office now
says, was spent legitimately because
the memoranda of understanding are
legally binding.
Costs of the controversy
The dispute arose in 1990 as govern
ment auditors charged that the Uni
versity had used inappropriate ac

counting procedures to inflate reim
bursement rates.
Revelations that the University had
charged the government for items such
as the depreciation of a yacht and for
antiques for the University President's
home led to increased scrutiny, culmi
nating in the congressional hearings.
The University apologized for
billing the government for some of the
these more egregious costs, repaying
some $2 million in "accounting errors"
to the government in 1991.

In response to the controversy, the
federal government in November 1993
decided that universities could no
longer use indirect-cost funds to pay
for graduate student tuition, a practice
known as tuition remission.
The University continued to say it
did nothing wrong, charging the gov
ernment had in fact underpaid the Uni
versity when it slashed the indirect cost
rate to 55.5 percent during 1991 and
