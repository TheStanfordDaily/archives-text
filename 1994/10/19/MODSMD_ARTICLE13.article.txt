Serb shooting
SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herze
govina (AP) — Serb soldiers
shot to death a food convoy
driver yesterday, a day after
comrades hijacked a medical
supply convoy in some of the
worst back-to-back blows to
this year's U.N. relief effort.
The two actions underscore
the Bosnian Serbs' determina
tion to make their Muslim
foes on government-held ter
ritory share their suffering.
Bosnian Serbs are increas
ingly short of supplies since
being cut off by their former
patrons in Serb-led Yugoslavia
for rejecting a peace plan that
would reduce their war-won
holdings in Bosnia by one
third.
U.N. officials still were fum
ing about the theft of medical
supplies Monday when they
learned of the attack that killed
a driver in Gorazde.
The commander of British
peacekeepers in the Muslim
enclave requested close air sup
port, but senior U.N. officials
decided against calling in
NATO air strikes.

The three-truck convoy was
attacked as it was carrying food
and seed from Gorazde to outly
ing villages. One Bosnian driver
was killed; there were conflict
ing reports about whether
another driver was wounded.
TV show dropped
OSLO, Norway (AP) — The
death of a five-year-old girl who
was stoned and kicked by play
mates and left to freeze in the
snow has stunned this peaceful
nation and sent people search
ing for an explanation.
No one knows if violent tele
vision played a role, but the net
works didn't take any chances.
The Scandinavian network
TV-3 moved quickly yesterday
to drop the wildly popular U.S.
children's show "Mighty Mor
phin Power Rangers" from its
broadcasts in Norway, Sweden
and Denmark in response to
debate over violence in chil
dren's shows.
None of the shows have
been directly linked to the
death of five-year-old Silje
Marie Redergard, who froze to
death Saturday.
