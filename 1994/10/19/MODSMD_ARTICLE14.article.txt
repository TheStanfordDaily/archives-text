### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) - An
explosive new book has threat
ened O.J. Simpson's right to a fair
trial, a judge said yesterday as he
abruptly suspended jury selection
and warned potential panelists to
avoid all media.
The interruption came just
hours after Superior Court Judge
Lance Ito handed prosecutors a
stunning victory, rejecting any
sanctions for delays in DNA test
ing of a bloody glove and other
evidence. Last week, he had
warned prosecutors, "You are

going to lose."
Ito said he could find no proof
that prosecutors acted in bad
faith nor any case law or statute
that would permit him to punish
them for waiting to begin some
tests until three months after the
slayings of Simpson's ex-wife and
her friend.
In halting jury selection until
tomorrow, Ito said he and lawyers
in the case will explore how to
deal with Monday's release of
"Nicole Brown Simpson: The Pri
vate Diary of a Life Interrupted,"

written by Faye Resnick, a close
friend of Ms. Simpson's.
Ms. Resnick portrays a stormy
relationship during which Simp
son stalked and threatened his ex
wife, saying he would kill her if
she slept with another man.
Ito had a clerk buy the book for
him yesterday morning at a near
by store.
"There are certain recent
developments regarding the pub
lication of a book that caused the
court great concern about the
ability of Mr. Simpson to get a fair

trial," Ito told the jury pool.
"Because of the change in the
intensity of the coverage, I'm
going to have to increase the
restrictions to you," he said. "I
am going to order you not to read
any newspapers, any magazines,
or watch any TV or listen to any
radio."
Later, he added "You are to
stay out of book stores."
Lead defense attorney Robert
Shapiro said the proceedings "left
a very dark cloud over our system
of justice."
