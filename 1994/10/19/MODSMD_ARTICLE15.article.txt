JERUSALEM (AP) - PLO chief Yasser
Arafat condemned the Israel-Jordan peace
accord yesterday, calling it an "outrageous
infringement" of the PLO's peace agreement
with Israel and a betrayal of Palestinian inter
ests.
The Jordanian prime minister, meanwhile,
said his country made a separate peace with
Israel because it could not wait for other Arab
states to move, and urged Syria to move
toward peace with Israel.
Syrian President Hafez Assad said the for
mula used to resolve the land dispute between
Jordan and Israel would never work when it
came to Syria's claim on the Golan Heights.

The arrangement calls for Israel to return
most of the 152 square miles of border land it
seized from Jordan in 1948, but allows Israel
to lease areas where there are Israeli settle
ments or farms. Israeli officials have suggest
ed it could be a model for a similar arrange
ment with Syria.
But Assad said yesterday that Syria would
never agree to such a lease-back plan. Israel
seized the Golan Heights in the 1967 Middle
East war and Syria insists it must be returned
in full.
"It is apostasy for anyone to speak of a
nation leasing its land," Assad said at a news
conference in Cairo, Egypt. "There will be no

peace as long as the land is not returned fully."
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin chid
ed Assad for rejecting such an arrangement
out of hand.
"It is a mistake for Assad to stick to his
stubborness," Rabin said during an official
visit in London yesterday. "Syria has
remained alone in its hostility with Israel."
The agreement with Jordan, Rabin added,
meant that Israel "will never claim a square
kilometer or centimeter of sovereign Jordani
an land."
Assad criticized Jordan for forging a sepa
rate peace with Israel, but said Syria would
not do anything to upset it.
