Failure of fire alarm in
Branner Hall shows why
safety must come first

WHEN STUDENTS GATH
ER at their first house
meetings to discuss safety
in their dormitories, they usually
address issues such as theft and
assault. Most never think to ques
tion the safety of the building itself.
However, on October 9, resi
dents of Branner Hall realized that
the safety provided by the Univer
sity may not be enough. The
dorm's brand new fire alarm sys
tem — installed just this summer
— malfunctioned when smoke
filled one hallway.
Although the audible alarm sys
tem worked properly, waking stu
dents up and sending them into the
cold night air, it failed to alert Palo
Alto's emergency dispatch center of
the problem. With one electric
switch programmed incorrectly,
the "protection" system potentially
placed the lives of residents in dan
ger.
When asked how three inspec
tions could have missed this over
sight, Stanford Fire Protection
Systems Manager Arleen Musci
pointed to time constraints
imposed on construction crews to
finish the project before the arrival
of students. Hurrying to meet an
unbending deadline, workers sim
ply overlooked the potential haz
ard.
It hardly seems right that safety
should suffer the same cuts that
are plaguing almost all other areas
of the University. Safety must be a
higher priority than meeting dead
lines.
If the work could not be finished
by the time the students arrived,
the inspections should have contin
ued as students moved in. Students
and concerned parents would
undoubtedly prefer a thorough job
— with the minor inconvenience of

having inspectors still at work — to
unsafe rooms.
Furthermore, with better plan
ning the fire system updating pro
ject may not have been so rushed,
and the mistake could have been
corrected before anyone was put at
risk. The University should have
either started the job earlier or paid
extra money for more workers to
complete the project on time. What
cost is so high that students' lives
are not worth the money and
effort?
The incident at Branner calls the
safety of many other students into
question. This summer's Florence
Moore Hall renovations went right
down to the wire — one wonders
what could go wrong there. Should
students be alarmed that their
home may not be safe? The dormi
tory's state-of-the-art fire system
comes complete with more alarms
and new sprinklers to meet 1994
fire safety regulations. Because Flo
Mo's system is so highly complicat
ed, inspectors have thoroughly
checked it for glitches.
Musci said that it would be "very
unlikely" that a mistake similar to
the one at Branner could go unde
tected at Flo Mo. But how can we
be sure that the same kind of over
sight that happened at Branner did
not happen at Flo Mo? It seems
hard to believe that security inspec
tors took fewer precautionary mea
sures to insure the safety of Bran
ner than they did for Flo Mo.
Periodic evacuation drills —
scheduled to start shortly — will
put Musci's promise to the test.
Quarterly maintenance checks are
also planned to prevent any future
problems.
Musci assured students that
although her department is also in
charge of fire inspections for aca
demic, athletic and library build
ings, housing stands as their num
ber one concern — most students
would agree that this is justified. In
the future, the University should
be aware that students would
rather live in an unfinished dorm
than burn in a finished one.
