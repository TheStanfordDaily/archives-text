Time and effort are needed to appreciate life overseas

WE ARE WRITING in indignant
response to Matt Gregory's
absurd article concerning the
Stanford Center in Paris [Friday, Octo
ber 14]. As two participants in last
year's program, we were outraged to
read such an inaccurate description of
the Paris center. Clearly Matt possess
es a deep misunderstanding of the
French and French culture and has
made little attempt to integrate him
self into French society. Like most
things in life, the Stanford program in
Paris is what you make of it, and with
out leaving the security of the Stanford
center and the Ecole Superieure de
Commerce de Paris [ESCP], any stu
dent's experience will remain limited.
To continue with your own analogy,
Matt, it is time to leave the playground
and go play with the big kids! Parisian
life varies greatly from life on the
Farm and should not be belittled for its
differences.
In order to appreciate these cultural
differences, Stanford offers students the
opportunity to live with French fami
lies. Unlike Matt's account, this experi
ence is not mere maid service during
which students are waited on hand and
foot, but a unique chance to participate
in everyday family life. Most families
truly enjoy hosting Stanford students
and go out of their way to enrich the
students' experiences. If the family vol
unteers to help someone with his/her
laundry or feed him/her on the week-

ends, this offer is purely a gesture of
goodwill; the families are not bound by
their contract to do so.
Since the host families do not feed
students on weekends or at lunch
because of logistical difficulties, the
Stanford program steps in to make up
the difference. Although students
receive 40 francs for each meal, this
hardly constitutes an exorbitant sum,
considering that a cup of hot chocolate
in France costs 20 francs, a sandwich
costs 25 francs, and a can of Coca-Cola
costs 10 francs. A simple meal in the
average restaurant costs about 80
francs. Some students may save a few
centimes by buying food in bulk at the
grocery store, but most treat the meal
allowance as part of their cultural expe
rience, and therefore choose to sample
French cuisine.
Adapting to the French university
system constitutes another part of the
cultural experience. In order to do so,
one must realize that the ESCP does not
represent till universities; just like
American universities, each French
school has its own distinctive character.
Before making any wild generalizations,
Matt should attend courses at other
institutions, like Sciences-Po, l'Ecole du
Louvre, or Paris VII in order to better
understand French student life and ped
agogy. The courses offered at Sciences-
Po, for example, are more intense than
many Stanford courses, and Sciences-Po
students certainly care about more than

just their next cigarette.
The classes at the Stanford in Paris
center parallel typical French universi
ty courses. Professors expect the same
respect and commitment from Stan
ford students that they typically find
in their French classrooms, but they
often go unappreciated by Stanford
students. For example, Matt finds
fault with the French lack of tolerance
for eating in public. The French, how
ever, believe that eating should occur
only during mealtimes and only in
appropriate places; eating in class
shows disrespect for the professor, not
only in France but also in the United
States.
Although such constraints often seem
parental, the Stanford in Paris center is
hardly overbearing. Contrary to Matt's
commentary, the program's coordina
tors, Estelle Halevi and Cynthia Schoch,
strongly encourage student indepen
dence and require each student to com
plete an activity outside of the center.
The coordinators do indeed open bank
accounts for each student, but only
because banks do not allow foreigners to
open accounts independent of an
umbrella organization. In addition, the
strict policy on class attendance results
from students' extended weekend trips
which lead to empty classrooms and
irate professors on Mondays and Fri
days. Any reference to the "fascist"
nature of the program is completely off
base.

One of the best aspects of the pro
gram is its competent administration.
Anyone who ever needs to battle French
bureaucracy [especially concerning
labor restrictions!] always appreciates
having Mme. Halevi and Mme. Schoch
in his/her corner of the ring. Both of us
continued to study in Paris during
Spring quarter and also completed
internships independent of the Stanford
center, thanks to the program's admin
istrators. Since the Stanford program
does not operate during the spring and
summer, any of the administrators'
assistance was completely voluntary and
certainly appreciated.
Both of our experiences were
extremely positive and we hope to
return to France for graduate study.
Matt Gregory's commentary denigrates
our accomplishments from the past year
and belittles a culture that we grew to
appreciate. Such an appreciation takes a
great deal of time and effort to develop,
and it is unfair to make blanket criti
cisms of the French life style after only
three weeks in the country. It is a shame
that Matt's article may have left many
people with an unfavorable impression
of the Stanford in Paris center, especial
ly since the Overseas Studies Program
works very hard to build up its reputa
tion.

the Paris center. Clearly Matt possess
es a deep misunderstanding of the
French and French culture and has
made little attempt to integrate him
self into French society. Like most
things in life, the Stanford program in
Paris is what you make of it, and with
out leaving the security of the Stanford
center and the Ecole Superieure de
Commerce de Paris [ESCP], any stu
dent's experience will remain limited.
To continue with your own analogy,
Matt, it is time to leave the playground
and go play with the big kids! Parisian
life varies greatly from life on the
Farm and should not be belittled for its
differences.
In order to appreciate these cultural
differences, Stanford offers students the
opportunity to live with French fami
lies. Unlike Matt's account, this experi
ence is not mere maid service during
which students are waited on hand and
foot, but a unique chance to participate
in everyday family life. Most families
truly enjoy hosting Stanford students
and go out of their way to enrich the
students' experiences. If the family vol
unteers to help someone with his/her
laundry or feed him/her on the week-

ends, this offer is purely a gesture of
goodwill; the families are not bound by
their contract to do so.
Since the host families do not feed
students on weekends or at lunch
because of logistical difficulties, the
Stanford program steps in to make up
the difference. Although students
receive 40 francs for each meal, this
hardly constitutes an exorbitant sum,
considering that a cup of hot chocolate
in France costs 20 francs, a sandwich
costs 25 francs, and a can of Coca-Cola
costs 10 francs. A simple meal in the
average restaurant costs about 80
francs. Some students may save a few
centimes by buying food in bulk at the
grocery store, but most treat the meal
allowance as part of their cultural expe
rience, and therefore choose to sample
French cuisine.
Adapting to the French university
system constitutes another part of the
cultural experience. In order to do so,
one must realize that the ESCP does not
represent till universities; just like
American universities, each French
school has its own distinctive character.
Before making any wild generalizations,
Matt should attend courses at other
institutions, like Sciences-Po, l'Ecole du
Louvre, or Paris VII in order to better
understand French student life and ped
agogy. The courses offered at Sciences-
Po, for example, are more intense than
many Stanford courses, and Sciences-Po
students certainly care about more than

just their next cigarette.
The classes at the Stanford in Paris
center parallel typical French universi
ty courses. Professors expect the same
respect and commitment from Stan
ford students that they typically find
in their French classrooms, but they
often go unappreciated by Stanford
students. For example, Matt finds
fault with the French lack of tolerance
for eating in public. The French, how
ever, believe that eating should occur
only during mealtimes and only in
appropriate places; eating in class
shows disrespect for the professor, not
only in France but also in the United
States.
Although such constraints often seem
parental, the Stanford in Paris center is
hardly overbearing. Contrary to Matt's
commentary, the program's coordina
tors, Estelle Halevi and Cynthia Schoch,
strongly encourage student indepen
dence and require each student to com
plete an activity outside of the center.
The coordinators do indeed open bank
accounts for each student, but only
because banks do not allow foreigners to
open accounts independent of an
umbrella organization. In addition, the
strict policy on class attendance results
from students' extended weekend trips
which lead to empty classrooms and
irate professors on Mondays and Fri
days. Any reference to the "fascist"
nature of the program is completely off
base.

One of the best aspects of the pro
gram is its competent administration.
Anyone who ever needs to battle French
bureaucracy [especially concerning
labor restrictions!] always appreciates
having Mme. Halevi and Mme. Schoch
in his/her corner of the ring. Both of us
continued to study in Paris during
Spring quarter and also completed
internships independent of the Stanford
center, thanks to the program's admin
istrators. Since the Stanford program
does not operate during the spring and
summer, any of the administrators'
assistance was completely voluntary and
certainly appreciated.
Both of our experiences were
extremely positive and we hope to
return to France for graduate study.
Matt Gregory's commentary denigrates
our accomplishments from the past year
and belittles a culture that we grew to
appreciate. Such an appreciation takes a
great deal of time and effort to develop,
and it is unfair to make blanket criti
cisms of the French life style after only
three weeks in the country. It is a shame
that Matt's article may have left many
people with an unfavorable impression
of the Stanford in Paris center, especial
ly since the Overseas Studies Program
works very hard to build up its reputa
tion.
