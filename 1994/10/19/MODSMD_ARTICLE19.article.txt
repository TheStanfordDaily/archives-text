# Physics Chair clarifies New Jersey comparison

### 
The letter in Monday's Daily regard
ing my clever comparison of the Physics
Tank to New Jersey is but one of the
indignant cries of protest I have received
for making an obvious analogy. Sid

Drell, Deputy Director of SLAC, is also a
New Jersey native, and was "Steaming
with resentment at [my] odious compari
son ... Thus, I write to set the record
straight.
I spent 15 happy years in New Jer
sey, and enjoyed the seasons, the fall
colors and even red foxes sunning them
selves in my rock garden on lazy Sunday
afternoons. I loved New Jersey! But I

also love the Tank. As a Stanford pro
fessor, I have had the opportunity to
teach nearly one in every five under
graduates about physics there, inspiring
at least a few. It is a place filled with
happy memories, and will indeed be
missed, at least as much as I miss the
red foxes.
