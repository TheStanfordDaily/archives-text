# Discussing Chicano Studies
## Committee listens to show of support for new major 
### Shirley Park Staff writer 
The possible creation of a Chi
cano Studies major and minor
gathered vigorous support from
those attending a community
meeting last night at El Centro
Chicano.
The meeting was the first of
two open forums held by the Chi
cano Studies Committee to garner
feedback from the community
about a Chicano Studies program.
"We haven't eliminated any
possibilities yet," said Committee
Chair Ramon Saldivar, the associ-

ate dean of un
dergraduate edu
cation. "We're
still thinking
broadly."
The commit
tee, which was
formed in re
sponse to last
spring's student
hunger strike, is

working to finish an advisory re
port to be submitted to the Uni
versity by Thanksgiving.
At the meeting, the committee
actively encouraged listeners to
air questions, concerns and sug

gestions on how to shape a vision
of Chicano Studies at Stanford
which would not simply duplicate
previous efforts, but would be
"cutting edge," Saldfvar said.
"We're here tonight to listen,"
he added.
Students reached the clearest
consensus in support of a Chicano
Studies major and minor, which
they said is both practical and in
demand.
A student with a Chicano Stud
ies degree would have the neces
sary background to work with the
