# Discussing Chicano Studies
## Committee listens to show of support for new major 
### Shirley Park Staff writer 
The possible creation of a Chi
cano Studies major and minor
gathered vigorous support from
those attending a community
meeting last night at El Centro
Chicano.
The meeting was the first of
two open forums held by the Chi
cano Studies Committee to garner
feedback from the community
about a Chicano Studies program.
"We haven't eliminated any
possibilities yet," said Committee
Chair Ramon Saldivar, the associ-

ate dean of un
dergraduate edu
cation. "We're
still thinking
broadly."
The commit
tee, which was
formed in re
sponse to last
spring's student
hunger strike, is

working to finish an advisory re
port to be submitted to the Uni
versity by Thanksgiving.
At the meeting, the committee
actively encouraged listeners to
air questions, concerns and sug

gestions on how to shape a vision
of Chicano Studies at Stanford
which would not simply duplicate
previous efforts, but would be
"cutting edge," Saldfvar said.
"We're here tonight to listen,"
he added.
Students reached the clearest
consensus in support of a Chicano
Studies major and minor, which
they said is both practical and in
demand.
A student with a Chicano Stud
ies degree would have the neces
sary background to work with the


Saldivar
large numbers of Chicanos in Cal
ifornia, said sophomore Cecilia
Tavera.
Another student asserted that
there does exist a demand for a
Chicano Studies major, and that
many of those who want to study
the area are mooring in other dis
ciplines such as American Stud
ies.
Saldfvar confirmed that about
half of Stanford's American Stud
ies majors choose a concentration
in ethnic studies.
Other students expressed the
importance of knowing about
their history and background
before going forth to help their
communities.
Saldfvar said, however, that
the extensive research he and
Modern Thought and Literature
graduate student Alicia Camacho
did over the summer showed that
a central department is not neces
sarily a precondition to a success
ful program.
Meeting participants also dis
cussed the pros and cons of sup
porting a comparative versus a
more focused approach to Chi
cano Studies, or possibly integrat
ing the two.
Political Science Prof. Luis
Fraga, chair of the Grape Policy

Committee, said a comparative
aspect would broaden and enrich
learning because "the reality
we're describing is more complex
than what one area of studies
would allow."
Although those in attendance
knew why they wanted a Chicano
Studies program, some were
uncertain what would happen if
the program were established.
"Are we setting ourselves up
for failure?" questioned Gloria
Rodriguez, a graduate student in
the School of Education.
Fraga conceded that adminis
trative duties would naturally fol
low the creation of a Chicano
Studies program, meaning the
small staff would have to stretch
themselves further.
The second open forum meet
ing will be held in the beginning
of November, by which time the
committee will have more con
crete proposals, Saldfvar said.
Subcommittee reports will be
synthesized and given to John
Shoven, dean of the School of
Humanities and Sciences, by
Thanksgiving break.
Interested non-committee
members can join a new study
group which will meet next
Wednesday. The group will dis
cuss specific readings extracted
from the research data compiled
last summer, according to sopho
more Lubia Sanchez, a student
committee representative.
