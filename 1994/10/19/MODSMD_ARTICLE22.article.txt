## The 						direction of progress 
### 
A FEW DAYS ago, a friend shared
with me a letter she had recently
received from a former student. It
was a thank-you letter, expressing the
woman's gratitude to a few individuals
who had given her, as she put it, "a little
hope that maybe there were some Stan
ford students who could still remember
how to listen." The woman's poignant
recollection of "the miracle" she had wit
nessed moved me deeply; it also terrified
me. For where are we when the event of
listening becomes something miracu
lous?
In my last piece I addressed the need
for us to speak out about the things that
we believe in. But first we must listen, to
ourselves and to those who have softer
voices, and then ask ourselves what
issues demand our serious attention. For
me, it appears that we should not choose
to work at questions that are predictable.
Instead, we must look for questions that
incite our passions, questions that may at
first appear unnecessary or unpopular
but which, I think, ultimately reveal the
potential for bringing some sort of good
ness into the world.
As I understand it, the university sys
tem was initially designed to serve this
purpose, functioning as a forum for ques
tioning, discovery and the development of
worthwhile principles. But as I look
through current reading lists and schol
arly journals, I am overwhelmed by a
sense that these topics are not progres

sive, only new, often to the point of
obscurity and personal irrelevance.
It is true that we all begin our intellec
tual journeys from different starting
points. But in my mind, progress is not
limited to movements forward, and I
would hope that as we encounter new
topics we also take steps toward discover
ing (or rediscovering) not simply what is
new, but what is best. If we devote our
selves solely to topical mastery, asking
broad, sweeping questions in the vain
hope of covering the ever-expanding pro
cession of "new ideas," the losses we will
bear in terms of original thinking will be
very great indeed.
Original thinking, as I see it, grows
from a sense of personal involvement
with the subject at hand. We must feel
that our work matters. But in my cur
rent surroundings, I do not hear these
types of deep and introspective questions
asked often enough to denote any real
progress. Instead I find theories about
theories. I find politicized readings and
academic fads. I find colleagues who
choose to believe that we have no choic
es, tacitly accepting school as a place to
pay our dues. They work at subjects that
are boring and unrewarding in the hopes
of some future pay-off, or because some
one else told them it was the right thing
to do.
Perhaps accordingly, I also find stu
dents and teachers who fail to treat each
other consistently and with respect. If we

continue to go on about our academic
lives with this lack of consideration, we
will soon find ourselves not in a universi
ty, but in a fixed and pointless environ
ment where intellectual arrogance has
dissolved the richness of the learning
experience, leaving students and teachers
alike with nothing more than a simple
(and expensive) exercise.
Saul Bellow once remarked that he did
not intend to allow his surroundings to
determine the course of his life. He
refused to believe the old adage, "Tell me
where you come from and I will tell you
what you are." Similarly, I refuse to
believe that most students, because they
are at Stanford, are incapable of listening
or of making themselves vulnerable to
transformative ideas. But should we
decide that the dissolution we see before
us is not something we want, then we
have to have confidence in our own abili
ty to change.
We have to stop this game of mental
one-upmanship and start listening to
each other's personal questions and eval
uations, and let them lead us toward
something better. I am tired of this
game. And from what I hear, I am not
alone.
