## Secret to modern human behavior buried in earth Excavations yield clues to mankind's ancestors 
### Gian Luca Signorelli 
While foraging for food in 40,000 8.C.,
a Neanderthal man may have encoun
tered a strangely-familiar creature that
walked on two legs, had a high forehead
and a prominent chin. The Neanderthal
should have resented this intrusion into
his territory — for the emergence of this
new species, modern man, signaled the
demise of aboriginal humans.
Remains of Neanderthal and modern
man indicate that they coexisted, opening
the possibility for the scene described
above. Anthropologists, however, are
uncertain about the origins of modern
man given the widespread similarity of
humans across the globe.
Stanford Anthropology Professor
Richard Klein is investigating this puzzle

at an archaeological site in South Africa.
For the last several summers he has
made an annual two-month trip to a site
known as Die Keldeis, located 80 miles
southeast of Capetown, South Africa.
Here Klein studies artifacts of pre-mod
ern people to understand how they lived
before milking the transition to modern
behavior
Funded by the National Science Foun
dation, the dig operates in tandem with
SUNY at Stonybrook and the state uni
versity at Capetown. The site consists of
two caves thought to be from 60,000 to
80,000 years old. Although the people
who lived there were anatomically mod
ern, they had very simple technology.
Klein typically finds quartzite flakes,
fire pits and the bones of animals eaten
by the hunter-gatherer clan. These arti-

facts yield clues to the ancient
people's lifestyle. In addition,
other researchers are studying
the climate of that time. The peri
od under investigation occurred
early in the last Ice Age.
Klein will study the Die
Keldeis site for two or three more
years before starting excavation
at a site 30 miles north of
Capetown. The area marked for
future study is estimated to be
between 200,000 and 300,000
years old.
As is the case with most
archaeological digs, Klein expects
to make continued incremental
progress in the field. Information
gained at each additional site may
help anthropologists to solve the
puzzle of modern human origins.
Currently there are several

theories to explain
the march of humani
ty across the globe.
The spread-and
replacement theory
posits that modern
humans emerged
roughly 50,000 years
ago, possibly near
present-day Ethiopia.
Because of their
greater sophistication
relative to other early
humans, modern
humanity's ancestors
were able to move
across the continents.
They eventually
inhabited all but the
most brutal environ
ments and drove
indigenous peoples to
extinction.
There is another
theory of human ori-

gins in which people in Africa, Asia and
Europe evolved separately, but it is less
likely. Klein believes that there is more
than a 50 percent chance that the spread
and-replacement theory is correct.
He bases his opinion of the greater
likelihood of the former theory on the
genetic similarities among the current
human population. Evidence from arti
facts also provides a foundation for
Klein's opinions about ancient human
behavior.
Klein is chiefly interested in using
artifacts to illuminate human behavior.
"A hundred thousand years ago people
became biologically modern, but it was
only 50,000 years ago that we became

behaviorally modern," Klein said. It is
this transition that marks the true begin
ning of modern man.
How people made this last critical
advance remains unclear. Some argue
that the transformation resulted from a
change in social structures, such as the
creation of the family unit or closer clan
identification and organization.
Klein disagrees with this idea. "My
main objection to this theory is that it
does not explain why the transformation
took place. I find it more likely that a
mutation, a neurological mutation, was
the cause," Klein said. "Human evolution
has seen a continual improvement in our
brains, so it is not unlikely that the final

step took place in the brain."
He acknowledges, however, that this
theory is hard to prove, for the remains of
human skulls alone reveal little about the
organization of the brain.
Regardless of the reason for it, the
transformation to modernity produced a
stunning growth in human culture. Peo
ple suddenly started crafting specialized
tools — using new materials like bone
and ivory for carving — erecting well
built structures and even creating art in
the form of ornamental beads and stat
uettes.
Thus, anthropologists can study how

these cultural advances spread
tracing their path from Africa tc
the Near East, to Eastern Europe
and to Western Europe, then tc
Russia and beyond.
The archaeological record is
still full of holes. Many areas in
Asia, Africa and Eastern Europe
have yet to be explored by anthro
pologists, and many of the discov

ered sites have not been reliably
excavated and dated. >
Although a great deal of hard
work is needed, the advent of new
dating techniques like thermolu
minescence facilitates the tasks
of excavation. The new technique
promises to be particularly useful
where older techniques such as
carbon-dating fall short.
"Carbon-dating is only reli
able roughly to 30,000 years,"
Klein said. "Even so, it can be
inconsistent because of con
tamination from the surround

ing soil. Thermoluminescence
doesn't have these drawbacks,"
he added.
Thermoluminescence dates
objects that were put in the fire
by early people. The electrons
trapped in the crystal matrix of
a tool like a flint are freed by the
heat, until there are no elec
trons left. The heated flint is
subject to radioactivity, in the
form of electrons, from isotopes
in the material and in the sur
rounding soil.
The half-lives of the isotopes in

the heated material indicate how
many electrons should be present
from radioactive decay. Since elec
trons not due to radioactive decay
were driven off by heat, those
remaining in the flint must be
from the decay; they indicate the
age of the material.
Klein described plans to devel
op a new program for human evo
lution within the Anthropology
and Human Biology Depart

effort.

uncertain about the origins of modern
man given the widespread similarity of
humans across the globe.
Stanford Anthropology Professor
Richard Klein is investigating this puzzle

at an archaeological site in South Africa.
For the last several summers he has
made an annual two-month trip to a site
known as Die Keldeis, located 80 miles
southeast of Capetown, South Africa.
Here Klein studies artifacts of pre-mod
ern people to understand how they lived
before milking the transition to modern
behavior
Funded by the National Science Foun
dation, the dig operates in tandem with
SUNY at Stonybrook and the state uni
versity at Capetown. The site consists of
two caves thought to be from 60,000 to
80,000 years old. Although the people
who lived there were anatomically mod
ern, they had very simple technology.
Klein typically finds quartzite flakes,
fire pits and the bones of animals eaten
by the hunter-gatherer clan. These arti-

facts yield clues to the ancient
people's lifestyle. In addition,
other researchers are studying
the climate of that time. The peri
od under investigation occurred
early in the last Ice Age.
Klein will study the Die
Keldeis site for two or three more
years before starting excavation
at a site 30 miles north of
Capetown. The area marked for
future study is estimated to be
between 200,000 and 300,000
years old.
As is the case with most
archaeological digs, Klein expects
to make continued incremental
progress in the field. Information
gained at each additional site may
help anthropologists to solve the
puzzle of modern human origins.
Currently there are several

theories to explain
the march of humani
ty across the globe.
The spread-and
replacement theory
posits that modern
humans emerged
roughly 50,000 years
ago, possibly near
present-day Ethiopia.
Because of their
greater sophistication
relative to other early
humans, modern
humanity's ancestors
were able to move
across the continents.
They eventually
inhabited all but the
most brutal environ
ments and drove
indigenous peoples to
extinction.
There is another
theory of human ori-

gins in which people in Africa, Asia and
Europe evolved separately, but it is less
likely. Klein believes that there is more
than a 50 percent chance that the spread
and-replacement theory is correct.
He bases his opinion of the greater
likelihood of the former theory on the
genetic similarities among the current
human population. Evidence from arti
facts also provides a foundation for
Klein's opinions about ancient human
behavior.
Klein is chiefly interested in using
artifacts to illuminate human behavior.
"A hundred thousand years ago people
became biologically modern, but it was
only 50,000 years ago that we became

behaviorally modern," Klein said. It is
this transition that marks the true begin
ning of modern man.
How people made this last critical
advance remains unclear. Some argue
that the transformation resulted from a
change in social structures, such as the
creation of the family unit or closer clan
identification and organization.
Klein disagrees with this idea. "My
main objection to this theory is that it
does not explain why the transformation
took place. I find it more likely that a
mutation, a neurological mutation, was
the cause," Klein said. "Human evolution
has seen a continual improvement in our
brains, so it is not unlikely that the final

step took place in the brain."
He acknowledges, however, that this
theory is hard to prove, for the remains of
human skulls alone reveal little about the
organization of the brain.
Regardless of the reason for it, the
transformation to modernity produced a
stunning growth in human culture. Peo
ple suddenly started crafting specialized
tools — using new materials like bone
and ivory for carving — erecting well
built structures and even creating art in
the form of ornamental beads and stat
uettes.
Thus, anthropologists can study how

these cultural advances spread
tracing their path from Africa tc
the Near East, to Eastern Europe
and to Western Europe, then tc
Russia and beyond.
The archaeological record is
still full of holes. Many areas in
Asia, Africa and Eastern Europe
have yet to be explored by anthro
pologists, and many of the discov

ered sites have not been reliably
excavated and dated. >
Although a great deal of hard
work is needed, the advent of new
dating techniques like thermolu
minescence facilitates the tasks
of excavation. The new technique
promises to be particularly useful
where older techniques such as
carbon-dating fall short.
"Carbon-dating is only reli
able roughly to 30,000 years,"
Klein said. "Even so, it can be
inconsistent because of con
tamination from the surround

ing soil. Thermoluminescence
doesn't have these drawbacks,"
he added.
Thermoluminescence dates
objects that were put in the fire
by early people. The electrons
trapped in the crystal matrix of
a tool like a flint are freed by the
heat, until there are no elec
trons left. The heated flint is
subject to radioactivity, in the
form of electrons, from isotopes
in the material and in the sur
rounding soil.
The half-lives of the isotopes in

the heated material indicate how
many electrons should be present
from radioactive decay. Since elec
trons not due to radioactive decay
were driven off by heat, those
remaining in the flint must be
from the decay; they indicate the
age of the material.
Klein described plans to devel
op a new program for human evo
lution within the Anthropology
and Human Biology Depart
ments. He is currently recruiting
researchers to join him in this
effort.
While foraging for food in 40,000 8.C.,
a Neanderthal man may have encoun
tered a strangely-familiar creature that
walked on two legs, had a high forehead
and a prominent chin. The Neanderthal
should have resented this intrusion into
his territory — for the emergence of this
new species, modern man, signaled the
demise of aboriginal humans.
Remains of Neanderthal and modern
man indicate that they coexisted, opening
the possibility for the scene described
above. Anthropologists, however, are
uncertain about the origins of modern
man given the widespread similarity of
humans across the globe.
