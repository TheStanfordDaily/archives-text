## Secret to modern human behavior buried in earth Excavations yield clues to mankind's ancestors 
### Gian Luca Signorelli 
While foraging for food in 40,000 8.C.,
a Neanderthal man may have encoun
tered a strangely-familiar creature that
walked on two legs, had a high forehead
and a prominent chin. The Neanderthal
should have resented this intrusion into
his territory — for the emergence of this
new species, modern man, signaled the
demise of aboriginal humans.
Remains of Neanderthal and modern
man indicate that they coexisted, opening
the possibility for the scene described
above. Anthropologists, however, are
uncertain about the origins of modern
man given the widespread similarity of
humans across the globe.
Stanford Anthropology Professor
Richard Klein is investigating this puzzle

at an archaeological site in South Africa.
For the last several summers he has
made an annual two-month trip to a site
known as Die Keldeis, located 80 miles
southeast of Capetown, South Africa.
Here Klein studies artifacts of pre-mod
ern people to understand how they lived
before milking the transition to modern
behavior
Funded by the National Science Foun
dation, the dig operates in tandem with
SUNY at Stonybrook and the state uni
versity at Capetown. The site consists of
two caves thought to be from 60,000 to
80,000 years old. Although the people
who lived there were anatomically mod
ern, they had very simple technology.
Klein typically finds quartzite flakes,
fire pits and the bones of animals eaten
by the hunter-gatherer clan. These arti-

facts yield clues to the ancient
people's lifestyle. In addition,
other researchers are studying
the climate of that time. The peri
od under investigation occurred
early in the last Ice Age.
Klein will study the Die
Keldeis site for two or three more
years before starting excavation
at a site 30 miles north of
Capetown. The area marked for
future study is estimated to be
between 200,000 and 300,000
years old.
As is the case with most
archaeological digs, Klein expects
to make continued incremental
progress in the field. Information
gained at each additional site may
help anthropologists to solve the
puzzle of modern human origins.
Currently there are several

theories to explain
the march of humani
ty across the globe.
The spread-and
replacement theory
posits that modern
humans emerged
roughly 50,000 years
ago, possibly near
present-day Ethiopia.
Because of their
greater sophistication
relative to other early
humans, modern
humanity's ancestors
were able to move
across the continents.
They eventually
inhabited all but the
most brutal environ
ments and drove
indigenous peoples to
extinction.
There is another
theory of human ori-

gins in which people in Africa, Asia and
Europe evolved separately, but it is less
likely. Klein believes that there is more
than a 50 percent chance that the spread
and-replacement theory is correct.
He bases his opinion of the greater
likelihood of the former theory on the
genetic similarities among the current
human population. Evidence from arti
facts also provides a foundation for
Klein's opinions about ancient human
behavior.
Klein is chiefly interested in using
artifacts to illuminate human behavior.
"A hundred thousand years ago people
became biologically modern, but it was
only 50,000 years ago that we became

behaviorally modern," Klein said. It is
this transition that marks the true begin
ning of modern man.
How people made this last critical
advance remains unclear. Some argue
that the transformation resulted from a
change in social structures, such as the
creation of the family unit or closer clan
identification and organization.
Klein disagrees with this idea. "My
main objection to this theory is that it
does not explain why the transformation
took place. I find it more likely that a
mutation, a neurological mutation, was
the cause," Klein said. "Human evolution
has seen a continual improvement in our
brains, so it is not unlikely that the final

step took place in the brain."
He acknowledges, however, that this
theory is hard to prove, for the remains of
human skulls alone reveal little about the
organization of the brain.
Regardless of the reason for it, the
transformation to modernity produced a
stunning growth in human culture. Peo
ple suddenly started crafting specialized
tools — using new materials like bone
and ivory for carving — erecting well
built structures and even creating art in
the form of ornamental beads and stat
uettes.
Thus, anthropologists can study how
