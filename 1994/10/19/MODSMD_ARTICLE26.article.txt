# New Sondius trademark indicates high quality music technology
## Researchers develop sound synthesis 
### Bryan Sun 
If you had two tape decks and they sold for
$155 and $154, and the one for $155 had
Dolby written on it, which one would you buy?
Joe Koepnick, senior associate at Stanford's
Office of Technology Licensing, is betting the
future of his pet trademark program, Sondius,
on this one-name one dollar difference. His pro
gram aims to help consumers separate the good
sound products from the best
Sondius is a sound-quality trademark, in
the same manner that Nike is a trademark for
the athletic shoe market. "It's intended to be
quality approval," Koepnick explained.
"[Sondius] represents a sound product, pro
audio equipment, a game product or almost
anything that represents the state of the art,
best available sound synthesis of the time."
Sondius will help market Stanford inven
tions exclusively, at least in the beginning.
Koepnick believes the link to Stanford Univer
sity will help the trademark earn respect.
"People pay attention a lot to things that
are associated with Stanford," he said. Many
of the Sondius technologies developed at Stan
ford represent the cutting edge of sound syn
thesis, Koepnick added.
Among these inventions is an algorithm
that separates a sound mixture of voices and
musical instruments. Avery Wang, a recent
Ph.D. graduate in the Electrical Engineering
Department, conceived the idea. The algo
rithm uses pitch-tracking and harmonics to
attract different elements in a musical presen
tation, effectively pulling them apart.
"[The algorithm] has lots of applications,"
Wang said. "You could use it for the restoration
of music or in speech compression. You could
sing into a microphone and it would send a com
mand to a synthesizer to play that note, so you
could imagine playing a trombone by singing

into a microphone."
Wang noted a future use for the algorithm
in automatic music transcription; this technol
ogy is still in the early stages of development.
Musicians could theoretically play a piece of
music on speakers, and the algorithm would
separate the instruments and voices, then
transcribe the music into musical notes on
paper.
Other work in musical technology will
appear with the Sondius trademark. Julius
Smith, associate professor at the Center for
Computer Research in Music and Acoustics
(CCRMA) also developed technology under
the Sondius trademark.
His chief invention, called 'waveguide syn
thesis,' has raised the eyebrows of musicians
nationwide and has been recognized in publi
cations such as Billboard magazine and Busi
ness Week.
Waveguide synthesis uses physical model
ing to reproduce the sound of a musical instru
ment. The algorithms analyze the physical
properties of an instrument such as the damp
ing in a violin string or the flare at the end of
a horn.
The technology is based on a true physical
model which gives more performance expres
siveness than many traditional techniques. In
the past, techniques such as "sampling" limit
ed the subtleties of the playback sound.
Sampling techniques require a full digital
copy of the actual sound, which becomes very
space-intensive with long stretches of sound.
According to Smith, waveguide overcomes
many of these barriers and complements the
capabilities of sampling.
"Beyond the main parameters, there are
subtle squeaks and articulation effects, for
example in the saxophone, which are simply
too complex to catalog in a sample library,"
Smith explained.

Because waveguide technology is unlimited
by physical constraints, musicians can even
create sounds from virtual instruments.
"Unlike real instruments,.. . these models
can be extended beyond physical reality to
yield new classes of instruments and sounds,
like a bowed Golden Gate bridge, or a hybrid
between a piano and a clarinet," said Perry
Cook, a former graduate student working with
Smith on waveguide technology.
Smith's waveguide synthesis patent has
already been licensed to Yamaha Corporation,
which has recently released synthesizers
based on the waveguide synthesis principle.
Yamaha looks to use the technology in other
future products.
Wang, Smith, and Cook are only three of a
handful of researchers whose work may even
tually appear under a Sondius trademark. At
CCRMA there are 12 Ph.D. students and three
faculty members working on technologies
which could eventually be marketed under
Sondius.
Today, with Koepnick as one of the pro
gram's leaders, Sondius prepares to introduce
itself into the emerging world of multimedia.
Sondius is a patent-independent royalty; the
Sondius name will generate royalties for Stan
ford even after the 17-year patents expire.
OTL's second most lucrative patent is FM
synthesis, invented by Stanford music profes
sor John Chowning. The patent, which has
earned over $20 million, expired last April,
prompting OTL to develop a new revenue-gen
erating program.
Though the inventors of Sondius technolo
gies do not receive any funds from the Sondius
trademark and gain only a partial share from
direct patent royalties, they still believe that
working under Sondius produces many bene-
fits.
"The main benefits of the
Sondius program for inventors
are increased likelihood of
research output finding its way
into commercial products and
support for the development of
infrastructure such as the rapid
prototyping tools we need for our
ongoing research," Smith said.

With many technologies lined
up under the Sondius venture,
Koepnick feels optimistic about
its chances for success.
"If a patent brings in $100,000
a year, it's in a class all of its
own," he said. "It's a success."
With a lot of energy and inter
est behind the program, Sondius
developers aim higher than that.
"Dolby brings in about $15 mil
lion a year with about $2 million,
in expenses. We're looking for a
similar ratio by the late 19905,"
Koepnick added.
