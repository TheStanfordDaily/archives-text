Q"What is that gnarly
watery stuff that comes to
the top of a yogurt container?
Can I eat it?"
— anonymous
A No, it isn't some toxic by
product of yogurt bacteria
gone out of control, and it's not
just water. It's whey, the very
stuff that Miss Muffet was eat
ing with curds before her
arachnophobic encounter. (No
way! Whey.)
Of course, that leads to the
obvious question, what are
curds and whey? This goes to
the basis of yogurt-making.
The process starts with milk,
which contains lots of protein,
some fat, water, sugar and var-

ious minerals. The
addition of growing
bacteria that excrete
chemicals make the
proteins in the milk
coagulate, or clump
together. They usually
do this by changing the
pH, or acidity, of the
solution. This alters
the physical properties
of the proteins, such as
shape and intermolec
ular attractions.
These solid clumps of
protein are the curds;
they're what make up

the little lumps in cottage
cheese. As they form, you get the
watery parts of the milk leftover.
This is the whey, and it consists
mostly of the water, sugar and
minerals. The fat tends to get
trapped in with the protein.
You can actually see this
process in the comfort of your
own kitchen. (And you don't
even need adult supervision).
Just heat some milk up to boil
ing and add a few drops of
lemon juice. All of the sudden
you'll get big white lumps, and
the rest of the milk will turn
clear. If you strain out these
lumps and dry them, you'll end
up with cheese. (Cheese is basi
cally just dried-out curds,
pressed into a solid block).
In yogurt, the curds and
whey are blended back together
to get the smooth consistency.

However, over time,
the whey tends to sep
arate out and come up
to the top. So just go
ahead and stir it back
in . . . It's good for
you.
