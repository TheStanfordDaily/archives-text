Q"What is that gnarly
watery stuff that comes to
the top of a yogurt container?
Can I eat it?"
— anonymous
A No, it isn't some toxic by
product of yogurt bacteria
gone out of control, and it's not
just water. It's whey, the very
stuff that Miss Muffet was eat
ing with curds before her
arachnophobic encounter. (No
way! Whey.)
Of course, that leads to the
obvious question, what are
curds and whey? This goes to
the basis of yogurt-making.
The process starts with milk,
which contains lots of protein,
some fat, water, sugar and var-

ious minerals. The
addition of growing
bacteria that excrete
chemicals make the
proteins in the milk
coagulate, or clump
together. They usually
do this by changing the
pH, or acidity, of the
solution. This alters
the physical properties
of the proteins, such as
shape and intermolec
ular attractions.
These solid clumps of
protein are the curds;
they're what make up

the little lumps in cottage
cheese. As they form, you get the
watery parts of the milk leftover.
This is the whey, and it consists
mostly of the water, sugar and
minerals. The fat tends to get
trapped in with the protein.
You can actually see this
process in the comfort of your
own kitchen. (And you don't
even need adult supervision).
Just heat some milk up to boil
ing and add a few drops of
lemon juice. All of the sudden
you'll get big white lumps, and
the rest of the milk will turn
clear. If you strain out these
lumps and dry them, you'll end
up with cheese. (Cheese is basi
cally just dried-out curds,
pressed into a solid block).
In yogurt, the curds and
whey are blended back together
to get the smooth consistency.

However, over time,
the whey tends to sep
arate out and come up
to the top. So just go
ahead and stir it back
in . . . It's good for
you.
Q"Why does bread
%et hard when it
goes stale, but crack
ers and chips get
soft?"
— baking in Columbae


The Science
Bug
A Well, there's a simple
answer to this, which I'll
give you. But I'll also give
you a lot of extra information
that you may not care about, so if
you're in hurry, you can stop
reading after the next paragraph.
The basic answer is that they
both end up with about the same
moisture. However, bread starts
out with lot more moisture than
crackers, so it has to get drier to
reach the middle point, while
crackers have to gain moisture to
reach the same point.
Most bread starts off with
about 32 to 38 percent moisture.
If you leave it sitting out, the
moisture evaporates. Once
there's about 14 percent moisture
left, most people would consider
it stale.
On the other hand, crackers
and chips usually have only two
to five percent moisture. As
they sit out, moisture from the
air is absorbed, and by the time
they have about nine percent
moisture, the average person
would say they're too soft to
eat.
So stale crackers can actually
have less moisture than stale
bread, but be considered soft,
while stale bread can have more
moisture but be considered hard.

The difference is just how you
expect them to be.
While you're chewing on that,
another interesting fact is that
bread is usually baked so that the
crust is drier than the rest of the
bread, which is technically
known as the "crumb portion.'
As the bread goes stale, the mois
ture that leaves the crumb
migrates to the crust, so the
crust will actually soften as the
inside gets harder.
However, there are more sub
tle details in the staling process.
Crackers are simple; they absorb
water from the air without any
molecular changes. On the other
hand, bread doesn't just dry out.
Going stale is technically called
"retrogradation" and actually
involves crystallization of the
starch molecules as water leaves
the bread. There are also con
stituents of the bread that keep
the bread fresh longer, such as
certain enzymes and glycerides
that can slow down the crystal
lization process.
The entire molecular basis
of baking bread and going stale
is still not really understood
by food technologists. So if
you're looking for a good hon
ors thesis project, maybe you
should try a few slices, I mean
experiments, with fresh baked
bread.
