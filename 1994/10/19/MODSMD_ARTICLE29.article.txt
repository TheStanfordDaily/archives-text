# Computer imaging generates architecture models
## 3-D 'blueprints' simplify construction

Imagine walking through a multi
million dollar building site and realizing
that a crucial detail has been over
looked. Fixing the problem will cost tens
of thousands of dollars. Unfortunately,
there is nothing the contractor can do
except pay for it and try not to make the
same mistake again.
Until now.
Stanford researchers at the Center
for Integrated Facilities Engineering
(CIFE) are working to change this.
Together with Dillingham Construction
Co., they are working to develop a com
puter modeling system for construction
projects which will allow contractors
and clients to view plans in full three
dimensional detail.
At present, plans for a construction
site may include as many as six different
documents, all of which must be consis
tent if the project is to be successful.
The Stanford project combines all of
these two-dimensional representations
into a single visual model which can

then be checked for accuracy.
These techniques are being tested at
the San Mateo County Health Center
during a six-year remodeling project. The
need to keep construction from interfer
ing with the Center's everyday activities
makes detailed, accurate plans even
more important than on a typical site.
Dillingham first approached the
researchers at CIFE when they under
took the project. According to graduate
student Eric Collier, who worked exten
sively on the project over the last year,
the company has expressed interest in
CIFE for a number of years. Dillingham
feels that this technology will be more
and more a part of the future.
Several immediate benefits have
already resulted from Dillingham's use of
the computer model. When compiling the
model data, Collier discovered an incon
sistency between two of the original docu
ments. The error could have cost thou
sands of dollars if it had not been caught.
Project manager George Hurley
explained that by using a three-dimen
sional model of the hospital, Dillingham
was able to help the client better under

stand the total ramifications of a very
complex operation. Each hospital
employee can see clearly the impact of
the construction on his or her daily rou
tine for the next six years.
The model also clearly indicates the
'critical path' of construction. These criti
cal elements are pieces of the project that
would upset the entire project if they were
delayed. Concrete footings, for example,
must be poured before heavy machinery
can be installed on top of them. The fin
ishing touches on one building, on the
other hand, can be done at the same time
that construction starts on another.
Being able to view all phases of the
critical path simplifies the process of
dealing with delays. "Clear, visual feed
back of the critical path allows quick
response with the recovery schedule,"
Hurley said.
Compiled from the conventional two
dimensional drawing used in construc
tion, computer models are currently
used as tools to supplement explanations
rather than as tools for daily work or
