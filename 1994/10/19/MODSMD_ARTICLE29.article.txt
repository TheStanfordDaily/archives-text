# Computer imaging generates architecture models
## 3-D 'blueprints' simplify construction 
### Bryan Johnson Staff writer 
Imagine walking through a multi
million dollar building site and realizing
that a crucial detail has been over
looked. Fixing the problem will cost tens
of thousands of dollars. Unfortunately,
there is nothing the contractor can do
except pay for it and try not to make the
same mistake again.
Until now.
Stanford researchers at the Center
for Integrated Facilities Engineering
(CIFE) are working to change this.
Together with Dillingham Construction
Co., they are working to develop a com
puter modeling system for construction
projects which will allow contractors
and clients to view plans in full three
dimensional detail.
At present, plans for a construction
site may include as many as six different
documents, all of which must be consis
tent if the project is to be successful.
The Stanford project combines all of
these two-dimensional representations
into a single visual model which can

then be checked for accuracy.
These techniques are being tested at
the San Mateo County Health Center
during a six-year remodeling project. The
need to keep construction from interfer
ing with the Center's everyday activities
makes detailed, accurate plans even
more important than on a typical site.
Dillingham first approached the
researchers at CIFE when they under
took the project. According to graduate
student Eric Collier, who worked exten
sively on the project over the last year,
the company has expressed interest in
CIFE for a number of years. Dillingham
feels that this technology will be more
and more a part of the future.
Several immediate benefits have
already resulted from Dillingham's use of
the computer model. When compiling the
model data, Collier discovered an incon
sistency between two of the original docu
ments. The error could have cost thou
sands of dollars if it had not been caught.
Project manager George Hurley
explained that by using a three-dimen
sional model of the hospital, Dillingham
was able to help the client better under

stand the total ramifications of a very
complex operation. Each hospital
employee can see clearly the impact of
the construction on his or her daily rou
tine for the next six years.
The model also clearly indicates the
'critical path' of construction. These criti
cal elements are pieces of the project that
would upset the entire project if they were
delayed. Concrete footings, for example,
must be poured before heavy machinery
can be installed on top of them. The fin
ishing touches on one building, on the
other hand, can be done at the same time
that construction starts on another.
Being able to view all phases of the
critical path simplifies the process of
dealing with delays. "Clear, visual feed
back of the critical path allows quick
response with the recovery schedule,"
Hurley said.
Compiled from the conventional two
dimensional drawing used in construc
tion, computer models are currently
used as tools to supplement explanations
rather than as tools for daily work or
design. In the future, Collier
anticipates, it may be possible to
work solely with a three-dimen
sional model and eliminate
blueprints entirely.
At present, however, several
obstacles impede such a conversion.
Blueprints include a lot of details —
including finishing touches like
doorknobs or light switches —
which would greatly increase the
complexity of the model if they
were included in the simulation.
The model of the San Mateo
hospital contains 25,000 details
and is 15 megabytes in size. Doing
more basic design work with com
puter models would require a pro
hibitive increase in program size
and complexity.
One of the more promising uses
of three-dimensional modeling
under development is for video
presentations or 'walk-throughs'
that demonstrate what the build
ing will be like once it is finished.
The videos can contain much
data and run much more quickly
than the raw simulations. Eventu
ally, the models could even be used
to make video instructions for how

to get somewhere or how to repair
part of the original equipment.
Computer modeling for con
struction was originally devel
oped in the early 1980s, but has
only recently become a viable
option for most construction pro
jects. One reason for this is that
computer hardware has only
recently become fast enough to
shorten the lead time necessary to
prepare the model.
Models were originally used by
companies building large oil
refineries. These projects are cap
ital-intensive and increase the
appeal of the prospect of catching
design errors early. Much of the
modeling software in use today
was originally designed by large
companies such as Bechtel and
has only recently been more wide
ly commercially licensed.
As three-dimensional 'walk
through' programs become
increasingly popular, it is possi
ble that computer modeling will
become more a part of normal
life. Future home-buyers may
routinely tour their completed
homes before construction even
begins. Development of technolo
gy is always just a matter of peo
ple trying it to find out what
works and how they can use it,
Collier said.

Hurley said.
Compiled from the conventional two
dimensional drawing used in construc
tion, computer models are currently
used as tools to supplement explanations
rather than as tools for daily work or
design. In the future, Collier
anticipates, it may be possible to
work solely with a three-dimen
sional model and eliminate
blueprints entirely.
At present, however, several
obstacles impede such a conversion.
Blueprints include a lot of details —
including finishing touches like
doorknobs or light switches —
which would greatly increase the
complexity of the model if they
were included in the simulation.
The model of the San Mateo
hospital contains 25,000 details
and is 15 megabytes in size. Doing
more basic design work with com
puter models would require a pro
hibitive increase in program size
and complexity.
One of the more promising uses
of three-dimensional modeling
under development is for video
presentations or 'walk-throughs'
that demonstrate what the build
ing will be like once it is finished.
The videos can contain much
data and run much more quickly
than the raw simulations. Eventu
ally, the models could even be used
to make video instructions for how

to get somewhere or how to repair
part of the original equipment.
Computer modeling for con
struction was originally devel
oped in the early 1980s, but has
only recently become a viable
option for most construction pro
jects. One reason for this is that
computer hardware has only
recently become fast enough to
shorten the lead time necessary to
prepare the model.
Models were originally used by
companies building large oil
refineries. These projects are cap
ital-intensive and increase the
appeal of the prospect of catching
design errors early. Much of the
modeling software in use today
was originally designed by large
companies such as Bechtel and
has only recently been more wide
ly commercially licensed.
As three-dimensional 'walk
through' programs become
increasingly popular, it is possi
ble that computer modeling will
become more a part of normal
life. Future home-buyers may
routinely tour their completed
homes before construction even
begins. Development of technolo
gy is always just a matter of peo
ple trying it to find out what
works and how they can use it,
Collier said.
