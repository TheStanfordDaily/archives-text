# Student 'head-butted' at party
## 
### Jason Waggoner Staff writer 
A Stanford graduate student collapsed outside the
Theta Delta Chi house after a suspected gang mem
ber from East Palo Alto "head-butted" him in the
cheek at a Friday night party, Stanford Police said.
Police found the student face down a few feet away
from the house "in a semi-conscious state," said
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
Moments later, the student — who said he wished
to remain unidentified — was rushed to Stanford
University Hospital, where he was diagnosed with a
broken cheek bone.

Senior Cyd Zeigler, the Theta Delt president, said
the incident occurred sometime after 11 p.m. at the
joint Theta Delt-Kappa Kappa Gamma Oktoberfest
Party at the Theta Delt house.
"A group of high school students, some of them
wearing East Palo Alto T-shirts, came to the party,"
Zeigler said.
"They had Stanford student IDs, so no one
thought to question them," he said. "When they got
inside, they acted belligerently and started picking
fights with Theta Delts and other students."
The injured student said he was "reasonably
drunk" before the incident.
"I don't remember how many
of them there were — I just
remember that there were at least
four guys surrounding me who
appeared to be [gang members],"
he said. "One of the guys
approached me and head-butted
me. It was unprovoked. I said
nothing."
The student, bleeding and dis
oriented, stumbled out of the
house. "I made it as far as the
grass outside before my broken
bone and my intoxication got the
best of me and I fell down," he
said.
Niemeyer said no witnesses
have come forward with infor
mation about the incident, and
no suspects have been appre
hended.
"I don't blame Theta Delta Chi
for the incident but I do blame the
security guards that were hired
for the event. They sucked," the
student said.
He also said he has already
been saddled with more than
$1,000 in out-of-pocket expens

es to reconstruct his face, but
currently has no plans to take
legal action against the house
or anyone involved in the inci
dent.
Zeigler, however, said that the
Theta Delts took every precaution
necessary to assure a safe and
entertaining party.
"We have taken every securi
ty measure we could to ensure
everyone's safety at our par
ties, and we have been com
mended by the police depart
ment and the Office of Student
Activities for our efforts," he
said.
"At this party we had almost a
dozen Theta Delts acting as staff
members, roaming around or sta
tioned at exit doors and around
the dance floor, we had three
hired security guards at the main
entrance and exit, and we checked
for student IDs before letting peo
ple in," Zeigler added. "We even
escorted students back to their
dorms if they needed or wanted
that service."
Theta Delt resident assistant
Marc Fioravanti, a coterminal
student, was also concerned with
safety. "I don't know how these
high school students got Stanford
IDs."
