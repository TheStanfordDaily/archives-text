# Is Proposition 187 the right solution?
## Profs debate issues surrounding illegal immigration in Law School forum 
### Neha Gupta 
While agreeing that illegal immigration is a
problem, UC-Davis Computer Science Prof.
Norman Matloff and Stanford Law Prof. Bill
Hing debated in a Law School forum yesterday
whether the controversial Proposition 187 is
the right solution.
About 60 people attended the heated debate
on the proposition, which would prohibit ille
gal aliens from participating in state educa
tion programs and health care services.
Matloff, a self-proclaimed liberal, began the
debate — which was dominated by the issue of
education — by asserting that those who
oppose the proposition have been "distorting
things right and left. .. playing footloose with
the facts."
For the most part, he argued that while the
proposition is flawed, it is the best available
solution to the state's immigration problems.
"There is no perfect law," he said.
By taking away their educational opportu
nities and health services, potential immi
grants will be more likely to stay in their home
countries or at least send only one family
member to the U.S., Matloff said.
"Then we'll have one undocumented immi
grant instead of five," he said.
On the other side, Hing maintained that
the proposition does not provide a workable
solution to the immigration problem, claiming
that it is badly crafted and will be difficult to
carry out.
He suggested that more money be invested

in policing the border, rather
than indirectly trying to stop
immigrants from coming.
Matloff, who is a former chair
of the Affirmative Action Com
mittee at UC-Davis, said polls
show over and over again that
immigrants themselves want
legal and illegal immigration to
be reduced.
Immigration, he said, only
hurts the general population by

supplying cheap labor, while taking away
other people's jobs.
Matloff then attacked some common myths
associated with Proposition 187.
For example, he said, one of the arguments
against the proposition is that it would cause
schools to lose $15 billion in federal funding,
because it violates the Family Educational
Rights and Privacy Act, which prohibits
schools from disclosing student record infor
mation without parental consent. Matloff
pointed out, however, that legislators have
already addressed this concern. State and fed
eral governments will seek ways to avoid or at
least minimize such losses, he said.
Hing came back quickly, asserting that the
only way to minimize these losses is to change
federal law, which would create even more
problems.
"No funds will be given to any schools that
practice or have the policy of releasing 'educa
tional records' and that's what 187 does,"
Hing said.

Matloff also refuted the claim
that the proposition would mean
up to 300,000 children will be on
the streets rather than in school
— which could result in more
crime.
"This is an insult to their
parents," Matloff said. "The
parents will make sure that
their kids aren't illiterate and
will get schooling, whether that
means going back home."

Also, Matloff said, students who are undoc
umented and already attending school would
probably be "grandfathered in"and allowed to
continue their schooling. He stressed that he
was more interested in preventing illegal
immigrants from entering in the future, rather
than hurting those that are already here.
At the end of his presentation, Hing listed
several of the bill's opponents — such as the
San Francisco Police Department Chief and
the acting superintendent of California
schools — to demonstrate that members of
both parties are against the proposition.
First-year law student Mary Wu said that
having two "self-proclaimed liberals" debate
was an interesting choice.
"I can understand why the speakers stayed
away from the moral arguments on how the
proposition is just inherently discriminatory,"
Wu said.
The debate was sponsored by the Stanford
Public Interest Law Association and the Office
of Public Interest program.
