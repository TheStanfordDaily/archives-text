## Cardinal pounds Cal in three games Bears are no match for high-powered spikers

Remember the Alamo.
The California women's volleyball team (3-14)
might feel like those poor souls who lost their lives
at the famous Texas fort after last night's loss to No.
1 Stanford. The Cardinal (16-0) defeated the Bears
soundly at Harmon Arena in a short, one hour and
17 minute match (15-4, 15-6, 15-3).

California did not fare as well against Stanford on
its home court as it had at Maples Pavilion just a few
short weeks ago. On Sept. 27th, an extremely moti
vated Bear squad played possibly its best match so
far this season, as they succeeded in stealing a game
away from the vaunted Cardinal. Last night, howev
er, California only succeeded in proving that game
was a fluke.
In the opening contest, the Bears seemed to have
their hands stuck in the honey jar as they allowed
Stanford to jump out to a quick lead. Sophomore
blocker Eileen Murfee took a fantastic set from
junior Cary Wendell and hammered it into the Cali
fornia side of the net to make it 9-2. A short while
later, Murfee came through for the assist, as she set
up junior hitter Wendy Hromadka to extend the lead
to 13-2.

losing team.'

This last point seemed to finally wake up the doz
ing Bears. California then engaged Stanford in a
series of long rallies and side outs, managing to win
a couple more points, before succumbing on a block
by senior captain Anne Wicks.
The Berkeley squad put up much more of a fight in
the second game, forcing the Cardinal to work harder

don. Stanford took advantage of this problem to reg
ister four service aces en route to victory.
The Cardinal also wasted no time in taking the
third game. The closest the Bears got was at the
opening serve. Sophomore Paula McNamee, who
had just entered the match moments before, used a
Wendell set to end the Bears' hopes of a miraculous
comeback.
Stanford hit .295 for the match — right around
its season average — and held California to a .129
average, even lower than the squad's defensive aver
age. Individually, freshman Kristen Folkl, who did
not play in the first contest, finished with 12 kills

and a .611«ayerage. Wendell, responsible for most of
the setting chores in light of freshman Lisa Sharp
ley's sore hip, had 22 assists to go with 8 kills. Hro
madka also contributed with 6 kills.
Berkeley's lackluster performance gave Stanford
head coach Don Shaw a chance to give valuable sub
stitutes a bit more playing time than usual.
McNamee, junior Maureen McLaren, sophomore
Nikki Otto and freshman Debbie Lambert had the
opportunity to showcase their all-around skills
against the Bears. They are normally responsible for
honing the skills of the regular starters during prac
tices and fulfilling key roles during matches.
"Coming out of high school, you're the cream of
the crop," McLaren said on KZSU radio following

the match. "Coming into Stanford, you become a
small fish in a big pond. Everyone has to make
adjustments."
McLaren has made those adjustments, perhaps
more than her teammates. The exceptional athlete,
who also swims for the national champion women's
swim team, saw more playing time during her fresh
man and sophomore seasons than she has this cam
paign due to the influx of new talent.
"It's been good for me," she continued. "I'd
rather play a little and do my part on a winning
team, than play a lot on a losing team. These days I
feel my role is to bring a little consistency to the
game. I'm in there to play smart. I also try to have
fun and make sure everyone else has fun too."

require as far a stretch.
