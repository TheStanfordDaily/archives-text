Cardinal junior Gary Wendell sizzled in the desert this past weekend
as the volleyball team traveled to Arizona. Against No. 16 Arizona
on Friday, Wendell hit .261 and worked her way to a match-high 15
digs. She also garnered 18 assists and two service aces. Against No.
14 Arizona State the very next day, she had nine kills, 19 assists and
hit .304. Based on her numbers and leadership in the two victories,
she was Stanford's nominee for Pac-10 Player of the Week.

frenzy just at the beginning of the second period. The native of
New York leads the 14-1, No. 1 Cardinal with 37 points this sea
