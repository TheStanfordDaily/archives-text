# Tailgating with cheese and chablis
## 
### 
Here at Stanford we work and we
schmooze, we play and we booze while
visions of Jaguars dance in our heads.
Admit it, despite fears of being condemned to
the obscurity of middle-classdom, most of us
harbor secret ambitions of dipping our hands
into the Wall Street cookie jar or picking a fight

with Ruth
Bader Ginsberg <
on the Supreme
Court bench one
day.
Even edging
out your organic
chemistry pro
fessor for the
Nobel Prize or
surpassing Joe
Montana as the
greatest quar-

terback ever — anything to get a little piece of
Stanford named after you.
Reality strikes when the fine print on your
bachelor's degree translates only into only a
modest suburban house, one fuel-efficient mini
van, 2.4 kids, and a middle-management job
which guarantees you a combined six-figure
salaiy but squashes any dreams of etching your
name on choice pieces of Stanford real estate.
Twenty-five years from now, you'll join the
ranks of your balding and sagging classmates at
. the annual homecoming/alumni game. Dressed
vin plaid*golfing pants and varying shades of red,
your conversation topics will have evolved from *
inquiring about CIV classes to offering stock
tips from your favorite investment broker.
Like the alumni-reunion scenes on campus
last week, you'll be herding your loved ones
from one hallowed University landmark to the
next, recalling pleasant, albeit antiquated, snip
pets of information about each. This trip down
memory lane culminates in another fine Stan
ford tradition — the oh-sO-close football game
which serves as the homecoming finale.
Unlike your undergrad days, gone will be the
hours you spend picking splinters out of your
butt on the student side of the Stadium. No
longer will you have to watch the game half
delirious from both the sweltering heat and the
painftilly sunburned 'S' on your chest. Never
again willyou be ridiculed for not jymping at the
the knd plays "All Eight Now."
lnsteaa, you'll tailgate with tableclotn and
polished silverware, whetting your palate on
dainty chunks of Brie and Metamucil-laced pas
tries. Before entering the Stadium, you might
have a drink with the boys and break out that
bottle of Dom Perignon '37 you were saving for
the post-game celebration.
Upon entering the Stadium, you buy every
souvenir in sight as a pitiful attempt to reassim
ilate into the collegiate community. Finally,

This is no laughing matter.
Our national ranking took an
arthritic leap from sixth to fifth
this year because of increased
alumni satisfaction.
Even though our football team
is trudging through a painfully
constipated season, just the idea of
football brings alumni together
and puts them in a more generous
mood.
Besides that, it's not too late to
make plans for your own future.
A couple million dollars here and
a couple million there, and one
day Stanford Stadium may no

Go out and window shop
around campus today, pick out a
building or two, don't be afraid to
improvise — after all, we're all
hoping to be semi-successful
alumni one day.
