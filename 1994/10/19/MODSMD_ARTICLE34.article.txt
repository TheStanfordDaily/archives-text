# When the night comes...
## Frisbee golf!

The Tree.
To generations of frisbee golfers
at Stanford that can only mean one
thing. Not the smiley dancing palm
tree surrounded by Dollies. Not
even the revered Palo Alto embla
zoned on all Stanford parapherna
lia.
It is hole number four on the
official Stanford Frisbee Golf
Course. This frisbee-eating tree

| |

reminds one of a pathetically
enduring Charlie Brown holding
the string of a kite being quickly
digested by a tree.
"There must be at least twenty
to thirty frisbees up there," said
freshman Dmitri Bobrovnikoff.
The tree's voracious appetite
seems limitless. This appetite com
bined with the golfers' sacred oath
to never leave ones' trustworthy
disk behind can cause problems.
"The first time I went out, we
got some disks stuck up in the tree
behind Mem Chu. We threw a fris
bee up [to try to get the other down]
but got it stuck. We did get some
one else's down. We got one of the
palm fronds down and dragged it
back to Lag as a trophy to our first
night out," freshman Carolyn
Anzia said.
These group experiences create
a unique bond within the low-pro
file golfing community. "I got to
know a lot of people a lot better and
saw a different side of people,"
Anzia continued. "It really doesn't
matter if you're not good. Especial
ly in large groups it's not really the
game [that's fun] but someone usu
ally says something funny. There
are all of these inside jokes."

Since the course has traditional
ly been based on word-of-mouth,
many unusual traditions have
developed. There are terms for spe
cial moves (the "Sexy Lexy", the
"Ken Gunn Stretch"). Last year in
Lagunita, players started wearing a
golf hat for good luck as well as
smoking cheap cigars and having a
pre-golf drinking session. The
cigars or drinks haven't yet caught
on at Lag, but a multitude of hats
can be seen on every golfing expedi
tion.
"My favorite is the sombrero.
I'm hoping to start a collection [of
funny hats]. If a group walks
around late at night with funny
hats you know they're frisbee
golfers," said Anzia.
But beyond the superficial dif
ferences of various frisbee golfers,
they all have one thing in common
— a love of the night.
"You get to see a lot of the cam
pus," she said. "The campus at
night is usually dead quiet except
for the frisbee golfers and some
rollerbladers."
In the daytime, bicyclists, cars
and people late for class rush all
over campus and don't ever have a
chance to appreciate the beauty the
campus contains. Only when you're
waiting for nine other golfers to
float their discs across the law
school courtyard or standing watch
when someone tries to get into the
basement of Green do you truly
have time to appreciate the quiet
elegance of Stanford's architecture
and artwork (a large portion of
which you get to hit while complet
ing the course).
Of course others aren't as aes
thetically aware of the course.

ct ics you have to remind
hat coifing is supposed to
especially when your disc
mi (op of Meyer or when the
ik lei sgo on right when you are
attempt a difficult putt.

Other times, fun can come up unex
pectedly. One night six golfers
chased a rollerblader after he
grabbed one of their discs by the
Quad. After a long and spirited
chase he was eventually tackled. It
turned out that he was on the Ulti
mate team, along with two of the
golfers.
So, before you go out, remember
to have fun, bring your hat,
appreciate the art and watch out
for disc robbers and The Tree.
