# Hailing from Hungary, Lehoczky plays with passion
## Brings creativity, quickness to polo team 
### Kyle Utsumi Staff writer 
When Stanford water polo coach Dante Detta
manti goes out recruiting, he usually finds most of
his top talent right in his own backyard. A large
majority of the country's best players hail from the
state of California.
One member of the No. 1 Cardinal squad boasts
hometown roots which reach far further than any
others. Sophomore Daniel Lehoczky has come a long
way from his home of Budapest, Hungary, to the
waters of deGuerre Pool and now plays a vital part
on Stanford's top-ranked team.
Lehoczky lived in Budapest through his junior
year of high school before accompanying his mother,
a visiting professor in the law school, to Stanford in
the summer of 1991.
The trip turned out to be a boon for Dettamanti
and Cardinal assistant coach Ben Quittner, who is
also Hungarian.
"When he spent the summer here, Daniel played
with our high school age-group summer team," Det
tamanti said. "We liked what we saw."
Lehoczky, who had played water polo for KSI
Sports Club since age seven, also enjoyed life in the
United States. He decided to take part in a foreign
exchange program at Harbor High School in Santa
Cruz, Calif., for his senior year.
"When I came, I didn't speak too much English,"
Lehoczky said. "Playing water polo and living with a
host family definitely made the transition easier. I
learned a lot in Santa Cruz — that was a really fun
time."
In his one year at Harbor, Lehoczky had his share
of fun and grabbed plenty of honors as well. At the
end of the season, he was named MVP of the Central
Coast Section, first team All-American and MVP of
Northern California.
When the time came to make decisions about his
future, Lehoczky naturally looked to Stanford.
"I was interested in academics," said Lehoczky,
who achieved straight-A's at Harbor. "I got to know
Dante and Ben when they recruited me, and I
applied to UC-Santa Barbara and Stanford. I obvi
ously chose here."
Dettamanti and Quittner are glad he did.
"Daniel is a great offensive player, with great
moves and shots," Dettamanti said. "He is also an

excellent passer, on the six-on-five man advantage
and on counter-attacks."
"When Daniel came, he was used to European
water polo," Quittner said. "I told him to get used to
the reffing here and the type of game we play here.
He has done that and this year he is playing very
well."
Lehoczky cracked Stanford's starting line-up
early in the season, and has responded b> helping
the team to a 14-1 record. He is currently fifth on
the team in scoring with 18 goals.
"I was hoping I would be contributing this year,
Lehoczky said. "I didn't know if I would be a starter,
but we had two left-handers graduate, so I was hop
ing for some more playing time."
A lefty himself, Lehoczky has filled the spaces left
by the graduation of Antonio Busquets and Chris
Wallin.
"Everyone feels real good having Daniel in, espe
cially on the six-on-five," said team co-captain Wolf
Wigo. "He is a good passer with a quick shot. Anto
nio could really heat the ball, but was not as good at
finding the open man on the post."
The exceptional quickness displayed by lehoczky
is integral to his success. At 5 feet 11 inches,
Lehoczky is smaller than many of his teammates
and competitors.
"I'm not as big as some of the other guys, so for
me my advantage has to be speed and quickness,"
Lehoczky said.
His role in the pool is similar to that of a point
guard in basketball, which is how Lehoczky
describes his play.
"When I'm in the game, I can map out the situa
tions very quickly," he said. "I try to see who's open
and who I can pass to. That's my position in the
game."
Dettamanti attributes Lehoczky's advanced skills
and game sense to his early beginnings in the sport.
"Body-wise, he doesn't look like the other guys,
but he's smart and has an eye for the game and a
feel for shooting," Dettamanti said. "That comes
from playing since he was seven years old."
While Lehoczky is the first Hungarian Detta
manti has coached at Stanford, the former U.S.
National Team Coach is familiar with the typical
Hungarian style of play.

' king a balance between hard-earned skill and natural talent, Dan Lehoczky's solid contributions to
the team leave no doubt hanging in the air.
"Daniel is a typical Hungarian
player," Dettamanti said. "He has
lots of experience and very good
ball sense. Passing, shooting —
anything with the ball he is fan
tastic at. Those skills take years
to develop."
Lehoczky compared youth
water polo in Hungary to Little
League Baseball here in the United
States. He also feels that he brings
the Hungarian style with him.
"In Hungary, water polo play
ers try to be entertaining for the
crowd," he said. "I love to make
surprising situations — when
everyone is expecting one thing, I
look to do something different."
A memorable display of this
occurred earlier this season
against UCLA, when Lehoczky
shot a spinning backhander from
the side of the pool. The ball flew
by the Bruin goalie before he real
ized what was coming.
"Water polo players concen
trate a lot on skills in Europe,"

Lehoczky said. "Here, swimming
and the counter-attack are much
more emphasized. Creativity —
that is the fun in water polo. I
think [Stanford| plays very enter
taining water polo."
Being an integral part of the
No. 1 college water polo team in
America is something Lehoczky
never thought of while living in
Budapest.
"When I came, I didn't know
anything about American water
polo," Lehoczky said. "It was
coincidence that I was that close
to Stanford and I'm really thank
ful for that."
Another thing Lehoczky feels
very thankful for is the comfort
and encouragement provided by
the Swansons, his host family
from Santa Cruz.
"I always keep in touch with
them, and they come up for all of
my games," Lehoczky said.
While home is very far away in
Hungary, Lehoczky benefits from
having a foster family in the area
and from his unique water polo
skills. And Dettamanti and the
Cardinal are reaping the benefits
of foreign exchange.

ball sense. Passing, shooting —
anything with the ball he is fan
tastic at. Those skills take years
to develop."
Lehoczky compared youth
water polo in Hungary to Little
League Baseball here in the United
States. He also feels that he brings
the Hungarian style with him.
"In Hungary, water polo play
ers try to be entertaining for the
crowd," he said. "I love to make
surprising situations — when
everyone is expecting one thing, I
look to do something different."
A memorable display of this
occurred earlier this season
against UCLA, when Lehoczky
shot a spinning backhander from
the side of the pool. The ball flew
by the Bruin goalie before he real
ized what was coming.
"Water polo players concen
trate a lot on skills in Europe,"

Lehoczky said. "Here, swimming
and the counter-attack are much
more emphasized. Creativity —
that is the fun in water polo. I
think [Stanford| plays very enter
taining water polo."
Being an integral part of the
No. 1 college water polo team in
America is something Lehoczky
never thought of while living in
Budapest.
"When I came, I didn't know
anything about American water
polo," Lehoczky said. "It was
coincidence that I was that close
to Stanford and I'm really thank
ful for that."
Another thing Lehoczky feels
very thankful for is the comfort
and encouragement provided by
the Swansons, his host family
from Santa Cruz.
"I always keep in touch with
them, and they come up for all of
my games," Lehoczky said.
While home is very far away in
Hungary, Lehoczky benefits from
having a foster family in the area
and from his unique water polo
skills. And Dettamanti and the
Cardinal are reaping the benefits
of foreign exchange.
When Stanford water polo coach Dante Detta
manti goes out recruiting, he usually finds most of
his top talent right in his own backyard. A large
majority of the country's best players hail from the
state of California.
One member of the No. 1 Cardinal squad boasts
hometown roots which reach far further than any
others. Sophomore Daniel Lehoczky has come a long
way from his home of Budapest, Hungary, to the
waters of deGuerre Pool and now plays a vital part
on Stanford's top-ranked team.
Lehoczky lived in Budapest through his junior
year of high school before accompanying his mother,
a visiting professor in the law school, to Stanford in
the summer of 1991.
The trip turned out to be a boon for Dettamanti
and Cardinal assistant coach Ben Quittner, who is
also Hungarian.
"When he spent the summer here, Daniel played
with our high school age-group summer team," Det
tamanti said. "We liked what we saw."
Lehoczky, who had played water polo for KSI
Sports Club since age seven, also enjoyed life in the
United States. He decided to take part in a foreign
exchange program at Harbor High School in Santa
Cruz, Calif., for his senior year.
"When I came, I didn't speak too much English,"
Lehoczky said. "Playing water polo and living with a
host family definitely made the transition easier. I
learned a lot in Santa Cruz — that was a really fun
time."
In his one year at Harbor, Lehoczky had his share
of fun and grabbed plenty of honors as well. At the
end of the season, he was named MVP of the Central
Coast Section, first team All-American and MVP of
Northern California.
When the time came to make decisions about his
future, Lehoczky naturally looked to Stanford.
"I was interested in academics," said Lehoczky,
who achieved straight-A's at Harbor. "I got to know
Dante and Ben when they recruited me, and I
applied to UC-Santa Barbara and Stanford. I obvi
ously chose here."
Dettamanti and Quittner are glad he did.
"Daniel is a great offensive player, with great
moves and shots," Dettamanti said. "He is also an

excellent passer, on the six-on-five man advantage
and on counter-attacks."
"When Daniel came, he was used to European
water polo," Quittner said. "I told him to get used to
the reffing here and the type of game we play here.
He has done that and this year he is playing very
well."
Lehoczky cracked Stanford's starting line-up
early in the season, and has responded b> helping
the team to a 14-1 record. He is currently fifth on
the team in scoring with 18 goals.
"I was hoping I would be contributing this year,
Lehoczky said. "I didn't know if I would be a starter,
but we had two left-handers graduate, so I was hop
ing for some more playing time."
A lefty himself, Lehoczky has filled the spaces left
by the graduation of Antonio Busquets and Chris
Wallin.
"Everyone feels real good having Daniel in, espe
cially on the six-on-five," said team co-captain Wolf
Wigo. "He is a good passer with a quick shot. Anto
nio could really heat the ball, but was not as good at
finding the open man on the post."
The exceptional quickness displayed by lehoczky
is integral to his success. At 5 feet 11 inches,
Lehoczky is smaller than many of his teammates
and competitors.
"I'm not as big as some of the other guys, so for
me my advantage has to be speed and quickness,"
Lehoczky said.
His role in the pool is similar to that of a point
guard in basketball, which is how Lehoczky
describes his play.
"When I'm in the game, I can map out the situa
tions very quickly," he said. "I try to see who's open
and who I can pass to. That's my position in the
game."
Dettamanti attributes Lehoczky's advanced skills
and game sense to his early beginnings in the sport.
"Body-wise, he doesn't look like the other guys,
but he's smart and has an eye for the game and a
feel for shooting," Dettamanti said. "That comes
from playing since he was seven years old."
While Lehoczky is the first Hungarian Detta
manti has coached at Stanford, the former U.S.
National Team Coach is familiar with the typical
Hungarian style of play.
