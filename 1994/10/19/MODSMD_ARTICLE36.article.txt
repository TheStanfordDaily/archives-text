# Schlukebir to represent Cardinal
## Heads to All-American champs

The Stanford women's tennis
team will put its N0.3 preseason
ranking on the shoulderen of
sophomore Katie Schlukebir as
she looks to establish herself at
the Indoor Tennis Association
All-American Tennis Champi
onships starting Thursday in
Pacific Palisades, Calif.
Schlukebir recently was
ranked No. 20 by the Rolex Col
legiate preseason polls. The
upcoming tournament repre
sents her first match as an Ail-
American, an award which she
earned for her success as a dou
bles player last year. Although
the tournament rules stipulate
that only All-American singles
players would receive automatic
entry to the championship
bracket, Schlukebir will be
allowed to bypass the qualifying
competition due to her high pre
season ranking.
"I'm looking forward to the
tournament. Getting here was
one of my goals for last year,"
Schlukebir said.
Head coach Frank Brennan
awaits the tournament eagerly
as well.
"It'll be fun to see how much
damage she can do," he said. "I
think she's clearly one of the top
players in the country right
now."
WhUe capturing a preseason
win would sit well with both
Schlukebir and Brennan, he also

sees extreme value in the other
aspects of the competition.
"I would think it's more of an
experience thing for Katie," he
said. "But I still think she can
win some matches and do some
major damage."
Due to the existence of a first
round consolation bracket in the
tournament, every player is
guaranteed at least two matches
regardless of their success.
"I really don't know what to
expect," she said. "I think you
have to go in a little cocky in
order to win these types of tour
naments. I've been playing well
the last week and a half so we'll
see what happens."
The team in addition still
lacks a defined No. 1 player,
another factor Brennan will be
watching for in Los Angeles.
"She could be the one," Bren
nan said. "We'll see how she
does against the other No. 1
[players] and how she likes it up
there at the top." Schlukebir
played at the No. 3 spot last year
for the Cardinal.
Junior Kim Shasby and fresh
man Ania Bleszynski received
invitations to the qualifying
tournament but denied for aca
demic reasons.
