# Constantly in transition
## Stanford Arboretum Children's Center again seeks new administrator following resignation of its director after only two months on the job 
### Jo Marshall Staff writer 
After only two months as director of the
Stanford Arboretum Children's Center, Mas
taneh Habibi resigned Monday due to person
al reasons, according to Kathleen Sullivan,
director of Child and Family Services.
Habibi's resignation is the latest in a series
of operational difficulties the center has been
battling since 1992.
"Certainly families are concerned when the
center is in a transition phase," Sullivan said.
She added that since Habibi had only been
director since September, the center seemed
to be going through two transitions — her hir
ing and her resignation — simultaneously.
Sullivan said, though, that "all the parents
have been informed and the center is very sta
ble and the children are very stable."
The center — which operates independent
ly from the University — provides daytime

care for about 125 children aged two months
to four years old whose parents are employees
or students at Stanford, Stanford University
Hospital or the Lucile Salter Packard Chil
dren's Hospital.
Sullivan will be acting director for the cen
ter during the transition period. She said the
center's governing board has already begun
the search for a new director, a process she
hopes will be completed within the next two to
four weeks.
"Parents are relieved to hear someone has
taken the position of acting director," she said.
The center has had problems dating back in
1992, when former bookkeeper Tammy Shipp
was sentenced to four months in county jail
and three years probation for embezzling
more than $18,000 from the center.
Sullivan said, however, that the resignation
was not related to any problems with the oper
ation of the center, and maintained that the
program was running very well.

Habibi was unavailable for comment last
night.
"It is a very rich program for the children,"
Sullivan said, adding that in August the center
received accreditation from the National Asso
ciation for Education of Young Children, an
independent organization that sets the stan
dards for high quality within the field of early
childhood education, including child care.
"Stanford has always been a leader in pro
viding child care on campus," she said. "It was
one of the first universities to have on-site
child-care programs."
The Arboretum Children's Center is one of
a variety of programs offering child care on
campus. The University provides space rent
free for child-care centers and pays for major
building maintenance.
The center, which opened in 1988, is oper
ated by a board of enrolled children's parents,
and advisory consultants from the University
and the two hospitals.
