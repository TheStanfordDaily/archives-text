# 'What's behind my blouse?'
## Sargam asks unique questions a cappella 
### Valerie Hung 
Faces lifted eagerly, their bod
ies moving in sync, members of
Stanford's latest a cappella group,
Sargam, raise their voices in song
to ask, "What's behind my
blouse?"
The answer, "My heart is be
hind my blouse," typifies
Sargam's distinctive style which is
unique and a bit unexpected.
The song, "Choli Ke Peeche
Kya Hai," was taken from a 1993
Hindi film. But Sargam's rendi
tion has at least one important dif
ference from its predecessor. The
original — like all Indian songs —
contains considerable instrumen
tal backup. In fact, the simple con
cept of Indian a cappella is un
heard of. That is, until now.
The initial inspiration for Indi

an a cappella came from the mind
of senior Girish Khera, so-called
group Guru.
"I was in the shower trying to
think of something everyone
would remember as unique when
the idea hit me," he said. "Iran up
stairs to tell my friend, with only a
towel wrapped around my waist."
The all-male group first per
formed the song as part of Mela,
an annual Sanskriti program. In
tended as a spoof of the a cappella
genre, the performance stayed
faithful to the movie version,
which is performed in drag. Mem
bers donned traditional skirts and
chunnis, or women's scarves.
The spoof extends to the name
of the group itself. Sargam, the
Hindi word for "scale" or literally
