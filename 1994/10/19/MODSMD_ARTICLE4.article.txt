# 'What's behind my blouse?'
## Sargam asks unique questions a cappella 
### Valerie Hung 
Faces lifted eagerly, their bod
ies moving in sync, members of
Stanford's latest a cappella group,
Sargam, raise their voices in song
to ask, "What's behind my
blouse?"
The answer, "My heart is be
hind my blouse," typifies
Sargam's distinctive style which is
unique and a bit unexpected.
The song, "Choli Ke Peeche
Kya Hai," was taken from a 1993
Hindi film. But Sargam's rendi
tion has at least one important dif
ference from its predecessor. The
original — like all Indian songs —
contains considerable instrumen
tal backup. In fact, the simple con
cept of Indian a cappella is un
heard of. That is, until now.
The initial inspiration for Indi

an a cappella came from the mind
of senior Girish Khera, so-called
group Guru.
"I was in the shower trying to
think of something everyone
would remember as unique when
the idea hit me," he said. "Iran up
stairs to tell my friend, with only a
towel wrapped around my waist."
The all-male group first per
formed the song as part of Mela,
an annual Sanskriti program. In
tended as a spoof of the a cappella
genre, the performance stayed
faithful to the movie version,
which is performed in drag. Mem
bers donned traditional skirts and
chunnis, or women's scarves.
The spoof extends to the name
of the group itself. Sargam, the
Hindi word for "scale" or literally

the English equivalent of "do, re,
me" is also an acronym for the
names of the group's founding
members.
After delighting the crowd at
Mela, the group took their act to
Bechtel International Center's
International Festival last spring.
The audience loved it.
"We were really surprised by
the response," Khera said. "A lot
of non-Indians came up to us
afterward wanting to know where
they could get the movie. . . .
Asians, Scandinavians and Irani
ans responded to our three
minute performance. RAs asked
us to come by dorms. We even got
an offer to perform off campus."
Several students auditioned,
leading to the addition of one new
member. Swept up by the excite
ment, the group kept practicing
and formally decided to become
an independent a cappella group a
few weeks ago.
"We had so much energy and
enthusiasm between us." said
member Raghav Kapoor. "It was
really the enthusiasm which kept
us going."
In addition to singing in anoth
er language, the new group differs
from others by stressing visual as
well as audio presentation.
"Most Hindi popular songs
come from Hindi films, which are
much like American 60s musicals."
explained member Arnab Chanda.
"Since we are trying to produce the
exact same songs without instru
ments, we provide more acting
than other a cappella groups."
This difference in perspective
translates into an unusual mix of
music and drama.
"We see a cappella as a perfor
mance," Khera said. We embel
lish the song [so that it] not only
sounds good, but there's some
thing visually there as well."
The nine-member group share
many common interests. Almost
all are technical majors and all
but one love to sing in the shower.

While their musical backgrounds
vary, ranging from those with
voice training to one who plays
the flute, most of them play the
guitar and enjoy Hindi films.
Sargam's repertoire, however,
contains more than popular Hindi
songs. Members plan on learning
songs in other languages from the
Indian subcontinent.
The group — made up of stu
dents from India, Hong Kong and
Indonesia — is open to all ethnic
backgrounds. Indian music nor
mally contains a strong percussion
or bass, which does not require
any knowledge of the language.
"Granted our group isn't going
to attract everyone and that's

fine," Khera acknowledged. "We
don't profess to be the quality of
the other a cappella groups on
campus, but we do profess to have
something different."
"We're at the transition point,"
he added. "We're just getting out of
the honeymoon period, and now
we're concentrating on learning We
don't want to be a one-hit wonder."
Building up their repertoire
seems to be the main goal right
now. Musical Guru Sandeep Jain
is currently working to improve
the group's quality by reviewing
the fundamentals.
"We're not just here to per
form and have fun, but to know
the notes," he said.

Group enthusiasm, however,
still runs high. After a particular
ly productive or enjoyable prac
tice, group members rally togeth
er and cry, "Jai Sargam! (Victory
Sargam)."
As to the future, Khera hopes
to "promote world peace and har
mony. Eventually, we plan to star
in a Hindi movie. Right now I'm
still pulling strings."
Joking aside, Sargam plans to
perform in restaurants, the Bay
Area and eventually tour the
country.
Other possible projects include
parodies of English songs. A
Hindi version of "Brown Eyed
Girl?" It just may happen.
