# Federal officials announce changes in the regulations that govern indirect costs
## 
### Scott Van Winkle Senior staff writer 
Along with Stanford's settlement yesterday
with the government, federal officials also an
nounced changes to their current accounting
system aimed at reducing the workload in
volved in setting indirect-cost rates.
The government's new system of setting in
direct-cost rates — or the percentage the gov
ernment pays of expenses associated with re
search that cannot be attributed to any single
project, such as building depreciation — will no
longer require repetitive assessments of expen
ditures but will instead use multi-year, fixed
rates.
While subtle and technical in nature, the
change constitutes a fundamental shift in bud
get planning processes, Vice Provost for Insti
tutional Planning Geoffrey Cox said.
"It will allow us a good deal more certainty
about future years," he said, stabilizing what
had been "one of the most variable components
of [the University's] revenue stream."
The new system, which allows the govern
ment and universities to establish multi-year
indirect-cost rates, will replace Stanford's cur
rent process of renegotiating its indirect-cost
rate each year.
Stanford's volatile rate has made budget
forecasting difficult under the present system.
Since Stanford's dispute with the govern-
ment began in 1990, the rate has
been highly unstable, dropping
from 78 percent in August 1990
to 55.5 percent in September
1991. The current rate is 58 per
cent.
The changes were announced
in conjunction with the Stanford
settlement, in which the govern
ment and University agreed that
Stanford did not act inappropri
ately in charging the government
$185 million in indirect costs
from 1981 to 1992.

The primary difference under
the new plan, said Reed Brimhall,
director of the University's Office
of Government Cost and Rate
Studies, is that government offi
cials "don't come back and audit"
every year.
Instead, the government will
attempt to match the indirect
cost rate over the long run to the
actual amount spent by
researchers.
The new system also calls for
the government to stick to a pre
determined rate of payment,
Brimhall said, meaning that, for
individual years, researchers will
have to adjust to any differences

between actual costs and what
they are paid by the government.
Previously, the government
would "carry forward" differences
in costs and account for them in
the next fiscal year, he said.
Under the new system, univer
sities will be required to have
independent audits conducted,
but actual indirect costs will be
audited by the government only if
evidence of fraud or irregularity is
discovered, an Office of Naval
Research statement said.
Eventually, the change will
probably allow the University to
"downsize" its accounting opera
tions, Cox said.

The Office of Naval Research,
which sets policy for indirect-cost
reimbursement, stressed the
administrative savings that the
plan will achieve, particularly by
centralizing its negotiation team.
Brimhall said the centralization
will not have much effect on the
University, since negotiators
from headquarters had already
been brought in to deal with the
Stanford controversy.
That was a "strained relation
ship," he said, because both par
ties were being criticized by
Congress. The relationship has
now been "normal" for a couple of
year?, though, he said.
