# Police chief discusses safety, crime concerns with ASSU
## 
### Kevin Wack Staff writer 
Students finally got answers to some
long-standing questions about the Stanford
Police Department's handling of bicycle
thefts and parking violations at last night's
ASSU meeting.
ASSU senators questioned Stanford Po
lice Chief Marvin Harrington for about an
hour on these issues, in addition to voicing
concerns about safeguards against violent
crime on campus and perceived police ha
rassment of drivers.
Harrington said that although bike thefts
have increased in recent years, more bikes
were stolen from campus in 1971 than last
year. He said it is difficult for the department
to make much of a dent in the bike problem.
"Bicycle theft has become a crime of op
portunity around here," Harrington said.
"It's a way to make money. We haven't been
able to make a big dent in it. Generally
speaking, bikes are taken out of the area
and sold."

Graduate senator Donald Aingworth
asked about the enforcement of parking
regulations in residential lots.
While Harrington acknowledged that
more needs to be done, he said a shortage of
resources prevented the department from
doing more.
"We issue all the tickets. [Santa Clara
County] gets all the money," he said. "Part
of the justification [for the current set-up]
is that we're using the public law, and we're
using the court systems. We have argued it
with the county, and the short answer is
[no]."
Undergraduate senator Stephen Rus
sell, a junior, asked Harrington about the
prevalence of gun crimes on campus.
"We occasionally pick up people here for
firearms," Harrington said. "[But] we don't
have a great number of weapons crimes on
campus. It's not a significant problem."
Harrington added that recently passed
laws make it a felony to carry a loaded
weapon on campus, but said he
could not remember any incidents
in which a gun was fired within
the past few years.
He also responded to concerns
from Deputy Senate Chair
Michael Choo regarding the avail
ability of emergency phones for
victims of violent crime. Harring
ton noted that 12 pay phones with
free 911 calls had been added
recently, and said he hoped more
would be approved in the future.
Finally, Harrington responded
to charges that officers harass
students when writing traffic
citations. He said that officers are
not to photograph motorists
unless they do not have identifica
tion.
In other business, the senate

unanimously approved three
bills. One established the
Entrepreneurial Club, an ASSU
affiliate that will provide funding
for grants to students. The club is
to be funded in 1994-95 by Trilo
gy, a company founded by former
Stanford students.
The other two bills passed
approved the new bylaws for the
Tresidder Union Recreation Cen
ter and the Disc Connection, a stu
dent enterprise funded by an
ASSU grant.
Senators Irene Folstrom and
Robert Jonas were selected to sit
on the University's Special Fee
Reform Task Force, which will
review and recommend changes
to the current special fee refund
system.
And Senate Chair Nawwar
Kasrawi said that senators' uni
forms — sweatshirts that identify
them as ASSU senators — will be
available to them starting today.
