Anyone who tries to borrow your last five spot
isn't a friend, anyway.
d Label your spare-change jar "beetle farm."
Then, put your beetle farm in a jar labeled
"spare change."
d Mark up every space on checks.
Don't leave room for someone to fill in their
name and extra zeros.
ft Keep your wallet in your front pocket.
It discourages pickpockets. So does wearing
really tight pants.
