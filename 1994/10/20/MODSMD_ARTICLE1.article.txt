# Vindicated? The price of the indirect-cost scandal
## Profs relieved and hopeful about settlement, future 
### Martin L. Yeung 
After four years of uncertainty over how the gov
ernment would resolve its indirect-cost suit against
the University, members of the Stanford academic
community expressed optimism and relief over the
recent settlement of the dispute.
Overall, faculty said they did not feel the suit —
which claimed that the University overbilled the
government by $185 million over a period of 12 years
— permanently affected Stanford's reputation.
"I don't think there is any long-term damage to
the University," said English Prof. George Dekker, a
member of the Faculty Senate.
But although the suit may not have damaged
Stanford's academic prestige, others said it did affect
public perception of the University, as well as the
reputation of other national research universities.
"If there is the suggestion that something is
going wrong at one of our institutions — especial
ly someplace like Stanford — it's possible some
thing is wrong at one of the others," said Cornelius
Pings, president of the American Association of
Universities.

Former University President Donald Kennedy, in his Encina Hall office, talks about the
recent indirect-cost settlement.
Stanford 'vindicated'
On Monday, the University
settled a four-year lawsuit filed by
the federal government over
alleged billing improprieties. The
suit questioned Stanford's claims
of reimbursement for indirect
costs incurred in research Stan
ford conducted on behalf of the
federal government.
Indirect costs, or the percent
age of grant money that can be
used to cover costs of govern
ment-sponsored research, are
costs that cannot be attributed to
a single project, such as building
depreciation.
The news that University
administrators had settled Stan
ford's long-running lawsuit with
the Office of Naval Research —
the department which negotiates
the indirect-cost rate — left Stan

ford faculty members relieved.
"I think it's a wonderful out
come," Dekker said. "It answers
questions about the propriety of the
charges ... it's very good news."
Dekker added he believes the

decision "vindi
cated Stanford."
Political Sci
ence Prof. John
Ferejohn agreed
that a resolution
was important
for the future of
Stanford.
"It was wise
for the Universi-

ty to get the whole matter over
with and settle the cloud of uncer
tainty affecting development
prospects," Ferejohn said.
Overall, Stanford faculty
seemed to think that there was no
damage done to the long-term
public perception of the Universi
ty
"We've recovered a lot of
ground," said Statistics Prof.
Bradley Efron. "We got off cheap

ly compared to the enormous
amounts that were accessed
against us."
But Efron admitted the settle
ment was not "a feather in the
cap" of Stanford.
Law Prof. Robert Weisberg
said the topic never came up when
prospective students would visit
him, though while on trips he had
to endure jabs at Stanford's prob
lems. But under the jokes, he said,
there was a collective sense of
anxiety.
"After bringing the topic up,
there would be a realization we
were all in the same boat. . . that
this lawsuit was in no one's inter
est," said Weisberg.
Media bias?
Indeed, while faculty members
praised the amicable settlement
with federal regulators, they were
unanimous in their belief that the
media had sensationalized Stan
ford's misfortunes.
"That was unfair, we got a lot
of mud thrown at us," said

Dekker. Other colleges, such as
Caltech and MIT, had also over
charged for research costs, but it
was Stanford that suffered the
bad publicity, he added.
University President Gerhard
Casper said the agreement was a
step in restoring Stanford's tar
nished prestige and reputation.
"I think it is almost universally
the case that corrections do not
get the same play as the original
sensationalized stories," Casper

said. "The dam
age done by head
lines can never
quite be undone."
The entire
affair generated
only one good
thing, said Chem
istry Prof. Steven
Boxer: "We spent
millions of dollars

and got probably the tightest
accounting system around.
"It's important that we put the
number in perspective — the
amount we will pay is $1.2 million,"

Boxer said. "For the 12-year period
that the alleged improprieties were
to have occurred, Stanford's budget
exceeded $20 billion ... given the
amounts we are talking about, it's a
drop in the bucket."
Philosophy Prof. John Etchem
endy said the government basically
"reneged" on its promises of indi
rect-cost reimbursement.
"The reason why we did not
bother to account for work done
in a 'punch card' fashion was
because we made a deal with the
government 10 years ago that if
they would pay for all the indirect
costs [overhead] of research we
would give them a discount,"
Etchemendy said.
Education Prof. Kenji Hakuta
said there was a "Stanford be
damned" attitude in the general
public caused in part by the negative
media coverage. As a result, Hakuta
said the government was bandwago
ning to curry favor with voters.
Reconciled with government
Speaking for the academic

community, Pings said the Stan
ford settlement "helps us all."
"It shows the federal govern
ment that universities are good
stewards of research funds," he
said. "As long as the [Stanford]
case left a cloud, there was always
some anxiety."
Over the last few years, the
government has shown an
increasing unwillingness to fund
university research. After the suit
was first filed, Stanford's indirect
cost rate fell from 74 percent to
55.5 percent. The rate currently
stands at 58 percent.
In addition, Congress recently
passed legislation which cuts
Department of Defense funding
for research by $200 million, or 11
percent of its original budget.
Administrators have said they do
not yet know how the cuts will
affect Stanford specifically.
"I couldn't be more pleased for
Stanford," Pings said. "The firm
ness of the ONR ruling[is] an
affirmation of something we
wanted to believe."
