# Vindicated? The price of the indirect-cost scandal
## Profs relieved and hopeful about settlement, future 
### Martin L. Yeung 
After four years of uncertainty over how the gov
ernment would resolve its indirect-cost suit against
the University, members of the Stanford academic
community expressed optimism and relief over the
recent settlement of the dispute.
Overall, faculty said they did not feel the suit —
which claimed that the University overbilled the
government by $185 million over a period of 12 years
— permanently affected Stanford's reputation.
"I don't think there is any long-term damage to
the University," said English Prof. George Dekker, a
member of the Faculty Senate.
But although the suit may not have damaged
Stanford's academic prestige, others said it did affect
public perception of the University, as well as the
reputation of other national research universities.
"If there is the suggestion that something is
going wrong at one of our institutions — especial
ly someplace like Stanford — it's possible some
thing is wrong at one of the others," said Cornelius
Pings, president of the American Association of
Universities.
