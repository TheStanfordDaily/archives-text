## Sobering thoughts 
### 
Greater student effort,
not a crackdown, needed
to prevent alcohol abuse

LAST WEEK, VICE Provost
and Dean for Student
Affairs Mary Edmonds
urged her colleagues to join her in
battling alcohol consumption on
campus. She specifically noted the
serious problems associated with
increased "binge drinking." While
correct, the assessment of the
problem was easy. What is more
difficult, however, is bringing
both the administration and the
students to a common agreement
on the solution.
For students fearful of losing
their few remaining alcohol rights
and, conversely, for administrators
in search of an easy panacea to a
severe and complex problem,
Edmonds may have touched off
thoughts of a more restrictive alco
hol policy. But turning the campus
into an anti-alcohol police state is
not the answer.
Actively policing alcohol regula
tions would only deter drinking
where it could be discovered. Stu
dents with problems would be driv
en underground and further from
help. In addition, making drinking
off-limits may actually increase its
appeal to some students, for
instance, freshmen testing their
independence for the first time.
And if opportunities to drink are
severely restricted, students may
tend to drink more heavily when
they do have a chance. Such binge
drinking seems to be exactly what
Edmonds wants to prevent.
The resources used to facilitate
this policing would be better direct
ed at averting problems in the first
place and rehabilitating them when
they do occur.
But it is not enough for students
to simply condemn any University
imposed paternalism regarding
alcohol. Students must understand

that the administration is not con
sidering such a policy for arbitrary
reasons. Various federal regula
tions, the threat of lawsuits and
the relative ease of simply adopting
more rigorous standards makes
such an approach palatable. More
importantly, alcohol abuse is a
problem to which undergraduates
are particularly susceptible, and
the University feels compelled to do
something.
Therefore, if students are to
demand that the University eschew
rigid policies, they must take
responsibility for their own
actions. Students owe it to them
selves to drink responsibly. Most
students agree on this, and many
act on it.
But for some reason, students
have difficulty facing their social
responsibilities regarding alcohol.
They owe it to friends with limited
understanding of alcohol to warn
them of its dangers. They owe it to
their peers to discontinue the
myth that drinking is some sort of
"rite of passage" within college
life.
Finally, students owe it to those
who need help to tell them so. Stu
dents cannot continue under the
sophomoric assumption that drink
ing problems are an inescapable (or
even affable) part of a college per
sona that people will grow out of.
It will take the combined efforts
of students and the administration
to teach alcohol responsibility. To
begin, alcohol peer counselors
should be trained in the spring so
they can give presentations as early
as Orientation week.
More generally, the administra
tion must realize that it will never
effectively combat alcohol prob
lems on campus through restric
tions alone. Help and attitude
changes from students are an
essential part of the solution.
Similarly, students must realize
that if they fail to perform on
their end, the University will have
little choice but to impose the sort
of harsh restrictions they all
dread.
