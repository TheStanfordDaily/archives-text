Reports of unsafe conditions at EV were exaggerated

Recent daily articles and
your editorial on the reported
move-in condition of a small num
ber of Escondido Village apartments this
fall quarter fail to present a balanced
account. The number of cleaning and
maintenance problems at Escondido ref
erenced in your reports is much higher
than any of our records show.
Manager of Apartment Eacilities
Glenn Carroll has developed a survey of
new residents and is in the process of
gathering data on the move-in condition
of those apartments directly from the
occupants. That information will help us
understand better the situation at the
beginning of this quarter so we can plan
for additional improvements in our
apartment-preparation program.
The University is aware of the need
to improve living conditions in older stu
dent residences. The Housing and Din-

ing Services Capital Improvements Pro
gram was developed and implemented
two years ago in response to the fact
that all older student residences needed
upgrading. The CIP is estimated to
result in a total of $110 million in
improvements to all older residences
over the ten-year period which began in
1992. These improvements are currently
underway and involve undergraduate
and graduate residences alike.
In Escondido, the renovation process
is one that takes place throughout the
year. Over 250 apartments have been
renovated to date. Improvements include
remodeled kitchen areas, new furniture,
new carpeting, fresh paint, improved
lighting and the removal of asbestos-con
taining materials as necessary. We expect
to complete another 150 apartments in
Escondido during this year.
As this renovation program contin-

ues, stafF in Graduate Residences and
Apartment Facilities are working to
improve response time to regular main
tenance and cleaning issues throughout
all areas of graduate housing, particular
ly at the beginning and end of each aca
demic year. This is when the heaviest
volume of apartment changeovers
occurs. Our goal continues to be that no
one should move into an apartment
which has not been properly cleaned and
otherwise made ready for occupancy.
This fall, we believe we were largely
successful in meeting this objective. And
even though some apartments needed
additional cleaning and some minor
maintenance, the numbers of such
requests were nowhere near the magni
tude inferred by The Daily. We will con
tinue to work to meet the objective
we've set for ourselves to provide all stu
dents with clean, well-maintained living

environments.
In order that facilities staff respond
well to issues of cleanliness, safety or
maintenance, residents must inform us
of problems directly and in a timely way.
Housing and Dining Services staff are
trained to respond appropriately. Stu
dents are asked to file "fix-it" forms
which can be left at various neighbor
hood locations for routine maintenance
matters. For immediate maintenance
issues or emergencies, students should
call 725-1602, day or night.
Housing and Dining Services and
Graduate Residences staff have worked
together over the past year to improve
our service to students in Escondido. We
look forward to continued improvement
and to working cooperatively with stu
dent leaders in that effort.
