# Given date-rape crisis, Edmonds' cry for end to alcohol abuse too late
## 
### 
I applaud Vice Provost and Dean for
Student Affairs Mary Edmonds for her
public declaration of the need to study
the abuse of alcohol at Stanford.
I do, however, also have a serious
problem with the timing of this
announcement. It seems to follow too
closely the criminal proceedings of the
vandals who allegedly defaced the "Gay
Liberation" sculpture. It appears that
the administration was embarrassed by
the media attention focused on it by a
group of varsity athletes alleged to have
been drunk and acting out their homo
phobic beliefs, and thus Edmonds has
now decided to appear proactive in her
stance against alcohol abuse. My ques
tion is this: where was Edmonds when

hundreds of Stanford women were being
date-raped while their assailants were
under the influence of alcohol?
Anyone who has been at Stanford for
a significant length of time knows
women (and, occasionally, men) who are
survivors of date rape and sexual
assault. Why were these cases not note
worthy enough to warrant a serious look
into the problem of alcohol abuse at
Stanford? The vast majority of date
rapes — up to 80 percent, according to
some studies — occur while one or both
partners are under the influence of alco
hol. And despite the lack of officially
reported statistics, there are dozens, if
not hundreds, of date rapes on Stan
ford's campus each year. The most fre
quently cited national statistic claims
that one in six college women will be
date-raped during their college career.
Were this statistic applicable to Stan
ford, it would translate to more than 500
undergraduate students walking around
campus each day with the memory of

being sexually assaulted.
Yet despite this grim reality, the same
Vice Provost and Dean for Student
Affairs has allowed the Coalition Against
Sexual Assault to lose its funding and
become, for all intents and purposes,
nonfunctional. There has never been,
despite promises by the University
administration to provide such a posi
tion, a fully funded University employee
assigned to the prevention of sexual
assault and date rape. Why the disregard
for such a vital issue? Is it because the
problem of sexual assault and date rape
is a hidden one, occurring behind closed
dormitory doors? Has the lack of media
attention on Stanford's date-rape prob
lem meant that the Vice Provost could
simply ignore it? Yes, it has.
The only reason alcohol is now a
focus of concern at Stanford is because it
was allegedly a factor in an incident that
publicly embarrassed Stanford. The fact
that the same alcohol abuse is a factor in
dozens of date rapes each year on this

campus has never sparked the same type
of administrative concern and action.
Does this mean that Stanford is more
concerned with its public image than
with the safety and well-being of its
female students? I would conclude that
it does.
