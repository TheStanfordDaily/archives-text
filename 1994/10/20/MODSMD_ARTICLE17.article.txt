## Stanford? No, I'm at LJC 
### 
IT'S A CONSPIRACY, you know.
We've been had.
A ploy pulled right in our own front
yard. It's a moolah scam that goes beyond
boats, bouquets and bazillion-dollar show
er curtains — it's a matter of false degrees.
Under a so-called Leland Stanford Junior
University umbrella, the THEY has pulled
its greatest sting yet.
While you're pooping around, smoking
SLE books, feeling omnipotently academ
ic at what you think is that prestigious,
university known as Stanford, you may
well be enrolled in a community college.
And back when you made smug brat
faces at your high school teachers — woo
ing them with prophecies of becoming a
genuine California highbrow — you were
being deluded. Shanghaied, swindled,
bamboozled and all those other outdated
brouhaha euphemisms for screwed-over.
There are actually two schools going
on here: one Stanford University, the
other Leland. Junior College.
It's the truth. All those times you
thought that maybe the prof was just
having a slow day, or that perhaps you
read ahead of the lecture and that's why
it seemed so Romper Room — nope.
You were in the wrong damn school.
Recall questions asked by your theoreti
cally upper-echelon classmates — ones so
brain-dead you weren't sure if they were
doing whip-its during lecture or if they were
only joking. Think about the times you were
still getting A-minuses even though you

hadn't even been to the bookstore.
It wasn't that you were being so bril
liant that you breezed with lupine grace
through the monolithic challenge of Stan
ford University. You were simply trailing
bread crumbs through the straight-line
labyrinth of Leland Junior College.
It has a history too. Way back when
requirements were still under debate and
the alcohol policy consisted of "The RA
never buys the first round" — the admin
istrative THEY found it was running
short of beer money. "Skimp on the class
es," THEY said. "Make 'em pay full tuition
without fburpl really teaching 'em diddly.
That, and up the price of a Snapple to a
buck seventj'-five."
And so it was.
So far Leland Junior College has been
a covertly run operation, so well dis
guised most don't even know they're in
it. Now that the secret is out, you should
know the signs. A list has been provided:
You Can Bet Your Tuchas That Class
Is Sponsored By Leland Junior College If:
• someone uses the phrase "survey
• it'fulfills a DR.
• it meets in History Corner 200-02.
• the final is worth more than 40 per
cent of the total grade.
• it is CIV — any track.
• the syllabus reads, "This class has no
prerequisites."
• the paper topics are assigned.
• the final is open-book.

• it is mandatory P/NC.
• you're sitting next to Steve Sten
strorn.
If more than half of your total units
fall into any of the above categories, the
warning lights should be a-flashin'.
Now if we want to see any change, we
need to do more than demand the
revamping of an outdated system of
requirements and half-classes and teach
ers more resigned to blowing off a class
than are their students; we need to let
the THEY know we're on to it.
So if you suspect your lecturer's pay
check is coming from LJC, not Stanford,
yell it out.
Raise your hand mid-slide show and
announce that you would appreciate it if
someone would please begin teaching a
class worthy of your majestic 740-on-the
verbal countenance. Stand up in "Natural
Hazards and Human Survival" and tell
them that you are already well aware that
earthquakes are often rather dangerous,
thank you. Inform the professor of Stats
60 that most students learn how to calcu
late the mean in fifth, not 15th, grade.
Or you could just go with tradition and
white out the fine print on your diploma
before framing it.
