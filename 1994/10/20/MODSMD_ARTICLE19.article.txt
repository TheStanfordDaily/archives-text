## FOOTBALL MID-SEASON REPORT Cardinal defense matures Young players in need of 'permanent teeth' 
### Greg Collins Senior staff writer 
It is a tradition in the Pacific 10
Conference to christen a defense
with a nickname, like Washington's
"Purple Reign," Arizona's "Desert
Swarm" and Washington State's
"Palouse Posse."
Add to that list Stanford's "Enig
ma Defense."
While not instilling the fear of
God like those other defenses, the
Cardinal has improved over last
year's dreadful assembly which sur
rendered over 35 points a game.
Although Stanford still gives up over
30 points per outing, defensive coor
dinator Fred vonAppen is pleased
with the numerous "measurable"
improvements the defense has
made.
"We are more competitive than

we were last year," vonAppen said.
"Last year, we were digging in, try
ing to save the equipment. This year,
we're spanking some people back,
but we still have a kiddie-corps
group, which is costly for a variety of
obvious reasons — inexperience,
lack of maturity and strength."
Although the defense has yet to
hold an opponent to under 20 points,
it is not relinquishing the huge
amounts of yardage it did last year.
Ranked seventh in total defense in
the Pac-10, Stanford is giving up 367
yards per game (157 rushing, 210
passing). This is down from 454
yards per game in 1993.
So if this defense is this much
improved, why is it still letting other
teams rack up so many points?
The simple matters of field posi
tion and turnovers constitute two
big reasons for the deceptive stats.

Of the 192 points the Cardinal has
surrendered, 68 have come off
turnovers — a remarkable 35.4 per
cent. After getting the ball, teams
only have to drive 20 yards rather
than 80, making Stanford's window
for error much smaller.
That narrow margin coupled
with the team's general inexperience
makes for an explosive combination.
Starting at least three freshmen and
with as many as five on the field dur
ing a game, vonAppen is forced into
suffering through some hideous
growing pains.
"[The fresh men J have no one to
look at and emulate at their position
because they are the top rung of the
ladder," he said. "We've got a smat
tering of older guys trying to gener
ate the leadership and the direction,
and then a lot of really young guys."
After last season's trial-by-fire for
many of that year's freshman class
(now sophomores), vonAppen and
the rest of the coaching staff were
hoping to avoid a similar situation
this season. However, injuries to
junior defensive end Pete Swanson
and sophomore linebackers Brum
Batson and Justin Strand have
forced many younger players into
the lineup prematurely.
"You can (play younger players] if
the supporting cast is very mature
and strong," vonAppen said. "But
when you have to put five or six of
them in, they look around and
they're all the same age. When they
haven't got their permanent teeth,
it's 9cary."
While young players like safety
Kadar Hamilton, defensive ends
Kailee Wong and Carl Hansen, and
linebacker Jon Haskins have played
well at times and have incredibly
promising futures, vonAppen firmly
believes in the adage "the future is
now."
"Some of the measurables are
there, we see improvement," he said.
"But there isn't much to talk about
until you win games, because that's
what it's all about. That's the bot
tom line."
With a 1-4-1 record, Stanford has
had trouble reaching that bottom
line. But it can be argued that a sin
gle play in each of the Northwestern,
Arizona State and USC games has
kept the Cardinal from a 4-2 season.

After the last two agonizing losses,
vonAppen now worries about an
underlying decay of the defense's
confidence and ability.
Sighting the final drive of the Ari
zona State game as an example, von-
Appen identified several key points
which went against Stanford's
"Kafka-esque" defense. A fumble on
the first play fell right between two
Cardinal players but neither was
able to recover it, a missed tackle
turned a fourth-and-six into a
fourth-and-one and a clear intercep
tion was misjudged, falling incom
plete rather than into the hands of
Stanford cornerback Jami Webb.
"After awhile, you say 'apparent
ly it isn't meant to be,"' vonAppen
said.
"We would consider ourselves
dramatically better if we had more
'W's to look at," he continued. "But
now that we're not looking at 'W's
there's a certain amount of psycho
logical erosion that takes place.
"You win and it benefits you, no
question about it. You lose, .and it
does way more damage than win
ning does good. So, we need to win a

game because it starts to affect your
confidence and then you get to that
point again, when right at a pivotal
point at a game we get tight, instead
of saying 'All right, we've been here
before, let's close the deal out.' "
VonAppen contrasted this
squad's troubles with shutting that
door with the "state-of-the-art"
defense of two years ago, spearhead
ed by players like Ron George, Dave
Garnett, Estevan Avila and John
Lynch.
"If they got into a situation where
things were tight, they would just
roll up their sleeves and say 'bring it
on,'" vonAppen said.
He also was quick to note how
that group took four or five years to
come together as the defensive force
everyone remembers it as. After
wholesale changes in defensive per
sonnel due to graduation and
injuries, it is very possible that this
year's team will not shine for two
more years.
Specifically for this year, howev
er, vonAppen would like to see fewer

week] SC took a very phys
ical posture with us, and our guys
were kind of tentative," he said. "Not
cautious or scared, but tentative. We
were sitting and waiting for things to
happen mid that doesn't work in
football."
As for coverage, he said it seems
like a ball in the air mesmerizes
Stanford's players and they need to
have the idea that the ball is as much
theirs as it is the offensive players'.
"We've got a penchant for giving
up plays down the field in the passing
game, like we had our hands tied
behind our backs," vonAppen said.
One of the surprises of the year
has been the pass rush, as Stanford
ranks fourth in the Pac-10 with 21
sacks for 132 yards lost. The Cardi
nal surpassed bust year's total of 17
sacksjust five games into the season.
Anchoring that pass rush has
been senior nose tackle Jason Fisk,
recording five sacks among his 38
tackles thus year.
"He's put consistent pressure on
the passer from an inside position,
which isn't our forte," vonAppen
si lid.
Other team leaders in tackling are
senior linebacker Coy Gibbs (50),
senior linebacker Mike Mall (43) and
Hamilton (39).
Even with this balanced tackling
front, the Cardinal still struggles to
create that single game-breaking hit.
For the season, Stanford has forced
11 fumbles but only recovered four,
and has intercepted four passes.
"We're not a very opportunistic
defense," vonAppen said.
Now, with two solid recruiting
classes and a small collection of tal
ented upperclassmen, the defense
appears to have begun a maturation
process and is starting to play as a
unit, according to vonAppen. With a
few wins under the team's belt, he
expects much bigger things out of
this enigmatic group.
"If we don't get sidetracked with
the psychological agony of not win
ninga game and it starts to stunt our
development, then we're going to
come along and swell up) and beat
somelxxiy and play some very inter
esting games coming down the
stretch," he said.

Defensive coordinator Fred vonAppen knows the defense is young,
but "the future is now."
Lapses of such fundamental tech
niques as tackling and coverage.
Calling tackling "a reflection of atti
tude," the coach again turned to the
psychological element of football to
explain the team's deficiencies.
week] SC took a very phys
ical posture with us, and our guys
were kind of tentative," he said. "Not
cautious or scared, but tentative. We
were sitting and waiting for things to
happen mid that doesn't work in
football."
As for coverage, he said it seems
like a ball in the air mesmerizes
Stanford's players and they need to
have the idea that the ball is as much
theirs as it is the offensive players'.
"We've got a penchant for giving
up plays down the field in the passing
game, like we had our hands tied
behind our backs," vonAppen said.
One of the surprises of the year
has been the pass rush, as Stanford
ranks fourth in the Pac-10 with 21
sacks for 132 yards lost. The Cardi
nal surpassed bust year's total of 17
sacksjust five games into the season.
Anchoring that pass rush has
been senior nose tackle Jason Fisk,
recording five sacks among his 38
tackles thus year.
"He's put consistent pressure on
the passer from an inside position,
which isn't our forte," vonAppen
si lid.
Other team leaders in tackling are
senior linebacker Coy Gibbs (50),
senior linebacker Mike Mall (43) and
Hamilton (39).
Even with this balanced tackling
front, the Cardinal still struggles to
create that single game-breaking hit.
For the season, Stanford has forced
11 fumbles but only recovered four,
and has intercepted four passes.
"We're not a very opportunistic
defense," vonAppen said.
Now, with two solid recruiting
classes and a small collection of tal
ented upperclassmen, the defense
appears to have begun a maturation
process and is starting to play as a
unit, according to vonAppen. With a
few wins under the team's belt, he
expects much bigger things out of
this enigmatic group.
"If we don't get sidetracked with
the psychological agony of not win
ninga game and it starts to stunt our
development, then we're going to
come along and swell up) and beat
somelxxiy and play some very inter
esting games coming down the
stretch," he said.
It is a tradition in the Pacific 10
Conference to christen a defense
with a nickname, like Washington's
"Purple Reign," Arizona's "Desert
Swarm" and Washington State's
"Palouse Posse."
Add to that list Stanford's "Enig
ma Defense."
While not instilling the fear of
God like those other defenses, the
Cardinal has improved over last
year's dreadful assembly which sur
rendered over 35 points a game.
Although Stanford still gives up over
30 points per outing, defensive coor
dinator Fred vonAppen is pleased
with the numerous "measurable"
improvements the defense has
made.
"We are more competitive than

we were last year," vonAppen said.
"Last year, we were digging in, try
ing to save the equipment. This year,
we're spanking some people back,
but we still have a kiddie-corps
group, which is costly for a variety of
obvious reasons — inexperience,
lack of maturity and strength."
Although the defense has yet to
hold an opponent to under 20 points,
it is not relinquishing the huge
amounts of yardage it did last year.
Ranked seventh in total defense in
the Pac-10, Stanford is giving up 367
yards per game (157 rushing, 210
passing). This is down from 454
yards per game in 1993.
So if this defense is this much
improved, why is it still letting other
teams rack up so many points?
The simple matters of field posi
tion and turnovers constitute two
big reasons for the deceptive stats.

Of the 192 points the Cardinal has
surrendered, 68 have come off
turnovers — a remarkable 35.4 per
cent. After getting the ball, teams
only have to drive 20 yards rather
than 80, making Stanford's window
for error much smaller.
That narrow margin coupled
with the team's general inexperience
makes for an explosive combination.
Starting at least three freshmen and
with as many as five on the field dur
ing a game, vonAppen is forced into
suffering through some hideous
growing pains.
"[The fresh men J have no one to
look at and emulate at their position
because they are the top rung of the
ladder," he said. "We've got a smat
tering of older guys trying to gener
ate the leadership and the direction,
and then a lot of really young guys."
After last season's trial-by-fire for
many of that year's freshman class
(now sophomores), vonAppen and
the rest of the coaching staff were
hoping to avoid a similar situation
this season. However, injuries to
junior defensive end Pete Swanson
and sophomore linebackers Brum
Batson and Justin Strand have
forced many younger players into
the lineup prematurely.
"You can (play younger players] if
the supporting cast is very mature
and strong," vonAppen said. "But
when you have to put five or six of
them in, they look around and
they're all the same age. When they
haven't got their permanent teeth,
it's 9cary."
While young players like safety
Kadar Hamilton, defensive ends
Kailee Wong and Carl Hansen, and
linebacker Jon Haskins have played
well at times and have incredibly
promising futures, vonAppen firmly
believes in the adage "the future is
now."
"Some of the measurables are
there, we see improvement," he said.
"But there isn't much to talk about
until you win games, because that's
what it's all about. That's the bot
tom line."
With a 1-4-1 record, Stanford has
had trouble reaching that bottom
line. But it can be argued that a sin
gle play in each of the Northwestern,
Arizona State and USC games has
kept the Cardinal from a 4-2 season.

After the last two agonizing losses,
vonAppen now worries about an
underlying decay of the defense's
confidence and ability.
Sighting the final drive of the Ari
zona State game as an example, von-
Appen identified several key points
which went against Stanford's
"Kafka-esque" defense. A fumble on
the first play fell right between two
Cardinal players but neither was
able to recover it, a missed tackle
turned a fourth-and-six into a
fourth-and-one and a clear intercep
tion was misjudged, falling incom
plete rather than into the hands of
Stanford cornerback Jami Webb.
"After awhile, you say 'apparent
ly it isn't meant to be,"' vonAppen
said.
"We would consider ourselves
dramatically better if we had more
'W's to look at," he continued. "But
now that we're not looking at 'W's
there's a certain amount of psycho
logical erosion that takes place.
"You win and it benefits you, no
question about it. You lose, .and it
does way more damage than win
ning does good. So, we need to win a

game because it starts to affect your
confidence and then you get to that
point again, when right at a pivotal
point at a game we get tight, instead
of saying 'All right, we've been here
before, let's close the deal out.' "
VonAppen contrasted this
squad's troubles with shutting that
door with the "state-of-the-art"
defense of two years ago, spearhead
ed by players like Ron George, Dave
Garnett, Estevan Avila and John
Lynch.
"If they got into a situation where
things were tight, they would just
roll up their sleeves and say 'bring it
on,'" vonAppen said.
