# A 						healthy honor
## Cowell care receives national accreditation award 
### Jo Marshall Staff writer 
Cowell Student Health Center
yesterday became one of the few
university health centers in the
country to be honored by a nation
al accrediting association for vol
untarily meeting recognized
health care standards.
At a ceremony held at Cowell
yesterday afternoon, University

Provost Condoleezza Rice un
veiled the certificate of accredita
tion.
"Although we hope our stu
dents don't end up here, if they do
we can be confident they get the
very best service," Rice said.
The Accreditation Association
for Ambulatory Health Care
(AAAHC) — a Chicago-based non
governmental organization —
awarded Cowell the three-year ac

creditation status after a two-day,
on-site survey in May. The accred
itation is voluntary and shows
Cowell has met nationally recog
nized health care standards.
"Continue to do the good work
you are doing — I think we are re
ally making a quite a mark in col
lege health," Vice-Provost and
Dean for Student Affairs Mary Ed
monds said at the ceremony.
Ira Friedman, director of Cow
ell Student Health Services, said
before the ceremony that there are
no additional privileges associated
with the accreditation.
"The most important thing
about this [accreditation] is it doc
uments the quality of health care
here, and will help students to
have confidence in the health cen
ter," he said, adding that only a
minority of college health clinics
are accredited.
Addressing the 25 staff mem
bers present at the ceremony, he
explained, "When students come
into this building for health care
they do not often have exercised
choice in where they go for care.
That's why it's more important
that we are able to demonstrate
that they are getting quality care."
Accreditation reflects compli
ance with 14 chapters of standards
in the AAAHC accreditation man
ual and six chapters in the CMA
manual, covering areas such as pa
tients' rights, quality of care and
facilities and environment.
