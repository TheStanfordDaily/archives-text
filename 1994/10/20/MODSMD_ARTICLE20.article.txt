# Crew teams travel to Head of the Charles
## 
### Ezra Baylin 
The men's and women's Stanford
crew teams fly to Boston this weekend to
test their mettle against the top crews in
the world at the Head of the Charles
Regatta. Both squads are coming off
highly successful seasons, each with a
top-three finish in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence last year, and hope to pick up where
they left off this Sunday.
The women's varsity will race a sur
prisingly young boat this weekend, but
the program is by no means in a rebuild
ing year. The women's head coach, Joce
lyn McCandless, describes her varsity
boat as "young, but so good that any
thing is possible this year."
Four sophomores, two seniors and
two juniors will anchor the boat for

Stanford in the women's eight person
division at the Head of the Charles. This
is the first race of the season for the
youthful team, providing a perfect
opportunity to see if all of their 6 a.m.
workouts will pay off.
Also an integral part of the Cardinal
boat, sophomore coxswain Missy Keyes
serves as helms person, strategist and
motivator. She is not worried about her
young team's ability to perform well in
the race, but she stresses that the
"seniors and returning rowers have a lot
to teach the younger members of the
team."
As far as the Head of the Charles is
concerned, the coxswain feels that her
boat can be competitive if "they stay off
Harvard's pace in the beginning, but
really turn it on in the last 2000 meters."

'The satisfaction for
these rowers is strictly
personal'

A more experienced squad will anchor
the Cardinal men's boat in Boston, and
the team is looking to capitalize on the
leadership of several returning rowers.
After Stanford took third in the Pac-10
last year, the team feels it has the poten
tial to improve on the finish.
Wieslaw Kujda, head coach of the
men's program, said the two words that
describe his varsity boat are experience
and commitment. "Since there are no

scholarships for crew, the satisfaction
for these rowers is strictly personal," he
said.
As senior captain of the men's team,
Josh Burgel and the three other seniors
on the men's boat epitomize the com
mitment and dedication that give Stan
ford an excellent chance to surprise
some top-ranked crews this weekend in
Boston, according to Kujda.
Though this prestigious race repre
sents a big step for the program, it is just
the start of a long season. Men's and
women's boats will compete every week
end in November against traditional
Pac-10 rivals at Portland, Newport, and
San Mateo.
These fall regattas differ from cham
pionship races, held in the spring, in dis
tance and in importance. The three- to
four-mile fall races can last as long as 30
minutes for an eight person boat. The
spring races are much shorter, usually
2000 meters, and are finished by eight
person crews in less than seven minutes.
Even though the Head of the Charles
is the most widely known of the fall
regattas, it still does not count for inter
collegiate or Pac-10 rankings, so a poor
showing will not affect the teams' spring
records. Therefore, the Stanford crews
plan to use this weekend in Boston as a
chance to show the country what they
can do without jeopardizing their overall
ranking.
Though the Cardinal teams have
placed well at the Head of the Charles in
the past, the individual accomplish
ments of the coaches and former Cardi
nal members are equally impressive.

U.S. Olympic Team in 1988.
"All recent Olympic squads have
included at least one Stanford
rower," McCandless said. "Individu
ally, Stanford always produces some
of the top rowers in the country."
In addition, the Pac-10 coaches
recognized Kujda's efforts last
year by voting him 1994 Pac-10

Crew Coach of the Year. However,
Kujda said that he "would
exchange the award for first place
at the Pac-10 championships this
spring in a second, because my
most important statement is
through my rowers."
The steady leadership provided
by an experienced coaching stafT
has the potential to push Stanford
to a strong showing at the Head of
the Charles and into the spotlight
at the championship races this
spring.
