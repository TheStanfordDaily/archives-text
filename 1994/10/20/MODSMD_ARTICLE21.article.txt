# Hockey to Cal Invite
## 
### Ratha Harntha Contributing writer 
The Stanford field hockey
team looks to rebound from its 1-
0 loss to California last Saturday
when it faces Simon Fraser and
UC-Santa Barbara at Cal in this
weekend's California Invitational.
The Cardinal (5-7, 2-2 in the
Northern Pacific Conference) will
face both Simon Fraser and Santa
Barbara for the first time this
year â€” with very little knowledge
of either challenger.
"We need to play our game,"
said head coach Sheryl Johnson.
Luckily, the stakes are not too
risky as neither team is in NorPac
and the two games have no bear
ing on the Cardinal's playoff
chances.
Simon Fraser, a Canadian
team, comes down to play in the
California Invitational each year.
"It will be a really strong
match," said senior tri-captain
Tina Syer. "They're not a
pushover, but they're not amaz
ing either."
The Cardinal is looking to
improve its offensive strategy this
weekend to come away with two
wins. In the game against the
Golden Bears, the Cardinal was
unable to muster an attack, man
aging only two shots on goal in
Cal's shutout. Stanford consis
tently lost control of the ball
about 25 yards from the goal.
The Cardinal defense, led by
freshman goalie Kelly Nay lor, has
played solidly throughout the sea
son. Naylor's saves have resulted
in three shutouts this year, bol
stered by a defense which has
given up just 1.85 goals per game.
"Kelly has had an amazing
year," Syer said
The Cardinal will also have to
overcome the loss of junior mid
fielder Elise Morgan, who is out
for the season. Morgan injured
her knee on Oct. 7 in Stanford's 3-
0 win over Davis and Elkins Col
lege. She is scheduled to have
reconstructive knee surgery to
repair her partially torn lateral
collateral ligament.
