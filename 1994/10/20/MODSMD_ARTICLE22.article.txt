# Sailing hosts home Invite

### Daniel Kao Contributing writer 
After a tough weekend at the Navy Fall Invi
tational battling against the nation's best, the
Stanford sailing team is well-deserving of a brief
respite. Unfortunately this upcoming weekend
will bring no rest for the weary as the Cardinal
readies to host close to a dozen other Pacific
Coast teams at the Stanford Invitational in Red
wood City.
The California Golden Bears and the USC
Trojans are expected to pose the greatest chal
lenges, but neither team is likely to displace the
Cardinal as the toast of West Coast sailing. Nei
ther UC-Irvine nor Long Beach State, who earli
er in the season finished ahead of Stanford at the
Stoney Burke Invitational, are expected to com
pete this weekend. Therefore, much of Stanford's
competition will come from within the team.
The race, sailed with Flying Junior boats, will
feature two divisions, but unlimited entries of
ships may compete in each division. Coach Steve
Bourdow is expecting to sail everyone and stack
the divisions in order to establish a general feel
as far as the ranking of individual sailors.
"This is a good opportunity for me to estab
lish who will be sailing where/' Bourdow said.
"It's not as important for the top sailors because
they already know they stand, but for a lot of the
rest of the team, this a chance for me to rank
them."
But even many of the top sailors feel a sense
of competition in order to both solidify and pos
sibly advance their status on the team.
"This is a big race for just the team itself,"
said junior skipper Adam Lowry,
one of the team's top singlehand
ed Laser sailors. "It's a chance to
test the whole team, but also a
chance for the top four sailors to
prove that they're going to be the
top two guys sailing in other
regattas."
Because the race is only a Dis

trict event, not Intersectional,
there is little at stake as far as
national rankings. For those who
enjoy high stakes and high risk,
though, look no further than the
Women's Singlehanded Nationals
this weekend hosted by the Mas
sachusetts Institute of Technolo
gy, where sophomore Cardinal
skipper Alice Manard will face the
cream of the crop in women's col
legiate Laser sailing.
"Alice definitely has the ability
to finish in the top three," Bour

dow said. "She could even win, but
would need to sail really well."
To add to the excitement, the
regatta will be run on the tortu
ous Charles River, infamous for
its tricky conditions and ability to
make good sailors look bad. This
will also be Manard's first outing
on the Charles River.
"It's important for Alice to
focus on the tactical aspects, not
just the sailing," Bourdow said.
"She's a good Laser sailor but
when conditions change and get

strange, that doesn't mean as
much. The person who handles
the conditions well and who can
take the ups and downs of the
race will win."
St. Mary's highly-touted skip
per Danielle Brennan stands as
the favorite to capture the race, a
fact which does not scare Manard.
"I've sailed against all of them
and know how they sail," Manard
said. "I also know that I can do
well. All I'll say is that I have high
goals."
