# Sailing hosts home Invite
## 
### Daniel Kao Contributing writer 
After a tough weekend at the Navy Fall Invi
tational battling against the nation's best, the
Stanford sailing team is well-deserving of a brief
respite. Unfortunately this upcoming weekend
will bring no rest for the weary as the Cardinal
readies to host close to a dozen other Pacific
Coast teams at the Stanford Invitational in Red
wood City.
The California Golden Bears and the USC
Trojans are expected to pose the greatest chal
lenges, but neither team is likely to displace the
Cardinal as the toast of West Coast sailing. Nei
ther UC-Irvine nor Long Beach State, who earli
er in the season finished ahead of Stanford at the
Stoney Burke Invitational, are expected to com
pete this weekend. Therefore, much of Stanford's
competition will come from within the team.
The race, sailed with Flying Junior boats, will
feature two divisions, but unlimited entries of
ships may compete in each division. Coach Steve
Bourdow is expecting to sail everyone and stack
the divisions in order to establish a general feel
as far as the ranking of individual sailors.
"This is a good opportunity for me to estab
lish who will be sailing where/' Bourdow said.
"It's not as important for the top sailors because
they already know they stand, but for a lot of the
rest of the team, this a chance for me to rank
them."
But even many of the top sailors feel a sense
of competition in order to both solidify and pos
sibly advance their status on the team.
"This is a big race for just the team itself,"
