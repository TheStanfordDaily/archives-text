# Shaw a student of his sport
## Coach of No. 1 volleyball learns from the best 
### Jordan Wruble Staff writer 
As the 16-0 Cardinal women's volleyball squad
sails its way through NCAA competition this season,
the man at the helm is head coach Don Shaw.
"I love what I do," said Shaw, who is now in his
15th year at Stanford. It would be hard to argue
with him, considering the dedication he has shown
to his sport. In his early days, Shaw certainly put in
his time coaching both men and women: "I was here
19 hours a day."
One quarter, after he lost his housing and could
not afford rent elsewhere, Shaw permanently moved
to campus.
"For a while, I was living in my van with my dog
out behind Maples [Pavilion]," Shaw explained. "I
had a VW bus. .. . For a little variety, I'd go and park
it around different places on campus. I always got
rousted by the campus police."
Shaw has come a long way from those days, point
ing out that he could now sleep on the couch in his
office. His achievements stem from his devotion to
sports.
"[Coaching] is a labor of love," he said. "I think
that anybody can be successful if they get up in the
morning and they are pumped up about coming in
and doing what they do."
How does Shaw measure success? Citing the atti
tude of legendary basketball coach John Wooden,
"Success is peace of mind and knowing that you are
doing the best that you can."
It is not unusual for Shaw to seek such lessons
from other coaches. Shaw is an avid student of
coaching, studying the methods employed in a vari
ety of sports.
"My wife thinks I'm nuts because I have the TV
on way too much. A lot of time I'm watching games,
regardless of whatever sport it is, and watching the
coaches," Shaw said. "You watch a coach's
demeanor on the bench. You just kind of watch how
certain coaches react to their players. You watch tac
tical moves."
As an eager pupil, it is a pleasure and convenience
for Shaw to work amidst the great coaches here at
Stanford. "One of the reasons I love this place,"
Shaw said, "is because I'm surrounded by the best in

the business.
"When I first started working here, I went
around as much as I could and watched all the other
coaches run their practices. I've learned a lot just by
listening to them interact with their players in the
office. I'm just a sponge when it comes to that kind
of thing."
Like a student during finals, Shaw said he "did
all-nighters talking about coaching" with former co
coach Fred Sturm. "We basically ate, slept, lived,
breathed volleyball."
Now, other coaches come to him to learn what it
takes to win at this level. Shaw has a simple lesson
about how to act after winning a national champi
onship, like his team's victory in 1991 — "You party
like dogs."
Shaw is willing to show his emotion, unlike other
coaches whom he feels hide theirs. "I get pretty into
it. I'm emotional. When I get ticked off, I show it,"
Shaw said. "My players might say I'm a little too
involved or too competitive."
What else might his players say?
"They probably think I'm their mom or their dad
because I'm groaning and moaning about 'Pick up
after yourself and 'Be on time.'" Shaw's nagging is
part of a concerted effort to earn respect for his ath
letes.
"When we go on the road and we go use a locker
room, I want to leave that locker room cleaner than
it was when we got there," explained Shaw. "I want
the guy who cleans up to walk in there and say,
'That Stanford group — I really like those guys.'"
Interestingly, Shaw's toughest hardships as a
coach come from NCAA restrictions, including those
that limit the amount of practice time a team may
spend with a coach. Shaw says the NCAA has "taken
a lot of the fun out of coaching."
In Shaw's opinion, Stanford should not be
grouped with other schools.
"At Stanford, these athletes are students," he
said. "At a lot of other schools, they're trying to
make students out of some of these guys that have
no business being in school in the first place. I think
it's an insult to me to tell me that my athletes aren't
being students. . . . Sure, we put in our time, but I go

out of my way to make sure that
these guys get that college experi
ence."
To explain his point of view,
Shaw detailed the following sce
nario. "A player wants to come to
me and they are doing well in
school, and they've got a good
social life but they want to be a
top level international player and
go play on the national team. [If]
they want to come in and work
with me for an hour in February
once a week, I have to shut the
door on them and I can't work
with them. And that drives me
crazy," he said.
Shaw expressed frustration
toward the NCAA for preventing
him from providing that extra
help.
"[The NCAA] would never do
that for a teacher," he added. "If
someone wanted to go in to their
physics prof and say 'Hey, I need
an extra hour,' they'd be able to
do that."
For now, Shaw can spend all
the time he wants coaching his
daughter, Jordan.
"She's already got better skills
as a two-and-a-half-year-old than
a lot of other people I know,"
Shaw said of his little girl.
But it would be just fine with
the coach if she does not play her
father's sport. "She's a pretty
good singer and dancer," Shaw
claimed. "She can dance like
crazy."

about how to act after winning a national champi
onship, like his team's victory in 1991 — "You party
like dogs."
Shaw is willing to show his emotion, unlike other
coaches whom he feels hide theirs. "I get pretty into
it. I'm emotional. When I get ticked off, I show it,"
Shaw said. "My players might say I'm a little too
involved or too competitive."
What else might his players say?
"They probably think I'm their mom or their dad
because I'm groaning and moaning about 'Pick up
after yourself and 'Be on time.'" Shaw's nagging is
part of a concerted effort to earn respect for his ath
letes.
"When we go on the road and we go use a locker
room, I want to leave that locker room cleaner than
it was when we got there," explained Shaw. "I want
the guy who cleans up to walk in there and say,
'That Stanford group — I really like those guys.'"
Interestingly, Shaw's toughest hardships as a
coach come from NCAA restrictions, including those
that limit the amount of practice time a team may
spend with a coach. Shaw says the NCAA has "taken
a lot of the fun out of coaching."
In Shaw's opinion, Stanford should not be
grouped with other schools.
"At Stanford, these athletes are students," he
said. "At a lot of other schools, they're trying to
make students out of some of these guys that have
no business being in school in the first place. I think
it's an insult to me to tell me that my athletes aren't
being students. . . . Sure, we put in our time, but I go

out of my way to make sure that
these guys get that college experi
ence."
To explain his point of view,
Shaw detailed the following sce
nario. "A player wants to come to
me and they are doing well in
school, and they've got a good
social life but they want to be a
top level international player and
go play on the national team. [If]
they want to come in and work
with me for an hour in February
once a week, I have to shut the
door on them and I can't work
with them. And that drives me
crazy," he said.
Shaw expressed frustration
toward the NCAA for preventing
him from providing that extra
help.
"[The NCAA] would never do
that for a teacher," he added. "If
someone wanted to go in to their
physics prof and say 'Hey, I need
an extra hour,' they'd be able to
do that."
For now, Shaw can spend all
the time he wants coaching his
daughter, Jordan.
"She's already got better skills
as a two-and-a-half-year-old than
a lot of other people I know,"
Shaw said of his little girl.
But it would be just fine with
the coach if she does not play her
father's sport. "She's a pretty
good singer and dancer," Shaw
claimed. "She can dance like
crazy."
As the 16-0 Cardinal women's volleyball squad
sails its way through NCAA competition this season,
the man at the helm is head coach Don Shaw.
"I love what I do," said Shaw, who is now in his
15th year at Stanford. It would be hard to argue
with him, considering the dedication he has shown
to his sport. In his early days, Shaw certainly put in
his time coaching both men and women: "I was here
19 hours a day."
One quarter, after he lost his housing and could
not afford rent elsewhere, Shaw permanently moved
to campus.
"For a while, I was living in my van with my dog
out behind Maples [Pavilion]," Shaw explained. "I
had a VW bus. .. . For a little variety, I'd go and park
it around different places on campus. I always got
rousted by the campus police."
Shaw has come a long way from those days, point
ing out that he could now sleep on the couch in his
office. His achievements stem from his devotion to
sports.
"[Coaching] is a labor of love," he said. "I think
that anybody can be successful if they get up in the
morning and they are pumped up about coming in
and doing what they do."
How does Shaw measure success? Citing the atti
tude of legendary basketball coach John Wooden,
"Success is peace of mind and knowing that you are
doing the best that you can."
It is not unusual for Shaw to seek such lessons
from other coaches. Shaw is an avid student of
coaching, studying the methods employed in a vari
ety of sports.
"My wife thinks I'm nuts because I have the TV
on way too much. A lot of time I'm watching games,
regardless of whatever sport it is, and watching the
coaches," Shaw said. "You watch a coach's
demeanor on the bench. You just kind of watch how
certain coaches react to their players. You watch tac
tical moves."
As an eager pupil, it is a pleasure and convenience
for Shaw to work amidst the great coaches here at
Stanford. "One of the reasons I love this place,"
Shaw said, "is because I'm surrounded by the best in

the business.
"When I first started working here, I went
around as much as I could and watched all the other
coaches run their practices. I've learned a lot just by
listening to them interact with their players in the
office. I'm just a sponge when it comes to that kind
of thing."
Like a student during finals, Shaw said he "did
all-nighters talking about coaching" with former co
coach Fred Sturm. "We basically ate, slept, lived,
breathed volleyball."
