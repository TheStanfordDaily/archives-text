# 'She's broken through'
## Poehler rises to long-awaited challenge 
### Jeremy Stone Staff writer 
For the past three seasons,
Jennifer Poehler sat on the bench
while her good friend Leslie Gar
rard started at goal for the Stan
ford women's soccer team. If
Stanford had a tremendous lead,
then Poehler would complete the
shut-out. That trend was expect
ed to continue in 1994.
"Weird things happen,"
Poehler said. "Leslie got hurt, and
there I was."
Garrard suffered a shoulder
injury before the beginning of the
current season, and for the first
time in her Stanford career,
Poehler found herself in a start
ing role.
The Altadena, Calif., native
had not started since high school,
when she earned All-League hon
ors all four years en route to 37
shutouts. Prior to high school,
Poehler had only played goalie for
a couple years.
"[l've played] since I was 12 or
13," she said. "I just decided one
day I would try it out. It seemed
kind of fun. I think at first every
one's kind of scared of it because
of hitting the ground. Now it's
kind of normal. You have to have
kind of an attitude."
That attitude has carried
Poehler to new heights in 1994.
She had never allowed a goal until
this year, but even when Stanford
won its first nine games and
Poehler was ranked third in the
nation in goalkeeping, the naysay
ers claimed she had not been test
ed. Last weekend's Texas Chal
lenge Tournament, when the Car
dinal played No. 5 Duke and No. 1
North Carolina, provided the
measuring stick to gauge just how
far Poehler had come.
"I had a lot more shots than I'd
ever had before," said the senior.
After registering only 19 saves
in her career prior to the tourna
ment, Poehler notched 21 in the
two games. She allowed an incon
sequential goal to Duke just before
the buzzer and only a fluke score
to the highest scoring offense in
the nation, North Carolina.
Poehler spoke more of the

team's performance in the horrif
ic rainy conditions than her own.
"In some ways, it gives me a lot
of hope, because I think that if
we're able to play our game
against them, we'll be able to beat
them," she said.
Head coach lan Sawyers, simi
larity pleased with the team's
effort, expressed delight with
Poehler's emergence.
"She was outstanding in both
games," Sawyers said. "There
were a lot of alumni there who'd
seen Jennifer play since her fresh
man year. They were so delighted
for her — they were so impressed
with her development.
"If there's any good thing
about a player stepping in for an
injured player, it's that she finally
gets a chance to prove herself.
When you're up against some of
the best teams in the country, she
stepped in and she proved it. And
she has nothing to prove any
more to herself or the team or to
me or to the school. She's broken
through, and it's great to see a
player develop like that."
Poehler was not even second
string until 1993, but that never
stopped her from contributing in
practice.
"I just trusted lan's and
Berhane's [Andeberhan, head
coach for Poehler's first two sea
sons while Sawyers was an assis
tant! decisions about what was
best for the team and just tried to
do what I could to help make the
team better, to make Leslie bet
ter," she said. "It was a hard posi
tion to be in, but I love the team
and I knew that if I was called on,
I would help the team in any way
I could."
Poehler's attitude as a back-up
did not go unnoticed, according to
Sawyers.
"The thing that I was really
impressed with over the last three
years was Jenn's ability to be able
to still contribute to the team
chemistry while fully realizing
that her playing time was going to
be limited behind the top keeper,"
Sawyers said. "That takes a very
special type of personality."
Assistant coach Sarah Rafanel
li, who played with Poehler those

three years, agreed.
"Throughout all the years,
she's been a leader by setting an
example with her work ethic. She
always comes to practice ready to
work regardless of the situation,"
Rafanelli said. "Now to go to her
senior year with having just one
keeper is obviously a big differ
ence.
"There's a lot more pressure
on her because not only does she
have to make all the saves, she
can't get hurt while she does it.
Lan and I have both been really
impressed with her ability to just
shrug it off and still get the job
done," she added.
Poehler has a 0.455 goals
against average, tops in the West
Region and fifth in the nation.
She also had a scoreless streak of
more than eight hours earlier in
the season. However, like the rest

of the team, she is not impressed
by these numbers.
"I try not to focus on stats that
much," she said. "I think playing
for the team would definitely
motivate me more than any stats
could ever do. Just knowing that I
carry those people's dreams with
me every time I walk on the field,
that's much more important than
any stats could ever be."
With her selfless, team-orient
ed outlook, Poehler embodies the
closeness of the Cardinal team.
"The people on this team are
my best friends on and off the
field," she said. "When I step on
the field to play with them, I know
that they're going to fight for me
and I'll fight for them. That's an
important part of why we're doing
well. Because we find a way to
make it work together."
Off the field, Poehler finds

ways to stay busy as well. She is
currently applying to medical
school with a double major in biol
ogy and feminist studies, focusing
on women's health. She works in
a laboratory at a hospital and is a
member of Athletes in Action.
"That's about all I have time for,"
she said.
Fortunately for Stanford, she
also has time to be the new start
ing goalkeeper. True to her
nature, she has taken the change
of circumstances in stride.
"The whole injury situation is
surprising," she said. "But as far
as what's happened since then,
no, it doesn't surprise me. I'm
pretty religious or faithful, and
my philosophy about life is that
it's just part of the plan for me.
I'm just trying to live it out, to
take the opportunities I'm given
and make the best of them."

tion to be in, but I love the team
and I knew that if I was called on,
I would help the team in any way
I could."
Poehler's attitude as a back-up
did not go unnoticed, according to
Sawyers.
"The thing that I was really
impressed with over the last three
years was Jenn's ability to be able
to still contribute to the team
chemistry while fully realizing
that her playing time was going to
be limited behind the top keeper,"
Sawyers said. "That takes a very
special type of personality."
Assistant coach Sarah Rafanel
li, who played with Poehler those

three years, agreed.
"Throughout all the years,
she's been a leader by setting an
example with her work ethic. She
always comes to practice ready to
work regardless of the situation,"
Rafanelli said. "Now to go to her
senior year with having just one
keeper is obviously a big differ
ence.
"There's a lot more pressure
on her because not only does she
have to make all the saves, she
can't get hurt while she does it.
Lan and I have both been really
impressed with her ability to just
shrug it off and still get the job
done," she added.
Poehler has a 0.455 goals
against average, tops in the West
Region and fifth in the nation.
She also had a scoreless streak of
more than eight hours earlier in
the season. However, like the rest

of the team, she is not impressed
by these numbers.
"I try not to focus on stats that
much," she said. "I think playing
for the team would definitely
motivate me more than any stats
could ever do. Just knowing that I
carry those people's dreams with
me every time I walk on the field,
that's much more important than
any stats could ever be."
With her selfless, team-orient
ed outlook, Poehler embodies the
closeness of the Cardinal team.
"The people on this team are
my best friends on and off the
field," she said. "When I step on
the field to play with them, I know
that they're going to fight for me
and I'll fight for them. That's an
important part of why we're doing
well. Because we find a way to
make it work together."
Off the field, Poehler finds

ways to stay busy as well. She is
currently applying to medical
school with a double major in biol
ogy and feminist studies, focusing
on women's health. She works in
a laboratory at a hospital and is a
member of Athletes in Action.
"That's about all I have time for,"
she said.
Fortunately for Stanford, she
also has time to be the new start
ing goalkeeper. True to her
nature, she has taken the change
of circumstances in stride.
"The whole injury situation is
surprising," she said. "But as far
as what's happened since then,
no, it doesn't surprise me. I'm
pretty religious or faithful, and
my philosophy about life is that
it's just part of the plan for me.
I'm just trying to live it out, to
take the opportunities I'm given
and make the best of them."

Assuming her new role as starting goalkeeper for the Cardinal women's soccer team, Jennifer Poehler
poses behind the net that she guards with skill and success.
For the past three seasons,
Jennifer Poehler sat on the bench
while her good friend Leslie Gar
rard started at goal for the Stan
ford women's soccer team. If
Stanford had a tremendous lead,
then Poehler would complete the
shut-out. That trend was expect
ed to continue in 1994.
"Weird things happen,"
Poehler said. "Leslie got hurt, and
there I was."
Garrard suffered a shoulder
injury before the beginning of the
current season, and for the first
time in her Stanford career,
Poehler found herself in a start
ing role.
The Altadena, Calif., native
had not started since high school,
when she earned All-League hon
ors all four years en route to 37
shutouts. Prior to high school,
Poehler had only played goalie for
a couple years.
"[l've played] since I was 12 or
13," she said. "I just decided one
day I would try it out. It seemed
kind of fun. I think at first every
one's kind of scared of it because
of hitting the ground. Now it's
kind of normal. You have to have
kind of an attitude."
That attitude has carried
Poehler to new heights in 1994.
She had never allowed a goal until
this year, but even when Stanford
won its first nine games and
Poehler was ranked third in the
nation in goalkeeping, the naysay
ers claimed she had not been test
ed. Last weekend's Texas Chal
lenge Tournament, when the Car
dinal played No. 5 Duke and No. 1
North Carolina, provided the
measuring stick to gauge just how
far Poehler had come.
"I had a lot more shots than I'd
ever had before," said the senior.
After registering only 19 saves
in her career prior to the tourna
ment, Poehler notched 21 in the
two games. She allowed an incon
sequential goal to Duke just before
the buzzer and only a fluke score
to the highest scoring offense in
the nation, North Carolina.
Poehler spoke more of the

team's performance in the horrif
ic rainy conditions than her own.
"In some ways, it gives me a lot
of hope, because I think that if
we're able to play our game
against them, we'll be able to beat
them," she said.
Head coach lan Sawyers, simi
larity pleased with the team's
effort, expressed delight with
Poehler's emergence.
"She was outstanding in both
games," Sawyers said. "There
were a lot of alumni there who'd
seen Jennifer play since her fresh
man year. They were so delighted
for her — they were so impressed
with her development.
"If there's any good thing
about a player stepping in for an
injured player, it's that she finally
gets a chance to prove herself.
When you're up against some of
the best teams in the country, she
stepped in and she proved it. And
she has nothing to prove any
more to herself or the team or to
me or to the school. She's broken
through, and it's great to see a
player develop like that."
Poehler was not even second
string until 1993, but that never
stopped her from contributing in
practice.
"I just trusted lan's and
Berhane's [Andeberhan, head
coach for Poehler's first two sea
sons while Sawyers was an assis
tant! decisions about what was
best for the team and just tried to
do what I could to help make the
team better, to make Leslie bet
ter," she said. "It was a hard posi
tion to be in, but I love the team
and I knew that if I was called on,
I would help the team in any way
