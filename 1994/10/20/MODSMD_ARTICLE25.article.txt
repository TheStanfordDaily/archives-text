# A 						friendly guide to the basics of frisbee golf
## 
### Zachary Foreman 
The Stanford Frisbee Golf Course has
been passed down orally from player to play
er for the last 20 years, and therefore is a
model of flexibility.
Although there is an "official" starting
point, the course is a circuit and so can be
started from any hole. Not even the great
quake of '89 could stop it; two holes just had
to be relocated.
A golfer pressed for time could try a nine
hole course. A solo par run might take as lit
tle as 45 minutes, but a group of nine in var
ious states of inebriation might take over two
hours.
First, the rules. (Rules and description
were compiled by the Stanford Axe Commit
tee in the 1993-94 Handbook of Stanford
University.)
1. Tee off from anywhere behind the
imaginary line drawn between two objects
which represent the tee of area.
2. A player may approach the hole from
any direction as long as there is no violation
of tee-off (except hole 12).
3. Each shot should be played with one
foot remaining where the frisbee landed,
including water hazards and obstacles but
not trees. No take-overs or "gimmies"
allowed.
4. You are permitted to move anything
physically blocking play, provided that it can
be moved (short of dynamiting). Also known
as the "If-it's-not bolted-down rule".
5. If an unwary spectator moves the fris
bee, scold the culprit profusely, then replace
the frisbee and continue play.
6. Completion of a hole occurs when the
frisbee makes contact with the hole, with
the exception of an archway, in which case
it passes through. For holes on the
ground, the frisbee must land completely
within the border described (holes 6, 9,
and 13).
7. Any type of non-motorized frisbee and
throwing technique is permitted. The Stan
ford "Ultimate 101" is the most popular type.
In addition to these seven rules, there are
a few rules of etiquette:
1. Let a small group play through.
2. Never, ever leave your disc behind
unless you have in good faith attempted to
retrieve it or find it for at least an hour.
3. Always let the person furthest from the
hole throw first.
The following is a description of the
course, along with helpful hints provided by
veteran golfers C.D. Khopkar, Brian Kum
nick and Roger Kurtz. Par is in parentheses.
Hole 1 (6): Tee off between the rear of 553
Mayfield and Mariposa House at the nea -

Part II of II

est Marguerite bus-stop and parking lot
entrance, facing Kresge. Hole is "Le Fau
con" sculpture on opposite side of the law
school. "A long and difficult hole. Consid
er playing it around the left side of Kres
ge, since the corridor through the Law
School is better there. Be warned . . . bicy
cles can severely inhibit the motion of
frisbees."
Hole 2 (4): Tee off directly in front of "Le
Faucon" between the two nearest lamps fac
ing Meyer. The hole is the sign set into the
ascending stairs of Meyer's side staircase.
"Straight and long. Watch out for sprin
klers."
Hole 3 (5): Tee off anywhere on balcony of
Meyer's grand staircase. Hole is Engineering
Corner archway (either direction). "A beau
ty. Just huck. And remember the Jeev prin
ciple: do not hit the clock tower face with the
disc."
Hole 4 (4): Tee off from left side of Engi
neering corner and nearest lamp. Hole is
first palm tree on grass to the right, in the
direction of Geology Corner behind Mem
Chu. "Better to land the disc way left, near
the engineering buildings, than way right, in
the arcade by the Quad. Especially if the
sprinklers are on. And DAMN THAT
TREE!!!"
Hole 5 (5): Tee off from right-most manhole
of four to left of fourth hole when facing
Geology Corner. Hole is fourth lamp, locat
ed on grassy slope between Geology Corner

and Mitchell Building. "One word: boring
and a pain."
Hole 6 (3): Tee off from bottom of right stair
case when facing Mitchell, near fifth hole.
Hole is on right side of Mitchell in concrete
square bordered by brick 10 feet from Rm.
134. "With proper curvature, an ace can be
had. Use the bike rack to stop your disc on
the proper square."
Hole 7 (4): Tee off from bottom of brick
stairs between Durand and Mitchell build
ings. Hole is Terman Engineering Build
ing's fourth middle concrete support direct
ly ahead and furthest from tee. "Ifyou can't
throw really far, try to hit the ramp on the
left side of the fairway and slide the disc up
to the pavement on front of Terman. Essen
tial for shaving a stroke off your score: avoid
the two massive pits on either side of the
stairs or you had better have a decent ham
mer."
Hole 8 (2 ): Tee off on grated air vent at top of
stairs facing Durand. Hole is the light-post
adjacent to nearest corner of Green Earth
Sciences Building. "Just hope for par. A mon
strous tee and a good putt help. (Note: It has
been done!)"
Hole 9 (3): Tee off at top of stairs in front
of Green Earth Sciences. I lole is the large
rock through archway and directly to the
right (toward Durand) next to edge of
pathway. "Beware the vicious chasms in
the basement of Green. Remember the
doors are generally locked (and alarmed)
during regular Frisbee Golf hours. If
you're a wimp, go around the outside of the
building and settle for par, rather than lose
vour disc."

Hole 10 (4): Tee off on walkway to first-floor
deck of Durand (nearest Green). Hole is any
part of the inside of stairwell on far side of
Mitchell next to dumpster, facing Bldg. 550.
"The toughest hole. Throw straight and low.
Beware the two Pits of Despair on the right.
Don't get frustrated."
Hole 11 (3): Tee off between tenth hole and
side of Mitchell (near gas meter). Hole is
fliered kiosk beside Geology Corner Arch

lous shots here so don't worry if you have a
bad tee shot."
Hole 12 (4): Tee off between kiosk and Geol
ogy Corner Archway. Hole is black side of
Aleber's Wall between Physics tank and the
Quad. "The secret is to make the disc skip
and slide along the pavement."
Hole 13 (5): Tee off between two book end
like embellishments at end of open corridor
on Quad's west entrance. Hole is center
stone of Rosette in middle of Quad. "The
most beautiful hole. If tee shot gets through
archway then you're on your way. It must
stay within circular stone in the exact center
of the Quad."
Hole 14 (5): Tee off from Rosette. Hole is tree
(trunk only) in courtyard by the corner, near

and Cubberly. "Dog-leg. Throw low and
hard."
Hole 16 (3): Tee off between Clock Tower and
Building 500 on manhole closest to Claw
Fountain. Hole is Claw fountain or lip of
basin. "Two words: Straight hucks. Oh, come

Hole 17 (4): Tee off between right edge of
Bookstore stairs (when facing Bookstore)
and Claw. Hole is lamp furthest to left
between the rear of the liookstore and the
post office, near fire hydrant. "Plenty of
choices for the tee shot. Our expert recom
mends blading the disk over the Bookstore.
You can also go around trees or through
them. Remember to check your mail after
this hole."
Hole 18 (4): Tee off from railing of post office
loading dock, near 17th hole. Hole is Swiss
cheese-like sculpture in Benjamin Crocker
Garden (the inside courtyard) of Law School.

The Stanford Frisbee Golf Course has
been passed down orally from player to play
er for the last 20 years, and therefore is a
model of flexibility.
Although there is an "official" starting
point, the course is a circuit and so can be
started from any hole. Not even the great
quake of '89 could stop it; two holes just had
to be relocated.
A golfer pressed for time could try a nine
hole course. A solo par run might take as lit
tle as 45 minutes, but a group of nine in var
ious states of inebriation might take over two
hours.
First, the rules. (Rules and description
were compiled by the Stanford Axe Commit
tee in the 1993-94 Handbook of Stanford
University.)
1. Tee off from anywhere behind the
imaginary line drawn between two objects
which represent the tee of area.
2. A player may approach the hole from
any direction as long as there is no violation
of tee-off (except hole 12).
3. Each shot should be played with one
foot remaining where the frisbee landed,
including water hazards and obstacles but
not trees. No take-overs or "gimmies"
allowed.
4. You are permitted to move anything
physically blocking play, provided that it can
be moved (short of dynamiting). Also known
as the "If-it's-not bolted-down rule".
5. If an unwary spectator moves the fris
bee, scold the culprit profusely, then replace
the frisbee and continue play.
6. Completion of a hole occurs when the
frisbee makes contact with the hole, with
the exception of an archway, in which case
it passes through. For holes on the
ground, the frisbee must land completely
within the border described (holes 6, 9,
and 13).
7. Any type of non-motorized frisbee and
throwing technique is permitted. The Stan
ford "Ultimate 101" is the most popular type.
In addition to these seven rules, there are
a few rules of etiquette:
1. Let a small group play through.
2. Never, ever leave your disc behind
unless you have in good faith attempted to
retrieve it or find it for at least an hour.
3. Always let the person furthest from the
hole throw first.
The following is a description of the
course, along with helpful hints provided by
veteran golfers C.D. Khopkar, Brian Kum
nick and Roger Kurtz. Par is in parentheses.

School is better there. Be warned . . . bicy
cles can severely inhibit the motion of
frisbees."
Hole 2 (4): Tee off directly in front of "Le

the proper square."
Hole 7 (4): Tee off from bottom of brick
stairs between Durand and Mitchell build

throw really far, try to hit the ramp on the
left side of the fairway and slide the disc up
to the pavement on front of Terman. Essen
tial for shaving a stroke off your score: avoid
the two massive pits on either side of the
stairs or you had better have a decent ham
mer."
Hole 8 (2 ): Tee off on grated air vent at top of
stairs facing Durand. Hole is the light-post
adjacent to nearest corner of Green Earth
Sciences Building. "Just hope for par. A mon

been done!)"
Hole 9 (3): Tee off at top of stairs in front
of Green Earth Sciences. I lole is the large
rock through archway and directly to the
right (toward Durand) next to edge of

doors are generally locked (and alarmed)
during regular Frisbee Golf hours. If
you're a wimp, go around the outside of the
building and settle for par, rather than lose
vour disc."

Hole 10 (4): Tee off on walkway to first-floor
deck of Durand (nearest Green). Hole is any
part of the inside of stairwell on far side of
