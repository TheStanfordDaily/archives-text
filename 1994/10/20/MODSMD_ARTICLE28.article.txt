# Stanford Theatre presents
## Warner Brothers Before the CODE 
### Abhi Katyal 
Dames: like you've never seen them
before," reads as an enticing sub
title in the preview for "Footlight
Parade," one of the four final movies showing
in the Stanford Theatres currently running
"Warner Brothers Before the Production
Code" Festival.
The featured films, mad? befo-e the 1934
Production Code, an industry-wide system of
self-censorship, were not always overtly sexy,
violent or racy, but have to themselves a very
realistic, oftentimes playfully flirtatious or
suggestive depiction of reality.
The code came about as a result of some of
the films produced during the early years of
the Depression. The more creative and inter
esting of these films came from the Warner
Brothers Studios. They are exciting to watch
despite, at times, their obviously limited
budgets and fast, sloppy film-making.
Though the theater is at the end of its run, the
festival still has some of its classics remain
ing, namely "Footlight Parade", "Blonde
Crazy", "Three on a Match" and "Beauty and
the Boss"
Jimmy Cagney stars in the first two movies.
"Footlight Parade" is his first foray into musi
cal films, where he displays his versatility by
singing and dancing in one of the Busby
Burkeley dance extravaganzas staged at the
end of the film.
The pathetically laughable plot is deinitely
not the reason for the movie's success. Its rele
vance to film buffs lies in its three Berkeley
dance extravaganzas. Most importantly the
"Waterfall Sequence" — which left me hoping
for Esther Williams to appear amidst the cho
rus girls who perform the strangest, neatest
under-water acrobatics set to music.
Also of interest is the "Shanghai Lil"
dance-drama, which is not only offensive to
the Asian community (with Ruby Keeler in
yellow-face and fake "Oriental accent") but is
an interesting fore-runner, or if not a fore
runner, then an example of what "Miss
Saigon" might have looked like had it been
produced in the early thirties. The third

by "Casablanca" and "Maltese Falcon."

dance production, or "prologue," as it is called
in the film, is a racy musical number called
'Honeymoon Hotel'. Its suggestiveness is star
ding.
The film's appeal also lies in the issues it
brings up indirectly — the depiction of
women, how they should look, what they
should be like, how they should think, and fi
nally, how they should help men overcome
their personal and professional problems.
These issues are conveyed not only by the pre
sentation of the chorus girls and their activities
and costumes during the dance numbers, but
also by the two main female characters in the
film, played by Ruby Keeler and Joan Blondell.
Keeler and Blondell are more impressive
than Cagney, who seems out of his element in
some extremely sketchy plot twists and dia
logues.
Those unfamiliar with Blondell's work
should not miss the "Footlight Parade" and
"Blond Crazy" double feature playing from the
22nd to the 25th of October. These are her last
appearances in the festival (along with "Three
on a Match" playing with "Beauty and the
Boss" from the 26th to the 28th).

If for nothing else, go see the "Footlight Pa
rade" in order to enjoy the creative and imag
inative genius of Berkeley, which shines
through in the astonishing "waterfall se
quence."
"Blonde Crazy", the film showing along
with "Footlight Parade" captures Cagney and
Blondell doing what they do best, playing off
each other in a delightful comedy.
The pre-1934 films showing at the fes
tival also display the rise and making
of later Hollywood mega-stars. Not
only did they give actors and actresses like
Cagney, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., Joan Blondell,
and Edward G. Robinson some of their finest
roles, but they also launched and developed
the careers of to-be-stars, such as Loretta
Young, Bette Davis and Flumphrey Bogart.
Davis and Bogart appear in Mervyn Leßoy's
"Three on a Match," although both have only
small roles. Although certainly not a classic,
the melodrama showcases excellent perfor
mances by Blondell and Ann Dvorak.
"Three on a Match" brings out some inter
esting ideas on the perception of morality,

again focusing on the role of women in society
and what was acceptable for them to do and
not to do. The film develops its plot on the su
perstition that the third person to light a ciga
rette with the same match is doomed.
The story is strong but deliberately tear
jerking. While Davis and Bogart are interest
ing to watch, especially since neither appear
entirely comfortable with their roles, Bette
Davis is stiff and unsure. She pales in front of
Blondell and Dvorak, whose acting styles are
so very different from the one that Davis later
displayed as a leading lady herself.
Bogart is another story. The slouch is
there, as is the lisp — but he is wooden as a
baseball bat. The gangster image is coming
through, but how this man evolved into Rick
Blaine in "Casablanca" is a story 1 would like
to hear.
The Stanford Theatre makes a comfortable
transition into its annual run of that most fa
mous Bogart-Warner Brothers film of all,
"Casablanca", the week after the festival ends.
"Casablanca" will show on a double bill with
another Bogart classic, "The Maltese Falcon"
starting October 29th. ■
