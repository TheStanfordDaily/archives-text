# 'The need to create...'
## The 						Emeryville Art Festival a focus on dance 
### Danielle Goldman 
Year after year dancers flock to New York.
Unlike top male athletes in our society,
even the best dancers will have to work
multiple jobs. So why brave the subways and
smog? Why move far from home?
Out of necessity. Driven by a need to create
through dance, men and women seek perfor
mance opportunities. The Hmeryville Art Exhi
bition offers its local dancers a treasured
chance to perform.
A small sign directs the interested few to the
Emeryville Art Exhibition. From the outside,
the sign distinguishes the exhibition from a
mere warehouse on a dusty Emeryville back
road.
The inside, however, bears no resemblance
to a traditional warehouse. Light, filtered
through skylights and wooden beams, talis on
art-lined walls. Sculptures rise from cold ce
ment floors. Families saunter through the ex
hibit in support of local artists. Rather than set
a traditional stage, this relaxed exhibit provides
a unique space for Nancy Karp and I )ancers.
WHAT: The Eighth Annual Emeryville
Art Exhibition
WHEN: Through October 30,11 a.m. to 6
p.m. daily. Dance performances on Sun
days, October 23 and 30 at 2 p.m.
WFIERE: 1450 64th St., Emeryville
HOW MUCH: Free. Call (510) 652-6122
for more information.

As the performance begins, some gather
to watch while others continue to roam the
exhibit. Karp's cast of five middle-aged
dancers wear makeshift yellow costumes
and tennis shoes. Whereas in a theater such
costuming can deter from a performance, it
only adds to the Emeryville Art Exhibition's
charm. Although unable to afford lavish cos
tumes, the company achieves some degree of
uniformity through its yellow clothing.
While costuming affects a piece, choreog
raphy and movement make or break it. Sur
rounded by beautiful artwork and music,
these dancers fail to connect with either. Be
cause Karp began the piece before the exhib
it's completion, the space and the surround
ing artwork were a complete surprise. Al
though she later made choreographic alter
ations, the sculptures remain unrelated ob
jects rather than a meaningful part of the
piece. A sense of connectedness with the
dancers' surroundings would have given their
movements some of the fullness they lacked.
Despite this lack of fluidity, Nancy Karp
presents a refreshingly seasoned company. The
middle-aged dancers bring invaluable life ex
perience and maturity to movement that few
pre-pubescent ballerinas possess. As opposed
to ballet, which has been largely shaped by Bal
anchine's narrow conception of the aesthetical
ly ideal dancer, modern dance allows for ditler
ent bodies and different ages.
Although modern dance welcomes an expe
rienced company, the best performances de

mand technique and powerful movement. The
body is the dancer's instrument and as the spir
it matures, the body inevitably ages. It was dif
ficult to determine whether Karp's dancers'
bodies or inner timidity limited them, but they
never pushed boundaries or took risks in their
movement. The energy level remained con
stant and therefore dull.
Dancers, whether by title or just at heart.

should not need New York City in order to cre
ate. Similarly, people's experiences with dance
should not require a trip across the country.
Capturing the spirit of the Emeryville Art Exhi
bition, artist Cay Lang states "this need to cre
ate is a gift, a miracle. It is central to what being
is about."
