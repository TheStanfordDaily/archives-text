The locomotive of democracy may be chugging
through South Africa, but American lawyer Carole
Baeky warns that the country's massive rural popu
lation is in danger of not getting aboard.
Baeky, who is speaking to various groups at Stan
ford this week at the request of the Bechtel Center,
the School of Education, and the Center for Interna
tional Security and Arms Control, founded the Com
munity Law Center in KwaZulu-Natal in 1989.
The center works to build a structure that gives
rural South Africans — who make up roughly half of
the country's population — access to the money, in
formation and legal structures which have long been
focused in the country's cities.
Drawing on her experience with working to legally
empower Alaskans and other Native Americans, Baeky
said it is impossible to thrust Western ideas of democ
racy into a tribal culture and expect them to work.
"You must find what the people themselves expect
from the system," Baeky said, "and then [hopefully]
empower them to get that."
Training people to work as paralegals back in their
own communities, the Community Law Center has
expanded to serve two million rural and tribal resi
dents in KwaZulu and the Eastern Cape provinces.
Over 90 percent of community legal cases are han
dled by local paralegals, with the balance coming to
the center's headquarters in Durbin.

Baeky said while the center initially focused on
tasks such as securing old age and disability pension
arrears for rural residents, its work became more
dangerous this year when it moved into educating
voters in the Inkatha-dominated Zulu province.
"[South Africa] missed a civil war by a couple of
days," Baeky said of the tense negotiations before the
April election.
With the coming of democracy, however, Baeky
said the center's task has become even more difficult.
Expectations are rising among rural people about the
benefits the new government will bring.
This is the same government, Baeky added, that
neither contacted anyone in the rural areas when
drafting the interim constitution, nor makes any ef
fort to educate rural and tribal peoples about their
new rights.
"How are you going to have a bill of rights that
works," Baeky asked, "when people don't know what
rights are supposed to be enforced?"
Meanwhile, the threat is grave for all non-govern
mental organizations, Baeky said. A new law requires
that all organizations be licensed and that all funding
for such organizations pass through the government.
Any organization the government does not approve
of will be abolished.
Even as the work and the challenges of the center
expand, Baeky's resolve to keep the center as organic
