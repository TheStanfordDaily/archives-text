# Paul Reiser He's not that short
## 
### Michael Green 
It's a funny thing for someone who has fol
lowed and enjoyed Paul Reiser's career to
actually meet him. Because it becomes
abruptly apparent that he isn't short.
At all.
Hard to believe, but he's actually pretty
tall, and somewhat confident too.
Maybe it's the transition to the literary
scene which is giving Paul Reiser this new
ability to talk without whining. Maybe it's a
hit TV show which is helping him consoli
date an affected nerd-boy image into a char
acter, not a personality.
Hither way he's intelligentsia now — he's
signing books.
Daily: How did the book conic about — did
you Mike up one day and think, "/ think I'll
write a book now?"
Reiser: 1 woke up and realized that I had
accidentally written a book. You know
sometimes you get a thought in your head. I
had exactly a whole book's worth. I even had
the photos and everything, all glossies. I
thought, 'I shouldn't leave all this lying
around the house' so I called someone and
said 'We'll sell it to American people.'
And American people have bought the
book.
Yes, several American people have bought
the book.
Hair you been amazed by the response?
I'm quite tickled by how many people
have bought it — people I don't even know.
These are not just relatives and people I went
to school with. These are like strangers who
went into the store and bought it.
Just open up any old page of "Couple
hood" and the meter of his k vet ching be
comes charmingly salient. Reading the
inside flap is enough to make you buy it. 1 le
even makes it easy to get into — the page
numbers begin at 145, because, "I know that
when I'm reading, I love being smack in the
middle of the book."
Reiser's "Couplehood" is the third in a
relatively new genre of bit-ish comedy nar
ratives in print, bill Cosby's "Fatherhood"
happened first, but the trend seems to have
taken hold via Jerry's "SeinLanguage". Tim
Allen's (of "Home Improvement") new
and slightly cruder release is soon to be
followed by a similar treatise by Ellen De-
Generes.
The style of these books, though lacking
in structure, clearly hits a nerve.
There is certainly enough call for high
class bathroom reading — Paul's reference
— to pack The Stanford Barn with several
hundred local high-brow bookstore afi
cionados intent on getting Reiser's signa
ture scribbled on the title page ol their
copy.
Your wife had the first edit on 'Couple-
hood?
Yes, my wife has the first cut on every
thing. She was the first one to look at it. I
don't know if it's true with all writers, but all
comics when they show something to some

body have to either leave the country or be in
the room when the person reads it. So I sat
there and she read it and laughed — in all the
appropriate places, no less. I let out a huge
sigh of relief and I gave it to others.
You sat there through her entire reading oj
the hook?
I have not that much to do. You'd be sur
prised. I have a lot of free time. And she's a
fast reader.
What did she cut out?
There were some very lurid details — not

of myself and my wife, but stories of other
people in show-business and gossip that I
was just making up. She said it was wrong
and we took it out. . . The lawyers also said,
'Let's pull that.'

How did your wife feel about having her
private life printed up like that?
Anything really private didn't make it into
the book. Only stuff that 1 made up is in
there, so she was okay with it. I'm actually
not even married, I made that up too.
She's a psychologist, right?
Yes.
Is that good or had?
For whom?
Both. Either.
Oh, for me it's a blessing. For her it's te
dious. She'd love to get out of it, but con
tractually she cannot. No, it's a good thing,
except the thing about being married to a
psychologist is we get into great conversa
tions but every 55 minutes she just stops and
says, 'We have to end now.'
For years Reiser comfortably fell into
a category the PC world might eu
phemize as dispositionally chal
lenged.
Even on "Mad About You" he can be
caught complaining more often than not.
But with the best-selling book, "Couple
hood," under his belt Reiser is making a no
ticeable break from the nebbish streak that
has characterized so much of his successful
career — challenging a dynamic equilibri
um between established, confident, multi
media comic-stud and the dorky one of
"My Two Dads."
A thoughtful, postulating book jacket
makes the reader wonder if he's pondering
the mysteries of bisque or trying to bend
spoons. A Gap ad of a back photo challenges
any bad memories with a friendly "I'm-not
mi//y-like-the-bad-guy-from-aliens" look.
What were some of your favorite bits that
got edited out?

It was actually a chunk that I sold to
Joseph Heller. He's making it into a little
novella. The rest I have to save for the second
book. It I tell you now...
Is there going be a second?
I'll talk to you next year — maybe.
Your book starts in the middle, already in
the eouple, what about couple formation? Any
advice?
Umm ... you need two people, I know
that, and you need some kind of really
smooth line. Couple formation? Best I can
say is put on a clean shirt and good luck to
you.
The same question for the show as about the
hook. I)id you decide one day that you wanted
to do a TV show about being a couple?
It was a gradual process. I thought
about doing a show and I was thinking,
'What tickles me?' The stuff from my act
suddenly became more and more about
couple stuff and I thought all this might
be funny. So it became a show. Then it be
came a book and ultimately its going to be
a soup.
With every medium I like to get thinner
and thinner. From TV to a book to a poster
to a soup. And then just a vapor. The vapor
will be out in six years.
Did the network look at the show and in
stantly say, 'This is it'?
They got it. When we went and described
the show we said this is the flavor and they
said, 'You know, people are going to relate to
that.'
What did you tell them the show would be?
We told them the show would be "Thir
ty Something" if it were shorter and fun
nier. Which made them laugh, but in truth
its really about the little things that go on
between two people who decide to be to
gether forever and everybody can relate to
that.
When you get really specific and personal
it becomes universal.
The media hopping, from the stage to
movies to TV to your book ...
Next puppet shows and radio. It's all 1
want to do: a puppet show, make a soup and
get out of the business.
Are the changes all on purpose? Did they
just happen?
It just kind of flowed. One thing hap
pened, then the book came up, it sounded
like a nice idea so we did that. Wasn't
planned, it just happened.
One last question.
Make it a good one.
You. Seinfeld. Arm wrestling. Could you
take him?
I have no answer there. I will say this
though, I once mud wrestled John Good
man and some ... uhh, special things hap
pened. John was really embarrassed about it.
.. . Hmm, I couldn't come up with a
funny answer for the arm wrestling one. I
feel so bad. ■

though, I once mud wrestled John Good
man and some ... uhh, special things hap
pened. John was really embarrassed about it.
.. . Hmm, I couldn't come up with a
funny answer for the arm wrestling one. I
feel so bad. ■


It's a funny thing for someone who has fol
lowed and enjoyed Paul Reiser's career to
actually meet him. Because it becomes
abruptly apparent that he isn't short.
At all.
Hard to believe, but he's actually pretty
tall, and somewhat confident too.
Maybe it's the transition to the literary
scene which is giving Paul Reiser this new
ability to talk without whining. Maybe it's a
hit TV show which is helping him consoli
date an affected nerd-boy image into a char
acter, not a personality.
Hither way he's intelligentsia now — he's
signing books.
Daily: How did the book conic about — did
you Mike up one day and think, "/ think I'll
write a book now?"
Reiser: 1 woke up and realized that I had
accidentally written a book. You know
sometimes you get a thought in your head. I
had exactly a whole book's worth. I even had
the photos and everything, all glossies. I
thought, 'I shouldn't leave all this lying
around the house' so I called someone and
said 'We'll sell it to American people.'
And American people have bought the
book.
Yes, several American people have bought
the book.
Hair you been amazed by the response?
I'm quite tickled by how many people
have bought it — people I don't even know.
These are not just relatives and people I went
to school with. These are like strangers who
went into the store and bought it.
Just open up any old page of "Couple
hood" and the meter of his k vet ching be
comes charmingly salient. Reading the
inside flap is enough to make you buy it. 1 le
even makes it easy to get into — the page
numbers begin at 145, because, "I know that
when I'm reading, I love being smack in the
middle of the book."
Reiser's "Couplehood" is the third in a
relatively new genre of bit-ish comedy nar
ratives in print, bill Cosby's "Fatherhood"
happened first, but the trend seems to have
taken hold via Jerry's "SeinLanguage". Tim
Allen's (of "Home Improvement") new
and slightly cruder release is soon to be
followed by a similar treatise by Ellen De-
Generes.
The style of these books, though lacking
in structure, clearly hits a nerve.
There is certainly enough call for high
class bathroom reading — Paul's reference
— to pack The Stanford Barn with several
hundred local high-brow bookstore afi
cionados intent on getting Reiser's signa
ture scribbled on the title page ol their
copy.
Your wife had the first edit on 'Couple-
hood?
Yes, my wife has the first cut on every
thing. She was the first one to look at it. I
don't know if it's true with all writers, but all
comics when they show something to some

body have to either leave the country or be in
the room when the person reads it. So I sat
there and she read it and laughed — in all the
appropriate places, no less. I let out a huge
sigh of relief and I gave it to others.
You sat there through her entire reading oj
the hook?
I have not that much to do. You'd be sur
prised. I have a lot of free time. And she's a
fast reader.
What did she cut out?
There were some very lurid details — not

of myself and my wife, but stories of other
people in show-business and gossip that I
was just making up. She said it was wrong
and we took it out. . . The lawyers also said,
'Let's pull that.'

How did your wife feel about having her
private life printed up like that?
Anything really private didn't make it into
the book. Only stuff that 1 made up is in
there, so she was okay with it. I'm actually
not even married, I made that up too.
She's a psychologist, right?
Yes.
Is that good or had?
For whom?
Both. Either.
Oh, for me it's a blessing. For her it's te
dious. She'd love to get out of it, but con
tractually she cannot. No, it's a good thing,
except the thing about being married to a
psychologist is we get into great conversa
tions but every 55 minutes she just stops and
says, 'We have to end now.'
For years Reiser comfortably fell into
a category the PC world might eu
phemize as dispositionally chal
lenged.
Even on "Mad About You" he can be
caught complaining more often than not.
But with the best-selling book, "Couple
hood," under his belt Reiser is making a no
ticeable break from the nebbish streak that
has characterized so much of his successful
career — challenging a dynamic equilibri
um between established, confident, multi
media comic-stud and the dorky one of
"My Two Dads."
A thoughtful, postulating book jacket
makes the reader wonder if he's pondering
the mysteries of bisque or trying to bend
spoons. A Gap ad of a back photo challenges
any bad memories with a friendly "I'm-not
mi//y-like-the-bad-guy-from-aliens" look.
What were some of your favorite bits that
got edited out?

It was actually a chunk that I sold to
Joseph Heller. He's making it into a little
novella. The rest I have to save for the second
book. It I tell you now...
Is there going be a second?
I'll talk to you next year — maybe.
Your book starts in the middle, already in
the eouple, what about couple formation? Any
advice?
Umm ... you need two people, I know
that, and you need some kind of really
smooth line. Couple formation? Best I can
say is put on a clean shirt and good luck to
you.
The same question for the show as about the
hook. I)id you decide one day that you wanted
to do a TV show about being a couple?
It was a gradual process. I thought
about doing a show and I was thinking,
'What tickles me?' The stuff from my act
suddenly became more and more about
couple stuff and I thought all this might
be funny. So it became a show. Then it be
came a book and ultimately its going to be
a soup.
With every medium I like to get thinner
and thinner. From TV to a book to a poster
to a soup. And then just a vapor. The vapor
will be out in six years.
Did the network look at the show and in
stantly say, 'This is it'?
They got it. When we went and described
the show we said this is the flavor and they
said, 'You know, people are going to relate to
that.'
What did you tell them the show would be?
We told them the show would be "Thir
ty Something" if it were shorter and fun
nier. Which made them laugh, but in truth
its really about the little things that go on
between two people who decide to be to
gether forever and everybody can relate to
that.
When you get really specific and personal
it becomes universal.
The media hopping, from the stage to
movies to TV to your book ...
Next puppet shows and radio. It's all 1
want to do: a puppet show, make a soup and
get out of the business.
Are the changes all on purpose? Did they
just happen?
It just kind of flowed. One thing hap
pened, then the book came up, it sounded
like a nice idea so we did that. Wasn't
planned, it just happened.
One last question.
Make it a good one.
You. Seinfeld. Arm wrestling. Could you
take him?
I have no answer there. I will say this
though, I once mud wrestled John Good
man and some ... uhh, special things hap
pened. John was really embarrassed about it.
.. . Hmm, I couldn't come up with a
funny answer for the arm wrestling one. I
