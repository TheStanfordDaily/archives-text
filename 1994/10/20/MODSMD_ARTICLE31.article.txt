## James Baldwin: Black Witness 
### Sangeetha Ramanujam 
Martin Luther King,
Jr. and James Bald
win went out to
gether to buy suits in the
winter of 1968. Within a
few weeks, King was buried
in that suit
In 1988, thespian
Robert Devin Jones first
came across an essay by

Baldwin describing this shopping trip. It was after
reading about "this chain of events, this irony,"
and Baldwin's resolve never to wear his own suit
again because it brought him too much pain, that
an idea was born. It was this passage that first in
spired Jones to put together a collage of Baldwin's
work.
"I realized," Jones said, that "this is something
that I can and should perform."
"James Baldwin: Black Witness" has come a
long way from that day.
Orginally created as a tribute to Black History
Month, this show has evolved from a one-time af
fair into a highly-acclaimed performance. After
more than five years of touring, Jones is still pre
senting to libraries, high schools and community
centers across the state.
Jones sees Baldwin as one of the finest African
American writers in history who, until his death
in 1987, fought against racism and bigotry. "Here

was a man," Jones explained, "who could take the
26 letters of the alphabet and twist them together
to capture the essence of what it is to be human.
Some people thought him to be an angry man but
he was angry because he cared."
It is a picture of this "unique American writer"
that Jones has created in his performance. Accom
panied by a pianist, Jones dramatically interprets lit
erature to present a unique portrait of a man who,
according to Jones, "always saw himself as a witness"
to his times.
The show unfolds in fragments, drawing from
Baldwin's many works ofliterature. Jones assumes
the role of various characters in Baldwin's life, pre
senting a medley of excerpts from his speeches,
novels, and essays. Baldwin's narration and the
theme of forgiveness and redemption resonates
throughout the pieces and ties them all together.
The pieces also flow together through the
play's score, songs which Jones chose himself.

Played on the piano, the music mostly consists of
"protest songs and jazzy tunes to underscore each
piece," rather than to distract from it
In the middle of this medley is Jones himself—
a man obviously very attuned to his subject, a
man who critics have claimed completely cap
tures the spirit of Baldwin.
With a long list of dramatic experience which
includes acting credits in the Berkeley Shakespeare
Festival and the Sacramento Theater Company,
Jones admits that this show is different from many
of the others he's been involved in. As a one-man
show, it allows him "a little more autonomy, a
chance to travel more, to provide for a question and
answer session, and the ability to do two or three
performances a week.
"It allows me more freedom and a chance to
act and still have a life," he said.
Jones hopes that those who have had the op
portunity to see his performance will walk away

having found
"some resonance in
themselves." It isn't
meant just for
African - Americans
but for everyone.
For the
most part, he's had
reason to believe
he's been successful

in sending the message across. One of his most
memorable experiences was at Marin County,
performing in front of a group of students. He
made such a big impression on this mostly white
population that he received letters from the stu
dents commenting on his moving production.
From a moving account of Martin Luther
King, "James Baldwin: Black Witness" has cer
tainly come a long way. Jones has created an out
let through which he is able to share his own pas
sion and provide the audience with a new window
of exposure. ■
