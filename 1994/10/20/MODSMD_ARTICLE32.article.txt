# First dates, interviews and the human condition: Tom Noonan on 'What Happened Was'
## 
### Story by Angie Chuang 
What Happened Was ..." is a movie
about a first date. It has only two char
acters, takes place entirely within the
walls of a Manhattan apartment and lacks cin
ematic lapses in time — we experience every
excruciating, fidgety moment right along with
the couple.
So why do we like it so much? Tom Noonan
— who wrote, directed and starred in the film
— seems to have touched upon something. It
may be Michael (played by Noonan) and Jack
ie's (Karen Sillas') desperate cravings for com
panionship, flustered demeanors or wounded
souls — something about the film prompts us
to proclaim it "so real." Apparently, the critics
agreed, as the film garnered the Grand Jury
Prize at the Sundance Film Festival.
In a broader sense, "What Happened" is not
really about dating, but rather about all human
interactions and our attempts to connect our
disparate selves with each other, to share some
thing of ourselves and to be understood.
These themes are evident in something as
unintimate and everyday as say, a reporter in
terviewing a filmmaker. In this case, the film
maker happens to be Noonan and the
process goes something like this:

SMALL TALK
Jackie, a secretary at a
law firm, has invited
Michael, a paralegal
at the same law firm, to her
place for dinner. Through
out the early conversation
and the meal (a mi
crowaved seafood casse
role), Michael and Jackie
struggle through a non
conversation with gaps of
silence during which
noises like the sliding of

chairs on the floor and the clattering of silver
ware fill the void and then some.
For about 30 seconds, all that can he heard
are the clicks and bursts of static as Noonan's
publicist establishes our phone connection.
Once the lines are hooked up, Noonan and I
converse lightly. I tell him a little about Stan
lord, he tells meol the days when he lived in the
Santa Cruz mountains and hitchhiked down to
the Palo Alto area to go to his favorite jazz club.
loday, he lives in New York, alternating be
tween a farm in upstate and a Manhattan
apartment, within vicinity of Paradise Theater,
his own company.
Shifting gears and getting to the task at
hand, I tell him I had been informally survey
ing people I knew who had seen "What Hap
pened Was ..." about what they would ask
Noonan.
And the number-one question was ...
.. What happens to them after the date?
People always ask me that."
No, that was number 2. Actually, it was how
much o) Michael is you?
Noonan says he

and Michael
have a lot in

common, and gives a predictable explanation
of writers being drawn to familiar material.
Noonan says that, like himsell, Michael "hides
his insecurities by overcompcnsating and act
ing like he knows it all."
"He's very close to me, but he's very odd,"
Noonan says, l ike Michael, Noonan speaks
softly, a little nervously and often in rapid-fire
short sentences. "I don't think I'm that odd. A
lot of people think I'm that odd, though."
In Hollywood, Noonan is known as the
quintessential action-movie villian, perhaps
because of his distinctively unglamorous lanky,
6-foot-7 frame, and gray, thinning hair. Noo
nan has exercised his ability to be menacing for
roles in "Manhunter," "F/X" and "Last Action
Hero."
Media accounts of Noonan's career like to
romanticize the birth of "What Happened" as
his reaction to playing these roles. Unable to
land a "sensitive, good-guy" role, Noonan cre
ated his own, and a movie to go with it.
However Noonan counters that he "didn't
really write it as a reaction to playing killers.
I've always done stuff like that. I'm sure it's be
cause I'm good at playing violent people," he
says, laughing somewhat ironically.
Noonan desribes the genesis of "What Hap
pened" in characteristic Michael-esque fash
ion, stringing together a series of short sen
tences in one breath.
(Inhale.) "The play came from someone I
knew. A friend of mine's brother. She said, he's
such a jerk. He goes out with this woman.
When he realized she thought it was a date, he
got uptight. And she said get out then." (Fx
hale.)
LEAD-IN
Michael tells Jackie about a book he's
writing, explaining that he doesn't nor
mally talk about the project and that he
doesn't really want people to know about it.

He sits stiffly in a chair that seems too small for
his gangly frame, illuminated by a cold
fiourescent light.
"What book?" Jackie quips, trying to put
him at ease. She tells him that she writes also
— children's stories. Starting to feel the effects
of the wine, she drapes herself seductively on
the couch, while some unknown light source
casts a warm, yellowish light on her.
A clear connection can be drawn between
"What Happened" 's stagey quality and Noo
nan's extensive work in all levels of theater. His
play "Wifey" was awarded an Obie award, for
off-Broadway plays, and is currently in the
process of becoming his second film.
As has been reported in nearly every press
account of "What Happened," the script was
"workshopped" in front of a live audience in
Manhattan as preparation for filming.
However, when I bring this up to Noonan,
he acknowledges that this is only partially true,
and that there has been a bit of cover-up for
publicity's sake.
"I'm going to tell you this because you're a
small-circulation paper... no offense ..."
No, it's true.
"Because the film is about two people in real
time and it already feels stagey, the publicists
don't like to emphasize it as a theaterwork," he
says, explaining that it was thought too strong
an association with theater may have detracted
from the general appeal of the movie.
"But it was a full 5-week production, with a
paying audience and everything," he says."I
think it's really important to have people pay to
come sit in the dark. When you do that, you
learn what's true about the work."
So how did the work evolve as a result of its
run as a play?
The balance between Michael and Jackie
was crucial to achieve, and could only be tested
out by actually performing it in front of an au
dience, Noonan says. Without changing the

actual script ("I have a bit of an ego about

my writing," he confesses) he and Karen
Sillas were given M) trials to fine-tune
that balance. If either character ap
peared significantly stronger, or ma
nipulative in any way, the audience re
acted negatively and failed to em
pathize with the stronger character.

"Karen and I talked about
the nights (of performing
the play) we felt best and
picked a particular night,"
Noonan says. "We said,
'Let's do the film just like
I that night.' So we had 25
I ways to do it and we could
pick one. That's a luxury.'
It was a luxury that
created, in Noonan's
words, a much more
"subtle" result than jump
ing right into filming would
have.

1 ve worked on some huge (Noonan pro
nounces it more like "yuge") movies when it's
been too expensive to rehearse, so we do entire
scenes when the lines have never been read
aloud, he says."(As a director) I could never
do that. It would scare the shit out of me."
TURNING POINT
Sitting in a back room of the apartment,
Jackie reads her "children's" book after
some coaxing from Michael. She reads
the title, "What Happened Was ..." At her
feet, a light shaped like a goose casts an eerie
yellow glow on her. Michael sits opposite her,
in the shadows.
The story is a macabre, bizarre tale of top
less dancers, incest, child abuse and cannibal
ism. Michael's eyes dart about uncomfort
ably, and he does not seem to know how to re
spond. Multiple pairs of eyes, from broken
dolls that line the room, stare back blindly,
unblinkingly, at him.
Until the reading of the story, the power dy
namic is clearly unequal, with the working
class Jackie fawning over the college-educated
Michael and his book, the great intellectual en
deavor. The story, I suggest to Noonan, signi
fies a power reversal?
"That's relatively accurate," he says."I want
ed him to start out in one place, her in anoth
er, and for them to switch positions. The story
has a pivotal role, because suddenly she's the
writer and he's threatened and envious."
Noonan says he wrote the story after writ
ing the rest of the play with the idea that the
more outrageous it was, the more people
would laugh at it. "So I wrote a new story every
week," he says."It got weirder and weirder —
and very painful and violent."
REVELATION
Already drunk, Jackie suggests that they
"move on to the hard stuff." "Oh, you
mean drugs?" Michael says. An excruci
ating silence follows, after which Jackie pulls
out a bottle of liquor. As they converse, Jackie
discusses her passion for Air Supply and Deep
Purple, says that after a certain point, men just
stopped asking her out, and finally admits
that she has been attracted to Michael for
some time now, because he's a writer.
While the film portrays a shift of power be
tween Michael and Jackie, a definite gap be
tween their education levels underscores all
their interactions. No matter what the nature
ot their interactions, the less-educated Jackie
always remains inferior because her vocabu
lary and scope ot knowledge cannot match up
to his.
There's definitely sort of an underlying gender
dynamic with the educated, superior male and
the less-educated female. Had you ever thought
of switching the roles?
Noonan hedges the question a bit, saying
that he wrote Michael's part knowing he would

Further elaborating on the
question of whether Michael is a
self-portrait, Noonan reflects on
his past, explaining that Michael
represents a certain stage in his life.
"His history is a lot like mine. I
had a nervous breakdown in col
lege and dropped out," Noo
nan says. A certain quality in
his voice when he says this

be playing it, but eventually offers a surprising
revelation.
"I've never said this before in an interview,
but when I was having some trouble casting
the other part, I thought ot having two men,"
he says. "Hut even it it was going to be two men,
I'd still be in the same role — because I'm so ed
ucated.
"No, really, I never finished college," he says,
laughing. "I went to Yale for two years though,
but by the time I was there 1 had already
learned so much 1 was never going to learn in
school."
So why did you drop the idea of doing the
movie with two men?
Noonan says he had asked two actor friends
to play opposite him, but one was unavailable
and the other balked at the potential contro
versy the film could create.
The movie would have been received com
pletely differently if it had been about two men.
Noonan objects, saying that the characters
are "ambivalent" in their gender identities
and that the basic relationship issues are still
there.
I try to make my case that while the film it
self may not change, all the issues about the
truths of dating, loneliness and such would
have been overshadowed by the fact that it
was perceived as a gay film above all else.
Noonan concedes a bit, but is not convinced.
"Still, I'd like to do the play with two men or
women someday," he says. "It'd be a trip to
watch."
4 HEAVY STUFF'
Tensions are flaring, and Michael breaks
down, tells a story about his past par
tially to justify his behavior, but also
just to share a burden he's been bearing with
someone.
He was at Harvard Law School, he says, and
then "something happened." He dropped out,
and since then he's lost touch with the world,
and himself becoming a broken person.

suggests that even now, at age 43, he has not
completely detached himself from this part of
his past.
"but I've made money, I'm married, have a
kid. So I'm beyond where Michael is, I hope,"
he says. "But it's like when you're wounded and
screwed up as a child, part of you never heals.
That's why Jackie is as close to me as he is. Part
of it never goes away.
"Wow, this is pretty heavy stuff."
RETREAT
Michael and Jackie have reached a
standstill, and they arc both anxious
to return to their own solitary worlds,
perhaps recuperate from having given so
much, perhaps too much, of themselves in
such short time.
He collects his things and stands there, not
sure how to make his departure graceful. So he
doesn't. The door closes.
When people say, as they often do, "This
movie is so real," are they just really saying that
they are, like Michael describes everyone as ...
what is that line? "Umely, crippled ...

... crippled and damaged people. The peo
ple who make up America," Noonan com
pletes the line and laughs. "That's the funniest
line. No one laughs at it."
Really? When I saw it in San Francisco, there
was riotous laughter every time he said that line.
Noonan continued, fumbling for words.
"So 1 think people relate — they think it is
real — hut it's funny ... this is really hard to
describe. Can you ask me another question?"
WHAT NEXT?
Jackie lingers around her darkened
apartment, unable to sleep or do much
else. She leans against a wall, exhaust
ed, moody and contemplative.
The camera pans back to the outside of the
building, the city at night. The date is over. The
future is uncertain.
All right. Hack to the number-two question.
What happens next?
Noonan, who had obviously wanted to an
swer this question earlier in the interview,
jumps at the opportunity. Just as he described
the real-life situation that inspired the film at
the beginning of the conversation, he takes a
deep breath tells and the story in quick bursts,
as if he has fielded this question many times
before.
(Inhale.) "They'll go out again. It'll take a
while. He (Michael) needs help. Maybe he'll
go to therapy. Maybe he'll think long and
hard about who he is.
"She'll say no. He'll try again. She'll say yes.
They'll go out again.
"It won't be easy." (Exhale.) ■
