# China documentary toast of Mill Valley Festival
## 
### 
Swanky Mill Valley reeks of Palo Alto
transplanted in the North Bay, with one
notable exception. While Stanford's neigh
bor has torn down yet another art-house
cinema — Varsity — to make way for a
more commercially viable enterprise, the
11-day long Mill Valley Film Festival,
which ended on Oct. 16, proudly enters its
17th year with no sign of slowing down.

"Moving the Mountain"

What's more, festival organizers, the Film
Institute of Northern California, announced
plans for a $4.85 million renovation of the
San Rafael Theater as a state-of-the-art three
hall complex to house its headquarters and
showcase non-mainstream films.
Like the San Francisco Film Festival, its
spring-time rival, Mill Valley's program in
evitably relies on too many Bay Area pre
mieres of star-studded "independents"
such as Mike Figgis' "The Browning Ver
sion," and Woody Allen's "Bullets Over
Broadway." Nevertheless, "Red," Krzyzstof
Kieslowski's astounding closing chapter to
his recent trilogy deserved its place at the
Sequoia theater, if only as a preview treat
for impatient aficionados.
Next to such luminaries, genuine rare
finds which have no hope of playing at the
cineplex nearby, are in real danger of get
ting overlooked by festival-goers.
That said, Canadian Denys Arcand's
much-awaited "Love and Human Re
mains" turned out to be a frustratingly fu
tile effort in detailing the evasiveness of
commitment among several urbanites.
Still, it was rather heartening to witness
the considerable crowd waiting in line for
the screening of "Moving the Mountain"
— an 83-minute documentary feature by
Hollywood director Michael Apted ("Go
rillas in the Mist") tracing the student pro
democracy movement in China.

Apted's weakness for major-league
melodrama is apparent right from the start;
the director is unable to resist the opportu
nity to recreate scenes from student leader
Li Lu's traumatic childhood, with ample
use of smoke-machines and narrative
voice-overs to impart a mythical sense of
martyrdom to the widespread suffering
during the Cultural Revolution.
Quickly though, the strength of the ma
terial at hand overcomes such stylistic dis
tractions to reveal a heart-breaking portrait
of youthful idealism, defiant in the face of
autocratic tyranny. The film's spokesperson
is I.i, flanked by four other ex-student lead
ers who have tied to the West, still wanted by
the Chinese government to this day.
What happened in Tiananmen Square
on June 4th 1989 remains one of the most
shameful acts of bureaucratic cruelty in
the course of human history. More than
five years later, actual newsreel footage of
the incident continues to evoke images of
collective hope, courage, subsequent dis
belief and despair, packing an emotional
punch no less wrenching than the day
CNN reported Beijing's military crack
down on the unarmed protesters.
brought together by the camera to relive
the most momentous weeks of their lives,
Li, Wu'er Kaixi, Chai Ling and Wang (!hao
hua provide first-hand accounts, affecting
by their very candor. Wang, for example,
admits that the thought of the lives lost as a
result of her political action has rendered
her unable to continue with the struggle.
Without resorting to the lazy canoniza
tion of its subjects, "Moving the Mountain"
succeeds by lending them a lucid, yet insis
tent voice to make known personal tolls,
unexorcisable ghosts and maturing
dreams. Moreover, Apted's work serves as a
timely reminder of fundamental injustices
within a awakening giant so tempting to be
valued these days as an economic partner,
and be forgiven for its previous crimes.
Cinema as vital as this is what film festi
vals are for.
