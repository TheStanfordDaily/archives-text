## Tarantino's 'Pulp' heroes 
### 
The hero factor.
No, we are not talking about whether hero
sandwiches are better than Big Kahuna burg
ers. We are talking about the heroes of Pulp
Fiction.

Pulp Fiction

Jules and Vincent, Mia, Butch, Pumpkin
and Honey Bunny ... in three stories, their
actions amount to heroic feats. However,
they become heroes by virtue of what causes
them to act, the history beneath their charac
ters, not by their actions alone.
Director Quentin Tarantino keeps a (not
so-hidden) agenda: his own heroes are other
movies. It is the stuff which has made his
movie a heroic feat itself and Tarantino the
main star.

In a conversation
with Graham Fuller last
year, Tarantino offered: "I
guess what I'm always try
ing to do is use the struc
tures that I see in novels
and apply them to cine
ma."
He uses this tech
nique by arranging the
three stories in an "an
swers-first-questions-
later" sequence, allow
ing us to walk into the
middle of a cinematic
short story.
"1 don't do this to
be a wise guy or to
show how clever I am,"
he said. "But the glory is
in pulling it off my
way."
Tarantino embell
ishes this glory in "Pulp
Fiction," layering his for
mat with nonstop movie
"trivia." It is as if Taranti
no has sampled from
the best of cinematic
history in order to
piece together a classic
for the nineties. "Pulp
k Fiction" pays its trib
* ute to Godard, black
exploit a t i on

movies, samurai and kung-fu
classics, not just 50 years of
film noir.
Using the oldest tricks in
the book, Tarantino weaves a
three-part story into a

meta-movie. Lomic
strip violence (that

ironically, ends up
seeming very, very
real) combines
with movie proto
types, but in a way
both brilliant and
unexpected.

The boxer who is
supposed to throw a
fight in the fifth but
doesn't is none
other than Bruce
Willis, who settles

his debts, and
rides off into Cal
ifornia sun with
his little French
cutie. His role as
Butch could be
about"Punchy"
the sell-out as

much as it
could be
about

Bruce
Willis
and

every other character he has played.
The "Cleaner," a.k.a. the "Wolf," who
steps in to solve the messy problems of two
hit men, has just stepped out of another
movie, "La Femme Nikita." It is Harvey Kei
tel playing the person that he is most apt to
play.
The role of Jimmie, played by his truly,
Quentin Tarantino, is self-reflexive as well.
Jimmie goes ballistic on his longtime friend
Jules for having brought a headless corpse to
his house an hour before Jimmies wife is due
home. Jimmie then chills out and kind of lets
things take their own course, just like a direc
tor with an idea and a script great enough to
let it unfold with graceful ease.
"All you need to make a movie is a girl and
a gun," Jean-Luc Codard once said. With
"Pulp Fiction," Tarantino has the girl, the gun
and so much more.
