Writer-director Wes Craven* the creator of
"A Nightmare on Him Street," has finally
proven that an bad idea sometimes never dies.

New Nightmare

In the latest addition to the " Night owiv" se
ries, Wes Craven's "New Nightmare," the evil
Freddy Krueger (Robert England) returns to
terrorize Heather Langenkamp (played by her
self )in ail uninspired re- hashing of the original
story. Only this time the premise is even tlimsi-

r#'
In what seems an nnsikcessftii attempt at
sophistication, Craven creates a self-referential
world about the making of the film, and |ven
goes $o far as to include himself in the pfpeess
of writing the screenpluv. Then he gives Freddy
the alarming ability to step into "real life" so he
can inflict his horrors on the film crew and cast.
The chaos begins v. hen Ungenkamp's son
Dylan (Miko Hughes) aw,ikes from a Krueger
nightmare only to discover that his favorite
stuffed animal has been slashed ill classic Fred
dy style. Soon after we learn that Langenkamp
has been receiving threatening phone calls

from a man who sounds a little too much like
Freddy. And after a trail of mutilated bodies be
gins to turn up, Langenkamp must assume that
the impossible has come true: Freddy is real.
From this point on the Film splinters into a
series of close calls and predictable plot twists,
all of which do very little except bring the story
closer to the denouement.
The only scene even worth mentioning in
volves little Dylan as he tries to cross the free
way. In a surprising moment, Krueger de
scends out of the sky and dangles the boy over

the rushing traffic to the screams oflangenkamp
as she watches helplessly from a distance.
Perhaps the greatest fault of the film is that
it is essentially a re-assembling of the same el
ements we have seen in other Krueger films.

A familiar Freddy dashes around the screen
spouting the same old lines and waving his fa
mous claw. The film fails to incite much ter
ror because we have seen this all before.
"New Nightmare" is one of the most pre
dictable horror films to come out in the last
few years. And that does not make for much
entertainment.
