## The 						Advocate 
### 
Dead White European (French, 15th-cen
tury) Male seeks exotic, erotic, moralizing
gypsy woman whose pig's honor needs de
fending. Bad British accent a plus; must he
willing to accept improbable plot lines and
threat of the Bubonic Plague.
Sound like something you'd find in the
personals of The Daily Californian? Try
again. "The Advocate," written and directed
by Leslie Megahey, unites medieval France
and cinematography in a dansc macabre.
The story focuses on Courtois (Colin
Firth), a Parisian lawyer who moves to the
countryside searching lor peace among sim
ple, honest peasants and beautiful serving
wenches delightfully lacking in "integrity.
Unfortunately, as foreshadowed by ominous

shots of ravens and storm clouds, Courtois"
plans go awry. Predictable? Yes. Cliche? Yes.
Fntertaining? Not really.
" The Advocate" 's leading flaw is its evo
cation of conflicting emotions. Ribald
humor, a death sentence, a playfully evil vil
lain (Nicol Williamson) and anti-semitism
are all integral parts of the plot. The most en
gaging character is the self-serving town
priest, Albertus (wonderfully acted by lan
Holm). Yet even he is hall Monty Python,
half cynical decrier of humanity's lack of
virtue and worth.
"The Advocate" includes dreadful dia
logue coupled with atrocious acting. When
Courtois, the (supposedly) sophisticated
lawyer, arrives in Abbeville, the townspeople
fix him with glances usually reserved for
Roseanne — naked. Courtois' situation does
not improve. He is forced to defend a pig ac-

cused of murdering a young Jewish hoy,
thwart the advances of the villain's lovely but
psychotic daughter, live in a brothel (earning
"The Advocate" its original rating of N( '-17 )
and part with the gypsy (Amina Annabi)
whom he falls for.
Throughout all these misfortunes, Firth
evenly portrays Courtois as horny, naive,
self-righteous and horny. luckily, most of
his fellow characters are as dull as (Courtois,
not permitting them to notice what a lout he
is.
When "The Advocate," was first released,
Miramax, in a futile attempt to recreate the
success of "The Crying Came," asked critics
not to reveal the film's "big secret," which was
that a pig was the advocate's client. "The Ad
vocate" s real secret is its utter failure to en
tice the viewer.
