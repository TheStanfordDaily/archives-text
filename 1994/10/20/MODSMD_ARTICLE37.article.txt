# Time Cop
## 
### 
The latest installment in the ever-grow
ing series of silly action flicks starring the
oh-so-muscular martial arts hero Jean
(Tuide Van 1 )amme, "Time Cop" comes off
as a sort of "Back to the Future" with less
charm, less character, more guns and more
blood.
It spins the tale of a time-travel control
enforcement officer, trying all at once to
stop the misuse of time travel by an evil
presidential candidate and to prevent the
death of his beloved wile 10 years before.
The film is obviously working with an
overused premise, and unfortunately
doesn't really manage to do anything origi
nal with it. While perhaps one of the most
predictable movies ol all time, " Time Cop"
is still somewhat entertaining for several
reasons.
Ron Silver, who was so good in "Reversal
of Fortune," unfortunately is grossly under
challenged by his role in the film. However,
as far as playing a one-dimensional villain
goes, Silver is quite capable. Also, some ol
the special effects are kind of neat — Jean-
Claude is almost a special effect himself in
several scenes, including the infamous
splits -on-the-stove in the trailers — and the
film takes advantage of the concept ol time
travel, spanning several time periods (Civil
War, 19305, etc.).
Another strong point, the supporting
cast is for the most part quite amusing and
endearing. Bruce Mc( iill is promising as the
chief of the time police and Ciloria Reuben is
more than a match lor Jean-Claude as a fel
low upholder of the law.
As the beloved wife, Mia Sara has a lot of
trouble, but perhaps she is just rusty after
not having been in a major motion picture
since her days as Ferris Bueller's wide-eyed
girlfriend. She is also given the worst lines. It
is hard not to sound fake when one is im
ploring Jean-Claude, "Don't answer it, just
this once, don't answer it!" or when one is
asked to gasp, "But it's so dangerous!" for the
umpteenth time.
Jean-Claude himself is, as always, re
sponding to his poor wife's pleas and protes
tations with witty one-liners like, "I don't
bake cookies for a living." There are actually
two Jean-Claudes (just like in "Double Im
pact"), one in the past and one in the future.
Director Peter Hyams helps us to differenti
ate by giving futuristic Jean-Claude worse
hair.
Hvams also manages to throw in an en
tirely gratuitous shot of a naked woman
and, of course, a frame or two of Jean-
Claude's unclothed derriere.
Thank God for that, because what Van
Damme movie would be complete without
it?
