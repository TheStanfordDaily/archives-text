# Exit to Eden
## 
### 
l-.very human being, from a corporate
CI O to a 68-year old grandmother, has a
hidden desire to be spanked, whipped and
tied in chains.
If this is a theory you fervently subscribe
to, then put down those handcuffs and try

Savoy Pictures' new film "Exit
to Eden." But expect some
corn with your porn in this
watered-down comedy ver
sion of Anne Rice's best-selling
novel. While the S&M theme
renders the movie too warped
to be a mainstream comedy,
those who are attracted to the
film's risque elements will be
disappointed by its levity.
The movie follows two de
tectives, two villains and one
oblivious photographer to the
island of Eden, a fantasy world
of sado-masochism ruled by
the dominatrix Mistress I isa
(Dana Delany of China
Beach).
Originally, "Exit to Eden"
was an erotic story of a sexual
awakening between F.lliot
Slater (Paul Mercurio), a con
fused romantic looking for

true love and I isa, a one-time victim. She
now refuses to give up control, opting instead
to beat men into submission.
Unfortunately, director (iarry Marshall
decided to dilute this theme by adding two
bumbling bad guys (played by Stuart Wilson
and supermodel Iman) and comedians Rosie
O'Donnell and Han Aykroyd as undercover
policemen.
Considering its subject matter, the film

should be anything hut predictable. Howev
er, the storvline branehes oil into a subplot
about sonic sought alter valuable film that
I lliot took, which takes the movie through
one cliche after another, from the bossy po
lice chief to the chase scene finale.
Despite an irritating and entirely unnec
essary voice-over throughout the film, Rosie
()'l )onnell gets in some cute one-liners and,
together with Aykroyd, provides the out-

sider's view of t'.lub Eden. 1 lie is
land's inhabitants and customs
provide an entertaining high
point of the movie — at one
point, two women are playing
ping-pong with a man's backside
tilling in for the ball.
Mercurio (the star of last
year's "Strictly Ballroom") and
Delany comprise a fascinating
duo as each tries to break down
the other's sexual and emotional
barriers. They lose their intrigue,
though, as they metamorphose
into stereotypical romantic leads
with all the edge and bite of those
in "Pretty Woman" (also direct
ed by Marshall).
Though the actual on
camera kink is mild, the movie
was racy enough to be banned in
parts of ("anada. Despite Mar-



Couriesy olSavoy
Dan Akroyd and Rosie O Donnell play undercover cops in this
sado-masochistic comedy.
Marshall's efforts at opening sexual subver
siveness up to the mainstream, it's a movie
for a specific audience.
Then again, we, who consider ourselves
part of mainstream, may all just be in denial
of our real yearnings.
