# Caro Diario
## 
### 
The Unbearable
Lightness of "My Diary"
May please or perturb.
Italian director Nanni Morettis "Caro Di
ario" (subtitled: "Dear Diary") is a haiku
with projection. And like a haiku, this (lick

attracts the "even my freaking kid coulda
done that" reaction from philistine fathers
and patronizing nods of approval from intel
lectual circles. Nanni Moretti did indeed gel
that nod of approval; he was named "Best Di
rector" for "Caro Diario" at the 1994 Cannes
Film Festival.
According to this enthusiast of three-lined
poetry and minimalist art, Moretti deserved
the prize.

I ike Buster Kcaton, Woody Allen and
Charlie Chaplin, Moretti is a complete auteur
writing, directing, and starring in this
simpie and light film, presented as three diary
entries.
In the first entry, "On My Vespa," the au
dience follows Moretti as he explores town on
his beloved motorscooter. Moretti is seen as a

prankster, but not of the obnoxious variety.
Rather, he gently torments others with his
childlike curiosity and matter-of-factness.
For example, when in his favorite housing
district, Moretti asks permission to explore
the homes by stating that he's simply film
scouting. "I'm doing a Trotskyist musical
about a baker," he earnestly informs the resi
dents.
In a few defining scenes, Moretti criticizes
the degenerate Italian media. During one
memorable moment, he tortures a film crit
ic on his deathbed by reading aloud the bom
bastic reviews the critic had written.
After a charming first vignette, the sec
ond comes a little more abruptly. In "Is
lands," we see Moretti trekking from island
to island in search of a creative sanctuary.
Each island has a certain idiosyncrasy so
strong and revolting that it drives the des

perate director away. Watching this, I
couldn't help but think that the storyline
was a rip-off of the Little Prince's planet
hopping adventures in St. Exup£ry's famous
children's tale.
In the final segment, "Doctors," Moret
ti maniacally attempts to find a cure for his
overwhelming body itch. He sees derma
tologists, radiologists, refexologists (who
prescribe a bath in mashed bran), and doc
tors of Eastern medicine. . .all to no avail.
While tickling, the display of neurotic des
peration in "Doctors" is also quite sober
ing, reminding the members of the audi
ence of their own pathetic searches for
tranquillity.
The simplicity of "Caro Diario" supplies
its charm. But, then again, this is the state
ment of a lover of haiku, Erik Satie, Joan
Mir6, William Carlos Williams, and Hello
Kitty® designs. If you share the same taste for
styrofoam-lite-art, enjoy the latest from
Nanni Moretti.
