# Favorable settlement has uncertain effect on assessment of Kennedy

### Juthymas Harntha Senior staff writer 
One of Donald Kennedy's many
phone calls yesterday came from
U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher, who called to congratu
late the former University President
on this week's favorable settlement
of the indirect-cost controversy.
Though the call from Christo
pher, who served as Board of
Trustees chair during part of
Kennedy's presidency, lasted only
a few minutes, such responses to
the settlement reveal the extent of
the persistent connection between
Kennedy and the controversy that
has been a thorn in Stanford's rep
utation for the past four years.
Arguably the person hurt the
most by the controversy, Kennedy
— who resigned as a result of the
dispute — potentially stands to
gain the most from Tuesday's set
tlement, in which the federal gov
ernment agreed to drop all claims

of fraud against Stanford in re
turn for a $1.2 million fee and the
University's abandonment of its
counter-suit.
But in an interview yesterday,
Kennedy insisted that the main
beneficiary of the settlement is
Stanford, and not his tarnished
reputation.
"I think that there's been a col
lateral benefit for me," Kennedy
said, but the real "centerpiece of
this story is Stanford."
Kennedy vindicated?
Faculty and administrators
who were with — or against —
Kennedy during those years, how
ever, were less diplomatic about
how the controversy and its recent
settlement will affect Kennedy's
reputation.
Kennedy became implicated in
the scandal in 1990, when govern
ment auditors began looking into
