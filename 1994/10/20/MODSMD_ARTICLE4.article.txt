# Favorable settlement has uncertain effect on assessment of Kennedy
## 
### Juthymas Harntha Senior staff writer 
One of Donald Kennedy's many
phone calls yesterday came from
U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher, who called to congratu
late the former University President
on this week's favorable settlement
of the indirect-cost controversy.
Though the call from Christo
pher, who served as Board of
Trustees chair during part of
Kennedy's presidency, lasted only
a few minutes, such responses to
the settlement reveal the extent of
the persistent connection between
Kennedy and the controversy that
has been a thorn in Stanford's rep
utation for the past four years.
Arguably the person hurt the
most by the controversy, Kennedy
— who resigned as a result of the
dispute — potentially stands to
gain the most from Tuesday's set
tlement, in which the federal gov
ernment agreed to drop all claims

of fraud against Stanford in re
turn for a $1.2 million fee and the
University's abandonment of its
counter-suit.
But in an interview yesterday,
Kennedy insisted that the main
beneficiary of the settlement is
Stanford, and not his tarnished
reputation.
"I think that there's been a col
lateral benefit for me," Kennedy
said, but the real "centerpiece of
this story is Stanford."
Kennedy vindicated?
Faculty and administrators
who were with — or against —
Kennedy during those years, how
ever, were less diplomatic about
how the controversy and its recent
settlement will affect Kennedy's
reputation.
Kennedy became implicated in
the scandal in 1990, when govern
ment auditors began looking into
allegations that Stanford was over
charging the government for the
indirect costs — costs that cannot
be attributed to a single project,
such as building depreciation — of
government-sponsored research.
After two years of media atten
tion and congressional hearings
that painted Stanford as an ivory
tower institution using taxpayers'
money to buy yachts and flowers,
Kennedy resigned.
Former Provost James Rosse,
who served under Kennedy for
several years, said the settlement
will go some way toward clearing
Kennedy's name, but it is "too
late to help him."
"He would have been a natural
candidate for a Washington post
in [the Clinton] administration
had it not been for the indirect
cost controversy," Rosse said.
"I think he suffered from a
bum rap," said Time Magazine
Editorial Director Henry Muller,
a Board of Trustees member. "It's
unfortunate that in the minds of
some, the scandal was linked to
Donald Kennedy's reputation.
"He got caught up in this and it
obviously affected him personally.
I hope this resolution clarifies

those who associate Don with the
controversy," Muller said.
Kennedy professes, however,
that he does not "feel any need for
vindication."
The settlement "probably
won't change very much" in
terms of his reputation, Kennedy
said. "Someone asked me if I
though this was a ringing vindica
tion, and I said vindications don't
know how to ring. All they do is
whisper if you're lucky."
Still finding fault
Faculty members who had
demanded Kennedy's resignation
during the height of the contro
versy, though, were clear in their
conviction that despite the settle
ment, Kennedy does not deserve
any sort of reprieve.
"All the settlement means is
that they found no grounds for
fraud," said Political Science Prof.
John Manley. "It doesn't take
away what happened before the
[congressional] hearings and the
black eye Stanford got by Donald
Kennedy allowing all these
expenses for his personal life."
And Engineering Prof. Emeri
tus William Spicer argued that
while Stanford may appear to
have won in the public eye, it has
lost the battle financially, with
the indirect-cost rate falling from
a high of 78 percent in the late

1980s to 58 percent currently.
"Essentially, if the rules were
vindicated, then the indirect-cost
rate would be much higher than it
is," Spicer said.
Spicer still blames Kennedy for
damaging Stanford's relations
with the federal government by
reacting badly — "some described
it as arrogant," he said — to the
initial investigations in 1990.
As a result, Spicer said, the
government saw later negotia
tions as a "grudge match" and
retaliated by slashing the Univer
sity's indirect-cost rate — the
effects of which Stanford is still
feeling now.
"In any fair reading, this set
tlement won't rewrite history,"
Manley said. "It's basically not
going to change what happened."
"Kennedy's reputation was
nixed and it will stay nixed," he
added.
Looking back, moving ahead
Kennedy's current concerns,
however, are not about reputation.
The former president — who now
works at Stanford's Institute for
International Studies — plays
down the damage the scandal did to
his personal and professional life.
"I have returned to work on the
faculty here. I've been on govern
ment committees. I've interacted
with colleagues in higher institu

tions, and in no respect have I
found either my friendships or my
professional relationships adverse
ly affected by the media publicity,"
he said. "Every kind of relation
ship I had continued unimpaired."
Nevertheless, he said he felt he
had to resign in 1992 because of
the doubts his presence stirred in
the Stanford community.
"Much to much time was being
wasted thinking about whether I
could lead Stanford to a solution
or not, and the only way of getting
rid of the uncertainty was to pre
cipitate it decisively (by resign
ing)," he said. "And I think it had
exactly that effect. It clarified the
air. We were able to do a lot in
that last year of mine knowing
that it was the last year."
And Kennedy conceded that
Tuesday's settlement would prob
ably not have been so favorable
had he remained at Stanford's
helm these past two years.
"As to the question could I
have accomplished what has been
accomplished in the last two
years, the answer is no, not with
[myl history," he said.
Though he doubted that the
federal government would have
treated him differently from cur
rent University President Ger
hard Casper, Kennedy said it
would have been too difficult to
continue "work at Stanford

amidst the uncertainty that was
generated by the continued ambi
guity about my own plans."
Faculty members saw him as a
"lightning rod," he said, and the
only way to let the University
move forward was to resign.
"There was a lot of uncer
tainty at the time, and fairly
or unfairly, | Kennedy] became
involved in it. The fact that he
left did clear the air," said
History Prof. James Sheehan,
who served as Faculty Senate
chair during the 1991-92
school year, Kennedy's last
year as president.
4 I don't think it's erasable'
Uncertainty about Kennedy's
presidency is likely to persist for a
while at least.
"If you really look — and I've
had the chance to look at this for
a long time — the fact of the mat
ter is that the reputational effect
of bad media coverage is very dif
ficult to assess," he said. "We tend
to vastly overestimate the effect
of good and bad publicity."
But in this case, the bad public
ity is likely to overshadow the
good publicity. "If you compare
the prominence of the treatment
of the initial charges with this set
tlement, they're in very different
places in your daily newspaper.
That's just life," Kennedy said.

Also, he said, it will be difficult
for the media to forget the more
flashy "hooks" of the earlier sto
ries, such as allegations that Stan
ford asked to be reimbursed for a
yacht as well as antiques for
Kennedy's house.
"The media got that story and
it was a prominent part of the
story .... This won't make it go
away because nothing in this set
tlement changed that," he said. "I
don't think it's erasable."
And critics like Manley say the
public should never forget those
stories.
"Stanford is crowing and try
ing to put a spin on this, saying
that we never did anything
wrong, but no one outside of Stan
ford is going to be sucked in by
that," Manley said. "Anyone who
followed history as it occurred and
witnessed the outrage on (Capi
tol) Hill will not be taken in."
Kennedy's supporters, though,
hope that the indirect-cost contro
versy and the recent settlement
will "fit in the much larger picture"
when the time comes to finally
assess Kennedy's presidency,
"Not in tomorrow's newspaper
or magazine stories, but indue
course," said Time Editorial
Director Henry Muller, "I hope
that Don gets the credit he is due
for everything he has done for
Stanford."
