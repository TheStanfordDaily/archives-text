## Veruca Salt: saviors of alternative 
### 
When Veruca Salt
guitarist / vocalist Louise Post
sings, "This is the time for be
lieving in fairy tales," she might
as well be singing about her
band's prospects of becoming
the alternative musics latest
saving grace.

"American Thighs
Veruca Salt

With the storm of hype that's
been swirling around the band,
there's good reason to believe
that their debut album, "Ameri
can Thighs," might be the magic
Doc Marten that turns these
indie stepkids into mainstream
rock heroes. Indeed, Rolling
Stone and Spin have already
picked up on Veruca Salt's Cin
derella story: the former includ
ed the group in a "Bands to
Watch" section and the latter
mentioned the Chicago four
piece in the same breath as Pearl
Jam and Smashing Pumpkins.
Yet, because of all the hoopla,
it's more difficult to cut Veruca
Salt the kind of slack most de
veloping bands receive, if only
because one expects so much
more from them. It anything,
the band's first single, the smash
hit "Seether," makes matters
worse. On the straight ahead
pop tune, Veruca Salt delivers
on its promise, chugging and
roaring with a mix of edgy in
tensity and infectious melody.
Indeed, "Seether" proves a
tough act to follow and, unfor
tunately, few moments 011
"American Thighs" come close
to matching it. The bounding
"Victrola" and the bouncy "For
sythia" glow with energy and
good humor; the breathy
"Wolf" charms as well, the
quicksand-smooth guitars pac
ing the song while guitarist / vo
calist Nina Cordon winds her

voice around Post's lead. Still,
the album seems uneven, from
track to track and within tracks
themselves — flashes of bril
liance, where tone and execu
tion come together, are offset by
tired stretches which lack that
intangible quality.
Listen long enough and
everything eventually seems
better and better, though the
lingering suspicion that some
thing is missing never goes
away.
F.ven the ploddingly boring
guitar work and silly lyrics on
"All 1 lail Me" become catchy
after a while. But lines like "So
sorry mister/But don't look
now/I got your sister/1 shot her
down" don't ring true, even
when you're singing along with
them. "Number One Blind" ap
pears to be the best Pixies song
that band never wrote; the tune
has all the right ingredients (a
steady bass rhythm, a whiny
guitar and an oddball chorus
that makes references to Levelor
blinds), just not the flair.
And that's the problem with
Veruca Salt — on the whole, the
two girls and two guys sound
ambivalent, compelling in no
sense because they exude so lit
tle personality. So what if Gor
don sounds like Juliana 1 latfield
and Post like Kim Deal? Neither
can sustain the attitude of their
predecessors, much less capture
the conviction of those voices.
The same goes for the stain
less steel guitar work, which
gives off the same sort of
warmth and spontaneity a bad
improv troupe does. In turn, few
of the notes they hit are the right
ones; blunt lyrics (especially the
ones on "All 1 lail Me") cross the
line of parody, while the quirky
ones seem stilted and staid.
None of this goes to say that
Veruca Salt's fairy tale won't
come true, lust hope the band
will fine-tune its craft rather
than be blinded by success and
stav stuck in its ho-hum wavs.
