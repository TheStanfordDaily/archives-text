# They might even be serious
## Giants reveal their quirky dark side 
### 
If you saw They Might Be (iiants
at Rinc-A-Delt last year, you proba
bly noticed t hat rock's most famous
accordion-toting twosome is no
longer a twosome. After four albums
as a duo, John Flansburgh and John
I innell have added a new drummer,
bass player, and horn section for

John Henry'
They Might be Giants

their latest release, "John Henry,"
and the result is an hour's worth of
the liveliest pop tunes of the year.
While the full band adds plenty of
extra energy, depth and power to the
usual TMBG sound, particularly on
the XTC-esque "AKA Driver" and the
radio hit "Snail Shell," it's still the over
active imaginations of the two Johns
that makes this album so much fun.
TMBG's songwriting is strange
enough to make you laugh, intelli
gent enough to make you think and
appealing enough to make you listen
over and over again. The songs touch
on a wide variety of topics — from
being obsessed with Alice Cooper to
digging up deceased Belgian painters
and they use a similarly wide vari
ety of musical styles.
Fans expecting the usual fun,
light-hearted TMBG tunes will cer
tainly not be disappointed, as "I
Should Be Allowed to Think," "Out
of Jail," "Destination Moon" and
"Subliminal" are some of their

catchiest songs to date. Yet, as you
may expect if you've seen the rather
grim album cover, many of the songs
on "John Henry" show a definite
dark side of the band.
Over the hard guitars and screech
ing tire effects of "Stomp Box," a dis
torted voice yells: "Kill kill kill kill/Kill
me now/Free the demon/Hear the
ceaseless screaming/Little Stomp
Box/Tear it from my heart." More
surprising than the lyrics is the fact
that the song works so well.
"A Self Called Nowhere," one of
the album s most interesting tracks,
depicts an individual spiralingdown
into a world of boredom and depres
sion. LinnelPs voice strains as he
sines: "It's a thine named 'it'/In a

bottomless pit/You can't see it
there/The sunken head/That lies in
the bed/Of a self called nowhere."
The final song of the album, "The
End of the Tour," is a fitting conclu
sion, as it sadly and sweetly journeys
through the many different emo
tions and musical styles that made
the entire album so unique.
For all its experimentation, on
only one occasion does a song tail on
"John Henry." The chant, "O, Do
Not Forsake Me," performed entirely
by special guest band Hudson Shad,
is painful. Fortunately, the album's
remaining 55 minutes of classic
TMBG warmth, gloom, and cheer
make it very easy to forgive.
