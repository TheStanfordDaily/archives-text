# 'No Need to Argue' can't match previous efforts

I guess we can't blame the Cranberries for being a little
bit sour.
After the success of their debut album — "Everybody Rise
Is 1 )oing It, So Why C]an't We?" — the band must have been
swarmed by legions of pesky critics and superficial fans
drawn in by the gimmicky voice of Dolores O'Riordan.
Or at least that's the attitude they appear to take in their lat-

"No Need to Argue
The Cranberries

est album, "No Need to
Argue," which seems
like an over determined
attempt to convince
people that yes, the
Cranberries are a seri
ous band.

Unfortunately, the group chose to make their case
through grandiose allusions and sentimental introspection
instead of an invigorated sound.
"Zombie" attacks a supposed, television-induced indif
ference to suffering such as the war in Bosnia, "The Icicle
Melts" laments — of all things — kidnapping, and O'Rior
dan even attempts to tackle death by invoking the ghost of
a great poet in "Yeats Grave."
"Zombie" provides an example of how a heavily distort
ed electric guitar and a pounding rhythm could hint at a
new direction for the band, but this song soon becomes
repetitive and too reminiscent of other bands.
Besides, this band is not quite ready to go grunge. Its style is
more suited to reflective personal expression than political or

emotional flamboyance, and while the group is sporadically
successful at incorporating new elements, the music never
strays too far from its base of understated mood-setting.
O'Riordan's voice ultimately must carry these songs,
and that voice becomes tiresome because it often floats off
into a mindless ditty that repeats and repeats until the end
of the song. None of those intense (iaelic-or-whatever wails
on this album.
The lyrics don't help, even when they escape message
mongering. O'Riordan seems to have discovered a new
brand of nihilism, aiming her uninteresting questions at
herself or at some imaginary demon.
She belts out," 1 )oes anyone care?" at the end of one song
— as if there really is no one listening. Later, she asks accus-

ingly, "How could you hurt a child,
hurt a child, hurt a child?"
Such fetishism does not bode
well for a musical style that depends
on direct connection with an audi
ence.
Those who have grown tired of
the group due to its massive expo
sure won't miss the waitings issued
by O'Riordan on the debut album,
but the new album could stand a
few more heartfelt expressions and
a little less posturing.
