When it comes to tribute albums, there's a
fine line between mockery and reverence.
"It I Were a Carpenter" attempts to straddle
the boundaries with its 14 covers of classic C '.ar
penters hits by modern, slightly off-beat musi
cians ranging from Matthew Sweet to Sonic
Youth.
The concept is a risky undertaking, and the
product has some hits and misses. The (Carpen
ters are oh-so-seventies (as alluded to by the
gross caricatures of Karen and Richard (Carpen
ter, complete with big lapels, on the jewelbox
cover), yet Karen's tragic illness and death de
mand some level of tact.
Shonen Knife headlined the album with the

radio-station release "Top of the World" — and
deservedly so. Far and away the most brilliant
track of the album, the bright, bubblegum-pop
sounds of the Japanese girl band takes a light
hearted approach to their task: capturing a
perkier, more-naive musical era.
Even Shonen Knifes characteristic pidgin
English doesn't come off as overly mocking, just
disarmingly cute. Classic Shonen Knife, classic
seventies. The combination works.
If the album has a first runner-up, European
punk band Bettie Serveert takes honors with
"For All We Know" — a (Carpenters love ballad
that has almost survived the test of time, sound
ing marginally unkitschy even today.
Bettie Serveert opens up the song with
strong-armed guitar tracks that could pass for
classic heavy metal, then suddenly turns the in
tensity down several notches and delivers an un
characteristically tender and lyrical rendition,
lust to prove that they haven't forgotten their
punk roots, the band members intersperse a few

guitar riffs a la eighties heavy-metal ballad.
Unfortunately, the remaining tracks range
from unremarkable to downright poor. Ameri
can Music Club ("Goodbye to Love"), Sonic
Youth ("Superstar") and Cracker ("Rainy Days
and Mondays") all decided to cover The Car
penters by singing as if they were in a tranquil
izer! stupor —out of tune and v-e-r-y s-l-o-w-1-
y-
Its hard to decide if these three bands were
poking fun at the songs or if they just weren't
playing very well. Given that they are all decent
musicians when they play their own music, we
would be inclined to assume the former.
While a (Carpenter's tribute seems to beg par
ody in many ways, and each of the three bands'
renditions are worth a chuckle or two, the
painfully unmusical material they present con
stitute cheap shots rather than creative yet re
spectful caricature. They could all take a clue
from Shonen Knife.
