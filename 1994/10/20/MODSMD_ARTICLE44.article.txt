# "Flipping Out" The Gigolo Aunts
## 
### 
I he Gigolo Aunts latest release, entitled
"Flipping Out," manages to combine a vari
ety of musical styles, resulting in a hodge
podge of tunes that range from seventy-ish
Hendrix grooves to the more contemporary
alternative sounds of Morrissey and Toad
the Wet Sprocket.
Perhaps, the best thing that the Gigolo
Aunts have going for them on their new
album is their ingenious lyric-writing.
Commonplace and seemingly insignificant
objects are laden with symbolic meaning in
"Cope," which as the title suggests, is about
dealing with loss and heartache. "This end
table's filled with this and that./ Try to dam
the memories of lipstick on the glass," the
lead singer croons in the opening lines of
the song.
Unfortunately, the originality of the
lyrics is often obscured by repetition. "And
you're tired of feeling like a pincushion," is a
wonderful metaphor, but after hearing it re
peated four or five times in the chorus of the
song aptly named "Pincushion," the image
becomes tiresome.
"Ride On Baby Ride On" and "Bloom"
are two mellow songs that showcase the lead
singer's whispery vocals. In these cases, the
Gigolo Aunts successfully blend strong gui
tars and crafty lyrics to create catchy, sing
along melodies. These two songs certainly
suggest that the band has potential for mak
ing good music.
However, the bulk of the songs on "Flip
ping Out" are not well-arranged. Take
"Lemon Peeler" for instance. The song at
tempts to evoke an early punk sound, but it
ends up sounding like the Beach Boys on
acid.
"Cope" starts out strong, with a head
banging rhythm of powerful drums and dri
ving guitars. Then our ears are accosted by
cacophony. Halfway through, the song
seems to fall apart. Suddenly, all of the in
struments and the vocals are in competi
tion. The drums pound, and guitars weave
in and out of vocals that fade and then gath
er in intensity.
Remember the saying about too many
cooks spoiling the stew?
