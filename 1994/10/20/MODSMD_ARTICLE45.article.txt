# "Ambush" Oliver Lieb
## 
### 
In the middle of the Sahara, the pounding of
drums, the blowing of reed pipes, and the oc
casional chant echoes throughout the air. Ex
cept in Oliver Lieb's world of ambient trance,
this is the Sahara meets "Blade Runner."
Lieb's (Spicelab) newest CI) "The Am
bush," is described as trance-sedated jungle,
however he forgoes the dancebeat of the tech
no-hypnotic sound in favor of loud, some
times violent African rhythms. He uses syn
thetically derived African sounds, and com
bines them with heavy pounding rhythms to
create an interesting new state of listening.
In fact the "songs" hardly feel manufac
tured, and the beat, while still there, is very sub
tle. Instead, a very organic type of music arises.
In "Rain," bell-type sounds simulate that
of rain, while subtle drums begin to fade in.
The beat, however is not repetitive but errat
ic and primal. Soon, entire layers of different
drum beats are overlaid, over which the
sound of reeds and chants are added.
"Rain" is the most quiet of the seven songs
on the disc. The others arc very forceful and
primitive-sounding, the most powerful
being "My Name is God."
In the song, an ominous techno/synth, al
most-industrial sound emerges and all of a
sudden, heavy pounding blasts through the
speakers. The bass reverberates everywhere.
In the background, however, a distorted reed
sound is sampled, and a second long human
scream is played every few minutes.
Although many of the songs sound less
trance/ambient than would appear so, the el
ements of techno are still there. Ambient
harp-type sounds are heard constantly, and
almost every song relies on a techno beat.
While this basis makes the disc theoreti
cally danceable, the overall effect is very sub
tle and inventive.
