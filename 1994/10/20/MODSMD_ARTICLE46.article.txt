# "The Plot Thickens" Galliano
## 
### 
Galliano breaks through the fog of op
pressively uninspired music industry cate
gories with their magic brew. Dubbed an
acid-jazz band, Galliano encompasses a
more eclectic mix of sounds than hard jazz
grounding its roots in hip-hop with energetic
dashings of R&B, funk, Celtic harmonies,
and rap.
Their latest feat of mind over music, "The

Plot Thickens," is a hopeful plea to stop po
litical pillage, sardonic society and defeated
democracy on an ecologically tampered
Earth. While propelling a message, these cos
mic-vibe masters also conjure images of po
litical activists, Celtic dreams, peace signs
and polyester. Creatively polyglot, Galliano
can switch from hard funkin' to cool soulful
ness without jarring your musical aesthetics.
Always a transcendent listening experi
ence live, the immediacy of Galliano's energy
has not always transferred fully to vinyl, until
now. The soulful UK band has finally cap
tured their musical and political efferves
cence on their third album, " The Plot Thick

ens."
Rob Gallegher, a.k.a. Earl Zinger has
joined forces with soul-belter Valerie Etienne
in a band fully complimented with musical
talent. Ranking in at number seven on the
UK Top Ten album charts, "The Plot Thick
ens" is enjoying far more success than their
previous albums.
Bassist Ernie "Boogie Back" Mckone and
drummer Krispin "Pump" Taylor lay down a
big phat groove for the distinctive sound of
ex-Style Councilor keyboardist Mick Talbot,
and versatile guitarist Mark Vandergucht.
Galliano's music is not as complicated as

that of similar groups such as Dream Theatre
or Yes because of the "less-is-more" nature of
the music. The band provides the funky and
soulful foundation that blends with the dri
ving force, the vocals.
The incredible vocal harmonies of Rob
Gallegher, Valerie Ettiene, and the back
ground vocalists levitate consciousness past
the mundane worries of life and into the real
troubles of the world. A very striking para
dox of warning and joyful celebration is

planted within the chorus of "Down in the
Gulley," in which Zinger and crew sing, "Old
lies are lying in a new time. Down in the Gul
ley." Enjoy the song "Cold Wind" and re
ceive the reward of the super-funky Sly and
the Family Stone style conclusion.
As the musical climate changes in the U.S.
toward a more varied and alternative per
spective, the success of Galliano's "The Plot
Thickens" in the United States will truly
show whether the people here are: 1) trying
to be in the groove 2) are in the groove or 3)
live the groove. If you are either two or three,
check out this album.
