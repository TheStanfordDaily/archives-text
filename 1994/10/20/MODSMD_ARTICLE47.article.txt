# "Paper Boy" lan Brennan
## 
### 
lan Brennan is an unusual singer-song
writer — he doesn't write love songs, at least
not the kind you expect to hear. Instead, what
you get on his self-produced, self-funded
album "Paperboy" is a brutally frank view of
some discomforting subject matters that
would scare away most record companies.
Playing most of the instruments on the
album, the 27-year-old Brennan weaves
homemade guitar rock around direct, social-

y conscious lyrics. Bren
nan surrenders all sub
tleties as he tells in-your
face urban angst stories
about homophobia,
street violence and

homelessness.
A native
of the Bay
Area, Brennan

juggles his music with
two other day jobs as both
a psychiatric counselor
and a staff-trainer for an
inner-city locked psychi
atric ward. Such job

experiences may have inspired "Help," in
which "Jose ... killed a man when he was 15,
will probably kill another before he's 20 ...
He didn't know how to ask for help so he beat
someone else until they begged for it." The
folkish acoustic outro nicely showcases Bren
nan's voice — lonely and apathetic — which
somehow seems to fit the protagonist's con
dition.
While most of Brennan's songs are un
questionably heartfelt, his repeated tackling
of social dilemmas can grow uninteresting.
The line, "I want to swim in its water, but 1
can't because the textile plant upstream has


turned it red" from "Stay" sounds more like
a corny ad for an environmental agency than
a line from a gifted songwriter.
In "Amy", the most intriguing track on
"Paperboy", Brennan abandons his direct
lyrical approach for ambiguity. Not knowing
what his husky voice is singing about some
how adds to the magic of the song. With its
driving guitars and a trippy modal ending,
"Amy" shows that Brennan has the potential
to appeal to an alterna-rock audience.
"Paperboy" is a good effort from an hon
est, hard-working musician. Because of bud
get constraints, the album has a raw, almost

unpolished sound. But that is not necessari
ly bad — there are many musicians who
would pay a fortune just to deliver the spon
taneity Brennan achieved on "Paperboy."
Nevertheless, Brennan is not quite in the
records stores yet as he still independently
distributes his album through his own Toy
Gun Murder Records (P.O. Box 410025, San
Francisco, CA 94141).
In a recent conversation with Brennan, he
revealed that his use of straightforward lyrics
was to make his songs "as accessible as possi
ble." But accessibility and directness don't al
ways go hand in hand. Perhaps by telling his
substantial stories more delicately, lan Bren
nan can reach out to a bigger audience —
and grab the attention of a record company.
