Blue Sky
She a nympho, he's a nerd. To
gether, what are they? A married
couple who, between the two of
them, cause more controversy on
the military bases they've inhabited
than the ongoing push for a nu
clear-testing ban.
Academy award-winning actor
Tommy Lee Jones stars in "Blue
Sky" as nuclear physicist Hank, a
lone rescuer manning a sinking
lifeboat and tossing innertubes to

drowning blind men. As a
soldier/scientist responsible for
measuring radiation levels at U.S.
Army nuclear test sites during the
heat of the Cold War, Hank gets
shuttled from base to base each
time he writes an honest report de
tailing dangerous practices.
With crazy characters and several
dangling subplots, "Blue Sky" tugs
the audience's attention just
enough to keep people in the the
ater. Yet Rama Laurie Stagner and
her co-writers seem to have tossed
in more conflicts than they can re
solve. Overall, it's not worth the
price of admission.
Ed Wood
Direct the worst films in all of
American cinematic history and
what happens to you? Hollywood
recreates your life on the silver
screen.
Producer/director Tim Burton's lat
est filmatic endeavor does just that.
"Ed Wood" delves into the relatively
unknown public and curious pri
vate life of the inept horror flick di
rector with a tenderness and un
derstanding usually reserved for
mainstream heroes and martyrs.
Jason's Lyric
"Jason's Lyric" is like a cheap box
of chocolates.
It looks really sweet on the surface,
but when you take a bite they're not
as good as you thought.
The film climaxes with a violent,
powerful encounter, complete with
automatic weapons, more sex and
your standard massacre. To give
credit where it's due, though, the
direction of Doug McHenry in this
scene is outstanding.

The problem is that the film as a
whole does not come together.
While the violent world of teens
growing up in a ghetto is accurately
and emotionally portrayed, the
strengths of the film are dragged
too far down by the stomach-churn
ing love story, which only leaves us
with a bad taste in our mouths.
Quiz Show
Following in the footsteps of Oliver
Stone's "Natural Born Killers," Quiz
Show also examines the power of
the media. While Quiz Show
doesn't rally the American public
behind vicious mass-murderers, it
does rap the knuckles of the ma
nipulative hands of network televi
sion executives.
The film recreates many of the actu
al events that entwined the lives of
Stempel (played by John Turturro),
Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes)
and Richard Goodwin (Rob Mor
row) in the late 1950'5.
"Twenty-One," NBC's weekly quiz
show, was investigated in 1959 by
a grand jury for fraud, after which
its findings were sealed by a judge.
Goodwin, intrigued by this, began
his own investigation for the Con
gressional Subcommittee on Leg
islative Oversight, hoping to ex
pose the ways in which networks
deceived the public.
The film attempts to focus on the
behind-the-scenes manipulation of
Twenty-One's producer Dan En
right (David Paymer) Enright, dri
ven by the power of advertising dol
lars and the need to compete with
other shows, gives millions of peo
ple a "friend" in Van Doren, some
one they can watch and cheer
along with in their own homes.

Only You
Move "Sleepless in Seattle" into
Rome, and you've got "Only You,"
starring Robert Downey Junior and
Marisa Tomei.
Perfectly cast as the star-crossed
lovers, Tomei and Downey 's chem
istry lights up the screen. For
Downey, "Only You" is familiar terri
tory; the film is similar to his other
magical, romantic comedies, such
as "Heart and Souls" and "Chances
Are." Tomei also displays a great
feel for comedy, and the screenplay
showcases her abundant natural
charm.
At once sweet and funny, "Only
You" is definitely a heart-warming
movie. Go see it — maybe you'll
meet the one you're destined for in
the popcorn line.
River Wild
There's nothing like a good, noi-so
old-fashioned heroine.
Gail qualifies. She's far from the
weeping victim common to so many
action flicks, the ones who dangle
off mountains and wait for some dar
ing He-man to come rescue them,
who touch the side of their eyes with
a handkerchief when dastardly vil
lains have them in their sights.
Instead, Meryl Streep's Gail is
strong — so strong that she's the
one who paddles when she takes
her son and sort-of-nerdy, worka
holic husband rafting through a
treacherous "River Wild."
In"The River Wild," it's Streep's
character and her innate chemistry
with son Roarke (Joseph Mazzello,
best known for facing down the di
nosaurs in "Jurassic Park") that
carry the film. When her son accus
es her of taking sides with Dad

against him, Gail matter-of-factly
replies, "I'm not on anybody's side.
I'm on everybody's side. I'm a moth
er."
One lesson to be learned is that the
lighter the boat, the more likely it is
to survive the treacherous waters. If
that lesson is applied to film, maybe
the lack of plot is fortunate.
Certainly the strength of Streep's
performance is more than enough
to keep the boat from sinking.
Sleep with Me
While "Reality Bites" and "Three
some" veer perilously close at times
to overly self-conscious MTV aes
thetics, this latest exercise in Gener
ation X-angst and indecision is un
afraid to parade protagonists who
are equally savvy in making conver
sation as they are at coordinating
wardrobes.
In other words, Eric Stolz, Meg Tilly
and Craig Sheffer are good enough
such that "Sleep With Me" avoids
coming across as an unintended
spoof of "The Real World." Indeed,
their characters negotiate the
treacherous tightrope stretched be
tween friendship and love with as
much abandon and anxiety as those
of us who are honest enough to
admit it.
Brimming with offbeat pleasures like
its claim to love being little but a
poker game — "In the end, you can
be left with nothing" — and the un
contrived use of quirky inter-titles to
mark its narrative milestones, the
movie articulates the pitfalls of post
modern passion with unbridled vi
vacity. Its somewhat-titillating title
notwithstanding, "Sleep With Me"
extends an invitation that would be a
shame to refuse.
