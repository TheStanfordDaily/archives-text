# Former students fund Farm for future freshmen:
## Alumni giving at new high 
### Rosalind Wang Staff writer 
Donations to Stanford from alumni with under
graduate degrees increased by 4.6 percent in the 1993-
94 fiscal year, the Office of Development reported.
The increase over the previous year resulted large
ly from the addition of 3,565 new donors to the Stan
ford Fund, the development branch devoted to un
dergraduate life.
Alumni gifts during the last year totaled over
$11.1 million, most of it from the 10 classes celebrat
inglast week's Reunion Homecoming Weekend. Over

5,000 people attended the weekend, breaking records
in attendance and donations.
The class of 1954 won the Wilbur-Reynolds donor
award, with 60 percent of the class giving donations
of various sizes to beat the 54 percent of last year's
winner, the class of 1953.
Cindy Pearson, director of classes at the Alumni
Association, credited the success to the reorganiza
tion of the weekend. Last year the weekend became
subsidized jointly by the Office of Development, the
Alumni Association and the Provost's Office.
Now, "all three offices help
fund the reunion, which means
bigger and better events. Mail
ings are also combined so we can
get more information out to the
alumni at the same time," Pear
son said.
Pearson also gave credit to the
"efforts of the alumni volunteers,
who got in contact with their
classmates and encouraged them
to come."
"We've just made a bigger
effort to welcome alumni back,"
she said.
As a whole, "giving at Stanford
has generally been on an upward
trend," said Nancy Wells, the direc
tor of the Stanford Fund. "This par
ticular jump is significant because
of the thousands of dollars that
each percentage point represents."
Wells cited University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper's "emphasis
on alumni giving and participa
tion" as contributing to the
increase.
"Casper is making a real
impact on alums by getting the

message out that giving is very
important to ensure the excel
lence of undergraduate pro
grams," she said.
The Development Office also
"has been doing a better job of lis
tening to alumni and keeping
them informed about what's
going on on campus," Wells said.
"Alums are paying more atten
tion now," she added.
"1 don't think we've asked very
well in the past," said Bill Stone,
Alumni Association president.
"We haven't made it a big deal.
This year we were more focused
on getting the news across, mak
ing a more direct audience and
having more effective education."
Wells said Stanford will main
tain the steady increase of giving
by "continuing to improve the
ways we reach alums."
She mentioned the work of the
new Stanford Fund chair, Uni
versity Board of Trustees mem
ber and Harvard Law Prof.
Charles Ogletree, who is "on the
road talking to alumni about the
Fund."
"We have to make it easy for
people to know why donations are
important and how to give," she
said.
