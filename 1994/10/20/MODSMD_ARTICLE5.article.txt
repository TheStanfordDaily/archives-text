Donations to Stanford from alumni with under
graduate degrees increased by 4.6 percent in the 1993-
94 fiscal year, the Office of Development reported.
The increase over the previous year resulted large
ly from the addition of 3,565 new donors to the Stan
ford Fund, the development branch devoted to un
dergraduate life.
Alumni gifts during the last year totaled over
$11.1 million, most of it from the 10 classes celebrat
inglast week's Reunion Homecoming Weekend. Over

5,000 people attended the weekend, breaking records
in attendance and donations.
The class of 1954 won the Wilbur-Reynolds donor
award, with 60 percent of the class giving donations
of various sizes to beat the 54 percent of last year's
winner, the class of 1953.
Cindy Pearson, director of classes at the Alumni
Association, credited the success to the reorganiza
tion of the weekend. Last year the weekend became
subsidized jointly by the Office of Development, the
Alumni Association and the Provost's Office.
