# 'You are my brother as that tree is my brother'
## New circle for campus Pagans 
### Samuel Park 
During nighttime ceremonies under the light
of the moon, believers wear silver robes and
chant to the Earth-mother.
Although some might not expect to come
across this mystic scene on this serene cam
pus, it's actually a common religious ritual for
Stanford's pagan community, some of whom
have formed of the Pagan Student Associa
tion.
The association will provide campus pagans
with a place to worship and conduct further
study of Paganism, for those who don't know
what it's about.
"The worst misconceptions are that we are all
Satan worshippers, that we hex people and that
we are trying to undermine the Christian reli
gion," said founder Holly Blumenthal.
Most students don't understand Paganism,
while many others identify themselves as pa
gans, but do not have a means of expressing
themselves. Blumenthal, hopes the association
will cater to both groups.
"A lot of times we're perceived as crazies," she
said. "People think we can turn lead into gold.
They think we'll work some witchcraft on them

and steal their babies."
Through the new group, the
master's student is doing her best
to dispel these fallacies. She
wants the campus to know that
pagans are not cultists, they don't
sacrifice animals and they don't
have orgies.
The Pagan Student Associa
tion will meet in a circle outdoors
for rituals at new and full moons
and at eight seasonal holidays. A
typical ritual — as described in a
pamphlet written by Blumenthal
— involves a small group of peo
ple dressed in white and silver
robes, carrying lanterns, shel
tered by the moonlight.
The High Priestess, a leader
chosen by election, creates a
sacred space by making a circle
and each member is purified as he
or she enters that space. Candles
are lit and the High Priestess
channels energy. In the circle,
each member is anointed with
scented oil and the pagans begin
to chant and dance. According to
Blumenthal, the ritual raises

invisible energy, promotes heal
ing and helps the environment.
Blumenthal hopes that the
members of the association will
be able to perform rituals togeth
er, as well as engage in study ses
sions. The group is open to both
pagans and non-pagans who want
to find out about Paganism.
"Paganism involves a lot of cer
emonial activity, and since there's
no pagan church — nature's our
church — this is a way for us to
worship our divinity and link us to
our mother," said Xedex, a mem
ber of the association.
To those who think of pagans
as Satan-worshippers with no
morals, it might come as a sur
prise that many of their beliefs
are as mainstream as reincarna
tion, the equality of men and
women, the acceptance of homo
sexuality and the strong feeling of
harmony with nature, Blumen
thal said.
She added that Paganists
believe that there is truth in all
religions. They believe in voodoo
ism — people end up paying for
the bad things they do and are
reincarnated as something bad.
They believe that sex is not sinful,
but rather a natural part of Earth

cycles. They have a high regard
for nature, and think of it as part
of the divine.
"We don't believe in Jesus
Christ. We don't believe in some
one being more divine than some
one else," she said. "We believe
that everyone is a part of God and
can find God in themselves."
Blumenthal explained that this
belief is the one of the most con
troversial aspects of Paganism
because it contradicts some
Christian beliefs.
"I, as a Christian, disagree
with their beliefs," said senior
Annie Chung, member of the
Intervarsity Christian Fellowship
Association. "The ultimate reality
rests in knowing a personal God,
a God who has character and per
sonality. Also, that God did
become a person in the figure of
Jesus Christ. Ultimately, though,
it's anyone's own choice what to
believe."
Pagans believe that God is in
all creatures and things, and that
this divine Spirit is not exclusive
ly male. Many feminist groups
choose to emphasize the Goddess
archetype in their rituals, Blu
menthal said.
"The people who join the orga

nization are open-minded and
have a respect for Nature, mean
ing you are my brother as that
tree is my brother," Xedex said.
"Paganism is a very spiritual
discipline that respects the natu
ral in humans and overlooks our
conditioned cultural differences,"
he added. "Flowers, living things,
have spirit, and we respect and
celebrate that."
Even though Paganism is legal
in California, it is still against the
law in many states. Blumenthal
estimates that there are roughly
500,000 pagans in the United
States.
"There are a lot of pagans in
California, especially in the Bay
Area. But it's hard to find pagan
groups, since so many pagans
hide it," Blumenthal said. "They
don't want people to know.
They're still in the 'broom closet.'
It's hard to form a community.
"There has been a lot of positive
reaction in the community from
feminists, as well as a lot of inter
est from science fiction groups,
though a lot of them expect to see
the kind of magic that you see in
pop culture and think we call up
the Devil and dance naked in the
woods," she added.
