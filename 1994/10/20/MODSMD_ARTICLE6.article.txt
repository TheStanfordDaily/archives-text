# 'You are my brother as that tree is my brother'
## New circle for campus Pagans 
### Samuel Park 
During nighttime ceremonies under the light
of the moon, believers wear silver robes and
chant to the Earth-mother.
Although some might not expect to come
across this mystic scene on this serene cam
pus, it's actually a common religious ritual for
Stanford's pagan community, some of whom
have formed of the Pagan Student Associa
tion.
The association will provide campus pagans
with a place to worship and conduct further
study of Paganism, for those who don't know
what it's about.
"The worst misconceptions are that we are all
Satan worshippers, that we hex people and that
we are trying to undermine the Christian reli
gion," said founder Holly Blumenthal.
Most students don't understand Paganism,
while many others identify themselves as pa
gans, but do not have a means of expressing
themselves. Blumenthal, hopes the association
will cater to both groups.
"A lot of times we're perceived as crazies," she
said. "People think we can turn lead into gold.
They think we'll work some witchcraft on them
