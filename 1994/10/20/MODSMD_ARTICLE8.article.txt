Nuclear deal praised
WASHINGTON (AP) - The U.S.-
North Korea nuclear deal was praised
yesterday by the head of the United
Nations agency that will help implement
it, whib the top Senate Republican criti
cized it as a "one-way street" favoring
the Koreans.
The accord announced by President
Clinton on Tuesday commits North
Korea to freezing and eventually dis
mantling its key nuclear facilities. In

return, North Korea will receive modern
nuclear power reactors and new diplo
matic links with Washington.
Hans Blix, director general of the
International Atomic Energy Agency,
said the accord gives greater assurance
against a nuclear-armed Korea.
In remarks to reporters after meeting
with Secretary of State Warren Christo
pher, Blix called the accord "a way of
promoting" the full implementation of
nuclear control obligations that North
Korea had been resisting.
