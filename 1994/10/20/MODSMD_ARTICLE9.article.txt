### 
TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — The terror
at the edges of the quest for Middle East
peace exploded yesterday when a bomb
on a crowded city bus killed 20 people
and turned a bustling street into a scene
from a slaughterhouse.
The attack, the worst in Israel in 16
years, wounded 48 people. Police
blamed it on a suicide bomber.
Some Israelis cried for vengeance
against the Islamic radicals who have
claimed responsibility for three major
attacks in 10 days.
Shouts of "Death to the Arabs!" were
heard from bystanders on the seaside

city's main throughfare as severed arms
and legs were gathered for burial, some
from on top of four-story buildings.
"It will end. It has to end. We will
tear them to bits," said President Rzer
Weizman, who called for "extraordi
nary action" to root out Islamic extrem
ists.
Police suspected a West Bank fugi
tive known as "The Engineer" of plan
ning the attack, according to Israeli
news reports.
The attack sparked anti-government
protests around the country and gave
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin little

choice but to retaliate against extremist
groups who oppose Israel-Arab peace
making.
In a dramatic television address, an
angry Rabin said he would seek legisla
tive backing for a wide-ranging crack
down on the fundamentalists, while at
the same time pressing ahead in peace
talks with the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
Departing from his cautious
approach to peacemaking, he stressed
the need for a final political settlement
that will divorce Israelis from the Pales
tinians of West Bank and Gaza Strip.
