On the Merrill Lynch Fast Track
For decades Merrill Lynch has been the leading
U.S. brokerage firm. Its share of client assets held
by major brokerage firms is an astonishing 37%.
One in five affluent American investors name
Merrill Lynch as their brokerage firm. Total assets
under management now exceed $500 billion
globally.
We at Merrill Lynch have built our leadership
position through a client-driven marketing strat
egy. We stay abreast of changes in world
demographics and investor needs, then respond
with new products and services well before the
rest of the marketplace.
Now Merrill Lynch invites a small group of out
standing new college and MBA graduates to
share in that success by pursuing a unique career
opportunity in its Private Client organization.
The Private Client Development Program
offers challenging positions in one of the Merrill
Lynch Private Client business units (units key to
maintaining our competitive edge - where your
contribution to our success is significant).
Under the guidance of a senior manager, you
work in product development, marketing, finance
or operations areas. You meet with senior man
agement to discuss firm strategy and participate
in task force projects to aid various business
units in meeting their strategic objectives. Formal
classes address career development issues and
enhance your leadership skills. You are given re
sponsibility, accountability, and the experience
needed to help you succeed throughout your
Merrill Lynch career.
Candidates for the program have outstanding
records of academic, extracurricular and work
experience achievement. They are interested in
the challenge of the fast-paced financial services
industry and want to be recognized for their
accomplishments.
The Merrill Lynch Private Client group is offering
an unequaled opportunity to excel. If you have
the talent, creativity, energy and commitment to
be a winner, this is an opportunity that can make
a difference in your career. The difference is
Merrill Lynch.
