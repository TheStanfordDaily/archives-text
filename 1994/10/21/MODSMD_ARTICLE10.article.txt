Judge bars media
LOS ANGELES (AP) - Over
whelmed by publicity so wide-ranging
he's gotten news clippings from Tibet,
O.J. Simpson's judge barred the media
yesterday from part of jury selection.
Superior Court Judge Lance Ito
closed the part of voir dire in which
prospective jurors will be asked whether
they can still be impartial despite inten
sive coverage of the case. Reporters will
be allowed back in the courtroom
Wednesday when prospective jurors are
quizzed about other matters.
Ito's ruling drew protests from First
Amendment experts, many of whom ini
tially thought he was barring the media
from the remainder of jury selection.
Later, Ito sent a court spokeswoman
to the media center to say he was misin

terpreted and planned to ban reporters
only from that part of jury selection in
which prospective jurors are questioned
about their exposure to media coverage
of the case.
Troops off alert
WASHINGTON (AP) - More than
100,000 U.S. troops are being taken off
alert for possible movement to the Per
sian Gulf now that Iraq's threat to
Kuwait has abated, the Pentagon
announced yesterday.
Instead, an additional 13,000 soldiers
and 270 aircraft will be moved into the
region to conduct exercises for an unde
termined period. At one time, the Pen
tagon had envisioned sending some
150,000 men and women in the event a
ground war against Iraq broke out.
