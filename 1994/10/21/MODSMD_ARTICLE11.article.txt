## Authorities seal off West Bank and crack down on Palestinian militants 
### 
TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) - As
anguished Israelis buried their dead yes
terday from the Tel Aviv bus bombing,
authorities ordered sweeping arrests of
suspected terrorists and sealed the
autonomous Gaza Strip and occupied
West Bank.
Facing public demands for a crack
down on militants in the wake of
Wednesday's bombing, the government
also ordered the demolition of the home
of a Palestinian suspected in the suicide
attack that killed 21 people.
The fledgling self-rule government in
Gaza deplored the decision to prevent
Palestinians from going to work in
Israel as collective punishment that
could slow the peace process.
"This is an attempt to make the
Palestinian people kneel down," said

Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
But support was widespread in Israel
for closing off the areas to keep away
militants who have stunned the nation
with three attacks in the past two
weeks.
Speaking at a ceremony for fallen sol
diers yesterday evening, Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin vowed Israel will outlive
the Islamic fundamentalists who seek
its destruction.
"To those who are trying to harm us,
the kidnappers and gunmen and
bombers: Israeli soldiers and security
forces will find you sooner or later, and
your fate will be bitter," Rabin said.
The government authorized more
money for Shin Bet, the internal securi
ty service, charging it with a concerted
effort to locate cells of the fundamental

ist Hamas movement which claimed
responsibility for the attacks.
It ordered the arrest of suspected mili
tants and the use of "more efficient" inter
rogations, in the words of one official.
"We need to use other methods, which
it's best not to talk about," said Housing
Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer.
Police Minister Moshe Shahal said
the government also planned "an inter
national campaign" to cut off donations
to Hamas from the United States,
Britain, Iran and other countries. Sha
hal said American charities for Hamas
were centered in Chicago and Texas.
But Israeli officials conceded the
fight against Hamas is a tough one,
directed at a small, compartmentalized,
highly secretive organization whose
members are willing to die.
