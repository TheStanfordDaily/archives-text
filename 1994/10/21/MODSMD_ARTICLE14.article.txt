Campus would be safer
if open areas, residence
doors had more phones

WHILE STUDENTS OFTEN
complain about the distance
separating Stanford from
major urban areas, they do appreci
ate the sense of safety that this iso
lation provides. Incidents like the
rape reported on campus in July
and the recent rash of car break-ins,
however, call everyone's feelings of
security into question.
University officials tell us they
are doing everything they can to
prevent such crimes. Qualified
county sheriffs deputies patrol the
campus. And the student-run
SURE Escort Service offers rides
home to students who would other
wise have to walk late at night.
Nevertheless, one simple thing
could greatly enhance the safety of
this campus, but has not been done
by administrators â€” namely,
installing more campus telephones.
Across the country, many universi
ties have positioned well-lit, easily
identifiable telephones throughout
their campuses so students can call
for help if they ever feel endan
gered. These so-called "blue-light
phones" offer a sense of comfort to
students who feel vulnerable walk
ing at night.
For some reason, though, such
telephones are nonexistent at Stan
ford. Stanford's campus may be
significantly safer than those of
other schools such as UC-Berkeley,
but as many students and parents
have learned, Stanford is by no
means immune to crime.
While the University did install
more public telephones around
campus this these phones
lack many essential features that
could promote campus security.
The phones are not specially lit and
thus are not easily identifiable to
students who may be in trouble.
Moreover, they require callers to

dial 911 in order to get assistance.
In many emergency situations, a
student may not have the time.
This problem could be alleviated
by installing "panic" buttons like
those on telephones on many other
college campuses. A button could
instantly alert the police that some
one was in danger at a phone's loca
tion, without requiring any verbal
communication. An immediate con
nection to the police would avoid
some of the confusion of having to
dial 9-911 from campus phones.
The University would also be
well advised to add more campus
telephones outside residence
entrances. Students visiting
friends at other dormitories often
arrive to find locked doors and no
reasonable way to contact their
friends. This inconvenience causes
many frustrated students to prop
doors open, compromising the
security of their residences.
Some of the larger dormitories,
such as lioble Hall, Lagunita Court
and Florence Moore Hall, do have
campus phones outside their main
entrances, but these are inade
quate, considering the number of
other entrances serving those resi
dences. Most Row houses do not
have phones outside. Indeed, not
many students would likely be able
to identify where a single campus
phone can be found.
No real argument exists against
making these changes. While the
University may claim that these
security features would cost too
much, not implementing them may
cost even more in the future if the
University faces increased insur
ance costs or a lawsuit from a crime
victim.
The choice for the University
seems clear. Increasing the number
and capability of campus phones
can only help. Students should
demand that the University act
responsibly and take their lives and
their safety more seriously. Before
Stanford can claim that it is doing
all it can to prevent crimes on cam
pus, students should see some
phones first.
