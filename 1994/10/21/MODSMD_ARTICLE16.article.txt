## Nawwar Kasrawi ASSU needs student help to fix fee system 
### 
Have you ever
wondered what
those "ASSU
fees" are that appear on
your bill every quarter?
Do you know who decid
ed how much they will
be? Do you know where
the money goes once you
pay it? Do you care?

You should, because
all these decisions are ultimately made by
you, the student, and you can decide how
these questions are answered. Stanford
has more than 500 student groups, each
providing opportunities for students, fac
ulty, staff and community members to do
whatever it is that tickles their fancy and
giving all of us a chance to learn things no
classroom could ever teach.
One of the main reasons there is such
a tremendous diversity of opportunities
on campus is that these groups are fund
ed through ASSU fees. All is not well,
however, as anyone who was around last
spring knows. 71 he fee system is experi
encing catastrophic problems, and some
thing needs to be done.
To understand why there are prob
lems, it's important to understand how
the system works. Students directly
determine the level of the ASSU fee in
the spring general election, when they
vote on groups' special-fee requests and
decide whether to increase or decrease
Program Board and Publications Board

funding.
In addition to special fees, the ASSU
fee also provides discretionary funding
available to any student group. You, the
student, have a tremendous amount of
control over how this money is spent.
Consequently, the system cannot contin
ue to function if students do not take the
time to make these important decisions.
So what happened last spring? Two
years ago, students voted to remove a
requirement that one had to vote to be
eligible for a fee refund, eliminating one
of the last remaining incentives to vote.
Also, graduate-student discontent with
the fee system increased, and refunds
skyrocketed. As the refund rate rose, the
cost of running the system increased
even further. So at election time, many of
the students who did vote were thor
oughly dissatisfied with the system, and
many student groups lost their funding.
What's being done now? A task force
has been formed to address the problems
of the funding system and propose com
prehensive solutions, including a constitu
tional amendment to be voted on in a spe
cial election early next quarter. As part of
its effort to gather information from stu
dents and groups, the task force will be
holding two informational forums next
week, one at 7 p.m. Wednesday in Kimball
Hall and the second at 7 p.m. Thursday in
Hacienda Commons in Rains. Anybody
can come to the forums and talk to the
members of the task force about special

fees, general fees, refunds ard student
group funding. Students will also be able
to present their ideas about how the fund
ing system can be redesigned.
In the past, proposals for reforming
the fee system have been limited to short
sighted attempts to fix the most pressing
problems of the moment, without
addressing the larger issues involved.
Now, as we look to create a new funding
system, we must consider some difficult
questions. What do we as a community
want to support? One of the things that
defines Stanford as a community is that
we can reach collective decisions regard
ing issues that are most important to us.
I hope that as the task force considers
its options, and drafts a constitutional
amendment, we can look beyond the prob
lems of the current system and agree that
we must maintain our financial support
of the student groups that add so much to
this campus. We must also realize that
there are costs associated with these
opportunities, and that these costs must
be spread fairly. We must accept that
there are fundamental differences
between the priorities of undergraduates
and graduates, and we must create a sys
tem that makes both groups feel that they
are freely participating in something that
will benefit everyone in the end.
