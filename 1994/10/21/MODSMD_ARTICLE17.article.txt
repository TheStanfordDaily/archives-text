Stanford students learn conformity, not critical thinking

AS SHE SUSPECTS, Elizabeth
Kelly is not the only one who is
tired of "this game of mental
one-upmanship" (column, Oct. 19),
but she may, unfortunately, be the
only one, or at least one of the few,
endowed with the ability to identify
this game, give it a name and verbalize
her discontent with it. Students have
until now been unsure what it is about
the giant mechanics of this institution
that isn't suiting them, or rendered
speechless by the sheer weight of the
academy sitting heavy on their chests.
Or perhaps they have subscribed to
Ann Porteus' logic (Friday Forum,
Oct. 7), believing that just as Res Ed

could not possibly be a monolith
because it is comprised of our diverse
selves, the academy must by its nature
serve us, its members, and that any
academic malaise we may experience
must be self-generated.
Porteus seems not to realize that
Res Ed cannot accurately and equally
represent every resident of Universi
ty housing any more than a class or
text can accord with the personal aca
demic pursuits of each student. She is
secure in the belief that if she is not
shoving an agenda down students'
throats, nobody is; that students do
not nudge each other into certain val
ues and beliefs when they decide

what to reward and what to frown
upon.
When we admire, exclusively and
without qualification, pop intellectual
goals — the pursuit of undergraduate
research, the writing of honors theses,
study abroad — we discourage many
less popular means of scholarship that
may far better serve the interests of
many students.
As Kelly points out, our scholarly
institutions are plagued by "politicized
readings and academic fads," and stu
dents pursue subjects "because some
one else told them it was the right
thing to do." Stanford is eager to tell
us as we enter the University that

there are no typical Stanford students,
but doesn't caution that it will make
us such while we are here, with sys
tems both residential and academic
that encourage us to ask questions but
never to think critically about the
questions we are asking.
Elizabeth Kelly has presented stu
dents with a wonderful gift — the
novel proposal of introspection, of
original thinking and of the creation
of diverse education instead of resig
nation to the monolithic education we
have been handed. I hope that they
are listening.
