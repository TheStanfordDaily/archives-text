# Bookstore should offer students discounts on texts, not rebate checks
## 
### 
The Oct. 18 article on the Bookstore
rebate caught my eye, as Bookstore
Director of Operations Ken Shark justi
fied the Bookstore's high textbook
prices by citing the prospect of "unex
pected contingencies" and by saying
textbook prices are set by the publisher.
First, I am curious as to what falls
under "unexpected contingencies," espe
cially to the tune of $570,000. Most
businesses don't have a "buffer" and
seem to do fine, despite operating in
markets where they face competition for
customers.
Second, as I understand, a book pub
lisher may suggest prices to the retailer,
but the price the customer pays is ulti
mately set by the store selling the book,
just as a book published by Knopf may
sell at different prices at Wal-Mart and
Kepler's. As an example, in another
industry we're familiar with, car manu
facturers may suggest a retail sticker

price, but dealers set the ultimate price
that the customer pays. It seems that if
the Bookstore is generating such a sig
nificant profit, or as Shark says, "sur
plus," the Bookstore could set prices
below the publisher's suggested price
and hence deliver savings immediately
to the students rather than months later
as a "rebate."
