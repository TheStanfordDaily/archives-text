# Presidents' statements on indirect-cost dispute bring Stanford shame
## 
### 
Let me see if I've got it straight:
Because the Navy concluded that it
does not have a legal case against Stan
ford for fraud, we should believe Uni
versity President Gerhard Casper when
he says that, although Stanford made
errors, we have "done no wrong"; for
mer University President Donald
Kennedy, who says he never felt a need
for vindication, is now vindicated any

way and the scandal that befell Stan
ford was some kind of horrible mistake?
When will we learn? Stanford was
party to a system that charged to Amer
ican taxpayers part of the cost of flow
ers for Kennedy's official residence,
sheets for his bed, antique furnishings,
expenses for the University yacht,
events at Lake Tahoe for Stanford
trustees and similar items.
When confronted by this before a
Congressional hearing, Kennedy
admitted some mistakes but attempted
to put the best spin on it in a vain
effort at saving Stanford's face. For
this he was, as The New York Times
reported, "dressed down" (Oct. 19).
One member of U.S. Rep. John Din
gell's committee, U.S. Rep. Ron
Wyden, a Stanford graduate, spoke for
others who love the University when
he expressed disgust at the adminis
tration's performance.
Would it not have been more seemly
and effective to admit the wrongdoing,
pay the government back (as we did,
anyway), forget the Washington spin
doctors and avoid all temptation to
stonewall?
It appears from President Casper's
statement and from Kennedy's that

Stanford, an institution whose business
is education, still doesn't get it.
