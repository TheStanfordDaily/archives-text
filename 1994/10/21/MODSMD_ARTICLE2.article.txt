# EV meeting tackles housing woes
## 
### Jo Marshall Staff writer 
The Escondido Village Family Council
met last night with top administrators in
an effort to resolve ongoing housing
problems many graduate students face
living in Escondido.
Vice Provost and Dean for Student Af
fairs Mary Edmonds and Director of
Housing and Dining Services Keith Guy
attended the closed, two-hour meeting
with five Escondido residents. The meet
ing focused on maintenance problems â€”
including poor move-in housing condi
tions and slow response to "fix-it" forms.
"This will further strengthen our ties
and communication with higher levels of
the administration," said Council Chair
man Jim Hansen after the meeting.
Neither Guy nor Edmonds made any
specific plans as to how they would at
tend to the maintenance problems, but

they agreed to discuss
the issues with other ad
ministrators and then
address them at the up
coming Escondido
Town Hall meeting next
week. Hansen said.
Guy said the meeting
went well. "I and my
staff will be responding
to the concerns that
were aired," he said.

During the meeting, council members
suggested the possibility of having a reg
ular maintenance program rather than
the present system in which work is done
only on request.
Tn response to this suggestion, Hansen
said that Guy "dropped a few hints that he
had something in the works."
Although Edmonds made no promises,
Hansen said that she was very understand
ing to the residents' housing problems.

"I'm very encouraged that she is so
willing to work with us," said Hansen.
"This fall she has become very concerned
about these issues."
Council member Benson Honig said
he agreed there was a "spirit of agree
ment that we will continue to meet about
these issues," but said he is waiting to see
if any positive action is taken.
"The real bottom line is that this is an
other meeting of promises," he said. "I
measure people by there actions rather
than there words."
He said that the atmosphere of the
meeting fluctuated between a "reason
able amount of anger and frustration"
and simply the relating of their stories
and experiences of living in Escondido.
Escondido resident Amber McLain
who attended the meeting was recently
involved in a flier campaign encouraging

fellow residents to complain if
they moved into unclean apart
ments. She was concerned that
Guy claimed the number of peo
ple moving into unclean apart-
