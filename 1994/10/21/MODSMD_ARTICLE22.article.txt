## He muddies the grounds, but Brits love Clinton

OXFORD, ENGLAND
IN HIS DAYS here during the late '60s,
Bill Clinton lived on tiny Leckford
Place, in an obscure Oxfordshire dis
trict called Jericho. A visit there today
hardly hints that the area once housed the
world's most powerful man. Far from the
spire-and-stone majesty of Oxford's city
centre, the streets in Jericho are narrow
and moribund, the modest flats drab and
unimpressive, the gardens untidy and
overgrown.
Yet Oxford played a pivotal role in the
making of Bill Clinton. It is here, after all,
where he both almost inhaled and decided
that he could not serve in Vietnam
because, well, he was going to be president
someday. And here, 25 years ago, Clinton
began his uneasy relationship with the
British. "Sure enough, at Oxford," he said
when he returned here in June to receive
the University's highest honor, the Doctor
in Civil Law, "I was another Yank, half a
step behind." Alas, he still is.
While Brits still, inexplicably, consider

Ronald Reagan and George Bush
formidable statesmen, these days they
assail Clinton's presidency with ferocity.
In the past month, the London Times first
said Clinton had the worst foreign policy
skills of any postwar president, then reck
lessly quoted an unnamed NATO minister
as saying, "Bill Clinton is a bumbling, ver
bose flake." More recently, Kenneth
Clarke, a member of the ruling Tory Party
cabinet, surmised on radio that Tony
Blair, the head of the opposition Labor
Party, "suffered from the Clintonesque
thing — you know, we're not saying very
much, let's just have a change."
What explains such ridicule? The fact
that Clinton and Co. are wildly successful
at conveying the appearance that they
haven't any idea what they are doing cer
tainly doesn't help matters. But there is a
more visceral reason why the British hate
Bill Clinton: he scares the hell out of them
For one, he scares them because his
British alter ego, the handsome, charis
matic, Oxford-trained Blair, will likely be

their next prime minister. More impor
tantly, though, he scares them because he
represents what the England of 1994,
nearly a half-century since the end of the
Empire, is becoming, slowly but irre
versibly. It is becoming America.
The signs of takeover are everywhere.
They explain why the most mindless
American game show ever created, "Amer
ican Gladiators," has been repackaged as
simply "Gladiators" for prime time on the
BBC. They explain why throngs of Oxfor
dians recently packed a local cinema for
the opening of "Forrest Gump." (Some
how I doubt a film about the last 40 years
of British history, narrated by some Welsh
half-wit and featuring a legless Falklands
War vet, would play in Peoria.)
British attempts to resist verge on the
pathetic. Patrons of McDonald's filed for
mal complaints this week against the tradi
tional McWish, "Have a nice day," which
they claim sounds nauseatmgly American.
Mind you, all those families of five who
flock to the local McDonald's here still

think Quarter Pounders are akin to manna,
but they would prefer if the cashiers would
just tell them to "bugger off, then," when
the order is ready. There might be a sale
across the street at the Gap.
The truth of the matter is that the
United States, for most Brits, is still the
idyllic fantasyland of "Baywatch," or at
least Euro Disney. One earnest "fresher"
asked me the other day if it is true "that in
America, everyone gets a brand-new car
when they turn sixteen?" I smiled politely
and replied that no, that only happens to
the kinds of people who live in the Suites.
So while the British may detest Ameri
cans — and many of them thoroughly do
— they can't contain their unspoken
desire to be American. And who can blame
them? America is richer, younger, hipper
and sunnier. It is also more violent, obnox
ious and dumb, true, but as Forrest and
Bruce Willis show, at least those qualities
sell movie tickets. And if the great, vulgar
machine of American commercialism is
conquering England, then Oxford's capitu

lation is certainly the clinching surrender.
Today, though the University's enforcers
still accost small children for running on
its lawns, Oxford's streets, pubs and
libraries fairly teem with wide-eyed,
unqualified Americans — including, not
insignificantly, 50 students from a certain
upstart university in California.
Fittingly, it was under the auspices of
kicking off a $500 million fundraising
drive that Oxford invited Bill Clinton back
in June. This month, the University
announced that it had met the goal, albeit
with the small indignity of having to
endow a Rupert Murdoch Professorship in
Communications. Surely the name "Dr.
Clinton" was dropped a few times to
prospective donors. For in Bill Clinton —
and America — England sees its darkest
fear, and its most secret wish.

skills of any postwar president, then reck
lessly quoted an unnamed NATO minister
as saying, "Bill Clinton is a bumbling, ver
bose flake." More recently, Kenneth
Clarke, a member of the ruling Tory Party
cabinet, surmised on radio that Tony
Blair, the head of the opposition Labor
Party, "suffered from the Clintonesque
thing — you know, we're not saying very
much, let's just have a change."
What explains such ridicule? The fact
that Clinton and Co. are wildly successful
at conveying the appearance that they
haven't any idea what they are doing cer
tainly doesn't help matters. But there is a
more visceral reason why the British hate
Bill Clinton: he scares the hell out of them
For one, he scares them because his
British alter ego, the handsome, charis
matic, Oxford-trained Blair, will likely be

their next prime minister. More impor
tantly, though, he scares them because he
represents what the England of 1994,
nearly a half-century since the end of the
Empire, is becoming, slowly but irre
versibly. It is becoming America.
The signs of takeover are everywhere.
They explain why the most mindless
American game show ever created, "Amer
ican Gladiators," has been repackaged as
simply "Gladiators" for prime time on the
BBC. They explain why throngs of Oxfor
dians recently packed a local cinema for
the opening of "Forrest Gump." (Some
how I doubt a film about the last 40 years
of British history, narrated by some Welsh
half-wit and featuring a legless Falklands
War vet, would play in Peoria.)
British attempts to resist verge on the
pathetic. Patrons of McDonald's filed for
mal complaints this week against the tradi
tional McWish, "Have a nice day," which
they claim sounds nauseatmgly American.
Mind you, all those families of five who
flock to the local McDonald's here still

think Quarter Pounders are akin to manna,
but they would prefer if the cashiers would
just tell them to "bugger off, then," when
the order is ready. There might be a sale
across the street at the Gap.
The truth of the matter is that the
United States, for most Brits, is still the
idyllic fantasyland of "Baywatch," or at
least Euro Disney. One earnest "fresher"
asked me the other day if it is true "that in
America, everyone gets a brand-new car
when they turn sixteen?" I smiled politely
and replied that no, that only happens to
the kinds of people who live in the Suites.
So while the British may detest Ameri
cans — and many of them thoroughly do
— they can't contain their unspoken
desire to be American. And who can blame
them? America is richer, younger, hipper
and sunnier. It is also more violent, obnox
ious and dumb, true, but as Forrest and
Bruce Willis show, at least those qualities
sell movie tickets. And if the great, vulgar
machine of American commercialism is
conquering England, then Oxford's capitu

lation is certainly the clinching surrender.
Today, though the University's enforcers
still accost small children for running on
its lawns, Oxford's streets, pubs and
libraries fairly teem with wide-eyed,
unqualified Americans — including, not
insignificantly, 50 students from a certain
upstart university in California.
Fittingly, it was under the auspices of
kicking off a $500 million fundraising
drive that Oxford invited Bill Clinton back
in June. This month, the University
announced that it had met the goal, albeit
with the small indignity of having to
endow a Rupert Murdoch Professorship in
Communications. Surely the name "Dr.
Clinton" was dropped a few times to
prospective donors. For in Bill Clinton —
and America — England sees its darkest
fear, and its most secret wish.
