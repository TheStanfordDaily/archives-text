## Spikers play host Two top-20 teams expected 
### Seth Goldstein Staff writer 
Everybody needs a change of
pace now and then. Even the
Stanford women's volleyball
team.
This weekend the No. 1 Cardi
nal (16-0) hosts the Wells
Fargo/Stanford Invitational.
The tournament allows the
Stanford spikers to take a break
from their Pacific 10 Conference
schedule, but not necessarily one
that will prove any less grueling.
The team will have a chance to
face a couple of squads they
might not ordinarily see during
the course of a season, including
two top-20 schools.
Tonight at 5 p.m., Stanford
will play unranked Villanova
(17-6) for the first time ever.
The Wildcats will wrap up a
tough west coast swing at
Maples Pavilion, and the Invita
tional might just offer the Big
East squad its most difficult
matches of the year. This is one
reason why Villanova is so eager
to participate.
"They're an east coast school
and normally don't play teams
of this caliber," said Stanford
head coach Don Shaw. "But
they're looking to strengthen
their program and one way to do
that is to go up against strong
opponents."
The tournament is also a
homecoming for some of the
Wildcats. Four players hail
from California, including
freshman middle blocker Stacy
Evans, a Los Altos native. She is
currently first in the Big East in
blocks and second in both kills
and hitting percentage. Her
.402 average ranks 12th in the
nation.
Fellow freshman outside hit

ter Marisa Davidson is a talented
player as well, hitting .378.
These two are in large part
responsible for Villanova's lofty
.316 team average, which is
third in the nation.
"I don't care what anyone
says about their competition,"
Shaw said. "If they're hitting the
ball that well, they have to be
doing something right."
According to Shaw, the Car
dinal is going to play the Cats
much like it did the Pittsburgh
Panthers, a Big East team Stan
ford swept earlier in the year.
This will afford him the chance
to give some of his talented
reserves a bit more playing
time.
If Stanford does succeed in
putting Villanova to bed on Fri
day night, it will face either No.
8 UC-Santa Barbara or No. 18
New Mexico for the tournament
championship the following
evening at 7 p.m.
The Gauchos and Lobos will
confront each other Friday after
the Stanford-Villanova contest.
The losers of the two first-round
matches will play a consolation
match before the championship
match.
The Gauchos (17-1) opened
the season with 13 straight vic
tories before falling to No. 5
Pacific. Thirteen of their wins
have come as sweeps. The team
is hitting .318, led by senior out
side hitter Heather Collins (.292,
243 kills), junior blocker Kim
Keyes (.323, 246), junior outside
hitter Tammy Stiner (.379, 131)
and senior blocker Shirley
Aboyme (.365, 85 kills). The set
ter is senior Chrissy Boehle, who
ranks fourth nationally in
assists average at 13.53 per
game.
UC-Santa Barbara holds an
all-time record of 7-3 against the
Cardinal, but those three losses
have come the last three times
the teams have met.
"Santa Barbara is always a
solid team," Shaw said.
"They're really scrappy defen
sively and hit the ball in more
often than not."
Stanford might have an easi
er time with the underdog
Lobos. Then again, maybe not.
Earlier this year when Stan
ford faced New Mexico, the Lobos
played competitively. They
jumped out to quick leads in both
games one and two before Stan
ford's guns regained their fire
power to come back for the win.
The Lobos were held to a .094 hit
ting percentage by a stifling Stan
ford defense during the sweep.
"They're used to playing good
teams," Shaw said of the Lobos.
"They have some veteran play
ers and they know what to do."
Although Stanford faced and
defeated New Mexico already
this year, Shaw isn't hoping
that the Lobos will win so his
Cardinal squad can face an
unknown quantity instead of
the Gauchos.
"We've played New Mexico
before, so it would be nice to see
someone different," he said.
"Either way we expect to have a
tough match. We've got to con
centrate on what we have to do
no matter who we face."

match.
The Gauchos (17-1) opened
the season with 13 straight vic
tories before falling to No. 5
Pacific. Thirteen of their wins
have come as sweeps. The team
is hitting .318, led by senior out
side hitter Heather Collins (.292,
243 kills), junior blocker Kim
Keyes (.323, 246), junior outside
hitter Tammy Stiner (.379, 131)
and senior blocker Shirley
Aboyme (.365, 85 kills). The set
ter is senior Chrissy Boehle, who
ranks fourth nationally in
assists average at 13.53 per
game.
UC-Santa Barbara holds an
all-time record of 7-3 against the
Cardinal, but those three losses
have come the last three times
the teams have met.
"Santa Barbara is always a
solid team," Shaw said.
"They're really scrappy defen
sively and hit the ball in more
often than not."
Stanford might have an easi
er time with the underdog
Lobos. Then again, maybe not.
Earlier this year when Stan
ford faced New Mexico, the Lobos
played competitively. They
jumped out to quick leads in both
games one and two before Stan
ford's guns regained their fire
power to come back for the win.
The Lobos were held to a .094 hit
ting percentage by a stifling Stan
ford defense during the sweep.
"They're used to playing good
teams," Shaw said of the Lobos.
"They have some veteran play
ers and they know what to do."
Although Stanford faced and
defeated New Mexico already
this year, Shaw isn't hoping
that the Lobos will win so his
Cardinal squad can face an
unknown quantity instead of
the Gauchos.
"We've played New Mexico
before, so it would be nice to see
someone different," he said.
"Either way we expect to have a
tough match. We've got to con
centrate on what we have to do
no matter who we face."
