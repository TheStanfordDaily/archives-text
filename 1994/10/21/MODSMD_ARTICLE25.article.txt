## Women's soccer to battle Tigers, upstart Huskers 
### Jeremy Stone Staff writer 
Encouraged by its play in last weekend's Texas
Challenge Tournament, the Stanford women's soccer
team hopes to improve its No. 3 ranking this weekend
in the Colorado College Tournament.
The Cardinal is looking forward to more forgiving
conditions, and competition, than in Texas, where the
squad lost its first game of the year to No. 1 North Car
olina by a score of 1-0.
Stanford will meet the host Tigers in today's match
up. Colorado, after numerous post-season appearances
in the past decade, has fallen on hard times. This year,
the Tigers staggered to an 0-4-2 start, but have since
rebounded to improve to 3-6-3. In fact, the team post
ed shutouts in its last two games.

'Stanford is ranked third and will be
the best team we will face all year.'
â€” Nebraska coach John Walker

"Colorado College was a perennial Final Four team
a few years ago, and they're going to have a few players
who've had that experience," said head coach lan
Sawyers. "They've always played us very tough."
Since 1989, the Tigers are one of the few programs
with a winning record versus Stanford, at 2-1-1. How
ever, this Tiger squad, which has been outscored 24-15
and carries no seniors, is a far cry from the powerhous
es of the past.
Sophomore forward Meagan McGuire paces a
lethargic offense with five goals on the year. Like the
Cardinal, Colorado's strength is its defense. All four of
the team's juniors play in the backfield, and goalkeep
er Audrey Mayfield has posted four shutouts on the
season.
Stanford's Sunday opponent, Nebraska, can also be
termed inexperienced, with no seniors and only one
junior. Unlike Colorado, the Cornhuskers do not have
a storied past since this is the women's team s first year
in existence. During this inaugural season, however,
Nebraska has turned some heads with a 10-2 mark,
both losses coming to Creighton. m
"Nebraska is going to be a totally unknown entity,"
Sawyers said. "The scouting report is that they play a
very physical game."
Offensively, the Huskers have scored over three
goals per contest, led by freshman Danielle Boswell's
10 scores. Freshman Jamie Riley has pitched in eight
assists
Nebraska's defense has also proven successful,
although untested. Freshman goalkeeper Allison Dud
ley has tended for four shutouts and a 0.72 goals
against average, but only 25 saves.
Huskers head coach John Walker realizes that Stan
ford sticks out like a sore thumb on his team's sched
ule, in contrast to teams such as Baker, Park College
and Teikyo Westmar.
"We know it will be a tough game," Walker said.
"Stanford is ranked third and will be the best team we
will face all year."
In addition to holding the status
of tournament favorite, Stanford
enters the weekend as healthy as it
has been all year. Though sopho
more midfielder Wendy Latimer
will not travel to Boulder due to a
foot injury, the line-up has been
bolstered by the return of senior
Anna Patitucci and sophomore
Suzie Boots.
Patitucci, a midfielder, had been
sidelined for five games with a knee
injury but returned to the starting

line-up in the North Carolina con
test. Boots, a fullback who started
20 games in 1993, did not start
against the Tar Heels but received
significant playing time in her
return alter a bout with mononu
cleosis and an ankle injury.
"It's nice for those two to get
their feet wet, if you'll pardon the
pun," Sawyers said, referring to
the Texas swamp. "Anna, obvious
ly, being a senior has great leader
ship on the field and off the field.
Suzie came in and really did a hell
of a job, especially on such a
demanding field. They both give us
a lot of stability and leverage to
adjust to situations."
