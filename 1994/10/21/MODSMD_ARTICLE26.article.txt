## Cardinal must snap OSU's wishbone running attack 
### Greg Collins Senior staff writer 
This weekend's matchup has
people uttering words that one
would never think of hearing
around the college football world
— Stanford is scared of Oregon
State.
Yes, the lowly Beavers, ugly
step-child to the fast-paced,
ultra-modern Pacific 10 Confer
ence, have developed an offense
that downright frightens oppo
nents. After languishing in back
to-back one-win seasons in 1991
and 1992, Oregon State (2-4, 1-3
in Pac-10) has firmly laid a claim
to the best wishbone offense in
the game.
Based on a simple three-play
offensive scheme which is
designed to pound the ball down
the other team's throat, the
Beavers' wishbone has them at
the top of the Pac-10 in rushing
and third in the nation, averag
ing 303.3 yards per game.
"They only run dive, keep and
pitch," said defensive coordina
tor Fred vonAppen. "If you stop
them a few times, it doesn't both
er them. They just come out and
keep running them and pretty
soon 'whoops' they hit one."
The Beavers have immersed
themselves so much in the wish
bone that they have only thrown
43 passes all year, completing 15.
However, they don't need to pass
to win — witness last week's 428
yards rushing against UCLA in a
23-14 Oregon State victory in
which the Beavers only attempt
ed four passes, all incomplete.
So what tricks do vonAppen
and head coach Bill Walsh have

in store?
"We can't go with 12, we've
tried that," Walsh said, joking
about Stanford's two penalties
for 12 men on the field against
USC last week. "Their team
speed and backfield speed is real
ly impressive."
VonAppen had a more
straightforward answer to the
bewildering Beavers.
"They force you to be patient
and task-specific," he said. "You
better tackle and you better get
off the blocks because you are not
going to get any free access to
running backs without beating a
blocker."
The coaching staff expects to
strengthen the interior of the
defense by playing senior Nate
Olsen and his 6-foot 4-inch, 252-
pound frame as inside lineback
er. Last year, the Cardinal had
similar success in using lineback
er Mark Hatzenbuhler to plug up
the middle, where he recorded 19
tackles.
Last season's game was
marked by a rushing exhibition
from the Beavers and aerial fire
works by Stanford in a 31-27 Car
dinal win. Oregon State ran for
338 yards while Steve Stenstrom
threw for a career-high 407 yards.
A late interception by cornerback
Eliel Swinton secured Stanford's
first Pac-10 victory of 1993.
Much like last year's squad,
the 1994 version of the Cardinal
(1-4-1, 0-3) enters the matchup
with the Beavers winless in Pac
-10 play. Despite the difficult
start, players on the team have
adapted their personal goals for

the season.
"You start thinking about how
your individual self can improve
and how you can motivate your
self, because each guy has to
buckle up and play hard," senior
wide receiver Justin Armour said.
In a mild surprise, Walsh has
moved sophomore Scott Frost
back to full-time offense, reliev
ing him of his free safety duties.
Sophomore Charles Young, who
had been splitting time with
Frost, has now fully recovered
from a knee injury from last year

and will take over as starting free
safety.
Sophomore running back Mike
Mitchell and Swinton will most
likely not make the trip to Corval
lis. Freshman safety Kadar
Hamilton sprained his left hand
earlier this week in practice, but
should be ready to play with a
splint or brace for his hand.
Because of Mitchell's injury
and other bumps and bruises in
the Cardinal backfield (senior
Ethan Allen is the only player 100
percent, according to Walsh),
Stanford is expected to go to the
air early against Oregon State.
The Beavers have the worst pass
defense in the Pac-10. After three
straight 300-plus yard passing

days, Stenstrom has chased down
nearly all of John Elway's school
and conference records. With an
average day Saturday, Stenstrom
should break Elway's school
records for total offense, comple
tions and attempts. With a win,
Stenstrom would eclipse Jim
Plunkett for most career wins
(22).
Oregon State's running game
is paced by quarterback Don
Shanklin and halfback J.J.
Young. In five games this year,
Shanklin has carried the ball 59
times for 449 yards. Young, a sec
ond-team All-Pac-10 selection
last year, has 510 yards on 80 car
ries. Against UCLA last weekend,
the two combined for 40 carries

and 316 yards.
For the past four days, Stan
ford's scout team has tried to
emulate the speed and precision
of the Beaver attack. While some
of the players on the Cardinal
roster have experience running
the wishbone from high school,
vonAppen said that no matter
how well they prepare, the artifi
cial turf and the experienced
Oregon State players will look
faster.
"You only face them once a
year and you have a terrible time
getting the look that you need to
get," he said. "We're struggling to
get that full-speed kind of look,
because only they can give you
that look."
