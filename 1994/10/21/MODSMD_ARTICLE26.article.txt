# No lucky breaks
## Cardinal must snap OSU's wishbone running attack 
### Greg Collins Senior staff writer 
This weekend's matchup has
people uttering words that one
would never think of hearing
around the college football world
— Stanford is scared of Oregon
State.
Yes, the lowly Beavers, ugly
step-child to the fast-paced,
ultra-modern Pacific 10 Confer
ence, have developed an offense
that downright frightens oppo
nents. After languishing in back
to-back one-win seasons in 1991
and 1992, Oregon State (2-4, 1-3
in Pac-10) has firmly laid a claim
to the best wishbone offense in
the game.
Based on a simple three-play
offensive scheme which is
designed to pound the ball down
the other team's throat, the
Beavers' wishbone has them at
the top of the Pac-10 in rushing
and third in the nation, averag
ing 303.3 yards per game.
"They only run dive, keep and
pitch," said defensive coordina
tor Fred vonAppen. "If you stop
them a few times, it doesn't both
er them. They just come out and
keep running them and pretty
soon 'whoops' they hit one."
The Beavers have immersed
themselves so much in the wish
bone that they have only thrown
43 passes all year, completing 15.
However, they don't need to pass
to win — witness last week's 428
yards rushing against UCLA in a
23-14 Oregon State victory in
which the Beavers only attempt
ed four passes, all incomplete.
So what tricks do vonAppen
and head coach Bill Walsh have

in store?
"We can't go with 12, we've
tried that," Walsh said, joking
about Stanford's two penalties
for 12 men on the field against
USC last week. "Their team
speed and backfield speed is real
ly impressive."
VonAppen had a more
straightforward answer to the
bewildering Beavers.
"They force you to be patient
and task-specific," he said. "You
better tackle and you better get
off the blocks because you are not
going to get any free access to
running backs without beating a
blocker."
The coaching staff expects to
strengthen the interior of the
defense by playing senior Nate
Olsen and his 6-foot 4-inch, 252-
pound frame as inside lineback
er. Last year, the Cardinal had
similar success in using lineback
er Mark Hatzenbuhler to plug up
the middle, where he recorded 19
tackles.
Last season's game was
marked by a rushing exhibition
from the Beavers and aerial fire
works by Stanford in a 31-27 Car
dinal win. Oregon State ran for
338 yards while Steve Stenstrom
threw for a career-high 407 yards.
A late interception by cornerback
Eliel Swinton secured Stanford's
first Pac-10 victory of 1993.
Much like last year's squad,
the 1994 version of the Cardinal
(1-4-1, 0-3) enters the matchup
with the Beavers winless in Pac
-10 play. Despite the difficult
start, players on the team have
adapted their personal goals for

Freshman flanker Damon Dunn breaks into his pattern against USC
last Saturday. The Cardinal looks to break its pattern of self-destruc
tion this weekend against the Beavers.
