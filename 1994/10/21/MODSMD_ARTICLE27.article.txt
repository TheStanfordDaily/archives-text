# Top-ranked water polo hosts No. 4 Pacific

For the Stanford men's water polo
team, domination has been a main
theme this season.
Afler completely dismantling No. 2
USC last weekend at deGuerre Pool in
an 18-10 blowout, the top-ranked Car
dinal (14-1) will play host to University
of the Pacific this Saturday at noon.
Coach Dante Dettamanti and his
squad are looking to send the Tigers
packing just as they did the Trojans â€”
in convincing style.
"UOP is a very streaky team," said
senior Wolf Wigo. "They are potentially

a really good team, but they might
potentially roll over."
The Tigers are currently ranked No.

"just a notch below the top three (Stan
ford, USC and California)."

lighting up the scoreboard in any given
game, Dettamanti is wary of UOP, and
is not taking this first meeting of the
season with the Tigers lightly.
"This is the kind of team we've had
problems with in the past," Dettaman
ti said. "They always give us a good
game. Last year they beat us up at

in a row, so this is sort of a revenge
game for us."
Despite losing several of last year's
key players to graduation, Pacific coach
John Tanner, a former Ail-American at

Stanford, has seen continued success.
The Tigers opened the season by sur
prising USC, beating them in Los
Angeles.
Like his former coach Dettamanti,
Tanner emphasizes the fast break
counter-attack for his UOP teams. The
pace of the match should be quick, lead
ing to exciting, entertaining water polo.
The Cardinal may have too much man
power for the Tigers to handle, howev
er.
"With the loss of their seniors, they
lost some team speed," Wigo said.
"Instead of their counter-attack includ
ing all six men, they now have a two- or
