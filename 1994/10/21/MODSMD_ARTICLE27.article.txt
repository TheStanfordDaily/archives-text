# Top-ranked water polo hosts No. 4 Pacific
## 
### Kyle Utsumi Staff writer 
For the Stanford men's water polo
team, domination has been a main
theme this season.
Afler completely dismantling No. 2
USC last weekend at deGuerre Pool in
an 18-10 blowout, the top-ranked Car
dinal (14-1) will play host to University
of the Pacific this Saturday at noon.
Coach Dante Dettamanti and his
squad are looking to send the Tigers
packing just as they did the Trojans —
in convincing style.
"UOP is a very streaky team," said
senior Wolf Wigo. "They are potentially

a really good team, but they might
potentially roll over."
The Tigers are currently ranked No.
4 in the nation, thanks to recent victo
ries over UCLA, UC-Irvine and Pepper
dine. Dettamanti groups these teams,
"just a notch below the top three (Stan
ford, USC and California)."
While the Cardinal is capable of
lighting up the scoreboard in any given
game, Dettamanti is wary of UOP, and
is not taking this first meeting of the
season with the Tigers lightly.
"This is the kind of team we've had
problems with in the past," Dettaman
ti said. "They always give us a good
game. Last year they beat us up at

'UOP is a
very streaky
team.'

[Stockton] after we had won 16 games
in a row, so this is sort of a revenge
game for us."
Despite losing several of last year's
key players to graduation, Pacific coach
John Tanner, a former Ail-American at

Stanford, has seen continued success.
The Tigers opened the season by sur
prising USC, beating them in Los
Angeles.
Like his former coach Dettamanti,
Tanner emphasizes the fast break
counter-attack for his UOP teams. The
pace of the match should be quick, lead
ing to exciting, entertaining water polo.
The Cardinal may have too much man
power for the Tigers to handle, howev
er.
"With the loss of their seniors, they
lost some team speed," Wigo said.
"Instead of their counter-attack includ
ing all six men, they now have a two- or

three-man counter."
The Tigers are led by junior
Brad Schumacher is regarded as
the fastest player in the nation
and competes on the UOP men's
swim team as well. Schumacher's
speed is complemented by the
strong inside play of holeman Key
llivera. At the Northern Califor
nia Tournament earlier this
month, Rivera broke out for eight
goals against UCI.
Wigo heads Stanford's offense
having netted 37 points this sea
son, including a career-high six
last Saturday against USC. The
Cardinal enjoys a balanced attack,
however, as Dettamanti points to
several games in which all six of
his starters made it into the scor
ing column.
"These are the kind of teams
we need to beat," Dettamanti said.
"What worries me is if we don't
play our best they am knock us
off. losing to the No. 2 or No. 3
team wouldn't hurt us as much as
losing to a No. 4, 5 or 6."
The Cardinal has no thoughts
of letting that happen this week
end, as the contest will be the sec
ond-to-last home appearance for
the defending NCAA champions.
