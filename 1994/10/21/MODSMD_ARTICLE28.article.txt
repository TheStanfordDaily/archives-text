# Men's soccer to confront No. 4 Fresno State
## Cardinal must secure victory to remain alive in Mountain Division 
### Joseph Hei Staff writer 
"This is pretty much a make or break game."
That's how junior defender Mark Walker summa
rized the gravity of today's men's soccer match-up
with Fresno State. Stanford (3-9-2) needs a win to
keep its head above water in the Mountain Division.
The Cardinal must maintain a strong conference
record to sustain any hope of competing in the post
season.
The Bulldogs (12-1-1) will push hard to keep Stan
ford under. They come to the Farm with the
strongest record in the division and a No. 4 ranking
in the nation. The Bulldogs have not lost a game
since falling in their season-opener. The University
of Washington, who defeated the Cardinal 2-0 last
Sunday, is the only team in the division that has
managed to scratch Fresno State's armor — the
Huskies tied the Bulldogs 1-1 two weekends ago.
"Their record is one of the best," said head coach
Colin Lindores. "It's going to be a real David and
Goliath operation. We would have to play very, very
good defense [to beat them]. Whatever chances we're
given, whether we work for them or whether we get
them by accident, we would have to take advantage of."
The Cardinal battled the Bulldogs to a 1-1 tie
when the two teams met in Fresno last year. At that
time, both teams were in almost the exact same posi
tions as they are now — the Bulldogs were ranked in
the top 10 while Stanford was cleaving its way
through conference play, carrying the burden of a
poor early record.
"We demonstrated last year that we can beat them
even though they were ranked so high," Lindores
said.
This year, however, injuries to almost every key
starter have resulted in a rough season for the Cardi
nal. In this continuing tragedy, last weekend junior
forward Carmen D'Onofrio, who leads the squad
with five goals, suffered a knee iryury. The Cardinal
will rely upon freshman midfielder Eric Vandevelde,
who has four goals on the season, to pick up the slack.
On the other side of the field, the Bulldogs will be
led by freshman forward Steve Patterson, who has
eight goals for the season. Junior forwards Mark Fos
ter and Erik Farfan are not far behind with six and
seven goals, respectively.
In conference play, the Cardinal has shown that it

has the talent and ability to win. However, Stanford
has a tendency to commit key errors on both defense
and offense, and it will not be able to afford any
against the Bulldogs. Also, the Cardinal must not be
drawn into matching the Bulldogs' direct style of
play. Stanford has had problems with adjusting to
other teams' tempos and styles instead of asserting
its own more indirect passing tactics.

"We're going to come out and try to put things
together," Walker said. "Hopefully, we'll establish
our game without worrying about them. We should
be competitive."
Whatever the tactic or strategy the Cardinal
employs, it will have to fight against a very strong
current to stay afloat in the Mountain Division
today.
