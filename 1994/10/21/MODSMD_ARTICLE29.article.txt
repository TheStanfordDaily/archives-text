Predicting football scores with
me might not be as fulfilling as
working with Tony Danza in
front of the camera. Then again,
former child TV star Danny Pin
tauro might have nabbed his best
roll yet — as guest college football
prophet in the games of the week:
Stanford at Oregon State
It's a prognosticator's night
mare. Two of the worst football
teams this side of the Atlantic
meet in a battle for absolutely
nothing. It's the sports equiva
lent of the premiere showing of a
FOX sitcom. Boring, listless, dull,
and ugly.
After first flipping a coin and
drawing straws to predict the vic
tor, I finally decided to attempt
an educated guess on the out
come. The Beavers disposed of
UCLA last week — hosting a hob
bling Stanford squad in Corvallis
should be a task of similar diffi
culty. The fact that OSU nabbed
428 yards on the ground against
the Bruins last week leads one to
believe they'll collect at least
1,500 against the Cardinal
"defense." That ought to be
enough to pull out a victory.
Feeling the frustration that
has enveloped football fans at
Stanford, Dan sees relief in the
near future.
"It's come time that we've got
to win a game," he said. "We're
learning from our mistakes, or we
should be, and we've made an
awful lot of them."
That's a euphemism for "if we
don't win this weekend we'll offi
cially be the most rancid team in
the West." Anyway you preserve
it, there's already something rot
ten in Palo Alto.

California at USC
What a disappointing few
weeks for the Bears. They lost top
quarterback Dave Barr for the
season, suffered through an
embarrassing loss to Oregon, and
had to watch new QB Kerry
McGonigal complete only 33 per
cent of his passes in that game.
It's enough to make one want to
chuckle and cheer with vindictive
pleasure.
Dan thinks USC was in good
form last weekend in Stanford
Stadium. "USC had momentum
here," he said. "They won on the
road and now they're going
home."
If the Trojans can give their
QB as much protection as their
team name suggests, USC should
rack up huge numbers on offense.
Even if they're only 98 percent
effective, there'll be no risks
involved. The way Cal looked on
the field last week, the team
might as well be abstaining from
college football. After all, that's
the only way to be absolutely cer
tain that you don't lose.

No. 23 Washington State at
Arizona State
A lousy week in the Pac-10
forces me to pick this game to fill
space. The only way the Sun Dev
ils could win would be if the
Cougar defensive line melts to the
turf under the Arizona sun. And
don't bet on that, seeing how
WSU has allowed an average of
