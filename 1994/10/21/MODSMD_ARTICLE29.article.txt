## Danny takes on Reagan to determine 'Who's the Boss.' 
### 
Predicting football scores with
me might not be as fulfilling as
working with Tony Danza in
front of the camera. Then again,
former child TV star Danny Pin
tauro might have nabbed his best
roll yet — as guest college football
prophet in the games of the week:
Stanford at Oregon State
It's a prognosticator's night
mare. Two of the worst football
teams this side of the Atlantic
meet in a battle for absolutely
nothing. It's the sports equiva
lent of the premiere showing of a
FOX sitcom. Boring, listless, dull,
and ugly.
After first flipping a coin and
drawing straws to predict the vic
tor, I finally decided to attempt
an educated guess on the out
come. The Beavers disposed of
UCLA last week — hosting a hob
bling Stanford squad in Corvallis
should be a task of similar diffi
culty. The fact that OSU nabbed
428 yards on the ground against
the Bruins last week leads one to
believe they'll collect at least
1,500 against the Cardinal
"defense." That ought to be
enough to pull out a victory.
Feeling the frustration that
has enveloped football fans at
Stanford, Dan sees relief in the
near future.
"It's come time that we've got
to win a game," he said. "We're
learning from our mistakes, or we
should be, and we've made an
awful lot of them."
That's a euphemism for "if we
don't win this weekend we'll offi
cially be the most rancid team in
the West." Anyway you preserve
it, there's already something rot
ten in Palo Alto.

Dan: Stanford by 7
Reagan: Oregon State by 3
California at USC
What a disappointing few
weeks for the Bears. They lost top
quarterback Dave Barr for the
season, suffered through an
embarrassing loss to Oregon, and
had to watch new QB Kerry
McGonigal complete only 33 per
cent of his passes in that game.
It's enough to make one want to
chuckle and cheer with vindictive
pleasure.
Dan thinks USC was in good
form last weekend in Stanford
Stadium. "USC had momentum
here," he said. "They won on the
road and now they're going
home."
If the Trojans can give their
QB as much protection as their
team name suggests, USC should
rack up huge numbers on offense.
Even if they're only 98 percent
effective, there'll be no risks
involved. The way Cal looked on
the field last week, the team
might as well be abstaining from
college football. After all, that's
the only way to be absolutely cer
tain that you don't lose.
Dan: USC by 10
Reagan: USC by 7
No. 23 Washington State at
Arizona State
A lousy week in the Pac-10
forces me to pick this game to fill
space. The only way the Sun Dev
ils could win would be if the
Cougar defensive line melts to the
turf under the Arizona sun. And
don't bet on that, seeing how
WSU has allowed an average of


Reagan
Demas


Danny
Pintauro
only 6.5 points per game.
Dan thinks the Cougars will be
"fired up for this game" after a
last-second loss to Arizona last
week. "They'll ruin ASU."
If the Sun Devils don't end up
ruining themselves (their oppo
nents are averaging 30.5 points
per game), I'm sure WSU would
be happy to oblige.
Dan: WSU by 14
Reagan: WSU by 17
No. 9 Washington at Oregon
To all you Oregon football fans
(both of you) — don't count your
duck eggs before they hatch. Just
because your precious Oregon
football team is now 2-1 in the
Pac-10 and looking good, these
Ducks are still a far quack from

the Huskies. Probation won't
keep Washington from scoring
over 34 points, which the team
has accomplished in four of six
outings this season.
But I'll call it reasonably close.
Dan thought USC looked good
last week against Stanford, and
after Oregon disposed of the Tro
jans earlier in the month he
thinks the Ducks can come up big
against the Huskies. Unfortu
nately, he's missing the fact that
even a nursing home pick-up foot
ball squad could look good against
the Cardinal.
Dan: Oregon by 7
Reagan: Washington by 6
Oklahoma at Kansas
Have you figured out yet that
I'm a Big 8 Conference football
fan? Have you also figured out
that I'd probably have better luck
playing ping-pong with my ear
lobes than I have had predicting

Big 8 football scores this season?
Nevertheless, this time I'm
determined. The Sooners (God
bless 'em) are 3-3 now and in the
midst of a catastrophic free-fall.
They're still licking the wounds
from their 45-7 mauling by the
Buffaloes last week and might not
survive the surgery.
Dan could care less about this
match-up, which is disappointing
but understandable. The game
will be played in the Jayhawks'
home nest, the same stadium in
which Kansas delivered a 72-0
decimation of lowly Alabama-
Birmingham three weeks ago.
Certainly OU is no Ala-Birm, but
the Jayhawks are in the catbird
seat for this game.
Dan: Even
Reagan: Kansas by 3
No. 11 Michigan at Illinois
Here's my foot-in-mouth call
of the week. Call me stupid, call

me loony — you're probably
right. But the 4-2 Fighting Illini
have Michigan at home, and
after slaughtering lowa by 40
last week; they've got momen
tum.
Dan takes the ranked team in
this contest. He foresees the
Wolverines fighting back after
being trapped and skinned last
week.
I'm feeling vindictive — I bet
on the Wolverines to take care of
Penn State last week and they left
me eating my words for Sunday
brunch.
If I'm wrong again, I can plan
on having a four-course meal
delivered to my door Saturday
night.
Dan: Michigan by 21

Big 8 football scores this season?
Nevertheless, this time I'm
determined. The Sooners (God
bless 'em) are 3-3 now and in the
midst of a catastrophic free-fall.
They're still licking the wounds
from their 45-7 mauling by the
Buffaloes last week and might not
survive the surgery.
Dan could care less about this
match-up, which is disappointing
but understandable. The game
will be played in the Jayhawks'
home nest, the same stadium in
which Kansas delivered a 72-0
decimation of lowly Alabama-
Birmingham three weeks ago.
Certainly OU is no Ala-Birm, but
the Jayhawks are in the catbird
seat for this game.
Dan: Even
Reagan: Kansas by 3
No. 11 Michigan at Illinois
Here's my foot-in-mouth call
of the week. Call me stupid, call

me loony — you're probably
right. But the 4-2 Fighting Illini
have Michigan at home, and
after slaughtering lowa by 40
last week; they've got momen
tum.
Dan takes the ranked team in
this contest. He foresees the
Wolverines fighting back after
being trapped and skinned last
week.
I'm feeling vindictive — I bet
on the Wolverines to take care of
Penn State last week and they left
me eating my words for Sunday
brunch.
If I'm wrong again, I can plan
on having a four-course meal
delivered to my door Saturday
night.
Dan: Michigan by 21
Reagan: Illinois by 2
Cumulative:
Them: 13 for 17 (76%)

Senior fullback Melinda Minstrell guides the ball upfield against San
Diego. She and her teammates look to bounce back this weekend
after a tough 1-0 loss to No. 1 North Carolina.
Predicting football scores with
me might not be as fulfilling as
working with Tony Danza in
front of the camera. Then again,
former child TV star Danny Pin
tauro might have nabbed his best
roll yet — as guest college football
prophet in the games of the week:
Stanford at Oregon State
It's a prognosticator's night
mare. Two of the worst football
teams this side of the Atlantic
meet in a battle for absolutely
nothing. It's the sports equiva
lent of the premiere showing of a
FOX sitcom. Boring, listless, dull,
and ugly.
After first flipping a coin and
drawing straws to predict the vic
tor, I finally decided to attempt
an educated guess on the out
come. The Beavers disposed of
UCLA last week — hosting a hob
bling Stanford squad in Corvallis
should be a task of similar diffi
culty. The fact that OSU nabbed
428 yards on the ground against
the Bruins last week leads one to
believe they'll collect at least
1,500 against the Cardinal
"defense." That ought to be
enough to pull out a victory.
Feeling the frustration that
has enveloped football fans at
Stanford, Dan sees relief in the
near future.
"It's come time that we've got
to win a game," he said. "We're
learning from our mistakes, or we
should be, and we've made an
awful lot of them."
That's a euphemism for "if we
don't win this weekend we'll offi
cially be the most rancid team in
the West." Anyway you preserve
it, there's already something rot
ten in Palo Alto.

California at USC
What a disappointing few
weeks for the Bears. They lost top
quarterback Dave Barr for the
season, suffered through an
embarrassing loss to Oregon, and
had to watch new QB Kerry
McGonigal complete only 33 per
cent of his passes in that game.
It's enough to make one want to
chuckle and cheer with vindictive
pleasure.
Dan thinks USC was in good
form last weekend in Stanford
Stadium. "USC had momentum
here," he said. "They won on the
road and now they're going
home."
If the Trojans can give their
QB as much protection as their
team name suggests, USC should
rack up huge numbers on offense.
Even if they're only 98 percent
effective, there'll be no risks
involved. The way Cal looked on
the field last week, the team
might as well be abstaining from
college football. After all, that's
the only way to be absolutely cer
tain that you don't lose.
Dan: USC by 10
Reagan: USC by 7
No. 23 Washington State at
Arizona State
A lousy week in the Pac-10
forces me to pick this game to fill
space. The only way the Sun Dev
ils could win would be if the
Cougar defensive line melts to the
turf under the Arizona sun. And
don't bet on that, seeing how
WSU has allowed an average of


Reagan
Demas


Danny
Pintauro
only 6.5 points per game.
Dan thinks the Cougars will be
"fired up for this game" after a
last-second loss to Arizona last
week. "They'll ruin ASU."
If the Sun Devils don't end up
ruining themselves (their oppo
nents are averaging 30.5 points
per game), I'm sure WSU would
be happy to oblige.
Dan: WSU by 14
Reagan: WSU by 17
No. 9 Washington at Oregon
To all you Oregon football fans
(both of you) — don't count your
duck eggs before they hatch. Just
because your precious Oregon
football team is now 2-1 in the
Pac-10 and looking good, these
Ducks are still a far quack from

the Huskies. Probation won't
keep Washington from scoring
over 34 points, which the team
has accomplished in four of six
outings this season.
But I'll call it reasonably close.
Dan thought USC looked good
last week against Stanford, and
after Oregon disposed of the Tro
jans earlier in the month he
thinks the Ducks can come up big
against the Huskies. Unfortu
nately, he's missing the fact that
even a nursing home pick-up foot
ball squad could look good against
the Cardinal.
