# Speakers discuss diversity issues in higher education

### Brian Singer 
Two nationally-known speakers attempt
ed to explore sociological changes in diversi
ty and the necessity of building new commu
nities at yesterday's "Cross Cultural Excur
sions and Diversity Dilemmas" in Cubberly
Auditorium.
The event, sponsored by Residential Educa
tion and the Dean of Students' Office, focused
largely on cultural diversity in higher educa
tion, and drew an audience of about 75 people.
Troy Duster, director of the Institute for
the Study of Social Changes at UC-Berkeley,
spoke first and described his theory of the
three types of diversity experiences in society.
"The first experience is where one group
predominates so much that it comes to be
taken as normal," Duster said. He cited the

virtual absence of women law students in
1965 as an example of something that, at the
time, "just came naturally" to males.
"[The dominating groups] tend to consid
er minorities 'interesting phenomena,' " he
said. "You can choose to be benign and gra
cious or to treat them with scorn."
The second experience — the one tied
most closely to today's society — is an envi
ronment where there is no majority and no
group feels ownership, Duster said. "White
students for the first time in their lives feel
in the category 'white,' " he said. "It's dif
ferent, painful. They're being accused of
being white, charged of being white."
The second experience, Duster said, also
involves accusations by formally dominant
groups of "politics" by expanding
groups. "Latino and Black stu
dents like to see curricular change
for their group and more staff peo
ple of their own ethnicity," he
said. "White students say, 'That's
political.' " This is where accusa
tions of affirmative action begin,
Duster added.
In the third experience, Duster

said that despite possibility for
conflict inherent within differ
ence, "people can retain differ
ences and contribute to the public
sphere — a not-so-radical idea.
The only way contributions can be
made is if there are differences
which can be shared and enrich
the public sphere."
Duster defined segregation as
an outsider seeing other groups all
as the same. "The closer you are to
any ethnic group, the more you
see differentiation," he said. "The
more you're away from it, the

more you see sameness."
Utilizing Duster's theory of
three experiences, Joan Steinau
Lester, national columnist and
author of the new book "The
Future White Men and Other
Diversity Dilemmas," spoke next,
describing today's society as in
"stage 2.1."
"We've been trained not to see
what's happening to other people
out of our group," she said.
"That's what keeps oppression in
place."
Building friendships, Lester

said, is the key to building an
understanding community. "One
of the best ways to set out on an
excursion to reach across gulfs
that our history's have driven
between us is to create friend
ships," she said. "Until we really
know about each other, it is hard
to work for institutional change."
People do not readily approach
members of other cultural groups
because of a feeling of discomfort,
Lester said. "We are leaving the
shores of safety and are in the
middle of the sea," she said.
