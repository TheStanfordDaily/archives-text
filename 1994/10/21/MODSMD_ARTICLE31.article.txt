The Stanford club ice hockey
team takes to the road this week
end with a two game series begin
ning tonight against the Univer
sity of Oregon.
The long-awaited season open
er should be an exciting one,
according to coach Ernie Ferrari.
"They beat us last year, so we're
looking forward to going up there
and playing them again."
"I feel really positive about
this year's team," he added,
pointing out that although the
team needs more goal-scorers,
the defense is extremely power
ful. Key defensive players include
goalie Sami-Jo Small, who will
start in the net Friday, and fresh
man Matt Blythe.
In terms of scoring, the team
will look to senior co-captain
Luke Winter, who led the Pacific
Coast Hockey Association last
year in that department.
"We're playing some tough
teams this year, so it would be
nice to win a few games early,"
co-captain Eric Haug said.
After spending the past several
weeks practicing and forming
offensive and defensive lines for
this year's team, Ferrari feels the
squad is ready for its first game.
"It's time to play hockey," he
said. "No excuses."
