# Student summit to be held
## 
### Tamar Engel 
The fifth annual Leadership Summit this
Sunday will bring together student leaders
from the entire campus to identify concerns
requiring the attention of the ASSU and the
administration.
Sponsored by the ASSU and the Council
of Presidents, the summit was established to
give student leaders the opportunity to net
work and create joint programs. All heads of
student organizations, dorm representatives
and ASSU senators are invited to attend.

COP member Anietie Ekanem, who will
run the summit, said he hopes to take a dif
ferent approach this year.
"What seemed to happen is that in the
past years, the Leadership Summit was a
chance for people to network, and then there
wouldn't be much communication after that
night," he said. "This year we would like the
Leadership Summit to be the start to contin
ued communication throughout the year."
The COP wants to identify problems that
students need the administration
to resolve and then to take those
ideas to the administration for dis
cussion, Kkanem said. He added
that the COP has purposely held
off meeting with administrators
until after the summit takes place.
Fatty Ferguson, an undergrad
uate senator and member of the
AiSSU Student Affairs Commit
tee, said her group has several
ideas it wants to work on at the
summit.
Her ideas include improving

campus safety, talking to admin
istrators in the Office of Residen
tial Education about getting more
phones in the dorms, working on
class unity, possibly getting class
officers for next year and arrang
ing meetings with dorm represen
tatives to advocate their concerns.
Each of the senate's four com
mittees has brainstormed ideas to
discuss at the summit, Ferguson
said.
In addition, leaders of ethnic
groups on campus said they see
the summit as an opportunity to
voice their opinions to the student
government — a group which has
more contact with administrators
than individual students do.

The summit is also a way to
exchange strategies with other cul
tural groups — especially goals
that the communities share, said
Nicole Walden, co-chair of Stanford
American Indian Organization.
"It's a good way of networking
and feeding off other organiza
tions' ideas, and it gives us a
chance to organize as a group,"
she said.
SAIO will bring up the feasibil
ity of starting a Native American
Studies program at Stanford,
Walden said. Other ethnic com
munities have already formed
committees to establish new stud
ies programs. She also said she
hopes that contact with those peo

ple who have already faced the
opposition will make it easier to
turn new ideas into a reality.
The evening will begin at 5:00
p.m. in the Tresidder Oak Rooms
with a short reception, followed
by dinner. A speaker will follow
— possibly Cecilia Burciaga, for
merly both the Casa Zapata Resi
dent Fellow and highest-ranking
Chicana administrator at Stan
ford — and the summit will end
with a discussion section to iden
tify student interests and con
cerns.
Plans to reconvene for follow
up discussions will be arranged
during the conclusion, Ekanem
said.
