may have to tackle a host of
related issues to effectively
combat the problem — is

strong policy decisions.
Instead of instituting a "police state"
college setting — where residential advi

Stanford has always opted for a "safety

and binge drinking choices up to individual
students — sometimes ignoring such bla

frosh dorms. Binge drinking is defined as
having five or more drinks in a short period
of time.

director of Alcohol and Other Drug Abuse
Prevention Program at the Cowell Student
Health Center.

from alcohol scare her the most. Examples
of what she termed "second-hand binge

and vandalism."

Working models?
