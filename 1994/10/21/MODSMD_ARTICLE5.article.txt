drinking, the University
may have to tackle a host of
related issues to effectively
combat the problem — is
sues on which the Universi-

ty has often shied away from making
strong policy decisions.
Instead of instituting a "police state"
college setting — where residential advi
sors and campus enforcers actively moni
tor and restrict alcohol consumption —
Stanford has always opted for a "safety
net" approach, where resident assistants
and resident fellows provide counseling, in
formation and education only but do not
forbid action by students.
Inherent in this system has been a ten
dency for resident staffs to leave underage
and binge drinking choices up to individual
students — sometimes ignoring such bla

tant policy violations as keg parties in all
frosh dorms. Binge drinking is defined as
having five or more drinks in a short period
of time.
"Alcohol has become the 'drug of choice'
at Stanford. It comes up so much more
than other [problems)," said Elise Lenox,
director of Alcohol and Other Drug Abuse
Prevention Program at the Cowell Student
Health Center.
Lenox said harmful actions stemming
from alcohol scare her the most. Examples
of what she termed "second-hand binge
drinking" include "more harassment, as
saults, DUI (driving under the influence)
and vandalism."
Now, however, faced with startling new
findings on the prevalence of binge drink
ing coupled with heightened issues of liabil
ity, federal policy requirements and pres
sure from national fraternal chapters, the
University may find itself in the difficult
position of attempting to heighten policy
enforcement while maintaining the com
munity atmosphere the Office of Residen
tial Education does not intend to abandon.
Working models?
Other universities, faced with similar is-
sues, have taken measures to
restrict alcohol consumption that,
from the perspective of Stanford's
current policy, seem radical.
At Harvard, for example, orga
nizations and residences that are
sponsoring parties must utilize a
beverage authorization team com
prised of trained graduate stu
dents who check school IDs and
serve beverages, said Sarah Flat
ley, assistant dean of students at
Harvard.
And in South Bend, Ind.,
underage students at Notre Dame
are strictly forbidden from mak
ing their drinking practices pub
lic.
"The school residence staff has
a right to enter a room only if
drinking becomes public," said
Katharine Bridge, assistant direc
tor of Resident Life at Notre
Dame.
In addition, no beer kegs are
allowed on campus at Notre Dame
and alcohol is not allowed in any
hallways or common areas, such
as lounges.
Ix'slie Damski from the UCLA
Student Health Services, howev
er, said the school was at a turn
ing point similar to Stanford's.
Damski said she is ready to
present to the chancellor results
of a survey they recently conduct
ed which found that Caucasian
fraternity members are the
biggest binge drinkers on campus.
Eighty percent of Greeks admit
ted to binge drinking at least once
in the past month.
"It's the number one health
problem on campus," Damski
said.
Not 'enforcers'

Indeed, perhaps the largest
obstacle Stanford may face in
tightening its policy is a Residen
tial Education system that seems
disinclined to assume any kind of
enforcement capacity.
According to Ann Porteus, act
ing director of Residential Educa
tion, the University's idea is "not
to turn residence staff into
enforcers."
"(The aim] is for more atten
tion, focus and caring for binge
drinkers," she said.
While talk about decreasing
binge drinking has led some to
fear that residence assistants will
be asked to be more stringent and
restrict alcohol use in the dorms,
Porteus dismissed this notion as
"nothing but speculation."
Res Ed is not alone in its deter
mination to follow the Stanford's
traditional course and put coun
seling before punishment.
Dean of Students Michael
Jackson echoed the sentiment,
saying, "We want to reinforce
that we're a community."
"It's important to follow Uni
versity policy and guidelines," he
said, "but we need to look out for
each other and protect each
other."
Currently, RAs can refer a stu
dent they suspect of having an
alcohol or binge drinking problem
to an on-campus health service,
but cannot check to see that the
student took steps toward help, a
system that frustrates many.
Res Ed often finds itself lean
ing on services provided by Cowell
Student Health Center (their
Alcohol and other Drug Abuse
Prevention Program) and its
Counseling and Psychological
Services branch.
Cowell Student Health Center
has already targeted alcohol
abuse as the focus of a new pro
gram begun last year, Stanford

Community Partnership for Alco
hol and Drug Abuse Prevention.
"From the public health point
of view, it's a matter of taking
efforts to prevent alcohol-related
problems," said Cowell Director
Ira Friedman.
Cowell is working with differ
ent communities on campus to
address the problem of alcohol.
With help from a two-year,
$147,000 grant from the U.S.
Department of Education, Cowell
currently has 10 interns
employed who meet every week to
discuss the major problems that
each of their communities face
with regard to alcohol.
The interns represent 10 dif
ferent groups, including African
Americans, the disabled, mem
bers of fraternities and varsity
athletes.
After assessing the needs of
their respective communities, the
interns will then recommend pro
grams which could be implement
ed to decrease drug and alcohol
abuse.
The grant also gives each com
munity $500 to implement the
suggested programs.
The Greek factor
The current status of alcohol
on campus may be altered dra
matically in the next few years
without any University action at
all. Campus fraternities are cur
rently under considerable pres
sure from their national chapters
to close parties and limit large
containers, like beer kegs.
On a campus like Stanford's,
where Greek system parties
often dominate the social scene,
such a move could have dramatic
implications for campus drink
ing.
IFC President Tom Baranows
ki said that although some frater
nities are feeling pressure from

their national chapters to desig
nate BYOB nights, "nobody is
buckling down."
Last year, the Interfraternity
Council decided that on even
numbered days, any open party
had to abide by a "bring-your
own-beverage" policy. This meant
that no containers were allowed
at a party where more than three
times the number of hosting
members were present.
Although the alcohol policy
which the IFC approved last year
was neither very successful nor
strongly enforced, the IFC met
last night and decided not to
revise the policy until winter
quarter.
At the beginning of winter
quarter, however, fraternities
again will have the chance to sug
gest which nights they want des
ignated as BYOB nights.
"If nobody brings it forward
. . . all nights are open," Bara
nowski said. "As for now, we're
going to keep doing what we've
been doing."
Legal implications
Currently, the University can
not receive federal research funds
if it does not make a concerted
effort to abide by state alcohol
laws.
"There are federal require
ments to have and reasonably
enforce" an alcohol policy, said
Iris Brest of Stanford's Legal
Office.
In October 1990, Stanford's
alcohol policy went from a more
ambiguous policy that discour
aged drinking to one that strictly
prohibits underage drinking.
The change was made in
response to a 1990 federal law
that threatened loss of education
funds for post-secondary institu
tions that failed to implement
anti-alcohol rules.

Liability is another factor fac
ing underage drinkers and those
who buy them alcohol. Brest said
that liability cases are dealt on a
case-by-case basis, and the Uni
versity can be held responsible for
alcohol-related problems.
"We warn that a number of
people could be held responsible,"
including individuals, hosts of a
party and Stanford itself, she
said.
Currently the University policy
states that no dorm funds may be
used in a way that violates state
alcohol laws. Party planners and
those who buy kegs, however, can
still be held liable for underage
drinking under California state
law.
Stanford police, however, are
not planning any sort of crack
down, according to Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer.
"We don't have the manpower
to go out and patrol every party,"
he said.
Fraternal Affairs Advisor
Heather Dunn said party hosts
need to keep note who is under
the influence before and after
they arrive.
"People need to assess that
carefully," she added.
Defining the problem
Stanford's move comes in
response to a Columbia Universi
ty survey which has caught the
attention of colleges around the
nation and has put alcohol in the
forefront of the eyes of school offi
cials, Lenox said.
One in three college students
now drinks primarily to get
drunk, according to the national
survey conducted by the Center
on Addiction and Substance
Abuse at Columbia which
Edmonds cited in her State of
Student Affairs address last
week.

"[The report! gives us permis
sion to talk about" alcohol abuse
among students, Lenox said.
The Columbia report —
released last June — found that
students living in fraternity and
sorority housing report drinking
an average of 15 drinks a week. It
also found that 42 percent of stu
dents in college admitted to
engaging in binge drinking, as
opposed to the 33 percent who did
not attend college.
Dunn said the statistic on
binge drinking in the Columbia
report means that students aren't
necessarily consuming alcohol
during the week.
"We're talking about how
much alcohol is being provided"
on the weekends, she said, mean
ing that the problem may largely
be concentrated in the weekends,
while weekday drinking may not
be as common.
In addition to the Columbia
study, Edmonds is now waiting
for the results of a health needs
assessment study administered
by Cowell. The study was con
ducted during the spring of 1993
and partly addressed alcohol and
substance abuse.
Once made public, the study is
expected to provide information
about such issues as alcohol and
substance abuse on campus —
providing a more localized view
than the national Columbia sur
vey.
At this point Stanford may cre
ate a more coherent, enforceable
policy while still trying to main
tain the community atmosphere
in the dorms. In the meantime,
however, with such blatant Uni
versity policy violations continu
ing, an alcohol-related accident or
death could force the University
to justify its current alcohol policy
and its defend its attempts at
enforcing it.

sion to talk about" alcohol abuse
among students, Lenox said.
The Columbia report —
released last June — found that
students living in fraternity and
sorority housing report drinking
an average of 15 drinks a week. It
also found that 42 percent of stu
dents in college admitted to
engaging in binge drinking, as
opposed to the 33 percent who did
not attend college.
Dunn said the statistic on
binge drinking in the Columbia
report means that students aren't
necessarily consuming alcohol
during the week.
"We're talking about how
much alcohol is being provided"
on the weekends, she said, mean
ing that the problem may largely
be concentrated in the weekends,
while weekday drinking may not
be as common.
In addition to the Columbia
study, Edmonds is now waiting
for the results of a health needs
assessment study administered
by Cowell. The study was con
ducted during the spring of 1993
and partly addressed alcohol and
substance abuse.
Once made public, the study is
expected to provide information
about such issues as alcohol and
substance abuse on campus —
providing a more localized view
than the national Columbia sur
vey.
At this point Stanford may cre
ate a more coherent, enforceable
policy while still trying to main
tain the community atmosphere
in the dorms. In the meantime,
however, with such blatant Uni
versity policy violations continu
ing, an alcohol-related accident or
death could force the University
to justify its current alcohol policy
and its defend its attempts at
enforcing it.
In last week's State of Student Affairs ad
dress, Vice Provost and Dean for Student Af
fairs Mary Edmonds announced a new effort
by the University to exercise tighter control
over alcohol consumption on campus.

rally cry specifically aimed against binge

drinking, the University
may have to tackle a host of
related issues to effectively
combat the problem — is
sues on which the Universi-

ty has often shied away from making
strong policy decisions.
Instead of instituting a "police state"
college setting — where residential advi
sors and campus enforcers actively moni
tor and restrict alcohol consumption —
Stanford has always opted for a "safety
net" approach, where resident assistants
and resident fellows provide counseling, in
formation and education only but do not
forbid action by students.
Inherent in this system has been a ten
dency for resident staffs to leave underage
and binge drinking choices up to individual
students — sometimes ignoring such bla

tant policy violations as keg parties in all
frosh dorms. Binge drinking is defined as
having five or more drinks in a short period
of time.
"Alcohol has become the 'drug of choice'
at Stanford. It comes up so much more
than other [problems)," said Elise Lenox,
director of Alcohol and Other Drug Abuse
Prevention Program at the Cowell Student
Health Center.
Lenox said harmful actions stemming
from alcohol scare her the most. Examples
of what she termed "second-hand binge
drinking" include "more harassment, as
saults, DUI (driving under the influence)
and vandalism."
Now, however, faced with startling new
findings on the prevalence of binge drink
ing coupled with heightened issues of liabil
ity, federal policy requirements and pres
sure from national fraternal chapters, the
University may find itself in the difficult
position of attempting to heighten policy
enforcement while maintaining the com
munity atmosphere the Office of Residen
tial Education does not intend to abandon.
Working models?
Other universities, faced with similar is-
sues, have taken measures to
restrict alcohol consumption that,
from the perspective of Stanford's
current policy, seem radical.
At Harvard, for example, orga
nizations and residences that are
sponsoring parties must utilize a
beverage authorization team com
prised of trained graduate stu
dents who check school IDs and
serve beverages, said Sarah Flat
ley, assistant dean of students at
Harvard.
And in South Bend, Ind.,
underage students at Notre Dame
are strictly forbidden from mak
ing their drinking practices pub
lic.
"The school residence staff has
a right to enter a room only if
drinking becomes public," said
Katharine Bridge, assistant direc
tor of Resident Life at Notre
Dame.
In addition, no beer kegs are
allowed on campus at Notre Dame
and alcohol is not allowed in any
hallways or common areas, such
as lounges.
Ix'slie Damski from the UCLA
Student Health Services, howev
er, said the school was at a turn
ing point similar to Stanford's.
Damski said she is ready to
present to the chancellor results
of a survey they recently conduct
ed which found that Caucasian
fraternity members are the
biggest binge drinkers on campus.
Eighty percent of Greeks admit
ted to binge drinking at least once
in the past month.
"It's the number one health
problem on campus," Damski
said.
Not 'enforcers'

Indeed, perhaps the largest
obstacle Stanford may face in
tightening its policy is a Residen
tial Education system that seems
disinclined to assume any kind of
enforcement capacity.
According to Ann Porteus, act
ing director of Residential Educa
tion, the University's idea is "not
to turn residence staff into
enforcers."
"(The aim] is for more atten
tion, focus and caring for binge
drinkers," she said.
While talk about decreasing
binge drinking has led some to
fear that residence assistants will
be asked to be more stringent and
restrict alcohol use in the dorms,
Porteus dismissed this notion as
"nothing but speculation."
Res Ed is not alone in its deter
mination to follow the Stanford's
traditional course and put coun
seling before punishment.
Dean of Students Michael
Jackson echoed the sentiment,
saying, "We want to reinforce
that we're a community."
"It's important to follow Uni
versity policy and guidelines," he
said, "but we need to look out for
each other and protect each
other."
Currently, RAs can refer a stu
dent they suspect of having an
alcohol or binge drinking problem
to an on-campus health service,
but cannot check to see that the
student took steps toward help, a
system that frustrates many.
Res Ed often finds itself lean
ing on services provided by Cowell
Student Health Center (their
Alcohol and other Drug Abuse
Prevention Program) and its
Counseling and Psychological
Services branch.
Cowell Student Health Center
has already targeted alcohol
abuse as the focus of a new pro
gram begun last year, Stanford

Community Partnership for Alco
hol and Drug Abuse Prevention.
"From the public health point
of view, it's a matter of taking
efforts to prevent alcohol-related
problems," said Cowell Director
Ira Friedman.
Cowell is working with differ
ent communities on campus to
address the problem of alcohol.
With help from a two-year,
$147,000 grant from the U.S.
Department of Education, Cowell
currently has 10 interns
employed who meet every week to
discuss the major problems that
each of their communities face
with regard to alcohol.
The interns represent 10 dif
ferent groups, including African
Americans, the disabled, mem
bers of fraternities and varsity
athletes.
After assessing the needs of
their respective communities, the
interns will then recommend pro
grams which could be implement
ed to decrease drug and alcohol
abuse.
The grant also gives each com
munity $500 to implement the
suggested programs.
The Greek factor
The current status of alcohol
on campus may be altered dra
matically in the next few years
without any University action at
all. Campus fraternities are cur
rently under considerable pres
sure from their national chapters
to close parties and limit large
containers, like beer kegs.
On a campus like Stanford's,
where Greek system parties
often dominate the social scene,
such a move could have dramatic
implications for campus drink
ing.
IFC President Tom Baranows
ki said that although some frater
nities are feeling pressure from

their national chapters to desig
nate BYOB nights, "nobody is
buckling down."
Last year, the Interfraternity
Council decided that on even
numbered days, any open party
had to abide by a "bring-your
own-beverage" policy. This meant
that no containers were allowed
at a party where more than three
times the number of hosting
members were present.
Although the alcohol policy
which the IFC approved last year
was neither very successful nor
strongly enforced, the IFC met
last night and decided not to
revise the policy until winter
quarter.
At the beginning of winter
quarter, however, fraternities
again will have the chance to sug
gest which nights they want des
ignated as BYOB nights.
"If nobody brings it forward
. . . all nights are open," Bara
nowski said. "As for now, we're
going to keep doing what we've
been doing."
Legal implications
Currently, the University can
not receive federal research funds
if it does not make a concerted
effort to abide by state alcohol
laws.
"There are federal require
ments to have and reasonably
enforce" an alcohol policy, said
Iris Brest of Stanford's Legal
Office.
In October 1990, Stanford's
alcohol policy went from a more
ambiguous policy that discour
aged drinking to one that strictly
prohibits underage drinking.
The change was made in
response to a 1990 federal law
that threatened loss of education
funds for post-secondary institu
tions that failed to implement
anti-alcohol rules.

Liability is another factor fac
ing underage drinkers and those
who buy them alcohol. Brest said
that liability cases are dealt on a
case-by-case basis, and the Uni
versity can be held responsible for
alcohol-related problems.
"We warn that a number of
people could be held responsible,"
including individuals, hosts of a
party and Stanford itself, she
said.
Currently the University policy
states that no dorm funds may be
used in a way that violates state
alcohol laws. Party planners and
those who buy kegs, however, can
still be held liable for underage
drinking under California state
law.
Stanford police, however, are
not planning any sort of crack
down, according to Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer.
"We don't have the manpower
to go out and patrol every party,"
he said.
Fraternal Affairs Advisor
Heather Dunn said party hosts
need to keep note who is under
the influence before and after
they arrive.
"People need to assess that
carefully," she added.
Defining the problem
Stanford's move comes in
response to a Columbia Universi
ty survey which has caught the
attention of colleges around the
nation and has put alcohol in the
forefront of the eyes of school offi
cials, Lenox said.
One in three college students
now drinks primarily to get
drunk, according to the national
survey conducted by the Center
on Addiction and Substance
Abuse at Columbia which
Edmonds cited in her State of
Student Affairs address last
week.

"[The report! gives us permis

who buy them alcohol. Brest said
that liability cases are dealt on a
case-by-case basis, and the Uni
versity can be held responsible for
alcohol-related problems.
"We warn that a number of
people could be held responsible,"
including individuals, hosts of a
party and Stanford itself, she
said.
Currently the University policy
states that no dorm funds may be
used in a way that violates state
alcohol laws. Party planners and
those who buy kegs, however, can
still be held liable for underage
drinking under California state
law.
Stanford police, however, are
not planning any sort of crack
down, according to Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer.
"We don't have the manpower
to go out and patrol every party,"
he said.
Fraternal Affairs Advisor
Heather Dunn said party hosts
need to keep note who is under
the influence before and after
they arrive.
"People need to assess that
carefully," she added.
Defining the problem
Stanford's move comes in
response to a Columbia Universi
ty survey which has caught the
attention of colleges around the
nation and has put alcohol in the
forefront of the eyes of school offi
cials, Lenox said.
One in three college students
now drinks primarily to get
drunk, according to the national
survey conducted by the Center
on Addiction and Substance
Abuse at Columbia which
Edmonds cited in her State of
Student Affairs address last
week.

"[The report! gives us permis
sion to talk about" alcohol abuse
among students, Lenox said.
The Columbia report —
released last June — found that
students living in fraternity and
sorority housing report drinking
an average of 15 drinks a week. It
also found that 42 percent of stu
dents in college admitted to
engaging in binge drinking, as
opposed to the 33 percent who did
not attend college.
Dunn said the statistic on
binge drinking in the Columbia
report means that students aren't
necessarily consuming alcohol
during the week.
"We're talking about how
much alcohol is being provided"
on the weekends, she said, mean
ing that the problem may largely
be concentrated in the weekends,
while weekday drinking may not
be as common.
In addition to the Columbia
study, Edmonds is now waiting
for the results of a health needs
assessment study administered
by Cowell. The study was con
ducted during the spring of 1993
and partly addressed alcohol and
substance abuse.
Once made public, the study is
expected to provide information
about such issues as alcohol and
substance abuse on campus —
providing a more localized view
than the national Columbia sur
vey.
At this point Stanford may cre
ate a more coherent, enforceable
policy while still trying to main
tain the community atmosphere
in the dorms. In the meantime,
however, with such blatant Uni
versity policy violations continu
ing, an alcohol-related accident or
death could force the University
to justify its current alcohol policy
and its defend its attempts at
enforcing it.
In last week's State of Student Affairs ad
dress, Vice Provost and Dean for Student Af
fairs Mary Edmonds announced a new effort
by the University to exercise tighter control
over alcohol consumption on campus.
Though her announcement comes as a
rally cry specifically aimed against binge

drinking, the University
may have to tackle a host of
related issues to effectively
combat the problem — is
sues on which the Universi-

ty has often shied away from making
strong policy decisions.
Instead of instituting a "police state"
college setting — where residential advi
sors and campus enforcers actively moni
tor and restrict alcohol consumption —
Stanford has always opted for a "safety
net" approach, where resident assistants
and resident fellows provide counseling, in
formation and education only but do not
forbid action by students.
Inherent in this system has been a ten
dency for resident staffs to leave underage
and binge drinking choices up to individual
students — sometimes ignoring such bla

tant policy violations as keg parties in all
frosh dorms. Binge drinking is defined as
having five or more drinks in a short period
of time.
"Alcohol has become the 'drug of choice'
at Stanford. It comes up so much more
than other [problems)," said Elise Lenox,
director of Alcohol and Other Drug Abuse
Prevention Program at the Cowell Student
Health Center.
Lenox said harmful actions stemming
from alcohol scare her the most. Examples
of what she termed "second-hand binge
drinking" include "more harassment, as
saults, DUI (driving under the influence)
and vandalism."
Now, however, faced with startling new
findings on the prevalence of binge drink
ing coupled with heightened issues of liabil
ity, federal policy requirements and pres
sure from national fraternal chapters, the
University may find itself in the difficult
position of attempting to heighten policy
enforcement while maintaining the com
munity atmosphere the Office of Residen
tial Education does not intend to abandon.
Working models?
Other universities, faced with similar is-
sues, have taken measures to
restrict alcohol consumption that,
from the perspective of Stanford's
current policy, seem radical.
At Harvard, for example, orga
nizations and residences that are
sponsoring parties must utilize a
beverage authorization team com
prised of trained graduate stu
dents who check school IDs and
serve beverages, said Sarah Flat
ley, assistant dean of students at
Harvard.
And in South Bend, Ind.,
underage students at Notre Dame
are strictly forbidden from mak
ing their drinking practices pub
lic.
"The school residence staff has
a right to enter a room only if
drinking becomes public," said
Katharine Bridge, assistant direc
tor of Resident Life at Notre
Dame.
In addition, no beer kegs are
allowed on campus at Notre Dame
and alcohol is not allowed in any
hallways or common areas, such
as lounges.
Ix'slie Damski from the UCLA
Student Health Services, howev
er, said the school was at a turn
ing point similar to Stanford's.
Damski said she is ready to
present to the chancellor results
of a survey they recently conduct
ed which found that Caucasian
fraternity members are the
biggest binge drinkers on campus.
Eighty percent of Greeks admit
ted to binge drinking at least once
in the past month.
"It's the number one health
problem on campus," Damski
said.
Not 'enforcers'

Indeed, perhaps the largest
obstacle Stanford may face in
tightening its policy is a Residen
tial Education system that seems
disinclined to assume any kind of
enforcement capacity.
According to Ann Porteus, act
ing director of Residential Educa
tion, the University's idea is "not
to turn residence staff into
enforcers."
"(The aim] is for more atten
tion, focus and caring for binge
drinkers," she said.
While talk about decreasing
binge drinking has led some to
fear that residence assistants will
be asked to be more stringent and
restrict alcohol use in the dorms,
Porteus dismissed this notion as
"nothing but speculation."
Res Ed is not alone in its deter
mination to follow the Stanford's
traditional course and put coun
seling before punishment.
Dean of Students Michael
Jackson echoed the sentiment,
saying, "We want to reinforce
that we're a community."
"It's important to follow Uni
versity policy and guidelines," he
said, "but we need to look out for
each other and protect each
other."
Currently, RAs can refer a stu
dent they suspect of having an
alcohol or binge drinking problem
to an on-campus health service,
but cannot check to see that the
student took steps toward help, a
system that frustrates many.
Res Ed often finds itself lean
ing on services provided by Cowell
Student Health Center (their
Alcohol and other Drug Abuse
Prevention Program) and its
Counseling and Psychological
Services branch.
Cowell Student Health Center
has already targeted alcohol
abuse as the focus of a new pro
gram begun last year, Stanford

Community Partnership for Alco
hol and Drug Abuse Prevention.
"From the public health point
of view, it's a matter of taking
efforts to prevent alcohol-related
problems," said Cowell Director
Ira Friedman.
Cowell is working with differ
ent communities on campus to
address the problem of alcohol.
With help from a two-year,
$147,000 grant from the U.S.
Department of Education, Cowell
currently has 10 interns
employed who meet every week to
discuss the major problems that
each of their communities face
with regard to alcohol.
The interns represent 10 dif
ferent groups, including African
Americans, the disabled, mem
bers of fraternities and varsity
athletes.
After assessing the needs of
their respective communities, the
interns will then recommend pro
grams which could be implement
ed to decrease drug and alcohol
abuse.
The grant also gives each com
munity $500 to implement the
suggested programs.
The Greek factor
The current status of alcohol
on campus may be altered dra
matically in the next few years
without any University action at
all. Campus fraternities are cur
rently under considerable pres
sure from their national chapters
to close parties and limit large
containers, like beer kegs.
On a campus like Stanford's,
where Greek system parties
often dominate the social scene,
such a move could have dramatic
implications for campus drink
ing.
IFC President Tom Baranows
ki said that although some frater
nities are feeling pressure from

their national chapters to desig
nate BYOB nights, "nobody is
buckling down."
Last year, the Interfraternity
Council decided that on even
numbered days, any open party
had to abide by a "bring-your
own-beverage" policy. This meant
that no containers were allowed
at a party where more than three
times the number of hosting
members were present.
Although the alcohol policy
which the IFC approved last year
was neither very successful nor
strongly enforced, the IFC met
last night and decided not to
revise the policy until winter
quarter.
At the beginning of winter
quarter, however, fraternities
again will have the chance to sug
gest which nights they want des
ignated as BYOB nights.
"If nobody brings it forward
. . . all nights are open," Bara
nowski said. "As for now, we're
going to keep doing what we've
been doing."
Legal implications
Currently, the University can
not receive federal research funds
if it does not make a concerted
effort to abide by state alcohol
laws.
"There are federal require
ments to have and reasonably
enforce" an alcohol policy, said
Iris Brest of Stanford's Legal
Office.
In October 1990, Stanford's
alcohol policy went from a more
ambiguous policy that discour
aged drinking to one that strictly
prohibits underage drinking.
The change was made in
response to a 1990 federal law
that threatened loss of education
funds for post-secondary institu
tions that failed to implement
anti-alcohol rules.

Liability is another factor fac
ing underage drinkers and those
who buy them alcohol. Brest said
that liability cases are dealt on a
case-by-case basis, and the Uni
versity can be held responsible for
alcohol-related problems.
"We warn that a number of
people could be held responsible,"
including individuals, hosts of a
