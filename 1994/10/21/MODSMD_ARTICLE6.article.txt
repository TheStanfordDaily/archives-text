# Campus groups thrive on funds from Casper

In an effort to reward creativity and in
novation at Stanford, University President
Gerhard Casper's newly created Presi
dent's Fund has granted five organizations
a total of $1,551,000.
The fund, generated by a group of 80
donors, passed its goal of raising $1 million
in its first year of existence, Casper said.
The President's Fund was established last
year because Casper found a dearth of
money "to do unusual things, innovative
things," he said.
Casper chose to give $491,000 to the Tuna
Research and Conservation Center at Hop
kins Marine Station, $410,000 to the Hoover
Library Catalog Conversion Project, and
$300,000 to the Flexible Class Lab Project.
He also granted $200,000 to the Lively Arts
at Stanford and $150,000 to the Overseas
Studies Information Technology Project.
Casper said he consulted with Provost
Condoleezza Rice in deciding which organi
zations to fund and notified the organiza
tions in July.

The 80 President's Fund contributors
each must give a minimum of $10,000 an
nually. This year, the average gift amount
ed to $19,000, and donations totaled $1.5
million. The group consists mostly of


Michael Slemmer â€” Daily
trustees, former trustees and
other strong supporters of the
University, Casper said.
In return for participation in
the fund, donors were invited to
spend an afternoon at Stanford to
hear reports on three of the five
projects that were funded, so that
the donors "really knew what
their money was going for,"
Casper said.
The Tuna Research and Con
servation Center, run by the Hop
kins Marine Station and the Mon
terey Bay Aquarium, is "the very
first tuna research facility in the

world," said Barbara Block, the
center's co-director.
With its $491,000 grant, the
center hopes to finish its second
phase of construction by the end of
the year, she said. The new addi
tion includes a 300-square foot dry
lab, which might be completed by
the end of the year, and a 1,200-
square foot wet lab, finished "some
time in '95," Block said.
Half of the money will also be
used to construct a moving water
flume by June for the study of
tunas in a fixed position, Block
said.
"There are no words to
describe how elated we are. . . .
President Casper's gift has
allowed me ... to move forward at
a pace that wouldn't have been

possible," she said.
At the Hoover Library, the
money is also "something we're
grateful to have," Deputy Direc
tor Charles Palm said.
The catalog conversion project
will use its $410,000 to form an
electronic data base file that stu
dents can consult from any com
puter on campus, which will be
merged with catalogs of other
campuses and available to schol
ars from around the world, Palm
said.
The Hoover Library consists of
1.6 million volumes and journals,
and houses 40 million documents
on political, social and economic
change in its archives.
Palm did not expect the com
pletion of the catalog until a year

or two from now, since 106,000
records remain to be catalogued.
The Flexible Class-Lab Project,
directed by Charles Kerns, head
of the Media Center, is developing
ways to integrate technology into
the classroom in a more efficient
manner.
The class-lab, to be located on
Meyer Library's second floor, will
consist of "wireless but complete
ly networked computers," said
Senior Associate Dean of Human
ities and Sciences John
Etchemendy, who hopes to take
advantage of the new class-lab for
his students as soon as winter
quarter.
Current technology in the
classrooms is cumbersome
because it sometimes prevents

people from seeing the professor
and it is noisy, he said. The new
lab computers would u T se infrarpH
wireless technology tnat would be
noiseless and compact enough to
take out when needed.
"When you didn't need [the
computer], it wouldn't be sitting
in front of the student making
noise," Etchemendy said.
The Lively Arts will put its
money toward developing new
sources of funding as the Universi
ty's financial support has dropped
82 percent in the past four years,
said Lois Wagner, director of Stan
ford Events and Services.
By Dec. 1, it will hire a special
ist to find local businesses to
sponsor programs and to obtain a
"volunteer corps" to offset the

loss of staff from budget cuts.
Overseas Studies plans to
improve its technology on Stan
ford's overseas campuses through
"software and hardware improve
ments and acquisitions overseas
and at home," said Corb Smith,
Deputy Director of Overseas
Studies.
The speed of the technology
overseas is a major problem that
Overseas Studies intends to tack
le, Smith said. Upgrading the sys
tems will allow the students there
"to access Socrates or Folio as
though they were here in Califor
nia," he added.
The new systems may be fin
ished within this year and "at
most within the next two," Smith
said.
