Katharine Ku doesn't have a mo
ment to spare. As the director of Stan
ford's Office of Technology Licensing
and Sponsored Projects Office, she
oversees the licensing of all Stanford
patents and inventions.
Despite her packed days approving
multimillion-dollar inventions and

encouraging better faculty and indus
try connections, Ku still finds the time
to call senior, Cindy Lai — just to talk.
Ku and Lai are both part of the
Asian-American Interactive Mentor

has 100 prospective sophomore

Lai said she joined the program last
year to gain a stronger identity of who
she is.
"Kathy is a role model, a great
foundation to build on," she said.
Lai not only left the program with
the image of Ku as "a very inspira
tional, good role model," but also with
the knowledge that "there was some
one who had made it."
"Kathy definitely breaks all stereo
types because the media portrays
Asian women as meek," Lai said. "She
had so much potential, and to me, she
has fulfilled her potential."
Lai said that she and Ku often meet
lor lunch and talk on the phone.
"One time, Kathy brought along
