Katharine Ku doesn't have a mo
ment to spare. As the director of Stan
ford's Office of Technology Licensing
and Sponsored Projects Office, she
oversees the licensing of all Stanford
patents and inventions.
Despite her packed days approving
multimillion-dollar inventions and

encouraging better faculty and indus
try connections, Ku still finds the time
to call senior, Cindy Lai — just to talk.
Ku and Lai are both part of the
Asian-American Interactive Mentor
ing Program, which started as a pilot
project in 1993-94. The program now
has 100 prospective sophomore
mentees and 45 Asian-American fac
ulty mentors.

The purpose of t he program is to es
tablish ongoing relationships between
sophomores and older Asian-Ameri
can role models.
"The disparity of Asian-American
faculty members and students makes
it hard to find role models," said Anne
Wong, co-coordinator of the program.
Mentors and mentees talk about
ethnic identity, personal goals o" sim
ply about their daily lives.
"We hit it off from the beginrrng. I
could call her any time," Lai said.
"Other than my friends, she was al
ways there for me."
Lai said she joined the program last
year to gain a stronger identity of who
she is.
"Kathy is a role model, a great
foundation to build on," she said.
Lai not only left the program with
the image of Ku as "a very inspira
tional, good role model," but also with
the knowledge that "there was some
one who had made it."
"Kathy definitely breaks all stereo
types because the media portrays
Asian women as meek," Lai said. "She
had so much potential, and to me, she
has fulfilled her potential."
Lai said that she and Ku often meet
lor lunch and talk on the phone.
"One time, Kathy brought along

said she believes that Ku "is
in the middle of both cultures."
She added that Ku represents a
woman who holds on to her Asian
heritage and also competes suc
cessfully in American society.
Because of Ku's experiences
with both cultures, Lai said she
discusses issues with Ku that she
would never have brought up
with her parents or friends.
One issue that they discussed
concerned the barriers that
Asian-American career women
may face, like the lack of female
role models and precedents in the
workplace. Ku, like Lai, grew up
in a predominantly Caucasian
neighborhood. But unlike Lai,
she said her college experience
was "less integrated."
"The generational differences
surprised me," said Ku, who
attended college with few other
Asian-Americans.

Ku joined the program "to get
in touch with Asian students and
to be a role model."
Based on her experiences as an
Asian-American woman, Ku said
that one Chinese proverb has par
ticularly helped her.
"It says something like this:
'Working is easy; working well
with people is the challenge.' I
think that is true." Ku said.
Although Lai had joined the
program as a junior, the program
is primarily geared toward sopho
mores.
"The program is structured to
target sophomores because fresh
men already have a lot of sup
port," Wong said.
"In sophomore year . . . it's
kind of like, 'Oh, now there are
other freshmen, so what am I
going to do?"'
Next year, Lai will attend the
University of Southern California
Medical School with the goal of
pursuing family practice or pri
mary care in Southern California.
But once in a while, when medi
cal school can be too much, I,ai said
she knows she can still call Ku and
