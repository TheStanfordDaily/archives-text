John Edgar Wideman
Fatheralong:
A Meditation on Fathers
and sone, Race and Society
(Pantheon Books, $21.00)
In the tradition o! his bestselling Brothers
and Keepers, Wideman has written an
intensely personal memoir and a fierce public manifesto. As Wideman
recalls his own past and the various meanings his father held for him,
he comes to a better understanding of himself both as a son and, ulti
mately, as a father to his own children. Fatheralong is also the story of
all parents and children who must struggle
against the destructive beliefs about race that
threaten their relationships. Wideman's previ
ous books include:
• All Stories are True • Damballah
• Hiding Place • Identities •
Philadelphia Fire
Fatheralong
has been nominated for a
1994 National Book Award.
(Three winners will be announced November 16, 1994.)
This event will be held at the Bookstore on campus.
