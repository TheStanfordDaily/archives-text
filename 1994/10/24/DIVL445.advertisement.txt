TRILOGY
ENTREPRENEUR CLUB
Five years ago, TRILOGY existed only in the minds of 4
Stanford students. Today, TRILOGY is one of the fastest
growing software companies in the country.
We understand entrepreneurial spirit, and we know where it can take you. By
establishing the TRILOGY Entrepreneur Club, we intend to address the need for
a formal undergraduate business organization on the Stanford campus. The
mission is to encourage the development of entrepreneurial ventures, and to
provide students with an advisory board to help make them successful. This
student run service club, co-sponsored by TRILOGY and the ASSU, will create a
forum for interaction between students, faculty, alumni, and the business
community. Quarterly meetings, speaking events, and workshops will start
Winter quarter. We look forward to seeing you!
We're looking for student officers
who will turn this club into a
tremendous success.
We're screening resumes for extremely motivated students to fill the roles of
President, Marketing Director, Financial Officer, and Event Coordinator. Please
turn in your resume and cover letter, detailing why you are qualified for one or
more of the positions, to Gabe Lucas at the ASSU (2nd floor Tresidder) by
Monday, October 31st.
Questions? Please contact Gabe Lucas at the ASSU. 725-1461
