# Tree-planters work 'magic' in foothills
## Weekend work crew battles rodents, cows to plant new generation of oaks 
### Justin Pollard Staff writer 
As the mighty oaks of the
Foothills approach their final
years, a forward-looking organi
zation is planting a new genera
tion of trees to take their place.
Every Saturday morning,
Magic Inc., based in Palo Alto,
leads a group of volunteers —
including Stanford students,
Magic associates and community
members — to plant and care for
young oak trees in the Foothills.
Magic aims to promote person
al health, social cooperation and
environmental restoration
through such activities as yoga
classes, workshops and the tree
planting project. Members of the
organization are known as magic
associates.
The organization has been
coordinating efforts to replant
oak trees in the Foothills for more
than 15 years.
"I think [tree planting) is great
because its necessary to preserve
this area," said senior Matt
Thompson, who volunteers
through the Alpha Phi Omega
service fraternity. "The trees are
dying and its important to main
tain the vegetation up here."
The non-profit corporation
began its project in the 1970s
when people from Magic noticed
that while there were plenty of
older oaks in the Foothills, there
were only a few younger ones,
according to Dave Muffley, a
Magic associate.
"We thought there were going
to be fewer and fewer oaks, and

eventually no oaks" if something
was not done to remedy the situa
tion, Muffley said.
In addition to replanting oaks
in the Foothills, Magic began urg
ing Stanford to take better care of
the oak population.
As a result, in 1984, Stanford
prepared a Vegetation Manage
ment Plan, which aimed to restore
oak populations, and has hired
Magic to implement the plan.
One of the first problems
Magic ran into was that of
rodents eating the acorns, as well
as the young saplings, the group
planted. Rodents also eat the
acorns which fall from trees, pre
venting the oaks from reproduc
ing.
"It's pretty amazing the devas
tation rodents can do," said
Trevor Taylor, project co-coordi
nator for Magic. Once, the group
planted 1,000 trees and they were
all eaten by rodents, he said.
The rodent population has
exploded because of the disap
pearance of many of their preda
tors, said Muffley.
Though there are still many
birds of prey in the area, the pop
ulation of mammal predators has
declined sharply because the
reserve is surrounded on all four
sides by major roads, Taylor said.
The tree-planters have also
had to deal with cattle grazing in
the foothills.
"The [exoticl plants were
brought over as food for cattle,"
Taylor said. Where cattle are
grazing, "it's really degrading the
ecosystem," he added.
Cattle grazing "seems to be a

big contributor to the disintegra
tion of the natural environment,
said sophomore Tara Walters, a
volunteer tree planter. "You am
tell the difference between land
scapes where cattle have grazed
and where they haven't," she
added.

Tree planting is hard work
but it's very useful, said senior
Linda Wang. "I'm going to come
back in a few years to see if the
trees we planted are still here,'
she added.
