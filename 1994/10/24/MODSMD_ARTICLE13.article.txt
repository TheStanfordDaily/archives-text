Violence claims 61 lives in Afghanistan

KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) -
Rockets slammed into the cen
ter of the ruined Afghan capi
tal yesterday, killing six people
and bringing to at least 61 the
death toll in three days of
fierce factional fighting, hospi
tal officials said.
The exact death toll is
impossible to know because
people seldom bring their
dead to a hospital, instead
burying them immediately in
keeping with strict Islamic
tradition.
At least 200 people have
been wounded since Friday.
The capital, battered by
incessant rocketing from war

ring Islamic leaders, was pum
meled Friday by hundreds of
rockets, witnesses said.
"Where are our leaders?
They are too afraid of the peo
ple to come to the city that
they have destroyed," said
Mohammed Anwar, a witness
to yesterday's carnage. "These
leaders, they are not Afghans."
Afghanistan's nine main
Islamic groups have waged a
bitter battle for power since
overthrowing the old commu
nist regime in April 1992.
Most estimates say at least
15,000 people, mostly civilians,
have been killed in the past
two years.
