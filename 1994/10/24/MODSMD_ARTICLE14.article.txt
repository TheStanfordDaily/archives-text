COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) â€”
A bomb blast at an election rally
outside Colombo killed about 50
people yesterday, including the
opposition candidate for presi
dent and top leaders of his party.
The explosion came less than
three weeks before the Nov. 9
election and just one day before
peace talks were to resume with
Tamil guerrillas to end an 11-year
ethnic war.
Details of the blast on the out
skirts of the capital were sketchy.
But Weerasooriya Wickrema, the
campaign manager of the United
National Party, said the explosion
came shortly before midnight as
its presidential candidate, Gamini
Dissanayake, was speaking at his
last rally of the day.

Dissanayake was an outspoken
critic of the peace talks that began
earlier this month with the Tamil
Tiger guerrillas, and the govern
ment had warned him three
weeks ago that the Tigers would
try to kill him.
"The bomb was apparently at
the front of the stage," Wickrema
said. "It was a very powerful
bomb."
About 50 bodies were brought
to General Hospital in Colombo, a
hospital official said.
Among the others killed in the
blast were the general secretary
of Dissanayake's United National
Party, two former cabinet minis
ters and a member of Parliament,
said the party's campaign manag
er, Wickrema Weerasooriya.

Thousands of people gathered
outside the hospital, about four
miles from the site of the rally,
waiting for information. Police
threw up a cordon to keep the
crowd under control.
Prime Minister Chandrika
Kumaratunga called an emer
gency cabinet meeting to discuss
whether to postpone the elec
tion, in which she was to stand
as a candidate for the ruling
alliance.
The United National Party lost
control of the government to Mrs.
Kumaratunga in a parliamentary
election last August after 17 years
in power.
Police said it was too early to
say who might have set the
blast, but the Tigers have a long

history of assassinations and
suicide bombs.
They were blamed for the
killing last year of President
Ranasinghe Premadasa and of
Indian Prime Minister Rajiv
Gandhi in May 1991. Dozens of
Sri Lankan politicians and mili
tary leaders have been killed by
bombs.
The Tigers have been fighting
since 1983 for an independent
homeland for the Tamil minority
in the north and east of Sri
Lanka, where they say they are
discriminated against by the Sin
halese majority. The Tamils com
prise about 18 percent of Sri
Lanka's 17 million people.
The war has killed more than
34,000 people.
