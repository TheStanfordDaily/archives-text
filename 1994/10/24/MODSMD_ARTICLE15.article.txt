# Israel expands man hunt
## Rabin's authorization adds more to most-wanted list 
### 
JERUSALEM (AP) - Israel is
approaching peace with an olive branch in
one hand and a gun in the other.
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin gave
security forces the green light to hunt
down and kill military leaders of the Mus
lim movement waging a war of terror
against Israelis, officials said yesterday.
But the policy, a response to public
anger at the bombing of a Tel Aviv bus, is
matched by official approval of a peace
treaty with Jordan and renewal of talks
with Palestinians on self-rule.
Even Rabin's main opposition, the con
servative Likud faction, said yesterday it
would support the Jordan-Israel pact. The
Israeli parliament is expected to ratify the
treaty Tuesday, and President Clinton will
join Israeli and Jordanian officials Wednes
day for the official signing.
Meanwhile, security officials reported to
the Cabinet yesterday that they had round
ed up dozens of activists from the funda
mentalist Muslim group Hamas since last
Wednesday's bus attack. Hamas took
responsibility for the bombing, which
claimed its 22nd victim on yesterday when
a 61-year-old woman died of her wounds.
Fearing reprisals for the bombing,

about 30 Hamas activists in the Palestini
an-ruled Gaza Strip and the Israeli-occu
pied West Bank are spending nights in hid
ing, a Palestinian source said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
Cabinet ministers spoke of new steps
against Hamas, although they would not
confirm Rabin's decision to order the
killing of Hamas military leaders, which
received banner newspaper headlines.
Economics Minister Shimon Shetreet
said security forces had identified "dozens"
of activists involved in the kidnap-murder
of an Israeli soldier by Hamas last week.
"We will find them and no one will go
unpunished," he told reporters.
Police sources told The Associated Press
yesterday that the solider, Sgt. Nachshon
Waxman, a dual American-Israeli citizen,
was severely beaten by his captors, appar
ently when first abducted, but not other
wise tortured before his death.
Housing Minister Benyamin Ben-Eliezer
said Israel was in "a long war" and had decid
ed on "special treatment in dealing with the
Hamas that in the end will stop them."
The military has long had a list of most
wanted activists it is authorized to kill on
sight, including 27 Hamas operatives.
