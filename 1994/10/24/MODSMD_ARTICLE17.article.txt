Used-book exchange on
SUNet could ease strain
on tight student budgets

IMAGINE IF THE University
ran a passenger railroad compa
ny. Tickets would cost a for
tune, but for various reasons
including prestige and quality of
service, everyone would want one.
Once on board, however, Stan
ford passengers would realize that
their ticket price did not cover
everything and that they had to buy
their own chairs to sit in. Vendors
would sell costly chairs designed
precisely for Stanford trains.
Of course, stubborn travelers
could stand or sneak their own
chairs aboard, but these methods
would prove tiresome and difficult.
Eventually, some resourceful pas
senger might resort to selling her
chair to a future passenger, but
Stanford wouldn't help. Instead,
the vendors might take advantage
of weary travelers by offering to
buy back their chairs at a mere
fraction of the original cost.
Well, Stanford may not be a rail
road, but Leland Stanford's rail
road-baron spirit lives on at the
Bookstore.
Professors tell students what
books to buy. These books are
ordered by the Bookstore and sold
at exorbitant prices. Given the
scarce alternatives, most students
end up giving in and paying those
prices for their textbooks.
At the end of each quarter, some
students put up fliers hoping to
resell their books, but for many, the
return does not warrant the effort.
So again they give in. They sell the
books back to the Bookstore for a
few pennies on the dollar, or they
go one step further and tell them
selves the biggest lie in all of
academia — "I'll save these books
because they'll be useful in later
life." Yeah, about as useful as an
old train seat.

But just as new transportation
broke the railroad barons' stran
glehold on America, technology
may bring a solution to the Farm.
Currently, some students use
the SUNet computer system to
post bulletins offering used books
for sale. But this process is ineffi
cient, because buyers have to
search through disorganized and
incomplete listings, and doing so
requires more than a little comput
er expertise.
But anyone who has used SUNet
to request ASSU fee refunds knows
how simple a preformatted user
program can be. A similar program
could be designed for student book
sales.
The program could function so
that a prospective book seller
would log in and enter the applica
ble course information, the book's
title and author and an offer price.
The seller's name and e-mail
address could automatically be
recorded in the database.
Buyers could log on to the sys
tem and pull up records satisfying
their needs. For example, if a first
year law student was taking a class
on contracts, she could enter the
course information and see what
contracts books second- and third
year law students were willing to
sell. She could then e-mail those
students and offer to buy their
books. Eventually, students could
save hundreds of dollars buying
and selling used course materials.
There are a number of organiza
tions on campus who might be able
to implement such a system. The
ASSU, which formerly ran a low
tech used-book exchange as a busi
ness project, would be an ideal can
didate to try this new high-tech,
nonprofit approach. The ASSU
could recruit student volunteers
willing to design the system as an
academic project or as a public ser
vice.
And for professors who may lose
royalties on book sales, taking the
train instead of flying is a great
way to save money, especially if you
do not have to pay for your chair.
