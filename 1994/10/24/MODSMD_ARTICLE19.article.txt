## Go west, young student

OVER THE PAST week or so, a
debate has been raging on the
pages of this paper regarding the
merits and myths of Stanford overseas
programs. Allow me to join the fray.
Some see the overseas experience as a
throwback to the good old high school
days, when it was okay to ogle the blonde
sitting in the front row, it was cool to
sneak a smoke in the courtyard and class
es were academically about as challenging
as Mu Fu Un Sun. Upon returning, these
global adventurers may well be caught
believing that Venice is a place where
bulging men in tights shave their pectoral
hair for the benefit of the less well
endowed, that Chile is best served with
chips and salsa, and that Spotted Dick is
best not served in good company at all.
Others stress the profound impact an
overseas program has had on their aca
demic, intellectual, sociological, philo
sophical, physiological and psychothera
peutic well-being. Their brief but stimu
lating stay overseas has made them
instantaneous connoisseurs of the lan
guage, history and culture of the region
they visited. After three months in, say,
Santiago, the eager globetrotters will
comprehend all the problems facing
developing nations, as well as the long
term implications of American efforts to
curb the import of bighorn sheep.
Such are the voyages of the enterpris
ing Stanford student.
Last month, 34 other students and I

returned home from almost half a year in
Japan. We had spent the spring at the
Stanford Center for Technology and
Innovation in Kyoto, followed by a 10-
week stint interning at companies in the
area or in Tokyo. We came back from
Japan excited and enthusiastic and saw
our suspicions confirmed that spending
time overseas would be one of the best
aspects of our Stanford career.
It is not surprising that one of the pri
mary goals and results of study abroad is
to deepen understanding of a foreign cul
ture. What was more surprising to me
was what happened when I got back from
overseas: not only did I understand
Japan a bit better, but I also perceived
American culture in a new way. It is often
said that America has no culture. . . well,
this is clearly a statement made by repre
sentatives of an elitist perspective stran
gled by an overly narrow comprehension
of culture and life in general. American
culture is unique. Most cultures are root
ed in a particular ethnicity and language,
a common historical background and
shared traditions and rituals. While
America has traditionally been strongly
influenced by a particular brand of a spe
cific culture, this influence is far more
tenuous than in non-immigrant coun
tries and is crumbling as we speak. In
many ways, America is the exception to
the rule. Studying overseas provides the
opportunity to explore the rule in order
to understand the exception better.

It surprises me that students some
times need coaxing to go abroad. The
thought of spending a quarter or a year in
a new and intriguing environment,
exposed to an entirely different set of
opportunities and experiences than is
possible at the home campus, would seem
to me reason enough to make a grown
man cry with joy. Instead, many students
feel that any quarter not spent at Stan
ford in California is a lost quarter, that
the opportunities offered here are too
great to trade them for those that some
oddball foreign country has to offer.
C'mon, people. I'm the first to admit
that Stanford has more to offer at any
given point in time than one can possibly
handle in 24 hours a day. But when again
will you have the opportunity to spend
exciting, productive time in a foreign
country, learn about another culture and
language and learn more about yourself
and your own culture, in an environment
where your housing, transportation,
visas and summer job are taken care of,
all the while receiving Stanford credit
and sharing the whole experience with a
bunch of enthusiastic, energetic fellow
Stanford students?
Go overseas. Now.
And no, I'm not getting paid by Over
