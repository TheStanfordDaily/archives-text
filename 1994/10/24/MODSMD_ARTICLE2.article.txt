## ASSU fee rate down to 25% 
### Hussein Kanji 
After last year's dramatic increase in ASSU spe
cial-fee refunds, the refund number dropped back
to normal this quarter, a decrease of almost 25 per
cent, ASSU Financial Manager Gabe Lucas an
nounced yesterday.
Special-fee funded groups — who lost nearly
$165,000 to refunds and were tightly pinched for
cash last fall quarter — are safe once again, Lucas
said.
This year's rate marks a notable change from
last October, when graduate students banded to
gether and by themselves managed to refund 26.5
percent of the total amount requested — more than
the total amount refunded this year.
