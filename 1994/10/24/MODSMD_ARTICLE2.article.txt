# No tea party...
## ASSU fee rate down to 25% 
### Hussein Kanji 
After last year's dramatic increase in ASSU spe
cial-fee refunds, the refund number dropped back
to normal this quarter, a decrease of almost 25 per
cent, ASSU Financial Manager Gabe Lucas an
nounced yesterday.
Special-fee funded groups — who lost nearly
$165,000 to refunds and were tightly pinched for
cash last fall quarter — are safe once again, Lucas
said.
This year's rate marks a notable change from
last October, when graduate students banded to
gether and by themselves managed to refund 26.5
percent of the total amount requested — more than
the total amount refunded this year.

According to Lucas, statistics
showing the difference in the
amount refunded this quarter by
graduate and undergraduate stu
dents are not yet available.
Among the reasons behind the
decrease was the noticeable
absence of the Graduate Student
Tea Party, which coordinated
efforts to heighten refund aware
ness last year and ultimately
raised the refund rate.
Members of the Tea Party —
upset over a perceived lack of
representation in the ASSU —
sent electronic mail last year to
nearly every graduate student
with information about the
refund process.
Karen Seta, a graduate stu
dent who headed the Tea Party,
is now working on a task force to
change the system by means of
an amendment to the ASSU
Constitution.
The group has scheduled two
meetings this week to garner stu
dent input on how the refund sys
tem should be reformed, she said.
Another factor in the decline
in refunds was last spring's gen
eral election in which nearly half
of the groups requesting funds
were denied, Lucas said. "Some
people thought that the election
meant something," he said.
In response to the election
some of the large organizations
who used to rely on special-fee
funds turned to other means to
raise revenue, Lucas said.
The groups, who purposely
overestimate the amount of
money they need — this year by
30 percent — will feel little effect
from the special-fee refunds this
quarter due to the relatively low
refund rate, he added.
In contrast, the groups inflat
ed their budgets only 25 percent
last year, meaning that the hitrh

er refund rate took a significant
chunk of their funding.
The three general fees — Pro
gram Board, Publications Board
and Community Service Board,
were hit hardest by fee refunds
this year.
Pub Board, which had the
highest refund rate of all the fees
this quarter, lost 37 percent of
its funding — a total of $18,600.
This decline in funding is
exacerbated by the fact that
many groups which lost their
special fees last spring have been
forced to turn to these boards for
aid, Lucas said.

was last spring s
general election in

ing funds were
denied. Some people

As a result, according to the
boards' recent recommendation
to the senate, many of these
groups are likely to receive less
than 50 percent of what they
requested from the Program
Board before the special-fee
refunds, and their financial situ
ation remains unclear.
Lucas said the boards will
probably stick with the numbers
they have already calculated for
this quarter and "borrow off of
winter and spring" to make up
the remainder.
