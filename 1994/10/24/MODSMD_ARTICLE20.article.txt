EVproblems neither few nor far between, residents say

Children, families live
in EV; University must
make sure they're safe

apartment has peeling paint, you
should call a certain number. I dialed
that number ten times throughout the
day, without any response. I finally
tried another number and got a person
who said they would pass the word
along. Well, days have passed and no
one has come to inspect the peeling
paint as the flier indicated they would. I
consider this a serious health hazard
for my children, especially the 10-
month-old who spends most of his time
crawling around putting foreign objects
in his mouth.
Another example: the other day I
asked a 10-year-old boy to shut the gate
he had come through so that the smaller
children couldn't get out. It would not

even be necessary to ask if the "self
latching gates" that were installed had
been maintained so that they function
properly.
In both examples, it appears to me
that the graduate housing office has
very good intentions. They want to know
about the lead; they did install the self
latching gates. However, they can't stop
there. They can't just send around a flier
and then never answer the phone, never
come to check. They will have lawsuits.
And what is the good of spending
resources on self-latching gates that
don't work?
Finally, like many others in Escondi
do, my apartment was not clean when I
moved in. Food on the walls, dirty carpet

(at least I got carpet), filthy drapes that
fall of the wall every time I try to open
them etc.
I love living in Escondido, and it is a
wonderful place for families with chil
dren, but children of all Stanford resi
dents are at the greatest risk from an
unclean, unsafe living environment. I
hope that the efforts of Amber McLain
and other concerned Escondido residents
will come to the attention of Vice
Provost and Dean for Student Affairs
Mary Edmonds and other graduate
housing employees who want to ensure
that families and children at Stanford
have a safe place to live.

I live in Escondido Village. Contrary to
the opinion of many who work for the
graduate housing office, I do not believe
that they are doing a good or even
acceptable job of ensuring a clean, safe
living environment for the families who
live in graduate housing.
For example, on Monday, Oct. 17,1
received a flier indicating that there is a
potential for lead poisoning for those
living in Escondido and that if your
EVproblems neither few nor far between, residents say
