# Maintenance workers do well; management to blame for problems
## 
### 
I am writing for two purposes. First,
in the Oct. 13 story concerning a meet
ing of the Escondido Village Family
Council, cleaning and maintenance prob
lems were attributed to "'incompetent'
Stanford maintenance workers." My
own experiences with Escondido mainte
nance workers have been very positive in
the mcyority of cases. My campaign of
recent weeks has addressed Escondido's
dysfunctional system of cleaning and
inspecting apartments prior to assigning
them to new residents. In my opinion,
housing management, not the mainte
nance workers, are responsible for the
current cleaning and maintenance prob
lems in Escondido.
Second, I would like to respond to the
Oct. 20 letter to the editor by Keith Guy,
director of Housing and Dining Services.
I would like to say that I stand behind

all recent Daily articles regarding move
in conditions and the upkeep of Escondi
do Village.
Guy may feel that the "small num
ber" of move-in problems reported in the
Daily misrepresent the general condition
of Escondido units. I contend that a
majority of Escondido apartments are
not clean upon receiving new tenants.
This is for two reasons. First, many
apartments are not visited by cleaning
crews between tenants. Second, much of
the work done by the contracted clean
ing crews is shoddy and is never inspect
ed by Stanford representatives. They
don't do a good job because it isn't
required of them.
While Guy believes that Housing and
Dining Services has been successful in
providing properly cleaned apartments
for new tenants and denies the existence
of any serious problems in Escondido
Village, my own experience and five
years of experience with friends and
neighbors tells me that his beliefs are
wrong.
