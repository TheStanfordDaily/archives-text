# Apartment was filthy, in embarrassing shape when couple moved in

I am writing in response to Housing
and Dining Services Director Keith
Guy's Oct. 20 letter stating that only a
small proportion of Escondido Village
houses are not appropriately clean when
people move in. I have talked to a lot of
people since we moved in, and it sounds
like a lot more serious a problem than is
suggested in that letter. Let me tell you
our experience. My husband and I
moved into Escondido in March 1991;
we were assigned to a high-rise apart
ment which was in very good condition.
Last December, we moved into a low
rise house. My husband got the key to
the apartment in the morning and on
his way home he stopped at the house to
check it out. The cleaning crew was still
working. We came back with the first
load of things in the afternoon and we
were astonished to see the condition of
our just-cleaned house. The walls were

really dirty and damaged; the old fridge
had fruit juice spilled on the inside and I
don't dare describe the condition of the
stove. The floors were dirty and the
cleaning crew had waxed over the dirt,
which made the problem even worse.
At the time, I was eight months preg
nant and had family visiting us for the
Christmas season, so it was really hard
(even embarrassing).
As I said at the beginning of this let
ter, ours is not an unusual experience,
and it seems to be the rule and not the
exception. To be fair, though, we did get
a new fridge and curtains when we com
plained about them.
Thank you for listening to our experi
ence.
