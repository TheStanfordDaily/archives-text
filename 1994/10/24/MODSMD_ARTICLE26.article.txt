## Small fire on third floor Zapata interrupts party 
### Crystal Carreon Rachel Kolman Marshak 
As Friday night's Casa Zapata
party jammed into the wee hours
of the morning, a small fire broke
out at approximately 1:20 a.m.
on the third floor of the Mexican-
American theme house.
The electrical fire, which was
started by a faulty hot pot acci
dentally left on, burned a six-inch
wide hole into the shag carpeting
of room 44, according to Palo Alto
Fire Capt. Dale Hopkins.
Freshmen Margot Quandt
and Sarah Ray.i, the owner of the
hot pot, live in the room.
Palo Alto firefighter Henry
Florez put out the fire in about
15 minutes.
"I put on my breathing appa
ratus, ran through the smoke
and searched for the source. It
was a hot pot still plugged in,
with no water in it," Florez said.
"Had it not been contained, it

could have been a lot worse."
There was no danger that the
fire could have spread from the
room, however, since the floor
and walls of the room are made
of cement, Hopkins said.
"It burned the carpet, but it
wasn't going anywhere," he said.
Zapata residents were con
fused by their evacuation to the
designated emergency spot in the
parking lot.
"At first, no one was going
outside, because we all thought it
[the fire alarml was pulled by
some drunk guys at the party.
Then we started to smell the
smoke," said sophomore Nerina
Garcia, who lives on the first
floor of Zapata.
In any case, Capt. Bruce Hall
berg of the Palo Alto Fire Dept.
recommends that "everyone
should always vacate the build
ing when the alarms start" since
there could be a real fire.
Potentially, there could be

critical danger from hot pots and
related cooking appliances in
dorm rooms, he said.
In addition to the hazards of
hot pots, Hallberg pointed to an
incident where a toaster
scorchod a student's mattress as
an example of the fire hazards
posed by cooking devices.
"(Studentsl shouldn't have
cooking-type material in their
rooms," Hopkins said.
Stern Hall is particularly at
risk since the rooms don't con
tain individual sprinkler sys
tems, which are scheduled to be
added in next year when the
dorm is remodeled, Hallberg
said. Sprinkler systems would
diminish the danger caused by
this sort of fire, he added.
After the incident, those in the
theme house were able to laugh
â€” even Razi, whose hot pot is
now a part of Zapata history.
"I'm moving on with my life,"
she said.
