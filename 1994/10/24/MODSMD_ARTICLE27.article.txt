# Hearts brimming, patients celebrate life on 10th anniversary of transplants

Clad in the de riguer baggy
jeans, skate shirt and oversized
baseball cap, 12-year old Eliza
beth Craze appears to be your
typical junior high student.
Typical, that is, until you ask
about her daily medical regimen.
"Cyclosporine, Prednesone, and
sometimes a little something for
my blood pressure," she
responds cheerfully.
Appearances non-withstand
ing, Elizabeth became a medical
milestone 10 years ago at age
two when she underwent
surgery at Stanford to replace a
congenitally diseased heart.
Yesterday afternoon, Eliza
beth and 19-year-old Lisa Wit
tnebel commemorated their 10th
anniversary of life with their
donated hearts at the Lucile
Salter Packard Children's Hospi
tal. Eighty-five family members,
friends and medical community
representatives joined the two
for the celebration.
Elizabeth and Lisa, who
received their new hearts within
months of each other at Stan
ford Hospital in 1984, are the
first long-term survivors of pedi
atric heart transplants.
Heart transplants involve
enormous risks for any patient,
and are especially precarious for
children under 15. "It's extraor
dinarily difficult to find compati
ble donors for adults, and even
more so for the kids", said Shel
ley Hunter, transplant coordina
tor for the California Transplant
Donor Network. "We need to
find hearts that not only match
their blood type, but will fit their

smaller chest cavities as well".
The surgery involves far more
risk for younger patients as well.
Because the transplant occurs
on such a small scale, the work
involved is far more intricate,
said Dr. Bruce Reitz, head of
pediatric cardio-thoracic surgery
at the Children's Hospital.
"Lisa and Elizabeth represent
seminal innovations for medical
technology," he said.
The celebration showcased
the spectrum of the heart trans
plant community, ranging from
the physicians and social work
ers affiliated with the hospital to
organ recipients and their
extended families.
Both the children's mothers
and their physicians spoke infor
mally about their experiences
with the transplant surgery to
the assembled crowd, which
included other young recipients
of donated hearts.
Although Lisa and Elizabeth
were feted as the guests of
honor in the short presentation,
the remainder of the afternoon
was an opportunity for families
and their children to meet each
other. A collage-making table,
was available for the children to
create their own representa
tions of their transplant experi
ence.
Although transplant surgery
is now vastly less experimental
than it was a decade ago, each
young recipient represents new
headway for medical technology.
"We recently performed a suc
cessful operation on an 18-day -
old infant," Reitz said. "Each
child represents a new corner
stone for us."
