## Cardinal dams Beavers, 35-29 
### Greg Collins Senior staff writer 
Cardinal 35
Oregon State 29

For a short time Saturday
afternoon, it appeared that the
nightmare had returned.
Still smarting from a last-sec
ond loss to Arizona State two
weeks ago, Stanford saw an all
too-familiar scene unfolding in
the fourth quarter against Ore
gon State. Trailing 35-29 with
four minutes, 37 seconds left, the
Beavers took the ball over at their
own 16-yard line. Twelve plays
later, they were poised at the
Stanford 32, facing a fourth-and
five with a minute-and-a-half left
in the game.
Oregon State quarterback Don
Shanklin rolled out and had a
choice to run or pass, but Stan
ford defenders David Carder and
Brian Werner descended on the
hapless Beaver, smothering him
for no gain and securing the Car
dinal's 35-29 win.
"We're just so ecstatic to win a
football game," said head coach
Bill Walsh. "It was a tough propo
sition [at the end] because we just
couldn't stop them. We were able
to get some big plays. We had to
put everything together just right
to get our drives going."
And to keep the drives going,
as it turned out. For the first time
this season, Stanford (2-4-1, 1-3
in Pacific 10 Conference) did not
turn the ball over. This near-per
fect offensive execution, especial
ly in the first half, was helped
greatly by Oregon State's inabili
ty to hold on to the football. Los
ing three of five fumbles and
throwing a key interception late
in the game, the Beavers (2-5, 1-
4) didn't sustain enough drives to
overpower Stanford's air attack.
"It takes a fumble or some mis
cues to beat Oregon State," Walsh
said. "We got our share,imit if you
don't get those, you wiTf have a
hard time outscoring them."
Finding key receivers under
single coverage often during the
day, senior quarterback Steve
Stenstrom victimized the Oregon
State secondary with several long
passes and three touchdowns. His
19-for-32, 308-yard performance

broke four more school records.
Stenstrom now holds the record
for most career attempts, comple
tions and total offense, all previ
ously held by John Elway.
However, the record Sten
strom was most pleased about
setting was career wins, at 23.
Deadlocked with Heisman Tro
phy winner Jim Plunkett at 22
for the past four weeks, Sten
strom is now the winningest
quarterback in school history.
"That's very satisfying," Sten
strom said. "Actually, that was
one of the first things I thought
about after the game. It was so
nice to get a win."

'We're just so
ecstatic to win a
football game.'

Judging by the first quarter, it
hardly looked as if the Beavers
had come to play. Fumbling an
option pitch on the sixth play of
the game, Oregon State fell into a
quick 7-0 hole as the Cardinal
found the endzone three plays
later.
Facing third-and-six at the
Beaver 46, Stenstrom found
senior wide receiver Justin
Armour wide open at the 15 and
he bolted into the endzone for the
score. Stenstrom bounced off at
least two Oregon State defenders
before scrambling out of the pock
et and launching the touchdown
pass.
"We knew that their defense
was based on getting pressure on
the quarterback," Stenstrom
said. "They come with a lot of
guys, and receivers tend to be
open downfield. It's a matter of
having the time and being able to
find the right guy that's open."
On the Cardinal's next posses
sion, Stenstrom again found
Armour for a touchdown. Angling
toward the left corner of the end
zone, Armour got behind the cov
erage and scored on a 25-yard
pass.
After outgaining the Beavers
181-40 in the first quarter, Stan
ford tallied its third score of the
day just 19 seconds into the sec
ond quarter. Stenstrom targeted
sophomore flanker Brian Man
ning between two defenders and
rifled a 17-yard touchdown pass,
giving the Cardinal a 21-0 lead.

"Both receivers [Manning and
Armour] really had great days,"
Stenstrom said. "That's what we
needed when you play a team that
blitzes a lot. and leaves their cor
nerbacks in man-to-man cover
age. Our guys really took it to
their cornerbacks."
On the day, Armour caught
seven passes for 139 yards and
Manning grabbed five balls for 97
yards. Armour continued his
modest climb up the Stanford
record books, as he moved into a
three-way tie for second in career
touchdown receptions (18) and
jumped into the top 10 for career
receptions (127). Also, he is only
396 yards away from being the
Cardinal's all-time yards receiv
ing leader.
Despite Stanford's quick start,
the Beavers jumped right back
into the game with two long
drives utilizing their wishbone
running game. An 11-play, 63-
yard drive was capped by a J.J.
Young two-yard option run.
Young had 136 yards on 20 carri
ers, many of them option pitches
or counters.
Oregon State scored on their
next drive as well, a 15-play, 90-
yard march highlighted by a sur
prise 24-yard pass by Shanklin
which took them down to the one
yard line. Shanklin then took it in
for a touchdown on a quarterback
sneak, making the halftime score
21-14.
Oregon State struck again on
their first possession of the sec
ond half, a 67-yard drive consist
ing of 10 straight runs and capped
with a 4-yard Young touchdown
scamper. Suddenly it was tied at
21 and the Beaver option was
rolling.
However, a new Stanford play
er made a permanent mark for
the Cardinal. Freshman Anthony
Bookman, subbing for the injured
Mike Mitchell, put together a
tough, gritty performance in
grinding out 93 yards on 22 car
ries.
Informed by his mother that
his great-grandmother was hospi
talized Friday night and finding
out that sophomore cornerback
Eliel Swinton's girlfriend had
died in a car accident late Thurs
day night, Bookman put aside all
his distractions and gave Stan
ford the ground game it desper
ately needed. The team chalked
up 152 yards for the game and

Victory.

kept time of possession (a key
statistic against Oregon State
according to Walsh) to only a
slight 1:40 advantage for the
Beavers.
Bookman scored his first of
two touchdowns on an acrobatic
23-yard run in which he hurdled
an Oregon State tackier at the 15
and sprinted into the endzone
ahead of several Beaver pursuers.
His second touchdown came on
Stanford's next drive. Showing
his explosive athletic ability,
Bookman went air-born from two

yards out to give the Cardinal a
35-21 lead.
After giving up an Oregon
State score and two-point conver
sion with 6:50 left in the game,
the defense dug itself in for anoth
er wild finish. Going into that
final drive, everyone on the team
had visions of the stinging loss to
the Sun Devils just two weeks ago.
"On that fourth down situa
tion, we said 'Don't let it be
another ASU,"' senior nose tackle
Jason Fisk said.
Despite running up 372 yards
rushing for the game, it was the
lack of passing ability for the
Beavers which led to the hurried
fourth down play. Looking des
perately for an open receiver,

Shanklin was unable to get a firm
footing in deciding to run or pass.
For the game, the Beavers threw
13 passes and completed five, a
surprisingly high number f<ii*
Oregon State's wishbone.
"The defense coming up with
that stop on fourth down was just
huge," Armour said. "This is
what we needed, we just needed a
win. Everybody was so hungry for
it."
While giving up 372 yards on the
ground may sound like the defense
didn't do its job, the Cardinal was
very successful in taking away one
of Oregon State's best weapons.
"We were going heavy on the
quarterback," Fisk said. "Last
week the quarterback played real
ly well 1159 yards against UCIAJ,
and we wanted to shut that down.
That was our goal and we were
pretty effective."
The defense also did its job in
covering up loose balls. Whereas
previously in the season it seemed
as if every ball bounced away
from Stanford, on Saturday the
Cardinal was constantly in the
right place at the right time.
"If you watch any football
game, sometimes it's one team
dominating the other," Fisk
said. "Most times, it's just those
little bonuses you get here and
there. They really haven't been
there for us this year, and this
game they were. It was the dif
ference."
With the win, words like "relief'
and "satisfaction" are replacing
"frustrating" and "snakebit" in the
Cardinal vocabulary. While a bowl
game still remains a distant possi
bility, a humiliating 61-0 Califor
nia loss to USC makes Big Game
look like less of a potential disaster
for Stanford and Oregon's win over
Washington makes the Huskies
look a little less invincible.
"I never thought I'd be so
happy for beating Oregon State,
because they've never been a
great team," Fisk said. "It's real
ly nice to finally get a win, to pick
up the spirits that have been
down."
Freshman linebacker Jon
Haskins put it a little simpler.
"Shoot, I forgot what this felt
like!" he said.
