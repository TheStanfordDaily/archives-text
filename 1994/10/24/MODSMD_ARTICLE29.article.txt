The No. 1 Stanford women's
volleyball is still motoring
down the road like a fine-tuned
engine to what it hopes will be a
Pacific 10 Conference and
National championship season.
One by-product of this on-going
march has been a steady
stream of victories.
This Cardinal machine

showed that it has no intention
of slowing down as it churned
out two more of those wins this
past weekend on its way to cap
turing the Wells Fargo/Stan
ford Invitational. Stanford
swept Villanova (15-6, 15-13,
15-6) in the semifinals on Fri
day evening, then defeated No.
17 New Mexico in four games
(11-15, 15-7, 15-8,15-7) thefol

lowing night to win the annual
tourney.
The unranked Wildcats (18-9)
came out strong against the num
ber one team in the nation, taking
a 5-0 lead in game one. The Cardi
nal managed to pull that one out,
but fell behind 12-4 in the second
contest. At that point junior Cary
Wendell took control. She and
freshman Kristen Folkl rallied
the Cardinal forces to nine
straight points and Stanford took
the lead and the game. The third
game proved less of a challenge
for the Cardinal as it ran its
record to a perfect 17-0.
"I think Villanova played really
well," Folkl said. "We couldn't get
it all together in the first two
games, but by the end of the
match I think it was going pretty
well."
The Cardinal outhit a strong
offensive Villanova squad .350 to
.239. All 15 members of head coach
Don Shaw's team saw considerable
action. Folkl, despite only playing
in two of the games, led the way
with 13 kills and a .591 hitting per
centage. Wendell (8 kills, .313) and
junior outside hitter Marnie
Triefenbach (8, .750) also proved
key elements to the win. Talented
freshman Stacy Evans starred for
vanquished Villanova with 14 kills
and a .370 average.
The victory gave the Cardinal
passage to Saturday night's final
against the Lobos. New Mexico
(13-5), which could be known as
the University of Australia at
Albuquerque because it starts
three players from Down Under,
had upset seventh-ranked Santa
Barbara on Friday. Major contri
butions from seniors Mindy Hale,
Tania Gooley and Robyn Went
worth made the Lobos extremely
tough against the Gauchos.
After Santa Barbara (18-8)
defeated Villanova in the consola
tion match, the Lobos exhibited
more of the same spirited play
early on in the championship
bout. New Mexico jumped out to a
5-1 lead, getting its fifth score
when Hale hammered the ball
through a pair of Stanford block
ers after a long rally.
Shaw called a timeout and a
refocused Cardinal went back to
the court to tie the score at six
after a pair of Triefenbach kills.
The Lobos were not done yet,
though. They capitalized on Stan

ford serve receptions and hitting
errors to run off six straight
points. Shaw once again called his
team to the sidelines and the Car
dinal embarked upon the road to
recovery. But it would not be
enough as New Mexico secured a
game point on a Wentworth kill.
"They (New Mexico) played
really well that first game," said
Shaw. "And we weren't playing so
well. We needed to find some way
to get it rolling."
This marked only the fourth
time all year that Stanford had
dropped a game. It was also the
first time this season that the
Cardinal fell behind an opponent
in games.
"You don't worry about that,"

You pretty much have
to take it one game
at a time and that's
what we did. We
know we had made
some mistakes, but
we had the
opportunity to
make it up.
— Kristen Folkl

Shaw said. "You just try to go out
and win the match."
Wendell voiced the same senti
ments.
"Once that game was over, it
was over," she said. "We learned a
lot tactically about what we had to
do and moved on to the next
game."
"You pretty much have to take
it one game at a time and that's
what we did," agreed Folk!. "We
know we had made some mis
takes, but we had the opportunity
to make it up."
Game two started slowly as
each side stumbled a bit, but at 2-
2 the Cardinal upsurped the
momentum and did not relin
quish it. At 5-2, freshman Lisa
Sharpley set Wendell and a
stunned Lobo team that had been
expecting an attack from a differ
ent area could not deal with the
threat. Stanford had found a way
to get things rolling.
"We served a lot tougher in the
second game," Shaw said. "And
Eileen (Murfee) really got it
going. When she came into the

game, she gave us a tough middle
attack and that opened up the
outside. She did a great job."
New Mexico managed to deny
the Cardinal game point five
times with some inspired play
from Wentworth and Gooley, but
the effort wasn't enough as Mur
fee and company evened up the
match at one game apiece.
"It had a lot to do with the pass
ing," Folkl said. "When you pass
well, it makes it easier for the set
ters to put the ball in a good spot."
The Stanford offense came out
with all pistons firing in the third
game. The Lobos were overpow
ered by cannon blasts from
Triefenbach, Murfee, Wendell and
Folkl as the Cardinal moved out a
9-1 advantage. New Mexico did
recover in time to cut the lead to
10-6, before Stanford pulled ahead
again. The Lobos were tamed
when senior Anne Wicks and Wen
dell teamed up on a block.
Down two games to one, New
Mexico lost some of its feistiness.
After the first few serves of game
three, the Lobos came no closer
than three points to the Stanford
squad as the Cardinal cruised to
the victory in the shortest game of
the evening. The win handed
Stanford the Invitational title, the
fifth time in seven tournaments
that the Cardinal has championed
the tournament.
Stanford outhit New Mexico
.318 to .189 and registered 8 more
team blocks than the Lobos. Wen
dell hit .625 with 16 kills and 17
digs, Triefenbach hit .344 with 17
kills and 15 digs and Murfee, who
provided a huge boost, hit .571 with
9 kills. In addition, Sharpley hau a
team-high 33 assists and Wicks had
a match-high 9 block assists. The
Lobos had 4 players (Hale, Gooley,
Wentworth and senior Sally
Downs) reach double digits in kills
while junior setter Alicia Bergmann
registered 48 assists.
Wendell, in honor of her out
standing performances, was
named the tournament's Most
Valuable Player. The all-tourna
ment team consisted of Santa
Barbara's Jennifer Stroffe, New
Mexico's Bergmann, Gooley and
Hale and Stanford's own Triefen
bach and Folkl.
Wendell praised her team
mates for their contributions.
"They (New Mexico) weren't
really focusing one me," she said.
"I had a good match, but it was
due in large part to Lisa's setting
and the fact that I'm surrounded
by good hitters who force teams to
focus on them."
