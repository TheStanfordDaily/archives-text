A car crash in Hayward, Calif, late Thursday
evening claimed the life of one Stanford student and
injured seven others.
Sophomore Jessica Williams died when the 1987
GMC van in which she was riding crashed into a
guard rail and overturned near the intersection of
Highways 880 and 92 by the San Mateo bridge. She
was thrown out of the vehicle and landed some dis
tance from it.
Junior Tamecca Nichole Hicks was also thrown
from the van. She was taken to Eden Medical Center
in Castro Valley, where she underwent emergency
surgery.
Hicks was previously listed in critical condition
with a head injury and fractured arm, but as of last
night her condition had improved.
She is presently in "fair condition" with stable
vital statistics, said Kathy Delaney, the hospital's
public relations director.
Sophomores Selena Saunders, Sharifah Abdul
lah, Ijeoma Ude, freshmen Saidah Grayson and
Chrichelle McCloud, and Kristin Dockery — an ex

were also treated for minor injuries and released
from two Bay Area hospitals.
The students were headed to a "get-together" at a
friend's house in Richmond, said sophomore Teresa
Matt, Williams' roommate in Mirrielees.
At 10:13 p.m., the students' van was cut off by an
other car, said Jim Carter, the officer from the Cali
fornia Highway Patrol who is investigating the acci

Saunders, the driver of the van, swerved to avoid
hitting the car, but she lost control and the van
crashed into the center guard rail, causing the vehi
cle to overturn.
The police have identified a possible suspect,
Carter said. Two eye witnesses say they can posi
tively identify the suspect in a photo lineup, he
said.
Although Carter said he hopes to have the lineup
this Wednesday or Thursday, he said the department
won't be finished with its investigation for several
weeks.
If convicted, the suspect could face at the least a
felony hit and run charge, or at the most assault with
a deadly weapon or vehicular manslaughter, Carter
said.
"It's still all under investigation so nothing is set
in stone yet," Carter said.
