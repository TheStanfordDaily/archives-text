A car crash in Hayward, Calif, late Thursday
evening claimed the life of one Stanford student and
injured seven others.
Sophomore Jessica Williams died when the 1987
GMC van in which she was riding crashed into a
guard rail and overturned near the intersection of
Highways 880 and 92 by the San Mateo bridge. She
was thrown out of the vehicle and landed some dis
tance from it.
Junior Tamecca Nichole Hicks was also thrown
from the van. She was taken to Eden Medical Center
in Castro Valley, where she underwent emergency
surgery.
Hicks was previously listed in critical condition
with a head injury and fractured arm, but as of last
night her condition had improved.
She is presently in "fair condition" with stable
vital statistics, said Kathy Delaney, the hospital's
public relations director.
Sophomores Selena Saunders, Sharifah Abdul
lah, Ijeoma Ude, freshmen Saidah Grayson and
Chrichelle McCloud, and Kristin Dockery — an ex
change student from Spelman College in Atlanta —
were also treated for minor injuries and released
from two Bay Area hospitals.
The students were headed to a "get-together" at a
friend's house in Richmond, said sophomore Teresa
Matt, Williams' roommate in Mirrielees.
At 10:13 p.m., the students' van was cut off by an
other car, said Jim Carter, the officer from the Cali
fornia Highway Patrol who is investigating the acci
dent.
Saunders, the driver of the van, swerved to avoid
hitting the car, but she lost control and the van
crashed into the center guard rail, causing the vehi
cle to overturn.
The police have identified a possible suspect,
Carter said. Two eye witnesses say they can posi
tively identify the suspect in a photo lineup, he
said.
Although Carter said he hopes to have the lineup
this Wednesday or Thursday, he said the department
won't be finished with its investigation for several
weeks.
If convicted, the suspect could face at the least a
felony hit and run charge, or at the most assault with
a deadly weapon or vehicular manslaughter, Carter
said.
"It's still all under investigation so nothing is set
in stone yet," Carter said.
Drugs and alcohol *»ere not involved in the inci
dent, Carter said. Saunders and Abdullah — who
was in the right front passenger
seat — were the only people wear
ing seat belts at the time of the
crash, Carter said.
In response to the accident,
University administrators orga
nized several programs this week
end to address student concerns.
A program was held at Tresid
der Union Friday night to inform
students about University ser
vices available for grief counsel
ing.
Dean of Students Michael
Jackson said that staff from Cow
ell Student Health Center's
Counseling and Psychological
Services is available 24-hours a
day to help students, as are resi
dent fellows, resident assistants
and Memorial Church officials.
A memorial program for
Williams was held Saturday night
in Memorial Church.
Assoc. Dean of Memorial

Church Floyd Thompkins con
ducted the service and several of
Williams' friends spoke, read
poetry and performed musical
selections.
"I for one did not come here
tonight to say good-bye to Jessica.
I don't believe she's gone," said
Nelda Brown, a Stanford alum
and a friend of Williams' older
sister, Jennifer.
"I know she's still here. Her
spirit and her memory will live
on," Brown said. "You don't have
to know her very well to realize
how many lives she touched. You
can just look around here tonight
and know that she is loved and
respected."
Brown first met Jessica
Williams during her freshman
year when she lived with Jennifer
Williams in Wilbur Hall.
"Jennifer always used to talk
about her little sister, Jessica,"
Brown said. "When Jessica came
to Stanford as a member of the
Class of 1997, she was no longer
the girl her sister called 'Q-tip'
because she had a big head and

this little body, but was instead a
bright, beautiful woman."
"There is time for everything,
and a season for every activity
under Heaven — a time to be
born and a time to die," said
junior Andrea Watson, reading a
Biblical passage.
Many will search for a reason
for Jessica Williams' death and
will look for someplace to stick
the blame, Thompkins said.
But the reason is that some
times a person's time is up,
Thompkins said. "I was talking to
Jessica's mom and she said it
wasn't anyone's fault," he said,
"It was just Jessica's time."
Also on Saturday night, the
Theta Delta Chi fraternity can
celed a previously scheduled
party in recognition of Williams'
death.
Williams boyfriend, sopho
more Eliel Swinton, is a Theta
Delt and also a member of the
Stanford Football Team.
An altar honoring Williams
has been established at El Centro
Chicano.
