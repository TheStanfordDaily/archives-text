Smurfs must thrive in moun
tain air.
Junior midfielder Carmel Mur
phy, affectionately dubbed
"Sjnurf" by her teammates on the
No. 3 Stanford women's soccer
squad, broke out of an offensive
slump with two back-to-back
goals to carry the Cardinal (12-1)
to the championship of the Col
orado College Tournament. Stan

ford opened the weekend with a 3-
1 win over the host Tigers and
captured the title yesterday in a 4-
2 triumph against Nebraska.
Murphy, who had missed two
games in September for the first
time in her career with a broken
nose, had only posted two goals on
the season before Friday. With
her four goals in the tournament,
she moved past senior forward
Andrea Johnson for second place
on the career scoring list for the
current squad.
Murphy was not the only Car
dinal player who stepped up in
Boulder. Junior midfielder Dena
Dey, still trying to regain the form
she possessed en route to 11 goals
in 1992, also posted a goal and an
assist on the weekend. Freshman
midfielder Elie Foster and junior
forward Julie Bushman, who led

UC-Santa Barbara in assists in
each of her two years there,
notched their first points in Car
dinal uniforms.
In only her second start of the
season, Bushman made her pres
ence felt almost immediately in
Friday's match-up with Colorado.
Her pass to Murphy, who was cen
tered in front of the net, led to a
Stanford goal only four minutes
into the contest.
The score would remain that
way until just after intermission,
when the Tigers' Martina Holan
scored an unassisted goal from
close range. The freshman's first
career goal tied the game for six
minutes, until Murphy scored
from nearly the same spot on the
other side of the field. Murphy's
only two shots of the afternoon
were enough to drop the Tigers to
3-7-3, but Dey provided an insur
ance goal at 86 minutes, 55 sec
onds on Foster's assist.
Stanford similarly controlled

yesterday's match shrugging off
Nebraska proved a much more
difficult task than the Cardinal
expected. The Cornhuskers
entered the game with an 11-2
mark in their inaugural season
but Stanford out-shot the new
comers 24-3.
The Cardinal never trailed but
could not relax until the 89th
minute, when sophomore forward
Erin Martin ended a personal
three-game scoring drought with
her 10th goal of the year, putting
the match out of reach.
Only one of the game's six
goals came before the break, as
Emily Burt scored for the first
time in over a month at 29:57.
Her fifth goal of 1994 was aided
by Dey's third assist.
Nebraska countered in the first
minute of the second half. Fresh
man Stephanie Vacek scored her
seventh goal of the year, a close-in
left side shot, off of freshman
Jamie Riley's team-leading ninth
assist.
Thirty minutes passed before
Murphy and Martin, the Cardi
nal's deadliest one-two punch,
teamed up for Stanford's next two

goals. At 76:21, Martin scored
from just outside the inner box to
seemingly put the stubborn Corn
huskers away. But, for the first
time in 31 games, a Stanford
opponent scored twice. Freshman
Tanya Wright's unassisted goal
from about 12 yards out tied the
score at the 80:15 mark.
Visions of the Cardinal's first
overtime contest of the year were
dashed only 2:46 later, when Mur
phy scored from just right of cen
ter. Martin's fourth assist gave
her the team lead in that catego
ry, and the second multiple-assist
game of her career.
The Huskers lived up to their
reputation as a physical team
with 16 fouls to Stanford's three.
These two victories move the
Cardinal to 12-1 and place it in an
elite four-team contingent vying
for the top spot in the national
rankings. Current No. 1 North
Carolina — which lost at home for
the first time in school history
last Wednesday to Duke — Notre
Dame, Duke and Stanford all
have legitimate shots at claiming
the post the Tar Heels have virtu
ally owned since 1985.
