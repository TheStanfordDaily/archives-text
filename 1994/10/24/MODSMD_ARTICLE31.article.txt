Although some people think there is a
weakness in the Stanford men's water polo
team, the University of the Pacific might
argue otherwise.
The No. 5 Tigers (13-7) became the latest
highly-ranked team to be steamrolled by the
No. 1 Cardinal's offensive machine. The goals
came from just about everyone and in every
way as Stanford (15-1) cruised to a 14-3 victo
ry at deGuerre Pool Saturday.
Eight different Cardinal players earned
their places in the scoring column. Senior
Wolf Wigo and junior Jeremy Laster led the
team with three points apiece.
"Once again, we had balanced scoring,"
said coach Dante Dettamanti. "This was
another game of streaks — we came out 2-0,
then they scored, then we scored six goals in a
row."
The prolonged periods in between Tiger tal
lies were due to the play of Stanford goalkeep
er Jack Bowen and a determined Cardinal
defense.
"UOP has been a pretty low scoring team,"
Wigo said. "Our defense wasn't spectacular
but we played the way we wanted to play. We
dictated the game and got the goals we need
ed."
Wigo also praised the efforts of Bowen in
the net. "Jack played one of his best games of
the year, making three or four outstanding
saves."
Other than two back-handed shots by
Pacific holeman Rey Rivera and a fluke goal
late in the game, Bowen kept the Tigers at
bay.
"I was really happy with this game," Bowen
said. "On the backhands, I think I was still
sliding over to the side that the USC holemen
were shooting to last week."
"But against the No. 5 team in the country,
you figure they will score some goals," Bowen
continued. "I felt like I was back in my groove.
I didn't think I played well against USC even
though we won [18-10]."
Laster's hole defense helped make Bowen's

job easier. He tallied eight steals in the game,
taking the ball from Rivera several times.
"Jeremy played really well," Bowen said. "I
think he's the best hole guard in the nation —
guys are just not used to playing against that
quality of defender."
Dettamanti also commended the defensive
effort carried out against Rivera, who scored
eight goals in a game against UC-Irvine earli
er this season.
"Rivera is big and strong, but he doesn't
move to the ball when it is passed to him,"
Dettamanti said. "Jeremy has long arms and
very good legs. He used quickness to get to the
ball first. Laster was eating that guy alive."
While the Cardinal clearly routed the
Tigers, Dettamanti felt that the play was "dis
rupted" and "disjointed" because of the
game's officials.
"I felt there were several referee calls that
took us out of our rhythm," Dettamanti said.
"I didn't feel like there was a good flow to the
game."
Despite the lack of smoothness in the

match, Dettamanti continues to draw compar
isons between this year's team and his cham
pionship squads of the '80s.
"We're starting to do what I have said
great teams have to do, and that is domi
nate," Dettamanti said. "We've beaten No. 2
USC by eight goals and No. 5 UOP by 11.
We're putting it together on offense and
defense."
Laster agreed with the coach, adding,
"We're really coming together. The whole
team has been together now and everyone is
healthy."
Dettamanti is looking to focus primarily on
his team's defensive progress for the rest of
the season.
"The offense doesn't worry me," he said. "I
know we will score goals, we're an excellent
offensive team. We need to keep the pressure
on defense. If we continue to play like this, we
will have an excellent chance at going all the
way this year."
The Pacific Tigers would find no argument
in that.
