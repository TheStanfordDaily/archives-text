"It was a big success, we came
together as a team to do some
thing pretty significant."
Pretty significant? Sophomore
goalkeeper Ryan Craig perhaps
should have said "extremely sig
nificant." Stanford men's soccer
(4-9-2) dethroned fourth-ranked
Fresno State 1-0 at home on Fri
day to keep alive its hopes of win
ning the Mountain Division.

The Bulldogs (12-2-1) suffered
their only defeat since the first
game of the season. Their record in
conference play now stands at 4-1-
1, versus the Cardinal's at 3-1-1.
Before the game, Fresno had a lock
on the Mountain Division, but
Stanford's victory opens up the
race for the division championship.
"Two things had to happen, and
they did happen," said head coach
Colin Lindores. "One, we played
very well in defense, and two, Fres
no did not play well. I didn't think
they executed well. Perhaps it's
just another case of overlooking an
opponent who demonstrates a
record that's not too good."
The Cardinal's defense, led by
senior Jeff Kogl and junior Mark
Walker, thwarted the Bulldogs'
very direct and potent attack. In

fact, Stanford posted its first
shutout of the season against
Fresno. On the few breakaways
that Fresno did manage, particu
larly at the opening of the second
half, Craig made crucial stops.
"I've been complimented on the
game," Craig said, "but the defense
really deserves all the credit."
On offense, freshman midfielder
Eric Vandevelde continued to pro
vide firepower for the Cardinal scor
ing at the start of the second half off
a cross from sophomore defender
Brad Davies. After taking the 1-0
lead, Stanford bunkered down
defensively and held onto the win.
As the final score indicated, the
match was a very even contest and
at certain points the Bulldogs had
the chance to tie or take the game.
After Vandevelde scored, the Bull
dogs almost found the back of the
net on a breakaway but the ball
hit the goal post instead.
"They're a really strong team,"
Vandevelde said. "There were
times when it could go either way,
but we pulled it through. It shows
how we're capable of playing even
though all along we got a bad rap
because of our record."
One factor that must be con
sidered in light of the Cardinal's
losing record is the slate of
injuries suffered this year.
Against the Bulldogs, Stanford
went without the services of
freshman midfielder Justin
Leßlanc and only saw limited
action from junior forward Car
men D'Onofrio. Both are part of
the long line of injured starters.
Thus, the Cardinal faced the
Bulldogs with perhaps its most
battered lineup of the season.
That fact contributed to the ten
sion over what the game meant to
Stanford's season.
"A loss would have been fatal,"
Craig said. "We certainly haven't
made it yet though. We've still got
a tough road ahead."
One potential roadblock in
Stanford's path is its earlier loss
to the University of Washington
in conference play. The Cardinal
must now focus on winning the
remainder of its Mountain Divi
sion games to hold onto its
chances of capturing the champi
onship. However, by knocking off
Fresno, Stanford has already
demonstrated its capabilities.
"It's a little early to say this,"
Craig said, "but even if we don't
go on to .win the league [this winl
does give us some conclusion,
some sense that we did accom
plish something."
