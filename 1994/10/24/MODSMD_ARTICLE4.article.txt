### Beth Berselli Senior staff writer 
Friends of Jessica Willliams, 19, say her love of
sunflowers is representative of her life.
"Sunflowers are sweet and open and make you
smile," said senior Valerie Richardson, a resident
assistant in Mirrielees where Williams lived.
"When you look at a sunflower you can't help but
smile. It was the same way with Jessica."
A native of Carson, Calif., Williams died
Thursday night as the result of a car crash in
Hayward, Calif. She was in her sophomore year
at Stanford.
