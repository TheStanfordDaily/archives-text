## 
### Beth Berselli Senior staff writer 
Friends of Jessica Willliams, 19, say her love of
sunflowers is representative of her life.
"Sunflowers are sweet and open and make you
smile," said senior Valerie Richardson, a resident
assistant in Mirrielees where Williams lived.
"When you look at a sunflower you can't help but
smile. It was the same way with Jessica."
A native of Carson, Calif., Williams died
Thursday night as the result of a car crash in
Hayward, Calif. She was in her sophomore year
at Stanford.

A memorial program for
Williams was held Saturday night
in Memorial Church, and her
ftineral lb scheduled for Wednes
day in Los Angeles. An additional
memorial service for Williams
will be held on campus within the
next fa* weeks.
The youngest daughter of
Claude and Helen Williams, Jes-
Williams attended Banning
High School in Carson, where she
wa* a cheerleader. Williams' older
sister, Jennifer, graduated from
Statfbid in 1993.
• During her freshman year at
Stanford, Williams lived in Palo
ma House in Florence Moore
Hall.
She was a director for Stanford
on Nutrition, which col
lects unused food on campus and
distributes it to pantries and soup
kitchens for hungry and homeless
people.

Williams planned to major in
industrial engineering. She was
involved in the Society of Black
Scientist and Engineers and had
just started working as a waitress
at the Faculty Club, said Teresa
Matt, Williams' roommate in Mir
rielees.
She was motivated and ambi
tious, but she balanced every
thing really well, Matt said. "She
knew how to work, but she also
knew how to relax," she said.
Many people will remember
Williams for her sweet smile and
outgoing personality, Matt said.
"I remember her as a person
who smiled a lot," said Julie Tay
lor, a resident fellow for Mir
rielees.
"She was really outgoing and
could make friends with every
body," Matt said. "We'd go places
and she'd introduce me to people
and I'd be like, 'How'd you meet
that person? ' "
One of Williams' best friends
was her boyfriend, sophomore
Eliel Swinton, Matt said.
Williams and Swinton met at

Prospective Freshman Week dur
ing their senior year of high
school. Because they are both
from the Los Angeles area, they
began dating right away, and last
summer Swinton gave her a
"promise" ring.
Williams and Swinton were
the "corniest couple in the
world," Matt said. "They'd do
stuff like spontaneously start
reciting entire scenes from
movies."
Williams always "wanted to
have about 10 kids," Matt said.
A "hard-core football fan,"
Williams also loved Michael Jor
dan, Snoop Doggy Dog and candy
corn, Matt added.
"She was real energetic and
vibrant," she said. "I don't think
anyone looking back would think
she ever wasted a single moment.
She always gave 100 percent for
everything she did."
"She always danced around
the house," Matt remembered.
"She used to stand at the kitchen
stove and do this crazy little
dance while she cooked dinner."
