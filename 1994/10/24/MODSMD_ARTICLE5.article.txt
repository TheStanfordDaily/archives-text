# Med school keeps grading policy
## A 						noncompetitive atmosphere remains a prioity 
### Marc Lee Staff writer 
The Medical School Faculty Senate ended discus
sion about proposed changes to the school's grading
policy with a 16-3 vote of confidence Friday for re
taining the current retake policy in the school's pass /
fail system, commonly praised as the heart of the
noncompetitive culture there.
Under current policy, students earn passing or
failing marks instead of letter grades in their preclin
ical courses and clerkships. Notations of failure on
the transcript are removed when students subse
quently retake a class and pass it.
The idea of changing the grading policy was
"spurred in part by issues in the main campus" last

year, said Asst. Pediatrics Prof. Lawrence Mathers,
who is chair of the senate.
Some Medical School faculty suggested that failed
classes should be noted to lend more integrity to stu
dents' transcripts.
The University Faculty Senate last June over
whelmingly approved a stricter grading policy, in
cluding notation of repeated classes and the institu
tion of a failing grade.
The changes do not apply to those in professional
schools, with the exception of Ph.D. candidates in the
School of Medicine.
Discussion at the meeting Friday focused on rec
ognizing both failure and achievement in students'
records.
Faculty senate member Patricia
Cross said that while matriculants
come from competitive premedical
atmospheres, they are also able to
mature and flourish in Stanford's
noncompetitive environment.
This type of individual develop
ment is more important than
pushing for any stratification, said
Cross, an associate dean of medical
student affairs and associate pro
fessor of cell biology.
Assoc. Surgery Prof. Donald
Dafoe argued, however, that Stan
ford medical students may be at a
disadvantage in competing for
selective internships and residen
cies, given Stanford's more forgiv
ing transcripts.
About 64 percent of last year's
medical school graduates got into
their top choice residency program,
according to figures from the med
ical school's student affairs office.
And 86 percent were accepted by
one of their top three choices.
Medical students generally
oppose the notation of failures. A
poll of 184 medical students by the
Stanford Medical Students Associ
ation showed that 88 percent are
opposed to having a historical tran
script that would note failures, said
third-year medical student MunLsh
Gupta, who is president of the
association.
The survey also found that 95
percent of students are against
instituting a grading system that
would denote honors.
Gupta added that activities at
the preclinical level and clerkship
evaluations already serve to help in
distinguishing students.
Dr. Donald Regula, chair of the
senate's committee on courses and
curriculum, said he agreed with
medical students' concerns about
changing the "very delicately bal
anced culture" at the medical school.
"If we start screwing around
with the transcript, we're going to
take that culture and toss it out the
window," he said.
Regula, a director in the Depart
ment of Pathology, noted that the

school's mission statement
includes generating leaders in
medicine.
He said this goal is accom
plished as students conduct
research, publish their work and
engage in community service.
If the retake policy were
changed or an honors system were
instituted, he said, the mission
statement should be revised to
read: "We're going to make the
best clinical students on paper."
"Leave [the transcript] as it
stands," Regula concluded.
Ophthalmology Prof. Michael
Marmor moved to keep the current
grading policy and met with over
whelming support.
"The nature and philosophy of
our school ... depend on the cur
rent system," Gupta later said. He
added that he is pleased with the
senate's responsiveness to the stu
dents via its decision.
Earlier, Marmor proposed a
"modest compromise" to retain the
current grading policy yet allow
letters of commendation to be
placed in students' files "to reflect
their high performance."
Currently, such letters from
course directors and outside orga
nizations are not kept in the per
manent files.
Radiation Oncology Prof. Sarah
Donaldson, a member of the sen
ate's committee on student perfor
mance, moved that all sponta
neously sent letters be included in
student files. That motion narrow
ly passed.
Under the new policy, all letters
sent to the Office of Student
Affairs will be kept on file and used
at the dean's discretion, Mathers
said.
After the meeting, Gupta said,
"It could potentially benefit many
students."
"We just have to be careful that
it doesn't have unforeseen effects,"
he said, adding that he hopes the
letters do not become "institution
alized."
Course directors will be neither
required nor encouraged to write
such letters.
Mathers said the new policy is
not one of giving honors and
"doesn't set the expectations of a
quota" for writing these letters.

percent of students are against
instituting a grading system that
would denote honors.
Gupta added that activities at
the preclinical level and clerkship
evaluations already serve to help in
distinguishing students.
Dr. Donald Regula, chair of the
senate's committee on courses and
curriculum, said he agreed with
medical students' concerns about
changing the "very delicately bal
anced culture" at the medical school.
"If we start screwing around
with the transcript, we're going to
take that culture and toss it out the
window," he said.
Regula, a director in the Depart
ment of Pathology, noted that the

school's mission statement
includes generating leaders in
medicine.
He said this goal is accom
plished as students conduct
research, publish their work and
engage in community service.
If the retake policy were
changed or an honors system were
instituted, he said, the mission
statement should be revised to
read: "We're going to make the
best clinical students on paper."
"Leave [the transcript] as it
stands," Regula concluded.
Ophthalmology Prof. Michael
Marmor moved to keep the current
grading policy and met with over
whelming support.
"The nature and philosophy of
our school ... depend on the cur
rent system," Gupta later said. He
added that he is pleased with the
senate's responsiveness to the stu
dents via its decision.
Earlier, Marmor proposed a
"modest compromise" to retain the
current grading policy yet allow
letters of commendation to be
placed in students' files "to reflect
their high performance."
Currently, such letters from
course directors and outside orga
nizations are not kept in the per
manent files.
Radiation Oncology Prof. Sarah
Donaldson, a member of the sen
ate's committee on student perfor
mance, moved that all sponta
neously sent letters be included in
student files. That motion narrow
ly passed.
Under the new policy, all letters
sent to the Office of Student
Affairs will be kept on file and used
at the dean's discretion, Mathers
said.
After the meeting, Gupta said,
"It could potentially benefit many
students."
"We just have to be careful that
it doesn't have unforeseen effects,"
he said, adding that he hopes the
letters do not become "institution
alized."
Course directors will be neither
required nor encouraged to write
such letters.
Mathers said the new policy is
not one of giving honors and
"doesn't set the expectations of a
quota" for writing these letters.
