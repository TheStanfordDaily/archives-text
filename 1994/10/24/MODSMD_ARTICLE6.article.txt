# A 						new 'homebase'...
## El Centro plans EPA community center 
### Crystal Carreon 
The East Palo Alto community
center students demanded during
last spring's hunger strike is now
in its early planning stages, due in
part to the efforts of several stu
dents in liaison with El Centro
Chicano.
Though the project is still in its
"preliminary stages," according to
MEChA co-chair Felipe Barragan,
a committee is looking into estab
lishing a community center in an
East Palo Alto apartment com
plex.
According to sources at El Cen
tro, Brad Ehikian, owner of the
University Center Apartment
Complex, offered apartment space
to the students, tentatively free of
rent.

Ehikian offered after reading
about last May's protest during
which students, many of whom
were Chicano, fasted for three
days to draw attention to various
demands including the develop
ment of a community center in
East Palo Alto, the sources said.
Ehikian would not comment on
the students' plans.
Barragan said that the purpose
behind creating a "home base" in
the East Palo Alto apartment
complex is to offer education,
mentoring and legal advice to the
tenants, and later branch out to
the community at large.
"The larger goal is to provide a
place where other charity organi
zations — the Red Cross, for ex
ample — can come to offer their
services," he said. "This is a com
munity with a lot of needs."
Stanford graduate Julia Gon
zalez Luna, one of the fasters last

May, said she agrees with Barra
gan.
"The theory behind using this
apartment space [if we decide to
use it| is that it will grow into
something bigger in the future,"
she said. "Our original purpose in
developing a center is that we
want to serve a larger communi
ty. | However 1 the purpose right

now is to serve the tenants."
Barragan said he hopes the
University will also take responsi
bility in establishing an East Palo
Alto community center later on,
since many of those who work on
the custodial staff, food service
and in landscaping live in the city,
located three miles away from
Stanford.

Although the student commit
tee formulating the plan of action
in East Palo Alto operates inde
pendent of University dictum,
under the terms signed by admin
istrators to end the hunger strike,
Stanford is obliged to help stu
dents raise funds for such a com
munity center.
According to those terms, the

University will "explore ways,
including fund raising assistance,
to support student initiatives to
consolidate and better coordinate
their service programs in East
Palo Alto."
Haas Center for Public Service
Director Tim Stanton said he
views the possibility of using the
apartment complex as a reason

able first step in which Stanford
can become involved.
"We enthusiastically support
this," he said.
Many in El Centro involved on
the project said that if and when
the center is established, it will
serve as a "model" from which to
pursue further projects in East
Palo Alto.
