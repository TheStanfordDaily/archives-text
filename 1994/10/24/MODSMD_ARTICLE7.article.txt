# When you're feeling those homesick blues
## 
### Gia Cobb 
He isn't living in this world. He grieves for
something he lost — not just the house with
his parents in it, but the country, the attitude
toward life, the way people talked and what
they talked about. He has no energy, no goals,
no desire to be happy.
He is homesick. And he's a Stanford
sophomore.
For many students, especially new stu
dents, homesickness is common, said Dr. Vin
cent I)'Andrea, a psychiatrist at Counseling
and Psychological Services.
"Freshman feel excitement about starting
college and curiosity at the newness of it all,"
D'Andrea said. "It's the honeymoon phase."
However, when orientation activities
wind down and the last "good dose of family"
runs dry, plenty of students suffer from sep
aration anxiety, feel sad or have crying
spells, he said.
Laura Corbett, a freshman from New Jer
sey, said, "You know you're homesick when
you can't think about home without tears


Ardith-Grace J. Banez — Daily
coming to your eyes."
Homesickness occurs in stu
dents because the framework that
once affirmed their identity — all
the familiar and nourishing
MMota of life — is left behind
wnen they head for college,
D'Andrea Mid.
Students have to make up for
the locs of familiarity, D'Andrea
said, by rebuilding their sense of
self, establishing new friends and
defining a new role for themselves
as college students.
Doing this is a difficult and time
ly process, especially for Corbett who
said Ae had never been away from
her family longer than 10 dayß.
"The friends you've had since
you were 2 years old to the time
yeu're 18 just can't compare with
people that you've known for three
weeks, whether you live with them
er not," ahe said.
While students slowly create
this "new layer of identity,"
D'Andrea said they control home
sickness by surrounding them
selves with the familiar — posters,
stuffed animals and compact discs.

Some just try to keep busy.
"Controlled dips into the past to
re-experience good feelings are
healthy," D'Andrea said. "When
the world is unpredictable, that's
reassuring."
However, too much reminiscing
can lead to depression, as one
sophomore discovered. To allevi
ate his homesickness, he said he
indulges in nostalgia. The sopho
more, who did not wish to be
named, imagines himself sitting at
the edge of a harbor watching fer
ries and sea gulls as he did so many
times before. While he admits
doing this saps his strength, he
also feels invigorated by it.
"It's a double-edged sword;
reminiscing makes you happy," he
said. "It's a drug and you get a
high from it."
Students can assuage home
sickness by maintaining just
enough contact with home
through phone calls and mail,
D'Andrea said. This keeps commu
nication lines open and reminds
them that they are not forgotten.
Corbett said she has experi
enced both positive and negative
aspects of frequent communica
tion with her parents. They send
her care packages — with boxes of
Play Dough, Macaroni and Cheese,

a laundry bag on which her moth
er embroidered a frog and a Hal
loween costume her mom hand
sewed — once or twice a week.
"It's good because it lets me
know they still love me, but bad
because it reminds me that they
are not here," she said. "There's no
complete cure for homesickness."
The unnamed sophomore men
tioned earlier said he feels an ethos
exists among students that it is
not okay to be homesick.
"To be at Stanford means you
are a success and must feel good
about yourself. If you don't, the
solution is to do push ups, drink
beer, give yourself a quick fix and a
slap on the back," he said.
Dr. D'Andrea encourages stu
dents to "keep a perspective on
what's going on and not to neglect
the social environment in the
dorm. Say 'yes' to things in order
to fill some of the void. Eat well,
rest, exercise and take care of
yourself."
"Be very exploratory," he
added. "Find your limits and dig
into the present. Commitment to
where you are is very important."
Corbett said she has that kind
of commitment. "I'm staying here.
I can't give up that easily. You
can't stay home forever."
