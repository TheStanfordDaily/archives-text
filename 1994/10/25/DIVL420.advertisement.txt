oortraits of oooressed women and other
deorived members of Indian societv.

dren she oersonallv knew reveal her comoassion for the desoerate oliÂ£ht
of the disinherited ooor in India, as well as her intense rage at those who
exoloit women and the disoossessed. Mahadevi connects the exoloitation

ture and time. Stiftfhew tram Aiy Past is now available in English for the
first time.
