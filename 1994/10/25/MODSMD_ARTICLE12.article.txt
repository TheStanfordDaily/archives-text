# Stanford gets $21.4M for materials research
## 
### Shirley Park Staff writer 
Two University research
groups have received awards
totaling $21.4 million from the
National Science Foundation to
conduct non-theoretical research
which can be used in everyday
society.
Stanford's Center for Materi
als Research (CMR) won a $10.2
million award, while an $11.2 mil
lion award will fund a new center
for polymer studies called the
Center for Polymer Interfaces
and Macromolecular Assemblies
(CPIMA).
Out of 156 preliminary propos
als submitted by universities

around the country, the field was
pared down to 16 finalists and
then to the 11 award recipients
representing nine universities.
Stanford was the only university
to receive two awards.
"This is a real tribute to Stan
ford and particularly to the mate
rials research community," said
Applied Physics Prof. Mac
Beasley, the director of CMR.
"CMR has been in existence for 20
years ... this keeps us all going
for another five years."
Both groups study science
and engineering problems appli
cable to society, including the
production of better protective
coatings for computer chips,
new sensor types and better

video displays.
The new center will study poly
mers — materials such as plastic
composed of spaghetti-like
molecules made from smaller
chemical units.
The center will set a precedent
in being the first NSF-established
materials center to have a full cor
porate partner, IBM. CPIMA and
IBM, together with UC-Davis
researchers, will create and study
novel thin films made from poly
mers.
CPIMA hopes this fundamen
tal research will harvest a number
of potential applications, such as
electronic devices, sensors, lubri
cants and adhesives.
CMR has made several break -

throughs using an interdisci
plinary approach and fusing
diverse fields such as chemistry,
physics, geochemistry and electri
cal engineering, said Chemistry
Prof. Hans C. Andersen, acting
director of the center, in a state
ment.
The center is hailed for its
invention of films with atomically
small thin layers, which have
been used in various capacities,
from night vision goggles to hos
pital x-ray imaging tubes.
The foundation combined two
programs to create the new Mate
rials Research Science and Engi
neering Center program, under
whose auspices the awards were
granted.
