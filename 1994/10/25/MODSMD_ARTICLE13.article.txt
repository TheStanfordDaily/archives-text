Houston cleanup
HOUSTON (AP) - The
Houston Ship Channel
reopened yesterday after sal
vage crews removed a sunken
tugboat and used scanning
equipment to ensure there
were no cars, mobile homes or
other flood debris blocking one
of the nation's busiest ports.
The channel was closed a
week ago because of flooding
caused by torrential rains. On
Friday, the floodwaters subsid
ed somewhat to reveal a tug
boat near the mouth of the San
Jacinto River, a waterway east
of Houston that leads into the
Houston Ship Channel and

empties into Galveston Bay.
Coast Guard officials said
they were ahead of schedule in
their effort to clean up an esti
mated 200,000 gallons of
petroleum products spilled in
the river.
Officials believe that
swirling water or debris from
the swollen river ruptured at
least four pipelines Thursday,
causing fires that raced across
water and burned homes and
boats.
"I feel pretty confident that
by Wednesday we will have got
ten the bulk of the oil up, or at
least 95 percent," said Coast
Guard Capt. Richard Ford,
coordinator of the cleanup.
