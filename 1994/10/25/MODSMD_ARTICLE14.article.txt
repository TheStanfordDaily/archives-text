# Clinton announces drop in budget deficit
## Economic growth, spending cuts, tax increases credited to $87 billion drop since 1992 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The U.S. budget
deficit fell to $203 billion in the just-completed
fiscal year, the Clinton administration
announced yesterday, crediting "very disci
plined" Democratic management for achieving
the largest two-year deficit reduction in history.
"The bottom line is getting stronger every
day," a jubilant Clinton said in a speech to
business leaders in Cleveland. "For the first
time in 20 years, the deficit has gone down
two years in a row."
wftiile President Clinton and his economic
team sought to capitalize on the accomplish
ment, Republicans were brandishing a secret
White House memo they claimed laid bare the
administration's fiscal hypocrisy.
They charged that the Oct. 3 memo by
White House budget director Alice Rivlin
exposed an agenda for higher taxes and cuts in
popular government benefit programs to cope
with rising deficits in future years.

With two weeks to go before the election,
both sides sought to portray the budget debate
to their advantage. The administration
claimed that its willingness to enact a $500
billion deficit reduction program last year was
paying benefits in an improving economy and
shrinking deficit after 12 years of failed
Republican promises.
Clinton noted that before his deficit pro
gram was approved, the imbalance for the
1994 budget year had been projected to hit
$305 billion.
Talking on a radio call-in program, Clinton
said his administration had eliminated unnec
essary government programs while at the
same time boosting investment in education,
training and new technologies.
"And that's what I want to keep doing â€”
managing this thing in a very disciplined
way," he said.
A combination of spending cuts and tax

increases in Clinton's deficit program along
with stronger-than-expected economic growth
led to the $203 billion actual result for the
budget year that ended Sept. 30.
That was down from a deficit of $255 bil
lion in 1993 and a record $290.4 billion gap
between tax revenues and spending in 1992.
The administration is projecting that the
deficit will decline further to $167 billion in
the current budget year, producing three
straight deficit reductions for the first time
since the Truman administration.
However, the trouble is that these gains are
temporary with rising costs for health care and
other government benefit programs expected
to push the deficit sharply higher after 1995.
It was this situation that Rivlin sought to
address in her memo, which laid out a variety
of options for the administration to consider
as it prepares its 1996 budget, which goes to
Congress next February.
