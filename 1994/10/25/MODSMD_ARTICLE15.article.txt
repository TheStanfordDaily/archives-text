# Actor Raul Julia dies of stroke
## Versatile star's career spanned many theater, film projects 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) — Raul Julia, the darkly hand
some actor who starred with equal aplomb as Othel
lo on stage and lusty Gomez Addams in the movies'
"The Addams Family," died yesterday of complica
tions from a stroke. He was 54.
The Puerto Rican-born star died at the North
Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, on Long
Island, where he had been admitted last week. He
will be given a state funeral in Puerto Rico.
He played a tormented South American political
prisoner befriended by a gay man — William Hurt,
in his Oscar-winning performance — in the 1985
movie "Kiss of the Spider Woman." He also played
opposite Anjelica Huston as the libidinous Gomez in
"The Addams Family" in 1991 and its 1993 sequel
"Addams Family Values."
"He was a wonderful, wonderful person, one of
the greats," Huston said from Los Angeles. "It's an
absolute heartbreaking loss."
He was known for a commanding presence, a
thoughtful manner, a strong, resonant voice and a
grandly theatrical, physical style.
Julia credited Errol Flynn's "Robin Hood" with
inspiring him to seek an acting career. "It was one of
the first movies I saw, and I decided that was the life
for me," he said.

The versatile actor first made a name for himself
in the late 1960s at Joseph Papp's New York Shake
speare Festival.
"Raul's involvement not only on stage but off, as
a board member, has meant a great deal to the insti
tution," said George C. Wolfe, the festival's produc
er. "He will be deeply missed."
Over the years, he was seen in the title roles in
"Man of La Mancha," "Macbeth" and "Othello"; the
Fellini-like film director in "Nine"; Proteus in a
musical "Two Gentlemen of Verona"; Maj. Saranoff
in Shaw's "Arms and the Man"; and Mac Heath in
"The Threepenny Opera."
He was nominated for Tony Awards for "Nine,"
"Threepenny Opera," "Where's Charley?" and
"Two Gentlemen of Verona."
"My ideal is to go back and forth between theater
and film," he once said. "The experiences contribute
to one another."
Actor Edward James Olmos praised his friend's
versatility.
"Not too many of them can sing and do musicals
and dance, and at the same time dramatic pieces and
do comedy." And, on a personal level, said Olmos,
Julia "was a very, very caring and kind and giving
man."
