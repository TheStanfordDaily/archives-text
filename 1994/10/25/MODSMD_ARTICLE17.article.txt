## Editorial Head-butting hurts 
### 
Picture ID should be
mandatory for entry
to on-campus parties

CAMPUS SECURITY IS not
a serious problem — yet.
But with the recent head
butting incident at a Theta Delta
Chi party two weekends ago, stu
dents should easily see the need to
be a little more conscious of the
people around their residence or
fraternity. And it is because of this
incident that the University
should push to ensure quick
implementation of the universal
ID system, along with additional
policies to better maintain campus
security.
The head-butting incident
occurred when a Stanford student
was singled-out inside the Theta
Delts' party, and surrounded by
four suspected gang members and
high school students from East
Palo Alto. As the circumstances of
this incident show, it is not diffi
cult to obtain a Stanford ID and
enter an on-campus party.
The Theta Delts took the same
necessary precautions that are
implemented at every fraternity
party — they hired security guards.
However, the fact that four stu
dents completely unaffiliated with
Stanford were able to get into a
"SUID Required" party, shows the
need for additional security mea-
Wftffl? hired security guards
are certainly ominous looking, in
reality they have no way of knowing
or recognizing Stanford students.
As many students can attest,
when visiting friends want to go
to a on-campus party, it takes
just a moment of inquiry to find
someone not using their ID for
the evening. Being able to pass as
a Stanford student becomes as
easy as actually being one — just
show a security guard a red and
white, bar-coded piece of paper.
While Stanford students hopeful

ly take responsibility for keeping
their guests' actions within the
line of reason, there is really no
way to recognize unwanted
guests.
Last year's incident at a Toyon
Hall party — during which Palo
Alto high school students attempt
ed to crash and then end the party
by breaking a window and pulling
a fire alarm — also demonstrates
that more stringent security pre
cautions need to be in place at all
events, regardless of what mea
sures are currently enforced.
Once the universal picture IDs
are handed out and put into use
on campus, it will no longer be
easy to pass as a Stanford student
— the picture will prove invalu
able for helping hired security
ensure that actual Stanford stu
dents are the only ones in the par
ties. However, given that the date
for the new IDs has been pushed
back to spring quarter, now would
be a good time to start requiring
students to show a picture ID
along with their student ID.
This rule would not be out of
line, since security guards are sup
posed to check identification if a
student intends to drink. All cam
pus parties should require those
attending to bring a piece of picture
identification as well as their Stan
ford ID, regardless of whether stu
dents intend to drink.
While some may consider it a
nuisance to carry two pieces of iden
tification, the extra security mea
sures could do a great deal to guar
antee that another head-butting
incident — or anything more seri
ous — does not occur again.
Although this precautionary
measure would make it difficult for
outside friends to attend parties,
such stringency will arrive regard
less.
After all, once spring quarter
rolls around and everyone has their
universal IDs, the only way people
will be able to attend on-campus
parties will be the same way that
all Stanford students do presently
— by being one.
