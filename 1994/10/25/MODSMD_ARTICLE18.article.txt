Resident Fellow warns against overbearing alchohol policy

I COMMEND YOU for the attention
your lead article on October 21
brings to Stanford's efforts to
reduce problem drinking on campus.
Unfortunately, the article leaves the
impression that Residential Education,
as implemented in the different resi
dences on campus, encourages or con
tributes to alcohol abuse, and that
somehow binge drinking is nurtured in
our communities. I believe that implica
tion is unfair, since we are the ones on
the front lines, establishing construc
tive standards and helping students

overcome abusive behaviors.
The issues of substance abuse are
complex, and while many of us in the
community can agree on the signifi
cance of the problem, there appears to
be no single, easy solution. 1 am con
cerned that your article presents
increased enforcement as just such a
solution. The same Columbia study
cited in the article states that "Some
[universities! express concern that
strict bans might drive the problem
underground or off-campus where stu
dents with problems will be unreach

able. But the primary reason schools
are confused about how to deal with
excessive drinking on campus is that
nearly three quarters of their popula
tions are legally underage, and teach
ing minors how to 'drink responsibly'
is technically illegal."
I feel we must be careful when
establishing and implementing new
policies that we preserve some of the
desirable features of the current sys
tem. First, we depend critically on stu
dents caring for each other, and I
believe that is a cornerstone of any sue

cessful approach. Second, as the article
states, we recognize that each student
is making his or her own decisions. Not
only is this realistic, but almost all stu
dents choose abstinence or responsible
usage.
I fear that in a system of increased
local enforcement there will be sub
stantially more peer pressure for
abuse.
