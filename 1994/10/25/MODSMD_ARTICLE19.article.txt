# Congressman Dingell the true villain of the indirect-cost scandal
## 
### 
The Stanford Daily's description of
the vindication of Stanford University
and its former president over a fraud
case involving federal research funds
omitted an important sub-plot — that
the true villain of the piece, Congress
man John Dingell, is left untarnished.
During highly-publicized congres
sional hearings, Dingell, who was fed
misinformation by a self-styled
whistleblower, made unsupported alle
gations and accusations of malfea
sance. As described in the article, hav
ing found them groundless after four
years of intensive investigation, the
government has withdrawn all
charges.
But what of the reputation of a
world-class research university and
that of it former president, Donald
Kennedy — renowned scholar, admin
istrator and public servant — who
resigned under the Dingell-seeded
cloud? How can they be made whole
again? Will the Congress reimburse
Stanford's millions of dollars in legal

fees? Will Kennedy resume his presi
dency?
We seem to have learned little about
trampling on an individual's rights
from the excesses of anti-Communist
crusader Senator Joseph McCarthy. It
is about time that there were checks on
the arrogance and demagoguery of
members of Congress; any of us could
be next in the public pillory called an
investigative hearing. In the meantime,
Congressman Dingell is a walking
advertisement for term limits.
