# Casper discusses CUE, cores
## Dead Week, DRs, time to degree also addressed in candid interview Presidential Perspectives: First in a two part series 
### Beth Berselli Senior staff writer 
Speaking candidly about everything
from distribution requirements to Dead
Week, University President Gerhard
Casper yesterday outlined his personal vi
sion of where the Commission on Under
graduate Education's final report is head
ed.
Casper spent much of the interview dis
cussing his contentment with and concerns
about the report. In particular, he explored
several ideas of elements he feels should be
included in the redefined Cultures, Ideas
and Values courses.
In its final report — released two weeks
ago — the commission recommended that
the World and American Cultures require
ments be folded into a redefined and re

named CIV course, composing a unified
"cultures core".
The ultimate goal of the new cultures
core should be to "leave our students with a
way of thinking about these matters, mak
ing them problematic," Casper said. "Facts
are not what we want to convey in this
course. For that, people can read an article
in the Encyclopedia Britannica."
Casper outlined his own vision of a
three-quarter sequence with quarterly con
centrations in a world civilization, Ameri
can civilization, and a critical analysis of
culture as a concept, facilitated though

close textual readings of a select number of
works.
A relatively in-depth exposure to a civi
lization other than our own must be in
cluded in the cultures core, Casper said.
The University must make sure that its
students have a good grasp of world cul
tures, he said.
In addition, Casper said the cultures
core should include "a quarter spent look
ing at a few texts that are read closely with
students and faculty jointly worried about
interpretation."
Casper said he was somewhat disap
pointed that the commission did not ad
dress the importance of reading texts close
ly.
"I believe it is very important that stu
dents read a small number of texts closely.
