# Casper discusses CUE, cores
## Dead Week, DRs, time to degree also addressed in candid interview Presidential Perspectives: First in a two part series 
### Beth Berselli Senior staff writer 
Speaking candidly about everything
from distribution requirements to Dead
Week, University President Gerhard
Casper yesterday outlined his personal vi
sion of where the Commission on Under
graduate Education's final report is head
ed.
Casper spent much of the interview dis
cussing his contentment with and concerns
about the report. In particular, he explored
several ideas of elements he feels should be
included in the redefined Cultures, Ideas
and Values courses.
In its final report — released two weeks
ago — the commission recommended that
the World and American Cultures require
ments be folded into a redefined and re

named CIV course, composing a unified
"cultures core".
The ultimate goal of the new cultures
core should be to "leave our students with a
way of thinking about these matters, mak
ing them problematic," Casper said. "Facts
are not what we want to convey in this
course. For that, people can read an article
in the Encyclopedia Britannica."
Casper outlined his own vision of a
three-quarter sequence with quarterly con
centrations in a world civilization, Ameri
can civilization, and a critical analysis of
culture as a concept, facilitated though

close textual readings of a select number of
works.
A relatively in-depth exposure to a civi
lization other than our own must be in
cluded in the cultures core, Casper said.
The University must make sure that its
students have a good grasp of world cul
tures, he said.
In addition, Casper said the cultures
core should include "a quarter spent look
ing at a few texts that are read closely with
students and faculty jointly worried about
interpretation."
Casper said he was somewhat disap
pointed that the commission did not ad
dress the importance of reading texts close
ly.
"I believe it is very important that stu
dents read a small number of texts closely.

I think less is more," he said.
"The Cliff Notes approach to a lot
of books that are on the reading
list is no good."
Hopefully this issue will be
part of future discussions about
the cultures core, he said.
Casper said the core should
function as half of "an integrated
core requirement." The remaining
half would be v»mposed of a three
quarter science course
for non-scientists, also recommend
ed by the commission, he said.
"It is absolutely crucial that
the different approaches to
knowledge... be fully understood
as different approaches and that
there exist some tension between
the two [cores]," Casper said.
Casper said he hopes these two
cores will be up and running with
in the next three years.
From depth to breadth
Moving to a discussion of the
remaining breadth requirements,

Casper said he supports the com
mission's recommendation to
reduce the number of DRs by two.
"I think the present DRs have
incrementally become unrecog
nizable as requirements," he said.
"They are just a nuisance to many
students."
In addition, Casper shared his
views on the commission's pro
posals regarding the academic cal
endar, especially praising the rec
ommendation to abolish classes
on the Thursday and Friday of
each Dead Week.
"I think that is absolutely a
step in the right direction," he
said. "I think Dead Week was a
very unhappy institution because
it pretended to be something else
from what it was." He added that
he hopes this recommendation
can be addressed quickly.
Regarding — time-to-degree
options, Casper — who made
headlines in his first year as pres
ident by suggesting that an
undergraduate degree could be
completed in less than four years
— said he is glad the commission
recognized that "this should be a
decision made by the students

and their parents and not by the
University."
Casper said he doesn't accept
"the notion that four years was
laid down by natural law. There's
no other reason for four years
than that's the way we have
always done it. That is not
enough of a justification," he said.
Hopefully, the University will
"develop ways of thinking" about
this issue within the year, he said.
Finding advice, funds
Casper also said that Stan
ford's advising system must be
dealt with within the year.
"We have to have, by the end of
this year, a better way of going
about advising," Casper said.
A new task force being formed
by Provost Condoleezza Rice will
study ways to improve Stan
ford's advising system, Casper
said.
Casper praised the commis
sion's recommendation to give
additional resources to the
Undergraduate Advising Center.
"We need to make it easier for
students to be able to go to a pro
fessional staff that has a very

good understanding of,all the
issues," he said.
Casper admitted, however,
that there will be costs involved
with implementing this recom
mendation, as well as many of the
commission's other proposals.
"Since we are still in the bud
get-cutting mode and have to cut
another $12 million from the base
budget over the next two years, it
is quite clear that we cannot have
resources easily available,"
Casper said. "But for some of this,
I think, we may be able to do
fundraising."
He said the science core in par
ticular might be attractive to out
side donors.
Casper created the commission
in April 1993 to re-examine virtu
ally every facet of Stanford's
undergraduate experience — the
first such undertaking at the Uni
versity in nearly a quarter of a
century.
Other commission recommen
dations include creating the posi
tion of vice provost of undergrad
uate education and strengthening
Stanford's writing and language
requirements.
