# Prof. Manley's view of indirect-costs is flawed
## 
### 
Professor John Manley (letter to
the editor, Oct. 21) has a really inter
esting concept of justice: Stanford is
guilty as charged until proven inno
cent, and then after being found inno
cent it's still guilty.
Stanford, following detailed and
complex government rules and good
faith agreements, applied for and col
lected $734 million in reimbursement
from the Federal government during

the period 1981 to 1992, for monies it
had spent on the indirect costs of
research. The final settlement in effect
disallowed $1.2 million of those charges
for the entire 12-year period.
Let's look at this from a personal
perspective. Suppose Professor Man
ley claims a grand total of $73,400 in
itemized deductions on his personal
tax returns over a 12-year period, all
of which he believes to be in compli
ance with complex Internal Revenue
Service rules.
A headline-seeking member of
Congress, aided by a disgruntled for
mer graduate student, then voices
wildly exaggerated [and highly public]
charges that more than $20,000 of his
deductions were illegal and dishonest.
Dozens of IRS auditors and lawyers
descend on him, auditing every line of
his tax returns for the past 12 years.
Two years later, however, they explic
itly agree they can find no evidence of
any fraud or wrongdoing on his part
— the most they can disallow from
his deductions is $120 for the entire
time.
Professor Manley would probably
be happy about this settlement, as
Stanford is happy about its own —
except of course for being out an
immense amount of time and money,

and having been falsely portrayed to
his colleagues and all the rest of the
world as a tax cheat.
