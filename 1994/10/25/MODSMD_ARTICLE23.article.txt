## The 						false gender dichotomy 
### 
THE TOPIC OF gender differences
seems to be extremely popular in
recent socio-anthropological litera
ture. As innocuous and even progressive
as the theme seems, I have been dis
turbed and somewhat offended by the
tone that some proponents of gender-dif
ference theory employ in their presenta
tion.
Two examples bear this out. Earlier this
quarter, I attended a lecture at the School
of Medicine titled "Feminine Aspects of
Healing." Upon hearing the title, I was
immediately confused by what appeared to
be a vast generalization, but I reserved
judgment for post-lecture reflection. As it
turned out, my fears had been justified.
£he talk basically associated certain laud
able traits, such as sensuality and spiritu
alism, with "women of the healing arts."
Why do I qualify that statement with
"basically?" Thankfully, the lecturer was
not so insensitive as to present the issue
in black and white terms. At several
points, she mentioned that "she didn't
mean to offend the men in the audience."
She knew that some of us men were also
gifted with "feminine aspects of healing."
But the damage was done. Her apologet
ic tone and her parenthetical reference to
the fact that this was an overt generaliza
tion were insufficient to justify the label.
The focus of the lecture resounded — there
are certain qualities that women possess
and offer as healers, which form the basis
for a bond among women in medicine. And,

oh yeah, some men might be lucky enough
to share a few of these qualities too.
Why do we feel compelled to create these
categorical references? Certainly, some men
have supported vast generalizations of their
role in medicine and life in general. Fortu
nately, we are beginning to realize how
ridiculous and unfair it is to say that men
possess superior qualities of leadership or
intellect, for example. The avalanche of
exceptions to any such statement renders it
counter-productive, even if it could be
proven statistically true [which it cannot].
My second example of this phe
nomenon is the tremendously popular
book "You Just Don't Understand", by
Deborah Tannen. This book, subtitled
"Women and Men in Conversation,"
spends 300 pages outlining the differ
ences between men's and women's
means of communication. Page 16 of the
preface includes the following disclaimer:
"Generalizations, while capturing simi
larities, obscure differences. . .Despite
these dangers, I am joining the growing
dialogue on gender and language because
the risk of ignoring [gender] differences
is greater than the danger of naming
them." How do we know which differ
ences — individual or group — are more
dangerous to ignore? The entire book is
packed with generalities that
dichotomize the genders, the danger of
which itself is ignored. Forgetting her
earlier admission that gender issues are
far from black and white, the author

seems obsessed with finding contrast.
While these two examples may not pro
vide a broad sample of public opinion,
they are sufficiently mainstream to war
rant concern. Of course they were never
intended to engender further polarization
of gender perception, but they do. The
recognition of vast exceptions to any gen
der categorization is so faint that it mocks
the reality of the unique individual. What
should we think as academics and public
figures preach differences between the
sexes? Are similarities between the sexes
too obvious to note? Are the immense dif
ferences between individuals of the same
sex not infinitely more significant?
Look around yon. Attempts to find
support for these blanket statements
inevitably end in frustration. The list of
qualifiers becomes absurd: "Well, gener
ally, men are like this and that, but, but,
but. . .Women are mostly this and that
except, except, except .. . Are we will
ing to take the time to discover the com
plex similarities and differences among
us, or will we lazily rely on broad general
izations, apologizing for their inadequa
cies? If we choose the latter, the person
offended may be you.

Chris Carlsten would like Naomi Wolf to
receive a copy of this column as well.
