# Food Service initiates student focus groups
## 
### Jennifer Rosen Staff writer 
Food Service will be asking students to
analyze the way they are fed — and paying
them for it.
To accumulate ideas for improvement,
Food Service will hold a series of one-hour
focus groups from Nov. 3 to Nov. 8 looking at
a variety of issues surrounding meal plans,
pricing and services.
Through direct student input, Food Ser
vice will analyze all aspects of its operation,
said Shirley Everett, associate director of
Housing and Dining Services. This will be the
third year Food Service has sponsored the ses
sions.
The focus groups — open to all students on
a University meal plan, as well as all Resident
Fellows — propose to "improve the quality of
the food service program as students, our pri
mary customers, perceive it. We want to see
improvements made," said Keith Guy, direc

tor of Housing and Dining Services.
The focus groups are part of a research pro
ject conducted by Food Service to gather data
and systematically enhance the quality of its
program for all concerned, Everett said.
Students can sign up to join a focus group
with their cashier, and Food Service will com
pensate them $10 for their time. "It's a com
mon practice to pay students for participating
in a research project," Guy said.
Improvements, including increased vege
tarian options and the 12 meals plus points
plan, were originally suggested in focus
groups over the past two years, she said.
Food Service first formulates questions in
conjunction with RFs and interested stu
dents, she said. The questions will then be
presented to the focus group participants,
who give feedback on all issues.
Although students have responded nega
tively to Food Service in past years, Everett
said she hopes to alter perceptions of her
office through her proactive stance and dedi

cation to working with students to provide
them with the most value for their meal plan.
Everett added that she believes focus
groups will prompt students to articulate
their long-range goals regarding Food Service
in a comprehensive manner. Food Service will
analyze information acquired through the
focus group process to discover what is work
ing well and what could be changed, she said.
"We are committed to making sure we offer
a quality service program,'' she said. "We are
trying to satisfy a large number of people from
all over the world — it's a big challenge."
"We want students to give us good infor
mation, help us to gauge our position, move in
the right direction and make strategic
changes," Everett added. "We plan to use
information from students in a positive way."
Focus groups will consist of 10 students led
by consultants from outside Firms, making it
easier for students to voice their concerns. In
past years, although many people have signed
up, few have attended the focus groups.
