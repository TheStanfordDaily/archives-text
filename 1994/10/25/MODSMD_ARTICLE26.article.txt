## Kickers climb Face USF after upset 
### Joseph Hei Staff writer 
Maloney Field is the site where Stanford men's
soccer dealt No. 4 Fresno State a stunning 1-0 upset
last week.
Stanford will be on home turf again today taking
on cross-town rival University of San Francisco, and
the Dons will not see a welcome mat in front of the
Cardinal's house.
"It's a natural rivalry," said sophomore goalkeep
er Ryan Craig.
Both the Cardinal (4-9-2) and the Dons (5-6-2)
are in this season. The Dons
entered this year with high expectations after doing
very well last season in battling all the way to the
final-16 round of the NCAA tournament. However,
these expectations have been tempered by a string of
losses early in the season and a disappointing record
overall. Also, the Dons have lost many of their
starters to injuries this season.
Stanford is no stranger to the jinx of injuries
either. Key players such as senior midfielder Ryan
Collins, junior midfielder/forward Steve
Kirschbaum, freshman midfielder/forward Justin
Leßlanc, junior forward Carmen D'Onofrio and
freshman midfielder Daniel Wytock have all had
their seasons cut short.
The Cardinal also had high expectations for the
year after a six-game winning streak last season
launched it into the post-season playoffs. However,
Stanford's game did not really gel until Mountain
Division play started. The Cardinal currently holds
a 3-1-1 record in the division.
The Dons are led by Staale Soebye, who has 11
goals and 30 points so far this season. Chris McDon
ald is not far behind with seven goals and 15 points.
The Cardinal features standout freshman midfield
er Eric Vandevelde and D'Onofrio, who each have
five goals for the season.
"We do get pumped about this game," Craig said,
"but [the University of San Francisco] isn't in our
division, so it doesn't affect our chances in the divi
sion."
Despite the fact that this game will not directly
influence the Cardinal's post-season outlook, Stan

ford will use it as an opportunity
to demonstrate the level of play it
can maintain after blanking the
Bulldogs.
"I'm very interested in how we
play," said head coach Colin Lin
dores.
Considering Stanford's thinning
lineup, the team will also be very
interested in keeping the rest of its
lineup healthy versus the Dons.
"One of my main goals for the
rest of the season is to not have
any more injuries," Lindores said.
Even though the starting line
up for the Cardinal now is almost
completely different from the one
fielded at the beginning of the sea
son, Stanford has still managed to
edge out big wins.
"Our conference games are
more important," Lindores said,
"but it is going to be a very attrac
tive game because of their style of
play; [USF] is not a 'rock-em,'
punch it out kind of team."
