# Deep thoughts...
## Wolfe and sports? 
### 
Virginia Wolfe. You heard
me. In just the first four
weeks of this school year,
my co-editor Allyson and I have
thrown out columns on just
about anything with a remote
connection to sports — sports
journalism, the San Diego
Padres, chess (lack of connection
with athletics in this case) and
pick-up hoops.
This week, it's a Virginia
Wolfe theme.
You see, it's my turn to write
the column, and I just couldn't
come up with one idea I was
happy with. Sure, I know a lot
about pro and collegiate sports,
but I always thought that
columns about such matters
were, in a word, stupid. Even the
funny ones that pick on a partic
ular team or player. You see, I go
to school here, my horrid mug
shot is right in front of you, and
the last thing I want is for an
offensive lineman to show me
how well he can down-block.

You see how my thought drift
ed from Virginia Wolfe in that
last paragraph? But that's the
whole point of Virginia Wolfe —
free-floating thought! So, this
week, I decided to just show you
how my mind wandered into (out
of, and around) different realms
of sports topics when I tried to
pick a subject to write on for
today.
The first thing I dreamed up
stemmed from my distress about
Stanford not netting a good yield
of the students it admitted. I


Sam Wu
wondered what would happen if
professors recruited students like
our coaches recruited our nation
al championship-caliber athletes.
Well, I'm sure that CIV wouldn't
net the nation's finest.
Then my mind really warped. I
started thinking about the NBA
draft and how undergrad and
graduate admissions could be
done on a semi-lottery system. I
pictured it on ESPN.
"With the first pick in the
1996 collegiate draft, Stanford
University selects. . .Packard
Hewlett from Lakeside School."
But then it got scary — a two
year, computer science and electri
cal engineering contract for a whop
ping $5.7 billion, only to be turned
down by Hewlett's agent, who
demands a cool $3 billion for the
first year and eligibility to go for free
agency in sophomore year. Stanford
;igrees, Hewlett plays (studies) well
his first year, but then he's sent off
to Hahvahd in a blockbuster trade
for two 1998 first-round picks.
My next thought was about those
curious individuals who play cricket
on Wilbur Field every Saturday. Ah!
What a great sport — even better if I
could figure out what the heck is
going on. Something about bowlers
and lots and lots of "overs." Whatev
er. It has more action than baseball,
and its players don't go on strike.
Therefore it's a better sport, even if it
isn't American's past-time, so there
wasn't much to talk about here. Pak
istan for three-peat! Rule Britannia!
Third thought — censored.
Fourth idea — how athletes'
names tend to foretell their perfor
mance. Think about this one. When
was the last time you heard, "This
year's MVP is ... Joe Smith (I take
this time to apologize to all fans of
Terrapin basketball)." For example,
Ethan Allan is a solid runner, but
let's compare him to, say, Heisman
candidate Napoleon Kaufman of
Washington. Ethan Allan is a furni
ture store where I come from.
Napoleon? Read the name!
Napoleon! That name says to me,
"I'm gonna kick your a**!"
And then, I thought. . .

When Sam's mind isn't trapped
in a funk of free association, he is
diligently studying for his bio
midterm.
