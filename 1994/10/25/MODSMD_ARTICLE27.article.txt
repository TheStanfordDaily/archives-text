# Deep thoughts...
## Wolfe and sports? 
### 
Virginia Wolfe. You heard
me. In just the first four
weeks of this school year,
my co-editor Allyson and I have
thrown out columns on just
about anything with a remote
connection to sports — sports
journalism, the San Diego
Padres, chess (lack of connection
with athletics in this case) and
pick-up hoops.
This week, it's a Virginia
Wolfe theme.
You see, it's my turn to write
the column, and I just couldn't
come up with one idea I was
happy with. Sure, I know a lot
about pro and collegiate sports,
but I always thought that
columns about such matters
were, in a word, stupid. Even the
funny ones that pick on a partic
ular team or player. You see, I go
to school here, my horrid mug
shot is right in front of you, and
the last thing I want is for an
offensive lineman to show me
how well he can down-block.

You see how my thought drift
ed from Virginia Wolfe in that
last paragraph? But that's the
whole point of Virginia Wolfe —
free-floating thought! So, this
week, I decided to just show you
how my mind wandered into (out
of, and around) different realms
of sports topics when I tried to
pick a subject to write on for
today.
The first thing I dreamed up
stemmed from my distress about
Stanford not netting a good yield
of the students it admitted. I
