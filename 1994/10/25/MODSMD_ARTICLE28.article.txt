After losing its last two
games, the Cardinal field hock
ey team righted itself in the
California Invitational by
crushing UC-Davis, 3-0, on Sat
urday and tying Simon Fraser
College, 0-0, on Sunday.
"We played really well," said
head coach Sheryl Johnson.
"We had intensity throughout
[the game against Simon Fras
er]. We played better as a
team."
The Cardinal (6-7-1) domi
nated the first half against
Simon Fraser, keeping posses
sion of the ball while taking
numerous shots.
"Our passing was excellent,"
said midfielder Tina Syer. "We
were connecting really well."
But midway through the
half, the officials awarded the
opponent a penalty stroke after
a Simon Fraser forward drib

bled down toward freshman
goalie Kelly Naylor and lost
control of the ball. Naylor
closed in on the forward and
apparently obstructed the for
ward from getting to the ball.
On the penalty stroke, the
forward shot to Naylor's left.
Naylor split her legs and
knocked the ball away with her
left leg. "I was nervous but I'm
really confident against penalty
strokes," said Naylor.
Although the Cardinal domi
nated the match up to that
point, the game could have
turned if Simon Fraser had
scored on the penalty, Johnson
said. "[Naylor] made a great
save," she said. "She was quick
to react and it saved the game.
It sparked us on the attack for
the rest of the half."
Stanford took multiple shots
but was unable to score in reg
ulation or the 10 minute over
time period because of the play
of the Simon Fraser goalie, who
"just blocked everything,"
Johnson added.
"We had a lot of opportuni
ties," said Syer. "I just wish we
could have finished better."
Stanford did finish its shots
on its way to a victory over UC-
Davis the day before in the
team's first game of the invita
tional. The Cardinal also
destroyed the Aggies, 5-1, in
their first game of the year on
