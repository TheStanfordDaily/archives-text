## Close finishes at home invite 
### Daniel Kao Contributing writer 
The scoreboard never lies, but
it doesn't always tell the whole
truth.
Such was the case this week
end at the Stanford Invitational
where the Cardinal sailing team
finished second by two points to
USC. Stanford wasn't lined up
initially to win and entered the
contest with a few other goals in
mind, many of which were
achieved.
"We always come out to win,"
said coach Steve Bourdow. "But I
wanted to change things up this
time and make the regatta differ
ent. I wanted to make it tougher
for our top sailors by forcing
them to compete in a deeper pool
of competition. A lot of that com
petition came from within the
team."
Bourdow had decided to stack
the line-up by placing all of the
top sailors in the A-Division
instead of balancing them out by
placing some in the B-Division.
After this change, the competi
tion the Trojans met in the B-
Division was diminished consid
erably, thereby helping them win
the regatta, which featured eight
teams from the west coast.
"I know I probably put the
team at a disadvantage by stack
ing the divisions, but we still
could've won," Bourdow said. "I
also wanted to give the B-Division
sailors a chance to play a role.
Unfortunately, some mistakes
were made, and the Southern Cal
sailors just tore through the B-
Division to make up a lot of

ground."
Light conditions on both days
decreased some of the advantage
that the Cardinal may have oth
erwise benefited from. Under
normal wind conditions, Stanford
has the propensity to immediate
ly begin to roll. The lighter winds
made this action more difficult,
but the team still performed
extremely effectively.
The Stanford sailors exhibited
sheer dominance in the A-Divi
sion, placing in six out of the top
seven spots including the top two.
The team of junior skipper Adam
Lowry and freshman crew Mara
Holian finished four points ahead
of the duo consisting of senior
skipper Charles Meade and fresh
man Betsy Carmichael.
"Coach Bourdow decided to
load up all the best sailors in one
division to see how well they do
against each other," Lowry said.
"Likewise, he wanted the sailors
in B-Division to sail against com
parable competition too."
The Cardinal also delivered an
impressive show in the B-Divi
sion, where Stanford held five of
the top eight slots. The highest
Cardinal finisher was the third
place team of junior skipper Cin
namon Hampikian and freshman
crew Abigail Kramer.
After the first day of the
Invite, which featured Flying
Junior boats, two Stanford ships
progressed to the head of the
pack. The competition eventually
caught up to them, however, as
the Trojans ended up finishing
first. Cardinal sailors still held six
out of the top nine positions in
the final standings.
"If we had our best teams lined
up normally, I know we would've
won," Lowry said. "We still sailed
well, and it's impressive to me
that we still almost won."
Even without the victory, the
Cardinal felt it gained through
the experience. Lowry used the
word "gauge" to describe the
regatta, and Bourdow also noted
that the entire team now will
have a good measure by which
they can rank the sailors on the
team in respect to each other and
foes from other schools.
Sophomore skipper Alice Man
ard, who finished eighth this week
end at the Singlehanded Nationals
hosted by the Massachusetts Insti
tute of Technology, is still trying to
look for whatever "good things"
that might have come out of her
disappointing finish.
Manard competed in a very
tough regatta of 14 schools that
turned out to be a little deeper
than expected. Favorite Danielle

Brennan of St. Mary's still
emerged victorious, but not with
out stiff competition from a Tufts
combination of Laura Dunn and
Katie McDowell.
"I just didn't adjust as well as a
lot of the other sailors, even
though the competition and the
conditions were pretty much
what I expected." Manard said.
The first day of racing had its
ups and downs, but it wasn't until
Saturday that Manard found her
self in a hole she couldn't sail out of.
"Alice had a real tough time
getting a rhythm established,"
Bourdow said. "She pushed hard
er and tried to refocus her plan.
She took some risks but they
didn't really pay off."
It was all the more difficult on
Sunday, when Manard found her
self essentially out of the run
ning. Even without a top finish,
Manard proved her tenacity
amongst some stiff competition.
"If there is anything positive to
come out of this, it's that Alice
was able to come back and sail
well the last day of the regatta,"
Bourdow said. "In the past, she's
always had trouble bouncing
back, but this time she was able
to."

against each other," Lowry said.
"Likewise, he wanted the sailors
in B-Division to sail against com
parable competition too."
The Cardinal also delivered an
impressive show in the B-Divi
sion, where Stanford held five of
the top eight slots. The highest
Cardinal finisher was the third
place team of junior skipper Cin
namon Hampikian and freshman
crew Abigail Kramer.
After the first day of the
Invite, which featured Flying
Junior boats, two Stanford ships
progressed to the head of the
pack. The competition eventually
caught up to them, however, as
the Trojans ended up finishing
first. Cardinal sailors still held six
out of the top nine positions in
the final standings.
"If we had our best teams lined
up normally, I know we would've
won," Lowry said. "We still sailed
well, and it's impressive to me
that we still almost won."
Even without the victory, the
Cardinal felt it gained through
the experience. Lowry used the
word "gauge" to describe the
regatta, and Bourdow also noted
that the entire team now will
have a good measure by which
they can rank the sailors on the
team in respect to each other and
foes from other schools.
Sophomore skipper Alice Man
ard, who finished eighth this week
end at the Singlehanded Nationals
hosted by the Massachusetts Insti
tute of Technology, is still trying to
look for whatever "good things"
that might have come out of her
disappointing finish.
Manard competed in a very
tough regatta of 14 schools that
turned out to be a little deeper
than expected. Favorite Danielle

Brennan of St. Mary's still
emerged victorious, but not with
out stiff competition from a Tufts
combination of Laura Dunn and
Katie McDowell.
"I just didn't adjust as well as a
lot of the other sailors, even
though the competition and the
conditions were pretty much
what I expected." Manard said.
The first day of racing had its
ups and downs, but it wasn't until
Saturday that Manard found her
self in a hole she couldn't sail out of.
"Alice had a real tough time
getting a rhythm established,"
Bourdow said. "She pushed hard
er and tried to refocus her plan.
She took some risks but they
didn't really pay off."
It was all the more difficult on
Sunday, when Manard found her
self essentially out of the run
ning. Even without a top finish,
Manard proved her tenacity
amongst some stiff competition.
"If there is anything positive to
come out of this, it's that Alice
was able to come back and sail
well the last day of the regatta,"
Bourdow said. "In the past, she's
always had trouble bouncing
back, but this time she was able
to."
