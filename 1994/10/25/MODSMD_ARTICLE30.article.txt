# No. 1 cyclers continue winning tradition
## 
### Ben Hur 
While it may only qualify as a club sport,
the Stanford cycling team has definitely
made its presence known across the country.
Top pedaling performances by David Bai
ley, Dario Falquier, Bettina Romer and
standout freshman Margot QuanHt, helped
Stanford's club cyclists ascend to the height
of their sport at the Track Nationals in
Trexlertown, Penn.
The team placed third and improved its
overall ranking to No. 1 in the NCAA com
bined road/track/mountain bike national
ranking system. Quandt won the Points
Race, and along with Romer earned Ail-
American recognition from the NCAA.
The Sept. 9-11 national race featured all
of the top schools in the country, including

former No. 1 Marian College and Stanford
rival California. Indiana won the Track
Nationals, but remains well behind the Car
dinal in the overall rankings.
"I thought it would take the [Cardinal]
club one more year to reach the echelon of
track schools, but to the credit of all, they
achieved that level in 1994," said Stanford
coach Art Walker.
The team also did well at the Mountain
Bike Nationals, held on the first of October
in Castaic, Calif. The team was led by Mike
Cummers, who won the men's B-division
race, finishing the 13.5 mile course in just
under an hour.
"Historically, we haven't had many moun
tain bikers and we knew we would have a
small team, so we wanted to field a team that
would maintain our No. 1 ranking. That was

our goal," Cummers said .
The club placed sixth, but along with its
third place finish at Track Nationals and its
second place finish at Road Nationals earlier
in the year, Stanford still beat out second
ranked Cal for the National Championship.
Stanford cycling began almost 20 years
ago when it became one of the founders of
the WCCC (Western Collegiate Cycling Con
ference). Since then, the Cardinal team has
developed into a national powerhouse, plac
ing among the top six schools at Collegiate
Nationals in each of the last six years, includ
ing a number-one finish in 1994.
Many former Stanford team members
have become national-class United States
Cycling Federation (UCSF) racers, including
former national champions
Katrin Tobin, Liz Chapman and
Russell Meade, along with former
Olympian Dave 8011.
These achievements appear
even more impressive consider
ing that cycling at Stanford is a
club sport, managed by students
and mainly funded through the
efforts of the athletes and their
title sponsorship with Wheel
smith Bicycle Shop. Other
schools, including highly ranked
Marian College, merit varsity sta
tus to cycling, recruit top riders
and offer athletic scholarships.
Rather than a race among
individuals, collegiate cycling is
a competition among teams
composed of both men and
women. At each race, riders
compete in six different cate
gories (four for men, two for
women). Riders who place well
score points for their respective
teams. The number of points
available in each category is
scaled so that the most points
can be won in the most competi
tive races. With the men's and
women's categories combining
for the team ranking, excellence
is not possible without a bal

anced program.
Any student seriously interest
ed in becoming involved in Stan
ford's cycling club is welcome.
Prospective riders who would like
to join the club for training rides
in the Santa Cruz mountains, just
a 20 minute bike ride from cam
pus, can enjoy picturesque
scenery while getting into shape.

Anyone who trains
and does the pro
gram can compete.'
— Art Walker

According to coach Walker,
"anyone who trains and does the
program can compete." He also
acknowledges that the team has
not expanded to the point where
performance is a criterion for
membership.
Walker challenged Stanford
students to show their athletic
prowess and become a part of the
rich cycling club tradition. Both
men and women are encouraged
to come out and join, but women
in particular have an excellent
chance of making an impact due
to the lack of depth in the
women's division.
