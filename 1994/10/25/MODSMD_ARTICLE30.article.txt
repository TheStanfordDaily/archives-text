While it may only qualify as a club sport,
the Stanford cycling team has definitely
made its presence known across the country.
Top pedaling performances by David Bai
ley, Dario Falquier, Bettina Romer and
standout freshman Margot QuanHt, helped
Stanford's club cyclists ascend to the height
of their sport at the Track Nationals in
Trexlertown, Penn.
The team placed third and improved its
overall ranking to No. 1 in the NCAA com
bined road/track/mountain bike national
ranking system. Quandt won the Points
Race, and along with Romer earned Ail-
American recognition from the NCAA.
The Sept. 9-11 national race featured all
of the top schools in the country, including

former No. 1 Marian College and Stanford
rival California. Indiana won the Track
Nationals, but remains well behind the Car
dinal in the overall rankings.
"I thought it would take the [Cardinal]
club one more year to reach the echelon of
track schools, but to the credit of all, they
achieved that level in 1994," said Stanford
coach Art Walker.
The team also did well at the Mountain
Bike Nationals, held on the first of October
in Castaic, Calif. The team was led by Mike
Cummers, who won the men's B-division
race, finishing the 13.5 mile course in just
under an hour.
"Historically, we haven't had many moun
tain bikers and we knew we would have a
small team, so we wanted to field a team that
would maintain our No. 1 ranking. That was

our goal," Cummers said .
The club placed sixth, but along with its
third place finish at Track Nationals and its
second place finish at Road Nationals earlier
in the year, Stanford still beat out second
ranked Cal for the National Championship.
Stanford cycling began almost 20 years
ago when it became one of the founders of
the WCCC (Western Collegiate Cycling Con
ference). Since then, the Cardinal team has
developed into a national powerhouse, plac
ing among the top six schools at Collegiate
Nationals in each of the last six years, includ
ing a number-one finish in 1994.
Many former Stanford team members
have become national-class United States
Cycling Federation (UCSF) racers, including
