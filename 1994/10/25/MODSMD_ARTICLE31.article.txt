# Shuer an inspiration in class, on water
##

The ancient Greeks liked to say
that their students were of sound
mind and sound body. In this age
of high-profile athletics, Stanford
can claim to be one of the few uni
versities in the country where
this maxim of the scholar-athlete
still rings true. And Marjorie
Shuer might be its best example.
You're not likely to find Shuer
at Stern for Late Night Pizza or
on the dance floor at the next Phi
Delta Theta party. But you might
want to try the new Psychiatry
and Behavioral Sciences building
on Quarry Road, where Shuer is
finishing her five years of residen

cy in psychiatry.
Shuer is no ordinary resident,
however. For one, she has
received an M.D. from the Uni
versity of Texas School of
Medicine. This complements her
B.A. in psychology from Stanford,
her M.A. in exercise physiology
from the University of Michigan,
and her D.P.M. in Pediatric
Medicine and Surgery from the
California College of Pediatric
Medicine.
This past month Shuer took
time out from her residency to
travel to Brisbane, Australia. A
well-needed respite from the
pressures of academia? Hardly.
She went Down Under to com

pete in the World Masters
Games, an international
Olympic-style competition for
those considered "a little past
their prime."
Walking the venues of the
Games one could see former track
stars and ex-champion divers. All
these athletes were indeed great
in their respective sports. But
Shuer, although her modesty
would not let her, could lay claim
to the distinction of the Games'
best athlete.
Shuer competed in the swim
ming competition during the first
week. Unfortunately, after being
highly seeded, a case of the flu
pushed her into an eighth place

finish in the 200 backstroke and a
lOth-place showing in the 50
back. After reluctantly taking the
advice of an Australian physician,
she withdrew from her final
event.
But Shuer wasn't finished.
After recovering for a few days,
she set out to the water again,
although this time she wasn't
wearing her lyrca swim suit.
Instead she carried a paddle. She
kayaked her way to a fourth place
finish in the 1000 meters and a
sixth place in the 500.
Then, in one of the great thrills
of her athletic career, she teamed
with two German women in their
early 50's and a Russian woman
in her mid 60's to finish third in
the Ladies K-4 competition, a race
open to all those over 30.
"They needed a fourth, and I
jumped eagerly at the opportuni
ty," says Shuer. "These women
dominated the kayaking in the
'60s, taking home all sorts of
Olympic medals in the process.
For them to ask me to kayak with
them was a high honor."
In today's athletic world where
it pays to specialize, only a select
few can compete in more than one
sport at the highest level. Is
Shuer an under appreciated
Deion Sanders?
"It was tough for me to make a
total commitment to one sport,"
she says.
"I always loved to swim, and I
found the sport of kayaking at a
swim camp in Canada when I was
15. They are both such beautiful
sports. I just couldn't give one of
them up. I've never been one of
those to put all my eggß in one
basket."
Her basket, of sorts, is filled
with activities. Just as important
as her kayaking, swimming and
residency, she says, is her job as
educator. At Stanford, she teach
es Biopsychosocial Aspects of
Sports (Human Biology 140),

Marjorie Shuer, in her fifth year of residency at Stanford and teaching Hum Bio, kayaked and swam her
way to numerous victories at the World Masters Games in Australia earlier this month.
