# Shuer an inspiration in class, on water
## 
### John Lawson 
The ancient Greeks liked to say
that their students were of sound
mind and sound body. In this age
of high-profile athletics, Stanford
can claim to be one of the few uni
versities in the country where
this maxim of the scholar-athlete
still rings true. And Marjorie
Shuer might be its best example.
You're not likely to find Shuer
at Stern for Late Night Pizza or
on the dance floor at the next Phi
Delta Theta party. But you might
want to try the new Psychiatry
and Behavioral Sciences building
on Quarry Road, where Shuer is
finishing her five years of residen

cy in psychiatry.
Shuer is no ordinary resident,
however. For one, she has
received an M.D. from the Uni
versity of Texas School of
Medicine. This complements her
B.A. in psychology from Stanford,
her M.A. in exercise physiology
from the University of Michigan,
and her D.P.M. in Pediatric
Medicine and Surgery from the
California College of Pediatric
Medicine.
This past month Shuer took
time out from her residency to
travel to Brisbane, Australia. A
well-needed respite from the
pressures of academia? Hardly.
She went Down Under to com

pete in the World Masters
Games, an international
Olympic-style competition for
those considered "a little past
their prime."
Walking the venues of the
Games one could see former track
stars and ex-champion divers. All
these athletes were indeed great
in their respective sports. But
Shuer, although her modesty
would not let her, could lay claim
to the distinction of the Games'
best athlete.
Shuer competed in the swim
ming competition during the first
week. Unfortunately, after being
highly seeded, a case of the flu
pushed her into an eighth place

finish in the 200 backstroke and a
lOth-place showing in the 50
back. After reluctantly taking the
advice of an Australian physician,
she withdrew from her final
event.
But Shuer wasn't finished.
After recovering for a few days,
she set out to the water again,
although this time she wasn't
wearing her lyrca swim suit.
Instead she carried a paddle. She
kayaked her way to a fourth place
finish in the 1000 meters and a
sixth place in the 500.
Then, in one of the great thrills
of her athletic career, she teamed
with two German women in their
early 50's and a Russian woman
in her mid 60's to finish third in
the Ladies K-4 competition, a race
open to all those over 30.
"They needed a fourth, and I
jumped eagerly at the opportuni
ty," says Shuer. "These women
dominated the kayaking in the
'60s, taking home all sorts of
Olympic medals in the process.
For them to ask me to kayak with
them was a high honor."
In today's athletic world where
it pays to specialize, only a select
few can compete in more than one
sport at the highest level. Is
Shuer an under appreciated
Deion Sanders?
"It was tough for me to make a
total commitment to one sport,"
she says.
"I always loved to swim, and I
found the sport of kayaking at a
swim camp in Canada when I was
15. They are both such beautiful
sports. I just couldn't give one of
them up. I've never been one of
those to put all my eggß in one
basket."
Her basket, of sorts, is filled
with activities. Just as important
as her kayaking, swimming and
residency, she says, is her job as
educator. At Stanford, she teach

Sports (Human Biology 140),

undergrad in the early '70s. A mem

Although Shuer wjis one of t he let

never reach her full potential.
"The women's budget was
$3,500 and the men's was $1.5
million," said Shuer. "The director
of female athletics did not believe

in competition for the women.
Some of the best swimmers did not
join the team because women's
swimming was taught like a P.E.
class. It seems almost silly now,
but it was very real back then."

opportunities (and equal budget

Athletic Career" (in which former
NBA star World B. Free spoke) and

"Often, we think that athletes

they have special needs just like

address those needs," she said.

pressures of academia? Hardly.
She went Down Under to com

pete in the World Masters
Games, an international
Olympic-style competition for
those considered "a little past
their prime."
Walking the venues of the
Games one could see former track
stars and ex-champion divers. All
these athletes were indeed great
in their respective sports. But
Shuer, although her modesty
would not let her, could lay claim
to the distinction of the Games'
best athlete.
Shuer competed in the swim
ming competition during the first
week. Unfortunately, after being
highly seeded, a case of the flu
pushed her into an eighth place

finish in the 200 backstroke and a
lOth-place showing in the 50
back. After reluctantly taking the
advice of an Australian physician,
she withdrew from her final
event.
But Shuer wasn't finished.
After recovering for a few days,
she set out to the water again,
although this time she wasn't
wearing her lyrca swim suit.
Instead she carried a paddle. She
kayaked her way to a fourth place
finish in the 1000 meters and a
sixth place in the 500.
Then, in one of the great thrills
of her athletic career, she teamed
with two German women in their
early 50's and a Russian woman
in her mid 60's to finish third in
the Ladies K-4 competition, a race
open to all those over 30.
"They needed a fourth, and I
jumped eagerly at the opportuni
ty," says Shuer. "These women
dominated the kayaking in the
'60s, taking home all sorts of
Olympic medals in the process.
For them to ask me to kayak with
them was a high honor."
In today's athletic world where
it pays to specialize, only a select
few can compete in more than one
sport at the highest level. Is
Shuer an under appreciated
Deion Sanders?
"It was tough for me to make a
total commitment to one sport,"
she says.
"I always loved to swim, and I
found the sport of kayaking at a
swim camp in Canada when I was
15. They are both such beautiful
sports. I just couldn't give one of
them up. I've never been one of
those to put all my eggß in one
basket."
Her basket, of sorts, is filled
with activities. Just as important
as her kayaking, swimming and
residency, she says, is her job as
educator. At Stanford, she teach
es Biopsychosocial Aspects of
Sports (Human Biology 140),

of women in all aspects of life.

crimination first-hand as a Stanford
undergrad in the early '70s. A mem

Although Shuer wjis one of t he let

never reach her full potential.
"The women's budget was
$3,500 and the men's was $1.5
million," said Shuer. "The director
of female athletics did not believe

in competition for the women.
Some of the best swimmers did not
join the team because women's
swimming was taught like a P.E.
class. It seems almost silly now,
but it was very real back then."
The year Shuer graduated, Title
IX passed, which allowed for equal
opportunities (and equal budget
ing) for women in athletics.
Although the coaching of

women's athletics was not what it
should have been during Shuer's
undergraduate days, the academ
ic teaching was.
"Stanford's faculty was fantas
tic; they were open, honest, and
eager to interact with students.
That's what I love about aca
demics and athletics: the chance
to interact with influential peo
ple," she said.

As a student and an educator in
the field of sports psychiatry, Shuer
looks into ways to help the athlete
deal with problems that occur off
the field. year, she lectured the
students of Psychology 170 on
anabolic steroid abuse and spoke to
Stanford's Child Psychiatry and
Sports Medicine departments on
the psychology of injury and reha
bilitation. She has also directed

such symposiums as "Disengage
ment from Sport: The End of an
Athletic Career" (in which former
NBA star World B. Free spoke) and
"Mental Health Characteristics of
the Elite Athlete."
"Often, we think that athletes
don't have any problems. But
they have special needs just like
the rest of society. I'm working to
address those needs," she said.
The ancient Greeks liked to say
that their students were of sound
mind and sound body. In this age
of high-profile athletics, Stanford
can claim to be one of the few uni
versities in the country where
this maxim of the scholar-athlete
still rings true. And Marjorie
Shuer might be its best example.
You're not likely to find Shuer
at Stern for Late Night Pizza or
on the dance floor at the next Phi
Delta Theta party. But you might
want to try the new Psychiatry
and Behavioral Sciences building
on Quarry Road, where Shuer is
finishing her five years of residen

cy in psychiatry.
Shuer is no ordinary resident,
however. For one, she has
received an M.D. from the Uni
versity of Texas School of
Medicine. This complements her
B.A. in psychology from Stanford,
her M.A. in exercise physiology
from the University of Michigan,
and her D.P.M. in Pediatric
Medicine and Surgery from the
California College of Pediatric
Medicine.
This past month Shuer took
time out from her residency to
travel to Brisbane, Australia. A
well-needed respite from the
pressures of academia? Hardly.
