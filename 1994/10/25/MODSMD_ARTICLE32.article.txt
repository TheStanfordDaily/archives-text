# Schlukebir shines at All-Americans

Even though it's only autumn, one mem
ber of the Stanford women's tennis team
has already started swinging in preparation
for the spring season.
Sophomore All-American Katie Schluke
bir won four consecutive matches in the
Indoor Tennis Association All-American
Championships this weekend, her most sig
nificant victory coming in the finals of the
first-round consolation bracket. The tour
nament featured last year's All-Americans
and any other players who received high
preseason rankings.
Schlukebir entered the consolation brack
et after losing her first round match 3-6, 4-6
against Notre Dame's Wendy Crabtree.
"It was a typical first match of the sea
son. I played all right, not outstanding,"
said Schlukebir. Based on her limited tour
nament play throughout the summer, head
coach Frank Brennan agreed. "Crabtree
was just more ready," he said. "If Katie had
played her later in the tournament it would
have been no problem for her."
Schlukebir then turned her game up a
notch in the second round with a 3-6, 7-5,

6-1 triumph over Marie-Laure Bougnol of
Mississippi. She advanced again by beat
ing UCLA's Susie Starratt. Starratt had
to retire after losing the first set 6-4 due
to a hamstring injury.
Schlukebir then met Miko Hemsi-Ando
from California in the semifinals of the con
solation bracket, who she breezed by, 6-2,
6-0.

'I felt really strong by the last
set of the last match.'
— Katie Schlukebir

In the finals, Schlukebir defeated Terry
Ann Zawacki of Wake Forest University by
a score of 4-6, 6-3, 6-1 displaying her
strongest performance of the tournament.
"Every match I got better," Schlukebir
said. "I felt really strong by the last set of
the last match."
The level of performance Schlukebir dis
played throughout the tournament pleased
Brennan. "I thought she played just great,"
he said. "She got five matches and a lot of

sets, which is also great. We don't point to
this tournament as the NCAA Champi
onships."
Schlukebir also impressed Brennan with
the manner in which she competed.
"I like what she brings to the table,"
the coach said. "In both matches where
she lost the first set, she came back and
won the third 6-1. She really knows how
to compete. It's nice to have someone who
is both talented and coachable."
Schlukebir's consistent improvement
seemed all the more impressive considering
the modifications she made in her game.
She was definitely conscious of applying
these changes during the tournament.
"Going in, I had to work on approaching
the net more," Schlukebir said. "That's
what I'll have to do if I'm going to do well
this year against the top players."
As far as playing in the top spot for the
Cardinal this season, Brennan has yet to
determine if Schlukebir will get the nod.
"She has a leg up and I was very pleased,"
he said. "But we will have challenge match
es in practice, and that decision doesn't
have to be made for three more tourna
ments."
