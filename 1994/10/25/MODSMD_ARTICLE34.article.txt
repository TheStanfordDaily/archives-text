The Stanford ice hockey club team exploded
onto the ice this past weekend with two convinc
ing wins over the University of Oregon.
The team began its 1994 season on Friday
night by soundly defeating the Ducks, 8-2.
"(Oregon] came at us real hard in the first
game. They were playing really aggressive," said
team coach Ernie Ferrari.
Still, Stanford managed to score the first goal,
a stinging slapshot from the point by team cap
tain, Eric Haug, to teammate Shawn Sarbacker
who flipped the puck in the net after only three

and a half minutes of regulation play. Stanford
extended the lead with a second goal just one
and a half minutes later.
Other goals, made by senior Luke Winter and
graduates Shawn Sarbacker and Sean Morrison,
soon followed.
"I'm pleased that we won, and I think that
the team is showing a lot of potential," Ferrari
said. "We're very pleased with [freshman
goaliej Sami-Jo Small. She was like a wall in the
first period. She faced numerous great goal
scoring opportunities and many quality shots."
"I didn't really know what to expect Igoing
into Friday's game). The guys on my team real

ly tried to help me out," Small said.
Stanford took an early 3-0 lead during Satur
day night's game. One of the most exciting
moments of the contest came when Oregon had
a power-play advantage and junior Stefan Teitge
stole the puck at center ice, skated easily around
all of the Oregon players, and dumped the puck
into the net.
Stanford's toughest game should come on
Nov. 4, when Stanford challenges Arizona State
at home.
"Those should be excellent games," Ferrari
said. "I'm very excited about the rest of the sea
son."
