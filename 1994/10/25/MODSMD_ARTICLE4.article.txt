# Developing threat? If not Sand Hill, Foothills
## 
### Hudson Sangree 
Palo Alto officials have complained that
Stanford is using the foothills as a bargaining
chip in continuing discussions about the Uni
versity's proposed expansion along Sand Hill
Road.
" 'Gosh, wouldn't it be a shame if we had to
develop the Foothills,' " and other similar

statements have been made several times by
Stanford officials at informal meetings be
tween representatives of the city and the Uni
versity, said Palo Alto Mayor Liz Kniss.
"I wouldn't call it a threat. It's a sugges
tion," she added. "It's a motivator to think
twice about allowing increased density."
But Curtis Feeny, executive vice-president
for real estate at the Stanford Management

Company and a regular University representa
tive at the meetings, said he didn't recall mak
ing or hearing such statements.
"I can't imagine that anyone thinks that
there are any plans to develop the Foothills in
the near future," he said.
