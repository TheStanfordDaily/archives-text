# Developing threat? If not Sand Hill, Foothills
## 
### Hudson Sangree 
Palo Alto officials have complained that
Stanford is using the foothills as a bargaining
chip in continuing discussions about the Uni
versity's proposed expansion along Sand Hill
Road.
" 'Gosh, wouldn't it be a shame if we had to
develop the Foothills,' " and other similar

statements have been made several times by
Stanford officials at informal meetings be
tween representatives of the city and the Uni
versity, said Palo Alto Mayor Liz Kniss.
"I wouldn't call it a threat. It's a sugges
tion," she added. "It's a motivator to think
twice about allowing increased density."
But Curtis Feeny, executive vice-president
for real estate at the Stanford Management

Company and a regular University representa
tive at the meetings, said he didn't recall mak
ing or hearing such statements.
"I can't imagine that anyone thinks that
there are any plans to develop the Foothills in
the near future," he said.
The University's proposed Sand Hill Road
project would lengthen and
improve the road, expand the
Stanford Shopping Center and
the Medical Center, and con
struct new senior and family
housing along the road.
Because part of the expansion
would occur on Palo Alto land
and could increase traffic density
in the area, the city must approve
the project before it can proceed.
Feeny, University President Ger
hard Casper and University
Architect David Neuman have
attended meetings with the city
about the project.
"Stanford has been very good
and worked very hard to com
promise with Palo Alto" regard
ing the Sand Hill project, Kniss
said. But she added she feels
Stanford is dangling the fears of
Palo Alto residents about devel
opment in the foothills over the
city's head.
"Palo Altans are worried about
foothill development," Kniss said.
"We could be very persuaded to
allow increased density in already
developed areas if there was a pos
sibility that (the alternative was)
the foothills would be developed."
But Andy Coe, Stanford's
director of community relations,
said there is no plan to develop
the foothills.
"The foothills are a greatly val
ued resource," he said. "There is
no relation between the Sand Hill
project and the foothills."
"Stanford's planning has indi
cated no need to develop the

foothills in the next 20 years,"
said Ken Schreiber, director of
planning for Palo Alto.
But, "that possibility surfaces
periodically in discussions with
Stanford," Schreiber said. "From
the University's perspective, they
want to keep their options open.
If they feel unduly constrained in
the fiatlands, one of the options
they have to consider is develop
ment of the foothills."
Schreiber said if the Medical
Center were not allowed to
expand on Palo Alto land, the
University would consider using
areas along Welch Road which
are currently vacant or used as
parking lots.
These spaces are currently
designated for academic use, he
said. If they were used for Medi
cal Center expansion, then Stan
ford might be forced to consider
locating academic buildings in
the foothills, Schreiber suggest
ed.
Coe and Schreiber both
attribute speculation about the
development of the foothills to
concerns of area residents.
"Over the years there has been
fear from people in Palo Alto and
Menlo Park about developing the
foothills," Coe said.
Kniss represents Palo Alto res
idents who have had a "long
standing and deep-seated opposi
tion to significant development of
the foothills," Schreiber said.
Kniss acknowledged that
development of the foothills is of
great concern to Palo Alto resi
dents. "When Stanford starts
talking about development, peo
ple get very concerned in Palo
Alto," she said.
