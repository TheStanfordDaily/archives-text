## Two speak out on Bosnia crisis 
### Elizabeth Goldman 
Genocide continues in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and it
is the responsibility of Western countries to end the
horrors, two speakers told a gathering Monday night.
Zainab Salbi, founder of Women for Women in
Bosnia, and Mark Bartolini, a former officer of the In
ternational Rescue Committee, described conditions
in Bosnia to a group of about 30 people in Tresidder
Oak East and asked for support.
The forum on "Humanitarian Nightmare, Human
Hope: The Plight of Civilians in Bosnia-Herzegov
ina" was sponsored by Students Against Genocide
(SAGE), a group working for
relief in Bosnia.
Bosnians are trying to main
tain their dignity and their lives,
Salhi said. "But no matter how
hard they try to stay alive, they
are tired," she said. "They are
entering their third year."
Salbi, whose group aids Bosni
an women who have been victims
of rape, said between 20,000 and
100,000 women have been raped
since the beginning of the war.
Soldiers rape children as young as
four and women as old as 80, she
said.
Often, Salbi said, the rapes are
videotaped and shown to other
troops. "Rape in Bosnia is not
some individual act," she
explained. "It is considered a
patriotic duty."
Bosnians and Croats are also
guilty of rape, Salbi said, but not
to the same extent. "A lot of peo
ple say everyone is equal in the
blame," she said. "There is only
one side that is organizing rape
camps .. . and that is the Serbian
side."
The effects of the rapes stretch
beyond Serbian camps. Domestic
violence has increased in Serbia
because of soldiers who come
home from raping women and do
the same to their wives, Salbi
said.
Salbi accused the United
Nations forces of participating in
war crimes against women. "This
is not happening only against

Bosnian women," Salbi said. "It is
happening to all of us across the
world. . . . Rape camps are in
operation as we speak now. If we
allow the rape camps to keep
operating .. . who next?"
The Serbians are trying to
destroy more than the current
generation of Bosnians, Salbi
said.
"When the library was burned,
it was burning for three straight
days," she recalled from her visit
to Bosnia. "This is not only an
attempt to kill the civilians. This
is an attempt to kill their history
and culture as well."
The Bosnians fight back,
though, Bartolini said. He read a
section of his journal from his six
months in Bosnia that described a
midnight mass on Christmas Eve.
The cathedral "struck me as
not the safest place to be," he
said, "but it was televised. There
would be no massacres if CNN
was broadcasting live."
Bartolini also recalled a day
when he was trying to deliver a
package for a friend and couldn't
find the right apartment. A man
opened the door of one apartment
and"in the background, I could
see a woman playing cello," he
said. "I didn't know what she was
playing, but it sounded like a
requiem for Sarajevo."
Both Salbi and Bartolini con
demned Western inaction in
Bosnia.
"I'm both appalled and deeply
saddened by our failure to end
genocide in Bosnia," Bartolini
said.
He said President Clinton told
Americans during his election

campaign that history has
shown that governments cannot
let genocide go unchecked. "Yet
that is just what the Clinton
administration has done," Bar

tolini said.
The war has progressed so far
that someone must act, he said.
"It really is up to the United
States now."
