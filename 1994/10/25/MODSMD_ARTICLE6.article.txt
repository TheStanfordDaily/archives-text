## Organist duo plays, competes together 
### Solveig Pederson Staff writer 
Once solo artists, Stanford
organists David Yearsley and
Annette Richards are now a
duo, in more ways than one.
Yearsley and Richards —
who were married on Sept. 17 in
Portola Valley— won first prize
in duo performance in an Au
gust international organ festi
val held in Bruges, Belgium.
Yearsley, the acting Univer

sity organist for 1994-95, also
competed as a solo artist and
won first prize, in addition to
the audience prize, which is
voted on by audience members.
"It's very rare that the audi
ence and the jury both like the
same person," said Richards, a
doctorate student in music who
is on leave from her position as
assistant professor of music and
university organist at Cornell
University.

Stanford or
ganists An
nette Richards
and David
Yearsley, who
were married
last month,
won first prize
in duo perfor
mance in an in
ternational
organ festival
in Belgium.
The duo performed on two pos
itiv organs — small movable
instruments facing each other —
in rooms where they could hardly
hear because of the echo. The
competition lasted for eight stren
uous days.
The two provided needed sup
port for each other during the
long days of practice and competi
tion at the festival, an advantage
that may have put them over the
top.
"It was a lot of playing — it was
very nerve-wracking," said Years
ley, who played on a large, more
traditional organ in his solo per
formance.
"It takes a lot of luck, even if
you're prepared. It's a mix of luck
and..."
"Skill!" interjected Richards,
sitting close beside him on a pew
in Memorial Church.
Only four of the 65 competitors
were American. Because the focal
instrument of the festival changes
each year, this was the first time
in three years organists could
compete.
The last time an American won
first prize in solo competition was
in 1976.
"It was breathtaking — it was
very exciting, and the feeling is,
once you win a competition, you
never have to do another one, it's
over," Richards said.
After years of playing the
organ as a solitary pursuit, she
said she especially enjoyed the duo
competition.
"It's great fun, because as an
organist, you're generally playing
on your own," she said.
Now Richards will never have
to look very far for a duet partner.
Though she and Yearsley share a
deep passion for the organ, the
two said that personally it wasn't
love at first sight.
Yearsley met Richards in the
fall of 1988 when he arrived at
Stanford for the doctoral pro
gram.
Richards, who had started her
studies a year earlier, remem
bered her impression of Yearsley

when he came to Stanford.
"Before he arrived, he had a
reputation as a brilliant organist;
David plays the organ as if he
were there when the music was
composed," Richards said, adding
that this was a little bit intimidat
ing to herself and her classmates.
"So we all didn't pay a lot of
attention to him then," she
laughed.
Richards' love for the organ
began in childhood, as did Years
ley's.
About 18 years ago, as a 10-
year-old girl in London, Richards
was fascinated by a large organ,
located in the center of her school.
"It looked interesting and I
thought it'd be fun to play," said
Richards, who had been taking
piano lessons since she was about
5.
Yearsley, who also began play
ing the piano at an early age and
the organ at 14, remembered a
friend of the family who inspired
him to be an organist.
"It's a matter of luck and incli
nation," he said of his enthusiasm
for the organ.
While Richards and Yearsley
were in the midst of their Stan
ford graduate work, they went to
Europe with a group of organ stu
dents. It was during this trip that
their affection for each other
began to grow.
Soon after, the two both spent
time in Europe studying with
organ experts. Since then, their
relationship has been more than
purely musical. Even though they
were in two separate countries,
they still took time to visit each
other. They dated for a few years,
and the rest is organ history.
As part of his year-long stint as
University organist, Yearsley
teaches organ students, manages
the organ concert series and plays
concerts.
Richards, who holds joint
English and Danish citizenship, is
working on her dissertation,
"Eree Fantasia and the Aesthetics
of the Picturesque," as a fellow at
the Getty Center for the History
of Art and Humanities in Santa
Monica.
The couple currently resides in
Santa Monica. After this year,
they will move to Cornell.

"It was a lot of playing — it was
very nerve-wracking," said Years
ley, who played on a large, more
traditional organ in his solo per
formance.
"It takes a lot of luck, even if
you're prepared. It's a mix of luck
and..."
"Skill!" interjected Richards,
sitting close beside him on a pew
in Memorial Church.
Only four of the 65 competitors
were American. Because the focal
instrument of the festival changes
each year, this was the first time
in three years organists could
compete.
The last time an American won
first prize in solo competition was
in 1976.
"It was breathtaking — it was
very exciting, and the feeling is,
once you win a competition, you
never have to do another one, it's
over," Richards said.
After years of playing the
organ as a solitary pursuit, she
said she especially enjoyed the duo
competition.
"It's great fun, because as an
organist, you're generally playing
on your own," she said.
Now Richards will never have
to look very far for a duet partner.
Though she and Yearsley share a
deep passion for the organ, the
two said that personally it wasn't
love at first sight.
Yearsley met Richards in the
fall of 1988 when he arrived at
Stanford for the doctoral pro
gram.
Richards, who had started her
studies a year earlier, remem
bered her impression of Yearsley

when he came to Stanford.
"Before he arrived, he had a
reputation as a brilliant organist;
David plays the organ as if he
were there when the music was
composed," Richards said, adding
that this was a little bit intimidat
ing to herself and her classmates.
"So we all didn't pay a lot of
attention to him then," she
laughed.
Richards' love for the organ
began in childhood, as did Years
ley's.
About 18 years ago, as a 10-
year-old girl in London, Richards
was fascinated by a large organ,
located in the center of her school.
"It looked interesting and I
thought it'd be fun to play," said
Richards, who had been taking
piano lessons since she was about
5.
Yearsley, who also began play
ing the piano at an early age and
the organ at 14, remembered a
friend of the family who inspired
him to be an organist.
"It's a matter of luck and incli
nation," he said of his enthusiasm
for the organ.
While Richards and Yearsley
were in the midst of their Stan
ford graduate work, they went to
Europe with a group of organ stu
dents. It was during this trip that
their affection for each other
began to grow.
Soon after, the two both spent
time in Europe studying with
organ experts. Since then, their
relationship has been more than
purely musical. Even though they
were in two separate countries,
they still took time to visit each
other. They dated for a few years,
and the rest is organ history.
As part of his year-long stint as
University organist, Yearsley
teaches organ students, manages
the organ concert series and plays
concerts.
Richards, who holds joint
English and Danish citizenship, is
working on her dissertation,
"Eree Fantasia and the Aesthetics
of the Picturesque," as a fellow at
the Getty Center for the History
of Art and Humanities in Santa
Monica.
The couple currently resides in
Santa Monica. After this year,
they will move to Cornell.
