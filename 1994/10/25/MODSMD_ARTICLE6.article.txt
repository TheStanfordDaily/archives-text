# Living in harmony
## Organist duo plays, competes together 
### Solveig Pederson Staff writer 
Once solo artists, Stanford
organists David Yearsley and
Annette Richards are now a
duo, in more ways than one.
Yearsley and Richards —
who were married on Sept. 17 in
Portola Valley— won first prize
in duo performance in an Au
gust international organ festi
val held in Bruges, Belgium.
Yearsley, the acting Univer

sity organist for 1994-95, also
competed as a solo artist and
won first prize, in addition to
the audience prize, which is
voted on by audience members.
"It's very rare that the audi
ence and the jury both like the
same person," said Richards, a
doctorate student in music who
is on leave from her position as
assistant professor of music and
university organist at Cornell
University.
