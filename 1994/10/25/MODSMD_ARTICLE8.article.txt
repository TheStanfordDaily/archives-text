# Native American Studies on horizon?
## Group pushes for program; lesbian, gay, bisexual students also studying options 
### Jamie Taylor Staff writer 
Riding the wave of the recent
formation of committees to look
into Chicano and Asian-American
studies, students are now lobbying
to create a program for Native
American studies and a Lesbian,
Gay and Bisexual curriculum.
Although the idea for a Native
American studies program is not
new, Muwekma-Tah-Ruk Resi
dent Fellow Andrew Lisac said the
way the University has responded
to other communities' desires for
ethnic studies has acted as a cata
lyst for students who want a Na
tive American studies program.
"The context is good right now,"
Lisac said.
Residents of Muwekma-Tah-
Ruk have begun to do formal re
search regarding Native American

studies in a weekly house seminar.
Senior Jim Ruel, the seminar
teaching assistant, said the stu
dents have formed committees to
investigate how to integrate such a
program into Stanford's curricu
lum.
"We're just discussing things
right now, but hopefully, I'd like to
see a task force created for Native
American studies," Ruel
said.Lisac added, "We're in a very
early stage of development. We're
trying to understand the way that
other studies are structured, and
see where that structure fits into
our community."
Ruel said he believes the Uni
versity would be wise to create a
Native American studies program
to meet its goal of a diverse stu
dent body.
