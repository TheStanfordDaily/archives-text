# Native American Studies on horizon?
## Group pushes for program; lesbian, gay, bisexual students also studying options 
### Jamie Taylor Staff writer 
Riding the wave of the recent
formation of committees to look
into Chicano and Asian-American
studies, students are now lobbying
to create a program for Native
American studies and a Lesbian,
Gay and Bisexual curriculum.
Although the idea for a Native
American studies program is not
new, Muwekma-Tah-Ruk Resi
dent Fellow Andrew Lisac said the
way the University has responded
to other communities' desires for
ethnic studies has acted as a cata
lyst for students who want a Na
tive American studies program.
"The context is good right now,"
Lisac said.
Residents of Muwekma-Tah-
Ruk have begun to do formal re
search regarding Native American

studies in a weekly house seminar.
Senior Jim Ruel, the seminar
teaching assistant, said the stu
dents have formed committees to
investigate how to integrate such a
program into Stanford's curricu
lum.
"We're just discussing things
right now, but hopefully, I'd like to
see a task force created for Native
American studies," Ruel
said.Lisac added, "We're in a very
early stage of development. We're
trying to understand the way that
other studies are structured, and
see where that structure fits into
our community."
Ruel said he believes the Uni
versity would be wise to create a
Native American studies program
to meet its goal of a diverse stu
dent body.
"All universities need to make
education relative to the lives of
students," Lisac added. "A lot of
universities have become very
based on theory and abstract.
Ironically, Stanford was conceived
as a practical university, but we've
been moving away from that."
Both Ruel and Lisac said they
believe a Native American Studies
program would benefit all aca
demic departments at Stanford.
"A Native American Studies
curriculum would be very inter
disciplinary. You can study the
culture in almost every field,"
Ruel said, adding that because of
its broad academic base, a Native
American Studies curriculum
might not neatly fit beneath
another department, such as
American Studies.
"Such a program would have

to be interdisciplinary," Lisac
agreed. "That's the real joy of it
— there are so many ways to look
at it. It crosses a lot of different
disciplines."
Lisac added that "it would be
difficult to fit Native American
Studies into a 'traditional' aca
demic department. It runs a
gamut."
"There is a lot of interest in
Native American culture," Lisac
said. He said the Muwekma house
seminar, which in past years usu
ally had 20 students attending,
currently has an enrollment of
about 40 people.
"Every class I've been in that
deals with Native American cul
ture has had to be moved because
there were so many students,"
Ruel added.
Lisac and Ruel said t hough they
are confident Stanford will have a
Native American Studies program
in the future, some obstacles stand
in the way. Both cited budgetary
concerns as an impediment, and

Lisac added that no core of Native
American faculty exists.
"Ideally, I'd like to see it have
its own program, but because of
money and things like that, that
might be difficult," Ruel said.
Asst. English Prof. Robert
Warrior, the only Native Ameri
can professor who teaches classes
specifically focusing on this sub
ject, said he is less confident that
such obstacles can be overcome.
"I'm for a Native American Stud
ies program, but not with what
we have now," he said. "It's a
great idea if you have some solid
thinking behind it, but right now
we lack faculty resources."
This lack of faculty has caused
some problems in teaching Native
American culture at the Universi
ty, Ruel said.
"I've had some strong objec
tions to some of the classes that
deal with Native American cul
ture here," Ruel said. "There's no
mechanism to check on the accu
racy of what's taught. A Native

American Studies program would
provide that checking mecha
nism."
Lisac said many other univer
sities have Native American Stud
ies programs. Schools such as
UCLA have separate departments
for Native American curricula,
while others connect their Native
American academic programs to a
Department of Ethnic Studies.
The Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual
Community Center has also
developed a focus group of stu
dents to research ways to per
suade the University to seriously
consider a program on Lesbian,
Gay and Bisexual studies.
Not all students, however, are
confident that the University will
be receptive to implementing
such a program.
One woman at the LGBCC said
"the University never takes us
into account."
Program Coordinator Tiov
Gilbert, who advises the center,
was not available for comment.

currently has an enrollment of
about 40 people.
"Every class I've been in that
deals with Native American cul
ture has had to be moved because
there were so many students,"
Ruel added.
Lisac and Ruel said t hough they
are confident Stanford will have a
Native American Studies program
in the future, some obstacles stand
in the way. Both cited budgetary
concerns as an impediment, and

Lisac added that no core of Native
American faculty exists.
"Ideally, I'd like to see it have
its own program, but because of
money and things like that, that
might be difficult," Ruel said.
Asst. English Prof. Robert
Warrior, the only Native Ameri
can professor who teaches classes
specifically focusing on this sub
ject, said he is less confident that
such obstacles can be overcome.
"I'm for a Native American Stud
ies program, but not with what
we have now," he said. "It's a
great idea if you have some solid
thinking behind it, but right now
we lack faculty resources."
This lack of faculty has caused
some problems in teaching Native
American culture at the Universi
ty, Ruel said.
"I've had some strong objec
tions to some of the classes that
deal with Native American cul
ture here," Ruel said. "There's no
mechanism to check on the accu
racy of what's taught. A Native

American Studies program would
provide that checking mecha
nism."
Lisac said many other univer
sities have Native American Stud
ies programs. Schools such as
UCLA have separate departments
for Native American curricula,
while others connect their Native
American academic programs to a
Department of Ethnic Studies.
The Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual
Community Center has also
developed a focus group of stu
dents to research ways to per
suade the University to seriously
consider a program on Lesbian,
Gay and Bisexual studies.
Not all students, however, are
confident that the University will
be receptive to implementing
such a program.
One woman at the LGBCC said
"the University never takes us
into account."
Program Coordinator Tiov
Gilbert, who advises the center,
was not available for comment.
