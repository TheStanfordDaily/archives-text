### 
CAPE TOWN, South Africa
(AP) — A high court judge has
prepared a 190-page verdict in the
trial of three black militants ac
cused of murdering Stanford
graduate and American Fulbright
scholar Amy Biehl.
Judge Gerald Friedman began
reading his verdict today in the
non-jury trial. But after getting
through roughly three-quarters
of the pages, he gave no indication
whether he had found the men
guilty or innocent of beating and
stabbing the white exchange stu
dent to death in August 1993.
The reading was prolonged by
the need to translate the ruling
into Xhosa, the defendants' first
language. A verdict is expected
today.
Mongezi Manqina, 22,
Mzikhona Nofemela, 19, and
Vusumzi Ntamo, 23, all members
of the militant black Pan African

ist Students' Organization, have
pleaded innocent to charges of
murder, public violence and rob
bery in Biehl's death.
Friedman spent much of the 5
1/2 hours in court Monday ex
plaining why he had accepted con
fessions from two of the defen
dants despite charges the police
had forced the statement from
them, a controversy that arose
often during the 11-month trial.
He then read confessions from
Nofemela, who said he had
thrown stones at Biehl's over
turned car, and Ntamo, who said
he had hit her on the head three
times with a brick.
Friedman described Biehl's
last moments in detail as he sum
marized the evidence of six wit
nesses who said they saw a mob of
black youths stab and bludgeon to
death the white Fulbright scholar
in Guguletu, a township near
Cape Town.
Two women, who testified only
after being assured their identi
ties would be hidden, said they
saw Manqina and Nofemela stab
bing Biehl as she lay on the grass
outside a Caltex gas station where
she had tried to run for help.
"She had been struck in the

face by the brick that had shat
tered the windscreen and her face
was bleeding," Friedman said,
summarizing testimony from one
of the women. "The deceased ran
across the road in the direction of
the service station ... a female
kicked her feet out from under
her and she fell."
If found guilty of a racially
motivated murder, the defen
dants could be sentenced to
death, but more likely would face
prison terms. South Africa has
suspended executions and the

new African National Congress
led government is expected to
abolish them.
In cases that could lead to the
death penalty, South African
judges are assisted in considering
their verdicts by two lawyers
called "assessors." Friedman,
who is white, was assisted by a
white woman, Jolyon Knoll, and a
black man, Charles Goredema.
About two dozen family mem
bers and friends of the defendants
listened quietly as Friedman read
his judgment into a public address

system installed for the occasion.
Judges normally do not use voice
amplification.
The 26-year-old Biehl, a 1989
Stanford graduate in interna
tional relations, was in South
Africa to research women's
rights and help with voter educa
tion ahead of the country's first
all-race election that brought
Nelson Mandela's African
National Congress to power last
April. She was killed two days
before she was to return home to
Newport Keach, Calif
