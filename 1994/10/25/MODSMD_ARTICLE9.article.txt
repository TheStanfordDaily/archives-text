CAPE TOWN, South Africa
(AP) â€” A high court judge has
prepared a 190-page verdict in the
trial of three black militants ac
cused of murdering Stanford
graduate and American Fulbright
scholar Amy Biehl.
Judge Gerald Friedman began
reading his verdict today in the
non-jury trial. But after getting
through roughly three-quarters
of the pages, he gave no indication
whether he had found the men
guilty or innocent of beating and
stabbing the white exchange stu
dent to death in August 1993.
The reading was prolonged by
the need to translate the ruling
into Xhosa, the defendants' first
language. A verdict is expected
today.
Mongezi Manqina, 22,
Mzikhona Nofemela, 19, and
Vusumzi Ntamo, 23, all members
of the militant black Pan African

ist Students' Organization, have
pleaded innocent to charges of
murder, public violence and rob
bery in Biehl's death.
Friedman spent much of the 5
1/2 hours in court Monday ex
plaining why he had accepted con
fessions from two of the defen
dants despite charges the police
had forced the statement from
them, a controversy that arose
often during the 11-month trial.
He then read confessions from
Nofemela, who said he had
thrown stones at Biehl's over
turned car, and Ntamo, who said
he had hit her on the head three
times with a brick.
Friedman described Biehl's
last moments in detail as he sum
marized the evidence of six wit
nesses who said they saw a mob of
black youths stab and bludgeon to
death the white Fulbright scholar
