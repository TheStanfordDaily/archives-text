Goldman, Sachs & Co.
When Considering Your Career
Opportunities,
Consider One More Thing.
Consider the investment bank where a variety of
j
opportunities are available for individuals from a wide
range of backgrounds. Where investment banking, sales,
trading, information technology, finance, accounting,
asset management, research and operations are integral
to the firm's success. And where finding the area that is
right for you is as simple as joining us at our upcoming
information session.
In short, consider Goldman Sachs.
