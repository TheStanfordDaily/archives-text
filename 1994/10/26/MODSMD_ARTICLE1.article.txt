# Casper's leadership style sets University tone, issues
## 
### Scott Van Winkle Senior staff writer 
With the year-long study of undergraduate educa
tion completed and the indirect-cost controversy es
sentially at an end, the reins of the University are
now more clearly than ever in the hands of Universi
ty President Gerhard Casper.
Holding the nebulous office of Stanford Universi
ty president has offered a number of unpredictable
challenges to Casper, but it also provides one certain
ty: he must be, at all times, both an academic and a
leader.
These two roles are often at variance, sometimes
even contradictory, but how well a president balances
them can determine the effectiveness of an adminis
tration.
Casper's style has tended toward the academic, fo
cusing on what supporters call "quality of educa
tion," the president's most important responsibility.
Others say, though, that Casper is ignoring his
role as a public figure, offering only half-hearted re
sponses to campus and national issues.
Complicating matters is the time frame of
Casper's agenda. The long-awaited report of the

two more years to implement, contrasted strongly in
the past two weeks with two momentous events: a
settlement with the government putting an end to
the indirect-cost controversy and a $77.4 million gift
from David Packard and William Hewlett for the con
struction of a new science and engineering quad.
"Those that emphasize a speedy resolution. . .un
derestimate that it takes years for institutions (to
change)," Casper said in an interview this week. "I
think that in part, the tension and pressures are a
function of everyone thinking it can be done in six
months."
Not that Casper is starved for accomplishments to
showcase. Major announcements as propitious as
those made by Casper in the past two weeks are the
stuff of which college administrators' dreams are
made.
And while Casper hasn't made much of his own
role in these changes, there is a sense among many in

the administration that with the
turn of events, the president is
finally coming into his own.
"He has a very quiet style,"
said Statistics Chair Bradley
Efron. "It's easy to be fooled. . . .
But I think he's one of the most
active presidents we've had."
'Out of the headlines'
Despite the substance of his
achievements, though, Casper's
low-key style is exactly the issue
for many.
With respect to the long-run
ning indirect-cost saga, for exam
ple, Casper has received credit for
making the University less visi
ble, which some say played a part
in last week's settlement of the
issue.
Because of Casper, Efron said,
"We got out of the headlines,
(and) we got a good deal out of it."
Critics, however, take issue
with Casper's unwillingness to
speak out on important issues.
"I see him as not really a lead
er, but someone who sees what
way the wind is blowing,"
English Prof. Ron Rebholz said.
"It's a style that suits him ... to
appoint a committee. That means
he doesn't have to have an opin
ion."
Along with the education com
mission, Casper has appointed
committees to study the use of

technology in teaching and learn
ing, as well as the possibility of
creating an Asian-American
Studies program.
And in response to a hunger
strike by Chicano students in
May, he also created three com
mittees to study a possible Chi
cano studies program, the Uni
versity grape boycott policy and
the University's relationship
with East Palo Alto.
"Committees are needed,

'He exemplifies with
great style the prima
ry purposes of the
University.'
— Jean Fetter

reports are important, issues
have to be studied," Rebholz said.
"But the president can also take a
position on what the committee
finds."
Supporters praise President
Casper's approach as a part of his
academic bent. "First and fore
most, he consults, . . . but more
importantly he listens," said Jean
Fetter, the president's special
assistant. "The primary purpose
of a university is teaching and
learning, and he exemplifies with
great style the primary purposes
of the University."
Political Science Prof. Stephen

Krasner said Casper has appoint
ed committees only when they
are appropriate. "University
presidents have a lot of choices of
what they want to focus on," he
said. "On a lot of important
issues they (Casper and Provost
Condoleezza Rice) have been will
ing to make the decisions."
The kinds of issues addressed
also matter. Krasner praised
Casper for his handling of the
University budget and his reor
ganization of its administration
two years ago.
A recent essay in The New
York Times, however, criticized
Casper and other college presi
dents for not expressing opin
ions on national issues.
In that article, Casper is quot
ed as saying, "I feel I must speak
out on issues that concern the
University, but I was not
appointed to speak out on a whole
range of social issues, because
when I do there will be those who
disagree."
Rebholz conceded that "we
need to have presidents who
don't anger Congress, who don't
anger alumni, and we have to
raise money," but argued that
there are times when "boldness is
appropriate."
He contrasted the reaction to
the Vietnam war — when "presi
dents did take positions" — to
Casper's response to a letter
signed by 700 Stanford faculty
members condemning the verdict
in the 1992 Rodney King trial.
"I must confess that when

only Stanford faculty get togeth
er qua faculty and take out an ad,
I have real reservations about
that," Casper said at the time.
This ideology, though, has its
limits, Rebholz said.
"You can't on the one hand say
the University is here to seek the
truth and on the other hand be
shy about what you perceive as
the truth. He rightly says that he
can't speak for the whole Univer
sity, but he can speak for Ger
hard Casper."
Conflicting styles
Casper's qualms about the
appropriate way for University
leaders to express their political
concerns have made his interac
tions with overtly political cam
pus groups — such as last May's
hunger strikers — strained, to
say the least.
He is aware of the "exceeding
ly diverse and strongly held
views" of Stanford students, yet
said he faces difficulties in
responding to student groups
because individual students he
has talked to "don't assume that
anybody speaks for them."
Casper said he resists respond
ing to "political pressure" — such
as the Asian-American studies
protest that "invaded" the Facul
ty Senate last year — because of
his belief that "rational debate"
is necessary in deciding Universi
ty policy.
"What I do not believe is that
we should make curricular deci
sions [because one group! tries to

impose their preferences,' he
said.
Nevertheless, Casper was
praised for his handling of the
hunger strike both by campus
conservatives and supporters of
the Chicano students, though
Luis Fraga, director of the Stan
ford Center for Chicano Research
and Grape Policy committee
chair, made it clear that the pres
ident's responses to committee

'The president can
also take a position
on what the commit
tee finds.'
— Ron Rebholz

reports will be closely watched.
Efron, on the other hand, said
the end of the strike showed both
"how well |Casper) thought this
thing out" and that he "absolute
ly wasn't going to sacrifice his
principles for anything."
Despite the fact that the agree
ment ending the strike contained
no guarantees of eventual
changes, Fraga called the commit
tee a "good-faith effort on
[Casper's] part to be able to
understand the scope of these
issues."
"As opposed to using commit
tees as a way to table issues, [the
approach] is allowing people to

become better informed and then
decide what kind of action to
take," he said.
Guiding implementation
Casper said that he has no
ultimate guiding vision of where
the University should be. "We
need to renew and reinvent our
selves every single year," he said.
His ideas, though, are begin
ning to have an effect on the Uni
versity, especially as the Commis
sion on Undergraduate Educa
tion report begins to be imple
mented.
"The wheels are turning," said
John Etchemendy, senior associ
ate dean of the School of Human
ities and Sciences as well as the
chair of the president's new com
mittee on technology in teaching
and learning.
Casper's studious approach of
forming committees is needed,
Etchemendy said, because it
allows for a "global rethinking"
of University processes.
"There is a jurisdictional mis
match between these ad hoc com
mittees that are set up and exist
ing bodies, but that's OK," he
said. "As long as there's commu
nication [between groups] this
kind of exchange can be very,
very fruitful."
The president's emphasis on
academics has also had ideologi
cal effects.
"The tone of the University
has become more focused on its
basic mission of teaching and
research," Krasner said.
With the year-long study of undergraduate educa

now more clearly than ever in the hands of Universi

ple, Casper has received credit for
making the University less visi
ble, which some say played a part
in last week's settlement of the
issue.
Because of Casper, Efron said,
"We got out of the headlines,
(and) we got a good deal out of it."
Critics, however, take issue
with Casper's unwillingness to
speak out on important issues.
"I see him as not really a lead
er, but someone who sees what
way the wind is blowing,"
English Prof. Ron Rebholz said.
"It's a style that suits him ... to
appoint a committee. That means
he doesn't have to have an opin
ion."
Along with the education com
mission, Casper has appointed
committees to study the use of

technology in teaching and learn
ing, as well as the possibility of
creating an Asian-American
Studies program.
And in response to a hunger
strike by Chicano students in
May, he also created three com
mittees to study a possible Chi
cano studies program, the Uni
versity grape boycott policy and
the University's relationship
with East Palo Alto.
"Committees are needed,

'He exemplifies with
great style the prima
ry purposes of the
University.'
— Jean Fetter

reports are important, issues
have to be studied," Rebholz said.
"But the president can also take a
position on what the committee
finds."
Supporters praise President
Casper's approach as a part of his
academic bent. "First and fore
most, he consults, . . . but more
importantly he listens," said Jean
Fetter, the president's special
assistant. "The primary purpose
of a university is teaching and
learning, and he exemplifies with
great style the primary purposes
of the University."
Political Science Prof. Stephen

Krasner said Casper has appoint
ed committees only when they
are appropriate. "University
presidents have a lot of choices of
what they want to focus on," he
said. "On a lot of important
issues they (Casper and Provost
Condoleezza Rice) have been will
ing to make the decisions."
The kinds of issues addressed
also matter. Krasner praised
Casper for his handling of the
University budget and his reor
ganization of its administration
two years ago.
A recent essay in The New
York Times, however, criticized
Casper and other college presi
dents for not expressing opin
ions on national issues.
In that article, Casper is quot
ed as saying, "I feel I must speak
out on issues that concern the
University, but I was not
appointed to speak out on a whole
range of social issues, because
when I do there will be those who
disagree."
Rebholz conceded that "we
need to have presidents who
don't anger Congress, who don't
anger alumni, and we have to
raise money," but argued that
there are times when "boldness is
appropriate."
He contrasted the reaction to
the Vietnam war — when "presi
dents did take positions" — to
Casper's response to a letter
signed by 700 Stanford faculty
members condemning the verdict
in the 1992 Rodney King trial.
"I must confess that when

only Stanford faculty get togeth
er qua faculty and take out an ad,
I have real reservations about
that," Casper said at the time.
This ideology, though, has its
limits, Rebholz said.
"You can't on the one hand say
the University is here to seek the
truth and on the other hand be
shy about what you perceive as
the truth. He rightly says that he
can't speak for the whole Univer
sity, but he can speak for Ger
hard Casper."
Conflicting styles
Casper's qualms about the
appropriate way for University
leaders to express their political
concerns have made his interac
tions with overtly political cam
pus groups — such as last May's
hunger strikers — strained, to
say the least.
He is aware of the "exceeding
ly diverse and strongly held
views" of Stanford students, yet
said he faces difficulties in
responding to student groups
because individual students he
has talked to "don't assume that
anybody speaks for them."
Casper said he resists respond
ing to "political pressure" — such
as the Asian-American studies
protest that "invaded" the Facul
ty Senate last year — because of
his belief that "rational debate"
is necessary in deciding Universi
ty policy.
"What I do not believe is that
we should make curricular deci
sions [because one group! tries to

impose their preferences,' he
said.
Nevertheless, Casper was
praised for his handling of the
hunger strike both by campus
conservatives and supporters of
the Chicano students, though
Luis Fraga, director of the Stan
ford Center for Chicano Research
and Grape Policy committee
chair, made it clear that the pres
ident's responses to committee

'The president can
also take a position
on what the commit
tee finds.'
— Ron Rebholz

reports will be closely watched.
Efron, on the other hand, said
the end of the strike showed both
"how well |Casper) thought this
thing out" and that he "absolute
ly wasn't going to sacrifice his
principles for anything."
Despite the fact that the agree
ment ending the strike contained
no guarantees of eventual
changes, Fraga called the commit
tee a "good-faith effort on
[Casper's] part to be able to
understand the scope of these
issues."
"As opposed to using commit
tees as a way to table issues, [the
approach] is allowing people to

become better informed and then
decide what kind of action to
take," he said.
Guiding implementation
Casper said that he has no
ultimate guiding vision of where
the University should be. "We
need to renew and reinvent our
selves every single year," he said.
His ideas, though, are begin
ning to have an effect on the Uni
versity, especially as the Commis
sion on Undergraduate Educa
tion report begins to be imple
mented.
"The wheels are turning," said
John Etchemendy, senior associ
ate dean of the School of Human
ities and Sciences as well as the
chair of the president's new com
mittee on technology in teaching
and learning.
Casper's studious approach of
forming committees is needed,
Etchemendy said, because it
allows for a "global rethinking"
of University processes.
"There is a jurisdictional mis
match between these ad hoc com
mittees that are set up and exist
ing bodies, but that's OK," he
said. "As long as there's commu
nication [between groups] this
kind of exchange can be very,
very fruitful."
The president's emphasis on
academics has also had ideologi
cal effects.
"The tone of the University
has become more focused on its
basic mission of teaching and
research," Krasner said.
With the year-long study of undergraduate educa
tion completed and the indirect-cost controversy es
sentially at an end, the reins of the University are
now more clearly than ever in the hands of Universi
ty President Gerhard Casper.
Holding the nebulous office of Stanford Universi
ty president has offered a number of unpredictable
challenges to Casper, but it also provides one certain
ty: he must be, at all times, both an academic and a
leader.
These two roles are often at variance, sometimes
even contradictory, but how well a president balances
them can determine the effectiveness of an adminis
tration.
Casper's style has tended toward the academic, fo
cusing on what supporters call "quality of educa
tion," the president's most important responsibility.
Others say, though, that Casper is ignoring his
role as a public figure, offering only half-hearted re
sponses to campus and national issues.
Complicating matters is the time frame of
Casper's agenda. The long-awaited report of the

don't anger Congress, who don't
anger alumni, and we have to
raise money," but argued that
there are times when "boldness is
appropriate."
He contrasted the reaction to
the Vietnam war — when "presi
dents did take positions" — to
Casper's response to a letter
signed by 700 Stanford faculty
members condemning the verdict
in the 1992 Rodney King trial.
"I must confess that when

only Stanford faculty get togeth
er qua faculty and take out an ad,
I have real reservations about
that," Casper said at the time.
This ideology, though, has its
limits, Rebholz said.
"You can't on the one hand say
the University is here to seek the
truth and on the other hand be
shy about what you perceive as
the truth. He rightly says that he
can't speak for the whole Univer
sity, but he can speak for Ger
hard Casper."
Conflicting styles
Casper's qualms about the
appropriate way for University
leaders to express their political
concerns have made his interac
tions with overtly political cam
pus groups — such as last May's
hunger strikers — strained, to
say the least.
He is aware of the "exceeding
ly diverse and strongly held
views" of Stanford students, yet
said he faces difficulties in
responding to student groups
because individual students he
has talked to "don't assume that
anybody speaks for them."
Casper said he resists respond
ing to "political pressure" — such
as the Asian-American studies
protest that "invaded" the Facul
ty Senate last year — because of
his belief that "rational debate"
is necessary in deciding Universi
ty policy.
"What I do not believe is that
we should make curricular deci
sions [because one group! tries to

impose their preferences,' he
said.
Nevertheless, Casper was
praised for his handling of the
hunger strike both by campus
conservatives and supporters of
the Chicano students, though
Luis Fraga, director of the Stan
ford Center for Chicano Research
and Grape Policy committee
chair, made it clear that the pres
ident's responses to committee

'The president can
also take a position
on what the commit
tee finds.'

reports will be closely watched.
Efron, on the other hand, said
the end of the strike showed both
"how well |Casper) thought this
thing out" and that he "absolute
ly wasn't going to sacrifice his
principles for anything."
Despite the fact that the agree
ment ending the strike contained
no guarantees of eventual
changes, Fraga called the commit
tee a "good-faith effort on
[Casper's] part to be able to
understand the scope of these
issues."
"As opposed to using commit
tees as a way to table issues, [the
approach] is allowing people to

become better informed and then
decide what kind of action to
take," he said.
Guiding implementation
Casper said that he has no
ultimate guiding vision of where
the University should be. "We
need to renew and reinvent our
selves every single year," he said.
His ideas, though, are begin
ning to have an effect on the Uni
versity, especially as the Commis
sion on Undergraduate Educa
tion report begins to be imple
mented.
"The wheels are turning," said
John Etchemendy, senior associ
ate dean of the School of Human
ities and Sciences as well as the
chair of the president's new com
mittee on technology in teaching
and learning.
Casper's studious approach of
forming committees is needed,
Etchemendy said, because it
allows for a "global rethinking"
of University processes.
"There is a jurisdictional mis
match between these ad hoc com
mittees that are set up and exist
ing bodies, but that's OK," he
said. "As long as there's commu
nication [between groups] this
kind of exchange can be very,
very fruitful."
The president's emphasis on
academics has also had ideologi
cal effects.
"The tone of the University
has become more focused on its
basic mission of teaching and
research," Krasner said.
