# Casper's leadership style sets University tone, issues
## 
### Scott Van Winkle Senior staff writer 
With the year-long study of undergraduate educa
tion completed and the indirect-cost controversy es
sentially at an end, the reins of the University are
now more clearly than ever in the hands of Universi
ty President Gerhard Casper.
Holding the nebulous office of Stanford Universi
ty president has offered a number of unpredictable
challenges to Casper, but it also provides one certain
ty: he must be, at all times, both an academic and a
leader.
These two roles are often at variance, sometimes
even contradictory, but how well a president balances
them can determine the effectiveness of an adminis
tration.
Casper's style has tended toward the academic, fo
cusing on what supporters call "quality of educa
tion," the president's most important responsibility.
Others say, though, that Casper is ignoring his
role as a public figure, offering only half-hearted re
sponses to campus and national issues.
Complicating matters is the time frame of
Casper's agenda. The long-awaited report of the

President's Com
mission on Un
dergraduate Ed
ucation, expected
to take at least

two more years to implement, contrasted strongly in
the past two weeks with two momentous events: a
settlement with the government putting an end to
the indirect-cost controversy and a $77.4 million gift
from David Packard and William Hewlett for the con
struction of a new science and engineering quad.
"Those that emphasize a speedy resolution. . .un
derestimate that it takes years for institutions (to
change)," Casper said in an interview this week. "I
think that in part, the tension and pressures are a
function of everyone thinking it can be done in six
months."
Not that Casper is starved for accomplishments to
showcase. Major announcements as propitious as
those made by Casper in the past two weeks are the
stuff of which college administrators' dreams are
made.
And while Casper hasn't made much of his own
role in these changes, there is a sense among many in
