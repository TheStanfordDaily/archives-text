## Israel, Jordan sign treaty Two countries meet on former minefield to seal truce 
### 
WADI ARABA, Israel-Jordan
Border (AP) — Under a huge
banner proclaiming peace in
three languages, Israel and Jor
dan are signing a treaty today
to end 46 years of war — push
ing a vision of hope in a Middle
East convulsed by Islamic fun
damentalism.
The signing, to be witnessed
by President Clinton and 5,000
guests, is taking place on a
hastily asphalted former mine
field — an apt metaphor for an
uncertain future.
Despite the spectacular cere
mony planned at this uninhab
ited patch of desert just north
of the Red Sea, the Israeli mood
was sober yesterday in the
aftershock of a string of terror
ist attacks by Islamic funda
mentalists opposed to the
treaty.
Most legislators of the oppo
sition Likud said they would
stay away from the ceremony,
believing it extravagant and
insensitive to families who lost
relatives in recent attacks.

Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat was not invited, and
Palestinians were skeptical
about the treaty, worrying that
their quest for statehood would
be lost in the Arab rush to rec
oncile with Israel.
Arafat is angry that the
treaty gives Jordan's King Hus
sein custody of the Islamic holy
sites in Jerusalem, a city the
Palestinians claim as the capital
of a future Palestinian state.
Arafat reasserted the claim
to Jerusalem yesterday. "Those
who don't like it can drink from
the sea of Gaza," he told 2,000
cheering students at al-Azhar
University in the PLO-ruled
Gaza Strip.
Israel's parliament approved
the treaty overwhelmingly —
105 to three — after a day-long
debate yesterday.
In presenting the pact to
parliament, Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin responded to
Israelis' anxieties by painting
a vivid portrait of peace and
open borders.

The 72-year-old former gen
eral spoke of truckloads of
cargo moving between Israel
and Jordan, of businessmen
flying to Amman in the morn
ing, closing a deal and being
back in Jerusalem by nightfall,
of families taking a day trip to
Petra, the ancient city in the
Jordanian desert.
Recalling his first public visit
to the Jordanian capital on Oct.
16, Rabin said:
"Last week we stood at night
on the balcony of the king's
palace in Amman, and opposite
us shone the lights of
Jerusalem, so near — just a few
dozen kilometers — after 46
years of hostility that separated
Amman from Jerusalem."
Although not given to emo
tional flourishes, the gruff old
soldier turned to Isaiah 52:7
to drive home his point: "How
beautiful on the mountains
are the feet of those who bring
good news, who proclaim
peace, who bring good tidings,
who proclaim salvation."
