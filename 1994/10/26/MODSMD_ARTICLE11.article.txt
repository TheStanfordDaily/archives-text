Feinstein attacks ad
SACRAMENTO (AP) - Sen.
Dianne Feinstein yesterday denounced
as a "fraud" a challenger's television
commercial that accuses her of
improperly voting for student aid pro
grams that benefited her husband's
company.
Republican Mike Huffington said he
stood by the ad despite a demand by
David C. Jones, chairman of National
Education Corp., that he withdraw the
spot and apologize.
Huffington's new commercial
contends the incumbent Democrat
voted four times on education bills
that contained funding for a chain of

vocational schools partially owned
by Richard Blum, Feinstein's hus
band.
"In spite of her campaign promises to
steer clear of conflict, Mrs. Feinstein
voted more than once for federal funding
— taxpayer funding — which has direct
ly benefited her personal financial inter
ests," Huffington said in Sacramento.
Corpses found
SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina
(AP) — The mutilated corpses of at
least 23 civilians, allegedly killed by
renegade Bosnian soldiers, have been
found in ravines near Sarajevo.
The murder toll was made public

for the first time yesterday when a mil
itary court judge presiding over the
trial of the soldiers displayed docu
ments and photographs gathered in an
investigation that began last year.
But the number could be higher,
because some of the victims' bodies
may never be found, Judge Muhamed
Pod ruga said.
The 13 defendants are believed to
be the first group of combatants to be
tried by their own government for
atrocities committed during the nearly
three-and-a-half years of war in the
former Yugoslavia. They are accused
of having rounded up and killed sever
al people, mostly ethnic Serbs from
Sareyevo, last year.
