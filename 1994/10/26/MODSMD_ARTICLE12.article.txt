# CFC black market exposed
## Illegal imports costly for government, environment 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Millions of
pounds of ozone-killing chemicals are
pouring illegally into the United States,
confounding attempts to shift to a less
environmentally harmful chemical.
Industry and government officials
said yesterday the illegal imports of chlo
rofluorocarbons — perhaps as much as
20 million pounds a year by some esti
mates — have created a lucrative black
market in a type of CFC used as a refrig
erant for automobile air conditioners
and commercial and home cooling sys
tems.
The illegal imports have grown to such
a level that by some estimates they are
costing the federal government $100 mil

lion a year in lost excise taxes alone, said
Kevin Fay, executive director of the
Alliance for Responsible Atmospheric
Policy.
The availability of cheap black-market
CFC for refrigeration is "substantially
discouraging the shift to new materials
or practices that can reduce the emission
of these compounds," added Fay, whose
group represents companies producing
CFCs and their substitutes.
Representatives of the Environmental
Protection Agency, the U.S. Customs
Service, and the Internal Revenue Ser
vice, said at a news conference that the
agencies planned to step up cooperative
efforts to stem the illegal imports.
