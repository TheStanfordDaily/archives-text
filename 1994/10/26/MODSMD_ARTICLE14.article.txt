Every student should
get informed, involved
in time for Election Day

IN THE BACK of this year's
California election handbook, a
poem titled, simply, "Later,"
sketches two starkly contrasting
scenes of Election Day.
In South Africa, an elderly
woman, brimming with enthusi
asm, makes a long, weary journey
on her aching feet to vote for the
first time in her life. And in New
York City, a busy young man, believ
ing he is "but one in a million,"
dashes past the "Vote: 100 feet" sign
and figures he'll just vote next year,
or later, when he has some time.
Those cynical New Yorkers,
right? Actually, the Sacramento
high school student who wrote the
poem is indicting all Americans

who don t exercise their
right to vote.
But voting is not just
about going to the polls one
day to punch a few holes in
a ballot card. It's about
arming oneself with enough

information beforehand to make
meaningful choices.
This means reading the elections
handbook and local newspapers, and
perhaps even attending debates right
here on campus — starting now.
On November Bth, voters across
the state will be choosing a state
governor, picking their representa
tion in the state assembly and in
Congress and deciding such
weighty matters as whether illegal
immigrants should be able to
receive social services and whether
California should adopt a single
payer health-care plan.
These are issues that can't be
captured in a sentence or a sound
bite or even a 30-second commer
cial. That's why it's important for
individual voters to find out for
themselves what the issues are.
Here at Stanford, there are

countless opportunities to do so,
from stopping at a table in White
Plaza to getting involved in a stu
dent group. This week, for exam
ple, students have organized sever
al events related to the debate over
Proposition 187.
Learning about both the candi
dates and issues ahead of time will
ensure that the vote is not just a
mindless exercise determined strict
ly by party-line votes or whatever we
happened to hear others say.
Particularly in the more hotly
contested races, there have been a
slew of attacks and counterattacks
that have muddied our perspec
tives and perhaps even left us
somewhat disillusioned.
Still, the sophomoric antics that
inevitably crop up during the elec
tion season won't lessen the impact
of the outcome. The seats that
change hands and the new laws
that are enacted will be the same.
So it is up to the voters to make
sure the upcoming election is based

on thoughtful, informed
choices.
Voters between ages 18 and
29 make up about 17 percent
of the total registered voters
in California — not an
insignificant proportion.

Young people's decisions to punch
one hole and not the other could well
lead to a different outcome in many
of the races that now seem too close
to call.
In "Later," the busy young man
in New York did not care. "After all,
he would live for a long time, and
his vote would not make a differ
ence in the years to come," he
thinks. "His future would not be
changed by one lousy vote."
Luckily, Stanford students have
not turned into busy young men
and women bustling down the
streets of New York just yet.
And as Election Day approaches,
hopefully we can find some time to
learn more about the issues and
mull over our decisions.
Because in two weeks, we can make
pretty patterns on our ballot cards —
or we can make a real difference.
