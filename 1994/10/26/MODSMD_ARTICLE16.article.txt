## Turn attention to teaching 
### 
ON OCT. 11, alumni William
Hewlett and David Packard
pledged $77.4 million for a new sci
ence and engineering quad. The Univer
sity was appropriately dazzled; the top
news story the following day in Campus
Report ran with a pointed lead describing
Packard standing behind the then-new
Green Earth Sciences Building, gazing
"out over a landscape of drab 19505-era
engineering buildings." He surveys the
scene, then declares to himself "We've
got to do something."
With $77 million to work with, Packard
can. Hewlett and Packard's gift is extraor
dinary, and will change the face of the
University. As Dean of Engineering James
Gibbons put it, "Hewlett and Packard
have laid the foundation for the Universi
ty's second century as surely as Leland
and Jane Stanford did for the first."
But what exactly is this foundation?
The most frequent answer cites the need
for a new kind of liberal education, an
"intellectual integration" of science, engi
neering and the humanities. Reportedly,
Hewlett and Packard will make this uni
fication possible by funding a new "mini
campus" with science and engineering
facilities "second to none."
For me, the exclusivity of this lan
guage alone invites skepticism. But
equally dubious is the proposition that
state-of-the-art facilities will stimulate a
desegregated intellectual environment.
Packard anticipates my reaction, arguing

"buildings and equipment don't make a
great university. It's the people who do
the research and the teaching that make
a great university. But in today's world,
you cannot attract these people unless
you have the facilities that they need."
Interestingly enough, the companion
piece in Campus Report detailing the rec
ommendations of the Commission on
Undergraduate Education underscores
this very problem. Criticizing the Stanford
faculty's "widespread indifference," the
report emphasizes "the importance of
teaching in faculty selection and compen
sation" and prioritizes "the need for
increased faculty involvement with under
graduates." The commission illustrates
this deficiency with an alarming anecdote,
where "recent arrivals from other institu
tions are sometimes struck by the compar
ative ease with which individuals can
decide how much, or even whether, they
wish to be involved with undergraduates."
Though not explicitly stated, it appears
that faculty indifference (or active disre
gard) toward undergraduate education
affirms the preeminence of research inter
ests at Stanford. We can ascribe this trend
to personal preference or professional
requirements, but either case results in
unacceptable neglect of teaching responsi
bilities. Still, despite the CUE recommen
dations, the University continues to direct
millions toward the development of
research facilities, while organizations
dedicated to improving teaching are

thrilled by incidental grants of $100,000.
These glaring discrepancies suggest a
more fundamental divide between the
fields of research and teaching than we
have yet acknowledged. It is not just a
matter of preference — these are distinct
disciplines in themselves, requiring differ
ent skills and temperaments. Unfortu
nately, Packard is correct in stating that
we cannot attract talented teachers with
out having an equally talented research
team. But neither can we attract adven
turous students without well-trained
teachers committed to helping them learn.
When laying the foundations for the
University, Stanford observed that "tech
nically educated boys do not make the
most successful businessmen," and that
"the imagination needs to be cultivated
and developed to assure success in life."
"Businessmen" and "boys" aside, I
agree. However, we must remember that
a world-class university is not a business
partner, and that technological prowess
is not a sound basis for a learning insti
tution. Research thrives on imaginative
thinking, but there is nothing that incites
and develops the imagination the way a
gifted teacher does. And teachers, too,
come at a price.
