Guide to the Good Life at Stanford no longer quite so good

BAD NEWS, EVERYONE. The
"Good Life at Stanford" is appar
ently only three-fifths as good now
as it was last spring. Last year's 250-page
Guide to the Good Life has shrunk to
only 154 pages. That's 96 fewer pages of
fun things to do. Equally disturbing is the
huge increase in the ratio of ads to text.
Where has all the information gone?
Paging through the book, I became
suspicious that Good Life Publications
simply deleted reviews of businesses
which refused to advertise. Not wanting
to cast aspersions without facts, I took a
random sample of sections of the book
and numerically compared this year's
version to last year's. (Okay. I confess
that my sample is really not random at
all, it's just things I like: restaurants,
bookstores, sporting goods stores, bicycle
stores and places to go. But let's pre
tend.)
Look, for example, at "Peninsula
Restaurants." I know of no radical
shrinkage in the number of area restau
rants, yet the number of "breakfast
brunch" locations listed has fallen from
38 to 12. And the correlation between

restaurants with reviews in the new book
and restaurants which run ads is alarm
ingly high. Last year's book reviewed 21
Chinese restaurants. This year there are
only eight reviews, including reviews of
all six restaurants with ads in the book.
China Delight, which ran an ad last year
but dropped it this year, is no longer
reviewed. Suspicious, huh?
This happens throughout the book.
It seems Stanford students no longer
read books. How else could the editors
easily collapse 38 bookstores and
seven newsstands down to 18 book
stores and three newsstands? Appar
ently, prices at the Stanford Book
store are so low that no one would
bother shopping elsewhere.
To be fair, nine of the 21 stores
included in the Guide don't advertise
or offer coupons. But instead of big
blurbs describing and praising their
stores, the few nonadvertisers lucky
enough to be reviewed get one-liners
like "an attentive staff and a friendly
cat tend to customers" (making no
mention of what kind of books it sells)
or "known for its business reference

books" (this is all Stacey's Bookstore
gets!).
The correlation between the size of
one's ad and the amount of praise
received from the writers and editors is
obvious in the sporting goods section.
Courtesy Sports, which has a coupon
but no ad, receives only a one-line
description. Soccer World, which runs a
full-page ad and a coupon, gets six full
sentences. Foot Locker (no ad, no
coupon) gets only a sentence fragment
with no noun and no verb!
Surprisingly, in the process of whit
tling 31 sporting goods stores down to
18, no advertiser has had their review
eliminated. Among bicycle stores, the six
which ran no ads received an average of
1.17 sentences, compared to an average
of 3.0 sentences for the six stores which
ran ads.
And where advertising possibilities are
limited, they simply cut, cut, cut. The
nine-page section on Monterey, Carmel
and Big Sur is now only five pages. And
they've eliminated all mention of things
like "Monterey Annual Events," which
lists dates and phone numbers of big

events (e.g. the Monterey Jazz Festival
and the Pebble Beach Pro-Am) and less
er-known festivals like those celebrating
hot-air ballooning, blues, broccoli and
artichokes. I like to know about these
sorts of things. Once in a while, it's fun to
attend a festival like that.
Could this possibly have anything to
do with the fact that there are nearly as
many "advertising representatives"
(seven) as "writers" (12)? (I use quota
tion marks because I have yet to find
any new material in this year's edition).
Last year, there were six and 16,
respectively. Rather than focus on
turning out a good product, they are
worried about increasing advertising
revenue. And to cut production costs,
they printed the book on cheap paper
this year instead of the higher-quality
paper of last year.
It seems to me that the "Good Life" of
Stanford students has been shoved aside
to make room for the "Good Life" of who
ever is profiting from this venture. I'm
sure glad I still have last year's edition!
