# Resident complains of poor living conditions, inferior service at EV
## 
### 
My husband and I moved into
Escondido Village more than three
years ago and I still remember the
dirty conditions we were given to live
in. Our bathroom was filthy, tub, sink
and toilet. The floors were dirty,
needing to be swept and mopped. The
oven was dirty and the walls had not
been painted for a very long time. Our
curtains were all ripped along the bot
toms, and our screen doors did not
shut tightly. We spent more than six

hours cleaning the place before we
felt comfortable moving in our per
sonal belongings. We were very disap
pointed, having assumed Stanford
would provide us with clean, suitable
graduate housing.
And while I am conveying my dis
satisfaction regarding the disarray of
our apartment, I must also mention
that the new parking policy has
added a great deal of chaos. It seems
only right that if we pay at least $70
for a place to park our car, in a space
specifically marked with our apart
ment number, we should be able to
claim it as our own, as we have done
for the past three years.
Oh, I must not forget to mention
our heater. When we first moved in, as

the weather turned colder our heat
went on and we found it too warm.
When we tried to turn down the ther
mostat, our heater hummed. Obnox
iously. I called Escondido housing and
asked them to come fix it. They
refused, saying all we needed to do
was leave it on high and open the win
dows until our rooms reached a com
fortable temperature. Very bright,
and expensive, I would assume, for
the University. We will miss our
friends and the faculty at the Medical
School when we leave in June; howev
er, we will not miss the housing condi
tions Stanford has (not) provided for
us.
