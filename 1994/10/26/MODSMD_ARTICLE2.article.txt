## Judge convicts 3 in Biehl murder 
### Jo Marshall Staff writer with AP wire reports 
A high court judge in Cape
Town, South Africa yesterday
ruled that three black militants
were guilty of murdering Stan
ford graduate and American Ful
bright Scholar Amy Biehl last
year.
Judge Gerald Friedman called
the murder a "vicious attack" as
he convicted Vusumzi Ntamo,
Mongezi Manqina and Mzikhona
Nofemela of killing Biehl in a
black township where she was
helping with voter education
leading up to South Africa's first
all-race election.
In a phone interview yester
day, Peter Biehl, Amy's father,
said he is happy that the trial has
ended.
"We're relieved this painful
chapter is over," he said. "We're
also relieved for the people of
South Africa in that they have
seen their judicial system work
in a dignified way."
Though the convicted are like
ly to just face jail terms, the pros
ecutors are seeking the death
penalty for all three.
Biehl's father said the family
has "no particular interest in the
sentence." He said their major
concern was that the trial was
carried out in a dignified man
ner, which was one of the rea
sons he and his wife and daugh
ter attended most of the trial.
"It showed we were real peo
ple and took away the circus at
mosphere," he said. The family,
however, did not attend the final
stages of the trial because it
would "send the wrong signal,"
he said.
Biehl's mother Linda said she
did not want the killers to be exe
cuted. "We are not believers in
the death penalty and Amy
wasn't." She said she hoped for a
sentence that would be as reha
bilitative as possible.
Executions in South Africa
were suspended by the white
government of former President
F.W. de Klerk. President Nelson
Mandela's ruling African
National Congress favors abol
ishing the death penalty.
Due to threats and intimida
tion, only six prosecution wit
nesses came forward to say they
had seen the mob of black youths
stab and bludgeon Biehl to death
on Aug. 25, 1993, in Guguletu,
near Cape Town.
Biehl, 26, had been driving
black friends home when their
car was stoned and stopped.
According to testimony, she was
chased down by the crowd shout
ing the anti-white slogan "One
Settler! One Bullet!"
Three young women from the
Guguletu township testified
behind closed doors that they
saw Nofemela and Manqina stab
bing Biehl with knives.
"We're very grateful for the
three young women from
Guguletu . . . the Justice said he
relied on these three key wit
nesses," Peter Biehl said.
Amy Biehl, a 1989 Stanford
graduate in international rela
tions, was in South Africa to
research women's rights and
help voter education before the
all-race election that brought
Mandela's ANC to power in
April. She was killed two days

before she was to return home to
Newport Beach, Calif.
Peter Biehl said the family is
now in a state of shock by the
"enormity of the challenge of
what she left off." The family, he
said, sees the future on two lev
els.
"As a family we will make an
effort to live a normal life —
whatever a normal life is," he
said.
On the second level, the fami
ly will continue to carry on with
Amy Biehl's human rights work,
"which is a very serious respon
sibility," he said.
In the courtroom yesterday —
where about 90 supporters of the
accused and friends of the victim
packed the gallery — prosecutor
Nollie Niehaus said, "This was a
racist killing. She was killed
because she was white."
An attorney for the defen
dants, Justice Poswa, said the
killing was politically motivated
and that the defendants who had
been "swept up" by the emotion
al fervor deserved a lighter sen
tence.
Judge Friedman ruled,
though, that "each of the
accused had the direct intention
of killing the deceased." He took
eight and a half hours over two
days to read out his 190-page
decision in the non-jury trial.
Ntamo, 23, was convicted on
the basis of his confession that
he struck Biehl with a brick on
the head three times, the judge
said. He was also convicted of the
additional charge of public vio
lence.
Originally, there were seven
defendants. But on the first day
of the trial, Nov. 22, charges were
dropped against three because a
key witness said he was afraid to
testify. The fourth defendant, a
minor, was put in custody of his
parents. He later ran away, but
has since been found and will be
tried separately.
