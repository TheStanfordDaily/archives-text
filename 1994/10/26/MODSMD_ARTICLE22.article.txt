# In the election limelight
## Economists discuss the sorry state economy 
### Pamela Phan 
Focusing on California's current economic
situation and the upcoming state elections,
two prominent Stanford economics profes
sors spoke yesterday at a discussion spon
sored by the University's Center for Econom
ic Policy Research (CEPR).
In a debate titled "Economic Policy in Cal
ifornia and the Gubernatorial Election" held
at the center, Michael Boskin and Paul Krug
man addressed a crowd composed of CEPR
associates and fellow members of the Stan
ford economics department.
"[These are] difficult times for anyone try
ing to do economic policy," said Krugman,
who is working for Kathleen Brown's guber
natorial campaign. The economy has become
a "hot-water" issue in politics and one of the
prevailing issues in this year's race, he said.
Krugman attributes California's economic

difficulties to its disproportionate reliance on
three flailing industries — defense, aerospace
and real estate. He sees the California slump
worsened by the state's current policy of
excess taxes, excess regulation, inadequate
infrastructure and an inadequate work force.
Brown's economic plan attempts to bring in
new revenue by providing tax credits and
allowances for new businesses, he said.
"If you read her plan, the arithmetic just
doesn't add up," said Boskin, who is current
ly supporting Pete Wilson in his campaign
against Brown.
Boskin said he believes that much like the
Dukakis plan in 1988 and the Clinton plan in
1992, the Brown plan attacks the private sec
tor and sets up too many new government
programs.
Wilson has managed to stabilize the state's
general fund spending even though the legis
lature has wanted to spend more and inflation

has changed the value of the dollar, Boskin
said. Wilson's economic policy involves spend
ing control, decreasing taxes, regulatory
reform, worker's compensation reform and
tort reform.
Wilson and Brown have diverged on most
of the big issues, including NAFTA, worker's
compensation, and property tax. One of the
biggest issues dividing them in the current
race is Proposition 187 — which would deny
public services to illegal immigrants in Cali
fornia.
Both Boskin and Krugman are professors in
the Economics Department. Boskin has been
with Stanford since 1970. He is currently a fel
low at the Hoover Institute. Krugman spent
time at the MIT before coming to Stanford.
Yesterday's discussion was one of the first
in a series of monthly discussions held by
CEPR to explore current issues in America's
economic policy.
