## Health care reform hits home at campus facilities Stanford medical community may fill new role in a national system 
### Jing-Chyi Chao 
Health care reform — although
it has been proposed, debated,
haggled over, and dissected in the
past year, its fate remains uncer

tain.
What is certain, however, is that
such reform will have a seismic
effect on American health care,
rocking providers and patients
across the country.

As a leading center for medical
treatment, teaching, and research,
the Stanford medical community
will certainly feel the shockwaves
of any new legislation. Stanford
experts remain divided, however,
on what the precise impact of
reform may be.
Under any of the various plans
being considered by Congress,
Stanford would offer a limited
variety of specialized care in order
to control costs. According to Dr.
William Fowkes, co-director of the
Division of Family and Communi
ty Medicine at the Medical Cen
ter, more Stanford programs
would be directed towards com
munity involvement with an
emphasis on primaiy care.
Co-director Dr. Halstead Hol
man said he believes that the pri
mary issues of health care reform
are comprehensiveness of health
care coverage and cost control. In
California, extensive use of man
aged care— one of the options in a
reformed health system— has
been proposed to address these
issues.
Stanford has already contract
ed with different managed care
corporations to ensure a steady
supply of patients. "Cost pres
sures are requiring new working
relationships between primary
care doctors and specialists," Hol
man said. "Specialists [will]
become more accessible to prima
ry care doctors and more involved
in the delivery of care in the com
munity. "

Partnerships with these
health management organiza
tions, or HMOs, often result in
insufficient funding to cover the
cost of running a clinic or a hos
pital. This problem, according
to Holman, may be addressed
by reducing expenses through
the reorganization of Stanford's

medical care distribution system.
The movement towards a
national health care system will
also affect the way in which medi
cal students are trained.
According to Richard Jacob,
the executive assistant to the vice
president and Dean of the Medical
School, this will be difficult,
because the school cannot require
students to choose a specific field
of employment. In the future,
Jacob predicted that medical stu
dents may be placed in outpatient
settings more often to give the
students experience in primary
care.
There has been pressure from
the government to increase the
number of medical students
entering the field of primary care
from the present level of 30 per
cent to 50 percent. Government
loan programs provide students
with incentives to enter general
practice.
"We have already seen a trend
in the past few years on the part
of the government to attach
strings to financial aid," Jacob
said.
Currently, more medical school
graduates are considering prima

ry care, a factor which may be
attributed to the national interest
in health care reform. Despite the
increase, the overall rate is still
low. This can be ascribed more to
lifestyle choices rather than
money, Jacob said.
Students prefer specialties that
use current technology to general
practice, which involves longer
hours and a broader field of work.
"When you're dealing with a
primary care physician who hands
off the care of a patient to a more
specialized doctor, there is a per
ception [among students] that it
is intellectually less exciting,"
Jacob said.
In addition to publicizing family
practice to students, a new health
plan would emphasize increasing
basic health services research.
According to Dr. Branimir
Sikic, program director of the
General Clinical Research Center
at the Medical Center, a national
health care system may also
emphasize clinical research that
could be subject to peer review. In
terms of funding, federal, local,
and state funding for research has
been decreasing over the past 30
years from a prime of 65 to 70 per
cent in 1966 to less than 4C
percent currently.

Stanford Health Services, or
SHS, is a management body
formed early this year in response
to Stanford's budgetary losses
due to competition with HMOs.
SHS now oversees the combined
clinical operations of the Stanford
University Hospital, Medical
School, and Stanford Clinic.
SHS will hold managed care
contracts for Stanford and will
coordinate primary and specialty
care. The body allows the Stan
ford medical community to oper
ate more effectively in the rapidly
changing health care environ
ment.
According to SHS president
Peter Van Etten, the Stanford
medical center is at a disadvan
tage when competing with HMOs,
because it must charge more
money for services. The center's
higher costs result from its teach
ing and research facilities.
"We are seeing a fundamental
change in the funding of health
care in a way that unfortunately
does not recognize the unique role
that academic medical centers
such as Stanford play," Van Etten
said. He noted that price primari
