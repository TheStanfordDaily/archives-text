# An apple a day:
## Prescription for illness 
### Cris Niell Staff writer 
Q: I've heard that you can get cancer
from apple seeds. Is this true?
—Johnny Appleseed
A: As far as I've been able to tell,
there is no confirmed link between
apple seeds and cancer. However, I did
come across a disturbing fact. Eating
too many apple seeds can kill you!
In fact, most fruits in the rose family
(which includes apples, peaches, cher
ries, plums, apricots, crabapples, and
almonds) have seeds that contain amyg
dalin.
When amygdalin is digested by the
body, it generates hydrogen cyanide
gas, which is highly toxic. Signs of
cynide poisoning include excitement,
convulsions, respiratory problems,

spasms, and death.
People have died from eat
ing too many seeds. Turkey, a
country that is big on apri
cots, has reported nine deaths
in the past 20 years as a result
of apricot seed overdoses. The
Santa Clara Poison Control
Center knows about the risk
and is prepared to handle any
cases of overzealous seed
munchers.
Of course, the lethal dose
is probably more than most
people eat in a day. It's actual
ly hard to determine, since
various species of fruit have

different amygdalin content, and people
process amygdalin at different rates.
With apple seeds, for example, you
probably want to keep your intake
down to less than a cupful in one sit
ting.
Fortunately, cyanide gas is detoxi
fied and removed from the body fairly
quickly, so you don't have to worry
about it building up over a lifetime of
apple cores. You can also munch away
safely by roasting the seeds, since heat
destroys the amygdalin
Well, this concludes the public safety
portion of today's column. Now onto a
subject of somewhat less urgency.
Q: Why does the hair on your arms
only grow to a certain length and
tnen stop, but the hair on your head
keeps growing?
— hairy and curious
A : Well, in order to answer your
XXquestion I'm going to have to
explain a bit about how hair grows, and
the differences between body hair and
scalp hair (which includes facial hair for
men).
Every hair starts out at the dermal
papilla, the point in the follicle that will
eventually be the root of the hair. The

newly developing hair pushes up out of
the skin, displacing any old hair that
may have been there.
This is the point where male pattern
baldness strikes. The hair begins to
grow, but never gets beyond this peach
fuzz stage. Although it is not under
stood why, where once a leonine mane
flourished, there remains only a shining
expanse.
However, if you're lucky, the hair
will continue growing longer and thick
er. The root will grow deeper into your
skin, until you have luxurious hair wor
thy of a Suave commercial.
I think an interesting aside is in
order at this point. In the past, you
used to be able to cut off all your hair,
and sell it to wig companies. However,
in the U.S. most people can't do this
anymore because their hair is too
clean.

Before people started sham
pooing all the time, they had a
waxy build-up on their hair.
This crud is essential for wigs,
because it keeps the hair from
drying out and becoming brit
tle. Now most real-hair wig
companies get their hair from
Head & Shoulders-deprived
third world countries.
Back to our story. Your
head hair keeps on growing
until it decides it has had
enough, at which point the
root of the hair begins to
shrink, and it eventually falls
out of the follicle.

On the other hand, your body hair
grows for specific length of time, and
then goes into a period of dormancy,
during which it just sits there at the
same length. Eventually, a new hair
will begin growing underneath the
existing one, pushing the old one out.
A lot of people ask, "How does the
hair know how long it is? If you cut it,
can it tell?" Actually, the hair doesn't
know how long it is. It just grows for a
certain length of time, and then quits. If
it's been cut since then, it will end up a
little bit shorter.
The next question you should be ask
ing is, "So why does the hair on your
head keep on growing?" Actually, this
isn't really known, although some
anthropologists have suggested that
hair is for decoration like a peacocks
feathers.
If you put ribbons and bows in your
hair, you are more likely to find a mate
and pass on your genes. So if you think
you have it rough, think about our poor
ancestor who may have had a bad hair
day and ended up driven into extinc
tion.

the differences between body hair and
scalp hair (which includes facial hair for
men).
Every hair starts out at the dermal
papilla, the point in the follicle that will
eventually be the root of the hair. The

newly developing hair pushes up out of
the skin, displacing any old hair that
may have been there.
This is the point where male pattern
baldness strikes. The hair begins to
grow, but never gets beyond this peach
fuzz stage. Although it is not under
stood why, where once a leonine mane
flourished, there remains only a shining
expanse.
However, if you're lucky, the hair
will continue growing longer and thick
er. The root will grow deeper into your
skin, until you have luxurious hair wor
thy of a Suave commercial.
I think an interesting aside is in
order at this point. In the past, you
used to be able to cut off all your hair,
and sell it to wig companies. However,
in the U.S. most people can't do this
anymore because their hair is too
clean.

Before people started sham
pooing all the time, they had a
waxy build-up on their hair.
This crud is essential for wigs,
because it keeps the hair from
drying out and becoming brit
tle. Now most real-hair wig
companies get their hair from
Head & Shoulders-deprived
third world countries.
Back to our story. Your
head hair keeps on growing
until it decides it has had
enough, at which point the
root of the hair begins to
shrink, and it eventually falls
out of the follicle.

On the other hand, your body hair
grows for specific length of time, and
then goes into a period of dormancy,
during which it just sits there at the
same length. Eventually, a new hair
will begin growing underneath the
existing one, pushing the old one out.
A lot of people ask, "How does the
hair know how long it is? If you cut it,
can it tell?" Actually, the hair doesn't
know how long it is. It just grows for a
certain length of time, and then quits. If
it's been cut since then, it will end up a
little bit shorter.
The next question you should be ask
ing is, "So why does the hair on your
head keep on growing?" Actually, this
isn't really known, although some
anthropologists have suggested that
hair is for decoration like a peacocks
feathers.
If you put ribbons and bows in your
hair, you are more likely to find a mate
and pass on your genes. So if you think
you have it rough, think about our poor
ancestor who may have had a bad hair
day and ended up driven into extinc
tion.
