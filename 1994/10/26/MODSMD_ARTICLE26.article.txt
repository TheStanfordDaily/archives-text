# PRK surgery returns sight to the 'blind'
## 
### Julie Sauer Editorial staff 
Stanford ophthalmologists are per
fecting eye surgery that would enablg
patients with serious visual impair
ments to see again.
Photorefractive keratectomy, or
PRK, uses a laser to remove cells from
the surface of the cornea; changing the
curvature of this lens corrects vision
problems like astigmatism and myopia,
or nearsightedness.
Dr. Lee Shahinian, Director of Refrac
tive Surgery at Stanford University Med
ical Center, and the Department of Oph
thalmology are cooperating with the
Broadway Eye Surgery Centre in Van
couver, British Columbia to evaluate
PRK patients and perform the surgery.
The Food and Drug Administration
has not yet approved the operation for
general practice in the United States, so
the surgery occurs at the Canadian clin
ic. Patients are diagnosed at the Stan
ford Eye Clinic, however, before travel
ling to Canada for treatment.
The laser treatment corrects myopia
and astigmatism. Patients that are near
sighted have a healthy cornea and lens,
but the eye is too long. As a result, light
focuses in front of the retina; the condi
tion can be corrected by placing a con
cave lens in front of the eye.
PRK induces concavity on the corneal
surface by flattening the lens, making it
less convex.
Patients with astigmatism have
unhealthy corneas: the varying curvature
of the cornea alters the focus of light com
ing to different parts of the surface lens.
As a result, light focuses on the retina as
a 'smear' rather than a point focus.
PRK corrects astigmatism by treating
the cornea more in one meridian than in
the other to compensate for the eye's
natural asymmetry.
Shahinian likened the human eye to a

camera.
"[The eye]
has lenses
in front
that
light onto a
film in the
back.
That's how
you get a
picture,"
h e
explained.
The eye
contains a
lens behind
the iris, as
well as the
surface
cornea
lens.
"We're
concerned
with the
front lens,
the cornea,
that does
most of the
focusing of
light on the
retina,"

Shahinian said. The retina is the 'film' of
the eye.
The excimer laser used in the optical
surgery emits highly energetic ultravio
let photons; the pulses remove corneal
cells by breaking the molecular bonds
rather than by heating the tissue. Short
hydrocarbon chains resulting from the
bond-breaking actions of the laser come
off the cornea as a 'plume' or 'smoke.'
"The tissue literally vaporizes, or dis
appears," Shahinian said. "This [vapor
ization] is called 'photo ablation' from
very energetic photons, as opposed to a
thermal or heating effect."
Each laser pulse removes one quarter of a
micron of tissue. The total amount of cells

'vaporized'
by the
surgery
depends on
the degree of
lens correc
tion neces
sary for the
each patient.
Approxi
mately ten
microns of
tissue are
removed for
each diopter
of correc
tion. The
total tissue
removed in
most cases
comprises
less than ten
percent of
the corneal
thickness.

patient must focus on a red light beam to
keep the eye steady during surgery. The
patient's head is immobilized and the
eyelid propped open by a flange while the
laser operates for intervals of a few sec
onds.
The entire operation is an outpatient
procedure taking less than 30 minutes.
Sue Beckham, a graduate student in
organic chemistry at Stanford, elected to
receive PRK treatment for her severe
myopia.
Beckham relates that the odor of
singed tissue could be detected during
the laser surgery. "It was the same kind
of smell as the smell at the dentist's
office when he drills a tooth," she said.
After surgery, ophthalmologists
bandage the newly corrected eye with a
soft contact lens that keeps air away
from the sensitive tissue.
Beckham's surgery on one eye
occurred in February 1994; she now has
one corrected eye and wears a contact
lens on the other eye.
"We weren't expecting it to be that
good," she said of the PRK results. "I can
read the eye chart [with the corrected eye]
as well as or better than with contacts."
The success of PRK makes it an
attractive alternative to radial keratoto
my, or RK, where the surgeon uses a
hand-held diamond knife to make deep
radial cuts through 90 percent of the
corneal thickness.
The cuts cause the peripheral
cornea to bulge â€” as this happens, the
central cornea flattens. The flattening
of the central cornea corrects myopia.
However, 15 to 20 percent of RK
patients develop late overcorrection,
because the incisions never completely
heal.
"That kind of instability bothers
us," Shahinian admitted. "I think
that's why we'll see RK disappear as
the laser procedure [PRK] becomes
approved and accepted."
