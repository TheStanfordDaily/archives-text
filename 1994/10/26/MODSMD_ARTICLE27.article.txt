## Men's soccer loses to USF in sleeper Loss ends streak but team still looks ahead 
### Joseph Hei Staff writer 
Stanford O
USF 3

The Stanford men's soccer team was sup
posed to play a friendly but competitive game
against the University of San Francisco yes
terday. However, the match turned out to be
more like a slumber party.
The Cardinal (4-10-2) lost 3-0 to the Dons
(6-6-2) on Maloney Field in a contest that did
nothing to warm up the chilled fans. The score
is deceptive in that neither team played at its
best.
"Both teams were in the same boat," said
senior goalkeeper Jim Masetti. "We came out
flat. In the first half it almost seemed like
nobody was playing. After their first goal
though, USF woke up."
Ironically, the Dons did not even score their
first goal themselves. Cardinal junior mid
fielder Chet Zimmer accidentally kicked the
ball into his own net when he was trying to
clear it.
After a sloppy San Francisco goal that
nonetheless went in, the match heated up a bit
as the dormant Cardinal struggled to catch
up.
Stanford was set up with many opportuni
ties to score off of well-executed plays. In
the second half, junior defender Mark Walk
er crossed a ball to freshman midfielder Eric
Vandevelde, to head the ball in for what
would have been his sixth goal of the season.
However, the shot bounced off the goalpost.
Other scoring efforts by Stanford were simi
larly fruitless.
"Those shots have to go in," said head coach
Colin Lindores.
A third looping shot from the Dons sealed
their win.
The playing styles of both teams are very
similar in that both utilize indirect passing
tactics and attempt to slowly work the ball
up the field. While both teams stuck with
this subtle, less-forward-kicking style, the
game did not live up to its billing as an
attractive contest that would showcase good,
sophisticated soccer.
The Dons are not in the Mountain Division
and so the game did not figure in the Cardi
nal's chances at winning the division. Unfor
tunately, this fact apparently deflated Stan
ford's desire to play and secure a win.
"It would have been nice to keep the win
ning streak going," Masetti said. "But we have
to keep [the loss] in perspective."
However, Stanford is in a very delicate
situation in that it cannot afford to lose or
tie any remaining league games. The game
was scheduled as a link between the major
upset Stanford dealt Fresno State last week
and Stanford's crucial conference match

versus California this Sunday.
"We're not a team that is so sophisticated
that we can just turn it on or turn it off,"
Lindores said. "A win is important. I
thought we were very lethargic out there
today and I'm disappointed that the players
didn't step up. We're also at a point where
the young players must demonstrate an
interest in winning games, or at least trying
to."

Lindores' comments are especially relevant
considering the number of underclassmen in
the lineup due to injuries suffered by estab
lished starters. One of the goals the Cardinal
has developed this season is to evaluate
younger players and allow them game time in
a rebuilding process for next season.
For now, Stanford mdst shake off the disap
pointment of this loss before faceing the Bears
in a crucial test of their conference mettle.
