a candidate for professional psychiatric help.

Hi, my name is Kathiyn and I have recurring
nightmares about being arrogant enough and
stupid enough to personally invite BUI Walsh over
to dinner at Wilbur.
Irrational fear grips me every time I consider
the possibilities. Fourth-grade self-esteem efforts
are all for naught as I reevaluate my slime mold
status in the food chain. How can I handle being
less important than a hair appointment or a gar
dening chore?
But what if Bill accepts? What will I wear?
Does a haute couture black chiffon dress go better
with the white baseball cap or the blue one?
Should I stick with the Tevas or the go with the
Nikes? What if I spend endless hours curling,
crimping, teasing, spraying and coaxing my hair
in some nouveau style only to panic and throw on
my baseball cap at the last moment? Chalk it up
to another bad hair day.
And my room. I'll become exactly what I've
feared of becoming all my life — a spitting image
of my mother. Will I rant and rave and yell at Tina
my roommate for her to pick up her lacy under

around the left end to avoid the

that kind of rushing attack with

Before I go and commit that
kind of faux pas at the dinner
table, I'll be forewarned that any
topics concerning roses, Trojans,
devils or defense are verboten.

George Seifert seems to be doing
just fine as the 49ers' head coach
are inappropriate.
These nightmares have
plagued my Stanford career ever
since day one ....
Freshman year in front of
Encina Gym — I was going in to
interview Colin Lindores, the
men's soccer coach. I'll never for
get what happened next — it was
the most embarrassing moment

in my life.
A gentleman who fits the
approximate size and description
of Colin Lindores steps out of his
car and heads for the Encina
offices. I, like the impetuous dolt I
was, yelled out, "Coach, can I
have a word with you?"
Instead of Colin Lindores, Bill
Walsh turned around, and I (like
the stupid metaphor of a deer,
headlights and blah, blah, blah)
bolted towards my bike, slipped
on the gravel in front of Encina
and knocked over a whole row of
other bikes — in other words I
made a complete fool out of
myself — before pedaling out of
his view.
Ever since then I haven't been
able to convince myself to attend a
press conference or request an
interview with the man, let alone
invite him to dinner. Even his pic
ture in the paper makes me
squirm.
I think Freud would say that
my dreams are trying to tell me
that I was a complete moron.
