# Prop. 186's writer sells his system

### Martin L. Yeung 
Warning of spiraling costs and
economic losses, Vishwanath Lin
gappa, a professor of internal
medicine at UC-San Francisco,
addressed a crowd of 50 at Jordan
Hall hoping to convince them
Proposition 186 would provide a
significantly cheaper and more ef
ficient alternative to private in
surance.
Lingappa, a co-author of the
measure, said a state financed
system that would be established
under the proposition could
squeeze out billions in waste
every year — waste that could be
spent on expanding medical care
for the one in five Californians not
covered by insurance.
"Currently, we spend 15 per
cent of every health care dollar on
bureaucracy and paperwork
alone," Lingappa said. "Once we
eliminate the waste, the savings
in time and money can be invest
ed into improving the quality of
care. Doctors can see more
patients because they aren't
wasting time filling out forms."
If Proposition 186, the "single
payer plan" passes, it will make
the state government the major
financier of health insurance in
California.
The state would control costs
by reducing bureaucracy, negoti
ating fees and services with
health care providers, Lingappa
said. The new system would cover
everyone, including illegal aliens,
and would be financed by existing
state and federal revenue, and an
increase on cigarette and payroll
taxes.
But the tax increases and de
facto elimination of private
health insurance in the state
have pitted powerful interests

against the proposition, he said.
Some have argued the plan would
limit choice, reduee quality, cost
jobs and create a bureaucracy
less responsive than the current
one by concentrating power in
the hands of a health commis
sioner.
Lingappa insisted, however,
that patients are free to choose
their own doctor and the range of
benefits would be equal if not
superior to what most plans offer
currently. And doctors would
actually have more discretion in
prescribing treatment without
having to worry about "the bot
tom line."
"Doctors are being harassed
now by paperwork, having to jus
tify ever expense they make to the
insurance companies," Lingappa
said.
He emphasized that the com
missioner would be democratical
ly elected and would be required
to hold hearings on any fee hikes.
Also, no additional tax increases
could be implemented without a
two-thirds legislative vote
"Unlike a corporate board
room, if you don't like what the

commissioner is doing, it gets
profiled on the news and you can
vote him or her out of office," he
said.
Lingappa also countered
claims of job flight and how
increased taxes would hurt small
business. He said workers are
afraid to leave jobs for fear of not
being able to get health insur
ance. Also, the rising costs of
health care create a significant
impediment to economic develop
ment. Lingappa contended that
California would actually be a job
magnet when Proposition 186
holds down costs.
Supporters of the proposition
say it would provide comprehen
sive health insurance for all Cali
fornians regardless of ability to
pay or preexisting condition, Lin
gappa said, adding that it triples
the budget for public health and
preventative care.
"These people wait until they
are very sick, they don't go [to
doctors] because they're unin
sured," he said. By taking proac
tive measures, the state would
save hundreds of millions of dol
lars in emergency room costs.
