# Lady kickers look to dominate Dons
## 
### Jeremy Stone Staff writer 
Add women's soccer to the
list of college sports that thrive
in the Bay Area.
The two best records in the
entire West Region are at stake
in today's 3 p.m. match-up at
Maloney Field. Unranked Uni
versity of San Francisco enters
with a 12-2-1 mark and was the
next-to-last team to fall from
the ranks of the unbeaten and
untied.
Meanwhile, the last team to
sustain a blemish to its record is
No. 3 Stanford (12-1), which
holds the second-best record in
the nation, behind only top
ranked Notre Dame (15-0-1).
The Dons exploded to the
fastest start in school history by
winning their first 11 games,
breaking the school mark for
wins in an entire season in the
process. Even while unbeaten,
however, they failed to obtain
respect, as they never entered
the national rankings. The
team's first half against Santa
Clara shattered any visions of
perfection, as the Broncos rolled
to a 6-0 lead before intermission.
Since that debacle on Oct. 12,
the Dons have continued to strug
gle, tying California (3-8-4) and
losing 4-0 to No. 20 St. Mary's.
USF finally registered an unim
pressive 1-0 victory over Division
II UC-Davis in its last outing.
"Obviously, they're going to
be a very confident team coming
in with their record," said head
coach lan Sawyers. "Playing a
higher caliber team like Santa
Clara and Cal, obviously, was
maybe a little bit of a shock to
some of their players. They're
going to be coming hard at us

now to try and prove to every
body that their schedule isn't a
fluke."
With nine freshmen, the
inexperienced Dons were not
expected to jump out to an 11-0
mark considering their sched
ule. Goalkeeper Amy Voiland
factored in as a mtyor reason for
the quick run out of the gates,
ranking among the national
leaders in tending until the
Santa Clara game. For the sea
son, she has a solid 1.07 goals
against average, but only 27
saves in 13 contests.
For the Dons, however, the
offense has done most of the
talking. Despite a recent slump,
USF's 3.20 goals-per-game
average ranks a close second in
the West Region to the Cardi
nal. Midfielders Jannik Abel
and Kelli Bryant form one of the
most potent one-two punches in
the nation. Abel's 34 points
place her in a tie for 20th in the
nation in scoring, with 12 goals
and 10 assists. Bryant leads the
squad with 13 goals and has 33
points overall.
While the Dons' offense has
been silenced in recent games,
the Stanford attack has shown
signs of breaking out. With
three goals in a 12-minute span
near the end of Sunday's 4-2
victory over Nebraska, the Car
dinal posted its largest output
since a 9-0 thrashing of Yale in
mid-September.
Junior midfielder Carmel
Murphy paved the way. Mur
phy, who scored nine times last
year but had only two goals in
1994 entering last weekend's
play, notched her first career
multi-goal games.
"She did a hell of a job this
