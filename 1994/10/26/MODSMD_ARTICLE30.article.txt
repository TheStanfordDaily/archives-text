# Lady kickers look to dominate Dons
## 
### Jeremy Stone Staff writer 
Add women's soccer to the
list of college sports that thrive
in the Bay Area.
The two best records in the
entire West Region are at stake
in today's 3 p.m. match-up at
Maloney Field. Unranked Uni
versity of San Francisco enters
with a 12-2-1 mark and was the
next-to-last team to fall from
the ranks of the unbeaten and
untied.
Meanwhile, the last team to
sustain a blemish to its record is
No. 3 Stanford (12-1), which
holds the second-best record in
the nation, behind only top
ranked Notre Dame (15-0-1).
The Dons exploded to the
fastest start in school history by
winning their first 11 games,
breaking the school mark for
wins in an entire season in the
process. Even while unbeaten,
however, they failed to obtain
respect, as they never entered
the national rankings. The
team's first half against Santa
Clara shattered any visions of
perfection, as the Broncos rolled
to a 6-0 lead before intermission.
Since that debacle on Oct. 12,
the Dons have continued to strug
gle, tying California (3-8-4) and
losing 4-0 to No. 20 St. Mary's.
USF finally registered an unim
pressive 1-0 victory over Division
II UC-Davis in its last outing.
"Obviously, they're going to
be a very confident team coming
in with their record," said head
coach lan Sawyers. "Playing a
higher caliber team like Santa
Clara and Cal, obviously, was
maybe a little bit of a shock to
some of their players. They're
going to be coming hard at us

now to try and prove to every
body that their schedule isn't a
fluke."
With nine freshmen, the
inexperienced Dons were not
expected to jump out to an 11-0
mark considering their sched
ule. Goalkeeper Amy Voiland
factored in as a mtyor reason for
the quick run out of the gates,
ranking among the national
leaders in tending until the
Santa Clara game. For the sea
son, she has a solid 1.07 goals
against average, but only 27
saves in 13 contests.
For the Dons, however, the
offense has done most of the
talking. Despite a recent slump,
USF's 3.20 goals-per-game
average ranks a close second in
the West Region to the Cardi
nal. Midfielders Jannik Abel
and Kelli Bryant form one of the
most potent one-two punches in
the nation. Abel's 34 points
place her in a tie for 20th in the
nation in scoring, with 12 goals
and 10 assists. Bryant leads the
squad with 13 goals and has 33
points overall.
While the Dons' offense has
been silenced in recent games,
the Stanford attack has shown
signs of breaking out. With
three goals in a 12-minute span
near the end of Sunday's 4-2
victory over Nebraska, the Car
dinal posted its largest output
since a 9-0 thrashing of Yale in
mid-September.
Junior midfielder Carmel
Murphy paved the way. Mur
phy, who scored nine times last
year but had only two goals in
1994 entering last weekend's
play, notched her first career
multi-goal games.
"She did a hell of a job this
weekend, actually," Sawyers said.
"When the backs are against the
wall, you see what type of players
you have. Carmel Murphy just
took the game by the scruff of the
neck and decided, 'Hey, I'm going
to change this.' That's what you
love to see in your franchise play
ers."
Murphy's heroics overshad
owed the fine performances of
other Cardinal players. Sopho
more forward Erin Martin, who
hadn't scored in three games,
racked up two assists and scored
her tenth goal of the year to move
into a tie for eighth in the West
Region.
Junior Dena Dey returned to
the scoring column for the first
time in three weeks with a goal
and an assist. Freshman midfield
er Elie Foster recorded her first
official assist, and junior forward
Julie Bushman, who led UC-Santa
Barbara in assists the last two sea
sons but was searching for playing
time as a Cardinal, came through
for one assist and a team-high four
shots on goal versus Colorado Col
lege.
Defensively, both the Tigers
and Cornhuskers failed to get off
many shots, but made the most
of their rare attempts. Nebraska
became the first team to score
twice in a game against Stanford
all season, but mustered only

three shots on goal.
Senior goalkeeper Jennifer
Poehler failed to record a save
against Nebraska but still
remained among the nation's
leaders in goalkeeping with a
.610 GAA, good for 10th place.
"Both the goals were defen
sive breakdowns," Sawyers
said. "When you're pushing and
really striving to get a lot of
offense created, you're always
going to leave yourself a little
vulnerable to counter-attacks
or to getting caught defensive
ly. I wish we had that kind of
ratio. If we'd take three shots
and score two goals, we would
have scored a lot of goals this
year."
Junior sweeper and consensus
All-American Jessica Fischer was
not to blame for the defensive
mishaps over the weekend. The
San Diego native was selected as
one of 10 finalists for the Missouri
Athletic Club Sports Foundation
Collegiate Player of the Year.
Fischer, who has never missed
a start in her collegiate career, will
probably get more defensive help
this weekend from senior Anna
Patitucci.
The team's top defensive mid
fielder played only sparingly in
Boulder while still recovering
from the knee injury that side
lined her for five games. Sopho
more midfielder Wendy Latimer,
who sat out the weekend with a
foot injury, is questionable for
today.
