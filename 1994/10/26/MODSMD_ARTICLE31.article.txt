# Crew impressive at Charles

Despite a collision between the
Cardinal men's team and the Uni
versity of Wisconsin's boat, Stan
ford crew established itself as a
national force last Sunday at the
Head of the Charles regatta in
Boston. The women's team fin
ished ninth, beating out the Cali
fornia Bears by 14 seconds, while
the men took 30th in a strong field
of crews.
The Stanford women's team
turned in the biggest surprise of
the weekend. Stacked against
crews which had been rowing for
at least three weeks more than the
Cardinal, the women beat all its
competition aside from perennial
east coast powerhouse teams such
as RadclifTe, Yale and Brown.
"I didn't expect them to do as
well as they did this early," said
Joselyn McCandles, head coach of
the women's team. "Also, this
was a good place to excel since it is
the largest single rowing event in
the world. Over 1,000 boats and
4,000 individual rowers raced this
weekend."
Senior captain Sue Becker
agreed. "This finish gives us
much more prominence on the
national scene," she said.
The women's final time of 17
minutes, 20 seconds was also
impressive because the Cardinal
rowed at a much lower stroke rate
than the rest of the entries in the
race. Stanford kept pace with the
best crews in the country while
rowing only 29 strokes per
minute, while crews like Yale
rowed 34 strokes in a minute.
The men also looked strong in
the beginning of their race, stay
ing with top-ranked Wisconsin for
two-thirds of the contest. Howev
er, Stanford's hopes of a top finish
were dashed as Wisconsin took a
turn too sharply and rammed the
Cardinal from behind.
A poor start by Wisconsin actu
ally worked to Stanford's advan
tage in the first two-thirds of the
race as the Cardinal kept the Bad
gers from passing. In the end, it was
this frustration that forced the col

lision after the Wisconsin coxswain
turned her boat too sharply, and
the oars from both boats locked up.
After the collision, Stanford
did not recover its composure as
quickly as the Wisconsin team,
and ended up 30th while the Bad
gers finished in tenth place.
Despite the collision, men's head
coach Wieslaw Kujda was pleased
with the results.
"The trip was excellent. The
guys were psyched, and there was
a lot of support in Boston for Stan
ford," he said. "Wisconsin proba

bly would have finished first, and
Stanford seventh, if the crash had
not occurred. We took a fight with
a faster crew and proved to our
selves that we can compete."
Josh Burgel, senior captain of
the men's team, thought the Car
dinal gained an indication of both
where it stands, and what lies in
its future.
"This race showed us where we
were in relation to the rest of the
crews in the country, and refo
cused our energy for future regat
tas," he said.
