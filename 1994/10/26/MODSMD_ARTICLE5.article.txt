## ASSU dons new uniforms to approve its allocations 
### Kevin Wack Staff writer 
Donning their new uniforms for the first time,
the ASSU Senate approved allocations to the Publi
cations Board, the Community Service Board and
the Program Board at its meeting last night.
The Appropriations Committee reported its
funding recommendations to the full senate, and all
three proposals passed unamended.
Most senators in attendance were wearing the
sweatshirts they received yesterday and are man
dated to wear under the ASSU Constitution. The
sweatshirts read "What's an ASSU Senator?" on
the front, and "I'm an ASSU Senator, Silly!" on the
back.
The most lively discussion in the meeting came
during the debate over Community Service Board
allocations.
Graduate senator Donald Aingworth proposed
an amendment to the bill which would have provid
ed the Sexual Health Peer Resource Center the en
tire $3,680 they requested. The Appropriations
Committee had recommended the group be given
$1,365.
Aingworth accused members of the committee of
being "homophobic," pointing out that they recom
mended providing $700 of the $1000 requested for
condoms, but none of the $30 requested for dental
dams.
"I think this group is one of the most important
on campus," Aingworth said.
Appropriations Committee Co-Chair Marc Op
penheimer said he was offended by Aingworth's
claim that the committee is homophobic.
He noted that the sexual health center is consid
ered the campus resource for heterosexuals, while
the Ye Olde Safer Sex Shoppe is
considered to serve the gay, les
bian and bisexual communities.
Oppenheimer then pointed out
that Ye Olde Safer Sex Shoppe
received a greater percentage —
66 percent — of the funding it
requested than the Sexual Health
Peer Resource Center did. He
also explained in-depth the com
mittee's reasoning on funding
specific items.
In any case, Aingworth's
amendment was defeated and
the Community Service Board

allocations were passed un
changed.
Deputy Senate Chair Michael
Choo announced plans to provide
buses for students to take to Big
Game, which will be held Nov. 19
in Berkeley this year. Choo said
that round-trip tickets would cost
$10 and that students can call the
ASSU for information.
Lastly, Council of Presidents
member Mork Murdock an
nounced that there would be two
forums open to all students to
suggest changes to the special-fee
refund process. The first will be
held tonight at the Kimball
lounge, and the second on Thurs
day evening in the Hacienda
Commons in Rains.
