# Statue repair costs debated at hearing
## Damage estimates still sticking point 
### Justin Pollard Staff writer 
The cost of the repair to the
"Gay Liberation" sculpture was
the main point of contention at
yesterday's preliminary hearing
for senior Thomas Irwin, who was
charged with felony vandalism of
the sculpture last May.
According to California law, if
the vandalism damage exceeds
$5,000, the crime is considered a
felony.
The University assessed the
sculpture's already finished re
pairs at $9,400, while Irwin's at
torney John Hackmann main
tained that the damage is less than
$5,000, and that consequently, the
charge should be lowered to a mis
demeanor.
Irwin and former Stanford stu
dent Todd Laßocca were the only
two students charged with felonies
in the case, in which seven students
were arrested for pouring black
paint on and wedging a park bench
in the George Segal sculpture.
Laßocca pled no contest last
month, while four of the students
were charged with misdemeanors,

and another student allegedly in
volved was not charged with any
crime. Irwin's third preliminary
hearing is scheduled for Nov. 15.
During the hearing, which was a
continuation of Irwin's Oct. 17
hearing, Hackmann asked if the
cost of repairs included damage
done to the statue before the vandal
ism incident and questioned
whether the previous damage would
have merited repairs on its own.
Susan Roberts-Manganelli, the
head of conservation and registra
tion for the Stanford Art Museum,
testified, though, that "the work
would not have been done had the
vandalism not occurred."
The approximate value of the
sculpture was $400,000, Roberts-
Manganelli said, basing her esti
mate on the selling prices of other
Segal works.
The sculpture had suffered dam
age before the vandalism, but it
"was minor and we planned to have
it touched up," she said, rather than
repaint the entire statue.
Roberts-Manganelli said she
had planned to do the work herself,
using a paint sprayer which would
have cost $15 to $20.
But the same paint sprayer
would not have repaired the May
vandalism, she said, "because
black paint had been poured over
the entire sculpture," whereas the
previous damage, graffiti, had
been in "a very limited area."
"It's like if you had a dent in
your car and then someone came
along and broadsided you," said
Deputy District Attorney Valerie
Marchant. "When you repair your
car door for being broadsided, you
will also repair the dent," but the
dent alone would not have merited
the restoration.
Hackmann questioned whether
repairs could have been done for

less than Stanford paid.
"I think there are other repair
shops who would charge less than
$5,000," he said.
The only estimate that the Uni
versity received for the repairs
came from art restorer Tracy
Power, who repaired the statue,
Roberts-Manganelli said.
The University chose Power for
the restoration because she was
one of only three restorers in the
Bay Area qualified to make the
necessary repairs, and she "knew
the statue more than anyone
else," Roberts-Manganelli said.
"The amount of necessary
damage was well over $5,000,"
Marchant said.
"I hope it will settle in Superior
Court," she said, although Irwin
turned down the previous offer of
200 hours of community service
and felony probation.

"It is not in IHackmann's]
client's best interests to go to jury
trial," she added.
However, Hackmann said that
there remain issues over the value
of the repair and possible "dis
criminatory enforcement of the
law." He said his client "was not
treated equally," because he was
one of the two individuals charged
with felonies.
"Young people screw up, and
punishment must follow, but it
must be properly in consideration
of the welfare of the young per
son," Hackmann said. "We have to
look at the long-term effects on
the individual.
While this sort of felony does
not currently fall under the three
strikes law recently passed in Cal
ifornia, a future amendment to
that law could make it count as a
"strike" retroactively, he added.
