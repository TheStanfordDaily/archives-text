# Statue repair costs debated at hearing
## Damage estimates still sticking point 
### Justin Pollard Staff writer 
The cost of the repair to the
"Gay Liberation" sculpture was
the main point of contention at
yesterday's preliminary hearing
for senior Thomas Irwin, who was
charged with felony vandalism of
the sculpture last May.
According to California law, if
the vandalism damage exceeds
$5,000, the crime is considered a
felony.
The University assessed the
sculpture's already finished re
pairs at $9,400, while Irwin's at
torney John Hackmann main
tained that the damage is less than
$5,000, and that consequently, the
charge should be lowered to a mis
demeanor.
Irwin and former Stanford stu
dent Todd Laßocca were the only
two students charged with felonies
in the case, in which seven students
were arrested for pouring black
paint on and wedging a park bench
in the George Segal sculpture.
Laßocca pled no contest last
month, while four of the students
were charged with misdemeanors,

and another student allegedly in
volved was not charged with any
crime. Irwin's third preliminary
hearing is scheduled for Nov. 15.
During the hearing, which was a
continuation of Irwin's Oct. 17
hearing, Hackmann asked if the
cost of repairs included damage
done to the statue before the vandal
ism incident and questioned
whether the previous damage would
have merited repairs on its own.
Susan Roberts-Manganelli, the
head of conservation and registra
tion for the Stanford Art Museum,
testified, though, that "the work
would not have been done had the
vandalism not occurred."
The approximate value of the
sculpture was $400,000, Roberts-
Manganelli said, basing her esti
mate on the selling prices of other
Segal works.
The sculpture had suffered dam
age before the vandalism, but it
"was minor and we planned to have
it touched up," she said, rather than
repaint the entire statue.
Roberts-Manganelli said she
had planned to do the work herself,
using a paint sprayer which would
