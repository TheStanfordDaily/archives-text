# 'Most of what we think we know is framed by the press'
## Sununu talks politics, bashes media 
### Brian Singer Contributing writer 
Not missing an opportunity to blast the media
for "a healthy dose" of bias and ignorance, former
White House Chief of Staff John Sununu analyzed
the fall of the Soviet Union and made electoral pre
dictions in a speech at Memorial Auditorium yes
terday.
Sununu, who currently hosts Crossfire on CNN,
also took questions from some of about 600 people.
"Most of what we think we know is framed by
the press," he said. "Quite often what is being de
fined as reality is different from the real situation."
Sununu said society underestimates the signifi
cance of the fall of the Soviet Union and its effect on
the international political structure.
"The climate is extremely different," he said.
"The Devil is gone. It was always clear who was on
what side. Now the world may be less dangerous,
but the fact is it is much more complicated."
He attributed the restraint of open racial hostil
ity in former Yugoslavia to Soviet control. "Now,
tragically, with confrontation gone, people have
the 'luxury' of exercising distaste. Sometimes the
Devil is a handy thing to have," Sununu said.
Now, Sununu said, Cuba and the U.S. Congress
are the only two places not committed to
capitalism.
He said one commonly misperceived reality is
that the U.S; economy is the strongest and most
competitive in the world, citing the virtual Ameri
can monopoly on computer Central Processing
Units.
"We don't make a lot of chips. We don't make
most of the chips," he said. "We make every single
chip."

John Sununu, former White House Chief of Staff and current host
of CNN's Crossfire, speaks at Memorial Auditorium last night.
Sununu applauded the push
toward privitization of industry
everywhere but in New York,
where Gov. Mario Cuomo,
Sununu said, is "trying to nation
alize the world."
Domestically, Sununu said
the upcoming election as well as
the 1996 presidential election
will have a profound effect on the
future direction of the U.S. "We
are about to close out this year
beginning a two-year cycle to
comprise the most hotly contest
ed elections ever," he said.
Analyzing the upcoming con
gressional elections, Sununu pre
dicts the Democrats will lose 28 to

30 seats in the House and around
six seats in the Senate. A Republi
can increase to 208 total seats
will, Sununu said, create a "work
ing majority on issues," despite
the fact Republicans will not have
an actual majority.
However, Sununu said that
"the most interesting are the elec
tions in governors' races,"
because of the political implica
tions of the 1996 presidential
election. "There's a difference in
the way issues are framed by gov
ernors versus the way they're
framed by Washington,"he said,
adding that this worked to Presi
dent Clinton's advantage in the
1992 election.
This same reference point
could aid Clinton's reelection bid,
Sununu said. "In '96, Clinton is
less vulnerable than most Repub

licans think," Sununu said. "He
can make sweet lemonade out of
sour lemons politically better
than anyone I've seen."
Sununu said there is a one in
three chance that the most popu
lous eight states could have
Republican governors in 1995. He
predicted that California Gov.
Pete Wilson will defeat Democrat
ic opponent Kathleen Brown and
could be considered a candidate
for president in 1996.
Taking questions from the
audience, Sununu applauded
measures which would subsidize
families for privatized elementary
education, arguing that it needs
competition to prevent self-pollu
tion.
The elementary education
should emulate America's univer
sities, which are, Sununu said,

"the finest universities in the
world."
Sununu said that his engineer
ing background has helped him to
make policy from analysis, not
analysis from policy. "The biggest
problem [with the legally-trained
politicians] is that too much poli
cy is spent by drawing the posi
tion first, then justifying it,"he
said.
Sununu, three-term governor
of New Hampshire, resigned as
President Bush's White House
Chief of Staff in late 1991 under
fire for political use of military
jets. He was also criticized by con
servatives for not accepting criti
cism and advising Bush to renege
on his "no new taxes promise."
Sununu continued as a presiden
tial adviser through March of
1992.
