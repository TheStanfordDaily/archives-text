# 'Most of what we think we know is framed by the press'
## Sununu talks politics, bashes media 
### Brian Singer Contributing writer 
Not missing an opportunity to blast the media
for "a healthy dose" of bias and ignorance, former
White House Chief of Staff John Sununu analyzed
the fall of the Soviet Union and made electoral pre
dictions in a speech at Memorial Auditorium yes
terday.
Sununu, who currently hosts Crossfire on CNN,
also took questions from some of about 600 people.
"Most of what we think we know is framed by
the press," he said. "Quite often what is being de
fined as reality is different from the real situation."
Sununu said society underestimates the signifi
cance of the fall of the Soviet Union and its effect on
the international political structure.
"The climate is extremely different," he said.
"The Devil is gone. It was always clear who was on
what side. Now the world may be less dangerous,
but the fact is it is much more complicated."
He attributed the restraint of open racial hostil
ity in former Yugoslavia to Soviet control. "Now,
tragically, with confrontation gone, people have
the 'luxury' of exercising distaste. Sometimes the
Devil is a handy thing to have," Sununu said.
Now, Sununu said, Cuba and the U.S. Congress
are the only two places not committed to
capitalism.
He said one commonly misperceived reality is
that the U.S; economy is the strongest and most
competitive in the world, citing the virtual Ameri
can monopoly on computer Central Processing
Units.
"We don't make a lot of chips. We don't make
most of the chips," he said. "We make every single
chip."
