# 'Vicious, racist proposal'
## Students protest against Prop 187

"Education not deportation!"
students chanted yesterday at a
noontime White Plaza demon
stration against California
Proposition 187.
Students Together Opposing
Proposition 187 (or STOP 187)
organized the rally — attended
by both Stanford students and
members of surrounding com
munities — in an effort to "create
campus-wide awareness" about
Proposition 187, a ballot initia
tive which would make undocu
mented immigrants ineligible for
public education, public health
and social services.
About 100 people walked out
of classes at 11:30 a.m. to demon
strate their solidarity against the
proposition, and the rally grew to
nearly twice that size later in the
hour.
Senior Glenn Flores, an immi
grant from Belize, said he wanted

to show his support against what
he called a "vicious, racist pro
posal."
"Many of my friends in L.A.
are undocumented and this will
directly affect them, as well as
me," he said.
Senior Mateo Cordova and
graduate student Matthew
Scelza, both members of STOP
187, began the rally by sharing
University President Gerhard
Casper's response to a letter they
had written him on Oct. 17 de
tailing the effects the proposition
could have on the University.
In his reply, Casper men
tioned his appreciation of the
group's efforts but stated that as
president of the University, he
"should not commit the institu
tion to [hisl own personal politi
cal views."
But Scelza noted the impor
tance of Casper's involvement,
pointing out how Proposition
187 — often called the "Save

'Proposition 187 is
beyond harassment.
It's a divisive lie that
attempts to divide
communities of color.'
— Kris Hayashi
Our State" initiative — will
directly affect Stanford.
"There are definitely a lot of
moral and ethical issues involved
here, but we can't forget about
the economic ones," Scelza said.
C6rdova enumerated several
fiscal losses he said could be
expected if the proposition pass
es.
"Proposition 187 costs more
than it saves. Let's assume it
saves $200 million dollars —
which is the most liberal figure
given by the proponents of the
propostion — $15 billion in feder
al funding will be denied to the
state of California and $2.3 bil
lion cut from public schools," he
said. "Proposition 187 actually
loses $150 to every $1 it saves,
and taxes will be raised to make
up for the losses."
Speakers emphasized that the
intitiative would change the
atmosphere of California as a
whole, making it a "police state."
"What Proposition 187 is ask
ing us to do is act like police offi
cers," said Eva Silva, who gradu
ated from Stanford last year and
currently teaches at Menlo-
Atherton High School.
"They can take me to jail if
they want, but I will not be stand
ing at the door checking students
for green cards. I am a teacher,

not a police officer," said Silva, a
Chicana activist who was one of
the hunger strikers during last
spring's three-day protest.
In addition, speakers empha
sized that the issue at hand is not
only a Latino issue — as many
perceive it — but one that targets
all communities of color.
"Proposition 187 is beyond
harassment," said sophomore
Kris Hayashi. "It's a divisive lie
that attempts to divide communi
ties of color. The proponents
seem to forget that many immi
grants come to this country
because of U.S. imperialistic tac
tics against the immigrants'
home country," she said.
Frances Morales, director of El
Centro Chicano, spoke about her
own youthful experiences near
the border between the U.S. and
Mexico, and how the proposition
could affect the ethnic communi
ties at Stanford.
"I grew up in South Texas
with la migra [the border patrol]
at my doorstep everyday, and as a
child, I would always hide from
them even though I was a citi
zen," she said. "This proposition
is very crazy. What does this
mean for Stanford? We've been
striving for multiculturalism, and
this proposition will only move
our efforts backward."
STOP 187 has also displayed a
"Wall of Memory" in White Plaza
for passers-by to recognize and
take pride in the immigrants in
their own families.
