## Israel and Jordan sign peace treaty Security tight as Clinton attends ceremony at Israeli-Jordanian border 
### 
WADI ARABA, Israel-Jordan Border
(AP) — On an asphalted desert minefield
surrounded by barbed wire, Jordanians
and Israelis took the first hesitant steps
toward friendship yesterday.
"Hey, where did you fight?" an Israeli
veteran yelled over to Lt. Gen. Mahmoud
Salem, head of Jordan's ground forces.
Salem said he did battle in the 1967 and
1973 Mideast wars.
"Look where all the fighting has gotten
us," the Israeli replied.
They smiled, shook hands and settled
down with 5,000 other former enemies and
strangers — war veterans, terror victims
and clergymen —. to watch their leaders
sign a treaty ending 46 years of enmity.
Everywhere were symbols of the
hoped-for future of harmony. Soldiers
from each side took turns firing the 21-

gun salute that opened the ceremony, and
their military orchestras blended together
a rendition of "The Star-Spangled Ban
ner."
Dozens of Jordanian, Israeli and Amer
ican flags flapped in the hale desert wind
as dust swirled around the brown Bedouin
tent where President Clinton, King Hus
sein and Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin
mingled before the ceremony.
Jordanian waiters and Israeli women
soldiers dispensing water from coolers
traded baseball caps — Israel Airports
Authority hats for ones imprinted with a
crown and the Royal Jordanian Airline
logo.
Nir Rubinstein, the 32-year-old son of
Israel's education minister, said he had
waited all his life for peace with Jordan.
"It's unbelievable that I'm actually seeing

it,"he gushed.
But first words didn't always come
easy.
In the bleachers, Jordanian reporters
sat apart, curiously eying Israeli counter
parts but not mingling.
"It will take a while before we really
feel the peace, before we are really
friends," said Amir Omari, 40, "Still, it is
a fantastic feeling."
Cultural and linguistic barriers also
remain.
"We tried to talk to the Israeli girls, but
they don't speak Arabic," said waiter
Rami Awad, 18, a Jordanian of Palestini
an origin. "I'd like to invite them home to
welcome them and make them tea."
Security was tight because of threats
from Muslim extremists to disrupt the
peacemaking.
