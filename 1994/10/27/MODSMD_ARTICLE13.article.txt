Mexicans protest Prop. 187
MEXICO CITY (AP) - Some 2,000
angry Mexicans marched yesterday to
the U.S. Embassy to protest a Califor
nia ballot initiative that would deny
all but emergency services to illegal
immigrants in that state.
"Stop the discrimination against
Latinos!" the boisterous crowd chant
ed as helmeted riot police with shields
kept the peaceful demonstrators from
reaching the embassy entrance.
Protesters carried banners calling
for the defeat of Proposition 187, and
calling California Gov. Pete Wilson,
who supports the measure, a racist.
The protest was the most vocal yet
in Mexico City, where government
officials have expressed alarm about

Proposition 187, a Nov. 8 ballot initia
tive in California being condemned by
many Mexicans.
Elsewhere, Tijuana schoolteachers
have begun handing out pamphlets
denouncing Proposition 187 as racist,
while irate Mexican shoppers are vow
ing to boycott U.S. stores in some
Texas border cities.
Proposition 187 would cut off pub
lic schooling and all but emergency
health care to illegal immigrants, and
require school and health officials to
turn over to immigration officials any
one they suspect is illegal.
Protesters carried banners exhort
ing Californians to defeat Proposition
187 and Wilson, who is basing his re
election bid on support for the contro
versial measure.
