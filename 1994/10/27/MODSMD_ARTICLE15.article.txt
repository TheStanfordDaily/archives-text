## Vote no on Prop. 187 
### 
S.O.S. initiative would
cause more problems
than it would solve

Perhaps this year's
most hotly contested ballot
item [at least at Stanford! is
Proposition 187 — a measure to
deny health, education and social
services to undocumented immi
grants, and require reporting of
"suspected" undocumented immi
grants to the Immigration and Nat
uralization Service.
Proponents of the Save Our State
[S.O.S.J initiative feel California is
overrun with undocumented immi
grants who abuse tax-funded ser
vices. If those services were discon
tinued, they claim, the state would
save $200 million [the Legislative
Analyst confirms this] and illegal

immigration would subside.
But Prop. 187 is long on
rhetoric and short on actual
solutions.
While 187 may save some
money, implementation
costs would eat up half those
savings. More importantly,

the plan would jeopardize $15 bil
lion in federal funding for the state.
These numbers (also supported by
the Legislative Analyst] could mean
a net loss of $14.9 billion.
But the costs of 187 would be
more than budgetary. First, deny
ing health services [i.e. immuniza
tions] to a large segment of the
population would increase the
chance of disease. Since many of
these people work in food prepara
tion, such diseases could spread
easily. Second, cutting off educa
tion unjustly punishes children
and further isolates an under
class, which in turn increases
crime. Third, forcing state
employees to report all "suspect
ed" illegal immigrants creates a
"police state mentality" that pro
fessionals such as teachers and
doctors vehemently oppose.

Fourth, all this will not stop the
flow of immigrants. These people
come here for jobs and opportuni
ty, not services.
An impressive [and unlikely] coali
tion is opposing Prop. 187. When was
the last time President Clinton
agreed with Jack Kemp? Diane Fein
stein with William Bennet? Gay and
pro-choice groups with the Catholic
Church? The ACLU with law
enforcement? Or the San Francisco
Chronicle with The Orange County
Register? All of them have
denounced 187 as bad public policy.
From a liberal standpoint, 187
saddles the disadvantaged with
extra burdens and denies them the
most basic rights. From the conser
vative side, the proposal creates an
intrusive policing requirement and
punishes those willing to work for
better lives for their families [isn't
that the American spirit?].
The only piece missing in this
coalition is Governor Wilson and
some of his GOP cronies. The Gov-

ernor has flip-flopped on
immigration and now touts
his toughness on "illegals."
His campaign ads play on
racist misperceptions and
stir up the worst in Califor
nia voters.

But the reasons for opposing
187 run deeper than this. The
proposition tries to blame immi
grants for economic problems that
were the result of national factors
and the defense industry collapse,
not immigration. History is replete
with this sort of scapegoating, but
that does not make it right — it
makes it even less excusable.
Illegal immigration is a problem,
and correctional steps are needed.
Increased border patrols and heavy
sanctions against those who employ
[and often mistreat] illegal immi
grants would be a start. Prop. 187,
however, would be a large step in
the wrong direction. Despite persis
tent anti-immigrant sentiment [not
to mention racism], recent atten
tion and common sense have shift
ed the tide against 187.
It's not too late to stop this ill
advised plan.
