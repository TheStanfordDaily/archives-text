Women's reticence in the classroom is socially induced

HEARING NAOMI Wolf
speak on October 17 in Memorial
Auditorium, I had read the same
thing in numerous psychology and soci
ology articles — women tend to partici
pate less in class than men, as evidenced
by raised hands and spontaneous voic
ings. This is not a "law" without excep
tions; but it is also not due to the "fact"
that women have nothing or less to say
than men, or that they are inherently
more shy.
Studies have concluded that teachers
— throughout grade school and beyond
— call on boys more often, and answer
boys' questions more comprehensively
than those of girls'. This lifelong rein
forcement — along with cultured and
social influences that teach girls to
"share" and stay out of the limelight —

has culminated in a college situation
where most women do not voice their
opinions as often as men, even when
there is no bias in the instructor's
behavior. A survey of classes at Stanford
would probably reveal the same trend.
Knowing the results of scientific stud
ies and numerous potential ways to ame
liorate this problem, are we to stand
silent while the male population as a
whole receives a better, more interactive
education?
The results of this unequal class par
ticipation extend to more than just aca
demic learning. In the workplace, in
group meetings and in other situations
later in life, most women will not be
used to speaking up and standing up for
their voice. Studies on participation in

board meetings show that men tend to
dominate the conversations, by initiating
speech more often and by cutting off
women speakers. These inequities trans
late into less respect for women's ideas
and abilities, unequal pay and the rein
forcement of the glass ceiling that
women still experience. In virtually
every field — from medicine to business
to politics to social work — women face a
disadvantage due to their schooling and
cultural inducements.
Conversely, seeing publicly that
women have analytical skills and good
ideas will help garner respect and equal
treatment for women's ideas and work.
Women will be encouraged to participate
in public and also place greater value on
their own ideas. Although not identical,

women are men's equals in a democratic
society; it is only our cultural, social and
personal institutions that teach us oth
erwise.
So I would urge all students to take
action. Encourage women to participate
in class. Initiate dialogue with instruc
tors as to how to change the structure of
lectures in order to encourage more
female participation, so that class partic
ipation and future work environments
will become equitable. To professors, I
would encourage the same actions on
your behalf.
After all, it is not because women are
unable; rather, we have been told that
we are unable.
