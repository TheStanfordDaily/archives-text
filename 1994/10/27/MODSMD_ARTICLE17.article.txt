# Prof. Siegman's Kennedy analogy an incomplete, misleading comparison
## 
### 
I was amused by Professor Siegman's
apology for ex-president Donald
Kennedy (Oct. 25). However, it was both
incomplete and misleading.
By reducing the scale of the sums
involved in the indirect-cost scandal by a
factor of 1000, the author suggests that
Stanford got away with a trivial pay
ment: $120 against an initial charge of
$20,000. However Stanford's true bill is
in excess of $1 million. I do not see Pro
fessor Siegman volunteering that
amount from his department's annual
budget.
Furthermore, to complete his analo
gy, he should have included the fact that
Professor Manley [his straw-man victim]
would also suffer an annual salary
reduction extending into the foreseeable
future [and retroactive for a few years]
of $1200, reflecting Stanford's loss of

approximately $10 million per year of
indirect cost reimbursement from the
federal government.
All this neglects other losses incurred
from events during that era [e.g. fines
for the mishandling of toxic materials,
etc.]. The negative impact on Stanford's
reputation, at least, could have been
made whole much sooner by a states
manlike assumption of responsibility
and a statement of apology which, alas,
was never offered.
