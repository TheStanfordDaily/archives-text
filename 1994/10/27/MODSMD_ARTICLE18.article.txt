# Give seniors support as they experience horrors of crazed career search
## 
### 
I would like to alert my fellow stu
dents to the presence of a group that is
reincarnated annually here on campus
— job seekers.
As a senior who has joined this group
— partly out of desire, partly out of des

peration — I would like to ask for your
sympathy. We were not always crazed
people, clutching resumes and muttering
"McKinsey." In fact, we used to be just
like you.
Four long years ago, I entered Stan
ford as a happy-go-lucky frosh. I
befriended many seniors, and being one
actually seemed fun. They got to go to
Senior Pub Night and kiss frosh at Full
Moon On The Quad.
I am now a senior, and I have to
admit it's not all drinking and kissing
frosh. There is a minor concept that I
didn't quite understand before — the
issue of finding a place in the real world.
After June, I am on my own. I recall
the look of panic that entered my senior
friends' eyes when I used to ask them
about their job hunt. I never thought
such an innocent question could cause
such fear, but now I understand.
The intellectual curiosity was all well
and good, but currently I need to get a
job or an acceptance at graduate school.
The big question is not whether to take
chemistry, but whether investment
bankers are human.

For the first time, I am actually hav
ing feelings of competitive animosity
directed toward my classmates. As a
friend recently said, "Ah, so they're
finally forcing you to step on each
other's heads." The interview system at
the Career Planning and Placement
Center is a degree of hell that even
Dante could not have envisioned.
If you got trapped in the Career Faire
traffic two Fridays ago, I beg you not to
hold any grudges — we weren't pushing
you out of spite. It's just that it seems
vitally important to give a resume to
anything wearing a suit. Please have
mercy on Stanford's seniors as the rejec
tion letters begin to wallpaper our hall
ways. We just need a good hug, and a job.
