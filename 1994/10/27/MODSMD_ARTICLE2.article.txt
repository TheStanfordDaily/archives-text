# Prop. 187 spurs a lively, heated debate

Supporters and opponents of Proposi
tion 187 clashed last night in Kresge Audi
torium during a lively, heated debate over
the merits and faults of California's highly
controversial referendum.

Moderated by Assoc. Political Science
Prof. Luis Fraga, the debate, at times, incit
ed the audience to both cheers and hisses.
The proposition — which is often called
the "Save Our State" initiative — would
make undocumented immigrants ineligible
for public education, public health and so
cial services.

When asked why people should vote for
the measure, Bud Ridley, East Bay chair of
Yes on 187, used charts to show that Amer
ica's growing population is a problem exac
erbated by an increasing influx of immi
grants, who are "illegal, illegal, illegal."
Panelist Aman Veijee, editor in
cliief of the Stanford Review, said that
he is a libertarian who is "for opened
borders," but that America cannot be
"the welfare state of the world."
On the other side, Frank Wu, the
campaign organizer for Californians
United Against Proposition 187,
attacked Ridley's "Perot-style charts"
and Veijee's reply, which "didn't
mention Prop. 187 at all."
Wu opposed the measure because
there Ls "built into it... a standard
of suspicion" — the possibility that
people may be wrongly persecuted
because of their skin color or accent.
Lynn Young, president of South
Bay Citizens for Immigration
Reform, countered Wu's statement,
saying that the measure will judge
people merely by their papers, not

on accent or looks.
Wu's prediction seemed con
firmed, however, when Ridley said
that he had been talking to a woman
who was "obviously a citizen
because of the way she talked."
Cries of indignation from the audi
ence flustered him and he respond
ed by calling the audience "so politi
cally correct."
One consequence of the initiative
that panelists could not agree on
was whether California could lose
$15 billion in federal funding.
Because schools are federally pro
hibited from releasing documents on
students for government purposes,
the proposition's stipulation that
requires people to turn in illegal
immigrants could mean the loss of
government money, debators said.
Since illegal immigrants in the
schools are falsely enrolled, they do
not count as true students, and
therefore releasing their papers
would be legal, Veijee said.
