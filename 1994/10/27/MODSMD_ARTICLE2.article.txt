Supporters and opponents of Proposi
tion 187 clashed last night in Kresge Audi
torium during a lively, heated debate over
the merits and faults of California's highly
controversial referendum.

Moderated by Assoc. Political Science
Prof. Luis Fraga, the debate, at times, incit
ed the audience to both cheers and hisses.
The proposition — which is often called
the "Save Our State" initiative — would
make undocumented immigrants ineligible
for public education, public health and so
cial services.

When asked why people should vote for
the measure, Bud Ridley, East Bay chair of
Yes on 187, used charts to show that Amer
ica's growing population is a problem exac
erbated by an increasing influx of immi
grants, who are "illegal, illegal, illegal."
