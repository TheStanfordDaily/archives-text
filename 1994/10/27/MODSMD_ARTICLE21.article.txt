## Twixt phobic conceptions 
### 
FOR ALL MY affirmations of adven
ture, for all the promises of con
quering petty fears, for all the
penance I owe for things said before
becoming one of the PC-initiated, I've
never been able to go in there.
Every time I pass by the Firehouse I'm
reminded that, one day, I'll have to venture
inside and discover what it's all about. All
those queerly dressed, strange looking peo
ple; they're in there — day in, day out —
surrounded by all that hardware.
"Soon," I think, "not yet, but soon I'll
go in and see for myself exactly what it is
they do in there."
But when I notice myself passing by,
not even slowing down, I think of how
every Stanford tour guide on every Stan
ford tour has to deal with ignorant, snide
comments made by insensitive, midwest
ern sub-frosh wannabees when they see
that brazen sign beside the entrance:
The Machine Shop.
I'm ashamed to admit it, but it still
gives me the willies. Accuse me as you
will of squeamish Technophobia, but the
people who hang out in there are pretty
weird. Out-of-funk hairdos and ratty
flannels; proud buttons and foam core
backpacks.
And as if the regulars at the Shop
weren't enough to scare me off, they have
all those tools — explicitly named mon
sters like leather punchers and chuckers
and the fearsome Matsuura. Late at
night, moonlight devotees pass around a

tool called a ball-end. mill.
ME's do icky things together —
things like lathing and grinding. Then
there's all that talk about which lubri
cant to use on what piece.
And I hear the stuff they get off on in
there is so bizarre that if you inject the
wrong alloy when trying to fire some
one's mold, you might actually break it.
Talk about performance anxiety.
Now it's not that I've never dabbled in
the Technocratic. I took all three quar
ters of A-side. I know where the function
key is on my roommate's calculator.
Some of my best friends are full
fledged out-of-the-closet Techies, and I'm
actually quite comfortable around them.
I've seen them at work — lubing, mea
suring, experimenting — going at it quite
often in groups. But to enter their den,
their nest, their Lalß. . . .
It's an entirely separate ordeal.
Suppose that's why I won't stop on my
way to hand this column in at the Daily and
open the door and check it out. I should
have enough confidence in my interests,
enough familiarity with my anima, to hop
in without falter. Yet I continue to fear that
the strange eyes within might peer too
deeply into me and thus alter some hearty
component of my inclinations.
And let's not forget the rumors — all
the buzzing after being seen inside: "Hey,
is that Michael Green? I didn't know he
was a Techie. Could you believe?"
If I ever do brave the entrance, I'm sure

I'll be holding a copy of Ulysses and wearing
my "I think therefore I am a Philosophy
major" button to avoid any mislabeling.
Still there is no excuse. We've all read
the reports about how it's really something
about the size of the hypothalamus that
determines who does what. The differences
are no longer a matter of blame — they just
can't help but love the things they love.
Even if that does include black rimmed
glasses and bike helmet decals. And they're
perfectly contented, if not proud, to be a
part of a world that is neither appreciated
nor understood by most others.
So I'm trying to bulk up on my sensi
tivity and be aware of the stares we give
them. I'm trying to understanjd the mind
set. After spending four hours on a prob
lem set I even started to see how easy it is
to get attached to a mechanical pencil.
But there is more to understanding
than sympathy. Remember that just
because some people know when and how
to use an Aiulam doesn't make them any
different inside. Their feelings are still real
feelings and their desires are real desires.
They're normal ol' folks, those weirdos
in the Machine Shop.
As normal as yourself, if that's any
consolation.
