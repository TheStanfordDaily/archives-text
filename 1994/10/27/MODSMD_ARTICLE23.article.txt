## Sluggish Lackluster women's soccer squeaks past San Francisco

The great teams can win ugly.
Although the Stanford
women's soccer team did nothing
yesterday to justify its ranking as
the third-best squad in the coun
try, the Cardinal still moved to
13-1 on the season with a lack
luster 1-0 victory over the Uni
versity of San Francisco (12-3-1).
"It looked like we didn't play
with any emotion today," said
head coach lan Sawyers. "It was
clearly the worst performance of
the year for us."
Jessica Fischer provided the
only scoring of the sluggish perfor
mance on a penalty kick with just
over 10 minutes remaining. The
Ail-American junior sweeper
finessed a drive into the lower
right corner of the goal, surprising
Dons goalkeeper Amy Voiland.
Fischer, who was recently
selected as a finalist for the Mis
souri Athletic Club Player of the
Year award, scored for the fourth
time this year, all on stoppages in
play. She has both the team's
goals on penalty kicks this season.
"I just try to take them the same
way," the penalty-kick specialist
said. "I just like to get it to the right
spot, because if you hit it to the

right spot no keeper can find it."
Fischer's goal came as a result
of sophomore midfielder Mandy
Tucker's penetration. Tucker, who
had received no playing time in the
last four games, entered the game
for the second time with about 20
minutes to play. She made an
immediate impact, and had beaten
USF's Felicia Brown on the left
side when she was brought down
just inside the penalty box.
"The defender made the big
play of the game," Sawyers said.
"[Tucker] did well to push the ball
past the defender, which we've
been trying to encourage our for
wards to do. We're kind of play
making in front of the defense too
much. She did a good job of push
ing that ball forward and penetrat
ing, causing the defender to have
no option but to bring her down."
Tucker, who exchanged
glances with Brown later after a
foul by Brown just beyond the
midfield stripe, explained how
the only major scoring threat of
the game came about.
"I got the ball from Vicky Har
ing, and started running down
the sidelines. One or two players
came at me. I beat one player,
and another player came at me
right at the corner of the box. I
just touched it by her, and she
took out my legs. And I took a
dive," she said.
The takedown of Tucker was
only one of a series of fouls in a
very physical contest. Although
Stanford had 19 fouls to the


Sophomore Mandy Tucker provides a lone spark for the soccer
team en route to a cool victory over the Dons yesterday.
