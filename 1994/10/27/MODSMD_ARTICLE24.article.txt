From the famous "Thunder
chickens" to "Touchdown
Tommy," nicknames for teams
and players are a tradition with
Cardinal football. This season
you can watch guys named "T-
Rex" and "Kazoo" in Stanford
Stadium — or rather, the "C
-house."
"That's us," sophomore full
back Adam Salina explained,
regarding C-house. "It was start
ed by Eliel Swinton last year
when we were in the stadium."
Swinton was on the field when
he coined the term, short for
"Cardinal House," and it has
stuck ever since.
Salina, also known as "Dump
Truck," is no stranger to nick
names.
"I got it from [coachJ Keena
Turner," Salina explained, "He
played with a guy on the 49ers
who was named Dump Truck
and he said I reminded him of
[that guy].
"I like it. It's appropriate for the
way I run — just straight ahead.. .1
just try to plow through the line,"
said the bruising, 6-foot-6, 250-
pound fullback of his moniker.
Salina is also known by
another name. According to Jeff
Buckey (a.k.a. "Buck-sevens,"
for his number, 77), "The coach
ing staff calls him Czonka, after
[NFL great] Larry Czonka."
Tight end Tony Cline is known
as "T-Rex" for the dinosaur,
Tyrannosaurus Rex. While his
name is in part a play on his first
initial — as with Branyon Davis
(B-Love), David Walker (D-Walk)
and David Shaw (D-Hoops, for his
basketball ability) — Cline is
named for the prehistoric beast
for another reason. It's because
"when Tony runs, his arms look
like that of a T-Rex," Salina said.
Some nicknames on the team
are easy to understand. Scott
Frost is "Snowman." And a guy
named Ozzie (Grenardo) has got
to be called "Wizard." Others
have more obscure titles, like
kicker Eric Abrams, known by

some as "Kazoo."
"It was given to me as a fresh
man," Abrams said. The name
comes from the helmeted Martian
character on the "Flintstones." As
a kicker, Abrams wears a helmet
with a single bar, instead a larger
face-mask. The nickname jests at
the resemblance.
However, since Abrams has
not watched the show since
childhood and has no idea what
the character looks like, the
nickname is wearing out. "I liked
it when I was a freshman, but
now it has kind of gotten old," he
said.
Nicknames die for other rea
sons. Linebacker Justin Mora
bito was called "Fours" when he
wore number 44. This season he
sports number 46 and has to set
tle for "J-man."
Outside linebacker lan
Brown got his nickname from
defensive coordinator Fred von-
Appen. "Moose," as Brown is
now commonly known, is a gibe
at the linebacker's 5-foot-6, 200-
pound frame. Moose, likely the
shortest player on the team, said
he is "probably the smallest out
side linebacker in the country."
Brown's fellow linebacker,
Damon Phillips, is known as
"Zombie" because, according to
Brown, "he used to sleep a lot
during meetings."
Offensive coordinator Terry
Shea hands out the "Big Hunk"
award to a member of the offense
each week. The commendation,
named after the candy bar, also
comes with a nickname of Shea's
creation. Salina, heretofore
known as Dump Truck and
Czonka, was also dubbed
"Autumn Thunder" by Shea.
Buckey, whom the coach calls
"Boxcar," isn't sure where Shea
comes up with these names.
"They're just totally random.
They're kind of corny," said
Buckey, noting the pun with
wide receiver Justin "Bullet
proof' Armour. Other Shea
inventions include lineman T.J.
"Time Bomb" Gaynor and Ethan
"Double Agent" Allen.
After this summer's block
buster movie, the team equip
ment manager dubbed fullback

Greg Cornelia "Forrest Gump."
"Pat, the equipment manag
er, put it on my locker.... I had
a haircut like [Gump]," Cornelia
said.
Does Cornelia run like the fic
tional, collegiate All-American?
"My style is a little different, but
I like to think I can," he said.
So is the appellation appropri
ate?
"If you've seen the movie,
[Cornelia] is kind of like Forrest

in some ways," Buckey said.
"Not in any mean sense."
Abrams offered another
explanation. "I haven't seen the
movie, but I understand Forrest
was real set in his ways and loved
running," he said.
Cornelia made his own argu
ment for the nickname: "The
concussions I had last year were
due to a lack of air in my helmet."
Gump couldn't have said it
better himself.
