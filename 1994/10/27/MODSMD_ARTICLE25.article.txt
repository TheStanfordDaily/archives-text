# Cross country teams ready for Pac-10s
## Men and women both favored in divisions 
### Todd Bernstein Staff writer 
While winning the Pacific 10 Champi
onships this weekend would be a great boost
to the Stanford cross country teams, it is not
quite the crux of their season.
"We're taking this for what it is," said head
coach Vin Lananna. "It will be a great oppor
tunity for our athletes to showcase what
they've done all year. But in terms of the
national championship, this has no direct
effect on the selection process."
Lananna is referring to the fact that in the
world of collegiate cross country, winning the
conference championship does not give a team
an automatic bid to the national champi
onship.
Nonetheless, the Cardinal women will try
to make an impression on conference rivals
and the rest of the country while defending
last year's first-ever Pac-10 title. The Stan
ford men look to capture the title for the first
time since 1985.
Both the women and men are favored to
take their divisions this weekend at the Stan
ford Golf Course, but Lananna is paying little
attention to the press' predictions.
"It's very exciting to have a shot at win
ning. I think the women have more control of
their destiny, but in the men's field, Arizona is
really the favorite," he said.
The Cardinal men will have to deal with
rival Arizona, a team they beat at the Michi
gan Invitational, but lost to at the Stanford
Invitational.
According to Lananna, the fact that this
weekend's race will consist of a very few num
ber of runners will greatly favor Arizona. The
Wildcats' advantage is a result of the speed of

brothers Martin and Bob Keino, who will look
to set a fast pace early in the race.
"We have our work cut out for us. This type
of small field is to [Arizona's] advantage. It
will give us a really good challenge," said
sophomore J.J. White.
To beat Arizona, Stanford will not neces
sarily need to run a fast race but a smart one.
"We're going to have to get out of the first
mile a little faster, but still stay as a pack.

Hopefully, running conservatively at the
beginning of the race will help us at the end,"
said sophomore Greg Jimmerson, who has led
the Cardinal in its last two invitational meets.
Concerning the men's strategy, Lananna
added, "We will put ourselves in a position to
open a window, and if it opens we will try to go
through it. But I think the window has to be

open for us to win it."
The women, who have not lost
to a Pac-10 foe this year, are
clearly in a position to run away
with their second straight crown.
"I think if everything falls into
place, we will have a good shot at
defending our title," said Lananna.
Though the Cardinal women
are heavy favorites, they will face
four top-20 teams: Oregon (who
has won the Pac-10 championship
six out of the last eight years),
UCLA, Arizona and Washington.
The female runners are
enjoying one of their finest sea
sons ever. They have placed at
the top of every meet except one
this year, and this weekend
they look to continue their suc
cess.
The team, according to Lanan
na, is just coming together at the
right time.
"We're still training really
hard, and I'm hoping we're just
getting to rounding the corner of
us being a peaked team," he said •
