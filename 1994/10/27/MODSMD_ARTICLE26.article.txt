# Ruggers off to LA matches
## 
### John Lawson 
The Rose Bowl is not the only
place in Los Angeles where the Car
dinal will be showing its athletic
stuff this weekend.
The men's rugby team will join
the football squad in the City of
Angels as it squares off against
UCLA, USC and Cal-State Fuller
ton. Both of Stanford's rugby
teams will take on UCLA on Fri
day, then the first team will battle
USC and the second team will face
Fullerton on Sunday. Saturday will
provide a chance for the ruggers to
watch the football team play the
Bruins in the sport which was
derived directly from their own.
Designed to give some of the
team's many newcomers a chance
to gain some experience, the trip
will also provide the veterans with
an opportunity to work out the
kinks in their game. As there are
15 players on the field at a time
and only a limited amount of sub
stitutes allowed during the game,
coach Franck Boivert estimated
that 35-40 players will be making

the trip south.
"We are scrambling to get an
idea of who should play and where,"
Boivert said. "That is why I am so
anxious to play this weekend â€” I
am looking forward to seeing where
we are right now and where we will
be going for the rest of the season."
This fall could be considered
the ruggers' preseason. After the
L.A. trip, the team will face Santa
Clara, San Jose State and the
alumni in November, and will
participate in the Stanford Tens
Tournament in December. Games
don't begin to affect the team's
record or post-season prospects
until its Jan. 4 contest against Cal
Poly-San Luis Obispo.
In previous seasons, the team
has traveled to Tucson, Ariz., dur
ing the last weekend of October to
play in a tournament. When the
competition there ebbed, they
selected L.A. as a good place to try
their skills.
"fFall] really provides a good
time for the team to develop, espe
cially all the new players," said
club vice-president and senior

Bobby Blunt. "We held our first
inter-squad scrimmage last Fri
day, and I was really impressed
with the effort and skill of some of
them. Our team looks to be a
strong competitor this year."
The one weakness Boivert finds
in his team as of now is a lack of
size. "We need more players who
can jump high and get the ball,
and also use their bulk to wrestle
the ball away from others," he
said. "We'd love to see more of the
football players join our team."
Last year, only two players
from the football team went out
for the rugby team after their
football season ended; the figure
is usually four or five.
"That lack of size hurt us last
year," Blunt said. "We were fast,
but we just couldn't muscle our way
past opponents like Cal." The Bears
have won an unprecedented seven
straight national rugby crowns.
"Stanford rugby always trains
hard and plays hard," Blunt said.
"With a full-team effort, I can see
us taking down Cal. Anything can
happen on the rugby pitch."
