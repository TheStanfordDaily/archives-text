# Sailors look for pot of gold
## 
### Daniel Kao Contributing writer 
This weekend the Stanford sail
ing team voyages into uncertain
waters at the Sloop Districts hosted
by the Hawaii Rainbows. Approxi
mately half a dozen teams will bat
tle it out in hopes of a top-two finish
— and a qualification for Nationals.
"It's really hard to tell how
we'll do," said coach Steve Bour
dow. "We're not sure how the rest
of the field will look. We could go

and find out there are only one or
two other good teams, or else we
could go and find ourselves in a
tough regatta with four good
teams."
This regatta is especially dif
ferent because of the featured use
of J-245, which are heavy, four
person keel boats. The Cardinal
team does not regularly partici
pate in sloop competition, so a
prediction on its performance is
difficult to make.
Even though it's not one of

Stanford's usual events, the team
won't be going into the race with
out any experience. The Cardinal
will be sending the formidable line
up of senior skippers Rolf Kaiser
and Charles Meade, junior skipper
Adam Lowry and sophomore skip
per Mark Chauvel. Meade and
Lowry were the winners of the '91
and '92 Junior National Champi
onships, respectively, which fea
tured the same type of boats, and
Kaiser is an old hand at sailing
these crafts.
"Right now, with our experi
ence, I think that we're the team
to beat," Lowry said.
While on paper the Cardinal def
initely appears to have one of the
top teams, it will be a different type
of regatta for the sailors. With just
a couple of practices under their
belts handling the larger boats, it
will be difficult to tell whether or
not the team will find a pot of gold
at the end of the rainbow in Hawaii.
"The team that has practiced
most effectively will win," Bour
dow said. "With the two practices,
we've worked a lot on trying to
make our boat handling flawless
so that we'll be able to concen
trate more on the racing instead
of some of the technical stuff.
With our team, I think we have as
good a chance as any other teams
we know of."
