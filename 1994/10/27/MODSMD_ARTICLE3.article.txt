# Pending protest propels abortion educators to address med students
## 
### Anita Krishnamurthy 
In anticipation of a large-scale protest by the anti
abortion group Operation Rescue, three prominent
abortion rights educators taught a group of about 80
medical students yesterday about the medical aspects
of abortion procedures and patient access to abortion.
Operation Rescue, a national organization known
for its radical tactics, recently targeted Stanford Med
ical School in an effort to stop the teaching of abortion
procedures to medical students. Currently, Stanford
only teaches the procedure to residents in obstetrics
and gynecology.

In response to the threat, three medical students in
vited yesterday's speakers in the hope that they would
present an educational — not political — perspective on
the issue.
Dr. Kate O'Hanlan, an 08/GYN professor at the
Medical School, presented the various medical proce
dures for performing an abortion, from surgical extrac
tion to new types of drugs.
Despite the vast number of techniques for perform
ing an abortion, patient access is quite limited, said
Ellen Flamen, the public relations director at Planned
Parenthood of San Mateo County.
