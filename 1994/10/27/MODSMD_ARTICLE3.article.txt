# Pending protest propels abortion educators to address med students
## 
### Anita Krishnamurthy 
In anticipation of a large-scale protest by the anti
abortion group Operation Rescue, three prominent
abortion rights educators taught a group of about 80
medical students yesterday about the medical aspects
of abortion procedures and patient access to abortion.
Operation Rescue, a national organization known
for its radical tactics, recently targeted Stanford Med
ical School in an effort to stop the teaching of abortion
procedures to medical students. Currently, Stanford
only teaches the procedure to residents in obstetrics
and gynecology.

In response to the threat, three medical students in
vited yesterday's speakers in the hope that they would
present an educational — not political — perspective on
the issue.
Dr. Kate O'Hanlan, an 08/GYN professor at the
Medical School, presented the various medical proce
dures for performing an abortion, from surgical extrac
tion to new types of drugs.
Despite the vast number of techniques for perform
ing an abortion, patient access is quite limited, said
Ellen Flamen, the public relations director at Planned
Parenthood of San Mateo County.
"Abortion is stigmatized in our
society," Flamen said, adding that
only 12 percent of medical schools
teach abortion. Women will seek
out abortion some way, so training
is needed for medical students, she
said.
Positive strokes are occuring
for abortion rights, Flamen said.
Currently, Planned Parenthood
is creating clinic escort programs
in cooperation with local San
Mateo police, while courts are
now looking more favorably at
women's legal right to abortions,
she said.
The major problem with deny
ing access to abortion is that the
number of unintended pregnan
cies for all categories of women is

so high, said Phyllis Schoenwald, a
representative of Planned Parent
hood.
Schoenwald said almost 56 per
cent of all pregnancies are unin
tended and nearly half of these end
in abortion. Eighty-two percent of
pregnant teenagers, 40 percent of
married women, and 75 percent of
poor women have unintended
pregnancies, she added.
These statistics illustrate the
great demand for abortions among
all classes of women, she said.
"Women's access to reproduc
tive health care, including abor
tion, is critical to their well-being,"
said second-year medical student
Gloria Huang. "I want to know
what my role as a future physician
is to help ensure that the access to
all options remains available."
Operation Rescue has said it
plans to picket the Medical School
in late October.
