# No isolation in run club
## 
### Brian Lee 
For many recreational runners, the isolation of the
sport is simply unavoidable. Graduate student James
Lavin, however, would disagree.
Lavin, who along with sophomore Erin Graves
coordinates Stanford's Running Club, feels that the
organization provides runners with the opportunity
to "run and socialize."
"Running alone is boring," Lavin said. "It's much
nicer to be social and run with lots of other people."
Formed about eight years ago, the Running Club
tries to accommodate all levels of recreational run
ners. Every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, the
group, comprised of over 40 students, meets at the
Track House and splits into three different levels of
ability. The mix of members ranges from a number
of novices to a handful of potential varsity athletes.
In addition to providing company for each
other, the group attempts to add some variety to

their runs by choosing different routes for each
session. Recent runs have included trips to the
Dish, the Windy Hill Open Space Preserve and Big
Basin Redwoods State Park.
According to Lavin, the organization, despite
its designation as an official club sport, strives to
maintain an atmosphere that is both informal and
noncompetitive.
"We do not take attendance, charge dues or
give people a hard time if they miss runs," Lavin
said. "If you want to run to beat people, we are not
the group for you."
Among the half a dozen races the club took part
in last year was the Bay-to-Breakers 12K, in
which 100,000 athletes ran in a formation that
Lavin describes as "giant slinky-pede." The club
also participated in the Run to the Far Side, which
is hosted by cartoonist Gary Larsen, and the Chal
lenge for Charity, sponsored by the Stanford Busi
ness school.
