Stanford present will meet
Stanford past when the field hock
ey squad plays the alumni team
this Saturday in one of its two exhi
bition matches this weekend. The
Cardinal (6-7-1) will also compete
against Santa Clara on Friday.
The team of former Stanford
field hockey players — whose
team name, 5.L.1.M.E., is a mean
ingless acronym — still plays
together competitively. Last year,
S.L.I.M.E. beat the Cardinal, 2-1.
"It's fun to play on a whole
other level," said sophomore
defender Amy Marfil. "We get to
be serious and have fun."
With the nucleus of the
S.L.I.M.E. team living in the

Stanford area, many of the best
alumni players come back to play
this game. The team includes
head coach Sheryl Johnson, a
member of the United States
Field Hockey Association Hall of
Fame and the U.S. Field Hockey
Team from 1978 to 1991.
"It's nice to do well against
coach [JohnsonJ," Marfil said,
"but it's also intimidating
because she's so good."
For the Cardinal to win, it
must pass well and beat the alum
ni at their own game, according to
Syer. S.L.I.M.E. is a finesse team
that relies on accurate passing
and field experience.
"Smart hockey will always beat
you," Syer added.
Recently, the Cardinal has been
boosted by its defensive game. In

its last three outings, the team has
only given up one goal. In the last
two games, freshman goalie Kelly
Naylor notched her third and
fourth shutouts of the year.
Friday's game against Santa
Clara will provide the Cardinal
one more opportunity to prepare
for S.L.I.M.E. In its first game of
the season on Oct. 9, Stanford
demolished Santa Clara, 11-0.
Because the Broncos are a club
team, Santa Clara will not be
counted on the Cardinal's record.
When Stanford meets up with
its past on Saturday, the first pri
ority will be to have fun.
"It will definitely be one of our
more difficult games," Naylor
said. "But it's a great atmosphere.
It's refreshing to play and be
around [the alumni]."
