# The
						year 'Angels' came to A.C.T.
## Kushner's masterpiece evokes laughter, tears 
### kinda Friedlieb 
angels camc to America to sing into
the ear of playwright Tony Kushner,
and the American Conservatory
Theater is showcasing the glorious results.
And while Kushner's masterpieces com
prise an extremely long song, they are defi
nitely worth every minute of the seven
hours they consume.
It is nearly impossible to conjure up the
correct words to pay tribute to a master
wordsmith — brilliant and amazing hardly
seem concrete enough to apply to Kushner.
In "Angels in America," Kushner's lines
burst forth with stunning, piercing wit.
They make us see truths about the world in
which we live. And, perhaps most impor
tantly, they make us laugh while dealing
with subjects that should make us weep.
"The guy who wrote the national an
them knew what he was doing when he put
freedom on a note so high no one could
reach it," remarks a black gay nurse with
both humor and insight into the prejudice
surrounding him.
And a politically conservative gay man
confronts his extremely liberal Jewish lover
with the question, "If people like you didn't
have Reagan to bash, where would you be?"
"If Reagan didn't have people like me to
bash, where would he be?" replies his lover.
"The upper right-hand square of the 'Hol
lywood Squares.'
The complexity and seriousness of Kush
ner's writing and the issues "Angels" tackles
justifies the full production length of seven
hours. For the sake of sanity (that of both ac
tors and audience), it becomes two plays —
each of which brought Kushner a Tony

award for best play.
Both parts, performed
on different nights, share

a cast of
eight
culled

through a nationwide casting process
(unorthodox for the usually Bay Area
focused A.C.T.). Each actor carries a pri
mary role and then fills in with a multi
tude of bit parts.
Hngels in America: Millenium <
Approaches" introduces us to
two (or maybe three, depending
on your viewpoint) troubled pairs.
Prior Walter is a WASP-y, descended
from-the-Mayflower drag queen in love

with extremely Jewish, guilt-ridden Louis
Ironson. In the first scene, Prior informs his
lover of four-and-a-half years that he has
AIDS, and it all goes downhill from there.
The second couple features the tradi
tional Mormon, Republican law clerk Joe
Pitt and his constantly hallucinating, Vali
um-addicted wife Harper. The two are con
tinuously struggling to discover what's
wrong with their marriage, keeping him
unhappy and her popping pills.
The third pair explores a historical
rather than a romantic relationship. Roy
Kohn, infamous aide to Sen. Joe McCarthy,
is paired in a bizarre hate-hate relationship
with one of his most weli-known victims
— the late Ethel Rosenberg. Roy's almost
inexplicable hatred of Ethel, "the Jewish
mother that could have belonged to any of
us," provides an interesting contrast with
the homosexuality he refuses to admit.
These three relationships, how they
evolve, transform and develop, form the
crux of the plays — ultimately a critique of
politics and American society, as well as a
look at the gaps between the idealized and
the day-to-day reality. For example, while
Louis is weighing the option of leaving
Prior because the former can't deal with the
thought of constant illness and the reality of
contaminated blood on the bathroom
floor, Joe is considering his own es-

cape route as a means of es
caping his delusionary

wife and perhaps
acting out his long
repressed homo
sexual urges.
There is no
escaping
"Angels" 's
definite themes of gay

rights and of the impact
of AIDS. It's even in the
subtitle, "A Gay Fan-

tasia on National
Themes."

Kushner
takes

a good hard look at the
ravages inflicted on
AIDS patients by the
disease, by their friends,
by prejudice.
Each of the charac-

ters quickly becomes intertwined with oth
ers: Joe meets Louis at the courthouse where
both work. Roy serves as a kind of mentor to
Joe. An ill Prior meets up with Harper in his
dreams, an Angel as his illness debilitates
him — all while maintaining a more real
world relationship with his friend Belize.
This crescendo of relationships comes to
a head with the first manifestation of the
angel, leading into part two of the saga:
"Angels in America: Perestroika."
The A.C.T.'s performances of Kush ti
er's saga seems especially appropri
ate given their plays joint histories
with San Francisco— the city where "Mil
lenium" was first performed and most of
"Perestroika"' written.
"Heaven is a place like San Francisco,"
declares Prior at one point. The City cer
tainly did wonders for the playwright.
Kushner's words are brought to life by an
exceptionally talented cast, highlighted by
the performances of Garrett Dillahunt as
the terminally ill visionary Prior and Ben
Shenkman as his neurotic other half Louis.
The men have a chemistry which carries
from the first scene in which Prior teases
Louis about the fact that he pretended to be
straight at his grandmother's funeral
through the trauma which awaits their lives.
Christine McMurdo-Wallis also pulls
off a spectacular performance, despite her
many quick character and costume
changes. As Ethel, Joe's iron-willed mother,
Cohn's doctor and many more, she is al
ways on the mark, as is Gregory Wallace in
the roles of the caring-yet-callous Belize
and Harper's fictional travel agent Mr. Lies.
Also excellent are Steven Culp as the
conscience-stricken Mormon Joe Pitt and
Julia Gibson as his wife. Gibsons captures a
spacy, cut-off-from-the-world component
of Harper which makes her more child
than woman. ,v»II

Perhaps the weakest point of the
show is the presence of Lisa Bruneau
as The Angel. The effort of staying
If

airborne on a trapeze
like apparatus appears

to drain much of her energy, as her feet no
ticeably tried to find footholds in the scenery
to aid in keeping her in control.
Fortunately the scenery is good for
much more than keeping Bruneau off the
ground. Set designer Kate Edmunds cre
ates a black-and-white grid with a metal
bridge and some towers which she turns
into everything from Louis' bedroom to
Antarctica through the use of props.
While simplicity is often the name of the
game (a white sheet provides the snowy
backdrop of the icy continent), some props
are so real we could almost taste them —
like the messy sandwiches on Roy's desk.
The simplicity allows for constant
change, as the towers move and beds drop
from the sky, we also see stagehands
dressed in black moving Cohn's hospital
bed and various other props into full view.
And a few times during the opening night
of "Perestroika," they showed up unexpect
edly when a curtain and a bed each refused
their turn to fall into place.
But the scenery is definitely the only thing
that occasionally doesn't fall into place at the
Marines Memorial Theater. For angels are
watching over Kushner's works and lending
inspiration to audiences lucky enough to
witness their complexity and insights.
"Catholics believe in forgiveness. lews
believe in guilt," Louis says. Kushner gives us
no choice but to believe in "Angels." ■
