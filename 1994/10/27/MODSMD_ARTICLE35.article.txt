# Sculpture in the Air
## Award-winning group displays beauty of sign language 
### Samuel Park 
The high energy of silent movies and the
madness of screwball comedy find a
happy marriage in "An Italian Straw Hat,"
which will be staged by the National Theatre
of the Deaf (NTD) Saturday at Stanford.
Ten out of the cast of 12 are deaf, but their
disability is easy to forget. Such is the elo
quence of their language. Their gestures and
sign language provide a dance on the stage
that keeps the audience riveted, their eyes
glued to the actors' hands.
The two hearing actors play not only their
own parts, but they also provide voices for
the characters of the deaf actors. And every
one uses sign language, so rather than miss
ing out on something, we can derive a double
interpretation — the language in the air and
the language of the hands.
The deaf actors lip-sync to the speaking ac
tors in the background, and oftentimes you
don't notice that the deaf actor isn't really
speaking. This arrangement makes the play
accessible to both deaf and hearing audiences.
"It started as a social movement," said
David Hays, founder of the NTD, "to create
role models and to make people aware of deaf
people's skills. This started nearly thirty years
ago, when people used to fear deaf people."
Sign language is the real star of the play.
The performance showcases its beauty, and
how it resembles "sculpture in the air," a
phrase often used by Hays to describe it.
And the madness beglni...
In this French farce, mayhem is the rule of
the day. The hat referred to in the title
sparks a chain of events that leave the char
acters running around, chasing each other
through 1850s Paris.
The madness begins when Ferdinand
(Robert DeMayo), on his wedding day, is
chased by a woman and a soldier after Fer
dinand's horse eats her hat. So, while he
juggles his bride, the wedding guests, the
future father-in-law and his former lover,
Ferdinand needs to find a replacement for
the hat. This search takes him all over Paris
in all sorts of clumsy yet hilarious situa
tions.
All the necessary ingredients are there in
cluding mistaken identities, terrible coinci
dences and the usual suspects (the jealous
husband, the lovesick maid, the unfaithful
wife). The result is a fast-moving comedy
that keeps turning and twisting, never stop
ping to take a breath.
"An Italian Straw Hat" is French and has
its share of kissing in it (more than there was
last week at Full Moon on the Quad), but it's
neither salacious nor lewd. Like a sex comedy
for the PG audience, the play provides pure,
clean fun. With sound effects right out of
Three Stooges movies and the frenetic
rhythm of a Groucho Marx comedy, the
humor often slides into pure slapstick,
though no one slips on a banana peel or hit in
the head... well, actually, someone does.
In other words, it's farce, but it's not Sheri
dan. It's French, but it's not naughty. It's deaf,
but it's not silent.
The set looks like an adult toy store, and
the Alice-in-Wonderland costume design
adds to the element of fantasy, so that the
production feels like a live-action cartoon,
with all the bright colors and weird sound ef
fects.

'Whsri's thi freak show?'
Who ever knew deaf people could be so
loud? In the play, they communicate
with audiences through sign language,
facial expressions, and body movement. The
effect is highly cinematic, more visual than
most plays.
The way the hands move — dramatic,
quiet or even rebellious — become part of
the dialogue of the play. The grace of the
movements is clearly expressed as one of the
original goals of the NTD was to show people
the beauty of sign language.
"Sign language was a stigma 28 years ago.
People didn't want to be seen using it," said
Andy Vasnick, a founding member of the
NTD who plays the bride's uncle.
Vasnick credits the NTD for a lot of the
changes in how deaf people are perceived in
this country.
"I think the audiences were a little disap

pointed," Vasnick explained, with all the ex
pansiveness and theatricality due to an actor.
"They're like, 'Where's the freak show?
Where are the deaf people? Where's the deaf
ness?'
"And of course, you can't see it... 'Oh,
they're just like us. Oh, okay' "
"Talking" to Vasnick with the help of an
interpreter, it's hard to think that deaf people
should have any trouble communicating.
Vasnick "talks" with his hands, with his eyes,
both of which qualify him as a good actor. He
isn't limited by speech, by that very thing that
actors often rely on a little too much. Vasnick
literally doesn't depend on his lines in order
to shine.
"It's good for an actor to learn how the
body can be resourceful, and how much
more one can express when one uses all of the
senses," said Adrienne Alitowski, who makes
her debut in the NTD as the bride Helene.

"Learning sign language was a big obstacle
at first," said Alitowski, the only speaking ac
tress, "1 had never worked with actors who
used sign language before. It's been a real
challenge."

The NTD is regarded in theater circles as a
national treasure. Highly successful,
considered brilliant, adored by critics,
they often play to sold-out crowds. They've
already won several Tonys, performed in all
50 states, mounted 29 international tours
and were invited to perform at the White
House.
"We've been wanting to have them here
for years, but Berkeley always got them in
stead of us," said Phil O'Shaughnessy, Assis
tant Artistic Director of Lively Arts. "We're
very excited about having them here. Their
work is different from the traditional the
ater performances. It's a great group."
They've done Puccini, Chekhov, Voltaire,
Moliere, even Homer. Their adaptations are
noted for their imaginative sets, for doing
more with less staging and for a unique style
of acting. The visual "subtitles" provided by
the sign language are supposed to add an ad
ditional layer of meaning, and never detracts
from the show.
Their work has been characterized in the
past as "physical and free," known for explor
ing the meaning of the tales they present. The
combination is unlike any other play.
"The NTD is very conscious of trying to
make people aware of the deaf people's con
dition, and to provide the hearing-impaired
with an opportunity to enjoy theater," said
Lois Wagner, Artistic Director of Lively Arts.
Wondirlnl reviews
Hays remembers the difficulties they had
starting out, back in the 1967. Six people
bought tickets to the first NTD perfor
mance.
"When we started playing it was wonder
ful, but before people thought it would be a
strange freak show," Hays said, "it was hard to
get the first tour booked."
But those first tours led to wonderful re
views and those in turn led to longer, wider
reaching tours, according to Hays.
"In the beginning, there were lots of
strange questions," Vasnick said. "Can deaf
people have children? Do they use ears for
sex? No. I can drive, I can have sex. I can get
married. We don't get questions like that any
more."
Vasnick smiles when he says that. Indeed,
after seeing a play by the NTD many will not
think of deaf people in the same way. Not
after hearing them yell with their hands. Not
after seeing them create sculptures in the air
with sign language. ■

The high energy of silent movies and the
madness of screwball comedy find a
happy marriage in "An Italian Straw Hat,"
which will be staged by the National Theatre
of the Deaf (NTD) Saturday at Stanford.
Ten out of the cast of 12 are deaf, but their
disability is easy to forget. Such is the elo
quence of their language. Their gestures and
sign language provide a dance on the stage
that keeps the audience riveted, their eyes
glued to the actors' hands.
The two hearing actors play not only their
own parts, but they also provide voices for
the characters of the deaf actors. And every
one uses sign language, so rather than miss
ing out on something, we can derive a double
interpretation — the language in the air and
the language of the hands.
The deaf actors lip-sync to the speaking ac
tors in the background, and oftentimes you
don't notice that the deaf actor isn't really
speaking. This arrangement makes the play
accessible to both deaf and hearing audiences.
"It started as a social movement," said
David Hays, founder of the NTD, "to create
role models and to make people aware of deaf
people's skills. This started nearly thirty years
ago, when people used to fear deaf people."
Sign language is the real star of the play.
The performance showcases its beauty, and
how it resembles "sculpture in the air," a
phrase often used by Hays to describe it.
And the madness beglni...
In this French farce, mayhem is the rule of
the day. The hat referred to in the title
sparks a chain of events that leave the char
acters running around, chasing each other
through 1850s Paris.
The madness begins when Ferdinand
(Robert DeMayo), on his wedding day, is
chased by a woman and a soldier after Fer
dinand's horse eats her hat. So, while he
juggles his bride, the wedding guests, the
future father-in-law and his former lover,
Ferdinand needs to find a replacement for
the hat. This search takes him all over Paris
in all sorts of clumsy yet hilarious situa
tions.
All the necessary ingredients are there in
cluding mistaken identities, terrible coinci
dences and the usual suspects (the jealous
husband, the lovesick maid, the unfaithful
wife). The result is a fast-moving comedy
that keeps turning and twisting, never stop
ping to take a breath.
"An Italian Straw Hat" is French and has
its share of kissing in it (more than there was
last week at Full Moon on the Quad), but it's
neither salacious nor lewd. Like a sex comedy
for the PG audience, the play provides pure,
clean fun. With sound effects right out of
Three Stooges movies and the frenetic
rhythm of a Groucho Marx comedy, the
humor often slides into pure slapstick,
though no one slips on a banana peel or hit in
the head... well, actually, someone does.
In other words, it's farce, but it's not Sheri
dan. It's French, but it's not naughty. It's deaf,
but it's not silent.
The set looks like an adult toy store, and
the Alice-in-Wonderland costume design
adds to the element of fantasy, so that the
production feels like a live-action cartoon,
with all the bright colors and weird sound ef
fects.

'Whsri's thi freak show?'
Who ever knew deaf people could be so
loud? In the play, they communicate
with audiences through sign language,
facial expressions, and body movement. The
effect is highly cinematic, more visual than
most plays.
The way the hands move — dramatic,
quiet or even rebellious — become part of
the dialogue of the play. The grace of the
movements is clearly expressed as one of the
original goals of the NTD was to show people
the beauty of sign language.
"Sign language was a stigma 28 years ago.
People didn't want to be seen using it," said
Andy Vasnick, a founding member of the
NTD who plays the bride's uncle.
Vasnick credits the NTD for a lot of the
changes in how deaf people are perceived in
this country.
"I think the audiences were a little disap

pointed," Vasnick explained, with all the ex
pansiveness and theatricality due to an actor.
"They're like, 'Where's the freak show?
Where are the deaf people? Where's the deaf
ness?'
"And of course, you can't see it... 'Oh,
they're just like us. Oh, okay' "
"Talking" to Vasnick with the help of an
interpreter, it's hard to think that deaf people
should have any trouble communicating.
Vasnick "talks" with his hands, with his eyes,
both of which qualify him as a good actor. He
isn't limited by speech, by that very thing that
actors often rely on a little too much. Vasnick
literally doesn't depend on his lines in order
to shine.
"It's good for an actor to learn how the
body can be resourceful, and how much
more one can express when one uses all of the
senses," said Adrienne Alitowski, who makes
her debut in the NTD as the bride Helene.

"Learning sign language was a big obstacle
at first," said Alitowski, the only speaking ac
tress, "1 had never worked with actors who
used sign language before. It's been a real
challenge."
Mori hooori thin i Nobil Prisi vlnmr
The NTD is regarded in theater circles as a
national treasure. Highly successful,
considered brilliant, adored by critics,
they often play to sold-out crowds. They've
already won several Tonys, performed in all
50 states, mounted 29 international tours
and were invited to perform at the White
House.
"We've been wanting to have them here
for years, but Berkeley always got them in
stead of us," said Phil O'Shaughnessy, Assis
tant Artistic Director of Lively Arts. "We're
very excited about having them here. Their
work is different from the traditional the
ater performances. It's a great group."
They've done Puccini, Chekhov, Voltaire,
Moliere, even Homer. Their adaptations are
noted for their imaginative sets, for doing
more with less staging and for a unique style
of acting. The visual "subtitles" provided by
the sign language are supposed to add an ad
ditional layer of meaning, and never detracts
from the show.
Their work has been characterized in the
past as "physical and free," known for explor
ing the meaning of the tales they present. The
combination is unlike any other play.
"The NTD is very conscious of trying to
make people aware of the deaf people's con
dition, and to provide the hearing-impaired
with an opportunity to enjoy theater," said
Lois Wagner, Artistic Director of Lively Arts.
Wondirlnl reviews
Hays remembers the difficulties they had
starting out, back in the 1967. Six people
bought tickets to the first NTD perfor
mance.
"When we started playing it was wonder
ful, but before people thought it would be a
strange freak show," Hays said, "it was hard to
get the first tour booked."
But those first tours led to wonderful re
views and those in turn led to longer, wider
reaching tours, according to Hays.
"In the beginning, there were lots of
strange questions," Vasnick said. "Can deaf
people have children? Do they use ears for
