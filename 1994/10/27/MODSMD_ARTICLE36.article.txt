The Advocate
Dead White European (French, 15th
century) Male seeks exotic, erotic,
moralizing gypsy woman whose
pig's honor needs defending. Bad
British accent a plus, must be willing
to accept improbable plot lines and
threat of the Bubonic Plague. Sound
like something you'd find in the per
sonals of The Daily Californian? Try
again. "The Advocate," written and
directed by Leslie Megahey, unites
medieval France and cinematogra
phy in a danse macabre.
Blue Sky
She a nympho, he's a nerd. Togeth
er, what are they? A married couple
who, between the two of them, cause
more controversy on the military
bases they've inhabited than the on
going push for a nuclear-testing ban.
Academy award-winning actor
Tommy Lee Jones stars in "Blue
Sky" as nuclear physicist Hank, a
lone rescuer manning a sinking
lifeboat and tossing innertubes to
drowning blind men. As a soldier/sci
entist responsible for measuring radi
ation levels at U.S. Army nuclear test
sites during the heat of the Cold War,
Hank gets shuttled from base to base
each time he writes an honest report

detailing dangerous practices. With
crazy characters and several dan
gling subplots, "Blue Sky" tugs the
audience's attention just enough to
keep people in the theater. Yet Rama
Laurie Stagner and her co-writers
seem to have tossed in more conflicts
than they can resolve. Overall, it's not
worth the price of admission.
Ed Wood
Direct the worst films in all of Ameri
can cinematic history and what hap
pens to you? Hollywood recreates
your life on the silver screen. Produc
er/director Tim Burton's latest filmatic
endeavor does just that. "Ed Wood"
delves into the relatively unknown
public and curious private life of the
inept horror flick director with a ten
derness and understanding usually
reserved for mainstream heroes and
martyrs.
Jason's Lyric
"Jason's Lyric" is like a cheap box of
chocolates. It looks really good on
the surface, but when you take a bite
it's not as good as you thought. The
film climaxes with a violent, powerful
encounter, complete with automatic
weapons, more sex and your stan
dard massacre. To give credit where

it's due, though, the direction of
Doug McHenry in this scene is out
standing. The problem is that the film
as a whole does not come together.
While the violent world of teens grow
ing up in a ghetto is accurately and
emotionally portrayed, the strengths
of the film are dragged too far down
by the stomach-churning love story,
which only leaves us with a bad taste
in our mouths.
New Nightmare
Writer-director Wes Craven, the cre
ator of "A Nightmare on Elm Street,"
has finally proven that an bad idea
sometimes never dies. In the latest
addition to the "Nightmare" series,
Wes Craven's "New Nightmare," the
evil Freddy Krueger (Robert En
glund) returns to terrorize Heather
Langenkamp (played by herself) in
an uninspired re-hashing of the origi
nal story. Only this time the premise
is even flimsier than usual.
Only You
Move "Sleepless in Seattle" into
Rome, and you've got "Only You,"
starring Robert Downey, Jr. and
Marisa Tomei. Perfectly cast as the
star-crossed lovers, Tomei and
Downey's chemistry lights up the

screen. For Downey, "Only You" is fa
miliar territory; the film is similar to his
other magical, romantic comedies,
such as "Heart and Souls" and
"Chances Are." Tomei also displays a
great feel for comedy, and the
screenplay showcases her abundant
natural charm. At once sweet and
funny, "Only You" is definitely a
heart-warming movie. Go see it —
maybe you'll meet the one you're
destined for in the popcorn line.
Pulp Fiction
It's good.
Damn good.
See it.
Time Cop
The latest installment in the ever
growing series of silly action flicks
starring the oh-so-muscular martial
arts hero Jean-Claude Van Damme,
"Time Cop" comes off as a sort of
"Back to the Future" with less
charm, less character, more guns,
and more blood. It spins the tale of a
time-travel control enforcement offi
cer, trying at once to stop the mis
use of time travel by an evil presi
dential candidate and to prevent the
death of his beloved wife 10 years
before.
