## Bay Area-wide arts festival celebrates African spirit in American art 
### Aïda Croal 
In 1989, a diverse collection of Bay Area visual artists and
scholars sank their teeth into matters of art history, art ed
ucation and multicultural aesthetics in a series of sym
posia entitled, "Sources of a Distinct Majority." Sponsored by
the San Francisco Art Institute, the wrangling debates that
followed the program were so intense that organizers decid
ed to make it an annual venture.
Several years later, the small but influential event expand
ed into the community at large, plunging its participants into
national discussions about the relationship of art to culture.
Among them were Amalia Mesa-Bains, a Chicana artist
working in San Francisco, and Carlos Villa, a Filipino-Amer
ican artist and scholar at the San Francisco Art Institute. Con
vinced that global artistic traditions were the next logical
frontier, the two put the wheels in motion for a sweeping and
more complex program.
Pulling in a San Francisco State University dean and sever
al colleagues, Mesa-Bains and Villa tried to focus their dis
tended vision. At this point, "Face of ihe Gods," an extraordi
nary exhibition of religious altars from Africa and the Amer
icas curated by Robert Farris Thompson at the University Art
Museum at Berkeley, helped the group come to a decision.
Since the African presence in American art is at once large
and largely unrecognized, they thought it only fitting that the
first internationally oriented program focus on African-in
fluenced art in the Americas. According to Paul Dorn at the
SF Art Institute, "when the organizers decided to make 'Face
of the Gods' the centerpiece of the celebration, the whole pro
ject took on a life of its own." With the ground laid, the seeds
for "Odun dd Odun d£" were sown.

In the Yoruba religion of Africa, "Odun d£ Odun d£" is a
yam harvest song with multiple meanings. In some re
gions, the phrase is translated "Everything is Everything,"
and in others, it means "the time for celebration has arrived."
Across the Atlantic, from September to November, "Odun
dd" will signify an extensive celebration of the African spirit
in contemporary art — the likes of which the San Francisco
Bay Area has never seen.
In its infancy, the program was but a glimmer in the minds
of several SF State scholars and a few local artists. But when
the fine arts museums in San Francisco decided to get in
volved, a tidal wave of interest was unleashed. A little over five
years later, at the height of its maturity, "Odun d£" packs a
walloping 20 exhibitions and extends out to over 30 different
venues throughout the Bay Area.
"Sources of a Distinct Majority," the original SF Art Insti
tute series, is at the heart of "Odun d£" 's impressive calendar.
The two-day event, held earlier this month, delved into cur
rent controversies including race and racism in contempo
rary art, the politics of display and, of course, the intercultur
al mix of African influences in American art.
What is considered art? How is art history produced? How
is African-influenced art seen and read in the Americas?
What traditions do African-Americans draw on in their artis
tic expression? These questions and more, generated by the
symposia, grounded "Odun d£" 's diverse array of exhibi
tions, lectures and performances, and helped guide viewer
consumption of these products.
In this context, exhibitions like "Malcom X: Man, Ideal,
Icon" and "Hair Style Boards and Fantasy Coffins from

Africa," both on display at the
Center for the Arts at Yerba
Buena Gardens, could be jux
taposed. A film series titled
"Being Black in Germany,"
and a screening of the late
Marlon Riggs' homoerotic
work fit in as part of the same
program. "Hip Hop Ecology,"
featuring Eco-Rap, brings Bay
Area hip hop artists and the
ater professionals together
with environmental activists.
Odun d£ Odun d£' is
an enormously im
portant and historic
undertaking," Carlos Villa
said. "It's an exceptional col
laboration among our insti
tutions that puts the Bay Area
in dialogue with not only a
national, but a global com
munity."
Highlights of the program
include "Black Power / Black
Art Political Imagery from the
Black Art Movement of the
1960s and 19705," a group exhi
bition and symposium at San
Francisco State University and
a showing of works by local
artists also entitled "Odun d£
Odun d£," curated by intema

tionally known artist Faith
Ringgold at the California Col
lege of Arts and Crafts.
A native of Cuba currently
residing in Miami, Jose Bedia
incorporates elements of the
Afro-Cuban religions, Sante
ria and Palo Monte, to create
politically and culturally
charged paintings and strik
ing mixed-media installa
tions. In one installation,
Bedia depicts buzzards sitting
on telephone lines talking to
each other in Yoruba. In an
other, viewers are confronted
with a chicken sacrifice at an
altar. The 1994 Guggenheim
Fellowship recipient presents
a magical, non-rational
world to highlight very real
world experiences.
Using quotations from
such authors as Jean Genet
and James Baldwin, visual
artist Glenn Ligon extends
the word-as-image tradition
to address race and racism in
his art. Using repeated sten
cils, the words painted on the
canvas like "How it Feels to
be Colored Me" or "Malcom

Martin" take on entirely new meanings.
Visual artist May Sun often collaborates with theater
artists and composers to create room-sized multimedia in
stallations. Born in Shanghai and now based in Los Angeles,
Sun had her "Fugitive Landing" installation shown recently at
Capp Street Project in San Francisco. In"The Chairman and
The Colonel," a fierce depiction of Chinese students demon
strating, Sun overlays an image of Kentucky Fried Chicken's
Colonel Sanders with a red line across his face.
"Odun d£" s approach to celebrating African spirit in art
is both muliticultural and multifaceted. From the satiric and
often experimental work of Bay Area artists with little previ
ous exposure to internationally known exhibitions with big
names and reputations backing them up....
The sky is the limit with this project.
Now Stanford would be slacking if it didn't jump on to this
accelerating train. Fortunately for the campus, when the
Odun d£" committee approached art galleries and educa
tional institutions across the Bay Area to join them, the Stan
ford Humanities Center responded positively. Putting out a
campus-wide A.P.B. for all those doing work on Africa and
African-influenced spirituality, associate director Charles
Jungerman mobilized Stanford scholars and artists.
I he result — "Journey of the Spirit," a spirited Stanford
spinoff of "Odun d£."
With two undergraduate courses, a lecture by a leading
American cultural critic and Stanford alum bell hooks, a
Stanford Drama production of August Wilson's play, "Joe
Turner s Come and Gone," "Journey of the Drums," a dance
performance celebrating the Orisha gods of the Yoruba reli
gion and several other events, Stanford is home to some of
Odun d£ s most comprehensive programming. ■
