# Drama department explores 'diaspora' concept in August Wilson's 'Joe Turner'
## 
### 
Summoned to the 1 lumanities Center's table during
the spring of 1994, Stanford Drama Prof. Harry
Elam was asked what could be done in terms of
drama? The answer was obvious -— a play.
Elam, who has studied playwright August Wilson's
work for a number of years, thought of "Joe Turner's
Come and Gone" almost immediately.
Set at a Pittsburgh boardinghouse in 1911, the two-act
play chronicles the journey of Herald Loomis in his
search his wife Martha.
"The spirituality in the play is so present, in a number
of ways, and that made it the perfect choice," says Elam.
"You have a character in the play, his name is Bynum be
cause he literally binds people together with his root
working. In the show there is a scene where you actually
have him engage in this ritual which involves chicken
blood and dancing and praying. This type of a ritual orig
inates in the Yoruba religion," a form of spirituality high
lighted by several "Odun de" programs and exhibitions.
"Wilson obviously researched it and incorporated its ele
ments into the show."
Judith Williams, graduate student in the Drama De
partment, carried out much of the show's research as its
dramaturge and as one of the actors. Besides researching
Pittsburgh at the turn of the century — the setting of the
play — Williams came to the project with prior knowl
edge of its spiritual material.
"Spirit possession was something I knew about," says
Williams, who has been interested in the Yoruba religion
for quite some time. "One thing I find interesting about
it is that in many places, like Brazil or Cuba, it's preserved
in an almost pure form." Originating in Nigeria, "much
of the language is also retained through the rituals," she
says.
"In Joe Turner, the deity to think about is Ogun, work
er of metal," and harbinger of tragedy, Williams contin
ues. The other prominent deity is Elegba, guardian of the
crossroads and trickster. "In the play he is alluded to as
the one who goes before and shows the wayT
Elam had actors do a homework exercise where they
found examples of black American superstitions in order
to prepare for the show. For August Wilson, the retention
of African spiritual practices in black American life is
wholly positive, reinforcing a persistent link to African
continent. Says Elam, "He set the play in 1911 because he
felt that, since black people weren't far removed from
slavery, they must be in proximity with Africa and
African traditions."
In one scene, the characters join together in the Juba,
a dance that also has Yoruban origins. In the script's stage
directions, Wilson asks that the dance be as "African as
possible." According to Elam, rumor has it that in the dis
cussion session following a performance of the play,
"Wilson got angry at an audience who didn't see his char
acters as Africans, but rather than African-Americans."
Wilson's insistence on merging African and African-
American identity has its problems.
"No one is going to see these people as Africans," says
Elam. "They just won't. The people in that audience
didn't, you won't, they will be seen as African-Ameri
cans."
In general, "Odun d£" 's focus on the notion of
"African Spirit" can be vague and problematic. What is it?
Who decides what it is and what it isn't? What exactly is
its relationship to the African continent? It's also possible
to fall into a romantic idea of Africa that erases geo
graphic location, culture and history in favor of Western
nostalgia.
Wilson's focus on Yoruban cosmology as a means of
linking black Americans directly with Africa could fall

into this trap. The Yoruba religion becomes now what the
Swahili language has been to Afrocentrists in the past —
the universal symbol of Africanity.
Williams is intrigued what she calls "essentialized no
tions of Africa."
"Africa is a colonial invention," she says. "Our claim
ing of the continent is also an invention that's particular
to African-Americans. Africans don't see themselves as
African, they see themselves as Nigerian, Hausan,
Yoruban, I bo."
"Odun de" lecturer bell hooks "... sees this as a prob
lem with regards to black nationalists who idealize Africa,"
says Elam. "They embrace Africa while refusing to recog
nize how politically problematic the continent is."
"There is a problem with Wilson saying that we need
to find our Al rican-ness in order to be free. He also con
siders himself a black nationalist, with all of the problems
that entails." One of the related problems is Wilson's
characterization of women who are often types rather
than three-dimensional people. "1 don't agree with what
he does with his women characters," Elam says.
F.lani contends that there is a less troubled reading of
Wilson's work. "The best thing to do in trying to under
stand where Wilson's coming from is see it in terms of the
African Diaspora.
"He is trying to connect a variety of traditions that
occur where black people are. So it's not just Africa. There
is a connection there, whether it's some kind of shared ex
perience, shared suffering, there is something there. In
Wilson, this connection is symbolized by African-ness,"
he says.
Besides Yoruban cosmology, a more subtle form of
spirituality permeates the play. "Wilson has this idea
about the song and it re-occurs in a number of his plays,"
says Elam. "The idea is that everybody has a song, and is
searching for their song." In the play, Bynum's character
urges the tortured protagonist, Herald Loomis to "sing
his song."
"Liberation would be when you can sing your own
song," interprets Elam.
One major reason for "Odun de" is to expose African
origins / influences in American art. It is as much for a
majority population as for the minority population.
Doing a decidedly black play like "Joe Turner," for a pre
dominantly white campus and audience presents Elam
with a challenging situation in light of "Odun d£'"s goals.
Elam, however, doesn't feel particularly bound by this
reality. "First of all, I want to bring in a larger audience,
people that don't normally come to see theater. Black
people often fit into this category.
"Second, I want to tell this story.
"Wilson operates on a lot of different levels. There are
many places where someone can enter the play. On a
basic level, | Joe Turner | is a story of searching and find
ing— people coming and going and meeting each other.
Anybody can grab a hold of that.
"Not everybody will get everything. That's always the
case. Things like the bones walking across the water, or
the song being the key to one's identity, not just individ
ually, but also a collective African identity, I don't know
who's gonna get that. But the story of the search is com
pelling. It's something we can all relate to." ■

didn't, you won't, they will be seen as African-Ameri
cans."
In general, "Odun d£" 's focus on the notion of
"African Spirit" can be vague and problematic. What is it?
Who decides what it is and what it isn't? What exactly is
its relationship to the African continent? It's also possible
to fall into a romantic idea of Africa that erases geo
graphic location, culture and history in favor of Western
nostalgia.
Wilson's focus on Yoruban cosmology as a means of
linking black Americans directly with Africa could fall

into this trap. The Yoruba religion becomes now what the
Swahili language has been to Afrocentrists in the past —
the universal symbol of Africanity.
Williams is intrigued what she calls "essentialized no
tions of Africa."
"Africa is a colonial invention," she says. "Our claim
ing of the continent is also an invention that's particular
to African-Americans. Africans don't see themselves as
African, they see themselves as Nigerian, Hausan,
Yoruban, I bo."
"Odun de" lecturer bell hooks "... sees this as a prob
lem with regards to black nationalists who idealize Africa,"
says Elam. "They embrace Africa while refusing to recog
nize how politically problematic the continent is."
"There is a problem with Wilson saying that we need
to find our Al rican-ness in order to be free. He also con
siders himself a black nationalist, with all of the problems
that entails." One of the related problems is Wilson's
characterization of women who are often types rather
than three-dimensional people. "1 don't agree with what
he does with his women characters," Elam says.
F.lani contends that there is a less troubled reading of
Wilson's work. "The best thing to do in trying to under
stand where Wilson's coming from is see it in terms of the
African Diaspora.
"He is trying to connect a variety of traditions that
occur where black people are. So it's not just Africa. There
is a connection there, whether it's some kind of shared ex
perience, shared suffering, there is something there. In
Wilson, this connection is symbolized by African-ness,"
he says.
Besides Yoruban cosmology, a more subtle form of
spirituality permeates the play. "Wilson has this idea
about the song and it re-occurs in a number of his plays,"
says Elam. "The idea is that everybody has a song, and is
searching for their song." In the play, Bynum's character
urges the tortured protagonist, Herald Loomis to "sing
his song."
"Liberation would be when you can sing your own
song," interprets Elam.
One major reason for "Odun de" is to expose African
origins / influences in American art. It is as much for a
majority population as for the minority population.
Doing a decidedly black play like "Joe Turner," for a pre
dominantly white campus and audience presents Elam
with a challenging situation in light of "Odun d£'"s goals.
Elam, however, doesn't feel particularly bound by this
reality. "First of all, I want to bring in a larger audience,
people that don't normally come to see theater. Black
people often fit into this category.
"Second, I want to tell this story.
"Wilson operates on a lot of different levels. There are
many places where someone can enter the play. On a
basic level, | Joe Turner | is a story of searching and find
ing— people coming and going and meeting each other.
Anybody can grab a hold of that.
"Not everybody will get everything. That's always the
case. Things like the bones walking across the water, or
the song being the key to one's identity, not just individ
ually, but also a collective African identity, I don't know
who's gonna get that. But the story of the search is com
pelling. It's something we can all relate to." ■

Summoned to the 1 lumanities Center's table during
the spring of 1994, Stanford Drama Prof. Harry
Elam was asked what could be done in terms of
drama? The answer was obvious -— a play.
Elam, who has studied playwright August Wilson's
work for a number of years, thought of "Joe Turner's
Come and Gone" almost immediately.
Set at a Pittsburgh boardinghouse in 1911, the two-act
play chronicles the journey of Herald Loomis in his
search his wife Martha.
"The spirituality in the play is so present, in a number
of ways, and that made it the perfect choice," says Elam.
"You have a character in the play, his name is Bynum be
cause he literally binds people together with his root
working. In the show there is a scene where you actually
have him engage in this ritual which involves chicken
blood and dancing and praying. This type of a ritual orig
inates in the Yoruba religion," a form of spirituality high
lighted by several "Odun de" programs and exhibitions.
"Wilson obviously researched it and incorporated its ele
ments into the show."
Judith Williams, graduate student in the Drama De
partment, carried out much of the show's research as its
dramaturge and as one of the actors. Besides researching
Pittsburgh at the turn of the century — the setting of the
play — Williams came to the project with prior knowl
edge of its spiritual material.
"Spirit possession was something I knew about," says
Williams, who has been interested in the Yoruba religion
for quite some time. "One thing I find interesting about
it is that in many places, like Brazil or Cuba, it's preserved
in an almost pure form." Originating in Nigeria, "much
of the language is also retained through the rituals," she
says.
"In Joe Turner, the deity to think about is Ogun, work
er of metal," and harbinger of tragedy, Williams contin
ues. The other prominent deity is Elegba, guardian of the
crossroads and trickster. "In the play he is alluded to as
the one who goes before and shows the wayT
Elam had actors do a homework exercise where they
found examples of black American superstitions in order
to prepare for the show. For August Wilson, the retention
of African spiritual practices in black American life is
wholly positive, reinforcing a persistent link to African
continent. Says Elam, "He set the play in 1911 because he
felt that, since black people weren't far removed from
slavery, they must be in proximity with Africa and
African traditions."
In one scene, the characters join together in the Juba,
a dance that also has Yoruban origins. In the script's stage
directions, Wilson asks that the dance be as "African as
possible." According to Elam, rumor has it that in the dis
cussion session following a performance of the play,
"Wilson got angry at an audience who didn't see his char
acters as Africans, but rather than African-Americans."
Wilson's insistence on merging African and African-
American identity has its problems.
"No one is going to see these people as Africans," says
Elam. "They just won't. The people in that audience
didn't, you won't, they will be seen as African-Ameri
cans."
