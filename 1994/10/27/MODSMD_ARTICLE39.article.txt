# Three liberal white guys from S.F.

Consolidated: 1) that has become firm or
solid. 2) joined together into a coherent,
compact or unitied whole. 3) tliree whiteguys
producing industrial/hip hop/alternative
music and giving a shout out to every social
issue they can think of.
Go a few rounds with Consolidated and
you feel like you've been hit from all possible
directions. The industrial hip-hop group
steps to lyrical showdowns on anything from
bigot ry to beef-eating while thrashing the hell
out of their music. Often dismissed by critics
as artless l'C pushing noise-makers, Consoli
dated has taken its share of blows as well.
"Business of Punishment" Consolidated s
fourth I I', greets its detractors with a re
sounding "luck you." Incorporating the best
of many musical worlds — heavy metal, al
ternative, straight rock, and even some old
'70s funk — the trio proves that agit-prop

"Business of Punishment"
Consolidated

music is not at all an oxymoron.
Clearly the new album is more marketable
than their others. With its heavy rock and al
ternative leanings, a fresh pool of grunge
rock fans unwilling to slam or hip hop will
undoubtedly find something to groove to.
And no over-the-top anthems like the Yeastie
Girls' "You Suck" to be found here. Sigh.
But don't think for a second that this
means the band has hung up its gloves. The
self-styled "white-boy liberals from San Fran
cisco" continue to pummel their way through
issue after issue.
"Answer for a Pancer," a song riddled with

funky bass-guitar beats,
features lead rapper Adam Sherburne in dia
logue with a female sex-worker who objects to
his brand ot feminism. Rapping, "her points
were intelligent and simple/and I was already
feeling like Mr. Guilty White Liberal." Sher
burne's smooth baritone pushes on to clarify
that his, "only problem is with a society/that
forces women into sexual commodity."
In "Butyric Acid," another head-nodding
hip-hop track about media distortion, Con
solidated doesn't let up. "If you don't want a
Nazi in your house don't let 'cm/you don't
know a fundamentalist 'til you met one/if you
memorize your civil rights don't forget one/il
you don't want an abortion don't get one."
Consolidated saves audience commentary
for the end. "Empower Yourself," uses pre
recorded sound bites of audience members at
various concerts to produce a hilarious trip

into the minds of
Consolidated "fans."
From the philo
sophical observa
tion that, "anybody
who's asking a rock
band to say any
thing sensible is liv
ing in an illusion," to
a proud white gen
tleman's declaration
that "from this mo
ment forth, we are
black lesbians," to
the angry cry "why
don't you go back to

Richards on Richards you dicks!" its evident
that Consolidated takes on all kinds yet
emerges triumphant.
