# New ID's delayed until spring quarter
## 
### Elizabeth Goldman 
A delay in the arrival of plastic
card stock will push back the deliv
ery of new universal Stanford iden
tification cards until spring quarter.
Associate Registrar Jack Farrell
said the system, which will replace
the separate meal and student ID
cards with one photo identification,
is progressing smoothly except for
the card stock problem.
It's mainly the card stock that
has pushed back the date, he said.

"The pieces of plastic didn't arrive in
time to photograph for autumn
quarter."
The new cards originally were
supposed to be ready by winter
quarter.
Stanford ordered specialized
stock from DataCard, a company
which is also providing the other
equipment for the system. Deci
sions on the design of the stock
"took longer than we thought," Far
rell said, "and that's basically where
the delay came from."

The final design will show Stan
ford University, the cardholder's
photograph and a bar code on the
front, with a magnetic strip and
"legal wording" on the back, he said.
Aside from the recent delay,
"things are definitely starting to
click," Farrell said.
The card stock will probably ar
rive within the next two weeks, Far
rell said, but this leaves the Univer
sity too little time to photograph
all students, faculty and stafT.
Farrell said he expects the pro
cess of taking 24,000 photographs,
printing data and a digitized image,
and encoding information onto a
magnetic strip to take all of winter
quarter, but the cards should be
ready in the spring.
"We haven't quite figured out
all the logistics," he said. "There

are issues of networking when it
comes to taking this equipment to
locations other than here in Old
Union that have to be worked
out."
To facilitate the process, Babak
Moghadam has been hired as man
ager for the system, Farrell said.
Moghadam, who began work Oct.
17, has a bachelor's degree in com
puter science and "similar experi
ence," he said.
"The logistics are a challenge,"
Farrell said. "But I'm sure we can
pull it off."
