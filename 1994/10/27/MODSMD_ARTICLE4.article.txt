# New ID's delayed until spring quarter

A delay in the arrival of plastic
card stock will push back the deliv
ery of new universal Stanford iden
tification cards until spring quarter.
Associate Registrar Jack Farrell
said the system, which will replace
the separate meal and student ID
cards with one photo identification,
is progressing smoothly except for
the card stock problem.
It's mainly the card stock that
has pushed back the date, he said.

"The pieces of plastic didn't arrive in
time to photograph for autumn
quarter."
The new cards originally were
supposed to be ready by winter
quarter.
Stanford ordered specialized
stock from DataCard, a company
which is also providing the other
equipment for the system. Deci
sions on the design of the stock
"took longer than we thought," Far
rell said, "and that's basically where
the delay came from."

The final design will show Stan
ford University, the cardholder's
photograph and a bar code on the
front, with a magnetic strip and
"legal wording" on the back, he said.
Aside from the recent delay,
"things are definitely starting to
click," Farrell said.
The card stock will probably ar
rive within the next two weeks, Far
rell said, but this leaves the Univer
sity too little time to photograph
