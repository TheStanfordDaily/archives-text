# Love and Rockets does not stimulate

### 
Do you find yourself constantly thinking
about sex? I )o moments of love, lust, and trust
(not necessarily in that order) fit into your life
in neatly fitting rhyme patterns? It so, then I.ove
and Rockets' "Hot Trip to Heaven," should be
an integral part of your CI) collection.
If, however, you like to be stimulated by
music, then "Hot Trip to Heaven," will bore

"Hot Trip to Heaven'
Love and Rockets

you. It's the kind of music you put on when
doing math problems — bouncy enough to
keep you awake but innocuous enough not to
he annoying or distracting. It's music you play
in your car when you want your passenger to
be both impressed by the scope of your musi
cal tastes ("I )id you know that Love and Rock
ets is Bauhaus minus Peter Murphy?"), and
fully attentive to your conversation (and not
the music itself).
"Hot Trip to Heaven," is a shadow of Love
and Rockets' past; it's hypnotic style is reminis
cent of earlier albums but it lacks the same
acoustic qualities found on classic works such
as "Earth Sun Moon." Daniel Ash's bass-y voice
still vibrates, but the lyrics lack the ability to
throw the listener into a trance state — "Cali
fornia baby you don't know who you are ...
let's just trip and glide with the angels."
Still, any collaboration of David J, Daniel
Ash and Kevin Haskins (who have been work
ing together since the '70s and have established
themselves as talented musicians through

Bauhaus, solo projects and Love and Rockets)
is bound to produce at least a few memorable
moments. "Body and Soul," the album's first
song, qualifies. It is long, fairly mellow and
rings with an intoxicating melody which could
make some listeners think they have been
transported to the twilight zone (speaking of
which, the album is covered in stars, but no
pictures of the musicians... do vampire
types actually age?).
"No Worries," "Ugly" and "Trip and Glide,"
all utilize a female voice (Natacha Atlas) of the

Dead-Can-Dance genre and techno rhythms
to create a pseudo-Middle-Eastern feeling.
"Set Me Free," the album's last song, sounds
like a highly-distorted lullaby.
The rest of "Hot Trip to Heaven" remains
gasping and flopping on Earth. But if one plays
it while engaged in another activity, such as
making love (which Love and Rockets suggest
one always should "get lost in it/ get lost in it/
get lost in it") then one might actually believe
that this CD is fully worthwhile.
