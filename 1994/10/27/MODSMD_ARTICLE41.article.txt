I )ee lays create collages by piecing togeth
er of music in experimental ways to form
new sounds and convey fresh ideas.
The European dance label Stress Records
supplies their unique style of music to
America's Moonshine records to create "1)J
Culture 2." Dee jays Steve Loria and Kimball
Collins provide nonstop mixes of this new,
growing European genre. However, Ameri-

"DJ Culture 2"
Steve Loria and Kimball Collins

canizing this progressive dance style does
not do justice to the special quality of the
original music.
Loria's mix opens with the voice of Kathy
Brown in "Turn Me Out" which brings back
memories of Black Box's "Strike it Up."
Later, however, Loria starts mixing a series of
songs by I lustler's Convention which sound
very much like disco from the Studio 54
years. The mixes fail to bring together the
two styles, connecting only via abrupt, unat
tached and annoying transitions.
In contrast, Florida's Collins does much jus
tice to the cutting-edge, European style. Pre
serving much of the German trance beats, she
varies the foreground sounds and voices just
enough to keep dancers on the floor. The elec
tronic beats are fast and clean and Collins cap
tures many of the computerized sounds that
modern European music brings to the U.S.
To really experience this new progressive
dance form, one is better off buying un
mixed imported European sets over ones
such as these.
