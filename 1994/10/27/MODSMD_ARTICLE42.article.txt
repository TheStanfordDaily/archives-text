"Pisces Iscariot"
Smashing Pumpkins

An eclectic mixture of B-sides and
rarities, "Pisces Iscariot" is a sur
prising yet appealing follow-up to
the Smashing Pumpkins' wildly suc
cessful "siamese dream."
With lead singer/guitarist Billy
Corgan at the helm, the band contin

ues to steer a course beyond the rock
'n' roll establishment. The innovative
sound that propelled them to star
dom — airy melodies floating above
a backdrop of pounding guitars —


also gives "Pisces" its signature quality.
Like its predecessor, "Pisces" transforms
this stylistic duality into a dialectical move
ment, weaving disparate sounds into an en
tirely new form. "Plume," for example, off
sets the shuddering bass of a Black Sab
bath-esque riff with the gentle falsetto of
Corgan's voice, creating an intriguing ten
sion between melody and rhythm.
Although the album's sonic textures are
harnessed with less precision than "siamese
dream's," the result is not altogether negative;
many of "Pisces" 14 tracks boast a refreshing

ly intimate and bold sound. For instance,
"Whir" benefits from the natural resonance
of open acoustic guitar strings, creating a full
bodied sound akin to tempered church bells.
Corgan and fellow guitarist James Iha
continue the tight musical interplay em
ployed on "siamese dream," using guitar ef
fects to create a space-age ambiance laced
with mesmerizing sounds.
This technique culminates with "Starla,"
an 11-minute journey through the stratos
phere. Although the lyrics are unengaging
(featuring predictable Generation-X tru
isms such as "No one else fails like me"), the
overall effect is transforming. Corgan's as
cending guitar hook seems to echo a
weightless space-traveler, drifting effort

lessly toward oblivion.
"Blew Away" is an equally memorable
track, written by Iha (an anomaly for the
Corgan-dominated Pumpkins). Struc
tured around a simple chord pattern, this
melodic tune waxes philosophical on the
simplicity of love.
"Pisces," however, is not void of throw
away tracks. "Hello Kitty Kat" is unimagina
tive and repetitive, while a remake of Fleet
wood Mac's "Landslide" becomes tiresome
due to Corgan's pretentious vocal delivery.
Regardless, "Pisces Iscariot" is a solid
and satisfying assortment of tunes from the
Pumpkins' vault. Turn on the lava lamp,
delve into a Ray Bradbury novel and enjoy.
