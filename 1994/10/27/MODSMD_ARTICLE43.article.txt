"Sounds of Medicine"
Medicine

In the first five minutes of Medicine's new
six-song EP, "Sounds of Medicine," the band
delivers the sweet, soft and hummable "Time
Baby 3," and then promptly bursts into 40
seconds of pure static.
This curious balance between the sooth
ing and the noisy is a Medicine trademark, as
it gives the album its own unique style — a
style that brings plenty of powerful, inven-

"The Disease Of Lady Madeline"
The House of Usher

The extra sweaters, occasional scarves,
and suede gloves. The lake, well, the lake still
looking like the landing grounds of a mete
orite — all indications that fall has once
again ravaged Northern California. And with
the new season, the favorite holiday of lu
natics, pagans, and goths: Halloween.
The House of Usher, one of San Francis
co's leading "goth/industrial/darkwave,"
clubs, has released a compilation CD in time
to greet the scariest of holidays. "The Disease
Of Lady Madeline," features 13 songs by pop
ular local bands ranging in style from semi
ethereal to fairly electronic. The conjures im
ages of death, despair, and, strangely enough,
aliens running amuck.
As with almost any collection of music
which is not intended for a specific listener,
"The Disease Of Lady Madeline," contains
both truly memorable and mediocre songs.
Approximately three-quarters of "The Dis
ease Of Lady Madeline" could be classified as
exceedingly gothy. "Advocate," a comparative
ly cheerful song by Fata Morgana, echoes the
wind's gentle howling and gradual gaining of
momentum. "Sparks," by Faith and the Muse,
features a bittersweet Cure-esque melody en
twined with a female voice exploring the am
biguities of love.

tive, emotionally charged music, but also oc
casionally leads the band astray.
"She Knows Everything" is an example of
Medicine at their best, blending traditional
beauty with industrial experimentation,
evoking Single Gun Theory's moody dance
sound, except with twice the punch. Singer
Beth Thompson's vocals hang wonderfully
suspended above the song's driving drum
beat and blasts of noise.
Equally impressive is "Zelzah," a loud,
surging onslaught of anger, love, confusion
and helplessness. Over layers of pounding
guitar, Thompson's distorted chant resembles
a more passionate rendition of U2's "Numb"

"Charging the Weapon" by Malign is both
elegant and creepy, interspersed with a vague
melody and fascist chanting. Switchblade
Symphony's "Chain," explores and invokes
power through incredibly strong melody, fe
male voice (rather like Siouxie's) and lyrics.
The industrial section of the album fea
tures so much distortion and sampling that
picking up lyrics and melody takes concen
tration. The angry cry of "Chow down Mr.
Spider," in Stones "Smiles From the Asylum"
Bleeding, turned out, after careful inspection

The remaining tracks on "Sounds of Med
icine," however, are curious yet disappoint
ing. Two tracks are just brief interludes, and
the final track, "Lime 6," is over 16 minutes of
mumbled vocals and shrieking guitar feed
hack, which grows tiresome after the first two
or three minutes.
When the songs work, Medicine intrigues
and delights the senses, mixing power with el
egance and heaviness with airiness. Unfortu
nately, their occasional over-reliance on noise
buries the band's considerable talents, thus
keeping this good album from being a great
one.

of the lyric sheet, to be "bow down to spite
her." However, songs such as "The Iron
Helix," by Xorcist, which is apparently about
some unknown entity which changes human
DNA patterns, demonstrate that music can
be potent even with doubtable plot lines.
Overall, "The Disease of Lady Madeline,"
is a dark and enjoyable CD. My only question
is why, if all of the bands are from the San
Francisco area, do most of the singers have
English accents?

"When I Woke"
Rusted Root

I bet you can't hold still while you listen
to Rusted Root. From the percussion fanta
sy of the opening track, "Drum Trip", to the
hoe down harmonica in "Rain" to the desert
rattle of "Laugh as the Sun", this band's new
album "When I Woke" lures you into their
celebration of rhythm.
Arriving out of Pittsburgh, Pa., this seven
member band has been gathering its talents
since 1990 and self-produced their first
album, "Cruel Sun." Now, with big-name
producer Bill Bottrell, they've released "When
1 Woke" as their debut for Mercury Records.
Since over half the band concentrates on
percussion, a mix of African, Middle Eastern,
Latin American and Eastern influences, the
rhythm section absorbs the singers' voices
and shapes Michael Clabicki's lyrics.
Every band member sings, but their voices
always ride shotgun to the bass, drums, congas,
djmbe, talking drum and myriad hand percus
sion. In one of the most appealing tracks, "Cat
Turned Blue," the words become secondary as
the voices are pulled up and down, in and out
of falsettos, wails, yelps and sighs to balance the
prancing flutes and whistles.
In every song, Rusted Root spins into a
frenzy, seeking nirvana or some such high;
and once achieved, they play out a breath of
awed and humble satisfaction. "Cruel Sun"
almost defines the rhythmic curve of their
music as its creeping lows build tension, gain
speed, and spiral to a climax only to hollow
out and seek a new beginning.
In the last seconds, as the final plea to "let
it rain" finds its greatest strength, the rhythm
releases itself and unwinds into a reverberat
ing bass. Throughout eight minutes of highs
and lows, "Cruel Sun" represents the band's
desire to capture the vibe of live performance.
Rusted Root moves like no other band.
They are grounded in a life beat which gets
under your skin and sways you to dance.
You'll easily slide into step as the album de
scends "Back to Earth," the last track, join
ing their cry "Free my soul. .. free my soul."
