"Question the Answers"
The Mighty Mighty Bosstones

What would happen if Bruce Springsteen, the Leland
Stanford Junior University Marching Band and Bob
Marley were all traveling towards each other at high ve
locity somewhere in the Boston area?
They would collide, and out would spring the Mighty
Mighty Bosstones like some multi-headed Greco-
Roman mythical beast.
The Mighty Mighty Bosstones are supposedly the first
Ska band to crossover to the "mainstream." A mixture of
punk, reggae, metal and sheer oddity, the Bosstones try
and try and try to ingratiate themselves with youthful lis
teners. Consequently, the Bosstones' musical influences
range from Elton John to Kiss, and their lyrics laud the
joys of alcohol and deride the boredom that is (according
to them) society. The saga of "Generation X" continues.
Appropriately, listening to the Bosstones fourth
album, "Question the Answers," for any significant
length of time (say 10 minutes) requires a high degree of
intoxication.
In songs such as "hell of a hat," the Bosstones first es
tablish a tune which is half reggae, half brass-horns. They

then attempt to engage the listener by repeating the same
tune progressively faster until cine prays that the song will
end so they can breath and the calm serenity of silence.
There's nothing wrong with chaos; musical discord
can be executed skillfully and powerfully (as some punk
bands, such as Sonic Youth, so gracefully accomplish)
but the Bosstones clearly fail in their attempt.
Vocalist Dicky Barrett often sings about needing a
drink — a thirst which is evident as he delivers mentally
dehydrating tunes in a gravely, scratchy voice. Even when
I )icky tries to croon sexily, as in "A Dollar and a Dream,"
he still sounds as though he is inflicted with a severe
laryngitis. By the tenth song, the Bosstones' monotonous
musical style coupled with Dicky's trite lyrics ("we'd be
much better off 1 bet/ if we'd turn off the TV set") sent me
running for a glass of water to wash down four Advil.
"Question the Answers" is not a complete disaster,
112 irst, it has cool album art: it proudly displays comics of
the kind one would doodle during a really boring CIV
lecture. Second, the last two songs, "Dogs and Chap
lains," and "Jump Through the Hoops," arc actually
amusing. With bouncy beats, shimmering sax playing,
and a pseudo-playful attitude, one could actually dance
to these songs. Perhaps the Bosstones paraphrase best:
"when it's all been said and done/ I raise my beer and
swear Cod it's been fun .. ."
