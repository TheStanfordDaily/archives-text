# Strong cast makes 'Bullets' a near-hit
## 
### 
Woody
Allen's latest
film, "Bullets
over Broad
way," manages
to hit its target,
but fails to
strike the bull's
eye.

While the
cast delivers gen
uine and captivat-

Bullets over Broadway

ing performances, Allen's heavy-handed
writing seems to cast a shadow over the
whole production.
The film is set in New York during the
1920s and centers around the world of gang
sters and, believe it or not, the theater. John
Cusack ("Say Anything," "Better Off Dead")
stars as struggling playwright David Shayne,
who has the uncanny ability to write intense
ly deep plays that flop.
Struggling to find funding for his latest
work, Shayne must turn to mafia don Nick
Valenti (Joe Viterelli) for backing. With
Valenti bankrolling the film — and thus call
ing the shots — Shayne is forced to compro
mise every aspect of his play until he can no
longer stake a claim to being the genuine
artist.
The story is interesting, but you get the
feeling you've seen it somewhere before.
The genius of the film is not in Allen's fre
netic, nervous style but in the actors who
bring his dialogue to the screen. Jennifer Tilly
("Made in America") plays Olive, Valenti's
girlfriend whose

role as the
play's lead

was part
of the
funding
bargain.
Tilly's
perfor
in a n c e
as the
showgirl-

V turned
horrendous-
actress is so con-

vincing that you feel physical discomfort
with every line Olive utters.
Her interactions as Valenti's girlfriend are
equally funny, as she and Viterelli play off
each other successfully.
Chazz Palminteri and Dianne West also
turn in extraordinary performances.
Palminteri, whose major success came

through the pro-

duction ot the
play "A
Bronx Tale,"

port r a y s
(. hc e c ii ,
Olive's
bodyguard
who is
forced to sit
through
every re
hear sal.

The Bronx native gives one of the best
supporting performances of the year.
Palminteri's consistency in his role makes
him believable, as he balances Cheech's soft,
artistic side with the henchman's violent, un
feeling side.
West plays 1 lelen Sinclair, a washed-up ac
tress trying to relive her younger successful
days. The role of Helen would be strong be
cause of the dialogue, no matter who was act
ing.
West, however, claims the lines for herself
making Sinclair that much more authentic.
Further strength-

ening the cast
are Tracey
Ullman and

lim Broad -
bent as ec
centric
members
of the dra
in a t i c
company.
The pair

provides a
good portion of

the laughs.
The movie overall delivers a good bit of
humor backed up by excellent casting and
sincere dialogue.
The acting, however, gets bogged down by
extra subplots and Allen's over-written script.
If it had been slightly more character-driven
rather than plot-based, "Bullets" could have
right on the mark.
