## 'Ermo' sets moving tale in North Chinese landscape 
### 
The upcoming Cinequest V — the San
Jose Film Festival, running November 9 to
13 — has two things going tor it. For one,
its screening venues in San lose and Los
Gatos are tar more accessible than the re
cent Mill Valley event, or even Kabuki,
home of the San Francisco Festival. Fven
more significantly, its inclusion of "Ermo"
offers a rare opportunity to witness stellar
Chinese image-making outside of Zhang
Yimou and Chen Kaige.
Zhou Xiaowen may not be the household
name that fellow Fifth-Generation filmmak
ing colleagues have carved for themselves,
thanks in part to bureaucratic interference
that had plagued Zhou's nine-film career.
Nevertheless, Zhou had served notice of his
abilities nearly a decade ago, when he made
his debut as the assistant director of Yan
Xueshu's 1985 classic "Wild Mountains."
At its core, "Ermo" is very much a suc
cessor of the contemporary moral con
cerns articulated so wittily in "Wild
Mountains" and, to a lesser extent, Zhang's

"The Story of Qiu Ju." As the People's Re
public marches on to ever-escalating levels
of material affluence, are individual con-

Ermo

sciences being trampled all over in the
pandemonium?
As the movies' main character, Ermo
has no doubt what she needs to do to get
ahead in such times. An uncouth peasant
woman married to an elderly invalid,
Ermo learns the ropes of the new social
order in her country — consumerism —
the hard way; her 7-year-old son is forever
sneaking out of the house to watch televi
sion at their next-door neighbor's.
With a twisted sense of inspiration, feisty
Ermo vows to labor hard enough to afford
the county's largest television — a 29-inch
beauty — even if it means leaving the fami
ly to work in the nearest town, or peddling
her vascular assets at the blood bank.
"Ermo" shines not only in its bittersweet
enactment of human tragi-comedy wrought
by endless ethical dilemma but boasts of con
siderable aesthetic qualities as well. The geo
graphical inaccessibility of brutally moun
tainous northern China is rendered majesti
cally by cinematographer Lu Gengxin.
Perhaps the singular achievement of
Zhou's work, which won the top prize at
Switzerland's recent Locarno Film Festival,
is that it finally lends Chinese cinema a
feminist voice, stunning in its blunt, un
polished veracity. As Ermo, talented Alia
breathes life into a female protagonist who
makes no apologies for possessing ambi
tion, making compromises, or succumb
ing to desire, while humbling a couple of
male egos along the way.
And unlike Zhang's heroines who in
evitably wilt in the heat of patriarchal pres
sure, Ermo allows herself to be defeated
only by her own stubborn pride. Zhou's
agenda may be uncharacteristically ironic
in execution, but remains no less subver
sive by its very intent.
