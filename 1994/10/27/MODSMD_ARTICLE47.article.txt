## Stone, Stallone fizzle in cliché-ridden dud 
### 
Billed as an exciting and explosive action film,
"The Specialist" can only deliver half of the goods.
While packed with plenty of actual explosions, some
basic elements of a good movie are lacking — charac
ter and plot.
Following a by-the-numbers storyline, the movie
moves along at a sluggish pace, except for the few
scenes where Sharon Stone and Sylvester Stallone ac
tually interact. The weak and convoluted plot revolves
around May Malone's (Stone) desire to hire explo
sives expert Ray Quick (Stallone) to avenge the death
of her parents by a member of an organized crime

The Specialist

family (played convincingly by Eric Roberts and his
ever-present snarled grin).
Quick is intrigued by the voice that he hears when
he responds to a message on an electronic bulletin
board. The voice, of course, is Stone's and for the first
half of the picture, the audience is left waiting for the
two to finally meet. James Woods plays Ned, Quick's

former CIA partner, in a manner so over-the-top the
audience is left to question his sanity. Woods' dia
logue is written to be menacing yet witty, but he over
acts so much that it comes off as stupidity.
Part of the fun of "The Specialist" is watching
Stone portray the same character from "Basic In
stinct" and "Sliver"— only this time with less feeling.
She comes across as both calculating and devious but
her hair displays more life than her character. Apart
from one convincing scene in which she knocks a

woman out in order to use her cellular
phone, Stone is otherwise ineffectual
throughout the rest of the movie.
Stallone also portrays one of his stereotyp

ical characters, using the film as an opportu
nity to display his physique and agility as he
approaches the age of 50. In a scene designed
to show just that, Stallone beats up the mem
bers of a street gang on a public bus with lit
tle provocation and few plot implications.
Perhaps the movie's greatest strengths are
the explosions and fires which occupy a large
part of the film. Taking the mass-destruction

theme to its limits, one scene even calls for an
explosion which blows an entire suite out of
a hotel and hurtles it into the ocean.
Even though the obligatory sex scene be
tween Stone and Stallone is somewhat tame,
these two stars do make for an interesting
pairing — which is almost enough to make
"The Specialist" worth the price of admission.
