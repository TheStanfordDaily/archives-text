Love Affair

In "Sleepless in Seattle," Meg Ryan's eyes
overflow with tears as she watches the final
scene of "An Affair to Remember," sniffling
and sighing as she fantasizes about her love
life paralleling the movie. Even before
"Sleepless in Seattle" re-popularized the
film, "An Affair to Remember" was a classic,
guaranteed to make you cry and view the
Empire State Building as most romantic
piece of architecture this side of Las Vegas.
"Love Affair" is a not-so-timely remake
of the 1957 Cary Grant-Deborah Kerr weep
er (itself a remake of the 1939 film), this
time starring real-life husband and wife An
nette Beningand Warren Beatty. The movie
sticks pretty close to the original, especially
at the end, changing only the time period
and characters' professions and inexplicably
adding the threat of a plane crash.
Unfortunately for those involved, it is
hard to improve on a classic. Cary Grant and
Deborah Kerr are screen legends, and lines
of dialogue that work in older films do not
necessarily ring sincere in movies today.
Bening just sounds silly saying, "If you can
paint, I can walk," and we won't even talk
about Beatty rattling off, "If something had
to happen to one of us, why did it have to be
you?" Too often, they sound like they're
trapped in a daytime soap opera.
Director Glenn Gordon Caron also
seems unable to do anything new (besides
shooting the entire movie in misty-Cybil-
Shepherd-soft focus), a systemic problem
with remakes.
However, the film is not without a certain
amount of charm, a good deal of which is
supplied by its two stars, even if they don't
measure up to Grant and Kerr. Bening por
trays Terry as both sweet and sarcastic while
Beatty carries out the character of Mike as a
picture of dejection standing alone at the
top of the Empire State Building. For all its
flaws, the film still gets you right there when
you see the lonely figure standing in the rain
for hours.
The supporting cast's small roles do not
do justice to their immense talents. Kate
Capshaw says about three lines as Mike's fa
mous fiancee and Pierce Brosnan barely
tops that as Terry's ever-so-rich boyfriend.
The wonderful Chloe Webb also goes wast
ed as Terry's token buddy while Garry Shan
dling provides comic relief doing his regular
schtick as Mike's star-struck lawyer.
A classic script and strong acting qualify
"Love Affair" as a decent movie, especially
for the romantic. However, the problem is
this: Why pay $7.50 to see a paler version of
a great film one can rent for $3.15? lake a
trip down to Blockbuster, sack out and cry
for two hours. I'm getting a little emotional
just thinking about it.

The Browning Version

If old traditions die hard, then old classics
teachers die even harder. This is the premise
of the subtle, artful and very British film "The
Browning Version," which builds the tension
of meaningful-life issues enough to induce
mid-life crisis.
Andrew Crocker-Harris (Albert Finney),
known as "the Hitler of the Lower Fifth," has
been pressured to retire from the exclusive
British boarding school at which he teaches.
Yet even such bastions of conservatism change
and Crocker-Harris'department is being elim
inated in favor of a modern languages pro
gram.
He so intimidates his students that they
can't wait to see him go. When a former pupil,
who is now the youngest brigadier in the
British army greets him, the soldier finds
himself quaking like a schoolboy, whispering,
"I'm still terrified of the old bugger." The only
student who likes him is Taplow, whom
Crocker-Harris tutors in Aeschylus'
"Agamemnon."
Director Mike Figgis creates a manipula
tive parallel between the Greek tragedy and
Andrew's own marriage. Although the cou
ple is somewhat distant, theirs should not be
dismissed as a typical British marriage.
Our first impression of Laura Crocker-
Harris (Greta Scacchi) is that of a subdued
housewife, patiently standing behind her
man. So what if she is ridiculously younger

than him, they don't talk to each other, and she
is having an affair with the American science
teacher (Matthew Modine)? It is only a matter
of time until one considers the crucial ques
tion (which is as apparent as Laura's mustache
is). This key issue takes us back to the days of
Agamemnon: Why are they married?
Because they are afraid to be alone, we re
alize as the Crocker-Harrises are people who
know the ship is going down and cling to
gether— until he loses his job, his dignity, his
wife's fidelity and she realizes that she has
nothing — until the two, drowning, must

break apart or die. This is the first time we can
actually empathize with the characters, the
moment we've been waiting for.
We feel sorry for Andrew because he does
not belong to our time. He seems a simple
man whose values are as antiquated and dis
respected as the epics he teaches. Taplow is
the only student to appreciate his teacher and
he says good-bye with a gift — the Browning
version of the "Agamemnon."
We leave the theater satisfied, relieved and
determined to do something with our lives.

Love Affair

In "Sleepless in Seattle," Meg Ryan's eyes
overflow with tears as she watches the final
scene of "An Affair to Remember," sniffling
and sighing as she fantasizes about her love
life paralleling the movie. Even before
"Sleepless in Seattle" re-popularized the
film, "An Affair to Remember" was a classic,
guaranteed to make you cry and view the
Empire State Building as most romantic
piece of architecture this side of Las Vegas.
"Love Affair" is a not-so-timely remake
of the 1957 Cary Grant-Deborah Kerr weep
er (itself a remake of the 1939 film), this
time starring real-life husband and wife An
nette Beningand Warren Beatty. The movie
sticks pretty close to the original, especially
at the end, changing only the time period
and characters' professions and inexplicably
adding the threat of a plane crash.
Unfortunately for those involved, it is
hard to improve on a classic. Cary Grant and
Deborah Kerr are screen legends, and lines
of dialogue that work in older films do not
necessarily ring sincere in movies today.
Bening just sounds silly saying, "If you can
paint, I can walk," and we won't even talk
about Beatty rattling off, "If something had
to happen to one of us, why did it have to be
you?" Too often, they sound like they're
trapped in a daytime soap opera.
Director Glenn Gordon Caron also
seems unable to do anything new (besides
shooting the entire movie in misty-Cybil-
Shepherd-soft focus), a systemic problem
with remakes.
However, the film is not without a certain
amount of charm, a good deal of which is
supplied by its two stars, even if they don't
measure up to Grant and Kerr. Bening por
trays Terry as both sweet and sarcastic while
Beatty carries out the character of Mike as a
picture of dejection standing alone at the
top of the Empire State Building. For all its
flaws, the film still gets you right there when
you see the lonely figure standing in the rain
for hours.
The supporting cast's small roles do not
do justice to their immense talents. Kate
Capshaw says about three lines as Mike's fa
mous fiancee and Pierce Brosnan barely
tops that as Terry's ever-so-rich boyfriend.
The wonderful Chloe Webb also goes wast
ed as Terry's token buddy while Garry Shan
dling provides comic relief doing his regular
schtick as Mike's star-struck lawyer.
A classic script and strong acting qualify
"Love Affair" as a decent movie, especially
for the romantic. However, the problem is
this: Why pay $7.50 to see a paler version of
a great film one can rent for $3.15? lake a
trip down to Blockbuster, sack out and cry
for two hours. I'm getting a little emotional
just thinking about it.

The Browning Version

If old traditions die hard, then old classics
teachers die even harder. This is the premise
of the subtle, artful and very British film "The
Browning Version," which builds the tension
of meaningful-life issues enough to induce
mid-life crisis.
Andrew Crocker-Harris (Albert Finney),
known as "the Hitler of the Lower Fifth," has
been pressured to retire from the exclusive
British boarding school at which he teaches.
Yet even such bastions of conservatism change
and Crocker-Harris'department is being elim
inated in favor of a modern languages pro
gram.
He so intimidates his students that they
can't wait to see him go. When a former pupil,
who is now the youngest brigadier in the
British army greets him, the soldier finds
himself quaking like a schoolboy, whispering,
"I'm still terrified of the old bugger." The only
student who likes him is Taplow, whom
Crocker-Harris tutors in Aeschylus'
"Agamemnon."
Director Mike Figgis creates a manipula
tive parallel between the Greek tragedy and
Andrew's own marriage. Although the cou
ple is somewhat distant, theirs should not be
dismissed as a typical British marriage.
Our first impression of Laura Crocker-
Harris (Greta Scacchi) is that of a subdued
housewife, patiently standing behind her
man. So what if she is ridiculously younger

than him, they don't talk to each other, and she
is having an affair with the American science
teacher (Matthew Modine)? It is only a matter
of time until one considers the crucial ques
tion (which is as apparent as Laura's mustache
is). This key issue takes us back to the days of
Agamemnon: Why are they married?
Because they are afraid to be alone, we re
alize as the Crocker-Harrises are people who
know the ship is going down and cling to
gether— until he loses his job, his dignity, his
wife's fidelity and she realizes that she has
nothing — until the two, drowning, must

break apart or die. This is the first time we can
actually empathize with the characters, the
moment we've been waiting for.
We feel sorry for Andrew because he does
not belong to our time. He seems a simple
man whose values are as antiquated and dis
respected as the epics he teaches. Taplow is
the only student to appreciate his teacher and
he says good-bye with a gift — the Browning
version of the "Agamemnon."
We leave the theater satisfied, relieved and
determined to do something with our lives.
