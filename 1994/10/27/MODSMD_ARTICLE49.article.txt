# Scott James' 'Hoop Dreams' Illustrates Potential Pitfalls of 'Objective' Documentary
## 
### Janar Stewart 
Whether it be due to Wilt Chamberlain's
100-point game in the '60s, Michael Jor
dan and the Chicago Bulls' threepeat at the
NBA Finals, or Shaq's backboard-shattering,
monster dunk, the allure of pro basketball has
swept thousands of bright-eyed boys off their
nimble feet.
For hours every week, these star-struck Amer
ican youths hone their fade .iwavs, reverse spins
and tomahawks, each one with the galactic hope
of one day releasing swish after swish tor their fa
vorite team on an NBA court.
Scott lames, director of the basketball docu
mentary, "Hoop Dreams," also dared to dream
about pro ball while growing up. All throughout
his pre-college years, James swore he would play
professionally.
"Basketball was my life," he savs, admitting
that his love for the sport sidelined academics and
other areas in his life at the time. Though the pri
macy of his pro ball goal died not long after play
ing for Virginia's James Madison University, thai
love continues to flicker.
Leaning his tall, casually dressed frame back
into San Francisco's Prescott Hotel chair, James
only half- jokingly describes himself'and his fellow
filmmakers — producer Frederick Marx and di
rector of photography Peter Ciilbert — as "basket
ball junkies."
Now more fascinated with the idea of the
dream than the dream itself, James says they "set
out to film that dream as it is experienced by
African-American youth."
And thus spawned the creation of "Hoop
I)reams," the 171 -minute documentary featuring
two black kids from

Chicago's infa
mous Cabrini

Agee and

tured, slick film, "Hoop Dreams" follows the
boys' basketball careers from age 13 to their re
spective high school graduations.
But why did James and company choose to
follow African-American inner-city youths and
not mainstream kids?
"I sensed the dream was a much more compli
cated thing for them than [for] me," James says,
alluding to the black boys who played with him
back when he still yearned to don a professional
jersey.
As anyone with a middle-class upbringing
swiftly will attest, the minuscule probability of
any given boy reaching the pro ball level, let alone
starting for a winning team, ought to be enough
to prevent any sane individual from banking on
such odds.
Yet lames sees more in these inner-city kids
than star-struck naivete.
"These kids are not stupid," he says, gesticulat
ing with his right hand as if mere words couldn't
emphasize his point well enough.
"Playing ball got both of those kids to Catholic
private school," James continues, enumerating
other benefits such as jobs and an identity.
According to James, inner-city youths — ex
pecting everyone from the media to the police to
treat their community's members as statistics—
see the greater value of having one's name and
visage in the local paper for great ball-playing.
"Hoop Dreams" accentuates these benefits in
several scenes, one in which James (as narrator)
implies Arthur lands a pizza-parlor job thanks to
his basketball status and another in which the film
reveals a private sponsor who pays William's high
school tuition.
Yet the ethics involved with such under-the
table assistance pales in significance when juxta
posed against sequences which depict Arthur and
his teammates buying athletic shirts and shoes
with gang money or against the potent scene in
which Arthur tells his parents how he was mugged
at gunpoint.
Despite a few intense revelations here and
there, "Hoop Dreams" only skims the pages
of the ghetto youth's non-basketball story.
Because of the three-act structure (boys-follow
dream, boys-encounter-hardship, boys-over
come-hardship), the script focuses more on the
foreground story than on the many troubling is
sues raised along the way.
"1 think we wanted this film to be a compelling

narrative," lames agrees, adding that he, Marx and
Gilbert did not neglect the character development
despite the importance of the feature-film style.
Yet by opting for a commercial, Hollywood ap
proach rather than the traditional "objective"
documentary style, the filmmakers' vision actual
ly commodifies the two boys whose stories it is
supposed to share.
Mostly because the film fails to uncover any
thing new or distinct, Arthur and William end up
as caricatures of statistics: inner city boys shoot for
NBA sky, land in dead-end jobs.
One minute, we are told via narration that
Arthur's father Bo beats his mother, does drugs,
and squanders money. Next we seeacleaned-up Bo
Agee participating in Arthur's choice of which col
lege to attend.
Not only is this sprung on us, but the most fric
tion we see at that crucial moment is a smirk or two
from Arthur. It's business as usual with the Agee
family.
Also out of the blue, William, the phenom, his
coach's great basketball hope (endlessly com
pared to former Detroit Piston Isiah Thomas)
suddenly appears in a scene with a girl and a baby.
Yes, you guessed it. Somehow he fathered a child
behind the backs ot his intense coach, his strict
older brother, his corporate sponsor and even the
cameras that had been in his face for more than
five years.
I low did that happen?
"Much of what you see in the film is the way we
found things out," James explains.
but the film makers still had a choice: either to
integrate the discovery into their narrative struc
ture or to simply show it for what it was and leave
it at that.
According to James, the film makers felt the
greater dramatic effect stemmed from the latter.
Thus, we never learn how such a valuable player
could go through school without sufficient con
traceptive education.
As far as Mr. and Mrs. Agee's destructive rela
tionship went, James disagrees that any details are
relevant to the main story.
"We felt like it was important that you knew
what happened, but we did not feel we should give
the audience the grizzly details," he relates, adding
that audiences receive enough of that kind of info
from the plethora of morning and afternoon talk
shows.
According to James, Sheila Agee (Arthur's
mother) gave valid reasons for taking Bo back. He
says she said, " 'If I can get some kind of help, it's
better than no kind of help.' "
Perhaps even more troubling than dangling issues,
certain parts of the film leave room for viewers to ques
tion its veracity. In three distinct talking-liead scenes,
the audience notices clever dissolves which lead it to
wonder just what has been cut out.
According to James, he chose to follow

William because
of his coach's
(Gene Pingatore)
legendary status as

the man who trained
Isiah Thomas.
"I moved (to Chica
go) with the express
purpose of doing this

film," he says. Pin
gatore then intro
duced James to tal
ent scout Earl
Smith who
then led him /

to Arthur.
"Earl's
recruit-

ing sonar just
went off," he
says, sharing
the fact that

they chose Arthur
because they hoped
his story would provide
an interesting comparison

with William's.
Once again the ethics flag
waves furiously hack and
forth. In "Hoop Dreams," Earl

Smith discusses his own moral dilemma. As a
black man who yanks young black boys from their
communities and replants them at St. Joseph's, a
primarily white Catholic school, Smith hasn't
made many friends in the African-American
community.
For most kids, Smith indirectly saddles their
blue collar parents with a tuition bill they may or
may not be able to pay. Arthur's story depicts a
worst case scenario (i.e. what can happen when
your parents cannot pay and you don't play well
enough for wealthier people to bail you out).
As we viewers watch the Agee's struggle with
that situation, we wonder, where were the film
makers during all of this? How can they film this
and keep their objective distance?
"We didn't have the money," James says. "We
were spared that ethical question."
He further clarifies their position by pointing
out that by paying one semester's bill, the film
makers would not necessarily solve the Agee's
problem.
"We would have had to make a bigger com
mitment than that," he adds. ■

says she said, " 'If I can get some kind of help, it's

Perhaps even more troubling than dangling issues,
certain parts of the film leave room for viewers to ques

the audience notices clever dissolves which lead it to
wonder just what has been cut out.

William because

(Gene Pingatore)
legendary status as

the man who trained
Isiah Thomas.

Smith discusses his own moral dilemma. As a
black man who yanks young black boys from their
communities and replants them at St. Joseph's, a
primarily white Catholic school, Smith hasn't
made many friends in the African-American
community.
For most kids, Smith indirectly saddles their
blue collar parents with a tuition bill they may or
may not be able to pay. Arthur's story depicts a
worst case scenario (i.e. what can happen when
your parents cannot pay and you don't play well
enough for wealthier people to bail you out).
As we viewers watch the Agee's struggle with
that situation, we wonder, where were the film
makers during all of this? How can they film this
and keep their objective distance?
"We didn't have the money," James says. "We
were spared that ethical question."
He further clarifies their position by pointing

Whether it be due to Wilt Chamberlain's
100-point game in the '60s, Michael Jor
dan and the Chicago Bulls' threepeat at the
NBA Finals, or Shaq's backboard-shattering,
monster dunk, the allure of pro basketball has
swept thousands of bright-eyed boys off their
nimble feet.
For hours every week, these star-struck Amer
ican youths hone their fade .iwavs, reverse spins
and tomahawks, each one with the galactic hope
of one day releasing swish after swish tor their fa
vorite team on an NBA court.
Scott lames, director of the basketball docu
mentary, "Hoop Dreams," also dared to dream
about pro ball while growing up. All throughout
his pre-college years, James swore he would play
professionally.
"Basketball was my life," he savs, admitting
that his love for the sport sidelined academics and
other areas in his life at the time. Though the pri
macy of his pro ball goal died not long after play
ing for Virginia's James Madison University, thai
love continues to flicker.
Leaning his tall, casually dressed frame back
into San Francisco's Prescott Hotel chair, James
only half- jokingly describes himself'and his fellow
filmmakers — producer Frederick Marx and di
rector of photography Peter Ciilbert — as "basket
ball junkies."
Now more fascinated with the idea of the
dream than the dream itself, James says they "set
out to film that dream as it is experienced by
African-American youth."
And thus spawned the creation of "Hoop
I)reams," the 171 -minute documentary featuring
two black kids from

Chicago's infa

tured, slick film, "Hoop Dreams" follows the
boys' basketball careers from age 13 to their re
spective high school graduations.
But why did James and company choose to
follow African-American inner-city youths and
not mainstream kids?
"I sensed the dream was a much more compli
cated thing for them than [for] me," James says,
alluding to the black boys who played with him
back when he still yearned to don a professional
jersey.
As anyone with a middle-class upbringing
swiftly will attest, the minuscule probability of
any given boy reaching the pro ball level, let alone
starting for a winning team, ought to be enough
to prevent any sane individual from banking on
such odds.
Yet lames sees more in these inner-city kids
than star-struck naivete.
"These kids are not stupid," he says, gesticulat
ing with his right hand as if mere words couldn't
emphasize his point well enough.
"Playing ball got both of those kids to Catholic
private school," James continues, enumerating
other benefits such as jobs and an identity.
According to James, inner-city youths — ex
pecting everyone from the media to the police to
treat their community's members as statistics—
see the greater value of having one's name and
visage in the local paper for great ball-playing.
"Hoop Dreams" accentuates these benefits in
several scenes, one in which James (as narrator)
implies Arthur lands a pizza-parlor job thanks to
his basketball status and another in which the film
reveals a private sponsor who pays William's high
school tuition.
Yet the ethics involved with such under-the
table assistance pales in significance when juxta
posed against sequences which depict Arthur and
his teammates buying athletic shirts and shoes
with gang money or against the potent scene in
which Arthur tells his parents how he was mugged
at gunpoint.
Despite a few intense revelations here and
there, "Hoop Dreams" only skims the pages
of the ghetto youth's non-basketball story.
Because of the three-act structure (boys-follow
dream, boys-encounter-hardship, boys-over
come-hardship), the script focuses more on the
foreground story than on the many troubling is
sues raised along the way.
"1 think we wanted this film to be a compelling

narrative," lames agrees, adding that he, Marx and
Gilbert did not neglect the character development
despite the importance of the feature-film style.
Yet by opting for a commercial, Hollywood ap
proach rather than the traditional "objective"
documentary style, the filmmakers' vision actual
ly commodifies the two boys whose stories it is
supposed to share.
Mostly because the film fails to uncover any
thing new or distinct, Arthur and William end up
as caricatures of statistics: inner city boys shoot for
NBA sky, land in dead-end jobs.
One minute, we are told via narration that
Arthur's father Bo beats his mother, does drugs,
and squanders money. Next we seeacleaned-up Bo
Agee participating in Arthur's choice of which col
lege to attend.
Not only is this sprung on us, but the most fric
tion we see at that crucial moment is a smirk or two
from Arthur. It's business as usual with the Agee
family.
Also out of the blue, William, the phenom, his
coach's great basketball hope (endlessly com
pared to former Detroit Piston Isiah Thomas)
suddenly appears in a scene with a girl and a baby.
Yes, you guessed it. Somehow he fathered a child
behind the backs ot his intense coach, his strict
older brother, his corporate sponsor and even the
cameras that had been in his face for more than
five years.
I low did that happen?
"Much of what you see in the film is the way we
found things out," James explains.
but the film makers still had a choice: either to
integrate the discovery into their narrative struc
ture or to simply show it for what it was and leave
it at that.
According to James, the film makers felt the
greater dramatic effect stemmed from the latter.
Thus, we never learn how such a valuable player
could go through school without sufficient con
traceptive education.
As far as Mr. and Mrs. Agee's destructive rela
tionship went, James disagrees that any details are
relevant to the main story.
"We felt like it was important that you knew
what happened, but we did not feel we should give
the audience the grizzly details," he relates, adding
that audiences receive enough of that kind of info
from the plethora of morning and afternoon talk
shows.
According to James, Sheila Agee (Arthur's
mother) gave valid reasons for taking Bo back. He
says she said, " 'If I can get some kind of help, it's
