# Progress made for minority graduates
## Provost will present report to Fac Sen 
### Beth Berselli Senior staff writer 
A new report shows that
the University's recent per
formance in recruiting, re
taining and graduating tar
geted minority graduate stu
dents is not as dismal as
many thought.
Although Stanford did
not reach a 1989 goal to dou
ble the number of minority

graduate students by this Dekker
year, the 49-page report reveals that solid
progress has been made over the past few
years.
Provost Condoleezza Rice will present the
final report of the Provost's Committee on the
Recruitment, Retention and Graduation of
Targeted Minority Graduate Students to the
Faculty Senate today.
The report shows that Stanford's profes
sional schools — Law, Medicine and Business
— have posted substantial gains in their re
cruiting, retention and graduation rates for
targeted minority graduate students, said
Assoc. Dean of Graduate Policy George
Dekker, chair of the committee.
"In my view we've done surprisingly well
considering that there were very few resources
put into this effort," he said.
Rice formed the committee in November
1993 to review University-wide performance

over the past 10 years in targeting minority
graduate students, especially African Ameri
cans, Mexican Americans, Native Americans
and Puerto Ricans.
Students also drew attention to the issue by
staging a demonstration at last spring's Grad
uate Minority Admit Weekend. Carrying signs
reading, "We need you more than ever," pro
testers claimed that Stanford's recruitment ef
forts are not sufficient.
As part of its study, the provost's committee
conducted surveys, held open forums and gath
ered input from minority students on the com
mittee before submitting its final report to the
provost in June.
The report contains seven recommenda
tions which call for schools to develop c r update
a five-year diversity plan and for University
President Gerhard Casper and Rice to contin
ue giving priority to fundraising for minority
student recruitment programs.
The committee also recommends that
Casper and Rice provide "high-profile public
championship of the principles of the 1989
University Committee on Minority Issues re
port," which sets forth the goal of doubling the
number of minority graduate students by this
year.
Committee member Lori White, a doctoral
student in the School of Education, said she
feels the best thing about the report is that it
contains "feasible" recommendations
