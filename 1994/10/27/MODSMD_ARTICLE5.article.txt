# Progress made for minority graduates
## Provost will present report to Fac Sen 
### Beth Berselli Senior staff writer 
A new report shows that
the University's recent per
formance in recruiting, re
taining and graduating tar
geted minority graduate stu
dents is not as dismal as
many thought.
Although Stanford did
not reach a 1989 goal to dou
ble the number of minority

graduate students by this Dekker
year, the 49-page report reveals that solid
progress has been made over the past few
years.
Provost Condoleezza Rice will present the
final report of the Provost's Committee on the
Recruitment, Retention and Graduation of
Targeted Minority Graduate Students to the
Faculty Senate today.
The report shows that Stanford's profes
sional schools — Law, Medicine and Business
— have posted substantial gains in their re
cruiting, retention and graduation rates for
targeted minority graduate students, said
Assoc. Dean of Graduate Policy George
Dekker, chair of the committee.
"In my view we've done surprisingly well
considering that there were very few resources
put into this effort," he said.
Rice formed the committee in November
1993 to review University-wide performance

over the past 10 years in targeting minority
graduate students, especially African Ameri
cans, Mexican Americans, Native Americans
and Puerto Ricans.
Students also drew attention to the issue by
staging a demonstration at last spring's Grad
uate Minority Admit Weekend. Carrying signs
reading, "We need you more than ever," pro
testers claimed that Stanford's recruitment ef
forts are not sufficient.
As part of its study, the provost's committee
conducted surveys, held open forums and gath
ered input from minority students on the com
mittee before submitting its final report to the
provost in June.
The report contains seven recommenda
tions which call for schools to develop c r update
a five-year diversity plan and for University
President Gerhard Casper and Rice to contin
ue giving priority to fundraising for minority
student recruitment programs.
The committee also recommends that
Casper and Rice provide "high-profile public
championship of the principles of the 1989
University Committee on Minority Issues re
port," which sets forth the goal of doubling the
number of minority graduate students by this
year.
Committee member Lori White, a doctoral
student in the School of Education, said she
feels the best thing about the report is that it
contains "feasible" recommendations

"They can all be implemented in
a relatively small period of time and
require a relatively small economic
investment by the University,"
White said.
However, Dekker said the report
"does not include any sensational
new discoveries."
"You don't have people saying
'wow' when they read the report
because there's nothing there to say
'wow' about," he added. "The report
is essentially a confirmation of the
things that most well-informed peo
ple were already aware of."
Biological Sciences Prof. Robert
Simoni, chair of the senate, said
today's meeting will serve as a gen
eral discussion of the report's find
ings.
Because the report was commis
sioned by the provost's office, senate
members will not be responsible for
implementing any of the recom
mendations.
"Faculty am and probably will
express their opinions of the report,
but it's up to the provost to address
the recommendations," Simoni
said.
The report will serve to raise
"public awareness that we're not
doing as dismally as one might have
thought," Simoni said. "It was real
ly a very good report."

Dekker said he anticipates that
some senators may question the
report's recommendation to use
additional resources to strength
en recruiting and retention
efforts at the school and depart
ment level.
"Some faculty will undoubtedly
ask if this is the best way to spend
our money," Dekker said. "Howev
er, we're not asking for the Univer
sity to spend vast amounts of
money."
In fact, the administration
recently contributed to the effort by
supporting the ethnic centers and
augmenting the recruiting staff in
the School of Humanities and Sci
ences, he said.
The finding that minority gradu
ate students frequently experience
isolation and stereotyping may also
cause debate at today's senate meet
ing, Dekker said.
"There's always some disagree
ment about the extent to which
racial stereotyping is a problem at
the University," he said.
The report concludes that "many
students of color feel isolated in
their department and encounter
behavior based on stereotypifying
assumptions about their abilities,
interests and preferential treatment
at the hands of the admissions or
hiring committees."
It was difficult to come up with
hard objective data to support this
finding because it's of a "relatively
subject nature," Dekker said.
