CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) - A judge
yesterday gave the three killers of Stanford
graduate and Fulbright scholar Amy Biehl
18 years in prison instead of the death penal
ty, saying they had a chance to become use
ful citizens despite showing no remorse.
Mongezi Manqina, 22, Mzikhona
Nofemela, 19, and Vusumzi Ntamo, 23, all
members of the black militant Pan African
ist Students' Organization, might appeal
their convictions in Biehl's Aug. 25, 1993,
slaying, defense lawyer Justice Poswa said.
High Court Judge Gerald Friedman said
Biehl "was killed for one reason only, name
ly because she had white skin."
He noted that Biehl had come to South
Africa to support the cause of the disadvan
taged.
A Fulbright scholar from Newport
Beach, Calif., Biehl was in South Africa
helping to educate voters. She was set upon
by a mob chanting anti-white slogans when
she drove black friends home to the impov
erished Guguletu township outside Cape
Town. She was bludgeoned and stabbed to
death.
"This was a cold-blooded and brutal mur
der carried out by a mob on a defenseless

young girl of 26 who had al
ready sustained a serious
injury to her head from
which she was bleeding
profusely," the judge said
solemnly.
Poswa said he also
would explore an amnesty
for his clients, though pros
ecutor Nollie Niehaus said
he would oppose any such
move.

If the three men can demonstrate to a
proposed commission that their crime was
politically motivated, admit their guilt and
give a full account of their actions, they
could qualify for amnesty under a bill now
before parliament.
Outside, two dozen young blacks chanted
"Settler! Settler! Bullet! Bullet!" and ran
through the streets after learning of the sen
tence. "Settler" is a term used for whites by
black militants in South Africa.
Ntamo's mother, Nomhle, said she felt
more sorry for the victim's parents than for
herself.
"She's gone and they won't see her any
more. Our sons are coming back," she said.
