### Jo Marshall Staff writer 
At an Escondido Village Town Hall meeting last
night, University administrators made a firm com
mitment to address mounting housing concerns in
Escondido, announcing a plan they hope to imple
ment by next fall.
"The commitment we want to make is that we
don't want students moving into unclean apart
ments," Keith Guy, director of Housing and Dining
Services, told the 35 Escondido residents who at
tended the two-hour meeting.
Guy said his office plans to establish an Escondi
do Village Operations Review Group to recommend
solutions to cleaning and maintenance issues raised
recently by Escondido residents.
The committee will be comprised of administra
tors such as Rodger Whitney, Associate Director of
Housing and Dining Services and Chris Griffith,
Director of Graduate Residences, in addition to four
Escondido residents.
Guy also said Housing and Dining will imple
ment a preventative maintenance program, includ
ing an annual inspection of all apartments, a regu
larly scheduled interior painting program, and
campaigns of pro-active maintenance work.
"I think there's been a shift in focus from under-

graduates to meeting the needs of
graduate students," Guy said.
Guy's response comes after a
closed meeting last week, where he
and Vice Provost and Dean for Stu
dent Affairs Mary Edmonds met
with Escondido Village Family
Council members to discuss the
endemic problem of residents mov
ing into unclean apartments.
Whitney explained that one of
the problems with cleaning apart
ments is the short time to clean
them in September before new ten
ants move in.
He also said the implementation
— possibly by next fall — of an on
line computer system to catalog
move-ins and maintenance sched

ules would help reduce a lot of the
back-logs.
Many of the residents at the
meeting voiced the need for speed
ing up the Capital Improvement
Plan. At present, 250 apartments
in Escondido have been renovated.
Guy responded that, as part of
the plan, his office will replace all
remaining old refrigerators in
Escondido by Aug. 31,1995, and all
remaining old stoves by the follow
ing year.
