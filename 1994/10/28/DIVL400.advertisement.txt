Mary Kay Blakely
American Mom:
Motherhood, Politics, and Humble Pie
(Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill, $19.95)
Publishers Weekly calls
Mary Kay Blakely's memoir
American Moms Potitica,
Motherhood, and Humble Pie a
"warm, candid, touching, fiercely
loving account of raising two
sons." In a voice both witty and
wise, Blakely tells of rearing her
sons in the midst of the women's movement and shows that good fami
ly values aren't necessarily traditional ones. The book is also a politi
cal lesson of sorts, a crystallized view of raising children in a time
when old-fashioned motherly concerns about homework and clean
rooms have been supplanted by fears about AIDS, drugs, teenage sui
cide, anorexia, and violence.
Blakely's essays on social and political issues have been published
in The New York Times, The Washington Post, Newsday, Vogue,
Mirabetla and many other national publications, and she is a frequent
lecturer on college campuses.
