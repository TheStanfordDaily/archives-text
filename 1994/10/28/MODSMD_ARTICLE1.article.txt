## GOP Quayle visits Farm 
### Sarah Katz Editorial staff 
Taking time out from campaigning for Cali
fornia Republican congressional candidates, for
mer Vice President Dan Quayle stopped at Stan
ford yesterday for lunch at the Hoover Institu
tion.
Quayle gave an off-the-record speech about
politics and his political career to a group of about
100 Hoover fellows, faculty members and other
community members. He was invited to campus
by Hoover Distinguished Fellow and former Sec
retary of State George Shultz and by Hoover Di
rector John Raisian.
In an interview with The Daily after the lun
cheon, Quayle discussed his political aspirations
and the trends he sees in this year's elections.
Speculation abounds about Quayle's possible
bid for the Republican candidacy in the 1996
presidential election, but the former vice presi
dent said he has not yet made up his mind.
"You saw what I'm doing now — I had a con
versation with people here, giving them my per
spective of the world and of relations between
foreign and domestic policy. I took a lot of ques
tions," he said.
"After the first of the year, I'll be making a de
cision. I'll be asking friends and supporters if
they think my ideas are what we need today," he
continued.
Quayle added that he would "have to talk it
over with Marilyn and the kids first."
Throughout his four years as vice president,
and especially during former President George
Bush's failed re-election campaign in 1992,
Quayle suffered extensively from negative media
coverage.
As he thinks about running today, the bad
press from his earlier political career is some
thing he realizes he will have to deal with, Quayle
said, especially if he wants to convince young peo
ple to vote for him.
"It's too bad they couldn't hear me today," he

Institution luncheon.
said of his Hoover speech, which
was well-received by the audience.
"Unfortunately, too many peo
ple in America have perceptions of
me from the first week of the '88
campaign," said Quayle, who has
recently released "Standing Firm,"
a book detailing his experiences as
vice president. "First impressions
are very important in politics," he
said.
This time around, however,
Quayle said he feels the media will
be forced to treat him differently.
"I'll be running for president,
not vice president," he said. Giving
more speeches like the one he gave
yesterday will only enhance his
public image because the media
"will report on what I have to say,
but will also have to report on the
reaction of the audience," he said.
"It's an uphill battle and I've
always been an underdog . . .but if
I go for it, I'll be out there — com
mitted," he added.
The former vice president has
also taken a lighter approach to
improving his negative media
image, appearing a few weeks ago
on "The Tonight Show with Jay
Leno."
"We had a lot of fun," Quayle
said. "He let me analyze Bill Clin
ton's golf swing on TV.... I looked
at it and said, 'he's going to hit that
ball to the far right — that's not a

position he's comfortable with.' "
Quayle also discussed this
year's congressional elections, par
ticularly the increased national
support for Republican candidates.
President Clinton's current
visit to the Middle East to celebrate
the Israel-Jordan peace treaty "is
having a stemming-of-the-tide
effect," meaning the movement to
elect more Republicans is "now on
hold," Quayle said.
But, he added, "our people are
energized. People are generally fed
up with Washington. . .We'll
return to the real issues of the
day."
Quayle also said he supports
California Proposition 187, a con
troversial ballot initiative which
would make undocumented immi
grants ineligible for public educa
tion, public health and social ser
vices.
The former vice president —
who served in the U.S. House of
Representatives from 1976-80 and
in the U.S. Senate from 1981-88 —
has been spending the last few
months helping Republicans
around the country raise funds for
their campaigns, said Lair
Kennedy, Quayle's personal assis
tant.
After his Hoover appearance,
Quayle campaigned for Ben Brink,
the Republican challenger to Con
gresswoman Anna Eshoo,
Kennedy said.
