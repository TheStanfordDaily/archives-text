## GOP Quayle visits Farm 
### Sarah Katz Editorial staff 
Taking time out from campaigning for Cali
fornia Republican congressional candidates, for
mer Vice President Dan Quayle stopped at Stan
ford yesterday for lunch at the Hoover Institu
tion.
Quayle gave an off-the-record speech about
politics and his political career to a group of about
100 Hoover fellows, faculty members and other
community members. He was invited to campus
by Hoover Distinguished Fellow and former Sec
retary of State George Shultz and by Hoover Di
rector John Raisian.

and the trends he sees in this year's elections.
Speculation abounds about Quayle's possible
bid for the Republican candidacy in the 1996
presidential election, but the former vice presi

"You saw what I'm doing now — I had a con
versation with people here, giving them my per
spective of the world and of relations between
foreign and domestic policy. I took a lot of ques

"After the first of the year, I'll be making a de
cision. I'll be asking friends and supporters if
they think my ideas are what we need today," he
continued.
Quayle added that he would "have to talk it
over with Marilyn and the kids first."
Throughout his four years as vice president,
and especially during former President George
Bush's failed re-election campaign in 1992,
Quayle suffered extensively from negative media
coverage.
As he thinks about running today, the bad
press from his earlier political career is some
thing he realizes he will have to deal with, Quayle
said, especially if he wants to convince young peo
ple to vote for him.
"It's too bad they couldn't hear me today," he
