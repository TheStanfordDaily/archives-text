## Clinton visits Syria, meets with Assad President cautiously praises Syrian leader in address to Israeli Knesset 
### 
JERUSALEM (AP) — In extraordi
nary talks in Syria, President Clinton
said yesterday that President Hafez
Assad "went beyond anything he said
before" on making peace with Israel.
Clinton then sped to Jerusalem to meet
with Israeli officials who said progress,
indeed, had been made.
Assad, who has built his career on
confrontation with Israel, spoke anew of
"full peace" in return for the Golan
Heights and Israeli withdrawal from
southern Lebanon. Clinton told the
Israeli Knesset, "Something is changing
in Syria."
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin
expressed confidence Israel could over
come differences with Syria and
Lebanon, the last two holdouts to peace
among Israel's neighbors.
"It might take time. One has to be
patient," Rabin said. "I believe that it
will not take long and hopefully we'll
find ways and means by which to over
come these gaps."
Clinton announced Secretary of State
Warren Christopher would return to the
Middle East in a few weeks on a fol

lowup peace mission.
While Clinton stressed that a peace
treaty was not at hand, U.S. officials
believed Assad showed new and promis
ing signs of flexibility.
After the first trip to Syria by an
American president in 20 years, Clinton
observed that Assad spoke openly about
transforming the region from a state of
war to a state of peace enabling Arabs
and Israelis to live in security, stability
and prosperity.
"We have been urging President
Assad to speak to you in a language of
peace that you can understand," Clinton
said in an evening address to the Knes
set. "Today he began to do so."
Clinton's assurances were welcome
news in a nation where tensions are
high after a surge of terrorism by Mus
lim extremists. Israeli officials
expressed disappointment that Assad
did not publicly renounce terrorism,
though Clinton said he had done so pri
vately. In public, Assad heatedly denied
that his country supports terrorists.
"Perhaps there's been a softening,
but a softening of opening positions is

still required and that still hasn't hap
pened," Israeli Foreign Minister Shi
mon Peres said after being briefed by
Christopher.
Christopher cautioned, "There's
long, tough negotiations ahead."
Midway through rugged three-day trip
through sue Mideast countries, Clinton
bade farewell to King Hussein in Jordan,
flew to Syria for talks at Assad's hilltop
palace and then went on to Israel where
he placed a wreath at a monument out
side the Knesset to Israel's fallen soldiers.
En route to Israel, Clinton admitted,
"I'm really tired."
Nevertheless he popped into the
plane's conference room with a cake to
celebrate Christopher's 69th birthday.
Clinton revealed that Jordan's Hussein
and Queen Noor had tricked his wife,
Hillary, on her 47th birthday Wednes
day with a cake lighted by candles that
couldn't be blown out.
Clinton decided against visiting
Jerusalem's holy places after a tentative
ly planned tour stirred up a political
ruckus between Israelis and Palestinians,
who dispute jurisdiction over the areas.
