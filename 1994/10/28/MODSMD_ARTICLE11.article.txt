Prop 187 losing support
SAN DIEGO (AP) — Voter support
for a ballot measure to cut public services
to illegal immigrants has fallen sharply
in the last few weeks as the initiative has
grabbed center stage in California's elec
tions, two new polls indicate.
Opponents of Proposition 187 called
the new figures inspiring.
"It's a tremendous shift," said Joel
Maliniak, spokesman for the No on 187
campaign. "This once and for all dispels
the notion that Proposition 187's pas
sage is inevitable."
But supporters predict the drop in
support will level out and the measure
will still be approved by voters Nov. 8.
In recent weeks the debate over Prop
187 has become more and more heated
with accusations of racism and hypocrisy
flying back and forth.
Prop 187 would deny non-emergency
health care and welfare to illegal immigrants.
It also would prohibit illegal immigrant chil
dren from going to California schools, despite
a 1982 Supreme Court decision saying they
have equal right to education.

And it would require school, hospital
and social workers to turn illegal immi
grants in.
According to a Los Angeles Times poll,
51 percent of likely voters now back the
measure and 41 percent oppose it. That
was a sharp drop from a Times survey
just two weeks ago, indicating 59 percent
support and 33 percent opposition.
Among all registered voters, the mea
sure is ahead 51 percent to 39 percent.
Controversial law
BEIJING (AP) — The Chinese legisla
ture yesterday ratified a law that calls for
aborting fetuses carrying hereditary dis
eases and restricts marriages among peo
ple suffering mental problems or conta
gious diseases.
The innocuous-sounding Maternal
and Infantile Health Care Law goes into
effect June 1.
The official Xinhua News Agency did
not release the full text of the law or say
what penalties, if any, apply to violators.
Many Chinese laws are loosely enforced
and penalties have little deterrent effect.
