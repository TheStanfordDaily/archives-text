DESPITE RELATIVE stag
nation in the crime rate,
crime may be California's
hottest issue. The media has creat
ed an almost hysterical fear of
crime that boiled over with the

Polly Klaas tragedy.
The push for a "three
strikes tmd you're out" law
became intense, and Proposi
tion 184 was placed on the
ballot. In an election-year
rush to be "tough" on crime,
politicians (especially Gov.
Pete Wilson) sacrificed pru-

dence and have already enacted an
exact replica of 184.
Unlike other three-strikes
plans, this new law requires only
the first two felonies (strikes) to be
serious or violent. The third strike
can be any felony. The law crosses
constitutional lines by tallying
juvenile offenses. Finally, it counts
residential burglary as a strike.
Thus, someone who steals two
bikes at age 17 and then forges a
check at 40 now faces life in prison.

The costs will be astronomical.
For example, making residential
burglary a "strike" increases costs
by 356 percent, or $4.1 billion,
according to State Department of
Corrections estimates. And an esti
mated 75 percent of third-strike

convictions will be neither
serious nor violent.
To pay for this, the state
will have to make sacri
fices in other budget areas
— like law enforcement
and education — which

are just as important in
preventing crime. Opponents of
the new law (including Marc
Klaas, Polly's father) pushed to get
a more focused proposal on the bal
lot, but the governor refused them.
Approval of 184 would not
change the law but would affirm it,
making future changes politically
difficult.
But if voters reject 184, Sacra
mento will know that Californians
want a strong yet prudent
response to crime.
