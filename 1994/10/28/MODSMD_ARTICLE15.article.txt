# Snuff out Prop. 188
## 
### 
PROPOSITION 188 IS a fraud
that should be stamped with a
Surgeon General's warning.
At first glance, it may appear to
regulate public smoking. In truth,
however, the tobwcco industry —
right after telling Congress smoking
is neither addictive nor harmful —
created 188 to gut this state's exist
ing smoking restrictions. Because
voters would reject 188 if they fully
understood it, Philip Morris is try
ing to trick them, and has pledged to
spend up to $20 million on this
deception.
Philip Morris claims that 188 will
impose a tough smoking standard for
restaurants and workplaces. In reali
ty, it would wipe out all state and
local smoking laws and block future
restrictions, substituting a weak,
loophole-filled standard instead.
Philip Morris claims that 188

will keep cigarettes away from kids.
Not true. It will actually eliminate
California's new programs to stop
tobacco sales to minors. Further
more, the measure's advertising
and vending-machine restrictions
were designed to be ineffective.
Philip Morris claims 188 is pro
health and pro-business. But major
health organizations (e.g. the Ameri
can Lung Association, the American
Cancer Society and the American
Heart Association) strongly oppose
188, as do business groups like the
California Restaurant Association.
Philip Morris is hoping that a
last-minute barrage of deceptive ads
and attention to other ballot issues
will allow it to hide what 188 really
is — a despicable attempt to fool us
into trading in our health for tobac
co industry profits. With luck, vot
ers will see through the smoke.
