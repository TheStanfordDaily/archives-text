## Paul Namphy Haiti needs international help to rebuild 
### 
ON OCT. 15, Jean-
Bertrand Aris
tide, Haiti's
democratically elected
President, returned
home, ending a three
year period of military
rule marked by slaugh
ter, mutilation, rape,
torture, and illicit

enrichment. Haitians now have future
hopes to enjoy a minimum of well-being
and affirmation, progressing "from misery
to poverty with dignity," as Aristide says.
Majiy Haitians are now returning
home from abroad during these historic
times, wishing to contribute to the coun
try's I was able to travel home for
three days to witness and rejoice in the
return of Aristide, who visited the Stan
ford campus last April.
The country has rejoiced many times
before: in 1804, when their revolution
drove out the French colonists who
brought them to the island as slaves after
the genocide of the indigenous peoples,
and they founded the first black republic
and the second independent nation in
this hemisphere; in 1934, during the cel
ebration of the "second independence" as
19 years of American occupation drew to
a close; during the 1986 departure of dic
tator Jean-Claude Duvalier. Yet each
time, joy soon turned to disappointment,
as the leadership was uninclined or
unable to better people's lives, and Haiti

experienced again and again the cycle of
ruthless internal power struggles, deca
dence and inequality, and external
manipulation. The hope generated by the
Aristide presidency was also short-lived.
Drawing on history's lessons, Aristide's
return is so far an uneasy victory.
The United States' role seems ambigu
ous. President Clinton officially promoted
the restoration of President Aristide and
democracy, and Haitians reacted favor
ably as the army, police, FRAPH death
squads and the attaches began to be neu
tralized after the occupation began. Yet
the CIA, it was revealed, financed FRAPH
leader Emmanuel Constant throughout
the coup period, and has also leaked false
reports questioning President Aristide's
mental competence, engaging in what
Aristide terms "character assassination."
It seems that more than one U.S. govern
ment is acting at a time.
In this uncertain political atmosphere,
democracy must be fully supported. Pres
ident Aristide, a survivor of numerous
assassination attempts, must be protect
ed to fulfill his role as a symbol of the vic
tory of justice, tolerance and reconcilia
tion over atrocity-marked arbitrary rule.
Key are an independent parliament and
judiciary and a civilian police force
responsible to the Ministry of Justice.
Popular organizations must be able to
work to uplift Haiti's disenfranchised
masses without intimidation, particular
ly in the countryside. Death squad activi

ty, which took the lives of Minister of
Justice Guy Malary, businessman
Antoine Izmery, Father Jean-Marie Vin
cent and countless students and organiz
ers, must cease in the future.
An international presence is necessary
to fulfill such goals. The ideal outcome
would be the constitutional dissolution of
the Haitian army, which since its incep
tion as the Garde d'Haiti during the
American occupation has only sought to
further its self-interest through power
plays, smuggling, extortion and human
rights abuses, at everyone's expense.
Costa Rica is doing fine without an army
â€” so could Haiti.
The urgency and media coverage of
those imperatives perhaps masks ques
tions about the economic policies which
will ultimately shape Haitian's lives, and
thus also require discussion. Is Haiti to
become a cheap-labor shop for interna
tional capital, marked by bloated cities
and a violent rural exodus jeopardizing
the country's identity? Or will the
enfranchisement of the 70 percent rural
dwellers be the goal of future Haitian eco
nomic policy? Will those dignified citizens
be the main actors, or passive objects
pushed around by interests of the capital
city and foreign companies?
Will the government and the grass
roots be able to defme people-oriented,
rurally based solutions to the country's
