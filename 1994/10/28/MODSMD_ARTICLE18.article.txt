Don't discover Prop. 187's evils by making it law

Supporters of proposition
187 would have us believe that the
"Save our State" Initiative (more
aptly named "Sink our State" by conser
vative gubernatorial candidate Ron Unz)
is a panacea for our state's economic woes
and an answer to our illegal immigration
"problem." It will be unfortunate if we
have to realize the fallacy of these claims
only after the measure passes. Some of
the brutal consequences of the proposi
tion include an exacerbation of racial ten
sions and discrimination, a public health
crisis, problems in law enforcement and
an increase in educational deprivation.
Supporters of Proposition 187 believe
that illegal immigration is the cause of our
state's economic problems and argue that
California's economy is being crippled by
the cost of providing health care, social ser
vices and education to undocumented per
sons. Yet not only do supporters fail tc con
sider the tax revenue (from both sales and
income taxes) and economic benefit
derived from these same people, propo
nents also fail to consider the potential cost
of implementing the initiative if passed.
The nonpartisan office of the state leg
islative analyst estimates that Proposi
tion 187 would cost up to $100 million in

the first year alone to administer — effec
tively offsetting half of the direct savings
alleged by the measure's proponents. The
thought of the additional administrative
burden under a post-187 California has
led prominent law enforcement officials,
the California Medical Association and
the California Teacher's Association to
oppose the measure.
Potentially most devastating, howev
er, 187 would place at risk up to $15 bil
lion ($1,600 per taxpayer) in federal
funds for education, health and welfare
programs that are currently earmarked
for California. Why? Because Proposition
187's requirement that teachers, health
professionals and social service providers
both inquire about and disclose informa
tion regarding students, patients and
clients (without their consent) violates
federal regulations that govern the
receipt of federal funds.
"Save our State" also carries many
indirect costs. It would deny medical care
(except in emergency cases) to undocu
mented immigrants. Procedures out
lawed include prenatal care, immuniza
tions and testing for AIDS and other sex
ually-transmitted diseases. As a result,
Proposition 187 threatens public health.

Communicable diseases do not discrimi
nate between individuals who are in the
country legally versus illegally. Hence,
the failure to immunize young children
places all of us at risk. By discouraging
undocumented immigrants from seeking
basic preventive health care, Proposition
187 would force these immigrants to wait
for treatment until costly emergency pro
cedures are necessary, thereby increasing
dramatically the state's long-term cost of
providing health care.
By throwing children (including U.S.
citizen children whose parents are undoc
umented) out of school, Proposition 187
would produce future generations of Cal
ifornians with severe educational deficits
— something we would all pay for in the
form of higher crime rates and a less edu
cated work force.
Immigrants come to this country pri
marily to get jobs and to join their loved
ones in the United States, not for educa
tion, health or social services. This bill
will do nothing to change the fact that the
majority of people who come to this coun
try, legally and illegally, do so because the
situation faced at home is far more des
perate. The additional sacrifices required
by Proposition 187 will not change that.

Section 7 of Proposition 187 provides
that undocumented immigrants should
be excluded from public schooling. The
Supreme Court, however, in Plyler v. Doe
(1982), held that such measures violated
the constitutional principle of equal pro
tection. Proposition 187's opponents are
sure to challenge the constitutionality of
Section 7 if the measure passes, leading
to a protracted legal fight in addition to
the wasted costs and energy associated
with the measure's passage.
Regardless of its constitutional status,
Proposition 187 exemplifies the politics of
"divide and conquer." Passage of the ini
tiative would encourage a McCarthy-like
suspicion of people of color and people
who look, speak or act "foreign." It would
also, for obvious reasons, wreak havoc on
the lives of many undocumented people.
As Californians, we are destined to live
in a state that is increasingly diverse.
Consequently, a politics based on division
rather than unity is not only immoral, it
is an impractical long-term solution to
our state's problems.
