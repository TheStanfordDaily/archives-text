# Review's use of Native American caricature an insult to people of color
## 
### 
We write to take issue with the deci
sion of The Stanford Review to use a
demeaning caricature of Native Ameri
cans, "The Chief," in their publication.
The use of the cartoon offends us on
many levels. The cartoon harks back to
the "good old days," a time when Native
Americans (or any other people of color,
for that matter) were virtually nonexis
tent on the Stanford campus. For most

people of color, it is a time we would just
as soon forget.
Probably most offensive, however, is
that the caricature trivializes and belit
tles Native Americans with its stereotyp
ical portrayed of an angry Indian, eyes
bulging, tomahawk in hand, complete
with headband and feather. This sort of
provocative behavior has no place in o
university' which attempts to foster an
environment to promote the free
exchange of ideas between people of dif
ferent backgrounds and perspectives.
When Stanford made the decision to
discontinue the use of the Indian mascot,
it made a difficult but wise choice. Stan
ford was, in fact, leading other universi

ties in re-examining how it portrays peo
ple of color. As with any decision, there
were some who were dissatisfied and con
tinue to this date to voice their objection
to abandoning the mascot. This current
dissatisfaction does not, however, make it
right to continue a practice that is offen
sive and dehumanizing. The use of the
caricature of Native Americans does not
fall within the category of free discourse
which should be protected or promoted.
The cartoon is a painful insult which
inhibits our ability to engage in meaning
ful discussion and which no one should be
made to suffer. We encourage the staff of
The Review to reconsider its use in their
publication.
