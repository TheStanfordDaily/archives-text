### Brian Singer Contributing writer 
In what unexpectedly became a
one-sided debate, a representative
of U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein
praised the senator for her spon
sorship of four major bills in Kim-

Jude Barry, a chief
aide to Santa Clara
County Supervisor Ron
Gonzales, took advan
tage of the cancellation
from the team of rival
candidate Michael
Huffington to criticize
the Santa Barbara con
gressman's lack of gov
ernment experience.

"I don't think I should be a U.S.
Senator [with only ten years of
government experience], but
[Huffington] does, so that's why
I'm here," said Barry, who for
merly worked for Sen. Edward
Kennedy D-Mass.
The event was supposed to be a

ELEOION
94

debate between representatives of
both candidates, but the Huffing
ton team canceled just two hours
before the start, said Julie Cantor,
a coterminal student. Even so,
students gathered to question
Barry about Feinstein's platform.
"This was going to be a biparti
san event," Cantor said. "We were
not trying to sway peo-

pie in any way."
Barry lauded Feinstein
for her work on the as
sault weapons ban, the
crime bill, the Desert
Protection Act, and her
work to keep small- and
medium-size downsiz
ing defense firms in

business.

"If politics were like baseball,
she would be both Rookie of the
Year and a first-team All Star,"
Barry said.
Although Barry criticized Huff
ington's negative ad campaigns,
he did not discount the general
use of negativity for political pur
poses. "One of the reasons people
use negative campaigning is
because it works," he said.
Barry said the primary source
for information is the television,
and that is the reason both candi
dates are spending millions of dol
lars on television advertising. "A

political rally today is four people
sitting around a TV," he said.
"People are getting news in a
very different way than they did
one generation ago," Barry said.
"That's why TV advertising is so
powerful."
He attributed Feinstein's drop
in approval rating to HufTington's
negative television campaign.
Barry did criticize Feinstein
for not expressing goals for the
future in her platform, saying she
is instead campaigning on what
she has achieved in the past.
