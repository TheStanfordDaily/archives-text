## In Italy, they (don't) work a little differently

FLORENCE, ITALY
THERE ARE A lot of differences, big
and small, between America and
Italy. Here in Italy, there is good
food, bad driving and bizarre fashion.
There in America, there is bad food, good
driving and bizarre fashion. Here, thou
sands of pilgrims every year journey to see
the Vatican. There, thousands of pilgrims
every year journey to see Graceland.
And then there is the striking difference
between Italy and America. That is, the dif
ference in striking. I'm no labor expert (I
don't even know where to look for the
union label), but I can't help but notice that
everywhere I turn, people aren't working.
Fred's not hitting the covers off base
balls. Giovanni's not punching my ticket on
the treno. But while they're both on strike,
they're not working in very different ways.
First, a word on strikes in Italy — all
the stereotypes are true. In four weeks
here, I have been treated to a bank strike,
a bus strike and a train strike. About 10

days ago, Italy hosted the mother of all
strikes — the general strike.
The curious thing about Italian
strikes, though, is that while prevalent,
they don't have that much effect. Not to
say that Italian strikes are all bark and no
bite. Yes, there are people marching in the
streets, shouting slogans and carrying
banners. But behind all the pageantry,
strikes here are, well, civilized.
In Italy, all strikes are scheduled sev
eral days in advance. One can generally
discover who won't be at work during
what hours, and the strikes generally last
a day or less, so one can plan around
them. Strikes here cause little more
inconvenience than American govern
ment offices closing on Memorial Day.
Even the sciopero generate — in which
almost all government employees and
many private employees refused to work
— caused surprisingly little disruption.
The strike was an impressive show. In
Florence alone, thousands of workers
marched. Many dressed in red, carrying ban

ners decorated with a hammer and a cycle of
salty slogans. Demonstrators filled a town
square and spilled over into the surrounding
streets. But while dramatic, the general
strike was relatively peaceful. There was lit
tle or no violence. Everyone in Italy knew
about the strike two weeks in advance. Many
stores posted whether or what hours they
would be open on the strike day; others only
closed while the demonstrators walked by.
The buses even ran part of the day.
What a contrast to the United States.
Granted, at first U.S. strikes seem relatively
civilized. Marching and protests are politely
restricted to the place of employment, where
most of us don't have to see them, except
through the safety blanket of a TV screen.
But strikes in America always bring
with them a certain level of fear. The
striking worker fears that he may lose his
job and that his family will go hungry.
The owner fears that he may lose his job
and that his company will go out of busi
ness. There is the fear of scabs and the
violence that often travels with them. No

one knows when the strike will end.
And, at least in one case, a strike in
America seems to be having a much
greater societal effect than Italian strikes.
Not long before I left, one couldn't turn
on the TV, read a newspaper or go out in
public without hearing about the baseball
strike. I heard middle-aged men shout in
anger about the situation. I was subjected
to countless stories of dejected children
and worried hot-dog vendors.
All this because a few hundred men
were not working. All these men have
enough money that they don't need to
worry about going hungry. The owners,
too, are well off and don't really need to
sweat. Still, the strike seemed to be the
most important thing in American life. If
baseball was the national pastime, how
much more so seemed the strike.
Strikes in Italy and America occur for
different reasons, too. Here, strikes are
very often political — the general strike
was called to show opposition to Italy's
conservative government, which is trying

to cut the nation's generous pensions. The
strike was less about wages or specific job
complaints than about the left showing off
its political power to the right. Back in
Indiana, we'd call it a pissing contest.
In America, the strikes are generally on
a specific employment issue, usually
restricted to one office or company, perhaps
an industry. Strikes have ceased to be a
political show as much as an economic tool
Even allowing for this difference, it is
strange that a couple hundred rich men
refusing to play a game has caused more
trauma and disruption in America than a
general strike of workers, complete with
marches in the streets, caused in Italy.
Maybe the Italians could learn some
thing from America about conducting
labor disputes. Or would that be the
other way around?
