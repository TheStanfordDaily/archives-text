# Old, new fee ideas to merge
## 
### Michael Slemmer Editorial staff 
Last spring, when nearly
half the student groups
requesting special-fee funding
failed to pass them, many called
for a complete overhaul of the
ASSU fee system.
But the product of the newly
appointed special-fee task force
will likely be a combination of
new and old — echoing the 25-
year history leading up to this
most recent revision.
Council of Presidents mem
ber Anietie Ekanem said he
believes the "old system" may
provide clues about ways to
reform the special-fee process
this time.
"I wouldn't want to go all the
way back to the [original] sys
tem," he said at Wednesday
night's task force meeting. "But
I think we can reach some sort of
happy medium."
The fee system originally
designed in the 1969 ASSU Con
stitution — after the last major
overhaul of Stanford's student
government — began with only
two special fees. The ASSU Sen
ate allocated money to all other
groups without a direct student
referendum.
In contrast, former graduate
senator Doug Bone said the sys
tem now emphasizes special fees
as a major source of funding for
larger student groups. Smaller
organizations can still receive
money from general fees allocat
ed by groups such as the Pro
gram Board, he said.
Under the original system, a
referendum determined the total

amount of fees to be levied. After
the ASSU took a share for its
operating expenses, the senate
split the remaining money
among student organizations.
No one group's budget could
exceed 20 percent of the total
money allocated.
The constitution allowed
groups needing additional funds
to apply for the special fee, which
would help them fund larger pro
jects with the approval of the
entire student body.
By 1971, the second year
under the new fee system, there
were only two special fees on the
ballot — a $2 assessment for the
Stanford Band and an equal fee
for The Stanford Daily.
Since then the number of spe

cial fees has increased 15 times.
Though senators have pro
posed dozens of possible amend
ments to the fee system, only
two ever passed.
In 1982, students voted six to
one in favor of a special-fee plan
which instituted a system where
all students who had voted the
previous year were eligible for a
fee refund. An amendment in
1993 again increased student
power by allowing students to
get refunds, regardless of
whether they had voted the pre
vious spring. '
Other proposals have ranged
from a "voluntary" fee system
— in which students would
choose which groups to fund
rather than take refunds from

the groups they didn't want to
fund — to amendments abolish
ing refunds altogether. All of
these failed.
Even so, Ekanem said that
strides have been made from the
system initially proposed in 1969
to the current process. "We grad
uated from that old system," he
said.
Currently, because most stu
dent groups are funded through
special fees, the student body
can decide on the assessments
after they pass the senate.
"I guess people felt the senate
wasn't really representative,"
Ekanem said of the shift toward
a special-fee dominated system.
"A large number of people mobi
lized against that system."
