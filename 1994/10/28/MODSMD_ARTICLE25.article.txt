In an attempt to avoid the cancellation of non-urgent surg
eries, the Stanford Medical School Blood Center has sent
out an urgent joint appeal for new donors in cooperation
with several other Peninsula centers.
The center is currently suffering a severe blood shortage
— a shortage that could lead to postponing scheduled surg
eries. For example, the center tries to keep 275 units of ex
positive blood in reserve at all times — it now has only 120.
Anyone older than 17 can donate blood. Those over 71
need a note from a physician stating that It's safe to give
blood. The Stanford Blood Center, at 800 Welch Road, can
be reached by calling (415) 723-7831.
