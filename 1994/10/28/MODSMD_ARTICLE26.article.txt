## Paramedic Bowl Cardinal, UCLA face off 
### Greg Collins Senior staff writer 
My, how times have changed.
At the beginning of the sea
son, this Saturday's matchup
between Stanford and UCLA
promised to be a key game
between potential Rose Bowl
candidates. However, after both
teams' prolonged losing streaks,
neither the Cardinal (2-4-1, 1-3
in Pacific 10 Conference) nor the
Bruins (2-6, 0-5) look anything
like bowl-bound teams.
Unlike UCLA, who remains
mired in a six-game slide, Stan
ford's victory over Oregon State last
weekend has buoyed the team's
spirits. Now, with a consistent run
ning game and senior quarterback
Steve Stenstrom's ability to make
the sensational seem ordinary, the
Cardinal has begun the climb back
to the .500 level.
"We're relieved to have bro
ken through last week and
we're very hopeful that we can
finish the season strong," said
head coach Bill Walsh. "UCLA's
a lot like us. They've had the
same kinds of problems we've
had this year — injuries and
malfunctions here and there."
Despite last week's victory, the
celebration did not last long
around the Cardinal practices.
Sophomore cornerback Eliel Swin
ton returned to his home in Los
Angeles to mourn with his family
after the tragic death of his girl
friend Jessica Williams last week-.

Walsh expects S win ton to return
with the team after the game, but
because S win ton is also still nurs
ing an injury, there is no timetable
as to when he will resume action.
"He's been through a real siege,
and we're hoping that he can pull
back out of it," Walsh said.
Sophomore free safety
Charles Young said that the team
is just trying to support Swinton
in any way possible.
"When Eliel returns from
L.A., we're going to do our best to
help him get through this,"
Young said. "He's a very strong
person and if anyone can pull
through this, I think he can."
The defense may also play
without freshman safety Kadar
Hamilton, who reaggravated a
wrist sprain last weekend against
Oregon State and remains ques
tionable for Saturday.
Another loss for the Cardinal
appears to be running back Mike
Mitchell. The sophomore, who
has been struggling with an ankle
sprain and ligament problem for
the past five weeks, has not made
the progress Walsh and the team
doctors expected and will most
likely not return this year.
"I expect that Mike's out for
the year," Walsh said. "He just
hasn't gotten better, it's that
simple. He showed improvement
for a few days then he just lost
the mobility that we thought he
had."

last Saturday's 35-29 victory.
The uncertainty surrounding
Mitchell's injury is similar to
UCLA's predicament with Ail-
American wide receiver J.J.
Stokes, who has missed most of
the last six weeks due to nagging
injuries. Unfortunately for the
Cardinal, the Bruins expect to
have the services of the 1994 Pac
-10 Offensive Player of the Year
back for tomorrow's contest.
Stokes caught 82 passes for
1,181 yards and 17 touchdowns
last year and was a leading Heis
man Trophy candidate going into
1994 before going down in the
first game of the season.
"That was a tremendous loss
to our football team," UCLA head
coach Terry Donahue said. "Even
now, J.J. Stokes is still really
rusty. This was his first full week
of practice since the pre-season."
Flanker Kevin Jordan has
stepped up for the Bruins, as he
leads the Pac-10 and ranks fourth

nationally in receiving yards per
game. After eight games, Jordan
has 55 catches for 869 yards.
However, Jordan's stellar year
has not completely overshadowed
Stokes' absence.
A dramatic drop-off from last
year is evident in quarterback
Wayne Cook's performance,
according to Donahue. Cook has
only thrown seven touchdowns
this year, compared with his 18
last year. "Wayne Cook became a
much different quarterback when
he lost J.J. Stokes," Donahue said.
However, no matter how many
weapons the Bruins appear to
have on offense, key losses on
defense have crippled last year's
Rose Bowl team. Currently, UCLA
is ranked last in rushing defense in
the conference, giving up over 230
yards per game.
Such dismal rushing numbers
must look promising to freshman
Anthony Bookman, who has jumped
into the starting lineup since
Mitchell's injury and blossomed into
what Walsh aills "the back of the
future at Stanford." Bookman has
rushed 32 times for 166 yards and

three touchdowns the past two
games and is only expected to
improve with experience.
Along with the improved
ground game (averaging 151
yards the past two games), Sten
strom and senior Justin Armour
have teamed up for two outstand
ing games. Armour has caught 15
passes for 292 yards and two
touchdowns in the last two weeks,
almost doubling his total yards
for the year.
"We're getting played on
defense pretty much the same
way each week," Armour said.
"We're getting familiar with that
now. The last four games' teams
have played the same type of dou
ble coverage and we're starting to
find holes in it."
The Cardinal defense has begun
to assert itself in places, too.
"The confidence is starting to
return," Young said. "It was a
much-needed win. We weren't
ever doubting ourselves, but just
to have a win under our belt — to
know what it felt like to win a
game — since we haven't won
one in so long, is a great feeling."

help him get through this,"
Young said. "He's a very strong
person and if anyone can pull
through this, I think he can."
The defense may also play
without freshman safety Kadar
Hamilton, who reaggravated a
wrist sprain last weekend against
Oregon State and remains ques
tionable for Saturday.
Another loss for the Cardinal
appears to be running back Mike
Mitchell. The sophomore, who
has been struggling with an ankle
sprain and ligament problem for
the past five weeks, has not made
the progress Walsh and the team
doctors expected and will most
likely not return this year.
"I expect that Mike's out for
the year," Walsh said. "He just
hasn't gotten better, it's that
simple. He showed improvement
for a few days then he just lost
the mobility that we thought he
had."

Given plenty of protection, senior quarterback Steve Stenstrom picks apart the OSU secondary during
last Saturday's 35-29 victory.
The uncertainty surrounding
Mitchell's injury is similar to
UCLA's predicament with Ail-
American wide receiver J.J.
Stokes, who has missed most of
the last six weeks due to nagging
injuries. Unfortunately for the
Cardinal, the Bruins expect to
have the services of the 1994 Pac
-10 Offensive Player of the Year
back for tomorrow's contest.
Stokes caught 82 passes for
1,181 yards and 17 touchdowns
last year and was a leading Heis
man Trophy candidate going into
1994 before going down in the
first game of the season.
"That was a tremendous loss
to our football team," UCLA head
coach Terry Donahue said. "Even
now, J.J. Stokes is still really
rusty. This was his first full week
of practice since the pre-season."
Flanker Kevin Jordan has
stepped up for the Bruins, as he
leads the Pac-10 and ranks fourth

nationally in receiving yards per
game. After eight games, Jordan
has 55 catches for 869 yards.
However, Jordan's stellar year
has not completely overshadowed
Stokes' absence.
A dramatic drop-off from last
year is evident in quarterback
Wayne Cook's performance,
according to Donahue. Cook has
only thrown seven touchdowns
this year, compared with his 18
last year. "Wayne Cook became a
much different quarterback when
he lost J.J. Stokes," Donahue said.
However, no matter how many
weapons the Bruins appear to
have on offense, key losses on
defense have crippled last year's
Rose Bowl team. Currently, UCLA
is ranked last in rushing defense in
the conference, giving up over 230
yards per game.
Such dismal rushing numbers
must look promising to freshman
Anthony Bookman, who has jumped
into the starting lineup since
Mitchell's injury and blossomed into
what Walsh aills "the back of the
future at Stanford." Bookman has
rushed 32 times for 166 yards and

three touchdowns the past two
games and is only expected to
improve with experience.
Along with the improved
ground game (averaging 151
yards the past two games), Sten
strom and senior Justin Armour
have teamed up for two outstand
ing games. Armour has caught 15
passes for 292 yards and two
touchdowns in the last two weeks,
almost doubling his total yards
for the year.
"We're getting played on
defense pretty much the same
way each week," Armour said.
"We're getting familiar with that
now. The last four games' teams
have played the same type of dou
ble coverage and we're starting to
find holes in it."
The Cardinal defense has begun
to assert itself in places, too.
"The confidence is starting to
return," Young said. "It was a
much-needed win. We weren't
ever doubting ourselves, but just
to have a win under our belt — to
know what it felt like to win a
game — since we haven't won
one in so long, is a great feeling."
My, how times have changed.
At the beginning of the sea
son, this Saturday's matchup
between Stanford and UCLA
promised to be a key game
between potential Rose Bowl
candidates. However, after both
teams' prolonged losing streaks,
neither the Cardinal (2-4-1, 1-3
in Pacific 10 Conference) nor the
Bruins (2-6, 0-5) look anything
like bowl-bound teams.
Unlike UCLA, who remains
mired in a six-game slide, Stan
ford's victory over Oregon State last
weekend has buoyed the team's
spirits. Now, with a consistent run
ning game and senior quarterback
Steve Stenstrom's ability to make
the sensational seem ordinary, the
Cardinal has begun the climb back
to the .500 level.
"We're relieved to have bro
ken through last week and
we're very hopeful that we can
finish the season strong," said
head coach Bill Walsh. "UCLA's
a lot like us. They've had the
same kinds of problems we've
had this year — injuries and
malfunctions here and there."
Despite last week's victory, the
celebration did not last long
around the Cardinal practices.
Sophomore cornerback Eliel Swin
ton returned to his home in Los
Angeles to mourn with his family
after the tragic death of his girl
friend Jessica Williams last week-.

Walsh expects S win ton to return
with the team after the game, but
because S win ton is also still nurs
ing an injury, there is no timetable
as to when he will resume action.
"He's been through a real siege,
and we're hoping that he can pull
back out of it," Walsh said.
Sophomore free safety
Charles Young said that the team
is just trying to support Swinton
in any way possible.
"When Eliel returns from
L.A., we're going to do our best to
help him get through this,"
Young said. "He's a very strong
person and if anyone can pull
through this, I think he can."
The defense may also play
without freshman safety Kadar
Hamilton, who reaggravated a
wrist sprain last weekend against
Oregon State and remains ques
