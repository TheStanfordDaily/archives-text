## Paramedic Bowl Cardinal, UCLA face off 
### Greg Collins Senior staff writer 
My, how times have changed.
At the beginning of the sea
son, this Saturday's matchup
between Stanford and UCLA
promised to be a key game
between potential Rose Bowl
candidates. However, after both
teams' prolonged losing streaks,
neither the Cardinal (2-4-1, 1-3
in Pacific 10 Conference) nor the
Bruins (2-6, 0-5) look anything
like bowl-bound teams.
Unlike UCLA, who remains
mired in a six-game slide, Stan
ford's victory over Oregon State last
weekend has buoyed the team's
spirits. Now, with a consistent run
ning game and senior quarterback
Steve Stenstrom's ability to make
the sensational seem ordinary, the
Cardinal has begun the climb back
to the .500 level.
"We're relieved to have bro
ken through last week and
we're very hopeful that we can
finish the season strong," said
head coach Bill Walsh. "UCLA's
a lot like us. They've had the
same kinds of problems we've
had this year — injuries and
malfunctions here and there."
Despite last week's victory, the
celebration did not last long
around the Cardinal practices.
Sophomore cornerback Eliel Swin
ton returned to his home in Los
Angeles to mourn with his family
after the tragic death of his girl
friend Jessica Williams last week-.

Walsh expects S win ton to return
with the team after the game, but
because S win ton is also still nurs
ing an injury, there is no timetable
as to when he will resume action.
"He's been through a real siege,
and we're hoping that he can pull
back out of it," Walsh said.
Sophomore free safety
Charles Young said that the team
is just trying to support Swinton
in any way possible.
"When Eliel returns from
L.A., we're going to do our best to
help him get through this,"
Young said. "He's a very strong
person and if anyone can pull
through this, I think he can."
The defense may also play
without freshman safety Kadar
Hamilton, who reaggravated a
wrist sprain last weekend against
Oregon State and remains ques
tionable for Saturday.
Another loss for the Cardinal
appears to be running back Mike
Mitchell. The sophomore, who
has been struggling with an ankle
sprain and ligament problem for
the past five weeks, has not made
the progress Walsh and the team
doctors expected and will most
likely not return this year.
"I expect that Mike's out for
the year," Walsh said. "He just
hasn't gotten better, it's that
simple. He showed improvement
for a few days then he just lost
the mobility that we thought he
had."
