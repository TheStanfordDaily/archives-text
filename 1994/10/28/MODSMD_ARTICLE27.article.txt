As mid-quarter approaches and exams are
abundant at Stanford, the Cardinal's men's
water polo team will hit the road for its tough
est test of the season.

The No. 1 Cardinal will clash once again
with No. 2 USC, this time under the lights
tonight in Los Angeles. On Saturday, the No.
5 UCLA Bruins will meet the defending
national champions in another top matchup.
The road trip provides a challenge for the
15-1 Stanford squad.

"Aside from the tournaments, this is our
toughest weekend of the year," said coach
Dante Dettamanti. "We're playing back-to
back games on the road against two top-five
opponents."
While the Cardinal must prepare for two
games, both USC and UCLA have only Stan
ford to get ready for. Nevertheless, Dettaman
ti is confident that his team can leave L.A.
with a pair of victories.
"We have had success on this trip before,"
he said. "At this point of the season, we are
now a solid No. 1. [USC and UCLA] are teams
which are fighting for position. Two wins
would entrench us in the No. 1 spot."
UCLA is in the precarious position of being
on the bubble as far as an NCAA tournament
bid is concerned. Only the top five teams from
California will earn an invitation to the
national championships.
The Trojans will certainly receive an invite
to the NCAA tournament, but will have to
overcome the Cardinal, which has beaten USC
six consecutive times dating back to the begin
ning of last season. Stanford defeated the Tro
jans in last year's NCAA title game.
"This year, we've blown [USC] out twice
and had one really close game," team captain
Wolf Wigo said. "They have a lot of firepower.
They may have just been unlucky so far
against us. On all accounts, we have to be up
for this game."
Junior Jeremy Laster will look to put a
damper on the Trojan's largest offensive
threat, holeman Hrvoje Cizmic.
"Hopefully, I will guard him as much as I
can, until I get two (out of a maximum three)

personal fouls," Laster said.
"He's the toughest guy out there
that I have to defend."
Whatever the outcome of
tonight's game, the Bruins will
be waiting in Westwood for the
Cardinal on Saturday.
UCLA will be without the
services of U.S. National Team
member Jim Toring, who suf
fered a broken ankle in a freak
accident.
"Their strength is that they
usually play us tough," Wigo said.
"Also, we will have played USC
the night before, which will make
us tired."
As for the Bruins playing with
out Toring, Wigo said, "Some
times when teams don't have

their star player, it helps them.
Everyone else has to make up for
the loss and they play better as a
team."
The match against UCLA
will carry extra importance
because it is the Cardinal's final
Mountain Pacific Sports Feder
ation game.
Stanford is currently in first
place in the MPSF with a
record of 6-1. The Cardinal and
Trojans have already played
their league match this season,
which the Cardinal prevailed,
18-10.
"Winning against UCLA
would clinch the best league
record, which would seed us first
at the league tournament," Det
tamanti said. "Our goals are to go
into both the league and NCAA
tournaments as No. 1. To accom
plish that, we need to keep win
ning."
