# Division championship on the line
## Men's soccer faces Cal 
### Joseph Hei Staff writer 
It's now or never.
The Stanford men's soccer
team (4-10-2) heads to Califor
nia (6-8-1) this weekend, know
ing that it must secure a crucial
win to hold onto any hope of
postseason play.
"The quality of our team will
be demonstrated Sunday," said
head coach Colin Lindores. "We
will see whether we are worthy
to stay in the race [for the
Mountain Division champi
onship]."
Stanford finds itself in this
position because its poor over
all record cannot secure a wild
card berth in the playoffs.
Therefore, its only hope is to
win the division outright. Stan
ford, Washington, and No. 4
Fresno State still remain in the
running for the conference title
since each team has lost only
once in league play.
"Cal is already out of the con
ference picture," said senior
forward/defender Ryan Estevez,
"so they're going to do their best
to spoil our chances."
Though not traditionally a
powerhouse in the division, the
Bears have made large gains in
the past two seasons due to its

talented underclassmen.
Freshman Jason Young leads
Cal this season in scoring with
seven goals.
The Bears, 4-2 in the confer
ence, have not rebuilt their
squad sufficiently to contend
for the championship this sea
son, however. One 2-0 confer
ence loss came at the hands of
the Air Force Academy on the
Falcons' home turf; Fresno
State dealt the other 1-0 loss.
Stanford, itself in a rebuild
ing stage, tied the Falcons 1-1
in Colorado Springs despite the
high altitude and challenging
conditions. Also, in one of the
biggest upsets of the season,
the Cardinal defeated Fresno 1-
0 last week. The Bulldogs are
clearly the strongest team in
the division and up until their
confrontation with Stanford,
held an unblemished confer
ence record.
The Cardinal fields a simi
larily young lineup, at times
featuring up to six freshman
starting. Serious injuries to
established starters have large
ly forced this situation. Howev
er, the young squad has filled in
admirably to secure a 4-1
record in the division. Standout
