The No. 1 Stanford women's
volleyball team continues its
whirlwind journey through the
Pacific 10 Conference with
matches this weekend against
Oregon and Oregon State at
Maples Pavilion. The undefeated
Cardinal (18-0, 10-0 in the Pac
-10) takes on the Ducks (6-14, 0-
11) tonight at 7:30 and battles
with the Beavers (12-9, 3-8) on
Saturday night at the same time.
"These are the types of match
es that worry me most," said
Stanford head coach Don Shaw.
"If you just look at their records,
you might think that they won't
cause problems, but they're
tough teams and if you're not
careful, they'll make trouble."
Shaw is confident that his
squad will be careful enough to deal
with the Oregon threat, however.
"This team knows what it has
to do," he said. "They don't look
too far ahead of themselves."
Freshman outside hitter Kris
ten Folkl is one member of the
Cardinal who definitely takes
every match as seriously as possi
ble.
"I firmly believe that you
can't look past any opponent,"
she said. "Any team can cause
damage. Being prepared never
hurts."
Oregon, for one, always comes
prepared.
"They're last in the confer
ence, but they battle every point,"
Shaw said. "They're not
pushovers."
Senior blocker Angee Hender
son leads the young Ducks with a
.243 average and 233 kills. Her
partner in the middle, Bettina
Roth has 69 blocks to head the
defense.
Despite their intensity, the
Ducks lost their last 13 matches
and only won three games over
this streak. One of these losses
came at Stanford's hands in
Eugene. The Cardinal took Ore
gon in three games, outhittingthe
Ducks .284 to .176.

Stanford also swept Oregon
State on that northern swing,
holding the Beavers to a .028
average.
Oregon State is only eighth in
the Pac-10, but has a 9-1 record
outside the conference. According
to Shaw, the Beavers have defi
nitely fallen victim to the overall
strength of the conference.
"They're having a tough time
with the conference schedule,"
Shaw said. "But they're just as
good as any non-conference team
we've played with the exception of
Florida."
Oregon State features a pair
of talented middle blockers in
senior Tanya Lifa and sopho
more Staci Hintze. Lifa is hitting
.306 with 162 kills and 107
blocks, while Hintze comes
through with a .343 average, 213
kills and 105 blocks. Senior out
side hitter Shelly Smith, OSU's
all-time kill leader, also presents
a threat.
The Beavers, more than most
teams, make use of a short serve
to throw an opposing offense off.
A short serve, which falls in

before the 10-foot line of the
court, can take a player out of a
play. She must move further to
receive the ball and her dig
becomes harder to control. Junior
outside hitter Marnie Triefen
bach explains.
"If you're a front-row attacker,
you have to pass the ball and that
slows you down when you set up
to hit it," she said. "Teams try to
use it (the short serve) to take
Kristen and I (Stanford's outside
hitters) out of a lot of plays."
Triefenbach believes that the
Cardinal is well prepared to deal
with this tactic.
"It's something we're aware of,
but it's not something we're wor
ried about," she said.
Stanford continues to lead the
Pac-10 in hitting percentage at
.304. The team also ranks first in
kill average (17 per game) and
assist average (15 per game).
Defensively, the team is no
slouch, either. Against the Cardi
nal, opponents hit a mere .161,
second lowest in the league, and
have the fewest kills per game
(12.78).
