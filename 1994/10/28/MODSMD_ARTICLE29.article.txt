The No. 1 Stanford women's
volleyball team continues its
whirlwind journey through the
Pacific 10 Conference with
matches this weekend against
Oregon and Oregon State at
Maples Pavilion. The undefeated
Cardinal (18-0, 10-0 in the Pac
-10) takes on the Ducks (6-14, 0-
11) tonight at 7:30 and battles
with the Beavers (12-9, 3-8) on
Saturday night at the same time.
"These are the types of match
es that worry me most," said
Stanford head coach Don Shaw.
"If you just look at their records,
you might think that they won't
cause problems, but they're
tough teams and if you're not
careful, they'll make trouble."
Shaw is confident that his
squad will be careful enough to deal
with the Oregon threat, however.
"This team knows what it has
to do," he said. "They don't look
too far ahead of themselves."
Freshman outside hitter Kris
ten Folkl is one member of the
Cardinal who definitely takes
every match as seriously as possi
ble.
