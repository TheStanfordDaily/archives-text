# Green ice cream and swimming pools
## Restricted gifts fund unusual campus perks 
### Anne Dubinsky 
Even with the rising inflation,
ice cream has never cost $1 mil
lion before.
At least not until 1955, when
Florence Moore gave $1 million to
Stanford to build a women's dor
mitory, now known as "Flo Mo."
There was, however, one stipula
tion attached to this money.
Every night, seven days a week,
ice cream must be served with din
ner.
Although most gifts-givers
provide money for scholarships,
new buildings, departmental re
search or more recently, funds to

repave the previously pothole
laden Palm Drive, some — like
Moore — have taken more origi
nal routes.
The Florence Moore legacy
lives on. Thirty-nine years after
she first donated the funds, ice
cream is still offered to hungry
students, said Jamila Shabazz,
residence office coordinator at Flo
Mo.
Students have mixed feelings
about the use of the money for ice
cream.
Junior Meera Heller, a two
year Flo Mo veteran, thinks that
the ice cream is a good idea,
"except when they have the dis
gusting green flavor."
But other students disagree,
saying that the money could be
spent in better ways, "like on
drinking fountains," said Cardenal
resident Garth Patil who said he
was unaware that the ice cream
was even available and wishes it
was more visible.
At Stanford, stipulations on
donations are not unusual.
In fact, a large anonymous
endowment is used solely for weed
ing and landscaping of the Oval.
The money ensures the red and
white flowers stay in bloom, the
grass remains cut and the paths
weed-free all year.
Some money is specifically given
for more private purposes. In 1949,
the University presidents's wife
Mary Curry Tresidder started a
fund to build a swimming pool at
the President's residence. And in
1954, former University President
John Ewart Wallace Sterling
donated money for the mainte
nance of the President's gardens.
Besides people who gave money
to keep the grass green and flowers
blooming, there are some donors
who considered education their
highest priority.
In 1948, Susan Nagengast, an
immigrant baker in the women's
dorms, left her entire life savings
of $2,177 to the University. She
stated in her will that her goal was
to "educate the youth of her adopt
ed country."
Jane Stanford, wife of Leland
Stanford and co-founder of the
University, also put education

first. In 1899, she ordered the
trustees of the University to sell
her large collection of diamonds,
rubies, emeralds, pearls and other
precious stones to the highest bid
der, which yielded about $150,000.
The money obtained is the
largest sum that the Stanford
Library collection has ever
received for the purchase of books.
The Jewel Fund, as it is called, pro
vided almost all the books for the
University until the 19405.
But even Jane Stanford placed
stipulations in the founding grant
of the University.
As strongly as she felt about
books, she had even stronger feel
ings about women. Since the Uni
versity was founded after her son
Leland, she believed "the number

of women attending the University
shall at no time ever exceed 500,"
which she wrote in an amendment
to the founding grant.
Sophomore Laura Chummers
said she sees this as an unfair
requirement for an institution
whose founding grant professes to
"afford equal facilities and give
equal advantages. . .to both the
sexes."
"It would be a sad day if dis
crimination went through just
because of the power of money,"
she said.
But in 1933, the Board of
Trustees increased the number, as
enrollment increased, to preserve
the original ratio intended by Jane
Stanford. The restriction was
repealed entirely in 1973.
