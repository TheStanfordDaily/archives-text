## Reagan and Tiger tee off in the picks of the week 
### 
Finding myself with a pretty
bad record after three weeks of
lousy predictions, I'm desperately
looking to improve my handicap.
This week I'm playing the course
with Stanford amateur golf sen
sation Tiger Woods, who has
mastered the fairways and greens
but has yet to take on the football
turf and forecast the games of the
week:
Stanford at UCLA
Vegas mocks me. Gamblers
across the country wait for my
predictions on Friday only to bet
their life's worth on the teams I
pick to lose.
I just can't seem to get it right

with Stanford. One week I pick
the team to slaughter Arizona
State and they blow it at the end.
Another week I pick the Cardinal
to lose against an improved Ore
gon State squad and Stanford
pieces together a quality game.
I've hit a new low, but this
weekend I'm sure the Cardinal
will win its second in a row.
UCLA is just pitiful. J.J. Stokes
may be back in the lineup, but
it'll take Superman (minus the
tights and cape) in gridiron gear
to turn the Bruins' awful season
around.
