## Reagan and Tiger tee off in the picks of the week 
### 
Finding myself with a pretty
bad record after three weeks of
lousy predictions, I'm desperately
looking to improve my handicap.
This week I'm playing the course
with Stanford amateur golf sen
sation Tiger Woods, who has
mastered the fairways and greens
but has yet to take on the football
turf and forecast the games of the
week:
Stanford at UCLA
Vegas mocks me. Gamblers
across the country wait for my
predictions on Friday only to bet
their life's worth on the teams I
pick to lose.
I just can't seem to get it right

with Stanford. One week I pick
the team to slaughter Arizona
State and they blow it at the end.
Another week I pick the Cardinal
to lose against an improved Ore
gon State squad and Stanford
pieces together a quality game.
I've hit a new low, but this
weekend I'm sure the Cardinal
will win its second in a row.
UCLA is just pitiful. J.J. Stokes
may be back in the lineup, but
it'll take Superman (minus the
tights and cape) in gridiron gear
to turn the Bruins' awful season
around.
Tiger wants Stanford to pull

this one off. "I hope Stanford will
win, but they're playing at UCLA so
I don't know,"he said. He's predict
ing the Cardinal, but he's a smart
guy. He knows it's going to be close.
"I'm trying to be borderline here.
I'm trying not to get in trouble."
No trouble for me. I'm betting
on the Cardinal — not because of
the intimidating hate messages I've
received from vindictive Stanford
players, but because the team final
ly looks in sync. Based on my previ
ously observed ability to prophe
size, however, I'd probably put my
own money on the other pick.
Tiger: Stanford by 2
Reagan: Stanford by 6
No. 22 Washington State at Cal

When I first read of USC's 61-0
skewering of Cal last weekend, I
thought the NCAA had adopted a
new rule establishing a logarith
mic scoring scale. Instead, I
learned that the Bears simply hit a
new all-time low in motivation
and ability. If this team were the
stock market it would have been
the worst crash in history. And
it'll take more than one week to
climb back up to it's pre-collapse
level.
"There's just no comparison
here," Tiger said. It certainly
doesn't take a lot of football
knowledge to know that some
thing's gone terribly wrong with
Cal's football program.
All this means good news for
Cardinal fans — the Axe might
make its long-awaited trip across
the Bay this year after all.
Tiger: WSU by 14
Reagan: WSU by 17

No. 11 Arizona at Oregon
I'm darn proud of this year's
Oregon squad. It's nice to be able
to freely admit that I'm an Orego
nian and not be ridiculed and
laughed at by the sports world.
"Arizona's got that great
defense," Tiger said. "And a pret
ty darn good offense, too." He's
calling a big Wildcat victory.
While I may have lost my distaste
for football in my home state, I haven't
lost my head. The Ducks' defeat of
Washington last week was impressive,
but the probation-plagued Huskies
had nothing to play for. Arizona is
pulling the Pac-10 and isn't going to be
derailed by an upstart Oregon squad.
Tiger: Arizona by 14
Reagan: Arizona by 7
No. 2 Colorado at No. 3
Nebraska
Everybody knows that Nebraska
is perennially over-ranked through

out the season. An undefeated Corn
husker squad always makes it to the
Orange Bowl to vie for the national
championship, only to be shucked
and cut-off-the-cob by the opponent
in front of millions on live television.
And don't worry, it'll happen
again. But they'll have to get to
the bowl first before they can be
trounced, and that means a vic
tory against the visiting Buf
faloes.
Tiger picked Nebraska to go all
the way at the beginning of the
season. "They're the number one
team in the country in my mind."
I'll stick with the fate theory.
Nothing can stand in the way of fate.
Tiger: Nebraska by 7
Reagan: Nebraska by 3
