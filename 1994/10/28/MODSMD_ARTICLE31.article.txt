# Women's soccer travels to Santa Barbara
## 
### Jeremy Stone Staff writer 
In California, one women's
soccer team reigns supreme.
Stanford has not lost in 18
straight contests to intra-state
rivals since falling to Santa Clara
in the 1992 Western Regional
Final. To continue the trend, the
No. 3 Cardinal will have to win on
the road as it faces UCLA (10-3-
2) and UC-Santa Barbara (5-7-3)
on back-to-back days this week
end.
After struggling offensively in
a 1-0 victory over the University
of San Francisco on Wednesday,
the Cardinal will meet two teams
who have also experienced their
shares of goal-scoring problems.
Saturday's opponent, the Bruins,
rank 17th out of 27 teams in the
West Region with 1.33 goals per
game, while the Gauchos have
staggered to only 1.07 gpg., 23rd
in the region.
The Bruins, however, have
compensated for their offensive
difficulties by keeping opponents
off the scoreboard. Freshman
Gretchen Overgaard of Danville
has supplanted Stanford's Jen
nifer Poehler as the second-best
goalkeeper in the West Region.
With 80 saves and eight shutouts
in 12 starts, her 0.429 goals
against average is fourth in the
nation.
"Defensively, they've done a
very good job throughout the
year, so we're going to have to
really try and break down their

defense," said Stanford head
coach lan Sawyers.
Shutting down the Bruin
offense essentially means con
taining one person — Traci
Arkenberg. The freshman has
tallied 11 goals on the year, two
more than all her Bruin team
mates combined. Nobody else has
managed more than two scores.
The UCLA contest also carries
significant implications for the
Pacific 10 Conference title.
Though the conference champion
is determined by a coaches' poll at
the end of the season rather than
by actual records, the Bruins
stand at 3-0 in Pac-10 play. Stan
ford won its only conference bat
tle to date, a 1-0 victory over Cal
ifornia on Sept. 25, and will play
two league games next weekend.
Although not concerned about
the relatively insignificant Pac-10
title, Sawyers stressed that all
games at this stage of the year are
critical.
"The conference doesn't really
get alive and kicking until next
year," Sawyers said, referring to
the implementation of a full con
ference schedule in 1995. "In
terms of conference play, it's not
as crucial, but obviously, every
game now becomes very impor
tant towards the end of the sea
son.
UCLA's program is in only its
second year at the varsity level,
but Sawyers said that the Bruins
are rapidly establishing them
selves.
