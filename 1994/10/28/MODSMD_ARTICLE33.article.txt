## Golfers to face greatest challenge of the year 
### Emery Chen Staff writer 
The toughest tournament of
the year to date is about to com
mence and the Stanford women's
golf team is ready.
After victories in the first two
competitions of the year by a com
bined total of 47 strokes, the sixth
ranked Cardinal travels to Fort
Ord in Monterey today to compete
in the San Jose State Invitational.
The tournament, hosted by
the Spartans, runs through Sun
day and features the top two
teams in the nation as well as
possibly the most difficult golf
course on the collegiate circuit.
The Bayonet Golf Course is rated
as a par 76.9 for women, the
highest that the Cardinal will
play on all year.
In addition, the toughest play
er that the Cardinal will face all
year will compete and attempt to
break the Stanford winning
streak.
Wendy Ward, last season's col
lege golfer of the year and winner of

this year's US Amateurs tourna
ment, joins top-ranked Arizona
State as it continues to defend the
national championship.
"The five starters on the team are all
legitimate first team Ail-Americans,"
said Cardinal coach Tim Baldwin. Sec
ond-ranked and host San Jose State
returns after a victory in Japan and
will attempt to avenge last season's
finish. At the NCAA championships
last year, the Spartans placed third,
31 strokes behind ASU.
Other top ranked teams that are
scheduled to appear include sev
enth-ranked Texas, eighth-ranked
Tulsa, ninth-ranked Fur man, 15th
ranked Tennessee, 16th-ranked
Indiana, and 20th-ranked Oregon.
"Everyone of those teams are
capable of winning the NCAA
Championships," Baldwin said.
As for the Cardinal, it will
start the same five that brought
the team success in its previous
two tournaments. That lineup
includes Amanda Baxter, a
sophomore pre-season Ail-
American. Baxter won the indi
vidual title at Stanford's first

tourney of the year and was also
a semifinalist in this year's US
Amateurs tournament.
The other individual tourna
ment victor, sophomore Mhairi
McKay, will help guide the Cardi
nal team. A first-team All-Amer
ican last year and preseason All-
American this season, McKay
fought off a double bogey on the
next to last hole during the previ
ous competition to birdie a diffi
cult par 5 to win by three
strokes.
Senior Jamille Jose, who fin
ished 32nd at the NCAA Champi
onships last year, will also start
for the Cardinal. Junior Vicky
Strada and senior Amy Lawrence
round out the final two spots.
Strada and Lawrence both fin
ished in the top seven in the previ
ous tournament.
"It's going to be a great tour
nament," Baldwin said. "We're
going to get our first look at the
very solid teams.
"The course is going to be
tough but I expect that team is
going to fare quite well."
