# Minority report worries Fac Sen
## Grad student recruiting concerns profs 
### Scott Van Winkle Senior staff writer 
Last year, Biology Prof. Pat
Jones attended a conference for
more than 800 outstanding minori
ty undergraduate students inter
ested in research — a kind of "trade
show" for national universities to
attract qualified graduate students.
Out of that group, the Universi
ty failed to attract a single student
to enroll in a Ph.D. program, as far
as Jones was aware. One student in
immunology remains on deferred
admission, she said, but he has told
her that the University is "just too
faraway."
Despite encouraging signs of
progress in the University's efforts to

recruit and retain
minority graduate
students, such per
sonal experience
and frustration
still informed
much of the Facul
ty Senate's re
sponse yesterday
to a study of the
issue.

The senate debate focused pri
marily on how the University can
continue to strengthen its affir
mative action efforts. A few sena
tors also took issue with the com
mittee's approach, which concen
trated on the subjective experiences


Jones
of current minority graduate stu
dents.
Assoc. Dean of Graduate Policy
George Dekker, who chaired the
committee, described the report as
"cautiously optimistic" in part
because it found that Stanford
ranks near the top of national uni
versities in granting doctoral
degrees to "targeted" minorities
— that is, African-American, Chi
cano / Latino and Native Ameri
can students.
Dekker presented statistics
showing that 6.3 percent of doc
toral degrees given by the Univer
sity during the 1980s went to
these minority students — not a
striking figure, but reflective of
Stanford's academic structure, he
said.
"Having a large school of edu
cation tends to make your target
ed minority doctoral student
recruitment and graduation fig
ures look good, while having a
large school of engineering tends
to make them look bad," he said,
"Even if, as at Stanford, your
school of engineering leads all oth
ers."
Dekker was also encouraged by
increased numbers of enrolled
minority graduates in each of the
last three years.
Since dipping by almost a third
to 6.1 percent in 1992, the per
centage of Stanford doctoral stu
dents who are targeted minorities
has climbed back to 9.8 percent
this year.
Dekker downplayed the impor
tance of the figures, saying he was
skeptical of the kind of "figure
conjuring" that often takes place

in discussions of this issue, and
emphasized that the figures were
not likely to change much soon.
Long-term preferences for spe
cific fields among many targeted
minority students — such as edu
cation and modern American liter
ature — are "stabilizing influ
ences that mean the performance
of a particular research universi
ty. . .isn't likely to undergo rapid
or massive upward or downward
shifts," he said.
Several senators said that such
preferences also stretch Universi
ty resources on the departmental
level, since a concentration of stu
dents in certain areas can require
a corresponding commitment of
faculty time and effort to those
areas.
Some called for a separate fel
lowship program to support
minority graduate students.
English Prof. Regenia Gagnier
emphasized the need to encourage
specialists in race and ethnicity —
particularly minorities — to sup
port minority students' interest in
such issues.
"We do not have enough minor
ity faculty" in those areas, she
said, adding that students who
perceive a dearth of faculty sup
port "very rapidly become alarmed
and disaffected" with the Univer
sity.
This contention sparked a
sharp response from Provost Con
doleezza Rice, the person most
responsible for assigning Univer
sity funds outside of individual
departments.
"I hope we've not gotten to the
point where minority students can
only work with minority faculty,"
she said, ssssss
Rice later explained her strong
feelings on the issue in the context
of a larger-scale debate. "It's a

moral issue for the country," she
said. University affirmative action
is "one of the most important ele
ments of bringing [minority stu
dents] into the mainstream of
American society."
Rice also outlined at the meet
ing her plan to build on the report
with a steering committee that
will meet throughout the year.
Along with representatives from
each of the University's seven
schools and the Office of Student
Affairs, the steering committee
will seek to enlist the ethnic cen
ters' help in encouraging under
graduates to pursue careers in
research.
Another direction that Dekker
said "sounded promising" is a
master's program aimed specifi
cally at targeted minorities to pre
pare them for research in quanti
tative fields.
Political Science Prof. Stephen
Krasner questioned the commit
tee's approach because it did not
investigate the achievement of
minority graduate students, even
though the statistics revealed a
higher admissions rate among
minorities.
These numbers should reflect a
difference between the qualifica
tions of minorities and other stu
dents, he said, but the committee
did not investigate that proposi
tion.
Dekker responded that while
he would have liked to study such
issues, he was "really not worried
about the quality of targeted grad
uate students we admit today."
Dean of the School of Humani
ties and Sciences John Shoven
also stressed the school's commit
ment to affirmative action,
announcing a full-time position
created this year to coordinate the
school's efforts.

Rice also outlined at the meet
ing her plan to build on the report
with a steering committee that
will meet throughout the year.
Along with representatives from
each of the University's seven
schools and the Office of Student
Affairs, the steering committee
will seek to enlist the ethnic cen
ters' help in encouraging under
graduates to pursue careers in
research.
Another direction that Dekker
said "sounded promising" is a
master's program aimed specifi
cally at targeted minorities to pre
pare them for research in quanti
tative fields.
Political Science Prof. Stephen
Krasner questioned the commit
tee's approach because it did not
investigate the achievement of
minority graduate students, even
though the statistics revealed a
higher admissions rate among
minorities.
These numbers should reflect a
difference between the qualifica
tions of minorities and other stu
dents, he said, but the committee
did not investigate that proposi
tion.
Dekker responded that while
he would have liked to study such
issues, he was "really not worried
about the quality of targeted grad
uate students we admit today."
Dean of the School of Humani
ties and Sciences John Shoven
also stressed the school's commit
ment to affirmative action,
announcing a full-time position
created this year to coordinate the
school's efforts.
Last year, Biology Prof. Pat
Jones attended a conference for
more than 800 outstanding minori
ty undergraduate students inter
ested in research — a kind of "trade
show" for national universities to
attract qualified graduate students.
Out of that group, the Universi
ty failed to attract a single student
to enroll in a Ph.D. program, as far
as Jones was aware. One student in
immunology remains on deferred
admission, she said, but he has told
her that the University is "just too
faraway."
Despite encouraging signs of
progress in the University's efforts to

recruit and retain
minority graduate
students, such per
sonal experience
and frustration
still informed
much of the Facul
ty Senate's re
sponse yesterday
to a study of the
issue.

The senate debate focused pri
marily on how the University can
continue to strengthen its affir
mative action efforts. A few sena
tors also took issue with the com
mittee's approach, which concen
trated on the subjective experiences

of current minority graduate stu
dents.
Assoc. Dean of Graduate Policy
George Dekker, who chaired the
committee, described the report as
"cautiously optimistic" in part
because it found that Stanford
ranks near the top of national uni
versities in granting doctoral
degrees to "targeted" minorities
— that is, African-American, Chi
cano / Latino and Native Ameri
can students.
Dekker presented statistics
showing that 6.3 percent of doc
toral degrees given by the Univer
sity during the 1980s went to
these minority students — not a
striking figure, but reflective of
Stanford's academic structure, he
said.
"Having a large school of edu
cation tends to make your target
ed minority doctoral student
recruitment and graduation fig
ures look good, while having a
large school of engineering tends
to make them look bad," he said,
"Even if, as at Stanford, your
school of engineering leads all oth
ers."
Dekker was also encouraged by
increased numbers of enrolled
minority graduates in each of the
last three years.
Since dipping by almost a third
to 6.1 percent in 1992, the per
centage of Stanford doctoral stu
dents who are targeted minorities
has climbed back to 9.8 percent
this year.
Dekker downplayed the impor
tance of the figures, saying he was
skeptical of the kind of "figure
conjuring" that often takes place

in discussions of this issue, and
emphasized that the figures were
not likely to change much soon.
Long-term preferences for spe
cific fields among many targeted
minority students — such as edu
cation and modern American liter
ature — are "stabilizing influ
ences that mean the performance
of a particular research universi
ty. . .isn't likely to undergo rapid
or massive upward or downward
shifts," he said.
Several senators said that such
preferences also stretch Universi
ty resources on the departmental
level, since a concentration of stu
dents in certain areas can require
a corresponding commitment of
faculty time and effort to those
areas.
Some called for a separate fel
lowship program to support
minority graduate students.
English Prof. Regenia Gagnier
emphasized the need to encourage
specialists in race and ethnicity —
particularly minorities — to sup
port minority students' interest in
such issues.
"We do not have enough minor
ity faculty" in those areas, she
said, adding that students who
perceive a dearth of faculty sup
port "very rapidly become alarmed
and disaffected" with the Univer
sity.
This contention sparked a
sharp response from Provost Con
doleezza Rice, the person most
responsible for assigning Univer
sity funds outside of individual
departments.
"I hope we've not gotten to the
point where minority students can
only work with minority faculty,"
she said, ssssss
Rice later explained her strong
feelings on the issue in the context
of a larger-scale debate. "It's a

moral issue for the country," she
said. University affirmative action
is "one of the most important ele
ments of bringing [minority stu
dents] into the mainstream of
American society."
Rice also outlined at the meet
ing her plan to build on the report
with a steering committee that
will meet throughout the year.

Affairs, the steering committee
