# Minority report worries Fac Sen
## Grad student recruiting concerns profs 
### Scott Van Winkle Senior staff writer 
Last year, Biology Prof. Pat
Jones attended a conference for
more than 800 outstanding minori
ty undergraduate students inter
ested in research â€” a kind of "trade
show" for national universities to
attract qualified graduate students.
Out of that group, the Universi
ty failed to attract a single student
to enroll in a Ph.D. program, as far
as Jones was aware. One student in
immunology remains on deferred
admission, she said, but he has told
her that the University is "just too
faraway."
Despite encouraging signs of
progress in the University's efforts to

recruit and retain
minority graduate
students, such per
sonal experience
and frustration
still informed
much of the Facul
ty Senate's re
sponse yesterday
to a study of the
issue.

The senate debate focused pri
marily on how the University can
continue to strengthen its affir
mative action efforts. A few sena
tors also took issue with the com
mittee's approach, which concen
trated on the subjective experiences
