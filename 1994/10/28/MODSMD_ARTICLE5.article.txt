# New endowment
## Donations to fund faculty in humanities 
### Beth Berselli Senior staff writer 
University President Gerhard
Casper announced at yesterday's
Faculty Senate meeting that
anonymous donors have given
Stanford $1 million to create a 10-
year term endowment to support
junior faculty in the humanities.
The donation — which estab
lishes the Dean's Fellows program
in the Humanities — will provide
selected junior faculty with a year
off to prepare scholarly work for
their tenure reviews, Casper said.
"This gift will support the Uni
versity's general commitment to
increase support for junior facul
ty," he said.
The donation comes in the

wake of last year's $25 million gift
from Stanford alumni William
Hewlett and David Packard,
which established the Terman
Fellows Program to support ju
nior faculty in the sciences.
This gift prompted the new
donors to begin discussions with
Stanford about supporting junior
faculty in the humanities, Casper
said.
Each Dean's Fellow will receive
a $5,000 grant for research, as well
as one-half year's salary and bene
fits from the award, Casper said.
This will be supplemented by out
side funding or sabbatical credit to
equal a year of paid leave.
Fellows can use the award as
thev please and will have a two-
year window in which to take their
leave.
John Shoven, dean of the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences, will be responsible for the

selection of up to three fellows
annually — announced by the end
of winter quarter each year.
Also at yesterday's senate meet
ing, Civil Engineering Prof. Boyd
Paulson presented the annual
report from the senate's Commit
tee on Academic Computing and
Information Systems (C-ACIS).
C-ACIS created two subcom

mittees last year to address future
networking and adminstrative
computing trends at the Universi
ty, said Paulson, chair of the com
mittee.
In addition, C-ACIS surveyed
about 2,000 students to assess the
extent to which they have ade
quate computing re-sources,
Paulson said. The survey revealed

that 67 percent of undergradu
ates and 71 percent of graduates
own personal computers.
Economics Prof. Roger Noll, a
senate member, said he was sur
prised that the committee's
report did not address the recent
privatization of Internet services.
As of Feb. 1, 1995, the National
Science Foundation will no longer

subsidize Internet usage fees for
long-distance electronic mail. It is
presently undetermined who will
pay for these usage costs.
"If they hit us with usage fees,
it could result in student charges,"
Noll said.
Assoc. Biochemistry Prof. Dou
glas Brutlag said the subcommit
tee on the Distributed Informa

tion and Computing Environ
ment plans to address this issue.
ASSU Senate Chair Nawwar
Kasrawi asked about the Universi
ty's level of commitment to provid
ing adequate computing services to
students.
"Students are priority one,"
Paulson said. "In fact, the commit
tee put students ahead of staff."
