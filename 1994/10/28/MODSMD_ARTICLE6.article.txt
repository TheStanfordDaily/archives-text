# Fee task force gathers input, plans action
## 
### Jo Marshall Staff writer 
In their final stages of information gather
ing, the ASSU special-fee task force has been
meeting with students this week for input
about the ailing fee system, which resulted in
19 special fee groups failing to get funding this
year.
The group — which was formed this quarter
in order to tackle long-term problems with the
system highlighted last year by the graduate
student refund revolt — held two forums this
week at Kimball Hall and Hacienda Commons
in Rains.

The meetings addressed how to achieve eq
uity between graduates and undergraduates,
ensure accountability of special-fee groups and
control the level of funding, as well as the over
arching question of whether fee refunds should
be kept.
"There hasn't been anything consistent
[coming out of the meetings] other than that
there should be some change," said graduate
student Karen Seta, chair of the committee.
She said she was, however, very interested
in one particular idea from graduate student
DuYican Stewart.
Stewart last night suggested a way to elimi
nate the need for student groups' "buffer

zones" — inflated fees that take anticipated fee
refunds into account — during the fee applica
tion process.
He suggested that the ASSU give groups
money before the fee refunds to allow them
more certainty in planning their budgets. The
refunds for which students apply would then be
subtracted from the group's budget for the fol
lowing year.
Currently, groups receive their money after
the fees are refunded — and must set their bud
gets under uncertain conditions.
At both meetings this week, there were con-
flicting views on whether to revive
the Fair Funding Amendment
which failed to pass in last year's
election.
The proposed alteration of the
ASSU Constitution would have
split special fee votes into gradu
ate end undergraduate divisions.
This would then allow each popu
lation to decide separately
whether to fund a group through
special fees.
This alteration, however,
brings problems along with it. "If
the Speakers Bureau gets
approved by only one [group], it
would create bitterness if we then
excluded half the campus [from
our events]," said Scott Moss,
head of the Speakers Bureau.
Increasing fee rates that
attempt to counteract the large
numbers of students requesting

fee refunds would just create a
vicious circle, Moss said.
"When the fees become high, it
becomes well known. It creates
some real spending money for peo
ple who get refunds," Moss said.
"There's a cycle where fees go up,
then refunds go up and so on."
"My view is that fee refunds
should probably be done away
with and the overall fee lowered,"
bemadded. — — -
Graduate students at the
meeting, however, said the Fair
Funding Ammendment is neces
sary for equity between graduates
and undergraduates.
"Voting habits of undergradu
ates and graduates are different,"
said graduate student Duncan
Stewart. "They live in totally dif
ferent worlds."
Council of Presidents member
Aniete Ekanem, who is a member
of the task force, suggested one
solution would be to restrict the
number of groups that could apply
for special fees.

Moss felt the main problem
was that the present special-fee
refund system provides incentives
for students to make money since
the fees are paid by their parents.
"If your University bill is paid
by someone else you're turning a
net profit," he said.
All the students at the forums
agreed that the ASSU Senate
must make a concerted effort to
make special foe group 9 account
able for their funds.
"You have to be flexible," Seta
said, "But if they say they're
going to have seven activities and
they only have two, then that's a
problem."
The task force has spent the
past three weeks looking at data
from previous years, analyzing the
effect of last year's graduate stu
dent revolt on fee refunds and
brainstorming basic philosophies.
The group must propose a con
stitutional amendment to the
existing system to the senate by
Nov. 22.

"Before we submit a constitu
tional amendment we want to get
input from the students to see what
is important to them," said Seta.
The group will spend the next
few weeks looking at the informa
tion gathered from the meeting.
"We as a group haven't sat down
and structured a new amendment
yet," Seta said.
"The goal of the task force is to
look at what is wrong with the
special fee system and come up
with a new one which will be good
to undergraduate and graduate
students," Seta said.
Last fall graduate students,
dissatisfied with paying fees they
felt mostly benefited undergradu
ates, formed the Graduate Stu
dent Tea Party to educate stu
dents about the refund process.
The group's formation resulted in
a sharp increase in refunds for
graduate students.

Graduate students at the
meeting, however, said the Fair
Funding Ammendment is neces
sary for equity between graduates
and undergraduates.
"Voting habits of undergradu
ates and graduates are different,"
said graduate student Duncan
Stewart. "They live in totally dif
ferent worlds."
Council of Presidents member
Aniete Ekanem, who is a member
of the task force, suggested one
solution would be to restrict the
number of groups that could apply
for special fees.

Moss felt the main problem
was that the present special-fee
refund system provides incentives
for students to make money since
the fees are paid by their parents.
"If your University bill is paid
by someone else you're turning a
net profit," he said.
All the students at the forums
agreed that the ASSU Senate
must make a concerted effort to
make special foe group 9 account
able for their funds.
"You have to be flexible," Seta
said, "But if they say they're
going to have seven activities and
they only have two, then that's a
problem."
The task force has spent the
past three weeks looking at data
from previous years, analyzing the
effect of last year's graduate stu
dent revolt on fee refunds and
brainstorming basic philosophies.
The group must propose a con
stitutional amendment to the
existing system to the senate by
Nov. 22.

"Before we submit a constitu
tional amendment we want to get
input from the students to see what
is important to them," said Seta.
The group will spend the next
few weeks looking at the informa
tion gathered from the meeting.
"We as a group haven't sat down
and structured a new amendment
yet," Seta said.
"The goal of the task force is to
look at what is wrong with the
special fee system and come up
with a new one which will be good
to undergraduate and graduate
students," Seta said.
Last fall graduate students,
dissatisfied with paying fees they
felt mostly benefited undergradu
ates, formed the Graduate Stu
dent Tea Party to educate stu
dents about the refund process.
The group's formation resulted in
a sharp increase in refunds for
graduate students.
