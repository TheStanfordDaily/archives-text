# Fee task force gathers input, plans action

In their final stages of information gather
ing, the ASSU special-fee task force has been
meeting with students this week for input
about the ailing fee system, which resulted in
19 special fee groups failing to get funding this
year.
The group — which was formed this quarter
in order to tackle long-term problems with the
system highlighted last year by the graduate
student refund revolt — held two forums this
week at Kimball Hall and Hacienda Commons
in Rains.

The meetings addressed how to achieve eq
uity between graduates and undergraduates,
ensure accountability of special-fee groups and
control the level of funding, as well as the over
arching question of whether fee refunds should
be kept.
"There hasn't been anything consistent
[coming out of the meetings] other than that
there should be some change," said graduate
student Karen Seta, chair of the committee.
She said she was, however, very interested
in one particular idea from graduate student
DuYican Stewart.
Stewart last night suggested a way to elimi
nate the need for student groups' "buffer

zones" — inflated fees that take anticipated fee
refunds into account — during the fee applica
tion process.
He suggested that the ASSU give groups
money before the fee refunds to allow them
more certainty in planning their budgets. The
refunds for which students apply would then be
subtracted from the group's budget for the fol
lowing year.
Currently, groups receive their money after
the fees are refunded — and must set their bud
gets under uncertain conditions.
At both meetings this week, there were con-
