# Students celebrate Israel-Jordan treaty
## 
### Rachel Kolman Marshak 
Students gathered together in
White Plaza yesterday in celebra
tion of the signing of the historic
peace treaty between Israel and
Jordan.
After sharing cake, partici
pants at the event signed congrat
ulatory letters to Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzchak Rabin and Jor
dan's King Hussein and observed
a moment of silence in memory of
the victims of the recent Tel Aviv
bus bombing and all other victims
of past Arab-Israeli conflicts.
"The celebration is a statement
of joy. We're celebrating the hap
piness of a new world order in the
Middle East," said Seth
Yoskowitz, a Hillel intern.
"We wanted to raise awareness
that peace is breaking out and
make sure that all Stanford stu
dents, faculty and staff have the
opportunity to share in the opti
mism of the moment," said Rabbi
Ari Cartun.
Organizers also wanted to
demonstrate their commitment
to the peace process, said Corinne
Medovoy, program director at
Hillel.

"Despite terrorism, the only
way to put an end to violence, the
only way for people to enrich their
lives, is through peace," she said.
"We want to encourage leaders on
the path they have chosen."
Students brimmed with hope
and excitement about the peace
accords while expressing sadness
about the continuing violence.
"This is one of the most excit
ing moments in my life," said ju
nior Alex Schafran. "It's a sign of
many things to come. . .. This is a
sign to people around the world
that things that once looked hope
less can work out."
Senior David Cohen said he had
"a really warm feeling inside that
our brothers and sisters in the
Middle East are finally getting
down to getting along."
For Israeli students, the feel
ings were more personal.
"I have a lot of friends in the Is
raeli army and I worry about
them," said freshman Shirley
Geldfeld.
Senior Shelley Shick, who de
livered a speech at the celebration,
expressed relief at the peace nego

tiations. "I'm tired of living in the
shadow of war," she said.
Amid the celebration, though,
some students were still doubtful
about the prospects for peace.
Sophomore Larry Flechner said
he was both "wary and optimistic."
His enthusiasm was tempered by

the recent violence in Israel and
the hostility toward peace which
still remains.
Most students felt that despite
continuing problems, a strong
commitment to the peace process
had to be maintained.
"The leaders are forging
ahead," said Aaron Lehman, presi
dent of the Jewish Student Associ
ation. "We can't let a small minori
ty stop everything," he said.
Schick said she believes that eel

ebrations around the world similar
to the one here yesterday send a
message of peace to opponents of
the accord.
"The minority groups who do
what they can to ruin the process
have to know that enough of us will
not give up and that our commit
ment to peace is unequivocal,"
Schick said. "It's time for peace to
get the headlines, not war," she said.
Students also expressed opti
mism about an even more promis

ing future.
Sophomore David Herrera said
he hopes the signing of the peace
accords between Israel and Jordan
"will bring about the end of hostil
ity between Israel and all Arab
nations."
"I'm filled with hope," said
sophomore Meredith Heller. "I
envision peace [for Israel] with
other surrounding countries. This
is an important first step," she
added.
