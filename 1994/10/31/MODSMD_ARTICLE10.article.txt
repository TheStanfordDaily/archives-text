## Program lets doctors telecommunicate patients' problems 
### Tristan Sorah Reyes 
In order to receive expert medical advice from
Stanford researchers, patients usually have to
come here to Stanford.
But this will soon change, as Stanford Health
Services prepares to launch a new telemedicine
program that will allow patients at three sur
rounding community health centers to communi
cate with Stanford physicians without even leaving
the doctor's office.
"It provides for a new level of functionality —
it's great," said Dr. Blackford Middleton, medical
director of SHS's Information Management and
Technology. "It is like being on the telephone but
face to face."
The pilot program will be implemented in Jan
uary 1995 by Stanford Health Services and the Bay
Area Community Health Educational Network
(BACHEN). It will link Stanford to three commu
nity sites: Drew Health Foundation in East Palo
Alto, Lytton Gardens Health Care Center in Palo
Alto and San Jose Medical Group, Middleton said.
Telemedicine is a communications technique
that has remotely connected physicians to their
patients for about 25 years.
Today, typically, a doctor calls a specialist about
a patient's problem and then the patient goes to
see the specialist at a later time. But with today's
technology, that same patient could be diagnosed
and treated by a specialist — through monitors
and other networking devices — without having to
leave the referring physician's office.
Stanford's pilot telemedicine program will be
the first multi-disciplinary project of its kind any-

where. Similar programs are all focused on certain
areas.
"The whole point of the new program will be to
distribute academic medical center expertise where
it is needed," Middleton said.
He added that he feels the program will have a
positive impact on the surrounding community,
improving health care delivery and making medical
expertise more easily accessible.
"The program will allow for poorer patients and
the elderly in urban areas to receive specialized
medical care from Stanford Health Services with
out even having to leave their own clinics," Mid
dleton said.
These patients are often unable to receive the
specialized medical care they need because of
transportation limitations, he said.
"The main issue is to improve the quality of care
and reduce costs, and to provide better and earlier
diagnosis," Middleton added.
The pilot program will utilize a multi-media
database that will allow Stanford to receive and
transmit medical data or images and interact via a
two-way video link with the three medical clinics.
The procrram is being funded by the California
Research and Education Network(CalßEN), a San
Ramon-based trust created by Pacific Bell to
encourage use of the information superhighway.
CaIREN will fund the communication costs of the
telemedicine pilot program for up to two years, at
an estimated $100,000.
"My vision is to have this pilot program expand
into a model for network-based care," said Middle
ton, who has imagined a program like this for sev
eral years.
