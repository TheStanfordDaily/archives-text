## White House shooting suspect to be arraigned 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Fol
lowing his frightening White
House shooting spree, a Colorado
man who left a cryptic note about
death faces arraignment today on
property damage and firearms
violations. The possibility of
additional charges, including
attempted assassination, was left
open.
Yesterday, the day after the
unsettling attack, yellow police
tape stretched across the White
House lawn and FBI agents
armed with laser equipment con
ducted an inch-by-inch search for
bullets around the pockmarked
mansion.
The gunman, 26-year-old Fran
cisco Martin Duran, remained
silent at D.C.'s central cellblock,
his motives a mystery, his
demeanor described by the Secret
Service as "completely flat."
Duran, who spent 2 1/2 years
in a military prison for felony

assault, left a note outlining how
he would want his affairs handled
if he died, a document that one
administration official called "clos
er to a will than a suicide note."
The note contained no threat
against Clinton, the official said.
Duran, scheduled to be for
mally arraigned before a U.S.
Magistrate on Monday, was
charged yesterday with willfully
damaging federal property and
possessing a firearm as a con
victed felon. The first charge
carries a maximum penalty of
10 years imprisonment and a
$10,000 fine, the latter 10 years
and $5,000.
The Secret Service held out the
possibility that additional charges
could be filed.
"I would not eliminate assassi
nation statutes," said Special
Agent Carl Meyer. Authorities
searched Duran's home and car to
try to determine his intent.
