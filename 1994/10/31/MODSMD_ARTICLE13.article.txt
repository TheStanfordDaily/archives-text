Huffington scandal
SANTA BARBARA, Calif.
(AP) — Former employees of
GOP Senate candidate
Michael Huffington claim he
had more than one illegal
immigrant working for him,
the Santa Barbara News-Press
reported Saturday.
Employees and family friends
quoted in the newspaper disput
ed Huffmgton's claim that he
had hired only one illegal immi
grant, a Guatemalan nanny to
help take care of his two chil
dren.
Huffington said Thursday
that Marisela Garcia was hired
in 1989 and stopped working
for him in July 1993, six
months after Huffington was

elected to Congress. But the
newspaper reported that Gar
cia was working for the Huffin
gton family as recently as five
months ago.
A former bookkeeper for the
Huffingtons told the News-
Press that she paid the nanny's
undocumented husband, Fer
min Garcia, for gardening and
other work performed on the
estate between April and
August 1990.
Another illegal immigrant
told the newspaper she was
paid $8 an hour to care for
the Huffington's youngest
daughter for several days in
1992.
Kevin de Leon, director of
One-Stop Immigration in
Santa Barbara, said he saw

the woman's paycheck.
Bosnian offensive
SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herze
govina (AP) — Bosnian Serbs
evacuated civilians from a north
western town and fought yester
day to hold ofT Muslim-led gov
ernment troops who are on their
most successful offensive of the
war.
For a second straight day,
government forces captured
Serb positions in the mountains
near Sarajevo.
In Saturday's combat, gov
ernment artillery fire landed
near a U.N. observer post,
prompting warnings of a
NATO airstrike if it happened
again.

Civil defense officials went
door-to-door in the besieged
Bosnian capital, advising resi
dents to stay indoors because of
fears that Serbs — after a nine
month lull — would renew bom
bardment of the city in retaliation.
Hospital officials said one
civilian was killed and about 10
wounded late yesterday by
shelling in the government-held
Sarajevo suburb of Hrasnica,
which also had been hit Satur
day.
The attacks by Muslim-led
government forces in northwest
Bosnia and the Sarajevo area
reflected a sudden change in the
nature of the war, with the gov
ernment gaining ground and the
better-armed Serbs on the
defensive.
