# U.S. pushes Israeli-Arab economic ties
## 
### 
CASABLANCA, Morocco (AP)
— The United States unveiled a
four-point program yesterday to
draw Israel and its Arab adver
saries into a system of regional
economic cooperation.
The plan could lift the area from
poverty, duplicate economic "mira
cles" in Eastern Europe, Asia and
Latin America and reinforce the
spreading Arab-Israeli peace pro
cess, Secretary of State Warren
Christopher at a first-ever Middle
East-North Africa Summit meeting.
"Progress toward Arab-Israeli
peace has opened the door to eco
nomic cooperation in support of
peace," Christopher said. "Now,
together, we must take a bold step
through that door."
Christopher joined more than
2,100 political and business lead
ers from 60 countries at the open
ing of the three-day conference.
The unprecedented assembly was
to discuss ways to develop the
region's economic market with its
300 million consumers.
"Peace is in our hands," the
summit's host, Morocco's King
Hassan 11, said in his opening
speech. "Our conference is pre
cisely aimed at consolidating it
and giving it the means to make it
more durable."
Israel Foreign Minister Shimon
Peres said the Middle East and
North Africa should form a Moroc
can-based common market modeled
after Europe's powerful trading bloc.
The summit marks the first
time Israeli and Arab officials and
investors meet to formulate spe
cific investment and cooperation
projects. The Israeli delegation
said it is bringing 150 business
proposals from the private sector,
totaling $25 billion.
The summit was also seen as
another major step toward ending
the 43-year Arab boycott of Israel.
Christopher urged Arab leaders to
follow the lead of Saudi Arabia and
five smaller Persian Gulf countries
who already have eased the boycott.

"Indeed," he said, "it is time
for the Arab League to dismantle
the boycott entirely."
"If I may borrow the famous
Humphrey Bogart line, this con
ference could be the beginning of a
beautiful friendship," he said, tak
ing his cue from the classic World
War II movie, "Casablanca."
En route from Saudi Arabia,
Christopher told reporters the
United States, Germany, Japan
and other outside powers and
their corporate heads must be
convinced of the potential for
cooperation and profit.
"At rock bottom, it is only the
private sector that can make the
investments to improve the quali
ty of life," he said.
The four main points of the
U.S. proposal would:
—Facilitate the movement of
goods, labor and ideas across the
borders of the Middle East and
North Africa.
—Set up a committee of experts
to structure a regional bank for
economic cooperation and develop
ment. It should be available for
both the public and private sectors.
—Establish a tourism board so
people can go freely from one
country to another. Millions of
people will sign up for package
tours, he said.
—Establish a regional busi
ness council or chamber of com
merce to promote trade and com
mercial opportunities.
Only three of the Arab partici
pants — Egypt, Jordan and the
Palestine Liberation Organization
— have formally recognized Israel.
Four others — Morocco, Tunisia,
Oman and Bahrain — are on the
brink of establishing low-level ties.
Syria and Lebanon are boy
cotting the conference. Their
negotiations with Israel have
failed to produce an accord, but
Christopher is due to return to
the area in about a month. Iraq,
Iran and Libya also refused to
take part.
