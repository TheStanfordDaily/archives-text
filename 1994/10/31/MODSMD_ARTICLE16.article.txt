Vote against Prop. 186
and help avert disaster
for state health system

CALIFORNIA, LIKE MOST of
the United States, is facing a
health-care crisis, and advo
cates for reform are growing dis
couraged in the wake of the failure
of a national health-care bill.
On Nov. 8, Californians will vote
on a state health reform proposal,
Proposition 186. Though its
promises may seem both numerous

and grandiose, 186 is a
recipe for a state health-care
disaster that voters would
be wise to reject.
The embattled Clinton
plan would institute a
"managed competition"
scheme under which insur-

ance companies would vie to offer
the most attractive government
defined benefits package. Proposi
tion 186 would go farther, institut
ing a so-called "single-payer"
health-care system whereby a single
government-run system would
replace private health insurance.
The proposed health-care pro
gram would change the state consti
tution and public law to offer Cali
fornia residents a benefits package
covering medical care and prescrip
tion drugs, including long-term,
mental health, dental and emergen
cy treatment.
The program would be funded by
a $l-per-pack cigarette tax and by
new income and payroll taxes. The
state legislative analyst has estimat
ed that those taxes would raise
about $75 billion annually and has
predicted costs for the program
could be either higher or lower than
revenues.
Other studies have concluded
that the program will operate on a
budget of about $100 billion. Not
surprisingly, supporters of the mea
sure claim the program will gener
ate a multibillion-dollar budget sur
plus and save businesses money,
while opponents predict huge

deficits and a net negative effect on
business.
No matter which way forecasters
wave their hands, $100 billion is
still quite a bit of money to pass on
to the state, especially considering
the state bureaucracy's pathetic
track record with education and
welfare programs. By comparison,
the current total state budget is
about $58 billion.
Even worse, that $100 billion
budget would largely fall under the
control of a single state health com
missioner who would wield a fright
ening degree of power over the state
health system, relatively free from

u J —J — —
the checks and balances
that constrain other govern
ment officials. For instance,
the proposal grants the
commissioner "any and all
powers necessary and prop
er" to implement the health
system, and explicitly grants

him or her complete power over
rates and fees.
Another disturbing aspect of 186
is that the nature and extent of
health coverage would be subject to
the whims of the electorate, as the
office of health commissioner would
be up for re-election every four
years. During tough economic
times, candidates could offer to
lower taxes by rationing services or
stripping down the benefits package
to the bare legal minimum.
Opponents of the plan have also
identified glaring holes in the pro
posed coverage plan. For instance,
room and board costs for nursing
home patients are explicitly exclud
ed from long-term care benefits.
Also, students attending out-of
state schools would become ineligi
ble for coverage.
Considering the dire impact any
health reform would have on the
state economy — not to mention
the millions of Californians who
would be affected — health reform
is best left to a comprehensive and
cooperative effort in the state
assembly, not a one-time yes-or-no
ballot measure. Especially an
expensive, poorly drafted big-gov
ernment proposal like 186.
