## Animal, mineral, vegetable

I WAS ENJOYING my dinner at a
restaurant in Singapore when I heard
a strident voice from the next table. It
was The American Businessman in Asia,
who had surrounded himself with busi
ness partners and a number of giggling
hostesses whose purpose at the table was
clearly not to discuss stamping machines.
Happily chomping down on his New York
steak, The American Businessman pro
claimed:
"You know, vegetarians take beans
and vegetables and make them look like
steak or fish or turkey. Who are they try
ing to fool, anyway? (Giggles.) Why don't
they get a life and eat real food? (More
giggles.) Someone should tell them that
vegetables are alive, too! (Whole ensem
ble of giggles, mixed in with hearty guf
faws.)"
Obviously not particularly intent on
discussing the merits of his statement,
the dinner party cheerfully resumed
devouring its prey.
I quietly munched on my braised tofu
and garden greens, wondering if I should
get a life, too. Or whether vegetables
should get a life.
The thought of the demise of a veg
etable is rather tragically amusing: The
cave-dwellers assemble behind a shield
ing outcrop, brandishing their spears,
stealthily edging toward the neighboring
clan's garden patch. Finally gathering
their courage, they launch an all-out
attack, uprooting everything in sight:

"Die, you dirty carrot, die!" they
scream, puncturing the orange victim's
skin with multiple spear thrusts.
If this scenario fails to evoke your
sympathy for the poor herbaceous speci
men, you probably share my difficulties
in fathoming the moment of death for a
carrot. Certainly, contrasted with the
grinding sounds of butchering machines
intermingled with screams that signal
the passing of a cow, the bullet between
the rabbit's eyes, or the decapitation of a
chicken, the extermination of a carrot
seems rather tame.
Even a fish is in worse shape. Minding
its own business, it sees a juicy tidbit of
worm, snaps away, and unwittingly finds
itself yanked out of the water and teth
ered to the side of a boat, where its brains
are beaten out on the hull before its belly
is slit open and its guts are spilled on the
beach.
Those who sympathise with the worm
and not the fish, figuring the latter got its
just desert, may be reminded of James
Earl Jones, who, upon being questioned
by Simba, explains that while lions do in
fact eat zebras, lions later die themselves,
providing the fertilizer for the plants
which the zebras eat, and so on. Thus,
the cycle of nature is guaranteed, the
authority of the food chain is upheld and
the zebras are out of luck.
While this elegant solution to the con
science dilemma may hold true for lions
and fish, who don't really have a choice in

the matter and would likely starve on a
diet of tofu and sprouts, humans opted
out of the aforementioned cycle long ago.
Besides being both physiologically and
morally capable of renouncing carnivo
rous inclinations, we're notorious for
taking more out of the planet's give-and
take than we give. Reducing our impact
on a cycle we're no longer a paying mem
ber of by saving the cow and embracing
the carrot is not that terrible a thing.
Besides, a life of vegetarianism doesn't
mean eternal confinement to wheat germ.
There's a whole world of non-dead cuisine
out there waiting to be discovered. Pro
gressing beyond the übiquitous pasta and
cheese quesadilla, drop by Fresh Choice
sometime or an Indian vegetarian restau
rant. If you don't want to stop there,
there's always Singapore — the silver
medal winner of an international cuisine
competition held in the city of lions this
year was a sumptuous vegetarian sym
phony orchestrated by a Swiss chef.
So, The American Businessman in
Asia is missing out. As the years pass by,
the gigglers leave, his cholesterol level
rises and his girth inflates, maybe he'll
consider getting a life, possibly saving a
couple more in the process.

Jonathan Huston wonders where the
Jolly Green Giant fits into the Circle of
Life.
