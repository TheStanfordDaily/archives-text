Prop. 187 isn't just insensible; it violates human rights

IN HIS LETTER last Friday, Sean
Hecker, representing several law stu
dents, debunked yet again the spuri
ous empirical arguments in favor of
Proposition 187 that have been
advanced by such paragons of virtue as
Alan Nelson, a formerly incompetent
director of the INS and now proud archi
tect of Proposition 187, and Michael
HufTfington, who himself violated immi
gration laws and then lied about it.
But Hecker is much too timid in pre
senting merely an empirical, as-applied,
practical argument against Proposition
187. The millenarian "Save Our State"
initiative is invalid on its face according
to civilized standards of constitutional
and natural law.

Illegal aliens are not, as some would
argue, entitled a right to health, educa
tion, and welfare; in this they are just
like citizens, because we do not reside in
a socialist state. They are also properly
denied the right to vote, which requires
a certain level of commitment and alle
giance that is not presumed to be inher
ent in any alien, legal or no. (Though the
fact that most de facto permanent-resi
dent illegal aliens would welcome any
opportunity to demonstrate such com
mitment and such allegiance is a salient
point.)
But the 1.6 million illegal immigrants
and their half-million citizen children,
which include several Stanford students,
who are under the jurisdiction of this

republic and who are employed by law
breaking citizens like Michael Huffing
ton in such numbers as to negate the
charge that "they just don't belong
here," have and of right ought to have
the inalienable human rights to life, lib
erty, property, the pursuit of happiness,
equal protection under the laws of one's
de facto jurisdiction, and due process.
The just powers of government are
derived not from the consent of the citi
zens, which is a tautological invitation to
tyranny (of either an unjust prince or of
the majority), but from the consent of
the governed. A few provisions of Propo
sition 187 may be legal, barely, but they
are far from just.
The near-universal opposition of the

Stanford community, which cannot be
dismissed as "political correctness" by
such prominent PC critics as the Wall
Street Journal and William Bennett,
who by the way are on record against
Proposition 187, is not sufficient. You
must argue and vote, because otherwise,
the slim majority of the California with a
different conception of or an ignorance
of human rights will define the character
of the people of this state.
The Stanford Theatre is now showing
"Casablanca." Go, and think about the
classic line, "Round up the usual sus
pects."
