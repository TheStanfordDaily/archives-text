# Grade policy looms over some
## Many students, advisors looking at classes and retakes differently 
### Jamie Taylor Staff writer 
During last year's controversial de
bate over the new grading policy, oppo
nents vehemently argued that the pro
posed requirements would force stu
dents to pick classes differently.
Although the entire grading policy
will not go into effect until next year, the
retake policy — which applies to all
courses taken this year or later — does
appear to be having mixed effects on stu
dents' academic decisions as they final
ize their classes and begin to hit
midterms this quarter.
Under the previous policy students
were allowed to retake classes without
consequence. The new policy notes the
retake, bringing Stanford into more uni
formity with other campuses around the
country.

Some students said they believe the
change in the retake policy will have a
significant influence on the way they
think about academics, adding that it
has even affected the courses they have
chosen this year.
But others doubt the policy's influ
ence on their plans, and even said the
new retake requirements will eradicate
abuses of the system which the old policy
allowed.
No matter how the retake policy in
fluences their course decisions, however,
most students agree that the policy
change is a positive step for Stanford — a
radical shift from the uproar raised last
year when the policy was just a proposal.
Conservative choices
Many students said the new policy is
affecting their class choices by making
them focus more on the grades they an

ticipate receiving.
"It makes a difference about whether
you take a harder class or take an easier
one to make sure you get a good grade in
it," said freshman Sophy Woodhouse. "If
you're willing to invest the time to retake
a class, that kind of justifies retaking it."
Woodhouse added that being able to
retake a class without consequence
would give her more confidence to take
more difficult courses.
Freshman Mary Colvig said the policy
makes her feel less confident about tak
ing challenging courses.
"I hadn't thought about it before, but
I do now that I'm in a really difficult
class," she said. "I don't want to drop it,
so I guess I am going to just accept the
grade instead of retaking it."
For sophomore Rachel Nelson, the
