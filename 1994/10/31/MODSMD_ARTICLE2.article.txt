# Grade policy looms over some
## Many students, advisors looking at classes and retakes differently 
### Jamie Taylor Staff writer 
During last year's controversial de
bate over the new grading policy, oppo
nents vehemently argued that the pro
posed requirements would force stu
dents to pick classes differently.
Although the entire grading policy
will not go into effect until next year, the
retake policy — which applies to all
courses taken this year or later — does
appear to be having mixed effects on stu
dents' academic decisions as they final
ize their classes and begin to hit
midterms this quarter.
Under the previous policy students
were allowed to retake classes without
consequence. The new policy notes the
retake, bringing Stanford into more uni
formity with other campuses around the
country.

Some students said they believe the
change in the retake policy will have a
significant influence on the way they
think about academics, adding that it
has even affected the courses they have
chosen this year.
But others doubt the policy's influ
ence on their plans, and even said the
new retake requirements will eradicate
abuses of the system which the old policy
allowed.
No matter how the retake policy in
fluences their course decisions, however,
most students agree that the policy
change is a positive step for Stanford — a
radical shift from the uproar raised last
year when the policy was just a proposal.
Conservative choices
Many students said the new policy is
affecting their class choices by making
them focus more on the grades they an

ticipate receiving.
"It makes a difference about whether
you take a harder class or take an easier
one to make sure you get a good grade in
it," said freshman Sophy Woodhouse. "If
you're willing to invest the time to retake
a class, that kind of justifies retaking it."
Woodhouse added that being able to
retake a class without consequence
would give her more confidence to take
more difficult courses.
Freshman Mary Colvig said the policy
makes her feel less confident about tak
ing challenging courses.
"I hadn't thought about it before, but
I do now that I'm in a really difficult
class," she said. "I don't want to drop it,
so I guess I am going to just accept the
grade instead of retaking it."
For sophomore Rachel Nelson, the
policy is a hindrance to her sense
of academic adventure, making
her more careful to choose classes
she is sure she wants and needs to
take.
Nelson believes the previous
retake guidelines provided stu
dents with more freedom to
explore classes about which they
were uncertain, she said.
"I think that the administra
tion should trust that students
will be responsible in their
academia," Nelson said, adding
that she doubts that students
retake classes without thinking
about them first.
Because of the influence the
new policy exerts on some stu
dents' course choices, it has
altered the advising process, mak
ing academic advisers give their
advisees more cautious advice.
The policy "pushes me to
advise people to place themselves
more conservatively, because they
don't have the flexibility of retak
ing a class anymore," said junior
Mike Eubanks, an advising asso
ciate in Alondra.
Eubanks added that the fresh
men he advises seem to agree with
his suggestion of conservative
placement. But because they
haven't had an opportunity to
retake any classes, he said, "I
think the retake policy will
become more of an issue at the
end of the year for them."
There has been a slight
increase in students coming in to

seek guidance about their cours
es, said Hector Cuevas, director of
the Undergraduate Advising Cen
ter. He added, however, that
"most students are probably com
ing in for clarification on the poli

Senior Anita Seto, head advis
ing associate in Alondra, said the
retaking policy hasn't affected
many freshmen because they
have not been confronted with
grades yet.

"Some of the freshmen who are
feeling overwhelmed . .. are con
sidering dropping the class.
Retaking doesn't seem to be an
option anymore," she added.
Some faculty advisers said they
believe their advising has changed
in light of the new policy.
Freshman adviser John Har
vey, a senior research engineer at
the Center for International
Security and Arms Control, said
he has always cautioned freshmen
to place themselves conservative
ly, especially during fall quarter.
"Now, with the new change," he
said, "I am alerting them to keep
the policy in mind in their overall
decisions.
"Frosh tend to accept that the

policy has changed, and they
probably won't raise holy hell
about it," Harvey added. "I think
that for upperclassmen, this is a
privilege being removed. It's
another thing for them to consid
er."
Above the influence
But other students said they
believe the policy change will have
little influence over their aca
demics plan.
"I am absolutely not doing any
thing differently, and I'm not
going to do anything differently,"
said sophomore Eric Cheng.
Cheng, an AA, added that he
doubts the new policy affects the
way he advises freshmen.
"I certainly make sure that
they're aware of the policy, but
right now they're not really con
cerned," agreed sophomore Raj
Raghavan, another AA. "They
aren't placing themselves more
conservatively."
Senior Fred Che, head AA in
Otero, said he does not believe the
new policy should affect the way
one advises. "It's not good to
advise people with the intent of
having them retake a class," he
said.
"You should make them aware
of the policy, but then leave it to
them to just take the classes that
they need to take," Che added.
"People shouldn't think in terms
of failure."
Many faculty members agree
that the policy change has not
influenced their advising methods
or suggestions. "The change
doesn't affect the way I advise at
all," said freshman adviser Scott

Stocker, an administrative assis
tant in the Overseas Studies Pro
gram. "I always look to see if they
can handle the courseload, and if
they can handle it, they shouldn't
have to retake a course."
Although Stanford's decision
to change its academic policies
made national headlines last year,
the effects of the changes have
remained localized to campus,
said Assoc. Dean of Undergradu
ate Admissions Bill Tingley.
Tingley added that the issue
has not arisen in any of his
recruiting trips. "People don't
make it a point to bring it up
because they are more concerned
with the admissions process. It
hasn't affected admissions or
recruitment at all," he said.
Abusing the system?
Beyond providing the Univer
sity as a whole with a stronger
academic image, some said they
believe that the change will help
decrease the abuses sustained by
the old policy.
In past years, many students,
especially those in science tracks,
made a practice of retaking intro
ductory classes, such as Chem
istry 31, "Chemical Principles,"
and Physics 51, "Mechanics."
These courses are commonly
perceived as "gatekeeper cours
es," designed to "weed out" those
students who might not be able to
handle the track.
Last year, as many as 20 per
cent of the 600-plus students in
introductory chemistry courses
had taken the class before, said
Sharon Brauman, who advises
chemistry majors.

"The old retaking policy defi
nitely put freshmen at a disadvan
tage," said Chemistry Prof.
Chistopher Chidsey, who teaches
Chem 31. "Not only are they tak
ing a difficult class, they are com
peting with people who not only
already have a year of college in
their experience, but who already
have had the material."
Che agreed that the new policy
will help freshmen who are taking

courses with upperclassmen.
"The way it was before promoted
a lot of abuse, especially because
struggling students weren't the
only ones retaking classes," he
said.
In addition, fewer people retak
ing classes will free more seats in
overcrowded courses, Che said.
Not all students, however, feel
that the change is positive for
Stanford students.
Senior David Cohen, who
actively opposed the grading poli
cy changes last year, said that
although "it's not a horrible
thing, the system [last year]
wasn't being abused, it seems.
"The problem is teaching phi

losophy. They have all these
'weed-out' courses that force peo
ple to retake them," Cohen said.
"I wish they would run courses in
such a way that people didn't
have to retake them."
A step in the right direction
In general, however, most stu
dents and faculty said they view
the policy change as a positive
step for the University.
"It's a good change," Stocker
said. "It doesn't prevent people
from retaking courses if they need
to, but it makes people take their
academics more seriously."
Seto said the new policy does
not deviate completely from the
old one. "As someone who has
retaken a class before, I think
that the policy would not have
changed my decisions to retake
or not retake a course. The new
policy just makes it more explic
it."
Freshman Gene Lee said the
policy will help eradicate the
image that "Stanford is full of
academically flaky people."
"I think that Stanford should
pursue a policy of honesty, and
it's honest to put on someone's
transcript if they retook the
class," he said. "This helps Stan
ford to move toward more hon
esty."
Another freshman, Joe West
ersund, said he agrees that the
new policy is a positive change,
but for different reasons. "It
seems like it's good to ask people
to move on and not pay so much
attention to just grades. That
way, they would get more out of
education," he said.
