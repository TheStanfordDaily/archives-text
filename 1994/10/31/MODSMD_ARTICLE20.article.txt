# Women shouldn't wait for encouragement to participate in classes
## 
### 
I would like to offer a different angle
on the issue of gender-based educational
equality in response to Jennifer Chien's
letter (Oct. 27). I attended Novato High
School, a public school located 20 miles
north of San Francisco. In my graduat
ing class of 280, 14 students had a cumu

lative GPA of 4.0 or better. Every one of
these students was female. Both my cal
culus and physics classes were 60 percent
women. We did not have one male serve
as a class officer in all four years.
I know my class is a startling excep
tion. But I think it serves to show the
possibilities. My school was not at all
progressive — we did not sit at circular
tables or downplay competition. My
teachers were not unusual. I don't know
what "ambitious bug" the girls in my
class caught. All I know is that we
didn't just survive what was supposedly
a male-oriented environment; we

thrived.
Gender bias is a real problem, and
society exerts a very strong influence on
all of us. But I think it is degrading to
women when we assume that they can
not overcome these obstacles. I am a
believer in free will and the internal
power of individuals. I am not a victim
to my fate of being born female. To
assume that women can be dominated,
broken and silenced by public sentiment
is not giving women the credit they
deserve.
Chien asked, "Are we to stand silent
while the male population as a whole

receives a better, more interactive edu
cation?" and that is a very compelling
question. But as for myself, I am not
silent by any means, and I am getting
just as good an education as any man
here because I am taking initiative and
looking out for myself. I am not waiting
for people to "encourage women to par
ticipate in class." To support our claims
of strength, we must take responsibility
for ourselves. Let's exercise our critical
minds, and challenge society when it
tells us "we are unable."
