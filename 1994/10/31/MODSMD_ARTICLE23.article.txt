## Lady runners No. 1 Women defend Pac-10 title; men place disappointing 5th 
### Todd Bernstein Staff writer 
For Stanford cross country, it
was a tale of two teams Saturday,
as the No. 8 women hit a season
high and the No. 6 men hit a sea
son low.
The Cardinal women's team
placed five runners in the top 16
spots to capture the Pacific 10
Championship for the second
straight year.
Freshman sensation Kortney
Dunscombe led the Cardinal from
beginning to end and missed third
by mere inches, finishing fourth
with a time of 17 minutes, 12 sec
onds.
"It was exciting to win the Pac
-10 championship because it had
been one of our goals for the sea
son," Dunscombe said. "We pulled
off a really good race."
Sophomore Monal Choksi
stepped up for Stanford by finish
ing with a personal-best time of
17:48. On the final stretch, Choksi
passed a string of runners to earn
10th place.
"I was really excited today," she
said. "I wanted to make a differ
ence for the team, and I just had it
with me today."
Following Dunscombe and
Choksi were freshman Sarna Ren
fro (13th place), senior Sarah Tru
itt (14th place) and sophomore

Amanda White (16th place).
According to coach Vin Lanan
na, the women did exactly what
they were expected to do — repeat
as Pac-10 champs.
"They did a great job," he said.
"They knew what they had to do —
they had firepower up front, and
they pulled it together [at the
end]."
Lananna also added that the
team's strength allowed it to take
some chances. The team did, in
fact, run out faster than usual. The
gamble paid off though, as Stan
ford emerged as the first team to
have five runners cross the finish
line.
The men, however, finished a
disappointing fifth behind Arizona,
UCLA, Washington and Oregon.
"We completely fell apart men
tally and physically," said sopho
more Brian Zmijewski.
Despite the poor finish, howev
er, Lananna insisted it isn't time
for the men to panic.
"When you have a young team,
they're going to have their ups and
downs," he said. "Three weeks ago
they didn't feel they had a chance
at winning the Pac-lOs. Then sud
denly they win at Michigan, and
they become favorites to win. It's a
hard role to assume."
Sophomore Greg Jimmerson
provided the lone bright spot for
the Cardinal, placing sixth with a
time of 24:51.
Although disappointed with his
team's performance, Jimmerson
was pleased with his individual
run.
"I thought I had a decent race,
but I would have liked to have fin
ished higher," he said. "I'm hoping
for a better performance in two
weeks."
The men as well as the women
have two weeks to prepare for the
all-important District-8 Champi
onship, which takes place on Nov.
12 in Tuscon, Ariz.
The event will decide which
teams will compete in the NCAA
Championships, which will take
place on Nov. 21 in Fayetteville,
Ark.
The top two finishers in each of
the eight districts automatically
qualify, while the third place teams
will have to wait until the following
Monday to see if they clinched a
wild card spot.
Lananna feels that his teams
will be ready for the final races of
the season and believes that the
men will have no problems shaking
off their dismal finish on Saturday.
"We'll pull it together," Lanan
na said. "I have a lot of confidence
in these guys. We'll be better in two
weeks, I guarantee it."
As for the women, they simply
need to continue to do what they
have done all year, and Lananna
thinks they are close to reaching
their peak.
"I think we're beginning to
round the turn," the coach said. "In
two weeks we'll be better, and
hopefully in three weeks, we'll be
even better than that."
