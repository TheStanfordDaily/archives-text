Sunday's men's soccer game at
Cal involved a lot of give and take.
Unfortunately, in the end the
Bears took both the game and any
chance Stanford had to make the
playoffs.
Regulation time ended with
the score tied a 1-1 tie, but Cali
fornia (7-8-1) scored in each of
the two 15-minute overtime peri
ods to defeat Stanford (4-11-2) 3-
1. The Cardinal played a strong
first half and led by 1-0 at half
time. However, from that point
on, Stanford could not maintain
its edge and the Bears slowly
whittled out a victory.
"I thought we dominated most

of the game," said senior mid
fielder Greg Wilson. "A couple of
errors cost us, but the 3-1 score is
not indicative of the way the
game went. It could have gone
either way."
The Cardinal needed this
match to go its way. Stanford had
to secure the Mountain Division
to gain a spot in the post-season
playoffs. To capture the confer
ence, the team had to win its last
two conference games versus Cal
and San Jose State. Also, the Uni
versity of Washington would have
to lose its final league game.
"We didn't keep up our end of
the bargain," Wilson said. "With
our record we don't have a chance
for an at-large bid."
In the first half, freshman
midfielder / forward Justin
Leßlanc scored early off of a cor
ner kick from sophomore defend
er Brad Davies. The game
remained tightly contested until
Stanford suffered sporadic defen
sive breakdowns and allowed the
Bears into its goal.
Stanford started one of its
youngest line-ups of the season.
Due to serious injuries to many
established starters and the
absence of key defender senior Jeff
Kogl due to red cards, the Cardinal
played with a serious handicap in
experience.
"Inexperience showed its ugly
face in this game," head coach
Colin Lindores said. "We looked
good in the first half. Later, big
mistakes cost us goals. It's frus
trating for them and for the coach
es, but it's a learning process."
Along with inexperience, the
artificial turf at Cal also figured in
as a negative factor in the Cardi
nal's loss.
"One thing was evident," Lin
dores said. "They were the better
team on turf. They had already
played three or four games on it
and they demonstrated that they
were more used to it."
On the positive side, Lindores
commended Wilson's performance.
Also, the coaching staff had the
opportunity to evaluate young
players and get a better grasp of
how next season might shape up.
"This loss is going to have an
effect on team morale," Wilson
said. "But we're definitely looking
to the future."

Sophomore back Brad Davies powers a pass in a game earlier this
season; unfortunately the team wasn't powerful enough against Cal
to get the win.
