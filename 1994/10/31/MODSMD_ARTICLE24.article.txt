Sunday's men's soccer game at
Cal involved a lot of give and take.
Unfortunately, in the end the
Bears took both the game and any
chance Stanford had to make the
playoffs.
Regulation time ended with
the score tied a 1-1 tie, but Cali
fornia (7-8-1) scored in each of
the two 15-minute overtime peri
ods to defeat Stanford (4-11-2) 3-
1. The Cardinal played a strong
first half and led by 1-0 at half
time. However, from that point
on, Stanford could not maintain
its edge and the Bears slowly
whittled out a victory.
"I thought we dominated most

of the game," said senior mid
fielder Greg Wilson. "A couple of
errors cost us, but the 3-1 score is
not indicative of the way the
game went. It could have gone
either way."
The Cardinal needed this
match to go its way. Stanford had
to secure the Mountain Division
to gain a spot in the post-season
playoffs. To capture the confer
ence, the team had to win its last
two conference games versus Cal
and San Jose State. Also, the Uni
versity of Washington would have
to lose its final league game.
"We didn't keep up our end of
the bargain," Wilson said. "With
our record we don't have a chance
for an at-large bid."
In the first half, freshman
midfielder / forward Justin
Le√ülanc scored early off of a cor
ner kick from sophomore defend
er Brad Davies. The game
remained tightly contested until
